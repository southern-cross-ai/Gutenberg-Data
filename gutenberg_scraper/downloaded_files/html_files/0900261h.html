<h2><a id="ch0"></a>PROLOGUE.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE stag of Texas, reclining in midnight lair, is startled
from his slumbers by the hoofstroke of a horse.</p>

<p>He does not forsake his covert, nor yet rise to his feet.  His
domain is shared by the wild steeds of the savannah, given to
nocturnal straying. He only uprears his head; and, with antlers
o'ertopping the tall grass, listens for a repetition of the
sound.</p>

<p>Again is the hoofstroke heard, but with altered intonation.
There is a ring of metal--the clinking of steel against
stone.</p>

<p>The sound, significant to the ear of the stag, causes a quick
change in his air and attitude.  Springing clear of his couch,
and bounding a score of yards across the prairie, he pauses to
look back upon the disturber of his dreams.</p>

<p>In the clear moonlight of a southern sky, he recognises the
most ruthless of his enemies--man.  One is approaching upon
horseback.</p>

<p>Yielding to instinctive dread, he is about to resume his
flight: when something in the appearance of the horseman--some
unnatural seeming--holds him transfixed to the spot.</p>

<p>With haunches in quivering contact with the sward, and
frontlet faced to the rear, he continues to gaze--his large brown
eyes straining upon the intruder in a mingled expression of fear
and bewilderment.</p>

<p>What has challenged the stag to such protracted scrutiny?</p>

<p>The horse is perfect in all its parts--a splendid steed,
saddled, bridled, and otherwise completely caparisoned.  In it
there appears nothing amiss--nothing to produce either wonder or
alarm.  But the man--the rider?  Ah!  About him there <i>is</i>
something to cause both&mdash;something weird&mdash;something
<i>wanting</i>!</p>

<p>By heavens! it is the head!</p>

<p>Even the unreasoning animal can perceive this; and, after
gazing a moment with wildered eyes&mdash;wondering what abnormal
monster thus mocks its cervine intelligence&mdash;terror-stricken
it continues its retreat; nor again pauses, till it has plunged
through the waters of the Leona, and placed the current of the
stream between itself and the ghastly intruder.</p>

<p>Heedless of the affrighted deer&mdash;either of its presence,
or precipitate flight&mdash;the Headless Horseman rides on.</p>

<p>He, too, is going in the direction of the river.  Unlike the
stag, he does not seem pressed for time; but advances in a slow,
tranquil pace: so silent as to seem ceremonious.</p>

<p>Apparently absorbed in solemn thought, he gives free rein to
his steed: permitting the animal, at intervals, to snatch a
mouthful of the herbage growing by the way.  Nor does he, by
voice or gesture, urge it impatiently onward, when the howl-bark
of the prairie-wolf causes it to fling its head on high, and
stand snorting in its tracks.</p>

<p>He appears to be under the influence of some all-absorbing
emotion, from which no common incident can awake him.  There is
no speech&mdash;not a whisper&mdash;to betray its nature.  The
startled stag, his own horse, the wolf, and the midnight moon,
are the sole witnesses of his silent abstraction.</p>

<p>His shoulders shrouded under a <i>serape</i>, one edge of
which, flirted up by the wind, displays a portion of his figure:
his limbs encased in "water-guards" of jaguar-skin: thus
sufficiently sheltered against the dews of the night, or the
showers of a tropical sky, he rides on&mdash;silent as the stars
shining above, unconcerned as the cicada that chirrups in the
grass beneath, or the prairie breeze playing with the drapery of
his dress.</p>

<p>Something at length appears to rouse from his reverie, and
stimulate him to greater speed&mdash;his steed, at the same time.
The latter, tossing up its head, gives utterance to a joyous
neigh; and, with outstretched neck, and spread nostrils, advances
in a gait gradually increasing to a canter.  The proximity of the
river explains the altered pace.</p>

<p>The horse halts not again, till the crystal current is surging
against his flanks, and the legs of his rider are submerged
knee-deep under the surface.</p>

<p>The animal eagerly assuages its thirst; crosses to the
opposite side; and, with vigorous stride, ascends the sloping
bank.</p>

<p>Upon the crest occurs a pause: as if the rider tarried till
his steed should shake the water from its flanks.  There is a
rattling of saddle-flaps, and stirrup-leathers, resembling
thunder, amidst a cloud of vapour, white as the spray of a
cataract.</p>

<p>Out of this self-constituted <i>nimbus</i>, the Headless
Horseman emerges; and moves onward, as before.</p>

<p>Apparently pricked by the spur, and guided by the rein, of his
rider, the horse no longer strays from the track; but steps
briskly forward, as if upon a path already trodden.</p>

<p>A treeless savannah stretches before&mdash;selvedged by the
sky.  Outlined against the azure is seen the imperfect centaurean
shape gradually dissolving in the distance, till it becomes lost
to view, under the mystic gloaming of the moonlight!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER ONE.<br>

THE BURNT PRAIRIE.</h2>

<p class="first">
ON the great plain of Texas, about a hundred miles southward
from the old Spanish town of San Antonio de Bejar, the noonday
sun is shedding his beams from a sky of cerulean brightness.
Under the golden light appears a group of objects, but little in
unison with the landscape around them: since they betoken the
presence of human beings, in a spot where there is no sign of
human habitation.</p>

<p>The objects in question are easily identified&mdash;even at a
great distance. They are waggons; each covered with its ribbed
and rounded tilt of snow-white "Osnaburgh."</p>

<p>There are ten of them&mdash;scarce enough to constitute a
"caravan" of traders, nor yet a "government train."  They are
more likely the individual property of an emigrant; who has
landed upon the coast, and is wending his way to one of the
late-formed settlements on the Leona.</p>

<p>Slowly crawling across the savannah, it could scarce be told
that they are in motion; but for their relative-position, in long
serried line, indicating the order of march.</p>

<p>The dark bodies between each two declare that the teams are
attached; and that they are making progress is proved, by the
retreating antelope, scared from its noonday <i>siesta</i>, and
the long-shanked curlew, rising with a screech from the
sward&mdash;both bird and beast wondering at the string of
strange <i>behemoths</i>, thus invading their wilderness
domain.</p>

<p>Elsewhere upon the prairie, no movement may be
detected&mdash;either of bird or quadruped.  It is the time of
day when all tropical life becomes torpid, or seeks repose in the
shade; man alone, stimulated by the love of gain, or the
promptings of ambition, disregarding the laws of nature, and
defying the fervour of the sun.</p>

<p>So seems it with the owner of the tilted train; who, despite
the relaxing influence of the fierce mid-day heat, keeps moving
on.</p>

<p>That he is an emigrant&mdash;and not one of the ordinary
class&mdash;is evidenced in a variety of ways.  The ten large
waggons of Pittsburgh build, each hauled by eight able-bodied
mules; their miscellaneous contents: plenteous provisions,
articles of costly furniture, even of <i>luxe</i>, live stock in
the shape of coloured women and children; the groups of black and
yellow bondsmen, walking alongside, or straggling foot-sore in
the rear; the light travelling carriage in the lead, drawn by a
span of sleek-coated Kentucky mules, and driven by a black Jehu,
sweltering in a suit of livery; all bespeak, not a poor
Northern-States settler in search of a new home, but a rich
Southerner who has already purchased one, and is on his way to
take possession of it.</p>

<p>And this is the exact story of the train.  It is the property
of a planter who has landed at Indianola, on the Gulf of
Matagorda; and is now travelling overland&mdash;<i>en route</i>
for his destination.</p>

<p>In the <i>cortege</i> that accompanies it, riding habitually
at its head, is the planter himself&mdash;Woodley
Poindexter&mdash;a tall thin man of fifty, with a slightly
sallowish complexion, and aspect proudly severe.  He is simply
though not inexpensively clad: in a loosely fitting frock of
alpaca cloth, a waistcoat of black satin, and trousers of nankin.
A shirt of finest linen shows its plaits through the opening of
his vest&mdash; its collar embraced by a piece of black ribbon;
while the shoe, resting in his stirrup, is of finest tanned
leather.  His features are shaded by a broad-brimmed Leghorn
hat.</p>

<p>Two horsemen are riding alongside&mdash;one on his right, the
other on the left&mdash;a stripling scarce twenty, and a young
man six or seven years older.  The former is his son&mdash;a
youth, whose open cheerful countenance contrasts, not only with
the severe aspect of his father, but with the somewhat sinister
features on the other side, and which belong to his cousin.</p>

<p>The youth is dressed in a French blouse of sky-coloured
"cottonade," with trousers of the same material; a most
appropriate costume for a southern climate, and which, with the
Panama hat upon his head, is equally becoming.</p>

<p>The cousin, an ex-officer of volunteers, affects a military
undress of dark blue cloth, with a forage cap to correspond.</p>

<p>There is another horseman riding near, who, only on account of
having a white skin&mdash;not white for all that&mdash;is
entitled to description.  His coarser features, and cheaper
habiliments; the keel-coloured "cowhide" clutched in his right
hand, and flirted with such evident skill, proclaim him the
overseer&mdash;and whipper up&mdash;of the swarthy pedestrians
composing the <i>entourage</i> of the train.</p>

<p>The travelling carriage, which is a "carriole"&mdash;a sort of
cross between a Jersey waggon and a barouche&mdash;has two
occupants.  One is a young lady of the whitest skin; the other a
girl of the blackest.  The former is the daughter of Woodley
Poindexter&mdash;his only daughter.  She of the sable complexion
is the young lady's handmaid.</p>

<p>The emigrating party is from the "coast" of the
Mississippi&mdash;from Louisiana.  The planter is not himself a
native of this State&mdash;in other words a <i>Creole</i>; but
the type is exhibited in the countenance of his son&mdash;still
more in that fair face, seen occasionally through the curtains of
the carriole, and whose delicate features declare descent from
one of those endorsed damsels&mdash;<i>filles a la
casette</i>&mdash;who, more than a hundred years ago, came across
the Atlantic provided with proofs of their virtue&mdash;in the
<i>casket</i>!</p>

<p>A grand sugar planter of the South is Woodley Poindexter; one
of the highest and haughtiest of his class; one of the most
profuse in aristocratic hospitalities: hence the necessity of
forsaking his Mississippian home, and transferring himself and
his "penates,"&mdash;with only a remnant of his
"niggers,"&mdash;to the wilds of south-western Texas.</p>

<p>The sun is upon the meridian line, and almost in the zenith.
The travellers tread upon their own shadows.  Enervated by the
excessive heat, the white horsemen sit silently in their saddles.
Even the dusky pedestrians, less sensible to its influence, have
ceased their garrulous "gumbo;" and, in straggling groups,
shamble listlessly along in the rear of the waggons.</p>

<p>The silence&mdash;solemn as that of a funereal
procession&mdash;is interrupted only at intervals by the
pistol-like crack of a whip, or the loud "wo-ha," delivered in deep baritone from the thick lips of some sable teamster.</p>

<p>Slowly the train moves on, as if groping its way.  There is no
regular road.  The route is indicated by the wheel-marks of some
vehicles that have passed before&mdash;barely conspicuous, by
having crushed the culms of the shot grass.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the slow progress, the teams are doing their
best.  The planter believes himself within less than twenty miles
of the end of his journey.  He hopes to reach it before night:
hence the march continued through the mid-day heat.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly the drivers are directed to pull up, by a sign
from the overseer; who has been riding a hundred yards in the
advance, and who is seen to make a sudden stop&mdash;as if some
obstruction had presented itself.</p>

<p>He comes trotting back towards the train.  His gestures tell
of something amiss.  What is it?</p>

<p>There has been much talk about Indians&mdash;of a probability
of their being encountered in this quarter.</p>

<p>Can it be the red-skinned marauders?  Scarcely: the gestures
of the overseer do not betray actual alarm.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mr Sansom?" asked the planter, as the man rode
up.</p>

<p>"The grass air burnt.  The prairy's been afire."</p>

<p>"<i>Been</i> on fire!  Is it on fire <i>now</i>?" hurriedly
inquired the owner of the waggons, with an apprehensive glance
towards the travelling carriage.  "Where?  I see no smoke!"</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;no," stammered the overseer, becoming conscious
that he had caused unnecessary alarm; "I didn't say it air afire
now: only thet it hez been, an the hul ground air as black as the
ten o' spades."</p>

<p>"Ta&mdash;tat! what of that?  I suppose we can travel over a
black prairie, as safely as a green one?</p>

<p>"What nonsense of you, Josh Sansom, to raise such a row about
nothing&mdash; frightening people out of their senses!  Ho!
there, you niggers!  Lay the leather to your teams, and let the
train proceed.  Whip up!&mdash;whip up!"</p>

<p>"But, Captain Calhoun," protested the overseer, in response to
the gentleman who had reproached him in such chaste terms; "how
air we to find the way?"</p>

<p>"Find the way!  What are you raving about?  We haven't lost
it&mdash;have we?"</p>

<p>"I'm afeerd we hev, though.  The wheel-tracks ain't no longer
to be seen.  They're burnt out, along wi' the grass."</p>

<p>"What matters that?  I reckon we can cross a piece of scorched
prairie, without wheel-marks to guide us?  We'll find them again
on the other side."</p>

<p>"Ye-es," naively responded the overseer, who, although a
"down-easter," had been far enough west to have learnt something
of frontier life; "if theer air any other side.  I kedn't see it
out o' the seddle&mdash;ne'er a sign o' it."</p>

<p>"Whip up, niggers! whip up!" shouted Calhoun, without heeding
the remark; and spurring onwards, as a sign that the order was to
be obeyed.</p>

<p>The teams are again set in motion; and, after advancing to the
edge of the burnt tract, without instructions from any one, are
once more brought to a stand.</p>

<p>The white men on horseback draw together for a consultation.
There is need: as all are satisfied by a single glance directed
to the ground before them.</p>

<p>Far as the eye can reach the country is of one uniform
colour&mdash;black as Erebus.  There is nothing green&mdash;not a
blade of grass&mdash;not a reed nor weed!</p>

<p>It is after the summer solstice.  The ripened culms of the
<i>gramineae</i>, and the stalks of the prairie flowers, have
alike crumbled into dust under the devastating breath of
fire.</p>

<p>In front&mdash;on the right and left&mdash;to the utmost verge
of vision extends the scene of desolation.  Over it the cerulean
sky is changed to a darker blue; the sun, though clear of clouds,
seems to scowl rather than shine&mdash;as if reciprocating the
frown of the earth.</p>

<p>The overseer has made a correct report&mdash;there is no trail
visible.  The action of the fire, as it raged among the ripe
grass, has eliminated the impression of the wheels hitherto
indicating the route.  "What are we to do?"</p>

<p>The planter himself put this inquiry, in a tone that told of a
vacillating spirit.</p>

<p>"Do, uncle Woodley!  What else but keep straight on?  The
river must be on the other side?  If we don't hit the crossing,
to a half mile or so, we can go up, or down the bank&mdash;as the
case may require."</p>

<p>"But, Cassius: if we should lose our way?"</p>

<p>"We can't.  There's but a patch of this, I suppose?  If we do
go a little astray, we must come out somewhere&mdash;on one side,
or the other."</p>

<p>"Well, nephew, you know best: I shall be guided by you."</p>

<p>"No fear, uncle.  I've made my way out of a worse fix than
this.  Drive on, niggers!  Keep straight after <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>The ex-officer of volunteers, casting a conceited glance
towards the travelling carriage&mdash;through the curtains of
which appears a fair face, slightly shadowed with
anxiety&mdash;gives the spur to his horse; and with confident air
trots onward.</p>

<p>A chorus of whipcracks is succeeded by the trampling of
fourscore mules, mingled with the clanking of wheels against
their hubs.  The waggon-train is once more in motion.</p>

<p>The mules step out with greater rapidity.  The sable surface,
strange to their eyes, excites them to brisker
action&mdash;causing them to raise the hoof, as soon as it
touches the turf.  The younger animals show fear&mdash; snorting,
as they advance.</p>

<p>In time their apprehensions become allayed; and, taking the
cue from their older associates, they move on steadily as
before.</p>

<p>A mile or more is made, apparently in a direct line from the
point of starting.  Then there is a halt.  The self-appointed
guide has ordered it.  He has reined up his horse; and is sitting
in the saddle with less show of confidence.  He appears to be
puzzled about the direction.</p>

<p>The landscape&mdash;if such it may be called&mdash;has assumed
a change; though not for the better.  It is still sable as ever,
to the verge of the horizon.  But the surface is no longer a
plain: it <i>rolls</i>.  There are ridges&mdash;gentle
undulations&mdash;with valleys between.  They are not entirely
treeless&mdash;though nothing that may be termed a tree is in
sight.  There have been such, before the
fire&mdash;<i>algarobias, mezquites</i>, and others of the acacia
family&mdash;standing solitary, or in copses.  Their light
pinnate foliage has disappeared like flax before the flame. Their
existence is only evidenced by charred trunks, and blackened
boughs.</p>

<p>"You've lost the way, nephew?" said the planter, riding
rapidly up.</p>

<p>"No uncle&mdash;not yet.  I've only stopped to have a look. It
must lie in this direction&mdash;down that valley.  Let them
drive on.  We're going all right&mdash;I'll answer for it."</p>

<p>Once more in motion&mdash;adown the slope&mdash;then along the
valley&mdash;then up the acclivity of another ridge&mdash;and
then there is a second stoppage upon its crest.</p>

<p>"You've lost the way, Cash?" said the planter, coming up and
repeating his former observation.</p>

<p>"Damned if I don't believe I have, uncle!" responded the
nephew, in a tone of not very respectful mistrust.  "Anyhow; who
the devil could find his way out of an ashpit like this?  No,
no!" he continued, reluctant to betray his embarrassment as the
carriole came up.  "I see now.  We're all right yet.  The river
must be in this direction.  Come on!"</p>

<p>On goes the guide, evidently irresolute.  On follow the sable
teamsters, who, despite their stolidity, do not fail to note some
signs of vacillation.  They can tell that they are no longer
advancing in a direct line; but circuitously among the copses,
and across the glades that stretch between.</p>

<p>All are gratified by a shout from the conductor, announcing
recovered confidence.  In response there is a universal explosion
of whipcord, with joyous exclamations.</p>

<p>Once more they are stretching their teams along a travelled
road&mdash;where a half-score of wheeled vehicles must have
passed before them.  And not long before: the wheel-tracks are of
recent impress&mdash;the hoof-prints of the animals fresh as if
made within the hour.  A train of waggons, not unlike their own,
must have passed over the burnt prairie!</p>

<p>Like themselves, it could only be going towards the Leona:
perhaps some government convoy on its way to Fort Inge?  In that
case they have only to keep in the same track.  The Fort is on
the line of their march&mdash;but a short distance beyond the
point where their journey is to terminate.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more opportune.  The guide, hitherto
perplexed&mdash;though without acknowledging it&mdash;is at once
relieved of all anxiety; and with a fresh exhibition of conceit,
orders the route to be resumed.</p>

<p>For a mile or more the waggon-tracks are followed&mdash;not in
a direct line, but bending about among the skeleton copses.  The
countenance of Cassius Calhoun, for a while wearing a confident
look, gradually becomes clouded.  It assumes the profoundest
expression of despondency, on discovering that the four-and-forty
wheel-tracks he is following, have been made by ten Pittsburgh
waggons, and a carriole&mdash;the same that are now following
him, and in whose company he has been travelling <i>all the way
from the Gulf of Matagorda</i>!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER TWO.<br>

THE TRAIL OF THE LAZO.</h2>

<p class="first">
BEYOND doubt, the waggons of Woodley Poindexter were going
over ground already traced by the tiring of their wheels.</p>

<p>"Our own tracks!" muttered Calhoun on making the discovery,
adding a fierce oath as he reined up.</p>

<p>"Our own tracks!  What mean you, Cassius?  You don't say we've
been travelling&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On our own tracks.  I do, uncle; that very thing.  We must
have made a complete circumbendibus of it.  See! here's the hind
hoof of my own horse, with half a shoe off; and there's the foot
of the niggers. Besides, I can tell the ground.  That's the very
hill we went down as we left our last stopping place.  Hang the
crooked luck!  We've made a couple of miles for nothing."</p>

<br>

<p>Embarrassment is no longer the only expression upon the face
of the speaker.  It has deepened to chagrin, with an admixture of
shame.  It is through him that the train is without a regular
guide.  One, engaged at Indianola, had piloted them to their last
camping place.  There, in consequence of some dispute, due to the
surly temper of the ex-captain of volunteers, the man had
demanded his dismissal, and gone back.</p>

<p>For this&mdash;as also for an ill-timed display of confidence
in his power to conduct the march&mdash;is the planter's nephew
now suffering under a sense of shame.  He feels it keenly as the
carriole comes up, and bright eyes become witnesses of his
discomfiture.</p>

<p>Poindexter does not repeat his inquiry.  That the road is lost
is a fact evident to all.  Even the barefooted or "broganned"
pedestrians have recognised their long-heeled footprints, and
become aware that they are for the second time treading upon the
same ground.</p>

<p>There is a general halt, succeeded by an animated conversation
among the white men.  The situation is serious: the planter
himself believes it to be so.  He cannot that day reach the end
of his journey&mdash;a thing upon which he had set his mind.</p>

<p>That is the very least misfortune that can befall them.  There
are others possible, and probable.  There are perils upon the
burnt plain. They may be compelled to spend the night upon it,
with no water for their animals.  Perhaps a second day and
night&mdash;or longer&mdash;who can tell how long?</p>

<p>How are they to find their way?  The sun is beginning to
descend; though still too high in heaven to indicate his line of
declination.  By waiting a while they may discover the quarters
of the compass.</p>

<p>But to what purpose?  The knowledge of east, west, north, and
south can avail nothing now: they have lost their <i>line of
march</i>.</p>

<p>Calhoun has become cautious.  He no longer volunteers to point
out the path.  He hesitates to repeat his pioneering
experiments&mdash;after such manifest and shameful failure.</p>

<p>A ten minutes' discussion terminates in nothing.  No one can
suggest a feasible plan of proceeding.  No one knows how to
escape from the embrace of that dark desert, which appears to
cloud not only the sun and sky, but the countenances of all who
enter within its limits.</p>

<p>A flock of black vultures is seen flying afar off.  They come
nearer, and nearer.  Some alight upon the ground&mdash;others
hover above the heads of the strayed travellers.  Is there a
boding in the behaviour of the birds?</p>

<p>Another ten minutes is spent in the midst of moral and
physical gloom. Then, as if by a benignant mandate from heaven,
does cheerfulness re-assume its sway.  The cause?  A horseman
riding in the direction of the train!</p>

<p>An unexpected sight: who could have looked for human being in
such a place?  All eyes simultaneously sparkle with joy; as if,
in the approach of the horseman, they beheld the advent of a
saviour!</p>

<p>"He's coming this way, is he not?" inquired the planter,
scarce confident in his failing sight.</p>

<p>"Yes, father; straight as he can ride," replied Henry, lifting
the hat from his head, and waving it on high: the action
accompanied by a shout intended to attract the horseman.</p>

<p>The signal was superfluous.  The stranger had already sighted
the halted waggons; and, riding towards them at a gallop, was
soon within speaking distance.</p>

<p>He did not draw bridle, until he had passed the train; and
arrived upon the spot occupied by the planter and his party.</p>

<p>"A Mexican!" whispered Henry, drawing his deduction from the
habiliments of the horseman.</p>

<p>"So much the better," replied Poindexter, in the same tone of
voice; "he'll be all the more likely to know the road."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of Mexican about him," muttered Calhoun, "excepting
the rig. I'll soon see.  <i>Buenos dias, cavallero!  Esta V.
Mexicano</i>?"  (Good day, sir! are you a Mexican?)</p>

<p>"No, indeed," replied the stranger, with a protesting smile.
"Anything but that.  I can speak to you in Spanish, if you prefer
it; but I dare say you will understand me better in English:
which, I presume, is your native tongue?"</p>

<p>Calhoun, suspecting that he had spoken indifferent Spanish, or
indifferently pronounced it, refrains from making rejoinder.</p>

<p>"<i>American</i>, sir," replied Poindexter, his national pride
feeling slightly piqued.  Then, as if fearing to offend the man
from whom he intended asking a favour, he added: "Yes, sir; we
are all Americans&mdash; from the <i>Southern States</i>."</p>

<p>"That I can perceive by your following."  An expression of
contempt&mdash; scarce perceptible&mdash;showed itself upon the
countenance of the speaker, as his eye rested upon the groups of
black bondsmen.  "I can perceive, too," he added, "that you are
strangers to prairie travelling.  You have lost your way?"</p>

<p>"We have, sir; and have very little prospect of recovering it,
unless we may count upon your kindness to direct us."</p>

<p>"Not much kindness in that.  By the merest chance I came upon
your trail, as I was crossing the prairie.  I saw you were going
astray; and have ridden this way to set you right."</p>

<p>"It is very good of you.  We shall be most thankful, sir.  My
name is Poindexter&mdash;Woodley Poindexter, of Louisiana.  I
have purchased a property on the Leona river, near Fort Inge.  We
were in hopes of reaching it before nightfall.  Can we do
so?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to hinder you: if you follow the
instructions I shall give."</p>

<p>On saying this, the stranger rode a few paces apart; and
appeared to scrutinise the country&mdash;as if to determine the
direction which the travellers should take.</p>

<p>Poised conspicuously upon the crest of the ridge, horse and
man presented a picture worthy of skilful delineation.</p>

<p>A steed, such as might have been ridden by an Arab
sheik&mdash;blood-bay in colour&mdash;broad in counter&mdash;with
limbs clean as culms of cane, and hips of elliptical outline,
continued into a magnificent tail sweeping rearward like a
rainbow: on his back a rider&mdash;a young man of not more than
five-and-twenty&mdash;of noble form and features; habited in the
picturesque costume of a Mexican <i>ranchero</i>&mdash;spencer
jacket of velveteen&mdash;<i>calzoneros</i> laced along the
seams&mdash;<i>calzoncillos</i> of snow-white
lawn&mdash;<i>botas</i> of buff leather, heavily spurred at the
heels&mdash; around the waist a scarf of scarlet crape; and on
his head a hat of black glaze, banded with gold bullion.  Picture
to yourself a horseman thus habited; seated in a deep
tree-saddle, of Moorish shape and Mexican manufacture, with
housings of leather stamped in antique patterns, such as were
worn by the caparisoned steeds of the Conquistadores; picture to
yourself such a <i>cavallero</i>, and you will have before your
mind's eye a counterpart of him, upon whom the planter and his
people were gazing.</p>

<p>Through the curtains of the travelling carriage he was
regarded with glances that spoke of a singular sentiment.  For
the first time in her life, Louise Poindexter looked upon
that&mdash;hitherto known only to her imagination&mdash;a man of
heroic mould.  Proud might he have been, could he have guessed
the interest which his presence was exciting in the breast of the
young Creole.</p>

<p>He could not, and did not.  He was not even aware of her
existence.  He had only glanced at the dust-bedaubed vehicle in
passing&mdash;as one might look upon the rude incrustation of an
oyster, without suspecting that a precious pearl may lie gleaming
inside.</p>

<p>"By my faith!" he declared, facing round to the owner of the
waggons, "I can discover no landmarks for you to steer by.  For
all that, I can find the way myself.  You will have to cross the
Leona five miles below the Fort; and, as I have to go by the
crossing myself, <i>you</i> can follow the tracks of my horse.
Good day, gentlemen!"</p>

<p>Thus abruptly bidding adieu, he pressed the spur against the
side of his steed; and started off at a gallop.</p>

<p>An unexpected&mdash;almost uncourteous departure!  So thought
the planter and his people.</p>

<p>They had no time to make observations upon it, before the
stranger was seen returning towards them!</p>

<p>In ten seconds he was again in their presence&mdash;all
listening to learn what had brought him back.</p>

<p>"I fear the tracks of my horse may prove of little service to
you.  The <i>mustangs</i> have been this way, since the fire.
They have made hoof-marks by the thousand.  Mine are shod; but,
as you are not accustomed to trailing, you may not be able to
distinguish them&mdash;the more so, that in these dry ashes all
horse-tracks are so nearly alike."</p>

<p>"What are we to do?" despairingly asked the planter.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Mr Poindexter, I cannot stay to conduct you, I am
riding express, with a despatch for the Fort.  If you
<i>should</i> lose my trail, keep the sun on your right
shoulders: so that your shadows may fall to the left, at an angle
of about fifteen degrees to your line of march. Go straight
forward for about five miles.  You will then come in sight of the
top of a tall tree&mdash;a <i>cypress</i>.  You will know it by
its leaves being <i>in the red</i>.  Head direct for this tree.
It stands on the bank of the river; and close by is the
crossing."</p>

<p>The young horseman, once more drawing up his reins, was about
to ride off; when something caused him to linger.  It was a pair
of dark lustrous eyes&mdash;observed by him for the first
time&mdash;glancing through the curtains of the travelling
carriage.</p>

<p>Their owner was in shadow; but there was light enough to show
that they were set in a countenance of surpassing loveliness.  He
perceived, moreover, that they were turned upon
himself&mdash;fixed, as he fancied, in an expression that
betokened interest&mdash;almost tenderness!</p>

<p>He returned it with an involuntary glance of admiration, which
he made but an awkward attempt to conceal.  Lest it might be
mistaken for rudeness, he suddenly faced round; and once more
addressed himself to the planter&mdash;who had just finished
thanking him for his civility.</p>

<p>"I am but ill deserving thanks," was his rejoinder, "thus to
leave you with a chance of losing your way.  But, as I've told
you, my time is measured."</p>

<p>The despatch-bearer consulted his watch&mdash;as though not a
little reluctant to travel alone.</p>

<p>"You are very kind, sir," said Poindexter; "but with the
directions you have given us, I think we shall be able to manage.
The sun will surely show us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No: now I look at the sky, it will not.  There are clouds
looming up on the north.  In an hour, the sun may be
obscured&mdash;at all events, before you can get within sight of
the cypress.  It will not do.  Stay!" he continued, after a
reflective pause, "I have a better plan still: <i>follow the
trail of my lazo</i>!"</p>

<p>While speaking, he had lifted the coiled rope from his
saddlebow, and flung the loose end to the earth&mdash;the other
being secured to a ring in the pommel.  Then raising his hat in
graceful salutation&mdash;more than half directed towards the
travelling carriage&mdash;he gave the spur to his steed; and once
more bounded off over the prairie.</p>

<p>The lazo, lengthening out, tightened over the hips of his
horse; and, dragging a dozen yards behind, left a line upon the
cinereous surface&mdash; as if some slender serpent had been
making its passage across the plain.</p>

<p>"An exceedingly curious fellow!" remarked the planter, as they
stood gazing after the horseman, fast becoming hidden behind a
cloud of sable dust.  "I ought to have asked him his name?"</p>

<p>"An exceedingly conceited fellow, I should say," muttered
Calhoun; who had not failed to notice the glance sent by the
stranger in the direction of the carriole, nor that which had
challenged it.  "As to his name, I don't think it matters much.
It mightn't be his own he would give you.  Texas is full of such
swells, who take new names when they get here&mdash;by way of
improvement, if for no better reason."</p>

<p>"Come, cousin Cash," protested young Poindexter; "you are
unjust to the stranger.  He appears to be educated&mdash;in fact,
a gentleman&mdash;worthy of bearing the best of names, I should
say."</p>

<p>"A gentleman!  Deuced unlikely: rigged out in that fanfaron
fashion.  I never saw a man yet, that took to a Mexican dress,
who wasn't a <i>Jack</i>. He's one, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>During this brief conversation, the fair occupant of the
carriole was seen to bend forward; and direct a look of evident
interest, after the form of the horseman fast receding from her
view.</p>

<p>To this, perhaps, might have been traced the acrimony
observable in the speech of Calhoun.</p>

<p>"What is it, Loo?" he inquired, riding close up to the
carriage, and speaking in a voice not loud enough to be heard by
the others.  "You appear impatient to go forward?  Perhaps you'd
like to ride off along with that swaggering fellow?  It isn't too
late: I'll lend you my horse."</p>

<p>The young girl threw herself back upon the
seat&mdash;evidently displeased, both by the speech and the tone
in which it was delivered.  But her displeasure, instead of
expressing itself in a frown, or in the shape of an indignant
rejoinder, was concealed under a guise far more galling to him
who had caused it.  A clear ringing laugh was the only reply
vouchsafed to him.</p>

<p>"So, so!  I thought there must be something&mdash;by the way
you behaved yourself in his presence.  You looked as if you would
have relished a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with this showy
despatch-bearer.  Taken with his stylish dress, I suppose?  Fine
feathers make fine birds.  His are borrowed.  I may strip them
off some day, along with a little of the skin that's under
them."</p>

<p>"For shame, Cassius! your words are a scandal!"</p>

<p>"'Tis you should think of scandal, Loo!  To let your thoughts
turn on a common scamp&mdash;a masquerading fellow like that!  No
doubt the letter carrier, employed by the officers at the
Fort!"</p>

<p>"A letter carrier, you think?  Oh, how I should like to get
love letters by such a postman!"</p>

<p>"You had better hasten on, and tell him so.  My horse is at
your service."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!  What a simpleton you show yourself!  Suppose,
for jesting's sake, I <i>did</i> have a fancy to overtake this
prairie postman! It couldn't be done upon that dull steed of
yours: not a bit of it!  At the rate he is going, he and his
blood-bay will be out of sight before you could change saddles
for me.  Oh, no! he's not to be overtaken by me, however much I
might like it; and perhaps I <i>might like it</i>!"</p>

<p>"Don't let your father hear you talk in that way."</p>

<p>"Don't let him hear <i>you</i> talk in that way," retorted the
young lady, for the first time speaking in a serious strain.
"Though you <i>are</i> my cousin, and papa may think you the pink
of perfection, I don't&mdash;not I! I never told you I
did&mdash;did I?"  A frown, evidently called forth by some
unsatisfactory reflection, was the only reply to this tantalising
interrogative.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> my cousin," she continued, in a tone that
contrasted strangely with the levity she had already exhibited,
"but you are nothing more&mdash;nothing more&mdash;Captain
Cassius Calhoun!  You have no claim to be my counsellor.  There
is but one from whom I am in duty bound to take advice, or bear
reproach.  I therefore beg of you, Master Cash, that you will not
again presume to repeat such sentiments&mdash;as those you have
just favoured me with.  I shall remain mistress of my own
thoughts&mdash;and actions, too&mdash;till I have found a master
who can control them.  It is not you!"</p>

<p>Having delivered this speech, with eyes flashing&mdash;half
angrily, half contemptuously&mdash;upon her cousin, the young
Creole once more threw herself back upon the cushions of the
carriole.</p>

<p>The closing curtains admonished the ex-officer, that further
conversation was not desired.</p>

<p>Quailing under the lash of indignant innocence, he was only
too happy to hear the loud "gee-on" of the teamsters, as the
waggons commenced moving over the sombre surface&mdash;not more
sombre than his own thoughts.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER THREE.<br>

THE PRAIRIE FINGER-POST.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE travellers felt no further uneasiness about the route. The
snake-like trail was continuous; and so plain that a child might
have followed it.</p>

<p>It did not run in a right line, but meandering among the
thickets; at times turning out of the way, in places where the
ground was clear of timber.  This had evidently been done with an
intent to avoid obstruction to the waggons: since at each of
these windings the travellers could perceive that there were
breaks, or other inequalities, in the surface.</p>

<p>"How very thoughtful of the young fellow!" remarked
Poindexter.  "I really feel regret at not having asked for his
name.  If he belong to the Fort, we shall see him again."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it," assented his son.  "I hope we shall."</p>

<p>His daughter, reclining in shadow, overheard the conjectural
speech, as well as the rejoinder.  She said nothing; but her
glance towards Henry seemed to declare that her heart fondly
echoed the hope.</p>

<p>Cheered by the prospect of soon terminating a toilsome
journey&mdash;as also by the pleasant anticipation of beholding,
before sunset, his new purchase&mdash;the planter was in one of
his happiest moods.  His aristocratic bosom was moved by an
unusual amount of condescension, to all around him.  He chatted
familiarly with his overseer; stopped to crack a joke with
"Uncle" Scipio, hobbling along on blistered heels; and encouraged
"Aunt" Chloe in the transport of her piccaninny.</p>

<p>"Marvellous!" might the observer exclaim&mdash;misled by such
exceptional interludes, so pathetically described by the
scribblers in Lucifer's pay&mdash;"what a fine patriarchal
institution is slavery, after all!  After all we have said and
done to abolish it!  A waste of sympathy&mdash;sheer
philanthropic folly to attempt the destruction of this ancient
edifice&mdash; worthy corner-stone to a 'chivalric' nation!  Oh,
ye abolition fanatics! why do ye clamour against it?  Know ye not
that some must suffer&mdash;must work and starve&mdash;that
others may enjoy the luxury of idleness?  That some must be
slaves, that others may be free?"</p>

<p>Such arguments&mdash;at which a world might weep&mdash;have
been of late but too often urged.  Woe to the man who speaks, and
the nation that gives ear to them!</p>

<p>The planter's high spirits were shared by his party, Calhoun
alone excepted.  They were reflected in the faces of his black
bondsmen, who regarded him as the source, and dispenser, of their
happiness, or misery&mdash;omnipotent&mdash;next to God.  They
loved him less than God, and feared him more; though he was by no
means a bad master&mdash;that is, <i>by comparison</i>.  He did
not absolutely take delight in torturing them.  He liked to see
them well fed and clad&mdash;their epidermis shining with the
exudation of its own oil.  These signs bespoke the importance of
their proprietor&mdash;himself.  He was satisfied to let them off
with an occasional "cow-hiding"&mdash;salutary, he would assure
you; and in all his "stock" there was not one black skin marked
with the mutilations of vengeance&mdash;a proud boast for a
Mississippian slave-owner, and more than most could truthfully
lay claim to.</p>

<p>In the presence of such an exemplary owner, no wonder that the
cheerfulness was universal&mdash;or that the slaves should
partake of their master's joy, and give way to their
garrulity.</p>

<p>It was not destined that this joyfulness should continue to
the end of their journey.  It was after a time
interrupted&mdash;not suddenly, nor by any fault on the part of
those indulging in it, but by causes and circumstances over which
they had not the slightest control.</p>

<p>As the stranger had predicted: the sun ceased to be visible,
before the cypress came in sight.</p>

<p>There was nothing in this to cause apprehension.  The line of
the lazo was conspicuous as ever; and they needed no guidance
from the sun: only that his cloud-eclipse produced a
corresponding effect upon their spirits.</p>

<p>"One might suppose it close upon nightfall," observed the
planter, drawing out his gold repeater, and glancing at its dial;
"and yet it's only three o'clock!  Lucky the young fellow has
left us such a sure guide.  But for him, we might have floundered
among these ashes till sundown; perhaps have been compelled to
sleep upon them."</p>

<p>"A black bed it would be," jokingly rejoined Henry, with the
design of rendering the conversation more cheerful.  "Ugh!  I
should have such ugly dreams, were I to sleep upon it."</p>

<p>"And I, too," added his sister, protruding her pretty face
through the curtains, and taking a survey of the surrounding
scene: "I'm sure I should dream of Tartarus, and Pluto, and
Proserpine, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hya! hya! hya!" grinned the black Jehu, on the
box&mdash;enrolled in the plantation books as <i>Pluto
Poindexter</i>&mdash;"De young missa dream 'bout <i>me</i> in de
mids' ob dis brack praira!  Golly! dat am a good
joke&mdash;berry! Hya! hya! hya!"</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure, all of ye," said the surly nephew, at this
moment coming up, and taking part in the
conversation&mdash;"don't be too sure that you won't have to make
your beds upon it yet.  I hope it may be no worse."</p>

<p>"What mean you, Cash?" inquired the uncle.</p>

<p>"I mean, uncle, that that fellow's been misleading us.  I
won't say it for certain; but it looks ugly.  We've come more
than five miles&mdash;six, I should say&mdash;and where's the
tree?  I've examined the horizon, with a pair of as good eyes as
most have got, I reckon; and there isn't such a thing in
sight."</p>

<p>"But why should the stranger have deceived us?"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;why?  That's just it.  There may be more reasons
than one."</p>

<p>"Give us one, then!" challenged a silvery voice from the
carriole. "We're all ears to hear it!"</p>

<p>"You're all ears to take in everything that's told you by a
stranger," sneeringly replied Calhoun.  "I suppose if I gave my
reason, you'd be so charitable as to call it a false alarm!"</p>

<p>"That depends on its character, Master Cassius.  I think you
might venture to try us.  We scarcely expect a false alarm from a
soldier, as well as traveller, of your experience."</p>

<p>Calhoun felt the taunt; and would probably have withheld the
communication he had intended to make, but for Poindexter
himself.</p>

<p>"Come, Cassius, explain yourself!" demanded the planter, in a
tone of respectful authority.  "You have said enough to excite
something more than curiosity.  For what reason should the young
fellow be leading us astray?"</p>

<p>"Well, uncle," answered the ex-officer, retreating a little
from his original accusation, "I haven't said for certain that he
<i>is</i>; only that it looks like it."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Well, one don't know what may happen.  Travelling parties as
strong, and stronger than we, have been attacked on these plains,
and plundered of every thing&mdash;murdered."</p>

<p>"Mercy!" exclaimed Louise, in a tone of terror, more affected
than real.</p>

<p>"By Indians," replied Poindexter.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;Indians, indeed!  Sometimes it may be; and
sometimes, too, they may be whites who play at that
game&mdash;not all Mexican whites, neither.  It only needs a bit
of brown paint; a horsehair wig, with half a dozen feathers stuck
into it; that, and plenty of hullabalooing.  If we were to be
robbed by a party of <i>white</i> Indians, it wouldn't be the
first time the thing's been done.  We as good as half deserve
it&mdash;for our greenness, in trusting too much to a
stranger."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, nephew! this is a serious accusation.  Do you
mean to say that the despatch-rider&mdash;if he be one&mdash;is
leading us into&mdash;into an ambuscade?"</p>

<p>"No, uncle; I don't say that.  I only say that such things
have been done; and it's possible he <i>may</i>."</p>

<p>"But not <i>probable</i>," emphatically interposed the voice
from the carriole, in a tone tauntingly quizzical.</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed the stripling Henry, who, although riding a
few paces ahead, had overheard the conversation.  "Your
suspicions are unjust, cousin Cassius.  I pronounce them a
calumny.  What's more, I can prove them so.  Look there!"</p>

<p>The youth had reined up his horse, and was pointing to an
object placed conspicuously by the side of the path; which,
before speaking, he had closely scrutinised.  It was a tall plant
of the <i>columnar cactus</i>, whose green succulent stem had
escaped scathing by the fire.</p>

<p>It was not to the plant itself that Henry Poindexter directed
the attention of his companions; but to a small white disc, of
the form of a parallelogram, impaled upon one of its spines.  No
one accustomed to the usages of civilised life could mistake the
"card."  It was one.</p>

<p>"Hear what's written upon it!" continued the young man, riding
nearer, and reading aloud the directions pencilled upon the bit
of pasteboard.</p>

<p>"The cypress in sight!"</p>

<p>"Where?" inquired Poindexter.</p>

<p>"There's a hand," rejoined Henry, "with a finger
pointing&mdash;no doubt in the direction of the tree."</p>

<p>All eyes were instantly turned towards the quarter of the
compass, indicated by the cipher on the card.</p>

<p>Had the sun been shining, the cypress might have been seen at
the first glance.  As it was, the sky&mdash;late of cerulean
hue&mdash;was now of a leaden grey; and no straining of the eyes
could detect anything along the horizon resembling the top of a
tree.</p>

<p>"There's nothing of the kind," asserted Calhoun, with restored
confidence, at the same time returning to his unworthy
accusation. "It's only a dodge&mdash;another link in the chain of
tricks the scamp is playing us."</p>

<p>"You mistake, cousin Cassius," replied that same voice that
had so often contradicted him.  "Look through this lorgnette!  If
you haven't lost the sight of those superior eyes of yours,
you'll see something <i>very like a tree</i>&mdash;a tall
tree&mdash;and a cypress, too, if ever there was one in the
swamps of Louisiana."</p>

<p>Calhoun disdained to take the opera glass from the hands of
his cousin. He knew it would convict him: for he could not
suppose she was telling an untruth.</p>

<p>Poindexter availed himself of its aid; and, adjusting the
focus to his failing sight, was enabled to distinguish the
red-leafed cypress, topping up over the edge of the prairie.</p>

<p>"It's true," he said: "the tree is there.  The young fellow is
honest: you've been wronging him, Cash.  I didn't think it likely
he should have taken such a queer plan to make fools of us.  He
there!  Mr Sansom! Direct your teamsters to drive on!"</p>

<p>Calhoun, not caring to continue the conversation, nor yet
remain longer in company, spitefully spurred his horse, and
trotted off over the prairie.</p>

<p>"Let me look at that card, Henry?" said Louise, speaking to
her brother in a restrained voice.  "I'm curious to see the
cipher that has been of such service to us.  Bring it away,
brother: it can be of no further use where it is&mdash;now that
we have sighted the tree."</p>

<p>Henry, without the slightest suspicion of his sister's motive
for making the request, yielded obedience to it.</p>

<p>Releasing the piece of pasteboard from its impalement, he
"chucked" it into her lap.</p>

<p>"<i>Maurice Gerald</i>!" muttered the young Creole, after
deciphering the name upon the card.  "Maurice Gerald!" she
repeated, in apostrophic thought, as she deposited the piece of
pasteboard in her bosom. "Whoever you are&mdash;whence you have
come&mdash;whither you are going&mdash;what you may
be&mdash;<i>Henceforth there is a fate between us</i>!  I feel
it&mdash;I know it&mdash; sure as there's a sky above!  Oh! how
that sky lowers!  Am I to take it as a type of this still
untraced destiny?"</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER FOUR.<br>

THE BLACK NORTHER.</h2>

<p class="first">
FOR some seconds, after surrendering herself to the Sybilline
thoughts thus expressed, the young lady sate in silence&mdash;her
white hands clasped across her temples, as if her whole soul was
absorbed in an attempt, either to explain the past, or penetrate
the future.</p>

<p>Her reverie&mdash;whatever might be its cause&mdash;was not of
long duration.  She was awakened from it, on hearing exclamations
without&mdash;mingled with words that declared some object of
apprehension.</p>

<p>She recognised her brother's voice, speaking in tones that
betokened alarm.</p>

<p>"Look, father! don't you see them?"</p>

<p>"Where, Henry&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>"Yonder&mdash;behind the waggons.  You see them now?"</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;though I can't say what they are.  They look
like&mdash;like&mdash;" Poindexter was puzzled for a
simile&mdash;"I really don't know what."</p>

<p>"Waterspouts?" suggested the ex-captain, who, at sight of the
strange objects, had condescended to rejoin the party around the
carriole. "Surely it can't be that?  It's too far from the sea. I
never heard of their occurring on the prairies."</p>

<p>"They are in motion, whatever they be," said Henry.  "See!
they keep closing, and then going apart.  But for that, one might
mistake them for huge obelisks of black marble!"</p>

<p>"Giants, or ghouls!" jokingly suggested Calhoun; "ogres from
some other world, who've taken a fancy to have a promenade on
this abominable prairie!"</p>

<p>The ex-officer was only humorous with an effort.  As well as
the others, he was under the influence of an uneasy feeling.</p>

<p>And no wonder.  Against the northern horizon had suddenly
become upreared a number of ink-coloured columns&mdash;half a
score of them&mdash;unlike anything ever seen before.  They were
not of regular columnar form, nor fixed in any way; but
constantly changing size, shape, and place&mdash;now steadfast
for a time&mdash;now gliding over the charred surface like giants
upon skates&mdash;anon, bending and balancing towards one another
in the most fantastic figurings!</p>

<p>It required no great effort of imagination, to fancy the
Titans of old, resuscitated on the prairies of Texas, leading a
measure after some wild carousal in the company of Bacchus!</p>

<p>In the proximity of phenomena never observed
before&mdash;unearthly in their aspect&mdash;unknown to every
individual of the party&mdash;it was but natural these should be
inspired with alarm.</p>

<p>And such was the fact.  A sense of danger pervaded every
bosom.  All were impressed with a belief: that they were in the
presence of some <i>peril of the prairies</i>.</p>

<p>A general halt had been made on first observing the strange
objects: the negroes on foot, as well as the teamsters, giving
utterance to shouts of terror.  The animals&mdash;mules as well
as horses, had come instinctively to a stand&mdash;the latter
neighing and trembling&mdash;the former filling the air with
their shrill screams.</p>

<p>These were not the only sounds.  From the sable towers could
be heard a hoarse swishing noise, that resembled the sough of a
waterfall&mdash;at intervals breaking into reverberations like
the roll of musketry, or the detonations of distant thunder!</p>

<p>These noises were gradually growing louder and more distinct.
The danger, whatever it might be, was drawing nearer!</p>

<p>Consternation became depicted on the countenances of the
travellers, Calhoun's forming no exception.  The ex-officer no
longer pretended levity.  The eyes of all were turned towards the
lowering sky, and the band of black columns that appeared coming
on to crush them!</p>

<p>At this crisis a shout, reaching their ears from the opposite
side, was a source of relief&mdash;despite the unmistakable
accent of alarm in which it was uttered.</p>

<p>Turning, they beheld a horseman in full gallop&mdash;riding
direct towards them.</p>

<p>The horse was black as coal: the rider of like hue, even to
the skin of his face.  For all that he was recognised: as the
stranger, upon the trail of whose lazo they had been
travelling.</p>

<p>The perceptions of woman are quicker than those of man: the
young lady within the carriole was the first to identify him.
"Onward!" he cried, as soon as within speaking distance.
"On&mdash;on! as fast as you can drive!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded the planter, in bewildered alarm.  "Is
there a danger?"</p>

<p>"There is.  I did not anticipate it, as I passed you.  It was
only after reaching the river, I saw the sure signs of it."</p>

<p>"Of what, sir?"</p>

<p>"The <i>norther</i>."</p>

<p>"You mean the storm of that name?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"I never heard of its being dangerous," interposed Calhoun,
"except to vessels at sea.  It's precious cold, I know;
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll find it worse than cold, sir," interrupted the young
horseman, "if you're not quick in getting out of its way.  Mr
Poindexter," he continued, turning to the planter, and speaking
with impatient emphasis, "I tell you, that you and your party are
in peril.  A norther is not always to be dreaded; but this
one&mdash;look yonder!  You see those black pillars?"</p>

<p>"We've been wondering&mdash;didn't know what to make of
them."</p>

<p>"They're nothing&mdash;only the precursors of the storm.  Look
beyond!  Don't you see a coal-black cloud spreading over the sky?
That's what you have to dread.  I don't wish to cause you
unnecessary alarm: but I tell you, there's death in yonder
shadow!  It's in motion, and coming this way. You have no chance
to escape it, except by speed.  If you do not make haste, it will
be too late.  In ten minutes' time you may be enveloped, and
then&mdash;quick, sir, I entreat you!  Order your drivers to
hurry forward as fast as they can!  The sky&mdash;heaven
itself&mdash;commands you!"</p>

<p>The planter did not think of refusing compliance, with an
appeal urged in such energetic terms.  The order was given for
the teams to be set in motion, and driven at top speed.</p>

<p>Terror, that inspired the animals equally with their drivers,
rendered superfluous the use of the whip.</p>

<p>The travelling carriage, with the mounted men, moved in front,
as before.  The stranger alone threw himself in the rear&mdash;as
if to act as a guard against the threatening danger.</p>

<p>At intervals he was observed to rein up his horse, and look
back: each time by his glances betraying increased
apprehension.</p>

<p>Perceiving it, the planter approached, and accosted him with
the inquiry:</p>

<p>"Is there still a danger?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to answer you in the affirmative," said he: "I had
hopes that the wind might be the other way."</p>

<p>"Wind, sir?  There is none&mdash;that I can perceive."</p>

<p>"Not here.  Yonder it is blowing a hurricane, and this way
too&mdash;direct. By heavens! it is nearing us rapidly!  I doubt
if we shall be able to clear the burnt track."</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" exclaimed the planter, terrified by the
announcement.</p>

<p>"Are your mules doing their best?"</p>

<p>"They are: they could not be driven faster."</p>

<p>"I fear we shall <i>be too late, then</i>!"</p>

<p>As the speaker gave utterance to this gloomy conjecture, he
reined round once more; and sate regarding the cloud
columns&mdash;as if calculating the rate at which they were
advancing.</p>

<p>The lines, contracting around his lips, told of something more
than dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"Yes: too late!" he exclaimed, suddenly terminating his
scrutiny.  "They are moving faster than we&mdash;far faster.
There is no hope of our escaping them!"</p>

<p>"Good God, sir! is the danger so great?  Can we do nothing to
avoid it?"</p>

<p>The stranger did not make immediate reply.  For some seconds
he remained silent, as if reflecting&mdash;his glance no longer
turned towards the sky, but wandering among the waggons.</p>

<p>"Is there no chance of escape?" urged the planter, with the
impatience of a man in presence of a great peril.</p>

<p>"There is!" joyfully responded the horseman, as if some
hopeful thought had at length suggested itself.  "There <i>is a
chance</i>.  I did not think of it before.  We cannot shun the
storm&mdash;the danger we may.  Quick, Mr Poindexter!  Order your
men to muffle the mules&mdash;the horses too&mdash; otherwise the
animals will be blinded, and go mad. Blankets&mdash;cloaks&mdash;
anything will do.  When that's done, let all seek shelter within
the waggons.  Let the tilts be closed at the ends.  I shall
myself look to the travelling carriage."</p>

<p>Having delivered this chapter of instructions&mdash;which
Poindexter, assisted by the overseer, hastened to direct the
execution of&mdash;the young horseman galloped towards the
front.</p>

<p>"Madame!" said he, reining up alongside the carriole, and
speaking with as much suavity as the circumstances would admit
of, "you must close the curtains all round.  Your coachman will
have to get inside; and you, gentlemen!" he continued, addressing
himself to Henry and Calhoun&mdash;"and you, sir;" to Poindexter,
who had just come up.  "There will be room for all.  Inside, I
beseech you!  Lose no time.  In a few seconds the storm will be
upon us!"</p>

<p>"And you, sir?" inquired the planter, with a show of interest
in the man who was making such exertions to secure them against
some yet unascertained danger.  "What of yourself?"</p>

<p>"Don't waste a moment upon me.  I know what's coming.  It
isn't the first time I have encountered it.  In&mdash;in, I
entreat you!  You haven't a second to spare.  Listen to that
shriek!  Quick, or the dust-cloud will be around us!"</p>

<p>The planter and his son sprang together to the ground; and
retreated into the travelling carriage.</p>

<p>Calhoun, refusing to dismount, remained stiffly seated in his
saddle. Why should <i>he</i> skulk from a visionary danger, that
did not deter a man in Mexican garb?</p>

<p>The latter turned away; as he did so, directing the overseer
to get inside the nearest waggon&mdash;a direction which was
obeyed with alacrity&mdash; and, for the first time, the stranger
was left free to take care of himself.</p>

<p>Quickly unfolding his <i>serape</i>&mdash;hitherto strapped
across the cantle of his saddle&mdash;he flung it over the head
of his horse.  Then, drawing the edges back, he fastened it,
bag-fashion, around the animal's neck.  With equal alertness he
undid his scarf of China crape; and stretched it around his
sombrero&mdash;fixing it in such a way, that one edge was held
under the bullion band, while the other dropped down over the
brim&mdash;thus forming a silken visor for his face.</p>

<p>Before finally closing it, he turned once more towards the
carriole; and, to his surprise, saw Calhoun still in the saddle.
Humanity triumphed over a feeling of incipient aversion.</p>

<p>"Once again, sir, I adjure you to get inside!  If you do not
you'll have cause to repent it.  Within ten minutes' time, you
may be a dead man!"</p>

<p>The positive emphasis with which the caution was delivered
produced its effect.  In the presence of mortal foeman, Cassius
Calhoun was no coward.  But there was an enemy approaching that
was not mortal&mdash;not in any way understood.  It was already
making itself manifest, in tones that resembled thunder&mdash;in
shadows that mocked the darkness of midnight. Who would not have
felt fear at the approach of a destroyer so declaring itself?</p>

<p>The ex-officer was unable to resist the united warnings of
earth and heaven; and, slipping out of his saddle with a show of
reluctance&mdash; intended to save appearances&mdash;he clambered
into the carriage, and ensconced himself behind the closely-drawn
curtains.</p>

<p>To describe what followed is beyond the power of the pen.  No
eye beheld the spectacle: for none dared look upon it.  Even had
this been possible, nothing could have been seen.  In five
minutes after the muffling of the mules, the train was enveloped
in worse than Cimmerian darkness.</p>

<p>The opening scene can alone be depicted: for that only was
observed by the travellers.  One of the sable columns, moving in
the advance, broke as it came in collision with the waggon-tilts.
Down came a shower of black dust, as if the sky had commenced
raining gunpowder!  It was a foretaste of what was to follow.</p>

<p>There was a short interval of open atmosphere&mdash;hot as the
inside of an oven.  Then succeeded puffs, and whirling gusts, of
wind&mdash;cold as if projected from caves of ice, and
accompanied by a noise as though all the trumpets of Aeolus were
announcing the advent of the Storm-King!</p>

<p>In another instant the <i>norther</i> was around them; and the
waggon train, halted on a subtropical plain, was enveloped in an
atmosphere, akin to that which congeals the icebergs of the
Arctic Ocean!</p>

<p>Nothing more was seen&mdash;nothing heard, save the whistling
of the wind, or its hoarse roaring, as it thundered against the
tilts of the waggons. The mules having instinctively turned stern
towards it, stood silent in their traces; and the voices of the
travellers, in solemn converse inside, could not be distinguished
amid the howling of the hurricane.</p>

<p>Every aperture had been closed: for it was soon discovered,
that to show a face from under the sheltering canvas was to court
suffocation.  The air was surcharged with ashes, lifted aloft
from the burnt plain, and reduced, by the whirling of the wind,
to an impalpable but poisonous powder.</p>

<p>For over an hour did the atmosphere carry this cinereous
cloud; during which period lasted the imprisonment of the
travellers.</p>

<p>At length a voice, speaking close by the curtains of the
carriole, announced their release.</p>

<p>"You can come forth!" said the stranger, the crape scarf
thrown back above the brim of his hat.  "You will still have the
storm to contend against.  It will last to the end of your
journey; and, perhaps, for three days longer.  But you have
nothing further to fear.  The ashes are all swept off.  They've
gone before you; and you're not likely to overtake them this side
the Rio Grande."</p>

<p>"Sir!" said the planter, hastily descending the steps of the
carriage, "we have to thank you for&mdash;for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Our lives, father!" cried Henry, supplying the proper words.
"I hope, sir, you will favour us with your name?"</p>

<p>"<i>Maurice Gerald</i>!" returned the stranger; "though, at
the Fort, you will find me better known as <i>Maurice the
mustanger</i>."</p>

<p>"A mustanger!" scornfully muttered Calhoun, but only loud
enough to be heard by Louise.</p>

<p>"Only a mustanger!" reflected the aristocratic Poindexter, the
fervour of his gratitude becoming sensibly chilled.</p>

<p>"For guide, you will no longer need either myself, or my
lazo," said the hunter of wild horses.  "The cypress is in sight:
keep straight towards it.  After crossing, you will see the flag
over the Fort.  You may yet reach your journey's end before
night.  I have no time to tarry; and must say adieu."</p>

<p>Satan himself, astride a Tartarean steed, could not have
looked more like the devil than did Maurice the Mustanger, as he
separated for the second time from the planter and his party. But
neither his ashy envelope, nor the announcement of his humble
calling, did aught to damage him in the estimation of one, whose
thoughts were already predisposed in his favour&mdash;Louise
Poindexter.</p>

<p>On hearing him declare his name&mdash;by presumption already
known to her&mdash; she but more tenderly cherished the bit of
cardboard, chafing against her snow-white bosom; at the same time
muttering in soft pensive soliloquy, heard only by
herself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Maurice the mustanger! despite your sooty
covering&mdash;despite your modest pretence&mdash;you have
touched the heart of a Creole maiden.  <i>Mon
Dieu</i>&mdash;<i>mon Dieu!  He is too like Lucifer for me to
despise him</i>!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER FIVE.<br>

THE HOME OF THE HORSE-HUNTER.</h2>

<p class="first">
WHERE the <i>Rio de Nueces</i> (River of Nuts) collects its
waters from a hundred tributary streams&mdash;lining the map like
the limbs of a grand genealogical tree&mdash;you may look upon a
land of surpassing fairness.  Its surface is "rolling prairie,"
interspersed with clumps of post-oak and pecan, here and there
along the banks of the watercourses uniting into continuous
groves.</p>

<p>In some places these timbered tracts assume the aspect of the
true <i>chapparal</i>&mdash;a thicket, rather than a
forest&mdash;its principal growth being various kinds of acacia,
associated with copaiva and creosote trees, with wild aloes, with
eccentric shapes of cereus, cactus, and arborescent yucca.</p>

<p>These spinous forms of vegetation, though repulsive to the eye
of the agriculturist&mdash;as proving the utter sterility of the
soil&mdash;present an attractive aspect to the botanist, or the
lover of Nature; especially when the cereus unfolds its huge
wax-like blossoms, or the <i>Fouquiera splendens</i> overtops the
surrounding shrubbery with its spike of resplendent flowers, like
a red flag hanging unfolded along its staff.</p>

<p>The whole region, however, is not of this character.  There
are stretches of greater fertility; where a black calcareous
earth gives nourishment to trees of taller growth, and more
luxuriant foliage.  The "wild China"&mdash;a true
<i>sapindal</i>&mdash;the pecan, the elm, the hackberry, and the
oak of several species&mdash;with here and there a cypress or
Cottonwood&mdash;form the components of many a sylvan scene,
which, from the blending of their leaves of various shades of
green, and the ever changing contour of their clumps, deserves to
be denominated fair.</p>

<p>The streams of this region are of crystal purity&mdash;their
waters tinted only by the reflection of sapphire skies.  Its sun,
moon, and stars are scarcely ever concealed behind a cloud.  The
demon of disease has not found his way into this salubrious spot:
no epidemic can dwell within its borders.</p>

<p>Despite these advantages, civilised man has not yet made it
his home. Its paths are trodden only by the red-skinned rovers of
the prairie&mdash; Lipano or Comanche&mdash;and these only when
mounted, and upon the <i>maraud</i> towards the settlements of
the Lower Nueces, or Leona.</p>

<p>It may be on this account&mdash;though it would almost seem as
if they were actuated by a love of the beautiful and
picturesque&mdash;that the true children of Nature, the wild
animals, have selected this spot as their favourite habitat and
home.  In no part of Texas does the stag bound up so often before
you; and nowhere is the timid antelope so frequently seen.  The
rabbit, and his gigantic cousin, the mule-rabbit, are scarcely
ever out of sight; while the polecat, the opossum, and the
curious peccary, are encountered at frequent intervals.</p>

<p>Birds, too, of beautiful forms and colours, enliven the
landscape.  The quail whirrs up from the path; the king vulture
wheels in the ambient air; the wild turkey, of gigantic stature,
suns his resplendent gorget by the side of the pecan copse, and
the singular tailor-bird&mdash;known among the rude Rangers as
the "bird of paradise"&mdash;flouts his long scissors-like tail
among the feathery fronds of the acacia.</p>

<p>Beautiful butterflies spread their wide wings in flapping
flight; or, perched upon some gay corolla, look as if they formed
part of the flower.  Huge bees (<i>Meliponae</i>), clad in velvet
liveries, buzz amid the blossoming bushes, disputing possession
with hawkmoths and humming-birds not much larger than
themselves.</p>

<p>They are not all innocent, the denizens of this lovely land.
Here the rattlesnake attains to larger dimensions than in any
other part of North America, and shares the covert with the more
dangerous <i>moccasin</i>. Here, too, the tarantula inflicts its
venomous sting; the scorpion poisons with its bite; and the
centipede, by simply crawling over the skin, causes a fever that
may prove fatal!</p>

<p>Along the wooded banks of the streams may be encountered the
spotted ocelot, the puma, and their more powerful congener, the
jaguar; the last of these <i>felidae</i> being here upon the
northern limit of its geographical range.</p>

<p>Along the edges of the chapparal skulks the gaunt Texan
wolf&mdash;solitarily and in silence; while a kindred and more
cowardly species, the <i>coyote</i>, may be observed, far out
upon the open plain, hunting in packs.</p>

<p>Sharing the same range with these, the most truculent of
quadrupeds, may be seen the noblest and most beautiful of
animals&mdash;perhaps nobler and more beautiful than
man&mdash;certainly the most distinguished of man's
companions&mdash;the horse!</p>

<p>Here&mdash;independent of man's caprice, his jaw unchecked by
bit or curb, his back unscathed by pack or saddle&mdash;he roams
unrestrained; giving way to all the wildness of his nature.</p>

<p>But even in this, his favourite haunt, he is not always left
alone.  Man presumes to be his pursuer and tamer: for here was he
sought, captured, and conquered, by <i>Maurice the
Mustanger</i>.</p>

<p>On the banks of the <i>Alamo</i>&mdash;one of the most
sparkling streamlets that pay tribute to the Nueces&mdash;stood a
dwelling, unpretentious as any to be found within the limits of
Texas, and certainly as picturesque.</p>

<p>Its walls were composed of split trunk of the arborescent
yucca, set stockade-fashion in the ground; while its roof was a
thatch furnished by the long bayonet-shaped loaves of the same
gigantic lily.</p>

<p>The interstices between the uprights, instead of being
"chinked" with clay&mdash;as is common in the cabins of Western
Texas&mdash;were covered by a sheeting of horse-skins; attached,
not by iron tacks, but with the sharp spines that terminate the
leaves of the <i>pita</i> plant.</p>

<p>On the bluffs, that on both sides overlooked the
rivulet&mdash;and which were but the termination of the
escarpment of the higher plain&mdash;grew in abundance the
material out of which the hut had been constructed: tree yuccas
and <i>magueys</i>, amidst other rugged types of sterile
vegetation; whereas the fertile valley below was covered with a
growth of heavy timber&mdash;consisting chiefly of red-mulberry,
post-oak, and pecan, that formed a forest of several leagues in
length.  The timbered tract was, in fact, conterminous with the
bottom lands; the tops of the trees scarce rising to a level with
the escarpment of the cliff.</p>

<p>It was not continuous.  Along the edge of the streamlet were
breaks&mdash; forming little meads, or savannahs, covered with
that most nutritious of grasses, known among Mexicans as
<i>grama</i>.</p>

<p>In the concavity of one of these, of semicircular
shape&mdash;which served as a natural lawn&mdash;stood the
primitive dwelling above described; the streamlet representing
the chord; while the curve was traced by the trunks of the trees,
that resembled a series of columns supporting the roof of some
sylvan coliseum.</p>

<p>The structure was in shadow, a little retired among the trees;
as if the site had been chosen with a view to concealment.  It
could have been seen but by one passing along the bank of the
stream; and then only with the observer directly in front of it.
Its rude style of architecture, and russet hue, contributed still
further to its <i>inconspicuousness</i>.</p>

<p>The house was a mere cabin&mdash;not larger than a marquee
tent&mdash;with only a single aperture, the door&mdash;if we
except the flue of a slender clay chimney, erected at one end
against the upright posts.  The doorway had a door, a light
framework of wood, with a horse-skin stretched over it, and hung
upon hinges cut from the same hide.</p>

<p>In the rear was an open shed, thatched with yucca leaves, and
supported by half a dozen posts.  Around this was a small
enclosure, obtained by tying cross poles to the trunks of the
adjacent trees.</p>

<p>A still more extensive enclosure, containing within its
circumference more than an acre of the timbered tract, and fenced
in a similar manner, extended rearward from the cabin,
terminating against the bluff.  Its turf tracked and torn by
numerous hoof-prints&mdash;in some places trampled into a hard
surface&mdash;told of its use: a "corral" for wild
horses&mdash;<i>mustangs</i>.</p>

<p>This was made still more manifest by the presence of a dozen
or more of these animals within the enclosure; whose glaring
eyeballs, and excited actions, gave evidence of their recent
capture, and how ill they brooked the imprisonment of that
shadowy paddock.</p>

<p>The interior of the hut was not without some show of neatness
and comfort.  The sheeting of mustang-skins that covered the
walls, with the hairy side turned inward, presented no mean
appearance.  The smooth shining coats of all colours&mdash;black,
bay, snow-white, sorrel, and skewbald&mdash;offered to the eye a
surface pleasantly variegated; and there had evidently been some
taste displayed in their arrangement.</p>

<p>The furniture was of the scantiest kind.  It consisted of a
counterfeit camp bedstead, formed by stretching a horse-hide over
a framework of trestles; a couple of stools&mdash;diminutive
specimens on the same model; and a rude table, shaped out of hewn
slabs of the yucca-tree.  Something like a second sleeping place
appeared in a remote corner&mdash;a "shakedown," or "spread," of
the universal mustang-skin.</p>

<p>What was least to be expected in such a place, was a shelf
containing about a score of books, with pens, ink, and
<i>papeterie</i>; also a newspaper lying upon the slab table.</p>

<p>Further proofs of civilisation, if not refinement, presented
themselves in the shape of a large leathern portmanteau, a
double-barrelled gun, with "Westley Richards" upon the breech; a
drinking cup of chased silver, a huntsman's horn, and a
dog-call.</p>

<p>Upon the floor were a few culinary utensils, mostly of tin;
while in one corner stood a demijohn, covered with wicker, and
evidently containing something stronger than the water of the
Alamo.</p>

<p>Other "chattels" in the cabin were perhaps more in keeping
with the place.  There was a high-peaked Mexican saddle; a
bridle, with headstall of plaited horsehair, and reins to
correspond; two or three spare <i>serapes</i>, and some odds and
ends of raw-hide rope.</p>

<p>Such was the structure of the mustanger's dwelling&mdash;such
its surroundings&mdash;such its interior and contents, with the
exception of its living occupants&mdash;two in number.</p>

<p>On one of the stools standing in the centre of the floor was
seated a man, who could not be the mustanger himself.  In no way
did he present the semblance of a proprietor.  On the contrary,
the air of the servitor&mdash;the mien of habitual
obedience&mdash;was impressed upon him beyond the chance of
misconstruction.</p>

<p>Rude as was the cabin that sheltered him, no one entering
under its roof would have mistaken him for its master.</p>

<p>Not that he appeared ill clad or fed, or in any way stinted in
his requirements.  He was a round plump specimen, with a shock of
carrot-coloured hair and a bright ruddy skin, habited in a suit
of stout stuff&mdash;half corduroy, half cotton-velvet.  The
corduroy was in the shape of a pair of knee-breeches, with
gaiters to correspond; the velveteen, once bottle green, now
faded to a brownish hue, exhibited itself in a sort of shooting
coat, with ample pockets in the breast and skirts.</p>

<p>A "wide-awake" hat, cocked over a pair of eyes equally
deserving the appellation, completed the costume of the
individual in question&mdash;if we except a shirt of coarse
calico, a red cotton kerchief loosely knotted around his neck,
and a pair of Irish <i>brogues</i> upon his feet.</p>

<p>It needed neither the brogues, nor the corduroy breeches, to
proclaim his nationality.  His lips, nose, eyes, air, and
attitude, were all unmistakably Milesian.</p>

<p>Had there been any ambiguity about this, it would have been
dispelled as he opened his mouth for the emission of speech; and
this he at intervals did, in an accent that could only have been
acquired in the shire of Galway.  As he was the sole human
occupant of the cabin, it might be supposed that he spoke only in
soliloquy.  Not so, however.  Couched upon a piece of horse-skin,
in front of the fire, with snout half buried among the ashes, was
a canine companion, whose appearance bespoke a countryman&mdash;a
huge Irish staghound, that looked as if he too understood the
speech of Connemara.</p>

<p>Whether he did so or not, it was addressed to him, as if he
was expected to comprehend every word.</p>

<p>"Och, Tara, me jewel!" exclaimed he in the corduroys,
fraternally interrogating the hound; "hadn't yez weesh now to be
back in Ballyballagh?  Wadn't yez loike to be wance more in the
coortyard av the owld castle, friskin' over the clane stones, an
bein' tripe-fed till there wasn't a rib to be seen in your
sides&mdash;so different from what they are now&mdash;when I kyan
count ivery wan av them?  Sowl! it's meself that ud loike to be
there, anyhow!  But there's no knowin' when the young masther 'll
go back, an take us along wid him.  Niver mind, Tara!  He's goin'
to the Sittlements soon, ye owld dog; an he's promised to take us
thare; that's some consolashun.  Be japers! it's over three
months since I've been to the Fort, meself.  Maybe I'll find some
owld acquaintance among them Irish sodgers that's come lately; an
be me sowl, av I do, won't there be a dhrap betwane
us&mdash;won't there, Tara?"</p>

<p>The staghound, raising his head at hearing the mention of his
name, gave a slight sniff, as if saying "Yes" in answer to the
droll interrogatory.</p>

<p>"I'd like a dhrap now," continued the speaker, casting a
covetous glance towards the wickered jar; "mightily I wud that
same; but the dimmyjan is too near bein' empty, an the young
masther might miss it.  Besides, it wudn't be raal honest av me
to take it widout lave&mdash;wud it, Tara?"</p>

<p>The dog again raised his head above the ashes, and sneezed as
before.</p>

<p>"Why, that was <i>yis</i>, the last time ye spoke!  Div yez
mane is for the same now?  Till me, Tara!"</p>

<p>Once more the hound gave utterance to the sound&mdash;that
appeared to be caused either by a slight touch of influenza, or
the ashes having entered his nostrils.</p>

<p>"'Yis' again?  In trath that's just fwhat the dumb crayther
manes! Don't timpt me, ye owld thief!  No&mdash;no; I won't touch
the whisky.  I'll only draw the cork out av the dimmyjan, an take
a smell at it.  Shure the masther won't know anything about that;
an if he did, he wudn't mind it!  Smellin' kyant do the pothyeen
any harm."</p>

<p>During the concluding portion of this utterance, the speaker
had forsaken his seat, and approached the corner where stood the
jar.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the professed innocence of his intent, there
was a stealthiness about his movements, that seemed to argue
either a want of confidence in his own integrity, or in his power
to resist temptation.</p>

<p>He stood for a short while listening&mdash;his eyes turned
towards the open doorway; and then, taking up the demijohn, he
drew out the stopper, and held the neck to his nose.</p>

<p>For some seconds he remained in this attitude: giving out no
other sign than an occasional "sniff," similar to that uttered by
the hound, and which he had been fain to interpret as an
affirmative answer to his interrogatory.  It expressed the
enjoyment he was deriving from the <i>bouquet</i> of the potent
spirit.</p>

<p>But this only satisfied him for a very short time; and
gradually the bottom of the jar was seen going upwards, while the
reverse end descended in like ratio in the direction of his
protruding lips.</p>

<p>"Be japers!" he exclaimed, once more glancing stealthily
towards the door, "flesh and blood cudn't stand the smell av that
bewtiful whisky, widout tastin' it.  Trath!  I'll chance
it&mdash;jist the smallest thrifle to wet the tap av my tongue.
Maybe it'll burn the skin av it; but no matther&mdash;here
goes!"</p>

<p>Without further ado the neck of the demijohn was brought in
contact with his lips; but instead of the "smallest thrifle" to
wet the top of his tongue, the "gluck&mdash;gluck" of the
escaping fluid told that he was administering a copious
saturation to the whole lining of his larynx, and something
more.</p>

<p>After half a dozen "smacks" of the mouth, with other
exclamations denoting supreme satisfaction, he hastily restored
the stopper; returned the demijohn to its place; and glided back
to his seat upon the stool.</p>

<p>"Tara, ye owld thief!" said he, addressing himself once more
to his canine companion, "it was you that timpted me!  No
matther, man: the masther 'll niver miss it; besides, he's goin'
soon to the Fort, an can lay in a fresh supply."</p>

<p>For a time the pilferer remained silent; either reflecting on
the act he had committed, or enjoying the effects which the
"potheen" had produced upon his spirits.</p>

<p>His silence was of short duration; and was terminated by a
soliloquy.</p>

<p>"I wondher," muttered he, "fwhat makes Masther Maurice so
anxious to get back to the Sittlements.  He says he'll go
wheniver he catches that spotty mustang he has seen lately. Sowl!
isn't he bad afther that baste!  I suppose it must be somethin'
beyant the common&mdash;the more be token, as he has chased the
crayther three times widout bein' able to throw his rope over
it&mdash;an mounted on the blood-bay, too.  He sez he won't give
it up, till he gets howlt of it.  Trath!  I hope it'll be grupped
soon, or wez may stay here till the marnin' av doomsday.  Hush!
fwhat's that?"</p>

<p>Tara springing up from his couch of skin, and rushing out with
a low growl, had caused the exclamation.</p>

<p>"Phelim!" hailed a voice from the outside.  "Phelim!"</p>

<p>"It's the masther," muttered Phelim, as he jumped from his
stool, and followed the dog through the doorway.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER SIX.<br>

THE SPOTTED MUSTANG.</h2>

<p class="first">
PHELIM was not mistaken as to the voice that had hailed him.
It was that of his master, Maurice Gerald.</p>

<p>On getting outside, he saw the mustanger at a short distance
from the door, and advancing towards it.</p>

<p>As the servant should have expected, his master was mounted
upon his horse&mdash;no longer of a reddish colour, but appearing
almost black.  The animal's coat was darkened with sweat; its
counter and flanks speckled with foam.</p>

<p>The blood-bay was not alone.  At the end of the
lazo&mdash;drawn taut from the saddle tree&mdash;was a companion,
or, to speak more accurately, a captive.  With a leathern thong
looped around its under jaw, and firmly embracing the bars of its
mouth, kept in place by another passing over its neck immediately
behind the ears, was the captive secured.</p>

<p>It was a mustang of peculiar appearance, as regarded its
markings; which were of a kind rarely seen&mdash;even among the
largest "gangs" that roam over the prairie pastures, where
colours of the most eccentric patterns are not uncommon.</p>

<p>That of the animal in question was a ground of dark chocolate
in places approaching to black&mdash;with white spots distributed
over it, as regularly as the contrary colours upon the skin of
the jaguar.</p>

<p>As if to give effect to this pleasing arrangement of hues, the
creature was of perfect shape&mdash;broad chested, full in the
flank, and clean limbed&mdash;with a hoof showing half a score of
concentric rings, and a head that might have been taken as a type
of equine beauty.  It was of large size for a mustang, though
much smaller than the ordinary English horse; even smaller than
the blood-bay&mdash;himself a mustang&mdash;that had assisted in
its capture.</p>

<p>The beautiful captive was a mare&mdash;one of a <i>manada</i>
that frequented the plains near the source of the Alamo; and
where, for the third time, the mustanger had unsuccessfully
chased it.</p>

<p>In his case the proverb had proved untrue.  In the third time
he had not found the "charm"; though it favoured him in the
fourth.  By the fascination of a long rope, with a running noose
at its end, he had secured the creature that, for some reason
known only to himself, he so ardently wished to possess.</p>

<p>Phelim had never seen his master return from a horse-hunting
excursion in such a state of excitement; even when coming
back&mdash;as he often did&mdash; with half a dozen mustangs led
loosely at the end of his lazo.</p>

<p>But never before at the end of that implement had Phelim
beheld such a beauty as the spotted mare.  She was a thing to
excite the admiration of one less a connoisseur in horse-flesh
than the <i>ci-devant</i> stable-boy of Castle Ballagh.</p>

<p>"Hooch&mdash;hoop&mdash;hoora!" cried he, as he set eyes upon
the captive, at the same time tossing his hat high into the air.
"Thanks to the Howly Vargin, an Saint Pathrick to boot, Masther
Maurice, yez have cotched the spotty at last!  It's a mare, be
japers!  Och! the purthy crayther!  I don't wondher yez hiv been
so bad about gettin' howlt av her.  Sowl! if yez had her in
Ballinasloe Fair, yez might ask your own price, and get it too,
widout givin' sixpence av luckpenny.  Oh! the purty crayther!
Where will yez hiv her phut, masther?  Into the corral, wid the
others?"</p>

<p>"No, she might get kicked among them.  We shall tie her in the
shed. Castro must pass his night outside among the trees.  If
he's got any gallantry in him he won't mind that.  Did you ever
see anything so beautiful as she is, Phelim&mdash;I mean in the
way of horseflesh?"</p>

<p>"Niver, Masther Maurice; niver, in all me life!  An' I've seen
some nice bits av blood about Ballyballagh.  Oh, the purty
crayther! she looks as if a body cud ate her; and yit, in trath,
she looks like she wud ate you.  Yez haven't given her the
schoolin' lesson, have yez?"</p>

<p>"No, Phelim: I don't want to break her just yet&mdash;not till
I have time, and can do it properly.  It would never do to spoil
such perfection as that.  I shall tame her, after we've taken her
to the Settlements."</p>

<p>"Yez be goin' there, masther Maurice?  When?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow.  We shall start by daybreak, so as to make only
one day between here and the Fort."</p>

<p>"Sowl!  I'm glad to hear it.  Not on me own account, but
yours, Masther Maurice.  Maybe yez don't know that the whisky's
on the idge of bein' out?  From the rattle av the jar, I don't
think there's more than three naggins left.  Them sutlers at the
Fort aren't honest.  They chate ye in the mizyure; besides
watherin' the whisky, so that it won't bear a dhrap more out av
the strame hare.  Trath! a gallon av Innishowen wud last ayqual
to three av this Amerikin <i>rotgut</i>, as the Yankees
themselves christen it."</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>"Never mind about the whisky, Phelim&mdash;I suppose there's
enough to last us for this night, and fill our flasks for the
journey of to-morrow. Look alive, old Ballyballagh!  Let us
stable the spotted mare; and then I shall have time to talk about
a fresh supply of 'potheen,' which I know you like better than
anything else&mdash;except yourself!"</p>

<p>"And you, Masther Maurice!" retorted the Galwegian, with a
comical twinkle of the eye, that caused his master to leap
laughingly out of the saddle.</p>

<p>The spotted mare was soon stabled in the shed, Castro being
temporarily attached to a tree; where Phelim proceeded to groom
him after the most approved prairie fashion.</p>

<p>The mustanger threw himself on his horse-skin couch, wearied
with the work of the day.  The capture of the "yegua pinta" had
cost him a long and arduous chase&mdash;such as he had never
ridden before in pursuit of a mustang.</p>

<p>There was a motive that had urged him on, unknown to
Phelim&mdash;unknown to Castro who carried him&mdash;unknown to
living creature, save himself.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that he had spent several days in the
saddle&mdash;the last three in constant pursuit of the spotted
mare&mdash;despite the weariness thus occasioned, he was unable
to obtain repose.  At intervals he rose to his feet, and paced
the floor of his hut, as if stirred by some exciting emotion.</p>

<p>For several nights he had slept uneasily&mdash;at intervals
tossing upon his <i>catre</i>&mdash;till not only his henchman
Phelim, but his hound Tara, wondered what could be the meaning of
his <i>unrest</i>.</p>

<p>The former might have attributed it to his desire to possess
the spotted mare; had he not known that his master's feverish
feeling antedated his knowledge of the existence of this peculiar
quadruped.</p>

<p>It was several days after his last return from the Fort that
the "yegua pinta" had first presented herself to the eye of the
mustanger.  That therefore could not be the cause of his altered
demeanour.</p>

<p>His success in having secured the animal, instead of
tranquillising his spirit, seemed to have produced the contrary
effect.  At least, so thought Phelim: who&mdash;with the freedom
of that relationship known as "foster-brother"&mdash;had at
length determined on questioning his master as to the cause of
his inquietude.  As the latter lay shifting from side to side, he
was saluted with the interrogatory&mdash;</p>

<p>"Masther Maurice, fwhat, in the name of the Howly Vargin, is
the matther wid ye?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Phelim&mdash;nothing, <i>mabohil</i>!  What makes
you think there is?"</p>

<p>"<i>Alannah</i>!  How kyan I help thinkin' it!  Yez kyant get
a wink av sleep; niver since ye returned the last time from the
Sittlement.  Och! yez hiv seen somethin' there that kapes ye
awake?  Shure now, it isn't wan av them Mixikin
girls&mdash;<i>mowchachas</i>, as they call them?  No, I won't
believe it.  You wudn't be wan av the owld Geralds to care for
such trash as them."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my good fellow!  There's nothing the matter with
me.  It's all your own imagination."</p>

<p>"Trath, masther, yez arr mistaken.  If there's anything
asthray wid me imaginashun, fhwat is it that's gone wrong wid
your own?  That is, whin yez arr aslape&mdash;which aren't often
av late."</p>

<p>"When I'm asleep!  What do you mean, Phelim?"</p>

<p>"What div I mane?  Fwhy, that wheniver yez close your eyes an
think yez are sleepin', ye begin palaverin', as if a preast was
confessin' ye!"</p>

<p>"Ah!  Is that so?  What have you heard me say?"</p>

<p>"Not much, masther, that I cud make sinse out av.  Yez be
always tryin' to pronounce a big name that appares to have no
indin', though it begins wid a <i>point</i>!"</p>

<p>"A name!  What name?"</p>

<p>"Sowl!  I kyan't till ye exakly.  It's too long for me to
remimber, seein' that my edicashun was intirely neglicted.  But
there's another name that yez phut before it; an that I kyan tell
ye.  It's a wuman's name, though it's not common in the owld
counthry.  It's Looaze that ye say, Masther Maurice; an then
comes <i>the point</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah!" interrupted the young Irishman, evidently not caring to
converse longer on the subject.  "Some name I may have
heard&mdash;somewhere, accidentally.  One does have such strange
ideas in dreams!"</p>

<p>"Trath! yez spake the truth there; for in your drames,
masther, ye talk about a purty girl lookin' out av a carriage wid
curtains to it, an tellin' her to close them agaynst some danger
that yez are going to save her from."</p>

<p>"I wonder what puts such nonsense into my head?"</p>

<p>"I wondher meself," rejoined Phelim, fixing his eyes upon his
young master with a stealthy but scrutinising look.  "Shure," he
continued, "if I may make bowld to axe the quistyun&mdash;shure,
Masther Maurice, yez haven't been makin' a Judy Fitzsummon's
mother av yerself, an fallin' in love wid wan of these Yankee
weemen out hare?  Och an-an-ee! that wud be a misforthune; an
thwat wud she say&mdash;the purty colleen wid the goodlen hair an
blue eyes, that lives not twinty miles from Ballyballagh?"</p>

<p>"Poh, poh!  Phelim! you're taking leave of your senses, I
fear."</p>

<p>"Trath, masther, I aren't; but I know somethin' I wud like to
take lave av."</p>

<p>"What is that?  Not me, I hope?"</p>

<p>"You, <i>alannah</i>?  Niver!  It's Tixas I mane.  I'd like to
take lave of that; an you goin' along wid me back to the owld
sad.  Arrah, now, fhwat's the use av yer stayin' here, wastin'
the best part av yer days in doin' nothin'?  Shure yez don't make
more than a bare livin' by the horse-catchin'; an if yez did,
what mathers it?  Yer owld aunt at Castle Ballagh can't howld out
much longer; an when she's did, the bewtiful demane 'll be yours,
spite av the dhirty way she's thratin' ye.  Shure the property's
got a tail to it; an not a mother's son av them can kape ye out
av it!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the young Irishman: "you're quite a
lawyer, Phelim.  What a first-rate attorney you'd have made!  But
come!  You forget that I haven't tasted food since morning.  What
have you got in the larder?"</p>

<p>"Trath! there's no great stock, masther.  Yez haven't laid in
anythin' for the three days yez hiv been afther spotty.  There's
only the cowld venison an the corn-bread.  If yez like I'll phut
the venison in the pat, an make a hash av it."</p>

<p>"Yes, do so.  I can wait."</p>

<p>"Won't yez wait betther afther tastin' a dhrap av the
crayther?"</p>

<p>"True&mdash;let me have it."</p>

<p>"Will yez take it nate, or with a little wather?  Trath! it
won't carry much av that same."</p>

<p>"A glass of grog&mdash;draw the water fresh from the
stream."</p>

<p>Phelim took hold of the silver drinking-cup, and was about
stepping outside, when a growl from Tara, accompanied by a start,
and followed by a rush across the floor, caused the servitor to
approach the door with a certain degree of caution.</p>

<p>The barking of the dog soon subsided into a series of joyful
whimperings, which told that he had been gratified by the sight
of some old acquaintance.</p>

<p>"It's owld Zeb Stump," said Phelim, first peeping out, and
then stepping boldly forth&mdash;with the double design of
greeting the new-comer, and executing the order he had received
from his master.</p>

<p>The individual, who had thus freely presented himself in front
of the mustanger's cabin, was as unlike either of its occupants,
as one from the other.</p>

<p>He stood fall six feet high, in a pair of tall boots,
fabricated out of tanned alligator skin; into the ample tops of
which were thrust the bottoms of his pantaloons&mdash;the latter
being of woollen homespun, that had been dyed with "dog-wood
ooze," but was now of a simple dirt colour. A deerskin under
shirt, without any other, covered his breast and shoulders; over
which was a "blanket coat," that had once been green, long since
gone to a greenish yellow, with most of the wool worn off.</p>

<p>There was no other garment to be seen: a slouch felt hat, of
greyish colour, badly battered, completing the simple, and
somewhat scant, collection of his wardrobe.</p>

<p>He was equipped in the style of a backwoods hunter, of the
true Daniel Boone breed: bullet-pouch, and large crescent-shaped
powder-horn, both suspended by shoulder-straps, hanging under the
right arm; a waist-belt of thick leather keeping his coat closed
and sustaining a skin sheath, from which protruded the rough
stag-horn handle of a long-bladed knife.</p>

<p>He did not affect either mocassins, leggings, nor the caped
and fringed tunic shirt of dressed deerskin worn by most Texan
hunters.  There was no embroidery upon his coarse clothing, no
carving upon his accoutrements or weapons, nothing in his <i>tout
ensemble</i> intended as ornamental.  Everything was plain almost
to rudeness: as if dictated by a spirit that despised
"fanfaron."</p>

<p>Even the rifle, his reliable weapon&mdash;the chief tool of
his trade&mdash;looked like a rounded bar of iron, with a piece
of brown unpolished wood at the end, forming its stock; stock and
barrel, when the butt rested on the ground, reaching up to the
level of his shoulder.</p>

<p>The individual thus clothed and equipped was apparently about
fifty years of age, with a complexion inclining to dark, and
features that, at first sight, exhibited a grave aspect.</p>

<p>On close scrutiny, however, could be detected an underlying
stratum of quiet humour; and in the twinkle of a small greyish
eye there was evidence that its owner could keenly relish a joke,
or, at times, perpetrate one.</p>

<p>The Irishman had pronounced his name: it was Zebulon Stump, or
"Old Zeb Stump," as he was better known to the very limited
circle of his acquaintances.</p>

<p>"Kaintuck, by birth an raisin',"&mdash;as he would have
described himself, if asked the country of his nativity&mdash;he
had passed the early part of his life among the primeval forests
of the Lower Mississippi&mdash;his sole calling that of a hunter;
and now, at a later period, he was performing the same
<i>metier</i> in the wilds of south-western Texas.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the staghound, as it bounded before him,
exhibiting a series of canine welcomes, told of a friendly
acquaintance between Zeb Stump and Maurice the mustanger.</p>

<p>"Evenin'!" laconically saluted Zeb, as his tail figure
shadowed the cabin door.</p>

<p>"Good evening', Mr Stump!" rejoined the owner of the hut,
rising to receive him.  "Step inside, and take a seat!"</p>

<p>The hunter accepted the invitation; and, making a single
stride across the floor, after some awkward manoeuvring,
succeeded in planting himself on the stool lately occupied by
Phelim.  The lowness of the seat brought his knees upon a level
with his chin, the tall rifle rising like a pikestaff several
feet above his head.</p>

<p>"Durn stools, anyhow!" muttered he, evidently dissatisfied
with the posture; "an' churs, too, for thet matter.  I likes to
plant my starn upon a log: thur ye've got somethin' under ye as
ain't like to guv way."</p>

<p>"Try that," said his host, pointing to the leathern
portmanteau in the corner: "you'll find it a firmer seat."</p>

<p>Old Zeb, adopting the suggestion, unfolded the zigzag of his
colossal carcase, and transferred it to the trunk.</p>

<p>"On foot, Mr Stump, as usual?"</p>

<p>"No: I got my old critter out thur, tied to a saplin'.  I
wa'n't a huntin'."</p>

<p>"You never hunt on horseback, I believe?"</p>

<p>"I shed be a greenhorn if I dud.  Anybody as goes huntin' a
hossback must be a durnation fool!"</p>

<p>"But it's the universal fashion in Texas!"</p>

<p>"Univarsal or no, it air a fool's fashion&mdash;a durned lazy
fool's fashion! I kill more meat in one day afut, then I ked in a
hul week wi' a hoss atween my legs.  I don't misdoubt that a hoss
air the best thing for you&mdash;bein' as yur game's entire
different.  But when ye go arter baar, or deer, or turkey eyther,
ye won't see much o' them, trampin' about through the timmer a
hossback, an scarrin' everythin' es hes got ears 'ithin the
circuit o' a mile.  As for hosses, I shodn't be bothered wi'
ne'er a one no how, ef twa'n't for packin' the meat: thet's why I
keep my ole maar."</p>

<p>"She's outside, you say?  Let Phelim take her round to the
shed.  You'll stay all night?"</p>

<p>"I kim for that purpiss.  But ye needn't trouble about the
maar: she air hitched safe enuf.  I'll let her out on the
laryitt, afore I take to grass."</p>

<p>"You'll have something to eat?  Phelim was just getting supper
ready. I'm sorry I can't offer you anything very
dainty&mdash;some hash of venison."</p>

<p>"Nothin' better 'n good deermeat, 'ceptin it be baar; but I
like both done over the coals.  Maybe I can help ye to some'at
thet'll make a roast.  Mister Pheelum, ef ye don't mind steppin'
to whar my critter air hitched, ye'll find a gobbler hangin' over
the horn o' the seddle.  I shot the bird as I war comin' up the
crik."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is rare good fortune!  Our larder has got very
low&mdash;quite out, in truth.  I've been so occupied, for the
last three days, in chasing a very curious mustang, that I never
thought of taking my gun with me. Phelim and I, and Tara, too,
had got to the edge of starvation."</p>

<p>"Whet sort o' a mustang?" inquired the hunter, in a tone that
betrayed interest, and without appearing to notice the final
remark.</p>

<p>"A mare; with white spots on a dark chocolate ground&mdash;a
splendid creature!"</p>

<p>"Durn it, young fellur! thet air's the very bizness thet's
brung me over to ye."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"I've seed that mustang&mdash;maar, ye say it air, though I
kedn't tell, as she'd niver let me 'ithin hef a mile o' her. I've
seed her several times out on the purayra, an I jest wanted ye to
go arter her.  I'll tell ye why.  I've been to the Leeona
settlements since I seed you last, and since I seed her too. Wal,
theer hev kum thur a man as I knowed on the Mississippi.  He air
a rich planter, as used to keep up the tallest kind o' doin's,
'specially in the feestin' way.  Many's the jeint o' deermeat,
and many's the turkey-gobbler this hyur coon hes surplied for his
table.  His name air Peintdexter."</p>

<p>"Poindexter?"</p>

<p>"Thet air the name&mdash;one o' the best known on the
Mississippi from Orleens to Saint Looey.  He war rich then; an, I
reck'n, ain't poor now&mdash;seein' as he's brought about a
hunderd niggers along wi' him. Beside, thur's a nephew o' hisn,
by name Calhoun.  He's got the dollars, an nothin' to do wi' 'em
but lend 'em to his uncle&mdash;the which, for a sartin reezun, I
think he <i>will</i>.  Now, young fellur, I'll tell ye why I
wanted to see <i>you</i>.  Thet 'ere planter hev got a darter, as
air dead bent upon hossflesh.  She used to ride the skittishest
kind o' cattle in Loozeyanner, whar they lived.  She heern me
tellin' the old 'un 'bout the spotted mustang; and nothin' would
content her thur and then, till he promised he'd offer a big
price for catchin' the critter.  He sayed he'd give a kupple o'
hunderd dollars for the anymal, ef 'twur anythin like what I
sayed it wur.  In coorse, I knowed thet 'ud send all the
mustangers in the settlement straight custrut arter it; so,
sayin' nuthin' to nobody, I kim over hyur, fast as my ole maar
'ud fetch me. You grup thet 'ere spotty, an Zeb Stump 'll go yur
bail ye'll grab them two hunderd dollars."</p>

<p>"Will you step this way, Mr Stump?" said the young Irishman,
rising from his stool, and proceeding in the direction of the
door.</p>

<p>The hunter followed, not without showing some surprise at the
abrupt invitation.</p>

<p>Maurice conducted his visitor round to the rear of the cabin;
and, pointing into the shed, inquired&mdash;</p>

<p>"Does that look anything like the mustang you've been speaking
of?"</p>

<p>"Dog-gone my cats, ef 'taint the eyedenticul same!  Grupped
already! Two hunderd dollars, easy as slidin' down a barked
saplin'!  Young fellur, yur in luck: two hunderd, slick
sure!&mdash;and durn me, ef the anymal ain't worth every cent o'
the money!  Geehosofat! what a putty beest it air!  Won't Miss
Peintdexter be pleezed!  It'll turn that young critter 'most
crazy!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER SEVEN.<br>

NOCTURNAL ANNOYANCES.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE unexpected discovery, that his purpose had been already
anticipated by the capture of the spotted mustang, raised the
spirits of the old hunter to a high pitch of excitement.</p>

<p>They were further elevated by a portion of the contents of the
demijohn, which held out beyond Phelim's expectations: giving all
hands an appetising "nip" before attacking the roast turkey, with
another go each to wash it down, and several more to accompany
the post-cenal pipe.</p>

<p>While this was being indulged in, a conversation was carried
on; the themes being those that all prairie men delight to talk
about: Indian and hunter lore.</p>

<p>As Zeb Stump was a sort of living encyclopaedia of the latter,
he was allowed to do most of the talking; and he did it in such a
fashion as to draw many a wondering ejaculation, from the tongue
of the astonished Galwegian.</p>

<p>Long before midnight, however, the conversation was brought to
a close. Perhaps the empty demijohn was, as much as anything
else, the monitor that urged their retiring to rest; though there
was another and more creditable reason.  On the morrow, the
mustanger intended to start for the Settlements; and it was
necessary that all should be astir at an early hour, to make
preparation for the journey.  The wild horses, as yet but
slightly tamed, had to be strung together, to secure against
their escaping by the way; and many other matters required
attending to previous to departure.</p>

<p>The hunter had already tethered out his "ole maar"&mdash;as he
designated the sorry specimen of horseflesh he was occasionally
accustomed to bestride&mdash;and had brought back with him an old
yellowish blanket, which was all he ever used for a bed.</p>

<p>"You may take my bedstead," said his courteous host; "I can
lay myself on a skin along the floor."</p>

<p>"No," responded the guest; "none o' yer shelves for Zeb Stump
to sleep on.  I prefer the solid groun'.  I kin sleep sounder on
it; an bus-sides, thur's no fear o' fallin' over."</p>

<p>"If you prefer it, then, take the floor.  Here's the best
place.  I'll spread a hide for you."</p>

<p>"Young fellur, don't you do anythin' o' the sort; ye'll only
be wastin' yur time.  This child don't sleep on no floors.  His
bed air the green grass o' the purayra."</p>

<p>"What! you're not going to sleep outside?" inquired the
mustanger in some surprise&mdash;seeing that his guest, with the
old blanket over his arm, was making for the door.</p>

<p>"I ain't agoin' to do anythin' else."</p>

<p>"Why, the night is freezing cold&mdash;almost as chilly as a
norther!"</p>

<p>"Durn that!  It air better to stan' a leetle chillishness,
than a feelin' o' suffercation&mdash;which last I wud sartintly
hev to go through ef I slep inside o' a house."</p>

<p>"Surely you are jesting, Mr Stump?"</p>

<p>"Young fellur!" emphatically rejoined the hunter, without
making direct reply to the question.  "It air now nigh all o' six
yeer since Zeb Stump hev stretched his ole karkiss under a roof.
I oncest used to hev a sort o' a house in the hollow o' a
sycamore-tree.  That wur on the Massissippi, when my ole ooman
wur alive, an I kep up the 'stablishment to 'commerdate her.
Arter she went under, I moved into Loozeyanny; an then arterward
kim out hyur.  Since then the blue sky o' Texas hev been my only
kiver, eyther wakin' or sleepin'."</p>

<p>"If you prefer to lie outside&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I prefar it," laconically rejoined the hunter, at the same
time stalking over the threshold, and gliding out upon the little
lawn that lay between the cabin and the creek.</p>

<p>His old blanket was not the only thing he carried along with
him. Beside it, hanging over his arm, could be seen some six or
seven yards of a horsehair rope.  It was a piece of a
<i>cabriesto</i>&mdash;usually employed for tethering
horses&mdash;though it was not for this purpose it was now to be
used.</p>

<p>Having carefully scrutinised the grass within a circumference
of several feet in diameter&mdash;which a shining moon enabled
him to do&mdash;he laid the rope with like care around the spot
examined, shaping it into a sort of irregular ellipse.</p>

<p>Stepping inside this, and wrapping the old blanket around him,
he quietly let himself down into a recumbent position.  In an
instant after he appeared to be asleep.</p>

<p>And he was asleep, as his strong breathing testified: for Zeb
Stump, with a hale constitution and a quiet conscience, had only
to summon sleep, and it came.</p>

<p>He was not permitted long to indulge his repose without
interruption.  A pair of wondering eyes had watched his every
movement&mdash;the eyes of Phelim O'Neal.</p>

<p>"Mother av Mozis!" muttered the Galwegian; "fwhat can be the
manin' av the owld chap's surroundin' himself wid the rope?"</p>

<p>The Irishman's curiosity for a while struggled with his
courtesy, but at length overcame it; and just as the slumberer
delivered his third snore, he stole towards him, shook him out of
his sleep, and propounded a question based upon the one he had
already put to himself.</p>

<p>"Durn ye for a Irish donkey!" exclaimed Stump, in evident
displeasure at being disturbed; "ye made me think it war mornin'!
What do I put the rope roun' me for?  What else wud it be for,
but to keep off the varmints!"</p>

<p>"What varmints, Misther Stump?  Snakes, div yez mane?"</p>

<p>"Snakes in coorse.  Durn ye, go to your bed!"</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the sharp rebuke, Phelim returned to the cabin
apparently in high glee.  If there was anything in Texas,
"barrin' an above the Indyins themselves," as he used to say,
"that kept him from slapin', it was them vinamous sarpints.  He
hadn't had a good night's rest, iver since he'd been in the
counthry for thinkin' av the ugly vipers, or dhramin' about thim.
What a pity Saint Pathrick hadn't paid Tixas a visit before goin'
to grace!"</p>

<p>Phelim in his remote residence, isolated as he had been from
all intercourse, had never before witnessed the trick of the
<i>cabriesto</i>.</p>

<p>He was not slow to avail himself of the knowledge thus
acquired. Returning to the cabin, and creeping stealthily
inside&mdash;as if not wishing to wake his master, already
asleep&mdash;he was seen to take a <i>cabriesto</i> from its peg;
and then going forth again, he carried the long rope around the
stockade walls&mdash;paying it out as he proceeded.</p>

<p>Having completed the circumvallation, he re-entered the hut;
as he stepped over the threshold, muttering to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sowl!  Phalim O'Nale, you'll slape sound for this night,
spite ov all the snakes in Tixas!"</p>

<p>For some minutes after Phelim's soliloquy, a profound
stillness reigned around the hut of the mustanger.  There was
like silence inside; for the countryman of Saint Patrick, no
longer apprehensive on the score of reptile intruders, had fallen
asleep, almost on the moment of his sinking down upon his spread
horse-skin.</p>

<p>For a while it seemed as if everybody was in the enjoyment of
perfect repose, Tara and the captive steeds included.  The only
sound heard was that made by Zeb Stump's "maar," close by
cropping the sweet <i>grama</i> grass.</p>

<p>Presently, however, it might have been perceived that the old
hunter was himself stirring.  Instead of lying still in the
recumbent attitude to which he had consigned himself, he could be
seen shifting from side to side, as if some feverish thought was
keeping him awake.</p>

<p>After repeating this movement some half-score of times, he at
length raised himself into a sitting posture, and looked
discontentedly around.</p>

<p>"Dod-rot his ignorance and imperence&mdash;the Irish cuss!"
were the words that came hissing through his teeth.  "He's spoilt
my night's rest, durn him!  'Twould sarve him 'bout right to drag
him out, an giv him a duckin' in the crik.  Dog-goned ef I don't
feel 'clined torst doin' it; only I don't like to displeeze the
other Irish, who air a somebody. Possible I don't git a wink o'
sleep till mornin'."</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of this peevish soliloquy, the hunter
once more drew the blanket around his body, and returned to the
horizontal position.</p>

<p>Not to sleep, however; as was testified by the tossing and
fidgeting that followed&mdash;terminated by his again raising
himself into a sitting posture.</p>

<p>A soliloquy, very similar to his former one, once more
proceeded from his lips; this time the threat of ducking Phelim
in the creek being expressed with a more emphatic accent of
determination.</p>

<p>He appeared to be wavering, as to whether he should carry the
design into execution, when an object coming under his eye gave a
new turn to his thoughts.</p>

<p>On the ground, not twenty feet from where he sate, a long thin
body was seen gliding over the grass.  Its serpent shape, and
smooth lubricated skin&mdash;reflecting the silvery light of the
moon&mdash;rendered the reptile easy of identification.</p>

<p>"Snake!" mutteringly exclaimed he, as his eye rested upon the
reptilian form.  "Wonder what sort it air, slickerin' aboout hyur
at this time o' the night?  It air too large for a <i>rattle</i>;
though thur air some in these parts most as big as it.  But it
air too clur i' the colour, an thin about the belly, for ole
rattle-tail!  No; 'tain't one o' them. Hah&mdash;now I
ree-cog-nise the varmint!  It air a <i>chicken</i>, out on the
sarch arter eggs, I reck'n!  Durn the thing! it air comin' torst
me, straight as it kin crawl!"</p>

<p>The tone in which the speaker delivered himself told that he
was in no fear of the reptile&mdash;even after discovering that
it was making approach. He knew that the snake would not cross
the <i>cabriesto</i>; but on touching it would turn away: as if
the horsehair rope was a line of living fire. Secure within his
magic circle, he could have looked tranquilly at the intruder,
though it had been the most poisonous of prairie serpents.</p>

<p>But it was not.  On the contrary, it was one of the most
innocuous&mdash; harmless as the "chicken," from which the
species takes its trivial title&mdash;at the same time that it is
one of the largest in the list of North-American
<i>reptilia</i>.</p>

<p>The expression on Zeb's face, as he sat regarding it, was
simply one of curiosity, and not very keen.  To a hunter in the
constant habit of couching himself upon the grass, there was
nothing in the sight either strange or terrifying; not even when
the creature came close up to the <i>cabriesto</i>, and, with
head slightly elevated, rubbed its snout against the rope!</p>

<p>After that there was less reason to be afraid; for the snake,
on doing so, instantly turned round and commenced retreating over
the sward.</p>

<p>For a second or two the hunter watched it moving away, without
making any movement himself.  He seemed undecided as to whether
he should follow and destroy it, or leave it to go as it had
come&mdash;unscathed.  Had it been a rattlesnake, "copperhead,"
or "mocassin," he would have acted up to the curse delivered in
the garden of Eden, and planted the heel of his heavy
alligator-skin boot upon its head.  But a harmless chicken-snake
did not come within the limits of Zeb Stump's antipathy: as was
evidenced by some words muttered by him as it slowly receded from
the spot.</p>

<p>"Poor crawlin' critter; let it go!  It ain't no enemy o' mine;
though it do suck a turkey's egg now an then, an in coorse
scarcities the breed o' the birds.  Thet air only its nater, an
no reezun why I shed be angry wi' it.  But thur's a durned good
reezun why I shed be wi' thet Irish&mdash; the dog-goned,
stinkin' fool, to ha' woke me es he dud!  I feel dod-rotted like
sarvin' him out, ef I ked only think o' some way as wudn't
diskermode the young fellur.  Stay!  By Geehosofat, I've got the
idee&mdash;the very thing&mdash;sure es my name air Zeb
Stump!"</p>

<p>On giving utterance to the last words, the hunter&mdash;whose
countenance had suddenly assumed an expression of quizzical
cheerfulness&mdash;sprang to his feet; and, with bent body,
hastened in pursuit of the retreating reptile.</p>

<p>A few strides brought him alongside of it; when he pounced
upon it with all his ten digits extended.</p>

<p>In another moment its long glittering body was uplifted from
the ground, and writhing in his grasp.</p>

<p>"Now, Mister Pheelum," exclaimed he, as if apostrophising the
serpent, "ef I don't gi'e yur Irish soul a scare thet 'll keep ye
awake till mornin', I don't know buzzart from turkey.  Hyur goes
to purvide ye wi' a bedfellur!"</p>

<p>On saying this, he advanced towards the hut; and, silently
skulking under its shadow, released the serpent from his
gripe&mdash;letting it fall within the circle of the
<i>cabriesto</i>, with which Phelim had so craftily surrounded
his sleeping-place.</p>

<p>Then returning to his grassy couch, and once more pulling the
old blanket over his shoulders, he muttered&mdash;</p>

<p>"The varmint won't come out acrost the rope&mdash;thet air
sartin; an it ain't agoin' to leave a yurd o' the groun' 'ithout
explorin' for a place to git clur&mdash;thet's eequally sartin.
Ef it don't crawl over thet Irish greenhorn 'ithin the hef o' an
hour, then ole Zeb Stump air a greenhorn hisself.  Hi! what's
thet?  Dog-goned of 'taint on him arready!"</p>

<p>If the hunter had any further reflections to give tongue to,
they could not have been heard: for at that moment there arose a
confusion of noises that must have startled every living creature
on the Alamo, and for miles up and down the stream.</p>

<p>It was a human voice that had given the cue&mdash;or rather, a
human howl, such as could proceed only from the throat of a
Galwegian.  Phelim O'Neal was the originator of the infernal
<i>fracas</i>.</p>

<p>His voice, however, was soon drowned by a chorus of barkings,
snortings, and neighings, that continued without interruption for
a period of several minutes.</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded his master, as he leaped from the
<i>catre</i>, and groped his way towards his terrified servitor.
"What the devil has got into you, Phelim?  Have you seen a
ghost?"</p>

<p>"Oh, masther!&mdash;by Jaysus! worse than that: I've been
murdhered by a snake.  It's bit me all over the body.  Blessed
Saint Pathrick!  I'm a poor lost sinner!  I'll be shure to
die!"</p>

<p>"Bitten you, you say&mdash;where?" asked Maurice, hastily
striking a light, and proceeding to examine the skin of his
henchman, assisted by the old hunter&mdash;who had by this time
arrived within the cabin.</p>

<p>"I see no sign of bite," continued the mustanger, after having
turned Phelim round and round, and closely scrutinised his
epidermis.</p>

<p>"Ne'er a scratch," laconically interpolated Stump.</p>

<p>"Sowl! then, if I'm not bit, so much the better; but it
crawled all over me.  I can feel it now, as cowld as charity, on
me skin."</p>

<p>"Was there a snake at all?" demanded Maurice, inclined to
doubt the statement of his follower.  "You've been dreaming of
one, Phelim&mdash; nothing more."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of a dhrame, masther: it was a raal sarpint.  Be me
sowl, I'm shure of it!"</p>

<p>"I reck'n thur's been snake," drily remarked the hunter.
"Let's see if we kin track it up.  Kewrious it air, too.  Thur's
a hair rope all roun' the house.  Wonder how the varmint could
ha' crossed thet?  Thur&mdash;thur it is!"</p>

<p>The hunter, as he spoke, pointed to a corner of the cabin,
where the serpent was seen spirally coiled.</p>

<p>"Only a chicken!" he continued: "no more harm in it than in a
suckin' dove.  It kedn't ha' bit ye, Mister Pheelum; but we'll
put it past bitin', anyhow."</p>

<p>Saying this, the hunter seized the snake in his hands; and,
raising it aloft, brought it down upon the floor of the cabin
with a "thwank" that almost deprived it of the power of
motion.</p>

<p>"Thru now, Mister Pheelum!" he exclaimed, giving it the
finishing touch with the heel of his heavy boot, "ye may go back
to yur bed agin, an sleep 'ithout fear o' bein' disturbed till
the mornin'&mdash;leastwise, by snakes."</p>

<p>Kicking the defunct reptile before him, Zeb Stump strode out
of the hut, gleefully chuckling to himself, as, for the third
time, he extended his colossal carcase along the sward.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER EIGHT.<br>

THE CRAWL OF THE ALACRAN.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE killing of the snake appeared to be the cue for a general
return to quiescence.  The howlings of the hound ceased with
those of the henchman.  The mustangs once more stood silent under
the shadowy trees.</p>

<p>Inside the cabin the only noise heard was an occasional
shuffling, when Phelim, no longer feeling confidence in the
protection of his <i>cabriesto</i>, turned restlessly on his
horseskin.</p>

<p>Outside also there was but one sound, to disturb the stillness
though its intonation was in striking contrast with that heard
within.  It might have been likened to a cross between the grunt
of an alligator and the croaking of a bull-frog; but proceeding,
as it did, from the nostrils of Zeb Stump, it could only be the
snore of the slumbering hunter.  Its sonorous fulness proved him
to be soundly asleep.</p>

<p>He was&mdash;had been, almost from the moment of
re-establishing himself within the circle of his
<i>cabriesto</i>. The <i>revanche</i> obtained over his late
disturber had acted as a settler to his nerves; and once more was
he enjoying the relaxation of perfect repose.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour did this contrasting duet continue, varied
only by an occasional <i>recitative</i> in the hoot of the great
horned owl, or a <i>cantata penserosa</i> in the lugubrious wail
of the prairie wolf.</p>

<p>At the end of this interval, however, the chorus recommenced,
breaking out abruptly as before, and as before led by the
vociferous voice of the Connemara man.</p>

<p>"Meliah murdher!" cried he, his first exclamation not only
startling the host of the hut, but the guest so soundly sleeping
outside.  "Howly Mother!  Vargin av unpurticted innocence!  Save
me&mdash;save me!"</p>

<p>"Save you from what?" demanded his master, once more springing
from his couch and hastening to strike a light.  "What is it, you
confounded fellow?"</p>

<p>"Another snake, yer hanner!  Och! be me sowl! a far wickeder
sarpent than the wan Misther Stump killed.  It's bit me all over
the breast.  I feel the place burnin' where it crawled across me,
just as if the horse-shoer at Ballyballagh had scorched me wid a
rid-hot iron!"</p>

<p>"Durn ye for a stinkin' skunk!" shouted Zeb Stump, with his
blanket about his shoulder, quite filling the doorway.  "Ye've
twicest spiled my night's sleep, ye Irish fool!  'Scuse me,
Mister Gerald!  Thur air fools in all countries, I reck'n,
'Merican as well as Irish&mdash;but this hyur follerer o' yourn
air the durndest o' the kind iver I kim acrost. Dog-goned if I
see how we air to get any sleep the night, 'less we drownd
<i>him</i> in the crik fust!"</p>

<p>"Och!  Misther Stump dear, don't talk that way.  I sware to
yez both there's another snake.  I'm shure it's in the kyabin
yit.  It's only a minute since I feeled it creepin' over me."</p>

<p>"You must ha' been dreemin?" rejoined the hunter, in a more
complacent tone, and speaking half interrogatively.  "I tell ye
no snake in Texas will cross a hosshair rope.  The tother 'un
must ha' been inside the house afore ye laid the laryitt roun'
it.  'Taint likely there keel ha' been two on 'em.  We kin soon
settle that by sarchin'."</p>

<p>"Oh, murdher!  Luk hare!" cried the Galwegian, pulling off his
shirt and laying bare his breast.  "Thare's the riptoile's track,
right acrass over me ribs!  Didn't I tell yez there was another
snake?  O blissed Mother, what will become av me?  It feels like
a strake av fire!"</p>

<p>"Snake!" exclaimed Stump, stepping up to the affrighted
Irishman, and holding the candle close to his skin.  "Snake
i'deed!  By the 'tarnal airthquake, it air no snake!  It air wuss
than that!"</p>

<p>"Worse than a snake?" shouted Phelim in dismay.  "Worse, yez
say, Misther Stump?  Div yez mane that it's dangerous?"</p>

<p>"Wal, it mout be, an it moutn't.  Thet ere 'll depend on
whether I kin find somethin' 'bout hyur, an find it soon.  Ef I
don't, then, Mister Pheelum, I won't answer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Misther Stump, don't say thare's danger!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded Maurice, as his eyes rested upon a
reddish line running diagonally across the breast of his
follower, and which looked as if traced by the point of a hot
spindle.  "What is it, anyhow?" he repeated with increasing
anxiety, as he observed the serious look with which the hunter
regarded the strange marking.  "I never saw the like before.  Is
it something to be alarmed about?"</p>

<p>"All o' thet, Mister Gerald," replied Stump, motioning Maurice
outside the hut, and speaking to him in a whisper, so as not to
be overheard by Phelim.</p>

<p>"But what is it?" eagerly asked the mustanger.  "<i>It air the
crawl o' the pisen centipede</i>."</p>

<p>"The poison centipede!  Has it bitten him?"</p>

<p>"No, I hardly think it hez.  But it don't need thet.  The
<i>crawl</i> o' itself air enuf to kill him!"</p>

<p>"Merciful Heaven! you don't mean that?"</p>

<p>"I do, Mister Gerald.  I've seed more 'an one good fellur go
under wi' that same sort o' a stripe acrost his skin.  If thur
ain't somethin' done, an thet soon, he'll fust get into a ragin'
fever, an then he'll go out o' his senses, jest as if the bite o'
a mad dog had gin him the hydrophoby.  It air no use frightenin'
him howsomdever, till I sees what I kin do.  Thur's a yarb, or
rayther it air a plant, as grows in these parts.  Ef I kin find
it handy, there'll be no defeequilty in curin' o' him.  But as
the cussed lack wud hev it, the moon hez sneaked out o' sight; an
I kin only get the yarb by gropin'.  I know there air plenty o'
it up on the bluff; an ef you'll go back inside, an keep the
fellur quiet, I'll see what kin be done.  I won't be gone but a
minute."</p>

<p>The whispered colloquy, and the fact of the speakers having
gone outside to carry it on, instead of tranquillising the fears
of Phelim, had by this time augmented them to an extreme degree:
and just as the old hunter, bent upon his herborising errand,
disappeared in the darkness, he came rushing forth from the hut,
howling more piteously than ever.</p>

<p>It was some time before his master could get him
tranquillised, and then only by assuring him&mdash;on a faith not
very firm&mdash;that there was not the slightest danger.</p>

<p>A few seconds after this had been accomplished, Zeb Stump
reappeared in the doorway, with a countenance that produced a
pleasant change in the feelings of those inside.  His confident
air and attitude proclaimed, as plainly as words could have done,
that he had discovered that of which he had gone in
search&mdash;the "yarb."  In his right hand he held a number of
oval shaped objects of dark green colour&mdash;all of them
bristling with sharp spines, set over the surface in equidistant
clusters.  Maurice recognised the leaves of a plant well known to
him&mdash;the <i>oregano</i> cactus.</p>

<p>"Don't be skeeart, Mister Pheelum!" said the old hunter, in a
consolatory tone, as he stepped across the threshold.  "Thur's
nothin' to fear now.  I hev got the bolsum as 'll draw the
burnin' out o' yur blood, quicker 'an flame ud scorch a feather.
Stop yur yellin', man! Ye've rousted every bird an beast, an
creepin' thing too, I reckon, out o' thar slumbers, for more an
twenty mile up an down the crik.  Ef you go on at that grist much
longer, ye'll bring the Kumanchees out o' thur mountains, an that
'ud be wuss mayhap than the crawl o' this hunderd-legged critter.
Mister Gerald, you git riddy a bandige, whiles I purpares the
powltiss."</p>

<p>Drawing his knife from its sheath, the hunter first lopped off
the spines; and then, removing the outside skin, he split the
thick succulent leaves of the cactus into slices of about an
eighth of an inch in thickness.  These he spread contiguously
upon a strip of clean cotton stuff already prepared by the
mustanger; and then, with the ability of a hunter, laid the
"powltiss," as he termed it, along the inflamed line, which he
declared to have been made by the claws of the centipede, but
which in reality was caused by the injection of venom from its
poison-charged mandibles, a thousand times inserted into the
flesh of the sleeper!</p>

<p>The application of the <i>oregano</i> was almost instantaneous
in its effect. The acrid juice of the plant, producing a counter
poison, killed that which had been secreted by the animal; and
the patient, relieved from further apprehension, and soothed by
the sweet confidence of security&mdash; stronger from
reaction&mdash;soon fell off into a profound and restorative
slumber.</p>

<p>After searching for the centipede and failing to find
it&mdash;for this hideous reptile, known in Mexico as the
<i>alacran</i>, unlike the rattlesnake, has no fear of crossing a
<i>cabriesto</i>&mdash;the improvised physician strode silently
out of the cabin; and, once more committing himself to his grassy
couch, slept undisturbed till the morning.</p>

<br>
<div align="center">

</div>
<br>

<p class="first">AT the earliest hour of daybreak all three were
astir&mdash;Phelim having recovered both from his fright and his
fever.  Having made their matutinal meal upon the <i>debris</i>
of the roast turkey, they hastened to take their departure from
the hut.  The quondam stable-boy of Ballyballagh, assisted by the
Texan hunter, prepared the wild steeds for transport across the
plains&mdash;by stringing them securely together&mdash;while
Maurice looked after his own horse and the spotted mare.  More
especially did he expend his time upon the beautiful
captive&mdash;carefully combing out her mane and tail, and
removing from her glossy coat the stains that told of the severe
chase she had cost him before her proud neck yielded to the
constraint of his lazo.</p>

<p>"Durn it, man!" exclaimed Zeb, as, with some surprise, he
stood watching the movements of the mustanger, "ye needn't ha'
been hef so purtickler! Wudley Pointdexter ain't the man as 'll
go back from a barg'in.  Ye'll git the two hunderd dollars, sure
as my name air Zeblun Stump; an dog-gone my cats, ef the maar
ain't worth every red cent o' the money!"</p>

<p>Maurice heard the remarks without making reply; but the half
suppressed smile playing around his lips told that the Kentuckian
had altogether misconstrued the motive for his assiduous
grooming.</p>

<p>In less than an hour after, the mustanger was on the march,
mounted on his blood-bay, and leading the spotted mare at the end
of his lazo; while the captive <i>cavallada</i>, under the
guidance of the Galwegian groom, went trooping at a brisk pace
over the plain.</p>

<p>Zeb Stump, astride his "ole maar," could only keep up by a
constant hammering with his heels; and Tara, picking his steps
through the spinous <i>mezquite</i> grass, trotted listlessly in
the rear.</p>

<p>The hut, with its skin-door closed against animal intruders,
was left to take care of itself; its silent solitude, for a time,
to be disturbed only by the hooting of the horned owl, the scream
of the cougar, or the howl-bark of the hungering coyote.</p>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER NINE.<br>

THE FRONTIER FORT.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE "star-spangled banner" suspended above Fort Inge, as it
flouts forth from its tall staff, flings its fitful shadow over a
scene of strange and original interest.</p>

<p>It is a picture of pure frontier life&mdash;which perhaps only
the pencil of the younger Vernet could truthfully
portray&mdash;half military, half civilian&mdash;half savage,
half civilised&mdash;mottled with figures of men whose
complexions, costumes, and callings, proclaim them appertaining
to the extremes of both, and every possible gradation
between.</p>

<p>Even the <i>mise-en-scène</i>&mdash;the Fort itself&mdash;is
of this <i>miscegenous</i> character.  That star-spangled banner
waves not over bastions and battlements; it flings no shadow over
casemate or covered way, fosse, scarpment, or glacis&mdash;scarce
anything that appertains to a fortress.  A rude stockade,
constructed out of trunks of <i>algarobia</i>, enclosing
shed-stabling for two hundred horses; outside this a half-score
of buildings of the plainest architectural style&mdash;some of
them mere huts of "wattle and
daub"&mdash;<i>jacales</i>&mdash;the biggest a barrack; behind it
the hospital, the stores of the commissary, and quartermaster; on
one side the guardhouse; and on the other, more pretentiously
placed, the messroom and officers' quarters; all plain in their
appearance&mdash; plastered and whitewashed with the lime
plentifully found on the Leona&mdash; all neat and clean, as
becomes a cantonment of troops wearing the uniform of a great
civilised nation.  Such is Fort Inge.</p>

<p>At a short distance off another group of houses meets the
eye&mdash;nearly, if not quite, as imposing as the cluster above
described bearing the name of "The Fort."  They are just outside
the shadow of the flag, though under its protection&mdash;for to
it are they indebted for their origin and existence.  They are
the germ of the village that universally springs up in the
proximity of an American military post&mdash;in all probability,
and at no very remote period, to become a town&mdash;perhaps a
great city.</p>

<p>At present their occupants are a sutler, whose store contains
"knick-knacks" not classed among commissariat rations; an
hotel-keeper whose bar-room, with white sanded floor and shelves
sparkling with prismatic glass, tempts the idler to step in; a
brace of gamblers whose rival tables of <i>faro</i> and
<i>monte</i> extract from the pockets of the soldiers most part
of their pay; a score of dark-eyed señorita of questionable
reputation; a like number of hunters, teamsters,
<i>mustangers</i>, and nondescripts&mdash;such as constitute in
all countries the hangers-on of a military cantonment, or the
followers of a camp.</p>

<p>The houses in the occupancy of this motley corporation have
been "sited" with some design.  Perhaps they are the property of
a single speculator. They stand around a "square," where, instead
of lamp-posts or statues, may be seen the decaying trunk of a
cypress, or the bushy form of a hackberry rising out of a
<i>tapis</i> of trodden grass.</p>

<p>The Leona&mdash;at this point a mere rivulet&mdash;glides past
in the rear both of fort and village.  To the front extends a
level plain, green as verdure can make it&mdash;in the distance
darkened by a bordering of woods, in which post-oaks and pecans,
live oaks and elms, struggle for existence with spinous plants of
cactus and anona; with scores of creepers, climbers, and
parasites almost unknown to the botanist.  To the south and east
along the banks of the stream, you see scattered houses: the
homesteads of plantations; some of them rude and of recent
construction, with a few of more pretentious style, and evidently
of older origin.  One of these last particularly attracts the
attention: a structure of superior size&mdash; with flat roof,
surmounted by a crenelled parapet&mdash;whose white walls show
conspicuously against the green background of forest with which
it is half encircled.  It is the hacienda of <i>Casa del
Corvo</i>.</p>

<p>Turning your eye northward, you behold a curious isolated
eminence&mdash;a gigantic cone of rocks&mdash;rising several
hundred feet above the level of the plain; and beyond, in dim
distance, a waving horizontal line indicating the outlines of the
Guadalupe mountains&mdash;the outstanding spurs of that elevated
and almost untrodden plateau, the <i>Llano Estacado</i>.</p>

<p>Look aloft!  You behold a sky, half sapphire, half turquoise;
by day, showing no other spot than the orb of its golden god; by
night, studded with stars that appear clipped from clear steel,
and a moon whose well-defined disc outshines the effulgence of
silver.</p>

<p>Look below&mdash;at that hour when moon and stars have
disappeared, and the land-wind arrives from Matagorda Bay, laden
with the fragrance of flowers; when it strikes the starry flag,
unfolding it to the eye of the morn&mdash;then look below, and
behold the picture that should have been painted by the pencil of
Vernet&mdash;too varied and vivid, too plentiful in shapes,
costumes, and colouring, to be sketched by the pen.</p>

<p>In the tableau you distinguish soldiers in uniform&mdash;the
light blue of the United States infantry, the darker cloth of the
dragoons, and the almost invisible green of the mounted
riflemen.</p>

<p>You will see but few in full uniform&mdash;only the officer of
the day, the captain of the guard, and the guard itself.</p>

<p>Their comrades off duty lounge about the barracks, or within
the stockade enclosure, in red flannel shirts, slouch hats, and
boots innocent of blacking.</p>

<p>They mingle with men whose costumes make no pretence to a
military character: tall hunters in tunics of dressed deerskin,
with leggings to correspond&mdash;herdsmen and mustangers,
habited <i>à la Mexicaine</i>&mdash;Mexicans themselves, in wide
<i>calzoneros</i>, <i>serapes</i> on their shoulders,
<i>botas</i> on their legs, huge spurs upon their heels, and
glazed <i>sombreros</i> set jauntily on their crowns.  They
palaver with Indians on a friendly visit to the Fort, for trade
or treaty; whose tents stand at some distance, and from whose
shoulders hang blankets of red, and green, and blue&mdash; giving
them a picturesque, even classical, appearance, in spite of the
hideous paint with which they have bedaubed their skins, and the
dirt that renders sticky their long black hair, lengthened by
tresses taken from the tails of their horses.</p>

<p>Picture to the eye of your imagination this jumble of mixed
nationalities&mdash;in their varied costumes of race, condition,
and calling; jot in here and there a black-skinned scion of
Ethiopia, the body servant of some officer, or the emissary of a
planter from the adjacent settlements; imagine them standing in
gossiping groups, or stalking over the level plain, amidst some
half-dozen halted waggons; a couple of six-pounders upon their
carriages, with caissons close by; a square tent or two, with its
surmounting fly&mdash;occupied by some eccentric officer who
prefers sleeping under canvas; a stack of bayoneted rifles
belonging to the soldiers on guard,&mdash;imagine all these
component parts, and you will have before your mind's eye a
truthful picture of a military fort upon the frontier of Texas,
and the extreme selvedge of civilisation.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">ABOUT a week after the arrival of the Louisiana
planter at his new home, three officers were seen standing upon
the parade ground in front of Fort Inge, with their eyes turned
towards the hacienda of Casa del Corvo.</p>

<p>They were all young men: the oldest not over thirty years of
age.  His shoulder-straps with the double bar proclaimed him a
captain; the second, with a single cross bar, was a first
lieutenant; while the youngest of the two, with an empty chevron,
was either a second lieutenant or "brevet."</p>

<p>They were off duty; engaged in conversation&mdash;their theme,
the "new people" in Casa del Corvo&mdash;by which was meant the
Louisiana planter and his family.</p>

<p>"A sort of housewarming it's to be," said the infantry
captain, alluding to an invitation that had reached the Fort,
extending to all the commissioned officers of the garrison.
"Dinner first, and dancing afterwards&mdash;a regular field day,
where I suppose we shall see paraded the aristocracy and beauty
of the settlement."</p>

<p>"Aristocracy?" laughingly rejoined the lieutenant of dragoons.
"Not much of that here, I fancy; and of beauty still less."</p>

<p>"You mistake, Hancock.  There are both upon the banks of the
Leona. Some good States families have strayed out this way. We'll
meet them at Poindexter's party, no doubt.  On the question of
aristocracy, the host himself, if you'll pardon a poor joke, is
himself a host.  He has enough of it to inoculate all the company
that may be present; and as for beauty, I'll back his daughter
against anything this side the Sabine. The commissary's niece
will be no longer belle about here."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" drawled the lieutenant of rifles, in a tone that
told of his being chafed by this representation.  "Miss
Poindexter must be deuced good-looking, then."</p>

<p>"She's all that, I tell you, if she be anything like what she
was when I last saw her, which was at a Bayou Lafourche ball.
There were half a dozen young Creoles there, who came nigh
crossing swords about her."</p>

<p>"A coquette, I suppose?" insinuated the rifleman.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, Crossman.  Quite the contrary, I assure
you. She's a girl of spirit, though&mdash;likely enough to snub
any fellow who might try to be too familiar.  She's not without
some of the father's pride.  It's a family trait of the
Poindexters."</p>

<p>"Just the girl I should cotton to," jocosely remarked the
young dragoon. "And if she's as good-looking as you say, Captain
Sloman, I shall certainly go in for her.  Unlike Crossman here,
I'm clear of all entanglements of the heart.  Thank the Lord for
it!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr Hancock," rejoined the infantry officer, a gentleman
of sober inclinings, "I'm not given to betting; but I'd lay a big
wager you won't say that, after you have seen Louise
Poindexter&mdash;that is, if you speak your mind."</p>

<p>"Pshaw, Sloman! don't you be alarmed about me.  I've been too
often under the fire of bright eyes to have any fear of
them."</p>

<p>"None so bright as hers."</p>

<p>"Deuce take it! you make a fellow fall in love with this lady
without having set eyes upon her.  She must be something
extraordinary&mdash; incomparable."</p>

<p>"She was both, when I last saw her."</p>

<p>"How long ago was that?"</p>

<p>"The Lafourche ball?  Let me see&mdash;about eighteen months.
Just after we got back from Mexico.  She was then 'coming out' as
society styles it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A new star in the firmament, to light and glory born!"</p>

<p>"Eighteen months is a long time," sagely remarked
Crossman&mdash;"a long time for an unmarried
maiden&mdash;especially among Creoles, where they often get
spliced at twelve, instead of 'sweet sixteen.'  Her beauty may
have lost some of its bloom?"</p>

<p>"I believe not a bit.  I should have called to see; only I
knew they were in the middle of their 'plenishing,' and mightn't
desire to be visited.  But the major has been to Casa del Corvo,
and brought back such a report about Miss Poindexter's beauty as
almost got him into a scrape with the lady commanding the
post."</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, Captain Sloman!" asseverated the lieutenant of
dragoons, "you've excited my curiosity to such a degree, I feel
already half in love with Louise Poindexter!"</p>

<p>"Before you get altogether into it," rejoined the officer of
infantry, in a serious tone, "let me recommend a little caution.
There's a <i>bete noir</i> in the background."</p>

<p>"A brother, I suppose?  That is the individual usually so
regarded."</p>

<p>"There is a brother, but it's not he.  A free noble young
fellow he is&mdash; the only Poindexter I ever knew not eaten up
with pride, he's quite the reverse."</p>

<p>"The aristocratic father, then?  Surely he wouldn't object to
a quartering with the Hancocks?"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that; seeing that the Hancocks are
Yankees, and he's a <i>chivalric Southerner</i>!  But it's not
old Poindexter I mean."</p>

<p>"Who, then, is the black beast, or what is it&mdash;if not a
human?"</p>

<p>"It is human, after a fashion.  A male cousin&mdash;a queer
card he is&mdash;by name Cassius Calhoun."</p>

<p>"I think I've heard the name."</p>

<p>"So have I," said the lieutenant of rifles.</p>

<p>"So has almost everybody who had anything to do with the
Mexican war&mdash; that is, who took part in Scott's campaign. He
figured there extensively, and not very creditably either.  He
was captain in a volunteer regiment of Mississippians&mdash;for
he hails from that State; but he was oftener met with at the
<i>monte-table</i> than in the quarters of his regiment.  He had
one or two affairs, that gave him the reputation of a bully.  But
that notoriety was not of Mexican-war origin.  He had earned it
before going there; and was well known among the desperadoes of
New Orleans as a <i>dangerous man</i>."</p>

<p>"What of all that?" asked the young dragoon, in a tone
slightly savouring of defiance.  "Who cares whether Mr Cassius
Calhoun be a dangerous man, or a harmless one?  Not I.  He's only
the girl's cousin, you say?"</p>

<p>"Something more, perhaps.  I have reason to think he's her
lover."</p>

<p>"Accepted, do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"That I can't tell.  I only know, or suspect, that he's the
favourite of the father.  I have heard reasons why; given only in
whispers, it is true, but too probable to be scouted.  The old
story&mdash;influence springing from mortgage money. Poindexter's
not so rich as he has been&mdash;else we'd never have seen him
out here."</p>

<p>"If the lady be as attractive as you say, I suppose we'll have
Captain Cassius out here also, before long?"</p>

<p>"Before long!  Is that all you know about it?  He <i>is</i>
here; came along with the family, and is now residing with them.
Some say he's a partner in the planting speculation.  I saw him
this very morning&mdash;down in the hotel bar-
room&mdash;'liquoring up,' and swaggering in his old way."</p>

<p>"A swarthy-complexioned man, of about thirty, with dark hair
and moustaches; wearing a blue cloth frock, half military cut,
and a Colt's revolver strapped over his thigh?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and a bowie knife, if you had looked for it, under the
breast of his coat.  That's the man."</p>

<p>"He's rather a formidable-looking fellow," remarked the young
rifleman. "If a bully, his looks don't belie him."</p>

<p>"Damn his looks!" half angrily exclaimed the dragoon.  "We
don't hold commissions in Uncle Sam's army to be scared by looks,
nor bullies either.  If he comes any of his bullying over me,
he'll find I'm as quick with a trigger as he."</p>

<p>At that moment the bugle brayed out the call for morning
parade&mdash;a ceremony observed at the little frontier fort as
regularly as if a whole <i>corps-d'armee</i> had been
present&mdash;and the three officers separating, betook
themselves to their quarters to prepare their several companies
for the inspection of the major in command of the cantonment.</p>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER TEN.<br>

CASA DEL CORVO.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE estate, or "hacienda," known as Casa del Corvo, extended
along the wooded bottom of the Leona River for more than a
league, and twice that distance southwards across the contiguous
prairie.</p>

<p>The house itself&mdash;usually, though not correctly, styled
the <i>hacienda</i>&mdash; stood within long cannon range of Fort
Inge; from which its white walls were partially visible; the
remaining portion being shadowed by tall forest trees that
skirted the banks of the stream.</p>

<p>Its site was peculiar, and no doubt chosen with a view to
defence: for its foundations had been laid at a time when Indian
assailants might be expected; as indeed they might be, and often
are, at the present hour.</p>

<p>There was a curve of the river closing upon itself, like the
shoe of a racehorse, or the arc of a circle, three parts
complete; the chord of which, or a parallelogram traced upon it,
might be taken as the ground-plan of the dwelling.  Hence the
name&mdash;Casa del Corvo&mdash;"the House of the Curve" (curved
river).</p>

<p>The facade, or entrance side, fronted towards the
prairie&mdash;the latter forming a noble lawn that extended to
the edge of the horizon&mdash;in comparison with which an
imperial park would have shrunk into the dimensions of a
paddock.</p>

<p>The architecture of Casa del Corvo, like that of other large
country mansions in Mexico, was of a style that might be termed
Morisco-Mexican: being a single story in height, with a flat
roof&mdash;<i>azotea</i>&mdash;spouted and parapeted all round;
having a courtyard inside the walls, termed <i>patio</i>, open to
the sky, with a flagged floor, a fountain, and a stone stairway
leading up to the roof; a grand entrance gateway&mdash;the
<i>saguan</i>&mdash;with a massive wooden door, thickly studded
with bolt-heads; and two or three windows on each side, defended
by a <i>grille</i> of strong iron bars, called <i>reja</i>. These
are the chief characteristics of a Mexican hacienda; and Casa del
Corvo differed but little from the type almost universal
throughout the vast territories of Spanish America.</p>

<p>Such was the homestead that adorned the newly acquired estate
of the Louisiana planter&mdash;that had become his property by
purchase.</p>

<p>As yet no change had taken place in the exterior of the
dwelling; nor much in its interior, if we except the
<i>personnel</i> of its occupants.  A physiognomy, half
Anglo-Saxon, half Franco-American, presented itself in courtyard
and corridor, where formerly were seen only faces of pure Spanish
type; and instead of the rich sonorous language of Andalusia, was
now heard the harsher guttural of a semi-Teutonic tongue&mdash;
occasionally diversified by the sweeter accentuation of Creolian
French.</p>

<p>Outside the walls of the mansion&mdash;in the village-like
cluster of yucca-thatched huts which formerly gave housing to the
<i>peons</i> and other dependants of the hacienda&mdash;the
transformation was more striking.  Where the tall thin
<i>vaquero</i>, in broad-brimmed hat of black glaze, and
chequered <i>serape</i>, strode proudly over the sward&mdash;his
spurs tinkling at every step&mdash;was now met the authoritative
"overseer," in blue jersey, or blanket coat&mdash;his whip
cracking at every corner; where the red children of Azteca and
Anahuac, scantily clad in tanned sheepskin, could be seen, with
sad solemn aspect, lounging listlessly by their <i>jacales</i>,
or trotting silently along, were now heard the black sons and
daughters of Ethiopia, from morn till night chattering their gay
"gumbo," or with song and dance seemingly contradicting the idea:
that slavery is a heritage of unhappiness!</p>

<p>Was it a change for the better upon the estate of Casa del
Corvo?</p>

<p>There was a time when the people of England would have
answered&mdash;no; with a unanimity and emphasis calculated to
drown all disbelief in their sincerity.</p>

<p>Alas, for human weakness and hypocrisy!  Our long cherished
sympathy with the slave proves to have been only a tissue of
sheer dissembling. Led by an oligarchy&mdash;not the true
aristocracy of our country: for these are too noble to have
yielded to such, deep designings&mdash;but an oligarchy composed
of conspiring plebs, who have smuggled themselves into the first
places of power in all the four estates&mdash;guided by these
prurient conspirators against the people's rights&mdash;England
has proved untrue to her creed so loudly
proclaimed&mdash;truculent to the trust reposed in her by the
universal acclaim, of the nations.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">ON a theme altogether different dwelt the
thoughts of Louise Poindexter, as she flung herself into a chair
in front of her dressing-glass, and directed her maid Florinda to
prepare her for the reception of guests&mdash; expected soon to
arrive at the hacienda.</p>

<p>It was the day fixed for the "house-warming," and about an
hour before the time appointed for dinner to be on the table.
This might have explained a certain restlessness observable in
the air of the young Creole&mdash;especially observed by
Florinda; but it did not.  The maid had her own thoughts about
the cause of her mistress's disquietude&mdash;as was proved by
the conversation that ensued between them.</p>

<p>Scarce could it be called a conversation.  It was more as if
the young lady were thinking aloud, with her attendant acting as
an echo.  During all her life, the Creole had been accustomed to
look upon her sable handmaid as a thing from whom it was not
worth while concealing her thoughts, any more than she would from
the chairs, the table, the sofa, or any other article of
furniture in the apartment.  There was but the difference of
Florinda being a little more animated and companionable, and the
advantage of her being able to give a vocal response to the
observations addressed to her.</p>

<p>For the first ten minutes after entering the chamber, Florinda
had sustained the brunt of the dialogue on indifferent
topics&mdash;her mistress only interfering with an occasional
ejaculation.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Looey!" pursued the negress, as her fingers fondly
played among the lustrous tresses of her young mistress's hair,
"how bewful you hair am!  Like de long 'Panish moss dat hang from
de cyprus-tree; only dat it am ob a diff'rent colour, an shine
like the sugar-house 'lasses."</p>

<p>As already stated, Louise Poindexter was a Creole.  After
that, it is scarce necessary to say that her hair was of a dark
colour; and&mdash;as the sable maid in rude speech had expressed
it&mdash;luxuriant as Spanish moss. It was not black; but of a
rich glowing brown&mdash;such as may be observed in the tinting
of a tortoise-shell, or the coat of a winter-trapped sable.</p>

<p>"Ah!" continued Florinda, spreading out an immense "hank" of
the hair, that glistened like a chestnut against her dark palm,
"if I had dat lubbly hair on ma head, in'tead ob dis cuss'd cully
wool, I fotch em all to ma feet&mdash;ebbry one oh dem."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, girl?" inquired the young lady, as if just
aroused from some dreamy reverie.  "What's that you've been
saying?  Fetch them to your feet?  Fetch whom?"</p>

<p>"Na, now; you know what dis chile mean?"</p>

<p>"'Pon honour, I do not."</p>

<p>"Make em lub me.  Dat's what I should hab say."</p>

<p>"But whom?"</p>

<p>"All de white gen'l'm.  De young planter, de officer ob de
Fort&mdash;all ob dem.  Wif you hair, Miss Looey, I could dem all
make conquess."</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!" laughed the young lady, amused at the
idea of Florinda figuring under that magnificent chevelure.  "You
think, with my hair upon your head, you would be invincible among
the men?"</p>

<p>"No, missa&mdash;not you hair alone&mdash;but wif you sweet
face&mdash;you skin, white as de alumbaster&mdash;you tall
figga&mdash;you grand look.  Oh, Miss Looey, you am so 'plendidly
bewful!  I hear de white gen'l'm say so.  I no need hear em say
it.  I see dat for masef."</p>

<p>"You're learning to flatter, Florinda."</p>

<p>"No, 'deed, missa&mdash;ne'er a word ob flattery&mdash;ne'er a
word, I swa it.  By de 'postles, I swa it."</p>

<p>To one who looked upon her mistress, the earnest asseveration
of the maid was not necessary to prove the sincerity of her
speech, however hyperbolical it might appear.  To say that Louise
Poindexter was beautiful, would only be to repeat the universal
verdict of the society that surrounded her.  A single glance was
sufficient to satisfy any one upon this point&mdash;strangers as
well as acquaintances.  It was a kind of beauty that needed no
<i>discovering</i>&mdash;and yet it is difficult to describe it.
The pen cannot portray swell a face.  Even the pencil could
convey but a faint idea of it: for no painter, however skilled,
could represent upon cold canvas the glowing ethereal light that
emanated from her eyes, and appeared to radiate over her
countenance.  Her features were purely classic: resembling those
types of female beauty chosen by Phidias or Praxiteles.  And yet
in all the Grecian Pantheon there is no face to which it could
have been likened: for it was not the countenance of a goddess;
but, something more attractive to the eye of man, the face of a
woman.</p>

<p>A suspicion of sensuality, apparent in the voluptuous curving
of the lower lip&mdash;still more pronounced in the prominent
rounding beneath the cheeks&mdash;while depriving the countenance
of its pure spiritualism, did not perhaps detract from its
beauty.  There are men, who, in this departure from the divine
type, would have perceived a superior charm: since in Louise
Poindexter they would have seen not a divinity to be worshipped,
but a woman to be loved.</p>

<p>Her only reply vouchsafed to Florinda's earnest asseveration
was a laugh&mdash;careless, though not incredulous.  The young
Creole did not need to be reminded of her beauty.  She was not
unconscious of it: as could be told by her taking more than one
long look into the mirror before which her toilet was being made.
The flattery of the negress scarce called up an emotion;
certainly not more than she might have felt at the fawning of a
pet spaniel; and she soon after surrendered herself to the
reverie from which the speech had aroused her.</p>

<p>Florinda was not silenced by observing her mistress's air of
abstraction.  The girl had evidently something on her
mind&mdash;some mystery, of which she desired the
<i>eclaircissement</i>&mdash;and was determined to have it.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she continued, as if talking to herself; "if Florinda
had half de charm ob young missa, she for nobody care&mdash;she
for nobody heave do deep sigh!"</p>

<p>"Sigh!" repeated her mistress, suddenly startled by the
speech.  "What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Pa' dieu, Miss Looey, Florinda no so blind you tink; nor so
deaf neider.  She you see long time sit in de same place; you
nebber 'peak no word&mdash;you only heave de sigh&mdash;de long
deep sigh.  You nebba do dat in de ole plantashun in
Loozyanny."</p>

<p>"Florinda!  I fear you are taking leave of your senses, or
have left them behind you in Louisiana?  Perhaps there's
something in the climate here that affects you.  Is that so,
girl?"</p>

<p>"Pa' dieu, Miss Looey, dat question ob youself ask.  You no be
angry case I 'peak so plain.  Florinda you slave&mdash;she you
lub like brack sisser.  She no happy hear you sigh.  Dat why she
hab take de freedom. You no be angry wif me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not.  Why should I be angry with you, child?  I'm
not.  I didn't say I was; only you are quite mistaken in your
ideas.  What you've seen, or heard, could be only a fancy of your
own.  As for sighing, heigho!  I have something else to think of
just now.  I have to entertain about a hundred
guests&mdash;nearly all strangers, too; among them the young
planters and officers whom you would entangle if you had my hair.
Ha! ha! ha!  <i>I</i> don't desire to enmesh them&mdash;not one
of them! So twist it up as you like&mdash;without the semblance
of a snare in it."</p>

<p>"Oh!  Miss Looey, you so 'peak?" inquired the negress with an
air of evident interest.  "You say none ob dem gen'l'm you care
for?  Dere am two, tree, berry, berry, berry han'som'.  One
planter dar be, and two ob de officer&mdash;all young gen'l'm.
You know de tree I mean.  All ob dem hab been 'tentive to you.
You sure, missa, tain't one ob dem dat you make sigh?"</p>

<p>"Sigh again!  Ha! ha! ha!  But come, Florinda, we're losing
time. Recollect I've got to be in the drawing-room to receive a
hundred guests.  I must have at least half an hour to compose
myself into an attitude befitting such an extensive
reception."</p>

<p>"No fear, Miss Looey&mdash;no fear.  I you toilette make in
time&mdash;plenty ob time.  No much trouble you dress.  Pa' dieu,
in any dress you look 'plendid.  You be de belle if you dress
like one ob de fiel' hand ob de plantashun."</p>

<p>"What a flatterer you are grown, Florinda!  I shall begin to
suspect that you are after some favour.  Do you wish me to
intercede, and make up your quarrel with Pluto?"</p>

<p>"No, missa.  I be friend nebber more wid Pluto.  He show
hisseff such great coward when come dat storm on de brack
prairee.  Ah, Miss Looey! what we boaf do if dat young white
gen'l'm on de red hoss no come ridin' dat way?"</p>

<p>"If he had not, cher Florinde, it is highly probable neither
of us should now have been here."</p>

<p>"Oh, missa! wasn't he real fancy man, dat 'ere?  You see him
bewful face.  You see him thick hair, jess de colour ob you
own&mdash;only curled leetle bit like mine.  Talk ob de young
planter, or dem officer at de Fort!  De brack folk say he no good
for nuffin, like dem&mdash;he only poor white trash.  Who care
fo' dat?  He am de sort ob man could dis chile make sigh.  Ah! de
berry, berry sort!"</p>

<p>Up to this point the young Creole had preserved a certain
tranquillity of countenance.  She tried to continue it; but the
effort failed her. Whether by accident or design, Florinda had
touched the most sensitive chord in the spirit of her
mistress.</p>

<p>She would have been loth to confess it, even to her slave; and
it was a relief to her, when loud voices heard in the courtyard
gave a colourable excuse for terminating her toilette, along with
the delicate dialogue upon which she might have been constrained
to enter.</p>

AN UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL.</h2>

<p class="first">
"SAY, ye durnationed nigger! whar's yur master?"</p>

<p>"Mass Poindex'er, sar?  De ole massr, or de young 'un?"</p>

<p>"Young 'un be durned!  I mean Mister Peintdexter.  Who else
shed I? Whar air he?"</p>

<p>"Ho&mdash;ho! sar! dey am boaf at home&mdash;dat is, dey am
boaf away from de house&mdash;de ole massr an de young Massr
Henry.  Dey am down de ribber, wha de folk am makin' de new

<p>"Down the river!  How fur d'ye reck'n?"</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! sar.  Dis nigga reck'n it be 'bout tree or four
mile&mdash;dat at de berry leas'."</p>

<p>"Three or four mile?  Ye must be a durnationed fool, nigger.
Mister Peintdexter's plantation don't go thet fur; an I reck'n he
ain't the man to be makin' a fence on some'dy else's clarin'.
Lookee hyur!  What time air he expected hum?  Ye've got a
straighter idee o' thet, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Dey boaf 'pected home berry soon, de young massr and de ole
massr, and Mass Ca'houn too.  Ho! ho! dar's agwine to be big
dooin's 'bout dis yar shanty&mdash;yer see dat fo' yeseff by de

Mass Poindex'er!  He de right sort.  Ho! ho! 'tranger! why you no
holla too: you no friend ob de massr?"</p>

<p>"Durn you, nigger, don't ye remember me?  Now I look into yur
ugly mug, I recollex you."</p>

<p>"Gorramighty! 'tain't Mass 'Tump&mdash;'t use to fotch de
ven'son an de turkey gobbla to de ole plantashun?  By de jumbo,
it am, tho'.  Law, Mass 'Tump, dis nigga 'members you like it wa

war away from 'bout de place. I'm de coachman now&mdash;dribes de
carriage dat carries de lady ob de 'tablishment&mdash;de bewful
Missy Loo.  Lor, massr, she berry fine gal.  Dey do say she beat
Florinday into fits.  Nebba mind, Mass 'Tump, you better wait
till ole massr come home.  He am <i>a bound to be hya</i>, in de
shortess poss'ble time."</p>

<p>"Wal, if thet's so, I'll wait upon him," rejoined the hunter,
leisurely lifting his leg over the saddle&mdash;in which up to
this time he had retained his seat.  "Now, ole fellur," he added,
passing the bridle into the hands of the negro, "you gi'e the
maar half a dozen yeers o' corn out o' the crib.  I've rid the
critter better 'n a score o' miles like a streak o'
lightnin'&mdash;all to do yur master a sarvice."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr Zebulon Stump, is it you?" exclaimed a silvery voice,
followed by the appearance of Louise Poindexter upon the
verandah.</p>

<p>"I thought it was," continued the young lady, coming up to the
railings, "though I didn't expect to see you so soon.  You said
you were going upon a long journey.  Well&mdash;I am pleased that
you are here; and so will papa and Henry be.  Pluto! go instantly
to Chloe, the cook, and see what she can give you for Mr Stump's
dinner.  You have not dined, I know. You are dusty&mdash;you've
been travelling?  Here, Morinda!  Haste you to the sideboard, and
pour out some drink.  Mr Stump will be thirsty, I'm sure, this
hot day.  What would you prefer&mdash;port, sherry, claret?  Ah,
now, if I recollect, you used to be partial to Monongahela
whisky.  I think there is some.  Morinda, see if there be!  Step
into the verandah, dear Mr Stump, and take a seat.  You were
inquiring for papa?  I expect him home every minute.  I shall try
to entertain you till he come."</p>

<p>Had the young lady paused sooner in her speech, she would not
have received an immediate reply.  Even as it was, some seconds
elapsed before Zeb made rejoinder.  He stood gazing upon her, as
if struck speechless by the sheer intensity of his
admiration.</p>

<p>"Lord o' marcy, Miss Lewaze!" he at length gasped forth, "I
thort when I used to see you on the Massissippi, ye war the
puttiest critter on the airth; but now, I think ye the puttiest
thing eyther on airth or in hewing.  Geehosofat!"</p>

<p>The old hunter's praise was scarce exaggerated.  Fresh from
the toilette, the gloss of her luxuriant hair untarnished by the
notion of the atmosphere; her cheeks glowing with a carmine tint,
produced by the application of cold water; her fine figure,
gracefully draped in a robe of India muslin&mdash;white and
semi-translucent&mdash;certainly did Louise Poindexter appear as
pretty as anything upon earth&mdash;if not in heaven.</p>

<p>"Geehosofat!" again exclaimed the hunter, following up his
complimentary speech, "I hev in my time seed what I thort war
some putty critters o' the sheemale kind&mdash;my ole 'ooman
herself warn't so bad-lookin' when I fast kim acrost her in
Kaintuck&mdash;thet she warn't.  But I will say this, Miss
Lewaze: ef the puttiest bits o' all o' them war clipped out an
then jeined thegither agin, they wudn't make up the thousanth
part o' a angel sech as you."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh!  Mr Stump&mdash;Mr Stump!  I'm
astonished to hear <i>you</i> talk in this manner.  Texas has
quite turned you into a courtier.  If you go on so, I fear you
will lose your character for plain speaking!  After that I am
sure you will stand in need of a very big drink.  Haste, Morinda!
I think you said you would prefer whisky?"</p>

<p>"Ef I didn't say it, I thunk it; an that air about the same.
Yur right, miss, I prefar the corn afore any o' them thur furrin
lickers; an I sticks to it whuriver I kin git it.  Texas hain't
made no alterashun in me in the matter o' lickerin'."</p>

<p>"Mass 'Tump, you it hab mix wif water?" inquired Florinda,
coming forward with a tumbler about one-half full of
"Monongahela."</p>

<p>"No, gurl.  Durn yur water!  I hev hed enuf o' thet since I
started this mornin'.  I hain't hed a taste o' licker the hul
day&mdash;ne'er as much as the smell o' it."</p>

<p>"Dear Mr Stump! surely you can't drink it that way?  Why, it
will burn your throat!  Have a little sugar, or honey, along with
it?"</p>

<p>"Speil it, miss.  It air sweet enuf 'ithout that sort o'
docterin'; 'specially arter you hev looked inter the glass. Yu'll
see ef I can't drink it.  Hyur goes to try!"</p>

<p>The old hunter raised the tumbler to his chin; and after
giving three gulps, and the fraction of a fourth, returned it
empty into the hands of Florinda.  A loud smacking of the lips
almost drowned the simultaneous exclamations of astonishment
uttered by the young lady and her maid.</p>

<p>"Burn my throat, ye say?  Ne'er a bit.  It hez jest eiled thet
ere jugewlar, an put it in order for a bit o' a palaver I wants
to hev wi' yur father&mdash;'bout thet ere spotty mow-stang."</p>

<p>"Oh, true!  I had forgotten.  No, I hadn't either; but I did
not suppose you had time to have news of it.  Have you heard
anything of the pretty creature?"</p>

<p>"Putty critter ye may well pernounce it.  It ur all o' thet.
Besides, it ur a maar."</p>

<p>"A ma-a-r!  What is that, Mr Stump?  I don't understand."</p>

<p>"A maar I sayed.  Shurly ye know what a maar is?"</p>

<p>"Ma-a-r&mdash;ma-a-r!  Why, no, not exactly.  Is it a Mexican
word?  <i>Mar</i> in Spanish signifies the sea."</p>

<p>"In coorse it air a Mexikin maar&mdash;all mowstangs air. They
air all on 'em o' a breed as wur oncest brought over from some
European country by the fust o' them as settled in these hyur
parts&mdash;leesewise I hev heern so."</p>

<p>"Still, Mr Stump, I do not comprehend you.  What makes this
mustang a ma-a-r?"</p>

<p>"What makes her a <i>maar</i>?  'Case she ain't a <i>hoss</i>;
thet's what make it, Miss Peintdexter."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;now&mdash;I&mdash;I think I comprehend.  But did you
say you have heard of the animal&mdash;I mean since you left
us?"</p>

<p>"Heern o' her, seed her, an feeled her."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"She air grupped."</p>

<p>"Ah, caught! what capital news!  I shall be so delighted to
see the beautiful thing; and ride it too.  I haven't had a horse
worth a piece of orange-peel since I've been in Texas.  Papa has
promised to purchase this one for me at any price.  But who is
the lucky individual who accomplished the capture?"</p>

<p>"Ye mean who grupped the maar?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;who?"</p>

<p>"Why, in coorse it wur a mowstanger."</p>

<p>"A mustanger?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es&mdash;an such a one as thur ain't another on all these
purayras&mdash; eyther to ride a hoss, or throw a laryitt over
one.  Yo may talk about yur Mexikins!  I never seed neery Mexikin
ked manage hoss-doin's like that young fellur; an thur ain't a
drop o' thur pisen blood in his veins.  He ur es white es I am
myself."</p>

<p>"His name?"</p>

<p>"Wal, es to the name o' his family, that I niver heern.  His
Christyun name air Maurice.  He's knowed up thur 'bout the Fort
as Maurice the mowstanger."</p>

<p>The old hunter was not sufficiently observant to take note of
the tone of eager interest in which the question had been asked,
nor the sudden deepening of colour upon the cheeks of the
questioner as she heard the answer.</p>

<p>Neither had escaped the observation of Florinda.</p>

<p>"La, Miss Looey!" exclaimed the latter, "shoo dat de name ob
de brave young white gen'l'm&mdash;he dat us save from being
smodered on de brack prairee?"</p>

<p>"Geehosofat, yes!" resumed the hunter, relieving the young
lady from the necessity of making reply.  "Now I think o't, he
told me o' thet suckumstance this very mornin', afore we started.
He air the same. Thet's the very fellur es hev trapped spotty; an
he air toatin' the critter along at this eyedentical minnit, in
kump'ny wi' about a dozen others o' the same cavyurd.  He oughter
be hyur afore sundown.  I pushed my ole maar ahead, so 's to tell
yur father the spotty war comin', and let him git the fust chance
o' buyin'.  I know'd as how thet ere bit o' hosdoin's don't get
druv fur into the Settlements efore someb'dy snaps her up.  I
thort o' <i>you</i>, Miss Lewaze, and how ye tuk on so when I
tolt ye 'bout the critter.  Wal, make yur mind eezy; ye shell hev
the fast chance.  Ole Zeb Stump 'll be yur bail for thet."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr Stump, it is so kind of you!  I am very, very
grateful.  You will now excuse me for a moment.  Father will soon
be back.  We have a dinner-party to-day; and I have to prepare
for receiving a great many people.  Florinda, see that Mr Stump's
luncheon is set out for him. Go, girl&mdash;go at once about
it!"</p>

<p>"And, Mr Stump," continued the young lady, drawing nearer to
the hunter, and speaking in a more subdued tone of voice, "if the
young&mdash; young gentleman should arrive while the other people
are here&mdash;perhaps he don't know them&mdash;will you see that
he is not neglected?  There is wine yonder, in the verandah, and
other things.  You know what I mean, dear Mr Stump?"</p>

<p>"Durned if I do, Miss Lewaze; that air, not adzackly.  I kin
unnerstan' all thet ere 'bout the licker' an other fixins.  But
who air the young gen'leman yur speakin' o'?  Thet's the thing as
bamboozles me."</p>

<p>"Surely you know who I mean!  The young gentleman&mdash;the
young man&mdash;who, you say, is bringing in the horses."</p>

<p>"Oh! ah!  Maurice the mowstanger!  That's it, is it?  Wal, I
reck'n yur not a hundred mile astray in calling <i>him</i> a
gen'leman; tho' it ain't offen es a mowstanger gits thet
entitlement, or desarves it eyther.  <i>He air one</i>, every
inch o' him&mdash;a gen'leman by barth, breed, an raisin'&mdash;
tho' he air a hoss-hunter, an Irish at thet."</p>

<p>The eyes of Louise Poindexter sparkled with delight as she
listened to opinions so perfectly in unison with her own.</p>

<p>"I must tell ye, howsomdiver," continued the hunter, as some
doubt had come across his mind, "it won't do to show that 'ere
young fellur any sort o' second-hand hospertality.  As they used
to say on the Massissippi, he air 'as proud as a Peintdexter.'
Excuse me, Miss Lewaze, for lettin' the word slip.  I did think
o't thet I war talkin' to a Peintdexter&mdash;not the proudest,
but the puttiest o' the name."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr Stump! you can say what you please to me.  You know
that I could not be offended with you, you dear old giant!"</p>

<p>"He'd be meaner than a dwurf es ked eyther say or do anythin'
to offend you, miss."</p>

<p>"Thanks! thanks!  I know your honest heart&mdash;I know your
devotion. Perhaps some time&mdash;some time, Mr Stump,"&mdash;she
spoke hesitatingly, but apparently without any definite
meaning&mdash;"I might stand in need of your friendship."</p>

<p>"Ye won't need it long afore ye git it, then; thet ole Zeb
Stump kin promise ye, Miss Peintdexter.  He'd be stinkiner than a
skunk, an a bigger coward than a coyoat, es wouldn't stan' by
sech as you, while there wur a bottle-full o' breath left in the
inside o' his body."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks&mdash;again and again!  But what were you
going to say? You spoke of second-hand hospitality?"</p>

<p>"I dud."</p>

<p>"You meant&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I meaned thet it 'ud be no use o' my inviting Maurice the
mowstanger eyther to eat or drink unner this hyur roof.  Unless
yur father do that, the young fellur 'll go 'ithout tastin'.  You
unnerstan, Miss Lewaze, he ain't one o' thet sort o' poor whites
as kin be sent roun' to the kitchen."</p>

<p>The young Creole stood for a second or two, without making
rejoinder. She appeared to be occupied with some abstruse
calculation, that engrossed the whole of her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Never mind about it," she at length said, in a tone that told
the calculation completed.  "Never mind, Mr Stump.  You need not
invite him.  Only let <i>me</i> know when he arrives&mdash;unless
we be at dinner, and then, of course, he would not expect any one
to appear.  But if he <i>should</i> come at that time, <i>you</i>
detain him&mdash;won't you?"</p>

<p>"Boun' to do it, ef you bid me."</p>

<p>"You will, then; and let me know he is here.  <i>I</i> shall
ask him to eat."</p>

<p>"Ef ye do, miss, I reck'n ye'll speil his appetite.  The sight
o' you, to say nothin' o' listenin' to your melodyus voice, ud
cure a starvin' wolf o' bein' hungry.  When I kim in hyur I war
peckish enuf to swaller a raw buzzart.  Neow I don't care a durn
about eatin'.  I ked go 'ithout chawin' meat for month."</p>

<p>As this exaggerated chapter of euphemism was responded to by a
peal of clear ringing laughter, the young lady pointed to the
other side of the patio; where her maid was seer emerging from
the "cocina," carrying a light tray&mdash;followed by Pluto with
one of broader dimensions, more heavily weighted.</p>

<p>"You great giant!" was the reply, given in a tone of sham
reproach; "I won't believe you have lost your appetite, until you
have eaten Jack. Yonder come Pluto and Morinda.  They bring
something that will prove more cheerful company than I; so I
shall leave you to enjoy it.  Good bye, Zeb&mdash;good bye, or,
as the natives say here, <i>hasta luego</i>!"</p>

<p>Gaily were these words spoken&mdash;lightly did Louise
Poindexter trip back across the covered corridor.  Only after
entering her chamber, and finding herself <i>chez soi-meme</i>,
did she give way to a reflection of a more serious character,
that found expression in words low murmured, but full of mystic
meaning:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is my destiny: I feel&mdash;I know that it is!  I dare not
meet, and yet I cannot shun it&mdash;I may not&mdash;I would
not&mdash;I <i>will not</i>!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER TWELVE.<br>

TAMING A WILD MARE.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE pleasantest <i>apartment</i> in a Mexican house is that
which has the roof for its floor, and the sky for its
ceiling&mdash;the <i>azotea</i>.  In fine weather&mdash;ever fine
in that sunny clime&mdash;it is preferred to the drawing-room;
especially after dinner, when the sun begins to cast
rose-coloured rays upon the snow-clad summits of Orizava,
Popocatepec, Toluca, and the "Twin Sister;" when the rich wines
of Xeres and Madeira have warmed the imaginations of Andalusia's
sons and daughters&mdash; descendants of the
Conquistadores&mdash;who mount up to their house-tops to look
upon a land of world-wide renown, rendered famous by the heroic
achievements of their ancestors.</p>

<p>Then does the Mexican "cavallero," clad in embroidered
habiliments, exhibit his splendid exterior to the eyes of some
señorita&mdash;at the same time puffing the smoke of his paper
cigarito against her cheeks.  Then does the dark-eyed doncella
favourably listen to soft whisperings; or perhaps only pretends
to listen, while, with heart distraught, and eye wandering away,
she sends stealthy glances over the plain towards some distant
hacienda&mdash;the home of him she truly loves.</p>

<p>So enjoyable a fashion, as that of spending the twilight hours
upon the housetop, could not fail to be followed by any one who
chanced to be the occupant of a Mexican dwelling; and the family
of the Louisiana planter had adopted it, as a matter of
course.</p>

<p>On that same evening, after the dining-hall had been deserted,
the roof, instead of the drawing-room, was chosen as the place of
re-assemblage; and as the sun descended towards the horizon, his
slanting rays fell upon a throng as gay, as cheerful, and perhaps
as resplendent, as ever trod the azotea of Casa del Corvo. Moving
about over its tessellated tiles, standing in scattered groups,
or lined along the parapet with faces turned towards the plain,
were women as fair and men as brave as had ever assembled on that
same spot&mdash;even when its ancient owner used to distribute
hospitality to the <i>hidalgos</i> of the land&mdash;the
<i>bluest</i> blood in Coahuila and Texas.</p>

<p>The company now collected to welcome the advent of Woodley
Poindexter on his Texan estate, could also boast of this last
distinction.  They were the <i>elite</i> of the
Settlements&mdash;not only of the Leona, but of others more
distant.  There were guests from Gonzales, from Castroville, and
even from San Antonio&mdash;old friends of the planter, who, like
him, had sought a home in South-Western Texas, and who had
ridden&mdash;some of them over a hundred miles&mdash;to be
present at this, his first grand "reception."</p>

<p>The planter had spared neither pains nor expense to give it
<i>eclat</i>. What with the sprinkling of uniforms and
epaulettes, supplied by the Fort&mdash;what with the brass band
borrowed from the same convenient repository&mdash;what with the
choice wines found in the cellars of Casa del Corvo, and which
had formed part of the purchase&mdash;there could be little
lacking to make Poindexter's party the most brilliant ever given
upon the banks of the Leona.</p>

<p>And to insure this effect, his lovely daughter Louise, late
belle of Louisiana&mdash;the fame of whose beauty had been before
her, even in Texas&mdash; acted as mistress of the
ceremonies&mdash;moving about among the admiring guests with the
smile of a queen, and the grace of a goddess.</p>

<p>On that occasion was she the cynosure of a hundred pairs of
eyes, the happiness of a score of hearts, and perhaps the torture
of as many more: for not all were blessed who beheld her
beauty.</p>

<p>Was she herself happy?</p>

<p>The interrogatory may appear singular&mdash;almost absurd.
Surrounded by friends&mdash;admirers&mdash;one, at least, who
adored her&mdash;a dozen whose incipient love could but end in
adoration&mdash;young planters, lawyers, embryo statesmen, and
some with reputation already achieved&mdash;sons of Mars in
armour, or with armour late laid aside&mdash;how could she be
otherwise than proudly, supremely happy?</p>

<p>A stranger might have asked the question; one superficially
acquainted with Creole character&mdash;more especially the
character of the lady in question.</p>

<p>But mingling in that splendid throng was a man who was no
stranger to either; and who, perhaps, more than any one present,
watched her every movement; and endeavoured more than any other
to interpret its meaning. Cassius Calhoun was the individual thus
occupied.</p>

<p>She went not hither, nor thither, without his following
her&mdash;not close, like a shadow; but by stealth, flitting from
place to place; upstairs, and downstairs; standing in corners,
with an air of apparent abstraction; but all the while with eyes
turned askant upon his cousin's face, like a plain-clothes
policeman employed on detective duty.</p>

<p>Strangely enough he did not seem to pay much regard to her
speeches, made in reply to the compliments showered upon her by
several would-be winners of a smile&mdash;not even when these
were conspicuous and respectable, as in the case of young Hancock
of the dragoons.  To all such he listened without visible
emotion, as one listens to a conversation in no way affecting the
affairs either of self or friends.</p>

<p>It was only after ascending to the azotea, on observing his
cousin near the parapet, with her eye turned interrogatively
towards the plain, that his detective zeal became
conspicuous&mdash;so much so as to attract the notice of others.
More than once was it noticed by those standing near: for more
than once was repeated the act which gave cause to it.</p>

<p>At intervals, not very wide apart, the young mistress of Casa
del Corvo might have been seen to approach the parapet, and look
across the plain, with a glance that seemed to interrogate the
horizon of the sky.</p>

<p>Why she did so no one could tell.  No one presumed to
conjecture, except Cassius Calhoun.  He had thoughts upon the
subject&mdash;thoughts that were torturing him.</p>

<p>When a group of moving forms appeared upon the prairie,
emerging from the garish light of the setting sun&mdash;when the
spectators upon the azotea pronounced it a drove of horses in
charge of some mounted men&mdash;the ex-officer of volunteers had
a suspicion as to who was conducting that <i>cavallada</i>.</p>

<p>Another appeared to feel an equal interest in its advent,
though perhaps from a different motive.  Long before the
horse-drove had attracted the observation of Poindexter's guests,
his daughter had noted its approach&mdash;from the time that a
cloud of dust soared up against the horizon, so slight and filmy
as to have escaped detection by any eye not bent expressly on
discovering it.</p>

<p>From that moment the young Creole, under cover of a
conversation carried on amid a circle of fair companions, had
been slyly scanning the dust-cloud as it drew nearer; forming
conjectures as to what was causing it, upon knowledge already,
and as she supposed, exclusively her own.</p>

<p>"Wild horses!" announced the major commandant of Fort Inge,
after a short inspection through his pocket telescope.  "Some one
bringing them in," he added, a second time raising the glass to
his eye.  "Oh!  I see now&mdash;it's Maurice the mustanger, who
occasionally helps our men to a remount.  He appears to be coming
this way&mdash;direct to your place, Mr Poindexter."</p>

<p>"If it be the young fellow you have named, that's not
unlikely," replied the owner of Casa del Corvo.  "I bargained
with him to catch me a score or two; and maybe this is the first
instalment he's bringing me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think it is," he added, after a look through the
telescope.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it," said the planter's son.  "I can tell the
horseman yonder to be Maurice Gerald."</p>

<p>The planter's daughter could have done the same; though she
made no display of her knowledge.  She did not appear to be much
interested in the matter&mdash;indeed, rather indifferent.  She
had become aware of being watched by that evil eye, constantly
burning upon her.</p>

<p>The <i>cavallada</i> came up, Maurice sitting handsomely on
his horse, with the spotted mare at the end of his lazo.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful creature!" exclaimed several voices, as the
captured mustang was led up in front of the house, quivering with
excitement at a scene so new to it.</p>

<p>"It's worth a journey to the ground to look at such an
animal!" suggested the major's wife, a lady of enthusiastic
inclinings.  "I propose we all go down!  What say you, Miss
Poindexter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," answered the mistress of the mansion, amidst
a chorus of other voices crying out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us go down!  Let us go down!"</p>

<p>Led by the majoress, the ladies filed down the stone
stairway&mdash;the gentlemen after; and in a score of seconds the
horse-hunter, still seated in his saddle, became, with his
captive, the centre of the distinguished circle.</p>

<p>Henry Poindexter had hurried down before the rest, and
already, in the frankest manner, bidden the stranger welcome.</p>

<p>Between the latter and Louise only a slight salutation could
be exchanged.  Familiarity with a horse-dealer&mdash;even
supposing him to have had the honour of an
introduction&mdash;would scarce have been tolerated by the
"society."</p>

<p>Of the ladies, the major's wife alone addressed him in a
familiar way; but that was in a tone that told of superior
position, coupled with condescension.  He was more gratified by a
glance&mdash;quick and silent&mdash; when his eye changed
intelligence with that of the young Creole.</p>

<p>Hers was not the only one that rested approvingly upon him. In
truth, the mustanger looked splendid, despite his travel-stained
habiliments. His journey of over twenty miles had done little to
fatigue him.  The prairie breeze had freshened the colour upon
his cheeks; and his full round throat, naked to the breast-bone,
and slightly bronzed with the sun, contributed to the manliness
of his mien.  Even the dust clinging to his curled hair could not
altogether conceal its natural gloss, nor the luxuriance of its
growth; while a figure tersely knit told of strength and
endurance beyond the ordinary endowment of man. There were stolen
glances, endeavouring to catch his, sent by more than one of the
fair circle.  The pretty niece of the commissary smiled
admiringly upon him.  Some said the commissary's wife; but this
could be only a slander, to be traced, perhaps, to the doctor's
better half&mdash;the Lady Teazle of the cantonment.</p>

<p>"Surely," said Poindexter, after making an examination of the
captured mustang, "this must be the animal of which old Zeb Stump
has been telling me?"</p>

<p>"It ur thet eyedenticul same," answered the individual so
described, making his way towards Maurice with the design of
assisting him. "Ye-es, Mister Peintdexter; the eyedenticul
critter&mdash;a maar, es ye kin all see for yurselves&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," hurriedly interposed the planter, not desiring any
further elucidation.</p>

<p>"The young fellur hed grupped her afore I got thur; so I wur
jess in the nick o' time 'bout it.  She mout a been tuck elswhar,
an then Miss Lewaze thur mout a missed hevin' her."</p>

<p>"It is true indeed, Mr Stump!  It was very thoughtful of you.
I know not how I shall ever be able to reciprocate your
kindness?"</p>

<p>"Reciperkate!  Wal, I spose thet air means to do suthin in
return.  Ye kin do thet, miss, 'ithout much difeequilty.  I han't
dud nothin' for you, ceptin' make a bit o' a journey acrost the
purayra.  To see yur bewtyful self mounted on thet maar, wi' yur
ploomed het upon yur head, an yur long-tailed pettykote streakin'
it ahint you, 'ud pay old Zeb Stump to go clur to the Rockies,
and back agin."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr Stump! you are an incorrigible flatterer!  Look around
you! you will see many here more deserving of your compliments
than I."</p>

<p>"Wal, wal!" rejoined Zeb, casting a look of careless scrutiny
towards the ladies, "I ain't a goin' to deny thet thur air gobs
o' putty critters hyur&mdash;dog-goned putty critters; but es
they used to say in ole Loozyanney, thur air but one Lewaze
Peintdexter."</p>

<p>A burst of laughter&mdash;in which only a few feminine voices
bore part&mdash;was the reply to Zeb's gallant speech.</p>

<p>"I shall owe you two hundred dollars for this," said the
planter, addressing himself to Maurice, and pointing to the
spotted mare.  "I think that was the sum stipulated for by Mr
Stump."</p>

<p>"I was not a party to the stipulation," replied the mustanger,
with a significant but well-intentioned smile.  "I cannot take
your money. <i>She</i> is not for sale."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said the planter, drawing back with an air of
proud disappointment; while his brother planters, as well as the
officers of the Fort, looked astonished at the refusal of such a
munificent price. Two hundred dollars for an untamed mustang,
when the usual rate of price was from ten to twenty!  The
mustanger must be mad?</p>

<p>He gave them no time to descant upon his sanity.</p>

<p>"Mr Poindexter," he continued, speaking in the same
good-humoured strain, "you have given me such a generous price
for my other captives&mdash; and before they were taken
too&mdash;that I can afford to make a present&mdash; what we over
in Ireland call a 'luckpenny.'  It is our custom there also, when
a horse-trade takes place at the house, to give the
<i>douceur</i>, not to the purchaser himself, but to one of the
fair members of his family. May I have your permission to
introduce this Hibernian fashion into the settlements of
Texas?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, by all means!" responded several voices, two or
three of them unmistakably with an Irish accentuation.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, Mr Gerald!" replied the planter, his
conservatism giving way to the popular will&mdash;"as you please
about that."</p>

<p>"Thanks, gentlemen&mdash;thanks!" said the mustanger, with a
patronising look towards men who believed themselves to be his
masters.  "This mustang is my luckpenny; and if Miss Poindexter
will condescend to accept of it, I shall feel more than repaid
for the three days' chase which the creature has cost me.  Had
she been the most cruel of coquettes, she could scarce have been
more difficult to subdue."</p>

<p>"I accept your gift, sir; and with gratitude," responded the
young Creole&mdash;for the first time prominently proclaiming
herself, and stepping freely forth as she spoke.  "But I have a
fancy," she continued, pointing to the mustang&mdash;at the same
time that her eye rested inquiringly on the countenance of the
mustanger&mdash;"a fancy that your captive is not yet
<i>tamed</i>?  She but trembles in fear of the unknown future.
She may yet kick against the traces, if she find the harness not
to her liking; and then what am I to do&mdash;poor I?"</p>

<p>"True, Maurice!" said the major, widely mistaken as to the
meaning of the mysterious speech, and addressing the only man on
the ground who could possibly have comprehended it; "Miss
Poindexter speaks very sensibly.  That mustang has not been tamed
yet&mdash;any one may see it. Come, my good fellow! give her the
lesson.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen!" continued the major, turning towards
the company, "this is something worth your seeing&mdash;those of
you who have not witnessed the spectacle before.  Come, Maurice;
mount, and show us a specimen of prairie horsemanship.  She looks
as though she would put your skill to the test."</p>

<p>"You are right, major: she does!" replied the mustanger, with
a quick glance, directed not towards the captive quadruped, but
to the young Creole; who, with all her assumed courage, retired
tremblingly behind the circle of spectators.</p>

<p>"No matter, my man," pursued the major, in a tone intended for
encouragement.  "In spite of that devil sparkling in her eye,
I'll lay ten to one you'll take the conceit out of her. Try!"</p>

<p>Without losing credit, the mustanger could not have declined
acceding to the major's request.  It was a challenge to
skill&mdash;to equestrian prowess&mdash;a thing not lightly
esteemed upon the prairies of Texas.</p>

<p>He proclaimed his acceptance of it by leaping lightly out of
his saddle, resigning his own steed to Zeb Stump, and exclusively
giving his attention to the captive.</p>

<p>The only preliminary called for was the clearing of the
ground.  This was effected in an instant&mdash;the greater part
of the company&mdash;with all the ladies&mdash;returning to the
azotea.</p>

<p>With only a piece of raw-hide rope looped around the under
jaw, and carried headstall fashion behind the ears&mdash;with
only one rein in hand&mdash; Maurice sprang to the back of the
wild mare.</p>

<p>It was the first time she had ever been mounted by
man&mdash;the first insult of the kind offered to her.</p>

<p>A shrill spiteful scream spoke plainly her appreciation of and
determination to resent it.  It proclaimed defiance of the
attempt to degrade her to the condition of a slave!</p>

<p>With equine instinct, she reared upon her hind legs, for some
seconds balancing her body in an erect position.  Her rider,
anticipating the trick, had thrown his arms around her neck; and,
close clasping her throat, appeared part of herself.  But for
this she might have poised over upon her back, and crushed him
beneath her.</p>

<p>The uprearing of the hind quarters was the next "trick" of the
mustang&mdash; sure of being tried, and most difficult for the
rider to meet without being thrown.  From sheer conceit in his
skill, he had declined saddle and stirrup, that would now have
stood him in stead; but with these he could not have claimed
accomplishment of the boasted feat of the prairies&mdash;<i>to
tame the naked steed</i>.</p>

<p>He performed it without them.  As the mare raised her hind
quarters aloft, he turned quickly upon her back, threw his arms
around the barrel of her body, and resting his toes upon the
angular points of her fore shoulders, successfully resisted her
efforts to unhorse him.</p>

<p>Twice or three times was the endeavour repeated by the
mustang, and as often foiled by the skill of the mustanger; and
then, as if conscious that such efforts were idle, the enraged
animal plunged no longer; but, springing away from the spot,
entered upon a gallop that appeared to have no goal this side the
ending of the earth.</p>

<p>It must have come to an end somewhere; though not within sight
of the spectators, who kept their places, waiting for the
horse-tamer's return.</p>

<p>Conjectures that he might be killed, or, at the least, badly
"crippled," were freely ventured during his absence; and there
was one who wished it so.  But there was also one upon whom such
an event would have produced a painful impression&mdash;almost as
painful as if her own life depended upon his safe return.  Why
Louise Poindexter, daughter of the proud Louisiana sugar-planter
&mdash;a belle&mdash;a beauty of more than provincial
repute&mdash;who could, by simply saying yes, have had for a
husband the richest and noblest in the land&mdash;why she should
have fixed her fancy, or even permitted her thoughts to stray,
upon a poor horse-hunter of Texas, was a mystery that even her
own intellect&mdash;by no means a weak one&mdash;was unable to
fathom.</p>

<p>Perhaps she had not yet gone so far as to fix her fancy upon
him.  She did not think so herself.  Had she thought so, and
reflected upon it, perhaps she would have recoiled from the
contemplation of certain consequences, that could not have failed
to present themselves to her mind.</p>

<p>She was but conscious of having conceived some strange
interest in a strange individual&mdash;one who had presented
himself in a fashion that favoured fanciful reflections&mdash;one
who differed essentially from the common-place types introduced
to her in the world of social distinctions.</p>

<p>She was conscious, too, that this interest&mdash;originating
in a word, a glance, a gesture&mdash;listened to, or observed,
amid the ashes of a burnt prairie&mdash;instead of subsiding, had
ever since been upon the increase!</p>

<p>It was not diminished when Maurice the mustanger came riding
back across the plain, with the wild mare between his
legs&mdash;no more wild&mdash;no longer desiring to destroy
him&mdash;but with lowered crest and mien submissive,
acknowledging to all the world that she had found her master!</p>

<p>Without acknowledging it to the world, or even to herself, the
young Creole was inspired with a similar reflection.</p>

<p>"Miss Poindexter!" said the mustanger, gliding to the ground,
and without making any acknowledgment to the plaudits that were
showered upon him&mdash;"may I ask you to step up to her, throw
this lazo over her neck, and lead her to the stable?  By so
doing, she will regard you as her tamer; and ever after submit to
your will, if you but exhibit the sign that first deprived her of
her liberty."</p>

<p>A prude would have paltered with the proposal&mdash;a coquette
would have declined it&mdash;a timid girl have shrunk back.</p>

<p>Not so Louise Poindexter&mdash;a descendant of one of the
<i>filles-a-la-casette</i>.  Without a moment's
hesitation&mdash;without the slightest show of prudery or
fear&mdash;she stepped forth from the aristocratic circle; as
instructed, took hold of the horsehair rope; whisked it across
the neck of the tamed mustang; and led the captive off towards
the <i>caballeriza</i> of Casa del Corvo.</p>

<p>As she did so, the mustanger's words were ringing in her ears,
and echoing through her heart with a strange foreboding weird
signification.</p>

<p>"<i>She will regard you as her tamer; and ever after submit to
your will, if you but exhibit the sign that first deprived her of
her liberty</i>."</p>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER THIRTEEN.<br>

A PRAIRIE PIC-NIC.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE first rays from a rosy aurora, saluting the flag of Fort
Inge, fell with a more subdued light upon an assemblage of
objects occupying the parade-ground below&mdash;in front of the
"officers' quarters."</p>

<p>A small sumpter-waggon stood in the centre of the group;
having attached to it a double span of tight little Mexican
mules, whose quick impatient "stomping," tails spitefully
whisked, and ears at intervals turning awry, told that they had
been for some time in harness, and were impatient to move
off&mdash;warning the bystanders, as well, against a too close
approximation to their heels.</p>

<p>Literally speaking, there were no bystanders&mdash;if we
except a man of colossal size, in blanket coat, and slouch felt
hat; who, despite the obscure light straggling around his
shoulders, could be identified as Zeb Stump, the hunter.</p>

<p>He was not standing either, but seated astride his "ole maar,"
that showed less anxiety to be off than either the Mexican mules
or her own master.</p>

<p>The other forms around the vehicle were all in
motion&mdash;quick, hurried, occasionally confused&mdash;hither
and thither, from the waggon to the door of the quarters, and
back again from the house to the vehicle.</p>

<p>There were half a score of them, or thereabouts; varied in
costume as in the colour of their skins.  Most were soldiers, in
fatigue dress, though of different arms of the service.  Two
would be taken to be mess-cooks; and two or three more, officers'
servants, who had been detailed from the ranks.</p>

<p>A more legitimate specimen of this profession appeared in the
person of a well-dressed darkie, who moved about the ground in a
very authoritative manner; deriving his importance, from his
office of <i>valet de tout</i> to the major in command of the
cantonment.  A sergeant, as shown by his three-barred chevron,
was in charge of the mixed party, directing their movements; the
object of which was to load the waggon with eatables and
drinkables&mdash;in short, the paraphernalia of a pic-nic.</p>

<p>That it was intended to be upon a grand scale, was testified
by the amplitude and variety of the <i>impedimenta</i>.  There
were hampers and baskets of all shapes and sizes, including the
well known parallelopipedon, enclosing its twelve necks of
shining silver-lead; while the tin canisters, painted Spanish
brown, along with the universal sardine-case, proclaimed the
presence of many luxuries not indigenous to Texas.</p>

<p>However delicate and extensive the stock of provisions, there
was one in the party of purveyors who did not appear to think it
complete.  The dissatisfied Lucullus was Zeb Stump.</p>

<p>"Lookee hyur, surgint," said he, addressing himself
confidentially to the individual in charge, "I hain't seed neery
smell o' corn put inter the veehicle as yit; an', I reck'n, thet
out on the purayra, thur'll be some folks ud prefar a leetle corn
to any o' thet theer furrin French stuff.  Sham-pain, ye call it,
I b'lieve."</p>

<p>"Prefer corn to champagne!  The horses you mean?"</p>

<p>"Hosses be durned.  I ain't talkin' 'bout hoss corn.  I mean
M'nongaheela."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;I comprehend.  You're right about that, Mr
Stump.  The whisky mustn't be forgotten, Pomp.  I think I saw a
jar inside, that's intended to go?"</p>

<p>"Yaw&mdash;yaw, sagint," responded the dark-skinned domestic;
"dar am dat same wesicle.  Hya it is!" he added, lugging a large
jar into the light, and swinging it up into the waggon.</p>

<p>Old Zeb appearing to think the packing now complete, showed
signs of impatience to be off.</p>

<p>"Ain't ye riddy, surgint?" he inquired, shifting restlessly in
his stirrups.</p>

<p>"Not quite, Mr Stump.  The cook tells me the chickens want
another turn upon the spit, before we can take 'em along."</p>

<p>"Durn the chickens, an the cook too!  What air any dung-hill
fowl to compare wi' a wild turkey o' the purayra; an how am I to
shoot one, arter the sun hev clomb ten mile up the sky?  The
major sayed I war to git him a gobbler, whativer shed happen.
'Tain't so durnation eezy to kill turkey gobbler arter sun-up,
wi' a clamjamferry like this comin' clost upon a fellur's heels?
Ye mustn't surpose, surgint, that thet ere bird air as big a fool
as the sodger o' a fort.  Of all the cunnin' critters as
ferquents these hyur purayras, a turkey air the cunninest; an to
git helf way roun' one o' 'em, ye must be up along wi' the sun;
and preehap a leetle urlier."</p>

<p>"True, Mr Stump.  I know the major wants a wild turkey.  He
told me so; and expects you to procure one on the way."</p>

<p>"No doubt he do; an preehap expex me likeways to purvid him
wi' a baffler's tongue, an hump&mdash;seein' as thur ain't sech a
anymal on the purayras o' South Texas&mdash;nor hain't a been for
good twenty yurs past&mdash; noterthstandin' what Eur-op-ean
writers o' books hev said to the contrary, an 'specially French
'uns, as I've heern.  Thur ain't no burner 'bout hyur.  Thur's
baar, an deer, an goats, an plenty o' gobblers; but to hev one o'
these critters for yur dinner, ye must git it urly enuf for yur
breakfist.  Unless I hev my own time, I won't promise to guide
yur party, an git gobbler both.  So, surgint, ef ye expex yur
grand kumpny to chaw turkey-meat this day, ye'll do well to be
makin' tracks for the purayra."</p>

<p>Stirred by the hunter's representation, the sergeant did all
that was possible to hasten the departure of himself and his
parti-coloured company; and, shortly after, the provision train,
with Zeb Stump as its guide, was wending its way across the
extensive plain that lies between the Leona and the "River of
Nuts."</p>

<p>The parade-ground had been cleared of the waggon and its
escort scarce twenty minutes, when a party of somewhat different
appearance commenced assembling upon the same spot.</p>

<p>There were ladies on horseback; attended, not by grooms, as at
the "meet" in an English hunting-field, but by the gentlemen who
were to accompany them&mdash;their friends and
acquaintances&mdash;fathers, brothers, lovers, and husbands.
Most, if not all, who had figured at Poindexter's dinner party,
were soon upon the ground.</p>

<p>The planter himself was present; as also his son Henry, his
nephew Cassius Calhoun, and his daughter Louise&mdash;the young
lady mounted upon the spotted mustang, that had figured so
conspicuously on the occasion of the entertainment at Casa del
Corvo.</p>

<p>The affair was a reciprocal treat&mdash;a simple return of
hospitality; the major and his officers being the hosts, the
planter and his friends the invited guests.  The entertainment
about to be provided, if less pretentious in luxurious
appointments, was equally appropriate to the time and place.  The
guests of the cantonment were to be gratified by witnessing a
spectacle&mdash;grand as rare&mdash;a chase of wild steeds!</p>

<p>The arena of the sport could only be upon the wild-horse
prairies&mdash;some twenty miles to the southward of Fort Inge.
Hence the necessity for an early start, and being preceded by a
vehicle laden with an ample <i>commissariat</i>.</p>

<p>Just as the sunbeams began to dance upon the crystal waters of
the Leona, the excursionists were ready to take their departure
from the parade-ground&mdash;with an escort of two-score dragoons
that had been ordered to ride in the rear.  Like the party that
preceded them, they too were provided with a guide&mdash;not an
old backwoodsman in battered felt hat, and faded blanket coat,
astride a scraggy roadster; but a horseman completely costumed
and equipped, mounted upon a splendid steed, in every way worthy
to be the chaperone of such a distinguished expedition.</p>

<p>"Come, Maurice!" cried the major, on seeing that all had
assembled, "we're ready to be conducted to the game.  Ladies and
gentlemen! this young fellow is thoroughly acquainted with the
haunts and habits of the wild horses.  If there's a man in Texas,
who can show us how to hunt them, 'tis Maurice the
mustanger."</p>

<p>"Faith, you flatter me, major!" rejoined the young Irishman,
turning with a courteous air towards the company; "I have not
said so much as that.  I can only promise to show you where you
may <i>find</i> them."</p>

<p>"Modest fellow!" soliloquised one, who trembled, as she gave
thought to what she more than half suspected to be an
untruth.</p>

<p>"Lead on, then!" commanded the major; and, at the word, the
gay cavalcade, with the mustanger in the lead, commenced moving
across the parade-ground&mdash;while the star-spangled banner,
unfurled by the morning breeze, fluttered upon its staff as if
waving them an elegant adieu!</p>

<p>A twenty-mile ride upon prairie turf is a mere
bagatelle&mdash;before breakfast, an airing.  In Texas it is so
regarded by man, woman, and horse.</p>

<p>It was accomplished in less than three hours&mdash;without
further inconvenience than that which arose from performing the
last few miles of it with appetites uncomfortably keen.</p>

<p>Fortunately the provision waggon, passed upon the road, came
close upon their heels; and, long before the sun had attained the
meridian line, the excursionists were in full pic-nic under the
shade of a gigantic pecan tree, that stood near the banks of the
Nueces.</p>

<p>No incident had occurred on the way&mdash;worth recording. The
mustanger, as guide, had ridden habitually in the advance; the
company, with one or two exceptions, thinking of him only in his
official capacity&mdash;unless when startled by some feat of
horsemanship&mdash;such as leaping clear over a prairie stream,
or dry arroyo, which others were fain to ford, or cross by the
crooked path.</p>

<p>There may have been a suspicion of bravado in this
behaviour&mdash;a desire to exhibit.  Cassius Calhoun told the
company there was.  Perhaps the ex-captain spoke the
truth&mdash;for once.</p>

<p>If so, there was also some excuse.  Have you ever been in a
hunting-field, at home, with riding habits trailing the sward,
and plumed hats proudly nodding around you?  You have: and then
what?  Be cautious how you condemn the Texan mustanger.  Reflect,
that he, too, was under the artillery of bright eyes&mdash;a
score pair of them&mdash;some as bright as ever looked love out
of a lady's saddle.  Think, that Louise Poindexter's were among
the number&mdash;think of that, and you will scarce feel
surprised at the ambition to "shine."</p>

<p>There were others equally demonstrative of personal
accomplishments&mdash;of prowess that might prove manhood.  The
young dragoon, Hancock, frequently essayed to show that he was
not new to the saddle; and the lieutenant of mounted rifles, at
intervals, strayed from the side of the commissary's niece for
the performance of some equestrian feat, without looking
exclusively to her, his reputed sweetheart, as he listened to the
whisperings of applause.</p>

<p>Ah, daughter of Poindexter!  Whether in the <i>salons</i> of
civilised Louisiana, or the prairies of savage Texas, peace could
not reign in thy presence!  Go where thou wilt, romantic thoughts
must spring up&mdash;wild passions be engendered around thee!</p>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER FOURTEEN.<br>

THE MANADA.</h2>

<p class="first">
HAD their guide held the prairies in complete
control&mdash;its denizens subject to his secret
will&mdash;responsible to time and place&mdash;he could not have
conducted the excursionists to a spot more likely to furnish the
sport that had summoned them forth.</p>

<p>Just as the sparkling Johannisberger&mdash;obtained from the
German wine-stores of San Antonio&mdash;had imparted a brighter
blue to the sky, and a more vivid green to the grass, the cry
"Mustenos!" was heard above the hum of conversation, interrupting
the half-spoken sentiment, with the peal of merry laughter.  It
came from a Mexican <i>vaquero</i>, who had been stationed as a
vidette on an eminence near at hand.</p>

<p>Maurice&mdash;at the moment partaking of the hospitality of
his employers, freely extended to him&mdash;suddenly quaffed off
the cup; and springing to his saddle, cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Cavallada</i>?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the Mexican; "<i>manada</i>."</p>

<p>"What do the fellows mean by their gibberish?" inquired
Captain Calhoun.</p>

<p>"<i>Mustenos</i> is only the Mexican for mustangs," replied
the major; "and by 'manada' he means they are wild mares&mdash;a
drove of them.  At this season they herd together, and keep apart
from the horses; unless when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When what?" impatiently asked the ex-officer of volunteers,
interrupting the explanation.</p>

<p>"When they are attacked by asses," innocently answered the
major.</p>

<p>A general peal of laughter rendered doubtful the
<i>naivete</i> of the major's response&mdash;imparting to it the
suspicion of a personality not intended.</p>

<p>For a moment Calhoun writhed under the awkward misconception
of the auditory; but only for a moment.  He was not the man to
succumb to an unlucky accident of speech.  On the contrary, he
perceived the chance of a triumphant reply; and took advantage of
it.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" he drawled out, without appearing to address himself
to any one in particular.  "I was not aware that mustangs were so
dangerous in these parts."</p>

<p>As Calhoun said this, he was not looking at Louise Poindexter
or he might have detected in her eye a glance to gratify him.</p>

<p>The young Creole, despite an apparent coolness towards him,
could not withhold admiration at anything that showed cleverness.
His case might not be so hopeless?</p>

<p>The young dragoon, Hancock, did not think it so; nor yet the
lieutenant of rifles.  Both observed the approving look, and both
became imbued with the belief that Cassius Calhoun had&mdash;or
might have&mdash;in his keeping, the happiness of his cousin.</p>

<p>The conjecture gave a secret chagrin to both, but especially
to the dragoon.</p>

<p>There was but short time for him to reflect upon it; the
manada was drawing near.</p>

<p>"To the saddle!" was the thought upon every mind, and the cry
upon every tongue.</p>

<br>
<div align="center">

</div>
<br>

<p>The bit was rudely inserted between teeth still industriously
grinding the yellow corn; the bridle drawn over shoulders yet
smoking after the quick skurry of twenty miles through the close
atmosphere of a tropical morn; and, before a hundred could have
been deliberately counted, every one, ladies and gentlemen alike,
was in the stirrup, ready to ply whip and spur.</p>

<p>By this time the wild mares appeared coming over the crest of
the ridge upon which the vidette had been stationed.  He, himself
a horse-catcher by trade, was already mounted, and in their
midst&mdash;endeavouring to fling his lazo over one of the herd.
They were going at mad gallop, as if fleeing from a
pursuer&mdash;some dreaded creature that was causing them to
"whigher" and snort!  With their eyes strained to the rear, they
saw neither the sumpter waggon, nor the equestrians clustering
around it, but were continuing onward to the spot; which chanced
to lie directly in the line of their flight.</p>

<p>"They are chased!" remarked Maurice, observing the excited
action of the animals.</p>

<p>"What is it, Crespino?" he cried out to the Mexican, who, from
his position, must have seen any pursuer that might be after
them.</p>

<p>There was a momentary pause, as the party awaited the
response.  In the crowd were countenances that betrayed
uneasiness, some even alarm.  It might be Indians who were in
pursuit of the mustangs!</p>

<p>"<i>Un asino cimmaron</i>!" was the phrase that came from the
mouth of the Mexican, though by no means terminating the suspense
of the picknickers. "<i>Un macho</i>!" he added.</p>

<p>"Oh!  That's it!  I thought it was!" muttered Maurice.  "The
rascal must be stopped, or he'll spoil our sport.  So long as
he's after them, they'll not make halt this side the sky line. Is
the macho coming on?"</p>

<p>"Close at hand, Don Mauricio.  Making straight for
myself."</p>

<p>"Fling your rope over him, if you can.  If not, cripple him
with a shot&mdash;anything to put an end to his capers."</p>

<p>The character of the pursuer was still a mystery to most, if
not all, upon the ground: for only the mustanger knew the exact
signification of the phrases&mdash;"un asino cimmaron," "un
macho."</p>

<p>"Explain, Maurice!" commanded the major.  "Look yonder!"
replied the young Irishman, pointing to the top of the hill.</p>

<p>The two words were sufficient.  All eyes became directed
towards the crest of the ridge, where an animal, usually regarded
as the type of slowness and stupidity, was seen advancing with
the swiftness of a bird upon the wing.</p>

<p>But very different is the "asino cimmaron" from the ass of
civilisation&mdash;the donkey be-cudgelled into stolidity.</p>

<p>The one now in sight was a male, almost as large as any of the
mustangs it was chasing; and if not fleet as the fleetest, still
able to keep up with them by the sheer pertinacity of its
pursuit!</p>

<p>The tableau of nature, thus presented on the green surface of
the prairie, was as promptly produced as it could have been upon
the stage of a theatre, or the arena of a hippodrome.</p>

<p>Scarce a score of words had passed among the spectators,
before the wild mares were close up to them; and then, as if for
the first time, perceiving the mounted party, they seemed to
forget their dreaded pursuer, and shied off in a slanting
direction.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen!" shouted the guide to a score of
people, endeavouring to restrain their steeds; "keep your places,
if you can.  I know where the herd has its haunt.  They are
heading towards it now; and we shall find them again, with a
better chance of a chase.  If you pursue them at this moment,
they'll scatter into yonder chapparal; and ten to one if we ever
more get sight of them.</p>

<p>"Hola, Señor Crespino!  Send your bullet through that brute.
He's near enough for your <i>escopette</i>, is he not?"</p>

<p>The Mexican, detaching a short gun&mdash;"escopeta"&mdash;from
his saddle-flap, and hastily bringing its butt to his shoulder,
fired at the wild ass.</p>

<p>The animal brayed on hearing the report; but only as if in
defiance.  He was evidently untouched.  Crespino's bullet had not
been truly aimed.</p>

<p>"I must stop him!" exclaimed Maurice, "or the mares will run
on till the end of daylight."</p>

<p>As the mustanger spoke, he struck the spur sharply into the
flanks of his horse.  Like an arrow projected from its bow,
Castro shot off in pursuit of the jackass, now galloping
regardlessly past.</p>

<p>Half a dozen springs of the blood bay, guided in a diagonal
direction, brought his rider within casting distance; and like a
flash of lightning, the loop of the lazo was seen descending over
the long ears.</p>

<p>On launching it, the mustanger halted, and made a half-wheel
&mdash;the horse going round as upon a pivot; and with like
mechanical obedience to the will of his rider, bracing himself
for the expected pluck.</p>

<p>There was a short interval of intense expectation, as the wild
ass, careering onward, took up the slack of the rope.  Then the
animal was seen to rise erect on its hind legs, and fall heavily
backward upon the sward&mdash;where it lay motionless, and
apparently as dead, as if shot through the heart!</p>

<p>It was only stunned, however, by the shock, and the quick
tightening of the loop causing temporary strangulation; which the
Mexican mustanger prolonged to eternity, by drawing his sharp-
edged <i>machete</i> across its throat.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE incident caused a postponement of the chase.
All awaited the action of the guide; who, after "throwing" the
macho, had dismounted to recover his lazo.</p>

<p>He had succeeded in releasing the rope from the neck of the
prostrate animal, when he was seen to coil it up with a quickness
that betokened some new cause of excitement&mdash;at the same
time that he ran to regain his saddle.</p>

<p>Only a few of the others&mdash;most being fully occupied with
their own excited steeds&mdash;observed this show of haste on the
part of the mustanger.  Those who did, saw it with surprise.  He
had counselled patience in the pursuit.  They could perceive no
cause for the eccentric change of tactics, unless it was that
Louise Poindexter, mounted on the spotted mustang, had suddenly
separated from the company, and was galloping off after the wild
mares, as if resolved on being foremost of the field!</p>

<p>But the hunter of wild horses had not construed her conduct in
this sense.  That uncourteous start could scarce be an
intention&mdash;except on the part of the spotted mustang?
Maurice had recognised the manada, as the same from which he had
himself captured it: and, no doubt, with the design of rejoining
its old associates, it was running away with its rider!</p>

<p>So believed the guide; and the belief became instantly
universal.</p>

<p>Stirred by gallantry, half the field spurred off in pursuit.
Calhoun, Hancock, and Crossman leading, with half a score of
young planters, lawyers, and legislators close
following&mdash;each as he rode off reflecting to himself, what a
bit of luck it would be to bring up the runaway.</p>

<p>But few, if any, of the gentlemen felt actual alarm.  All knew
that Louise Poindexter was a splendid equestrian; a spacious
plain lay before her, smooth as a race-track; the mustang might
gallop till it tired itself down; it could not throw her; there
could be little chance of her receiving any serious injury?</p>

<p>There was one who did not entertain this confident view.  It
was he who had been the first to show anxiety&mdash;the mustanger
himself.</p>

<p>He was the last to leave the ground.  Delayed in the
rearrangement of his lazo&mdash;a moment more in
remounting&mdash;he was a hundred paces behind every competitor,
as his horse sprang forward upon the pursuit.</p>

<p>Calhoun was a like distance in the lead, pressing on with all
the desperate energy of his nature, and all the speed he could
extract from the heels of his horse.  The dragoon and rifleman
were a little in his rear; and then came the "ruck."</p>

<p>Maurice soon passed through the thick of the field, overlapped
the leaders one by one; and forging still further ahead, showed
Cassius Calhoun the heels of his horse.</p>

<p>A muttered curse was sent hissing through the teeth of the ex-
officer of volunteers, as the blood bay, bounding past, concealed
from his sight the receding form of the spotted mustang.</p>

<p>The sun, looking down from the zenith, gave light to a
singular tableau. A herd of wild mares going at reckless speed
across the prairie; one of their own kind, with a lady upon its
back, following about four hundred yards behind; at a like
distance after the lady, a steed of red bay colour, bestridden by
a cavalier picturesquely attired, and apparently intent upon
overtaking her; still further to the rear a string of mounted
men&mdash;some in civil, some in military, garb; behind these a
troop of dragoons going at full gallop, having just parted from a
mixed group of ladies and gentlemen&mdash;also mounted, but
motionless, on the plain, or only stirring around the same spot
with excited gesticulations!</p>

<p>In twenty minutes the tableau was changed.  The same
personages were upon the stage&mdash;the grand <i>tapis vert</i>
of the prairie&mdash;but the grouping was different, or, at all
events, the groups were more widely apart. The manada had gained
distance upon the spotted mustang; the mustang upon the blood
bay; and the blood bay&mdash;ah! his competitors were no longer
in sight, or could only have been seen by the far-piercing eye of
the <i>caracara</i>, soaring high in the sapphire heavens.</p>

<p>The wild mares&mdash;the mustang and its rider&mdash;the red
horse, and his&mdash;had the savanna to themselves!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER FIFTEEN.<br>

THE RUNAWAY OVERTAKEN.</h2>

<p class="first">
FOR another mile the chase continued, without much change. The
mares still swept on in full flight, though no longer screaming
or in fear. The mustang still uttered an occasional neigh, which
its old associates seemed not to notice; while its rider held her
seat in the saddle unshaken, and without any apparent alarm.</p>

<p>The blood bay appeared more excited, though not so much as his
master; who was beginning to show signs either of despondency or
chagrin.</p>

<p>"Come, Castro!" he exclaimed, with a certain spitefulness of
tone. "What the deuce is the matter with your heels&mdash;to-day
of all others? Remember, you overtook her before&mdash;though not
so easily, I admit.  But now she's weighted.  Look yonder, you
dull brute!  Weighted with that which is worth more than
gold&mdash;worth every drop of your blood, and mine too.  The
yegua pinta seems to have improved her paces.  Is it from
training; or does a horse run faster when ridden?</p>

<p>"What if I lose sight of her?  In truth, it begins to look
queer!  It would be an awkward situation for the young lady.
Worse than that&mdash; there's danger in it&mdash;real danger. If
I should lose sight of her, she'd be in trouble to a
certainty!"</p>

<p>Thus muttering, Maurice rode on: his eyes now fixed upon the
form still flitting away before him; at intervals interrogating,
with uneasy glances, the space that separated him from it.</p>

<p>Up to this time he had not thought of hailing the rider of the
runaway.</p>

<p>His shouts might have been heard; but no words of warning, or
instruction.  He had refrained: partly on this account; partly
because he was in momentary expectation of overtaking her; and
partly because he knew that acts, not words, were wanted to bring
the mustang to a stand.</p>

<p>All along he had been flattering himself that he would soon be
near enough to fling his lazo over the creature's neck, and
control it at discretion.  He was gradually becoming relieved of
this hallucination.</p>

<p>The chase now entered among copses that thickly studded the
plain, fast closing into a continuous chapparal.  This was a new
source of uneasiness to the pursuer.  The runaway might take to
the thicket, or become lost to his view amid the windings of the
wood.</p>

<p>The wild mares were already invisible&mdash;at intervals. They
would soon be out of sight altogether.  There seemed no chance of
their old associate overtaking them.</p>

<p>"What mattered that?  A lady lost on a prairie, or in a
chapparal&mdash; alone, or in the midst of a manada&mdash;either
contingency pointed to certain danger."</p>

<p>A still more startling peril suggested itself to the mind of
the mustanger&mdash;so startling as to find expression in excited
speech.</p>

<p>"By heavens!" he ejaculated, his brow becoming more clouded
than it had been from his first entering upon the chase.  "<i>If
the stallions should chance this way</i>!  'Tis their favourite
stamping ground among these mottos.  They were here but a week
ago; and this&mdash;yes&mdash;'tis the month of their
madness!"</p>

<p>The spur of the mustanger again drew blood, till its rowels
were red; and Castro, galloping at his utmost speed, glanced back
upbraidingly over his shoulder.</p>

<p>At this crisis the manada disappeared from, the sight both of
the blood-bay and his master; and most probably at the same time
from that of the spotted mustang and its rider.  There was
nothing mysterious in it.  The mares had entered between the
closing of two copses, where the shrubbery hid them from
view.</p>

<p>The effect produced upon the runaway appeared to proceed from
some magical influence.  As if their disappearance was a signal
for discontinuing the chase, it suddenly slackened pace; and the
instant after came to a standstill!</p>

<p>Maurice, continuing his gallop, came up with it in the middle
of a meadow-like glade&mdash;standing motionless as
marble&mdash;its rider, reins in hand, sitting silent in the
saddle, in an attitude of easy elegance, as if waiting for him to
ride up!</p>

<p>"Miss Poindexter!" he gasped out, as he spurred his steed
within speaking distance: "I am glad that you have recovered
command of that wild creature.  I was beginning to be alarmed
about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About what, sir?" was the question that startled the
mustanger.</p>

<p>"Your safety&mdash;of course," he replied, somewhat
stammeringly.  "Oh, thank you, Mr Gerald; but I was not aware of
having been in any danger.  Was I really so?"</p>

<p>"Any danger!" echoed the Irishman, with increased
astonishment.  "On the back of a runaway mustang&mdash;in the
middle of a pathless prairie!"</p>

<p>"And what of that?  The thing couldn't throw me.  I'm too
clever in the saddle, sir."</p>

<p>"I know it, madame; but that accomplishment would have availed
you very little had you lost yourself, a thing you were like
enough to have done among these chapparal copses, where the
oldest Texan can scarce find his way."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;<i>lost myself</i>!  That was the danger to be
dreaded?"</p>

<p>"There are others, besides.  Suppose you had fallen in
with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Indians!" interrupted the lady, without waiting for the
mustanger to finish his hypothetical speech.  "And if I had, what
would it have mattered?  Are not the Comanches <i>en paz</i> at
present?  Surely they wouldn't have molested me, gallant fellows
as they are?  So the major told us, as we came along.  'Pon my
word, sir, I should seek, rather than shun, such an encounter.  I
wish to see the noble savage on his native prairie, and on
horseback; not, as I've hitherto beheld him, reeling around the
settlements in a state of debasement from too freely partaking of
our fire-water."</p>

<p>"I admire your courage, miss; but if I had the honour of being
one of your friends, I should take the liberty of counselling a
little caution. The 'noble savage' you speak of, is not always
sober upon the prairies; and perhaps not so very gallant as
you've been led to believe.  If you had met him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I had met him, and he had attempted to misbehave himself,
I would have given him the go-by, and ridden, straight back to my
friends.  On such a swift creature as this, he must have been
well mounted to have overtaken me.  You found some
difficulty&mdash;did you not?"</p>

<p>The eyes of the young Irishman, already showing astonishment,
became expanded to increased dimensions&mdash;surprise and
incredulity being equally blended in their glance.</p>

<p>"But," said he, after a speechless pause, "you don't mean to
say that you could have controlled&mdash;that the mustang was not
running away with you?  Am I to understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no!" hastily rejoined the fair equestrian,
showing some slight embarrassment.  "The mare certainly made off
with me&mdash;that is, at the first&mdash;but I&mdash;I found,
that is&mdash;at the last&mdash;I found I could easily pull her
up.  In fact I did so: you saw it?"</p>

<p>"And could you have done it sooner?"</p>

<p>A strange thought had suggested the interrogatory; and with
more than ordinary interest the questioner awaited the reply.</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I might; no doubt, if I had
dragged a little harder upon the rein.  But you see, sir, I like
a good gallop&mdash;especially upon a prairie, where there's no
fear of running over pigs, poultry, or people."</p>

<p>Maurice looked amaze.  In all his experience&mdash;even in his
own native land, famed for feminine <i>braverie</i>&mdash;above
all in the way of bold riding&mdash;he had met no match for the
clever equestrian before him.</p>

<p>His astonishment, mixed with admiration, hindered him from
making a ready rejoinder.</p>

<p>"To speak truth," continued the young lady, with an air of
charming simplicity, "I was not sorry at being run off with.  One
sometimes gets tired of too much talk&mdash;of the kind called
complimentary.  I wanted fresh air, and to be alone.  So you
<i>see</i>, Mr Gerald, it was rather a bit of good fortune: since
it saved explanations and adieus."</p>

<p>"You wanted to be alone?" responded the mustanger, with a
disappointed look.  "I am sorry I should have made the mistake to
have intruded upon you.  I assure you, Miss Poindexter, I
followed, because I believed you to be in danger."</p>

<p>"Most gallant of you, sir; and now that I know there
<i>was</i> danger, I am truly grateful.  I presume I have guessed
aright: you meant the Indians?"</p>

<p>"No; not Indians exactly&mdash;at least, it was not of them I
was thinking."</p>

<p>"Some other danger?  What is it, sir?  You will tell me, so
that I may be more cautious for the future?"</p>

<p>Maurice did not make immediate answer.  A sound striking upon
his ear had caused him to turn away&mdash;as if inattentive to
the interrogatory.</p>

<p>The Creole, perceiving there was some cause for his
abstraction, likewise assumed a listening attitude.  She heard a
shrill scream, succeeded by another and another, close followed
by a loud hammering of hoofs&mdash;the conjunction of sounds
causing the still atmosphere to vibrate around her.</p>

<p>It was no mystery to the hunter of horses.  The words that
came quick from his lips&mdash;though not designed&mdash;were a
direct answer to the question she had put.</p>

<p>"<i>The wild stallions</i>!" he exclaimed, in a tone that
betokened alarm. "I knew they must be among those mottes; and
they are!"</p>

<p>"Is that the danger of which you have been speaking?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"What fear of them?  They are only mustangs!"</p>

<p>"True, and at other times there is no cause to fear them.  But
just now, at this season of the year, they become as savage as
tigers, and equally as vindictive.  Ah! the wild steed in his
rage is an enemy more to be dreaded than wolf, panther, or
bear."</p>

<p>"What are we to do?" inquired the young lady, now, for the
first time, giving proof that she felt fear&mdash;by riding close
up to the man who had once before rescued her from a situation of
peril, and gazing anxiously in his face, as she awaited the
answer.</p>

<p>"If they should charge upon us," answered Maurice, "there are
but two ways of escape.  One, by ascending a tree, and abandoning
our horses to their fury."</p>

<p>"The other?" asked the Creole, with a <i>sang froid</i> that
showed a presence of mind likely to stand the test of the most
exciting crisis. "Anything but abandon our animals!  'Twould be
but a shabby way of making our escape!"</p>

<p>"We shall not have an opportunity of trying it, I perceive it
is impracticable.  There's not a tree within sight large enough
to afford us security.  If attacked, we have no alternative but
to trust to the fleetness of our horses.  Unfortunately,"
continued he, with a glance of inspection towards the spotted
mare, and then at his own horse, "they've had too much work this
morning.  Both are badly blown.  That will be our greatest source
of danger.  The wild steeds are sure to be fresh."</p>

<p>"Do you intend us to start now?"</p>

<p>"Not yet.  The longer we can breathe our animals the better.
The stallions may not come this way; or if so, may not molest us.
It will depend on their mood at the moment.  If battling among
themselves, we may look out for their attack.  Then they have
lost their reason&mdash;if I may so speak&mdash;and will
recklessly rush upon one of their own kind&mdash;even with a man
upon his back.  Ha! 'tis as I expected: they are in conflict. I
can tell by their cries!  And driving this way, too!"</p>

<p>"But, Mr Gerald; why should we not ride off at once, in the
opposite direction?"</p>

<p>"'Twould be of no use.  There's no cover to conceal us, on
that side&mdash; nothing but open plain.  They'll be out upon it
before we could get a sufficient start, and would soon overtake
us.  The place we must make for&mdash;the only safe one I can
think of&mdash;lies the other way.  They are now upon the direct
path to it, if I can judge by what I hear; and, if we start too
soon, we may ride into their teeth.  We must wait, and try to
steal away behind them.  If we succeed in getting past, and can
keep our distance for a two-mile gallop, I know a spot, where we
shall be as safe as if inside the corrals of Casa del Corvo.  You
are sure you can control the mustang?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure," was the prompt reply: all idea of deception
being abandoned in presence of the threatening peril.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER SIXTEEN.<br>

CHASED BY WILD STALLIONS.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE two sat expectant in their saddles&mdash;she, apparently,
with more confidence than he: for she confided in him.  Still but
imperfectly comprehending it, she knew there must be some great
danger.  When such a man showed sign of fear, it could not be
otherwise.  She had a secret happiness in thinking: that a
portion of this fear was for her own safety.</p>

<p>"I think we may venture now;" said her companion, after a
short period spent in listening; "they appear to have passed the
opening by which we must make our retreat.  Look well to your
riding, I entreat you!  Keep a firm seat in the saddle, and a
sure hold of the rein.  Gallop by my side, where the ground will
admit of it; but in no case let more than the length of my
horse's tail be between us.  I must perforce go ahead to guide
the way.  Ha! they are coming direct for the glade.  They're
already close to its edge.  Our time is up!"</p>

<p>The profound stillness that but a short while before pervaded
the prairie, no longer reigned over it.  In its stead had arisen
a fracas that resembled the outpouring of some overcrowded
asylum; for in the shrill neighing of the steeds might have been
fancied the screams of maniacs&mdash;only ten times more
vociferous.  They were mingled with a thunder-like hammering of
hoofs&mdash;a swishing and crashing of branches&mdash; savage
snorts, accompanied by the sharp snapping of teeth&mdash;the dull
"thud" of heels coming in contact with ribs and rounded
hips&mdash;squealing that betokened spite or pain&mdash;all
forming a combination of sounds that jarred harshly upon the ear,
and caused the earth to quake, as if oscillating upon its
orbit!</p>

<p>It told of a terrible conflict carried on by the wild
stallions; who, still unseen, were fighting indiscriminately
among themselves, as they held their way among the mottes.</p>

<p>Not much longer unseen.  As Maurice gave the signal to start,
the speckled crowd showed itself in an opening between two
copses.  In a moment more it filled the gangway-like gap, and
commenced disgorging into the glade, with the impetus of an
avalanche!</p>

<p>It was composed of living forms&mdash;the most beautiful known
in nature: for in this man must give way to the horse.  Not the
unsexed horse of civilisation, with hunched shoulders, bandied
limbs, and bowed frontlet&mdash;scarce one in a thousand of true
equine shape&mdash;and this, still further, mutilated by the
shears of the coper and gentleman jockey&mdash;but the wild steed
of the savannas, foaled upon the green grass, his form left free
to develop as the flowers that shed their fragrance around
him.</p>

<p>Eye never beheld a more splendid sight than a <i>cavallada</i>
of wild stallions, prancing upon a prairie; especially at that
season when, stirred by strong passions, they seek to destroy one
another.  The spectacle is more than splendid&mdash;it is
fearful&mdash;too fearful to be enjoyed by man, much less by
timid woman.  Still more when the spectator views it from an
exposed position, liable to become the object of their
attack.</p>

<p>In such situation were the riders of the blood bay and spotted
mustang. The former knew it by past experience&mdash;the latter
could not fail to perceive it by the evidence before her.</p>

<p>"This way!" cried Maurice, lancing his horse's flanks with the
spur, and bending so as to oblique to the rear of the
cavallada.</p>

<p>"By heaven&mdash;they've discovered us!  On&mdash;on!  Miss
Poindexter!  Remember you are riding for your life!"</p>

<p>The stimulus of speech was not needed.  The behaviour of the
stallions was of itself sufficient to show, that speed alone
could save the spotted mustang and its rider.</p>

<p>On coming out into the open ground, and getting sight of the
ridden horses, they had suddenly desisted from their internecine
strife; and, as if acting under the orders of some skilled
leader, come to a halt. In line, too, like cavalry checked up in
the middle of a charge!</p>

<p>For a time their mutual hostility seemed to be laid
aside&mdash;as if they felt called upon to attack a common enemy,
or resist some common danger!</p>

<p>The pause may have proceeded from surprise; but, whether or
no, it was favourable to the fugitives.  During the twenty
seconds it continued, the latter had made good use of their time,
and accomplished the circuit required to put them on the path of
safety.</p>

<p>Only on the path, however.  Their escape was still
problematical: for the steeds, perceiving their intention,
wheeled suddenly into the line of pursuit, and went galloping
after, with snorts and screams that betrayed a spiteful
determination to overtake them.</p>

<p>From that moment it became a straight unchanging chase across
country&mdash;a trial of speed between the horses without riders,
and the horses that were ridden.</p>

<p>At intervals did Maurice carry his chin to his shoulder; and
though still preserving the distance gained at the start, his
look was not the less one of apprehension.</p>

<p>Alone he would have laughed to scorn his pursuers.  He knew
that the blood-bay&mdash;himself a prairie steed&mdash;could
surpass any competitor of his race.  But the mare was delaying
him.  She was galloping slower than he had ever seen her&mdash;as
if unwilling, or not coveting escape&mdash;like a horse with his
head turned away from home!</p>

<p>"What can it mean?" muttered the mustanger, as he checked his
pace, to accommodate it to that of his companion.  "If there
should be any baulk at the crossing, we're lost!  A score of
seconds will make the difference."</p>

<p>"We keep our distance, don't we?" inquired his fellow-
fugitive, noticing his troubled look.</p>

<p>"So far, yes.  Unfortunately there's an obstruction ahead.  It
remains to be seen how we shall get over it.  I know you are a
clever rider, and can take a long leap.  But your mount?  I'm not
so sure of the mare. You know her better than I.  Do you think
she can carry you over&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Over what, sir?"</p>

<p>"You'll see in a second.  We should be near the place
now."</p>

<p>The conversation thus carried on was between two individuals
riding side by side, and going at a gallop of nearly a mile to
the minute!</p>

<p>As the guide had predicted, they soon came within sight of the
obstruction; which proved to be an arroyo&mdash;a yawning fissure
in the plain full fifteen feet in width, as many in depth, and
trending on each side to the verge of vision.</p>

<p>To turn aside, either to the right or left, would be to give
the pursuers the advantage of the diagonal; which the fugitives
could no longer afford.</p>

<p>The chasm must be crossed, or the stallions would overtake
them.</p>

<p>It could only be crossed by a leap&mdash;fifteen feet at the
least.  Maurice knew that his own horse could go over it&mdash;he
had done it before.  But the mare?</p>

<p>"Do you think she can do it?" he eagerly asked, as, in
slackened pace, they approached the edge of the barranca.</p>

<p>"I am sure she can," was the confident reply.</p>

<p>"But are you sure you can sit her over it?"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" scornfully laughed the Creole.  "What a question
for an Irishman to ask!  I'm sure, sir, one of your own
countrywomen would be offended at your speech.  Even I, a native
of swampy Louisiana, don't regard it as at all gallant.  Sit her
over it!  Sit her anywhere she can carry me."</p>

<p>"But, Miss Poindexter," stammered the guide, still doubting
the powers of the spotted mustang, "suppose she cannot?  If you
have any doubts, had you not better abandon her?  I know that my
horse can bear us both to the other side, and with safety.  If
the mustang be left behind, in all likelihood we shall escape
further pursuit.  The wild steeds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leave Luna behind!  Leave her to be trampled to death, or
torn to pieces&mdash;as you say she would!  No&mdash;no, Mr
Gerald.  I prize the spotted mare too much for that.  She goes
with me: over the chasm, if we can. If not, we both break our
necks at the bottom.  Come, my pretty pet! This is he who chased,
captured, and conquered you.  Show him you're not yet so
<i>subdued</i>, but that you can escape, when close pressed, from
the toils of either friend or enemy.  Show him one of those
leaps, of which you've done a dozen within the week.  Now for a
flight in the air!"</p>

<p>Without even waiting for the stimulus of example, the
courageous Creole rode recklessly at the arroyo; and cleared it
by one of those leaps of which she had "done a dozen within the
week."</p>

<p>There were three thoughts in the mind of the
mustanger&mdash;rather might they be called emotions&mdash;as he
sate watching that leap.  The first was simple astonishment; the
second, intense admiration.  The third was not so easily defined.
It had its origin in the words&mdash;"<i>I prize the spotted mare
too much for that</i>."</p>

<p>"Why?" reflected he, as he drove his spur-rowels into the
flanks of the blood bay; and the reflection lasted as long as
Castro was suspended in mid-air over the yawning abysm.</p>

<p>Cleverly as the chasm was crossed, it did not ensure the
safety of the fugitives.  It would be no obstruction to the
steeds.  Maurice knew it, and looked back with undiminished
apprehension.</p>

<p>Rather was it increased.  The delay, short as it was, had
given the pursuers an advantage.  They were nearer than ever!
They would not be likely to make a moment's pause, but clear the
crevasse at a single bound of their sure-footed gallop.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;what then?</p>

<p>The mustanger put the question to himself.  He grew paler, as
the reply puzzled him.</p>

<p>On alighting from the leap, he had not paused for a second,
but gone galloping on&mdash;as before, close followed by his
fugitive companion.  His pace, however, was less impetuous.  He
seemed to ride with irresolution, or as if some half-formed
resolve was restraining him.</p>

<p>When about a score lengths from the edge of the arroyo, he
reined up and wheeled round&mdash;as if he had suddenly formed
the determination to ride back!</p>

<p>"Miss Poindexter!" he called out to the young lady, at that
moment just up with him.  "You must ride on alone."</p>

<p>"But why, sir?" asked she, as she jerked the muzzle of the
mustang close up to its counter, bringing it almost
instantaneously to a stand.</p>

<p>"If we keep together we shall be overtaken.  I must do
something to stay those savage brutes.  Here there is a
chance&mdash;nowhere else.  For heaven's sake don't question me!
Ten seconds of lost time, and 'twill be too late.  Look ahead
yonder.  You perceive the sheen of water.  'Tis a prairie pond.
Ride straight towards it.  You will find yourself between two
high fences.  They come together at the pond.  You'll see a gap,
with bars.  If I'm not up in time, gallop through, dismount, and
put the bars up behind you."</p>

<p>"And you, sir?  You are going to undergo some great
danger?"</p>

<p>"Have no fear for me!  Alone, I shall run but little risk.
'Tis the mustang.&mdash;For mercy's sake, gallop forward!  Keep
the water under your eyes.  Let it guide you like a beacon fire.
Remember to close the gap behind you.  Away&mdash;away!"</p>

<p>For a second or two the young lady appeared
irresolute&mdash;as if reluctant to part company with the man who
was making such efforts to ensure her safety&mdash;perhaps at the
peril of his own.</p>

<p>By good fortune she was not one of those timid maidens who
turn frantic at a crisis, and drag to the bottom the swimmer who
would save them. She had faith in the capability of her
counsellor&mdash;believed that he knew what he was
about&mdash;and, once more spurring the mare into a gallop, she
rode off in a direct line for the prairie pond.</p>

<p>At the same instant, Maurice had given the rein to his horse,
and was riding in the opposite direction&mdash;back to the place
where they had leaped the arroyo!</p>

<p>On parting from his companion, he had drawn from his saddle
holster the finest weapon ever wielded upon the
prairies&mdash;either for attack or defence, against Indian,
buffalo, or bear.  It was the six-chambered revolver of Colonel
Colt&mdash;not the spurious <i>improvement</i> of Deane, Adams,
and a host of retrograde imitators&mdash;but the genuine article
from the "land of wooden nutmegs," with the Hartford brand upon
its breech.</p>

<p>"They must get over the narrow place where we crossed,"
muttered he, as he faced towards the stallions, still advancing
on the other side of the arroyo.</p>

<p>"If I can but fling one of them in his tracks, it may hinder
the others from attempting the leap; or delay them&mdash;long
enough for the mustang to make its escape.  The big sorrel is
leading.  He will make the spring first.  The pistol's good for a
hundred paces.  He's within range now!"</p>

<p>Simultaneous with the last words came the crack of the six-
shooter.  The largest of the stallions&mdash;a sorrel in
colour&mdash;rolled headlong upon the sward; his carcass falling
transversely across the line that led to the leap.</p>

<p>Half-a-dozen others, close following, were instantly brought
to a stand; and then the whole cavallada!</p>

<p>The mustanger stayed not to note their movements.  Taking
advantage of the confusion caused by the fall of their leader, he
reserved the fire of the other five chambers; and, wheeling to
the west, spurred on after the spotted mustang, now far on its
way towards the glistening pond.</p>

<p>Whether dismayed by the fall of their chief&mdash;or whether
it was that his dead body had hindered them from approaching the
only place where the chasm could have been cleared at a
leap&mdash;the stallions abandoned the pursuit; and Maurice had
the prairie to himself as he swept on after his fellow
fugitive.</p>

<p>He overtook her beyond the convergence of the fences on the
shore of the pond.  She had obeyed him in everything&mdash;except
as to the closing of the gap.  He found it open&mdash;the bars
lying scattered over the ground.  He found her still seated in
the saddle, relieved from all apprehension for his safety, and
only trembling with a gratitude that longed to find expression in
speech.</p>

<p>The peril was passed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.<br>

THE MUSTANG TRAP.</h2>

<p class="first">
NO longer in dread of any danger, the young Creole looked
interrogatively around her.</p>

<p>There was a small lake&mdash;in Texan phraseology a
"pond"&mdash;with countless horse-tracks visible along its
shores, proving that the place was frequented by wild
horses&mdash;their excessive number showing it to be a favourite
watering place.  There was a high rail fence&mdash;constructed so
as to enclose the pond, and a portion of the contiguous prairie,
with two diverging wings, carried far across the plain, forming a
funnel-shaped approach to a gap; which, when its bars were up,
completed an enclosure that no horse could either enter or escape
from.</p>

<p>"What is it for?" inquired the lady, indicating the
construction of split rails.</p>

<p>"A mustang trap," said Maurice.</p>

<p>"A mustang trap?"</p>

<p>"A contrivance for catching wild horses.  They stray between
the <i>wings</i>; which, as you perceive, are carried far out
upon the plain. The water attracts them; or they are driven
towards it by a band of mustangers who follow, and force them on
through the gap.  Once within the <i>corral</i>, there is no
trouble in taking them.  They are then lazoed at leisure."</p>

<p>"Poor things!  Is it yours?  You are a mustanger?  You told us
so?"</p>

<p>"I am; but I do not hunt the wild horse in this way.  I prefer
being alone, and rarely consort with men of my calling. Therefore
I could not make use of this contrivance, which requires at least
a score of drivers.  My weapon, if I may dignify it by the name,
is this&mdash;the lazo."</p>

<p>"You use it with great skill?  I've heard that you do; besides
having myself witnessed the proof."</p>

<p>"It is complimentary of you to say so.  But you are mistaken.
There are men on these prairies 'to the manner
born'&mdash;Mexicans&mdash;who regard, what you are pleased to
call skill, as sheer clumsiness."</p>

<p>"Are you sure, Mr Gerald, that your modesty is not prompting
<i>you</i> to overrate your rivals?  I have been told the very
opposite."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"Your friend, Mr Zebulon Stump."</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha!  Old Zeb is but indifferent authority on the
subject of the lazo."</p>

<p>"I wish I could throw the lazo," said the young Creole.  "They
tell me 'tis not a lady-like accomplishment.  What
matters&mdash;so long as it is innocent, and gives one a
gratification?"</p>

<p>"Not lady-like!  Surely 'tis as much so as archery, or
skating?  I know a lady who is very expert at it."</p>

<p>"An American lady?"</p>

<p>"No; she's Mexican, and lives on the Rio Grande; but sometimes
comes across to the Leona&mdash;where she has relatives."</p>

<p>"A young lady?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  About your own age, I should think, Miss
Poindexter."</p>

<p>"Size?"</p>

<p>"Not so tall as you."</p>

<p>"But much prettier, of course?  The Mexican ladies, I've
heard, in the matter of good looks, far surpass us plain
<i>Americanos</i>."</p>

<p>"I think Creoles are not included in that category," was the
reply, worthy of one whose lips had been in contact with the
famed boulder of Blarney.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I could ever learn to fling it?" pursued the
young Creole, pretending not to have been affected by the
complimentary remark.  "Am I too old?  I've been told that the
Mexicans commence almost in childhood; that that is why they
attain to such wonderful skill?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Maurice, encouragingly.  "'Tis possible,
with a year or two's practice, to become a proficient lazoer.  I,
myself, have only been three years at; and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, perceiving he was about to commit himself to a
little boasting.</p>

<p>"And you are now the most skilled in all Texas?" said his
companion, supplying the presumed finale of his speech.</p>

<p>"No, no!" laughingly rejoined he.  "That is but a mistaken
belief on the part of Zeb Stump, who judges my skill by
comparison, making use of his own as a standard."</p>

<p>"Is it modesty?" reflected the Creole.  "Or is this man
mocking me?  If I thought so, I should go mad!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are anxious to get back to your party?" said
Maurice, observing her abstracted air.  "Your father may be
alarmed by your long absence?  Your brother&mdash;your
cousin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, true!" she hurriedly rejoined, in a tone that betrayed
either pique, or compunction.  "I was not thinking of that.
Thanks, sir, for reminding me of my duty.  Let us go back!"</p>

<p>Again in the saddle, she gathered up her reins, and plied her
tiny spur&mdash;both acts being performed with an air of languid
reluctance, as if she would have preferred lingering a little
longer in the "mustang trap."</p>

<p>Once more upon the prairie, Maurice conducted his protegee by
the most direct route towards the spot where they had parted from
the picnic party.</p>

<p>Their backward way led them across a peculiar tract of
country&mdash;what in Texas is called a "weed prairie," an
appellation bestowed by the early pioneers, who were not very
choice in their titles.</p>

<p>The Louisianian saw around her a vast garden of gay flowers,
laid out in one grand parterre, whose borders were the blue
circle of the horizon&mdash;a garden designed, planted, nurtured,
by the hand of Nature.</p>

<p>The most plebeian spirit cannot pass through such a scene
without receiving an impression calculated to refine it.  I've
known the illiterate trapper&mdash;habitually blind to the
beautiful&mdash;pause in the midst of his "weed prairie," with
the flowers rising breast high around him, gaze for a while upon
their gaudy corollas waving beyond the verge of his vision; then
continue his silent stride with a gentler feeling towards his
fellow-man, and a firmer faith in the grandeur of his God.</p>

<p>"<i>Pardieu</i>! 'tis very beautiful!" exclaimed the
enthusiastic Creole, reining up as if by an involuntary
instinct.</p>

<p>"You admire these wild scenes, Miss Poindexter?"</p>

<p>"Admire them?  Something more, sir!  I see around me all that
is bright and beautiful in nature: verdant turf, trees, flowers,
all that we take such pains to plant or cultivate; and such, too,
as we never succeed in equalling.  There seems nothing wanting to
make this picture complete&mdash;'tis a park perfect in
everything!"</p>

<p>"Except the mansion?"</p>

<p>"That would spoil it for me.  Give me the landscape where
there is not a house in sight&mdash;slate, chimney, or
tile&mdash;to interfere with the outlines of the trees.  Under
their shadow could I live; under their shadow let me&mdash;"</p>

<p>The word: "love" uppermost in her thoughts&mdash;was upon the
tip of her tongue.</p>

<p>She dexterously restrained herself from pronouncing
it&mdash;changing it to one of very different
signification&mdash;"die."</p>

<p>It was cruel of the young Irishman not to tell her that she
was speaking his own sentiments&mdash;repeating them to the very
echo.  To this was the prairie indebted for his presence.  But
for a kindred inclination&mdash; amounting almost to a
passion&mdash;he might never have been known as <i>Maurice the
mustanger</i>.</p>

<p>The romantic sentiment is not satisfied with a "sham."  It
will soon consume itself, unless supported by the consciousness
of reality.  The mustanger would have been humiliated by the
thought, that he chased the wild horse as a mere pastime&mdash;a
pretext to keep him upon the prairies. At first, he might have
condescended to make such an acknowledgment&mdash;but he had of
late become thoroughly imbued with the pride of the professional
hunter.</p>

<p>His reply might have appeared chillingly prosaic.</p>

<p>"I fear, miss, you would soon tire of such a rude
life&mdash;no roof to shelter you&mdash;no
society&mdash;no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you, sir; how is it <i>you</i> have not grown tired of
it?  If I have been correctly informed&mdash;your friend, Mr
Stump, is my authority&mdash;you've been leading this life for
several years.  Is it so?"</p>

<p>"Quite true: I have no other calling."</p>

<p>"Indeed!  I wish I could say the same.  I envy you your lot.
I'm sure I could enjoy existence amid these beautiful scene for
ever and ever!"</p>

<p>"Alone?  Without companions?  Without even a roof to shelter
you?"</p>

<p>"I did not say that.  But, you've not told me.  How do you
live?  Have <i>you</i> a house?"</p>

<p>"It does not deserve such a high-sounding appellation,"
laughingly replied the mustanger.  "Shed would more correctly
serve for the description of my <i>jacale</i>, which may be
classed among the lowliest in the land."</p>

<p>"Where is it?  Anywhere near where we've been to-day?"</p>

<p>"It is not very far from where we are now.  A mile, perhaps.
You see those tree-tops to the west?  They shade my hovel from
the sun, and shelter it from the storm."</p>

<p>"Indeed!  How I should like to have a look at it!  A real rude
hut, you say?"</p>

<p>"In that I have but spoken the truth."</p>

<p>"Standing solitary?"</p>

<p>"I know of no other within ten miles of it."</p>

<p>"Among trees, and picturesque?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon the eye that beholds it."</p>

<p>"I should like to see it, and judge.  Only a mile you
say?"</p>

<p>"A mile there&mdash;the same to return&mdash;would be
two."</p>

<p>"That's nothing.  It would not take us a score of
minutes."</p>

<p>"Should we not be trespassing on the patience of your
people?"</p>

<p>"On your hospitality, perhaps?  Excuse me, Mr Gerald!"
continued the young lady, a slight shadow suddenly overcasting
her countenance.  "I did not think of it!  Perhaps you do not
live <i>alone</i>?  Some other shares your&mdash;jacale&mdash;as
you call it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have a companion&mdash;one who has been with me
ever since I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The shadow became sensibly darker.</p>

<p>Before the mustanger could finish his speech, his listener had
pictured to herself a certain image, that might answer to the
description of his companion: a girl of her own age&mdash;perhaps
more inclining to <i>embonpoint</i>&mdash;with a skin of chestnut
brown; eyes of almond shade, set piquantly oblique to the lines
of the nose; teeth of more than pearly purity; a tinge of crimson
upon the cheeks; hair like Castro's tail; beads and bangles
around neck, arms, and ankles; a short kirtle elaborately
embroidered; mocassins covering small feet; and fringed leggings,
laced upon limbs of large development.  Such were the style and
equipments of the supposed companion, who had suddenly become
outlined in the imagination of Louise Poindexter.</p>

<p>"Your fellow tenant of the jacale might not like being
intruded upon by visitors&mdash;more especially a stranger?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, he's but too glad to see visitors at any
time&mdash;whether strangers or acquaintances.  My foster-brother
is the last man to shun society; of which, poor fellow! he sees
precious little on the Alamo."</p>

<p>"Your foster-brother?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  Phelim O'Neal by name&mdash;like myself a native of the
Emerald Isle, and shire of Galway; only perhaps speaking a little
better brogue than mine."</p>

<p>"Oh! the Irish brogue.  I should so like to hear it spoken by
a native of Galway.  I am told that theirs is the richest.  Is it
so, Mr Gerald?"</p>

<p>"Being a Galwegian myself, my judgment might not be reliable;
but if you will condescend to accept Phelim's hospitality for
half-an-hour, he will, no doubt, give you an opportunity of
judging for yourself."</p>

<p>"I should be delighted.  'Tis something so new.  Let papa and
the rest of them wait.  There are plenty of ladies without me; or
the gentlemen may amuse themselves by tracing up our tracks.
'Twill be as good a horse hunt as they are likely to have.  Now,
sir, I'm ready to accept your hospitality."</p>

<p>"There's not much to offer you, I fear.  Phelim has been
several days by himself, and as he's but an indifferent hunter,
his larder is likely to be low.  'Tis fortunate you had finished
luncheon before the <i>stampede</i>."</p>

<p>It was not Phelim's larder that was leading Louise Poindexter
out of her way, nor yet the desire to listen to his Connemara
pronunciation.  It was not curiosity to look at the jacale of the
mustanger; but a feeling of a far more irresistible kind, to
which she was yielding, as if she believed it to be her fate!</p>

<br>

<p class="first">SHE paid a visit to the lone hut, on the Alamo;
she entered under its roof; she scanned with seeming interest its
singular <i>penates</i>; and noted, with pleased surprise, the
books, writing materials, and other chattels that betokened the
refinement of its owner; she listened with apparent delight to
the <i>palthogue</i> of the Connemara man, who called her a
"coleen bawn;" she partook of Phelim's
hospitality&mdash;condescendingly tasting of everything offered,
except that which was most urgently pressed upon her, "a dhrap of
the crayther, drawn fresh from the dimmyjan;" and finally made
her departure from the spot, apparently in the highest
spirits.</p>

<p>Alas! her delight was short-lived: lasting only so long as it
was sustained by the excitement of the novel adventure.  As she
recrossed the flower prairie, she found time for making a variety
of reflections; and there was one that chilled her to the very
core of her heart.</p>

<p>Was it the thought that she had been acting wrongly in keeping
her father, her brother, and friends in suspense about her
safety?  Or had she become conscious of playing a part open to
the suspicion of being unfeminine?</p>

<p>Not either.  The cloud that darkened her brow in the midst of
that blossoming brightness, was caused by a different, and far
more distressing, reflection.  During all that day, in the
journey from the fort, after overtaking her in the chase, in the
pursuit while protecting her, lingering by her side on the shore
of the lake, returning across the prairie, under his own humble
roof&mdash;in short everywhere&mdash;her companion had only been
polite&mdash;<i>had only behaved as a gentleman</i>!</p>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.<br>

JEALOUSY UPON THE TRAIL.</h2>

<p class="first">
OF the two-score rescuers, who had started in pursuit of the
runaway, but few followed far.  Having lost sight of the wild
mares, the mustang, and the mustanger, they began to lose sight
of one another; and before long became dispersed upon the
prairie&mdash;going single, in couples, or in groups of three and
four together.  Most of them, unused to tracking up a trail, soon
strayed from that taken by the manada; branching off upon others,
made, perhaps, by the same drove upon some previous stampede.</p>

<br>
<div align="center">

</div>
<br>

<p>The dragoon escort, in charge of a young officer&mdash;a fresh
fledgling from West Point&mdash;ran astray upon one of these
ramifications, carrying the hindmost of the field along with
it.</p>

<p>It was a rolling prairie through which the pursuit was
conducted, here and there intersected by straggling belts of
brushwood.  These, with the inequalities of the surface, soon hid
the various pursuing parties from one another; and in twenty
minutes after the start, a bird looking from the heavens above,
might have beheld half a hundred horsemen, distributed into half
a score of groups&mdash;apparently having started from a common
centre&mdash;spurring at full speed towards every quarter of the
compass!</p>

<p>But one was going in the right direction&mdash;a solitary
individual, mounted upon a large strong-limbed chestnut horse;
that, without any claim to elegance of shape, was proving the
possession both of speed and bottom. The blue frock-coat of half
military cut, and forage cap of corresponding colour, were
distinctive articles of dress habitually worn by the ex-captain
of volunteer cavalry&mdash;Cassius Calhoun.  He it was who
directed the chestnut on the true trail; while with whip and spur
he was stimulating the animal to extraordinary efforts.  He was
himself stimulated by a thought&mdash;sharp as his own
spurs&mdash;that caused him to concentrate all his energies upon
the abject in hand.</p>

<p>Like a hungry hound he was laying his head along the trail, in
hopes of an issue that might reward him for his exertions.</p>

<p>What that issue was he had but vaguely conceived; but on
occasional glance towards his holsters&mdash;from which protruded
the butts of a brace of pistols&mdash;told of some sinister
design that was shaping itself in his soul.</p>

<p>But for a circumstance that assisted him, he might, like the
others, have gone astray.  He had the advantage of them, however,
in being guided by two shoe-tracks he had seen before.  One, the
larger, he recollected with a painful distinctness.  He had seen
it stamped upon a charred surface, amid the ashes of a burnt
prairie.  Yielding to an undefined instinct, he had made a note
of it in his memory, and now remembered it.</p>

<p>Thus directed, the <i>ci-devant</i> captain arrived among the
copses, and rode into the glade where the spotted mustang had
been pulled up in such a mysterious manner.  Hitherto his
analysis had been easy enough.  At this point it became
conjecture.  Among the hoof-prints of the wild mares, the shoe-
tracks were still seen, but no longer going at a gallop. The two
animals thus distinguished must have been halted, and standing in
juxtaposition.</p>

<p>Whither next?  Along the trail of the manada, there was no
imprint of iron; nor elsewhere!  The surface on all sides was
hard, and strewn with pebbles.  A horse going in rude gallop,
might have indented it; but not one passing over it at a tranquil
pace.</p>

<p>And thus had the spotted mustang and blood bay parted from
that spot. They had gone at a walk for some score yards, before
starting on their final gallop towards the mustang trap.</p>

<p>The impatient pursuer was puzzled.  He rode round and round,
and along the trail of the wild mares, and back again, without
discovering the direction that had been taken by either of the
ridden horses.</p>

<p>He was beginning to feel something more than surprise, when
the sight of a solitary horseman advancing along the trail
interrupted his uncomfortable conjectures.</p>

<p>It was no stranger who was drawing near.  The colossal figure,
clad in coarse habiliments, bearded to the buttons of his blanket
coat, and bestriding the most contemptible looking steed that
could have been found within a hundred miles of the spot, was an
old acquaintance. Cassius Calhoun knew Zebulon Stump, and Zeb
Stump knew Cash Calhoun, long before either had set foot upon the
prairies of Texas.</p>

<p>"You hain't seed nuthin' o' the young lady, hev ye, Mister
Calhoun?" inquired the hunter, as he rode up, with an unusual
impressiveness of manner.  "No, ye hain't," he continued, as if
deducing his inference from the blank looks of the other.  "Dog-
gone my cats!  I wonder what the hell hev becomed o' her!
Kewrious, too; sech a rider as she air, ter let the durned goat
o' a thing run away wi' her.  Wal! thur's not much danger to be
reeprehended.  The mowstanger air putty sartin to throw his rope
aroun' the critter, an that 'll put an eend to its capers.  Why
hev ye stopped hyur?"</p>

<p>"I'm puzzled about the direction they've taken.  Their tracks
show they've been halted here; but I can see the shod hoofs no
farther."</p>

<p>"Whoo! whoo! yur right, Mister Cashus!  They hev been halted
hyur; an been clost thegither too.  They hain't gone no further
on the trail o' the wild maars.  Sartin they hain't.  What
then?"</p>

<p>The speaker scanned the surface of the plain with an
interrogative glance; as if there, and not from Cassius Calhoun,
expecting an answer to his question.</p>

<p>"I cannot see their tracks anywhere," replied the ex-
captain.</p>

<p>"No, kan't ye?  I kin though.  Lookee hyur!  Don't ye see them
thur bruises on the grass?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Durn it! thur plain es the nose on a Jew's face.  Thur's a
big shoe, an a little un clost aside o' it.  Thet's the way
they've rud off, which show that they hain't follered the wild
maars no further than hyur. We'd better keep on arter them?"</p>

<p>"By all means!"</p>

<p>Without further parley, Zeb started along the new trail;
which, though still undiscernible to the eye of the other, was to
him as conspicuous as he had figuratively declared it.</p>

<p>In a little while it became visible to his companion&mdash;on
their arrival at the place where the fugitives had once more
urged their horses into a gallop to escape from the cavallada,
and where the shod tracks deeply indented the turf.</p>

<p>Shortly after their trail was again lost&mdash;or would have
been to a scrutiny less keen than that of Zeb Stump&mdash;among
the hundreds of other hoof-marks seen now upon the sward.</p>

<p>"Hilloo!" exclaimed the old hunter, in some surprise at the
new sign. "What's been a doin' hyur?  This air some 'at
kewrious."</p>

<p>"Only the tracks of the wild mares!" suggested Calhoun.  "They
appear to have made a circuit, and come round again?"</p>

<p>"If they hev it's been arter the others rud past them.  The
chase must a changed sides, I reck'n."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mr Stump?"</p>

<p>"That i'stead o' them gallupin' arter the maars, the maars hev
been gallupin' arter them."</p>

<p>"How can you tell that?"</p>

<p>"Don't ye see that the shod tracks air kivered by them o' the
maars? Maars&mdash;no!  By the 'turnal airthquake!&mdash;them's
not maar-tracks.  They air a inch bigger.  Thur's been
<i>studs</i> this way&mdash;a hul cavayurd o' them.  Geehosofat!
I hope they hain't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Haven't what?"</p>

<p>"Gone arter Spotty.  If they hev, then thur will be danger to
Miss Peintdexter.  Come on!"</p>

<p>Without waiting for a rejoinder, the hunter started off at a
shambling trot, followed by Calhoun, who kept calling to him for
an explanation of his ambiguous words.</p>

<p>Zeb did not deign to offer any&mdash;excusing himself by a
backward sweep of the hand, which seemed to say, "Do not bother
me now: I am busy."</p>

<p>For a time he appeared absorbed in taking up the trail of the
shod horses&mdash;not so easily done, as it was in places
entirely obliterated by the thick trampling of the stallions.  He
succeeded in making it out by piecemeal&mdash;still going on at a
trot.</p>

<p>It was not till he had arrived within a hundred yards of the
arroyo that the serious shadow disappeared from his face; and,
checking the pace of his mare, he vouchsafed the explanation once
more demanded from him.</p>

<p>"Oh! that was the danger," said Calhoun, on hearing the
explanation. "How do you know they have escaped it?"</p>

<p>"Look thur!"</p>

<p>"A dead horse!  Freshly killed, he appears?  What does that
prove?"</p>

<p>"That the mowstanger hes killed him."</p>

<p>"It frightened the others off, you think, and they followed no
further?"</p>

<p>"They follered no further; but it wa'n't adzackly thet as
scared 'em off.  Thur's the thing as kep them from follerin'. Ole
Hickory, what a jump!"</p>

<p>The speaker pointed to the arroyo, on the edge of which both
riders had now arrived.</p>

<p>"You don't suppose they leaped it?" said Calhoun.
"Impossible."</p>

<p>"Leaped it clur as the crack o' a rifle.  Don't ye see thur
toe-marks, both on this side an the t'other?  An' Miss
Peintdexter fust, too!  By the jumpin' Geehosofat, what a gurl
she air sure enuf!  They must both a jumped afore the stellyun
war shot; else they kedn't a got at it. Thur's no other place
whar a hoss ked go over.  Geeroozalem! wa'n't it cunnin' o' the
mowstanger to throw the stud in his tracks, jest in the very
gap?"</p>

<p>"You think that he and my cousin crossed here together?"</p>

<p>"Not adzackly thegither," explained Zeb, without suspecting
the motive of the interrogatory.  "As I've sayed, Spotty went
fust.  You see the critter's tracks yonner on t'other side?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Wal&mdash;don't ye see they air kivered wi' them o' the
mowstanger's hoss?"</p>

<p>"True&mdash;true."</p>

<p>"As for the stellyuns, they hain't got over&mdash;ne'er a one
o' the hul cavayurd.  I kin see how it hez been.  The young
fellur pulled up on t'other side, an sent a bullet back inter
this brute's karkidge.  'Twar jest like closin' the gap ahint
him; an the pursooers, seein' it shet, guv up the chase, an
scampered off in a different direckshun.  Thur's the way they hev
gone&mdash;up the side o' the gully!"</p>

<p>"They may have crossed at some other place, and continued the
pursuit?"</p>

<p>"If they dud, they'd hev ten mile to go, afore they ked git
back hyur&mdash; five up, an five back agin.  Not a bit o' that,
Mister Calhoun.  To needn't be uneezy 'bout Miss Lewaze bein'
pursooed by <i>them</i> any further.  Arter the jump, she's rud
off along wi' the mowstanger&mdash;both on 'em as quiet as a
kupple o' lambs.  Thur wa'n't no danger then; an by this time,
they oughter be dog-goned well on torst rejoinin' the people as
stayed by the purvision waggon."</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried Calhoun, exhibiting as much impatience as
when he believed his cousin to be in serious peril.  "Come on, Mr
Stump!  Let us get back as speedily as possible!"</p>

<p>"Not so fast, if you pleeze," rejoined Zeb, permitting himself
to slide leisurely out of his saddle, and then drawing his knife
from his sheath. "I'll only want ye to wait for a matter o' ten
minutes, or thereabout."</p>

<p>"Wait!  For what?" peevishly inquired Calhoun.</p>

<p>"Till I kin strip the hide off o' this hyur sorrel.  It appear
to be a skin o' the fust qualerty; an oughter fetch a five-dollar
bill in the settlements.  Five-dollar bills ain't picked up every
day on these hyur purayras."</p>

<p>"Damn the skin!" angrily ejaculated the impatient Southerner.
"Come on, an leave it!"</p>

<p>"Ain't a goin' to do anythin' o' the sort," coolly responded
the hunter, as he drew the sharp edge of his blade along the
belly of the prostrate steed.  "You kin go on if ye like, Mister
Calhoun; but Zeb Stump don't start till he packs the hide of this
hyur stellyun on the krupper o' his old maar.  Thet he
don't."</p>

<p>"Come, Zeb; what's the use of talking about my going back by
myself? You know I can't find my way?"</p>

<p>"That air like enough.  I didn't say ye ked."</p>

<p>"Look here, you obstinate old case!  Time's precious to me
just at this minute.  It 'll take you a full half-hour to skin
the horse."</p>

<p>"Not twenty minutes."</p>

<p>"Well, say twenty minutes.  Now, twenty minutes are of more
importance to me than a five-dollar bill.  You say that's the
value of the skin? Leave it behind; and I agree to make good the
amount."</p>

<p>"Wal&mdash;that air durned gin'rous, I admit&mdash;dog-goned
gin'rous.  But I mussent except yur offer.  It 'ud be a mean
trick o' me&mdash;mean enuf for a yeller-bellied Mexikin&mdash;to
take yur money for sech a sarvice as thet: the more so es I ain't
no stranger to ye, an myself a goin' the same road.  On the
t'other hand, I kan't afford to lose the five dollars' worth o'
hoss-hide which ud be rotten as punk&mdash;to say nuthin' o' it's
bein' tored into skreeds by the buzzarts and coyoats&mdash;afore
I mout find a chance to kum this way agin."</p>

<p>"'Tis very provoking!  What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"You <i>air</i> in a hurry?  Wal&mdash;I'm sorry to
discommerdate ye.  But&mdash;stay! Thur's no reezun for yur
waitin' on me.  Thur's nuthin' to hinder ye from findin' yur way
to the waggon.  Ye see that tree stannin' up agin the sky-
line&mdash;the tall poplar yonner?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Wal; do you remember ever to hev seed it afore?  It air a
queery lookin' plant, appearin' more like a church steeple than a
tree."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes!" said Calhoun.  "Now you've pointed it out, I
do remember it. We rode close past it while in pursuit of the
wild mares?"</p>

<p>"You dud that very thing.  An' now, as ye know it, what air to
hinder you from ridin' past it agin; and follering the trail o'
the maars back'ard?  That ud bring ye to yur startin'-peint;
where, ef I ain't out o' my reck'nin', ye'll find yur cousin,
Miss Peintdexter, an the hul o' yur party enjoying themselves wi'
that 'ere French stuff, they call shampain.  I hope they'll stick
to it, and spare the Monongaheela&mdash;of which licker I shed
like to hev a triflin' suck arter I git back myself."</p>

<p>Calhoun had not waited for the wind-up of this characteristic
speech. On the instant after recognising the tree, he had struck
the spurs into the sides of his chestnut, and gone off at a
gallop, leaving old Zeb at liberty to secure the coveted
skin.</p>

<p>"Geeroozalem!" ejaculated the hunter, glancing up, and
noticing the quick unceremonious departure.  "It don't take much
o' a head-piece to tell why he air in sech a durned hurry.  I
ain't myself much guv torst guessin'; but if I ain't doggonedly
mistaken it air a clur case o' jellacy on the trail!"</p>

<p>Zeb Stump was not astray in his conjecture.  It <i>was</i>
jealousy that urged Cassius Calhoun to take that hasty
departure&mdash;black jealousy, that had first assumed shape in a
kindred spot&mdash;in the midst of a charred prairie; that had
been every day growing stronger from circumstances observed, and
others imagined; that was now intensified so as to have become
his prevailing passion.</p>

<p>The presentation and taming of the spotted mustang; the
acceptance of that gift, characteristic of the giver, and
gratifying to the receiver, who had made no effort to conceal her
gratification; these, and other circumstances, acting upon the
already excited fancy of Cassius Calhoun, had conducted him to
the belief: that in Maurice the mustanger he would find his most
powerful rival.</p>

<p>The inferior social position of the horse-hunter should have
hindered him from having such belief, or even a suspicion.</p>

<p>Perhaps it might have done so, had he been less intimately
acquainted with the character of Louise Poindexter.  But, knowing
her as he did&mdash; associating with her from the hour of
childhood&mdash;thoroughly understanding her independence of
spirit&mdash;the <i>braverie</i> of her disposition, bordering
upon very recklessness&mdash;he could place no reliance on the
mere idea of gentility.  With most women this may be depended
upon as a barrier, if not to <i>mesalliance</i>, at least to
absolute imprudence; but in the impure mind of Cassius Calhoun,
while contemplating the probable conduct of his cousin, there was
not even this feeble support to lean upon!</p>

<p>Chafing at the occurrences of the day&mdash;to him crookedly
inauspicious&mdash;he hurried back towards the spot where the
pic-nic had been held.  The steeple-like tree guided him back to
the trail of the manada; and beyond that there was no danger of
straying.  He had only to return along the path already trodden
by him.</p>

<p>He rode at a rapid pace&mdash;faster than was relished by his
now tired steed&mdash;stimulated by bitter thoughts, which for
more than an hour were his sole companions&mdash;their bitterness
more keenly felt in the tranquil solitude that surrounded
him.</p>

<p>He was but little consoled by a sight that promised other
companionship: that of two persons on horseback, riding in
advance, and going in the same direction as himself, upon the
same path.  Though he saw but their backs&mdash;and at a long
distance ahead&mdash;there was no mistaking the identity of
either.  They were the two individuals that had brought that
bitterness upon his spirit.</p>

<p>Like himself they were returning upon the trail of the wild
mares; which, when first seen, they had just struck, arriving
upon it from a lateral path.  Side by side&mdash;their saddles
almost chafing against each other&mdash;to all appearance
absorbed in a conversation of intense interest to both, they saw
not the solitary horseman approaching them in a diagonal
direction.</p>

<p>Apparently less anxious than he to rejoin the party of
picknickers, they were advancing at a slow pace&mdash;the lady a
little inclining to the rear.</p>

<p>Their proximity to one another&mdash;their attitudes in the
saddle&mdash;their obvious inattention to outward
objects&mdash;the snail-like pace at which they were
proceeding&mdash;these, along with one or two other slighter
circumstances observed by Calhoun, combined to make an impression
on his mind&mdash;or rather to strengthen one already
made&mdash;that almost drove him mad.</p>

<p>To gallop rapidly up, and rudely terminate the <i>tete-a-
tete</i>, was but the natural instinct of the <i>chivalric</i>
Southerner.  In obedience to it he spitefully plied the spur; and
once more forced his jaded chestnut into an unwilling canter.</p>

<p>In a few seconds, however, he slackened pace&mdash;as if
changing his determination.  The sound of his horse's hoofs had
not yet warned the others of his proximity&mdash;though he was
now less than two hundred yards behind them!  He could hear the
silvery tones of his cousin's voice bearing the better part of
the conversation.  How interesting it must be to both to have
hindered them from perceiving his approach!</p>

<p>If he could but overhear what they were saying?</p>

<p>It seemed a most unpropitious place for playing eavesdropper;
and yet there might be a chance?</p>

<p>The seeming interest of the dialogue to the individuals
engaged in it gave promise of such opportunity.  The turf of the
savannah was soft as velvet.  The hoof gliding slowly over it
gave forth not the slightest sound.</p>

<p>Calhoun was still too impatient to confine himself to a walk;
but his chestnut was accustomed to that gait, peculiar to the
horse of the South-Western States&mdash;the "pace"; and into this
was he pressed.</p>

<p>With hoofs horizontally striking the sward&mdash;elevated
scarce an inch above the ground&mdash;he advanced swiftly and
noiselessly; so quick withal, that in a few seconds he was close
upon the heels of the spotted mustang, and the red steed of the
mustanger!</p>

<p>He was then checked to a pace corresponding to theirs; while
his rider, leaning forward, listened with an eagerness that
evinced some terrible determination.  His attitude proclaimed him
in the vein for vituperation of the rudest kind&mdash;ready with
ribald tongue; or, if need be, with knife and pistol!</p>

<p>His behaviour depended on a contingency&mdash;on what might be
overheard.</p>

<p>As chance, or fate, willed it, there was nothing.  If the
<i>two</i> equestrians were insensible to external sounds, their
steeds were not so absorbed.  In a walk the chestnut stepped
heavily&mdash;the more so from being fatigued.  His footfall
proclaimed his proximity to the sharp ears, both of the blood-bay
and spotted mustang; that simultaneously flung up their heads,
neighing as they did so.</p>

<p>Calhoun was discovered.</p>

<p>"Ha! cousin Cash!" cried the lady, betraying more of pique
than surprise; "you there?  Where's father, and Harry, and the
rest of the people?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask that, Loo?  I reckon you know as well as
I."</p>

<p>"What! haven't you come out to meet us?  And they
too&mdash;ah! your chestnut is all in a sweat!  He looks as if
you had been riding a long race&mdash;like ourselves?"</p>

<p>"Of coarse he has.  I followed you from the first&mdash;in
hopes of being of some service to you."</p>

<p>"Indeed!  I did not know that you were after us.  Thank you,
cousin! I've just been saying thanks to this gallant gentleman,
who also came after, and has been good enough to rescue both Luna
and myself from a very unpleasant dilemma&mdash;a dreadful danger
I should rather call it.  Do you know that we've been chased by a
drove of wild steeds, and had actually to ride for our
lives?"</p>

<p>"I am aware of it."</p>

<p>"You saw the chase then?"</p>

<p>"No.  I only knew it by the tracks."</p>

<p>"The tracks!  And were you able to tell by that?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;thanks to the interpretation of Zeb Stump."</p>

<p>"Oh! he was with you?  But did you follow them
to&mdash;to&mdash;how far did you follow them?"</p>

<p>"To a crevasse in the prairie.  You leaped over it, Zeb said.
Did you?"</p>

<p>"Luna did."</p>

<p>"With you on her back?"</p>

<p>"I <i>wasn't anywhere else</i>!  What a question, cousin Cash!
Where would you expect me to have been?  Clinging to her tail?
Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Did <i>you</i> leap it?" inquired the laugher, suddenly
changing tone.  "Did you follow us any farther?"</p>

<p>"No, Loo.  From the crevasse I came direct here, thinking you
had got back before me.  That's how I've chanced to come up with
you."</p>

<p>The answer appeared to give satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Ah!  I'm glad you've overtaken us.  We've been riding slowly.
Luna is so tired.  Poor thing!  I don't know how I shall ever get
her back to the Leona."</p>

<p>Since the moment of being joined by Calhoun, the mustanger had
not spoken a word.  However pleasant may have been his previous
intercourse with the young Creole, he had relinquished it,
without any apparent reluctance; and was now riding silently in
the advance, as if by tacit understanding he had returned to the
performance of the part for which he had been originally
engaged.</p>

<p>For all that, the eye of the ex-captain was bent blightingly
upon him&mdash; at times in a demoniac glare&mdash;when he
saw&mdash;or fancied&mdash;that another eye was turned admiringly
in the same direction.</p>

<p>A long journey performed by that trio of travellers might have
led to a tragical termination.  Such finale was prevented by the
appearance of the picknickers; who soon after surrounding the
returned runaway, put to flight every other thought by the chorus
of their congratulations.</p>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER NINETEEN.<br>

WHISKY AND WATER.</h2>

<p class="first">
IN the embryo city springing up under the protection of Fort
Inge, the "hotel" was the most conspicuous building.  This is but
the normal condition of every Texan town&mdash;whether new or
founded forty years ago; and none are older, except the sparse
cities of Hispano-Mexican origin&mdash; where the <i>presidio</i>
and convent took precedence, now surpassed by, and in some
instances transformed into, the "tavern."</p>

<p>The Fort Inge establishment, though the largest building in
the place, was, nevertheless, neither very grand nor imposing.
Its exterior had but little pretence to architectural style.  It
was a structure of hewn logs, having for ground-plan the letter T
according to the grotesque alphabet&mdash;the shank being used
for eating and sleeping rooms, while the head was a single
apartment entirely devoted to drinking&mdash;smoking and
<i>expectorating</i> included.  This last was the bar-room, or
"saloon."</p>

<p>The sign outside, swinging from the trunk of a post-oak, that
had been <i>pollarded</i> some ten feet above the ground,
exhibited on both sides the likeness of a well known military
celebrity&mdash;the hero of that quarter of the
globe&mdash;General Zachariah Taylor.  It did not need looking at
the lettering beneath to ascertain the name of the hotel.  Under
the patronage of such a portrait it could only be called "Rough
and Ready."</p>

<p>There was a touch of the apropos about this designation.
Outside things appeared rough enough; while inside, especially if
you entered by the "saloon," there was a readiness to meet you
half way, with a mint julep, a sherry cobbler, a gin sling, or
any other <i>mixed</i> drink known to trans-Mississippian
tipplers&mdash;provided always that you were ready with the
<i>picayunes</i> to pay for them.</p>

<p>The saloon in question would not call for description, had you
ever travelled in the Southern, or South-Western, States of
America.  If so, no Lethean draught could ever efface from your
memory the "bar-room" of the hotel or <i>tavern</i> in which you
have had the unhappiness to sojourn. The counter extending
longitudinally by the side; the shelved wall behind, with its
rows of decanters and bottles, containing liquors, of not only
all the colours of the prism, but every possible combination of
them; the elegant young fellow, standing or sidling between
counter and shelves, ycleped "clerk"&mdash;don't call him a
"barkeeper," or you may get a decanter in your teeth&mdash;this
elegant young gentleman, in blouse of blue <i>cottonade</i>, or
white linen coat, or maybe in his shirt sleeves&mdash;the latter
of finest linen and lace&mdash;ruffled, in the year of our Lord
eighteen hundred and fifty&mdash;this elegant young gentleman,
who, in mixing you a sherry cobbler, can look you straight in the
face, talk to you the politics of the day, while the ice, and the
wine, and the water, are passing from glass to glass, like an
iris sparkling behind his shoulders, or an aureole surrounding
his perfumed head!  Traveller through the Southern States of
America you; cannot fail to remember him?</p>

<p>If so, my words will recall him, along with his
surroundings&mdash;the saloon in which he is the presiding
administrator, with its shelves and coloured decanters; its
counter; its floor sprinkled with white sand, at times littered
with cigar stumps, and the brown asterisks produced by
<i>expectoration</i>&mdash;its odour of mint, absinthe, and
lemon-peel, in which luxuriate the common black fly, the blue-
bottle, and the sharp-tongued mosquito.  All these must be
sharply outlined on the retina of your memory.</p>

<p>The hotel, or tavern, "Rough and Ready," though differing but
little from other Texan houses of entertainment, had some points
in particular. Its proprietor, instead of being a speculative
Yankee, was a German&mdash;in this part of the world, as
elsewhere, found to be the best purveyors of food.  He kept his
own bar; so that on entering the saloon, instead of the elegant
young gentleman with ruffled shirt and odorous chevelure, your
"liquor" was mixed for you by a staid Teuton, who looked as sober
as if he never tasted&mdash;notwithstanding the temptation of
wholesale price&mdash;the delicious drinks served out to his
customers.  Oberdoffer was the name he had imported with him from
his fatherland; transformed by his Texan customers into "Old
Duffer."</p>

<p>There was one other peculiarity about the bar-room of the
"Rough and Ready," though it scarce deserved to be so designated;
since it was not uncommon elsewhere.  As already stated, the
building was shaped like a capital T; the saloon representing the
head of the letter.  The counter extended along one side, that
contiguous to the shank; while at each end was a door that opened
outward into the public square of the incipient city.</p>

<p>This arrangement had been designed to promote the circulation
of the air&mdash;a matter of primary importance in an atmosphere
where the thermometer for half the year stands at 90 degrees in
the shade.</p>

<p>The hotels of Texas or the South-Western States&mdash;I may
say every part of the American Union&mdash;serve the double
purpose of exchange and club-house. Indeed, it is owing to the
cheap accommodation thus afforded&mdash;often of the most
convenient kind&mdash;that the latter can scarce be said to
exist.</p>

<p>Even in the larger cities of the Atlantic states the "club" is
by no means a necessity.  The moderate charges of the hotels,
along with their excellent <i>cuisine</i> and elegant
accommodations, circumscribe the prosperity of this institution;
which in America is, and ever must be, an unhealthy exotic.</p>

<p>The remark is still more true of the Southern and South-
western cities; where the "saloon" and "bar-room" are the chief
places of resort and rendezvous.</p>

<p>The company, too, is there of a more miscellaneous character.
The proud planter does not disdain&mdash;for he does not
dare&mdash;to drink in the same room with the "poor white trash;"
often as proud as himself.</p>

<p>There is no <i>peasant</i> in that part of the
world&mdash;least of all in the state called Texas; and in the
saloon of "Rough and Ready" might often be seen assembled
representatives of every class and calling to be met with among
the settlements.</p>

<p>Perhaps not upon any occasion since "Old Duffer" had hung out
the sign of his tavern, was he favoured with a larger company, or
served more customers across his counter, than upon that night,
after the return of the horse-hunting party to Fort Inge.</p>

<p>With the exception of the ladies, almost every one who had
taken part in the expedition seemed to think that a half-hour
spent at the "Rough and Ready" was necessary as a "nightcap"
before retiring to rest; and as the Dutch clock, quaintly ticking
among the coloured decanters, indicated the hour of eleven, one
after another&mdash;officers of the Fort&mdash;planters living
near along the river&mdash;Sutlers&mdash;commissariat
contractors&mdash;"sportsmen"&mdash;and others who might be
called nondescripts&mdash; came dropping in; each as he entered
marching straight up to the counter, calling for his favourite
drink, and then falling back to converse with some group already
occupying the floor.</p>

<p>One of these groups was conspicuous.  It consisted of some
eight or ten individuals, half of them in uniform.  Among the
latter were the three officers already introduced; the captain of
infantry, and the two lieutenants&mdash;Hancock of the dragoons,
and Crossman of the mounted rifles.</p>

<p>Along with these was an officer older than any of them, also
higher in authority, as could be told by the embroidery on his
shoulder-strap, that proclaimed him of the rank of major.  As he
was the only "field officer" at Fort Inge, it is unnecessary to
say he was the commandant of the cantonment.</p>

<p>These gentlemen were conversing as freely as if all were
subalterns of equal rank&mdash;the subject of the discourse being
the incidents of the day.</p>

<p>"Now tell us, major!" said Hancock: "you must know.  Where did
the girl gallop to?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?" answered the officer appealed to.  "Ask
her cousin, Mr Cassius Calhoun."</p>

<p>"We have asked him, but without getting any satisfaction. It's
clear he knows no more than we.  He only met them on the
return&mdash;and not very far from the place where we had our
bivouac.  They were gone a precious long time; and judging by the
sweat of their horses they must have had a hard ride of it.  They
might have been to the Rio Grande, for that matter, and beyond
it."</p>

<p>"Did you notice Calhoun as he came back?" inquired the captain
of infantry.  "There was a scowl upon his face that betokened
some very unpleasant emotion within his mind, I should say."</p>

<p>"He did look rather unhappy," replied the major; "but surely,
Captain Sloman, you don't attribute it to&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Jealousy.  I do, and nothing else."</p>

<p>"What! of Maurice the mustanger?  Poh&mdash;poh!
impossible&mdash;at least, very improbable."</p>

<p>"And why, major?"</p>

<p>"My dear Sloman, Louise Poindexter is a lady, and Maurice
Gerald&mdash;"</p>

<p>"May be a gentleman for aught that is known to the
contrary."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" scornfully exclaimed Crossman; "a trader in horses!
The major is right&mdash;the thing's
improbable&mdash;impossible."</p>

<p>"Ah, gentlemen!" pursued the officer of infantry, with a
significant shake of the head.  "You don't know Miss Poindexter,
so well as I.  An eccentric young lady&mdash;to say the least of
her.  You may have already observed that for yourselves."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Sloman!" said the major, in a bantering way; "you
are inclined to be talking scandal, I fear.  That would be a
scandal. Perhaps you are yourself interested in Miss Poindexter,
notwithstanding your pretensions to be considered a Joseph?  Now,
I could understand your being jealous if it were handsome Hancock
here, or Crossman&mdash; supposing him to be disengaged.  But as
for a common mustanger&mdash;poh&mdash; poh!"</p>

<p>"He's an Irishman, major, this mustanger; and if he be what I
have some reason to suspect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whatever he be," interrupted the major, casting a side glance
towards the door, "he's there to answer for himself; and as he's
a sufficiently plain-spoken fellow, you may learn from him all
about the matter that seems to be of so much interest to
you."</p>

<p>"I don't think you will," muttered Sloman, as Hancock and two
or three others turned towards the new-comer, with the design of
carrying out the major's suggestion.</p>

<p>Silently advancing across the sanded floor, the mustanger had
taken his stand at an unoccupied space in front of the
counter.</p>

<p>"A glass of whisky and water, if you please?" was the modest
request with which to saluted the landlord.</p>

<p>"Visky und vachter!" echoed the latter, without any show of
eagerness to wait upon his new guest.  "Ya, woe, visky und
vachter!  It ish two picayunsh the glass."</p>

<p>"I was not inquiring the price," replied the mustanger, "I
asked to be served with a glass of whisky and water.  Have you
got any?"</p>

<p>"Yesh&mdash;yesh," responded the German, rendered obsequious
by the sharp rejoinder.  "Plenty&mdash;plenty of visky und
vachter.  Here it ish."</p>

<p>While his simple potation was being served out to him, Maurice
received nods of recognition from the officers, returning them
with a free, but modest air.  Most of them knew him personally,
on account of his business relations with the Fort.</p>

<p>They were on the eve of interrogating him&mdash;as the major
had suggested&mdash; when the entrance of still another
individual caused them to suspend their design.</p>

<p>The new-comer was Cassius Calhoun.  In his presence it would
scarce have been delicacy to investigate the subject any
further.</p>

<p>Advancing with his customary swagger towards the mixed group
of military men and civilians, Calhoun saluted them as one who
had spent the day in their company, and had been absent only for
a short interval.  If not absolutely intoxicated, it could be
seen that the ex-officer of volunteers was under the influence of
drink.  The unsteady sparkle of his eyes, the unnatural pallor
upon his forehead&mdash;still further clouded by two or three
tossed tresses that fell over it&mdash;with the somewhat
grotesque set of his forage cap&mdash;told that he had been
taking one beyond the limits of wisdom.</p>

<p>"Come, gentlemen!" cried he, addressing himself to the major's
party, at the same time stepping up to the counter; "let's hit
the waggon a crack, or old Dunder-und-blitzen behind the bar will
say we're wasting his lights.  Drinks all round.  What say
you?"</p>

<p>"Agreed&mdash;agreed!" replied several voices.</p>

<p>"You, major?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure, Captain Calhoun."</p>

<p>According to universal custom, the intended imbibers fell into
line along the counter, each calling out the name of the drink
most to his liking at the moment.</p>

<p>Of these were ordered almost as many kinds as there were
individuals in the party; Calhoun himself shouting
out&mdash;"Brown sherry for me;" and immediately
adding&mdash;"with a dash of bitters."</p>

<p>"Prandy und pitters, you calls for, Mishter Calhoun?" said the
landlord, as he leant obsequiously across the counter towards the
reputed partner of an extensive estate.</p>

<p>"Certainly, you stupid Dutchman!  I said brown sherry, didn't
I?"</p>

<p>"All rights, mein herr; all rights!  Prandy und
pitters&mdash;prandy und pitters," repeated the German Boniface,
as he hastened to place the decanter before his ill-mannered
guest.</p>

<p>With the large accession of the major's party, to several
others already in the act of imbibing, the whole front of the
long counter became occupied&mdash;with scarce an inch to
spare.</p>

<p>Apparently by accident&mdash;though it may have been design on
the part of Calhoun&mdash;he was the outermost man on the extreme
right of those who had responded to his invitation.</p>

<p>This brought him in juxtaposition with Maurice Gerald, who
alone&mdash;as regarded boon companionship&mdash;was quietly
drinking his whisky and water, and smoking a cigar he had just
lighted.</p>

<p>The two were back to back&mdash;neither having taken any
notice of the other.</p>

<p>"A toast!" cried Calhoun, taking his glass from the
counter.</p>

<p>"Let us have it!" responded several voices.</p>

<p>"America for the Americans, and confusion to all foreign
interlopers&mdash; especially the damned Irish!"</p>

<p>On delivering the obnoxious sentiment, he staggered back a
pace; which brought his body in contact with that of the
mustanger&mdash;at the moment standing with the glass raised to
his lips.</p>

<p>The collision caused the spilling of a portion of the whisky
and water; which fell over the mustanger's breast.</p>

<p>Was it an accident?  No one believed it was&mdash;even for a
moment. Accompanied by such a sentiment the act could only have
been an affront intended and premeditated.</p>

<p>All present expected to see the insulted man spring instantly
upon his insulter.  They were disappointed, as well as surprised,
at the manner in which the mustanger seemed to take it.  There
were some who even fancied he was about to submit to it.</p>

<p>"If he does," whispered Hancock in Sloman's ear, "he ought to
be kicked out of the room."</p>

<p>"Don't you be alarmed about that," responded the infantry
officer, in the same <i>sotto voce</i>.  "You'll find it
different.  I'm not given to betting, as you know; but I'd lay a
month's pay upon it the mustanger don't back out; and another,
that Mr Cassius Calhoun will find him an ugly customer to deal
with, although just now he seems more concerned about his fine
shirt, than the insult put upon him.  Odd devil he is!"</p>

<p>While this whispering was being carried on, the man to whom it
related was still standing by the bar&mdash;to use a hackneyed
phrase, "the observed of all observers."</p>

<p>Having deposited his glass upon the counter, he had drawn a
silk handkerchief from his pocket, and was wiping from his
embroidered shirt bosom the defilement of the spilt whisky.</p>

<p>There was an imperturbable coolness about the action, scarce
compatible with the idea of cowardice; and those who had doubted
him perceived that they had made a mistake, and that there was
something to come.  In silence they awaited the development.</p>

<p>They had not long to wait.  The whole
affair&mdash;speculations and whisperings included&mdash;did not
occupy twenty seconds of time; and then did the action proceed,
or the speech which was likely to usher it in.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> am an Irishman," said the mustanger, as he returned
his handkerchief to the place from which he had taken it.</p>

<p>Simple as the rejoinder may have appeared, and long delayed as
it had been, there was no one present who mistook its meaning. If
the hunter of wild horses had tweaked the nose of Cassius
Calhoun, it would not have added emphasis to that acceptance of
his challenge.  Its simplicity but proclaimed the serious
determination of the acceptor.</p>

<p>"You?" scornfully retorted Calhoun, turning round, and
standing with his arms <i>akimbo</i>.  "You?" he continued, with
his eye measuring the mustanger from head to foot, "you an
Irishman?  Great God, sir, I should never have thought so!  I
should have taken you for a Mexican, judging by your rig, and the
elaborate stitching of your shirt."</p>

<p>"I can't perceive how my rig should concern you, Mr Cassius
Calhoun; and as you've done my shirt no service by spilling half
my liquor upon it, I shall take the liberty of unstarching yours
in a similar fashion."</p>

<p>So saying, the mustanger took up his glass; and, before the
ex-captain of volunteers could duck his head, or get out of the
way, the remains of the mixed Monongahela were "swilled" into his
face, sending him off into a fit of alternate sneezing and
coughing that appeared to afford satisfaction to more than a
majority of the bystanders.</p>

<p>The murmur of approbation was soon suppressed.  The
circumstances were not such as to call for speech; and the
exclamations that accompanied the act were succeeded by a hush of
silence.  All saw that the quarrel could not be otherwise than a
serious one.  The affair must end in a fight.  No power on earth
could prevent it from coming to that conclusion.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY.<br>

AN UNSAFE POSITION.</h2>

<p class="first">
ON receiving the alcoholic douche, Calhoun had clutched his
six-shooter, and drawn it from its holster.  He only waited to
get the whisky out of his eyes before advancing upon his
adversary.</p>

<p>The mustanger, anticipating this action, had armed himself
with a similar weapon, and stood ready to return the fire of his
antagonist&mdash; shot for shot.</p>

<p>The more timid of the spectators had already commenced making
their escape out of doors tumbling over one another, in their
haste to get out of harm's way.</p>

<p>A few stayed in the saloon from sheer irresolution; a few
others, of cooler courage, from choice; or, perhaps, actuated by
a more astute instinct, which told them that in attempting to
escape they might get a bullet in the back.</p>

<p>There was an interval&mdash;some six seconds&mdash;of silence,
during which a pin might have been heard falling upon the floor.
It was but the interlude that often occurs between resolution and
action; when the mind has completed its task, and the body has
yet to begin.</p>

<p>It might have been more brief with other actors on the scene.
Two ordinary men would have blazed away at once, and without
reflection. But the two now confronting each other were not of
the common kind. Both had seen <i>street fighting</i>
before&mdash;had taken part in it&mdash;and knew the disadvantage
of an idle shot.  Each was determined to take sure aim on the
other.  It was this that prolonged the interval of inaction.</p>

<p>To those outside, who dared not even look through the doors,
the suspense was almost painful.  The cracking of the pistols,
which they expected every moment to hear, would have been a
relief.  It was almost a disappointment when, instead, they heard
the voice of the major&mdash;who was among the few who had stayed
inside&mdash;raised in a loud authoritative tone.</p>

<p>"Hold!" commanded he, in the accent of one accustomed to be
obeyed, at the same time whisking his sabre out of its scabbard,
and interposing its long blade between the disputants.</p>

<p>"Hold your fire&mdash;I command you both.  Drop your muzzles;
or by the Almighty I'll take the arm off the first of you that
touches trigger! Hold, I say!"</p>

<p>"Why?" shouted Calhoun, purple with angry passion.  "Why,
Major Ringwood?  After an insult like that, and from a low
fellow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You were the first to offer it, Captain Calhoun."</p>

<p>"Damn me if I care!  I shall be the last to let it pass
unpunished. Stand out of the way, major.  The quarrel is not
yours&mdash;you have no right to interfere!"</p>

<p>"Indeed!  Ha! ha!  Sloman!  Hancock!  Crossman! hear that?  I
have no right to interfere!  Hark ye, Mr Cassius Calhoun, ex-
captain of volunteers!  Know you where you are, sir?  Don't fancy
yourself in the state of Mississippi&mdash;among your slave-
whipping chivalry.  This, sir, is a military post&mdash;under
military law&mdash;my humble self its present administrator.  I
therefore command you to return your six-shooter to the holster
from which you have taken it.  This instant too, or you shall go
to the guard-house, like the humblest soldier in the
cantonment!"</p>

<p>"Indeed!" sneeringly replied the Mississippian.  "What a fine
country you intend Texas to become!  I suppose a man mustn't
fight, however much aggrieved, without first obtaining a licence
from Major Ringwood?  Is that to be the law of the land?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," retorted the major.  "I'm not the
man&mdash;never was&mdash;to stand in the way of the honest
adjustment of a quarrel.  You shall be quite at liberty&mdash;you
and your antagonist&mdash;to kill one another, if it so please
you.  But not just now.  You must perceive, Mr Calhoun, that your
sport endangers the lives of other people, who have not the
slightest interest in it.  I've no idea of being bored by a
bullet not intended for me.  Wait till the rest of us can
withdraw to a safe distance; and you may crack away to your
heart's content.  Now, sir, will that be agreeable to you?"</p>

<p>Had the major been a man of ordinary character his commands
might have been disregarded.  But to his official weight, as
chief officer of the post, was added a certain reverence due to
seniority in age&mdash;along with respect for one who was himself
known to wield a weapon with dangerous skill, and who allowed no
trilling with his authority.</p>

<p>His sabre had not been unsheathed by way of empty
gesticulation.  The disputants knew it; and by simultaneous
consent lowered the muzzles of their pistols&mdash;still holding
them in hand.</p>

<p>Calhoun stood, with sullen brow, gritting his teeth, like a
beast of prey momentarily withheld from making attack upon its
victim; while the mustanger appeared to take things as coolly as
if neither angry, nor an Irishman.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are determined upon fighting?" said the major,
knowing that, there was not much chance of adjusting the
quarrel.</p>

<p>"I have no particular wish for it," modestly responded
Maurice.  "If Mr Calhoun will apologise for what he has said, and
also what he has done&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He ought to do it: he began the quarrel!" suggested several
of the bystanders.</p>

<p>"Never!" scornfully responded the ex-captain.  "Cash Calhoun
ain't accustomed to that sort of thing.  Apologise indeed!  And
to a masquerading monkey like that!"</p>

<p>"Enough!" cried the young Irishman, for the first time showing
serious anger; "I gave him a chance for his life.  He refuses to
accept it: and now, by the Mother of God, we don't both leave
this room alive!  Major! I insist that you and your friends
withdraw.  I can stand his insolence no longer!"</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!" responded the Southerner, with a yell
of derisive laughter; "a chance for my life!  Clear out, all of
ye&mdash;clear out; and let me at him!"</p>

<p>"Stay!" cried the major, hesitating to turn his back upon the
duellist. "It's not quite safe.  You may fancy to begin your game
of touch-trigger a second too soon.  We must get out of doors
before you do.  Besides, gentlemen!" he continued, addressing
himself to those around him, "there should be some system about
this.  If they are to fight, let it be fair for both sides.  Let
them be armed alike; and go at it on the square!"</p>

<p>"By all means!" chorused the half-score of spectators, turning
their eyes towards the disputants, to see if they accepted the
proposal.</p>

<p>"Neither of you can object?" continued the major,
interrogatively.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't object to anything that's fair," assented the
Irishman&mdash;"devil a bit!"</p>

<p>"I shall fight with the weapon I hold in my hand," doggedly
declared Calhoun.</p>

<p>"Agreed! the very weapon for me!" was the rejoinder of his
adversary.</p>

<p>"I see you both carry Colt's six-shooter Number 2," said the
major, scanning the pistols held in hand.  "So far all right!
you're armed exactly alike."</p>

<p>"Have they any other weapons?" inquired young Hancock,
suspecting that under the cover of his coat the ex-captain had a
knife.</p>

<p>"I have none," answered the mustanger, with a frankness that
left no doubt as to his speaking the truth.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upon Calhoun, who appeared to hesitate
about making a reply.  He saw he must declare himself.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, "I have my toothpick as well.  You don't
want me to give up that?  A man ought to be allowed to use
whatever weapon he has got."</p>

<p>"But, Captain Calhoun," pursued Hancock, "your adversary has
no knife. If you are not afraid to meet him on equal terms you
should surrender yours."</p>

<p>"Certainly he should!" cried several of the bystanders.  "He
must! he must!"</p>

<p>"Come, Mr Calhoun!" said the major, in a soothing tone.  "Six
shots ought to satisfy any reasonable man; without having
recourse to the steel.  Before you finish firing, one or the
other of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn the knife!" interrupted Calhoun, unbuttoning his coat.
Then drawing forth the proscribed weapon, and flinging it to the
farthest corner of the saloon, he added, in a tone of bravado,
intended to encowardice his adversary.  "I sha'n't want it for
such a spangled jay-bird as that.  I'll fetch him out of his
boots at the first shot."</p>

<p>"Time enough to talk when you've done something to justify it.
Cry boo to a goose; but don't fancy your big words are going to
frighten me, Mr Calhoun!  Quick, gentlemen!  I'm impatient to put
an end to his boasting and blasphemy!"</p>

<p>"Hound!" frantically hissed out the chivalric Southerner. "Low
dog of an Irish dam!  I'll send you howling to your kennel!
I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shame, Captain Calhoun!" interrupted the major, seconded by
other voices.  "This talk is idle, as it is unpolite in the
presence of respectable company.  Have patience a minute longer;
and you may then say what you like.  Now, gentlemen!" he
continued, addressing himself to the surrounding, "there is only
one more preliminary to be arranged. They must engage not to
begin firing till we have got out of their way?"</p>

<p>A difficulty here presented itself.  How was the engagement to
be given? A simple promise would scarce be sufficient in a crisis
like that?  The combatants&mdash;one of them at least&mdash;would
not be over scrupulous as to the time of pulling trigger.</p>

<p>"There must be a signal," pursued the major.  "Neither should
fire till that be given.  Can any one suggest what it is to
be?"</p>

<p>"I think.  I can," said the quiet Captain Sloman, advancing as
he spoke. "Let the gentlemen go outside, along with us.  There
is&mdash;as you perceive&mdash;a door at each end of the room.  I
see no difference between them.  Let them enter again&mdash;one
at each door, with the understanding that neither is to fire
before setting foot across the threshold."</p>

<p>"Capital! the very thing!" replied several voices.  "And what
for a signal?" demanded the major.  "A shot?"</p>

<p>"No.  Ring the tavern bell!"</p>

<p>"Nothing could be better&mdash;nothing fairer," conclusively
declared the major, making for one of the doors, that led outward
into the square.</p>

<p>"Mein Gott, major!" screamed the German Boniface, rushing out
from behind his bar; where, up to this time, he had been standing
transfixed with fear.  "Mein Gott&mdash;surely the shentlemens pe
not going to shoot their pisthols inside the shaloon: Ach!
they'll preak all my pottles, and my shplendid looking-glashes,
an my crystal clock, that hash cost me von&mdash;two hundred
dollars.  They'll shpill my pesht liquors&mdash;ach!  Major,
it'll ruin me&mdash;mein Gott&mdash;it will!"</p>

<p>"Never fear, Oberdoffer!" rejoined the major, pausing to
reply.  "No doubt you'll be paid for the damage.  At all events,
you had better betake yourself to some place of safety.  If you
stay in your saloon you'll stand a good chance of getting a
bullet through your body, and that would be worse than the
preaking of your pottles."</p>

<p>Without further parley the major parted from the unfortunate
landlord, and hurried across the threshold into the street,
whither the combatants, who had gone out by separate doors, had
already preceded him.</p>

<p>"Old Duffer," left standing in the middle of his sanded floor,
did not remain long in that perilous position.  In six seconds
after the major's coat-tail had disappeared through the outer
door, an inner one closed upon his own skirts; and the bar-room,
with its camphine lamps, its sparkling decanters, and its costly
mirrors, was left in untenanted silence&mdash;no other sound
being heard save the ticking of its crystal clock.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY ONE.<br>

A DUEL WITHIN DOORS.</h2>

<p class="first">
ONCE outside, the major took no further part in the affair. As
the commanding officer of the post, it would have been out of
place for him to have given encouragement to a fight&mdash;even
by his interfering to see that it should be a fair one.  This,
however, was attended to by the younger officers; who at once set
about arranging the conditions of the duel.</p>

<p>There was not much time consumed.  The terms had been
expressed already; and it only remained to appoint some one of
the party to superintend the ringing of the bell, which was to be
the signal for the combat to commence.</p>

<p>This was an easy matter, since it made no difference who might
be entrusted with the duty.  A child might have sounded the
summons for the terrible conflict that was to follow.</p>

<p>A stranger, chancing at that moment to ride into the rude
square of which the hotel "Rough and Ready" formed nearly a side,
would have been sorely puzzled to comprehend what was coming to
pass.  The night was rather dark, though there was still light
enough to make known the presence of a conglomeration of human
beings, assembled in the proximity of the hotel.  Most were in
military garb: since, in addition to the officers who had lately
figured inside the saloon, others, along with such soldiers as
were permitted to pass the sentries, had hastened down from the
Fort on receiving intelligence that something unusual was going
on within the "square."  Women, too, but scantily
robed&mdash;soldiers' wives, washerwomen, and "señorita" of more
questionable calling&mdash;had found their way into the street,
and were endeavouring to extract from those who had forestalled
them an explanation of the <i>fracas</i>.</p>

<p>The conversation was carried on in low tones.  It was known
that the commandant of the post was present, as well as others in
authority; and this checked any propensity there might have been
for noisy demonstration.</p>

<p>The crowd, thus promiscuously collected, was not in close
proximity with the hotel; but standing well out in the open
ground, about a dozen yards from the building.  Towards it,
however, the eyes of all were directed, with that steady stare
which tells of the attention being fixed on some engrossing
spectacle.  They were watching the movements of two men, whose
positions were apart&mdash;one at each end of the heavy
blockhouse, known to be the bar-room of the hotel; and where, as
already stated, there was a door.</p>

<p>Though separated by the interposition of two thick log walls,
and mutually invisible, these men were manoeuvring as if actuated
by a common impulse.  They stood contiguous to the entrance
doors, at opposite ends of the bar-room, through both of which
glared the light of the camphine lamps&mdash;falling in broad
divergent bands upon the rough gravel outside.  Neither was in
front of the contiguous entrance; but a little to one side, just
clear of the light.  Neither was in an upright attitude, but
crouching&mdash;not as if from fear, but like a runner about to
make a start, and straining upon the spring.</p>

<p>Both were looking inwards&mdash;into the saloon, where no
sound could be heard save the ticking of a clock.  Their
attitudes told of their readiness to enter it, and that they were
only restrained by waiting for some preconcerted signal.</p>

<p>That their purpose was a serious one could be deduced from
several circumstances.  Both were in their shirt sleeves,
hatless, and stripped of every rag that might form an impediment
to action; while on their faces was the stamp of stern
determination&mdash;alike legible in the attitudes they had
assumed.</p>

<p>But there was no fine reflection needed to discover their
design.  The stranger, chancing to come into the square, could
have seen at a glance that it was deadly.  The pistols in their
hands, cocked and tightly clutched; the nervous energy of their
attitudes; the silence of the crowd of spectators; and the
concentrated interest with which the two men were regarded,
proclaimed more emphatically than words, that there was danger in
what they were doing&mdash;in short, that they were engaged in
some sort of a strife, with death for its probable
consummation!</p>

<p>So it was at that moment when the crisis had come.  The
duellists stood, each with eye intent upon the door, by which he
was to make entrance&mdash; perhaps into eternity!  They only
waited for a signal to cross the threshold; and engage in a
combat that must terminate the existence of one or the
other&mdash;perhaps both.</p>

<p>Were they listening for that fatal
formulary:&mdash;One&mdash;two&mdash;fire?</p>

<p>No.  Another signal had been agreed upon; and it was
given.</p>

<p>A stentorian voice was heard calling out the simple
monosyllable&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ring!"</p>

<p>Three or four dark figures could be seen standing by the shorn
trunk on which swung the tavern bell.  The command instantly set
them in motion; and, along with the oscillation of their
arms&mdash;dimly seen through the darkness&mdash;could be heard
the sonorous tones of a bell.  That bell, whose sounds had been
hitherto heard only as symbols of joy&mdash;calling men together
to partake of that which perpetuates life&mdash;was now listened
to as a summons of death!</p>

<p>The "ringing in" was of short duration.  The bell had made
less than a score of vibrations, when the men engaged at the rope
saw that their services were no longer required.  The
disappearance of the duellists, who had rushed inside the saloon,
the quick, sharp cracking of pistols; the shivering of broken
glass, admonished the ringers that theirs was but a superfluous
noise; and, dropping the rope, they stood like the rest of the
crowd, listening to the conflict inside.</p>

<p>No eyes&mdash;save those of the combatants
themselves&mdash;were witnesses to that strange duel.</p>

<p>At the first dong of the bell both combatants had re-entered
the room. Neither made an attempt to skulk outside.  To have done
so would have been a ruin to reputation.  A hundred eyes were
upon them; and the spectators understood the conditions of the
duel&mdash;that neither was to fire before crossing the
threshold.</p>

<p>Once inside, the conflict commenced, the first shots filling
the room with smoke.  Both kept their feet, though both were
wounded&mdash;their blood spurting out over the sanded floor.</p>

<p>The second shots were also fired simultaneously, but at
random, the smoke hindering the aim.</p>

<p>Then came a single shot, quickly followed by another, and
succeeded by an interval of quiet.</p>

<p>Previous to this the combatants had been heard rushing about
through the room.  This noise was no longer being made.</p>

<p>Instead there was profound silence.  Had they killed one
another?  Were both dead?  No!  Once more the double detonation
announced that both still lived.  The suspension had been caused
as they stood peering through the smoke in the endeavour to
distinguish one another.  Neither spoke or stirred in fear of
betraying his position.</p>

<p>Again there was a period of tranquillity similar to the
former, but more prolonged.</p>

<p>It ended by another exchange of shots, almost instantly
succeeded by the falling of two heavy bodies upon the floor.</p>

<p>There was the sound of sprawling&mdash;the overturning of
chairs&mdash;then a single shot&mdash;the eleventh&mdash;and this
was the last that was fired!</p>

<p>The spectators outside saw only a cloud of sulphurous smoke
oozing out of both doors, and dimming the light of the camphine
lamps.  This, with an occasional flash of brighter effulgence,
close followed by a crack, was all that occurred to give
satisfaction to the eye.</p>

<p>But the ear&mdash;that was gratified by a greater variety.
There were heard shots&mdash;after the bell had become silent,
other sounds: the sharp shivering of broken glass, the duller
crash of falling furniture, rudely overturned in earnest
struggle&mdash;the trampling of feet upon the boarded
floor&mdash;at intervals the clear ringing crack of the
revolvers; but neither of the voices of the men whose insensate
passions were the cause of all this commotion!  The crowd in the
street heard the confused noises, and noted the intervals of
silence, without being exactly able to interpret them.  The
reports of the pistols were all they had to proclaim the progress
of the duel.  Eleven had been counted; and in breathless silence
they were listening for the twelfth.</p>

<p>Instead of a pistol report their ears were gratified by the
sound of a voice, recognised as that of the mustanger.</p>

<p>"My pistol is at your head!  I have one shot left&mdash;an
apology, or you die!"</p>

<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="0900261h-images/TheHeadlessHorseman-06.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>By this the crowd had become convinced that the fight was
approaching its termination.  Some of the more fearless, looking
in, beheld a strange scene.  They saw two men lying prostrate on
the plank floor; both with bloodstained habiliments, both
evidently disabled; the white sand around them reddened with
their gore, tracked with tortuous trails, where they had crawled
closer to get a last shot at each other&mdash;one of them, in
scarlet scarf and slashed velvet trousers, slightly surmounting
the other, and holding a pistol to his head that threatened to
deprive him of life.</p>

<p>Such was the tableau that presented itself to the spectators,
as the sulphurous smoke, drifted out by the current between the
two doors, gave them a chance of distinguishing objects within
the saloon.</p>

<p>At the same instant was heard a different voice from the one
which had already spoken.  It was Calhoun's&mdash;no longer in
roistering bravado, but in low whining accents, almost a whisper.
"Enough, damn it!  Drop your shooting-iron&mdash;I
apologise."</p>

<h2><a id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY TWO.<br>

AN UNKNOWN DONOR.</h2>

<p class="first">
IN Texas a duel is not even a nine days' wonder.  It oftener
ceases to be talked about by the end of the third day; and, at
the expiration of a week, is no longer thought of, except by the
principals themselves, or their immediate friends and
relatives.</p>

<p>This is so, even when the parties are well known, and of
respectable standing in society.  When the duellists are of
humble position&mdash;or, as is often the case, strangers in the
place&mdash;a single day may suffice to doom their achievement to
oblivion; to dwell only in the memory of the combatant who has
survived it&mdash;oftener one than both&mdash;and perhaps some
ill-starred spectator, who has been bored by a bullet, or
received the slash of a knife, not designed for him.</p>

<p>More than once have I been witness to a "street
fight"&mdash;improvised upon the pavement&mdash;where some
innocuous citizen, sauntering carelessly along, has become the
victim&mdash;even unto death&mdash;of this irregular method of
seeking "satisfaction."</p>

<p>I have never heard of any punishment awarded, or damages
demanded, in such cases.  They are regarded as belonging to the
"chapter of accidents!"</p>

<p>Though Cassius Calhoun and Maurice Gerald were both
comparatively strangers in the settlement&mdash;the latter being
only seen on occasional visits to the Fort&mdash;the affair
between them caused something more than the usual interest; and
was talked about for the full period of the nine days, the
character of the former as a noted bully, and that of the latter
as a man of singular habitudes, gave to their duello a certain
sort of distinction; and the merits and demerits of the two men
were freely discussed for days after the affair had taken place
nowhere with more earnestness than upon the spot where they had
shed each other's blood&mdash;in the bar-room of the hotel.</p>

<p>The conqueror had gained credit and friends.  There were few
who favoured his adversary; and not a few who were gratified at
the result for, short as had been the time since Calhoun's
arrival, there was more than one saloon lounger who had felt the
smart of his insolence.  For this it was presumed the young
Irishman had administered a cure; and there was almost universal
satisfaction at the result.</p>

<p>How the ex-captain carried his discomfiture no one could tell.
He was no longer to be seen swaggering in the saloon of the
"Rough and Ready;" though the cause of his absence was well
understood.  It was not chagrin, but his couch; to which he was
confined by wounds, that, if not skilfully treated, might consign
him to his coffin.</p>

<p>Maurice was in like manner compelled to stay within doors. The
injuries he had received, though not so severe as those of his
antagonist, were nevertheless of such a character as to make it
necessary for him to keep to his chamber&mdash;a small, and
scantily furnished bedroom in "Old Duffer's" hotel; where,
notwithstanding the <i>eclat</i> derived from his conquest, he
was somewhat scurvily treated.</p>

<p>In the hour of his triumph, he had fainted from loss of blood.
He could not be taken elsewhere; though, in the shabby apartment
to which he had been consigned, he might have thought of the
luxurious care that surrounded the couch of his wounded
antagonist.  Fortunately Phelim was by his side, or he might have
been still worse attended to.</p>

<p>"Be Saint Pathrick! it's a shame," half soliloquised this
faithful follower.  "A burnin' shame to squeeze a gintleman into
a hole like this, not bigger than a pig-stoy!  A gintleman like
you, Masther Maurice.  An' thin such aytin' and drinkin'.  Och! a
well fid Oirish pig wud turn up its nose at such traytment.  An'
fwhat div yez think I've heerd Owld Duffer talkin' about
below?"</p>

<p>"I hav'n't the slightest idea, my dear Phelim; nor do I care
straw to know what you've heard Mr Oberdoffer saying below; but
if you don't want him to hear what you are saying above, you'll
moderate your voice a little.  Remember, <i>ma bohil</i>, that
the partitions in this place are only lath and plaster."</p>

<p>"Divil take the partitions; and divil burn them, av he loikes.
Av yez don't care fur fwhat's sed, I don't care far fwhat's
heeurd&mdash;not the snappin' av me fingers.  The Dutchman can't
trate us any worse than he's been doin' already.  For all that,
Masther Maurice, I thought it bist to lit you know."</p>

<p>"Let me know then.  What is it he has been saying?"</p>

<p>"Will, thin; I heerd him tellin' wan av his croneys that
besoides the mate an the dhrink, an the washin', an lodgin', he
intinded to make you pay for the bottles, and glasses, an other
things, that was broke on the night av the shindy."</p>

<p>"Me pay?"</p>

<p>"Yis, yerself, Masther Maurice; an not a pinny charged to the
Yankee. Now I call that downright rascally mane; an nobody but a
dhirty Dutchman wud iver hiv thought av it.  Av there be anythin'
to pay, the man that's bate should be made to showldor the
damage, an that wasn't a discindant av the owld Geralds av
Ballyballagh.  Hoo&mdash;hooch! wudn't I loike to shake a
shaylaylah about Duffer's head for the matther of two minutes?
Wudn't I?"</p>

<p>"What reason did he give for saying that I should pay?  Did
you hear him state any?"</p>

<p>"I did, masther&mdash;the dhirtiest av all raisuns.  He sid
that you were the bird in the hand; an he wud kape ye till yez
sittled the score."</p>

<p>"He'll find himself slightly mistaken about that; and would
perhaps do better by presenting his bill to the bird in the bush.
I shall be willing to pay for half the damage done; but no more.
You may tell him so, if he speak to you about it.  And, in troth,
Phelim, I don't know how I am to do even that.  There must have
been a good many breakages. I remember a great deal of jingling
while we were at it.  If I don't mistake there was a smashed
mirror, or clock dial, or something of the kind."</p>

<p>"A big lookin'-glass, masther; an a crystal somethin', that
was set over the clock.  They say two hunderd dollars.  I don't
belave they were worth wan half av the money."</p>

<p>"Even so, it is a serious matter to me&mdash;just at this
crisis.  I fear, Phelim, you will have to make a journey to the
Alamo, and fetch away some of the household gods we have hidden
there.  To get clear of this scrape I shall have to sacrifice my
spurs, my silver cup, and perhaps my gun!"</p>

<p>"Don't say that, masther!  How are we to live, if the gun
goes?"</p>

<p>"As we best can, <i>ma bohil</i>.  On horseflesh, I suppose:
and the lazo will supply that."</p>

<p>"Be Japers! it wudn't be much worse than the mate Owld Duffer
sits afore us.  It gives me the bellyache ivery time I ate
it."</p>

<p>The conversation was here interrupted by the opening of the
chamber door; which was done without knocking.  A slatternly
servant&mdash;whose sex it would have been difficult to determine
from outward indices&mdash;appeared in the doorway, with a basket
of palm sinnet held extended at the termination of a long sinewy
arm.</p>

<p>"Fwhat is it, Gertrude?" asked Phelim, who, from some previous
information, appeared to be acquainted with the feminine
character of the intruder.</p>

<p>"A shentlemans prot this."</p>

<p>"A gentleman!  Who, Gertrude?"</p>

<p>"Not know, mein herr; he wash a stranger shentlemans."</p>

<p>"Brought by a gentleman.  Who can he be?  See what it in,
Phelim."</p>

<p>Phelim undid the fastenings of the lid, and exposed the
interior of the basket.  It was one of considerable bulk: since
inside were discovered several bottles, apparently containing
wines and cordials, packed among a paraphernalia of sweetmeats,
and other delicacies&mdash;both of the confectionery and the
kitchen.  There was no note accompanying the present&mdash;not
even a direction&mdash;but the trim and elegant style in which it
was done up, proved that it had proceeded from the hands of a
lady.</p>

<p>Maurice turned over the various articles, examining each, as
Phelim supposed, to take note of its value.  Little was he
thinking of this, while searching for the "invoice."</p>

<p>There proved to be none&mdash;not a scrap of paper&mdash;not
so much as a <i>card</i>!</p>

<p>The generosity of the supply&mdash;well-timed as it
was&mdash;bespoke the donor to be some person in affluent
circumstances.  Who could it be?</p>

<p>As Maurice reflected, a fair image came uppermost in his mind;
which he could not help connecting with that of his unknown
benefactor.  Could it be Louise Poindexter?</p>

<p>In spite of certain improbabilities, he was fain to believe it
might; and, so long as the belief lasted, his heart was quivering
with a sweet beatitude.</p>

<p>As he continued to reflect, the improbabilities appeared too
strong for this pleasant supposition; his faith became
overturned; and there remained only a vague unsubstantial
hope.</p>

<p>"A gintleman lift it," spoke the Connemara man, in semi-
soliloquy.  "A gintleman, she sez; a kind gintleman, I say!  Who
div yez think he was, masther?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest idea; unless it may have been some of
the officers of the Port; though I could hardly expect one of
them to think of me in this fashion."</p>

<p>"Nayther yez need.  It wasn't wan av them.  No officer, or
gintleman ayther, phut them things in the basket."</p>

<p>"Why do you think that?"</p>

<p>"Pwhy div I think it!  Och, masther! is it yerself to ask the
quistyun? Isn't there the smell av swate fingers about it?  Jist
look at the nate way them papers is tied up.  That purty kreel
was niver packed by the hand av a man.  It was done by a wuman;
and I'll warrant a raal lady at that."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Phelim!  I know no lady who should take so much
interest in me."</p>

<p>"Aw, murdher!  What a thumpin' big fib!  I know won that shud.
It wud be black ungratytude av she didn't&mdash;afther what yez
did for her.  Didn't yez save her life into the bargain?"</p>

<p>"Of whom are you speaking?"</p>

<p>"Now, don't be desateful, masther.  Yez know that I mane the
purty crayther that come to the hut ridin' Spotty that you
presinted her, widout resavin' a dollar for the mare.  If it
wasn't her that sint ye this hamper, thin Phaylim Onale is the
biggest numskull that was iver born about Ballyballagh.  Be the
Vargin, masther, speakin' of the owld place phuts me in mind of
its paple.  Pwhat wud the blue-eyed colleen say, if she knew yez
were in such danger heeur?"</p>

<p>"Danger! it's all over.  The doctor has said so; and that I
may go out of doors in a week from this time.  Don't distress
yourself about that."</p>

<p>"Troth, masther, yez be only talkin'.  That isn't the danger I
was drhamin' av.  Yez know will enough what I mane.  Maybe yez
have resaved a wound from bright eyes, worse than that from lid
bullets.  Or, maybe, somebody ilse has; an that's why ye've had
the things sint ye."</p>

<p>"You're all wrong, Phelim.  The thing must have come from the
Fort; but whether it did, or not, there's no reason why we should
stand upon ceremony with its contents.  So, here goes to make
trial of them!"</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the apparent relish with which the invalid
partook of the products&mdash;both of collar and
<i>cuisine</i>&mdash;while eating and drinking, his thoughts were
occupied with a still more agreeable theme; with a string of
dreamy conjectures, as to whom he was indebted for the princely
present.</p>

<p>Could it be the young Creole&mdash;the cousin of his direst
enemy as well as his reputed sweetheart?</p>

<p>The thing appeared improbable.</p>

<p>If not she, who else could it be?</p>

<p>The mustanger would have given a horse&mdash;a whole
drove&mdash;to have been assured that Louise Poindexter was the
provider of that luxurious refection.</p>

<p>Two days elapsed, and the donor still remained unknown.</p>

<p>Then the invalid was once more agreeably surprised, by a
second present&mdash;very similar to the first&mdash;another
basket, containing other bottles, and crammed with fresh
"confections."</p>

<p>The Bavarian wench was again questioned; but with no better
result.  A "shentlemans" had "prot" it&mdash;the same "stranger
shentlemans" as before. She could only add that "the shentlemans"
was very "<i>Schwartz</i>," wore a glazed hat, and came to the
tavern mounted upon a mule.</p>

<p>Maurice did not appear to be gratified with this description
of the unknown donor; though no one&mdash;not even
Phelim&mdash;was made the confidant of his thoughts.</p>

<p>In two days afterwards they were toned down to their former
sobriety&mdash;on the receipt of a third basket, "prot by the
Schwartz gentleman" in the glazed hat, who came mounted upon a
mule.</p>

<p>The change could not be explained by the belongings in the
basket&mdash; almost the counterpart of what had been sent
before.  It might be accounted for by the contents of a <i>billet
doux</i>, that accompanied the gift&mdash;attached by a ribbon to
the wickerwork of palm-sinnet.</p>

<p>"'Tis only Isidora!" muttered the mustanger, as he glanced at
the superscription upon the note.</p>

<p>Then opening it with an air of indifference, he
read:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Querido Señor!</span></p>

<p class="letter">Soy quedando por una semana en la casa del tio
Silvio.  De questra desfortuna he oido&mdash;tambien que V. esta

graciosa usarlos, coma una chiquitita memoria del servicio grande

<br>

<p>Literally translated, and in the idiom of the Spanish
language, the note ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcao">Dear Sir</span>,;</p>

<p class="letter">I have been staying for a week at the house of

souvenir of the great service for which I am your debtor.  I

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Isidora Covarubio De Los

<br>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;thanks, sweet Isidora!" muttered the mustanger,
as he refolded the note, and threw it carelessly upon the
coverlet of his couch.  "Ever
grateful&mdash;considerate&mdash;kind!  But for Louise
Poindexter, I might have loved you!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY THREE.<br>

VOWS OF VENGEANCE.</h2>

<p class="first">
CALHOUN, chafing in his chamber, was not the object of such
assiduous solicitude.  Notwithstanding the luxurious appointments
that surrounded him, he could not comfort himself with the
reflection: that he was cared for by living creature.  Truly
selfish in his own heart, he had no faith in friendships; and
while confined to his couch&mdash;not without some fears that it
might be his death-bed&mdash;he experienced the misery of a man
believing that no human being cared a straw whether he should
live or die.</p>

<p>Any sympathy shown to him, was upon the score of relationship.
It could scarce have been otherwise.  His conduct towards his
cousins had not been such as to secure their esteem; while his
uncle, the proud Woodley Poindexter, felt towards him something
akin to aversion, mingled with a subdued fear.</p>

<p>It is true that this feeling was only of recent origin; and
rose out of certain relations that existed between uncle and
nephew.  As already hinted, they stood to one another in the
relationship of debtor and creditor&mdash;or mortgagor and
mortgagee&mdash;the nephew being the latter.  To such an extent
had this indebtedness been carried, that Cassius Calhoun was in
effect the real owner of Casa del Corvo; and could at any moment
have proclaimed himself its master.</p>

<p>Conscious of his power, he had of late been using it to effect
a particular purpose: that is, the securing for his wife, the
woman he had long fiercely loved&mdash;his cousin Louise.  He had
come to know that he stood but little chance of obtaining her
consent: for she had taken but slight pains to conceal her
indifference to his suit.  Trusting to the peculiar influence
established over her father, he had determined on taking no
slight denial.</p>

<p>These circumstances considered, it was not strange that the
ex-officer of volunteers, when stretched upon a sick bed,
received less sympathy from his relatives than might otherwise
have been extended to him.</p>

<p>While dreading, death&mdash;which for a length of time he
actually did&mdash;he had become a little more amiable to those
around him.  The agreeable mood, however, was of short
continuance; and, once assured of recovery, all the natural
savageness of his disposition was restored, along with the
additional bitterness arising from his recent discomfiture.</p>

<p>It had been the pride of his life to exhibit himself as a
successful bully&mdash;the master of every crowd that might
gather around him.  He could no longer claim this credit in
Texas; and the thought harrowed his heart to its very core.</p>

<p>To figure as a defeated man before all the women of the
settlement&mdash; above all in the eyes of her he adored,
defeated by one whom he suspected of being his rival in her
affections&mdash;a more nameless adventurer&mdash;was too much to
be endured with equanimity.  Even an ordinary man would have been
pained by the infliction.  Calhoun writhed under it.</p>

<p>He had no idea of enduring it, as an ordinary man would have
done.  If he could not escape from the disgrace, he was
determined to revenge himself upon its author; and as soon as he
had recovered from the apprehensions entertained about the safety
of his life, he commenced reflecting upon this very subject.</p>

<p>Maurice, the mustanger, must die!  If not by his (Calhoun's)
own hand, then by the hand of another, if such an one was to be
found in the settlement.  There could not be much difficulty in
procuring a confederate.  There are <i>bravoes</i> upon the broad
prairies of Texas, as well as within the walls of Italian cities.
Alas! there is no spot upon earth where gold cannot command the
steel of the assassin.</p>

<p>Calhoun possessed gold&mdash;more than sufficient for such a
purpose; and to such purpose did he determine upon devoting at
least a portion of it.</p>

<p>In the solitude of his sick chamber he set about maturing his
plans; which comprehended the assassination of the mustanger.  He
did not purpose doing the deed himself.  His late defeat had
rendered him fearful of chancing a second encounter with the same
adversary&mdash;even under the advantageous circumstances of a
surprise.  He had become too much encowardised to play the
assassin.  He wanted an accomplice&mdash;an arm to strike for
him.  Where was he to find it?</p>

<p>Unluckily he knew, or fancied he knew, the very man.  There
was a Mexican at the time making abode in the village&mdash;like
Maurice himself&mdash;a mustanger; but one of those with whom the
young Irishman had shown a disinclination to associate.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the men of this peculiar calling are
amongst the greatest reprobates, who have their home in the land
of the "Lone Star." By birth and breed they are mostly Mexicans,
or mongrel Indians; though, not unfrequently, a Frenchman, or
American, finds it a congenial calling.  They are usually the
outcasts of civilised society&mdash;oftener its
outlaws&mdash;who, in the excitement of the chase, and its
concomitant dangers, find, perhaps, some sort of <i>salvo</i> for
a conscience that has been severely tried.</p>

<p>While dwelling within the settlements, these men are not
unfrequently the pests of the society that surrounds
them&mdash;ever engaged in broil and debauch; and when abroad in
the exercise of their calling, they are not always to be
encountered with safety.  More than once is it recorded in the
history of Texas how a company of mustangers has, for the nonce,
converted itself into a band of <i>cuadrilla</i> of
<i>salteadores</i>; or, disguised as Indians, levied black mail
upon the train of the prairie traveller.</p>

<p>One of this kidney was the individual who had become recalled
to the memory of Cassius Calhoun.  The latter remembered having
met the man in the bar-room of the hotel; upon several occasions,
but more especially on the night of the duel.  He remembered that
he had been one of those who had carried him home on the
stretcher; and from some extravagant expressions he had made use
of, when speaking of his antagonist, Calhoun had drawn the
deduction, that the Mexican was no friend to Maurice the
mustanger.</p>

<p>Since then he had learnt that he was Maurice's deadliest
enemy&mdash;himself excepted.</p>

<p>With these data to proceed upon the ex-captain had called the
Mexican to his counsels, and the two were often closeted together
in the chamber of the invalid.</p>

<p>There was nothing in all this to excite suspicion&mdash;even
had Calhoun cared for that.  His visitor was a dealer in horses
and horned cattle. Some transaction in horseflesh might be going
on between them.  So any one would have supposed.  And so for a
time thought the Mexican himself: for in their first interview,
but little other business was transacted between them.  The
astute Mississippian knew better than to declare his ultimate
designs to a stranger; who, after completing an advantageous
horse-trade, was well supplied with whatever he chose to drink,
and cunningly cross-questioned as to the relations in which he
stood towards Maurice the mustanger.</p>

<p>In that first interview, the ex-officer volunteers learnt
enough, to know that he might depend upon his man for any service
he might require&mdash;even to the committal of murder.</p>

<p>The Mexican made no secret of his heartfelt hostility to the
young mustanger.  He did not declare the exact cause of it; but
Calhoun could guess, by certain innuendos introduced during the
conversation, that it was the same as that by which he was
himself actuated&mdash;the same to which may be traced almost
every quarrel that has occurred among men, from Troy to
Texas&mdash;a woman!</p>

<p>The Helen in this case appeared to be some dark-eyed
<i>doncella</i> dwelling upon the Rio Grande, where Maurice had
been in the habit of making an occasional visit, in whose eyes he
had found favour, to the disadvantage of her own
<i>conpaisano</i>.</p>

<p>The Mexican did not give the name; and Calhoun, as he listened
to his explanations, only hoped in his heart that the damsel who
had slighted him might have won the heart of his rival.</p>

<p>During his days of convalescence, several interviews had taken
place between the ex-captain and the intended accomplice in his
purposes of vengeance&mdash;enough, one might suppose, to have
rendered them complete.</p>

<p>Whether they were so, or not, and what the nature of their
hellish designs, were things known only to the brace of kindred
confederates. The outside world but knew that Captain Cassius
Calhoun and Miguel Diaz&mdash;known by the nickname "El Coyote,"
appeared to have taken a fancy for keeping each other's company;
while the more respectable portion of it wondered at such an ill-
starred association.</p>

<h2><a id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.<br>

ON THE AZOTEA.</h2>

<p class="first">
THERE are no sluggards on a Texan plantation.  The daybreak
begins the day; and the bell, conch, or cow-horn, that summons
the dark-skinned proletarians to their toil, is alike the signal
for their master to forsake his more luxurious couch.</p>

<p>Such was the custom of Casa del Corvo under its original
owners: and the fashion was followed by the family of the
American planter&mdash;not from any idea of precedent, but simply
in obedience to the suggestions of Nature. In a climate of almost
perpetual spring, the sweet matutinal moments are not to be
wasted in sleep.  The <i>siesta</i> belongs to the hours of noon;
when all nature appears to shrink under the smiles of the solar
luminary&mdash;as if surfeited with their superabundance.</p>

<p>On his reappearance at morn the sun is greeted with renewed
joy.  Then do the tropical birds spread their resplendent
plumage&mdash;the flowers their dew-besprinkled petals&mdash;to
receive his fervent kisses.  All nature again seems glad, to
acknowledge him as its god.</p>

<p>Resplendent as any bird that flutters among the foliage of
south-western Texas&mdash;fair as any flower that blooms within
it&mdash;gladdest was she who appeared upon the housetop of Casa
del Corvo.</p>

<p>Aurora herself, rising from her roseate couch, looked not
fresher than the young Creole, as she stood contemplating the
curtains of that very couch, from which a Texan sun was slowly
uplifting his globe of burning gold.</p>

<p>She was standing upon the edge of the azotea that fronted
towards the east; her white hand resting upon the copestone of
the parapet still wet with the dews of the night, under her eyes
was the garden, enclosed within a curve of the river; beyond the
bluff formed by the opposite bank; and further still, the wide-
spreading plateau of the prairie.</p>

<p>Was she looking at a landscape, that could scarce fail to
challenge admiration?  No.</p>

<p>Equally was she unconscious of the ascending sun; though, like
some fair pagan, did she appear to be in prayer at its
apprising!</p>

<p>Listened she to the voices of the birds, from garden and grove
swelling harmoniously around her?</p>

<p>On the contrary, her ear was not bent to catch any sound, nor
her eye intent upon any object.  Her glance was wandering, as if
her thoughts went not with it, but were dwelling upon some theme,
neither present nor near.</p>

<p>In contrast with the cheerful brightness of the sky, there was
a shadow upon her brow; despite the joyous warbling of the birds,
there was the sign of sadness on her cheek.</p>

<p>She was alone.  There was no one to take note of this
melancholy mood, nor inquire into its cause.</p>

<p>The cause was declared in a few low murmured words, that fell,
as if involuntarily, from her lips.</p>

<p>"He may be dangerously wounded&mdash;perhaps even to
death?"</p>

<p>Who was the object of this solicitude so hypothetically
expressed?</p>

<p>The invalid that lay below, almost under her feet, in a
chamber of the hacienda&mdash;her cousin Cassius Calhoun?</p>

<p>It could scarce be he.  The doctor had the day before
pronounced him out of danger, and on the way to quick recovery.
Any one listening to her soliloquy&mdash;after a time continued
in the same sad tone&mdash;would have been convinced it was not
he.</p>

<p>"I may not send to inquire.  I dare not even ask after him.  I
fear to trust any of our people.  He may be in some poor
place&mdash;perhaps uncourteously treated&mdash;perhaps
neglected?  Would that I could convey to him a
message&mdash;something more&mdash;without any one being the
wiser!  I wonder what has become of Zeb Stump?"</p>

<p>As if some instinct whispered her, that there was a
possibility of Zeb making his appearance, she turned her eyes
towards the plain on the opposite side of the river&mdash;where a
road led up and down.  It was the common highway between Fort
Inge and the plantations on the lower Leona. It traversed the
prairie at some distance from the river bank; approaching it only
at one point, where the channel curved in to the base of the
bluffs.  A reach of the road, of half a mile in length, was
visible in the direction of the Fort; as also a cross-path that
led to a ford; thence running on to the hacienda.  In the
opposite direction&mdash; down the stream&mdash;the view was open
for a like length, until the chapparal on both sides closing in,
terminated the savanna.</p>

<p>The young lady scanned the road leading towards Fort Inge. Zeb
Stump should come that way.  He was not in sight; nor was any one
else.</p>

<p>She could not feel disappointment.  She had no reason to
expect him. She had but raised her eyes in obedience to an
instinct.</p>

<p>Something more than instinct caused her, after a time, to turn
round, and scrutinise the plain in the opposite quarter.</p>

<p>If expecting some one to appear that way, she was not
disappointed.  A horse was just stepping out from among the
trees, where the road debouched from the chapparal.  He was
ridden by one, who, at first sight, appeared to be a man, clad in
a sort of Arab costume; but who, on closer scrutiny, and despite
the style of equitation&mdash;<i>a la Duchesse de
Berri</i>&mdash;was unquestionably of the other sex&mdash;a lady.
There was not much of her face to be seen; but through the
shadowy opening of the <i>rebozo</i>&mdash;rather carelessly
<i>tapado</i>&mdash;could be traced an oval facial outline,
somewhat brownly "complected," But with a carmine tinting upon
the cheeks, and above this a pair of eyes whose sparkle appeared
to challenge comparison with the brightest object either on the
earth, or in the sky.</p>

<p>Neither did the loosely falling folds of the lady's scarf, nor
her somewhat <i>outre</i> attitude in the saddle, hinder the
observer from coming to the conclusion, that her figure was quite
as attractive as her face.</p>

<p>The man following upon the mule, six lengths of his animal in
the rear, by his costume&mdash;as well as the respectful distance
observed&mdash;was evidently only an attendant.</p>

<p>"Who can that woman be?" was the muttered interrogatory of
Louise Poindexter, as with quick action she raised the lorgnette
to her eyes, and directed it upon the oddly apparelled figure.
"Who <i>can</i> she be?" was repeated in a tone of greater
deliberation, as the glass came down, and the naked eye was
entrusted to complete the scrutiny.  "A Mexican, of course; the
man on the mule her servant.  Some grand señora, I suppose?  I
thought they had all gone to the other side of the Rio Grande.  A
basket carried by the attendant.  I wonder what it contains; and
what errand she can have to the Port&mdash;it may be the village.
'Tis the third time I've seen her passing within this week?  She
must be from some of the plantations below!"</p>

<p>What an outlandish style of riding!  <i>Par Dieu</i>!  I'm
told it's not uncommon among the daughters of Anahuac.  What if I
were to take to it myself?  No doubt it's much the easiest way;
though if such a spectacle were seen in the States it would be
styled unfeminine.  How our Puritan mammas would scream out
against it!  I think I hear them.  Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>The mirth thus begotten was but of momentary duration.  There
came a change over the countenance of the Creole, quick as a
drifting cloud darkens the disc of the sun.  It was not a return
to that melancholy so late shadowing it; though something equally
serious&mdash;as might be told by the sudden blanching of her
cheeks.</p>

<p>The cause could only be looked for in the movements of the
scarfed equestrian on the other side of the river.  An antelope
had sprung up, out of some low shrubbery growing by the roadside.
The creature appeared to have made its first bound from under the
counter of the horse&mdash;a splendid animal, that, in a moment
after, was going at full gallop in pursuit of the affrighted
"pronghorn;" while his rider, with her rebozo suddenly flung from
her face, its fringed ends streaming behind her back, was seen
describing, with her right arm, a series of circular sweeps in
the air!</p>

<p>"What is the woman going to do?" was the muttered
interrogatory of the spectator upon the house-top.  "Ha!  As I
live, 'tis a lazo!"</p>

<p>The señora was not long in giving proof of skill in the use of
the national implement:&mdash;by flinging its noose around the
antelope's neck, and throwing the creature in its tracks!</p>

<p>The attendant rode up to the place where it lay struggling;
dismounted from his mule; and, stooping over the prostrate
pronghorn, appeared to administer the <i>coup de grace</i>. Then,
flinging the carcass over the croup of his saddle, he climbed
back upon his mule, and spurred after his mistress&mdash;who had
already recovered her lazo, readjusted her scarf, and was riding
onward, as if nothing had occurred worth waiting for!</p>

<p>It was at that moment&mdash;when the noose was seen circling
in the air&mdash;that the shadow had reappeared upon the
countenance or the Creole.  It was not surprise that caused it,
but an emotion of a different character&mdash;a thought far more
unpleasant.</p>

<p>Nor did it pass speedily away.  It was still
there&mdash;though a white hand holding the lorgnette to her eye
might have hindered it from being seen&mdash;still there, as long
as the mounted figures were visible upon the open road; and even
after they had passed out of sight behind the screening of the
acacias.</p>

<p>"I wonder&mdash;oh, I wonder if it be she!  My own age, he
said&mdash;not quite so tall.  The description suits&mdash;so far
as one may judge at this distance. Has her home on the Rio
Grande.  Comes occasionally to the Leona, to visit some
relatives.  Who are they?  Why did I not ask him the name? <i>I
wonder&mdash;oh, I wonder if it be she</i>!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.<br>

A GIFT UNGIVEN.</h2>

<p class="first">
FOR some minutes after the lady of the lazo and her attendant
had passed out of sight, Louise Poindexter pursued the train of
reflection&mdash;started by the somewhat singular episode of
which she had been spectator.  Her attitude, and air, of
continued dejection told that her thoughts had not been directed
into a more cheerful channel.</p>

<p>Rather the reverse.  Once or twice before had her mind given
way to imaginings, connected with that accomplished
<i>equestrienne</i>; and more than once had she speculated upon
her purpose in riding up the road. The incident just witnessed
had suddenly changed her conjectures into suspicions of an
exceedingly unpleasant nature.</p>

<p>It was a relief to her, when a horseman appeared coming out of
the chapparal, at the point where the others had ridden in; a
still greater relief, when he was seen to swerve into the cross
path that conducted to the hacienda, and was recognised, through
the lorgnette, as Zeb Stump the hunter.</p>

<p>The face of the Creole became bright again&mdash;almost to
gaiety.  There was something ominous of good in the opportune
appearance of the honest backwoodsman.</p>

<p>"The man I was wanting to see!" she exclaimed in joyous
accents.  "<i>He</i> can bear me a message; and perhaps tell who
<i>she</i> is.  He must have met her on the road.  That will
enable me to introduce the subject, without Zeb having any
suspicion of my object.  Even with him I must be
circumspect&mdash;after what has happened.  Ah, me!  Not much
should I care, if I were sure of <i>his</i> caring for me.  How
provoking his indifference! And to me&mdash;Louise Poindexter!
<i>Par dieu</i>!  Let it proceed much further, and I shall try to
escape from the toils if&mdash;if&mdash;I should crush my poor
heart in the attempt!"</p>

<p>It need scarce be said that the individual, whose esteem was
so coveted, was not Zeb Stump.</p>

<p>Her next speech, however, was addressed to Zeb, as he reined
up in front of the hacienda.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr Stump!" hailed a voice, to which the old hunter
delighted to listen.  "I'm so glad to see you.  Dismount, and
come up here!  I know you're a famous climber, and won't mind a
flight of stone stairs. There's a view from this housetop that
will reward you for your trouble."</p>

<p>"Thur's suthin' on the house-top theear," rejoined the hunter,
"the view o' which 'ud reward Zeb Stump for climbin' to the top
o' a steamboat chimbly; 'an thet's yurself, Miss Lewaze.  I'll
kum up, soon as I ha' stabled the ole maar, which shall be dud in
the shakin' o' a goat's tail.  Gee-up, ole gal!" he continued,
addressing himself to the mare, after he had dismounted, "Hold up
yur head, an may be Plute hyur 'll gie ye a wheen o' corn shucks
for yur breakfist."</p>

<p>"Ho&mdash;ho!  Mass 'Tump," interposed the sable coachman,
making his appearance in the <i>patio</i>.  "Dat same do dis
nigga&mdash;gub um de shucks wi' de yaller corn inside ob dem.
Ho&mdash;ho!  You gwup 'tairs to de young missa; an Plute he no
'gleck yar ole mar."</p>

<p>"Yur a dod-rotted good sample o' a nigger, Plute; an the nix
occashun I shows about hyur, I'll fetch you a 'possum&mdash;wi'
the meat on it as tender as a two-year old chicken.  Thet's what
I'm boun' ter do."</p>

<p>After delivering himself of this promise, Zeb commenced
ascending the stone stairway; not by single steps, but by two,
and sometimes three, at a stride.</p>

<p>He was soon upon the housetop; where he was once more welcomed
by the young mistress of the mansion.</p>

<p>Her excited manner, and the eagerness with which she conducted
him to a remote part of the azotea, told the astute hunter, that
he had been summoned thither for some other purpose than enjoying
the prospect.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mr Stump!" said she, as she clutched the sleeve of
the blanket coat in her delicate fingers, and looked inquiringly
into Zeb's grey eye&mdash;"You must know all.  How is he?  Are
his wounds of a dangerous nature?"</p>

<p>"If you refar to Mister Cal-hoon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no.  I know all about him.  It's not of Mr
Calhoun I'm speaking."</p>

<p>"Wall, Miss Lewasse; thur air only one other as I know of in
these parts thet hev got wownds; an thet air's Maurice the
mowstanger.  Mout it be thet ere individooal yur inquirin'
abeout?"</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;it is!  You know I cannot be indifferent to his
welfare, notwithstanding the misfortune of his having quarrelled
with my cousin. You are aware that he rescued me&mdash;twice I
may say&mdash;from imminent peril. Tell me&mdash;is he in great
danger?"</p>

<p>Such earnestness could no longer be trifled with.  Zeb without
further parley, made reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ne'er a morsel o' danger.  Thur's a bullet-hole jest above
the ankle-jeint.  It don't signerfy more'n the scratch o' a
kitting.  Thur's another hev goed through the flesh o' the young
fellur's left arm.  It don't signerfy neyther&mdash;only thet it
drawed a good sup o' the red out o' him.  Howsomdever, he's all
right now; an expecks to be out o' doors in a kupple o' days, or
tharabout.  He sez that an hour in the seddle, an a skoot acrosst
the purayra, 'ud do him more good than all the docters in Texas.
I reckon it wud; but the docter&mdash;it's the surgint o' the
Fort as attends on him&mdash;he won't let him git to grass yit a
bit."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"He air stayin' at the hotel&mdash;whar the skrimmage tuk
place."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is not well waited upon?  It's a rough place, I've
heard. He may not have any delicacies&mdash;such as an invalid
stands in need of? Stay here, Mr Stump, till I come up to you
again.  I have something I wish to send to him.  I know I can
trust you to deliver it.  Won't you? I'm sure you will.  I shall
be with you in six seconds."</p>

<p>Without waiting to note the effect of her speech, the young
lady tripped lightly along the passage, and as lightly descended
the stone stairway.</p>

<p>Presently she reappeared&mdash;bringing with her a good-sized
hamper; which was evidently filled with eatables, with something
to send them down.</p>

<p>"Now dear old Zeb, you will take this to Mr Gerald?  It's only
some little things that Florinda has put up; some cordials and
jellies and the like, such as sick people at times have a craving
for.  They are not likely to be kept in the hotel.  Don't tell
<i>him</i> where they come from&mdash;<i>neither him, nor any one
else</i>.  You won't?  I know you won't, you dear good
giant."</p>

<p>"He may depend on Zeb Stump for thet, Miss Lewaze.  Nobody air
a goin' to be a bit the wiser about who sent these hyur
delekissies; though, for the matter o' cakes an kickshaws, an all
that sort o' thing, the mowstanger hain't had much reezun to
complain.  He hev been serplied wi' enuf o' them to hev filled
the bellies o' a hul school o' shugar-babbies."</p>

<p>"Ha!  Supplied already!  By whom?"</p>

<p>"Wal, thet theer this chile can't inform ye, Miss Lewaze; not
be-knowin' it hisself.  I on'y hyurd they wur fetched to the
tavern in baskets, by some sort o' a sarving-man as air a
Mexikin.  I've seed the man myself. Fact, I've jest this minnit
met him, ridin' arter a wuman sot stridy legs in her seddle, as
most o' these Mexikin weemen ride.  I reck'n he be her sarvingt,
as he war keepin' a good ways ahint, and toatin' a basket jest
like one o' them Maurice hed got arready.  Like enuf it air
another lot o' Rickshaws they wur takin' to the tavern."</p>

<p>There was no need to trouble Zeb Stump with further cross-
questioning. A whole history was supplied by that single speech.
The case was painfully clear.  In the regard of Maurice Gerald,
Louise Poindexter had a rival&mdash;perhaps something more.  The
lady of the lazo was either his <i>fiancee</i>, or his
mistress!</p>

<p>It was not by accident&mdash;though to Zeb Stump it may have
seemed so&mdash;that the hamper, steadied for a time, upon the
coping of the balustrade, and still retained in the hand of the
young Creole, escaped from her clutch, and fell with a crash upon
the stones below.  The bottles were broken, and their contents
spilled into the stream that surged along the basement of the
wall.</p>

<p>The action of the arm that produced this effect, apparently
springing from a spasmodic and involuntary effort, was
nevertheless due to design; and Louise Poindexter, as she leant
over the parapet, and contemplated the ruin she had caused, felt
as if her heart was shattered like the glass that lay glistening
below!</p>

<p>"How unfortunate!" said she, making a feint to conceal her
chagrin. "The dainties are destroyed, I declare!  What will
Florinda say?  After all, if Mr Gerald be so well attended to, as
you say he is, he'll not stand in need of them.  I'm glad to hear
he hasn't been neglected&mdash;one who has done me a service.
But, Mr Stump, you needn't say anything of this, or that I
inquired after him.  You know his late antagonist is our near
relative; and it might cause scandal in the settlement.  Dear
Zeb, you promise me?"</p>

<p>"Swa-ar it ef ye like.  Neery word, Miss Lewaze, neery word;
ye kin depend on ole Zeb."</p>

<p>"I know it.  Come!  The sun is growing hot up here.  Let as go
down, and see whether we can find you such a thing as a glass of
your favourite Monongahela.  Come!"</p>

<p>With an assumed air of cheerfulness, the young Creole glided
across the azotea; and, trilling the "New Orleans Waltz," once
more commenced descending the <i>escalera</i>.</p>

<p>In eager acceptance of the invitation, the old hunter followed
close upon her skirts; and although, by habit, stoically
indifferent to feminine charms&mdash;and with his thoughts at
that moment chiefly bent upon the promised Monongahela&mdash;he
could not help admiring those ivory shoulders brought so
conspicuously under his eyes.</p>

<p>But for a short while was he permitted to indulge in the
luxurious spectacle.  On reaching the bottom of the stair his
fair hostess bade him a somewhat abrupt adieu.  After the
revelations he had so unwittingly made, his conversation seemed
no longer agreeable; and she, late desirous of interrogating, was
now contented to leave him alone with the Monongahela, as she
hastened to hide her chagrin in the solitude of her chamber.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life Louise Poindexter felt the
pangs of jealousy.  It was her first real love: for she was in
love with Maurice Gerald.</p>

<p>A solicitude like that shown for him by the Mexican señora,
could scarce spring from simple friendship?  Some closer tie must
have been established between them?  So ran the reflections of
the now suffering Creole.</p>

<p>From what Maurice had said&mdash;from what she had herself
seen&mdash;the lady of the lazo was just such a woman as should
win the affections of such a man.  Hers were accomplishments he
might naturally be expected to admire.</p>

<p>Her figure had appeared perfect under the magnifying effect of
the lens. The face had not been so fairly viewed, and was still
undetermined. Was it in correspondence with the form?  Was it
such as to secure the love of a man so much master of his
passions, as the mustanger appeared to be?</p>

<p>The mistress of Casa del Corvo could not rest, till she had
satisfied herself on this score.  As soon as Zeb Stump had taken
his departure, she ordered the spotted mare to be saddled; and,
riding out alone, she sought the crossing of the river; and
thence proceeded to the highway on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Advancing in the direction of the Fort, as she expected, she
soon encountered the Mexican señora on her return; no
<i>señora</i> according to the exact signification of the term,
but a <i>señorita</i>&mdash;a young lady, not older than
herself.</p>

<p>At the place of their meeting, the road ran under the shadow
of the trees.  There was no sun to require the coifing of the
rebozo upon the crown of the Mexican equestrian.  The scarf had
fallen upon her shoulders, laying bare a head of hair, in
luxuriance rivalling the tail of a wild steed, in colour the
plumage of a crow.  It formed the framing of a face, that,
despite a certain darkness of complexion, was charmingly
attractive.</p>

<p>Good breeding permitted only a glance at it in passing; which
was returned by a like courtesy on the part of the stranger.  But
as the two rode on, back to back, going in opposite directions,
neither could restrain herself from turning round in the saddle,
and snatching a second glance at the other.</p>

<p>Their reflections were not very dissimilar: if Louise
Poindexter had already learnt something of the individual thus
encountered, the latter was not altogether ignorant of <i>her</i>
existence.</p>

<p>We shall not attempt to portray the thoughts of the señorita
consequent on that encounter.  Suffice it to say, that those of
the Creole were even more sombre than when she sallied forth on
that errand of inspection; and that the young mistress of Casa
del Corvo rode back to the mansion, all the way seated in her
saddle in an attitude that betokened the deepest dejection.</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" said she, after passing her supposed rival upon
the road. "Yes; too beautiful to be his friend!"</p>

<p>Louise was speaking to her own conscience; or she might have
been more chary of her praise.</p>

<p>"I cannot have any doubt," continued she, "of the relationship
that exists between them&mdash;He loves her!&mdash;he loves her!
It accounts for his cold indifference to me?  I've been mad to
risk my heart's happiness in such an ill-starred
entanglement!</p>

<p>"And now to disentangle it!  Now to banish him from my
thoughts!  Ah! 'tis easily said!  Can I?"</p>

<p>"I shall see him no more.  That, at least, is possible.  After
what has occurred, he will not come to our house.  We can only
meet by accident; and that accident I must be careful to avoid.
Oh, Maurice Gerald! tamer of wild steeds! you have subdued a
spirit that may suffer long&mdash;perhaps never recover from the
lesson!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY SIX.<br>

STILL ON THE AZOTEA.</h2>

<p class="first">
TO banish from the thoughts one who has been passionately
loved is a simple impossibility.  Time may do much to subdue the
pain of an unreciprocated passion, and absence more.  But neither
time, nor absence, can hinder the continued recurrence of that
longing for the lost loved one&mdash;or quiet the heart aching
with that void that has never been satisfactorily filled.</p>

<p>Louise Poindexter had imbibed a passion that could not be
easily stifled.  Though of brief existence, it had been of rapid
growth&mdash; vigorously overriding all obstacles to its
indulgence.  It was already strong enough to overcome such
ordinary scruples as parental consent, or the inequality of rank;
and, had it been reciprocated, neither would have stood in the
way, so far as she herself was concerned.  For the former, she
was of age; and felt&mdash;as most of her countrywomen do&mdash;
capable of taking care of herself.  For the latter, who ever
really loved that cared a straw for class, or caste?  Love has no
such meanness in its composition.  At all events, there was none
such in the passion of Louise Poindexter.</p>

<p>It could scarce be called the first illusion of her life.  It
was, however, the first, where disappointment was likely to prove
dangerous to the tranquillity of her spirit.</p>

<p>She was not unaware of this.  She anticipated unhappiness for
a while&mdash; hoping that time would enable her to subdue the
expected pain.</p>

<p>At first, she fancied she would find a friend in her own
strong will; and another in the natural buoyancy of her spirit.
But as the days passed, she found reason to distrust both: for in
spite of both, she could not erase from her thoughts the image of
the man who had so completely captivated her imagination.</p>

<p>There were times when she hated him, or tried to do
so&mdash;when she could have killed him, or seen him killed,
without making an effort to save him!  They were but moments;
each succeeded by an interval of more righteous reflection, when
she felt that the fault was hers alone, as hers only the
misfortune.</p>

<p><i>No</i> matter for this.  It mattered not if he had been her
enemy&mdash;the enemy of all mankind.  If Lucifer
himself&mdash;to whom in her wild fancy she had once likened
him&mdash;she would have loved him all the same!</p>

<p>And it would have proved nothing abnormal in her
disposition&mdash;nothing to separate her from the rest of
womankind, all the world over.  In the mind of man, or woman
either, there is no connection between the <i>moral</i> and the
<i>passional</i>.  They are as different from each other as fire
from water.  They may chance to run in the same channel; but they
may go diametrically opposite.  In other words, we may love the
very being we hate&mdash;ay, the one we despise!</p>

<p>Louise Poindexter could neither hate, nor despise, Maurice
Gerald.  She could only endeavour to feel indifference.</p>

<p>It was a vain effort, and ended in failure.  She could not
restrain herself from ascending to the azotea, and scrutinising
the road where she had first beheld the cause of her jealousy.
Each day, and almost every hour of the day, was the ascent
repeated.</p>

<p>Still more.  Notwithstanding her resolve, to avoid the
accident of an encounter with the man who had made her miserable,
she was oft in the saddle and abroad, scouring the country
around&mdash;riding through the streets of the village&mdash;with
no other object than to meet him.</p>

<p>During the three days that followed that unpleasant discovery,
once again had she seen&mdash;from the housetop as
before&mdash;the lady of the lazo <i>en route</i> up the road, as
before accompanied by her attendant with the pannier across his
arm&mdash;that Pandora's box that had bred such mischief in her
mind&mdash;while she herself stood trembling with
jealousy&mdash;envious of the other's errand.</p>

<p>She knew more now, though not much.  Only had she learnt the
name and social standing of her rival.  The Dona Isidora
Covarubio de los Llanos&mdash;daughter of a wealthy haciendado,
who lived upon the Rio Grande, and niece to another whose estate
lay upon the Leona, a mile beyond the boundaries of her father's
new purchase.  An eccentric young lady, as some thought, who
could throw a lazo, tame a wild steed, or anything else excepting
her own caprices.</p>

<p>Such was the character of the Mexican señorita, as known to
the American settlers on the Leona.</p>

<p>A knowledge of it did not remove the jealous suspicions of the
Creole. On the contrary, it tended to confirm them.  Such
practices were her own predilections.  She had been created with
an instinct to admire them. She supposed that others must do the
same.  The young Irishman was not likely to be an exception.</p>

<p>There was an interval of several days&mdash;during which the
lady of the lazo was not seen again.</p>

<p>"He has recovered from his wounds?" reflected the Creole.  "He
no longer needs such unremitting attention."</p>

<p>She was upon the azotea at the moment of making this
reflection&mdash; lorgnette in hand, as she had often been
before.</p>

<p>It was in the morning, shortly after sunrise: the hour when
the Mexican had been wont to make her appearance.  Louise had
been looking towards the quarter whence the señorita might have
been expected to come.</p>

<p>On turning her eyes in the opposite direction, she
beheld&mdash;that which caused her something more than surprise.
She saw Maurice Gerald, mounted on horseback, and riding down the
road!</p>

<p>Though seated somewhat stiffly in the saddle, and going at a
slow pace, it was certainly he.  The glass declared his identity;
at the same time disclosing the fact, that his left arm was
suspended in a sling.</p>

<p>On recognising him, she shrank behind the parapet&mdash;as she
did so, giving utterance to a suppressed cry.</p>

<p>Why that anguished utterance?  Was it the sight of the
disabled arm, or the pallid face: for the glass had enabled her
to distinguish both?</p>

<p>Neither one nor the other.  Neither could be a cause of
surprise. Besides, it was an exclamation far differently intoned
to those of either pity or astonishment.  It was an expression of
sorrow, that had for its origin some heartfelt chagrin.</p>

<p>The invalid was convalescent.  He no longer needed to be
visited by his nurse.  He was on the way to visit <i>her</i>!</p>

<p>Cowering behind the parapet&mdash;screened by the flower-spike
of the <i>yucca</i>&mdash;Louise Poindexter watched the passing
horseman.  The lorgnette enabled her to note every movement made
by him&mdash;almost to the play of his features.</p>

<p>She felt some slight gratification on observing that he turned
his face at intervals and fixed his regard upon Casa del Corvo.
It was increased, when on reaching a copse, that stood by the
side of the road, and nearly opposite the house, he reined up
behind the trees, and for a long time remained in the same spot,
as if reconnoitring the mansion.</p>

<p>She almost conceived a hope, that he might be thinking of its
mistress!</p>

<p>It was but a gleam of joy, departing like the sunlight under
the certain shadow of an eclipse.  It was succeeded by a sadness
that might be appropriately compared to such shadow: for to her
the world at that moment seemed filled with gloom.</p>

<p>Maurice Gerald had ridden on.  He had entered the chapparal;
and become lost to view with the road upon which he was
riding.</p>

<p>Whither was he bound?  Whither, but to visit Dona Isidora
Covarubio de los Llanos?</p>

<p>It mattered not that he returned within less than an hour.
They might have met in the woods&mdash;within eyeshot of that
jealous spectator&mdash;but for the screening of the trees.  An
hour was sufficient interview&mdash;for lovers, who could every
day claim unrestricted indulgence.</p>

<p>It mattered not, that in passing upwards he again cast regards
towards Casa del Corvo; again halted behind the copse, and passed
some time in apparent scrutiny of the mansion.</p>

<p>It was but mockery&mdash;or exultation.  He might well feel
triumphant; but why should he be cruel, with kisses upon his
lips&mdash;the kisses he had received from the Dona Isidora
Covarubio de los Llanos?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.<br>

I LOVE YOU!&mdash;I LOVE YOU!</h2>

<p class="first">
LOUISE POINDEXTER upon the azotea again&mdash;again to be
subjected to a fresh chagrin!  That broad stone stairway trending
up to the housetop, seemed to lead only to spectacles that gave
her pain.  She had mentally vowed no more to ascend it&mdash;at
least for a long time.  Something stronger than her strong will
combatted&mdash;and successfully&mdash;the keeping of that vow.
It was broken ere the sun of another day had dried the dew from
the grass of the prairie.</p>

<p>As on the day before, she stood by the parapet scanning the
road on the opposite side of the river; as before, she saw the
horseman with the slung arm ride past; as before, she crouched to
screen herself from observation.</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>He was going downwards, as on the day preceding.  In like
manner did he cast long glances towards the hacienda, and made
halt behind the clump of trees that grew opposite.</p>

<p>Her heart fluttered between hope and fear.  There was an
instant when she felt half inclined to show herself.  Fear
prevailed; and in the next instant he was gone.</p>

<p>Whither?</p>

<p>The self-asked interrogatory was but the same as of yesterday.
It met with a similar response.</p>

<p>Whither, if not to meet Dona Isidora Covarubio de los
Llanos?</p>

<p>Could there be a doubt of it?</p>

<p>If so, it was soon to be determined.  In less than twenty
minutes after, a parded steed was seen upon the same
road&mdash;and in the same direction&mdash; with a lady upon its
back.</p>

<p>The jealous heart of the Creole could hold out no longer.  No
truth could cause greater torture than she was already suffering
through suspicion.  She had resolved on assuring herself, though
the knowledge should prove fatal to the last faint remnant of her
hopes.</p>

<p>She entered the chapparal where the mustanger had ridden in
scarce twenty minutes before.  She rode on beneath the flitting
shadows of the acacias.  She rode in silence upon the soft
turf&mdash;keeping close to the side of the path, so that the
hoof might not strike against stones.  The long pinnate fronds,
drooping down to the level of her eyes, mingled with the plumes
in her hat.  She sate her saddle crouchingly, as if to avoid
being observed&mdash;all the while with earnest glance scanning
the open space before her.</p>

<p>She reached the crest of a hill which commanded a view beyond.
There was a house in sight surrounded by tall trees.  It might
have been termed a mansion.  It was the residence of Don Silvio
Martinez, the uncle of Dona Isidora.  So much had she learnt
already.</p>

<p>There were other houses to be seen upon the plain below; but
on this one, and the road leading to it, the eyes of the Creole
became fixed in a glance of uneasy interrogation.</p>

<p>For a time she continued her scrutiny without satisfaction. No
one appeared either at the house, or near it.  The private road
leading to the residence of the haciendado, and the public
highway, were alike without living forms.  Some horses were
straying over the pastures; but not one with a rider upon his
back.</p>

<p>Could the lady have ridden out to meet him, or Maurice gone
in?</p>

<p>Were they at that moment in the woods, or within the walls of
the house? If the former, was Don Silvio aware of it?  If the
latter, was he at home&mdash;an approving party to the
assignation?</p>

<p>With such questions was the Creole afflicting herself, when
the neigh of a horse broke abruptly on her ear, followed by the
chinking of a shod hoof against the stones of the causeway.  She
looked below: for she had halted upon the crest, a steep
acclivity.  The mustanger was ascending it&mdash;riding directly
towards her.  She might have seen him sooner, had she not been
occupied with the more distant view.</p>

<p>He was alone, as he had ridden past Casa del Corvo.  There was
nothing to show that he had recently been in company&mdash;much
less in the company of an <i>inamorata</i>.</p>

<p>It was too late for Louise to shun him.  The spotted mustang
had replied to the salutation of an old acquaintance.  Its rider
was constrained to keep her ground, till the mustanger came
up.</p>

<p>"Good day, Miss Poindexter?" said he&mdash;for upon the
prairies it is <i>not</i> etiquette for the lady to speak first.
"Alone?"</p>

<p>"Alone, sir.  And why not?"</p>

<p>"'Tis a solitary ride among the chapparals.  But true: I think
I've heard you say you prefer that sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"You appear to like it yourself, Mr Gerald.  To you, however,
it is not so solitary, I presume?"</p>

<p>"In faith I do like it; and just for that very reason.  I have
the misfortune to live at a tavern, or 'hotel,' as mine host is
pleased to call it; and one gets so tired of the
noises&mdash;especially an invalid, as I have the bad luck to
be&mdash;that a ride along this quiet road is something akin to
luxury.  The cool shade of these acacias&mdash;which the Mexicans
have vulgarised by the name of <i>mezquites</i>&mdash;with the
breeze that keeps constantly circulating through their fan-like
foliage, would invigorate the feeblest of frames.  Don't you
think so, Miss Poindexter?"</p>

<p>"You should know best, sir," was the reply vouchsafed, after
some seconds of embarrassment.  "You, who have so often tried
it."</p>

<p>"Often!  I have been only twice down this road since I have
been able to sit in my saddle.  But, Miss Poindexter, may I ask
how you knew that I have been this way at all?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" rejoined Louise, her colour going and coming as she
spoke, "how could I help knowing it?  I am in the habit of
spending much time on the housetop.  The view, the breeze, the
music of the birds, ascending from the garden below, makes it a
delightful spot&mdash;especially in the cool of the morning.  Our
roof commands a view of this road.  Being up there, how could I
avoid seeing you as you passed&mdash;that is, so long as you were
not under <i>the shade of the acacias</i>?"</p>

<p>"You saw me, then?" said Maurice, with an embarrassed air,
which was not caused by the innuendo conveyed in her last
words&mdash;which he could not have comprehended&mdash;but by a
remembrance of how he had himself behaved while riding along the
reach of open road.</p>

<p>"How could I help it?" was the ready reply.  "The distance is
scarce six hundred yards.  Even a lady, mounted upon a steed much
smaller than yours, was sufficiently conspicuous to be
identified.  When I saw her display her wonderful skill, by
strangling a poor little antelope with her lazo, I knew it could
be no other than she whose accomplishments you were so good as to
give me an account of."</p>

<p>"Isidora?"</p>

<p>"Isidora!"</p>

<p>"Ah; true!  She has been here for some time."</p>

<p>"And has been very kind to Mr Maurice Gerald?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, it is true.  She has been very kind; though I have
had no chance of thanking her.  With all her friendship for poor
me, she is a great hater of us foreign invaders; and would not
condescend to step over the threshold of Mr Oberdoffer's
hotel."</p>

<p>"Indeed!  I suppose she preferred meeting you under the
<i>shade of the acacias</i>!"</p>

<p>"I have not met her at all; at least, not for many months; and
may not for months to come&mdash;now that she has gone back to
her home on the Rio Grande."</p>

<p>"Are you speaking the truth, sir?  You have not seen her
since&mdash;she is gone away from the house of her uncle?"</p>

<p>"She has," replied Maurice, exhibiting surprise.  "Of course,
I have not seen her.  I only knew she was here by her sending me
some delicacies while I was ill.  In truth, I stood in need of
them.  The hotel <i>cuisine</i> is none of the nicest; nor was I
the most welcome of Mr Oberdoffer's guests.  The Dona Isidora has
been but too grateful for the slight service I once did her."</p>

<p>"A service!  May I ask what it was, Mr Gerald?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly.  It was merely a chance.  I had the
opportunity of being useful to the young lady, in once rescuing
her from some rude Indians&mdash; Wild Oat and his
Seminoles&mdash;into whose hands she had fallen, while making a
journey from the Rio Grande to visit her uncle on the
Leona&mdash; Don Silvio Martinez, whose house you can see from
here.  The brutes had got drunk; and were threatening&mdash;not
exactly her life&mdash;though that was in some danger,
but&mdash;well, the poor girl was in trouble with them, and might
have had some difficulty in getting away, had I not chanced to
ride up."</p>

<p>"A slight service, you call it?  You are modest in your
estimate, Mr Gerald.  A man who should do that much for
<i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>"What would you do for <i>him</i>?" asked the mustanger,
placing a significant emphasis on the final word.</p>

<p>"I should <i>love</i> him," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>"Then," said Maurice, spurring his horse close up to the side
of the spotted mustang, and whispering into the ear of its rider,
with an earnestness strangely contrasting to his late reticence,
"I would give half my life to see you in the hands of Wild Cat
and his drunken comrades&mdash;the other half to deliver you from
the danger."</p>

<p>"Do you mean this, Maurice Gerald?  Do not trifle with me: I
am not a child.  Speak the truth!  Do you mean it?"</p>

<p>"I do!  As heaven is above me, I do!"</p>

<p>The sweetest kiss I ever had in my life, was when a
woman&mdash;a fair creature, in the hunting field&mdash;leant
over in her saddle and kissed me as I sate in mine.</p>

<p>The fondest embrace ever received by Maurice Gerald, was that
given by Louise Poindexter; when, standing up in her stirrup, and
laying her hand upon his shoulder, she cried in an agony of
earnest passion&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Do with me as thou wilt: I love you, I love you</i>!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.<br>

A PLEASURE FORBIDDEN.</h2>

<p class="first">
EVER since Texas became the scene of an Anglo-Saxon
immigration&mdash;I might go a century farther back and say, from
the time of its colonisation by the descendants of the
Conquistadores&mdash;the subject of primary importance has been
the disposition of its aborigines.</p>

<p>Whether these, the lawful lords of the soil, chanced to be in
a state of open war&mdash;or whether, by some treaty with the
settlers they were consenting to a temporary peace&mdash;made but
slight difference, so far as they were talked about.  In either
case they were a topic of daily discourse.  In the former it
related to the dangers to be hourly apprehended from them; in the
latter, to the probable duration of such treaty as might for the
moment be binding them to hold their tomahawks entombed.</p>

<p>In Mexican times these questions formed the staple of
conversation, at <i>desayuno, almuerzo, comida, y cena</i>; in
American times, up to this present hour, they have been the
themes of discussion at the breakfast, dinner, and supper tables.
In the planter's piazza, as in the hunter's camp, bear, deer,
cougar, and peccary, are not named with half the frequency, or
half the fear-inspiring emphasis, allotted to the word "Indian."
It is this that scares the Texan child instead of the stereotyped
nursery ghost, keeping it awake upon its moss-stuffed
mattress&mdash;disturbing almost as much the repose of its
parent.</p>

<p>Despite the surrounding of strong walls&mdash;more resembling
those of a fortress than a gentleman's dwelling&mdash;the inmates
of Casa del Corvo were not excepted from this feeling of
apprehension, universal along the frontier.  As yet they knew
little of the Indians, and that little only from report; but, day
by day, they were becoming better acquainted with the character
of this natural "terror" that interfered with the slumbers of
their fellow settlers.</p>

<p>That it was no mere "bogie" they had begun to believe; but if
any of them remained incredulous, a note received from the major
commanding the Fort&mdash;about two weeks after the horse-hunting
expedition&mdash;was calculated to cure them of their
incredulity.  It came in the early morning, carried by a mounted
rifleman.  It was put into the hands of the planter just as he
was about sitting down to the breakfast-table, around which were
assembled the three individuals who composed his
household&mdash;his daughter Louise, his son Henry, and his
nephew Cassius Calhoun.</p>

<p>"Startling news!" he exclaimed, after hastily reading, the
note.  "Not very pleasant if true; and I suppose there can be no
doubt of that, since the major appears convinced."</p>

<p>"Unpleasant news, papa?" asked his daughter, a spot of red
springing to her cheek as she put the question.</p>

<p>The spoken interrogatory was continued by others, not uttered
aloud.</p>

<p>"What can the major have written to him?  I met him yesterday
while riding in the chapparal.  He saw me in company
with&mdash;Can it be that? <i>Mon Dieu</i>! if father should hear
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'The Comanches on the war trail'&mdash;so writes the
major."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all!" said Louise, involuntarily giving voice to
the phrase, as if the news had nothing so very fearful in it.
"You frightened us, sir.  I thought it was something worse."</p>

<p>"Worse!  What trifling, child, to talk so!  There is nothing
worse, in Texas, than Comanches on the war trail&mdash;nothing
half so dangerous."</p>

<p>Louise might have thought there was&mdash;a danger at least as
difficult to be avoided.  Perhaps she was reflecting upon a
pursuit of wild steeds&mdash; or thinking of the <i>trail of a
lazo</i>.</p>

<p>She made no reply.  Calhoun continued the conversation.</p>

<p>"Is the major sure of the Indians being up?  What does he say,
uncle?"</p>

<p>"That there have been rumours of it for some days past, though
not reliable.  Now it is certain.  Last night Wild Cat, the
Seminole chief, came to the Fort with a party of his tribe;
bringing the news that the painted pole has been erected in the
camps of the Comanches all over Texas, and that the war dance has
been going on for more than a month. That several parties are
already out upon the maraud, and may be looked for among the
settlements at any moment."</p>

<p>"And Wild Cat himself&mdash;what of him?" asked Louise, an
unpleasant reminiscence suggesting the inquiry.  "Is that
renegade Indian to be trusted, who appears to be as much an enemy
to the whites as to the people of his own race?"</p>

<p>"Quite true, my daughter.  You have described the chief of the
Seminoles almost in the same terms as I find him spoken of, in a
postscript to the major's letter.  He counsels us to beware of
the two-faced old rascal, who will be sure to take sides with the
Comanches, whenever it may suit his convenience to do so."</p>

<p>"Well," continued the planter, laying aside the note, and
betaking himself to his coffee and waffles, "I trust we sha'n't
see any redskins here&mdash;either Seminoles or Comanches.  In
making their marauds, let us hope they will not like the look of
the crenelled parapets of Casa del Corvo, but give the hacienda a
wide berth."</p>

<p>Before any one could respond, a sable face appearing at the
door of the dining-room&mdash;which was the apartment in which
breakfast was being eaten&mdash;caused a complete change in the
character of the conversation.</p>

<p>The countenance belonged to Pluto, the coachman.</p>

<p>"What do you want, Pluto?" inquired his owner.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!  Massr Woodley, dis chile want nuffin 't all.  Only
look in t' tell Missa Looey dat soon's she done eat her brekfass
de spotty am unner de saddle, all ready for chuck de bit into him
mouf.  Ho! ho! dat critter do dance 'bout on de pave stone as ef
it wa' mad to 'treak it back to de smoove tuff ob de praira."</p>

<p>"Going out for a ride, Louise?" asked the planter with a
shadow upon his brow, which he made but little effort to
conceal.</p>

<p>"Yes, papa; I was thinking of it."</p>

<p>"You must not."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"I mean, that you must not ride out <i>alone</i>.  It is not
proper."</p>

<p>"Why do you think so, papa?  I have often ridden out
alone."</p>

<p>"Yes; perhaps too often."</p>

<p>This last remark brought the slightest tinge of colour to the
cheeks of the young Creole; though she seemed uncertain what
construction she was to put upon it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its ambiguity, she did not press for an
explanation.  On the contrary, she preferred shunning it; as was
shown by her reply.</p>

<p>"If you think so, papa, I shall not go out again.  Though to
be cooped up here, in this dismal dwelling, while you gentlemen
are all abroad upon business&mdash;is that the life you intend me
to lead in Texas?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort, my daughter.  I have no objection to
your riding out as much as you please; but Henry must be with
you, or your cousin Cassius.  I only lay an embargo on your going
alone.  I have my reasons."</p>

<p>"Reasons!  What are they?"</p>

<p>The question came involuntarily to her lips.  It had scarce
passed them, ere she regretted having asked it.  By her uneasy
air it was evident she had apprehensions as to the answer.</p>

<p>The reply appeared partially to relieve her.</p>

<p>"What other reasons do you want," said the planter, evidently
endeavouring to escape from the suspicion of duplicity by the
Statement of a convenient fact&mdash;"what better, than the
contents of this letter from the major?  Remember, my child, you
are not in Louisiana, where a lady may travel anywhere without
fear of either insult or outrage; but in Texas, where she may
dread both&mdash;where even her life may be in danger.  Here
there are Indians."</p>

<p>"My excursions don't extend so far from the house, that I need
have any fear of Indians.  I never go more than five miles at the
most."</p>

<p>"Five miles!" exclaimed the ex-officer of volunteers, with a
sardonic smile; "you would be as safe at fifty, cousin Loo.  You
are just as likely to encounter the redskins within a hundred
yards of the door, as at the distance of a hundred miles.  When
they are on the war trail they may be looked for anywhere, and at
any time.  In my opinion, uncle Woodley is rights you are very
foolish to ride out alone."</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>you</i> say so?" sharply retorted the young Creole,
turning disdainfully towards her cousin.  "And pray, sir, may I
ask of what service your company would be to me in the event of
my encountering the Comanches, which I don't believe there's the
slightest danger of my doing?  A pretty figure we'd cut&mdash;the
pair of us&mdash;in the midst of a war-party of painted savages!
Ha! ha!  The danger would be yours, not mine: since I should
certainly ride away, and leave you to your own devices.  Danger,
indeed, within five miles of the house!  If there's a horseman in
Texas&mdash;savages not excepted&mdash;who can catch up with my
little Luna in a five mile stretch, he must ride a swift steed;
which is more than you do, Mr Cash!"</p>

<p>"Silence, daughter!" commanded Poindexter.  "Don't let me hear
you talk in that absurd strain.  Take no notice of it, nephew.
Even if there were no danger from Indians, there are other
outlaws in these parts quite as much to be shunned as they.
Enough that I forbid you to ride abroad, as you have of late been
accustomed to do."</p>

<p>"Be it as you will, papa," rejoined Louise, rising from the
breakfast-table, and with an air of resignation preparing to
leave the room.  "Of course I shall obey you&mdash;at the risk of
losing my health for want of exercise.  Go, Pluto!" she added,
addressing herself to the darkey, who still stood grinning in the
doorway, "turn Luna loose into the corral&mdash;the
pastures&mdash;anywhere.  Let her stray back to her native
prairies, if the creature be so inclined; she's no longer needed
here."</p>

<p>With this speech, the young lady swept out of the <i>sala</i>,
leaving the three gentlemen, who still retained their seats by
the table, to reflect upon the satire intended to be conveyed by
her words.</p>

<p>They were not the last to which she gave utterance in that
same series. As she glided along the corridor leading to her own
chamber, others, low murmured, mechanically escaped from her
lips.  They were in the shape of interrogatories&mdash;a string
of them self-asked, and only to be answered by conjecture.</p>

<p>"What can papa have heard?  Is it but his suspicions?  Can any
one have told him?  Does he knew that we have met?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER TWENTY NINE.<br>

EL COYOTE AT HOME.</h2>

<p class="first">
CALHOUN took his departure from the breakfast-table, almost as
abruptly as his cousin; but, on leaving the <i>sala</i> instead
of returning to his own chamber, he sallied forth from the
house.</p>

<p>Still suffering from wounds but half healed, he was
nevertheless sufficiently convalescent to go abroad&mdash;into
the garden, to the stables, the corrals&mdash;anywhere around the
house.</p>

<p>On the present occasion, his excursion was intended to conduct
him to a more distant point.  As if under the stimulus of what
had turned up in the conversation&mdash;or perhaps by the
contents of the letter that had been read&mdash;his feebleness
seemed for the time to have forsaken him; and, vigorously plying
his crutch, he proceeded up the river in the direction of Fort
Inge.</p>

<p>In a barren tract of land, that lay about half way between the
hacienda and the Fort&mdash;and that did not appear to belong to
any one&mdash;he arrived at the terminus of his limping
expedition.  There was a grove of <i>mezquit</i>, with, some
larger trees shading it; and in the midst of this, a rude hovel
of "wattle and dab," known in South-Western Texas as a
<i>jacale</i>.</p>

<p>It was the domicile of Miguel Diaz, the Mexican
mustanger&mdash;a lair appropriate to the semi-savage who had
earned for himself the distinctive appellation of <i>El
Coyote</i> ("Prairie Wolf.")</p>

<p>It was not always that the wolf could be found in his
den&mdash;for his <i>jacale</i> deserved no better description.
It was but his occasional sleeping-place; during those intervals
of inactivity when, by the disposal of a drove of captured
mustangs, he could afford to stay for a time within the limits of
the settlement, indulging in such gross pleasures as its
proximity afforded.</p>

<p>Calhoun was fortunate in finding him at home; though not quite
so fortunate as to find him in a state of sobriety.  He was not
exactly intoxicated&mdash;having, after a prolonged spell of
sleep, partially recovered from this, the habitual condition of
his existence.</p>

<p>"<i>H'la nor</i>!" he exclaimed in his provincial patois,
slurring the salutation, as his visitor darkened the door of the
<i>jacale</i>.  "<i>P'r Dios</i>!  Who'd have expected to see
you?  <i>Sientese</i>!  Be seated.  Take a chair.  There's one. A
chair!  Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>The laugh was called up at contemplation of that which he had
facetiously termed a chair.  It was the skull of a mustang,
intended to serve as such; and which, with another similar piece,
a rude table of cleft yucca-tree, and a couch of cane reeds, upon
which the owner of the <i>jacale</i> was reclining, constituted
the sole furniture of Miguel Diaz's dwelling.</p>

<p>Calhoun, fatigued with his halting promenade, accepted the
invitation of his host, and sate down upon the horse-skull.</p>

<p>He did not permit much time to pass, before entering upon the
object of his errand.</p>

<p>"Señor Diaz!" said he, "I have come for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Señor Americano!" exclaimed the half-drunken horse-hunter,
cutting short the explanation, "why waste words upon that?
<i>Carrambo</i>!  I know well enough for what you've come.  You
want me to <i>wipe out</i> that devilish <i>Irlandes</i>!"</p>

<p>"Well!"</p>

<p>"Well; I promised you I would do it, for five hundred
<i>pesos</i>&mdash;at the proper time and opportunity.  I will.
Miguel Diaz never played false to his promise.  But the time's
not come, <i>nor capitan</i>; nor yet the opportunity,
<i>Carajo</i>!  To kill a man outright requires skill.  It can't
be done&mdash;even on the prairies&mdash;without danger of
detection; and if detected, ha! what chance for me?  You forget,
<i>nor capitan</i>, that I'm a Mexican.  If I were of your
people, I might slay Don Mauricio; and get clear on the score of
its being a quarrel.  <i>Maldita</i>!  With us Mexicans it is
different.  If we stick our machete into a man so as to let out
his life's blood, it is called murder; and you Americanos, with
your stupid juries of twelve <i>honest</i> men, would pronounce
it so: ay, and hang a poor fellow for it.  <i>Chingaro</i>!  I
can't risk that.  I hate the Irlandes as much as you; but I'm not
going to chop off my nose to spite my own face.  I must wait for
the time, and the chance&mdash;<i>carrai</i>, the time and the
chance."</p>

<p>"Both are come!" exclaimed the tempter, bending earnestly
towards the bravo.  "You said you could easily do it, if there
was any Indian trouble going on?"</p>

<p>"Of course I said so.  If there was that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have not heard the news, then?"</p>

<p>"What news?"</p>

<p>"That the Comanches are starting on the war trail."</p>

<p>"<i>Carajo</i>!" exclaimed El Coyote, springing up from his
couch of reeds, and exhibiting all the activity of his namesake,
when roused by the scent of prey.  "<i>Santissima Virgen</i>!  Do
you speak the truth, <i>nor capitan</i>?"</p>

<p>"Neither more nor less.  The news has just reached the Fort. I
have it on the best authority&mdash;the officer in command."</p>

<p>"In that case," answered the Mexican reflecting!&mdash;"in
that case, Don Mauricio may die.  The Comanches can kill him. Ha!
ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"You are sure of it?"</p>

<p>"I should be surer, if his scalp were worth a thousand
dollars, instead of five hundred."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> worth that sum."</p>

<p>"What sum?"</p>

<p>"A thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"You promise it?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Then the Comanches <i>shall</i> scalp him, <i>nor
capitan</i>.  You may return to Casa del Corvo, and go to sleep
with confidence that whenever the opportunity arrives, your enemy
will lose his hair.  You understand?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Get ready your thousand <i>pesos</i>."</p>

<p>"They wait your acceptance."</p>

<p>"<i>Carajo</i>!  I shall earn them in a trice.  Adios!
Adios!"</p>

<p>"<i>Santissima Virgen</i>!" exclaimed the profane ruffian, as
his visitor limped out of sight.  "What a magnificent fluke of
fortune!  A perfect <i>chiripe</i>.  A thousand dollars for
killing the man I intended to kill on my own account, without
charging anybody a single <i>claco</i> for the deed!</p>

<p>"The Comanches upon the war trail!  <i>Chingaro</i>! can it be
true?  If so, I must look up my old disguise&mdash;gone to
neglect through these three long years of accursed peace. <i>Viva
la guerra de los Indios</i>!  Success to the pantomime of the
prairies!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch30"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY.<br>

A SAGITTARY CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>

<p class="first">
LOUISE POINDEXTER, passionately addicted to the sports termed
"manly," could scarce have overlooked archery.</p>

<p>She had not.  The how, and its adjunct the arrow, were in her
hands as toys which she could control to her will.</p>

<p>She had been instructed in their <i>manege</i> by the Houma
Indians; a remnant of whom&mdash;the last descendants of a once
powerful tribe&mdash;may still be encountered upon the "coast" of
the Mississippi, in the proximity of Point Coupe and the
<i>bayou</i> Atchafalaya.</p>

<p>For a long time her bow had lain unbent&mdash;unpacked,
indeed, ever since it had formed part of the paraphernalia
brought overland in the waggon train.  Since her arrival at Casa
del Corvo she had found no occasion to use the weapon of Diana;
and her beautiful bow of Osage-orange wood, and quiver of plumed
arrows, had lain neglected in the lumber-room.</p>

<p>There came a time when they were taken forth, and honoured
with some attention.  It was shortly after that scene at the
breakfast table; when she had received the paternal command to
discontinue her equestrian excursions.</p>

<p>To this she had yielded implicit obedience, even beyond what
was intended: since not only had she given up riding out alone,
but declined to do so in company.</p>

<p>The spotted mustang stood listless in its stall, or pranced
frantically around the corral; wondering why its spine was no
longer crossed, or its ribs compressed, by that strange
caparison, that more than aught else reminded it of its
captivity.</p>

<p>It was not neglected, however.  Though no more mounted by its
fair mistress, it was the object of her daily&mdash;almost
hourly&mdash;solicitude. The best corn in the <i>granaderias</i>
of Casa del Corvo was selected, the most nutritions grass that
grows upon the lavanna&mdash;the <i>gramma</i>&mdash; furnished
for its manger; while for drink it had the cool crystal water
from the current of the Leona.</p>

<p>Pluto took delight in grooming it; and, under his currycomb
and brushes, its coat had attained a gloss which rivalled that
upon Pluto's own sable skin.</p>

<p>While not engaged attending upon her pet, Miss Poindexter
divided the residue of her time between indoor duties and
archery.  The latter she appeared to have selected as the
substitute for that pastime of which she was so passionately
fond, and in which she was now denied indulgence.</p>

<p>The scene of her sagittary performances was the garden, with
its adjacent shrubbery&mdash;an extensive enclosure, three sides
of which were fenced in by the river itself, curving round it
like the shoe of a racehorse, the fourth being a straight line
traced by the rearward wall of the hacienda.</p>

<p>Within this circumference a garden, with ornamental grounds,
had been laid out, in times long gone by&mdash;as might have been
told by many ancient exotics seen standing over it.  Even the
statues spoke of a past age&mdash; not only in their decay, but
in the personages they were intended to represent.  Equally did
they betray the chisel of the Spanish sculptor. Among them you
might see commemorated the figure and features of the great
Conde; of the Campeador; of Ferdinand and his energetic queen; of
the discoverer of the American world; of its two chief
<i>conquistadores</i>&mdash;Cortez and Pizarro; and of her, alike
famous for her beauty and devotion, the Mexican Malinche.</p>

<p>It was not amidst these sculptured stones that Louise
Poindexter practised her feats of archery; though more than once
might she have been seen standing before the statue of Malinche,
and scanning the voluptuous outline of the Indian maiden's form;
not with any severe thought of scorn, that this dark-skinned
daughter of Eve had succumbed to such a conqueror as Cortez.</p>

<p>The young creole felt, in her secret heart, that she had no
right to throw a stone at that statue.  To one less famed than
Cortez&mdash;though in her estimation equally deserving of
fame&mdash;she had surrendered what the great conquistador had
won from Marina&mdash;her heart of hearts.</p>

<p>In her excursions with the bow, which were of diurnal
occurrence, she strayed not among the statues.  Her game was not
there to be found; but under the shadow of tall trees that,
keeping the curve of the river, formed a semicircular grove
between it and the garden.  Most of these trees were of
indigenous growth&mdash;wild Chinas, mulberries, and
pecans&mdash; that in the laying out of the grounds had been
permitted to remain where Nature, perhaps some centuries ago, had
scattered their seed.</p>

<p>It was under the leafy canopy of these fair forest trees the
young Creole delighted to sit&mdash;or stray along the edge of
the pellucid river, that rolled dreamily by.</p>

<p>Here she was free to be alone; which of late appeared to be
her preference.  Her father, in his sternest mood, could not have
denied her so slight a privilege.  If there was danger upon the
outside prairie, there could be none within the
garden&mdash;enclosed, as it was, by a river broad and deep, and
a wall that could not have been scaled without the aid of a
thirty-round ladder.  So far from objecting to this solitary
strolling, the planter appeared something more than satisfied
that his daughter had taken to these tranquil habits; and the
suspicions which he had conceived&mdash;not altogether without a
cause&mdash;were becoming gradually dismissed from his mind.</p>

<p>After all he might have been misinformed?  The tongue of
scandal takes delight in torturing; and he may have been chosen
as one of its victims? Or, perhaps, it was but a casual
thing&mdash;the encounter of which he had been told, between his
daughter and Maurice the mustanger?  They may have met by
accident in the chapparal?  She could not well pass, without
speaking to, the man who had twice rescued her from a dread
danger. There might have been nothing in it, beyond the simple
acknowledgment of her gratitude?</p>

<p>It looked well that she had, with such willingness, consented
to relinquish her rides.  It was but little in keeping with her
usual custom, when crossed.  Obedience to that particular command
could not have been irksome; and argued innocence uncontaminated,
virtue still intact.</p>

<p>So reasoned the fond father; who, beyond conjecture, was not
permitted to scrutinise too closely the character of his child.
In other lands, or in a different class of society, he might
possibly have asked direct questions, and required direct answers
to them.  This is not the method upon the Mississippi; where a
son of ten years old&mdash;a daughter of less than
fifteen&mdash;would rebel against such scrutiny, and call it
inquisition.</p>

<p>Still less might Woodley Poindexter strain the statutes of
parental authority&mdash;the father of a Creole belle&mdash;for
years used to that proud homage whose incense often stills, or
altogether destroys, the simpler affections of the heart.</p>

<p>Though her father, and by law her controller, he knew to what
a short length his power might extend, if exerted in opposition
to her will.  He was, therefore, satisfied with her late act of
obedience&mdash;rejoiced to find that instead of continuing her
reckless rides upon the prairie, she now contented herself within
the range of the garden&mdash;with bow and arrow slaying the
small birds that were so unlucky as to come under her aim.</p>

<p>Father of fifty years old, why reason in this foolish fashion?
Have you forgotten your own youth&mdash;the thoughts that then
inspired you&mdash;the deceits you practised under such
inspiration&mdash;the counterfeits you assumed&mdash;the
"stories" you told to cloak what, after all, may have been the
noblest impulse of your nature?</p>

<p>The father of the fair Louise appeared to have become
oblivious to recollections of this kind: for his early life was
not without facts to have furnished them.  They must have been
forgotten, else he would have taken occasion to follow his
daughter into the garden, and observe her&mdash; himself
unobserved&mdash;while disporting herself in the shrubbery that
bordered the river bank.</p>

<p>By doing so, he would have discovered that her disposition was
not so cruel as may have been supposed.  Instead of transfixing
the innocent birds that fluttered in such foolish confidence
around her, her greatest feat in archery appeared to be the
impaling of a piece of paper upon the point of her arrow, and
sending the shaft thus charged across the river, to fall
harmlessly into a thicket on the opposite side.</p>

<p>He would have witnessed an exhibition still more singular.  He
would have seen the arrow thus spent&mdash;after a short
interval, as if dissatisfied with the place into which it had
been shot, and desirous of returning to the fair hand whence it
had taken its departure&mdash;come back into the garden with the
same, or a similar piece of paper, transfixed upon its shaft!</p>

<p>The thing might have appeared mysterious&mdash;even
supernatural&mdash;to an observer unacquainted with the spirit
and mechanism of that abnormal phenomenon.  There was no observer
of it save the two individuals who alternately bent the bow,
shooting with a single arrow; and by them it was understood.</p>

<p>"Love laughs at locksmiths."  The old adage is scarce suited
to Texas, where lock-making is an unknown trade.</p>

<p>"Where there's a will, there's a way," expresses pretty much
the same sentiment, appropriate to all time and every place.
Never was it more correctly illustrated than in that exchange of
bow-shots across the channel of the Leona.</p>

<p>Louise Poindexter had the will; Maurice Gerald had suggested
the way.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch31"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY ONE.<br>

A STREAM CLEVERLY CROSSED.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE sagittary correspondence could not last for long.  They
are but lukewarm lovers who can content themselves with a
dialogue carried on at bowshot distance.  Hearts brimful of
passion must beat and burn together&mdash;in close
proximity&mdash;each feeling the pulsation of the other. "If
there be an Elysium on earth, it is this!"</p>

<p>Maurice Gerald was not the man&mdash;nor Louise Poindexter the
woman&mdash;to shun such a consummation.</p>

<p>It came to pass: not under the tell-tale light of the sun, but
in the lone hour of midnight, when but the stars could have been
witnesses of their social dereliction.</p>

<p>Twice had they stood together in that garden grove&mdash;twice
had they exchanged love vows&mdash;under the steel-grey light of
the stars; and a third interview had been arranged between
them.</p>

<p>Little suspected the proud planter&mdash;perhaps prouder of
his daughter than anything else he possessed&mdash;that she was
daily engaged in an act of rebellion&mdash;the wildest against
which parental authority may pronounce itself.</p>

<p>His own daughter&mdash;his only daughter&mdash;of the best
blood of Southern aristocracy; beautiful, accomplished,
everything to secure him a splendid alliance&mdash;holding
nightly assignation with a horse-hunter!</p>

<p>Could he have but dreamt it when slumbering upon his soft
couch, the dream would have startled him from his sleep like the
call of the eternal trumpet!</p>

<p>He had no suspicion&mdash;not the slightest.  The thing was
too improbable&mdash; too monstrous, to have given cause for one.
Its very monstrosity would have disarmed him, had the thought
been suggested.</p>

<p>He had been pleased at his daughter's compliance with his late
injunctions; though he would have preferred her obeying them to
the letter, and riding out in company with her brother or
cousin&mdash;which she still declined to do.  This, however, he
did not insist upon.  He could well concede so much to her
caprice: since her staying at home could be no disadvantage to
the cause that had prompted him to the stern counsel.</p>

<p>Her ready obedience had almost influenced him to regret the
prohibition. Walking in confidence by day, and sleeping in
security by night, he fancied, it might be recalled.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">IT was one of those nights known only to a
southern sky, when the full round moon rolls clear across a
canopy of sapphire; when the mountains have no mist, and look as
though you could lay your hand upon them; when the wind is
hushed, and the broad leaves of the tropical trees droop
motionless from their boughs; themselves silent as if listening
to the concert of singular sounds carried on in their midst, and
in which mingle the voices of living creatures belonging to every
department of animated nature&mdash;beast, bird, reptile, and
insect.</p>

<p>Such a night was it, as you would select for a stroll in
company with the being&mdash;the one and only being&mdash;who, by
the mysterious dictation of Nature, has entwined herself around
your heart&mdash;a night upon which you feel a wayward longing to
have white arms entwined around your neck, and bright eyes before
your face, with that voluptuous gleaming that can only be felt to
perfection under the mystic light of the moon.</p>

<p>It was long after the infantry drum had beaten tattoo, and the
cavalry bugle sounded the signal for the garrison of Fort Inge to
go to bed&mdash;in fact it was much nearer the hour of
midnight&mdash;when a horseman rode away from the door of
Oberdoffer's hotel; and, taking the down-river road, was soon
lost to the sight of the latest loiterer who might have been
strolling through the streets of the village.</p>

<p>It is already known, that this road passed the hacienda of
Casa del Corvo, at some distance from the house, and on the
opposite side of the river.  It is also known that at the same
place it traversed a stretch of open prairie, with only a piece
of copsewood midway between two extensive tracts of
chapparal.</p>

<p>This clump of isolated timber, known in prairie parlance as a
"motte" or "island" of timber, stood by the side of the road,
along which the horseman had continued, after taking his
departure from the village.</p>

<p>On reaching the copse he dismounted; led his horse in among
the underwood; "hitched" him, by looping his bridle rein around
the topmost twigs of an elastic bough; then detaching a long rope
of twisted horsehair from the "horn" of his saddle, and inserting
his arm into its coil, he glided out to the edge of the "island,"
on that side that lay towards the hacienda.</p>

<p>Before forsaking the shadow of the copse, he cast a glance
towards the sky, and at the moon sailing supremely over it.  It
was a glance of inquiry, ending in a look of chagrin, with some
muttered phrases that rendered it more emphatic.</p>

<p>"No use waiting for that beauty to go to bed?  She's made up
her mind, she won't go home till morning&mdash;ha! ha!"</p>

<p>The droll conceit, which has so oft amused the nocturnal
inebriate of great cities, appeared to produce a like affect upon
the night patroller of the prairie; and for a moment the shadow,
late darkening his brow, disappeared.  It returned anon; as he
stood gazing across the open space that separated him from the
river bottom&mdash;beyond which lay the hacienda of Casa del
Corvo, clearly outlined upon the opposite bluff, "If there
<i>should</i> be any one stirring about the place?  It's not
likely at this hour; unless it be the owner of a bad conscience
who can't sleep. Troth! there's one such within those walls.  If
he be abroad there's a good chance of his seeing me on the open
ground; not that I should care a straw, if it were only myself to
be compromised.  By Saint Patrick, I see no alternative but risk
it!  It's no use waiting upon the moon, deuce take her!  She
don't go down for hours; and there's not the sign of a cloud.  It
won't do to keep <i>her</i> waiting.  No; I must chance it in the
clear light.  Here goes?"</p>

<p>Saying this, with a swift but stealthy step, the dismounted
horseman glided across the treeless tract, and soon readied the
escarpment of the cliff, that formed the second height of land
rising above the channel of the Leona.</p>

<p>He did not stay ten seconds in this conspicuous situation; but
by a path that zigzagged down the bluff&mdash;and with which he
appeared familiar&mdash;he descended to the river "bottom."</p>

<p>In an instant after he stood upon the bank; at the convexity
of the river's bend, and directly opposite the spot where a skiff
was moored, under the sombre shadow of a gigantic cotton-
tree.</p>

<p>For a short while he stood gazing across the stream, with a
glance that told of scrutiny.  He was scanning the shrubbery on
the other side; in the endeavour to make out, whether any one was
concealed beneath its shadow.</p>

<p>Becoming satisfied that no one was there, he raised the loop-
end of his lazo&mdash;for it was this he carried over his
arm&mdash;and giving it half a dozen whirls in the air, cast it
across the stream.</p>

<p>The noose settled over the cutwater of the skiff; and closing
around the stem, enabled him to tow the tiny craft to the side on
which he stood.</p>

<p>Stepping in, he took hold of a pair of oars that lay along the
planking at the bottom; and, placing them between the thole-pins,
pulled the boat back to its moorings.</p>

<p>Leaping out, he secured it as it had been before, against the
drift of the current; and then, taking stand under the shadow of
the cotton-tree, he appeared to await either a signal, or the
appearance of some one, expected by appointment.</p>

<p>His manoeuvres up to this moment, had they been observed,
might have rendered him amenable to the suspicion that he was a
housebreaker, about to "crack the crib" of Casa del Corvo.</p>

<p>The phrases that fell from his lips, however, could they have
been heard, would have absolved him of any such vile or vulgar
intention.  It is true he had designs upon the hacienda; but
these did not contemplate either its cash, plate, or
jewellery&mdash;if we except the most precious jewel it
contained&mdash;the mistress of the mansion herself.</p>

<p>It is scarce necessary to say, that the man who had hidden his
horse in the "motte," and so cleverly effected the crossing of
the stream, was Maurice the mustanger.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch32"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY TWO.<br>

LIGHT AND SHADE.</h2>

<p class="first">
HE had not long to chafe under the trysting-tree, if such it
were.  At the very moment when he was stepping into the skiff, a
casement window that looked to the rear of the hacienda commenced
turning upon its hinges, and was then for a time held slightly
ajar; as if some one inside was intending to issue forth, and
only hesitated in order to be assured that the "coast was
clear."</p>

<p>A small white hand&mdash;decorated with jewels that glistened
under the light of the moon&mdash;grasping the sash told that the
individual who had opened the window was of the gentler sex; the
tapering fingers, with their costly garniture, proclaimed her a
lady; while the majestic figure&mdash;soon after exhibited
outside, on the top of the stairway that led down to the
garden&mdash;could be no other than that of Louise
Poindexter.</p>

<p>It was she.</p>

<p>For a second or two the lady stood listening.  She heard, or
fancied she heard, the dip of an oar.  She might be mistaken; for
the stridulation of the cicadas filled the atmosphere with
confused sound.  No matter. The hour of assignation had arrived;
and she was not the one to stand upon punctilios as to
time&mdash;especially after spending two hours of solitary
expectation in her chamber, that had appeared like as many. With
noiseless tread descending the stone stairway, she glided sylph-
like among the statues and shrubs; until, arriving under the
shadow of the cotton-wood, she flung herself into arms eagerly
outstretched to receive her.</p>

<p>Who can describe the sweetness of such embrace&mdash;strange
to say, sweeter from being stolen?  Who can paint the delicious
emotions experienced at such a moment&mdash;too sacred to be
touched by the pen?</p>

<p>It is only after long throes of pleasure had passed, and the
lovers had begun to converse in the more sober language of life,
that it becomes proper, or even possible to report them.</p>

<p>Thus did they speak to each other, the lady taking the
initiative:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-morrow night you will meet me again&mdash;to-morrow night,
dearest Maurice?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,&mdash;if I were free
to say the word."</p>

<p>"And why not?  Why are you not free to say it?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, by break of day, I am off for the Alamo."</p>

<p>"Indeed!  Is it imperative you should go?"</p>

<p>The interrogatory was put in a tone that betrayed displeasure.
A vision of a sinister kind always came before the mind of Louise
Poindexter at mention of the lone hut on the Alamo.</p>

<p>And why?  It had afforded her hospitality.  One would suppose
that her visit to it could scarce fail to be one of the
pleasantest recollections of her life.  And yet it was not!</p>

<p>"I have excellent reasons for going," was the reply she
received.</p>

<p>"Excellent reasons!  Do you expect to meet any one there?"</p>

<p>"My follower Phelim&mdash;no one else.  I hope the poor fellow
is still above the grass.  I sent him out about ten days
ago&mdash;before there was any tidings of these Indian
troubles."</p>

<p>"Only Phelim you expect to meet?  Is it true, Gerald? Dearest!
do not deceive me!  Only him?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask the question, Louise?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you why.  I should die of shame to speak my
secret thoughts."</p>

<p>"Do not fear to speak them!  I could keep no secret from
you&mdash;in truth I could not.  So tell me what it is,
love!"</p>

<p>"Do you wish me, Maurice?"</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;of course I do.  I feel sure that whatever it may
be, I shall be able to explain it.  I know that my relations with
you are of a questionable character; or might be so deemed, if
the world knew of them.  It is for that very reason I am going
back to the Alamo."</p>

<p>"And to stay there?"</p>

<p>"Only for a single day, or two at most.  Only to gather up my
household gods, and bid a last adieu to my prairie life."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"You appear surprised."</p>

<p>"No! only mystified.  I cannot comprehend you.  Perhaps I
never shall!"</p>

<p>"'Tis very simple&mdash;the resolve I have taken.  I know you
will forgive me, when I make it known to you."</p>

<p>"Forgive you, Maurice!  For what do you ask forgiveness?"</p>

<p>"For keeping it a secret from you, that&mdash;that I am not
what I seem."</p>

<p>"God forbid you should be otherwise than what you seem to
me&mdash;noble, grand, beautiful, rare among men!  Oh, Maurice!
you know not how I esteem&mdash;how I love you!"</p>

<p>"Not more than I esteem and love you.  It is that very esteem
that now counsels me to a separation."</p>

<p>"A separation?"</p>

<p>"Yes, love; but it is to be hoped only for a short time."</p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>"While a steamer can cross the Atlantic, and return."</p>

<p>"An age!  And why this?"</p>

<p>"I am called to my native country&mdash;Ireland, so much
despised, as you already know.  'Tis only within the last twenty
hours I received the summons.  I obey it the more eagerly, that
it tells me I shall be able soon to return, and prove to your
proud father that the poor horse-hunter who won his daughter's
heart&mdash;have I won it, Louise?"</p>

<p>"Idle questioner!  Won it?  You know you have more than won
it&mdash; conquered it to a subjection from which it can never
escape.  Mock me not, Maurice, nor my stricken
heart&mdash;henceforth, and for evermore, your slave!"</p>

<p>During the rapturous embrace that followed this passionate
speech, by which a high-born and beautiful maiden confessed to
have surrendered herself&mdash;heart, soul, and body&mdash;to the
man who had made conquest of her affections, there was silence
perfect and profound.</p>

<p>The grasshopper amid the green herbage, the cicada on the
tree-leaf, the mock-bird on the top of the tall cotton-wood, and
the nightjar soaring still higher in the moonlit air, apparently
actuated by a simultaneous instinct, ceased to give utterance to
their peculiar cries: as though one and all, by their silence,
designed to do honour to the sacred ceremony transpiring in their
presence!</p>

<p>But that temporary cessation of sounds was due to a different
cause.  A footstep grating upon the gravelled walk of the
garden&mdash;and yet touching it so lightly, that only an acute
ear could have perceived the contact&mdash; was the real cause
why the nocturnal voices had suddenly become stilled.</p>

<p>The lovers, absorbed in the sweet interchange of a mutual
affection, heard it not.  They saw not that dark shadow, in the
shape of man or devil, flitting among the flowers; now standing
by a statue; now cowering under cover of the shrubbery, until at
length it became stationary behind the trunk of a tree, scarce
ten paces from the spot where they were kissing each other!</p>

<p>Little did they suspect, in that moment of celestial happiness
when all nature was hushed around them, that the silence was
exposing their passionate speeches, and the treacherous moon, at
the same time, betraying their excited actions.</p>

<p>That shadowy listener, crouching guilty-like behind the tree,
was a witness to both.  Within easy earshot, he could hear every
word&mdash;even the sighs and soft low murmurings of their love;
while under the silvery light of the moon, with scarce a sprig
coming between, he could detect their slightest gestures.</p>

<p>It is scarce necessary to give the name of the dastardly
eavesdropper. That of Cassius Calhoun will have suggested
itself.</p>

A TORTURING DISCOVERY.</h2>

<p class="first">
HOW came the cousin of Louise Poindexter to be astir at that
late hour of the night, or, as it was now, the earliest of the
morning?  Had he been forewarned of this interview of the lovers;
or was it merely some instinctive suspicion that had caused him
to forsake his sleeping-chamber, and make a tour of inspection
within the precincts of the garden?</p>

<p>In other words, was he an eavesdropper by accident, or a spy
acting upon information previously communicated to him?</p>

<p>The former was the fact.  Chance alone, or chance aided by a
clear night, had given him the clue to a discovery that now
filled his soul with the fires of hell.</p>

<p>Standing upon the housetop at the hour of midnight&mdash;what
had taken him up there cannot be guessed&mdash;breathing vile
tobacco-smoke into an atmosphere before perfumed with the scent
of the night-blooming <i>cereus</i>; the ex-captain of cavalry
did not appear distressed by any particular anxiety.  He had
recovered from the injuries received in his encounter with the
mustanger; and although that bit of evil fortune did not fail to
excite within him the blackest chagrin, whenever it came up
before his mind, its bitterness had been, to some extent,
counteracted by hopes of revenge&mdash;towards a plan for which
he had already made some progress.</p>

<p>Equally with her father, he had been gratified that Louise was
contented of late to stay within doors: for it was himself who
had secretly suggested the prohibition to her going abroad.
Equally had he remained ignorant as to the motive of that garden
archery, and in a similar manner had misconceived it.  In fact,
he had begun to flatter himself, that, after all, her
indifference to himself might be only a feint on the part of his
cousin, or an illusion upon his.  She had been less cynical for
some days; and this had produced upon him the pleasant
impression, that he might have been mistaken in his jealous
fears.</p>

<p>He had as yet discovered no positive proof that she
entertained a partiality for the young Irishman; and as the days
passed without any renewed cause for disquiet, he began to
believe that in reality there was none.</p>

<p>Under the soothing influence of this restored confidence, had
he mounted up to the azotea; and, although it was the hour of
midnight, the careless <i>insouciance</i> with which he applied
the light to his cigar, and afterwards stood smoking it, showed
that he could not have come there for any very important purpose.
It may have been to exchange the sultry atmosphere of his
sleeping-room for the fresher air outside; or he may have been
tempted forth by the magnificent moon&mdash;though he was not
much given to such romantic contemplation.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, he had lighted his cigar, and was apparently
enjoying it, with his arms crossed upon the coping of the
parapet, and his face turned towards the river.</p>

<p>It did not disturb his tranquillity to see a horseman ride out
from the chapparal on the opposite side, and proceed onward
across the open plain.</p>

<p>He knew of the road that was there.  Some traveller, he
supposed, who preferred taking advantage of the cool hours of the
night&mdash;a night, too, that would have tempted the weariest
wayfarer to continue his journey. It might be a planter who lived
below, returning home from the village, after lounging an hour
too long in the tavern saloon.</p>

<p>In daytime, the individual might have been identified; by the
moonlight, it could only be made out that there was a man on
horseback.</p>

<p>The eyes of the ex-officer accompanied him as he trotted along
the road; but simply with mechanical movement, as one musingly
contemplates some common waif drifting down the current of a
river.</p>

<p>It was only after the horseman had arrived opposite the island
of timber, and was seen to pull up, and then ride into it, that
the spectator upon the housetop became stirred to take an
interest in his movements.</p>

<p>"What the devil can that mean?" muttered Calhoun to himself,
as he hastily plucked the cigar stump from between his teeth.
"Damn the man, he's dismounted!" continued he, as the stranger
re-appeared, on foot, by the inner edge of the copse.</p>

<p>"And coming this way&mdash;towards the bend of the
river&mdash;straight as he can streak it!</p>

<p>"Down the bluff&mdash;into the bottom&mdash;and with a stride
that shows him well acquainted with the way.  Surely to God he
don't intend making his way across into the garden?  He'd have to
swim for that; and anything he could get there would scarce pay
him for his pains.  What the old Scratch can be his intention?  A
thief?"</p>

<p>This was Calhoun's first idea&mdash;rejected almost as soon as
conceived.  It is true that in Spanish-American countries even
the beggar goes on horseback.  Much more might the thief?</p>

<p>For all this, it was scarce probable, that a man would make a
midnight expedition to steal fruit, or vegetables, in such
cavalier style.</p>

<p>What else could he be after?</p>

<p>The odd manoeuvre of leaving his horse under cover of the
copse, and coming forward on foot, and apparently with caution,
as far as could be seen in the uncertain light, was of itself
evidence that the man's errand could scarce be honest and that he
was approaching the premises of Casa del Corvo with some evil
design.</p>

<p>What could it be?</p>

<p>Since leaving the upper plain he had been no longer visible to
Calhoun upon the housetop.  The underwood skirting the stream on
the opposite side, and into which he had entered, was concealing
him.</p>

<p>"What can the man be after?"</p>

<p>After putting this interrogatory to himself, and for about the
tenth time&mdash;each with increasing emphasis&mdash;the
composure of the ex-captain was still further disturbed by a
sound that reached his ear, exceedingly like a plunge in the
river.  It was slight, but clearly the concussion of some hard
substance brought in contact with water.</p>

<p>"The stroke of an oar," muttered he, on hearing it.  "Is, by
the holy Jehovah!  He's got hold of the skiff, and's crossing
over to the garden. What on earth can he be after?"</p>

<p>The questioner did not intend staying on the housetop to
determine.  His thought was to slip silently
downstairs&mdash;rouse the male members of the family, along with
some of the servants; and attempt to capture the intruder by a
clever ambuscade.</p>

<p>He had raised his arm from the copestone, and was in the act
of stepping back from the parapet, when his ear was saluted by
another sound, that caused him again to lean forward and look
into the garden below.</p>

<p>This new noise bore no resemblance to the stroke of an oar;
nor did it proceed from the direction of the river.  It was the
creaking of a door as it turned upon its hinge, or, what is much
the same, a casement window; while it came from
below&mdash;almost directly underneath the spot where the
listener stood.</p>

<p>On craning over to ascertain the cause, he saw, what blanched
his cheeks to the whiteness of the moonlight that shone upon
them&mdash;what sent the blood curdling through every corner of
his heart.</p>

<p>The casement that had been opened was that which belonged to
the bed-chamber of his cousin Louise.  He knew it.  The lady
herself was standing outside upon the steps that led to the level
of the garden, her face turned downward, as if she was meditating
a descent.</p>

<p>Loosely attired in white, as though in the neglige of a
<i>robe de chambre</i>, with only a small kerchief coifed over
her crown, she resembled some fair nymph of the night, some
daughter of the moon, whom Luna delighted to surround with a
silvery effulgence!</p>

<p>Calhoun reasoned rapidly.  He could not do otherwise than
connect her appearance outside the casement with the advent of
the man who was making his way across the river.</p>

<p>And who could this man be?  Who but Maurice the mustanger?</p>

<p>A clandestine meeting!  And by appointment!</p>

<p>There could be no doubt of it; and if there had, it would have
been dissolved, at seeing the white-robed figure glide
noiselessly down the stone steps, and along the gravelled walks,
till it at length disappeared among the trees that shadowed the
mooring-place of the skiff.</p>

<p>Like one paralysed with a powerful stroke, the ex-captain
continued for some time upon the azotea&mdash;speechless and
without motion.  It was only after the white drapery had
disappeared, and he heard the low murmur of voices rising from
among the trees, that he was stimulated to resolve upon some
course of proceeding.</p>

<p>He thought no longer of awaking the inmates of the
house&mdash;at least not then.  Better first to be himself the
sole witness of his cousin's disgrace; and then&mdash;and
then&mdash;</p>

<p>In short, he was not in a state of mind to form any definite
plan; and, acting solely under the blind stimulus of a fell
instinct, he hurried down the <i>escalera</i>, and made his way
through the house, and out into the garden.</p>

<p>He felt feeble as he pressed forward.  His legs had tottered
under him while descending the stone steps.  They did the same as
he glided along the gravelled walk.  They continued to tremble as
he crouched behind the tree trunk that hindered him from being
seen&mdash;while playing spectator of a scene that afflicted him
to the utmost depths of his soul.</p>

<p>He heard their vows; their mutual confessions of love; the
determination of the mustanger to be gone by the break of the
morrow's day; as also his promise to return, and the revelation
to which that promise led.</p>

<p>With bitter chagrin, he heard how this determination was
combated by Louise, and the reasons why she at length appeared to
consent to it.</p>

<p>He was witness to that final and rapturous embrace, that
caused him to strike his foot nervously against the pebbles, and
make that noise that had scared the cicadas into silence.</p>

<p>Why at that moment did he not spring forward&mdash;put a
termination to the intolerable <i>tête-à-tête</i>&mdash;and with
a blow of his bowie-knife lay his rival low&mdash;at his own feet
and that of his mistress?  Why had he not done this at the
beginning&mdash;for to him there needed no further evidence, than
the interview itself, to prove that his cousin had been
dishonoured?</p>

<p>There was a time when he would not have been so patient. What,
then, was the <i>punctilio</i> that restrained him?  Was it the
presence of that piece of perfect mechanism, that, with a sheen
of steel, glistened upon the person of his rival, and which under
the bright moonbeams, could be distinguished as a "Colt's six-
shooter?"</p>

<p>Perhaps it may have been.  At all events, despite the terrible
temptation to which his soul was submitted, something not only
hindered him from taking an immediate vengeance, but in the mid-
moments of that maddening spectacle&mdash;the final
embrace&mdash;prompted him to turn away from the spot, and with
an earnestness, even keener than he had yet exhibited, hurry back
in the direction of the house: leaving the lovers, still
unconscious of having been observed, to bring their sweet
interview to an ending&mdash;sure to be procrastinated.</p>

<h2><a id="ch34"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.<br>

A CHIVALROUS DICTATION.</h2>

<p class="first">
WHERE went Cassius Calhoun?</p>

<p>Certainly not to his own sleeping-room.  There was no sleep
for a spirit suffering like his.</p>

<p>He went not there; but to the chamber of his cousin.  Not
hers&mdash;now untenanted, with its couch unoccupied, its
coverlet undisturbed&mdash;but to that of her brother, young
Henry Poindexter.</p>

<p>He went direct as crooked corridors would permit him&mdash;in
haste, without waiting to avail himself of the assistance of a
candle.</p>

<p>It was not needed.  The moonbeams penetrating through the open
bars of the <i>reja</i>, filled the chamber with
light&mdash;sufficient for his purpose. They disclosed the
outlines of the apartment, with its simple furniture&mdash;a
washstand, a dressing-table, a couple of chairs, and a bed with
"mosquito curtains."</p>

<p>Under those last was the youth reclining; in that sweet silent
slumber experienced only by the innocent.  His finely formed head
rested calmly upon the pillow, over which lay scattered a
profusion of shining curls.</p>

<p>As Calhoun lifted the muslin "bar," the moonbeams fell upon
his face, displaying its outlines of the manliest aristocratic
type.</p>

<p>What a contrast between those two sets of features, brought
into such close proximity!  Both physically handsome; but
morally, as Hyperion to the Satyr.</p>

<p>"Awake, Harry! awake!" was the abrupt salutation extended to
the sleeper, accompanied by a violent shaking of his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh! ah! you, cousin Cash?  What is it? not the Indiana, I
hope?"</p>

<p>"Worse than that&mdash;worse! worse!  Quick!  Rouse yourself,
and see! Quick, or it will be too late!  Quick, and be the
witness of your own disgrace&mdash;the dishonour of your house.
Quick, or the name of Poindexter will be the laughing-stock of
Texas!"</p>

<p>After such summons there could be no inclination for
sleep&mdash;at least on the part of a Poindexter; and at a single
bound, the youngest representative of the family cleared the
mosquito curtains, and stood upon his feet in the middle of the
floor&mdash;in an attitude of speechless astonishment.</p>

<p>"Don't wait to dress," cried his excited counsellor, "stay,
you may put on your pants.  Damn the clothes!  There's no time
for standing upon trifles.  Quick!  Quick!"</p>

<p>The simple costume the young planter was accustomed to wear,
consisting of trousers and Creole blouse of Attakapas
<i>cottonade</i>, were adjusted to his person in less than twenty
seconds of time; and in twenty more, obedient to the command of
his cousin&mdash;without understanding why he had been so
unceremoniously summoned forth&mdash;he was hurrying along the
gravelled walks of the garden.</p>

<p>"What is it, Cash?" he inquired, as soon as the latter showed
signs of coming to a stop.  "What does it all mean?"</p>

<p>"See for yourself!  Stand close to me!  Look through yonder
opening in the trees that leads down to the place where your
skiff is kept.  Do you see anything there?"</p>

<p>"Something white.  It looks like a woman's dress.  It is that.
It's a woman!"</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a woman.  Who do you suppose she is?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell.  Who do you say she is?"</p>

<p>"There's another figure&mdash;a dark one&mdash;by her
side."</p>

<p>"It appears to be a man?  It is a man!"</p>

<p>"And who do you suppose <i>he</i> is?"</p>

<p>"How should I know, cousin Cash?  Do you?"</p>

<p>"I do.  That man is Maurice the mustanger!"</p>

<p>"And the woman?"</p>

<p>"<i>Is Louise&mdash;your sister&mdash;in his arms</i>!"</p>

<p>As if a shot had struck him through the heart, the brother
bounded upward, and then onward, along the path.</p>

<p>"Stay!" said Calhoun, catching hold of, and restraining him.
"You forget that you are unarmed!  The fellow, I know, has
weapons upon him. Take this, and this," continued he, passing his
own knife and pistol into the hands of his cousin.  "I should
have used them myself, long ere this; but I thought it better
that you&mdash;her brother&mdash;should be the avenger of your
sister's wrongs.  On, my boy!  See that you don't hurt
<i>her</i>; but take care not to lose the chance at him.  Don't
give him a word of warning.  As soon as they are separated, send
a bullet into his belly; and if all six should fail, go at him
with the knife.  I'll stay near, and take care of you, if you
should get into danger.  Now!  Steal upon him, and give the
scoundrel hell!"</p>

<p>It needed not this blasphemous injunction to inspire Henry
Poindexter to hasty action.  The brother of a sister&mdash;a
beautiful sister&mdash;erring, undone!</p>

<p>In six seconds he was by her side, confronting her supposed
seducer.</p>

<p>"Low villain!" he cried, "unclasp your loathsome arm from the
waist of my sister.  Louise! stand aside, and give me a chance of
killing him! Aside, sister!  Aside, I say!"</p>

<p>Had the command been obeyed, it is probable that Maurice
Gerald would at that moment have ceased to exist&mdash;unless he
had found heart to kill Henry Poindexter; which, experienced as
he was in the use of his six-shooter, and prompt in its
manipulation, he might have done.</p>

<p>Instead of drawing the pistol from its holster, or taking any
steps for defence, he appeared only desirous of disengaging
himself from the fair arms still clinging around him, and for
whose owner he alone felt alarm.</p>

<p>For Henry to fire at the supposed betrayer, was to risk taking
his sister's life; and, restrained by the fear of this, he paused
before pulling trigger.</p>

<p>That pause produced a crisis favourable to the safety of all
three.  The Creole girl, with a quick perception of the
circumstances, suddenly released her lover from the protecting
embrace; and, almost in the same instant, threw her arms around
those of her brother.  She knew there was nothing to be
apprehended from the pistol of Maurice.  Henry alone had to be
held doing mischief.</p>

<p>"Go, go!" she shouted to the former, while struggling to
restrain the infuriated youth.  "My brother is deceived by
appearances.  Leave me to explain.  Away, Maurice! away!"</p>

<p>"Henry Poindexter," said the young Irishman, as he turned to
obey the friendly command, "I am not the sort of villain you have
been pleased to pronounce me.  Give me but time, and I shall
prove, that your sister has formed a truer estimate of my
character than either her father, brother, or cousin.  I claim
but six months.  If at the end of that time I do not show myself
worthy of her confidence&mdash;her love&mdash;then shall I make
you welcome to shoot me at sight, as you would the cowardly
coyote, that chanced to cross your track.  Till then, I bid you
adieu."</p>

<p>Henry's struggle to escape from his sister's
arms&mdash;perhaps stronger than his own&mdash;grew less
energetic as he listened to these words.  They became feebler and
feebler&mdash;at length ceasing&mdash;when a plunge in the river
announced that the midnight intruder into the enclosed grounds of
Casa del Corvo was on his way back to the wild prairies he had
chosen for his home.</p>

<p>It was the first time he had recrossed the river in that
primitive fashion.  On the two previous occasions he had passed
over in the skiff; which had been drawn back to its moorings by a
delicate hand, the tow-rope consisting of that tiny lazo that had
formed part of the caparison presented along with the spotted
mustang.</p>

<p>"Brother! you are wronging him! indeed you are wronging him!"
were the words of expostulation that followed close upon his
departure.  "Oh, Henry&mdash;dearest Hal, if you but knew how
noble he is!  So far from desiring to do me an injury, 'tis only
this moment he has been disclosing a plan
to&mdash;to&mdash;prevent&mdash;scandal&mdash;I mean to make me
happy. Believe me, brother, he is a gentleman; and if he were
not&mdash;if only the common man you take him for&mdash;I could
not help what I have done&mdash;I could not, for <i>I love
him</i>!"</p>

<p>"Louise! tell me the truth!  Speak to me, not as to your
brother, but as to your own self.  From what I have this night
seen, more than from your own words, I know that you love this
man.  Has he taken advantage of your&mdash;your&mdash;unfortunate
passion?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no.  As I live he has not.  He is too noble
for that&mdash;even had I&mdash;Henry! he is innocent!  If there
be cause for regret, I alone am to blame.  Why&mdash;oh! brother!
why did you insult him?"</p>

<p>"Have I done so?"</p>

<p>"You have, Henry&mdash;rudely, grossly."</p>

<p>"I shall go after, and apologise.  If you speak truly, sister,
I owe him that much.  I shall go this instant.  I liked him from
the first&mdash;you know I did?  I could not believe him capable
of a cowardly act.  I can't now.  Sister! come back into the
house with me.  And now, dearest Loo! you had better go to bed.
As for me, I shall be off <i>instanter</i> to the hotel, where I
may still hope to overtake him.  I cannot rest till I have made
reparation for my rudeness."</p>

<p>So spoke the forgiving brother; and gently leading his sister
by the hand, with thoughts of compassion, but not the slightest
trace of anger, he hastily returned to the
hacienda&mdash;intending to go after the young Irishman, and
apologise for the use of words that, under the circumstances,
might have been deemed excusable.</p>

<p>As the two disappeared within the doorway, a third figure,
hitherto crouching among the shrubbery, was seen to rise erect,
and follow them up the stone steps.  This last was their cousin,
Cassius Calhoun.</p>

<p>He, too, had thoughts of <i>going after</i> the mustanger.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch35"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE.<br>

AN UNCOURTEOUS HOST.</h2>

<p class="first">
"THE chicken-hearted fool!  Fool myself, to have trusted to
such a hope! I might have known she'd cajole the young calf, and
let the scoundrel escape.  I could have shot him from behind the
tree&mdash;dead as a drowned rat!  And without risking
anything&mdash;even disgrace!  Not a particle of risk.  Uncle
Woodley would have thanked me&mdash;the whole settlement would
have said I had done right.  My cousin, a young lady, betrayed by
a common scamp&mdash;a horse, trader&mdash;who would have said a
word against it? Such a chance!  Why have I missed it?  Death and
the devil&mdash;it may not trump up again!"</p>

<p>Such were the reflections of the ex-captain of cavalry, while
at some paces distance following his two cousins on their return
to the hacienda.</p>

<p>"I wonder," muttered he, on re-entering the <i>patio</i>,
"whether the blubbering baby be in earnest?  Going after to
apologise to the man who has made a fool of his sister!
Ha&mdash;ha!  It would be a good joke were it not too serious to
be laughed at.  He <i>is</i> in earnest, else why that row in the
stable?  'Tis he bringing but his horse!  It is, by the
Almighty!"</p>

<p>The door of the stable, as is customary in Mexican haciendas
opened upon the paved <i>patio</i>.</p>

<p>It was standing ajar; but just as Calhoun turned his eye upon
it, a man coming from the inside pushed it wide open; and then
stepped over the threshold, with a saddled horse following close
after him.</p>

<p>The man had a Panama hat upon his head, and a cloak thrown
loosely around his shoulders.  This did not hinder Calhoun from
recognising his cousin Henry, as also the dark brown horse that
belonged to him.</p>

<p>"Fool!  So&mdash;you've let him off?" spitefully muttered the
ex-captain, as the other came within whispering distance.  "Give
me back my bowie and pistol.  They're not toys suited to such
delicate fingers as yours! Bah!  Why did you not use them as I
told you?  You've made a mess of it!"</p>

<p>"I have," tranquilly responded the young planter.  "I know it.
I've insulted&mdash;and grossly too&mdash;a noble fellow."</p>

<p>"Insulted a noble fellow!  Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!  You're
mad&mdash;by heavens, you're mad!"</p>

<p>"I should have been had I followed your counsel, cousin Cash.
Fortunately I did not go so far.  I have done enough to deserve
being called worse than fool; though perhaps, under the
circumstances, I may obtain forgiveness for my fault.  At all
events, I intend to try for it, and without losing time."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"After Maurice the mustanger&mdash;to apologise to him for my
misconduct."</p>

<p>"Misconduct!  Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!  Surely you are
joking?"</p>

<p>"No.  I'm in earnest.  If you come along with me, you shall
see!"</p>

<p>"Then I say again you are mad!  Not only mad, but a damned
natural-born idiot! you are, by Jesus Christ and General
Jackson!"</p>

<p>"You're not very polite, cousin Cash; though, after the
language I've been lately using myself, I might excuse you.
Perhaps you will, one day imitate me, and make amends for your
rudeness."</p>

<p>Without adding another word, the young gentleman&mdash;one of
the somewhat rare types of Southern chivalry&mdash;sprang to his
saddle; gave the word, to his horse; and rode hurriedly through
the <i>saguan</i>.</p>

<p>Calhoun stood upon the stones, till the footfall of the horse
became but faintly distinguishable in the distance.</p>

<p>Then, as if acting under some sudden impulse, he hurried along
the verandah to his own room; entered it; reappeared in a rough
overcoat; crossed back to the stable; went in; came out again
with his own horse saddled and bridled; led the animal along the
pavement, as gently as if he was stealing him; and once outside
upon the turf, sprang upon his back, and rode rapidly away.</p>

<p>For a mile or more he followed the same road, that had been
taken by Henry Poindexter.  It could not have been with any idea
of overtaking the latter: since, long before, the hoofstrokes of
Henry's horse had ceased to be heard; and proceeding at a slower
pace, Calhoun did not ride as if he cared about catching up with
his cousin.</p>

<p>He had taken the up-river road.  When about midway between
Casa del Corvo and the Fort, he reined up; and, after
scrutinising the chapparal around him, struck off by a bridle-
path leading back toward the bank of the river.  As he turned
into it he might have been heard muttering to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"A chance still left; a good one, though not so cheap as the
other.  It will cost me a thousand dollars.  What of that, so
long as I get rid of this Irish curse, who has poisoned every
hour of my existence!  If true to his promise, he takes the route
to his home by an early hour in the morning.  What time, I
wonder.  These men of the prairies call it late rising, if they
be abed till daybreak!  Never mind.  There's yet time for the
Coyote to get before him on the road!  I know that.  It must be
the same as we followed to the wild horse prairies.  He spoke of
his hut upon the Alamo.  That's the name of the creek where we
had our pic-nic. The hovel cannot be far from there!  The Mexican
must know the place, or the trail leading to it; which last will
be sufficient for his purpose and mine.  A fig for the shanty
itself!  The owner may never reach it. There may be Indians upon
the road!  There <i>must</i> be, before daybreak in the
morning!"</p>

<p>As Calhoun concluded this string of strange reflections, he
had arrived at the door of another "shanty"&mdash;that of the
Mexican mustanger.  The <i>jacale</i> was the goal of his
journey.</p>

<p>Having slipped out of his saddle, and knotted his bridle to a
branch, he set foot upon the threshold.</p>

<p>The door was standing wide open.  From the inside proceeded a
sound, easily identified as the snore of a slumberer.</p>

<p>It was not as of one who sleeps either tranquilly, or
continuously.  At short intervals it was interrupted&mdash;now by
silent pauses&mdash;anon by hog-like gruntings, interspersed with
profane words, not perfectly pronounced, but slurred from a thick
tongue, over which, but a short while before, must have passed a
stupendous quantity of alcohol.</p>

<p>"<i>Carrambo! carrai! carajo&mdash;chingara! mil diablos</i>!"
mingled with more&mdash; perhaps less&mdash;reverential
exclamations of "<i>Sangre de Cristo!  Jesus! Santissima Virgen!
Santa Maria!  Dios!  Madre de Dios</i>!" and the like, were
uttered inside the <i>jacale</i>, as if the speaker was engaged
in an apostrophic conversation with all the principal characters
of the Popish Pantheon.</p>

<p>Calhoun paused upon the threshold, and listened.</p>

<p>"<i>Mal&mdash;dit&mdash;dit&mdash;o</i>!" muttered the
sleeper, concluding the exclamation with a hiccup.
"<i>Buen&mdash;buenos nove-dad-es</i>!  Good news, <i>por sangre
Chrees&mdash;Chreest&mdash;o!  Si S'nor Merican&mdash;cano!
Nove&mdash;dad&mdash;es s'perbos! Los Indyos
Co&mdash;co&mdash;manchees</i> on the war-trail&mdash;<i>el
rastro de guerra</i>. God bless the
Co&mdash;co&mdash;manchees!"</p>

<p>"The brute's drunk!" said his visitor, mechanically speaking
aloud.</p>

<p>"<i>H'la S'nor</i>!" exclaimed the owner of the <i>jacale</i>,
aroused to a state of semi-consciousness by the sound of a human
voice.  "<i>Quien llama</i>! Who has the honour&mdash;that is,
have I the happiness&mdash;I, Miguel Diaz&mdash;el
Co&mdash;coyote, as the <i>leperos</i> call me.  Ha, ha!
coyo&mdash;coyot.  Bah! what's in a name?  Yours, S'nor?  <i>Mil
demonios</i>! who are you?"</p>

<p>Partially raising himself from his reed couch, the inebriate
remained for a short time in a sitting attitude&mdash;glaring,
half interrogatively, half unconsciously, at the individual whose
voice had intruded itself into his drunken dreams.</p>

<p>The unsteady examination lasted only for a score of seconds.
Then the owner of the <i>jacale</i>, with an unintelligible
speech, subsided into a recumbent position; when a savage grunt,
succeeded by a prolonged snore, proved him to have become
oblivious to the fact that his domicile contained a guest.</p>

<p>"Another chance lost!" said the latter, hissing the words
through his teeth, as he turned disappointedly from the door.</p>

<p>"A sober fool and a drunken knave&mdash;two precious tools
wherewith, to accomplish a purpose like mine!  Curse the luck!
All this night it's been against me!  It maybe three long hours
before this pig sleeps off the swill that has stupefied him.
Three long hours, and then what would be the use of him?  'Twould
be too late&mdash;too late!"</p>

<p>As he said this, he caught the rein of his bridle, and stood
by the head of his horse, as if uncertain what course to
pursue.</p>

<p>"No use my staying here!  It might be daybreak before the
damned liquor gets out of his skull.  I may as well go back to
the hacienda and wait there; or else&mdash;or else&mdash;"</p>

<p>The alternative, that at this crisis presented itself, was
nor, spoken aloud.  Whatever it may have been, it had the effect
of terminating the hesitancy that living over him, and stirring
him to immediate action.</p>

<p>Roughly tearing his rein from the branch, and passing it over
his horse's head, he sprang into the saddle, and rode off from
the <i>jacale</i> in a direction the very opposite to that in
which he had approached it.</p>

<h2><a id="ch36"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY SIX.<br>

THREE TRAVELLERS ON THE SAME TRACK.</h2>

<p class="first">
NO one can deny, that a ride upon a smooth-turfed prairie is
one of the most positive pleasures of sublunary existence.  No
one <i>will</i> deny it, who has had the good fortune to
experience the delightful sensation. With a spirited horse
between your thighs, a well-stocked valise strapped to the cantle
of your saddle, a flask of French brandy slung handy over the
"horn," and a plethoric cigar-case protruding from under the flap
of your pistol holster, you may set forth upon a day's journey,
without much fear of feeling weary by the way.</p>

<p>A friend riding by your side&mdash;like yourself alive to the
beauties of nature, and sensitive to its sublimities&mdash;will
make the ride, though long, and otherwise arduous, a pleasure to
be remembered for many, many years.</p>

<p>If that friend chance to be some fair creature, upon whom you
have fixed your affections, then will you experience a delight to
remain in your memory for ever.</p>

<p>Ah! if all prairie-travellers were to be favoured with such
companionship, the wilderness of Western Texas would soon become
crowded with tourists; the great plains would cease to be
"pathless,"&mdash;the savannas would swarm with snobs.</p>

<p>It is better as it is.  As it is, you may launch yourself upon
the prairie: and once beyond the precincts of the settlement from
which you have started&mdash;unless you keep to the customary
"road," indicated only by the hoof-prints of half a dozen
horsemen who have preceded you&mdash;you may ride on for hours,
days, weeks, months, perhaps a whole year, without encountering
aught that bears the slightest resemblance to yourself, or the
image in which you have been made.</p>

<p>Only those who have traversed the great plain of Texas can
form a true estimate of its illimitable vastness; impressing the
mind with sensations similar to those we feel in the
contemplation of infinity.</p>

<p>In some sense may the mariner comprehend my meaning.  Just as
a ship may cross the Atlantic Ocean&mdash;and in tracks most
frequented by sailing craft&mdash;without sighting a single sail,
so upon the prairies of South-western Texas, the traveller may
journey on for months, amid a solitude that seems eternal!</p>

<p>Even the ocean itself does not give such an impression of
endless space. Moving in its midst you perceive no
change&mdash;no sign to tell you you are progressing.  The broad
circular surface of azure blue, with the concave hemisphere of a
tint but a few shades lighter, are always around and above you,
seeming ever the same.  You think they <i>are</i> so; and fancy
yourself at rest in the centre of a sphere and a circle.  You are
thus to some extent hindered from having a clear conception of
"magnificent distances."</p>

<p>On the prairie it is different.  The "landmarks"&mdash;there
are such, in the shape of "mottes," mounds, trees, ridges, and
rocks&mdash;constantly changing before your view, admonish you
that you are passing through space; and this very knowledge
imbues you with the idea of vastness.</p>

<p>It is rare for the prairie traveller to contemplate such
scenes alone&mdash; rarer still upon the plains of South-western
Texas.  In twos at least&mdash; but oftener in companies of ten
or a score&mdash;go they, whose need it is to tempt the perils of
that wilderness claimed by the Comanches as ancestral soil.</p>

<p>For all this, a solitary traveller may at times be
encountered: for on the same night that witnessed the tender and
stormy scenes in the garden of Casa del Corvo, no less than three
such made the crossing of the plain that stretches south-westward
from the banks of the Leona River.</p>

<p>Just at the time that Calhoun was making his discontented
departure from the <i>jacale</i> of the Mexican mustanger, the
foremost of these nocturnal travellers was clearing the outskirts
of the village&mdash;going in a direction which, if followed far
enough, would conduct him to the Nueces River, or one of its
tributary streams.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say, that he was on horseback.  In
Texas there are no pedestrians, beyond the precincts of the town
or plantation.</p>

<p>The traveller in question bestrode a strong steed; whose
tread, at once vigorous and elastic, proclaimed it capable of
carrying its rider through a long journey, without danger of
breaking down.</p>

<p>Whether such a journey was intended, could not have been told
by the bearing of the traveller himself.  He was equipped, as any
Texan cavalier might have been, for a ten-mile ride&mdash;perhaps
to his own house. The lateness of the hour forbade the
supposition, that he could be going from it.  The serape on his
shoulders&mdash;somewhat carelessly hanging&mdash;might have been
only put on to protect them against the dews of the night.</p>

<p>But as there was no dew on that particular night&mdash;nor any
outlying settlement in the direction he was heading to&mdash;the
horseman was more like to have been a real traveller&mdash;<i>en
route</i> for some distant point upon the prairies.</p>

<p>For all this he did not appear to be in haste; or uneasy as to
the hour at which he might reach his destination.</p>

<p>On the contrary, he seemed absorbed in some thought, that
linked itself with the past; sufficiently engrossing to render
him unobservant of outward objects, and negligent in the
management of his horse.</p>

<p>The latter, with the rein lying loosely upon his neck, was
left to take his own way; though instead of stopping, or
straying, he kept steadily on, as if over ground oft trodden
before.</p>

<p>Thus leaving the animal to its own guidance, and pressing it
neither with whip nor spur, the traveller rode tranquilly over
the prairie, till lost to view&mdash;not by the intervention of
any object, but solely through the dimness of the light, where
the moon became misty in the far distance.</p>

<p>Almost on the instant of his disappearance&mdash;and as if the
latter had been taken for a cue&mdash;a second horseman spurred
out from the suburbs of the village; and proceeded along the same
path.</p>

<p>From the fact of his being habited in a fashion to defend him
against the chill air of the night, he too might have been taken
for a traveller.</p>

<p>A cloak clasped across his breast hung over his shoulders, its
ample skirts draping backward to the hips of his horse.</p>

<p>Unlike the horseman who had preceded him, he showed signs of
haste&mdash; plying both whip and spur as he pressed on.</p>

<p>He appeared intent on overtaking some one.  It might be the
individual whose form had just faded out of sight?</p>

<p>This was all the more probable from the style of his
equitation&mdash;at short intervals bending forward in his
saddle, and scanning the horizon before him, as if expecting to
see some form outlined above the line of the sky.</p>

<p>Continuing to advance in this peculiar fashion, he also
disappeared from view&mdash;exactly at the same point, where his
precursor had ceased to be visible&mdash;to any one whose gaze
might have been following him from the Fort or village.</p>

<p>An odd contingency&mdash;if such it were&mdash;that just at
that very instant a third horseman rode forth from the outskirts
of the little Texan town, and, like the other two, continued
advancing in a direct line across the prairie.</p>

<p>He, also, was costumed as if for a journey.  A "blanket-coat"
of scarlet colour shrouded most of his person from
sight&mdash;its ample skirts spread over his thighs, half
concealing a short jager rifle, strapped aslant along the flap of
his saddle.</p>

<p>Like the foremost of the three, he exhibited no signs of a
desire to move rapidly along the road.  He was proceeding at a
slow pace&mdash;even for a traveller.  For all that, his manner
betokened a state of mind far from tranquil; and in this respect
he might be likened to the horseman who had more immediately
preceded him.</p>

<p>But there was an essential difference between the actions of
the two men.  Whereas the cloaked cavalier appeared desirous of
overtaking some one in advance, he in the red blanket coat seemed
altogether to occupy himself in reconnoitring towards his
rear.</p>

<p>At intervals he would slue himself round in the
stirrups&mdash;sometimes half turn his horse&mdash;and scan the
track over which he had passed; all the while listening, as
though he expected to hear some one who should be coming after
him.</p>

<p>Still keeping up this singular surveillance, he likewise in
due time reached the point of disappearance, without having
overtaken any one, or been himself overtaken.</p>

<p>Though at nearly equal distances apart while making the
passage of the prairie, not one of the three horsemen was within
sight of either of the others.  The second, half-way between the
other two, was beyond reach of the vision of either, as they were
beyond his.</p>

<p>At the same glance no eye could have taken in all three, or
any two of them; unless it had been that of the great Texan owl
perched upon the summit of some high eminence, or the "whip-poor-
will" soaring still higher in pursuit of the moon-loving
moth.</p>

<p>An hour later, and at a point of the prairie ten miles farther
from Fort Inge, the relative positions of the three travellers
had undergone a considerable change.</p>

<p>The foremost was just entering into a sort of alley or gap in
the chapparal forest; which here extended right and left across
the plain, far as the eye could trace it.  The alley might have
been likened to a strait in the sea: its smooth turfed surface
contrasting with the darker foliage of the bordering thickets; as
water with dry land.  It was illumined throughout a part of its
length&mdash;a half mile or so&mdash;the moon showing at its
opposite extremity.  Beyond this the dark tree line closed it in,
where it angled round into sombre shadow.</p>

<p>Before entering the alley the foremost of the trio of
travellers, and for the first time, exhibited signs of
hesitation.  He reined up; and for a second or two sate in his
saddle regarding the ground before him. His attention was
altogether directed to the opening through the trees in his
front.  He made no attempt at reconnoitring his rear.</p>

<p>His scrutiny, from whatever cause, was of short
continuance.</p>

<p>Seemingly satisfied, he muttered an injunction to his horse,
and rode onward into the gap.</p>

<p>Though he saw not him, he was seen by the cavalier in the
cloak, following upon the same track, and now scarce half a mile
behind.</p>

<p>The latter, on beholding him, gave utterance to a slight
exclamation.</p>

<p>It was joyful, nevertheless; as if he was gratified by the
prospect of at length overtaking the individual whom he had been
for ten miles so earnestly pursuing.</p>

<p>Spurring his horse to a still more rapid pace, he also entered
the opening; but only in time to get a glimpse of the other, just
passing under the shadow of the trees, at the point where the
avenue angled.</p>

<p>Without hesitation, he rode after; soon disappearing at the
same place, and in a similar manner.</p>

<p>It was a longer interval before the third and hindmost of the
horsemen approached the pass that led through the chapparal.</p>

<p>He did approach it, however; but instead of riding into it, as
the others had done, he turned off at an angle towards the edge
of the timber; and, after leaving his horse among the trees,
crossed a corner of the thicket, and came out into the opening on
foot.</p>

<p>Keeping along it&mdash;to all appearance still more solicitous
about something that might be in his rear than anything that was
in front of him&mdash;he at length arrived at the shadowy
turning; where, like the two others, he abruptly disappeared in
the darkness.</p>

<p>An hour elapsed, during which the nocturnal voices of the
chapparal&mdash; that had been twice temporarily silenced by the
hoofstroke of a horse, and once by the footsteps of a
man&mdash;had kept up their choral cries by a thousand
stereotyped repetitions.</p>

<p>Then there came a further interruption; more abrupt in its
commencement, and of longer continuance.  It was caused by a
sound, very different from that made by the passage of either
horseman or pedestrian over the prairie turf.</p>

<p>It was the report of a gun, quick, sharp, and clear&mdash;the
"spang" that denotes the discharge of a rifle.</p>

<p>As to the authoritative wave of the conductor's baton the
orchestra yields instant obedience, so did the prairie minstrels
simultaneously take their cue from that abrupt detonation, that
inspired one and all of them with a peculiar awe.</p>

<p>The tiger cat miaulling in the midst of the chapparal, the
coyote howling along its skirts; even the jaguar who need not
fear any forest foe that might approach him, acknowledged his
dread of that quick, sharp explosion&mdash;to him
unexplainable&mdash;by instantly discontinuing his cries.</p>

<p>As no other sound succeeded the shot&mdash;neither the groan
of a wounded man, nor the scream of a stricken animal&mdash;the
jaguar soon recovered confidence, and once more essayed to
frighten the denizens of the thicket with his hoarse
growling.</p>

<p>Friends and enemies&mdash;birds, beasts, insects, and
reptiles&mdash;disregarding his voice in the distance, reassumed
the thread of their choral strain; until the chapparal was
restored to its normal noisy condition, when two individuals
standing close together, can only hold converse by speaking in
the highest pitch of their voices!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch37"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN.<br>

A MAN MISSING.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE breakfast bell of Casa del Corvo had sounded its second
and last summons&mdash;preceded by a still earlier signal from a
horn, intended to call in the stragglers from remote parts of the
plantation.</p>

<p>The "field hands" labouring near had collected around the
"quarter;" and in groups, squatted upon the grass, or seated upon
stray logs, were discussing their diet&mdash;by no means
spare&mdash;of "hog and hominy" corn-bread and "corn-coffee,"
with a jocosity that proclaimed a keen relish of these, their
ordinary comestibles.</p>

<p>The planter's family assembled in the <i>sala</i> were about
to begin breakfast, when it was discovered that one of its
members was missing.</p>

<p>Henry was the absent one.</p>

<p>At first there was but little notice taken of the
circumstance.  Only the conjecture: that he would shortly make
his appearance.</p>

<p>As several minutes passed without his coming in, the planter
quietly observed that it was rather strange of Henry to be behind
time, and wonder where he could be.</p>

<p>The breakfast of the South-western American is usually a well
appointed meal.  It is eaten at a fixed hour, and <i>table-
d'hote</i> fashion&mdash;all the members of the family meeting at
the table.</p>

<p>This habit is exacted by a sort of necessity, arising out of
the nature of some of the viands peculiar to the country; many of
which, as "Virginia biscuit," "buckwheat cakes," and "waffles,"
are only relished coming fresh from, the fire: so that the hour
when breakfast is being eaten in the dining-room, is that in
which the cook is broiling her skin in the kitchen.</p>

<p>As the laggard, or late riser, may have to put up with cold
biscuit, and no waffles or buckwheat cakes, there are few such on
a Southern plantation.</p>

<p>Considering this custom, it <i>was</i> somewhat strange, that
Henry Poindexter had not yet put in an appearance.</p>

<p>"Where can the boy be?" asked his father, for the fourth time,
in that tone of mild conjecture that scarce calls for reply.</p>

<p>None was made by either of the other two guests at the table.
Louise only gave expression to a similar conjecture.  For all
that, there was a strangeness in her glance&mdash;as in the tone
of her voice&mdash;that might have been observed by one closely
scrutinising her features.</p>

<p>It could scarce be caused by the absence of her brother from
the breakfast-table?  The circumstance was too trifling to call
up an emotion; and clearly at that moment was she subject to
one.</p>

<p>What was it?  No one put the inquiry.  Her father did not
notice anything odd in her look.  Much less Calhoun, who was
himself markedly labouring to conceal some disagreeable thought
under the guise of an assumed <i>naivete</i>.</p>

<p>Ever since entering the room he had maintained a studied
silence; keeping his eyes averted, instead of, according to his
usual custom, constantly straying towards his cousin.</p>

<p>He sate nervously in his chair; and once or twice might have
been seen to start, as a servant entered the room.</p>

<p>Beyond doubt he was under the influence of some extraordinary
agitation.</p>

<p>"Very strange Henry not being here to his breakfast!" remarked
the planter, for about the tenth time.  "Surely he is not abed
till this hour?  No&mdash;no&mdash;he never lies so late.  And
yet if abroad, he couldn't be at such a distance as not to have
heard the horn.  He <i>may</i> be in his room?  It is just
possible.  Pluto!"</p>

<p>"Ho&mdash;ho! d'ye call me, Mass' Woodley?  I'se hya."  The
sable coachee, acting as table waiter, was in the <i>sala</i>,
hovering around the chairs.</p>

<p>"Go to Henry's sleeping-room.  If he's there, tell him we're
at breakfast&mdash;half through with it."</p>

<p>"He no dar, Mass' Woodley."</p>

<p>"You have been to his room?"</p>

<p>"Ho&mdash;ho!  Yas.  Dat am I'se no been to de room itseff;
but I'se been to de 'table, to look atter Massa Henry hoss; an
gib um him fodder an corn. Ho&mdash;ho!  Dat same ole hoss he
ain't dar; nor han't a been all ob dis mornin'.  I war up by de
fuss skreek ob day.  No hoss dar, no saddle, no bridle; and ob
coass no Massa Henry.  Ho&mdash;ho!  He been an gone out 'fore
anb'dy wor 'tirrin' 'bout de place."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" asked the planter, seriously stirred by the
intelligence.</p>

<p>"Satin, shoo, Mass' Woodley.  Dar's no hoss doins in dat ere
'table, ceppin de sorrel ob Massa Cahoon.  Spotty am in de
'closure outside. Massa Henry hoss ain't nowha."</p>

<p>"It don't follow that Master Henry himself is not in his room.
Go instantly, and see!"</p>

<p>"Ho&mdash;ho!  I'se go on de instum, massr; but f'r all dat
dis chile no speck find de young genl'um dar.  Ho! ho! wha'ebber
de ole hoss am, darr Massr Henry am too."</p>

<p>"There's something strange in all this," pursued the planter,
as Pluto shuffled out of the sala.  "Henry from home; and at
night too.  Where can he have gone?  I can't think of any one he
would be visiting at such unseasonable hours!  He must have been
out all night, or very early, according to the nigger's account!
At the Port, I suppose, with those young fellows.  Not at the
tavern, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!  He wouldn't go there," interposed Calhoun, who
appeared as much mystified by the absence of Henry as was
Poindexter himself.  He refrained, however, from suggesting any
explanation, or saying aught of the scenes to which he had been
witness on the preceding night.</p>

<p>"It is to be hoped <i>he</i> knows nothing of it," reflected
the young Creole.  "If not, it may still remain a secret between
brother and myself.  I think I can manage Henry.  But why is he
still absent?  I've sate up all night waiting for him.  He must
have overtaken Maurice, and they have fraternised.  I hope so;
even though the tavern may have been the scene of their
reconciliation.  Henry is not much given to dissipation; but
after such a burst of passion, followed by his sudden repentance,
he may have strayed from his usual habits?  Who could blame him
if he has?  There can be little harm in it: since he has gone
astray in good company?"</p>

<p>How far the string of reflections might have extended it is
not easy to say: since it did not reach its natural ending.</p>

<p>It was interrupted by the reappearance of Pluto; whose
important air, as he re-entered the room, proclaimed him the
bearer of eventful tidings.</p>

<p>"Well!" cried his master, without waiting for him to speak,
"is he there?"</p>

<p>"No, Mass' Woodley," replied the black, in a voice that
betrayed a large measure of emotion, "he are not dar&mdash;Massa
Henry am not.  But&mdash;but," he hesitatingly continued, "dis
chile grieb to say dat&mdash;dat&mdash;<i>him hoss am
dar</i>."</p>

<p>"His horse there!  Not in his sleeping-room, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, massa; nor in de 'table neider; but out da, by de big
gate."</p>

<p>"His horse at the gate?  And why, pray, do you grieve about
that?"</p>

<p>"'Ecause, Mass' Woodley, 'ecause de hoss&mdash;dat am Massa
Henry hoss&mdash;'ecause de anymal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Speak out, you stammering nigger!  What because?  I suppose
the horse has his head upon him?  Or is it his tail that is
missing?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Mass' Woodley, dis nigga fear dat am missin' wuss dan
eider him head or him tail.  I'se feer'd dat de ole hoss hab loss
him rider!"</p>

<p>"What!  Henry thrown from his horse?  Nonsense, Pluto!  My son
is too good a rider for that.  Impossible that <i>he</i> should
have been pitched out of the saddle&mdash;impossible!"</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!  I doan say he war frown out ob de saddle. Gorramity!
I fear de trouble wuss dan dat.  O! dear ole Massa, I tell you no
mo'.  Come to de gate ob do hashashanty, and see fo youseff."</p>

<p>By this time the impression conveyed by Pluto's
speech&mdash;much more by his manner&mdash;notwithstanding its
ambiguity, had become sufficiently alarming; and not only the
planter himself, but his daughter and nephew, hastily forsaking
their seats, and preceded by the sable coachman, made their way
to the outside gate of the hacienda.</p>

<p>A sight was there awaiting them, calculated to inspire all
three with the most terrible apprehensions.</p>

<p>A negro man&mdash;one of the field slaves of the
plantation&mdash;stood holding a horse, that was saddled and
bridled.  The animal wet with the dews of the night, and having
been evidently uncared for in any stable, was snorting and
stamping the ground, as if but lately escaped from some scene of
excitement, in which he had been compelled to take part.</p>

<p>He was speckled with a colour darker than that of the
dewdrops&mdash;darker than his own coat of bay-brown.  The spots
scattered over his shoulders&mdash;the streaks that ran parallel
with the downward direction of his limbs, the blotches showing
conspicuously on the saddle-flaps, were all of the colour of
coagulated blood.  Blood had caused them&mdash;spots, streaks,
and blotches!</p>

<p>Whence came that horse?</p>

<p>From the prairies.  The negro had caught him, on the outside
plain, as, with the bridle trailing among his feet, he was
instinctively straying towards the hacienda.</p>

<p>To whom did he belong?</p>

<p>The question was not asked.  All present knew him to be the
horse of Henry Poindexter.</p>

<p>Nor did any one ask whose blood bedaubed the saddle-flaps. The
three individuals most interested could think only of that one,
who stood to them in the triple relationship of son, brother, and
cousin.</p>

<p>The dark red spots on which they were distractedly gazing had
spurted from the veins of Henry Poindexter.  They had no other
thought.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch38"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT.<br>

THE AVENGERS.</h2>

<p class="first">
HASTILY&mdash;perhaps too truly&mdash;construing the sinister
evidence, the half-frantic father leaped into the bloody saddle,
and galloped direct for the Fort.</p>

<p>Calhoun, upon his own horse, followed close after.</p>

<p>The hue and cry soon spread abroad.  Rapid riders carried it
up and down the river, to the remotest plantations of the
settlement.</p>

<p>The Indians were out, and near at hand, reaping their harvest
of scalps! That of young Poindexter was the firstfruits of their
sanguinary gleaning!</p>

<p>Henry Poindexter&mdash;the noble generous youth who had not an
enemy in all Texas!  Who but Indians could have spilled such
innocent blood?  Only the Comanches could have been so cruel?</p>

<p>Among the horsemen, who came quickly together on the parade
ground of Port Inge, no one doubted that the Comanches had done
the deed.  It was simply a question of how, when, and where.</p>

<p>The blood drops pretty clearly, proclaimed the first.  He who
had shed them must have been shot, or speared, while sitting in
his saddle.  They were mostly on the off side; where they
presented an appearance, as if something had been slaked over
them.  This was seen both on the shoulders of the horse, and the
flap of the saddle.  Of course it was the body of the rider as it
slipped lifeless to the earth.</p>

<p>There were some who spoke with equal certainty as to the
time&mdash;old frontiersmen experienced in such matters.</p>

<p>According to them the blood was scarce "ten hours old:" in
other words, must have been shed about ten hours before.</p>

<p>It was now noon.  The murder must have been committed at
<i>two</i> o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>The third query was, perhaps, the most important&mdash;at
least now that the deed was done.</p>

<p><i>Where</i> had it been done?  Where was the body to be
found?</p>

<p>After that, where should the assassins be sought for?</p>

<p>These were the questions discussed by the mixed council of
settlers and soldiers, hastily assembled at Port Inge, and
presided over by the commandant of the Fort&mdash;the afflicted
father standing speechless by his side.</p>

<p>The last was of special importance.  There are thirty-two
points in the compass of the prairies, as well as in that which
guides the ocean wanderer; and, therefore, in any expedition
going in search of a war-party of Comanches, there would be
thirty-two chances to one against its taking the right track.</p>

<p>It mattered not that the home of these nomadic savages was in
the west. That was a wide word; and signified anywhere within a
semicircle of some hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>Besides, the Indians were now upon the <i>war-trail</i>; and,
in an isolated settlement such as that of the Leona, as likely to
make their appearance from the east.  More likely, indeed, since
such is a common strategic trick of these astute warriors.</p>

<p>To have ridden forth at random would have been sheer folly;
with such odds against going the right way, as thirty-two to
one.</p>

<p>A proposal to separate the command into several parties, and
proceed in different directions, met with little favour from any
one.  It was directly negatived by the major himself.</p>

<p>The murderers might be a thousand, the avengers were but the
tenth of that number: consisting of some fifty dragoons who
chanced to be in garrison, with about as many mounted civilians.
The party must be kept together, or run the risk of being
attacked, and perhaps cut off, in detail!</p>

<p>The argument was deemed conclusive.  Even, the bereaved
father&mdash;and cousin, who appeared equally the victim of a
voiceless grief&mdash;consented to shape their course according
to the counsels of the more prudent majority, backed by the
authority of the major himself.</p>

<p>It was decided that the searchers should proceed in a
body.</p>

<p>In what direction?  This still remained the subject of
discussion.</p>

<p>The thoughtful captain of infantry now became a conspicuous
figure, by suggesting that some inquiry should be made, as to
what direction had been last taken by the man who was supposed to
be murdered.  Who last saw Henry Poindexter?</p>

<p>His father and cousin were first appealed to.</p>

<p>The former had last seen his son at the supper table; and
supposed him to have gone thence to his bed.</p>

<p>The answer of Calhoun was less direct, and, perhaps, less
satisfactory. He had conversed with his cousin at a later hour,
and had bidden him good night, under the impression that he was
retiring to his room.</p>

<p>Why was Calhoun concealing what had really occurred?  Why did
he refrain from giving a narration of that garden scene to which
he had been witness?</p>

<p>Was it, that he feared humiliation by disclosing the part he
had himself played?</p>

<p>Whatever was the reason, the truth was shunned; and an answer
given, the sincerity of which was suspected by more than one who
listened to it.</p>

<p>The evasiveness might have been more apparent, had there been
any reason for suspicion, or had the bystanders been allowed
longer time to reflect upon it.</p>

<p>While the inquiry was going on, light came in from a quartet
hitherto unthought of.  The landlord of the Rough and Ready, who
had come uncalled to the council, after forcing his way through
the crowd, proclaimed himself willing to communicate some facts
worth their hearing&mdash;in short, the very facts they were
endeavouring to find out: when Henry Poindexter had been last
seen, and what the direction he had taken.</p>

<p>Oberdoffer's testimony, delivered in a semi-Teutonic tongue,
was to the effect: that Maurice the mustanger&mdash;who had been
staying at his hotel ever since his fight with Captain
Calhoun&mdash;had that night ridden out at a late hour, as he had
done for several nights before.</p>

<p>He had returned to the hotel at a still later hour; and
finding it open&mdash;on account of a party of <i>bons
vivants</i> who had supped there&mdash;had done that which he had
not done for a long time before&mdash;demanded his bill, and to
Old Duffer's astonishment&mdash;as the latter naively
confessed&mdash;settled every cent of it!</p>

<p>Where he had procured the money "Gott" only knew, or why he
left the hotel in such a hurry.  Oberdoffer himself only knew
that he had left it, and taken all his 'trapsh' along with
him&mdash;just as he was in the habit of doing, whenever he went
off upon one of his horse-catching expeditions.</p>

<p>On one of these the village Boniface supposed him to have
gone.</p>

<p>What had all this to do with the question before the council?
Much indeed; though it did not appear till the last moment of his
examination, when the witness revealed the more pertinent
facts:&mdash;that about twenty minutes after the mustanger had
taken his departure from the hotel, "Heinrich Poindexter" knocked
at the door, and inquired after Mr Maurice Gerald;&mdash;that on
being told the latter was gone, as also the time, and probable
direction he had taken, the "young gentlemans" rode off a a quick
pace, as if with the intention of overtaking him.</p>

<p>This was all Mr Oberdoffer knew of the matter; and all he
could be expected to tell.</p>

<p>The intelligence, though containing several points but ill
understood, was nevertheless a guide to the expeditionary party.
It furnished a sort of clue to the direction they ought to take.
If the missing man had gone off with Maurice the mustanger, or
after him, he should be looked for on the road the latter himself
would be likely to have taken.</p>

<p>Did any one know where the horse-hunter had his home?</p>

<p>No one could state the exact locality; though there were
several who believed it was somewhere among the head-waters of
the Nueces, on a creek called the "Alamo."</p>

<p>To the Alamo, then, did they determine upon proceeding in
quest of the missing man, or his dead body&mdash;perhaps, also,
to find that of Maurice the mustanger; and, at the same time,
avenge upon the savage assassins two murders instead of one.</p>

<h2><a id="ch39"></a>CHAPTER THIRTY NINE.<br>

THE POOL OF BLOOD.</h2>

<p class="first">
NOTWITHSTANDING its number&mdash;larger than usual for a party
of borderers merely in search of a strayed neighbour&mdash;the
expedition pursued its way with, considerable caution.</p>

<p>There was reason.  The Indians were upon the war-trail. Scouts
were sent out in advance; and professed "trackers" employed to
pick up, and interpret the "sign."</p>

<p>On the prairie, extending nearly ten miles to the westward of
the Leona, no trail was discovered.  The turf, hard and dry, only
showed the tracks of a horse when going in a gallop.  None such
were seen along the route.</p>

<p>At ten miles' distance from the Fort the plain is traversed by
a tract of chapparal, running north-west and south-east.  It is a
true Texan jungle, laced by llianas, and almost impenetrable for
man and horse.</p>

<p>Through this jungle, directly opposite the Fort, there is an
opening, through which passes a path&mdash;the shortest that
leads to the head waters of the Nueces.  It is a sort of natural
avenue among the trees that stand closely crowded on each side,
but refrain from meeting.  It may be artificial: some old "war-
trail" of the Comanches, erst trodden by their expeditionary
parties on the maraud to Tamaulipas, Coahuila, or New Leon.</p>

<p>The trackers knew that it conducted to the Alamo; and,
therefore, guided the expedition into it.</p>

<p>Shortly after entering among the trees, one of the latter, who
had gone afoot in the advance, was seen standing by the edge of
the thicket, as if waiting to announce some recently discovered
fact.</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded the major, spurring ahead of the
others, and riding up to the tracker.  "Sign?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that there is, major; and plenty of it.  Look there!  In
that bit of sottish ground you see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The tracks of a horse."</p>

<p>"Of two horses, major," said the man, correcting the officer
with an air of deference.</p>

<p>"True.  There are two."</p>

<p>"Farther on they become four; though they're all made by the
same two horses.  They have gone up this openin' a bit, and come
back again."</p>

<p>"Well, Spangler, my good fellow; what do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"Not much," replied Spangler, who was one of the paid scouts
of the cantonment; "not much of <i>that</i>; I hav'n't been far
enough up the openin' to make out what it means&mdash;only far
enough to know that <i>a man has been murdered</i>."</p>

<p>"What proof have you of what you say?  Is there a dead
body?"</p>

<p>"No.  Not as much as the little finger; not even a hair of the
head, so fur as I can see."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Blood, a regular pool of it&mdash;enough to have cleared out
the carcass of a hull buffalo.  Come and see for yourself.  But,"
continued the scout in a muttered undertone, "if you wish me to
follow up the sign as it ought to be done, you'll order the
others to stay back&mdash;'specially them as are now nearest
you."</p>

<p>This observation appeared to be more particularly pointed at
the planter and his nephew; as the tracker, on making it, glanced
furtively towards both.</p>

<p>"By all means," replied the major.  "Yes, Spangler, you shall
have every facility for your work.  Gentlemen! may I request you
to remain where you are for a few minutes.  My tracker, here, has
to go through a performance that requires him to have the ground
to himself.  He can only take me along with him."</p>

<p>Of course the major's request was a command, courteously
conveyed, to men who were not exactly his subordinates.  It was
obeyed, however, just as if they had been; and one and all kept
their places, while the officer, following his scout, rode away
from the ground.</p>

<p>About fifty yards further on, Spangler came to a stand.</p>

<p>"You see that, major?" said he, pointing to the ground.</p>

<p>"I should be blind if I didn't," replied the officer.  "A pool
of blood&mdash;as you say, big enough to have emptied the veins
of a buffalo. If it has come from those of a man, I should say
that whoever shed it is no longer in the land of the living."</p>

<p>"Dead!" pronounced the tracker.  "Dead before that blood had
turned purple&mdash;as it is now."</p>

<p>"Whose do you think it is, Spangler?"</p>

<p>"That of the man we're in search of&mdash;the son of the old
gentleman down there.  That's why I didn't wish him to come
forward."</p>

<p>"He may as well know the worst.  He must find it out in
time."</p>

<p>"True what you say, major; but we had better first find out
how the young fellow has come to be thrown in his tracks.  That's
what is puzzling me."</p>

<p>"How! by the Indians, of course?  The Comanches have done
it?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," rejoined the scout, with an air of
confidence.</p>

<p>"Hu! why do you say that, Spangler?"</p>

<p>"Because, you see, if the Indyins had a been here, there would
be forty horse-tracks instead of four, and them made by only two
horses."</p>

<p>"There's truth in that.  It isn't likely a single Comanch
would have had the daring, even to assassinate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No Comanche, major, no Indyin of any kind committed this
murder.  There are two horse-tracks along the opening.  As you
see, both are shod; and they're the same that have come back
again.  Comanches don't ride shod horses, except when they've
stolen them.  Both these were ridden by white men.  One set of
the tracks has been made by a mustang, though it it was a big
'un.  The other is the hoof of an American horse.  Goin' west the
mustang was foremost; you can tell that by the overlap.  Comin'
back the States horse was in the lead, the other followin' him;
though it's hard to say how fur behind.  I may be able to tell
better, if we keep on to the place whar both must have turned
back.  It can't be a great ways off."</p>

<p>"Let us proceed thither, then," said the major.  "I shall
command the people to stay where they are."</p>

<p>Having issued the command, in a voice loud enough to be heard
by his following, the major rode away from the bloodstained spot,
preceded by the tracker.</p>

<p>For about four hundred yards further on, the two sets of
tracks were traceable; but by the eye of the major, only where
the turf was softer under the shadow of the trees.  So
far&mdash;the scout said the horses had passed and returned in
the order already declared by him:&mdash;that is, the mustang in
the lead while proceeding westward, and in the rear while going
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>At this point the trail ended&mdash;both horses, as was
already known, having returned on their own tracks.</p>

<p>Before taking the back track, however, they had halted, and
stayed some time in the same place&mdash;under the branches of a
spreading cottonwood. The turf, much trampled around the trunk of
the tree, was evidence of this.</p>

<p>The tracker got off his horse to examine it; and, stooping to
the earth, carefully scrutinised the sign.</p>

<p>"They've been here thegither," said he, after several minutes
spent in his analysis, "and for some time; though neither's been
out of the saddle.  They've been on friendly terms, too; which
makes it all the more unexplainable.  They must have quarrelled
afterwards."</p>

<p>"If you are speaking the truth, Spangler, you must be a witch.
How on earth can you know all that?"</p>

<p>"By the sign, major; by the sign.  It's simple enough.  I see
the shoes of both horses lapping over each other a score of
times; and in such a way that shows they must have been
thegither&mdash;the animals, it might be, restless and movin'
about.  As for the time, they've taken long enough to smoke a
cigar apiece&mdash;close to the teeth too.  Here are the stumps;
not enough left to fill a fellow's pipe."</p>

<p>The tracker, stooping as he spoke, picked up a brace of cigar
stumps, and handed them to the major.</p>

<p>"By the same token," he continued, "I conclude that the two
horsemen, whoever they were, while under this tree could not have
had any very hostile feelins, the one to the tother.  Men don't
smoke in company with the design of cutting each other's throats,
or blowing out one another's brains, the instant afterwards.  The
trouble between them must have come on after the cigars were
smoked out.  That it did come there can be no doubt.  As sure,
major, as you're sittin' in your saddle, one of them has wiped
out the other.  I can only guess which has been wiped out, by the
errand we're on.  Poor Mr Poindexter will niver more see his son
alive."</p>

<p>"'Tis very mysterious," remarked the major.</p>

<p>"It is, by jingo!"</p>

<p>"And the body, too; where can <i>it</i> be?"</p>

<p>"That's what purplexes me most of all.  If 't had been
Indyins, I wouldn't a thought much o' its being missin'.  They
might a carried the man off wi them to make a target of him, if
only wounded; and if dead, to eat him, maybe.  But there's been
no Indyins here&mdash;not a redskin. Take my word for it, major,
one o' the two men who rid these horses has wiped out the other;
and sartinly he <i>have</i> wiped him out in the litterlest sense
o' the word.  What he's done wi' the body beats me; and perhaps
only hisself can tell."</p>

<p>"Most strange!" exclaimed the major, pronouncing the words
with emphasis&mdash;"most mysterious!"</p>

<p>"It's possible we may yet unravel some o' the mystery,"
pursued Spangler.  "We must follow up the tracks of the horses,
after they started from this&mdash;that is, from where the deed
was done.  We may make something out of that.  There's nothing
more to be learnt here.  We may as well go back, major.  Am I to
tell <i>him</i>?"</p>

<p>"Mr Poindexter, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  You are convinced that his son is the man who has been
murdered?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; not so much as that comes to.  Only convinced that
the horse the old gentleman is now riding is one of the two
that's been over this ground last night&mdash;the States horse I
feel sure.  I have compared the tracks; and if young Poindexter
was the man who was on <i>his back</i>, I fear there's not much
chance for the poor fellow.  It looks ugly that the other <i>rid
after</i> him."</p>

<p>"Spangler! have you any suspicion as to who the other may
be?"</p>

<p>"Not a spark, major.  If't hadn't been for the tale of Old
Duffer I'd never have thought of Maurice the mustanger.  True,
it's the track o' a shod mustang; but I don't know it to be hisn.
Surely it can't be?  The young Irishman aint the man to stand
nonsense from nobody; but as little air he the one to do a deed
like this&mdash;that is, if it's been cold-blooded killin'."</p>

<p>"I think as you about that."</p>

<p>"And you may think so, major.  If young Poindexter's been
killed, and by Maurice Gerald, there's been a fair stand-up fight
atween them, and the planter's son has gone under.  That's how I
shed reckon it up.  As to the disappearance o' the dead
body&mdash;for them two quarts o' blood could only have come out
o' a body that's now dead&mdash;that <i>trees me</i>.  We must
follow the trail, howsoever; and maybe it'll fetch us to some
sensible concloosion.  Am I to tell the old gentleman what I
think o't?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps better not.  He knows enough already.  It will at
least fall lighter upon him if he find things out by piecemeal.
Say nothing of what we've seen.  If you can take up the trail of
the two horses after going off from the place where the blood is,
I shall manage to bring the command after you without any one
suspecting what we've seen."</p>

<p>"All right, major," said the scout, "I think I can guess where
the off trail goes.  Give me ten minutes upon it, and then come
on to my signal."</p>

<p>So saying the tracker rode back to the "place of blood;" and
after what appeared a very cursory examination, turned off into a
lateral opening in the chapparal.</p>

<p>Within the promised time his shrill whistle announced that he
was nearly a mile distant, and in a direction altogether
different from the spot that had been profaned by some sanguinary
scene.</p>

<p>On hearing the signal, the commander of the
expedition&mdash;who had in the meantime returned to his
party&mdash;gave orders to advance; while he himself, with
Poindexter and the other principal men, moved ahead, without his
revealing to any one of his retinue the chapter of strange
disclosures for which he was indebted to the "instincts" of his
tracker.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch40"></a>CHAPTER FORTY.<br>

THE MARKED BULLET.</h2>

<p class="first">
BEFORE coming up with the scout, an incident occurred to vary
the monotony of the march.  Instead of keeping along the avenue,
the major had conducted his command in a diagonal direction
through the chapparal. He had done this to avoid giving
unnecessary pain to the afflicted father; who would otherwise
have looked upon the life-blood of his son, or at least what the
major believed to be so.  The gory spot was shunned, and as the
discovery was not yet known to any other save the major himself,
and the tracker who had made it, the party moved on in ignorance
of the existence of such a dread sign.</p>

<p>The path they were now pursuing was a mere cattle-track,
scarce broad enough for two to ride abreast.  Here and there were
glades where it widened out for a few yards, again running into
the thorny chapparal.</p>

<p>On entering one of these glades, an animal sprang out of the
bushes, and bounded off over the sward.  A beautiful creature it
was, with its fulvous coat ocellated with rows of shining
rosettes; its strong lithe limbs supporting a smooth cylindrical
body, continued into a long tapering tail; the very type of
agility; a creature rare even in these remote solitudes&mdash;the
jaguar.</p>

<p>Its very rarity rendered it the more desirable as an object to
test the skill of the marksman; and, notwithstanding the serious
nature of the expedition, two of the party were tempted to
discharge their rifles at the retreating animal.</p>

<p>They were Cassius Calhoun, and a young planter who was riding
by his side.</p>

<p>The jaguar dropped dead in its tracks: a bullet having entered
its body, and traversed the spine in a longitudinal
direction.</p>

<p>Which of the two was entitled to the credit of the successful
shot? Calhoun claimed it, and so did the young planter.</p>

<p>The shots had been fired simultaneously, and only one of them
had hit.</p>

<p>"I shall show you," confidently asserted the ex-officer,
dismounting beside the dead jaguar, and unsheathing his knife.
"You see, gentlemen, the ball is still in the animal's body?  If
it's mine, you'll find my initials on it&mdash;C.C.&mdash;with a
crescent.  I mould my bullets so that I can always tell when I've
killed my game."</p>

<p>The swaggering air with which he held up the leaden missile
after extracting it told that he had spoken the truth.  A few of
the more curious drew near and examined the bullet.  Sure enough
it was moulded as Calhoun had declared, and the dispute ended in
the discomfiture of the young planter.</p>

<p>The party soon after came up with the tracker, waiting to
conduct them along a fresh trail.</p>

<p>It was no longer a track made by two horses, with shod hooves.
The turf showed only the hoof-marks of one; and so indistinctly,
that at times they were undiscernible to all eyes save those of
the tracker himself.</p>

<p>The trace carried them through the thicket, from glade to
glade&mdash;after a circuitous march&mdash;bringing them back
into the lane-like opening, at a point still further to the
west.</p>

<p>Spangler&mdash;though far from being the most accomplished of
his calling&mdash; took it; up as fast as the people could ride
after him.  In his own mind he had determined the character of
the animal whose footmarks he was following.  He knew it to be a
mustang&mdash;the same that had stood under the cottonwood whilst
its rider was smoking a cigar&mdash;the same whose hoof-mark he
had seen deeply indented in a sod saturated with human blood.</p>

<p>The track of the States horse he had also followed for a short
distance&mdash;in the interval, when he was left alone.  He saw
that it would conduct him back to the prairie through which they
had passed; and thence, in all likelihood, to the settlements on
the Leona.</p>

<p>He had forsaken it to trace the footsteps of the shod mustang;
more likely to lead him to an explanation of that red mystery of
murder&mdash; perhaps to the den of the assassin.</p>

<p>Hitherto perplexed by the hoof-prints of two horses
alternately overlapping each other, he was not less puzzled now,
while scrutinising the tracks of but one.</p>

<p>They went not direct, as those of an animal urged onwards upon
a journey; but here and there zigzagging; occasionally turning
upon themselves in short curves; then forward for a stretch; and
then circling again, as if the mustang was either not mounted, or
its rider was asleep in the saddle!</p>

<p>Could these be the hoof-prints of a horse with a man upon his
back&mdash;an assassin skulking away from the scene of
assassination, his conscience freshly excited by the crime?</p>

<p>Spangler did not think so.  He knew not what to think.  He was
mystified more than ever.  So confessed he to the major, when
being questioned as to the character of the trail.</p>

<p>A spectacle that soon afterwards came under his
eyes&mdash;simultaneously seen by every individual of the
party&mdash;so far from solving the mystery, had the effect of
rendering it yet more inexplicable.</p>

<p>More than this.  What had hitherto been but an ambiguous
affair&mdash;a subject for guess and speculation&mdash;was
suddenly transformed into a horror; of that intense kind that can
only spring from thoughts of the supernatural.</p>

<p>No one could say that this feeling of horror had arisen
without reason.</p>

<p>When a man is seen mounted on a horse's back, seated firmly in
the saddle, with limbs astride in the stirrups, body erect, and
hand holding the rein&mdash;in short, everything in air and
attitude required of a rider; when, on closer scrutiny, it is
observed: that there is something wanting to complete the idea of
a perfect equestrian; and, on still closer scrutiny, that this
something is the <i>head</i>, it would be strange if the
spectacle did not startle the beholder, terrifying him to the
very core of his heart.</p>

<p>And this very sight came before their eyes; causing them
simultaneously to rein up, and with as much suddenness, as if
each had rashly ridden within less than his horse's length of the
brink of an abyss!</p>

<p>The sun was low down, almost on a level with the sward. Facing
westward, his disc was directly before them.  His rays, glaring
redly in their eyes, hindered them from having a very accurate
view, towards the quarter of the west.  Still could they see that
strange shape above described&mdash;a horseman without a
head!</p>

<p>Had only one of the party declared himself to have seen it, he
would have been laughed at by his companions as a lunatic.  Even
two might have been stigmatised in a similar manner.</p>

<p>But what everybody saw at the same time, could not be
questioned; and only he would have been thought crazed, who
should have expressed incredulity about the presence of the
abnormal phenomenon.</p>

<p>No one did.  The eyes of all were turned in the same
direction, their gaze intently fixed on what was either a
horseman without the head, or the best counterfeit that could
have been contrived.</p>

<p>Was it this?  If not, what was it?</p>

<p>These interrogatories passed simultaneously through the minds
of all. As no one could answer them, even to himself, no answer
was vouchsafed. Soldiers and civilians sate silent in their
saddles&mdash;each expecting an explanation, which the other was
unable to supply.</p>

<p>There could be heard only mutterings, expressive of surprise
and terror. No one even offered a conjecture.</p>

<p>The headless horseman, whether phantom or real, when first
seen, was about entering the avenue&mdash;near the debouchure of
which the searchers had arrived.  Had he continued his course, he
must have met them in the teeth&mdash;supposing their courage to
have been equal to the encounter.</p>

<p>As it was, he had halted at the same instant as themselves;
and stood regarding them with a mistrust that may have been
mutual.</p>

<p>There was an interval of silence on both sides, during which a
cigar stump might have been heard falling upon the sward.  It was
then the strange apparition was most closely scrutinised by those
who had the courage: for the majority of the men sate shivering
in their stirrups&mdash; through sheer terror, incapable even of
thought!</p>

<p>The few who dared face the mystery, with any thought of
accounting for it, were baffled in their investigation by the
glare of the setting sun. They could only see that there was a
horse of large size and noble shape, with a man upon his back.
The figure of the man was less easily determined, on account of
the limbs being inserted into overalls, while his shoulders were
enveloped in an ample cloak-like covering.</p>

<p>What signified his shape, so long as it wanted that portion
most essential to existence?  A man without a head&mdash;on
horseback, sitting erect in the saddle, in an attitude of ease
and grace&mdash;with spurs sparkling upon his heels&mdash;the
bridle-rein held in one hand&mdash;the other where it should be,
resting lightly upon his thigh!</p>

<p>Great God! what could it mean?</p>

<p>Was it a phantom?  Surely it could not be human?</p>

<p>They who viewed it were not the men to have faith either in
phantoms, or phantasmagoria.  Many of them had met Nature in her
remotest solitudes, and wrestled with her in her roughest moods.
They were not given to a belief in ghosts.</p>

<p>But the confidence of the most incredulous was shaken by a
sight so strange&mdash;so absolutely unnatural&mdash;and to such
an extent, that the stoutest hearted of the party was forced
mentally to repeat the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Is it a phantom?  Surely it cannot be human</i>?"</p>

<p>Its size favoured the idea of the supernatural.  It appeared
double that of an ordinary man upon an ordinary horse.  It was
more like a giant on a gigantic steed; though this might have
been owing to the illusory light under which it was
seen&mdash;the refraction of the sun's rays passing horizontally
through the tremulous atmosphere of the parched plain.</p>

<p>There was but little time to philosophise&mdash;not enough to
complete a careful scrutiny of the unearthly apparition, which
every one present, with hand spread over his eyes to shade them
from the dazzling glare, was endeavouring to make.</p>

<p>Nothing of colour could be noted&mdash;neither the garments of
the man, nor the hairy coat of the horse.  Only the shape could
be traced, outlined in sable silhouette against the golden
background of the sky; and this in every change of attitude,
whether fronting the spectators, or turned stern towards them,
was still the same&mdash;still that inexplicable phenomenon: <i>a
horseman without a head</i>!</p>

<p>Was it a phantom?  Surely it could not be human?</p>

<p>"'Tis old Nick upon horseback!" cried a fearless frontiersman,
who would scarce have quailed to encounter his Satanic majesty
even in that guise. "By the 'tarnal Almighty, it's the devil
himself."</p>

<p>The boisterous laugh which succeeded the profane utterance of
the reckless speaker, while it only added to the awe of his less
courageous comrades, appeared to produce an effect on the
headless horseman. Wheeling suddenly round&mdash;his horse at the
same time sending forth a scream that caused either the earth or
the atmosphere to tremble&mdash;he commenced galloping away.</p>

<p>He went direct towards the sun; and continued this course,
until only by his motion could he be distinguished from one of
those spots that have puzzled the philosopher&mdash;at length
altogether disappearing, as though he had ridden into the
dazzling disc!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch41"></a>CHAPTER FORTY ONE.<br>

CUATRO CAVALLEROS.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE party of searchers, under the command of the major, was
not the only one that went forth from Fort Inge on that eventful
morning.</p>

<p>Nor was it the earliest to take saddle.  Long before&mdash;in
fact close following the dawn of day&mdash;a much smaller party,
consisting of only four horsemen, was seen setting out from the
suburbs of the village, and heading their horses in the direction
of the Nueces.</p>

<p>These could not be going in search of the dead body of Henry
Poindexter. At that hour no one suspected that the young man was
dead, or even that he was missing.  The riderless horse had not
yet come in to tell the tale of woe.  The settlement was still
slumbering, unconscious that innocent blood had been spilt.</p>

<p>Though setting out from nearly the same point, and proceeding
in a like direction, there was not the slightest similarity
between the two parties of mounted men.  Those earliest a-start
were all of pure Iberian blood; or this commingled with Aztecan.
In other words they were Mexicans.</p>

<p>It required neither skill nor close scrutiny to discover this.
A glance at themselves and their horses, their style of
equitation, the slight muscular development of their thighs and
hips&mdash;more strikingly observable in their deep-tree
saddles&mdash;the gaily coloured serapes shrouding their
shoulders, the wide velveteen calzoneros on their legs, the big
spurs on their boots, and broad-brimmed sombreros on their heads,
declared them either Mexicans, or men who had adopted the Mexican
costume.</p>

<p>That they were the former there was not a question.  The
sallow hue; the pointed Vandyke beard, covering the chin,
sparsely&mdash;though not from any thinning by the
shears&mdash;the black, close-cropped <i>chevelure</i>; the
regular facial outline, were all indisputable characteristics of
the Hispano-Moro-Aztecan race, who now occupy the ancient
territory of the Moctezumas.</p>

<p>One of the four was a man of larger frame than any of his
companions. He rode a better horse; was more richly apparelled;
carried upon his person arms and equipments of a superior finish;
and was otherwise distinguished, so as to leave no doubt about
his being the leader of the <i>cuartilla</i>.</p>

<p>He was a man of between thirty and forty years of age, nearer
to the latter than the former; though a smooth, rounded
cheek&mdash;furnished with a short and carefully trimmed
whisker&mdash;gave him the appearance of being younger than he
was.</p>

<p>But for a cold animal eye, and a heaviness of feature that
betrayed a tendency to behave with brutality&mdash;if not with
positive cruelty&mdash;the individual in question might have been
described as handsome.</p>

<p>A well formed mouth, with twin rows of white teeth between the
lips, even when these were exhibited in a smile, did not remove
this unpleasant impression.  It but reminded the beholder of the
sardonic grin that may have been given by Satan, when, after the
temptation had succeeded, he gazed contemptuously back upon the
mother of mankind.</p>

<p>It was not his looks that had led to his having become known
among his comrades by a peculiar nick-name; that of an animal
well known upon the plains of Texas.</p>

<p>His deeds and disposition had earned for him the unenviable
soubriquet "El Coyote."</p>

<p>How came he to be crossing the prairie at this early hour of
the morning&mdash;apparently sober, and acting as the leader of
others&mdash;when on the same morning, but a few hours before, he
was seen drunk in his jacale&mdash;so drunk as to be unconscious
of having a visitor, or, at all events, incapable of giving that
visitor a civil reception?</p>

<p>The change of situation though sudden&mdash;and to some extent
strange&mdash;is not so difficult of explanation.  It will be
understood after an account has been given of his movements, from
the time of Calhoun's leaving him, till the moment of meeting him
in the saddle, in company with his three <i>conpaisanos</i>.</p>

<p>On riding away from his hut, Calhoun had left the door, as he
had found it, ajar; and in this way did it remain until the
morning&mdash;El Coyote all the time continuing his sonorous
slumber.</p>

<p>At daybreak he was aroused by the raw air that came drifting
over him in the shape of a chilly fog.  This to some extent
sobered him; and, springing up from his skin-covered truck, he
commenced staggering over the floor&mdash;all the while uttering
anathemas against the cold, and the door for letting it in.</p>

<p>It might be expected that he would have shut to the latter on
the instant; but he did not.  It was the only aperture, excepting
some holes arising from dilapidation, by which light was admitted
into the interior of the jacale; and light he wanted, to enable
him to carry out the design that had summoned him to his
feet.</p>

<p>The grey dawn, just commencing to creep in through the open
doorway, scarce sufficed for his purpose; and it was only after a
good while spent in groping about, interspersed with a series of
stumblings, and accompanied by a string of profane exclamations,
that he succeeded in finding that he was searching for: a large
two-headed gourd, with a strap around its middle, used as a
canteen for carrying water, or more frequently <i>mezcal</i>.</p>

<p>The odour escaping from its uncorked end told that it had
recently contained this potent spirit; but that it was now empty,
was announced by another profane ejaculation that came from the
lips of its owner, as he made the discovery.</p>

<p>"<i>Sangre de Cristo</i>!" he cried, in an accent of angry
disappointment, giving the gourd a shake to assure himself of its
emptiness.  "Not a drop&mdash;not enough to drown a chiga!  And
my tongue sticking to my teeth. My throat feels as if I had
bolted a <i>brazero</i> of red-hot charcoal.  Por Dios!  I can't
stand it.  What's to be done?  Daylight?  It is.  I must up to
the <i>pueblita</i>.  It's possible that Señor Doffer may have
his trap open by this time to catch the early birds.  If so,
he'll find a customer in the Coyote.  Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Slinging the gourd strap around his neck, and thrusting his
head through the slit of his serape, he set forth for the
village.</p>

<p>The tavern was but a few hundred yards from his hut, on the
same side of the river, and approachable by a path, that he could
have travelled with his eyes under "tapojos."  In twenty minutes
after, he was staggering past the sign-post of the "Rough and
Ready."</p>

<p>He chanced to be in luck.  Oberdoffer was in his bar-room,
serving some early customers&mdash;a party of soldiers who had
stolen out of quarters to swallow their morning dram.</p>

<p>"Mein Gott, Mishter Dees!" said the landlord, saluting the
newly arrived guest, and without ceremony forsaking six
<i>credit</i> customers, for one that he knew to be <i>cash</i>.
"Mein Gott! is it you I sees so early ashtir?  I knowsh vat you
vant.  You vant your pig coord fill mit ze Mexican
spirits&mdash;ag&mdash;ag&mdash;vat you call it?"</p>

<p>"<i>Aguardiente</i>!  You've guessed it, cavallero.  That's
just what I want."</p>

<p>"A tollar&mdash;von tollar ish the price."</p>

<p>"<i>Carrambo</i>!  I've paid it often enough to know that.
Here's the coin, and there's the canteen.  Fill, and be quick
about it!"</p>

<p>"Ha! you ish in a hurry, mein herr.  Fel&mdash;I von't keeps
you waitin'; I suppose you ish off for the wild horsh prairish.
If there's anything goot among the droves, I'm afeart that the
Irishmans will pick it up before you.  He went off lasht night.
He left my housh at a late hour&mdash; after midnight it
wash&mdash;a very late hour, to go a shourney!  But he's a queer
cushtomer is that mushtanger, Mister Maurish Sherralt.  Nobody
knows his ways.  I shouldn't say anythings againsht him.  He hash
been a goot cushtomer to me.  He has paid his bill like a rich
man, and he hash plenty peside.  Mein Gott! his pockets wash
cramm mit tollars!"</p>

<p>On hearing that the Irishman had gone off to the "horsh
prairish," as Oberdoffer termed them, the Mexican by his
demeanour betrayed more than an ordinary interest in the
announcement.</p>

<p>It was proclaimed, first by a slight start of surprise, and
then by an impatience of manner that continued to mark his
movements, while listening to the long rigmarole that
followed.</p>

<p>It was clear that he did not desire anything of this to be
observed. Instead of questioning his informant upon the subject
thus started, or voluntarily displaying any interest in it, he
rejoined in a careless drawl&mdash;</p>

<p>"It don't concern me, cavallero.  There are plenty of
<i>mustenos</i> on the plains&mdash;enough to give employment to
all the horse-catchers in Texas. Look alive, señor, and let's
have the aguardiente!"</p>

<p>A little chagrined at being thus rudely checked in his attempt
at a gossip, the German Boniface hastily filled the gourd
canteen; and, without essaying farther speech, handed it across
the counter, took the dollar in exchange, chucked the coin into
his till, and then moved back to his military customers, more
amiable because drinking <i>upon the score</i>.</p>

<p>Diaz, notwithstanding the eagerness he had lately exhibited to
obtain the liquor, walked out of the bar-room, and away from the
hotel, without taking the stopper from his canteen, or even
appearing to think of it!</p>

<p>His excited air was no longer that of a man merely longing for
a glass of ardent spirits.  There was something stronger stirring
within, that for the time rendered him oblivious of the
appetite.</p>

<p>Whatever it may have been it did not drive him direct to his
home: for not until he had paid a visit to three other hovels
somewhat similar to his own&mdash;all situated in the suburbs of
the <i>pueblita</i>, and inhabited by men like himself&mdash;not
till then, did he return to his jacale.</p>

<p>It was on getting back, that he noticed for the first time the
tracks of a shod horse; and saw where the animal had been tied to
a tree that stood near the hut.</p>

<p>"<i>Carrambo</i>!" he exclaimed, on perceiving this sign,
"<i>the Capitan Americano</i> has been here in the night.  Por
Dios!  I remember something&mdash;I thought I had dreamt it.  I
can guess his errand.  He has heard of Don Mauricio's departure.
Perhaps he'll repeat his visit, when he thinks I'm in a proper
state to receive him?  Ha! ha!  It don't matter now.  The thing's
all understood; and I sha'n't need any further instructions from
him, till I've earned his thousand dollars.  <i>Mil pesos</i>!
What a splendid fortune!  Once gained, I shall go back to the Rio
Grande, and see what can be done with Isidora."</p>

<p>After delivering the above soliloquy, he remained at his hut
only long enough to swallow a few mouthfuls of roasted
<i>tasajo</i>, washing them down with as many gulps of mezcal.
Then having caught and caparisoned his horse, buckled on his huge
heavy spurs, strapped his short carbine to the saddle, thrust a
pair of pistols into their holsters, and belted the leathern
sheathed machete on his hip, he sprang into the stirrups, and
rode rapidly away.</p>

<p>The short interval that elapsed, before making his appearance
on the open plain, was spent in the suburbs of the
village&mdash;waiting for the three horsemen who accompanied him,
and who had been forewarned of their being wanted to act as his
coadjutors, in some secret exploit that required their
assistance.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, his trio of <i>confreres</i> appeared to have
been made acquainted with the scheme; or at all events that the
scene of the exploit was to be on the Alamo.  When a short
distance out upon the plain, seeing Diaz strike off in a diagonal
direction, they called out to warn him, that he was not going the
right way.</p>

<p>"I know the Alamo well," said one of them, himself a
mustanger.  "I've hunted horses there many a time.  It's
southwest from here.  The nearest way to it is through an opening
in the chapparal you see out yonder. You are heading too much to
the west, Don Miguel!"</p>

<p>"Indeed!" contemptuously retorted the leader of the cuartilla.
"You're a <i>gringo</i>, Señor Vicente Barajo!  You forget the
errand we're upon; and that we are riding shod horses?  Indians
don't go out from Port Inge and then direct to the Alamo to
do&mdash;no matter what.  I suppose you understand me?"</p>

<p>"Oh true!" answered Señor Vicente Barajo, "I beg your pardon,
Don Miguel.  <i>Carrambo</i>!  I did not think of that."</p>

<p>And without further protest, the three coadjutors of El Coyote
fell into his tracks, and followed him in silence&mdash;scarce
another word passing between him and them, till they had struck
the chapparal, at a point several miles above the opening of
which Barajo had made mention.</p>

<p>Once under cover of the thicket, the four men dismounted; and,
after tying their horses to the trees, commenced a performance
that could only be compared to a scene in the gentlemen's
dressing-room of a suburban theatre, preliminary to the
representation of some savage and sanguinary drama.</p>

<h2><a id="ch42"></a>CHAPTER FORTY TWO.<br>

VULTURES ON THE WING.</h2>

<p class="first">
HE who has travelled across the plains of Southern Texas
cannot fail to have witnessed a spectacle of common
occurrence&mdash;a flock of black vultures upon the wing.</p>

<p>An hundred or more in the flock, swooping in circles, or wide
spiral gyrations&mdash;now descending almost to touch the prairie
award, or the spray of the chapparal&mdash;anon soaring upward by
a power in which the wing bears no part&mdash;their pointed
pinions sharply cutting against the clear sky&mdash;they
constitute a picture of rare interest, one truly characteristic
of a tropical clime.</p>

<p>The traveller who sees it for the first time will not fail to
rein up his horse, and sit in his saddle, viewing it with
feelings of curious interest.  Even he who is accustomed to the
spectacle will not pass on without indulging in a certain train
of thought which it is calculated to call forth.</p>

<p>There is a tale told by the assemblage of base birds.  On the
ground beneath them, whether seen by the traveller or not, is
stretched some stricken creature&mdash;quadruped, or it may be
<i>man</i>&mdash;dead, or it may be <i>dying</i>.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">ON the morning that succeeded that sombre night,
when the three solitary horsemen made the crossing of the plain,
a spectacle similar to that described might have been witnessed
above the chapparal into which they had ridden.  A flock of black
vultures, of both species, was disporting above the tops of the
trees, near the point where the avenue angled.</p>

<p>At daybreak not one could have been seen.  In less than an
hour after, hundreds were hovering above the spot, on widespread
wings, their shadows sailing darkly over the green spray of the
chapparal.</p>

<p>A Texan traveller entering the avenue, and observing the
ominous assemblage, would at once have concluded, that there was
death upon his track.</p>

<p>Going farther, he would have found confirmatory evidence, in a
pool of blood trampled by the hooves of horses.</p>

<p>Not exactly over this were the vultures engaged in their
aerial evolutions.  The centre of their swoopings appeared to be
a point some distance off among the trees; and there, no doubt,
would be discovered the quarry that had called them together.</p>

<p>At that early hour there was no traveller&mdash;Texan, or
stranger&mdash;to test the truth of the conjecture; but, for all
that, it was true.</p>

<p>At a point in the chapparal, about a quarter of a mile from
the blood-stained path, lay stretched upon the ground the object
that was engaging the attention of the vultures.</p>

<p>It was not carrion, nor yet a quadruped; but a human
being&mdash;a man!</p>

<p>A young man, too, of noble lineaments and graceful
shape&mdash;so far as could be seen under the cloak that shrouded
his recumbent form&mdash;with a face fair to look upon, even in
death.</p>

<p>Was he dead?</p>

<p>At first sight any one would have said so, and the black birds
believed it.  His attitude and countenance seemed to proclaim it
beyond question.</p>

<p>He was lying upon his back, with face upturned to the
sky&mdash;no care being taken to shelter it from the sun.  His
limbs, too, were not in a natural posture; but extended stiffly
along the stony surface, as if he had lost the power to control
them.</p>

<p>A colossal tree was near, a live oak, but it did not shadow
him.  He was outside the canopy of its frondage; and the sun's
beams, just beginning to penetrate the chapparal, were slanting
down upon his pale face&mdash;paler by reflection from a white
Panama hat that but partially shaded it.</p>

<p>His features did not seem set in death: and as little was it
like sleep. It had more the look of death than sleep.  The eyes
were but half closed; and the pupils could be seen glancing
through the lashes, glassy and dilated.  Was the man dead?</p>

<p>Beyond doubt, the black birds believed that he was.  But the
black birds were judging only by appearances.  Their wish was
parent to the thought. They were mistaken.</p>

<p>Whether it was the glint of the sun striking into his half-
screened orbs, or nature becoming restored after a period of
repose, the eyes of the prostrate man were seen to open to their
full extent, while a movement was perceptible throughout his
whole frame.</p>

<p>Soon after he raised himself a little; and, resting upon his
elbow, stared confusedly around him.</p>

<p>The vultures soared upward into the air, and for the time
maintained a higher flight.</p>

<p>"Am I dead, or living?" muttered he to himself.  "Dreaming, or
awake? Which is it?  Where am I?"</p>

<p>The sunlight was blinding him.  He could see nothing, till he
had shaded his eyes with his hand; then only indistinctly.</p>

<p>"Trees above&mdash;around me!  Stones underneath!  That I can
tell by the aching of my bones.  A chapparal forest!  How came I
into it?</p>

<p>"Now I have it," continued he, after a short spell of
reflection.  "My head was dashed against a tree.  There it
is&mdash;the very limb that lifted me out of the saddle.  My left
leg pains me.  Ah!  I remember; it came in contact with the
trunk.  By heavens, I believe it is broken!"</p>

<p>As he said this, he made an effort to raise himself into an
erect attitude.  It proved a failure.  His sinister limb would
lend him no assistance: it was swollen at the knee-
joint&mdash;either shattered or dislocated.</p>

<p>"Where is the horse?  Gone off, of course.  By this time, in
the stables of Casa del Corvo.  I need not care now.  I could not
mount him, if he were standing by my side.</p>

<p>"The other?" he added, after a pause.  "Good heavens! what a
spectacle it was!  No wonder it scared the one I was riding!</p>

<p>"What am I to do?  My leg may be broken.  I can't stir from
this spot, without some one to help me.  Ten chances to
one&mdash;a hundred&mdash;a thousand&mdash;against any one coming
this way; at least not till I've become food for those filthy
birds.  Ugh! the hideous brutes; they stretch out their beaks, as
if already sure of making a meal upon me!</p>

<p>"How long have I been lying here?  The surf don't seem very
high.  It was just daybreak, as I climbed into the saddle.  I
suppose I've been unconscious about an hour.  By my faith, I'm in
a serious scrape?  In all likelihood a broken limb&mdash;it feels
broken&mdash;with no surgeon to set it; a stony couch in the
heart of a Texan chapparal&mdash;the thicket around me, perhaps
for miles&mdash;no chance to escape from it of myself&mdash;no
hope of human creature coming to help me&mdash;wolves on the
earth, and vultures in the air!  Great God! why did I mount,
without making sure of the rein? I may have ridden my last
ride!"</p>

<p>The countenance of the young man became clouded; and the cloud
grew darker, and deeper, as he continued to reflect upon the
perilous position in which a simple accident had placed him.</p>

<p>Once more he essayed to rise to his feet, and succeeded; only
to find, that he had but one leg on which he could rely!  It was
no use, standing upon it; and he lay down again.</p>

<p>Two hours were passed without any change in his situation;
during which he had caused the chapparal to ring with a loud
hallooing.  He only desisted from this, under the conviction:
that there was no one at all likely to hear him.</p>

<p>The shouting caused thirst; or at all events hastened the
advent of this appetite&mdash;surely coming on as the concomitant
of the injuries he had received.</p>

<p>The sensation was soon experienced to such an extent that
everything else&mdash;even the pain of his wounds&mdash;became of
trifling consideration.</p>

<p>"It will kill me, if I stay here?" reflected the sufferer.  "I
must make an effort to reach water.  If I remember aright there's
a stream somewhere in this chapparal, and not such a great way
off.  I must get to it, if I have to crawl upon my hands and
knees.  Knees! and only one in a condition to support me! There's
no help for it but try.  The longer I stay here, the worse it
will be.  The sun grows hotter.  It already burns into my brain.
I may lose my senses, and then&mdash;the wolves&mdash;the
vultures&mdash;"</p>

<p>The horrid apprehension caused silence and shuddering.  After
a time he continued:</p>

<p>"If I but knew the right way to go.  I remember the stream
well enough. It runs towards the chalk prairie.  It should be
south-east, from here. I shall try that way.  By good luck the
sun guides me.  If I find water all may yet be well.  God give me
strength to reach it!"</p>

<p>With this prayer upon his lips, he commenced making his way
through the thicket&mdash;creeping over the stony ground, and
dragging after him his disabled leg, like some huge Saurian whose
vertebrae have been disjointed by a blow!</p>

<p>Lizard-like, he continued his crawl.</p>

<p>The effort was painful in the extreme; but the apprehension
from which he suffered was still more painful, and urged him to
continue it.</p>

<p>He well knew there was a chance of his falling a victim to
thirst&mdash; almost a certainty, if he did not succeed in
finding water.</p>

<p>Stimulated by this knowledge he crept on.</p>

<p>At short intervals he was compelled to pause, and recruit his
strength by a little rest.  A man does not travel far, on his
hands and knees, without feeling fatigued.  Much more, when one
of the four members cannot be employed in the effort.</p>

<p>His progress was slow and irksome.  Besides, it was being made
under the most discouraging circumstances.  He might not be going
in the right direction?  Nothing but the dread of death could
have induced him to keep on.</p>

<p>He had made about a quarter of a mile from the point of
starting, when it occurred to him that a better plan of
locomotion might be adopted&mdash; one that would, at all events,
vary the monotony of his march.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said he, "I might manage to hobble a bit, if I only
had a crutch?  Ho! my knife is still here.  Thank fortune for
that!  And there's a sapling of the right size&mdash;a bit of
blackjack.  It will do."</p>

<p>Drawing the knife&mdash;a "bowie"&mdash;from his belt, he cut
down the dwarf-oak; and soon reduced it to a rude kind of crutch;
a fork in the tree serving for the head.</p>

<p>Then rising erect, and fitting the fork into his armpit, he
proceeded with his exploration.</p>

<p>He knew the necessity of keeping to one course; and, as he had
chosen the south-east, he continued in this direction.</p>

<p>It was not so easy.  The sun was his only compass; but this
had now reached the meridian, and, in the latitude of Southern
Texas, at that season of the year, the midday sun is almost in
the zenith.  Moreover, he had the chapparal to contend with,
requiring constant detours to take advantage of its openings.  He
had a sort of guide in the sloping of the ground: for he knew
that downward he was more likely to find the stream.</p>

<p>After proceeding about a mile&mdash;not in one continued
march, but by short stages, with intervals of rest
between&mdash;he came upon a track made by the wild animals that
frequent the chapparal.  It was slight, but running in a direct
line&mdash;a proof that it led to some point of peculiar
consideration&mdash;in all likelihood a watering-
place&mdash;stream, pond, or spring.</p>

<p>Any of these three would serve his purpose; and, without
longer looking to the sun, or the slope of the ground, he
advanced along the trail&mdash;now hobbling upon his crutch, and
at times, when tired of this mode, dropping down upon his hands
and crawling as before.</p>

<p>The cheerful anticipations he had indulged in, on discovering
the trail, soon, came to a termination.  It became <i>blind</i>.
In other words it ran out&mdash;ending in a glade surrounded by
impervious masses of underwood.  He saw, to his dismay, that it
led <i>from</i> the glade, instead of <i>towards</i> it.  He had
been following it the wrong way!</p>

<p>Unpleasant as was the alternative, there was no other than to
return upon his track.  To stay in the glade would have been to
die there.</p>

<p>He retraced the trodden path&mdash;going on beyond the point
where he had first struck it.</p>

<p>Nothing but the torture of thirst could have endowed him with
strength or spirit to proceed.  And this was every moment
becoming more unendurable.</p>

<p>The trees through which he was making way were mostly acacias,
interspersed with cactus and wild agave.  They afforded scarce
any shelter from the sun, that now in mid-heaven glared down
through their gossamer foliage with the fervour of fire
itself.</p>

<p>The perspiration, oozing through every pore of his skin,
increased the tendency to thirst&mdash;until the appetite became
an agony!</p>

<p>Within reach of his hand were the glutinous legumes of the
<i>mezquites</i>, filled with mellifluous moisture.  The agaves
and cactus plants, if tapped, would have exuded an abundance of
juice.  The former was too sweet, the latter too acrid to tempt
him.</p>

<p>He was acquainted with the character of both.  He knew that,
instead of allaying his thirst, they would only have added to its
intensity.</p>

<p>He passed the depending pods, without plucking them.  He
passed the succulent stalks, without tapping thorn.</p>

<p>To augment his anguish, he now discovered that the wounded
limb was, every moment, becoming more unmanageable.  It had
swollen to enormous dimensions.  Every step caused him a spasm of
pain.  Even if going in the direction of the doubtful streamlet,
he might never succeed in reaching it?  If not, there was no hope
for him.  He could but lie down in the thicket, and die!</p>

<p>Death would not be immediate.  Although suffering acute pain
in his head, neither the shock it had received, nor the damage
done to his knee, were like to prove speedily fatal.  He might
dread a more painful way of dying than from wounds.  Thirst would
be his destroyer&mdash;of all shapes of death perhaps the most
agonising.</p>

<p>The thought stimulated him to renewed efforts; and despite the
slow progress he was able to make&mdash;despite the pain
experienced in making it&mdash;he toiled on.</p>

<p>The black birds hovering above, kept pace with his halting
step and laborious crawl.  Now more than a mile from the point of
their first segregation, they were all of them still
there&mdash;their numbers even augmented by fresh detachments
that had become warned of the expected prey.  Though aware that
the quarry still lived and moved, they saw that it was stricken.
Instinct&mdash;perhaps rather experience&mdash;told them it must
soon succumb.</p>

<p>Their shadows crossed and recrossed the track upon which he
advanced&mdash; filling him with ominous fears for the end.</p>

<p>There was no noise: for these birds are silent in their
flight&mdash;even when excited by the prospect of a repast.  The
hot sun had stilled the voices of the crickets and tree-toads.
Even the hideous "horned frog" reclined listless along the earth,
sheltering its tuberculated body under the stones.</p>

<p>The only sounds to disturb the solitude of the chapparal were
those made by the sufferer himself&mdash;the swishing of his
garments, as they brushed against the hirsute plants that beset
the path; and occasionally his cries, sent forth in the faint
hope of their being heard.</p>

<p>By this time, blood was mingling with the sweat upon his skin.
The spines of the cactus, and the clawlike thorns of the agave,
had been doing their work; and scarce an inch of the epidermis
upon his face, hands, and limbs, that was not rent with a
laceration.</p>

<p>He was near to the point of despondence&mdash;in real truth,
he had reached it: for after a spell of shouting he had flung
himself prostrate along the earth, despairingly indifferent about
proceeding farther.</p>

<p>In all likelihood it was the attitude that saved him.  Lying
with his ear close to the surface, he heard a sound&mdash;so
slight, that it would not have been otherwise discernible.</p>

<p>Slight as it was, he could distinguish it, as the very sound
for which his senses were sharpened.  It was the murmur of moving
water!</p>

<p>With an ejaculation of joy, he sprang to his feet, as if
nothing were amiss; and made direct towards the point whence
proceeded the sound.</p>

<p>He plied his improvised crutch with redoubled energy.  Even
the disabled leg appeared to sustain him.  It was strength and
the love of life, struggling against decrepitude and the fear of
death.</p>

<p>The former proved victorious; and, in ten minutes after, he
lay stretched along the sward, on the banks of a crystal
streamlet&mdash; wondering why the want of water could have
caused him such indescribable agony!</p>

<h2><a id="ch43"></a>CHAPTER FORTY THREE.<br>

THE CUP AND THE JAR.</h2>

<p class="first">
ONCE more the mustanger's hut!  Once more his henchman,
astride of a stool in the middle of the floor!  Once more his
hound lying astretch upon the skin-covered hearth, with snout
half buried in the cinders!</p>

<p>The relative positions of the man and the dog are essentially
the same&mdash; as when seen on a former occasion&mdash;their
attitudes almost identical. Otherwise there is a change in the
picture since last painted&mdash;a transformation at once
striking and significant.</p>

<p>The horse-hide door, standing ajar, still hangs upon its
hinges; and the smooth coats of the wild steeds shine lustrously
along the walls.  The slab table, too, is there, the trestle
bedstead, the two stools, and the "shake down" of the
servitor.</p>

<p>But the other "chattels" wont to be displayed against the skin
tapestry are either out of sight, or displaced.  The double gun
has been removed from its rack; the silver cup, hunting horn, and
dog-call, are no longer suspended from their respective pegs; the
saddle, bridles, ropes, and serapes are unslung; and the books,
ink, pens, and <i>papeterie</i> have entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>At first sight it might be supposed that Indians have paid a
visit to the jacale, and pillaged it of its <i>penates</i>.</p>

<p>But no.  Had this been the case, Phelim would not be sitting
so unconcernedly on the stool, with his carroty scalp still upon
his head.</p>

<p>Though the walls are stripped nothing has been carried away.
The articles are still there, only with a change of place; and
the presence of several corded packages, lying irregularly over
the floor&mdash;among which is the leathern
portmanteau&mdash;proclaims the purpose of the transposition.</p>

<p>Though a clearing out has not been made, it is evident that
one is intended.</p>

<p>In the midst of the general displacement, one piece of
plenishing was still seen in its accustomed corner&mdash;the
demijohn.  It was seen by Phelim, oftener than any other article
in the room: for no matter in what direction he might turn his
eyes, they were sure to come round again to that wicker-covered
vessel that stood so temptingly in the angle.</p>

<p>"Ach! me jewel, it's there yez are!" said he, apostrophising
the demijohn for about the twentieth time, "wid more than two
quarts av the crayther inside yer bewtifull belly, and not doin'
ye a bit av good, nayther.  If the tinth part av it was inside av
me, it wud be a moighty binnefit to me intistines.  Trath wud it
that same.  Wudn't it, Tara?"</p>

<p>On hearing his name pronounced, the dog raised his head and
looked inquiringly around, to see what was wanted of him.</p>

<p>Perceiving that his human companion was but talking to
himself, he resumed his attitude of repose.</p>

<p>"Faix!  I don't want any answer to that, owld boy.  It's
meself that knows it, widout tillin'.  A hape av good a glass of
that same potyeen would do me; and I dar'n't touch a dhrap,
afther fwhat the masther sid to me about it.  Afther all that
packin', too, till me throat is stickin' to me tongue, as if I
had been thryin' to swallow a pitch plaster.  Sowl! it's a shame
av Masther Maurice to make me promise agaynst touchin' the
dhrink&mdash;espacially when it's not goin' to be wanted.  Didn't
he say he wudn't stay more than wan night, whin he come back
heeur; an shure he won't conshume two quarts in wan
night&mdash;unless that owld sinner Stump comes along wid him.
Bad luck to his greedy gut! he gets more av the Manongahayla than
the masther himsilf.</p>

<p>"There's wan consolashun, an thank the Lord for it, we're
goin' back to the owld <i>sad</i>, an the owld place at
Ballyballagh.  Won't I have a skinful when I get thare&mdash;av
the raal stuff too, instid of this Amerikyan rotgut!
Hooch&mdash;hoop&mdash;horoo!  The thought av it's enough to sit
a man mad wid deloight.  Hooch&mdash;hoop&mdash;horoo!"</p>

<p>Tossing his wide-awake up among the rafters, and catching it
as it came down again, the excited Galwegian several times
repeated his ludicrous shibboleth.  Then becoming tranquil he
sate for awhile in silence&mdash;his thoughts dwelling with
pleasant anticipation on the joys that awaited him at
Ballyballagh.</p>

<p>They soon reverted to the objects around him&mdash;more
especially to the demijohn in the corner.  On this once more his
eyes became fixed in a gaze, in which increasing covetousness was
manifestly visible.</p>

<p>"Arrah, me jewel!" said he, again apostrophising the vessel,
"ye're extramely bewtifull to look at&mdash;that same ye arr.
Shure now, yez wudn't till upon me, if I gave yez a thrifle av a
kiss?  Ye wudn't be the thraiter to bethray me?  Wan smack only.
Thare can be no harum in that. Trath, I don't think the masther
'ud mind it&mdash;when he thinks av the throuble I've had wid
this packin', an the dhry dust gettin' down me throat.  Shure he
didn't mane me to kape that promise for this time&mdash; which
differs intirely from all the rest, by razon av our goin' away. A
dhry flittin', they say, makes a short sittin'.  I'll tell the
masther that, whin he comes back; an shure it 'll pacify him.
Besoides, there's another ixcuse.  He's all av tin hours beyant
his time; an I'll say I took a thriflin' dhrap to kape me from
thinkin' long for him.  Shure he won't say a word about it.  Be
Sant Pathrick!  I'll take a smell at the dimmyjan, an trust to
good luck for the rist.  Loy down, Tara, I'm not agoin' out."</p>

<p>The staghound had risen, seeing the speaker step towards the
door.</p>

<p>But the dumb creature had misinterpreted the
purpose&mdash;which was simply to take a survey of the path by
which the jacale was approached, and make sure, that, his master
was not likely to interrupt him in his intended dealings with the
demijohn.</p>

<p>Becoming satisfied that the coast was clear, he glided back
across the floor; uncorked the jar; and, raising it to his lips,
swallowed something more than a "thriflin' dhrap av its
contints."</p>

<p>Then putting it back in its place, he returned to his seat on
the stool.</p>

<p>After remaining quiescent for a considerable time, he once
more proceeded to soliloquise&mdash;now and then changing his
speech to the apostrophic form&mdash;Tara and the demijohn being
the individuals honoured by his discourse.</p>

<p>"In the name av all the angels, an the divils to boot, I
wondher what's kapin' the masther!  He sid he wud be heeur by
eight av the clock in the marnin', and it's now good six in the
afthernoon, if thare's any truth in a Tixas sun.  Shure thare's
somethin' detainin' him?  Don't yez think so, Tara?"</p>

<p>This time Tara did vouchsafe the affirmative
"sniff"&mdash;having poked his nose too far into the ashes.</p>

<p>"Be the powers! then, I hope it's no harum that's befallen
him!  If there has, owld dog, fwhat 'ud become av you an me?
Thare might be no Ballyballagh for miny a month to come; unliss
we cowld pay our passage wid these thraps av the masther's.  The
drinkin' cup&mdash;raal silver it is&mdash;wud cover the whole
expinse av the voyage.  Be japers! now that it stroikes me, I
niver had a dhrink out av that purty little vessel.  I'm shure
the liquor must taste swater that way.  Does it, I
wondher&mdash;trath, now's just the time to thry."</p>

<p>Saying this, he took the cup out of the portmanteau, in which
he had packed it; and, once more uncorking the demijohn, poured
out a portion of its contents&mdash;of about the measure of a
wineglassful.</p>

<p>Quaffing it off at a single gulp, he stood smacking his
lips&mdash;as if to assure himself of the quality of the
liquor.</p>

<p>"Sowl!  I don't know that it <i>does</i> taste betther," said
he, still holding the cup in one hand, and the jar in the other.
"Afther all, I think, it's swater out av the dimmyjan itself,
that is, as far as I cyan remimber.  But it isn't givin' the
gawblet fair play.  It's so long since I had the jar to me mouth,
that I a'most forget how it tasted that way.  I cowld till
betther if I thryed thim thegither.  I'll do that, before I
decoide."</p>

<p>The demijohn was now raised to his lips; and, after several
"glucks" was again taken away.</p>

<p>Then succeeded a second series of smacking, in true
connoisseur fashion, with the head held reflectingly
steadfast.</p>

<p>"Trath! an I'm wrong agane!" said he, accompanying the remark
with another doubtful shake of the head.  "Althegither asthray.
It's swater from the silver.  Or, is it only me imaginayshin
that's desavin' me? It's worth while to make shure, an I can only
do that by tastin' another thrifle out av the cup.  That wud be
givin' fair play to both av the vessels; for I've dhrunk twice
from the jar, an only wanst from the silver.  Fair play's a jewil
all the world over; and thare's no raison why this bewtiful
little mug showldn't be trated as dacently as that big basket av
a jar.  Be japers! but it shall tho'!"</p>

<p>The cup was again called into requisition; and once more a
portion of the contents of the demijohn were transferred to
it&mdash;to be poured immediately after down the insatiable
throat of the unsatisfied connoisseur.</p>

<p>Whether he eventually decided in favour of the cup, or whether
he retained his preference for the jar, is not known.  After the
fourth potation, which was also the final one, he appeared to
think he had tasted sufficiently for the time, and laid both
vessels aside.</p>

<p>Instead of returning to his stool, however, a new idea came
across his mind; which was to go forth from the hut, and see
whether there was any sign to indicate the advent of his
master.</p>

<p>"Come, Tara!" cried he, striding towards the door.  "Let us
stip up to the bluff beyant, and take a look over the big plain.
If masther's comin' at all, he shud be in sight by this.  Come
along, ye owld dog! Masther Maurice 'll think all the betther av
us, for bein' a little unazy about his gettin' back."</p>

<p>Taking the path through the wooded bottom&mdash;with the
staghound close at his heels&mdash;the Galwegian ascended the
bluff, by one of its sloping ravines, and stood upon the edge of
the upper plateau.</p>

<p>From this point he commanded a view of a somewhat sterile
plain; that stretched away eastward, more than a mile, from the
spot where he was standing.</p>

<p>The sun was on his back, low down on the horizon, but shining
from a cloudless sky.  There was nothing to interrupt his view.
Here and there, a stray cactus plant, or a solitary stem of the
arborescent yucca, raised its hirsute form above the level of the
plain.  Otherwise the surface was smooth; and a coyote could not
have crossed it without being seen.</p>

<p>Beyond, in the far distance, could be traced the darker
outline of trees&mdash;where a tract of chapparal, or the wooded
selvedge of a stream stretched transversely across the
<i>llano</i>.</p>

<p>The Galwegian bent his gaze over the ground, in the direction
in which he expected his master should appear; and stood silently
watching for him.</p>

<p>Ere long his vigil was rewarded.  A horseman was seen coming
out from among the trees upon the other side, and heading towards
the Alamo.</p>

<p>He was still more than a mile distant; but, even at that
distance, the faithful servant could identify his master.  The
striped serape of brilliant hues&mdash;a true Navajo blanket,
which Maurice was accustomed to take with him when
travelling&mdash;was not to be mistaken.  It gleamed gaudily
under the glare of the setting sun&mdash;its bands of red, white,
and blue, contrasting with the sombre tints of the sterile
plain.</p>

<p>Phelim only wondered, that his master should have it spread
over his shoulders on such a sultry evening instead of folded up,
and strapped to the cantle of his saddle!</p>

<p>"Trath, Tara! it looks quare, doesn't it?  It's hot enough to
roast a stake upon these stones; an yit the masther don't seem to
think so.  I hope he hasn't caught a cowld from stayin' in that
close crib at owld Duffer's tavern.  It wasn't fit for a pig to
dwill in.  Our own shanty's a splindid parlour to it."</p>

<p>The speaker was for a time silent, watching the movements of
the approaching horseman&mdash;by this time about half a mile
distant, and still drawing nearer.</p>

<p>When his voice was put forth again it was in a tone altogether
changed. It was still that of surprise, with an approach towards
merriment.  But it was mirth that doubted of the ludicrous; and
seemed to struggle under restraint.</p>

<p>"Mother av Moses!" cried he.  "What can the masther mane?  Not
contint with havin' the blankyet upon his showldhers, be japers,
he's got it over his head!</p>

<p>"He's playin' us a thrick, Tara.  He wants to give you an me a
surproise.  He wants to have a joke agaynst us!</p>

<p>"Sowl! but it's quare anyhow.  It looks as if he <i>had</i> no
head.  In faix does it!  Ach! what cyan it mane?  Be the Howly
Virgin! it's enough to frighten wan, av they didn't know it was
the masther!</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> it the masther?  Be the powers, it's too short for
him!  The head? Saint Patrick presarve us, whare is it?  It
cyan't be smothered up in the blankyet?  Thare's no shape thare!
Be Jaysus, thare's somethin' wrong!  What does it mane,
Tara?"</p>

<p>The tone of the speaker had again undergone a change.  It was
now close bordering upon terror&mdash;as was also the expression
of his countenance.</p>

<p>The look and attitude of the staghound were not very
different.  He stood a little in advance&mdash;half cowering,
half inclined to spring forward&mdash;with eyes glaring wildly,
while fixed upon the approaching horseman&mdash;now scarce two
hundred yards from the spot!</p>

<p>As Phelim put the question that terminated his last soliloquy,
the hound gave out a lugubrious howl, that seemed intended for an
answer.</p>

<p>Then, as if urged by some canine instinct, he bounded off
towards the strange object, which puzzled his human companion,
and was equally puzzling him.</p>

<p>Rushing straight on, he gave utterance to a series of shrill
yelps; far different from the soft sonorous baying, with which he
was accustomed to welcome the coming home of the mustanger.</p>

<p>If Phelim was surprised at what he had already seen, he was
still further astonished by what now appeared to him.</p>

<p>As the dog drew near, still yelping as he ran, the blood-
bay&mdash;which the ex-groom had long before identified as his
master's horse&mdash;turned sharply round, and commenced
galloping back across the plain!</p>

<p>While performing the wheel, Phelim saw&mdash;or fancied he
saw&mdash;that, which not only astounded him, but caused the
blood to run chill through his veins, and his frame to tremble to
the very tips of his toes.</p>

<p>It was a head&mdash;that of the man on horseback; but, instead
of being in its proper place, upon his shoulders, it was held in
the rider's hand, just behind the pommel of the saddle!</p>

<p>As the horse turned side towards him, Phelim saw, or fancied
he saw, the face&mdash;ghastly and covered with gore&mdash;half
hidden behind the shaggy hair of the holster!</p>

<p>He saw no more.  In another instant his back was turned
towards the plain; and, in another, he was rushing down the
ravine, as fast as his enfeebled limbs would carry him!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch44"></a>CHAPTER FORTY FOUR.<br>

A QUARTETTE OF COMANCHES.</h2>

<p class="first">
WITH his flame-coloured curls bristling upward&mdash;almost
raising the hat from his head&mdash;the Galwegian continued his
retreat&mdash;pausing not&mdash;scarce looking back, till he had
re-entered the jacale, closed the skin door behind him, and
barricaded it with several large packages that lay near.</p>

<p>Even then he did not feel secure.  What protection could there
be in a shut door, barred and bolted besides, against that which
was not earthly?</p>

<p>And surely what he had seen was not of the earth&mdash;not of
this world! Who on earth had ever witnessed such a
spectacle&mdash;a man mounted upon horseback, and carrying his
head in his hand?  Who had ever heard of a phenomenon so
unnatural?  Certainly not "Phaylim Onale."</p>

<p>His horror still continuing, he rushed to and fro across the
floor of the hut; now dropping down upon the stool, anon rising
up, and gliding to the door; but without daring either to open
it, or look out through the chinks.</p>

<p>At intervals he tore the hair out of his head, striking his
clenched hand against his temples, and roughly rubbing his
eyes&mdash;as if to make sure that he was not asleep, but had
really seen the shape that was horrifying him.</p>

<p>One thing alone gave him a moiety of comfort; though it was of
the slightest.  While retreating down the ravine, before his head
had sunk below the level of the plain, he had given a glance
backward.  He had derived some gratification from that glance; as
it showed the headless rider afar off on the prairie, and with
back turned toward the Alamo, going on at a gallop.</p>

<p>But for the remembrance of this, the Galwegian might have been
still more terrified&mdash;if that were possible&mdash;while
striding back and forth upon the floor of the jacale.</p>

<p>For a long time he was speechless&mdash;not knowing what to
say&mdash;and only giving utterance to such exclamations as came
mechanically to his lips.</p>

<p>As the time passed, and he began to feel, not so much a return
of confidence, as of the power of ratiocination, his tongue
became restored to him; and a continuous fire of questions and
exclamations succeeded. They were all addressed to himself.  Tara
was no longer there, to take part in the conversation.</p>

<p>They were put, moreover, in a low whispered tone, as if in
fear that his voice might be heard outside the jacale.</p>

<p>"Ochone!  Ochone! it cyan't av been him!  Sant Pathrick
protict me, but fwhat was it thin?</p>

<p>"Thare was iverything av his&mdash;the horse&mdash;the
sthriped blankyet&mdash;them spotted wather guards upon his
legs&mdash;an the head itself&mdash;all except the faytures. Thim
I saw too, but wasn't shure about eyedintifycashin; for who kud
till a face all covered over wid rid blood?</p>

<p>"Ach! it cudn't be Masther Maurice at all, at all!</p>

<p>"It's all a dhrame.  I must have been aslape, an dhramin?  Or,
was it the whisky that did it?</p>

<p>"Shure, I wasn't dhrunk enough for that.  Two goes out av the
little cup, an two more from the dimmyjan&mdash;not over a kupple
av naggins in all! That wudn't make me dhrunk.  I've taken twice
that, widout as much as thrippin in my spache.  Trath have I.
Besoides, if I had been the worse for the liquor, why am I not so
still?</p>

<p>"Thare's not half an hour passed since I saw it; an I'm as
sober as a judge upon the binch av magistrates.</p>

<p>"Sowl! a dhrap 'ud do me a power av good just now.  If I don't
take wan, I'll not get a wink av slape.  I'll be shure to kape
awake all the night long thinkin' about it.  Ochone! ochone! what
cyan it be anyhow?  An' where cyan the masther be, if it wasn't
him?  Howly Sant Pathrick! look down an watch over a miserable
sinner, that's lift all alone be himself, wid nothin' but ghosts
an goblins around him!"</p>

<p>After this appeal to the Catholic saint, the Connemara man
addressed himself with still more zealous devotion to the worship
of a very different divinity, known among the ancients as
Bacchus.</p>

<p>His suit in this quarter proved perfectly successful; for in
less than an hour after he had entered upon his genuflexions at
the shrine of the pagan god&mdash;represented by the demijohn of
Monongahela whisky&mdash;he was shrived of all his
sufferings&mdash;if not of his sins&mdash;and lay stretched along
the floor of the jacale, not only oblivious of the spectacle that
had so late terrified him to the very centre of his soul, but
utterly unconscious of his soul's existence.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THERE is no sound within the hut of Maurice the
mustanger&mdash;not even a clock, to tell, by its continuous
ticking, that the hours are passing into eternity, and that
another midnight is mantling over the earth.</p>

<p>There are sounds outside; but only as usual.  The rippling of
the stream close by, the whispering of the leaves stirred by the
night wind, the chirrup of cicadas, the occasional cry of some
wild creature, are but the natural voices of the nocturnal
forest.</p>

<p>Midnight has arrived, with a moon that assimilates it to
morning.  Her light illumines the earth; here and there
penetrating through the shadowy trees, and flinging broad silvery
lists between them.</p>

<p>Passing through these alternations of light and
shadow&mdash;apparently avoiding the former, as much as
possible&mdash;goes a group of mounted men.</p>

<p>Though few in number&mdash;as there are only four of
them&mdash;they are formidable to look upon.  The vermilion
glaring redly over their naked skins, the striped and spotted
tatooing upon their cheeks, the scarlet feathers standing stiffly
upright above their heads, and the gleaming of weapons held in
their hands, all bespeak strength of a savage and dangerous
kind.</p>

<p>Whence come they?</p>

<p>They are in the war costume of the Comanche.  Their paint
proclaims it. There is the skin fillet around the temples, with
the eagle plumes stuck behind it.  The bare breasts and arms; the
buckskin breech-clouts&mdash; everything in the shape of sign by
which these Ishmaelites of Texas may be recognised, when out upon
the <i>maraud</i>.</p>

<p>They must be Comanches: and, therefore, have come from the
west.</p>

<p>Whither go they?</p>

<p>This is a question more easily answered.  They are closing in
upon the hut, where lies the unconscious inebriate.  The jacale
of Maurice Gerald is evidently the <i>butt</i> of their
expedition.</p>

<p>That their intentions are hostile, is to be inferred from the
fact of their wearing the war costume.  It is also apparent from
their manner of making approach.  Still further, by their
dismounting at some distance from the hut, securing their horses
in the underwood, and continuing their advance on foot.</p>

<p>Their stealthy tread&mdash;taking care to plant the foot
lightly upon the fallen leaves&mdash;the precaution to keep
inside the shadow&mdash;the frequent pauses, spent in looking
ahead and listening&mdash;the silent gestures with which these
movements are directed by him who appears to be the leader&mdash;
all proclaim design, to reach the jacale unperceived by whoever
may chance to be inside it.</p>

<p>In this they are successful&mdash;so far as may be judged by
appearances. They stand by the stockade walls, without any sign
being given to show that they have been seen.</p>

<p>The silence inside is complete, as that they are themselves
observing. There is nothing heard&mdash;not so much as the
screech of a hearth-cricket.</p>

<p>And yet the hut is inhabited.  But a man may get drunk beyond
the power of speech, snoring, or even audibly breathing; and in
this condition is the tenant of the jacale.</p>

<p>The four Comanches steal up to the door; and in skulking
attitudes scrutinise it.</p>

<p>It is shut; but there are chinks at the sides.  To these the
savages set their ears&mdash;all at the same time&mdash;and stand
silently listening.</p>

<p>No snoring, no breathing, no noise of any kind!</p>

<p>"It is possible," says their chief to the follower nearest
him&mdash;speaking in a whisper, but in good grammatical
Castilian, "just possible he has not yet got home; though by the
time of his starting he should have reached here long before
this.  He may have ridden out again?  Now I remember: there's a
horse-shed at the back.  If the man be inside the house, the
beast should be found in the shed.  Stay here, <i>camarados</i>,
till I go round and see."</p>

<p>Six seconds suffice to examine the substitute for a stable. No
horse in it.</p>

<p>As many more are spent in scrutinising the path that leads to
it.  No horse has been there&mdash;at least not lately.</p>

<p>These points determined, the chief returns to his
followers&mdash;still standing by the doorway in front.</p>

<p>"<i>Maldito</i>!" he exclaims, giving freer scope to his
voice, "he's <i>not</i> here, nor has he been this day."</p>

<p>"We had better go inside, and make sure?" suggests one of the
common warriors, in Spanish fairly pronounced.  "There can be no
harm in our seeing how the <i>Irlandes</i> has housed himself out
here?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" answers a third, equally well versed in the
language of Cervantes.  "Let's have a look at his larder too. I'm
hungry enough to eat raw tasajo."</p>

<p>"<i>Por Dios</i>!" adds the fourth and last of the quartette,
in the same sonorous tongue.  "I've heard that he keeps a cellar.
If so&mdash;"</p>

<p>The chief does not wait for his follower to finish the
hypothetical speech.  The thought of a cellar appears to produce
a powerful effect upon him&mdash;stimulating to immediate
action.</p>

<p>He sets his heel upon the skin door, with the intention of
pushing it open.</p>

<p>It resists the effort.</p>

<p>"<i>Carrambo</i>! it's barred inside!  Done to keep out
intruders in his absence!  Lions, tigers, bears,
buffaloes&mdash;perhaps Indians.  Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>Another kick is given with greater force.  The door still
keeps its place.</p>

<p>"Barricaded with something&mdash;something heavy too.  It
won't yield to kicking.  No matter.  I'll soon see what's
inside."</p>

<p>The machete is drawn from its sheath; and a large hole cut
through the stretched skin, that covers the light framework of
wood.</p>

<p>Into this the Indian thrusts his arm; and groping about,
discovers the nature of the obstruction.</p>

<p>The packages are soon displaced, and the door thrown open.</p>

<p>The savages enter, preceded by a broad moonbeam, that lights
them on their way, and enables them to observe the condition of
the interior.</p>

<p>A man lying in the middle of the floor!</p>

<p>"<i>Carajo</i>!"</p>

<p>"Is he asleep?"</p>

<p>"He must be dead not to have heard us?"</p>

<p>"Neither," says the chief, after stooping to examine him,
"only dead drunk&mdash;<i>boracho&mdash;embriaguado</i>!  He's
the servitor of the Irlandes.  I've seen this fellow before. From
his manner one may safely conclude, that his master is not at
home, nor has been lately.  I hope the brute hasn't used up the
cellar in getting himself into this comfortable condition. Ah! a
jar.  And smelling like a rose!  There's a rattle among these
rods.  There's stuff inside.  Thank the Lady Guadaloupe for
this!"</p>

<p>A few seconds suffice for distributing what remains of the
contents of the demijohn.  There is enough to give each of the
four a drink, with two to their chief; who, notwithstanding his
high rank, has not the superior politeness to protest against
this unequal distribution.  In a trice the jar is empty.  What
next?</p>

<p>The master of the house must come home, some time or other. An
interview with him is desired by the men, who have made a call
upon him&mdash;particularly desired, as may be told by the
unseasonable hour of their visit.  The chief is especially
anxious to see him.</p>

<p>What can four Comanche Indians want with Maurice the
mustanger?</p>

<p>Their talk discloses their intentions: for among themselves
they make no secret of their object in being there.</p>

<p><i>They have come to murder him</i>!</p>

<p>Their chief is the instigator; the others are only his
instruments and assistants.</p>

<p>The business is too important to permit of his trifling.  He
will gain a thousand dollars by the deed&mdash;besides a certain
gratification independent of the money motive.  His three braves
will earn a hundred each&mdash;a sum sufficient to tempt the
cupidity of a Comanche, and purchase him for any purpose.</p>

<p>The travesty need not be carried any further.  By this time
the mask must have fallen off.  Our Comanches are mere Mexicans;
their chief, Miguel Diaz, the mustanger.</p>

<p>"We must lie in wait for him."</p>

<p>This is the counsel of El Coyote.</p>

<p>"He cannot be much longer now, whatever may have detained him.
You, Barajo, go up to the bluff, and keep a look-out over the
plain.  The rest remain here with me.  He must come that way from
the Leona.  We can meet him at the bottom of the gorge under the
big cypress tree.  'Tis the best place for our purpose."</p>

<p>"Had we not better silence <i>him</i>?" hints the bloodthirsty
Barajo, pointing to the Galwegian&mdash;fortunately unconscious
of what is transpiring around him.</p>

<p>"Dead men tell no tales!" adds another of the conspirators,
repeating the proverb in its original language.</p>

<p>"It would tell a worse tale were we to kill him," rejoins
Diaz. "Besides, it's of no use.  He's silent enough as it is, the
droll devil. Let the dog have his day.  I've only bargained for
the life of his master.  Come, Barajo!  <i>Vayate! vayate</i>! Up
to the cliff.  We can't tell the moment Don Mauricio may drop in
upon us.  A miscarriage must not be made.  We may never have such
a chance again.  Take your stand at the top of the gorge. From
that point you have a view of the whole plain.  He cannot come
near without your seeing him, in such a moonlight as this. As
soon as you've set eyes on him, hasten down and let us know. Be
sure you give us time to get under the cypress."</p>

<p>Barajo is proceeding to yield obedience to this chapter of
instructions, but with evident reluctance.  He has, the night
before, been in ill luck, having lost to El Coyote a large sum at
the game of <i>monte</i>.  He is desirous of having his
<i>revanche</i>: for he well knows how his <i>confreres</i> will
spend the time in his absence.</p>

<p>"Quick.  Señor Vicente!" commands Diaz, observing his dislike
to the duty imposed upon him; "if we fail in this business, you
will lose more than you can gain at an <i>albur</i> of monte. Go,
man!" continues El Coyote, in an encouraging way.  "If he come
not within the hour, some one will relieve you.  Go!"</p>

<p>Barajo obeys, and, stepping out of the jacale, proceeds to his
post upon the top of the cliff.</p>

<p>The others seat themselves inside the hut&mdash;having already
established a light.</p>

<p>Men of their class and calling generally go provided with the
means of killing time, or, at all events, hindering it from
hanging on their hands.</p>

<p>The slab table is between them, upon which is soon displayed,
not their supper, but a pack of Spanish cards, which every
Mexican <i>vagabondo</i> carries under his serape.</p>

<p><i>Cavallo</i> and <i>soto</i> (queen and knave) are laid face
upward; a monte table is established; the cards are shuffled; and
the play proceeds.</p>

<p>Absorbed in calculating the chances of the game, an hour
passes without note being taken of the time.</p>

<p>El Coyote is banker, and also croupier.</p>

<p>The cries "<i>Cavallo en la puerta</i>!" "<i>Soto mozo</i>!"
"The queen in the gate!"  "The knave winner!"&mdash;at intervals
announced in set phrase&mdash;echo from the skin-covered
walls.</p>

<p>The silver dollars are raked along the rough table, their
sharp chink contrasting with the soft shuffle of the cards.</p>

<p>All at once a more stentorous sound interrupts the play,
causing a cessation of the game.</p>

<p>It is the screech of the inebriate, who, awaking from his
trance of intoxication, perceives for the first time the queer
company that share with him the shelter of the jacale.</p>

<p>The players spring to their feet, and draw their machetes.
Phelim stands a fair chance of being skewered on three long
Toledos.</p>

<p>He is only saved by a contingency&mdash;another interruption
that has the effect of staying the intent.</p>

<p>Barajo appears in the doorway panting for breath.</p>

<p>It is scarce necessary for him to announce his errand, though
he contrives to gasp out&mdash;</p>

<p>"He is <i>coming</i>&mdash;on the bluff already&mdash;at the
head of the <i>canada</i>&mdash; quick, comrades, quick!"</p>

<p>The Galwegian is saved.  There is scarce time to kill
him&mdash;even were it worth while.</p>

<p>But it is not&mdash;at least so think the masqueraders; who
leave him to resume his disturbed slumber, and rush forth to
accomplish the more profitable assassination.</p>

<p>In a score of seconds they are under the cliff, at the bottom
of the sloping gorge by which it must be descended.</p>

<p>They take stand under the branches of a spreading cypress; and
await the approach of their victim.</p>

<p>They listen for the hoofstrokes that should announce it.</p>

<p>These are soon heard.  There is the clinking of a shod
hoof&mdash;not in regular strokes, but as if a horse was passing
over an uneven surface. One is descending the slope!</p>

<p>He is not yet visible to the eyes of the ambuscaders.  Even
the gorge is in gloom&mdash;like the valley below, shadowed by
tall trees.</p>

<p>There is but one spot where the moon throws light upon the
turf&mdash;a narrow space outside the sombre shadow that conceals
the assassins. Unfortunately this does not lie in the path of
their intended victim. He must pass under the canopy of the
cypress!</p>

<p>"Don't kill him!" mutters Miguel Diaz to his men, speaking in
an earnest tone.  "There's no need for that just yet.  I want to
have him alive&mdash; for the matter of an hour or so.  I have my
reasons.  Lay hold of him and his horse.  There can be no danger,
as he will be taken by surprise, and unprepared.  If there be
resistance, we must shoot him down; but let me fire first."</p>

<p>The confederates promise compliance.</p>

<p>They have soon an opportunity of proving the sincerity of
their promise. He for whom they are waiting has accomplished the
descent of the slope, and is passing under the shadow of the
cypress.</p>

<p>"<i>Abajo las armas!  A tierra</i>!"  ("Down with your
weapons.  To the ground!") cries El Coyote, rushing forward and
seizing the bridle, while the other three fling themselves upon
the man who is seated in the saddle.</p>

<p>There is no resistance, either by struggle or blow; no blade
drawn; no shot discharged: not even a word spoken in protest!</p>

<p>They see a man standing upright in the stirrups; they lay
their hands upon limbs that feel solid flesh and bone, and yet
seem insensible to the touch!</p>

<p>The horse alone shows resistance.  He rears upon his hind
legs, makes ground backward, and draws his captors after him.</p>

<p>He carries them into the light, where the moon is shining
outside the shadow.</p>

<p>Merciful heaven! what does it mean?</p>

<p>His captors let go their hold, and fall back with a
simultaneous shout. It is a scream of wild terror!</p>

<p>Not another instant do they stay under the cypress; but
commence retreating at top speed towards the thicket where their
own steeds have been left tied.</p>

<p>Mounting in mad haste, they ride rapidly away.</p>

<p>They have seen that which has already stricken terror into
hearts more courageous than theirs&mdash;<i>a horseman without a
head</i>!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch45"></a>CHAPTER FORTY FIVE.<br>

A TRAIL GONE BLIND.</h2>

<p class="first">
WAS it a phantom?  Surely it could not be human?</p>

<p>So questioned El Coyote and his terrified companions.  So,
too, had the scared Galwegian interrogated himself, until his
mind, clouded by repeated appeals to the demijohn, became
temporarily relieved of the terror.</p>

<p>In a similar strain had run the thoughts of more than a
hundred others, to whom the headless horseman had shown
himself&mdash;the party of searchers who accompanied the
major.</p>

<p>It was at an earlier hour, and a point in the prairie five
miles farther east, that to these the weird figure had made
itself manifest.</p>

<p>Looking westward, with the sun-glare in their eyes, they had
seen only its shape, and nothing more&mdash;at least nothing to
connect it with Maurice the mustanger.</p>

<p>Viewing it from the west, with the sun at his back, the
Galwegian had seen enough to make out a resemblance to his
master&mdash;if not an absolute identification.</p>

<p>Under the light of the moon the four Mexicans, who knew
Maurice Gerald by sight, had arrived at a similar conclusion.</p>

<p>If the impression made upon the servant was one of the wildest
awe, equally had it stricken the conspirators.</p>

<p>The searchers, though less frightened by the strange
phenomenon, were none the less puzzled to explain it.</p>

<p>Up to the instant of its disappearance no explanation had been
attempted&mdash;save that jocularly conveyed in the bizarre
speech of the borderer.</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you make of it, gentlemen?" said the major,
addressing those that had clustered around him: "I confess it
mystifies me."</p>

<p>"An Indian trick?" suggested one.  "Some decoy to draw us into
an ambuscade?"</p>

<p>"A most unlikely lure, then;" remarked another; "certainly the
last that would attract me."</p>

<p>"I don't think it's Indian," said the major; "I don't know
what to think.  What's your opinion of it, Spangler?"</p>

<p>The tracker shook his head, as if equally uncertain.</p>

<p>"Do you think it's an Indian in disguise?" urged the officer,
pressing him for an answer.</p>

<p>"I know no more than yourself, major," replied he.  "It
<i>should</i> be somethin' of that kind: for what else <i>can</i>
it be?  It must eyther be a man, or a dummy!"</p>

<p>"That's it&mdash;a dummy!" cried several, evidently relieved
by his hypothesis.</p>

<p>"Whatsomever it is&mdash;man, dummy, or devil," said the
frontiersman, who had already pronounced upon it, "thar's no
reason why we should be frightened from followin' its trail.  Has
it left any, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"If it has," replied Spangler, "we'll soon see.  Ours goes the
same way&mdash;so fur as can be judged from here.  Shall we move
forr'ad, major?"</p>

<p>"By all means.  We must not be turned from our purpose by a
trifle like that.  Forward!"</p>

<p>The horsemen again advanced&mdash;some of them not without a
show of reluctance.  There were among them men, who, if left to
themselves, would have taken the back track.  Of this number was
Calhoun, who, from the first moment of sighting the strange
apparition, had shown signs of affright even beyond the rest of
his companions.  His eyes had suddenly assumed an unnatural
glassiness; his lips were white as ashes; while his drooping jaw
laid bare two rows of teeth, which he appeared with difficulty to
restrain from chattering!</p>

<p>But for the universal confusion, his wild manner might have
been observed.  So long as the singular form was in sight, there
were eyes only for it; and when it had at length disappeared, and
the party advanced along the trail, the ex-captain hung back,
riding unobserved among the rearmost.</p>

<p>The tracker had guessed aright.  The spot upon which the
ghostly shape had for the moment stood still, lay direct upon the
trail they were already taking up.</p>

<p>But, as if to prove the apparition a spirit, on reaching the
place there were no tracks to be seen!</p>

<p>The explanation, however, was altogether natural.  Where the
horse had wheeled round, and for miles beyond, the plain was
thickly strewn with white shingle.  It was, in trapper parlance,
a "chalk prairie."  The stones showed displacement; and here and
there an abrasion that appeared to have been made by the hoof of
a horse.  But these marks were scarce discernible, and only to
the eyes of the skilled tracker.</p>

<p>It was the case with the trail they had been taking
up&mdash;that of the shod mustang; and as the surface had lately
been disturbed by a wild herd, the particular hoof-marks could no
longer be distinguished.</p>

<p>They might have gone further in the direction taken by the
headless rider.  The sun would have been their guide, and after
that the evening star.  But it was the rider of the shod mustang
they were desirous to overtake; and the half hour of daylight
that followed was spent in fruitless search for his
trail&mdash;gone blind among the shingle.</p>

<p>Spangler proclaimed himself at fault, as the sun disappeared
over the horizon.</p>

<p>They had no alternative but to ride back to the chapparal, and
bivouac among the bushes.</p>

<p>The intention was to make a fresh trial for the recovery of
the trail, at the earliest hour of the morning.</p>

<p>It was not fulfilled, at least as regarded time.  The trial
was postponed by an unexpected circumstance.</p>

<p>Scarce had they formed camp, when a courier arrived, bringing
a despatch for the major.  It was from the commanding officer of
the district, whose head-quarters were at San Antonio do Bexar.
It had been sent to Fort Inge, and thence forwarded.</p>

<p>The major made known its tenor by ordering "boots and saddles"
to be sounded; and before the sweat had become dry upon the
horses, the dragoons were once more upon their backs.</p>

<p>The despatch had conveyed the intelligence, that the Comanches
were committing outrage, not upon the Leona, but fifty miles
farther to the eastward, close to the town of San Antonio
itself.</p>

<p>It was no longer a mere rumour.  The maraud had commenced by
the murder of men, women, and children, with the firing of their
houses.</p>

<p>The major was commanded to lose no time, but bring what troops
he could spare to the scene of operations.  Hence his hurried
decampment.</p>

<p>The civilians might have stayed; but friendship&mdash;even
parental affection&mdash;must yield to the necessities of nature.
Most of them had set forth without further preparation than the
saddling of their horses, and shouldering their guns; and hunger
now called them home.</p>

<p>There was no intention to abandon the search.  That was to be
resumed as soon as they could change horses, and establish a
better system of commissariat.  Then would it be
continued&mdash;as one and all declared, to the "bitter end."</p>

<p>A small party was left with Spangler to take up the trail of
the American horse, which according to the tracker's forecast
would lead back to the Leona.  The rest returned along with the
dragoons.</p>

<p>Before parting with Poindexter and his friends, the major made
known to them&mdash;what he had hitherto kept back&mdash;the
facts relating to the bloody sign, and the tracker's
interpretation of it.  As he was no longer to take part in the
search, he thought it better to communicate to those who should,
a circumstance so important.</p>

<p>It pained him to direct suspicion upon the young Irishman,
with whom in the way of his calling he had held some pleasant
intercourse.  But duty was paramount; and, notwithstanding his
disbelief in the mustanger's guilt, or rather his belief in its
improbability, he could not help acknowledging that appearances
were against him.</p>

<p>With the planter and his party it was no longer a suspicion.
Now that the question of Indians was disposed of, men boldly
proclaimed Maurice Gerald a murderer.</p>

<p>That the deed had been done no one thought of doubting.</p>

<p>Oberdoffer's story had furnished the first chapter of the
evidence. Henry's horse returning with the blood-stained saddle
the last.  The intermediate links were readily
supplied&mdash;partly by the interpretations of the tracker, and
partly by conjecture.</p>

<p>No one paused to investigate the motive&mdash;at least with
any degree of closeness.  The hostility of Gerald was accounted
for by his quarrel with Calhoun; on the supposition that it might
have extended to the whole family of the Poindexters!</p>

<p>It was very absurd reasoning; but men upon the track of a
supposed murderer rarely reason at all.  They think only of
destroying him.</p>

<p>With this thought did they separate; intending to start afresh
on the following morning, throw themselves once more upon the
trail of the two men who were missing, and follow it up, till one
or both should be found&mdash;one or both, living or dead.</p>

<p>The party left with Spangler remained upon the spot which the
major had chosen as a camping ground.</p>

<p>They were in all less than a dozen.  A larger number was
deemed unnecessary.  Comanches, in that quarter, were no longer
to be looked for; nor was there any other danger that called for
a strength of men. Two or three would have been sufficient for
the duty required of them.</p>

<p>Nine or ten stayed&mdash;some out of curiosity, others for the
sake of companionship.  They were chiefly young men&mdash;sons of
planters and the like.  Calhoun was among them&mdash;the
acknowledged chief of the party; though Spangler, acting as
guide, was tacitly understood to be the man to whom obedience
should be given.</p>

<p>Instead of going to sleep, after the others had ridden away,
they gathered around a roaring fire, already kindled within the
thicket glade.</p>

<p>Among them was no stint for supper&mdash;either of eatables or
drinkables. The many who had gone back&mdash;knowing they would
not need them&mdash;had surrendered their haversacks, and the
"heel-taps" of their canteens, to the few who remained.  There
was liquor enough to last through the night&mdash;even if spent
in continuous carousing.</p>

<p>Despite their knowledge of this&mdash;despite the cheerful
crackling of the logs, as they took their seats around the
fire&mdash;they were not in high spirits.</p>

<p>One and all appeared to be under some influence, that, like a
spell, prevented them from enjoying a pleasure perhaps not
surpassed upon earth.</p>

<p>You may talk of the tranquil joys of the domestic hearth.  At
times, upon the prairie, I have myself thought of, and longed to
return to them.  But now, looking back upon both, and calmly
comparing them, one with the other, I cannot help exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Give me the circle of the camp-fire, with half-a-dozen of my
hunter comrades around it&mdash;once again give me that, and be
welcome to the wealth I have accumulated, and the trivial honours
I have gained&mdash;thrice welcome to the care and the toil that
must still be exerted in retaining them."</p>

<p>The sombre abstraction of their spirits was easily explained.
The weird shape was fresh in their thoughts.  They were yet under
the influence of an indefinable awe.</p>

<p>Account for the apparition as they best could, and laugh at
it&mdash;as they at intervals affected to do&mdash;they could not
clear their minds of this unaccountable incubus, nor feel
satisfied with any explanation that had been offered.</p>

<p>The guide Spangler partook of the general sentiment, as did
their leader Calhoun.</p>

<p>The latter appeared more affected by it than any of the party!
Seated, with moody brow, under the shadow of the trees, at some
distance from the fire, he had not spoken a word since the
departure of the dragoons. Nor did he seem disposed to join the
circle of those who were basking in the blaze; but kept himself
apart, as if not caring to come under the scrutiny of his
companions.</p>

<p>There was still the same wild look in his eyes&mdash;the same
scared expression upon his features&mdash;that had shown itself
before sunset.</p>

<p>"I say, Cash Calhoun!" cried one of the young fellows by the
fire, who was beginning to talk "tall," under the influence of
the oft-repeated potations&mdash;"come up, old fellow, and join
us in a drink!  We all respect your sorrow; and will do what we
can to get satisfaction, for you and yours.  But a man mustn't
always mope, as you're doing.  Come along here, and take a
'smile' of the Monongaheela!  It'll do you a power of good, I
promise you."</p>

<p>Whether it was that he was pleased at the interpretation put
upon his silent attitude&mdash;which the speech told him had been
observed&mdash;or whether he had become suddenly inclined towards
a feeling of good fellowship, Calhoun accepted the invitation;
and stepping up to the fire, fell into line with the rest of the
roysterers.  Before seating himself, he took a pull at the
proffered flask.</p>

<p>From that moment his air changed, as if by enchantment.
Instead of showing sombre, he became eminently hilarious&mdash;so
much so as to cause surprise to more than one of the party.  The
behaviour seemed odd for a man, whose cousin was supposed to have
been murdered that very morning.</p>

<p>Though commencing in the character of an invited guest, he
soon exhibited himself as the host of the occasion.  After the
others had emptied their respective flasks, he proved himself
possessed of a supply that seemed inexhaustible.  Canteen after
canteen came forth, from his capacious saddle-bags&mdash;the
legacy left by many departed friends, who had gone back with the
major.</p>

<p>Partaking of these at the invitation of their
leader&mdash;encouraged by his example&mdash;the young planter
"bloods" who encircled the camp fire, talked, sang, danced,
roared, and even rolled around it, until the alcohol could no
longer keep them awake.  Then, yielding to exhausted nature, they
sank back upon the sward, some perhaps to experience the dread
slumber of a first intoxication.</p>

<p>The ex-officer of volunteers was the last of the number who
laid himself along the grass.</p>

<p>If the last to lie down, he was the first to get up.  Scarce
had the carousal ceased&mdash;scarce had the sonorous breathing
of his companions proclaimed them asleep&mdash;when he rose into
an erect attitude, and with cautious steps stole out from among
them.  With like stealthy tread he kept on to the confines of the
camp&mdash;to the spot where his horse stood "hitched" to a
tree.</p>

<p>Releasing the rein from its knot, and throwing it over the
neck of the animal, he clambered into the saddle, and rode
noiselessly away.</p>

<p>In all these actions there was no evidence that he was
intoxicated.  On the contrary, they proclaimed a clear brain,
bent upon some purpose previously determined.  What could it
be?</p>

<p>Urged by affection, was he going forth to trace the mystery of
the murder, by finding the body of the murdered man?  Did he wish
to show his zeal by going alone?</p>

<p>Some such design might have been interpreted from a series of
speeches that fell carelessly from his lips, as he rode through
the chapparal.</p>

<p>"Thank God, there's a clear moon, and six good hours before
those youngsters will think of getting to their feet!  I'll have
time to search every corner of the thicket, for a couple of miles
around the place; and if the body be there I cannot fail to find
it.  But what could that thing have meant?  If I'd been the only
one to see it, I might have believed myself mad.  But they all
saw it&mdash;every one of them. Almighty heavens! what could it
have been?"</p>

<p>The closing speech ended in an exclamation of terrified
surprise&mdash; elicited by a spectacle that at the moment
presented itself to the eyes of the ex-officer&mdash;causing him
to rein up his horse, as if some dread danger was before him.</p>

<p>Coming in by a side path, he had arrived on the edge of the
opening already described.  He was just turning into it, when he
saw, that he was not the only horseman, who at that late hour was
traversing the chapparal.</p>

<p>Another, to all appearance as well mounted as himself, was
approaching along the avenue&mdash;not slowly as he, but in a
quick trot.</p>

<p>Long before the strange rider had come near, the moonlight,
shining fall upon him, enabled Calhoun to see that he was
<i>headless</i>!</p>

<p>There could be no mistake about the observation.  Though
quickly made, it was complete.  The white moon beams, silvering
his shoulders, were reflected from no face, above or between
them!  It could be no illusion of the moon's light.  Calhoun had
seen that same shape under the glare of the sun.</p>

<p>He now saw more&mdash;the missing head, ghastly and gory, half
shrouded behind the hairy holsters!  More still&mdash;he
recognised the horse&mdash;the striped serape upon the shoulders
of the rider&mdash;the water-guards upon his legs&mdash;the
complete caparison&mdash;all the belongings of Maurice the
mustanger!</p>

<p>He had ample time to take in these details.  At a stand in the
embouchure of the side path, terror held him transfixed to the
spot. His horse appeared to share the feeling.  Trembling in its
tracks, the animal made no effort to escape; even when the
headless rider pulled up in front, and, with a snorting, rearing
steed, remained for a moment confronting the frightened
party.</p>

<p>It was only after the blood bay had given utterance to a wild
"whigher"&mdash;responded to by the howl of a hound close
following at his heels&mdash;and turned into the avenue to
continue his interrupted trot&mdash;only then that Calhoun became
sufficiently released from the spell of horror to find
speech.</p>

<p>"God of heaven!" he cried, in a quivering voice, "what can it
mean?  Is it man, or demon, that mocks me?  Has the whole day
been a dream?  Or am I mad&mdash;mad&mdash;mad?"</p>

<p>The scarce coherent speech was succeeded by action,
instantaneous but determined.  Whatever the purpose of his
exploration, it was evidently abandoned: for, turning his horse
with a wrench upon the rein, he rode back by the way he had
come&mdash;only at a far faster pace,&mdash;pausing not till he
had re-entered the encampment.</p>

<p>Then stealing up to the edge of the fire, he lay down among
the slumbering inebriates&mdash;not to sleep, but to stay
trembling in their midst, till daylight disclosed a haggard
pallor upon his cheeks, and ghastly glances sent forth from his
sunken eyes.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch46"></a>CHAPTER FORTY SIX.<br>

A SECRET CONFIDED.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE first dawn of day witnessed an unusual stir in and around
the hacienda of Casa del Corvo.  The courtyard was crowded with
men&mdash;armed, though not in the regular fashion.  They carried
long hunting rifles, having a calibre of sixty to the pound;
double-barrelled shot guns; single-barrelled pistols; revolvers;
knives with long blades; and even tomahawks!</p>

<p>In their varied attire of red flannel shirts, coats of
coloured blanket, and "Kentucky jeans," trowsers of brown
"homespun," and blue "cottonade," hats of felt and caps of skin,
tall boots of tanned leather, and leggings of buck&mdash;these
stalwart men furnished a faithful picture of an assemblage, such
as may be often seen in the frontier settlements of Texas.</p>

<p>Despite the <i>bizarrerie</i> of their appearance, and the
fact of their carrying weapons, there was nothing in either to
proclaim their object in thus coming together.  Had it been for
the most pacific purpose, they would have been armed and
apparelled just the same.</p>

<p>But their object is known.</p>

<p>A number of the men so met, had been out on the day before,
along with the dragoons.  Others had now joined the
assemblage&mdash;settlers who lived farther away, and hunters who
had been from home.</p>

<p>The muster on this morning was greater than on the preceding
day&mdash;even exceeding the strength of the searching party when
supplemented by the soldiers.</p>

<p>Though all were civilians, there was one portion of the
assembled crowd that could boast of an organisation.  Irregular
it may be deemed, notwithstanding the name by which its members
were distinguished.  These were the "<i>Regulators</i>."</p>

<p>There was nothing distinctive about them, either in their
dress, arms, or equipments.  A stranger would not have known a
Regulator from any other individual.  They knew one another.</p>

<p>Their talk was of murder&mdash;of the murder of Henry
Poindexter&mdash;coupled with the name of Maurice the
mustanger.</p>

<p>Another subject was discussed of a somewhat cognate character.
Those who had seen it, were telling those who had not&mdash;of
the strange spectacle that had appeared to them the evening
before on the prairie.</p>

<p>Some were at first incredulous, and treated the thing as a
joke.  But the wholesale testimony&mdash;and the serious manner
in which it was given&mdash; could not long be resisted; and the
existence of the <i>headless horseman</i> became a universal
belief.  Of course there was an attempt to account for the odd
phenomenon, and many forms of explanation were suggested. The
only one, that seemed to give even the semblance of satisfaction,
was that already set forward by the frontiersman&mdash;that the
horse was real enough, but the rider was a counterfeit.</p>

<p>For what purpose such a trick should be contrived, or who
should be its contriver, no one pretended to explain.</p>

<p>For the business that had brought them togther, there was but
little time wasted in preparation.  All were prepared
already.</p>

<p>Their horses were outside&mdash;some of them held in hand by
the servants of the establishment, but most "hitched" to whatever
would hold them.</p>

<p>They had come warned of their work, and only waited for
Woodley Poindexter&mdash;on this occasion their chief&mdash;to
give the signal for setting forth.</p>

<p>He only waited in the hope of procuring a guide; one who could
conduct them to the Alamo&mdash;who could take them to the
domicile of Maurice the mustanger.</p>

<p>There was no such person present.  Planters, merchants,
shopkeepers, lawyers, hunters, horse and slave-dealers, were all
alike ignorant of the Alamo.</p>

<p>There was but one man belonging to the settlement supposed to
be capable of performing the required service&mdash;old Zeb
Stump.  But Zeb could not be found.  He was absent on one of his
stalking expeditions; and the messengers sent to summon him were
returning, one after another, to announce a bootless errand.</p>

<p>There was a <i>woman</i>, in the hacienda itself, who could
have guided the searchers upon their track&mdash;to the very
hearthstone of the supposed assassin.</p>

<p>Woodley Poindexter knew it not; and perhaps well for him it
was so.  Had the proud planter suspected that in the person of
his own child, there was a guide who could have conducted kim to
the lone hut on the Alamo, his sorrow for a lost son would have
been stifled by anguish for an erring daughter.</p>

<p>The last messenger sent in search of Stump came back to the
hacienda without him.  The thirst for vengeance could be no
longer stayed, and the avengers went forth.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THEY were scarce out of sight of Casa del Corvo,
when the two individuals, who could have done them such signal
service, became engaged in conversation within the walls of the
hacienda itself.</p>

<p>There was nothing clandestine in the meeting, nothing
designed.  It was a simple contingency, Zeb Stump having just
come in from his stalking excursion, bringing to the hacienda a
portion of the "plunder"&mdash;as he was wont to term
it&mdash;procured by his unerring rifle.</p>

<p>Of course to Zeb Stump, Louise Poindexter was at home.  She
was even eager for the interview&mdash;so eager, as to have kep
almost a continual watch along the river road, all the day
before, from the rising to the setting of the sun.</p>

<p>Her vigil, resumed on the departure of the noisy crowd, was
soon after rewarded by the sight of the hunter, mounted on his
old mare&mdash;the latter laden with the spoils of the
chase&mdash;slowly moving along the road on the opposite side of
the river, and manifestly making for the hacienda.</p>

<p>A glad sight to her&mdash;that rude, but grand shape of
colossal manhood. She recognised in it the form of a true
friend&mdash;to whose keeping she could safely entrust her most
secret confidence.  And she had now such a secret to confide to
him; that for a night and a day had been painfully pent up within
her bosom.</p>

<p>Long before Zeb had set foot upon the flagged pavement of the
patio, she had gone out into the verandah to receive him.</p>

<p>The air of smiling nonchalance with which he approached,
proclaimed him still ignorant of the event which had cast its
melancholy shadow over the house.  There was just perceptible the
slightest expression of surprise, at finding the outer gate shut,
chained, and barred.</p>

<p>It had not been the custom of the hacienda&mdash;at least
during its present proprietary.</p>

<p>The sombre countenance of the black, encountered within the
shadow of the saguan, strengthened Zeb's
surprise&mdash;sufficiently to call forth an inquiry.</p>

<p>"Why, Pluto, ole fellur! whatsomdiver air the matter wi' ye?
Yur lookin' like a 'coon wi' his tail chopped off&mdash;clost to
the stump at thet!  An' why air the big gate shet an
barred&mdash;in the middle o' breakfist time?  I hope thur hain't
nuthin' gone astray?"</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!  Mass 'Tump, dat's jess what dar hab goed
stray&mdash;dat's preecise de ting, dis chile sorry t'
say&mdash;berry much goed stray.  Ho! berry, berry much!"</p>

<p>"Heigh!" exclaimed the hunter, startled at the lugubrious
tone.  "Thur air sommeat amiss?  What is't, nigger?  Tell me
sharp quick.  It can't be no wuss than yur face shows it. Nothin'
happened to yur young mistress, I hope?  Miss Lewaze&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ho&mdash;ho! nuffin' happen to de young Missa Looey.
Ho&mdash;ho!  Bad enuf 'thout dat.  Ho! de young missa inside de
house yar, 'Tep in, Mass' 'Tump.  She tell you de drefful news
herseff."</p>

<p>"Ain't yur master inside, too?  He's at home, ain't he?"</p>

<p>"Golly, no.  Dis time no.  Massa ain't 'bout de house at all
nowhar.  He wa' hya a'most a quarrer ob an hour ago.  He no hya
now.  He off to de hoss prairas&mdash;wha de hab de big hunt
'bout a momf ago.  You know, Mass' Zeb?"</p>

<p>"The hoss purayras!  What's tuk him thur?  Who's along wi'
him?"</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! dar's Mass Cahoon, and gobs o' odder white genlum.
Ho! ho! Dar's a mighty big crowd ob dem, dis nigga tell you."</p>

<p>"An' yur young Master Henry&mdash;air he gone too?"</p>

<p>"O Mass' 'Tump!  Dat's wha am be trubble.  Dat's de whole ob
it.  Mass' Hen' he gone too.  He nebber mo' come back.  De hoss
he been brought home all kibbered over wif blood.  Ho! ho! de
folks say Massa Henry he gone dead."</p>

<p>"Dead!  Yur jokin'?  Air ye in airnest, nigger?"</p>

<p>"Oh!  I is, Mass' 'Tump.  Sorry dis chile am to hab say dat am
too troo. Dey all gone to sarch atter de body."</p>

<p>"Hyur!  Take these things to the kitchen.  Thur's a gobbler,
an some purayra chickens.  Whar kin I find Miss Lewaze?"</p>

<p>"Here, Mr Stump.  Come this way!" replied a sweet voice well
known to him, but now speaking in accents so sad he would scarce
have recognised it.</p>

<p>"Alas! it is too true what Pluto has been telling you.  My
brother is missing.  He has not been seen since the night before
last.  His horse came home, with spots of blood upon the saddle.
O Zeb! it's fearful to think of it!"</p>

<p>"Sure enuf that <i>air</i> ugly news.  He rud out somewhar,
and the hoss kim back 'ithout him?  I don't weesh to gie ye
unneedcessary pain, Miss Lewaze; but, as they air still sarchin'
I mout be some help at that ere bizness; and maybe ye won't mind
tellin' me the particklers?"</p>

<p>These were imparted, as far as known to her.  The gardes scene
and its antecedents were alone kept back.  Oberdoffer was given
as authority for the belief, that Henry had gone off after the
mustanger.</p>

<p>The narrative was interrupted by bursts of grief, changing to
indignation, when she came to tell Zeb of the suspicion
entertained by the people&mdash;that Maurice was the
murderer.</p>

<p>"It air a lie!" cried the hunter, partaking of the same
sentiment: "a false, parjured lie! an he air a stinkin' skunk
that invented it.  The thing's impossible.  The mowstanger ain't
the man to a dud sech a deed as that.  An' why shed he have dud
it?  If thur hed been an ill-feelin' atween them.  But thur
wa'n't.  I kin answer for the mowstanger&mdash;for more'n oncest
I've heern him talk o' your brother in the tallest kind o' tarms.
In coorse he hated yur cousin Cash&mdash;an who doesn't, I shed
like to know?  Excuse me for sayin' it.  As for the other, it air
different. Ef thar hed been a quarrel an hot blood atween
them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no!" cried the young Creole, forgetting herself in
the agony of her grief.  "It was all over.  Henry was reconciled.
He said so; and Maurice&mdash;"</p>

<p>The astounded look of the listener brought a period to her
speech. Covering her face with her hands, she buried her
confusion in a flood of tears.</p>

<p>"Hoh&mdash;oh!" muttered Zeb; "thur <i>hev</i> been somethin'?
D'ye say, Miss Lewaze, thur war a&mdash;a&mdash;quarrel atween
yur brother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear, dear Zeb!" cried she, removing her hands, and
confronting the stalwart hunter with an air of earnest entreaty,
"promise me, you will keep my secret?  Promise it, as a
friend&mdash;as a brave true-hearted man! You will&mdash;you
will?"</p>

<p>The pledge was given by the hunter raising his broad palm, and
extending it with a sonorous slap over the region of his
heart.</p>

<p>In five minutes more he was in possession of a secret which
woman rarely confides to man&mdash;except to him who can
profoundly appreciate the confidence.</p>

<p>The hunter showed less surprise than might have been expected;
merely muttering to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thort it wild come to somethin' o' the sort&mdash;specially
arter thet ere chase acrost the purayra."</p>

<p>"Wal, Miss Lewaze," he continued, speaking in a tone of kindly
approval, "Zeb Stump don't see anythin' to be ashamed o' in all
thet.  Weemen will be weemen all the world over&mdash;on the
purayras or off o' them; an ef ye have lost yur young heart to
the mowstanger, it wud be the tallest kind o' a mistake to
serpose ye hev displaced yur affeckshuns, as they calls it.
Though he air Irish, he aint none o' the common sort; thet he
aint. As for the rest ye've been tellin' me, it only sarves to
substantify what I've been sayin'&mdash;that it air parfickly
unpossible for the mowstanger to hev dud the dark deed; that is,
ef thur's been one dud at all.  Let's hope thur's nothin' o' the
kind.  What proof hez been found? Only the hoss comin' home wi'
some rid spots on the seddle?"</p>

<p>"Alas! there is more.  The people were all out yesterday. They
followed a trail, and saw something, they would not tell me what.
Father did not appear as if he wished me to know what they had
seen; and I&mdash;I feared, for reasons, to ask the others.
They've gone off again&mdash;only a short while&mdash;just as you
came in sight on the other side."</p>

<p>"But the mowstanger?  What do it say for hisself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought you knew.  He has not been found either. <i>Mon
Dieu! mon Dieu</i>!  He, too, may have fallen by the same hand
that has struck down my brother!"</p>

<p>"Ye say they war on a trail?  His'n I serpose?  If he be
livin' he oughter be foun' at his shanty on the crik.  Why didn't
they go thar? Ah! now I think o't, thur's nobody knows the adzack
sittavashun o' that ere domycile 'ceptin' myself I reckon: an if
it war that greenhorn Spangler as war guidin' o' them he'd niver
be able to lift a trail acrost the chalk purayra.  Hev they gone
that way agin?"</p>

<p>"They have.  I heard some of them say so."</p>

<p>"Wal, if they're gone in sarch o' the mowstanger I reck'n I
mout as well go too.  I'll gie tall odds I find him afore they
do."</p>

<p>"It is for that I've been so anxious to see you.  There am
many rough men along with papa.  As they went away I heard them
use wild words. There were some of those called 'Regulators.'
They talked of lynching and the like.  Some of them swore
terrible oaths of vengeance.  O my God! if they should find
<i>him</i>, and he cannot make clear his innocence, in the height
of their angry passions&mdash;cousin Cassius among the
number&mdash; you understand what I mean&mdash;who knows what may
be done to him?  Dear Zeb, for my sake&mdash;for his, whom you
call friend&mdash;go&mdash;go!  Reach the Alamo before them, and
warn him of the danger!  Your horse is slow. Take mine&mdash;any
one you can find in the stable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thur's some truth in what ye say," interrupted the hunter,
preparing to move off.  "Thur mout be a smell o' danger for the
young fellur; an I'll do what I kin to avart it.  Don't be
uneezay, Miss Lewaze.  Thur's not sech a partickler hurry.  Thet
ere shanty ain't agoin' ter be foun' 'ithout a spell o' sarchin'.
As to ridin' yur spotty I'll manage better on my ole maar.
Beside, the critter air reddy now if Plute hain't tuk off the
saddle.  Don't be greetin' yur eyes out&mdash;thet's a good
chile! Maybe it'll be all right yit 'bout yur brother; and as to
the mowstanger, I hain't no more surspishun o' his innersense
than a unborn babby."</p>

<p>The interview ended by Zeb making obeisance in backwoodsman
style, and striding out of the verandah; while the young Creole
glided off to her chamber, to soothe her troubled spirit in
supplications for his success.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch47"></a>CHAPTER FORTY SEVEN.<br>

AN INTERCEPTED EPISTLE.</h2>

<p class="first">
URGED by the most abject fear, had El Coyote and his three
comrades rushed back to their horses, and scrambled confusedly
into the saddle.</p>

<p>They had no idea of returning to the jacale of Maurice Gerald.
On the contrary, their only thought was to put space between
themselves and that solitary dwelling&mdash;whose owner they had
encountered riding towards it in such strange guise.</p>

<p>That it was "Don Mauricio" not one of them doubted.  All four
knew him by sight&mdash;Diaz better than any&mdash;but all well
enough to be sure it was the <i>Irlandes</i>.  There was his
horse, known to them; his <i>armas de agua</i> of jaguar-skin;
his <i>Navajo</i> blanket, in shape differing from the ordinary
serape of Saltillo;&mdash;and his <i>head</i>!</p>

<p>They had not stayed to scrutinise the features; but the hat
was still in its place&mdash;the sombrero of black glaze which
Maurice was accustomed to wear.  It had glanced in their eyes, as
it came under the light of the moon.</p>

<p>Besides, they had seen the great dog, which Diaz remembered to
be his. The staghound had sprung forward in the midst of the
struggle, and with a fierce growl attacked the
assailant&mdash;though it had not needed this to accelerate their
retreat.</p>

<p>Fast as their horses could carry them, they rode through the
bottom timber; and, ascending the bluff by one of its
ravines&mdash;not that where they had meant to commit
murder&mdash;they reached the level of the upper plateau.</p>

<p>Nor did they halt there for a single second; but, galloping
across the plain, re-entered the chapparal, and spurred on to the
place where they had so skilfully transformed themselves into
Comanches.</p>

<p>The reverse metamorphosis, if not so carefully, was more
quickly accomplished.  In haste they washed the war-paint from
their skins&mdash; availing themselves of some water carried in
their canteens;&mdash;in haste they dragged their civilised
habiliments from the hollow tree, in which they had hidden them;
and, putting them on in like haste, they once more mounted their
horses, and rode towards the Leona.</p>

<p>On their homeward way they conversed only of the headless
horseman: but, with their thoughts under the influence of a
supernatural terror, they could not satisfactorily account for an
appearance so unprecedented; and they were still undecided as
they parted company on the outskirts of the village&mdash;each
going to his own jacale.</p>

<p>"<i>Carrai</i>!" exclaimed the Coyote, as he stepped across
the threshold of his, and dropped down upon his cane couch.  "Not
much chance of sleeping after that.  <i>Santos Dios</i>! such a
sight!  It has chilled the blood to the very bottom of my veins.
And nothing here to warm me.  The canteen empty; the posada shut
up; everybody in bed!</p>

<p>"<i>Madre de Dios</i>! what can it have been?  Ghost it could
not be; flesh and bones I grasped myself; so did Vicente on the
other side?  I felt that, or something very like it, under the
tiger-skin.  <i>Santissima</i>! it could not be a cheat!</p>

<p>"If a contrivance, why and to what end?  Who cares to play
carnival on the prairies&mdash;except myself, and my camarados?
<i>Mil demonios</i>! what a grim masquerader!</p>

<p>"<i>Carajo</i>! am I forestalled?  Has some other had the
offer, and earned the thousand dollars?  Was it the Irlandes
himself, dead, decapitated, carrying his head in his hand?</p>

<p>"Bah! it could not be&mdash;ridiculous, unlikely, altogether
improbable!</p>

<p>"But what then?</p>

<p>"Ha!  I have it!  A hundred to one I have it!  He may have got
warning of our visit, or, at least, had suspicions of it.  'Twas
a trick got up to try us!&mdash;perhaps himself in sight, a
witness of our disgraceful flight?  <i>Maldito</i>!</p>

<p>"But who could have betrayed us?  No one.  Of course no one
could tell of <i>that</i> intent.  How then should he have
prepared such an infernal surprise?</p>

<p>"Ah!  I forget.  It was broad daylight as we made the crossing
of the long prairie.  We may have been seen, and our purpose
suspected?  Just so&mdash;just so.  And then, while we were
making our toilet in the chapparal, the other could have been
contrived and effected.  That, and that only, can be the
explanation!</p>

<p>"Fools! to have been frightened at a scarecrow!</p>

<p>"<i>Carrambo</i>!  It shan't long delay the event.  To-morrow
I go back to the Alamo.  I'll touch that thousand yet, if I
should have to spend twelve months in earning it; and, whether or
not, the <i>deed</i> shall be done all the same.  Enough to have
lost Isidora.  It may not be true; but the very suspicion of it
puts me beside myself.  If I but find out that she loves
him&mdash;that they have met since&mdash;since&mdash;Mother of
God!  I shall go mad; and in my madness destroy not only the man
I hate, but the woman I love!  O Dona Isidora Covarubio de los
Llanos!  Angel of beauty, and demon of mischief!  I could kill
you with my caresses&mdash;I can kill you with my steel!  One or
other shall be your fate.  It is for you to choose between
them!"</p>

<p>His spirit becoming a little tranquillised, partly through
being relieved by this conditional threat&mdash;and partly from
the explanation he had been able to arrive at concerning the
other thought that had been troubling it&mdash;he soon after fell
asleep.</p>

<p>Nor did he awake until daylight looked in at his door, and
along with it a visitor.</p>

<p>"Jose!" he cried out in a tone of surprise in which pleasure
was perceptible&mdash;"you here?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si, Señor; yo estoy</i>."</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, good Jose.  The Dona Isidora here?&mdash;on
the Leona, I mean?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si, Señor</i>."</p>

<p>"So soon again!  She was here scarce two weeks ago, was she
not?  I was away from the settlement, but had word of it.  I was
expecting to hear from you, good Jose.  Why did you not
write?"</p>

<p>"Only, Señor Don Miguel, for want of a messenger that could be
relied upon.  I had something to communicate, that could not with
safety be entrusted to a stranger.  Something, I am sorry to say,
you won't thank me for telling you; but my life is yours, and I
promised you should know all."</p>

<p>The "prairie wolf" sprang to his feet, as if pricked with a
sharp-pointed thorn.</p>

<p>"Of her, and him?  I know it by your looks.  Your mistress has
met him?"</p>

<p>"No, Señor, she hasn't&mdash;not that I know of&mdash;not
since the first time."</p>

<p>"What, then?" inquired Diaz, evidently a little relieved, "She
was here while he was at the posada.  Something passed between
them?"</p>

<p>"True, Don Miguel&mdash;something did pass, as I well know,
being myself the bearer of it.  Three times I carried him a
basket of <i>dulces</i>, sent by the Dona Isidora&mdash;the last
time also a letter."</p>

<p>"A letter!  You know the contents?  You read it?"</p>

<p>"Thanks to your kindness to the poor <i>peon</i> boy, I was
able to do that; more still&mdash;to make a copy of it."</p>

<p>"You have one?"</p>

<p>"I have.  You see, Don Miguel, you did not have me sent to
school for nothing.  This is what the Dona Isidora wrote to
him."</p>

<p>Diaz reached out eagerly, and, taking hold of the piece of
paper, proceeded to devour its contents.</p>

<p>It was a copy of the note that had been sent among the
sweetmeats.</p>

<p>Instead of further exciting, it seemed rather to tranquillise
him.</p>

<p>"<i>Carrambo</i>!" he carelessly exclaimed, as he folded up
the epistle. "There's not much in this, good Jose.  It only
proves that your mistress is grateful to one who has done her a
service.  If that's all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it is not all, Señor Don Miguel; and that's why I've come
to see you now.  I'm on an errand to the <i>pueblita</i>.  This
will explain it."</p>

<p>"Ha!  Another letter?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si, Señor</i>!  This time the original itself, and not a
poor copy scribbled by me."</p>

<p>With a shaking hand Diaz took hold of the paper, spread it
out, and read:&mdash;</p>

<p>Al Señor Don Mauricio Gerald.</p>

<p><i>Querido amigo</i>!</p>

<p><i>Otra vez aqui estoy&mdash;con tio Silvio quedando!  Sin
novedades de V. no puedo mas tiempo existir.  La incertitud me
malaba.  Digame que es V. convalescente!  Ojala, que estuviera
asi!  Suspiro en vuestros ojos mirar, estos ojos tan lindos y tan
espresivos&mdash;a ver, si es restablecido vuestra salud.  Sea
graciosa darme este favor.  Hay&mdash;opportunidad.  En una
cortita media de hora, estuviera quedando en la cima de loma,
sobre la cosa del tio.  Ven, cavallero, ven</i>!</p>

<p>Isidora Covarubio de los Llanos.</p>

<p>With a curse El Coyote concluded the reading of the letter.
Its sense could scarce be mistaken.  Literally translated it read
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear Friend,&mdash;I am once more here, staying with uncle
Silvio.  Without hearing of you I could not longer exist.  The
uncertainty was killing me.  Tell me if you are convalescent. Oh!
that it may be so.  I long to look into your eyes&mdash;those
eyes so beautiful, so expressive&mdash;to make sure that your
health is perfectly restored.  Be good enough to grant me this
favour.  There is an opportunity.  In a short half hour from this
time, I shall be on the top of the hill, above my uncle's house.
Come, sir, come!</p>

<p>"Isidora Covarubio De Los Llanos."</p>

<p>"<i>Carajo</i>! an assignation!" half shrieked the indignant
Diaz.  "That and nothing else!  She, too, the proposer.  Ha!  Her
invitation shall be answered; though not by him for whom it is so
cunningly intended.  Kept to the hour&mdash;to the very minute;
and by the Divinity of Vengeance&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here, Jose! this note's of no use.  The man to whom it is
addressed isn't any longer in the pueblita, nor anywhere about
here.  God knows where he is!  There's some mystery about it.  No
matter.  You go on to the posada, and make your inquiries all the
same.  You must do that to fulfil your errand.  Never mind the
<i>papelcito</i>; leave it with me.  You can have it to take to
your mistress, as you come back this way.  Here's a dollar to get
you a drink at the inn.  Señor Doffer keeps the best kind of
aguardiente.  <i>Hasta luejo</i>!"</p>

<p>Without staying to question the motive for these directions
given to him, Jose, after accepting the <i>douceur</i>, yielded
tacit obedience to them, and took his departure from the
jacale.</p>

<p>He was scarce out of sight before Diaz also stepped over its
threshold. Hastily setting the saddle upon his horse, he sprang
into it, and rode off in the opposite direction.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch48"></a>CHAPTER FORTY EIGHT.<br>

ISIDORA.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE sun has just risen clear above the prairie horizon, his
round disc still resting upon the sward, like a buckler of
burnished gold.  His rays are struggling into the chapparal, that
here and there diversifies the savanna.  The dew-beads yet cling
upon the acacias, weighting their feathery fronds, and causing
them to droop earthward, as if grieving at the departure of the
night, whose cool breeze and moist atmosphere are more congenial
to them than the fiery sirocco of day.  Though the birds are
stirring&mdash;for what bird could sleep under the shine of such
glorious sunrise?&mdash;it is almost too early to expect human
being abroad&mdash;elsewhere than upon the prairies of Texas.
There, however, the hour of the sun's rising is the most
enjoyable of the day; and few there are who spend it upon the
unconscious couch, or in the solitude of the chamber.</p>

<p>By the banks of the Leona, some three miles below Fort Inge,
there is one who has forsaken both, to stray through the
chapparal.  This early wanderer is not afoot, but astride a
strong, spirited horse, that seems impatient at being checked in
his paces.  By this description, you may suppose the rider to be
a man; but, remembering that the scene is in Southern Texas still
sparsely inhabited by a Spano-Mexican population&mdash; you are
equally at liberty to conjecture that the equestrian is a woman.
And this, too, despite the round hat upon the head&mdash;despite
the serape upon the shoulders, worn as a protection against the
chill morning air&mdash; despite the style of equitation, so
<i>outre</i> to European ideas, since the days of La Duchesse de
Berri; and still further, despite the crayon-like colouring on
the upper lip, displayed in the shape of a pair of silken
moustaches.  More especially may this last mislead; and you may
fancy yourself looking upon some Spanish youth, whose dark but
delicate features bespeak the <i>hijo de algo</i>, with a descent
traceable to the times of the Cid.</p>

<p>If acquainted with the character of the Spano-Mexican
physiognomy, this last sign of virility does not decide you as to
the sex.  It may be that the rider in the Texan chapparal, so
distinguished, is, after all, a woman!</p>

<p>On closer scrutiny, this proves to be the case.  It is proved
by the small hand clasping the bridle-rein; by the little foot,
whose tiny toes just touch the "estribo"&mdash;looking less in
contrast with the huge wooden block that serves as a stirrup; by
a certain softness of shape, and pleasing rotundity of outline,
perceptible even through the thick serape of Saltillo; and
lastly, by the grand luxuriance of hair coiled up at the back of
the head, and standing out in shining clump beyond the rim of the
sombrero.  After noting these points, you become convinced that
you are looking upon a woman, though it may be one distinguished
by certain idiosyncrasies.  You are looking upon the Dona Isidora
Covarubio de los Llanos.</p>

<p>You are struck by the strangeness of her costume&mdash;still
more by the way she sits her horse.  In your eyes, unaccustomed
to Mexican modes, both may appear
odd&mdash;unfeminine&mdash;perhaps indecorous.</p>

<p>The Dona Isidora has no thought&mdash;not even a
suspicion&mdash;of there being anything odd in either.  Why
should she?  She is but following the fashion of her country and
her kindred.  In neither respect is she peculiar.</p>

<p>She is young, but yet a woman.  She has seen twenty summers,
and perhaps one more.  Passed under the sun of a Southern sky, it
is needless to say that her girlhood is long since gone by.  In
her beauty there is no sign of decadence.  She is fair to look
upon, as in her "buen quince" (beautiful fifteen), Perhaps
fairer.  Do not suppose that the dark lining on her lip damages
the feminine expression of her face.  Rather does it add to its
attractiveness.  Accustomed to the glowing complexion of the
Saxon blonde, you may at first sight deem it a deformity.  Do not
so pronounce, till you have looked again.  A second glance,
and&mdash;my word for it&mdash;you will modify your opinion.  A
third will do away with your indifference; a fourth change it to
admiration!</p>

<p>Continue the scrutiny, and it will end in your becoming
convinced: that a woman wearing a moustache&mdash;young,
beautiful, and brunette&mdash;is one of the grandest sights which
a beneficent Nature offers to the eye of man.</p>

<p>It is presented in the person of Isidora Covarubio de los
Llanos.  If there is anything unfeminine in her face, it is not
this; though it may strengthen a wild, almost fierce, expression,
at times discernible, when her white teeth gleam conspicuously
under the sable shadow of the "bigotite."</p>

<p>Even then is she beautiful; but, like that of the female
jaguar, 'tis a beauty that inspires fear rather than
affection.</p>

<p>At all times it is a countenance that bespeaks for its owner
the possession of mental attributes not ordinarily bestowed upon
her sex. Firmness, determination, courage&mdash;carried to the
extreme of reckless daring&mdash;are all legible in its lines. In
those cunningly-carved features, slight, sweet, and delicate,
there is no sign of fainting or fear.  The crimson that has
struggled through the brown skin of her cheeks would scarce
forsake them in the teeth of the deadliest danger.</p>

<p>She is riding alone, through the timbered bottom of the Leona.
There is a house not far off; but she is leaving it behind her.
It is the hacienda of her uncle, Don Silvio Martinez, from the
portals of which she has late issued forth.</p>

<p>She sits in her saddle as firmly as the skin that covers it.
It is a spirited horse, and has the habit of showing it by his
prancing paces. But you have no fear for the rider: you are
satisfied of her power to control him.</p>

<p>A light lazo, suited to her strength, is suspended from the
saddle-bow. Its careful coiling shows that it is never neglected.
This almost assures you, that she understands how to use it.  She
does&mdash;can throw it, with the skill of a mustanger.</p>

<p>The accomplishment is one of her conceits; a part of the
idiosyncrasy already acknowledged.</p>

<p>She is riding along a road&mdash;not the public one that
follows the direction of the river.  It is a private way leading
from the hacienda of her uncle, running into the former near the
summit of a hill&mdash;the hill itself being only the bluff that
abuts upon the bottom lands of the Leona.</p>

<p>She ascends the sloping path&mdash;steep enough to try the
breathing of her steed.  She reaches the crest of the ridge,
along which trends the road belonging to everybody.</p>

<p>She reins up; though not to give her horse an opportunity of
resting. She has halted, because of having reached the point
where her excursion is to terminate.</p>

<p>There is an opening on one side of the road, of circular
shape, and having a superficies of some two or three acres.  It
is grass-covered and treeless&mdash;a prairie in <i>petto</i>. It
is surrounded by the chapparal forest&mdash;very different from
the bottom timber out of which she has just emerged.  On all
sides is the enclosing thicket of spinous plants, broken only by
the embouchures of three paths, their triple openings scarce
perceptible from the middle of the glade.</p>

<p>Near its centre she has pulled up, patting her horse upon the
neck to keep him quiet.  It is not much needed.  The scaling of
the "cuesta" has done that for him.  He has no inclination either
to go on, or tramp impatiently in his place.</p>

<p>"I am before the hour of appointment," mutters she, drawing a
gold watch from under her serape, "if, indeed, I should expect
him at all.  He may not come?  God grant that he be able!</p>

<p>"I am trembling!  Or is it the breathing of the horse?
<i>Valga me Dios</i>, no!  'Tis my own poor nerves!</p>

<p>"I never felt so before!  Is it fear?  I suppose it is.</p>

<p>"'Tis strange though&mdash;to fear the man I love&mdash;the
only one I over have loved: for it could not have been love I had
for Don Miguel.  A girl's fancy.  Fortunate for me to have got
cured of it!  Fortunate my discovering him to be a coward.  That
disenchanted me&mdash;quite dispelled the romantic dream in which
he was the foremost figure.  Thank my good stars, for the
disenchantment; for now I hate him, now that I hear he has
grown&mdash;<i>Santissima</i>! can it be true that he has
become&mdash;a&mdash;a <i>salteador</i>?</p>

<p>"And yet I should have no fear of meeting him&mdash;not even
in this lone spot!</p>

<p>"<i>Ay de mi</i>!  Fearing the man I love, whom I believe to
be of kind, noble nature&mdash;and having no dread of him I hate,
and know to be cruel and remorseless!  'Tis
strange&mdash;incomprehensible!</p>

<p>"No&mdash;there is nothing strange in it.  I tremble not from
any thought of danger&mdash;only the danger of not being beloved.
That is why I now shiver in my saddle&mdash;why I have not had
one night of tranquil sleep since my deliverance from those
drunken savages.</p>

<p>"I have never told <i>him</i> of this; nor do I know how he
may receive the confession.  It must, and shall be made.  I can
endure the uncertainty no longer.  In preference I choose
despair&mdash;death, if my hopes deceive me!</p>

<p>"Ha!  There is a hoof stroke!  A horse comes down the road! It
is his? Yes.  I see glancing through the trees the bright hues of
our national costume.  He delights to wear it.  No wonder; it so
becomes him!</p>

<p>"<i>Santa Virgin</i>!  I'm under a serape, with a sombrero on
my head.  He'll mistake me for a man!  Off, ye ugly disguises,
and let me seem what I am&mdash;a woman."</p>

<p>Scarce quicker could be the transformation in a pantomime. The
casting off the serape reveals a form that Hebe might have
envied; the removal of the hat, a head that would have inspired
the chisel of Canova!</p>

<p>A splendid picture is exhibited in that solitary glade; worthy
of being framed, by its bordering of spinous trees, whose hirsute
arms seem stretched out to protect it.</p>

<p>A horse of symmetrical shape, half backed upon his haunches,
with nostrils spread to the sky, and tail sweeping the ground; on
his back one whose aspect and attitude suggest a commingling of
grand, though somewhat incongruous ideas, uniting to form a
picture, statuesque as beautiful.</p>

<p>The <i>pose</i> of the rider is perfect.  Half sitting in the
saddle, half standing upon the stirrup, every undulation of her
form is displayed&mdash; the limbs just enough relaxed to show
that she is a woman.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding what she has said, on her face there is no
fear&mdash;at least no sign to betray it.  There is no quivering
lip&mdash;no blanching of the cheeks.</p>

<p>The expression is altogether different.  It is a look of
love&mdash;couched under a proud confidence, such as that with
which the she-eagle awaits the wooing of her mate.</p>

<p>You may deem the picture overdrawn&mdash;perhaps pronounce it
unfeminine.</p>

<p>And yet it is a copy from real life&mdash;true as I can
remember it; and more than once had I the opportunity to fix it
in my memory.</p>

<p>The attitude is altered, and with the suddenness of a <i>coup
d'eclair</i>; the change being caused by recognition of the
horseman who comes galloping into the glade.  The shine of the
gold-laced vestments had misled her.  They are worn not by
Maurice Gerald, but by Miguel Diaz!</p>

<p>Bright looks become black.  From her firm seat in the saddle
she subsides into an attitude of listlessness&mdash;despairing
rather than indifferent; and the sound that escapes her lips, as
for an instant they part over her pearl-like teeth, is less a
sigh than an exclamation of chagrin.</p>

<p>There is no sign of fear in the altered attitude&mdash;only
disappointment, dashed with defiance.</p>

<p>El Coyote speaks first.</p>

<p>"<i>H'la!  S'norita</i>, who'd have expected to find your
ladyship in this lonely place&mdash;wasting your sweetness on the
thorny chapparal?"</p>

<p>"In what way can it concern you, Don Miguel Diaz?"</p>

<p>"Absurd question, S'norita!  You know it can, and does; and
the reason why.  You well know how madly I love you.  Fool was I
to confess it, and acknowledge myself your slave.  'Twas that
that cooled you so quickly."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Señor.  I never told you I loved you.  If I
did admire your feats of horsemanship, and said so, you had no
right to construe it as you've done.  I meant no more than that I
admired <i>them</i>&mdash;not you.  'Tis three years ago.  I was
a girl then, of an age when such things have a fascination for
our sex&mdash;when we are foolish enough to be caught by personal
accomplishments rather than moral attributes.  I am now a woman.
All that is changed, as&mdash;it ought to be."</p>

<p>"<i>Carrai</i>!  Why did you fill me with false hopes?  On the
day of the <i>herradero</i>, when I conquered the fiercest bull
and tamed the wildest horse in your father's herds&mdash;a horse
not one of his <i>vaqueros</i> dared so much as lay hands
upon&mdash;on that day you smiled&mdash;ay, looked love upon me.
You need not deny it, Dona Isidora!  I had experience, and could
read the expression&mdash;could tell your thoughts, as they were
then.  They are changed, and why?  Because I was conquered by
your charms, or rather because I was the silly fool to
acknowledge it; and you, like all women, once you had won and
knew it, no longer cared for your conquest.  It is true,
S'norita; it is true."</p>

<p>"It is not, Don Miguel Diaz.  I never gave you word or sign to
say that I loved, or thought of you otherwise than as an
accomplished cavalier. You appeared so then&mdash;perhaps were
so.  What are you now?  You know what's said of you, both here
and on the Rio Grande!"</p>

<p>"I scorn to reply to calumny&mdash;whether it proceeds from
false friends or lying enemies.  I have come here to seek
explanations, not to give them."</p>

<p>"Prom whom?"</p>

<p>"Prom your sweet self, Dona Isidora."</p>

<p>"You are presumptive, Don Miguel Diaz!  Think, Señor, to whom
you are addressing yourself.  Remember, I am the daughter
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One of the proudest <i>Haciendados</i> in Tamaulipas, and
niece to one of the proudest in Texas.  I have thought of all
that; and thought too that I was once a haciendado myself and am
now only a hunter of horses. <i>Carrambo</i>! what of that?
You're not the woman to despise a man for the inferiority of his
rank.  A poor mustanger stands as good a chance in your eyes as
the owner of a hundred herds.  In that respect, <i>I have proof
of your generous spirit</i>!"</p>

<p>"What proof?" asked she, in a quick, entreating tone, and for
the first time showing signs of uneasiness.  "What evidence of
the generosity you are so good as to ascribe to me?"</p>

<p>"This pretty epistle I hold in my hand, indited by the Dona
Isidora Covarubio de los Llanos, to one who, like myself, is but
a dealer in horseflesh.  I need not submit it to very close
inspection.  No doubt you can identify it at some distance?"</p>

<p>She could, and did; as was evinced by her starting in the
saddle&mdash;by her look of angry surprise directed upon
Diaz.</p>

<p>"Señor! how came you in possession of this?" she asked,
without any attempt to disguise her indignation.</p>

<p>"It matters not.  I am in possession of it, and of what for
many a day I have been seeking; a proof, not that you had ceased
to care for me&mdash;for this I had good reason to know&mdash;but
that you had begun to care for him. This tells that you love
him&mdash;words could not speak plainer.  You long to look into
his beautiful eyes.  <i>Mil demonios</i>! you shall never see
them again!"</p>

<p>"What means this, Don Miguel Diaz?"</p>

<p>The question was put not without a slight quivering of the
voice that seemed to betray fear.  No wonder it should.  There
was something in the aspect of El Coyote at that moment well
calculated to inspire the sentiment.</p>

<p>Observing it, he responded, "You may well show fear: you have
reason. If I have lost you, my lady, no other shall enjoy you.  I
have made up my mind about that."</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"What I have said&mdash;that no other shall call you his, and
least of all Maurice the mustanger."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Ay, indeed!  Give me a promise that you and he shall never
meet again, or you depart not from this place!"</p>

<p>"You are jesting, Don Miguel?"</p>

<p>"I am in earnest, Dona Isidora."</p>

<p>The manner of the man too truly betrayed the sincerity of his
speech. Coward as he was, there was a cold cruel determination in
his looks, whilst his hand was seen straying towards the hilt of
his machete.</p>

<p>Despite her Amazonian courage, the woman could not help a
feeling of uneasiness.  She saw there was a danger, with but
slight chance of averting it.  Something of this she had felt
from the first moment of the encounter; but she had been
sustained by the hope, that the unpleasant interview might be
interrupted by one who would soon change its character.</p>

<p>During the early part of the dialogue she had been eagerly
listening for the sound of a horse's hoof&mdash;casting
occasional and furtive glances through the chapparal, in the
direction where she hoped to hear it.</p>

<p>This hope was no more.  The sight of her own letter told its
tale: it had not reached its destination.</p>

<p>Deprived of this hope&mdash;hitherto sustaining her&mdash;she
next thought of retreating from the spot.</p>

<p>But this too presented both difficulties and dangers.  It was
possible for her to wheel round and gallop off; but it was
equally possible for her retreat to be intercepted by a bullet.
The butt of El Coyote's pistol was as near to his hand as the
hilt of his machete.</p>

<p>She was fully aware of the danger.  Almost any other woman
would have given way to it.  Not so Isidora Covarubio de los
Llanos.  She did not even show signs of being affected by it.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" she exclaimed, answering his protestation with an
air of well dissembled incredulity.  "You are making sport of me,
Señor.  You wish to frighten me.  Ha! ha! ha!  Why should I fear
<i>you</i>?  I can ride as well&mdash;fling my lazo as sure and
far as you, Look at this I see how skilfully I can handle
it!"</p>

<p>While so speaking&mdash;smiling as she spoke&mdash;she had
lifted the lazo from her saddle-bow and was winding it round her
head, as if to illustrate her observations.</p>

<p>The act had a very different intent, though it was not
perceived by Diaz; who, puzzled by her behaviour, sate speechless
in his saddle.</p>

<p>Not till he felt the noose closing around his elbows did he
suspect her design; and then too late to hinder its execution. In
another instant his arms were pinioned to his sides&mdash;both
the butt of his pistol and the hilt of his machete beyond the
grasp of his fingers!</p>

<p>He had not even time to attempt releasing himself from the
loop.  Before he could lay hand upon the rope, it tightened
around his body, and with a violent pluck jerked him out of his
saddle&mdash;throwing him stunned and senseless to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Now, Don Miguel Diaz!" cried she who had caused this change
of situation, and who was now seen upon her horse, with head
turned homeward, the lazo strained taut from the saddle-tree.
"Menace me no more!  Make no attempt to release yourself.  Stir
but a finger, and I spur on!  Cruel villain! coward as you are,
you would have killed me&mdash;I saw it in your eye.  Ha! the
tables are turned, and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Perceiving that there was no rejoinder, she interrupted her
speech, still keeping the lazo at a stretch, with her eyes fixed
upon the fallen man.</p>

<p>El Coyote lay upon the ground, his arms enlaced in the loop,
without stirring, and silent as a stick of wood.  The fall from
his horse had deprived him of speech, and consciousness at the
same time.  To all appearance he was dead&mdash;his steed alone
showing life by its loud neighing, as it reared back among the
bushes.</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>"Holy Virgin! have I killed him?" she exclaimed, reining her
horse slightly backward, though still keeping him headed away,
and ready to spring to the spur.  "Mother of God!  I did not
intend it&mdash;though I should be justified in doing even that:
for too surely did he intend to kill <i>me</i>!  Is he dead, or
is it a <i>ruse</i> to get me near?  By our good Guadaloupe!  I
shall leave others to decide.  There's not much fear of his
overtaking me, before I can reach home; and if he's in any danger
the people of the hacienda will get back soon enough to release
him. Good day, Don Miguel Diaz!  <i>Hasta luego</i>!"</p>

<p>With these words upon her lips&mdash;the levity of which
proclaimed her conscience clear of having committed a crime she
drew a small sharp-bladed knife from beneath the bodice of her
dress; severed the rope short off from her saddle-bow; and,
driving the spur deep into the flanks of her horse, galloped off
out of the glade&mdash;leaving Diaz upon the ground, still
encircled by the loop of the lazo!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch49"></a>CHAPTER FORTY NINE.<br>

THE LAZO UNLOOSED.</h2>

<p class="first">
AN eagle, scared from its perch on a scathed Cottonwood, with
a scream, soars upward into the air.</p>

<p>Startled by the outbreak of angry passions, it has risen to
reconnoitre.</p>

<p>A single sweep of its majestic wing brings it above the glade.
There, poised on tremulous pinions, with eye turned to earth, it
scans both the open space and the chapparal that surrounds it. In
the former it beholds that which may, perhaps, be gratifying to
its glance&mdash;a man thrown from his horse, that runs neighing
around him&mdash;prostrate&mdash; apparently dead.  In the latter
two singular equestrians: one a woman, with bare head and
chevelure spread to the breeze, astride a strong steed, going
away from the glade in quick earnest gallop; the other, also a
woman, mounted on a spotted horse, in more feminine fashion,
riding towards it: attired in hat and habit, advancing at a
slower pace, but with equal earnestness in her looks.</p>

<p>Such is the <i>coup d'oeil</i> presented to the eye of the
eagle.</p>

<p>Of these fair equestrians both are already known.  She
galloping away is Isidora Covarubio de los Llanos; she who
approaches, Louise Poindexter.</p>

<p>It is known why the first has gone out of the glade.  It
remains to be told for what purpose the second is coming into
it.</p>

<p>After her interview with Zeb Stump, the young creole re-
entered her chamber, and kneeling before an image of the Madonna,
surrendered her spirit to prayer.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that, as a Creole, she was a Catholic,
and therefore a firm believer in the efficacy of saintly
intercession. Strange and sad was the theme of her
supplication&mdash;the man who had been marked as the murderer of
her brother!</p>

<p>She had not the slightest idea that he was guilty of the
horrid crime. It could not be.  The very suspicion of it would
have lacerated her heart.</p>

<p>Her prayer was not for pardon, but protection.  She
supplicated the Virgin to save him from his enemies&mdash;her own
friends!</p>

<p>Tears and choking sobs were mingled with her words, low
murmured in the ear of Heaven.  She had loved her brother with
the fondest sisterly affection.  She sorrowed sorely; but her
sorrow could not stifle that other affection, stronger than the
ties of blood.  While mourning her brother's loss she prayed for
her lover's safety.</p>

<p>As she rose from her knees, her eye fell upon the
bow&mdash;that implement so cunningly employed to despatch sweet
messages to the man she loved.</p>

<p>"Oh! that I could send one of its arrows to warn him of his
danger!  I may never use it again!"</p>

<p>The reflection was followed by a thought of cognate character.
Might there not remain some trace of that clandestine
correspondence in the place where it had been carried on?</p>

<p>She remembered that Maurice swam the stream, instead of
recrossing in the skiff, to be drawn back again by her own lazo.
He must have been left in the boat!</p>

<p>On the day before, in the confusion of her grief, she had not
thought of this.  It might become evidence of their midnight
meeting; of which, as she supposed, no tongue but
theirs&mdash;and that for ever silent&mdash;could tell the
tale.</p>

<p>The sun was now fairly up, and gleaming garishly through the
glass.  She threw open the casement and stepped out, with the
design of proceeding towards the skiff.  In the <i>balcon</i> her
steps were arrested, on hearing voices above.</p>

<p>Two persons were conversing.  They were her maid Florinde, and
the sable groom, who, in the absence of his master, was taking
the air of the <i>azotea</i>.</p>

<p>Their words could be heard below, though their young mistress
did not intentionally listen to them.  It was only on their
pronouncing a name, that she permitted their patois to make an
impression upon her ear.</p>

<p>"Dey calls de young fella Jerrad.  Mors Jerrad am de name. Dey
do say he Irish, but if folks 'peak de troof, he an't bit like
dem Irish dat works on de Lebee at New Orlean.  Ho, ho!  He more
like bos gen'lum planter.  Dat's what he like."</p>

<p>"You don't tink, Pluto, he been gone kill Massa Henry?"</p>

<p>"I doan't tink nuffin ob de kind.  Ho, ho!  He kill Massa
Henry! no more dan dis chile hab done dat same.
Goramity&mdash;Goramity!  'Peak ob de debbil and he dar&mdash;de
berry individible we talkin' 'bout.  Ho, ho! look Florinde; look
yonner!"</p>

<p>"Whar?"</p>

<p>"Dar&mdash;out dar, on todder side ob de ribber.  You see man
on horseback. Dat's Mors Jerrad, de berry man we meet on de brack
praira.  De same dat gub Missa Loode 'potted hoss; de same dey've
all gone to sarch for.  Ho, ho!  Dey gone dey wrong way.  Dey no
find him out on dem prairas dis day."</p>

<p>"O, Pluto! an't you glad?  I'm sure he innocent&mdash;dat
brave bewful young gen'lum.  He nebba could been de
man&mdash;"</p>

<p>The listener below stayed to hear no more.  Gliding back into
her chamber she made her way towards the <i>azotea</i>.  The
beating of her heart was almost as loud as the fall of her
footsteps while ascending the <i>escalera</i>.  It was with
difficulty she could conceal her emotion from the two individuals
whose conversation had caused it.  "What have you seen, that you
talk so loudly?" said she, trying to hide her agitation under a
pretended air of severity, "Ho, ho!  Missa Looey&mdash;look ober
dar. De young fella!"</p>

<p>"What young fellow?"</p>

<p>"Him as dey be gone sarch for&mdash;him dat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see no one."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!  He jess gone in 'mong de tree.  See
yonner&mdash;yonner!  You see de black glaze hat, de shinin'
jacket ob velvet, an de glancin' silver buttons&mdash;dat's him.
I sartin sure dat's de same young fella."</p>

<p>"You may be mistaken for all that, Master Pluto.  There are
many here who dress in that fashion.  The distance is too great
for you to distinguish; and now that he's almost out of
sight&mdash;Never mind, Florinde.  Hasten below&mdash;get out my
hat and habit.  I'm going out for a ride.  You, Pluto! have the
saddle on Luna in the shortest time.  I must not let the sun get
too high.  Haste! haste!"</p>

<p>As the servants disappeared down the stairway, she turned once
more towards the parapet, her bosom heaving under the revulsion
of thoughts. Unobserved she could now freely scan the prairie and
chapparal.</p>

<p>She was too late.  The horseman had ridden entirely out of
sight.</p>

<p>"It was very like him, and yet it was not.  It can scarce be
possible. If it be he, why should he be going that way?"</p>

<p>A new pang passed through her bosom.  She remembered once
before having asked herself the same question.</p>

<p>She no longer stayed upon the <i>azotea</i> to watch the road.
In ten minutes' time she was across the river, entering the
chapparal where the horseman had disappeared.</p>

<p>She rode rapidly on, scanning the causeway far in the
advance.</p>

<p>Suddenly she reined up, on nearing the crest of the hill that
overlooked the Leona.  The act was consequent on the hearing of
voices.</p>

<p>She listened.  Though still distant, and but faintly heard,
the voices could be distinguished as those of a man and
woman.</p>

<p>What man?  What woman?  Another pang passed through her heart
at these put questions.</p>

<p>She rode nearer; again halted; again listened.</p>

<p>The conversation was carried on in Spanish.  There was no
relief to her in this.  Maurice Gerald would have talked in that
tongue to Isidora Covarubio de los Llanos.  The Creole was
acquainted with it sufficiently to have understood what was said,
had she been near enough to distinguish the words.  The tone was
animated on both sides, as if both speakers were in a passion.
The listener was scarce displeased at this.</p>

<p>She rode nearer; once more pulled up; and once more sate
listening.</p>

<p>The man's voice was heard no longer.  The woman's sounded dear
and firm, as if in menace!</p>

<p>There was an interval of silence, succeeded by a quick
trampling of horses&mdash;another pause&mdash;another speech on
the part of the woman, at first loud like a threat, and then
subdued as in a soliloquy&mdash;then another interval of silence,
again broken by the sound of hoofs, as if a single horse was
galloping away from the ground.</p>

<p>Only this, and the scream of an eagle, that, startled by the
angry tones, had swooped aloft, and was now soaring above the
glade.</p>

<p>The listener knew of the opening&mdash;to her a hallowed spot.
The voices had come out of it.  She had made her last halt a
little way from its edge.  She had been restrained from advancing
by a fear&mdash;the fear of finding out a bitter truth.</p>

<p>Her indecision ending, she spurred on into the glade.</p>

<p>A horse saddled and bridled rushing to and fro&mdash;a man
prostrate upon the ground, with a lazo looped around his arms, to
all appearance dead&mdash;a <i>sombrero</i> and <i>serape</i>
lying near, evidently not the man's!  What could be the
interpretation of such a tableau?</p>

<p>The man was dressed in the rich costume of the Mexican
<i>ranchero</i>&mdash;the horse also caparisoned in this
elaborate and costly fashion.</p>

<p>At sight of both, the heart of the Louisianian leaped with
joy.  Whether dead or living, the man was the same she had seen
from the <i>azotea</i>; and he was <i>not</i> Maurice Gerald.</p>

<p>She had doubted before&mdash;had hoped that it was not he; and
her hopes were now sweetly confirmed.</p>

<p>She drew near and examined the prostrate form.  She scanned
the face, which was turned up&mdash;the man lying upon his back.
She fancied she had seen it before, but was not certain.</p>

<p>It was plain that he was a Mexican.  Not only his dress but
his countenance&mdash;every line of it betrayed the Spanish-
American physiognomy.</p>

<p>He was far from being ill-featured.  On the contrary, he might
have been pronounced handsome.</p>

<p>It was not this that induced Louise Poindexter to leap down
from her saddle, and stoop over him with a kind pitying look.</p>

<p>The joy caused by his presence&mdash;by the discovery that he
was not somebody else&mdash;found gratification in performing an
act of humanity.</p>

<p>"He does not seem dead.  Surely he is breathing?"</p>

<p>The cord appeared to hinder his respiration.</p>

<p>It was loosened on the instant&mdash;the noose giving way to a
Woman's strength.</p>

<p>"Now, he can breathe more freely.  Pardieu! what can have
caused it? Lazoed in his saddle and dragged to the earth?  That
is most probable. But who could have done it?  It was a woman's
voice.  Surely it was?  I could not be mistaken about that.</p>

<p>"And yet there is a man's hat, and a <i>serape</i>, not this
man's!  Was there another, who has gone away with the woman? Only
one horse went off.</p>

<p>"Ah! he is coming to himself! thank Heaven for that!  He will
be able to explain all.  You are recovering, sir?"</p>

<p>"S'norita! who are you?" asked Don Miguel Diaz, raising his
head, and looking apprehensively around.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" he continued.</p>

<p>"Of whom do you speak?  I have seen no one but yourself."</p>

<p>"<i>Carrambo</i>! that's queer.  Haven't you met a woman
astride a grey horse?"</p>

<p>"I heard a woman's voice, as I rode up."</p>

<p>"Say rather a she-devil's voice: for that, sure, is Isidora
Covarubio de los Llanos."</p>

<p>"Was it she who has done this?"</p>

<p>"Maldito, yes!  Where is she now?  Tell me that,
s'norita."</p>

<p>"I cannot.  By the sound of the hoofs I fancy she has gone
down the hill.  She must have done so, as I came the other way
myself."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;gone down the hill&mdash;home, then, to &mdash;.
You've been very kind, s'norita, in loosening this lazo&mdash;as
I make no doubt you've done. Perhaps you will still further
assist me by helping me into the saddle? Once in it, I think I
can stay there.  At all events, I must not stay here.  I have
enemies, not far off.  Come, Carlito!" he cried to his horse, at
the same time summoning the animal by a peculiar whistle. "Come
near!  Don't be frightened at the presence of this fair lady.
She's not the same that parted you and me so rudely&mdash;<i>en
verdad</i>, almost for ever!  Come on, <i>cavallo</i>! come
on!"</p>

<p>The horse, on hearing the whistle, came trotting up, and
permitted his master&mdash;now upon his feet&mdash;to lay hold of
the bridle-rein.</p>

<p>"A little help from you, kind s'norita, and I think I can
climb into my saddle.  Once there, I shall be safe from their
pursuit."</p>

<p>"You expect to be pursued?"</p>

<p>"<i>Quien sale</i>?  I have enemies, as I told you.  Never
mind that.  I feel very feeble.  You will not refuse to help
me?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?  You are welcome, sir, to any assistance I can
give you."</p>

<p>"<i>Mil gracias, s'norita!  Mil, mil gracias</i>!"</p>

<p>The Creole, exerting all her strength, succeeded in helping
the disabled horseman into his saddle; where, after some
balancing, he appeared to obtain a tolerably firm seat.</p>

<p>Gathering up his reins, he prepared to depart.</p>

<p>"Adios, s'norita!" said he, "I know not who you are.  I see
you are not one of our people.  Americano, I take it.  Never mind
that.  You are good as you are fair; and if ever it should chance
to be in his power, Miguel Diaz will not be unmindful of the
service you have this day done him."</p>

<p>Saying this El Coyote rode off, not rapidly, but in a slow
walk, as if he felt some difficulty in preserving his
equilibrium.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the slowness of the pace&mdash;he was soon out
of sight,&mdash;the trees screening him as he passed the glade.
He went not by any of the three roads, but by a narrow track,
scarce discernible where it entered the underwood.</p>

<p>To the young Creole the whole thing appeared like a
dream&mdash;strange, rather than disagreeable.</p>

<p>It was changed to a frightful reality, when, after picking up
a sheet of paper left by Diaz where he had been lying, she read
what was written upon it.  The address was "Don Mauricio Gerald;"
the signature, "Isidora Covarubio de los Llanos."</p>

<p>To regain her saddle, Louise Poindexter was almost as much in
need of a helping hand as the man who had ridden away.</p>

<p>As she forded the Leona, in returning to Casa del Corvo, she
halted her horse in the middle of the stream; and for some time
sate gazing into the flood that foamed up to her stirrup.  There
was a wild expression upon her features that betokened deep
despair.  One degree deeper, and the waters would have covered as
fair a form as was ever sacrificed to their Spirit!</p>

<h2><a id="ch50"></a>CHAPTER FIFTY.<br>

A CONFLICT WITH COYOTES.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE purple shadows of a Texan twilight were descending upon
the earth, when the wounded man, whose toilsome journey through
the chapparal has been recorded, arrived upon the banks of the
streamlet.</p>

<p>After quenching his thirst to a surfeit, he stretched himself
along the grass, his thoughts relieved from the terrible strain
so long and continuously acting upon them.</p>

<p>His limb for the time pained him but little; and his spirit
was too much worn to be keenly apprehensive as to the future.</p>

<p>He only desired repose; and the cool evening breeze, sighing
through the feathery fronds of the acacias, favoured his chances
of obtaining it.</p>

<p>The vultures had dispersed to their roosts in the thicket;
and, no longer disturbed by their boding presence, he soon after
fell asleep.</p>

<p>His slumber was of short continuance.  The pain of his wounds,
once more returning, awoke him.</p>

<p>It was this&mdash;and not the cry of the coyote&mdash;that
kept him from sleeping throughout the remainder of the night.</p>

<p>Little did he regard the sneaking wolf of the prairies&mdash;a
true jackal&mdash; that attacks but the dead; the living, only
when dying.</p>

<p>He did not believe that he was dying.</p>

<p>It was a long dismal night to the sufferer; it seemed as if
day would never dawn.</p>

<p>The light came at length, but revealed nothing to cheer him.
Along with it came the birds, and the beasts went not away.</p>

<p>Over him, in the shine of another sun the vultures once more
extended their shadowy wings.  Around him he heard the howl-bark
of the coyote, in a hundred hideous repetitions.</p>

<p>Crawling down to the stream, he once more quenched his
thirst.</p>

<p>He now hungered; and looked round for something to eat.</p>

<p>A pecan tree stood, near.  There were nuts upon its branches,
within six feet of the ground.</p>

<p>He was able to reach the pecan upon his hands and knees;
though the effort caused agony.</p>

<p>With his crutch he succeeded in detaching some of the nuts;
and on these broke his fast.</p>

<p>What was the next step to be taken?</p>

<p>To stir away from the spot was simply impossible.  The
slightest movement gave him pain; at the same time assuring him
of his utter inability to go anywhere.</p>

<p>He was still uncertain as to the nature of the injuries he had
sustained&mdash;more especially that in his leg, which was so
swollen that he could not well examine it.  He supposed it to be
either a fracture of the knee-cap, or a dislocation of the joint.
In either case, it might be days before he could use the limb;
and what, meanwhile, was he to do?</p>

<p>He had but little expectation of any one coming that way.  He
had shouted himself hoarse; and though, at intervals, he still
continued to send forth a feeble cry, it was but the intermittent
effort of hope struggling against despair.</p>

<p>There was no alternative but stay where he was; and, satisfied
of this, he stretched himself along the sward, with the resolve
to be as patient as possible.</p>

<p>It required all the stoicism of his nature to bear up against
the acute agony he was enduring.  Nor did he endure it altogether
in silence.  At intervals it elicited a groan.</p>

<p>Engrossed by his sufferings, he was for a while unconscious of
what was going on around him.  Still above him wheeled the black
birds; but he had become accustomed to their presence, and no
longer regarded it&mdash;not even when, at intervals, some of
them swooped so near, that he could hear the "wheep" of their
wings close to his ears.</p>

<p>Ha! what was that&mdash;that sound of different import?</p>

<p>It resembled the pattering of little feet upon the sandy
channel of the stream, accompanied by quick breathings, as of
animal in a state of excitement.</p>

<p>He looked around for an explanation.</p>

<p>"Only the coyotes!" was his reflection, on seeing a score of
these animals flitting to and fro, skulking along both banks of
the stream, and "squatting" upon the grass.</p>

<p>Hitherto he had felt no fear&mdash;only contempt&mdash;for
these cowardly creatures.</p>

<p>But his sentiments underwent a change, on his noticing their
looks and attitudes.  The former were fierce; the latter earnest
and threatening. Clearly did the coyotes mean mischief.</p>

<p>He now remembered having heard, that these
animals&mdash;ordinarily innocuous, from sheer
cowardice&mdash;will attack man when disabled beyond the
capability of defending himself.  Especially will they do so when
stimulated by the smell of blood.</p>

<p>His had flowed freely, and from many veins&mdash;punctured by
the spines of the cactus.  His garments were saturated with it,
still but half dry.</p>

<p>On the sultry atmosphere it was sending forth its peculiar
odour.  The coyotes could not help scenting it.</p>

<p>Was it this that was stirring them to such excited
action&mdash;apparently making them mad?</p>

<p>Whether or not, he no longer doubted that it was their
intention to attack him.</p>

<p>He had no weapon but a bowie knife, which fortunately had kept
its place in his belt.  His rifle and pistols, attached to the
saddle, had been carried off by his horse.</p>

<p>He drew the knife; and, resting upon his right knee, prepared
to defend himself.</p>

<p>He did not perform the action a second too soon.  Emboldened
by having been so long left to make their menaces
unmolested&mdash;excited to courage by the smell of blood,
stronger as they drew nearer&mdash;stimulated by their fierce
natural appetites&mdash;the wolves had by this time reached the
turning point of their determination: which was, to spring
forward upon the wounded man.</p>

<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="0900261h-images/TheHeadlessHorseman-11.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>They did so&mdash;half a dozen of them
simultaneously&mdash;fastening their teeth upon his arms, limbs,
and body, as they made their impetuous onset.</p>

<p>With a vigorous effort he shook them off, striking out with
his knife. One or two were gashed by the shining blade, and went
howling away.  But a fresh band had by this time entered into the
fray, others coming up, till the assailants counted a score.  The
conflict became desperate, deadly.  Several of the animals were
slain.  But the fate of their fallen comrades did not deter the
survivors from continuing the strife. On the contrary, it but
maddened them the more.</p>

<p>The struggle became more and more confused&mdash;the coyotes
crowding over one another to lay hold of their victim.  The knife
was wielded at random; the arm wielding it every moment becoming
weaker, and striking with less fatal effect.  The disabled man
was soon further disabled.  He felt fear for his life.  No
wonder&mdash;death was staring him in the face.</p>

<p>At this crisis a cry escaped his lips.  Strange it was not one
of terror, but joy!  And stranger still that, on hearing it, the
coyotes for an instant desisted from their attack!</p>

<p>There was a suspension of the strife&mdash;a short interval of
silence.  It was not the cry of their victim that had caused it,
but that which had elicited the exclamation.</p>

<p>There was the sound of a horse's hoofs going at a gallop,
followed by the loud baying of a hound.</p>

<p>The wounded man continued to exclaim,&mdash;in shouts calling
for help.  The horse appeared to be close by.  A man upon his
back could not fail to hear them.</p>

<p>But there was no response.  The horse, or horseman, had passed
on.</p>

<p>The hoof-strokes became less distinct.  Despair once more
returned to the antagonist of the coyotes.</p>

<p>At the same time his skulking assailants felt a renewal of
their courage, and hastened to renew the conflict.</p>

<p>Once more it commenced, and was soon raging fiercely as
before&mdash;the wretched man believing himself doomed, and only
continuing the strife through sheer desperation.</p>

<p>Once more was it interrupted, this time by an intruder whose
presence inspired him with fresh courage and hope.</p>

<p>If the horseman had proved indifferent to his calls for help,
not so the hound.  A grand creature of the staghound
species&mdash;of its rarest and finest breed&mdash;was seen
approaching the spot, uttering a deep sonorous bay, as with
impetuous bound it broke through the bushes.</p>

<p>"<i>A friend! thank Heaven, a friend</i>!"</p>

<p>The baying ceased, as the hound cleared the selvage of the
chapparal, and rushed open-mouthed among the cowed
coyotes&mdash;already retreating at his approach!</p>

<p>One was instantly seized between the huge jaws; jerked upward
from the earth; shaken as if it had been only a rat; and let go
again, to writhe over the ground with a shattered spine!</p>

<p>Another was served in a similar manner; but ere a third could
be attacked, the terrified survivors dropped their tails to the
sward, and went yelping away; one and all retreating whence they
had come&mdash;into the silent solitudes of the chapparal.</p>

<p>The rescued man saw no more.  His strength was completely
spent.  He had just enough left to stretch forth his arms, and
with a smile close them around the neck of his deliverer.  Then,
murmuring some soft words, he fainted gradually away.</p>

<p>His syncope was soon over, and consciousness once more assumed
away.</p>

<p>Supporting himself on his elbow, he looked inquiringly
around.</p>

<p>It was a strange, sanguinary spectacle that met his eyes.  But
for his swoon, he would have seen a still stranger one.  During
its continuance a horseman had ridden into the glade, and gone
out again.  He was the same whose hoofstroke had been heard, and
who had lent a deaf ear to the cries for help.  He had arrived
too late, and then without any idea of offering assistance.  His
design appeared to be the watering of his horse.</p>

<p>The animal plunged straight into the streamlet, drank to its
satisfaction, climbed out on the opposite bank, trotted across
the open ground, and disappeared in the thicket beyond.</p>

<p>The rider had taken no notice of the prostrate form; the horse
only by snorting, as he saw it, and springing from side to side,
as he trod amidst the carcases of the coyotes.</p>

<p>The horse was a magnificent animal, not large, but perfect in
all his parts.  The man was the very reverse&mdash;having no
head!</p>

<p>There was a head, but not in its proper place.  It rested
against the holster, seemingly held in the rider's hand!</p>

<p>A fearful apparition.</p>

<p>The dog barked, as it passed through the glade, and followed
it to the edge of the underwood.  He had been with it for a long
time, straying where it strayed, and going where it went.</p>

<p>He now desisted from this fruitless fellowship; and, returning
to the sleeper, lay down by his side.</p>

<p>It was then that the latter was restored to consciousness, and
remembered what had made him for the moment oblivious.</p>

<p>After caressing the dog he again sank into a prostrate
position; and, drawing the skirt of the cloak over his face to
shade it from the glare of the sun, he fell asleep.</p>

<p>The staghound lay down at his feet, and also slumbered; but
only in short spells.  At intervals it raised its head, and
uttered an angry growl, as the wings of the vultures came
switching too close to its ears.</p>

<p>The young man muttered in his sleep.  They were wild words
that came from his unconscious lips, and betokened a strange
commingling of thoughts: now passionate appeals of love&mdash;now
disjointed speeches, that pointed to the committal of murder!</p>

<h2><a id="ch51"></a>CHAPTER FIFTY ONE.<br>

TWICE INTOXICATED.</h2>

<p class="first">
OUR story takes us back to the lone hut on the Alamo, so
suddenly forsaken by the gambling guests, who had made themselves
welcome in the absence of its owner.</p>

<p>It is near noon of the following day, and he has not yet come
home.  The <i>ci-devant</i> stable-boy of Bally-ballagh is once
more sole occupant of the <i>jacale</i>&mdash;once more stretched
along the floor, in a state of inebriety; though not the same
from which we have seen him already aroused.  He has been sober
since, and the spell now upon him has been produced by a
subsequent appeal to the Divinity of drink.</p>

<p>To explain, we must go back to that hour between midnight and
morning, when the monte players made their abrupt departure.</p>

<p>The sight of three red savages, seated around the slab table,
and industriously engaged in a game of cards, had done more to
restore Phelim to a state of sobriety than all the sleep he had
obtained.</p>

<p>Despite a certain grotesqueness in the spectacle, he had not
seen such a ludicrous sight, as was proved by the terrific
screech with which he saluted them.  There was nothing laughable
in what followed.  He had no very clear comprehension of what
<i>did</i> follow.  He only remembered that the trio of painted
warriors suddenly gave up their game, flung their cards upon the
floor, stood over him for a time with naked blades, threatening
his life; and then, along with a fourth who had joined them,
turned their backs abruptly, and rushed pellmell out of the
place!</p>

<p>All this occupied scarce twenty seconds of time; and when he
had recovered from his terrified surprise, he found himself once
more alone in the <i>jacale</i>!</p>

<p>Was the sleeping, or awake?  Drunk, or dreaming?  Was the
scene real? Or was it another chapter of incongruous
impossibilities, like that still fresh before his mind?</p>

<p>But no.  The thing was no fancy.  It could not be.  He had
seen the savages too near to be mistaken as to their reality.  He
had heard them talking in a tongue unknown to him.  What could it
be but Indian jargon? Besides, there were the pieces of
pasteboard strewn over the floor!</p>

<p>He did not think of picking one up to satisfy himself of
<i>their</i> reality.  He was sober enough, but not sufficiently
courageous for that. He could not be sure of their not burning
his fingers&mdash;those queer cards?  They might belong to the
devil?</p>

<p>Despite the confusion of his senses, it occurred to him that
the hut was no longer a safe place to stay in.  The painted
players might return to finish their game.  They had left behind
not only their cards, but everything else the <i>jacale</i>
contained; and though some powerful motive seemed to have caused
their abrupt departure, they might re-appear with equal
abruptness.</p>

<p>The thought prompted the Galwegian to immediate action; and,
blowing out the candle, so as to conceal his movements, he stole
softly out of the hut.</p>

<p>He did not go by the door.  The moon was shining on the grass-
plat in front.  The savages might still be there.</p>

<p>He found means of exit at the back, by pulling one of the
horse hides from its place, and squeezing himself through the
stockade wall.</p>

<p>Once outside, he skulked off under the shadow of the
trees.</p>

<p>He had not gone far when a clump of dark objects appeared
before him. There was a sound, as of horses champing their bitts,
and the occasional striking of a hoof.  He paused in his steps,
screening his body behind the trunk of a cypress.</p>

<p>A short observation convinced him, that what he saw was a
group of horses.  There appeared to be four of them; no doubt
belonging to the four warriors, who had turned the mustanger's
hut into a gaming-house. The animals appeared to be tied to a
tree, but for all that, their owners might be beside them.</p>

<p>Having made this reflection, he was about to turn back and go
the other way; but just at that moment he heard voices in the
opposite direction&mdash; the voices of several men speaking in
tones of menace and command.</p>

<p>Then came short, quick cries of affright, followed by the
baying of a hound, and succeeded by silence, at intervals
interrupted by a swishing noise, or the snapping of a
branch&mdash;as if several men were retreating through the
underwood in scared confusion!</p>

<p>As he continued to listen, the noises sounded nearer.  The men
who made them were advancing towards the cypress tree.</p>

<p>The tree was furnished with buttresses all around its base,
with shadowy intervals between.  Into one of these he stepped
hastily; and, crouching close, was completely screened by the
shadow.</p>

<p>He had scarce effected his concealment, when four men came
rushing up; and, without stopping, hastened on towards the
horses.</p>

<p>As they passed by him, they were exchanging speeches which the
Irishman could not understand; but their tone betrayed terror.
The excited action of the men confirmed it.  They were evidently
retreating from some enemy that had filled them with fear.</p>

<p>There was a glade where the moon-beams fell upon the grass. It
was just outside the shadow of the cypress.  To reach the horses
they had to cross it; and, as they did so, the vermilion upon
their naked skins flashed red under the moonlight.</p>

<p>Phelim identified the four gentlemen who had made so free with
the hospitality of the hut.</p>

<p>He kept his place till they had mounted, and rode
off&mdash;till he could tell by the tramp of their horses that
they had ascended the upper plain, and gone off in a
gallop&mdash;as men who were not likely to come back again.</p>

<p>"Doesn't that bate Banagher?" muttered he, stepping out from
his hiding-place, and throwing up his arms in astonishment.  "Be
japers! it diz.  Mother av Moses! fwhat cyan it mane anyhow? What
are them divvils afther?  An fwhat's afther them?  Shure
somethin' has given them a scare&mdash;that's plain as a
pikestaff.  I wondher now if it's been that same.  Be me sowl
it's jist it they've encounthered.  I heerd the hound gowlin, an
didn't he go afther it.  O Lard! what cyan <i>it</i> be?  May be
it'll be comin' this way in purshoot av them?"</p>

<p>The dread of again beholding the unexplained apparition, or
being beheld by it, caused him to shrink once more under the
shadow of the tree; where he remained for some time longer in a
state of trembling suspense.</p>

<p>"Afther all, <i>it</i> must be some thrick av Masther Maurice.
Maybe to give me a scare; an comin' back he's jist been in time
to frighten off these ridskins that intinded to rub an beloike to
murther us too.  Sowl!  I hope it is that.  How long since I saw
it first?  Trath! it must be some considerable time.  I remimber
having four full naggins, an that's all gone off.  I wondher now
if them Indyins has come acrass av the dimmyjan?  I've heerd that
they're as fond of the crayther as if their skins was white.
Sowl! if they've smelt the jar there won't be a dhrap in it by
this time.  I'll jist slip back to the hut an see.  If thare's
any danger now it won't be from them.  By that tarin' gallop, I
cyan tell they've gone for good."</p>

<p>Once more emerging from the shadowy stall, he made his way
back towards the <i>jacale</i>.</p>

<p>He approached it with caption, stopping at intervals to assure
himself that no one was near.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the plausible hypothesis he had shaped out for
himself, he was still in dread of another encounter with the
headless horseman&mdash; who twice on his way to the hut might
now be inside of it.</p>

<p>But for the hope of finding a "dhrap" in the demijohn, he
would not have ventured back that night.  As it was, the desire
to obtain a drink was a trifle stronger than his fears; and
yielding to it, he stepped doubtfully into the darkness.</p>

<p>He made no attempt to rekindle the light.  Every inch of the
floor was familiar to him; and especially that corner where he
expected to find the demijohn.</p>

<p>He tried for it.  An exclamation uttered in a tone of
disappointment told that it was not there.</p>

<p>"Be dad!" muttered he, as he grumblingly groped about; "it
looks as if they'd been at it.  Av coorse they hav, else fwhy is
it not in its place?  I lift it thare&mdash;shure I lift it
thare."</p>

<p>"Ach, me jewel! an it's thare yez are yet," he continued, as
his hand came in contact with the wickerwork; "an' bad luck to
their imperence&mdash; impty as an eggshill!  Ach! ye greedy
gutted bastes!  If I'd a known yez were goin' to do that, I'd av
slipped a thrifle av shumach juice into the jar, an made raal
firewater av it for ye&mdash;jist fwhat yez wants. Divil burn ye
for a set av rid-skinned thieves, stalin' a man's liquor when
he's aslape!  Och-an-anee! fwhat am I to do now?  Go to slape
agane?  I don't belave I cyan, thinkin' av tham an the tother,
widout a thrifle av the crayther to comfort me.  An' thare isn't
a dhrap widin twenty&mdash;Fwhat&mdash;fwhat!  Howly Mary! Mother
av Moses!  Sant Pathrick and all the others to boot, fwhat am I
talkin' about?  The pewther flask&mdash; the pewther flask! Be
japers! it's in the thrunk&mdash;full to the very neck! Didn't I
fill it for Masther Maurice to take wid him the last time he went
to the sittlements?  And didn't he forget to take it?  Lard have
mercy on me!  If the Indyins have laid their dhirty claws upon
<i>that</i> I shall be afther takin' lave at me sinses."</p>

<p>"Hoo&mdash;hoop&mdash;hoorro!" he cried, after an interval of
silence, during which he could be heard fumbling among the
contents of the portmanteau. "Hoo&mdash;hoop&mdash;hoorro! thanks
to the Lord for all his mercies.  The rid-skins haven't been
cunnin' enough to look thare.  The flask as full as a
tick&mdash;not wan av them has had a finger on it.
Hoo&mdash;hoop&mdash;hoorro!"</p>

<p>For some seconds the discoverer of the spirituous treasure,
giving way to a joyous excitement, could be heard in the
darkness, dancing over the floor of the <i>jacale</i>.</p>

<p>Then there was an interval of silence, succeeded by the
screwing of a stopper, and after that a succession of "glucks,"
that proclaimed the rapid emptying of a narrow-necked vessel.</p>

<p>After a time this sound was suspended, to be replaced by a
repeated, smacking of lips, interlarded with grotesque
ejaculations.</p>

<p>Again came the gluck-gluck, again the smackings, and so on
alternately, till an empty flask was heard falling upon the
floor.</p>

<p>After that there were wild shouts&mdash;scraps of song
intermingled with cheers and laughter&mdash;incoherent ravings
about red Indians and headless horsemen, repeated over and over
again, each time in more subdued tones, till the maudlin
gibberish at length ended in loud continuous snoring!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch52"></a>CHAPTER FIFTY TWO.<br>

AN AWAKENER.</h2>

<p class="first">
PHELIM'S second slumber was destined to endure for a more
protracted term than his first.  It was nearly noon when he awoke
from it; and then only on receiving a bucket of cold water full
in his face, that sobered him almost as quickly as the sight of
the savages.</p>

<p>It was Zeb Stump who administered the <i>douche</i>.</p>

<p>After parting from the precincts of Casa del Corvo, the old
hunter had taken the road, or rather <i>trail</i>, which he knew
to be the most direct one leading to the head waters of the
Nueces.</p>

<p>Without staying to notice tracks or other "sign," he rode
straight across the prairie, and into the avenue already
mentioned.</p>

<p>Prom what Louise Poindexter had told him&mdash;from a
knowledge of the people who composed the party of
searchers&mdash;he knew that Maurice Gerald was in danger.</p>

<p>Hence his haste to reach the Alamo before them&mdash;coupled
with caution to keep out of their way.</p>

<p>He knew that if he came up with the Regulators, equivocation
would be a dangerous game; and, <i>nolens volens</i>, he should
be compelled to guide them to the dwelling of the suspected
murderer.</p>

<p>On turning the angle of the avenue, he had the chagrin to see
the searchers directly before him, clumped up in a crowd, and
apparently engaged in the examination of "sign."</p>

<p>At the same time he had the satisfaction to know that his
caution was rewarded, by himself remaining unseen.</p>

<p>"Durn them!" he muttered, with bitter emphasis.  "I mout a
know'd they'd a bin hyur.  I must go back an roun' the tother
way.  It'll deelay me better'n a hour.  Come, ole maar!  This air
an obstruckshun <i>you</i>, won't like.  It'll gi'e ye the
edition o' six more mile to yur journey. Ee-up, ole gal!  Roun'
an back we go!"</p>

<p>With a strong pull upon the rein, he brought the mare short
round, and rode back towards the embouchure of the avenue.</p>

<p>Once outside, he turned along the edge of the chapparal, again
entering it by the path which on the day before had been taken by
Diaz and his trio of confederates.  From this point he proceeded
without pause or adventure until he had descended to the Alamo
bottom-land, and arrived within a short distance, though still
out of sight of the mustanger's dwelling.</p>

<p>Instead of riding boldly up to it, he dismounted from his
mare; and leaving her behind him, approached the <i>jacale</i>
with his customary caution.</p>

<p>The horse-hide door was closed; but there was a large aperture
in the middle of it, where a portion of the skin had been cut
out.  What was the meaning of that?</p>

<p>Zeb could not answer the question, even by conjecture.</p>

<p>It increased his caution; and he continued his approach with
as much stealth, as if he had been stalking an antelope.</p>

<p>He kept round by the rear&mdash;so as to avail himself of the
cover afforded by the trees; and at length, having crouched into
the horse-shed at the back, he knelt down and listened.</p>

<p>There was an opening before his eyes; where one of the split
posts had been pushed out of place, and the skin tapestry torn
off.  He saw this with some surprise; but, before he could shape
any conjecture as to its cause, his ears were saluted with a
sonorous breathing, that came out through the aperture.  There
was also a snore, which he fancied he could recognise, as
proceeding from Irish nostrils.</p>

<p>A glance through the opening settled the point.  The sleeper
was Phelim.</p>

<p>There was an end to the necessity for stealthy manoeuvring.
The hunter rose to his feet, and stepping round to the front,
entered by the door&mdash; which he found unbolted.</p>

<p>He made no attempt to rouse the sleeper, until after he had
taken stock of the paraphernalia upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Thur's been packin' up for some purpiss," he observed, after
a cursory glance.  "Ah!  Now I reccollex.  The young fellur sayed
he war goin' to make a move from hyur some o' these days.  Thet
ere anymal air not only soun' asleep, but dead drunk.  Sartin he
air&mdash;drunk as Backis.  I kin tell that by the smell o' him.
I wonder if he hev left any o' the licker?  It air dewbious.  Not
a drop, dog-gone him!  Thur's the jar, wi' the stop plug out o'
it, lyin' on its side; an thur's the flask, too, in the same
preedikamint&mdash;both on 'em fall o' empiness.  Durn him for a
drunken cuss!  He kin suck up as much moister as a chalk
purayra.</p>

<p>"Spanish curds!  A hul pack on 'em scattered abeout the place.
What kin he ha' been doin' wi' them?  S'pose he's been havin' a
game o' sollatury along wi' his licker."</p>

<p>"But what's cut the hole in the door, an why's the tother
broken out at the back?  I reckon he kin tell.  I'll roust him,
an see.  Pheelum! Pheelum!"</p>

<p>Phelim made no reply.</p>

<p>"Pheelum, I say!  Pheelum!"</p>

<p>Still no reply.  Although the last summons was delivered in a
shout loud enough to have been heard half a mile off, there was
no sign made by the slumberer to show that he even heard it.</p>

<p>A rude shaking administered by Zeb had no better effect.  It
only produced a grunt, immediately succeeded by a return to the
same stentorous respiration.</p>

<p>"If 'twa'n't for his snorin' I mout b'lieve him to be dead. He
<i>air</i> dead drunk, an no mistake; intoxerkated to the very
eends o' his toe-nails.  Kickin' him 'ud be no use.  Dog-goned,
ef I don't try <i>this</i>."</p>

<p>The old hunter's eye, as he spoke, was resting upon a pail
that stood in a corner of the cabin.  It was full of water, which
Phelim, for some purpose, had fetched from the creek.
Unfortunately for himself, he had not wasted it.</p>

<p>With a comical expression in his eye, Zeb took up the pail;
and swilled the whole of its contents right down upon the
countenance of the sleeper.</p>

<p>It had the effect intended.  If not quite sobered, the
inebriate was thoroughly awakened; and the string of terrified
ejaculations that came from his lips formed a contrasting
accompaniment to the loud cachinnations of the hunter.</p>

<p>It was some time before sufficient tranquillity was restored,
to admit of the two men entering upon a serious conversation.</p>

<p>Phelim, however, despite his chronic inebriety, was still
under the influence of his late fears, and was only too glad to
see Zeb Stump, notwithstanding the unceremonious manner in which
he had announced himself.</p>

<p>As soon as an understanding was established between them, and
without waiting to be questioned, he proceeded to relate in
detail, as concisely as an unsteady tongue and disordered brain
would permit, the series of strange sights and incidents that had
almost deprived him of his senses.</p>

<p>It was the first that Zeb Stump had heard of the <i>Headless
Horseman</i>.</p>

<p>Although the report concerning this imperfect personage was
that morning broadly scattered around Fort Inge, and along the
Leona, Zeb, having passed through the settlement at an early
hour, and stopped only at Casa del Corvo, had not chanced upon
any one who could have communicated such a startling item of
intelligence.  In fact, he had exchanged speech only with Pluto
and Louise Poindexter; neither of whom had at that time heard
anything of the strange creature encountered, on the evening
before, by the party of searchers.  The planter, for some reason
or another, had been but little communicative, and his daughter
had not held converse with any of the others.</p>

<p>At first Zeb was disposed to ridicule the idea of a man
without a head. He called it "a fantassy of Pheelum's brain,
owin' to his havin' tuk too much of the corn-juice."</p>

<p>He was puzzled, however, by Phelim's persistence in declaring
it to be a fact&mdash;more especially when he reflected on the
other circumstances known to him.</p>

<p>"Arrah, now, how could I be mistaken?" argued the Irishman.
"Didn't I see Masther Maurice, as plain as I see yourself at this
minnit?  All except the hid, and that I had a peep at as he
turned to gallop away. Besides, thare was the Mexican blanket, an
the saddle wid the rid cloth, and the wather guards av spotted
skin; and who could mistake that purty horse?  An' havn't I towld
yez that Tara went away afther him, an thin I heerd the dog
gowlin', jist afore the Indyins&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Injuns!" exclaimed the hunter, with a contemptuous toss of
the head. "Injuns playin' wi' Spanish curds!  White Injuns, I
reck'n."</p>

<p>"Div yez think they waren't Indyins, afther all?"</p>

<p>"Ne'er a matter what I think.  Thur's no time to talk o' that
now.  Go on, an tell me o' all ye seed an heern."</p>

<p>When Phelim had at length unburdened his mind, Zeb ceased to
question him; and, striding out of the hut, squatted down, Indian
fashion, upon the grass.</p>

<p>His object was, as he said himself, to have "a good think;"
which, he had often declared, he could not obtain while "hampered
wi' a house abeout him."</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say, that the story told by the
Galwegian groom only added to the perplexity he already
experienced.</p>

<p>Hitherto there was but the disappearance of Henry Poindexter
to be accounted for; now there was the additional circumstance of
the non-return of the mustanger to his hut&mdash;when it was
known that he had started for it, and should, according to a
notice given to his servant, have been there at an early hour on
the day before.</p>

<p>Far more mystifying was the remarkable story of his being seen
riding about the prairie without a head, or with one carried in
his hands! This last might be a trick.  What else could it
be?</p>

<p>Still was it a strange time for tricks&mdash;when a man had
been murdered, and half the population of the settlement wore out
upon the track of the murderer&mdash;more especially improbable,
that the supposed assassin should be playing them!</p>

<p>Zeb Stump had to deal with, a difficult concatenation&mdash;or
rather conglomeration of circumstances&mdash;events without
causes&mdash;causes without sequence&mdash;crimes committed
without any probable motive&mdash;mysteries that could only be
explained by an appeal to the supernatural.</p>

<p>A midnight meeting between Maurice Gerald and Louise
Poindexter&mdash;a quarrel with her brother, occasioned by the
discovery&mdash;Maurice having departed for the
prairies&mdash;Henry having followed to sue for
forgiveness&mdash;in all this the sequence was natural and
complete.</p>

<p>Beyond began the chapter of confusions and contradictions.</p>

<p>Zeb Stump knew the disposition of Maurice Gerald in regard to
Henry Poindexter.  More than once he had heard the mustanger
speak of the young planter.  Instead of having a hostility
towards him, he had frequently expressed admiration of his
ingenuous and generous character.</p>

<p>That he could have changed from being his friend to become his
assassin, was too improbable for belief.  Only by the evidence of
his eyes could Zeb Stump have been brought to believe it.</p>

<p>After spending a full half hour at his "think," he had made
but little progress towards unravelling the network of cognate,
yet unconnected, circumstances.  Despite an intellect unusually
clear, and the possession of strong powers of analysis, he was
unable to reach any rational solution of this mysterious drama of
many acts.</p>

<p>The only thing clear to him was, that four mounted
men&mdash;he did not believe them to be Indians&mdash;had been
making free with the mustanger's hut; and that it was most
probable that these had something to do with the murder that had
been committed.  But the presence of these men at the
<i>jacale</i>, coupled with the protracted absence of its owner,
conducted his conjectures to a still more melancholy conclusion:
that more than one man had fallen a sacrifice to the assassin,
and that the thicket might be searched for two bodies, instead of
one!</p>

<p>A groan escaped from the bosom of the backwoodsman as this
conviction forced itself upon his mind.  He entertained for the
young Irishman a peculiar affection&mdash;strong almost as that
felt by a father for his son; and the thought that he had been
foully assassinated in some obscure corner of the chapparal, his
flesh to be torn by the beak of the buzzard and the teeth of the
coyote, stirred the old hunter to the very core of his heart.</p>

<p>He groaned again, as he reflected upon it; until, without
action, he could no longer bear the agonising thought, and,
springing to his feet, he strode to and fro over the ground,
proclaiming, in loud tones, his purpose of vengeance.</p>

<p>So absorbed was he with his sorrowful indignation, that he saw
not the staghound as it came skulking up to the hut.</p>

<p>It was not until he heard Phelim caressing the hound in his
grotesque Irish fashion, that he became aware of the creature's
presence.  And then he remained indifferent to it, until a shout
of surprise, coupled with his own name, attracted his
attention.</p>

<p>"What is it, Pheelum?  What's wrong?  Hes a snake bit ye?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Misther Stump, luk at Tara!  See! thare's somethin' tied
about his neck.  It wasn't there when he lift.  What do yez think
it is?"</p>

<p>The hunter's eyes turned immediately upon the hound.  Sure
enough there was something around the animal's neck: a piece of
buckskin thong.  But there was something besides&mdash;a tiny
packet attached to the thong, and hanging underneath the
throat!</p>

<p>Zeb drawing his knife, glided towards the dog.  The creature
recoiled in fear.</p>

<p>A little coaxing convinced him that there was no hostile
intent; and he came up again.</p>

<p>The thong was severed, the packet laid open; it contained a
<i>card</i>!</p>

<p>There was a name upon the card, and writing&mdash;writing in
what appeared to be red ink; but it was <i>blood</i>!</p>

<p>The rudest backwoodsman knows how to read.  Even Zeb Stump was
no exception; and he soon deciphered the characters traced upon
the bit of pasteboard.</p>

<p>As he finished, a cry rose from his lips, in strange contrast
with the groans he had been just uttering.  It was a shout of
gladness, of joy!</p>

<p>"Thank the Almighty for this!" he added; "and thank my ole
Katinuck schoolmaster for puttin' me clar through my Webster's
spellin'-book.  He lives, Pheelum! he lives!  Look at this.  Oh,
<i>you</i> can't read.  No matter.  He lives! he lives!"</p>

<p>"Who?  Masther Maurice?  Thin the Lord be thanked&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wagh! thur's no time to thank him now.  Get a blanket an some
pieces o' horse-hide thong.  Ye kin do it while I catch up the
ole maar.  Quick! Helf an hour lost, an we may be too late!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch53"></a>CHAPTER FIFTY THREE.<br>

JUST IN TIME.</h2>

<p class="first">
"HALF-an-hour lost, and we may be too late!"</p>

<p>They were the last words of the hunter, as he hurried away
from the hut.</p>

<p>They were true, except as to the time.  Had he said half-a-
minute, he would have been nearer the mark.  Even at the moment
of their utterance, the man, whose red writing had summoned
assistance, was once more in dread danger&mdash;once more
surrounded by the coyotes.</p>

<p>But it was not these he had need to fear.  A far more
formidable foe was threatening his destruction.</p>

<p>Maurice Gerald&mdash;by this time recognised as the man in the
cloak and Panama hat&mdash;after doing battle with the wolves, as
already described, and being rescued by his faithful Tara, had
fought repose in sleep.</p>

<p>With full confidence in the ability of his canine companion to
protect him against the black birds, or the more dangerous
quadrupeds, with which he had been in conflict, he soon found,
and for several hours enjoyed it.</p>

<p>He awoke of his own accord.  Finding his strength much
restored, he once more turned his attention to the perils that
surrounded him.</p>

<p>The dog had rescued him from the jackals, and would still
protect him against their attacks, should they see fit to renew
it.  But to what end?  The faithful creature could not transport
him from the spot; and to stay there would be to die of
hunger&mdash;perhaps of the wounds he had received?</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, but found that he could not stand
upright. Feebleness was now added to his other infirmity; and
after struggling a pace or two, he was glad to return to a
recumbent position.</p>

<p>At this crisis a happy thought occurred to him.  Tara might
take a message to the hut!</p>

<p>"If I could but get him to go," said he, as he turned
inquiringly towards the dog.  "Come hither, old fellow!" he
continued, addressing himself to the dumb animal; "I want you to
play postman for me&mdash;to carry a letter.  You understand?
Wait till I've got it written.  I shall then explain myself more
fully."</p>

<p>"By good luck I've got a card," he added, feeling for his
case.  "No pencil!  That don't matter.  There's plenty of ink
around; and for a pen I can use the thorn of yonder maguey."</p>

<p>He crept up to the plant thus designated; broke off one of the
long spines terminating its great leaves; dipped it in the blood
of a coyote that lay near; and drawing forth a card, traced some
characters upon it.</p>

<p>With a strip of thong, the card was then attached to the neck
of the staghound, after being wrapped up in a piece of oilcloth
torn from the lining of the Panama hat.</p>

<p>It only remained to despatch the canine post upon his errand.
This proved a somewhat difficult task.  The dumb creature,
despite a wondrous intelligence, could not comprehend why he
should forsake the side of one he had so faithfully befriended;
and for a long time resisted the coaxings and chidings, meant to
warn him away.</p>

<p>It was only after being scolded in a tone of assumed anger,
and beaten by the black-jack crutch&mdash;stricken by the man
whose life he had so lately saved, that he had consented to leave
the spot.  Even canine affection could not endure this; and with
repeated looks of reproach, cast backwards as he was chased off,
he trotted reluctantly into the chapparal.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" soliloquised Maurice, as the dog disappeared
from his view.  "'Tis like boating one's self, or one's dearest
friend!  Well, I shall make up for it in extra kindness if I have
the good fortune to see him again.</p>

<p>"And now, that he is gone, I must provide against the coming
back of these villainous coyotes.  They will be sure to come,
once they discover that I'm alone."</p>

<p>A scheme had been already considered.</p>

<p>A tree stood near&mdash;the pecan already alluded
to&mdash;having two stout branches that extended horizontally and
together, at six or seven feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Taking off his cloak, and spreading it out upon the grass,
with his knife he cut a row of holes along each edge.</p>

<p>Then unwinding from his waist the sash of china crape, he tore
it up the middle, so as to make two strips, each several yards
long.</p>

<p>The cloak was now extended between the branches, and fast tied
by the strips of crape&mdash;thus forming a sort of hammock
capable of containing the body of a man laid out at full
length.</p>

<p>The maker of it knew that the coyotes are not tree climbers;
and, reclining on his suspended couch, he could observe with
indifference their efforts to assail him.</p>

<p>He took all this trouble, feeling certain they would return.
If he had any doubt, it was soon set at rest, by seeing them, one
after the other, come skulking out of the chapparal, lopping a
pace or two, at intervals, pausing to reconnoitre, and then
advancing towards the scene of their late conflict.</p>

<p>Emboldened by the absence of the enemy most dreaded by them,
the pack was soon reassembled, once more exhibiting the truculent
ferocity for which these cowardly creatures are celebrated.</p>

<p>It was first displayed in a very unnatural manner&mdash;by the
devouring of their own dead&mdash;which was done in less time
than it would have taken the spectator in the tree to have
counted a score.</p>

<p>To him their attention was next directed.  In swinging his
hammock, he had taken no pains to conceal it.  He had suspended
it high enough to be out of their reach; and that he deemed
sufficient for his purpose.</p>

<p>The cloak of dark cloth was conspicuous, as well as the figure
outlined within it.  The coyotes clustered underneath&mdash;their
appetites whetted by the taste of blood.  It was a sight to see
them lick their red lips after their unnatural repast&mdash;a
fearful sight!</p>

<p>He who saw it scarce regarded them&mdash;not even when they
were springing up to lay hold of his limbs, or at times
attempting to ascend by the trunk of the tree!  He supposed there
was no danger.</p>

<p>There <i>was</i> danger, however, on which he had not
reckoned; and not till the coyotes have desisted from their idle
attempts, and stretched themselves, panting, under the tree, did
he begin to perceive it.</p>

<p>Of all the wild denizens, either of prairie or chapparal, the
coyote is that possessed of the greatest cunning.  The trapper
will tell you it is the "cunningest varmint in creation."  It is
a fox in astuteness&mdash;a wolf in ferocity.  It may be tamed,
but it will turn at any time to tear the hand that caresses it. A
child can scare it with a stick, but a disabled man may dread its
attack.  Alone it has the habit of a hare; but in packs&mdash;and
it hunts only in packs&mdash;its poltroonery is less observable;
sometimes under the influence of extreme hunger giving place to a
savageness of disposition that assumes the semblance of
courage.</p>

<p>It is the coyotes' cunning that is most to be feared; and it
was this that had begun to excite fresh apprehension in the mind
of the mustanger.</p>

<p>On discovering that they could not reach him&mdash;a discovery
they were not long in making&mdash;instead of scattering off from
the spot, the wolves, one and all, squatted down upon the grass;
while others, stragglers from the original troop, were still
coming into the glade.  He saw that they intended a siege.</p>

<p>This should not have troubled him, seeing that he was secure
in his suspended couch.</p>

<p>Nor would it, but for another source of trouble, every moment
making itself more manifest&mdash;that from which he had so
lately had such a narrow escape.  He was once more on the eve of
being tortured by thirst.</p>

<p>He blamed himself for having been so simple, as not to think
of this before climbing up to the tree.  He might easily have
carried up a supply of water.  The stream was there; and for want
of a better vessel, the concave blades of the maguey would have
served as a cistern.</p>

<p>His self-reproaches came too late.  The water was under his
eyes, only to tantalise him; and by so doing increase his
eagerness to obtain it. He could not return to the stream,
without running the gauntlet of the coyotes, and that would be
certain death.  He had but faint hopes that the hound would
return and rescue him a second time&mdash;fainter still that his
message would reach the man for whom it was intended.  A hundred
to one against that.</p>

<p>Thirst is quick in coming to a man whose veins are half-
emptied of their blood.  The torture proclaimed itself apace. How
long was it to continue?</p>

<p>This time it was accompanied by a straying of the senses.  The
wolves, from being a hundred, seemed suddenly to have increased
their number tenfold.  A thousand appeared to encompass the tree,
filling the whole ground of the glade!  They came nearer and
nearer.  Their eyes gave out a lurid light.  Their red tongues
lapped the hanging cloth; they tore it with their teeth.  He
could feel their fetid breath, as they sprang up among the
branches!</p>

<p>A lucid interval told him that it was all fancy.  The wolves
were still there; but only a hundred of them&mdash;as before,
reclining upon the grass, pitiably awaiting a crisis!  It came
before the period of lucidity had departed; to the spectator
unexpected as inexplicable.  He saw the coyotes suddenly spring
to their feet, and rush off into the thicket, until not one
remained within the glade.</p>

<p>Was this, too, a fancy?  He doubted the correctness of his
vision.  He had begun to believe that his brain was
distempered.</p>

<p>But it was clear enough now.  There were no coyotes.  What
could have frightened them off?</p>

<p>A cry of joy was sent forth from his lips, as he conjectured a
cause. Tara had returned?  Perhaps Phelim along with him?  There
had been time enough for the delivery of the message.  For two
hours he had been besieged by the coyotes.</p>

<p>He turned upon his knee, and bending over the branch, scanned
the circle around him.  Neither hound nor henchman was in sight.
Nothing but branches and bushes!</p>

<p>He listened.  No sound, save an occasional howl, sent back by
the coyotes that still seemed to continue their retreat!  More
than ever was it like an illusion.  What could have caused their
scampering?</p>

<p>No matter.  The coast was clear.  The streamlet could now be
approached without danger.  Its water sparkled under his
eyes&mdash;its rippling sounded sweet to his ears.</p>

<p>Descending from the tree, he staggered towards its bank, and
reached it.</p>

<p>Before stooping to drink, he once more looked around him. Even
the agony of thirst could not stifle the surprise, still fresh in
his thoughts.  To what was he indebted for his strange
deliverance?</p>

<p>Despite his hope that it might be the hound, he had an
apprehension of danger.</p>

<p>One glance, and he was certain of it.  The spotted yellow skin
shining among the leaves&mdash;the long, lithe form crawling like
a snake out of the underwood was not to be mistaken.  It was the
tiger of the New World&mdash; scarce less dreaded than his
congener of the Old&mdash;the dangerous jaguar.</p>

<p>Its presence accounted for the retreat of the coyotes.</p>

<p>Neither could its intent be mistaken.  It, too, had scented
blood, and was hastening to the spot where blood had been
sprinkled, with that determined air that told it would not be
satisfied till after partaking of the banquet.</p>

<p>Its eyes were upon him, who had descended from the
tree&mdash;its steps were towards him&mdash;now in slow,
crouching gait; but quicker and quicker, as if preparing for a
spring.</p>

<p>To retreat to the tree would have been sheer folly.  The
jaguar can climb like a cat.  The mustanger knew this.</p>

<p>But even had he been ignorant of it, it would have been all
the same, as the thing was no longer possible.  The animal had
already passed that tree, upon which he had found refuge, and
there was t'other near that could be reached in time.</p>

<p>He had no thought of climbing to a tree&mdash;no thought of
any thing, so confused were his senses&mdash;partly from present
surprise, partly from the bewilderment already within his
brain.</p>

<p>It was a simple act of unreasoning impulse that led him to
rush on into the stream, until he stood up to his waist in the
water.</p>

<p>Had he reasoned, he would have known that this would do
nothing to secure his safety.  If the jaguar climbs like a cat,
it also swims with the ease of an otter; and is as much to be
dreaded in the water as upon the land.</p>

<p>Maurice made no such reflection.  He suspected that the little
pool, towards the centre of which he had waded, would prove but
poor protection.  He was sure of it when the jaguar, arriving
upon the bank above him, set itself in that cowering attitude
that told of its intention to spring.</p>

<p>In despair he steadied himself to receive the onset of the
fierce animal.</p>

<p>He had nought wherewith to repel it&mdash;no knife&mdash;no
pistol&mdash;no weapon of any kind&mdash;not even his crutch!  A
struggle with his bare arms could but end in his destruction.</p>

<p>A wild cry went forth from his lips, as the tawny form was
about launching itself for the leap.</p>

<p>There was a simultaneous scream from the jaguar.  Something
appeared suddenly to impede it; and instead of alighting on the
body of its victim, it fell short, with a dead plash upon the
water!</p>

<p>Like an echo of his own, a cry came from the chapparal, close
following a sound that had preceded it&mdash;the sharp "spang" of
a rifle.</p>

<p>A huge dog broke through the bushes, and sprang with a plunge
into the pool where the jaguar had sunk below the surface.  A man
of colossal size advanced rapidly towards the bank; another of
lesser stature treading close upon his heels, and uttering joyful
shouts of triumph.</p>

<p>To the wounded man these sights and sounds were more like a
vision than the perception of real phenomena.  They were the last
thoughts of that day that remained in his memory.  His reason,
kept too long upon the rack, had given way.  He tried to strangle
the faithful hound that swam fawningly around him and struggled
against the strong arms that, raising him out of the water, bore
him in friendly embrace to the bank!</p>

<p>His mind had passed from a horrid reality, to a still more
horrid dream&mdash;the dream of delirium.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch54"></a>CHAPTER FIFTY FOUR.<br>

A PRAIRIE PALANQUIN.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE friendly arms, flung around Maurice Gerald, were those of
Zeb Stump.</p>

<p>Guided by the instructions written upon the card, the hunter
had made all haste towards the rendezvous there given.</p>

<p>He had arrived within sight, and fortunately within rifle-
range of the spot, at that critical moment when the jaguar was
preparing to spring.</p>

<p>His bullet did not prevent the fierce brute from making the
bound&mdash;the last of its life&mdash;though it had passed right
through the animal's heart.</p>

<p>This was a thing thought of afterwards&mdash;there was no
opportunity then.</p>

<p>On rushing into the water, to make sure that his shot had
proved fatal, the hunter was himself attacked; not by the claws
of the jaguar, but the hands of the man just rescued from
them.</p>

<p>Fortunate for Zeb, that the mustanger's knife had been left
upon land. As it was, he came near being throttled; and only
after throwing aside his rifle, and employing all his strength,
was he able to protect himself against the unlooked-for
assault.</p>

<p>A struggle ensued, which ended in Zeb flinging his colossal
arms around the young Irishman, and bearing him bodily to the
bank.</p>

<p>It was not all over.  As soon as the latter was relieved from
the embrace, he broke away and made for the pecan tree;&mdash;as
rapidly as if the injured limb no longer impeded him.</p>

<p>The hunter suspected his intent.  Standing over six feet, he
saw the bloody knife-blade lying along the cloak.  It was for
that the mustanger was making!</p>

<p>Zeb bounded after; and once more enfolding the madman in his
bear-like embrace, drew him back from the tree.</p>

<p>"Speel up thur, Pheelum!" shouted he.  "Git that thing out o'
sight. The young fellur hev tuck leeve o' his seven senses.
Thur's fever in the feel o' him.  He air gone dullerious!"</p>

<p>Phelim instantly obeyed; and, scrambling up the tree-trunk
took possession of the knife.</p>

<p>Still the struggle was not over.  The delirious man wrestled
with his rescuer&mdash;not in silence, but with shouts and
threatening speeches&mdash;his eyes all the time rolling and
glaring with a fierce, demoniac light.</p>

<p>For full ten minutes did he continue the mad wrestling
match.</p>

<p>At length from sheer exhaustion he sank back upon the grass;
and after a few tremulous shiverings, accompanied by sighs heaved
from the very bottom of his breast, he lay still, as if the last
spark of life had departed from his body!</p>

<p>The Galwegian, believing it so, began uttering a series of
lugubrious cries&mdash;the "keen" of Connemara.</p>

<p>"Stop yur gowlin, ye durned cuss!" cried Zeb.  "It air enuf to
scare the breath out o' his karkidge.  He's no more dead than you
air&mdash;only fented.  By the way he hev fit me, I reck'n there
ain't much the matter wi' him.  No," he continued, after stooping
down and giving a short examination, "I kin see no wound worth
makin' a muss about.  Thur's a consid'able swellin' o' the knee;
but the leg ain't fructered, else he kudn't a stud up on it.  As
for them scratches, they ain't much.  What kin they be?  'Twarnt
the jegwur that gin them.  They air more like the claws o' a tom
cat.  Ho, ho!  I sees now.  Thur's been a bit o' a skrimmage
afore the spotted beest kim up.  The young fellur's been attakted
by coyoats!  Who'd a surposed that the cowardly varmints would a
had the owdacity to attakt a human critter?  But they
<i>will</i>, when they gits the chance o' one krippled as he
air&mdash;durn 'em!"</p>

<p>The hunter had all the talking to himself.  Phelim, now
overjoyed to know that his master still lived&mdash;and
furthermore was in no danger of dying&mdash;suddenly changed his
melancholy whine to a jubilant hullaballoo, and commenced dancing
over the ground, all the while snapping his fingers in the most
approved Connemara fashion.</p>

<p>His frenzied action provoked the hound to a like pitch of
excitement; and the two became engaged in a sort of wild Irish
jig.</p>

<p>Zeb took no notice of these grotesque demonstrations; but,
once more bending over the prostrate form, proceeded to complete
the examination already begun.</p>

<p>Becoming satisfied that there was no serious wound, he rose to
his feet, and commenced taking stock of the odd articles around
him.  He had already noticed the Panama hat, that still adhered
to the head of the mustanger; and a strange thought at seeing it
there, had passed through his mind.</p>

<p>Hats of Guayaquil grass&mdash;erroneously called
Panama&mdash;were not uncommon. Scores of Southerners wore them,
in Texas as elsewhere.  But he knew that the young Irishman was
accustomed to carry a Mexican <i>sombrero</i>&mdash;a very
different kind of head-gear.  It was possible he might have seen
fit to change the fashion.</p>

<p>Still, as Zeb continued to gaze upon it, he fancied he had
seen <i>that</i> hat before, and on some other head.</p>

<p>It was not from any suspicion of its being honestly in
possession of him now wearing it that the hunter stooped down,
and took it off with the design to examine it.  His object was
simply to obtain some explanation of the mystery, or series of
mysteries, hitherto baffling his brain.</p>

<p>On looking inside the hat he read two names; first, that of a
New Orleans hatter, whose card was pasted in the crown; and then,
in writing, another well known to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"HENRY POINDEXTER."</p>

<p>The cloak now came under his notice.  It, too, carried marks,
by which he was able to identify it as belonging to the same
owner.</p>

<p>"Dog-goned kewrious, all this!" muttered the backwoodsman, as
he stood with his eyes turned upon the ground, and apparently
buried in a profound reflection.</p>

<p>"Hats, heads, an everythin'.  Hats on the wrong head; heads i'
the wrong place!  By the 'tarnal thur's somethin' goed astray! Ef
'twa'nt that I feel a putty consid'able smartin' whar the young
fellur gin me a lick over the left eye, I mout be arter believin'
my own skull-case wa'nt any longer atween my shoulders!"</p>

<p>"It air no use lookin' to him," he added, glancing towards
Maurice, "for an explanation; leastwise till he's slep' off this
dullerium thet's on him.  When that'll be, ole Nick only
knows.</p>

<p>"Wal," he continued after another interval spent in silent
reflection, "It won't do no good our stayin' hyur.  We must git
him to the shanty, an that kin only be did by toatin' him.  He
sayed on the curd, he cudn't make neer a track.  It war only the
anger kep' him up a bit.  That leg looks wusser and wusser.  He's
boun to be toated."</p>

<p>The hunter seemed to cogitate on how he was to effect this
purpose.</p>

<p>"'Taint no good expektin' <i>him</i> to help think it out," he
continued looking at the Galwegian, who was busy talking to Tara.
"The dumb brute hev more sense than he.  Neer a mind.  I'd make
him take his full share o' the carryin' when it kum to thet.  How
air it to be done?  We must git him on a streetcher.  That I
reck'n we kin make out o' a kupple o' poles an the cloak; or wi'
the blanket Pheelum fetch'd from the shanty. Ye-es! a streetcher.
That's the eydentikul eyedee."</p>

<p>The Connemara man was now summoned to lend assistance.  Two
saplings of at least ten feet in length were cut from the
chapparal, and trimmed clear of twigs.  Two shorter ones were
also selected, and lashed crosswise over the first; and upon
these there spread, first the serape, and afterwards the cloak,
to give greater strength.</p>

<p>In this way a rude stretcher was constructed, capable of
carrying either an invalid or an inebriate.</p>

<p>In the mode of using it, it more resembled the latter than the
former: since he who was to be borne upon it, again deliriously
raging, had to be strapped to the trestles!</p>

<p>Unlike the ordinary stretcher, it was not carried between two
men; but a man and a mare&mdash;the mare at the head, the man
bearing behind.</p>

<p>It was he of Connemara who completed the ill-matched team. The
old hunter had kept his promise, that Phelim should "take his
full share o' the carryin', when it kum to thet."</p>

<p>He was taking it, or rather getting it&mdash;Zeb having
appointed himself to the easier post of conductor.</p>

<p>The idea was not altogether original.  It was a rude copy from
the Mexican <i>litera</i>, which in Southern Texas Zeb may have
seen&mdash;differing from the latter only in being without
screen, and instead of two mules, having for its <i>atelage</i> a
mare and a man!</p>

<p>In this improvised palanquin was Maurice Gerald transported to
his dwelling.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">IT was night when the grotesque-looking group arrived at the <i>locale</i>.</p>

<p>In strong but tender arms the wounded man was transferred from
the stretcher to the skin couch, on which he had been accustomed
to repose.</p>

<p>He was unconscious of where he was, and knew not the friendly
faces bending over him.  His thoughts were still astray, though
no longer exciting him to violent action.  He was experiencing an
interval of calm.</p>

<p>He was not silent; though he made no reply to the kind
questions addressed to him, or only answered them with an
inconsequence that might have provoked mirth.  But there were
wild words upon his lips that forbade it&mdash;suggesting only
serious thoughts.</p>

<p>His wounds received such rude dressing as his companions were
capable of administering to them; and nothing more could be done
but await the return of day.</p>

<p>Phelim went to sleep upon his shake-down; while the other sate
up to keep watch by the bedside of the sufferer.</p>

<p>It was not from any unfaithfulness on the part of the foster-
brother, that he seemed thus to disregard his duty; but simply
because Zeb had requested him to lie down&mdash;telling him there
was no occasion for both to remain awake.</p>

<p>The old hunter had his reasons.  He did not desire that those
wild words should be heard even by Phelim.  Better he should
listen to them alone.</p>

<p>And alone he sate listening to them&mdash;throughout the live-
long night.</p>

<p>He heard speeches that surprised him, and names that did not.
He was not surprised to hear the name "Louise" often repeated,
and coupled with fervent protestations of love.</p>

<p>But there was another name also often pronounced&mdash;with
speeches less pleasant to his ear.</p>

<p>It was the name of Louise's brother.</p>

<p>The speeches were disjointed&mdash;incongruous, and almost
unintelligible.</p>

<p>Comparing one with the other, however, and assisted by the
circumstances already known to him, before the morning light had
entered the <i>jacale</i>, Zeb Stump had come to the conclusion:
that Henry Poindexter was no longer a living man!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch55"></a>CHAPTER FIFTY FIVE.<br>

UN DIA DE NOVEDADES.</h2>

<p class="first">
DON SILVIO MARTINEz was one of the few Mexican <i>ricos</i>,
who had chosen to remain in Texas, after the conquest of that
country by the stalwart colonisers from the North.</p>

<p>A man of more than mature age, of peaceful habits, and taking
no part in politics, he accepted the new situation without any
great regret.  He was the more easily reconciled to it, from a
knowledge, that his loss of nationality was better than
counterbalanced by his gain of security against Comanche
incursions; which, previous to the coming of the new colonists,
had threatened the complete depopulation of the country.</p>

<p>The savage was not yet entirely subdued; but his maraud was
now intermittent, and occurred only at long intervals.  Even this
was an improvement on the old <i>regime</i>.</p>

<p>Don Silvio was a <i>ganadero</i>,&mdash;a grazier, on a grand
scale.  So grand that his <i>ganaderia</i> was leagues in length
and breadth, and contained within its limits many thousands of
horses and horned cattle.</p>

<p>He lived in a large rectangular one-storied house&mdash;more
resembling a jail than a dwelling&mdash;surrounded by extensive
enclosures&mdash;<i>corrales</i>.</p>

<p>It was usually a quiet place; except during the time of the
<i>herradero</i>, or cattle-branding; when for days it became the
scene of a festivity almost Homeric.</p>

<p>These occasions were only of annual occurrence.</p>

<p>At all other times the old haciendado&mdash;who was a bachelor
to boot&mdash;led a tranquil and somewhat solitary life; a sister
older than himself being his only companion.  There were
occasional exceptions to this rule: when his charming
<i>sobrina</i> rode across from the Rio Grande to pay him and his
sister a visit.  Then the domicile of Don Silvio became a little
more lively.</p>

<p>Isidora was welcome whenever she came; welcome to come and go
when she pleased; and do as she pleased, while under her uncle's
roof.  The sprightliness of her character was anything but
displeasing to the old haciendado; who was himself far from being
of a sombre disposition. Those traits, that might have appeared
masculine in many other lands, were not so remarkable in one,
where life is held by such precarious tenure; where the country
house is oft transformed into a fortress, and the domestic hearth
occasionally bedewed with the blood of its inmates!</p>

<p>Is it surprising that in such a land women should be found,
endowed with those qualities that have been ascribed to Isidora?
If so, it is not the less true that they exist.</p>

<p>As a general thing the Mexican woman is a creature of the most
amiable disposition; <i>douce</i>&mdash;if we may be allowed to
borrow from a language that deals more frequently with feminine
traits&mdash;to such an extent, as to have become a national
characteristic.  It is to the denizens of the great cities,
secure from Indian incursion, that this character more especially
applies.  On the frontiers, harried for the last half century by
the aboriginal freebooter, the case is somewhat different.  The
amiability still exists; but often combined with a
<i>bravourie</i> and hardihood masculine in seeming, but in
reality heroic.</p>

<p>Since Malinche, more than one fair heroine has figured in the
history of Anahuac.</p>

<p>Don Silvio Martinez had himself assisted at many a wild scene
and ceremony.  His youth had been passed amid perils; and the
courage of Isidora&mdash;at times degenerating into absolute
recklessness&mdash;so far from offending, rather gave him
gratification.</p>

<p>The old gentleman loved his darling <i>sobrina</i>, as if she
had been his own child; and had she been so, she would not have
been more certain of succeeding to his possessions.</p>

<p>Every one knew, that, when Don Silvio Martinez should take
leave of life, Isidora Covarubio de los Llanos would be the owner
of&mdash;not his broad acres, but&mdash;his <i>leagues</i> of
land, as also his thousands of horses and horned cattle.</p>

<p>With this understanding, it is needless to say, that the
señorita carried respect with her wherever she went, or that the
vassals of the Hacienda Martinez honoured her as their future
mistress.</p>

<p>Independently of this was she regarded.  Hers were just the
qualities to win the esteem of the dashing <i>rancheros</i>; and
there was not one upon the estate, but would have drawn his
<i>machete</i> at her nod, and used it to the shedding of
blood.</p>

<p>Miguel Diaz spoke the truth, when he said he was in danger.
Well might he believe it.  Had it pleased Isidora to call
together her uncle's <i>vaqueros</i>, and send them to chastise
him, it would have been speedily done&mdash;even to hanging him
upon the nearest tree!</p>

<p>No wonder he had made such haste to get away from the
glade.</p>

<p>As already stated, the real home of Isidora was upon the other
side of the Rio Grande&mdash;separated by some three-score miles
from the Hacienda Martinez.  But this did not hinder her from
paying frequent visits to her relations upon the Leona.</p>

<p>There was no selfishness in the motive.  The prospect of the
rich inheritance had nothing to do with it.  She was an expectant
heiress without that: for her own father was a <i>rico</i>.  But
she liked the company of her uncle and aunt.  She also enjoyed
the ride from river to river&mdash;oft made by her between
morning and night, and not unfrequently alone!</p>

<p>Of late these visits had become of much more frequent
occurrence.</p>

<p>Had she grown fonder of the society of her Texan
relatives&mdash;fonder as they grew older?  If not, what was her
motive?</p>

<p>Imitating her own frankness of character, it may at once be
declared.</p>

<p>She came oftener to the Leona, in the hope of meeting with
Maurice Gerald.</p>

<p>With like frankness may it be told, that she <i>loved</i>
him.</p>

<p>Beyond doubt, the young Irishman was in possession of her
heart.  As already known, he had won it by an act of friendship;
though it may have been less the service he had done, than the
gallantry displayed in doing it, that had put the love-spell on
the daring Isidora.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, she saw in him other captivating qualities, less
easily defined.  Whether these had been undesignedly exhibited,
or with the intention to effect a conquest, he alone can tell. He
has himself said, No; and respect is due to his declaration. But
it is difficult to believe, that mortal man could have gazed into
the eyes of Isidora de los Llanos without wishing them to look
longingly upon him.</p>

<p>Maurice may have spoken the truth; but we could better believe
him, had he seen Louise Poindexter before becoming acquainted
with Isidora.</p>

<p>The episode of the burnt prairie was several weeks subsequent
to the adventure with the intoxicated Indians.</p>

<p>Certainly something appears to have occurred between him and
the Mexican maiden, that leads her to believe she has a
hope&mdash;if not a claim&mdash;upon his affections.</p>

<p>It has come to that crisis, that she can no longer rest
satisfied.  Her impulsive spirit cannot brook ambiguity.  She
knows that she loves <i>him</i>.  She has determined to make
frank confession of it; and to ask with like frankness whether
her passion be reciprocated.  Hence her having made an
appointment that could not be kept.</p>

<p>For that day Don Miguel Diaz had interfered between her and
her purpose.</p>

<p>So thought she, as she galloped out of the glade, and hastened
back to the hacienda of her uncle.</p>

<p>Astride her grey steed she goes at a gallop.</p>

<p>Her head is bare; her coiffure disarranged; her rich black
tresses streaming back beyond her shoulders, no longer covered by
scarf or serape.  The last she has left behind her, and along
with it her <i>vicuna</i> hat.</p>

<p>Her eyes are flashing with excitement; her cheeks flushed to
the colour of carmine.</p>

<p>The cause is known.</p>

<p>And also why she is riding in such hot haste.  She has herself
declared it.</p>

<p>On nearing the house, she is seen to tighten her rein.  The
horse is pulled in to a slower pace&mdash;a trot; slower
still&mdash;a walk; and, soon after, he is halted in the middle
of the road.</p>

<p>His rider has changed her intention; or stops to reflect
whether she should.</p>

<p>She sits reflecting.</p>

<p>"On second thoughts&mdash;perhaps&mdash;better not have him
taken?  It would create a terrible scandal, everywhere.  So far,
no one knows of &mdash;. Besides, what can I say myself&mdash;the
only witness?  Ah! were I to tell these gallant Texans the story,
my own testimony would be enough to have him punished with a
harsh hand.  No! let him live.  <i>Ladron</i> as he is, I do not
fear him.  After what's happened he will not care to come near
me.  <i>Santa Virgen</i>! to think that I could have felt a fancy
for this man&mdash;short-lived as it was!</p>

<p>"I must send some one back to release him.  One who can keep
my secret&mdash; who?  Benito, the mayor-domo&mdash;faithful and
brave.  <i>Gracias a Dios</i>! Yonder's my man&mdash;as usual
busied in counting his cattle.  Benito! Benito!"</p>

<p>"At your orders, s'norita?"</p>

<p>"Good Benito, I want you to do me a kindness.  You
consent?"</p>

<p>"At your orders, s'norita?" repeats the mayor-domo, bowing
low.</p>

<p>"Not <i>orders</i>, good Benito.  I wish you to do me a
<i>favour</i>."</p>

<p>"Command me, s'norita!"</p>

<p>"You know the spot of open ground at the top of the
hill&mdash;where the three roads meet?"</p>

<p>"As well as the corral of your uncle's hacienda."</p>

<p>"Good!  Go there.  You will find a man lying upon the ground,
his arms entangled in a lazo.  Release, and let him go free.  If
he be hurt&mdash;by a harsh fall he has had&mdash;do what you can
to restore him; but don't tell him who sent you.  You may know
the man&mdash;I think you do.  No matter for that.  Ask him no
questions, nor answer his, if he should put any.  Once you have
seen him on his legs, let him make use of them after his own
fashion.  You understand?"</p>

<p>"<i>Perfectamente, s'norita</i>.  Your orders shall be obeyed
to the letter."</p>

<p>"Thanks, good Benito.  Uncle Silvio will like you all the
better for it; though <i>you</i> mustn't tell him of it.  Leave
that to me.  If he shouldn't&mdash;if he shouldn't&mdash;well!
one of these days there may be an estate on the Rio Grande that
will stand in need of a brave, faithful steward&mdash;such an one
as I know you to be."</p>

<p>"Every one knows that the Dona Isidora is gracious as she is
fair."</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;thanks!  One more request.  The service I ask
you to do for me must be known to only three individuals.  The
third is he whom you are sent to succour.  You know the other
two?"</p>

<p>"S'norita, I comprehend.  It shall be as you wish it."</p>

<p>The mayor-domo is moving off on horseback, it need scarce be
said.  Men of his calling rarely set foot to the
earth&mdash;never upon a journey of half a league in length.</p>

<p>"Stay!  I had forgotten!" calls out the lady, arresting him.
"You will find a hat and serape.  They are mine.  Bring them, and
I shall wait for you here, or meet you somewhere along the
way."</p>

<p>Bowing, he again rides away.  Again is he summoned to
stop.</p>

<p>"On second thoughts, Señor Benito, I've made up my mind to go
along with you.  <i>Vamos</i>!"</p>

<p>The steward of Don Silvio is not surprised at caprice, when
exhibited by the niece of his employer.  Without questioning, he
obeys her command, and once more heads his horse for the
hill.</p>

<p>The lady follows.  She has told him to ride in the advance.
She has her reason for departing from the aristocratic
custom.</p>

<p>Benito is astray in his conjecture.  It is not to caprice that
he is indebted for the companionship of the señorita.  A serious
motive takes her back along the road.</p>

<p>She has forgotten something more than her wrapper and
hat&mdash;that little letter that has caused her so much
annoyance.</p>

<p>The "good Benito" has not had <i>all</i> her confidence; nor
can he be entrusted with this.  <i>It</i> might prove a scandal,
graver than the quarrel with Don Miguel Diaz.</p>

<p>She rides back in hopes of repossessing herself of the
epistle.  How stupid not to have thought of it before!</p>

<p>How had El Coyote got hold of it?  He must have had it from
Jose!</p>

<p>Was her servant a traitor?  Or had Diaz met him on the way,
and forced the letter from him?</p>

<p>To either of these questions an affirmative answer might be
surmised.</p>

<p>On the part of Diaz such an act would have been natural
enough; and as for Jose, it is not the first time she has had
reason for suspecting his fidelity.</p>

<p>So run her thoughts as she re-ascends the slope, leading up
from the river bottom.</p>

<p>The summit is gained, and the opening entered; Isidora now
riding side by side with the mayor-domo.</p>

<p>No Miguel Diaz there&mdash;no man of any kind; and what gives
her far greater chagrin, not a scrap of paper!</p>

<p>There is her hat of vicuna wool&mdash;her seraph of Saltillo,
and the loop end of her lazo&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p>"You may go home again, Señor Benito!  The man thrown from his
horse must have recovered his senses&mdash;and, I suppose, his
saddle too.  Blessed be the virgin!  But remember, good Benito
<i>Secrecy all the same. Entiende, V</i>?"</p>

<p>"<i>Yo entiendo, Dona Isidora</i>."</p>

<p>The mayor-domo moves away, and is soon lost to sight behind
the crest of the hill.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE lady of the lazo is once more alone in the
glade.  She springs out of her saddle; dons serape and sombrero;
and is again the <i>beau-ideal</i> of a youthful hidalgo.</p>

<p>She remounts slowly, mechanically&mdash;as if her thoughts do
not company the action.  Languidly she lifts her limb over the
horse.  The pretty foot is for a second or two poised in the
air.</p>

<p>Her ankle, escaping from the skirt of her <i>enagua</i>,
displays a tournure to have crazed Praxiteles.  As it descends on
the opposite side of the horse, a cloud seems to overshadow the
sun.  Simon Stylites could scarce have closed his eyes on the
spectacle.</p>

<p>But there is no spectator of this interesting episode; not
even the wretched Jose; who, the moment after, comes skulking
into the glade.</p>

<p>He is questioned, without circumlocution, upon the subject of
the strayed letter.</p>

<p>"What have you done with it, sirrah?"</p>

<p>"Delivered it, my lady."</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"I left it at&mdash;at&mdash;the <i>posada</i>," he replies,
stammering and turning pale.  "Don Mauricio had gone out."</p>

<p>"A lie, <i>lepero</i>!  You gave it to Don Miguel Diaz.  No
denial, sir! I've seen it since."</p>

<p>"O Señora, pardon! pardon!  I am not guilty&mdash;indeed I am
not."</p>

<p>"Stupid, you should have told your story better.  You have
committed yourself.  How much did Don Miguel pay you for your
treason?"</p>

<p>"As I live, lady, it was not treason. He&mdash;he&mdash;forced
it from me&mdash;by threats&mdash;blows. I&mdash;I&mdash;was not
paid."</p>

<p>"You shall be, then!  I discharge you from my service; and for
wages take that, and that, and that&mdash;"</p>

<p>For at least ten times are the words repeated&mdash;the riding
whip at each repetition descending upon the shoulders of the
dishonest messenger.</p>

<p>He essays to escape by running off.  In vain.  He is brought
up again by the dread of being ridden over, and trampled under
the hoofs of the excited horse.</p>

<p>Not till the blue wheals appear upon his brown skin, does the
chastisement cease.</p>

<p>"Now, sirrah; from my sight! and let me see you no more. <i>Al
monte! al monte</i>!"</p>

<p>With ludicrous alacrity the command is obeyed.  Like a scared
cat the discharged servitor rushes out of the glade; only too
happy to hide himself, and his shame, under the shadows of the
thorny thicket.</p>

<p>But a little while longer does Isidora remain upon the
spot&mdash;her anger giving place to a profound chagrin.  Not
only has she been baffled from carrying out her design; but her
heart's secret is now in the keeping of traitors!</p>

<p>Once more she heads her horse homeward.  She arrives in time
to be present at a singular spectacle.  The people&mdash;peons,
vaqueros, and employes of every kind&mdash;are hurrying to and
fro, from field to corral, from corral to courtyard one and all
giving tongue to terrified ejaculations.  The men are on their
feet arming in confused haste; the woman on their knees, praying
pitifully to heaven&mdash;through the intercession of a score of
those saints, profusely furnished by the Mexican hierarchy to
suit all times and occasions.</p>

<p>"What is causing the commotion?"</p>

<p>This is the question asked by Isidora.</p>

<p>The mayor-domo&mdash;who chances to be the first to present
himself&mdash;is the individual thus interrogated.</p>

<p>A man has been murdered somewhere out upon the prairie.</p>

<p>The victim is one of the new people who have lately taken
possession of Caso del Corvo&mdash;the son of the American
haciendado himself.</p>

<p>Indians are reported to have done the deed.</p>

<p>Indians!  In this word is the key to the excitement among Don
Silvio's servitors.</p>

<p>It explains both the praying and the hurried rushing to
arms.</p>

<p>The fact that a man has been murdered&mdash;a slight
circumstance in that land of unbridled emotions&mdash;would have
produced no such response&mdash;more especially when the man was
a stranger, an "Americano."</p>

<p>But the report that Indians are abroad, is altogether a
different affair.  In it there is an idea of danger.</p>

<p>The effect produced on Isidora is different.  It is not fear
of the savages.  The name of the "asesinado" recalls thoughts
that have already given her pain.  She knows that there is a
sister, spoken of as being wonderfully beautiful.  She has
herself looked upon this beauty, and cannot help believing in
it.</p>

<p>A keener pang proceeds from something else she has heard: that
this peerless maiden has been seen in the company of Maurice
Gerald.  There is no fresh jealousy inspired by the news of the
brother's death&mdash;only the old unpleasantness for the moment
revived.</p>

<p>The feeling soon gives place to the ordinary indifference felt
for the fate of those with whom we have no acquaintance.</p>

<p>Some hours later, and this indifference becomes changed to a
painful interest; in short, an apprehension.  There are fresh
reports about the murder.  It has been committed, not by
Comanches; but by a white man&mdash;by <i>Maurice the
mustanger</i>!</p>

<p>There are no Indians near.</p>

<p>This later edition of "novedades," while tranquilising Don
Silvio's servants, has the contrary effect upon his niece.  She
cannot rest under the rumour; and half-an-hour afterwards, she is
seen reining up her horse in front of the village hotel.</p>

<p>For some weeks, with motive unknown, she has been devoting
herself to the study of <i>La lengua Americana</i>.  Her
vocabulary of English words, still scanty, is sufficient for her
present purpose; which is to acquire information, not about the
murder, but the man accused of committing it.</p>

<p>The landlord, knowing who she is, answers her inquiries with
obsequious politeness.</p>

<p>She learns that Maurice Gerald is no longer his guest, with
"full particulars of the murder," so far as known.</p>

<p>With a sad heart she rides back to the Hacienda Martinez.  On
reaching the house, she finds its tranquillity again disturbed.
The new cause of excitement might have been deemed ludicrous;
though it is not so regarded by the superstitious <i>peons</i>. A
rare rumour has reached the place.  A man without a
head&mdash;<i>un hombre descabezado</i>&mdash;has been seen
riding about the plains, somewhere near the Rio Nueces!</p>

<p>Despite its apparent absurdity, there can be no doubting the
correctness of the report.  It is rife throughout the settlement.
But there is still surer confirmation of it.  A party of Don
Silvio's own people&mdash; herdsmen out in search of strayed
cattle&mdash;have seen the <i>cavallero descabezado</i>; and,
desisting from their search, had ridden away from him, as they
would have done from the devil!</p>

<p>The <i>vaqueros</i>&mdash;there are three of them&mdash;are
all ready to swear to the account given.  But their scared looks
furnish a more trustworthy evidence of its truthfulness.</p>

<p>The sun goes down upon a <i>congeries</i> of frightful
rumours.  Neither these nor the protestations of Don Silvio and
his sister can prevent their capricious niece from carrying out a
resolution she seems suddenly to have formed&mdash;which is, to
ride back to the Rio Grande.  It makes no difference to her, that
a murder has been committed on the road she will have to take;
much less that near it has been seen the ghastly apparition of a
headless horseman!  What to any other traveller should cause
dismay, seems only to attract Isidora.</p>

<p>She even proposes making the journey <i>alone</i>!  Don Silvio
offers an escort&mdash;half a score of his <i>vaqueros</i>, armed
to the teeth.  The offer is rejected.  Will she take Benito?  No.
She prefers journeying alone. In short, she is determined upon
it.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">NEXT morning she carries out this determination.
By day-break she is in the saddle; and, in less than two hours
after, riding, not upon the direct road to the Rio Grande, but
along the banks of the Alamo!</p>

<p>Why has she thus deviated from her route?  Is she
straying?</p>

<p>She looks not like one who has lost her way.  There is a sad
expression upon her countenance, but not one of inquiry. Besides,
her horse steps confidently forward, as if under his rider's
direction, and guided by the rein.</p>

<p>Isidora is not straying.  She has not lost her way.</p>

<p>Happier for her, if she had.</p>

<h2><a id="ch56"></a>CHAPTER FIFTY SIX.<br>

A SHOT AT THE DEVIL.</h2>

<p class="first">
ALL night long the invalid lay awake; at times tranquil, at
times giving way to a paroxysm of unconscious passion.</p>

<p>All night long the hunter sate by his bedside, and listened to
his incoherent utterances.</p>

<p>They but confirmed two points of belief already impressed upon
Zeb's mind: that Louise Poindexter was beloved; that her brother
had been murdered!</p>

<p>The last was a belief that, under any circumstances, would
have been painful to the backwoodsman.  Coupled with the facts
already known, it was agonising.</p>

<p>He thought of the quarrel&mdash;the hat&mdash;the cloak.  He
writhed as he contemplated the labyrinth of dark ambiguities that
presented itself to his mind.  Never in his life had his
analytical powers been so completely baffled.  He groaned as he
felt their impotence.</p>

<p>He kept no watch upon the door.  He knew that if <i>they</i>
came, it would not be in the night.</p>

<p>Once only he went out; but that was near morning, when the
light of the moon was beginning to mingle with that of the
day.</p>

<p>He had been summoned by a sound.  Tara, straying among the
trees, had given utterance to a long dismal "gowl," and come
running scared-like into the hut.</p>

<p>Extinguishing the light, Zeb stole forth, and stood
listening.</p>

<p>There was an interruption to the nocturnal chorus; but that
might have been caused by the howling of the hound?  What had
caused <i>it</i>?</p>

<p>The hunter directed his glance first upon the open lawn; then
around its edge, and under the shadow of the trees.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be seen there, except what should be.</p>

<p>He raised his eyes to the cliff, that in a dark line trended
along the horizon of the sky&mdash;broken at both ends by the
tops of some tall trees that rose above its crest.  There were
about fifty paces of clear space, which he knew to be the edge of
the upper plain terminating at the brow of the precipice.</p>

<p>The line separating the <i>chiaro</i> from the <i>oscuro</i>
could be traced distinctly as in the day.  A brilliant moon was
beyond it.  A snake could have been seen crawling along the top
of the cliff.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be seen there.</p>

<p>But there was something to be heard.  As Zeb stood listening
there came a sound from the upper plain, that seemed to have been
produced not far back from the summit of the cliff.  It resembled
the clinking of a horse's shoe struck against a loose stone.</p>

<p>So conjectured Zeb, as with open ears he listened to catch its
repetition.</p>

<p>It was not repeated; but he soon saw what told him his
conjecture was correct&mdash;a horse, stepping out from behind
the treetops, and advancing along the line of the bluff.  There
was a man upon his back&mdash;both horse and man distinctly seen
in dark <i>silhouette</i> against the clear sapphire sky.</p>

<p>The figure of the horse was perfect, as in the outlines of a
skilfully cast medallion.</p>

<p>That of the man could be traced&mdash;only from the saddle to
the shoulders. Below, the limbs were lost in the shadow of the
animal though the sparkle of spur and stirrup told that they were
there.  Above, there was nothing&mdash;not even the semblance of
a head!</p>

<p>Zeb Stump rubbed his eyes and looked; and rubbed them and
looked again. It did not change the character of the apparition.
If he had rubbed them fourscore times, he would have seen the
same&mdash;a horseman without a head.</p>

<p>This very sight he saw, beyond the possibility of
disbelieving&mdash;saw the horse advancing along the level line
in a slow but steady pace&mdash;without footfall&mdash;without
sound of any kind&mdash;as if gliding rather than walking&mdash;
like the shifting scene of a cosmorama!</p>

<p>Not for a mere instant had he the opportunity of observing the
spectral apparition; but a period long enough to enable him to
note every detail&mdash;long enough to satisfy him that it could
be no illusion of the eye, or in any way a deception of his
senses.</p>

<p>Nor did it vanish abruptly from his view; but slowly and
gradually: first the head of the horse; then the neck and
shoulders; then the shape, half ghastly, half grotesque, of the
rider; then the hind-quarters of the animal; the hips; and last
of all the long tapering tail!</p>

<p>"Geehosophat!"</p>

<p>It was not surprise at the disappearance of the headless
horseman that extorted this exclamation from the lips of Zeb
Stump.  There was nothing strange about this.  The spectacle had
simply passed behind the proscenium&mdash;represented by the tope
of tree tops rising above the bluff.</p>

<p>"Geehosophat!"</p>

<p>Twice did the backwoodsman give utterance to this, his
favourite expression of surprise; both times with an emphasis
that told of an unlimited astonishment.</p>

<p>His looks betrayed it.  Despite his undoubted courage, a
shiver passed through his colossal frame; while the pallor upon
his lips was perceptible through their brown priming of tobacco
juice.</p>

<p>For some time he stood speechless, as if unable to follow up
his double ejaculation.</p>

<p>His tongue at length returned to him.</p>

<p>"Dog-gone my cats!" he muttered, but in a very low tone, and
with eyes still fixed upon the point where the horse's tail had
been last seen. "If that ere don't whip the hul united creashun,
my name ain't Zeb'lon Stump!  The Irish hev been right arter all.
I tho't he hed dreemt o' it in his drink.  But no.  He hev seed
somethin'; and so hev I meself.  No wonner the cuss war skeeart.
I feel jest a spell shaky in my own narves beout this time.
Geehosophat! what kin the durned thing be?"</p>

<p>"What <i>kin</i> it be?" he continued, after a period spent in
silent reflection.  "Dog-goned, ef I kin detarmine one way or the
tother.  Ef 't hed been only i' the daylight, an I ked a got a
good sight on't; or eft hed been a leetle bit cloaster!  Ha!  Why
moutn't I git cloaster to <i>it</i>?  Dog-goned, ef I don't hev a
try!  I reck'n it won't eet me&mdash;not ef it air ole Nick; an
ef it <i>air</i> him, I'll jest satersfy meself whether a bullet
kin go custrut thro' his infernal karkidge 'ithout throwin' him
out o' the seddle.  Hyur go for a cloaster akwaintance wi' the
varmint, whatsomiver it be."</p>

<p>So saying, the hunter stalked off through the trees&mdash;upon
the path that led up to the bluff.</p>

<p>He had not needed to go inside for his rifle&mdash;having
brought that weapon out with him, on hearing the howl of the
hound.</p>

<p>If the headless rider was real flesh and blood&mdash;earthly
and not of the other world&mdash;Zeb Stump might confidently
count upon seeing him again.</p>

<p>When viewed from the door of the <i>jacale</i>, he was going
direct towards the ravine, that permitted passage from the higher
level to the bottom lands of the Alamo.  As Zeb had started to
avail himself of the same path, unless the other should meantime
change direction, or his tranquil pace to a trot or gallop, the
backwoodsman would be at the head of the pass as soon as he.</p>

<p>Before starting, Zeb had made a calculation of the distance to
be done, and the time to do it in.</p>

<p>His estimate proved correct&mdash;to a second, and an inch. As
his head was brought nearly on a level with the upland plain, he
saw the <i>shoulders</i> of the horseman rising above it.</p>

<p>Another step upward, and the body was in view.  Another, and
the horse was outlined against the sky, from hoof to
forelock.</p>

<p>He stood at a halt.  He was standing, as Zeb first came in
sight of him. He was fronting towards the cliff, evidently
intending to go down into the gorge.  His rider appeared to have
pulled him up as a measure of precaution; or he may have heard
the hunter scrambling up the ravine; or, what was more likely,
scented him.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, he was standing, front face to the
spectator.</p>

<p>On seeing him thus, Zeb Stump also came to a stand.  Had it
been many another man, the same might have been said of his hair;
and it is not to be denied, that the old hunter was at that
moment, as he acknowledged himself, "a spell shaky 'beout the
narves."</p>

<p>He was firm enough, however, to carry out the purpose that had
prompted him to seek that singular interview; which was, to
discover whether he had to deal with a human being, or the
devil!</p>

<p>In an instant his rifle was at his shoulder, his eye glancing
along the barrel; the sights, by the help of a brilliant
moonlight, bearing upon the heart of the Headless Horseman.</p>

<p>In another, a bullet would have been through it; but for a
thought that just then flashed across the brain of the
backwoodsman.</p>

<p>Maybe he was about to commit <i>murder</i>?</p>

<p>At the thought he lowered the muzzle of his piece, and
remained for a time undecided.</p>

<p>"It mout be a man?" muttered he, "though it don't look like it
air. Thur ain't room enuf for a head under that ere Mexikin
blanket, no how. Ef it be a human critter he hev got a tongue I
reck'n, though he ain't much o' a head to hold it in.  Hilloo
stronger!  Ye're out for a putty lateish ride, ain't ye?  Hain't
yo forgot to fetch yur head wi ye?"</p>

<p>There was no reply.  The horse snorted, on hearing the voice.
That was all.</p>

<p>"Lookee hyur, strenger!  Ole Zeb Stump from the State o'
Kintucky, air the individooal who's now speakin' to ye.  He ain't
one o' thet sort ter be trifled wi'.  Don't try to kum none o'
yer damfoolery over this hyur coon.  I warn ye to declur yur
game.  If ye're playin possum, ye'd better throw up yur hand; or
by the jumpin' Geehosophat, ye may lose both yur stake an yur
curds!  Speak out now, afore ye gits plugged wi' a piece o'
lead!"</p>

<p>Less response than before.  This time the horse, becoming
accustomed to the voice, only tossed up his head.</p>

<p>"Then dog-gone ye!" shouted the hunter, exasperated by what he
deemed an insulting silence.  "Six seconds more&mdash;I'll gie ye
six more; an ef ye don't show speech by that time, I'll let drive
at yur guts.  Ef ye're but a dummy it won't do ye any harm.  No
more will it, I reckun, ef ye <i>air</i> the devil.  But ef ye're
a man playin' possum, durn me ef ye don't desarve to be shot for
bein' sech a damned fool.  Sing out!" he continued with
increasing anger, "sing out, I tell ye!  Ye won't?  Then hyur
goes!
One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six!"</p>

<p>Where "seven" should have come in, had the count been
continued, was heard the sharp crack of a rifle, followed by the
sibillation of a spinning bullet; then the dull "thud" as the
deadly missile buried itself in some solid body.</p>

<p>The only effect produced by the shot, appeared to be the
frightening of the horse.  The rider still kept his seat in the
saddle!</p>

<p>It was not even certain the horse was scared.  The clear neigh
that responded to the detonation of the rifle, had something in
it that sounded derisive!</p>

<p>For all that, the animal went off at a tearing gallop; leaving
Zeb Stump a prey to the profoundest surprise he had ever
experienced.</p>

<p>After discharging his rifle, he remained upon his knees, for a
period of several seconds.</p>

<p>If his nerves were unsteady before the shot, they had become
doubly so now.  He was not only surprised at the result, but
terrified.  He was certain that his bullet had passed through the
man's heart&mdash;or where it should be&mdash;as sure as if his
muzzle had been held close to the ribs.</p>

<p>It could not be a man?  He did not believe it to be one; and
this thought might have reassured him, but for the behaviour of
the horse. It was that wild unearthly neigh, that was now
chilling his blood, and causing his limbs to shake, as if under
an ague.</p>

<p>He would have retreated; but, for a time, he felt absolutely
unable to rise to his feet; and he remained kneeling, in a sort
of stupefied terror&mdash;watching the weird form till it receded
out of sight far off over the moonlit plain.  Not till then did
he recover sufficient courage, to enable him to glide back down
the gorge, and on towards the <i>jacale</i>.</p>

<p>And not till he was under its roof, did he feel sufficiently
himself, to reflect with any calmness on the odd encounter that
had occurred to him.</p>

<p>It was some time before his mind became disabused of the idea
that he had been dealing with the devil.  Reflection, however,
convinced him of the improbability of this; though it gave him no
clue as to what the thing really was.</p>

<p>"Shurly," muttered he, his conjectural form of speech showing
that he was still undecided, "Shurly arter all it can't be a
thing o' the tother world&mdash;else I kedn't a heern the
<i>cothug</i> o' my bullet?  Sartin the lead struck agin
somethin' solid; an I reck'n thur's nothin' solid in the karkidge
o' a ghost?"</p>

<p>"Wagh!" he concluded, apparently resigning the attempt to
obtain a solution of the strange physical phenomenon.  "Let the
durned thing slide!  One o' two things it air boun' to be: eyther
a bunnel o' rags, or ole Harry from hell?"</p>

<p>As he re-entered the hut, the blue light of morning stole in
along with him.</p>

<p>It was time to awaken Phelim, that he might take his turn by
the bedside of the invalid.</p>

<p>The Connemara man, now thoroughly restored to sobriety, and
under the impression of having been a little derelict in his
duty, was ready to undertake the task.</p>

<p>The old hunter, before consigning his charge to the care of
his unskilled successor, made a fresh dressing of the
scratches&mdash;availing himself of the knowledge that a long
experience had given him in the pharmacopoeia of the forest.</p>

<p>The <i>nopal</i> was near; and its juice inspissated into the
fresh wounds would not fail to effect their speedy cure.</p>

<p>Zeb knew that in twenty-four hours after its application, they
would be in process of healing; and in three days, entirely
cicatrised.</p>

<p>With this confidence&mdash;common to every denizen of the
cactus-covered land of Mexico&mdash;he felt defiant as to
doctors; and if a score of them could have been procured upon the
instant, he would not have summoned one.  He was convinced that
Maurice Gerald was in no danger&mdash;at least not from his
wounds.</p>

<p>There was a danger; but that was of a different kind.</p>

<p>"An' now, Mister Pheelum," said he, on making a finish of his
surgical operations; "we hev dud all thet kin be dud for the
outard man, an it air full time to look arter the innard.  Ye say
thur ain't nuthin to eet?"</p>

<p>"Not so much as a purtaty, Misther Stump.  An' what's worse
thare's nothin' to dhrink&mdash;not a dhrap lift in the whole
cyabin."</p>

<p>"Durn ye, that's <i>yur</i> fault," cried Stump, turning upon
the Irishman with a savage scowl that showed equal regret at the
announcement.  "Eft hadn't a been for you, thur war licker enough
to a lasted till the young fellur got roun' agin.  What's to be
dud now?"</p>

<p>"Sowl, Misther Stump! yez be wrongin' <i>me</i> althegither
intirely.  That same yez are.  I hadn't a taste exciptin what
came out av the little flask.  It wus thim Indyins that imptied
the dimmyjan.  Trath was it."</p>

<p>"Wagh! ye cudn't a got drunk on what wur contained i' the
flask.  I know yur durned guts too well for thet.  Ye must a had
a good pull at the tother, too."</p>

<p>"Be all the saints&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Durn yur stinkin' saints!  D'you s'pose any man o' sense
believes in sech varmint as them?</p>

<p>"Wal; 'tain't no use talkin' any more beout it.  Ye've sucked
up the corn juice, an thur's an end o't.  Thur ain't no more to
be hed 'ithin twenty mile, an we must go 'ithout."</p>

<p>"Be Jaysus, but it's bad!"</p>

<p>"Shet up yur head, durn ye, an hear what I've got to say.
We'll hev to go 'ithout drinkin'; but thet air no reezun for
sturvin' ourselves for want o' somethin' to eet.  The young
fellur, I don't misdoubt, air by this time half starved hisself.
Thur's not much on his stummuk, I reck'n, though thur may be on
his mind.  As for meself, I'm jest hungry enough to eat coyoat;
an I ain't very sure I'd turn away from turkey buzzart; which, as
I reck'n, wud be a wusser victual than coyoat.  But we ain't
obleeged to eet turkey buzzart, whar thur's a chance o' gettin'
turkey; an thet ain't so dewbious along the Alamo.  You stay
hyur, an take care o' the young fellur, whiles I try up the crik,
an see if I kin kum acrosst a gobbler."</p>

<p>"I'll do that, Misther Stump, an no mistake.  Be me
trath&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep yur palaver to yurself, till I've finished talkin' to
ye."</p>

<p>"Sowl!  I won't say a word."</p>

<p>"Then don't, but lissen!  Thur's somethin 'bout which I don't
wait ye to make any mistake.  It air this.  Ef there shed anybody
stray this way dyurin my absince, ye'll let me know.  You musn't
lose a minnit o' time, but let me know."</p>

<p>"Shure I will&mdash;sowl, yis."</p>

<p>"Wal, I'll depend on ye."</p>

<p>"Trath, yez may;&mdash;but how Misther Stump?  How am I to lit
yez know, if you're beyant hearin' av me voice?  How thin?"</p>

<p>"Wal, I reck'n, I shan't need to go so fur as thet.  Thur
ought to be gobblers cloast by&mdash;at this time o' the
mornin'.</p>

<p>"An yit there moutent," continued Zeb, after reflecting a
while.  "Ye ain't got sech a thing as a gun in the shanty?  A
pistol 'ud do."</p>

<p>"Nayther wan nor the tother.  The masther tuk both away wid
him, when he went last time to the sittlements.  He must have
lift them thare."</p>

<p>"It air awk'ard.  I mout <i>not</i> heer yur shout."</p>

<p>Zeb, who had by this time passed through the doorway, again
stopped to reflect.</p>

<p>"Heigh!" he exclaimed, after a pause of six seconds.  "I've
got it. I've treed the eydee.  Ye see my ole maar, tethered out
thur on the grass?"</p>

<p>"Shure I do, Misther Stump.  Av coorse I do."</p>

<p>"Wal, ye see thet ere prickly cacktis plant growin' cloast to
the edge o' the openin'?"</p>

<p>"Faith, yis."</p>

<p>"Wal, that's sensible o' ye.  Now lissen to what I say.  Ye
must keep a look out at the door; an ef anybody kums up whiles
I'm gone, run straight custrut for the cacktis, cut off one o'
its branches&mdash;the thorniest ye kin see&mdash;an stick it
unner the maar's tail."</p>

<p>"Mother av Moses!  For what div yez want me to do that?"</p>

<p>"Wal, I reck'n I'd better explain," said Zeb, reflectingly;
"otherwise ye'll be makin' a mess o' it."</p>

<p>"Ye see, Pheelum, ef anybody interlopes durin' my absince I
hed better be hyur.  I ain't a goin' fur off.  But howsomediver
near, I moutn't hear yur screech; thurfore the maar's 'll do
better.  You clap the cacktis under her tail, cloast up to the
fundament; and ef she don't squeal loud enuf to be heern by me,
then ye may konklude that this coon air eyther rubbed out, or hev
both his lugs plugged wi picket pins.  So, Pheelum; do you
adzactly as I've tolt ye."</p>

<p>"I'll do it, be Japers!"</p>

<p>"Be sure now.  Yur master's life may depend upon it."</p>

<p>After delivering this last caution, the hunter shouldered his
long rifle, and walked away from the hut.</p>

<p>"He's a cute owld chap that same," said Phelim as soon as Zeb
was out of hearing.  "I wonder what he manes by the master bein'
in danger from any wan comin' to the cyabin.  He sed, that his
life moight depend upon it? Yis&mdash;he sed that."</p>

<p>"He towlt me to kape a luk out.  I suppose he maned me to
begin at wance.  I must go to the inthrance thin."</p>

<p>So saying, he stepped outside the door; and proceeded to make
an ocular inspection of the paths by which the <i>jacale</i>
might be approached.</p>

<p>After completing this, he returned to the threshold; and there
took stand, in the attitude of one upon the watch.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch57"></a>CHAPTER FIFTY SEVEN.<br>

SOUNDING THE SIGNAL.</h2>

<p class="first">
PHELIM'S vigil was of short duration.  Scarce ten minutes had
he been keeping it, when he became warned by the sound of a
horse's hoof, that some one was coming up the creek in the
direction of the hut.</p>

<p>His heart commenced hammering against his ribs.</p>

<p>The trees, standing thickly, hindered him from having a view
of the approaching horseman; and he could not tell what sort of
guest was about to present himself at the <i>jacale</i>.  But the
hoofstroke told him there was only <i>one</i>; and this it was
that excited his apprehension.  He would have been less alarmed
to hear the trampling of a troop.  Though well assured it could
no longer be his master, he had no stomach for a second interview
with the cavalier who so closely resembled him&mdash;in
everything except the head.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to rush across the lawn, and carry out
the scheme entrusted to him by Zeb.  But the indecision springing
from his fears kept him to his place&mdash;long enough to show
him that they were groundless.  The strange horseman had a
head.</p>

<p>"Shure an that same he hez," said Phelim, as the latter rode
out from among the trees, and halted on the edge of the opening;
"a raal hid, an a purty face in front av it.  An' yit it don't
show so plazed nayther. He luks as if he'd jist buried his
grandmother.  Sowl! what a quare young chap he is, wid them toiny
mowstacks loike the down upon a two days' goslin'!  O Lard!  Luk
at his little fut!  <i>Be Jaysus, he's a woman</i>!"</p>

<p>While the Irishman was making these observations&mdash;partly
in thought, partly in muttered speech&mdash;the equestrian
advanced a pace or two, and again paused.</p>

<p>On a nearer view of his visitor, Phelim saw that he had
correctly guessed the sex; though the moustache, the manner of
the mount, the hat, and serape, might for the moment have misled
a keener intellect than his of Connemara.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> a woman.  It was Isidora.</p>

<p>It was the first time that Phelim had set eyes on the Mexican
maiden&mdash; the first that hers had ever rested upon him.  They
were equally unknown to one another.</p>

<p>He had spoken the truth, when he said that her countenance did
not display pleasure.  On the contrary, the expression upon it
was sad&mdash; almost disconsolate.</p>

<p>It had shown distrust, as she was riding under the shadow of
the trees. Instead of brightening as she came out into the open
ground, the look only changed to one of mingled surprise and
disappointment.</p>

<p>Neither could have been caused by her coming within sight of
the <i>jacale</i>.  She knew of its existence.  It was the goal
of her journey. It must have been the singular personage standing
in the doorway.  He was not the man she expected to see
there.</p>

<p>In doubt she advanced to address him:</p>

<p>"I may have made a mistake?" said she, speaking in the best
"Americana" she could command.  "Pardon me, but&mdash;I&mdash;I
thought&mdash;that Don Mauricio lived here."</p>

<p>"Dan Marryshow, yez say?  Trath, no.  Thare's nobody av that
name lives heeur.  Dan Marryshow?  Thare was a man they called
Marrish had a dwillin' not far out av Ballyballagh.  I remimber
the chap will, bekase he chated me wanst in a horse thrade.  But
his name wasn't Dan.  No; it was Pat.  Pat Marrish was the
name&mdash;divil burn him for a desaver!"</p>

<p>"Don Mauricio&mdash;Mor-rees&mdash;Mor-ees."</p>

<p>"Oh!  Maurice!  Maybe ye'd be after spakin' av the
masther&mdash;Misther Gerrald!"</p>

<p>"Si&mdash;Si!  Señor Zyerral."</p>

<p>"Shure, thin, an if that's fwhat ye're afther, Misther Gerrald
diz dwill in this very cyabin&mdash;that is, whin he comes to
divart hisself, by chasin' the wild horses.  He only kapes it for
a huntin' box, ye know. Arrah, now; if yez cud only see the great
big cyastle he lives in whin he's at home, in owld Ireland; an
thy bewtiful crayther that's now cryin' her swate blue eyes out,
bekase he won't go back thare.  Sowl, if yez saw <i>her</i>!"</p>

<p>Despite its <i>patois</i>, Phelim's talk was too well
understood by her to whom it was addressed.  Jealousy is an apt
translator.  Something like a sigh escaped from Isidora, as he
pronounced that little word "her."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to see <i>her</i>," was the quick rejoinder;
"but him you mention.  Is he at home?  Is he inside?"</p>

<p>"Is he at home?  Thare now, that's comin' to the
point&mdash;straight as a poike staff.  An' supposin' I wuz to
say yis, fwhat ud yez be afther wantin' wid him?"</p>

<p>"I wish to see him."</p>

<p>"Div yez?  Maybe now ye'll wait till yez be asked.  Ye're a
purty crayther, notwithstandin' that black strake upon yer lip.
But the masther isn't in a condishun jist at this time to see any
wan&mdash;unless it was the praste or a docthur.  Yez cyant see
him."</p>

<p>"But I wish very much to see him, señor."</p>

<p>"Trath div yez.  Ye've sayed that alriddy.  But yez cyant, I
till ye. It isn't Phaylim Onale ud deny wan av the fair
six&mdash;espacially a purty black-eyed colleen loike yerself.
But for all that yez cyant see the masther now."</p>

<p>"Why can I not?"</p>

<p>"Why cyant yez not?  Will&mdash;thare's more than wan rayzon
why yez cyant. In the first place, as I've towlt you, he's not in
a condishun to resave company&mdash;the liss so av its bein' a
lady."</p>

<p>"But why, señor?  Why?"</p>

<p>"Bekase he's not dacently drissed.  He's got nothin' on him
but his shirt&mdash;exceptin' the rags that Misther Stump's jist
tied all roun' him. Be japers! thare's enough av them to make him
a whole shoot&mdash;coat, waiscoat, and throwsers&mdash;trath is
thare."</p>

<p>"Señor, I don't understand you."</p>

<p>"Yez don't?  Shure an I've spoke plain enough!  Don't I till
ye that the masther's in bid?"</p>

<p>"In bed!  At this hour?  I hope there's nothing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The matther wid him, yez wur goin' to say?  Alannah, that
same is there&mdash;a powerful dale the matther wid
him&mdash;enough to kape him betwane the blankets for weeks to
come."</p>

<p>"Oh, señor!  Do not tell me that he is ill?"</p>

<p>"Don't I till ye!  Arrah now me honey; fwhat ud be the use av
consalin' it?  It ud do it no good; nayther cyan it do him any
harm to spake about it?  Yez moight say it afore his face, an he
won't conthradict ye."</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> ill, then.  O, sir, tell me, what is the nature
of his illness&mdash;what has caused it?"</p>

<p>"Shure an I cyant answer only wan av thim
interrogataries&mdash;the first yez hiv phut.  His disaze
pursades from some ugly tratement he's been resavin&mdash;the
Lord only knows what, or who administhered it.  He's got a bad
lig; an his skin luks as if he'd been tied up in a sack along wid
a score av angry cats.  Sowl! thare's not the brenth av yer purty
little hand widout a scratch upon it.  Worse than all, he's
besoide hisself."</p>

<p>"Beside himself?"</p>

<p>"Yis, that same.  He's ravin' loike wan that had a dhrap too
much overnight, an thinks thare's the man wid the poker afther
him.  Be me trath, I belave the very bist thing for him now ud be
a thrifle av potheen&mdash;if wan cud only lay hands upon that
same.  But thare's not the smell av it in the cyabin.  Both the
dimmy-jan an flask.  Arrah, now; <i>you</i> wouldn't be afther
havin' a little flask upon yer sweet silf? Some av that
agwardinty, as yer people call it.  Trath, I've tasted worse
stuff than it.  I'm shure a dhrink av it ud do the masther good.
Spake the truth, misthress!  Hiv yez any about ye?"</p>

<p>"No, señor.  I have nothing of the kind.  I am sorry I have
not."</p>

<p>"Faugh!  The more's the pity for poor Masther Maurice.  It ud
a done him a dale av good.  Well; he must put up widout it."</p>

<p>"But, señor; surely I can see him?"</p>

<p>"Divil a bit.  Besides fwhat ud be the use?  He wudn't know ye
from his great grandmother.  I till yez agane, he's been badly
thrated, an 's now besoide hisself!"</p>

<p>"All the more reason why I should see him.  I may be of
service.  I owe him a debt&mdash;of&mdash;of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! yez be owin' him somethin?  Yez want to pay it?  Faith,
that makes it intirely different.  But yez needn't see <i>him</i>
for that.  I'm his head man, an thransact all that sort av
bizness for him.  I cyant write myself, but I'll give ye a resate
on the crass wid me mark&mdash;which is jist as good, among the
lawyers.  Yis, misthress; yez may pay the money over to me, an I
promise ye the masther 'll niver axe ye for it agane. Trath!
it'll come handy jist now, as we're upon the ave av a flittin, an
may want it.  So if yez have the pewther along wid ye, thare's
pins, ink, an paper insoide the cyabin.  Say the word, an I'll
giv ye the resate!"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no!  I did not mean money.  A debt
of&mdash;of&mdash;gratitude."</p>

<p>"Faugh! only that.  Sowl, it's eezy paid, an don't want a
resate.  But yez needn't return that sort av money now: for the
masther woudn't be sinsible av fwhat ye wur sayin.  Whin he comes
to his sinses, I'll till him yez hiv been heeur, and wiped out
the score."</p>

<p>"Surely I can see him?"</p>

<p>"Shurely now yez cyant."</p>

<p>"But I must, señor!"</p>

<p>"Divil a must about it.  I've been lift on guard, wid sthrict
ordhers to lit no wan go inside."</p>

<p>"They couldn't have been meant for me.  I am his
friend&mdash;the friend of Don Mauricio."</p>

<p>"How is Phaylum Onale to know that?  For all yer purty face,
yez moight be his didliest innemy.  Be Japers! its loike enough,
now that I take a second luk at ye."</p>

<p>"I must see him&mdash;I must&mdash;I will&mdash;I shall!"</p>

<p>As Isidora pronounced these words, she flung herself out of
the saddle, and advanced in the direction of the door.</p>

<p>Her air of earnest determination combined with the
fierce&mdash;scarce feminine&mdash;expression upon her
countenance, convinced the Galwegian, that the contingency had
arrived for carrying out the instructions left by Zeb Stump, and
that he had been too long neglecting his cue.</p>

<p>Turning hurriedly into the hut, he came out again, armed with
a tomahawk; and was about to rush past, when he was brought to a
sudden stand, by seeing a pistol in the hands of his lady
visitor, pointed straight at his head!</p>

<p>"<i>Abajo la hacha</i>!"  (Down with the hatchet), cried she.
"<i>Lepero</i>! lift your arm to strike me, and it will be for
the last time!"</p>

<p>"Stroike ye, misthress!  Stroike <i>you</i>!" blubbered the
<i>ci-devant</i> stable-boy, as soon as his terror permitted him
to speak.  "Mother av the Lard!  I didn't mane the waypon for you
at all, at all!  I'll sware it on the crass&mdash;or a whole
stack av Bibles if yez say so.  In trath misthress; I didn't mane
the tammyhauk for you!"</p>

<p>"Why have you brought it forth?" inquired the lady, half
suspecting that she had made a mistake, and lowering her pistol
as she became convinced of it.  "Why have you thus armed
yourself?"</p>

<p>"As I live, only to ixecute the ordhers, I've
resaved&mdash;only to cut a branch off av the cyacktus yez see
over yander, an phut it undher the tail av the owld mare.  Shure
yez won't object to my doin' that?"</p>

<p>In her turn, the lady became silent&mdash;surprised at the
singular proposition.</p>

<p>The odd individual she saw before her, could not mean
mischief.  His looks, attitude, and gestures were grotesque,
rather than threatening; provocative of mirth&mdash;not fear, or
indignation.</p>

<p>"Silince gives consint.  Thank ye," said Phelim, as, no longer
in fear of being shot down in his tracks, he ran straight across
the lawn, and carried out to the letter, the parting injunctions
of Zeb Stump.</p>

<p>The Mexican maiden hitherto held silent by surprise, remained
so, on perceiving the absolute idleness of speech.</p>

<p>Further conversation was out of the question.  What with the
screaming of the mare&mdash;continuous from the moment the
spinous crupper was inserted under her tail&mdash;the loud
trampling of her hoofs as she "cavorted" over the turf&mdash;the
dismal howling of the hound&mdash;and the responsive cries of the
wild forest denizens&mdash;birds, beasts, insects, and
reptiles&mdash;only the voice of a Stentor could have been
heard!</p>

<p>What could be the purpose of the strange proceeding?  How was
it to terminate?</p>

<p>Isidora looked on in silent astonishment.  She could do
nothing else. So long as the infernal fracas continued, there was
no chance to elicit an explanation from the queer creature who
had caused it.</p>

<p>He had returned to the door of the jacale; and once more taken
his stand upon the threshold; where he stood, with the tranquil
satisfied air of an actor who has completed the performance of
his part in the play, and feels free to range himself among the
spectator.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch58"></a>CHAPTER FIFTY EIGHT.<br>

RECOILING FROM A KISS.</h2>

<p class="first">
FOR full ten minutes was the wild chorus kept up, the mare all
the time squealing like a stuck pig; while the dog responded in a
series of lugubrious howls, that reverberated along the cliffs on
both sides of the creek.</p>

<p>To the distance of a mile might the sounds have been heard;
and as Zeb Stump was not likely to be so far from the hut, he
would be certain to hear them.</p>

<p>Convinced of this, and that the hunter would soon respond to
the signal he had himself arranged, Phelim stood square upon the
threshold, in hopes that the lady visitor would stay
outside&mdash;at least, until he should be relieved of the
responsibility of admitting her.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding her earnest protestations of amity, he was
still suspicious of some treasonable intention towards his
master; else why should Zeb have been so particular about being
summoned back?</p>

<p>Of himself, he had abandoned the idea of offering resistance.
That shining pistol, still before his eyes, had cured him of all
inclination for a quarrel with the strange equestrian; and so far
as the Connemara man was concerned, she might have gone
unresisted inside.</p>

<p>But there was another from Connemara, who appeared more
determined to dispute her passage to the hut&mdash;one whom a
whole battery of great guns would not have deterred from
protecting its owner.  This was Tara.</p>

<p>The staghound was not acting as if under the excitement of a
mere senseless alarm.  Mingling with his prolonged sonorous
"gowl" could be heard in repeated interruptions a quick sharp
bark, that denoted anger. He had witnessed the attitude of the
intruder&mdash;its apparent hostility&mdash; and drawing his
deductions, had taken stand directly in front of Phelim and the
door, with the evident determination that neither should be
reached except over his own body, and after running the gauntlet
of his formidable incisors.</p>

<p>Isidora showed no intention of undertaking the risk.  She had
none. Astonishment was, for the time, the sole feeling that
possessed her.</p>

<p>She remained transfixed to the spot, without attempting to say
a word.</p>

<p>She stood expectingly.  To such an eccentric prelude there
should be a corresponding <i>finale</i>.  Perplexed, but
patiently, she awaited it.</p>

<p>Of her late alarm there was nothing left.  What she saw was
too ludicrous to allow of apprehension; though it was also too
incomprehensible to elicit laughter.</p>

<p>In the mien of the man, who had so oddly comported himself,
there was no sign of mirth.  If anything, a show of seriousness,
oddly contrasting with the comical act he had committed; and
which plainly proclaimed that he had not been treating her to a
joke.</p>

<p>The expression of helpless perplexity that had become fixed
upon her features, continued there; until a tall man, wearing a
faded blanket coat, and carrying a six-foot rifle, was seen
striding among the tree-trunks, at the rate of ten miles to the
hour.  He was making direct for the <i>jacale</i>.</p>

<p>At sight of the new-comer her countenance underwent a change.
There was now perceptible upon it a shade of apprehension; and
the little pistol was clutched with renewed nerve by the delicate
hand that still continued to hold it.</p>

<p>The act was partly precautionary, partly mechanical.  Nor was
it unnatural, in view of the formidable-looking personage who was
approaching, and the earnest excited manner with which he was
hurrying forward to the hut.</p>

<p>All this became altered, as he advanced into the open ground,
and suddenly stopped on its edge; a look of surprise quite as
great as that upon the countenance of the lady, supplanting his
earnest glances.</p>

<p>Some exclamatory phrases were sent through his teeth,
unintelligible in the tumult still continuing, though the gesture
that accompanied them seemed to proclaim them of a character
anything but gentle.</p>

<p>On giving utterance to them, he turned to one side; strode
rapidly towards the screaming mare; and, laying hold of her
tail&mdash;which no living man save himself would have dared to
do&mdash;he released her from the torments she had been so long
enduring.</p>

<p>Silence was instantly restored; since the mare, abandoned by
her fellow choristers, as they became accustomed to her wild
neighs, had been, for some time, keeping up the solo by
herself.</p>

<p>The lady was not yet enlightened.  Her astonishment continued;
though a side glance given to the droll individual in the doorway
told her, that he had successfully accomplished some scheme with
which he had been entrusted.</p>

<p>Phelim's look of satisfaction was of short continuance.  It
vanished, as Zeb Stump, having effected the deliverance of the
tortured quadruped, faced round to the hut&mdash;as he did so,
showing a cloud upon the corrugations of his countenance, darkly
ominous of an angry storm.</p>

<p>Even the presence of beauty did not hinder it from bursting.
"Durn, an dog-gone ye, for a Irish eedyit!  Air this what ye've
brought me back for!  An' jest as I wur takin' sight on a turkey,
not less 'n thirty poun' weight, I reck'n; skeeart afore he ked
touch trigger, wi' the skreek o' thet cussed critter o' a maar.
Damned little chance for breakfust now."</p>

<p>"But, Misther Stump, didn't yez till me to do it?  Ye sid if
any wan showld come to the cyabin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah! ye fool!  Ye don't serpose I meened weemen, did ye?"</p>

<p>"Trath!  I didn't think it wus wan, whin she furst presented
hersilf. Yez showld a seen the way she rid up&mdash;sittin'
astraddle on her horse."</p>

<p>"What matter it, how she wur sittin'!  Hain't ye seed thet
afore, ye greenhorn?  It's thur usooal way 'mong these hyur
Mexikin sheemales. Ye're more o' a woman than she air, I guess;
an twenty times more o' a fool.  Thet I'm sartint o'.  I know
<i>her</i> a leetle by sight, an somethin' more by reeport.  What
hev fetched the critter hyur ain't so difeequilt to comprehend;
tho' it may be to git it out o' her, seein' as she kin only talk
thet thur Mexikin lingo; the which this chile can't, nor wudn't
ef he kud."</p>

<p>"Sowl, Misther Stump! yez be mistaken.  She spakes English
too.  Don't yez, misthress?"</p>

<p>"Little Inglees," returned the Mexican, who up to this time
had remained listening.  "Inglees <i>poco pocito</i>."</p>

<p>"O&mdash;ah!" exclaimed Zeb, slightly abashed at what he had
been saying.  "I beg your pardin, saynoritta.  Ye kin
<i>habla</i> a bit o' Amerikin, kin ye? <i>Moocho
bono</i>&mdash;so much the betterer.  Ye'll be able to tell me
what ye mout be a wantin' out hyur.  Ye hain't lost yur way, hev
ye?"</p>

<p>"No, señor," was the reply, after a pause.  "In that case, ye
know whar ye air?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor&mdash;si</i>&mdash;yes, of Don Mauricio Zyerral,
this the&mdash;house?"</p>

<p>"Thet air the name, near as a Mexikin mouth kin make it, I
reck'n. 'Tain't much o' a house; but it air his'n.  Preehaps ye
want to see the master o't?"</p>

<p>"O, señor&mdash;yees&mdash;that is for why I here
am&mdash;<i>por esta yo soy aqui</i>."</p>

<p>"Wal; I reck'n, thur kin be no objecshun to yur seein' him.
Yur intenshuns ain't noways hostile to the young fellur, I
kalklate.  But thur ain't much good in yur talkin' to him now. He
won't know yo from a side o' sole-leather."</p>

<p>"He is ill?  Has met with some misfortune?  <i>El guero</i>
has said so."</p>

<p>"Yis.  I towlt her that," interposed Phelim, whose carroty
hair had earned for him the appellation "El guero."</p>

<p>"Sartin," answered Zeb.  "He air wounded a bit; an jest now a
leetle dulleerious.  I reck'n it ain't o' much consekwence. He'll
be hisself agin soon's the ravin' fit's gone off o' him."</p>

<p>"O, sir! can I be his nurse till then?  <i>Por amor dios</i>!
Let me enter, and watch over him?  I am his friend&mdash;<i>un
amigo muy afficionado</i>."</p>

<p>"Wal; I don't see as thur's any harm in it.  Weemen makes the
best o' nusses I've heern say; tho', for meself, I hain't hed
much chance o' tryin' 'em, sincst I kivered up my ole gurl unner
the sods o' Massissipi.  Ef ye want to take a spell by the side
o' the young fellur, ye're wilkim&mdash;seein' ye're his friend.
Ye kin look arter him, till we git back, an see thet he don't
tummel out o' the bed, or claw off them thur bandidges, I've tied
roun him."</p>

<p>"Trust me, good sir, I shall take every care of him.  But tell
me what has caused it?  The Indians?  No, they are not near?  Has
there been a quarrel with any one?"</p>

<p>"In thet, saynoritta; ye're beout as wise as I air meself.
Thur's been a quarrel wi' coyeats; but that ain't what's gin him
the ugly knee.  I foun' him yesterday, clost upon sun-down, in
the chapparal beyont.  When we kim upon him, he war up to his
waist in the water o' a crik as runs through thur, jest beout to
be attakted by one o' them spotty critters yur people call
tigers.  Wal, I relieved him o' that bit o' danger; but what
happened afore air a mystery to me.  The young fellur had tuk
leeve o' his senses, an ked gie no account o' hisself.  He hain't
rekivered them yet; an', thurfore, we must wait till he do."</p>

<p>"But you are sure, sir, he is not badly injured?  His
wounds&mdash;they are not dangerous?"</p>

<p>"No danger whatsomediver.  Nuthin' beyont a bit o' a fever, or
maybe a touch o' the agey, when that goes off o' him.  As for the
wounds, they're only a wheen o' scratches.  When the wanderin'
hev gone out o' his senses, he'll soon kum roun, I reck'n.  In a
week's time, ye'll see him as strong as a buck."</p>

<p>"Oh!  I shall nurse him tenderly!"</p>

<p>"Wal, that's very kind o' you; but&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Zeb hesitated, as a queer thought came before his mind.  It
led to a train of reflections kept to himself.  They were
these:</p>

<p>"This air the same she, as sent them kickshaws to the tavern
o' Rough an Ready.  Thet she air in love wi' the young fellur is
clur as Massissipi mud&mdash;in love wi' him to the eends o' her
toe nails.  So's the tother. But it air equally clur that he's
thinkin' o' the tother, an not o' her. Now ef she hears him talk
about tother, as he hev been a doin' all o' the night, thur'll be
a putty consid'able rumpus riz inside o' her busom.  Poor thing!
I pity her.  She ain't a bad sort.  But the Irish&mdash; Irish
tho' he be&mdash;can't belong to both; an I <i>know</i> he
freezes to the critter from the States.  It air durned
awkurd&mdash;Better ef I ked pursuade her not to go near
him&mdash;leastwise till he gets over ravin' about Lewaze.</p>

<p>"But, miss," he continued, addressing himself to the Mexican,
who during his long string of reflections had stood impatiently
silent, "don't ye think ye'd better ride home agin; an kum back
to see him arter he gits well.  He won't know ye, as I've sayed;
an it would be no use yur stayin', since he ain't in any danger
o' makin' a die of it."</p>

<p>"No matter, that he may not know me.  I should tend him all
the same. He may need some things&mdash;which I can send, and
procure for him."</p>

<p>"Ef ye're boun' to stay then," rejoined Zeb, relentingly, as
if some new thought was causing him to consent, "I won't
interfere to say, no.  But don't you mind what he'll be
palaverin' about.  Ye may hear some queer talk out o' him, beout
a man bein' murdered, an the like.  That's natral for any one as
is dulleerious.  Don't be skeeart at it.  Beside, ye may hear him
talkin' a deal about a woman, as he's got upon his mind."</p>

<p>"A woman!"</p>

<p>"Jest so.  Ye'll hear him make mention o' her name."</p>

<p>"Her name!  Señor, what name?"</p>

<p>"Wal, it air the name o' his sister, I reck'n.  Fact, I'm sure
o' it bein' his sister."</p>

<p>"Oh!  Misther Stump.  If yez be spakin' av Masther
Maurice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up, ye durned fool!  What is't to you what I'm speakin'
beout? You can't unnerstan sech things.  Kum along!" he
continued, moving off, and motioning the Connemara man to follow
him.  "I want ye a leetle way wi' me.  I killed a rattle as I wur
goin' up the crik, an left it thur. Kum you, an toat it back to
the shanty hyur, lest some varmint may make away wi' it; an lest,
arter all, I moutn't strike turkey agin."</p>

<p>"A rattle.  Div yez mane a rattle-snake?"</p>

<p>"An' what shed I mean?"</p>

<p>"Shure, Misther Stump, yez wudn't ate a snake.  Lard! wudn't
it poison yez?"</p>

<p>"Pisen be durned!  Didn't I cut the pisen out, soon 's I
killed the critter, by cuttin' off o' its head?"</p>

<p>"Trath! an for all that, I wudn't ate a morsel av it, if I was
starvin'."</p>

<p>"Sturve, an be durned to ye!  Who axes ye to eet it.  I only
want ye to toat it home.  Kum then, an do as I tell ye; or dog-
goned, ef I don't make ye eet the head o' the
reptile,&mdash;pisen, fangs an all!"</p>

<p>"Be japers, Misther Stump, I didn't mane to disobey you at
all&mdash;at all. Shure it's Phaylim O'Nale that's reddy to do
your biddin' anyhow.  I'm wid ye for fwhativer yez want; aven to
swallowin the snake whole.  Saint Pathrick forgive me!"</p>

<p>"Saint Patrick be durned!  Kum along!"</p>

<p>Phelim made no farther remonstrance; but, striking into the
tracks of the backwoodsman, followed him through the wood.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">ISIDORA entered the hut; advanced towards the
invalid reclining upon his couch; with fierce fondness kissed his
fevered brow, fonder and fiercer kissed his unconscious lips; and
then recoiled from them, as if she had been stung by a
scorpion!</p>

<p>Worse than scorpion's sting was that which had caused her to
spring back.</p>

<p>And yet 'twas but a word&mdash;a little word&mdash;of only two
syllables!</p>

<p>There was nothing strange in this.  Oft, on one
word&mdash;that soft short syllabic "Yes"&mdash;rests the
happiness of a life; while oft, too oft, the harsher negative is

<h2><a id="ch59"></a>CHAPTER FIFTY NINE.<br>

ANOTHER WHO CANNOT REST.</h2>

<p class="first">
A DARK day for Louise Poindexter&mdash;perhaps the darkest in
the calendar of her life&mdash;was that in which she released Don
Miguel Diaz from the lazo.</p>

<p>Sorrow for a brother's loss, with fears for a lover's safety,
were yesterday commingled in the cup.  To-day it was further
embittered by the blackest passion of all&mdash;jealousy.
Grief&mdash;fear&mdash;jealousy&mdash;what must be the state of
the soul in which these emotions are co-existent?  A tumult of
terrible imaginings.</p>

<p>So was it in the bosom of Louise Poindexter after deciphering
the epistle which contained written evidence of her lover's
disloyalty.</p>

<p>True, the writing came not from him; nor was the proof
conclusive.</p>

<p>But in the first burst of her frenzied rage, the young Creole
did not reason thus.  In the wording of the letter there was
strong presumption, that the relationship between Maurice Gerald
and the Mexican was of a more affectionate character than he had
represented it to be&mdash;that he had, in fact, been practising
a deception.</p>

<p>Why should <i>that</i> woman write to him in such free
strain&mdash;giving bold, almost unfeminine, licence to her
admiration of his eyes: "<i>Essos ojos tan lindos y tan
espresivos</i>?"</p>

<p>These were no phrases of friendship; but the expressions of a
prurient passion.  As such only could the Creole understand them:
since they were but a paraphrase of her own feelings.</p>

<p>And then there was the appointment itself&mdash;solicited, it
is true, in the shape of a request.  But this was mere
courtesy&mdash;the coquetry of an accomplished <i>maitresse</i>.
Moreover, the tone of solicitation was abandoned towards the
close of the epistle; which terminated in a positive command:
"Come, sir! come!"</p>

<p>Something more than jealousy was aroused by the reading of
this.  A spirit of revenge seemed to dictate the gesture that
followed,&mdash;and the stray sheet was crushed between the
aristocratic fingers into which it had fallen.</p>

<p>"Ah, me!" reflected she, in the acerbity of her soul, "I see
it all now. 'Tis not the first time he has answered a similar
summons; not the first they have met on that same ground, 'the
hill above my uncle's house'&mdash;slightly described, but well
understood&mdash;oft visited before."</p>

<p>Soon the spirit of vengeance gave place to a profound despair.
Her heart had its emblem in the piece of paper that lay at her
feet upon the floor&mdash;like it, crushed and ruined.</p>

<p>For a time she surrendered herself to sad meditation.  Wild
emotions passed through her mind, suggesting wild resolves. Among
others she thought of her beloved Louisiana&mdash;of going back
there to bury her secret sorrow in the cloisters of the <i>Sacre
Coeur</i>.  Had the Creole convent been near, in that hour of
deep despondency, she would, in all probability, have forsaken
the paternal home, and sought an asylum within its sacred walls.
In very truth was it the darkest day of her existence.  After
long hours of wretchedness her spirit became calmer, while her
thoughts returned to a more rational tone.  The letter was re-
read; its contents submitted to careful consideration.</p>

<p>There was still a hope&mdash;the hope that, after all, Maurice
Gerald might <i>not</i> be in the Settlement.</p>

<p>It was at best but a faint ray.  Surely <i>she</i> should
know&mdash;she who had penned the appointment, and spoken so
confidently of his keeping it? Still, as promised, he might have
gone away; and upon this supposition hinged that hope, now
scintillating like a star through the obscurity of the hour.</p>

<p>It was a delicate matter to make direct inquiries
about&mdash;to one in the position of Louise Poindexter.  But no
other course appeared open to her; and as the shadows of twilight
shrouded the grass-covered square of the village, she was seen
upon her spotted palfrey, riding silently through the streets,
and reining up in front of the hotel&mdash;on the same spot
occupied but a few hours before by the grey steed of Isidora!</p>

<p>As the men of the place were all absent&mdash;some on the
track of the assassin, others upon the trail of the Comanche,
Oberdoffer was the only witness of her indiscretion.  But he knew
it not as such.  It was but natural that the sister of the
murdered man should be anxious to obtain news; and so did he
construe the motive for the interrogatories addressed to him.</p>

<p>Little did the stolid German suspect the satisfaction which
his answers at first gave to his fair questioner; much less the
chagrin afterwards caused by that bit of information volunteered
by himself, and which abruptly terminated the dialogue between
him and his visitor.</p>

<p>On hearing she was not the first of her sex who had that day
made inquiries respecting Maurice the mustanger, Louise
Poindexter rode back to Casa del Corvo, with a heart writhing
under fresh laceration.</p>

<p>A night was spent in the agony of unrest&mdash;sleep only
obtained in short snatches, and amidst the phantasmagoria of
dreamland.</p>

<p>Though the morning restored not her tranquillity, it brought
with it a resolve, stern, daring, almost reckless.</p>

<p>It was, at least, daring, for Louise Poindexter to ride to the
Alamo alone; and this was her determination.</p>

<p>There was no one to stay her&mdash;none to say nay.  The
searchers out all night had not yet returned.  No report had come
back to Casa del Corvo. She was sole mistress of the mansion, as
of her actions&mdash;sole possessor of the motive that was
impelling her to this bold step.</p>

<p>But it may be easily guessed.  Hers was not a spirit to put up
with mere suspicion.  Even love, that tames the strongest, had
not yet reduced it to that state of helpless submission.
Unsatisfied it could no longer exist; and hence her resolve to
seek satisfaction.</p>

<p>She might find peace&mdash;she might chance upon ruin.  Even
the last appeared preferable to the agony of uncertainty.</p>

<p>How like to the reasoning of her rival!</p>

<p>It would have been idle to dissuade her, had there been any
one to do it.  It is doubtful even if parental authority could at
that moment have prevented her from carrying out her purpose.
Talk to the tigress when frenzied by a similar feeling.  With a
love unhallowed, the will of the Egyptian queen was not more
imperious than is that of the American Creole, when stirred by
its holiest passion.  It acknowledges no right of
contradiction&mdash;regards no obstruction save death.</p>

<p>It is a spirit rare upon earth.  In its tranquil state, soft
as the rays of the Aurora&mdash;pure as the prayer of a child;
but when stirred by love,&mdash;or rather by its too constant
concomitant&mdash;it becomes proud and perilous as the light of
Lucifer!</p>

<p>Of this spirit Louise Poindexter was the truest type.  Where
love was the lure, to wish was to have, or perish in the attempt
to obtain. Jealousy resting upon doubt was neither possible to
her nature, or compatible with her existence.  She must find
proofs to destroy, or confirm it&mdash;proofs stronger than those
already supplied by the contents of the strayed epistle, which,
after all, were only presumptive.</p>

<p>Armed with this, she was in a position to seek them; and they
were to be sought upon the Alamo.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE first hour of sunrise saw her in the saddle,
riding out from the enclosures of Casa del Corvo, and taking a
trail across the prairie already known to her.</p>

<p>On passing many a spot, endeared to her&mdash;sacred by some
of the sweetest souvenirs of her life&mdash;her thoughts
experienced more than one revulsion.</p>

<p>These were moments when she forgot the motive that originally
impelled her to the journey&mdash;when she thought only of
reaching the man she loved, to rescue him from enemies that might
be around him!</p>

<p>Ah! these moments&mdash;despite the apprehension for her
lover's safety&mdash;were happy, when compared with those devoted
to the far more painful contemplation of his treachery.</p>

<p>From the point of starting to that of her destination, it was
twenty miles.  It might seem a journey, to one used to European
travelling&mdash; that is in the saddle.  To the prairie
equestrian it is a ride of scarce two hours&mdash;quick as a
scurry across country, after a stag or fox.</p>

<p>Even with an unwilling steed it is not tedious; but with that
lithe-limbed, ocellated creature, Luna, who went willingly
towards her prairie home, it was soon over&mdash;too soon,
perhaps, for the happiness of her rider.</p>

<p>Wretched as Louise Poindexter may have felt before, her misery
had scarce reached the point of despair.  Through her sadness
there still shone a scintillation of hope.</p>

<p>It was extinguished as she set foot upon the threshold of the
<i>jacale</i>; and the quick suppressed scream that came from her
lips, was like the last utterance of a heart parting in
twain.</p>

<p><i>There was a woman within the hut</i>!</p>

<p>From the lips of this woman an exclamation had already
escaped, to which her own might have appeared an echo&mdash;so
closely did the one follow the other&mdash;so alike were they in
anguish.</p>

<p>Like a second echo, still more intensified, was the cry from
Isidora; as turning, she saw in the doorway that woman, whose
name had just been pronounced&mdash;the "Louise" so fervently
praised, so fondly remembered, amidst the vagaries of a
distempered brain.</p>

<p>To the young Creole the case was clear&mdash;painfully clear.
She saw before her the writer of that letter of
appointment&mdash;which, after all, <i>had been kept</i>.  In the
strife, whose sounds had indistinctly reached her, there may have
been a third party&mdash;Maurice Gerald?  That would account for
the condition in which she now saw him; for she was far enough
inside the hut to have a view of the invalid upon his couch.</p>

<p>Yes; it was the writer of that bold epistle, who had called
Maurice Gerald "querido;"&mdash;who had praised his
eyes&mdash;who had commanded him to come to her side; and who was
now by his side, tending him with a solicitude that proclaimed
her his!  Ah! the thought was too painful to be symbolised in
speech.</p>

<p>Equally clear were the conclusions of Isidora&mdash;equally
agonising.  She already knew that she was supplanted.  She had
been listening too long to the involuntary speeches that told her
so, to have any doubt as to their sincerity.  On the door-step
stood the woman who had succeeded her!</p>

<p>Face to face, with flashing eyes, their bosoms rising and
falling as if under one impulse&mdash;both distraught with the
same dire thought&mdash;the two stood eyeing each other.</p>

<p>Alike in love with the same man&mdash;alike jealous&mdash;they
were alongside the object of their burning passion unconscious of
the presence of either!</p>

<p>Each believed the other successful: for Louise had not heard
the words, that would have given her comfort&mdash;those words
yet ringing in the ears, and torturing the soul, of Isidora!</p>

<p>It was an attitude of silent hostility&mdash;all the more
terrible for its silence.  Not a word was exchanged between them.
Neither deigned to ask explanation of the other; neither needed
it.  There are occasions when speech is superfluous, and both
intuitively felt that this was one.  It was a mutual encounter of
fell passions; that found expression only in the flashing of
eyes, and the scornful curling of lips.</p>

<p>Only for an instant was the attitude kept up.  In fact, the
whole scene, inside, scarce occupied a score of seconds.</p>

<p>It ended by Louise Poindexter turning round upon the doorstep,
and gliding off to regain her saddle.  The hut of Maurice Gerald
was no place for her!</p>

<p>Isidora too came out, almost treading upon the skirt of the
other's dress.  The same thought was in her heart&mdash;perhaps
more emphatically felt.  The hut of Maurice Gerald was no place
for her!</p>

<p>Both seemed equally intent on departure&mdash;alike resolved
on forsaking the spot, that had witnessed the desolation of their
hearts.</p>

<p>The grey horse stood nearest&mdash;the mustang farther out.
Isidora was the first to mount&mdash;the first to move off; but
as she passed, her rival had also got into the saddle, and was
holding the ready rein.</p>

<p>Glances were again interchanged&mdash;neither triumphant, but
neither expressing forgiveness.  That of the Creole was a strange
mixture of sadness, anger, and surprise; while the last look of
Isidora, that accompanied a spiteful "<i>carajo</i>!"&mdash;a
fearful phrase from female lips&mdash; was such as the Ephesian
goddess may have given to Athenaia, after the award of the
apple.</p>

<h2><a id="ch60"></a>CHAPTER SIXTY.<br>

A FAIR INFORMER.</h2>

<p class="first">
IF things physical may be compared with things moral, no
greater contrast could have been found, than the bright heavens
beaming over the Alamo, and the black thoughts in the bosom of
Isidora, as she hastened away from the <i>jacale</i>.  Her heart
was a focus of fiery passions, revenge predominating over
all.</p>

<p>In this there was a sort of demoniac pleasure, that hindered
her from giving way to despair; otherwise she might have sunk
under the weight of her woe.</p>

<p>With gloomy thoughts she rides under the shadow of the trees.
They are not less gloomy, as she gazes up the gorge, and sees the
blue sky smiling cheerfully above her.  Its cheerfulness seems
meant but to mock her!</p>

<p>She pauses before making the ascent.  She has reined up under
the umbrageous cypress&mdash;fit canopy for a sorrowing heart.
Its sombre shade appears more desirable than the sunlight
above.</p>

<p>It is not this that has caused her to pull up.  There is a
thought in her soul darker than the shadow of the cypress.  It is
evinced by her clouded brow; by her black eyebrows contracted
over her black flashing eyes; above all, by an expression of
fierceness in the contrast of her white teeth gleaming under the
moustached lip.</p>

<p>All that is good of woman, except beauty, seems to have
forsaken&mdash;all that is bad, except ugliness, to have taken
possession of her!</p>

<p>She has paused at the prompting of a demon&mdash;with an
infernal purpose half formed in her mind.  Her muttered speeches
proclaim it.  "I should have killed her upon the spot!  Shall I
go back, and dare her to deadly strife?"</p>

<p>"If I killed her, what would it avail?  It could not win me
back <i>his</i> heart&mdash;lost, lost, without hope!  Yes; those
words were from the secret depths of his soul; where her image
alone has found an abiding place! Oh! there is no hope for
me!</p>

<p>"'Tis he who should die; he who has caused my ruin.  If I kill
him?  Ah, then; what would life be to me?  Prom that hour an
endless anguish!</p>

<p>"Oh! it is anguish now!  I cannot endure it.  I can think of
no solace&mdash; if not in revenge.  Not only she, he
also&mdash;both must die!</p>

<p>"But not yet&mdash;not till he know, by whose hand it is done.
Oh! he shall feel his punishment, and know whence it comes.
Mother of God, strengthen me to take vengeance!"</p>

<p>She lances the flank of her horse, and spurs him, up the slope
of the ravine.</p>

<p>On reaching the upper plain, she does not stop&mdash;even for
the animal to breathe itself&mdash;but goes on at a reckless
gait, and in a direction that appears undetermined.  Neither hand
nor voice are exerted in the guidance of her steed&mdash;only the
spur to urge him on.</p>

<p>Left to himself, he returns in the track by which he came.  It
leads to the Leona.  Is it the way he is wanted to go?</p>

<p>His rider seems neither to know nor care.  She sits in the
saddle, as though she were part of it; with head bent down, in
the attitude of one absorbed in a profound reverie, unconscious
of outward things&mdash;even of the rude pace at which she is
riding!  She does not observe that black cohort close by; until
warned of its proximity by the snorting of her steed, that
suddenly comes to a stand.</p>

<p>She sees a <i>caballada</i> out upon the open prairie!</p>

<p>Indians?  No.  White men&mdash;less by their colour, than the
caparison of their horses, and their style of equitation.  Their
beards, too, show it; but not their skins, discoloured by the
"stoor" of the parched plain.</p>

<p>"<i>Los Tejanos</i>!" is the muttered exclamation, as she
becomes confirmed in regard to their nationality.</p>

<p>"A troop of their <i>rangers</i> scouring the country for
Comanches, I suppose?  The Indians are not here?  If I've heard
aright at the Settlement, they should be far on the other
side."</p>

<p>Without any strong reason for shunning them, the Mexican
maiden has no desire to encounter "Los Tejanos."  They are
nothing to her, or her purposes; and, at any other time, she
would not go out of their way. But in this hour of her
wretchedness, she does not wish to run the gauntlet of their
questionings, nor become the butt of their curiosity.</p>

<p>It is possible to avoid them.  She is yet among the bushes.
They do not appear to have observed her.  By turning short round,
and diving back into the chapparal, she may yet shun being
seen.</p>

<p>She is about to do so, when the design is frustrated by the
neighing of her horse.  A score of theirs respond to him; and he
is seen, along with his rider.</p>

<p>It might be still possible for her to escape the encounter, if
so inclined.  She would be certain of being pursued, but not so
sure of being overtaken&mdash;especially among the winding ways
of the chapparal, well known to her.</p>

<p>At first she <i>is</i> so inclined; and completes the turning
of her steed. Almost in the same instant, she reins round again;
and faces the phalanx of horsemen, already in full gallop towards
her.</p>

<p>Her muttered words proclaim a purpose in this sudden change of
tactics.</p>

<p>"Rangers&mdash;no!  Too well dressed for those ragged
<i>vagabundos</i>?  Must be the party of 'searchers,' of which
I've heard&mdash;led by the father of&mdash; Yes&mdash;yes it is
they.  <i>Ay Dios</i>! here is a chance of revenge, and without
my seeking it; God wills it to be so!"</p>

<p>Instead of turning back among the bushes, she rides out into
the open ground; and with an air of bold determination advances
towards the horsemen, now near.</p>

<p>She pulls up, and awaits their approach; a black thought in
her bosom.</p>

<p>In another minute she is in their midst&mdash;the mounted
circle close drawn around her.</p>

<p>There are a hundred horsemen, oddly armed, grotesquely
attired&mdash;uniform only in the coating of clay-coloured dust
which adheres to their habiliments, and the stern seriousness
observable in the bearing of all; scarce relieved by a slight
show of curiosity.</p>

<p>Though it is an <i>entourage</i> to cause
trembling&mdash;especially in a woman&mdash; Isidora does not
betray it.  She is not in the least alarmed.  She anticipates no
danger from those who have so unceremoniously surrounded her.
Some of them she knows by sight; though not the man of more than
middle age, who appears to be their leader, and who confronts, to
question her.</p>

<p>But she knows him otherwise.  Instinct tells her he is the
father of the murdered man&mdash;of the woman, she may wish to
gee slain, but assuredly, shamed.  Oh! what an opportunity!</p>

<p>"Can you speak French, mademoiselle?" asks Woodley Poindexter,
addressing her in this tongue&mdash;in the belief that it may
give him a better chance of being understood.  "Speak better
Inglees&mdash;very little, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh!  English.  So much the better for us.  Tell me, miss;
have you seen anybody out here&mdash;that is&mdash;have you met
any one, riding about, or camped, or halted anywhere?"</p>

<p>Isidora appears to reflect, or hesitate, before making
reply.</p>

<p>The planter pursues the interrogative, with such politeness as
the circumstances admit.</p>

<p>"May I ask where you live?"</p>

<p>"On the Rio Grande, señor?"</p>

<p>"Have you come direct from there?"</p>

<p>"No; from the Leona."</p>

<p>"From the Leona!"</p>

<p>"It's the niece of old Martinez," interposes one of the party.
"His plantation joins yours, Mister Poindexter."</p>

<p>"Si&mdash;yes&mdash;true that.  <i>Sobrina</i>&mdash;niece of
Don Silvio Martinez.  <i>Yo soy</i>."</p>

<p>"Then you've come from his place, direct?  Pardon me for
appearing rude. I assure you, miss, we are not questioning you
out of any idle curiosity, or impertinence.  We have serious
reasons&mdash;more than serious: they are solemn."</p>

<p>"From the Hacienda Martinez direct," answers Isidora, without
appearing to notice the last remark.  "Two hours ago&mdash;<i>un
pocito mas</i>&mdash;my uncle's house I leave."</p>

<p>"Then, no doubt, you have heard that there has been
a&mdash;murder&mdash; committed?"</p>

<p>"Si, señor.  Yesterday at uncle Silvio's it was told."</p>

<p>"But to-day&mdash;when you left&mdash;was there any fresh news
in the Settlement? We've had word from there; but not so late as
you may bring.  Have you heard anything, miss?"</p>

<p>"That people were gone after the <i>asesinado</i>.  Your
party, señor?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;it meant us, no doubt.  You heard nothing
more?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; something very strange, señores; so strange, you may
think I am jesting."</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquire a score of voices in quick simultaneity;
while the eyes of all turn with eager interest towards the fair
equestrian.</p>

<p>"There is a story of one being seen without a head&mdash;on
horseback&mdash;out here too.  <i>Valga me Dios</i>! we must now
be near the place?  It was by the Nueces&mdash;not far from the
ford&mdash;where the road crosses for the Rio Grande.  So the
vaqueros said."</p>

<p>"Oh; some vaqueros have seen it?"</p>

<p>"Si, señores; three of them will swear to having witnessed the
spectacle."</p>

<p>Isidora is a little surprised at the moderate excitement which
such a strange story causes among the "Tejanos."  There is an
exhibition of interest, but no astonishment.  A voice
explains:</p>

<p>"We've seen it too&mdash;that headless horseman&mdash;at a
distance.  Did your vaqueros get close enough to know what it
was?"</p>

<p>"<i>Santissima</i>! no."</p>

<p>"Can <i>you</i> tell us, miss?"</p>

<p>"I?  Not I.  I only heard of it, as I've said.  What it may
be, <i>quien sabe</i>?"</p>

<p>There is an interval of silence, during which all appear to
reflect on what they have heard.</p>

<p>The planter interrupts it, by a recurrence to his original
interrogatory.</p>

<p>"Have you met, or seen, any one, miss&mdash;out here, I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Si&mdash;yes&mdash;I have."</p>

<p>"You have!  What sort of person?  Be good enough to
describe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A lady."</p>

<p>"Lady!" echo several voices.</p>

<p>"Si, señores."</p>

<p>"What sort of a lady?"</p>

<p>"Una Americana."</p>

<p>"An American lady!&mdash;out here?  Alone?"</p>

<p>"Si, señores."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"<i>Quien sabe</i>?"</p>

<p>"You don't know her?  What was she like?"</p>

<p>"Like?&mdash;like?"</p>

<p>"Yes; how was she dressed?"</p>

<p>"<i>Vestido de caballo</i>."</p>

<p>"On horseback, then?"</p>

<p>"On horseback."</p>

<p>"Where did you meet the lady you speak of?"</p>

<p>"Not far from this; only on the other side of the
chapparal."</p>

<p>"Which way was she going?  Is there any house on the other
side?"</p>

<p>"A <i>jacale</i>.  I only know of that."</p>

<p>Poindexter to one of the party, who understands Spanish: "<i>A
jacale</i>?"</p>

<p>"They give that name to their shanties."</p>

<p>"To whom does it belong&mdash;this <i>jacale</i>?"</p>

<p>"<i>Don Mauricio, el mustenero</i>."</p>

<p>"Maurice the mustanger!" translates the ready interpreter.</p>

<p>A murmur of mutual congratulation runs through the crowd.
After two days of searching&mdash;fruitless, as
earnest&mdash;they have struck a trail,&mdash;the trail of the
murderer!</p>

<p>Those who have alighted spring back into their saddles.  All
take up their reins, ready to ride on.</p>

<p>"We don't wish to be rude, Miss Martinez&mdash;if that be your
name; but you must guide us to this place you speak of."</p>

<p>"It takes me a little out of my way&mdash;though not far. Come
on, cavalleros!  I shall show you, if you are determined on going
there."</p>

<p>Isidora re-crosses the belt of chapparal&mdash;followed by the
hundred horsemen, who ride stragglingly after her.</p>

<p>She halts on its western edge; between which and the Alamo
there is a stretch of open prairie.</p>

<p>"Yonder!" says she, pointing over the plain; "you see that
black spot on the horizon?  It is the top of an
<i>alhuehuete</i>.  Its roots are in the bottom lands of the
Alamo.  Go there!  There is a canon leading down the cliff.
Descend.  You will find, a little beyond, the <i>jacale</i> of
which I've told you."</p>

<p>The searchers are too much in earnest to stay for further
directions. Almost forgetting her who has given them, they spur
off across the plain, riding straight for the cypress.</p>

<p>One of the party alone lingers&mdash;not the leader, but a man
equally interested in all that has transpired.  Perhaps more so,
in what has been said in relation to the lady seen by Isidora. He
is one who knows Isidora's language, as well as his own native
tongue.</p>

<p>"Tell me, <i>nina</i>," says he, bringing his horse alongside
hers, and speaking in a tone of solicitude&mdash;almost of
entreaty&mdash;"Did you take notice of the horse ridden by this
lady?"</p>

<p>"<i>Carrambo</i>! yes.  What a question, cavallero!  Who could
help noticing it?"</p>

<p>"The colour?" gasps the inquirer.</p>

<p>"<i>Un musteno pintojo</i>."</p>

<p>"A spotted mustang!  Holy Heaven!" exclaims Cassius Calhoun,
in a half shriek, half groan, as he gallops after the
searchers&mdash;leaving Isidora in the belief, that, besides her
own, there is one other heart burning with that fierce fire which
only death can extinguish!</p>

<h2><a id="ch61"></a>CHAPTER SIXTY ONE.<br>

ANGELS ON EARTH.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE retreat of her rival&mdash;quick and unexpected&mdash;held
Louise Poindexter, as if spell-bound.  She had climbed into the
saddle, and was seated, with spur ready to pierce the flanks of
the fair Luna.  But the stroke was suspended, and she remained in
a state of indecision&mdash;bewildered by what she saw.</p>

<p>But the moment before she had looked into the
<i>jacale</i>&mdash;had seen her rival there, apparently at home;
mistress both of the mansion and its owner.</p>

<p>What was she to think of that sudden desertion?  Why that took
of spiteful hatred?  Why not the imperious confidence, that
should spring from a knowledge of possession?</p>

<p>In place of giving displeasure, Isidora's looks and actions
had caused her a secret gratification.  Instead of galloping
after, or going in any direction, Louise Poindexter once more
slipped down from her saddle, and re-entered the hut.</p>

<p>At sight of the pallid cheeks and wild rolling eyes, the young
Creole for the moment forgot her wrongs.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon dieu!  Mon dieu</i>!" she cried, gliding up to the
<i>catre</i>. "Maurice&mdash;wounded&mdash;dying!  Who has done
this?"</p>

<p>There was no reply: only the mutterings of a madman.</p>

<p>"Maurice!  Maurice! speak to me!  Do you not know me?  Louise!
Your Louise!  You have called me so?  Say it&mdash;O say it
again!"</p>

<p>"Ah! you are very beautiful, you angels here in heaven!  Very
beautiful. Yes, yes; you look so&mdash;to the eyes&mdash;to the
eyes.  But don't say there are none like you upon the Earth; for
there are&mdash;there are.  I know one&mdash;ah! more&mdash;but
one that excels you all, you angels in heaven!  I mean in
beauty&mdash;in goodness, that's another thing.  I'm not thinking
of goodness&mdash;no; no."</p>

<p>"Maurice, dear Maurice!  Why do you talk thus?  You are not in
heaven; you are here with me&mdash;with Louise."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> in heaven; yes, in heaven!  I don't wish it, for
all they say; that is, unless I can have <i>her</i> with me.  It
may be a pleasant place. Not without her.  If she were here, I
could be content.  Hear it, ye angels, that come hovering around
me!  Very beautiful, you are, I admit; but none of you like
her&mdash;her&mdash;my angel.  Oh! there's a devil, too; a
beautiful devil&mdash;I don't mean that.  I'm thinking only of
the angel of the prairies."</p>

<p>"Do you remember her name?"</p>

<p>Perhaps never was question put to a delirious man, where the
questioner showed so much interest in the answer.</p>

<p>She bent over him with ears upon the strain&mdash;with eyes
that marked every movement of his lips.</p>

<p>"Name? name?  Did some one say, name?  Have you any names
here?  Oh!  I remember&mdash;Michael, Gabriel, Azrael&mdash;men,
all men.  Angels, not like my angel&mdash;who is a woman.  Her
name is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is?"</p>

<p>"Louise&mdash;Louise&mdash;Louise.  Why should I conceal it
from you&mdash;you up here, who know everything that's down
there?  Surely you know her&mdash;Louise? You should: you could
not help loving her&mdash;ah! with all your hearts, as I with all
mine&mdash;all&mdash;all!"</p>

<p>Not when these last words were once before spoken&mdash;first
spoken under the shade of the acacia trees&mdash;the speaker in
full consciousness of intellect&mdash;in the full fervour of his
soul&mdash;not then were they listened to with such delight.  O,
happy hour for her who heard them!</p>

<p>Again were soft kisses lavished upon that fevered
brow&mdash;upon those wan lips; but this time by one who had no
need to recoil after the contact.</p>

<p>She only stood up erect&mdash;triumphant;&mdash;her hand
pressing upon her heart, to stay its wild pulsations.  It was
pleasure too complete, too ecstatic: for there was pain in the
thought that it cannot be felt for ever&mdash;in the fear of its
being too soon interrupted.</p>

<p>The last was but the shadow thrown before, and in such shape
it appeared&mdash;a shadow that camp darkling through the
doorway.</p>

<p>The substance that followed was a man; who, the moment after,
was seen standing upon the stoup.</p>

<p>There was nothing terrible in the aspect of the new-comer.  On
the contrary, his countenance and costume were types of the
comical, heightened by contrast with the wild associations of the
time and place. Still further, from juxtaposition with the odd
objects carried in his hands; in one a tomahawk; in the other a
huge snake; with its tail terminating in a string of bead-like
rattles, that betrayed its species.</p>

<p>If anything could have added to his air of grotesque drollery,
it was the expression of puzzled surprise that came over his
countenance; as, stepping upon the threshold, he discovered the
change that had taken place in the occupancy of the hut.</p>

<p>"Mother av Moses!" he exclaimed, dropping both snake and
tomahawk, and opening his eyes as wide as the lids would allow
them; "Shure I must be dhramin?  Trath must I!  It cyant be
yersilf, Miss Pointdixther?  Shure now it cyant?"</p>

<p>"But it is, Mr O'Neal.  How very ungallant in you to have
forgotten me, and so soon!"</p>

<p>"Forgotten yez!  Trath, miss, yez needn't accuse me of doin'
chat which is intirely impossible.  The Oirishman that hiz wance
looked in yer swate face will be undher the necissity iver afther
to remimber it. Sowl! thare's wan that cyant forgit it, even in
his dhrames!"</p>

<p>The speaker glanced significantly towards the couch.  A
delicious thrill passed through the bosom of the listener.</p>

<p>"But fwhat diz it all mane?" continued Phelim, returning to
the unexplained puzzle of the transformation.  "Fwhare's the
tother&mdash;the young chap, or lady, or wuman&mdash;whichsomiver
she art?  Didn't yez see nothin' av a wuman, Miss
Pointdixther?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Oh! yez did.  An fwhere is she now?"</p>

<p>"Gone away, I believe."</p>

<p>"Gone away!  Be japers, thin, she hasn't remained long in the
wan mind. I lift her heeur in the cyabin not tin minnits ago,
takin' aff her bonnit&mdash;that was only a man's hat&mdash;an
sittlin' hersilf down for a stay. Gone, yez say?  Sowl!  I'm not
sorry to hear it.  That's a young lady whose room's betther than
her company, any day in the twilmonth.  She's a dale too handy
wid her shootin'-iron.  Wud yez belave it, Miss Pointdixther; she
prisinted a pistol widin six inches av me nose?"</p>

<p>"<i>Pardieu</i>!  For what reason?"</p>

<p>"Fwhat rayzun?  Only that I thried to hindher her from
inthrudin' into the cyabin.  She got in for all that; for whin
owld Zeb come back, he made no objecshun to it.  She sayed she
was a frind av the masther, an wanted to nurse him."</p>

<p>"Indeed!  Oh! it is strange&mdash;very strange!" muttered the
Creole, reflectingly.</p>

<p>"Trath, is it.  And so is iverything in these times, exciptin'
yez own swate silf; that I hope will niver be sthrange in a
cyabin frequinted by Phaylim Onale.  Shure, now, I'm glad to see
yez, miss; an shure so wud the masther, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear Phelim! tell me all that has happened."</p>

<p>"Trath! thin miss, if I'm to till all, ye'll hiv to take off
your bonnet, and make up your moind for a long stay&mdash;seein'
as it 'ut take the big ind av a whole day to relate all the quare
things that's happened since the day afore yesthirday."</p>

<p>"Who has been here since then?"</p>

<p>"Who has been heeur?"</p>

<p>"Except the&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exceptin' the man-wuman, ye mane?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  Has any one else been to this place?"</p>

<p>"Trath has thare&mdash;plinty besoides.  An av all sorts, an
colours too. First an foremost there was wan comin' this way,
though he didn't git all the way to the cyabin.  But I daren't
tell you about him, for it moight frighten ye, miss."</p>

<p>"Tell me.  I have no fear."</p>

<p>"Be dad! and I can't make it out meself quite intirely.  It
was a man upon horseback widout a hid."</p>

<p>"Without a head!"</p>

<p>"Divil a bit av that same on his body."</p>

<p>The statement caused Phelim to be suspected of having lost
his.</p>

<p>"An' what's more, miss, he was for all the world like Masther
Maurice himself.  Wid his horse undher him, an his Mexikin
blanket about his showlders, an everything just as the young
masther looks, when he's mounted, Sowl! wasn't I scared, whin I
sit my eyes on him."</p>

<p>"But where did you see this, Mr O'Neal?"</p>

<p>"Up thare on the top av the bluff.  I was out lookin' for the
masther to come back from the Sittlement, as he'd promised he wud
that mornin', an who showld I see but hisself, as I supposed it
to be.  An' thin he comes ridin' up, widout his hid, an' stops a
bit, an thin goes off at a tarin' gallop, wid Tara gowlin' at his
horse's heels, away acrass the big plain, till I saw no more av
him.  Thin I made back for the cyabin heeur, an shut meself up,
and wint to slape; and just in the middle av me dhrames, whin I
was dhramin' of&mdash;but trath, miss, yez'll be toired standin'
on yer feet all this time.  Won't yez take aff yer purty little
ridin' hat, an sit down on the thrunk thare?&mdash;it's asier
than the stool. Do plaze take a sate; for if I'm to tell yez
all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind me&mdash;go on.  Please tell me who else has been
here besides this strange cavalier; who must have been some one
playing a trick upon you, I suppose."</p>

<p>"A thrick, miss!  Trath that's just what owld Zeb sayed."</p>

<p>"He has been here, then?"</p>

<p>"Yis&mdash;yis&mdash;but not till long afther the others."</p>

<p>"The others?"</p>

<p>"Yis, miss.  Zeb only arroived yestherday marnin'.  The others
paid their visit the night afore, an at a very unsayzonable hour
too, wakin' me out av the middle av my slape."</p>

<p>"But who?&mdash;what others?"</p>

<p>"Why the Indyens, to be shure."</p>

<p>"There have been Indians, then?"</p>

<p>"Trath was there&mdash;a whole tribe av thim.  Well, as I've
been tillin' yez, miss, jest as I wus in a soun' slape, I heerd
talkin' in the cyabin heern, right over my hid, an the shufflin'
av paper, as if somebody was dalin' a pack av cards,
an&mdash;Mother av Moses! fwhat's that?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Didn't yez heear somethin'?  Wheesht!  Thare it is agane!
Trath, it's the trampin' av horses!  They're jist outside."</p>

<p>Phelim rushed towards the door.</p>

<p>"Be Sant Pathrick! the place is surrounded wid men on
horseback. Thare's a thousand av them! an more comin' behind!  Be
japers! them's the chaps owld Zeb&mdash;Now for a frish spell av
squeelin!  O Lard!  I'll be too late!"</p>

<p>Seizing the cactus-branch&mdash;that for convenience he had
brought inside the hut&mdash;he dashed out through the
doorway.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!" cried the Creole, "'tis they!  My father,
and I here!  How shall I explain it?  Holy Virgin, save me from
shame!"</p>

<p>Instinctively she sprang towards the door, closing it, as she
did so. But a moment's reflection showed her how idle was the
act.  They who were outside would make light of such obstruction.
Already she recognised the voices of the Regulators!</p>

<p>The opening in the skin wall came under her eye.  Should she
make a retreat through that, undignified as it might be?</p>

<p>It was no longer possible.  The sound of hoofs also in the
rear!  There were horsemen behind the hut!</p>

<p>Besides, her own steed was in front&mdash;that ocellated
creature not to be mistaken.  By this time they must have
identified it!</p>

<p>But there was another thought that restrained her from
attempting to retreat&mdash;one more generous.</p>

<p><i>He</i> was in danger&mdash;from which even the
unconsciousness of it might not shield him!  Who but she could
protect him?</p>

<p>"Let my good name go!" thought she.
"Father&mdash;friends&mdash;all&mdash;all but him, if God so
wills it!  Shame, or no shame, to him will I be true!"</p>

<p>As these noble thoughts passed through her mind, she took her
stand by the bedside of the invalid, like a second Dido, resolved
to risk all&mdash; even death itself&mdash;for the hero of her
heart.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch62"></a>CHAPTER SIXTY TWO.<br>

WAITING FOR THE CUE.</h2>

<p class="first">
NEVER, since its erection, was there such a trampling of hoofs
around the hut of the horse-catcher&mdash;not even when its
corral was filled with fresh-taken mustangs.</p>

<p>Phelim, rushing out from the door, is saluted by a score of
voices that summon him to stop.</p>

<p>One is heard louder than the rest, and in tones of command
that proclaim the speaker to be chief of the party.</p>

<p>"Pull up, damn you!  It's no use&mdash;your trying to escape.
Another step, and ye'll go tumbling in your tracks.  Pull up, I
say!"</p>

<p>The command takes effect upon the Connemara man, who has been
making direct for Zeb Stump's mare, tethered on the other side of
the opening. He stops upon the instant.</p>

<p>"Shure, gintlemen, I don't want to escyape," asseverates he,
shivering at the sight of a score of angry faces, and the same
number of gun-barrels bearing upon his person; "I had no such
intinshuns.  I was only goin' to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Run off, if ye'd got the chance.  Ye'd made a good beginning.
Here, Dick Tracey! half-a-dozen turns of your trail-rope round
him.  Lend a hand, Shelton!  Damned queer-looking curse he is!
Surely, gentlemen, this can't be the man we're in search of?"</p>

<p>"No, no! it isn't.  Only his man John."</p>

<p>"Ho! hilloa, you round there at the back!  Keep your eyes
skinned.  We havn't got him yet.  Don't let as much as a cat
creep past you.  Now, sirree! who's inside?"</p>

<p>"Who's insoide?  The cyabin div yez mane?"</p>

<p>"Damn ye! answer the question that's put to ye!" says Tracey,
giving his prisoner a touch of the trail-rope.  "Who's inside the
shanty?"</p>

<p>"O Lard!  Needs must whin the divvel dhrives.  Wil, then,
thare's the masther for wan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ho! what's this?" inquires Woodley Poindexter, at this
moment, riding up, and seeing the spotted mare.
"Why&mdash;it&mdash;it's Looey's mustang!"</p>

<p>"It is, uncle," answers Cassius Calhoun, who has ridden up
along with him.</p>

<p>"I wonder who's brought the beast here?"</p>

<p>"Loo herself, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!  You're jesting, Cash?"</p>

<p>"No, uncle; I'm in earnest."</p>

<p>"You mean to say my daughter has been here?"</p>

<p>"Has been&mdash;still is, I take it."</p>

<p>"Impossible?"</p>

<p>"Look yonder, then!"</p>

<p>The door has just been opened.  A female form is seen
inside.</p>

<p>"Good God, it is my daughter!"</p>

<p>Poindexter drops from his saddle, and hastens up to the
hut&mdash;close followed by Calhoun.  Both go inside.</p>

<p>"Louises what means this?  A wounded man!  Is it
he&mdash;Henry?"</p>

<p>Before an answer can be given, his eye falls upon a cloak and
hat&mdash; Henry's!</p>

<p>"It is; he's alive!  Thank heaven!"  He strides towards the
couch.</p>

<p>The joy of an instant is in an instant gone.  The pale face
upon the pillow is not that of his son.  The father staggers back
with a groan.</p>

<p>Calhoun seems equally affected.  But the cry from him is an
exclamation of horror; after which he slinks cowed-like out of
the cabin.</p>

<p>"Great God!" gasps the planter; "what is it?  Can you explain,
Louise?"</p>

<p>"I cannot, father.  I've been here but a few minutes.  I found
him as you see.  He is delirious."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and&mdash;Henry?"</p>

<p>"They have told me nothing.  Mr Gerald was alone when I
entered.  The man outside was absent, and has just returned.  I
have not had time to question him."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but, how came <i>you</i> to be here?"</p>

<p>"I could not stay at home.  I could not endure the uncertainty
any longer.  It was terrible&mdash;alone, with no one at the
house; and the thought that my poor brother&mdash;<i>Mon
dieu</i>!  <i>Mon dieu</i>!"</p>

<p>Poindexter regards his daughter with a perplexed, but still
inquiring, look.</p>

<p>"I thought I might find Henry here."</p>

<p>"Here!  But how did you know of this place?  Who guided you?
You are by yourself!"</p>

<p>"Oh, father!  I knew the way.  You remember the day of the
hunt&mdash;when the mustang ran away with me.  It was beyond this
place I was carried. On returning with Mr Gerald, he told me he
lived here.  I fancied I could find the way back."</p>

<p>Poindexter's look of perplexity does not leave him, though
another expression becomes blended with it.  His brow contracts;
the shadow deepens upon it; though whatever the dark thought, he
does not declare it.</p>

<p>"A strange thing for you to have done, my daughter.
Imprudent&mdash;indeed dangerous.  You have acted like a silly
girl.  Come&mdash;come away!  This is no place for a
lady&mdash;for you.  Get to your horse, and ride home again. Some
one will go with you.  There may be a scene here, you should not
be present at.  Come, come!"  The father strides forth from the
hut, the daughter following with reluctance scarce concealed;
and, with like unwillingness, is conducted to her saddle.</p>

<p>The searchers, now dismounted, are upon the open ground in
front.</p>

<p>They are all there.  Calhoun has made known the condition of
things inside; and there is no need for them to keep up their
vigilance.</p>

<p>They stand in groups&mdash;some silent, some conversing.  A
larger crowd is around the Connemara man; who lies upon the
grass, last tied in the trail-rope.  His tongue is allowed
liberty; and they question him, but without giving much credit to
his answers.</p>

<p>On the re-appearance of the father and daughter, they face
towards them, but stand silent.  For all this, they are burning
with eagerness to have an explanation of what is passing.  Their
looks proclaim it.</p>

<p>Most of them know the young lady by sight&mdash;all by fame,
or name.  They feel surprise&mdash;almost wonder&mdash;at seeing
her there.  The sister of the murdered man under the roof of his
murderer!</p>

<p>More than ever are they convinced that this is the state of
the case. Calhoun, coming forth from the hut, has spread fresh
intelligence among them&mdash;facts that seem to confirm it.  He
has told them of the hat, the cloak&mdash;of the murderer
himself, injured in the death-struggle!</p>

<p>But why is Louise Poindexter
there&mdash;alone&mdash;unaccompanied by white or black, by
relative or slave?  A guest, too: for in this character does she
appear!  Her cousin does not explain it&mdash;perhaps he cannot.
Her father&mdash;can he?  Judging by his embarrassed air, it is
doubtful.</p>

<p>Whispers pass from lip to ear&mdash;from group to group. There
are surmises&mdash;many, but none spoken aloud.  Even the rude
frontiersmen respect the feelings&mdash;filial as
parental&mdash;and patiently await the
<i>eclaircissement</i>.</p>

<p>"Mount, Louise!  Mr Yancey will ride home with you."  The
young planter thus pledged was never more ready to redeem
himself.  He is the one who most envies the supposed happiness of
Cassius Calhoun.  In his soul he thanks Poindexter for the
opportunity.</p>

<p>"But, father!" protests the young lady, "why should I no wait
for you? You are not going to stay here?"  Yancey experiences a
shock of apprehension.  "It is my wish, daughter, that you do as
I tell you.  Let that be sufficient."</p>

<p>Yancey's confidence returns.  Not quite.  He knows enough of
that proud spirit to be in doubt whether it may yield
obedience&mdash;even to the parental command.</p>

<p>It gives way; but with an unwillingness ill disguised, even in
the presence of that crowd of attentive spectators.</p>

<p>The two ride off; the young planter taking the lead, his
charge slowly following&mdash;the former scarce able to conceal
his exultation, the latter her chagrin.</p>

<p>Yancey is more distressed than displeased, at the melancholy
mood of his companion.  How could it be otherwise, with such a
sorrow at her heart? Of course he ascribes it to that.</p>

<p>He but half interprets the cause.  Were he to look steadfastly
into the eye of Louise Poindexter, he might there detect an
expression, in which sorrow for the past is less marked, than
fear for the future.</p>

<p>They ride on through the trees&mdash;but not beyond ear-shot
of the people they have left behind them.</p>

<p>Suddenly a change comes over the countenance of the
Creole&mdash;her features lighting up, as if some thought of joy,
or at least of hope, had entered her soul.</p>

<p>She stops reflectingly&mdash;her escort constrained to do the
same.</p>

<p>"Mr Yancey," says she, after a short pause, "my saddle has got
loose. I cannot sit comfortably in it.  Have the goodness to look
to the girths!"</p>

<p>Yancey leaps to the ground, delighted with the duty thus
imposed upon him.</p>

<p>He examines the girths.  In his opinion they do not want
tightening.  He does not say so; but, undoing the buckle, pulls
upon the strap with all his strength.</p>

<p>"Stay!" says the fair equestrian, "let me alight.  You will
get better at it then."</p>

<p>Without waiting for his assistance, she springs from her
stirrup, and stands by the side of the mustang.</p>

<p>The young man continues to tug at the straps, pulling with all
the power of his arms.</p>

<p>After a prolonged struggle, that turns him red in the face, he
succeeds in shortening them by a single hole.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Poindexter; I think it will do."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will," rejoins the lady, placing her hand upon the
horn of her saddle, and giving it a slight shake.  "No doubt it
will do now. After all 'tis a pity to start back so soon.  I've
just arrived here after a fast gallop; and my poor Luna has
scarce had time to breathe herself.  What if we stop here a
while, and let her have a little rest? 'Tis cruel to take her
back without it."</p>

<p>"But your father?  He seemed desirous you should&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I should go home at once.  That's nothing.  'Twas only
to get me out of the way of these rough men&mdash;that was all.
He won't care; so long as I'm out of sight.  'Tis a sweet place,
this; so cool, under the shade of these fine trees&mdash;just now
that the sun is blazing down upon the prairie.  Let us stay a
while, and give Luna a rest!  We can amuse ourselves by watching
the gambols of these beautiful silver fish in the stream.  Look
there, Mr Yancey!  What pretty creatures they are!"</p>

<p>The young planter begins to feel flattered.  Why should his
fair companion wish to linger there with him?  Why wish to watch
the <i>iodons</i>, engaged in their aquatic
cotillon&mdash;amorous at that time of the year?</p>

<p>He conjectures a reply conformable to his own
inclinations.</p>

<p>His compliance is easily obtained.</p>

<p>"Miss Poindexter," says he, "it is for you to command me.  I
am but too happy to stay here, as long as you wish it."</p>

<p>"Only till Luna be rested.  To say the truth, sir, I had
scarce got out of the saddle, as the people came up.  See! the
poor thing is still panting after our long gallop."</p>

<p>Yancey does not take notice whether the spotted mustang is
panting or no.  He is but too pleased to comply with the wishes
of its rider.</p>

<p>They stay by the side of the stream.</p>

<p>He is a little surprised to perceive that his companion gives
but slight heed, either to the silver fish, or the spotted
mustang.  He would have liked this all the better, had her
attentions been transferred to himself.</p>

<p>But they are not.  He can arrest neither her eye nor her ear.
The former seems straying upon vacancy; the latter eagerly bent
to catch every sound that comes from the clearing.</p>

<p>Despite his inclinations towards her, he cannot help listening
himself. He suspects that a serious scene is there being
enacted&mdash;a trial before Judge Lynch, with a jury of
"Regulators."</p>

<p>Excited talk comes echoing through the tree-trunks.  There is
an earnestness in its accents that tells of some terrible
determination.</p>

<p>Both listen; the lady like some tragic actress, by the side-
scene of a theatre, waiting for her cue.</p>

<p>There are speeches in more than one voice; as if made by
different men; then one longer than the rest&mdash;a
harangue.</p>

<p>Louise recognises the voice.  It is that of her cousin
Cassius.  It is urgent&mdash;at times angry, at times
argumentative: as if persuading his audience to something they
are not willing to do.</p>

<p>His speech comes to an end; and immediately after it, there
are quick sharp exclamations&mdash;cries of assent&mdash;one
louder than the rest, of fearful import.</p>

<p>While listening, Yancey has forgotten the fair creature by his
side.</p>

<p>He is reminded of her presence, by seeing her spring away from
the spot, and, with a wild but resolute air, glide towards the
<i>jacale</i>!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch63"></a>CHAPTER SIXTY THREE.<br>

A JURY OF REGULATORS.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE cry, that had called the young Creole so suddenly from the
side of her companion, was the verdict of a jury&mdash;in whose
rude phrase was also included the pronouncing of the
sentence.</p>

<p>The word "hang" was ringing in her ears, as she started away
from the spot.</p>

<p>While pretending to take an interest in the play of the silver
fish, her thoughts were upon that scene, of less gentle
character, transpiring in front of the jacale.</p>

<p>Though the trees hindered her from having a view of the stage,
she knew the actors that were on it; and could tell by their
speeches how the play was progressing.</p>

<p>About the time of her dismounting, a tableau had been formed
that merits a minute description.</p>

<p>The men, she had left behind, were no longer in scattered
groups; but drawn together into a crowd, in shape roughly
resembling the circumference of a circle.</p>

<p>Inside it, some half-score figures were
conspicuous&mdash;among them the tall form of the Regulator
Chief, with three or four of his "marshals." Woodley Poindexter
was there, and by his side Cassius Calhoun.  These no longer
appeared to act with authority, but rather as spectators, or
witnesses, in the judicial drama about being enacted.</p>

<p>Such in reality was the nature of the scene.  It was a trial
for Murder&mdash;a trial before <i>Justice Lynch</i>&mdash;this
grim dignitary being typified in the person of the Regulator
Chief&mdash;with a jury composed of all the people upon the
ground&mdash;all except the prisoners.</p>

<p>Of these there are two&mdash;Maurice Gerald and his man
Phelim.</p>

<p>They are inside the ring, both prostrate upon the grass; both
fast bound in raw-hide ropes, that hinder them from moving hand
or foot.</p>

<p>Even their tongues are not free.  Phelim has been cursed and
scared into silence; while to his master speech is rendered
impossible by a piece of stick fastened bitt-like between his
teeth.  It has been done to prevent interruption by the insane
ravings, that would otherwise issue from his lips.</p>

<p>Even the tight-drawn thongs cannot keep him in place.  Two
men, one at each shoulder, with a third seated upon his knees,
hold him to the ground.  His eyes alone are free to move; and
these rolling in their sockets glare upon his guards with wild
unnatural glances, fearful to encounter.</p>

<p>Only one of the prisoners is arraigned on the capital charge;
the other is but doubtfully regarded as an accomplice.</p>

<p>The servant alone has been examined&mdash;asked to confess all
he knows, and what he has to say for himself.  It is no use
putting questions to his master.</p>

<p>Phelim has told his tale&mdash;too strange to be credited;
though the strangest part of it&mdash;that relating to his having
seen a horseman without ahead&mdash;is looked upon as the least
improbable!</p>

<p>He cannot explain it; and his story but strengthens the
suspicion already aroused&mdash;that the spectral apparition is a
part of the scheme of murder!</p>

<p>"All stuff his tales about tiger-fights and Indians!" say
those to whom he has been imparting them.  "A pack of lies,
contrived to mislead us&mdash; nothing else."</p>

<p>The trial has lasted scarce ten minutes; and yet the jury have
come to their conclusion.</p>

<p>In the minds of most&mdash;already predisposed to
it&mdash;there is a full conviction that Henry Poindexter is a
dead man, and that Maurice Gerald is answerable for his
death.</p>

<p>Every circumstance already known has been reconsidered; while
to these have been added the new facts discovered at the
jacale&mdash;the ugliest of which is the finding of the cloak and
hat.</p>

<p>The explanations given by the Galwegian, confused and
incongruous, carry no credit.  Why should they?  They are the
inventions of an accomplice.</p>

<p>There are some who will scarce stay to hear them&mdash;some
who impatiently cry out, "Let the murderer be hanged!"</p>

<p>As if this verdict had been anticipated, a rope lies ready
upon the ground, with a noose at its end.  It is only a lazo; but
for the purpose Calcraft could not produce a more perfect piece
of cord.</p>

<p>A sycamore standing near offers a horizontal limb&mdash;good
enough for a gallows.</p>

<p>The vote is taken <i>viva voce</i>.</p>

<p>Eighty out of the hundred jurors express their opinion: that
Maurice Gerald must die.  His hour appears to have come.</p>

<p>And yet the sentence is not carried into execution.  The rope
is suffered to lie guileless on the grass.  No one seems willing
to lay hold of it!</p>

<p>Why that hanging back, as if the thong of horse-hide was a
venomous snake, that none dares to touch?</p>

<p>The majority&mdash;the <i>plurality</i>, to use a true Western
word&mdash;has pronounced the sentence of death; some
strengthening it with rude, even blasphemous, speech.  Why is it
not carried out?</p>

<p>Why?  For want of that unanimity, that stimulates to immediate
action&mdash; for want of the proofs to produce it.</p>

<p>There is a minority not satisfied&mdash;that with less noise,
but equally earnest emphasis, have answered "No."</p>

<p>It is this that has caused a suspension of the violent
proceedings.</p>

<p>Among this minority is Judge Lynch himself&mdash;Sam Manly,
the Chief of the Regulators.  He has not yet passed sentence; or
even signified his acceptance of the acclamatory verdict.</p>

<p>"Fellow citizens!" cries he, as soon as he has an opportunity
of making himself heard, "I'm of the opinion, that there's a
doubt in this case; and I reckon we ought to give the accused the
benefit of it&mdash;that is, till he be able to say his own say
about it.  It's no use questioning him now, as ye all see.  We
have him tight and fast; and there's not much chance of his
getting clear&mdash;<i>if</i> guilty.  Therefore, I move we
postpone the trial, till&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the use of postponing it?" interrupts a voice already
loud for the prosecution, and which can be distinguished as that
of Cassius Calhoun.  "What's the use, Sam Manly?  It's all very
well for you to talk that way; but if <i>you</i> had a friend
foully murdered&mdash;I won't say cousin, but a son, a
brother&mdash;you might not be so soft about it.  What more do
you want to show that the skunk's guilty?  Further proofs?"</p>

<p>"That's just what we want, Captain Calhoun."</p>

<p>"Cyan <i>you</i> give them, Misther Cashius Calhoun?" inquires
a voice from the outside circle, with a strong Irish accent.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can."</p>

<p>"Let's have them, then!"</p>

<p>"God knows you've had evidence enough.  A jury of his own
stupid countrymen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bar that appellashun!" shouts the man, who has demanded the
additional evidence.  "Just remember, Misther Calhoun, ye're in
Texas, and not Mississippi.  Bear that in mind; or ye may run
your tongue into trouble, sharp as it is."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to offend any one," says Calhoun, backing out of
the dilemma into which his Irish antipathies had led him; "even
an Englishman, if there's one here."</p>

<p>"Thare ye're welcome&mdash;go on!" cries the mollified
Milesian.</p>

<p>"Well, then, as I was saying, there's been evidence
enough&mdash;and more than enough, in my opinion.  But if you
want more, I can give it."</p>

<p>"Give it&mdash;give it!" cry a score of responding voices;
that keep up the demand, while Calhoun seems to hesitate.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!" says he, squaring himself to the crowd, as if for
a speech, "what I've got to say now I could have told you long
ago.  But I didn't think it was needed.  You all know what's
happened between this man and myself; and I had no wish to be
thought revengeful.  I'm not; and if it wasn't that I'm sure he
has done the deed&mdash;sure as the head's on my body&mdash;"</p>

<p>Calhoun speaks stammeringly, seeing that the phrase,
involuntarily escaping from his lips, has produced a strange
effect upon his auditory&mdash;as it has upon himself.</p>

<p>"If not sure&mdash;I&mdash;I should still say nothing of what
I've seen, or rather heard: for it was in the night, and I saw
nothing."</p>

<p>"What did you hear, Mr Calhoun?" demands the Regulator Chief,
resuming his judicial demeanour, for a time forgotten in the
confusion of voting the verdict.  "Your quarrel with the
prisoner, of which I believe everybody has heard, can have
nothing to do with your testimony here. Nobody's going to accuse
you of false swearing on that account.  Please proceed, sir. What
did you hear?  And where, and when, did you hear it?"</p>

<p>"To begin, then, with the time.  It was the night my cousin
was missing; though, of course, we didn't miss him till the
morning.  Last Tuesday night."</p>

<p>"Tuesday night.  Well?"</p>

<p>"I'd turned in myself; and thought Henry had done the same.
But what with the heat, and the infernal musquitoes, I couldn't
get any sleep.</p>

<p>"I started up again; lit a cigar; and, after smoking it awhile
in the room, I thought of taking a turn upon the top of the
house.</p>

<p>"You know the old hacienda has a flat roof, I suppose?  Well,
I went up there to get cool; and continued to pull away at the
weed.</p>

<p>"It must have been then about midnight, or maybe a little
earlier.  I can't tell: for I'd been tossing about on my bed, and
took no note of the time.</p>

<p>"Just as I had smoked to the end of my cigar, and was about to
take a second out of my case, I heard voices.  There were two of
them.</p>

<p>"They were up the river, as I thought on the other side.  They
were a good way off, in the direction of the town.</p>

<p>"I mightn't have been able to distinguish them, or tell one
from 'tother, if they'd been talking in the ordinary way.  But
they weren't. There was loud angry talk; and I could tell that
two men were quarrelling.</p>

<p>"I supposed it was some drunken rowdies, going home from
Oberdoffer's tavern, and I should have thought no more about it.
But as I listened, I recognised one of the voices; and then the
other.  The first was my cousin Henry's&mdash;the second that of
the man who is there&mdash;the man who has murdered him."</p>

<p>"Please proceed, Mr Calhoun!  Let us hear the whole of the
evidence you have promised to produce.  It will be time enough
then to state your opinions."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen; as you may imagine, I was no little
surprised at hearing my cousin's voice&mdash;supposing him asleep
in his bed.  So sure was I of its being him, that I didn't think
of going to his room, to see if he was there.  I knew it was his
voice; and I was quite as sure that the other was that of the
horse-catcher.</p>

<p>"I thought it uncommonly queer, in Henry being out at such a
late hour: as he was never much given to that sort of thing.  But
out he was.  I couldn't be mistaken about that.</p>

<p>"I listened to catch what the quarrel was about; but though I
could distinguish the voices, I couldn't make out anything that
was said on either side.  What I did hear was Henry calling
<i>him</i> by some strong names, as if my cousin had been first
insulted; and then I heard the Irishman threatening to make him
rue it.  Each loudly pronounced the other's name; and that
convinced me about its being them.</p>

<p>"I should have gone out to see what the trouble was; but I was
in my slippers; and before I could draw on a pair of boots, it
appeared to be all over.</p>

<p>"I waited for half an hour, for Henry to come home.  He didn't
come; but, as I supposed he had gone back to Oberdoffer's and
fallen in with some of the fellows from the Fort, I concluded he
might stay there a spell, and I went back to my bed.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, I've told you all I know.  My poor cousin
never came back to Casa del Corvo&mdash;never more laid his side
on a bed,&mdash;for that we found by going to his room next
morning.  His bed that night must have been somewhere upon the
prairie, or in the chapparal; and there's the only man who knows
where."</p>

<p>With a wave of his hand the speaker triumphantly indicated the
accused&mdash; whose wild straining eyes told how unconscious he
was of the terrible accusation, or of the vengeful looks with
which, from all sides, he was now regarded.</p>

<p>Calhoun's story was told with a circumstantiality, that went
far to produce conviction of the prisoner's guilt.  The
concluding speech appeared eloquent of truth, and was followed by
a clamourous demand for the execution to proceed.</p>

<p>"Hang! hang!" is the cry from fourscore voices.</p>

<p>The judge himself seems to waver.  The minority has been
diminished&mdash;no longer eighty, out of the hundred, but ninety
repeat the cry.  The more moderate are overborne by the
inundation of vengeful voices.</p>

<p>The crowd sways to and fro&mdash;resembling a storm fast
increasing to a tempest.</p>

<p>It soon comes to its height.  A ruffian rushes towards the
rope.  Though none seem to have noticed it, he has parted from
the side of Calhoun&mdash; with whom he has been holding a
whispered conversation.  One of those "border ruffians" of
Southern descent, ever ready by the stake of the philanthropist,
or the martyr&mdash;such as have been late typified in the
<i>military murderers</i> of Jamaica, who have disgraced the
English name to the limits of all time.</p>

<p>He lays hold of the lazo, and quickly arranges its loop around
the neck of the condemned man&mdash;alike unconscious of trial
and condemnation.</p>

<p>No one steps forward to oppose the act.  The ruffian,
bristling with bowie-knife and pistols, has it all to himself or,
rather, is he assisted by a scoundrel of the same
kidney&mdash;one of the <i>ci-devant</i> guards of the
prisoner.</p>

<p>The spectators stand aside, or look tranquilly upon the
proceedings. Most express a mute approval&mdash;some encouraging
the executioners with earnest vociferations of "Up with him! Hang
him!"</p>

<p>A few seem stupefied by surprise; a less number show sympathy;
but not one dares to give proof of it, by taking part with the
prisoner.</p>

<p>The rope is around his neck&mdash;the end with the noose upon
it.  The other is being swung over the sycamore.</p>

<p>"Soon must the soul of Maurice Gerald go back to its God!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch64"></a>CHAPTER SIXTY FOUR.<br>

A SERIES OF INTERLUDES.</h2>

<p class="first">
"SOON the soul of Maurice Gerald must go back to its God!"</p>

<p>It was the thought of every actor in that tragedy among the
trees.  No one doubted that, in another moment, they would see
his body hoisted into the air, and swinging from the branch of
the sycamore.</p>

<p>There was an interlude, not provided for in the programme.  A
farce was being performed simultaneously; and, it might be said,
on the same stage.  For once the tragedy was more attractive, and
the comedy was progressing without spectators.</p>

<p>Not the less earnest were the actors in it.  There were only
two&mdash;a man and a mare.  Phelim was once more re-enacting the
scenes that had caused surprise to Isidora.</p>

<p>Engrossed by the arguments of Calhoun&mdash;by the purposes of
vengeance which his story was producing&mdash;the Regulators only
turned their attention to the chief criminal.  No one thought of
his companion&mdash; whether he was, or was not, an accomplice.
His presence was scarce perceived&mdash;all eyes being directed
with angry intent upon the other.</p>

<p>Still less was it noticed, when the ruffians sprang forward,
and commenced adjusting the rope.  The Galwegian was then
altogether neglected.</p>

<p>There appeared an opportunity of escape, and Phelim was not
slow to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Wriggling himself clear of his fastenings, he crawled off
among the legs of the surging crowd.</p>

<p>No one seemed to see, or care about, his movements.  Mad with
excitement, they were pressing upon each other&mdash;the eyes of
all turned upward to the gallows tree.</p>

<p>To have seen Phelim skulking off, it might have been supposed,
that he was profiting by the chance offered for
escape&mdash;saving his own life, without thinking of his
master.</p>

<p>It is true he could have done nothing, and he knew it.  He had
exhausted his advocacy; and any further interference on his part
would have been an idle effort, or only to aggravate the
accusers.  It was but slight disloyalty that he should think of
saving himself&mdash;a mere instinct of self-
preservation&mdash;to which he seemed yielding, as he stole off
among the trees.  So one would have conjectured.</p>

<p>But the conjecture would not have done justice to him of
Connemara.  In his flight the faithful servant had no design to
forsake his master&mdash; much less leave him to his fate,
without making one more effort to effect his delivery from the
human bloodhounds who had hold of him.  He knew he could do
nothing of himself.  His hope lay in summoning Zeb Stump, and it
was to sound that signal&mdash;which had proved so effective
before&mdash;that he was now stealing off from the scene, alike
of trial and execution.</p>

<p>On getting beyond the selvedge of the throng, he had glided in
among the trees; and keeping these between him and the angry
crowd, he ran on toward the spot where the old mare still grazed
upon her tether.</p>

<p>The other horses standing "hitched" to the twigs, formed a
tolerably compact tier all round the edge of the timber.  This
aided in screening his movements from observation, so that he had
arrived by the side of the mare, without being seen by any
one.</p>

<p>Just then he discovered that he had come without the apparatus
necessary to carry out his design.  The cactus branch had been
dropped where he was first captured, and was still kicking about
among the feet of his captors.  He could not get hold of it,
without exposing himself to a fresh seizure, and this would
hinder him from effecting the desired end.</p>

<p>He had no knife&mdash;no weapon of any kind&mdash;wherewith he
might procure another <i>nopal</i>.</p>

<p>He paused, in painful uncertainty as to what he should do.
Only for an instant.  There was no time to be lost.  His master's
life was in imminent peril, menaced at every moment.  No
sacrifice would be too great to save him; and with this thought
the faithful Phelim rushed towards the cactus-plant; and, seizing
one of its spinous branches in his naked hands, wrenched it from
the stem.</p>

<p>His fingers were fearfully lacerated in the act; but what
mattered that, when weighed against the life of his beloved
master?  With equal recklessness he ran up to the mare; and, at
the risk of being kicked back again, took hold of her tail, and
once more applied the instrument of torture!</p>

<p>By this time the noose had been adjusted around the
mustanger's neck, carefully adjusted to avoid fluke or failure.
The other end, leading over the limb of the tree, was held in
hand by the brace of bearded bullies&mdash;whose fingers appeared
itching to pull upon it.  In their eyes and attitudes was an air
of deadly determination.  They only waited for the word.</p>

<p>Not that any one had the right to pronounce it.  And just for
this reason was it delayed.  No one seemed willing to take the
responsibility of giving that signal, which was to send a fellow-
creature to his long account.  Criminal as they might regard
him&mdash;murderer as they believed him to be&mdash;all shied
from doing the sheriff's duty.  Even Calhoun instinctively held
back.</p>

<p>It was not for the want of will.  There was no lack of that on
the part of the ex-officer, or among the Regulators.  They showed
no sign of retreating from the step they had taken.  The pause
was simply owing to the informality of the proceedings.  It was
but the lull in the storm that precedes the grand crash.</p>

<p>It was a moment of deep solemnity&mdash;every one silent as
the tomb.  They were in the presence of death, and knew
it,&mdash;death in its most hideous shape, and darkest guise.
Most of them felt that they were abetting it. All believed it to
be nigh.</p>

<p>With hushed voice, and hindered gesture, they stood rigid as
the tree-trunks around them.  Surely the crisis had come?</p>

<p>It had; but not that crisis by everybody expected, by
themselves decreed.  Instead of seeing Maurice Gerald jerked into
the air, far different was the spectacle they were called upon to
witness,&mdash;one so ludicrous as for a time to interrupt the
solemnity of the scene, and cause a suspension of the harsh
proceedings.</p>

<p>The old mare&mdash;that they knew to be Zeb
Stump's&mdash;appeared to have gone suddenly mad.  She had
commenced dancing over the sward, flinging her heels high into
the air, and screaming with all her might.  She had given the cue
to the hundred horses that stood tied to the trees; and all of
them had commenced imitating: her wild capers, while loudly
responding to her screams!</p>

<p>Enchantment could scarce have produced a quicker
transformation than occurred in the tableau formed in front of
the jacale hut.  Not only was the execution suspended, but all
other proceedings that regarded the condemned captive.</p>

<p>Nor was the change of a comical character.  On the contrary,
it was accompanied by looks of alarm, and cries of
consternation!</p>

<p>The Regulators rushed to their arms&mdash;some towards their
horses.</p>

<p>"Indians!" was the exclamation upon every lip, though unheard
through the din.  Nought but the coming of Comanches could have
caused such a commotion&mdash;threatening to result in a
<i>stampede</i> of the troop!</p>

<p>For a time men ran shouting over the little lawn, or stood
silent with scared countenances.</p>

<p>Most having secured their horses, cowered behind
them&mdash;using them by way of shield against the chances of an
Indian arrow.</p>

<p>There were but few upon the ground accustomed to such prairie
escapades; and the fears of the many were exaggerated by their
inexperience to the extreme of terror.</p>

<p>It continued, till their steeds, all caught up, had ceased
their wild whighering; and only one was heard&mdash;the wretched
creature that had given them the cue.</p>

<p>Then was discovered the true cause of the alarm; as also that
the Connemara man had stolen off.</p>

<p>Fortunate for Phelim he had shown the good sense to betake
himself to the bushes.  Only by concealment had he saved his
skin: for his life was now worth scarce so much as that of his
master.</p>

<p>A score of rifles were clutched with angry energy,&mdash;their
muzzles brought to bear upon the old mare.</p>

<p>But before any of them could be discharged, a man standing
near threw his lazo around her neck, and choked her into
silence.</p>

<p>Tranquillity is restored, and along with it a resumption of
the deadly design.  The Regulators are still in the same
temper.</p>

<p>The ludicrous incident, whilst perplexing, has not provoked
their mirth; but the contrary.</p>

<p>Some feel shame at the sorry figure they have cut, in the face
of a false alarm; while others are chafed at the interruption of
the solemn ceremonial.</p>

<p>They return to it with increased vindictiveness&mdash;as
proved by their oaths, and angry exclamations.</p>

<p>Once more the vengeful circle closes around the
condemned&mdash;the terrible tableau is reconstructed.</p>

<p>Once more the ruffians lay hold of the rope; and for the
second time every one is impressed with the solemn thought:</p>

<p>"Soon must the soul of Maurice Gerald go back to its God!"</p>

<p>Thank heaven, there is another interruption to that stern
ceremonial of death.</p>

<p>How unlike to death is that bright form flitting under the
shadows,&mdash; flashing out into the open sunlight.</p>

<p>"A woman! a beautiful woman!"</p>

<p>'Tis only a silent thought; for no one essays to speak.  They
stand rigid as ever, but with strangely altered looks.  Even the
rudest of them respect the presence of that fair intruder.  There
is submission in their attitude, as if from a consciousness of
guilt.</p>

<p>Like a meteor she pauses through their midst&mdash;glides on
without giving a glance on either side&mdash;without speech,
without halt&mdash;till she stoops over the condemned man, still
lying gagged the grass.</p>

<p>With a quick clutch she lays hold of the lazo; which the two
hangmen, taken by surprise, have let loose.</p>

<p>Grasping it with both her hands, she jerks it from theirs.
"Texans! cowards!" she cries, casting a scornful look upon the
crowd.  "Shame! shame!"</p>

<p>They cower under the stinging reproach.  She
continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A trial indeed!  A fair trial!  The accused without
counsel&mdash;condemned without being heard!  And this you call
justice?  Texan justice?  My scorn upon you&mdash;not men, but
murderers!"</p>

<p>"What means this?" shouts Poindexter, rushing up, and seizing
his daughter by the arm.  "You are mad&mdash;Loo&mdash;mad!  How
come you to be here? Did I not tell you to go home?
Away&mdash;this instant away; and do not interfere with what does
not concern you!"</p>

<p>"Father, it does concern me!"</p>

<p>"How?&mdash;how?&mdash;oh true&mdash;as a sister!  This man is
the murderer of your brother."</p>

<p>"I will not&mdash;<i>cannot</i> believe it. Never&mdash;never!
There was no motive. O men! if you be men, do not act like
savages.  Give him a fair trial, and then&mdash;then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's had a fair trial," calls one from the crowd, who seems
to speak from instigation; "Ne'er a doubt about his being guilty.
It's him that's killed your brother, and nobody else.  And it
don't look well, Miss Poindexter&mdash;excuse me for saying
it;&mdash;but it don't look just the thing, that <i>you</i>
should be trying to screen him from his deserving."</p>

<p>"No, that it don't," chime in several voices.  "Justice must
take its course!" shouts one, in the hackneyed phrase of the law
courts.</p>

<p>"It must!&mdash;it must!" echoes the chorus.  "We are sorry to
disoblige you, miss; but we must request you to leave.  Mr
Poindexter, you'd do well to take your daughter away."</p>

<p>"Come, Loo!  'Tis not the place You must come away.  You
refuse!  Good God! my daughter; do you mean to disobey me?  Here,
Cash; take hold of her arm, and conduct her from the spot.  If
you refuse to go willingly, we must use force, Loo.  A good girl
now.  Do as I tell you.  Go!  Go!"</p>

<p>"No, father, I will not&mdash;I shall not&mdash;till you have
promised&mdash;till these men promise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We can't promise you anything, miss&mdash;however much we
might like it.  It ain't a question for women, no how.  There's
been a crime committed&mdash;a murder, as ye yourself know. There
must be no cheating of justice. There's no mercy for a
murderer!"</p>

<p>"No mercy!" echo a score of angry voices.  "Let him be
hanged&mdash;hanged&mdash; hanged!"</p>

<p>The Regulators are no longer restrained by the fair presence.
Perhaps it has but hastened the fatal moment.  The soul of
Cassius Calhoun is not the only one in that crowd stirred by the
spirit of envy.  The horse hunter is now hated for his supposed
good fortune.</p>

<p>In the tumult of revengeful passion, all gallantry is
forgotten,&mdash;that very virtue for which the Texan is
distinguished.</p>

<p>The lady is led aside&mdash;dragged rather than led&mdash;by
her cousin, and at the command of her father.  She struggles in
the hated arms that hold her&mdash;wildly weeping, loudly
protesting against the act of inhumanity.</p>

<p>"Monsters! murderers!" are the phrases that fall from her
lips.</p>

<p>Her struggles are resisted; her speeches unheeded.  She is
borne back beyond the confines of the crowd&mdash;beyond the hope
of giving help to him, for whom she is willing to lay down her
life!</p>

<p>Bitter are the speeches Calhoun is constrained to
hear&mdash;heartbreaking the words now showered upon him.  Better
for him he had not taken hold of her.</p>

<p>It scarce consoles him&mdash;that certainty of revenge.  His
rival will soon be no more; but what matters it?  The fair form
writhing in his grasp can never be consentingly embraced.  He may
kill the hero of her heart, but not conquer for himself its most
feeble affection!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch65"></a>CHAPTER SIXTY FIVE.<br>

STILL ANOTHER INTERLUDE.</h2>

<p class="first">
FOR a third time is the tableau reconstructed&mdash;spectators
and actors in the dread drama taking their places as before.</p>

<p>The lazo is once more passed over the limb; the same two
scoundrels taking hold of its loose end&mdash;this time drawing
it towards them till it becomes taut.</p>

<p>For the third time arises the reflection:</p>

<p>"Soon must the soul of Maurice Gerald go back to its God!"</p>

<p>Now nearer than ever does the unfortunate man seem to his end.
Even love has proved powerless to save him!  Wha power on earth
can be appealed to after this?  None likely to avail.</p>

<p>But there appears no chance of succour&mdash;no time for it.
There is no mercy in the stern looks of the Regulators&mdash;only
impatience.  The hangmen, too, appear in a hurry&mdash;as if they
were in dread of another interruption.  They manipulate the rope
with the ability of experienced executioners.  The physiognomy of
either would give colour to the assumption, that they had been
accustomed to the calling.</p>

<p>In less than sixty seconds they shall have finished the
"job."</p>

<p>"Now then, Bill!  Are ye ready?" shouts one to the
other&mdash;by the question proclaiming, that they no longer
intend to wait for the word.</p>

<p>"All right!" responds Bill.  "Up with the son of a skunk!  Up
with him!"</p>

<p>There is a pull upon the rope, but not sufficient to raise the
body into an erect position.  It tightens around the neck; lifts
the head a little from the ground, but nothing more!</p>

<p>Only one of the hangmen has given his strength to the pull.
"Haul, damn you!" cries Bill, astonished at the inaction of his
assistant.  "Why the hell don't you haul?"</p>

<p>Bill's back is turned towards an intruder, that, seen by the
other, has hindered him from lending a hand.  He stands as if
suddenly transformed into stone!</p>

<p>"Come!" continues the chief executioner.  "Let's go at it
again&mdash;both together.  Yee&mdash;up!  Up with him!"</p>

<p>"<i>No ye don't</i>!" calls out a voice in the tones of a
stentor; while a man of colossal frame, carrying a six-foot
rifle, is seen rushing out from among the trees, in strides that
bring him almost instantly into the thick of the crowd.</p>

<p>"No ye don't!" he repeats, stopping over the prostrate body,
and bringing his long rifle to bear upon the ruffians of the
rope.  "Not yet a bit, as this coon kalkerlates.  You, Bill
Griffin; pull that piece o' pleeted hoss-hair but the eighth o'
an inch tighter, and ye'll git a blue pill in yer stummuk as
won't agree wi' ye.  Drop the rope, durn ye! Drop it!"</p>

<p>The screaming of Zeb Stump's mare scarce created a more sudden
diversion than the appearance of Zeb himself&mdash;for it was he
who had hurried upon the ground.</p>

<p>He was known to nearly all present; respected by most; and
feared by many.</p>

<p>Among the last were Bill Griffin, and his fellow rope-holder.
No longer holding it: for at the command to drop it, yielding to
a quick perception of danger, both had let go; and the lazo lay
loose along the sward.</p>

<p>"What durned tom-foolery's this, boys?" continues the
colossus, addressing himself to the crowd, still speechless from
surprise.  "Ye don't mean hangin', do ye?"</p>

<p>"We do," answers a stern voice.  "And why not?" asks
another.</p>

<p>"Why not!  Ye'd hang a fellur-citizen 'ithout trial, wud
ye?"</p>

<p>"Not much of a fellow-citizen&mdash;so far as that goes.
Besides, he's had a trial&mdash;a fair trial."</p>

<p>"I'deed.  A human critter to be condemned wi' his brain in a
state o' dulleerium!  Sent out o' the world 'ithout knowin' that
he's in it!  Ye call that a fair trial, do ye?"</p>

<p>"What matters it, if we know he's guilty?  We're all satisfied
about that."</p>

<p>"The hell ye air!  Wagh!  I aint goin' to waste words wi' sech
as you, Jim Stoddars.  But for <i>you</i>, Sam Manly, an yerself,
Mister Peintdexter&mdash;shurly ye aint agreed to this hyur
proceeding which, in my opeenyun, 'ud be neyther more nor less 'n
murder?"</p>

<p>"You haven't heard all, Zeb Stump," interposes the Regulator
Chief, with the design to justify his acquiescence in the act.
"There are facts&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Facts be durned!  An' fancies, too!  I don't want to hear
'em.  It'll be time enuf for thet, when the thing kum to a
reg'lar trial; the which shurly nob'dy hyur'll objeck
to&mdash;seein' as thur aint the ghost o' a chance for <i>him</i>
to git off.  Who air the individooal that objecks?"</p>

<p>"You take too much upon you, Zeb Stump.  What is it your
business, we'd like to know?  The man that's been murdered wasn't
<i>your</i> son; nor your brother, nor your cousin neither!  If
he had been, you'd be of a different way of thinking, I take
it."</p>

<p>It is Calhoun who has made this interpolation&mdash;spoken
before with so much success to his scheme.</p>

<p>"I don't see that it concerns you," he continues, "what course
we take in this matter."</p>

<p>"But <i>I do</i>.  It consarns me&mdash;fust, because this
young fellur's a friend o' mine, though he air Irish, an a
strenger; an secondly, because Zeb Stump aint a goin' to stan'
by, an see foul play&mdash;even tho' it be on the purayras o'
Texas."</p>

<p>"Foul play be damned!  There's nothing of the sort.  And as
for standing by, we'll see about that.  Boys! you're not going to
be scared from your duty by such swagger as this?  Let's make a
finish of what we've begun. The blood of a murdered man cries out
to us.  Lay hold of the rope!"</p>

<p>"Do; an by the eturnal! the fust that do 'll drop it a leetle
quicker than he grups it.  Lay a claw on it&mdash;one o'
ye&mdash;if ye darr.  Ye may hang this poor critter as high's ye
like; but <i>not</i> till ye've laid Zeb'lon Stump streetched
dead upon the grass, wi' some o' ye alongside o' him. Now then!
Let me see the skunk thet's goin' to tech thet rope!"</p>

<p>Zeb's speech is followed by a profound silence.  The people
keep their places&mdash;partly from the danger of accepting his
challenge, and partly from the respect due to his courage and
generosity.  Also, because there is still some doubt in the minds
of the Regulators, both as to the expediency, and fairness, of
the course which Calhoun is inciting them to take.</p>

<p>With a quick instinct the old hunter perceives the advantage
he has gained, and presses it.</p>

<p>"Gie the young fellur a fair trial," urges he.  "Let's take
him to the settlement, an hev' him tried thur.  Ye've got no clur
proof, that he's had any hand in the black bizness; and durn me!
if I'd believe it unless I seed it wi' my own eyes.  I know how
he feeled torst young Peintdexter.  Instead o' bein' his enemy,
thur aint a man on this ground hed more o' a likin' for
him&mdash;tho' he did hev a bit o' shindy wi' his precious cousin
thur."</p>

<p>"You are perhaps not aware, Mr Stump," rejoins the Regulator
Chief, in a calm voice, "of what we've just been hearing?"</p>

<p>"What hev ye been hearin'?"</p>

<p>"Evidence to the contrary of what you assert.  We have proof,
not only that there was bad blood between Gerald and young
Poindexter, but that a quarrel took place on the very
night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who sez thet, Sam Manly?"</p>

<p>"I say it," answers Calhoun, stepping a little forward, so as
to be seen by Stump.</p>

<p>"O, you it air, Mister Cash Calhoun!  You know thur war bad
blood atween 'em?  You seed the quarrel ye speak o'?"</p>

<p>"I haven't said that I saw it, Zeb Stump.  And what's more I'm
not going to stand any cross-questioning by you.  I have given my
evidence, to those who have the right to hear it; and that's
enough.  I think, gentlemen, you're satisfied as to the verdict.
I don't see why this old fool should interrupt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ole fool!" echoes the hunter, with a screech; "Ole fool! Hell
an herrikins!  Ye call me an ole fool?  By the eturnal God! ye'll
live to take back that speech, or my name aint Zeblun Stump, o'
Kaintucky. Ne'er a mind now; thur's a time for everythin', an yur
time may come, Mister Cash Calhoun, sooner than ye surspecks
it."</p>

<p>"As for a quarrel atween Henry Peintdexter an the young fellur
hyur," continues Zeb, addressing himself to the Regulator Chief,
"I don't believe a word on't; nor won't, so long's thur's no
better proof than <i>his</i> palaverin'.  From what this chile
knows, it don't stan' to reezun. Ye say ye've got new facks?
So've I too.  Facks I reck'n thet'll go a good way torst
explicatin o' this mysteerus bizness, twisted up as it air."</p>

<p>"What facts?" demands the Regulator Chief.  "Let's hear them,
Stump."</p>

<p>"Thur's more than one.  Fust place what do ye make o' the
young fellur bein' wownded hisself?  I don't talk o' them
scratches ye see; I believe them's done by coyoats that attackted
him, arter they see'd he wur wownded.  But look at his knee
Somethin' else than coyoats did <i>that</i>. What do <i>you</i>
make o' it, Sam Manly?"</p>

<p>"Well, that&mdash;some of the boys here think there's been a
struggle between him and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Atween him an who?" sharply interrogates Zeb.</p>

<p>"Why, the man that's missing."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's he who we mean," speaks one of the "boys"
referred to.  "We all know that Harry Poindexter wouldn't a stood
to be shot down like a calf.  They've had a tussle, and a fall
among the rocks.  That's what's given him the swellin' in the
knee.  Besides, there's the mark of a blow upon his
head&mdash;looks like it had been the butt of a pistol.  As for
the scratches, we can't tell what's made them.  Thorns may be; or
wolves if you like.  That foolish fellow of his has a story about
a tiger; but it won't do for us."</p>

<p>"What fellur air ye talkin' o'?  Ye mean Irish Pheelum?  Where
air <i>he</i>?"</p>

<p>"Stole away to save his carcass.  We'll find him, as soon as
we've settled this business; and I guess a little hanging will
draw the truth out of him."</p>

<p>"If ye mean abeout the tiger, ye'll draw no other truth out o'
him than hat ye've got a'ready.  I see'd thet varmint myself, an
war jest in time to save the young fellur from its claws.  But
thet aint the peint. Ye've had holt o' the Irish, I 'spose.  Did
he tell ye o' nothin' else he seed hyur?"</p>

<p>"He had a yarn about Indians.  Who believes it?"</p>

<p>"Wal; he tolt me the same story, and that looks like some
truth in't. Besides, he declurs they wur playin' curds, an hyur's
the things themselves.  I found 'em lying scattered about the
floor o' the shanty. Spanish curds they air."</p>

<p>Zeb draws the pack out of his pocket, and hands it over to the
Regulator Chief.</p>

<p>The cards, on examination, prove to be of Mexican
manufacture&mdash;such as are used in the universal game of
<i>monte</i>&mdash;the queen upon horseback "cavallo"&mdash;the
spade represented by a sword "espada"&mdash;and the club "baston"
symbolised by the huge paviour-like implement, seen in picture-
books in the grasp of hairy Orson.</p>

<p>"Who ever heard of Comanches playing cards?" demands he, who
has scouted the evidence about the Indians.  "Damned
ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"Ridiklus ye say!" interposes an old trapper who had been
twelve months a prisoner among the Comanches.  "Ridiklus it may
be; but it's true f'r all that.  Many's the game this coon's seed
them play, on a dressed burner hide for their table.  That same
Mexikin <i>montay</i> too.  I reckon they've larned it from thar
Mexikin captives; of the which they've got as good as three
thousand in thar different tribes.  Yes, sirree!" concludes the
trapper.  "The Keymanchees <i>do</i> play cards&mdash;sure as
shootin'."</p>

<p>Zeb Stump is rejoiced at this bit of evidence, which is more
than he could have given himself.  It strengthens the case for
the accused.  The fact, of there having been Indians in the
neighbourhood, tends to alter the aspect of the affair in the
minds of the Regulators&mdash;hitherto under the belief that the
Comanches were marauding only on the other side of the
settlement.</p>

<p>"Sartin sure," continues Zeb, pressing the point in favour of
an adjournment of the trial, "thur's been Injuns hyur, or some
thin' durned like&mdash;Geesus Geehosofat!  Whar's <i>she</i>
comin' from?"</p>

<p>The clattering of hoofs, borne down from the bluff, salutes
the ear of everybody at the same instant of time.</p>

<p>No one needs to inquire, what has caused Stump to give
utterance to that abrupt interrogatory.  Along the top of the
cliff, and close to its edge, a horse is seen, going at a gallop.
There is a woman&mdash;a lady&mdash; upon his back, with hat and
hair streaming loosely behind her&mdash;the string hindering the
hat from being carried altogether away!</p>

<p>So wild is the gallop&mdash;so perilous from its proximity to
the precipice&mdash; you might suppose the horse to have run away
with his rider.</p>

<p>But no.  You may tell that he has not, by the actions of the
equestrian herself.  She seems not satisfied with the pace; but
with whip, spur, and voice keeps urging him to increase it!</p>

<p>This is plain to the spectators below; though they are puzzled
and confused by her riding so close to the cliff.</p>

<p>They stand in silent astonishment.  Not that they are ignorant
of who it is.  It would be strange if they were.  That woman
equestrian&mdash; man-seated in the saddle&mdash;once seen was
never more to be forgotten.</p>

<p>She is recognised at the first glance.  One and all know the
reckless galloper to be the guide&mdash;from whom, scarce half-
an-hour ago, they had parted upon the prairie.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch66"></a>CHAPTER SIXTY SIX.<br>

CHASED BY COMANCHES.</h2>

<p class="first">
IT was Isidora who had thus strangely and suddenly shown
herself.  What was bringing her back?  And why was she riding at
such a perilous pace?</p>

<p>To explain it, we must return to that dark reverie, from which
she was startled by her encounter with the "Tejanos."</p>

<p>While galloping away from the Alamo, she had not thought of
looking back, to ascertain whether she was followed.  Absorbed in
schemes of vengeance, she had gone on&mdash;without even giving a
glance behind.</p>

<p>It was but slight comfort to her to reflect: that Louise
Poindexter had appeared equally determined upon parting from the
jacale.  With a woman's intuitive quickness, she suspected the
cause; though she knew, too well, it was groundless.</p>

<p>Still, there was some pleasure in the thought: that her rival,
ignorant of her happy fortune, was suffering like herself.</p>

<p>There was a hope, too, that the incident might produce
estrangement in the heart of this proud Creole lady towards the
man so condescendingly beloved; though it was faint, vague,
scarce believed in by her who conceived it.</p>

<p>Taking her own heart as a standard, she was not one to lay
much stress on the condescension of love: her own history was
proof of its levelling power.  Still was there the thought that
her presence at the jacale had given pain, and might result in
disaster to the happiness of her hated rival.</p>

<p>Isidora had begun to dwell upon this with a sort of subdued
pleasure; that continued unchecked, till the time of her
rencontre with the Texans.</p>

<p>On turning back with these, her spirits underwent a change.
The road to be taken by Louise, should have been the same as
that, by which she had herself come.  But no lady was upon
it.</p>

<p>The Creole must have changed her mind, and stayed by the
jacale&mdash;was, perhaps, at that very moment performing the
<i>metier</i> Isidora had so fondly traced out for herself?</p>

<p>The belief that she was about to bring shame upon the woman
who had brought ruin upon her, was the thought that now consoled
her.</p>

<p>The questions put by Poindexter, and his companions,
sufficiently disclosed the situation.  Still clearer was it made
by the final interrogations of Calhoun; and, after her
interrogators had passed away, she remained by the side of the
thicket&mdash;half in doubt whether to ride on to the Leona, or
go back and be the spectator of a scene, that, by her own
contrivance, could scarce fail to be exciting.</p>

<p>She is upon the edge of the chapparal, just inside the shadow
of the timber.  She is astride her grey steed, that stands with
spread nostril and dilated eye, gazing after the <i>cavallada</i>
that has late parted from the spot&mdash;a single horseman in the
rear of the rest.  Her horse might wonder why he is being thus
ridden about; but he is used to sudden changes in the will of his
capricious rider.</p>

<p>She is looking in the same direction&mdash;towards the
<i>alhuehuete</i>;&mdash;whose dark summit towers above the
bluffs of the Alamo.</p>

<p>She sees the searchers descend; and, after them, the man who
has so minutely questioned her.  As his head sinks below the
level of the plain, she fancies herself alone upon it.</p>

<p>In this fancy she is mistaken.</p>

<p>She remains irresolute for a
time&mdash;ten&mdash;fifteen&mdash;twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Her thoughts are not to be envied.  There is not much
sweetness in the revenge, she believes herself instrumental in
having accomplished.  If she has caused humiliation to the woman
she hates, along with it she may have brought ruin upon the man
whom she loves?  Despite all that has passed, she cannot help
loving him!</p>

<p>"<i>Santissima Virgen</i>!" she mutters with a fervent
earnestness.  "What have I done?  If these
<i>men</i>&mdash;<i>Los Reguladores</i>&mdash;the dreaded judges
I've heard of&mdash;if they should find him guilty, where may it
end?  In his death!  Mother of God!  I do not desire that.  Not
by their hands&mdash;no! no!  How wild their looks and
gestures&mdash;stern&mdash;determined!  And when I pointed out
the way, how quickly they rode off, without further thought of
me!  Oh, they have made up their minds.  Don Mauricio is to die!
And he a stranger among them&mdash;so have I heard.  Not of their
country, or kindred; only of the same race.  Alone, friendless,
with many enemies. <i>Santissima</i>! what am I thinking of?  Is
not he, who has just left me, that cousin of whom I've heard
speak!  <i>Ay de mi</i>!  Now do I understand the cause of his
questioning.  His heart, like mine own&mdash;like mine own!"</p>

<p>She sits with her gaze bent over the open plain.  The grey
steed still frets under restraint, though the <i>cavallada</i>
has long since passed out of sight.  He but responds to the
spirit of his rider; which he knows to be
vacillating&mdash;chafing under some irresolution.</p>

<p>'Tis the horse that first discovers a danger, or something
that scents of it.  He proclaims it by a low tremulous neigh, as
if to attract her attention; while his head, tossed back towards
the chapparal, shows that the enemy is to be looked for in that
direction.</p>

<p>Who, or what is it?</p>

<p>Warned by the behaviour of her steed, Isidora faces to the
thicket, and scans the path by which she has lately passed
through it.  It is the road, or trail, leading to the Leona. 'Tis
only open to the eye for a straight stretch of about two hundred
yards.  Beyond, it becomes screened by the bushes, through which
it goes circuitously.</p>

<p>No one is seen upon it&mdash;nothing save two or three lean
coyotes, that skulk under the shadow of the trees&mdash;scenting
the shod tracks, in the hope of finding some scrap, that may have
fallen from the hurrying horsemen.</p>

<p>It is not these that have caused the grey to show such
excitement.  He sees them; but what of that?  The prairie-wolf is
a sight to him neither startling, nor rare.  There is something
else&mdash;something he has either scented, or heard.</p>

<p>Isidora listens: for a time without hearing aught to alarm
her.  The howl-bark of the jackal does not beget fear at any
time; much less in the joy of the daylight.  She hears only this.
Her thoughts again return to the "Tejanos"&mdash;especially to
him who has last parted from her side.  She is speculating on the
purpose of his earnest interrogation; when once more she is
interrupted by the action of her horse.</p>

<p>The animal shows impatience at being kept upon the spot;
snuffs the air; snorts; and, at length, gives utterance to a
neigh, far louder than before!</p>

<p>This time it is answered by several others, from horses that
appear to be going along the road&mdash;though still hidden
behind the trees.  Their hoof-strokes are heard at the same
time.</p>

<p>But not after.  The strange horses have either stopped short,
or gone off at a gentle pace, making no noise!</p>

<p>Isidora conjectures the former.  She believes the horses to be
ridden; and that their riders have checked them up, on hearing
the neigh of her own.</p>

<p>She quiets him, and listens.</p>

<p>A humming is heard through the trees.  Though indistinct, it
can be told to be the sound of men's voices&mdash;holding a
conversation in a low muttered tone.</p>

<p>Presently it becomes hushed, and the chapparal is again
silent.  The horsemen, whoever they are, continue
halted&mdash;perhaps hesitating to advance.</p>

<p>Isidora is scarce astonished at this, and not much alarmed.
Some travellers, perhaps, <i>en route</i> for the Rio
Grande&mdash;or, it may be, some stragglers from the Texan
troop&mdash;who, on hearing a horse neigh, have stopped from an
instinct of precaution.  It is only natural&mdash;at a time, when
Indians are known to be on the war-path.</p>

<p>Equally natural, that she should be cautious about
encountering the strangers&mdash;whoever they may be; and, with
this thought, she rides softly to one side&mdash;placing herself
and her horse under cover of a mezquit tree; where she again sits
listening.</p>

<p>Not long, before discovering that the horsemen have commenced
advancing towards her&mdash;not along the travelled trail, but
through the thicket! And not all together, but as if they had
separated, and were endeavouring to accomplish a surround!</p>

<p>She can tell this, by hearing the hoof-strokes in different
directions: all going gently, but evidently diverging from each
other; while the riders are preserving a profound silence,
ominous either of cunning or caution&mdash;perhaps of evil
intent?</p>

<p>They may have discovered her position?  The neighing of her
steed has betrayed it?  They may be riding to get round
her&mdash;in order to advance from different sides, and make sure
of her capture?</p>

<p>How is she to know that their intent is not hostile?  She has
enemies&mdash; one well remembered&mdash;Don Miguel Diaz.
Besides, there are the Comanches&mdash;to be distrusted at all
times, and now no longer <i>en paz</i>.</p>

<p>She begins to feel alarm.  It has been long in arising; but
the behaviour of the unseen horsemen is at least suspicious.
Ordinary travellers would have continued along the trail.  These
are sneaking through the chapparal!</p>

<p>She looks around her, scanning her place of concealment.  She
examines, only to distrust it.  The thin, feathery frondage of
the mezquit will not screen her from an eye passing near.  The
hoof-strokes tell, that more than one cavalier is coming that
way.  She must soon be discovered.</p>

<p>At the thought, she strikes the spur into her horse's side,
and rides out from the thicket.  Then, turning along the trail,
she trots on into the open plain, that extends towards the
Alamo.</p>

<p>Her intention is to go two or three hundred yards&mdash;beyond
range of arrow, or bullet&mdash;then halt, until she can discover
the character of those who are advancing&mdash;whether friends,
or to be feared.</p>

<p>If the latter, she will trust to the speed of her gallant grey
to carry her on to the protection of the "Tejanos."</p>

<p>She does not make the intended halt.  She is hindered by the
horsemen, at that moment seen bursting forth from among the
bushes, simultaneously with each other, and almost as soon as
herself!</p>

<p>They spring out at different points; and, in converging lines,
ride rapidly towards her!</p>

<p>A glance shows them to be men of bronze-coloured skins, and
half naked bodies&mdash;with red paint on their faces, and
scarlet feathers sticking up out of their hair.</p>

<p>"<i>Los Indios</i>!" mechanically mutters the Mexican, as,
driving the rowels against the ribs of her steed, she goes off at
full gallop for the <i>alhuehuete</i>.</p>

<p>A quick glance behind shows her she is pursued; though she
knows it without that.  The glance tells her more,&mdash;that the
pursuit is close and earnest&mdash;so earnest that the Indians,
contrary to their usual custom, <i>do not yell</i>!</p>

<p>Their silence speaks of a determination to capture her; and as
if by a plan already preconcerted!</p>

<p>Hitherto she has had but little fear of an encounter with the
red rovers of the prairie.  For years have they been <i>en
paz</i>&mdash;both with Texans and Mexicans; and the only danger
to be dreaded from them was a little rudeness when under the
influence of drink&mdash;just as a lady, in civilised life, may
dislike upon a lonely road, to meet a crowd of "navigators," who
have been spending their day at the beer-house.</p>

<p>Isidora has passed through a peril of this kind, and remembers
it&mdash;with less pain from the thought of the peril itself,
than the ruin it has led to.</p>

<p>But her danger is different now.  The peace is past.  There is
war upon the wind.  Her pursuers are no longer intoxicated with
the fire-water of their foes.  They are thirsting for blood; and
she flies to escape not only dishonour, but it may be death!</p>

<p>On over that open plain, with all the speed she can take out
of her horse,&mdash;all that whip, and spur, and voice can
accomplish!</p>

<p>She alone speaks.  Her pursuers are voiceless&mdash;silent as
spectres!</p>

<p>Only once does she glance behind.  There are still but four of
them; but four is too many against one&mdash;and that one a
woman!</p>

<p>There is no hope, unless she can get within hail of the
Texans.</p>

<p>She presses on for the <i>alhuehuete</i>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch67"></a>CHAPTER SIXTY SEVEN.<br>

LOS INDIOS!</h2>

<p class="first">
THE chased equestrian is within three hundred yards of the
bluff, over which the tree towers.  She once more glances behind
her.</p>

<p>"<i>Dios me ampare</i>!"  (God preserve me.)</p>

<p>God preserve her!  She will be too late!</p>

<p>The foremost of her pursuers has lifted the lazo from his
saddle horn: he is winding it over his head!</p>

<p>Before she can reach the head of the pass, the noose will be
around her neck, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>And then, a sudden thought flashes into her mind&mdash;thought
that promises escape from the threatened strangulation.</p>

<p>The cliff that overlooks the Alamo is nearer than the gorge,
by which the creek bottom must be reached.  She remembers that
its crest is visible from the jacale.</p>

<p>With a quick jerk upon the rein, she diverges from her course;
and, instead of going on for the <i>alhuehuete</i>, she rides
directly towards the bluff.</p>

<p>The change puzzles her pursuers&mdash;at the same time giving
them gratification.  They well know the "lay" of the land.  They
understand the trending of the cliff; and are now confident of a
capture.</p>

<p>The leader takes a fresh hold of his lazo, to make more sure
of the throw.  He is only restrained from launching it, by the
certainty she cannot escape.</p>

<p>"<i>Chingaro</i>!" mutters he to himself, "if she go much
farther, she'll be over the precipice!"</p>

<p>His reflection is false.  She goes farther, but not over the
precipice. With another quick pull upon the rein she has changed
her course, and rides along the edge of it&mdash;so close as to
attract the attention of the "Tejanos" below, and elicit from Zeb
Stump that quaint exclamation&mdash;only heard upon extraordinary
occasions&mdash;</p>

<p>"Geesus Geehosofat!"</p>

<p>As if in answer to the exclamation of the old hunter&mdash;or
rather to the interrogatory with which he has followed it
up&mdash;comes the cry of the strange equestrian who has shown
herself on the cliff.</p>

<p>"<i>Los Indios!  Los Indios</i>!"</p>

<p>No one who has spent three days in Southern Texas could
mistake the meaning of that phrase&mdash;whatever his native
tongue.  It is the alarm cry which, for three hundred years, has
been heard along three thousand miles of frontier, in three
different languages&mdash;"Les Indiens!  Los Indios! the
Indians!"</p>

<p>Dull would be the ear, slow the intellect, that did not at
once comprehend it, along with the sense of its associated
danger.</p>

<p>To those who hear it at the jacale it needs no translation.
They know that she, who has given utterance to it, is pursued by
Indians&mdash;as certain as if the fact had been announced in
their own Saxon vernacular.</p>

<p>They have scarce time to translate it into this&mdash;even in
thought&mdash;when the same voice a second time salutes their
ears:&mdash;"Tejanos!  Cavalleros! save me! save me!  Los Indios!
I am chased by a troop.  They are behind
me&mdash;close&mdash;close&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her speech, though continued, is no longer heard distinctly.
It is no longer required to explain what is passing upon the
plain above.</p>

<p>She has cleared the first clump of tree tops by scarce twenty
yards, when the leading savage shoots out from the same cover,
and is seen, going in full gallop, against the clear sky.</p>

<p>Like a sling he spins the lazo loop around his head.  So eager
is he to throw it with sure aim, that he does not appear to take
heed of what the fugitive has said&mdash;spoken as she went at
full speed: for she made no stop, while calling out to the
"Tejanos."  He may fancy it has been addressed to himself&mdash;a
final appeal for mercy, uttered in a language he does not
understand: for Isidora had spoken in English.</p>

<p>He is only undeceived, as the sharp crack of a rifle comes
echoing out of the glen,&mdash;or perhaps a little sooner, as a
stinging sensation in his wrist causes him to let go his lazo,
and look wonderingly for the why!</p>

<p>He perceives a puff of sulphureous smoke rising from
below.</p>

<p>A single glance is sufficient to cause a change in his
tactics.  In that glance he beholds a hundred men, with the gleam
of a hundred gun barrels!</p>

<p>His three followers see them at the same time; and as if moved
by the same impulse, all four turn in their tracks, and gallop
away from the cliff&mdash;quite as quickly as they have been
approaching it.</p>

<p>"'Tur a pity too," says Zeb Stump, proceeding to reload his
rifle.  "If 't hedn't a been for the savin' o' her, I'd a let 'em
come on down the gully.  Ef we ked a captered them, we mout a got
somethin' out o' 'em consarnin' this queer case o' ourn.  Thur
aint the smell o' a chance now.  It's clur they've goed off; an
by the time we git up yander, they'll be hellurd."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE sight of the savages has produced another
quick change in the tableau formed in front of the mustanger's
hut&mdash;a change squally sudden in the thoughts of those who
compose it.</p>

<p>The majority who deemed Maurice Gerald a murderer has become
transformed into a minority; while those who believed him
innocent are now the men whose opinions are respected.</p>

<p>Calhoun and his bullies are no longer masters of the
situation; and on the motion of their chief the Regulator Jury is
adjourned.  The new programme is cast in double quick time.  A
score of words suffice to describe it.  The accused is to be
carried to the settlement&mdash;there to be tried according to
the law of the land.</p>

<p>And now for the Indians&mdash;whose opportune appearance has
caused this sudden change, both of sentiment and design.  Are
they to be pursued? That of course.  But when?  Upon the instant?
Prudence says, no.</p>

<p>Only four have been seen.  But these are not likely to be
alone.  They may be the rear-guard of four hundred?</p>

<p>"Let us wait till the woman comes down," counsels one of the
timid. "They have not followed her any farther.  I think I can
hear her riding this way through the gulley.  Of course she knows
it&mdash;as it was she who directed us."</p>

<p>The suggestion appears sensible to most upon the ground.  They
are not cowards.  Still there are but few of them, who have
encountered the wild Indian in actual strife; and many only know
his more debased brethren in the way of trade.</p>

<p>The advice is adopted.  They stand waiting for the approach of
Isidora.</p>

<p>All are now by their horses; and some have sought shelter
among the trees.  There are those who have an apprehension: that
along with the Mexican, or close after her, may still come a
troop of Comanches.</p>

<p>A few are otherwise occupied&mdash;Zeb Stump among the number.
He takes the gag from between the teeth of the respited prisoner,
and unties the thongs hitherto holding him too fast.</p>

<p>There is one who watches him with a strange interest, but
takes no part in the proceeding.  Her part has been already
played&mdash;perhaps too prominently.  She shuns the risk of
appearing farther conspicuous.</p>

<p>Where is the niece of Don Silvio Mortimez?  She has not yet
come upon the ground!  The stroke of her horse's hoof is no
longer heard!  There has been time&mdash;more than time&mdash;for
her to have reached the jacale!</p>

<p>Her non-appearance creates
surprise&mdash;apprehension&mdash;alarm.  There are men there who
admire the Mexican maiden&mdash;it is not strange they
should&mdash;some who have seen her before, and some who never
saw her until that day.</p>

<p>Can it be, that she has been overtaken and captured?  The
interrogatory passes round.  No one can answer it; though all are
interested in the answer.</p>

<p>The Texans begin to feel something like shame.  Their
gallantry was appealed to, in that speech sent them from the
cliff, "Tejanos! Cavalleros!"</p>

<p>Has she who addressed it succumbed to the pursuer?  Is that
beauteous form in the embrace of a paint-bedaubed savage?</p>

<p>They listen with ears intent,&mdash;many with pulses that beat
high, and hearts throbbing with a keen anxiety.</p>

<p>They listen in vain.</p>

<p>There is no sound of hoof&mdash;no voice of
woman&mdash;nothing, except the champing of bitts heard close by
their side!</p>

<p>Can it be that she is taken?</p>

<p>Now that the darker design is stifled within their breasts,
the hostility against one of their own race is suddenly changed
into a more congenial channel.</p>

<p>Their vengeance, rekindled, burns fiercer than
ever&mdash;since it is directed against the hereditary foe.</p>

<p>The younger and more ardent&mdash;among whom are the admirers
of the Mexican maiden&mdash;can bear the uncertainty no longer.
They spring into their saddles, loudly declaring their
determination to seek her&mdash;to save her, or perish in the
attempt.</p>

<p>Who is to gainsay them?  Her pursuers&mdash;her captors
perhaps&mdash;may be the very men they have been in search
of&mdash;the murderers of Henry Poindexter!</p>

<p>No one opposes their intent.  They go off in search of
Isidora&mdash;in pursuit of the prairie pirates.</p>

<p>Those who remain are but few in number; though Zeb Stump is
among them.</p>

<p>The old hunter is silent, as to the expediency of pursuing the
Indians. He keeps his thoughts to himself: his only seeming care
is to look after the invalid prisoner&mdash;still
unconscious&mdash;still guarded by the Regulators.</p>

<p>Zeb is not the only friend who remains true to the mustanger
in his hour of distress.  There are two others equally faithful.
One a fair creature, who watches at a distance, carefully
concealing the eager interest that consumes her.  The other, a
rude, almost ludicrous individual, who, close by his side,
addresses the respited man as his "masther."  The last is Phelim,
who has just descended from his perch among the parasites of an
umbrageous oak&mdash;where he has for some time stayed&mdash;a
silent spectator of all that has been transpiring.  The change of
situation has tempted him back to earth, and the performance of
that duty for which he came across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>No longer lies our scene upon the Alamo.  In another hour the
jacale is deserted&mdash;perhaps never more to extend its
protecting roof over Maurice the mustanger.</p>

<h2><a id="ch68"></a>CHAPTER SIXTY EIGHT.<br>

THE DISAPPOINTED CAMPAIGNERS.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE campaign against the Comanches proved one of the
shortest&mdash;lasting only three or four days.  It was
discovered that these Ishmaelites of the West did not mean
war&mdash;at least, on a grand scale.  Their descent upon the
settlements was only the freak of some young fellows, about to
take out their degree as <i>braves</i>, desirous of signalising
the event by "raising" a few scalps, and capturing some horses
and horned cattle.</p>

<p>Forays of this kind are not unfrequent among the Texan
Indians.  They are made on private account&mdash;often without
the knowledge of the chief, or elders of the tribe&mdash;just as
an ambitious young mid, or ensign, may steal off with a score of
companions from squadron or camp, to cut out an enemy's craft, or
capture his picket guard.  These <i>marauds</i> are usually made
by young Indians out on a hunting party, who wish to return home
with something to show besides the spoils of the chase; and the
majority of the tribe is often ignorant of them till long after
the event.  Otherwise, they might be interdicted by the elders;
who, as a general thing, are averse to such <i>filibustering</i>
expeditions&mdash;deeming them not only imprudent, but often
injurious to the interests of the community.  Only when
successful are they applauded.</p>

<p>On the present occasion several young Comanches had taken out
their war-diploma, by carrying back with them the scalps of a
number of white women and boys.  The horses and horned cattle
were also collected; but these, being less convenient of
transport than the light scalp-locks, had been recaptured.</p>

<p>The red-skinned filibusters, overtaken by a detachment of
Mounted Rifles, among the hills of the San Saba, were compelled
to abandon their four-footed booty, and only saved their own
skins by a forced retreat into the fastnesses of the "Llano
Estacado."</p>

<p>To follow them beyond the borders of this sterile tract would
have required a <i>commissariat</i> less hastily established than
that with which the troops had sallied forth; and, although the
relatives of the scalped settlers clamoured loudly for
retaliation, it could only be promised them after due time and
preparation.</p>

<p>On discovering that the Comanches had retreated beyond their
neutral ground, the soldiers of Uncle Sam had no choice but to
return to their ordinary duties&mdash;each detachment to its own
fort&mdash;to await further commands from the head-quarters of
the "department."</p>

<p>The troops belonging to Port Inge&mdash;entrusted with the
guardianship of the country as far as the Rio Nueces&mdash;were
surprised on getting back to their cantonment to discover that
they had been riding in the wrong direction for an encounter with
the Indians!  Some of them were half mad with disappointment: for
there were several&mdash;young Hancock among the number&mdash;who
had not yet run their swords through a red-skin, though keenly
desirous of doing so!</p>

<p>No doubt there is inhumanity in the idea.  But it must be
remembered, that these ruthless savages have given to the white
man peculiar provocation, by a thousand repetitions of three
diabolical crimes&mdash;rape, rapine, and murder.</p>

<p>To talk of their being the aborigines of the country&mdash;the
real, but dispossessed, owners of the soil&mdash;is simple
nonsense.  This sophism, of the most spurious kind, has too long
held dominion over the minds of men.  The whole human race has an
inherent right to the whole surface of the earth: and if any
infinitesimal fraction of the former by chance finds itself idly
roaming over an extended portion of the latter, their exclusive
claim to it is almost too absurd for argument&mdash;even with the
narrowest-minded disciple of an aborigines society.</p>

<p>Admit it&mdash;give the <i>hunter</i> his half-dozen square
miles&mdash;for he will require that much to maintain
him&mdash;leave him in undisputed possession to all
eternity&mdash;and millions of fertile acres must remain
untilled, to accommodate this whimsical theory of <i>national</i>
right.  Nay, I will go further, and risk reproach, by
asserting:&mdash;that not only the savage, so called, but
civilised people should be unreservedly dispossessed&mdash;
whenever they show themselves incapable of turning to a good
account the resources which Nature has placed within their
limits.</p>

<p>The <i>exploitation</i> of Earth's treasures is a question not
confined to nations.  It concerns the whole family of
mankind.</p>

<p>In all this there is not one iota of agrarian
doctrine&mdash;not a thought of it.  He who makes these remarks
is the last man to lend countenance to <i>communism</i>.</p>

<p>It is true that, at the time spoken of, there were ruffians in
Texas who held the life of a red-skin at no higher value than an
English gamekeeper does that of a stoat, or any other vermin,
that trespasses on his preserves.  No doubt these ruffians are
there still: for ten years cannot have effected much change in
the morality of the Texan frontier.</p>

<p>But, alas! we must now be a little cautious about calling
names.  Our own story of Jamaica&mdash;by heaven! the blackest
that has blotted the pages of history&mdash;has whitewashed these
border <i>filibusteros</i> to the seeming purity of snow!</p>

<p>If things are to be judged by comparison, not so fiendish,
then, need appear the fact, that the young officers of Fort Inge
were some little chagrined at not having an opportunity to slay a
score or so of red-skins.  On learning that, during their
absence, Indians had been seen on the other side, they were
inspired by a new hope.  They might yet find the opportunity of
fleshing their swords, transported without stain&mdash;without
sharpening, too&mdash;from the military school of West Point.</p>

<p>It was a fresh disappointment to them, when a party came in on
the same day&mdash;civilians who had gone in pursuit of the
savages seen on the Alamo&mdash;and reported: that no Indians had
been there!</p>

<p>They came provided with proofs of their statement, which
otherwise would have been received with
incredulity&mdash;considering what had occurred.</p>

<p>The proofs consisted in a collection of miscellaneous
articles&mdash;an odd lot, as an auctioneer would describe
it&mdash;wigs of horse-hair, cocks' feathers stained blue, green,
or scarlet, breech-clouts of buckskin, mocassins of the same
material, and several packages of paint, all which they had found
concealed in the cavity of a cottonwood tree!</p>

<p>There could be no new campaign against Indians; and the
aspiring spirits of Fort Inge were, for the time, forced to
content themselves with such incidents as the situation
afforded.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its remoteness from any centre of civilised
life, these were at the time neither tame nor uninteresting.
There were several subjects worth thinking and talking about.
There was the arrival, still of recent date, of the most
beautiful woman ever seen upon the Alamo; the mysterious
disappearance and supposed assassination of her brother; the yet
more mysterious appearance of a horseman without a head; the
trite story of a party of white men "playing Indian"; and last,
though not of least interest, the news that the suspected
murderer had been caught, and was now inside the walls of their
own guardhouse&mdash;mad as a maniac!</p>

<p>There were other tales told to the disappointed
campaigners&mdash;of sufficient interest to hinder them from
thinking: that at Fort Inge they had returned to dull quarters.
The name of Isidora Covarubio do los Llanos&mdash;with her
masculine, but magnificent, beauty&mdash;had become a theme of
conversation, and something was also said, or surmised, about her
connection with the mystery that occupied all minds.</p>

<p>The details of the strange scenes upon the Alamo&mdash;the
discovery of the mustanger upon his couch&mdash;the determination
to hang him&mdash;the act delayed by the intervention of Louise
Poindexter&mdash;the respite due to the courage of Zeb
Stump&mdash;were all points of the most piquant
interest&mdash;suggestive of the wildest conjectures.</p>

<p>Each became in turn the subject of converse and commentary,
but none was discussed with more earnestness than that which
related to the innocence, or guilt, of the man accused of
murder.</p>

<p>"Murder," said the philosophic Captain Sloman, "is a crime
which, in my opinion, Maurice the mustanger is incapable of
committing.  I think, I know the fellow well enough to be sure
about that."</p>

<p>"You'll admit," rejoined Crossman, of the Rifles, "that the
circumstances are strong against him?  Almost conclusive, I
should say."</p>

<p>Crossman had never felt friendly towards the young Irishman.
He had an idea, that on one occasion the commissary's
niece&mdash;the belle of the Fort&mdash;had looked too smilingly
on the unknown adventurer.</p>

<p>"I consider it anything but conclusive," replied Sloman.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about young Poindexter being dead, and
having been murdered.  Every one believes that.  Well; who else
was likely to have done it?  The cousin swears to having
overheard a quarrel between him and Gerald."</p>

<p>"That precious cousin would swear to anything that suited his
purpose," interposed Hancock, of the Dragoons.  "Besides, his own
shindy with the same man is suggestive of suspicion&mdash;is it
not?"</p>

<p>"And if there <i>was</i> a quarrel," argued the officer of
infantry, "what then?  It don't follow there was a murder."</p>

<p>"Then you think the fellow may have killed Poindexter in a
fair fight?"</p>

<p>"Something of the sort is possible, and even probable.  I will
admit that much."</p>

<p>"But what did they have a difficulty about?" asked Hancock. "I
heard that young Poindexter was on friendly terms with the horse-
hunter&mdash; notwithstanding what had happened between him and
Calhoun.  What could they have quarrelled about?"</p>

<p>"A singular interrogation on <i>your</i> part, Lieutenant
Hancock!" answered the infantry officer, with a significant
emphasis on the pronoun.  "As if men ever quarrelled about
anything except&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except women," interrupted the dragoon with a laugh.</p>

<p>"But which woman, I wonder?  It could not be anything relating
to young Poindexter's sister?"</p>

<p>"<i>Quien sabe</i>?" answered Sloman, repeating the Spanish
phrase with an ambiguous shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Preposterous!" exclaimed Crossman.  "A horse-catcher daring
to set his thoughts on Miss Poindexter!  Preposterous!"</p>

<p>"What a frightful aristocrat you are, Crossman!  Don't you
know that love is a natural democrat; and mocks your artificial
ideas of distinction.  I don't say that in this case there's been
anything of the kind.  Miss Poindexter's not the only woman that
might have caused a quarrel between the two individuals in
question.  There are other damsels in the settlement worth
getting angry about&mdash;to say nothing of our own fair
following in the Fort; and why not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Captain Sloman," petulantly interrupted the lieutenant of
Rifles.  "I must say that, for a man of your sense, you talk very
inconsiderately. The ladies of the garrison ought to be grateful
to you for the insinuation."</p>

<p>"What insinuation, sir?"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose it likely that there's one of them would
condescend to speak to the person you've named?"</p>

<p>"Which?  I've named two."</p>

<p>"You understand me well enough, Sloman; and I you.  Our ladies
will, no doubt, feel highly complimented at having their names
connected with that of a low adventurer, a horse-thief, and
suspected assassin!"</p>

<p>"Maurice the mustanger may be the last&mdash;suspected, and
that is all.  He is neither of the two first; and as for our
ladies being above speech with him, in that as in many other
things, you may be mistaken, Mr Crossman.  I've seen more of this
young Irishman than you&mdash;enough to satisfy me that, so far
as <i>breeding</i> goes, he may compare notes with the best of
us.  Our grand dames needn't be scared at the thought of his
acquaintance; and, since you have raised the question, I don't
think they would shy from it&mdash;some of them at least&mdash;if
it were offered them. It never has.  So far as I have observed,
the young fellow has behaved with a modesty that betokens the
true gentleman.  I have seen him in their presence more than
once, and he has conducted himself towards them as if fully
sensible of his position.  For that matter, I don't think he
cares a straw about one or other of them."</p>

<p>"Indeed!  How fortunate for those, who might otherwise have
been his rivals!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is," quietly remarked the captain of infantry.</p>

<p>"Who knows?" asked Hancock, intentionally giving a turn to the
ticklish conversation.  "Who knows but the cause of
quarrel&mdash;if there's been one&mdash;might not be this
splendid señorita so much talked about?  I haven't seen her
myself; but, by all accounts, she's just the sort to make two
fellows as jealous as a pair of tiger-cats."</p>

<p>"It might be&mdash;who knows?" drawled Crossman, who found
contentment in the thought that the handsome Irishman might have
his amorous thoughts turned in any other direction than towards
the commissary's quarters.</p>

<p>"They've got him in the guard-house," remarked Hancock,
stating a fact that had just been made known to him: for the
conversation above detailed occurred shortly after their return
from the Comanche campaign. "His droll devil of a serving man is
along with him.  What's more; the major has just issued an order
to double the guard!  What does it mean, Captain Sloman&mdash;you
who know so much of this fellow and his affairs? Surely there's
no danger of his making an attempt to steal out of his
prison?"</p>

<p>"Not likely," replied the infantry officer, "seeing that he
hasn't the slightest idea that he's inside of one.  I've just
been to the guard-house to have a look at him.  He's mad as a
March hare; and wouldn't know his own face in a looking-
glass."</p>

<p>"Mad!  In what way?" asked Hancock and the others, who were
yet but half enlightened about the circumstances of the
mustanger's capture.</p>

<p>"A brain fever upon him&mdash;delirious?"</p>

<p>"Is that why the guards have been doubled?  Devilish queer if
it is. The major himself must have gone mad!"</p>

<p>"Maybe it's the suggestion&mdash;command I should rather
say&mdash;of the majoress.  Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"But what <i>does</i> it mean?  Is the old maje really afraid
of his getting out of the guard-house?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not that, I fancy.  More likely an apprehension of
somebody else getting into it."</p>

<p>"Ah! you mean, that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean that for Maurice the Mustanger there's more safety
inside than out.  Some queer characters are about; and there's
been talk of another Lynch trial.  The Regulators either repent
of having allowed him a respite; or there's somebody hard at work
in bringing about this state of public opinion.  It's lucky for
him that the old hunter has stood his friend; and it's but a
continuation of his good luck that we've returned so opportunely.
Another day, and we might have found the guardhouse
empty&mdash;so far as its present occupants are concerned.  Now,
thank God! the poor fellow shall have a fair trial."</p>

<p>"When is it to take place?"</p>

<p>"Whenever he has recovered his senses, sufficiently to know
that he's being tried!"</p>

<p>"It may be weeks before that."</p>

<p>"And it may be only days&mdash;hours.  He don't appear to be
very bad&mdash;that is, bodily.  It's his mind that's out of
order&mdash;more, perhaps, from some strange trouble that has
come over him, than any serious hurt he has received.  A day may
make all the difference; and, from what I've just heard, the
Regulators will insist on his being tried as soon as he shows a
return to consciousness.  They say, they won't wait for him to
recover from his wounds!"</p>

<p>"Maybe he'll be able to tell a story that'll clear him.  I
hope so."</p>

<p>This was said by Hancock.</p>

<p>"I doubt it," rejoined Crossman, with an incredulous shake of
the head. "<i>Nous verrons</i>!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it," said Sloman.  "<i>Nos veremos</i>!" he
added, speaking in a tone that seemed founded less upon
confidence than a wish that was father to the thought.</p>

<h2><a id="ch69"></a>CHAPTER SIXTY NINE.<br>

MYSTERY AND MOURNING.</h2>

<p class="first">
THERE is mourning in the mansion of Casa del Corvo, and
mystery among the members of Woodley Poindexter's family.</p>

<p>Though now only three in number, their intercourse is less
frequent than before, and marked by a degree of reserve that must
spring from some deep-seated cause.</p>

<p>They meet only at the hour of meals&mdash;then conversing only
on such topics as cannot well be shunned.</p>

<p>There is ample explanation of the sorrow, and much of the
solemnity.</p>

<p>The death&mdash;no longer doubted&mdash;of an only
son&mdash;an only brother&mdash; unexpected and still
unexplained&mdash;should account for the melancholy mien both of
father and daughter.</p>

<p>It might also explain the shadow seated constantly on the brow
of the cousin.</p>

<p>But there is something beyond this.  Each appears to act with
an irksome restraint in the presence of the others&mdash;even
during the rare occasions, on which it becomes necessary to
converse on the family misfortune!</p>

<p>Beside the sorrow common to all three, they appear to have
separate griefs that do not, and cannot, commingle.</p>

<p>The once proud planter stays within doors&mdash;pacing from
room to room, or around, the enclosed corridor&mdash;bending
beneath a weight of woe, that has broken down his pride, and
threatens to break his heart.  Even strong paternal affection,
cruelly bereaved, can scarce account for the groans, oft
accompanied by muttered curses, that are heard to issue from his
lips!</p>

<p>Calhoun rides abroad as of yore; making his appearance only at
the hours of eating and sleeping, and not regularly then.</p>

<p>For a whole day, and part of a night, he has been absent from
the place. No one knows where; no one has the right to
inquire.</p>

<p>Louise confines herself to her own room, though not
continuously.  There are times when she may be seen ascending to
the azotea&mdash;alone and in silent meditation.</p>

<p>There, nearer to Heaven, she seeks solace for the sorrows that
have assailed her upon Earth&mdash;the loss of a beloved
brother&mdash;the fear of losing one far more beloved, though in
a different sense&mdash;perhaps, a little also, the thought of a
scandal already attaching to her name.</p>

<p>Of these three sorrows the second is the strongest.  The last
but little troubles her; and the first, for a while keenly felt,
is gradually growing calmer.</p>

<p>But the second&mdash;the supreme pain of all&mdash;is but
strengthened and intensified by time!</p>

<p>She knows that Maurice Gerald is shut up within the walls of a
prison&mdash; the strong walls of a military guard-house.</p>

<p>It is not their strength that dismays her.  On the contrary,
she has fears for their weakness!</p>

<p>She has reasons for her apprehension.  She has heard of the
rumours that are abroad; rumours of sinister significance.  She
has heard talk of a second trial, under the presidency of Judge
Lynch and his rude coadjutors&mdash;not the same Judge Lynch who
officiated in the Alamo, nor all of the same jury; but a court
still less scrupulous than that of the Regulators; composed of
the ruffianism, that at any hour can be collected within the
bounds of a border settlement&mdash;especially when proximate to
a military post.</p>

<p>The reports that have thus gone abroad are to some a subject
of surprise.  Moderate people see no reason why the prisoner
should be again brought to trial in that irregular way.</p>

<p>The facts, that have late come to light, do not alter the
case&mdash;at least, in any way to strengthen the testimony
against him.</p>

<p>If the four horsemen seen were not Indians&mdash;and this has
been clearly shown by the discovery of the disguises&mdash;it is
not the less likely that they have had to do with the death of
young Poindexter.  Besides, there is nothing to connect
<i>them</i> with the mustanger, any more than if they had been
real Comanches.</p>

<p>Why, then, this antipathy against the respited prisoner, for
the second time surging up?</p>

<p>There is a strangeness about the thing that perplexes a good
many people.</p>

<p>There are a few that understand, or suspect, the cause.  A
very few: perhaps only three individuals.</p>

<p>Two of them are Zeb Stump and Louise Poindexter; the third
Captain Cassius Calhoun.</p>

<p>The old hunter, with instinct keenly on the alert, has
discovered some underhanded action&mdash;the actors being Miguel
Diaz and his men, associated with a half-score of like characters
of a different race&mdash;the "rowdies" of the settlement.  Zeb
has traced the action to its instigator&mdash;the ex-captain of
volunteer cavalry.</p>

<p>He has communicated his discovery to the young Creole, who is
equal to the understanding of it.  It is the too clear
comprehension of its truth that now inspires her with a keen
solicitude.</p>

<p>Anxiously she awaits every word of news&mdash;watches the road
leading from the Fort to Casa del Corvo, as if the sentence of
her own death, or the security of her life, hung upon the lips of
some courier to come that way!</p>

<p>She dares not show herself at the prison.  There are soldiers
on guard, and spectators around it&mdash;a crowd of the idle
curious, who, in all countries, seem to feel some sort of sombre
enjoyment in the proximity of those who have committed great
crimes.</p>

<p>There is an additional piquancy in the circumstances of this
one.  The criminal is insane; or, at all events, for the time out
of his senses.</p>

<p>The guard-house doors are at all hours besieged&mdash;to the
great discomfort of the sentries&mdash;by people eager to listen
to the mutterings of the delirious man.  A lady could not pass in
without having scores of eyes turned inquiringly upon her. Louise
Poindexter cannot run the gauntlet of those looks without risk to
her reputation.</p>

<p>Left to herself, perhaps she would have attempted it.  Watched
by a father whose suspicions are already awakened; by a near
relation, equally interested in preserving her spotless, before
the eyes of the world&mdash;she has no opportunity for the act of
imprudence.</p>

<p>She can only stay at home; now shut up in her solitary
chamber, solaced by the remembrance of those ravings to which she
had listened upon the Alamo; now upon the azotea, cheered by the
recollection of that sweet time spent among the <i>mezquite</i>
trees, the spot itself almost discernible, where she had
surrendered the proudest passion of her heart; but saddened by
the thought that he to whom she surrendered it is now
humiliated&mdash;disgraced&mdash;shut up within the walls of a
gaol&mdash;perchance to be delivered from it only unto death!</p>

<p>To her it was happy tidings, when, upon the morning of the
fourth day, Zeb Stump made his appearance at Casa del Corro,
bringing the intelligence; that the "hoss-sogers hed kum back to
the Fort."</p>

<p>There was significance in the news thus ungrammatically
imparted.  There was no longer a danger of the perpetration of
that foul act hitherto apprehended: a prisoner taken from his
guards, not for rescue, but ruin!</p>

<p>"Ee needn't be uneezy 'beout thet ere ewent," said Zeb,
speaking with a confidence he had not shown for some time.
"Thur's no longer a danger o' it comin' to pass, Miss Lewaze.
I've tuk preecaushins agin it."</p>

<p>"Precautions!  How, Zeb?"</p>

<p>"Wal; fust place, I've seed the major clost arter his comin'
back, an gied him a bit o' my mind.  I tolt him the hul story, as
fur's I know it myself.  By good luck he ain't agin the young
fellur, but the tother way I reck'n.  Wal, I tolt him o' the
goin's on o' the hul crew&mdash;Amerikins, Mexikins, an all o'
them&mdash;not forgettin' thet ugly Spanyard o' the name o' Dee-
ez, thet's been one o' the sarciest o' the lot.  The ree-sult's
been thet the major hez doubled the sentries roun' the prison,
an's goin' to keep 'em doubled."</p>

<p>"I am so glad!  You think there is no longer any fear from
that quarter?"</p>

<p>"If you mean the quarter o' Mister Migooel Dee-ez, I kin swar
to it. Afore he thinks o' gittin' any b'dy else out o' a prison,
he's got to git hisself out."</p>

<p>"What; Diaz in prison!  How?  When?  Where?"</p>

<p>"You've asked three seprit questyuns, Miss Lewaze, all o' a
heep.  Wal; I reck'n the conveenientest way to answer 'em 'll be
to take 'em backurds.  An' fust as to the <i>whar</i>.  As to
thet, thur's but one prison in these parts, as 'ud be likely to
hold him.  Thet is the guard-house at the Fort.  He's thur."</p>

<p>"Along with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know who ye're goin' to name&mdash;the young fellur.  Jest
so.  They're in the same buildin', tho' not 'zackly in the same
room.  Thur's a purtition atween 'em; tho' for thet matter they
kin convarse, ef they're so inclined.  Thur's three others shet
up along wi' the Mexikin&mdash;his own cussed cummarades.  The
three 'll have somethin' to talk 'beout 'mong themselves, I
reck'n."</p>

<p>"This is good news, Zeb.  You told me yesterday that Diaz was
active in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gittin' hisself into a scrape, which he hev been successful
in effectuatin'.  He's got hisself into the jug, or someb'y else
hev did thet bizness for him."</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;when&mdash;you've not told me?"</p>

<p>"Geehosophat!  Miss Lewaze.  Gi' me a leetle time.  I hain't
drew breath yit, since I kim in.  Yur second questyun war
<i>when</i>.  It air eezy answered.  'Beout a hour agone thet ere
varmint wur trapped an locked up.  I war at the shettin' o' the
door ahint him, an kum straight custrut hyur arter it war
done."</p>

<p>"But you have not yet said why he is arrested."</p>

<p>"I hain't hed a chance.  It air a longish story, an 'll take a
leetle time in the tellin'.  Will ye listen to it now, or
arter&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"After what, Mr Stump?"</p>

<p>"Wal, Miss Lewaze, I only meened arter&mdash;arter&mdash;I git
the ole mare put up.  She air stannin' thur, as if she'd like to
chaw a yeer o' corn, an somethin' to wet it down.  Both she 'nd
me's been on a longish tramp afore we got back to the Fort; which
we did scace a hour ago."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, dear Mr Stump, for not thinking of it.  Pluto;
take Mr Stump's horse to the stable, and see that it is fed.
Florinde! Florinde!  What will you eat, Mr Stump?"</p>

<p>"Wal, as for thet, Miss Lewaze, thank ye all the same, but I
ain't so partikler sharp set.  I war only thinkin' o' the maar.
For myself, I ked go a kupple o' hours longer 'ithout eetin', but
ef thur's sech a thing as a smell o' Monongaheely 'beout the
place, it 'ud do this ole karkidge o' mine a power o' good."</p>

<p>"Monongahela? plenty of it.  Surely you will allow me to give
you something better?"</p>

<p>"Better 'n Monongaheely!"</p>

<p>"Yes.  Some sherry&mdash;champagne&mdash;brandy if you prefer
it."</p>

<p>"Let them drink brandy as like it, and kin' git it drinkable.
Thur may be some o' it good enuf; an ef thur air, I'm shor it'll
be foun' in the house o' a Peintdexter.  I only knows o' the sort
the sutler keeps up at the Fort.  Ef thur ever wur a medicine,
thet's one.  It 'ud rot the guts out o' a alleygatur.  No; darn
thur French lickers; an specially thur brandy.  Gi' me the pure
corn juice; an the best o' all, thet as comes from Pittsburgh on
the Monongaheely."</p>

<p>"Florinde!  Florinde!"</p>

<p>It was not necessary to tell the waiting-maid for what she was
wanted. The presence of Zeb Stump indicated the service for which
she had been summoned.  Without waiting to receive the order she
went off, and the moment after returned, carrying a decanter
half-filled with what Zeb called the "pure corn juice," but which
was in reality the essence of rye&mdash;for from this grain is
distilled the celebrated "Monongahela."</p>

<p>Zeb was not slow to refresh himself.  A full third of the
contents of the decanter were soon put out of sight&mdash;the
other two-thirds remaining for future potations that might be
required in the course of the narration upon which he was about
to enter.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch70"></a>CHAPTER SEVENTY.<br>

GO, ZEB, AND GOD SPEED YOU!</h2>

<p class="first">
THE old hunter never did things in a hurry.  Even his style of
drinking was not an exception; and although there was no time
wasted, he quaffed the Monongahela in a formal leisurely
manner.</p>

<p>The Creole, impatient to hear what he had to relate, did not
wait for him to resume speech.</p>

<p>"Tell me, dear Zeb," said she, after directing her maid to
withdraw, "why have they arrested this Mexican&mdash;Miguel Diaz
I mean?  I think I know something of the man.  I have
reasons."</p>

<p>"An' you ain't the only purson may hev reezuns for knowin'
him, Miss Lewaze.  Yur brother&mdash;but never mind 'beout
that&mdash;leastwise not now. What Zeb Stump <i>do</i> know, or
strongly surspect, air, thet this same-mentioned Migooel Dee-ez
hev had somethin' to do wi'&mdash;You know what I'm refarrin'
to?"</p>

<p>"Go on, Mr Stump!"</p>

<p>"Wal, the story air this.  Arter we kim from the Alamo Crik,
the fellurs that went in sarch o' them Injuns, foun' out they
wan't Injuns at all. Ye hev heern that yurself.  From the fixins
that war diskevered in the holler tree, it air clur that what we
seed on the Bluff war a party o' whites.  I hed a surspishun o't
myself&mdash;soon as I seed them curds they'd left ahint 'em in
the shanty."</p>

<p>"It was the same, then, who visited the jacale at
night&mdash;the same Phalim saw?"</p>

<p>"Ne'er a doubt o' it.  Them same Mexikins."</p>

<p>"What reason have you to think they were Mexicans?"</p>

<p>"The best o' all reezuns.  I foun' 'em out to be; traced the
hul kit o' 'em to thur <i>cache</i>."</p>

<p>The young Creole made no rejoinder.  Zeb's story promised a
revelation that might be favourable to her hopes.  She stood
resignedly waiting for him to continue.</p>

<p>"Ye see, the curds, an also some words, the which the Irish
war able to sort o' pernounce, arter a fashun o' his own, tolt me
they must a been o' the yeller-belly breed; an sartint 'bout that
much, I war able to gie a tol'able guess as to whar they hed kim
from.  I know'd enuf o' the Mexikins o' these parts to think o'
four as answered thar descripshun to a T.  As to the Injun duds,
thar warn't nuthin' in them to bamboozle me. Arter this, I ked a
gone straight to the hul four fellurs, an pinted 'em out for
sartin.  One o' 'em, for sure sartin.  On him I'd made my mark. I
war confident o' havin' did thet."</p>

<p>"Your mark!  How, Zeb?"</p>

<p>"Ye remimber the shot I fired from the door o' the
shanty?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly!  I did not see the Indians.  I was under the
trees at the time.  I saw you discharge your rifle at
something."</p>

<p>"Wal, Miss Lewaze; this hyur coon don't often dischurge thet
thur weepun 'ithout drawin' blood.  I know'd I hut the skunk; but
it war rayther fur for the carry o' the piece, an I reckon'd the
ball war a bit spent.  F'r all that, I know'd it must a stung
him.  I seed him squirm to the shot, an I says to myself: Ef ther
ain't a hole through his hide somewhar, this coon won't mind
changin' skins wi' him.  Wal, arter they kim home wi' the story
o' whites instead o' red-skins, I hed a tol'able clur idee o' who
the sham Injuns wur, an ked a laid my claws on 'em at any minnit.
But I didn't."</p>

<p>"And why not, Mr Stump?  Surely you haven't allowed them to
get away? They might be the very men who are guilty of my poor
brother's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's jest what this coon thort, an it war for that reezun I
let 'em slide.  There war another reezun besides.  I didn't much
like goin' fur from the Port, leest somethin' ugly mout turn up
in my absince.  You unnerstan'?  There war another reezun still
for not prospectin' arter them jest then.  I wanted to make shur
o' my game."</p>

<p>"And you have?"</p>

<p>"Shur as shootin'.  I guessed thur wan't goin' to be any rain,
an thurfor thur war no immeedyit hurry as to what I intended
doin'.  So I waited till the sogers shed get back, an I ked
safely leave him in the guard-house.  Soon as they kim in, I tuk
the ole maar and rud out to the place whar our fellurs had struck
upon the fixing.  I eezy foun' it by thur descripshun.  Wal; as
they'd only got that greenhorn, Spangler, to guide 'em, I war
putty sure the sign hedn't been more'n helf read; an that
<i>I'd</i> get somethin' out o' it, beside what they'd brought
away."</p>

<p>"I wan't disappinted.  The durndest fool as ever set fut upon
a purayra, mout a follered the back track o' them make-believe
Kimanchees.  A storekeeper ked a traced it acrost the purayra,
though it appears neyther Mister Spangler nor any o' the others
did.  I foun' it eezy as fallin' off o' a log, not 'ithstandin'
thet the sarchers had rud all over it.  I tracked every hoss o'
the four counterfits to his own stable."</p>

<p>"After that?"</p>

<p>"Arter doin' thet I hed a word wi' the major; an in helf an
hour at the most the four beauties wur safe shot up in the
guardhouse&mdash;the chief o' 'em bein' jugged fust, leest he
mout get wind o' what wur goin' forrard, an sneak out o' the way.
I wan't fur astray 'beout Mister Migooel Dee-ez bearin' my mark.
We foun' the tar o' a bullet through the fleshy part o' his
dexter wing; an thet explained why he wur so quick at lettin' go
his laryette."</p>

<p>"It was he, then!" mechanically remarked Louise, as she stood
reflecting.</p>

<p>"Very strange!" she continued, still muttering the words to
herself. "He it was I saw in the chapparal glade!  Yes, it must
have been!  And the woman&mdash;this Mexican&mdash;Isidora?  Ah!
There is some deep mystery in all this&mdash;some dark design!
Who can unravel it?"</p>

<p>"Tell me, dear Zeb," she asked, stepping closer to the old
hunter, and speaking with a cartain degree of hesitancy.  "That
woman&mdash;the Mexican lady I mean&mdash;who&mdash;who was out
there.  Do you know if she has often visited him?"</p>

<p>"Him!  Which him, Miss Lewaze?"</p>

<p>"Mr Gerald, I mean."</p>

<p>"She mout, an she moutn't&mdash;'ithout my knowin' eyther one
or the tother. I ain't often thur myself.  The place air out o'
my usooal huntin' ground, an I only go now an then for the sake
o' a change.  The crik's fust rate for both deer an gobbler.  If
ye ask my opeenyun, I'd say that thet ere gurl heven't never been
thur afore.  Leestwise, I hain't heern o' it; an eft hed been so,
I reckun Irish Pheelum ud a hed somethin' to say abeout it.
Besides, I hev other reezuns for thinkin' so.  I've only heern o'
one o' the shemale sex bein' on a visit to thet shanty."</p>

<p>"Who?" quickly interrogated the Creole, the instant after
regretting that she had asked the question&mdash;the colour
coming to her cheeks, as she noticed the significant glance with
which Zeb had accompanied his concluding remark.</p>

<p>"No matter," she continued, without waiting for the
answer.</p>

<p>"So, Zeb," she went on, giving a quick turn to the
conversation, "you think that these men have had to do with that
which is causing sorrow to all of us,&mdash;these Mexicans?"</p>

<p>"To tell ye the truth, Miss Lewaze, I don't know zackly what
to think. It air the most musteeriousest consarn as iver kim to
pass on these hyur purayras.  Sometimes I hev the idea that the
Mexikins must a did it; while at others, I'm in the opposite way
o' thinkin', an thet some'dy else hev hed a han' in the black
bizness.  I won't say who."</p>

<p>"Not <i>him</i>, Zeb; not <i>him</i>!"</p>

<p>"Not the mowstanger.  No, neer a bit o' thet.  Spite o' all
that's sayed agin him, I hain't the leest surspishun o' his
innersense."</p>

<p>"Oh! how is he to prove it?  It is said, that the testimony is
all against him!  No one to speak a word in his behalf!"</p>

<p>"Wal, it ain't so sartint as to thet.  Keepin' my eye upon the
others, an his prison; I hain't hed much chance o' gettin'
abeout.  Thur's a opportunity now; an I mean to make use o' it.
The purayra's a big book, Miss Peintdexter&mdash;a wonderful big
book&mdash;for them as knows how to read the print o't.  If not
much o' a scholar otherways, Zeb'lon Stump hev larnt to do thet.
Thur may be some testymoney that mout help him, scattered over
the musquit grass&mdash;jest as I've heern a Methody preecher
say, thur 'war sarmints in stones, an books in runnin' brutes.'
Eft air so, thur oughter be somethin' o' the kind scared up on
the Alamo crik."</p>

<p>"You think you might discover some traces?"</p>

<p>"Wal; I'm goin' out to hev a look 'roun' me&mdash;speecially
at the place whur I foun' the young fellur in the claws o' the
spotted painter.  I oughter gone afore now, but for the reezun
I've tolt ye.  Thank the Awlmighty! thur's been no wet&mdash;neer
y drop; an whatsomiver sign's been made for a week past, kin be
understood as well, as if it war did yisterday&mdash;that is by
them as knows how to read it.  I must start straight away, Miss
Lewaze.  I jest runned down to tell ye what hed been done at the
Fort.  Thur's no time to be throwed away.  They let me in this
mornin' to see the young fellur; an I'm sartin his head air
gettin' clurrer.  Soon as it air all right, the Reg'lators say,
they'll insist on the trial takin' place.  It may be in less'n
three days; an I must git back afore it begins."</p>

<p>"Go, Zeb, and God speed you on your generous errand!  Come
back with proofs of <i>his</i> innocence, and ever after I shall
feel indebted to you for&mdash;for&mdash;more than life!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch71"></a>CHAPTER SEVENTY ONE.<br>

THE SORELL HORSE.</h2>

<p class="first">
INSPIRED by this passionate appeal, the hunter hastened
towards the stable, where he had stalled his unique specimen of
horseflesh.</p>

<p>He found the "critter" sonorously shelling some corn-cobs,
which Pluto had placed liberally before her.</p>

<p>Pluto himself was standing by her side.</p>

<p>Contrary to his usual habit, the sable groom was silent:
though with an air anything but tranquil.  He looked rather
<i>triste</i> than excited.</p>

<p>It might be easily explained.  The loss of his young
master&mdash;by Pluto much beloved&mdash;the sorrow of his young
mistress, equally estimated&mdash; perhaps some scornful speeches
which he had lately been treated to from the lips of
Morinda&mdash;and still more likely a kick he had received from
the boot-toe of Captain Cassius&mdash;for several days assuming
sole mastery over the mansion&mdash;amply accounted for the
unquiet expression observable on his countenance.</p>

<p>Zeb was too much occupied with his own thoughts to notice the
sorrowful mien of the domestic.  He was even in too great a hurry
to let the old mare finish her meal of maize, which she stood
greatly in need of.</p>

<p>Grasping her by the snout, he stuck the rusty snaffle between
her teeth; pulled her long ears through the cracked leathern
headstraps; and, turning her in the stall, was about to lead her
out.</p>

<p>It was a reluctant movement on the part of the mare&mdash;to
be dragged away from such provender as she rarely chanced to get
between her jaws.</p>

<p>She did not turn without a struggle; and Zeb was obliged to
pull vigorously on the bridle-rein before he could detach her
muzzle from the manger.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!  Mass' Tump!" interposed Pluto.  "Why you be go 'way
in dat big hurry?  De poor ole ma' she no half got u'm feed.  Why
you no let her fill her belly wif de corn?  Ha! ha!  It do her
power o' good."</p>

<p>"Han't got time, nigger.  Goin' off on a bit o' a jurney.  Got
abeout a hunderd mile to make in less 'an a kupple o' hours."</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!  Dat ere de fassest kind o' trabbelin'.  You 'm
jokin', Mass' Tump?"</p>

<p>"No, I ain't."</p>

<p>"Gorramity!  Wa&mdash;dey do make won'full journey on dese
hyur prairas.  I reck'n dat ere hoss must a trabbled <i>two</i>
hunner mile de odder night."</p>

<p>"What hoss?"</p>

<p>"De ole sorrel dere&mdash;in dat furrest 'tand from de
doos&mdash;Massa Cahoon hoss."</p>

<p>"What makes ye think he travelled two hunder mile?"</p>

<p>"Kase he turn home all kibbered ober wif de froff.  Beside, he
wa <i>so</i> done up he scace able walk, when dis chile lead um
down to de ribba fo' gib um drink.  Hee 'tagger like new-drop
calf.  Ho! ho! he wa broke down&mdash;he wa!"</p>

<p>"O' what night air ye palaverin', Plute?"</p>

<p>"Wha night?  Le'ss see!  Why, ob coas de night Massa Henry wa
missed from de plantashun.  Dat same night in de mornin', 'bout
an hour atter de sun git up into de hebbings.  I no see de ole
sorrel afore den, kase I no out ob my skeeta-bar till after
daylight.  Den I kum 'cross to de 'table hya, an den I see dat
quadrumpid all kibbered ober wif sweet an froff&mdash;lookin'
like he'd swimmed through de big ribba, an pantin' 's if he jes
finish a fo' mile race on de Metairie course at New Orlean."</p>

<p>"Who had him out thet night?"</p>

<p>"Doan know, Mass' Tump.  Only dat nobody 'lowed to ride de
sorrel 'cept Massa Cahoon hisself.  Ho! ho!  Ne'er a body 'lowed
lay leg ober dat critter."</p>

<p>"Why, wan't it himself that tuk the anymal out?"</p>

<p>"Doan know, Massa Tump; doan know de why nor de whafor.  Dis
chile neider see de Cap'n take um out nor fotch um in."</p>

<p>"If yur statement air true 'beout his bein' in sech a sweat,
someb'dy must a hed him out, an been ridin' o' him."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!  Someb'dy muss, dat am certing."</p>

<p>"Looke hyur, Plute!  Ye ain't a bad sort o' a darkie, though
your skin air o' a sut colour.  I reck'n you're tellin' the
truth; an ye don't know who rud out the sorrel that night.  But
who do ye <i>think</i> it war? I'm only axin' because, as ye
know, Mr Peintdexter air a friend o' mine, an I don't want his
property to be abused&mdash;no more what belongs to Capen
Calhoun.  Some o' the field niggers, I reck'n, hev stole the
anymal out o' the stable, an hev been ridin' it all roun' the
country. That's it, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, Mass' Tump.  Dis chile doan believe dat am it.  De
fiel' hands not 'lowed inside hyur.  <i>Dey</i> darn't kum in to
de 'table no how. 'Twan't any nigger upon dis plantashun as
tooked out de sorrel dat night."</p>

<p>"Durn it, then, who ked a tuk him out?  Maybe the overseer?
War it him d'ye think?"</p>

<p>"'Twan't him needer."</p>

<p>"Who then ked it be; unless it war the owner o' the hoss
hisself?  If so, thur's an end o' it.  He hed the right to ride
his critter wharever he pleased, an gallop it to hell ef thet war
agreeable to him.  It ain't no bizness o' myen."</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!  Nor myen, needer, Mass' Tump.  Wish I'd thought dat
way dis mornin'."</p>

<p>"Why do ye weesh that?  What happened this mornin' to change
yur tune?"</p>

<p>"Ho! what happen dis mornin'?  Dar happen to dis nigga a great
misfortin'.  Ho!&mdash;ho! berry great misfortin'."</p>

<p>"What war it?"</p>

<p>"Golly, Massa Tump, I'se got kicked&mdash;dis berry mornin',
jes 'bout an hour arter twelve o'clock in de day."</p>

<p>"Kicked?"</p>

<p>"Dat I did shoo&mdash;all round de 'table."</p>

<p>"Oh! by the hosses!  Which o' the brutes kicked ye?"</p>

<p>"Ho!&mdash;ho! you mistaken!  Not any ob de hosses, but de
massa ob dem all&mdash;'cept little Spotty da, de which he doan't
own.  I wa kicked by Mass' Cahoon."</p>

<p>"The hell ye wur!  For what reezun?  Ye must hev <i>been</i>
misbehavin' yurself, nigger?"</p>

<p>"Dis nigga wan't mis-b'avin' 't all; not as he knows on.  I
only ask de cap'n what put de ole sorrel in such a dreful
condishin dat ere night, an what make 'im be tired down.  He say
it not my bizness; an den he kick me; an den he larrup me wif de
cow-hide; an den he threaten; an den he tell me, if I ebber 'peak
bout dat same ting odder time, he gib me hunder lashes ob de
wagon whip.  He swa; oh! how he swa!  Dis chile nebba see Mass
Cahoon so mad&mdash;nebba, in all 'im life!"</p>

<p>"But whar's he now?  I don't see him nowhar' beout the
premises; an I reck'n he ain't rud out, seein' as the sorrel's
hyur?"</p>

<p>"Golly, yes, Mass Tump; he jess am rode out at dis time.  He
ob late go berry much away from de house an tay long time."</p>

<p>"A hossback?"</p>

<p>"Jess so.  He go on de steel grey.  Ha!&mdash;ha! he doan'
ride de sorrel much now.  He hain't mount 'im once since de night
de ole hoss wa out&mdash; dat night we been 'peakin' 'bout. Maybe
he tink he hab enuf hard ridin' den, an need long 'pell ob
ress."</p>

<p>"Look'ee hyur, Plute," said Zeb, after standing silent for a
second or two, apparently engaged in some abstruse calculation.
"Arter all, I reck'n I'd better let the ole maar hev another yeer
or two o' the corn. She's got a long spell o' travellin' afore
her; an she mout break down on the jurney.  The more haste air
sometimes the wusser speed; an thurfor, I kalkerlate, I'd better
gie the critter her time.  While she's munchin' a mouthful, I ked
do the same myself.  'Spose, then, you skoot acrosst to the
kitchen, an see ef thur ain't some chawin' stuff thur&mdash;a bit
o' cold meat an a pone o' corn bread 'll do.  Yur young mistress
wanted me to hev somethin' to eet; but I war skeert abeout
delayin', an refused.  Now, while I'm waitin' on the maar, I
reck'n I ked pick a bone,&mdash;jest to pass the time."</p>

<p>"Sartin' ye cud, Mass Tump.  I go fotch 'im in de hundreth
part ob an instant."</p>

<p>So saying the black-skinned Jehu started off across the
<i>patio</i>, leaving Zeb Stump sole "master of the stole."</p>

<p>The air of indifference with which he had concluded his
dialogue with Pluto disappeared, the moment the latter was
outside the door.</p>

<p>It had been altogether assumed: as was proved by the earnest
attitude that instantly replaced it.</p>

<p>Striding across the paved causeway, that separated the two
rows of stalls, he entered that occupied by the sorrel.</p>

<p>The animal shied off, and stood trembling against the
wall&mdash;perhaps awed by the look of resolution with which the
hunter had approached it.</p>

<p>"Stan' still, ye brute!" chided Zeb.  "I don't mean no harm to
<i>you</i>, tho' by yur looks I reck'n ye're as vicious as yur
master.  Stan' still, I say, an let's hev a look at yur fut-
gear!"</p>

<p>So saying, he stooped forward, and made an attempt to lay hold
of one of the fore-legs.</p>

<p>It was unsuccessful.  The horse suddenly drew up his hoof; and
commenced hammering the flags with it, snorting&mdash;as if in
fear that some trick was about to be played upon him.</p>

<p>"Durn your ugly karkidge!" cried Zeb, angrily venting the
words.  "Why don't ye stan' still?  Who's goin' to hurt ye? Come,
ole critter!" he continued coaxingly, "I only want to see how
youv'e been shod."</p>

<p>Again he attempted to lift the hoof, but was prevented by the
restive behaviour of the horse.</p>

<p>"Wal, this air a difeequilty I didn't expeck," muttered he,
glancing round to see how it might be overcome.  "What's to be
did?  It'll never do to hev the nigger help me&mdash;nor yet see
what I'm abeout&mdash;the which he will ef I don't get quick
through wi' it.  Dog-gone the hoss!  How am I to git his feet
up?"</p>

<p>For a short while he stood considering, his countenance
showing a peevish impatience.</p>

<p>"Cuss the critter!" he again exclaimed.  "I feel like knockin'
him over whar he stan's.  Ha! now I hev it, if the nigger will
only gie time.  I hope the wench will keep him waitin'.  Durn ye!
I'll make ye stan' still, or choke ye dead ef ye don't.  Wi' this
roun' yur jugewlar, I reck'n ye won't be so skittish."</p>

<p>While speaking he had lifted the trail-rope from his own
saddle; and, throwing its noose over the head of the sorrel, he
shook it down till it encircled the animal's neck.</p>

<p>Then hauling upon the other end, he drew it taut as a
bowstring.</p>

<p>The horse for a time kept starting about the stall, and
snorting with rage.</p>

<p>But his snorts were soon changed into a hissing sound, that
with difficulty escaped through his nostrils; and his wrath
resolved itself into terror.  The rope tightly compressing his
throat was the cause of the change.</p>

<p>Zeb now approached him without fear; and, after making the
slip fast, commenced lifting his feet one after the
other&mdash;scrutinising each, in great haste, but at the same
time with sufficient care.  He appeared to take note of the
shape, the shoeing, the number and relative position of the
nails&mdash;in short, everything that might suggest an
idiosyncrasy, or assist in a future identification.</p>

<p>On coming to the off hind foot&mdash;which he did last of the
four&mdash;an exclamation escaped him that proclaimed some
satisfactory surprise.  It was caused by the sight of a broken
shoe&mdash;nearly a quarter of which was missing from the hoof,
the fracture having occurred at the second nail from the
canker.</p>

<p>"Ef I'd know'd o' <i>you</i>," he muttered in apostrophe to
the imperfect shoe, "I mout a' saved myself the trouble o'
examinin' the tothers. Thur ain't much chance o' mistakin' the
print you'd be likely to leave ahint ye.  To make shur, I'll jest
take ye along wi me."</p>

<p>In conformity with this resolve, he drew out his huge hunting
knife&mdash;the blade of which, near the hilt, was a quarter of
an inch thick&mdash;and, inserting it under the piece of iron, he
wrenched it from the hoof.</p>

<p>Taking care to have the nails along, he transferred it to the
capacious pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>Then nimbly gliding back to the trail-rope, he undid the knot;
and restored the interrupted respiration of the sorrel.</p>

<p>Pluto came in the moment after, bringing a plentiful supply of
refreshments&mdash;including a tumbler of the Monongahela; and to
these Zeb instantly applied himself, without saying a word about
the interlude that had occurred during the darkey's absence.</p>

<p>The latter, however, did not fail to perceive that the sorrel
was out of sorts: for the animal, on finding itself released,
stood shivering in the stall, gazing around in a sort of woe-
begone wonder after the rough treatment, to which he had been
submitted.</p>

<p>"Gorramity!" exclaimed the black, "what am de matter wif de
ole hoss? Ho! ho! he look like he wa afeerd ob you, Mass
Tump!"</p>

<p>"Oh, ye-es!" drawled Zeb, with seeming carelessness.  "I
reck'n he air a bit afeerd.  He war makin' to get at my ole maar,
so I gied him a larrup or two wi' the eend o' my trail rope.
Thet's what has rousted him."</p>

<p>Pluto was perfectly satisfied with the explanation, and the
subject was permitted to drop.</p>

<p>"Look hyur, Plute!" said Zeb, starting another.  "Who does the
shoein' o' yur cattle?  Thars some o' the hands air a smith, I
reck'n?"</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!  Dat dere am.  Yella Jake he do shoein'.  Fo what you
ask, Mass Tump?"</p>

<p>"Wal; I war thinkin' o' havin' a kupple o' shoes put on the
hind feet o' the maar.  I reck'n Jake ud do it for me."</p>

<p>"Ho! ho! he do it wif a thousan' welkim&mdash;dat he will,
I'se shoo."</p>

<p>"Questyun is, kin I spare the time to wait.  How long do it
take him to put on a kupple?"</p>

<p>"Lor, Mass Tamp, berry short while.  Jake fust-rate han' lit
de bizness. Ebberybody say so."</p>

<p>"He moutn't have the mateerils riddy?  It depends on whether
he's been shoein' lately.  How long's it since he shod any o'
yourn?"</p>

<p>"More'n a week I blieb, Mass' Zeb.  Ho&mdash;ho!  Do last war
Missa Looey hoss&mdash;de beautiful 'potty dar.  But dat won't
make no differens.  I know he hab de fixins all ready.  I knows
it, kase he go for shoe de sorrel. De ole hoss hab one ob de hind
shoe broke.  He hab it so de lass ten day; an Mass Cahoon, he gib
orders for it be remove.  Ho&mdash;ho! dis berry mornin' I hear
um tell Jake."</p>

<p>"Arter all," rejoined Zeb, as if suddenly changing his mind,
"I moutn't hev the time to spare.  I reck'n I'll let the ole
critter do 'ithout till I kum back.  The tramp I'm goin'
on&mdash;most part o' it&mdash;lies over grass purayra; an won't
hurt her."</p>

<p>"No, I hevn't time," he added, after stepping outside and
glancing up towards the sky.  "I must be off from hyur in the
shakin' o' a goat's tail.  Now, ole gal! you've got to stop yur
munchin' an take this bit o' iron atwixt yur teeth.  Open yur
corn trap for it.  That's the putty pet!"</p>

<p>And so continuing to talk&mdash;now to Pluto, now to the
mare&mdash;he once more adjusted the headstall; led the animal
out; and, clambering into the saddle, rode thoughtfully away.</p>

<h2><a id="ch72"></a>CHAPTER SEVENTY TWO.<br>

ZEB STUMP ON THE TRAIL.</h2>

<p class="first">
AFTER getting clear of the enclosures of Casa del Corvo, the
hunter headed his animal up stream&mdash;in the direction of the
Port and town.</p>

<p>It was the former he intended to reach&mdash;which he did in a
ride of less than a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Commonly it took him three to accomplish this distance; but on
this occasion he was in an unusual state of excitement, and he
made speed to correspond.  The old mare could go fast enough when
required&mdash;that is when Zeb required her and he had a mode of
quickening her speed&mdash;known only to himself, and only
employed upon extraordinary occasions.  It simply consisted in
drawing the bowie knife from his belt, and inserting about in
inch of its blade into the mare's hip, close to the termination
of the spine.</p>

<p>The effect was like magic; or, if you prefer the
figure&mdash;electricity. So spurred, Zeb's "critter" could
accomplish a mile in three minutes; and more than once had she
been called upon to show this capability, when her owner was
chased by Comanches.</p>

<p>On the present occasion there was no necessity for such
excessive speed; and the Fort was reached after fifteen minutes'
sharp trotting.</p>

<p>On reaching it, Zeb slipped out of the saddle, and made his
way to the quarters of the commandant; while the mare was left
panting upon the parade ground.</p>

<p>The old hunter had no difficulty in obtaining an interview
with the military chief of Fort Inge.  Looked upon by the
officers as a sort of privileged character, he had the entree at
all times, and could go in without countersign, or any of the
other formalities usually demanded from a stranger.  The sentry
passed him, as a matter of course&mdash;the officer of the guard
only exchanged with him a word of welcome; and the adjutant at
once announced his name to the major commanding the
cantonment.</p>

<p>From his first words, the latter appeared to have been
expecting him.</p>

<p>"Ah!  Mr Stump!  Glad to see you so soon.  Have you made any
discovery in this queer affair?  From your quick return, I can
almost say you have.  Something, I hope, in favour of this
unfortunate young fellow. Notwithstanding that appearances are
strongly against him, I still adhere to my old opinion&mdash;that
he's innocent.  What have you learnt?"</p>

<p>"Wal, Maje," answered Zeb, without making other obeisance than
the simple politeness of removing his hat; "what I've larnt aint
much, tho' enough to fetch me back to the Fort; where I didn't
intend to come, till I'd gone a bit o' a jurney acrosst the
purayras.  I kim back hyur to hev a word wi' yurself."</p>

<p>"In welcome.  What is it you have to say?"</p>

<p>"That ye'll keep back this trial as long's ye kin raisonably
do so.  I know thur's a pressyur from the outside; but I know,
too, that ye've got the power to resist it, an what's more,
Maje&mdash;yo've got the will."</p>

<p>"I have.  You speak quite truly about that, Mr Stump.  And as
to the power, I have that, too, in a certain sense.  But, as you
are aware, in our great republic, the military power must always
be subservient to the civil&mdash;unless under martial-law, which
God forbid should ever be required among us&mdash;even here in
Texas.  I can go so far as to hinder any open violation of the
law; but I cannot go against the law itself."</p>

<p>"T'ant the law I want ye to go agin.  Nothin' o' the sort,
Maje.  Only them as air like to take it into thur own hands, an
twist it abeout to squar it wi' thur own purpisses.  Thur's them
in this Settlement as 'ud do thet, ef they ain't rustrained.  One
in espeecial 'ud like to do it; an I knows who thet one
air&mdash;leestwise I hev a tolable clur guess o' him."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Yur good to keep a seecret, Maje?  I know ye air."</p>

<p>"Mr Stump, what passes here is in confidence.  You may speak
your mind freely."</p>

<p>"Then my mind air: thet the man who hez dud this murder ain't
Maurice the Mowstanger."</p>

<p>"That's my own belief.  You know it already.  Have you nothing
more to communicate?"</p>

<p>"Wal, Maje, preehaps I ked communerkate a leetle more ef you
insist upon it.  But the time ain't ripe for tellin' ye what I've
larnt&mdash;the which, arter all, only mounts to surspishuns.  I
may be wrong; an I'd rayther you'd let me keep 'em to myself till
I hev made a short exkurshun acrost to the Nooeces.  Arter thet,
ye'll be welkum to what I know now, besides what I may be able to
gather off o' the parayras."</p>

<p>"So far as I am concerned, I'm quite contented to wait for
your return; the more willingly that I know you are acting on the
side of justice. But what would you have me do?"</p>

<p>"Keep back the trial, Maje&mdash;only that.  The rest will be
all right."</p>

<p>"How long?  You know that it must come on according to the
usual process in the Criminal Court.  The judge of this circuit
will not be ruled by me, though he may yield a little to my
advice.  But there is a party, who are crying out for vengeance;
and he may be ruled by them."</p>

<p>"I know the party ye speak o'.  I know their leader; an maybe,
afore the trial air over, <i>he</i> may be the kriminal afore the
bar."</p>

<p>"Ah! you do not believe, then, that these Mexicans are the
<i>men</i>!"</p>

<p>"Can't tell, Maje, whether they air or ain't.  I do b'lieve
thet they've hed a hand in the bizness; but I don't b'lieve thet
they've been the prime movers in't.  It's <i>him</i> I want to
diskiver.  Kin ye promise me three days?"</p>

<p>"Three days!  For what?"</p>

<p>"Afore the trial kims on."</p>

<p>"Oh!  I think there will be no difficulty about that.  He is
now a prisoner under military law.  Even if the judge of the
Supreme Court should require him to be delivered up inside that
time, I can make objections that will delay his being taken from
the guard-house.  I shall undertake to do that."</p>

<p>"Maje! ye'd make a man a'most contented to live under marshul
law.  No doubt thur air times when it air the best, tho' we
independent citizens don't much like it.  All I've got to say
air, thet ef ye stop this trial for three days, or tharahout,
preehaps the prisoner to kim afore the bar may be someb'y else
than him who's now in the guard-house&mdash;someb'y who jest at
this mom't hain't the smallest serspishun o' bein' hisself
surspected.  Don't ask me who.  Only say ye'll streetch a pint,
an gi' me three days?"</p>

<p>"I promise it, Mr Stump.  Though I may risk my commission as
an officer in the American army, I give you an officer's promise,
that for three days Maurice the Mustanger shall not go out of my
guard-house.  Innocent or guilty, for that time he shall be
protected."</p>

<p>"Yur the true grit, Maje; an dog-gone me, ef I don't do my
beest to show ye some day, thet I'm sensible o't.  I've nuthin'
more to say now, 'ceptin' to axe thet ye'll not tell out o' doors
what I've been tellin' you.  Thur's them outside who, ef they
only knew what this coon air arter, 'ud move both heving an airth
to circumwent his intenshuns."</p>

<p>"They'll have no help from me&mdash;whoever it is you are
speaking of.  Mr Stump, you may rely upon my pledged word."</p>

<p>"I know't, Maje, I know't.  God bless ye for a good 'un.
<i>Yer</i> the right sort for Texas!"</p>

<p>With this complimentary leave-taking the hunter strode out of
head-quarters, and made his way back to the place where he had
left his old mare.</p>

<p>Once more mounting her, he rode rapidly away.  Having cleared
the parade ground, and afterwards the outskirts of the village,
he returned on the same path that had conducted him from Casa Del
Corvo.</p>

<p>On reaching the outskirts of Poindexter's plantation, he left
the low lands of the Leona bottom, and spurred his old mare
'gainst the steep slope ascending to the upper plain.</p>

<p>He reached it, at a point where the chapparal impinged upon
the prairie, and there reined up under the shade of a mezquit
tree.  He did not alight, nor show any sign of an intention to do
so; but sate in the saddle, stooped forward, his eyes turned upon
the ground, in that vacant gaze which denotes reflection.</p>

<p>"Dog-gone my cats!" he drawled out in slow soliloquy.  "Thet
ere sarkimstance are full o' signiferkince.  Calhoun's hoss out
the same night, an fetched home a' sweetin' all over.  What ked
that mean?  Durn me, ef I don't surspect the foul play hev kum
from that quarter.  I've thort so all along; only it air so
ridiklous to serpose thet he shed a killed his own cousin.  He'd
do that, or any other villinous thing, ef there war a reezun for
it.  There ain't&mdash;none as I kin think o'.  Ef the property
hed been a goin' to the young un, then the thing mout a been
intellygible enuf.  But it want.  Ole Peintdexter don't own a
acre o' this hyur groun'; nor a nigger thet's upon it.  Thet I'm
sartin' 'beout. They all belong to that cuss arready; an why shed
he want to get shot o' the cousin?  Thet's whar this coon gets
flummixed in his kalkerlations.  Thar want no ill will atween
'em, as ever I heerd o'. Thur's a state o' feelin' twixt him an
the gurl, thet <i>he</i> don't like, I know.  But why shed it
temp him to the killin' o' her brother?</p>

<p>"An' then thur's the mowstanger mixed in wi' it, an that
shindy 'beout which she tolt me herself; an the sham Injuns, an
the Mexikin shemale wi' the har upon her lip; an the hossman
'ithout a head, an hell knows what beside!  Geesus Geehosofat! it
'ud puzzle the brain pan o' a Looeyville lawyer!</p>

<p>"Wal&mdash;there's no time to stan' speklatin' hyur.  Wi' this
bit o' iron to assiss me, I may chance upon somethin' thet'll gie
a clue to a part o' the bloody bizness, ef not to the hul o' it;
an fust, as to the direcshun in which I shed steer?"</p>

<p>He looked round, as if in search of some one to answer the
interrogatory.</p>

<p>"It air no use beginnin' neer the Fort or the town.  The
groun' abeout both on 'em air paddled wi' hoss tracks like a
cattle pen.  I'd best strike out into the purayra at onst, an
take a track crossways o' the Rio Grande route.  By doin' thet I
may fluke on the futmark I'm in search o'.  Yes&mdash;ye-es!
thet's the most sensiblest idee."</p>

<p>As if fully satisfied on this score, he took up his bridle-
rein, muttered some words to his mare, and commenced moving off
along the edge of the chapparal.</p>

<p>Having advanced about a mile in the direction of the Nueces
river, he abruptly changed his course; but with a coolness that
told of a predetermined purpose.</p>

<p>It was now nearly due west, and at right angles to the
different trails going towards the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>There was a simultaneous change in his bearing&mdash;in the
expression of his features&mdash;and his attitude in the saddle.
No longer looking listlessly around, he sate stooping forward,
his eye carefully scanning the sward, over a wide space on both
sides of the path he was pursuing.</p>

<p>He had ridden about a mile in the new direction, when
something seen upon the ground caused him to start, and
simultaneously pull upon the bridle-rein.</p>

<p>Nothing loth, the "critter" came to a stand; Zeb, at the same
time, flinging himself out of the saddle.</p>

<p>Leaving the old mare to ruminate upon this eccentric
proceeding, he advanced a pace or two, and dropped down upon his
knees.</p>

<p>Then drawing the piece of curved iron out of his capacious
pocket, he applied it to a hoof-print conspicuously outlined in
the turf.  It fitted.</p>

<p>"Fits!" he exclaimed, with a triumphant gesticulation, "Dog-
goned if it don't!"</p>

<p>"Tight as the skin o' a tick!" he continued, after adjusting
the broken shoe to the imperfect hoof-print, and taking it up
again.  "By the eturnal! that ere's <i>the track o' a
creetur&mdash;mayhap a murderer</i>!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch73"></a>CHAPTER SEVENTY THREE.<br>

THE PRAIRIE ISLAND.</h2>

<p class="first">
A HERD of a hundred horses&mdash;or three times the
number&mdash;pasturing upon a prairie, although a spectacle of
the grandest kind furnished by the animal kingdom, is not one
that would strike a Texan frontiersman as either strange, or
curious.  He would think it stranger to see a <i>single</i> horse
in the same situation.</p>

<p>The former would simply be followed by the reflection: "A
drove of mustangs."  The latter conducts to a different train of
thought, in which there is an ambiguity.  The solitary steed
might be one of two things: either an exiled stallion, kicked out
of his own <i>cavallada</i>, or a roadster strayed from some
encampment of travellers.</p>

<p>The practised eye of the prairie-man would soon decide
which.</p>

<p>If the horse browsed with a bit in his mouth, and a saddle on
his shoulders, there would be no ambiguity&mdash;only the
conjecture, as to how he had escaped from his rider.</p>

<p>If the rider were upon his back, and the horse still browsing,
there would be no room for conjecture&mdash;only the reflection,
that the former must be a lazy thick-headed fellow, not to alight
and let his animal graze in a more commodious fashion.</p>

<p>If, however, the rider, instead of being suspected of having a
thick head, was seen to have <i>no head at all</i>, then would
there be cue for a thousand conjectures, not one of which might
come within a thousand miles of the truth.</p>

<p>Such a horse; and just such a rider, were seen upon the
prairies of South-Western Texas in the year of our Lord 1850
something.  I am not certain as to the exact year&mdash;the unit
of it&mdash;though I can with unquestionable certainty record the
decade.</p>

<p>I can speak more precisely as to the place; though in this I
must be allowed latitude.  A circumference of twenty miles will
include the different points where the spectral apparition made
itself manifest to the eyes of men&mdash;both on prairie and in
chapparal&mdash;in a district of country traversed by several
northern tributaries of the Rio de Nueces, and some southern
branches of the Rio Leona.</p>

<p>It was seen not only by many people; but at many different
times. First, by the searchers for Henry Poindexter and his
supposed murderer; second, by the servant of Maurice the
mustanger; thirdly, by Cassius Calhoun, on his midnight
exploration of the chapparal; fourthly, by the sham Indians on
that same night: and, fifthly, by Zeb Stump on the night
following.</p>

<p>But there were others who saw it elsewhere and on different
occasions&mdash; hunters, herdsmen, and travellers&mdash;all
alike awed, alike perplexed, by the apparition.</p>

<p>It had become the talk not only of the Leona settlement, but
of others more distant.  Its fame already reached on one side to
the Rio Grande, and on the other was rapidly extending to the
Sabine.  No one doubted that such a thing had been seen.  To have
done so would have been to ignore the evidence of two hundred
pairs of eyes, all belonging to men willing to make affidavit of
the fact&mdash;for it could not be pronounced a fancy.  No one
denied that it had been seen.  The only question was, how to
account for a spectacle so peculiar, as to give the lie to all
the known laws of creation.</p>

<p>At least half a score of theories were started&mdash;more or
less feasible&mdash; more or less absurd.  Some called it an
"Indian dodge;" others believed it a "lay figure;" others that it
was not that, but a real rider, only so disguised as to have his
head under the serape that shrouded his shoulders, with perhaps a
pair of eye-holes through which he could see to guide his horse;
while not a few pertinaciously adhered to the conjecture, started
at a very early period, that the Headless Horseman was Lucifer
himself!</p>

<p>In addition to the direct attempts at interpreting the
abnormal phenomenon, there was a crowd of indirect conjectures
relating to it. Some fancied that they could see the head, or the
shape of it, down upon the breast, and under the blanket; others
affirmed to having actually seen it carried in the rider's hand;
while others went still further, and alleged: that upon the head
thus seen there was a hat&mdash;a black-glaze sombrero of the
Mexican sort, with a band of gold bullion above the brim!</p>

<p>There were still further speculations, that related less to
the apparition itself than to its connection with the other grand
topic of the time&mdash;the murder of young Poindexter.</p>

<p>Most people believed there was some connection between the two
mysteries; though no one could explain it.  He, whom everybody
believed, could have thrown some light upon the subject, was
still ridden by the night-mare of delirium.</p>

<p>And for a whole week the guessing continued; during which the
spectral rider was repeatedly seen; now going at a quick gallop,
now moving in slow, tranquil pace, across the treeless prairie:
his horse at one time halted and vaguely gazing around him; at
another with teeth to the ground, industriously cropping the
sweet <i>gramma</i> grass, that makes the pasturage of South-
Western Texas (in my opinion) the finest in the world.</p>

<p>Rejecting many tales told of the Headless Horseman&mdash;most
of them too grotesque to be recorded&mdash;one truthful episode
must needs be given&mdash; since it forms an essential chapter of
this strange history.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">IN the midst of the open prairie there is a
"motte"&mdash;a coppice, or clump of trees&mdash;of perhaps three
or four acres in superficial extent.  A prairie-man would call it
an "island," and with your eyes upon the vast verdant sea that
surrounds it, you could not help being struck with the
resemblance.</p>

<p>The aboriginal of America might not perceive it.  It is a
thought of the colonist transmitted to his descendants; who,
although they may never have looked upon the great ocean, are
nevertheless <i>au fait</i> to its phraseology.</p>

<p>By the timber island in question&mdash;about two hundred yards
from its edge&mdash;a horse is quietly pasturing.  He is the same
that carries the headless rider; and this weird equestrian is
still bestriding him, with but little appearance of change,
either in apparel or attitude, since first seen by the searchers.
The striped blanket still hangs over his shoulders, cloaking the
upper half of his person; while the <i>armas-de-agua</i>,
strapped over his limbs, cover them from thigh to spur,
concealing all but their outlines.</p>

<p>His body is bent a little forward, as if to ease the horse in
getting his snout to the sward; which the long bridle-rein,
surrendered to its full length, enables him to do, though still
retained in hand, or resting over the "horn" of the saddle.</p>

<p>Those who asserted that they saw a head, only told the truth.
There is a head; and, as also stated, with a hat upon it&mdash;a
black sombrero, with bullion band as described.</p>

<p>The head rests against the left thigh, the chin being nearly
down on a level with the rider's knee.  Being on the near side it
<i>can</i> only be seen, when the spectator is on the same; and
not always then, as it is at times concealed by a corner of the
serape.</p>

<p>At times too can a glimpse be obtained of the face.  Its
features are well formed, but wearing a sad expression; the lips
of livid colour, slightly parted, showing a double row of white
teeth, set in a grim ghastly smile.</p>

<p>Though there is no perceptible change in the <i>personnel</i>
of the Headless Horseman there is something new to be noted.
Hitherto he has been seen going alone.  Now he is in company.</p>

<p>It cannot be called agreeable;&mdash;consisting as it does of
wolves&mdash;half a score of them squatting closely upon the
plain, and at intervals loping around him.</p>

<p>By the horse they are certainly not liked; as is proved by the
snorting and stamping of his hoof, when one of them ventures upon
a too close proximity to his heels.</p>

<p>The rider seems more indifferent to a score of
birds&mdash;large dark birds&mdash; that swoop in shadowy circles
around his shoulders.  Even when one bolder than the rest has the
audacity to alight upon him, he has made no attempt to disturb
it, raising neither hand nor arm to drive it away!</p>

<p>Three times one of the birds has alighted thus&mdash;first
upon the right shoulder, then upon the left, and then midway
between&mdash;upon the spot where the head should be!</p>

<p>The bird does not stay upon its singular perch, or only for an
instant. If the rider does not feel the indignity the steed does;
and resists it by rearing upward, with a fierce neighing, that
frights the vultures off&mdash;to return again only after a short
interval of shyness.</p>

<p>His steed thus browsing, now in quiet, now disturbed by the
too near approach of the wolves&mdash;anon by the bold behaviour
of the birds&mdash;goes the Headless Horseman, step by step, and
with long pauses of pasturing, around the prairie island.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch74"></a>CHAPTER SEVENTY FOUR.<br>

A SOLITARY STALKER.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE singular spectacle described&mdash;extraordinary it might
be termed&mdash;was too grave to appear grotesque.  There was
some thing about it that savoured of the <i>outre-monde</i>.
Human eyes could not have beholden it, without the shivering of a
human frame, and the chilling of human blood.</p>

<p>Was it seen by human eyes in this fresh phase&mdash;with the
wolves below, and the vultures above?</p>

<p>It was.</p>

<p>By one pair; and they belonging to the only man in all Texas
who had arrived at something like a comprehension of the all-
perplexing mystery.</p>

<p>It was not yet altogether clear to him.  There were points
that still puzzled him.  He but know it was neither a dummy, nor
the Devil.</p>

<p>His knowledge did not except him from the universal feeling of
dread. Despite the understanding of what the thing was, he
shuddered as he gazed upon it.</p>

<p>He gazed upon it from the "shore" of the prairie-island;
himself unseen under its shadows, and apparently endeavouring to
remain so.</p>

<p>And yet, with all his trembling and the desire to keep
concealed, he was following it round and round, on the
circumference of an inner circle, as if some magnetic power was
constraining him to keep on the same radius, of which the point
occupied by the Headless Horseman was a prolongation!</p>

<p>More than this.  He had seen the latter before entering the
island.  He had seen him far off, and might easily have shunned
him.  But instead of doing so, he had immediately commenced
making approach towards him!</p>

<p>He had continued it&mdash;using the timber as a screen, and
acting as one who stalks the timid stag, with the difference of a
heart-dread which no deer-stalker could ever know.</p>

<p>He had continued it; until the shelter of the <i>motte</i>
gave him a momentary respite, not from fear, but the apprehension
of a failure.</p>

<p>He had not ridden ten miles across the prairie without a
design; and it was this that caused him to go so
cautiously&mdash;guiding his horse over the softest turf, and
through the selvedge of the chapparal&mdash;in such a way as
neither to expose his person to view, nor cause a rustle among
the branches, that might be heard to the distance of ten
yards.</p>

<p>No one observing his manoeuvres as he moved amid the timber
island, could have mistaken their meaning&mdash;at least so far
as related to the object for which they were being made.</p>

<p>His eye was upon the Headless Horseman, his whole soul
absorbed in watching the movements of the latter&mdash;by which
he appeared to regulate his own.</p>

<p>At first, fear seemed to be his prevailing thought.  After a
time, it was succeeded by an impatience that partially emboldened
him.  The latter plainly sprang from his perceiving, that the
Headless Horseman, instead of approaching the timber, still kept
at a regular distance of two hundred yards from its edge.</p>

<p>That this chafed him was evident from a string of soliloquies,
muttered half aloud.  They were not free from blasphemy; but that
was characteristic of the man who pronounced them.</p>

<p>"Damn the infernal brute!  If he'd only come twenty yards
nearer, I could fetch him.  My gun won't carry that distance. I'd
miss him for sure, and then it'll be all up.  I may never get the
chance again. Confound him!  He's all of twenty yards too far
off."  As if the last was an ambiguity rather than a conviction,
the speaker appeared to measure with his eye the space that
separated him from the headless rider&mdash;all the while holding
in hand a short Yager rifle, capped and cocked&mdash;ready for
instant discharge.</p>

<p>"No use," he continued, after a process of silent computation.
"I might hit the beast with a spent ball, but only to scare
without crippling him.  I must have patience, and wait till he
gets a little nearer.  Damn them wolves!  He might come in, if it
wasn't for them.  So long as they're about him, he'll give the
timber a wide berth.  It's the nature of these Texas
howes&mdash;devil skin them!</p>

<p>"I wonder if coaxing would do any good?" he proceeded, after a
pause. "Maybe the sound of a man's voice would bring the animal
to a stand? Doubtful.  He's not likely to 've heard much of that
lately.  I suppose it would only frighten him!  The sight of my
horse would be sure to do it, as it did before; though that was
in the moonlight.  Besides, he was chased by the howling
staghound.  No wonder his being wild, then, ridden as he is by
hell knows what; for it can't be&mdash;Bah!  After all, there
must be some trick in it; some damned infernal trick!"</p>

<p>For a while the speaker checked his horse with a tight rein.
And, leaning forward, so as to get a good view through the trees,
continued to scan the strange shape that was slowly skirting the
timber.</p>

<p>"It's <i>his</i> horse&mdash;sure as shootin'!  His saddle,
serape, and all.  How the hell could they have come into the
possession of the other?"</p>

<p>Another pause of reflection.</p>

<p>"Trick, or no trick, it's an ugly business.  Whoever's planned
it, must know all that happened that night; and by God, if that
thing lodged there, I've got to get it back.  What a fool; to
have bragged about it as I did!  Curse the crooked luck!</p>

<p>"He <i>won't</i> come nearer.  He's provokingly shy of the
timber.  Like all his breed, he knows he's safest in the open
ground.</p>

<p>"What's to be done?  See if I can call him up.  May be he may
like to hear a human voice.  If it'll only fetch him twenty yards
nearer, I'll be satisfied.  Hanged if I don't try."</p>

<p>Drawing a little closer to the edge of the thicket, the
speaker pronounced that call usually employed by Texans to summon
a straying horse.</p>

<p>"Proh&mdash;proh&mdash;proshow!  Come kindly! come, old
horse!"</p>

<p>The invitation was extended to no purpose.  The Texan steed
did not seem to understand it; at all events, as an invitation to
friendly companionship.  On the contrary, it had the effect of
frightening him; for no sooner fell the "proh" upon his ear, than
letting go the mouthful of grass already gathered, he tossed his
head aloft with a snort that proclaimed far greater fear than
that felt for either wolf or vulture!</p>

<p>A mustang, he knew that his greatest enemy was man&mdash;a man
mounted upon a horse; and by this time his scent had disclosed to
him the proximity of such a foe.</p>

<p>He stayed not to see what sort of man, or what kind of horse.
His first instinct had told him that both were enemies.</p>

<p>As his rider by this time appeared to have arrived at the same
conclusion, there was no tightening of the rein; and he was left
free to follow his own course&mdash;which carried him straight
off over the prairie.</p>

<p>A bitter curse escaped from the lips of the unsuccessful
stalker as he spurred out into the open ground.</p>

<p>Still more bitter was his oath, as he beheld the Headless
Horseman passing rapidly beyond reach&mdash;unscathed by the
bullet he had sent to earnestly after him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch75"></a>CHAPTER SEVENTY FIVE.<br>

ON THE TRAIL.</h2>

<p class="first">
ZEB STUMP stayed but a short while on the spot, where he had
discovered the hoof-print with the broken shoe.</p>

<p>Six seconds sufficed for its identification; after which he
rose to his feet, and continued along the trail of the horse that
had made it.</p>

<p>He did not re-mount, but strode forward on foot; the old mare,
obedient to a signal he had given her, keeping at a respectful
distance behind him.</p>

<p>For more than a mile he moved on in this original
fashion&mdash;now slowly, as the trail became
indistinct&mdash;quickening his pace where the print of the
imperfect shoe could be seen without difficulty.</p>

<p>Like an archaeologist engaged upon a tablet of hieroglyphic
history, long entombed beneath the ruins of a lost
metropolis&mdash;whose characters appear grotesque to all except
himself&mdash;so was it with Zeb Stump, as he strode on,
translating the "sign" of the prairie.</p>

<p>Absorbed in the act, and the conjectures that accompanied it,
he had no eyes for aught else.  He glanced neither to the green
savannah that stretched inimitably around, nor to the blue sky
that spread specklessly above him.  Alone to the turf beneath his
feet was his eye and attention directed.</p>

<p>A sound&mdash;not a sight&mdash;startled him from his all-
engrossing occupation. It was the report of a rifle; but so
distant, as to appear but the detonation of a percussion-cap that
had missed fire.</p>

<p>Instinctively he stopped; at the same time raising his eyes,
but without unbending his body.</p>

<p>With a quick glance the horizon was swept, along the half
dozen points whence the sound should have proceeded.</p>

<p>A spot of bluish smoke&mdash;still preserving its balloon
shape&mdash;was slowly rolling up against the sky.  A dark blotch
beneath indicated the outlines of an "island" of timber.</p>

<p>So distant was the "motte," the smoke, and the sound, that
only the eye of an experienced prairie-man would have seen the
first, or his ear heard the last, from the spot where Zeb Stump
was standing.</p>

<p>But Zeb saw the one, and heard the other.</p>

<p>"Durned queery!" he muttered, still stooped in the attitude of
a gardener dibbing in his young cabbage-plants.</p>

<p>"Dog-goned queery, to say the leest on't.  Who in ole Nick's
name kin be huntin' out thur&mdash;whar theer ain't game enuf to
pay for the powder an shet?  I've been to thet ere purayra
island; an I know there ain't nothin' thur 'ceptin' coyoats. What
<i>they</i> get to live on, only the Eturnal kin tell!"</p>

<p>"Wagh!" he went on, after a short silence.  "Some storekeeper
from the town, out on a exkurshun, as he'd call it, who's proud
o' poppin' away at them stinkin' varmints, an 'll go hum wi' a
story he's been a huntin' <i>wolves</i>!  Wal.  'Tain't no
bizness o' myen.  Let yurd-stick hev his belly-ful o' sport.
Heigh! thur's somethin' comin' this way.  A hoss an somebody on
his back&mdash;streakin' it as if hell war arter him, wi' a
pitchfork o' red-het lightnin'!  What!  As I live, it air the
Headless! It is, by the jumpin' Geehosophat!"</p>

<p>The observation of the old hunter was quite correct.  There
could be no mistake about the character of the cavalier, who,
just clearing himself from the cloud of sulphureous
smoke&mdash;now falling, dispersed over the prairie&mdash;came
galloping on towards the spot where Zeb stood.  It was the
horseman without a head.</p>

<p>Nor could there be any doubt as to the direction he was
taking&mdash;as straight towards Zeb as if he already saw, and
was determined on coming up with him!</p>

<p>A braver man than the backwoodsman could not have been found
within the confines of Texas.  Cougar, or jaguar&mdash;bear,
buffalo, or Red Indian&mdash;he could have encountered without
quailing.  Even a troop of Comanches might have come charging on,
without causing him half the apprehension felt at sight of that
solitary equestrian.</p>

<p>With all his experience of Nature in her most secret
haunts&mdash;despite the stoicism derived from that
experience&mdash;Zeb Stump was not altogether free from
superstitious fancies.  Who is?</p>

<p>With the courage to scorn a human foe&mdash;any enemy that
might show itself in a natural shape, either of biped or
quadruped&mdash;still was he not stern enough to defy the
<i>abnormal</i>; and Bayard himself would have quailed at sight
of the cavalier who was advancing to the
encounter&mdash;apparently determined upon its being deadly!</p>

<p>Zeb Stump not only quailed; but, trembling in his tall boots
of alligator leather, sought concealment.</p>

<p>He did so, long before the Headless Horseman had got within
hailing distance; or, as he supposed, within <i>sight</i> of
him.</p>

<p>Some bushes growing close by gave him the chance of a hiding
place; of which, with instinctive quickness, he availed
himself.</p>

<p>The mare, standing saddled by his side, might still have
betrayed him?</p>

<p>But, no.  He had not gone to his knees, without thinking of
that.</p>

<p>"Hunker down!" he cried, addressing himself to his dumb
companion, who, if wanting speech, proved herself perfect in
understanding.  "Squat, ye ole critter; or by the Eturnal ye'll
be switched off into hell!"</p>

<p>As if dreading some such terrible catastrophe, the scraggy
quadruped dropped down upon her fore knees; and then, lowering
her hind quarters, laid herself along the grass, as though
thinking her day's work done&mdash; she was free to indulge in a
fiesta.</p>

<p>Scarce had Zeb and his roadster composed themselves their new
position, when the Headless Horseman came charging up.</p>

<p>He was going at full speed; and Zeb was but too well pleased
to perceive that he was likely to continue it.</p>

<p>It was sheer chance that had conducted him that way; and not
from having seen either the hunter or his sorry steed.</p>

<p>The former&mdash;if not the latter&mdash;was satisfied at
being treated in that cavalier style; but, long before the
Headless Horseman had passed out of sight, Zeb had taken his
dimensions, and made himself acquainted with his character.</p>

<p>Though he might be a mystery to all the world beside, he was
no longer so to Zebulon Stump.</p>

<p>As the horse shot past in fleet career, the skirt of the
serape, flouted up by the wind, displayed to Stump's optics a
form well known to him&mdash;in a dress he had seen before.  It
was a blouse of blue cottonade, box-plaited over the breast; and
though its vivid colour was dashed with spots of garish red, the
hunter was able to recognise it.</p>

<p>He was not so sure about the face seen low down upon the
saddle, and resting against the rider's leg.</p>

<p>There was nothing strange in his inability to recognise
it.</p>

<p>The mother, who had oft looked fondly on that once fair
countenance, would not have recognised it now.</p>

<p>Zeb Stump only did so by deduction.  The horse, the saddle,
the holsters, the striped blanket, the sky-blue coat and
trousers&mdash;even the hat upon the head&mdash;were all known to
him.  So, too, was the figure that stood almost upright in the
stirrups.  The head and face must belong to the
same&mdash;notwithstanding their unaccountable displacement.</p>

<p>Zeb saw it by no uncertain glance.  He was permitted a full,
fair view of the ghastly spectacle.</p>

<p>The steed, though going at a gallop, passed within ten paces
of him.</p>

<p>He made no attempt to interrupt the retreating
rider&mdash;either by word or gesture.  Only, as the form became
unmasked before his eyes, and its real meaning flashed across his
mind, he muttered, in a slow, sad tone:</p>

<p>"Gee-hos-o-phat!  It air true, then!  <i>Poor young
fellur&mdash;dead&mdash;dead</i>!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch76"></a>CHAPTER SEVENTY SIX.<br>

LOST IN THE CHALK.</h2>

<p class="first">
STILL continuing his fleet career, the Headless Horseman
galloped on over the prairie&mdash;Zeb Stump following only with
his eyes; and not until he had passed out of sight, behind some
straggling groves of mezquite, did the backwoodsman abandon his
kneeling position.</p>

<p>Then only for a second or two did he stand erect&mdash;taking
council with himself as to what course he should pursue.</p>

<p>The episode&mdash;strange as unexpected&mdash;had caused some
disarrangement in his ideas, and seemed to call for a change in
his plans.  Should he continue along the trail he was already
deciphering; or forsake it for that of the steed that had just
swept by?</p>

<p>By keeping to the former, he might find out much; but by
changing to the latter he might learn more?</p>

<p>He might capture the Headless Horseman, and ascertain from
<i>him</i> the why and wherefore of his wild wanderings?</p>

<p>While thus absorbed, in considering what course he had best
take, he had forgotten the puff of smoke, and the report heard
far off over the prairie.</p>

<p>Only for a moment, however.  They were things to be
remembered; and he soon remembered them.</p>

<p>Turning his eyes to the quarter where the smoke had appeared,
he saw that which caused him to squat down again; and place
himself, with more <i>impressement</i> than ever, under cover of
the mezquites.  The old mare, relishing the recumbent attitude,
had still kept to it; and there was no necessity for re-disposing
of her.</p>

<p>What Zeb now saw was a man on horseback&mdash;a real horseman,
with a head upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>He was still a long way off; and it was not likely he had seen
the tall form of the hunter, standing shored up among the
bushes&mdash;much less the mare, lying beneath them.  He showed
no signs of having done so.</p>

<p>On the contrary, he was sitting stooped in the saddle, his
breast bent down to the pommel, and his eyes actively engaged in
reading the ground, over which he was guiding his horse.</p>

<p>There could be no difficulty in ascertaining his occupation.
Zeb Stump guessed it at a glance.  He was tracking the headless
rider.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" muttered Zeb, on making this discovery; "I ain't the
only one who's got a reezun for solvin' this hyur myst'ry!  Who
the hell kin <i>he</i> be?  I shed jest like to know that."</p>

<p>Zeb had not long to wait for the gratification of his wish. As
the trail was fresh, the strange horseman could take it up at a
trot&mdash;in which pace he was approaching.</p>

<p>He was soon within identifying distance.</p>

<p>"Gee&mdash;hosophat!" muttered the backwoodsman; "I mout a
know'd it wud be him; an ef I'm not mistook about it, hyurs goin'
to be a other chapter out o' the same book&mdash;a other link as
'll help me to kumplete the chain o' evydince I'm in sarch for.
Lay clost, ye critter!  Ef ye make ere a stir&mdash;even to the
shakin' o' them long lugs o' yourn&mdash;I'll cut yur darned
throat."</p>

<p>The last speech was an apostrophe to the "maar"&mdash;after
which Zeb waxed silent, with his head among the spray of the
acacias, and his eyes peering through the branches in acute
scrutiny of him who was coming along.</p>

<p>This was a man, who, once seen, was not likely to be soon
forgotten. Scarce thirty years old, he showed a countenance,
scathed, less with care than the play of evil passions.</p>

<p>But there was care upon it now&mdash;a care that seemed to
speak of apprehension&mdash;keen, prolonged, yet looking forward
with a hope of being relieved from it.</p>

<p>Withal it was a handsome face: such as a gentleman need not
have been ashamed of, but for that sinister expression that told
of its belonging to a blackguard.</p>

<p>The dress&mdash;but why need we describe it?  The blue cloth
frock of semi-military cut&mdash;the forage cap&mdash;the belt
sustaining a bowie-knife, with a brace of revolving
pistols&mdash;all have been mentioned before as enveloping and
equipping the person of Captain Cassius Calhoun.</p>

<p>It was he.</p>

<p>It was not the <i>batterie</i> of small arms that kept Zeb
Stump from showing himself.  He had no dread of an encounter with
the ex-officer of Volunteers.  Though he instinctively felt
hostility, he had as yet given no reason to the latter for
regarding him as an enemy.  He remained in shadow, to have a
better view of what was passing under the sunlight.</p>

<p>Still closely scrutinising the trail of the Headless Horseman,
Calhoun trotted past.</p>

<p>Still closely keeping among the acacias, Zeb Stump looked
after, till the same grove, that had concealed the former,
interposed its verdant veil between him and the ex-captain of
cavalry.</p>

<p>The backwoodsman's brain having become the recipient of new
thoughts, required a fresh exercise of its ingenuity.</p>

<p>If there was reason before for taking the trail of the
Headless Horseman, it was redoubled now.</p>

<p>With but short time spent in consideration, so Zeb concluded;
and commenced making preparations for a stalk after Cassius
Calhoun.</p>

<p>These consisted in taking hold of the bridle, and giving the
old mare a kick; that caused her to start instantaneously to her
feet.</p>

<p>Zeb stood by her side, intending to climb into the saddle and
ride out into the open plain&mdash;as soon as Calhoun should be
out of sight.</p>

<p>He had no thoughts of keeping the latter in view.  He needed
no such guidance.  The two fresh trails would be sufficient for
him; and he felt as sure of finding the direction in which both
would lead, as if he had ridden alongside the horseman without a
head, or him without a heart.</p>

<p>With this confidence he cleared out from among the acacias,
and took the path just trodden by Calhoun.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">FOR once in his life, Zeb Stump had made a
mistake.  On rounding the mezquite grove, behind which both had
made disappearance, he discovered he had done so.</p>

<p>Beyond, extended a tract of chalk prairie; over which one of
the horsemen appeared to have passed&mdash;him without the
head.</p>

<p>Zeb guessed so, by seeing the other, at some distance before
him, riding to and fro, in transverse stretches, like a pointer
quartering the stubble in search of a partridge.</p>

<p>He too had lost the trail, and was endeavouring to recover
it.</p>

<p>Crouching under cover of the mezquites, the hunter remained a
silent spectator of his movements.</p>

<p>The attempt terminated in a failure.  The chalk surface defied
interpretation&mdash;at least by skill such as that of Cassius
Calhoun.</p>

<p>After repeated quarterings he appeared to surrender his
design; and, angrily plying the spur, galloped off in the
direction of the Leona.</p>

<p>As soon as he was out of sight, Zeb also made an effort to
take up the lost trail.  But despite his superior attainments in
the tracking craft, he was compelled to relinquish it.</p>

<p>A fervid sun was glaring down upon the chalk; and only the eye
of a salamander could have withstood the reflection of its
rays.</p>

<p>Dazed almost to blindness, the backwoodsman determined upon
turning late back; and once more devoting his attention to the
trail from which he had been for a time seduced.</p>

<p>He had learnt enough to know that this last promised a rich
reward for its exploration.</p>

<p>It took him but a short time to regain it.</p>

<p>Nor did he lose any in following it up.  He was too keenly
impressed with its value; and with this idea urging him, he
strode rapidly on, the mare following as before.</p>

<p>Once only did he make pause; at a point where the tracks of
two horses converged with that he was following.</p>

<p>From this point the three coincided&mdash;at times parting and
running parallel, for a score of yards or so, but again coming
together and overlapping one another.</p>

<p>The horses were all shod&mdash;like that which carried the
broken shoe&mdash;and the hunter only stopped to see what he
could make out of the hoof marks. One was a "States horse;" the
other a mustang&mdash;though a stallion of great size, and with a
hoof almost as large as that of the American.</p>

<p>Zeb had his conjectures about both.</p>

<p>He did not stay to inquire which had gone first over the
ground.  That was as clear to him, as if he had been a spectator
at their passing. The stallion had been in the lead,&mdash;how
far Zeb could not exactly tell; but certainly some distance
beyond that of companionship.  The States horse had followed; and
behind him, the roadster with the broken shoe&mdash; also an
American.</p>

<p>All three had gone over the same ground, at separate times,
and each by himself.  This Zeb Stump could tell with as much ease
and certainty, as one might read the index of a dial, or
thermometer.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been in his thoughts, he said nothing,
beyond giving utterance to the simple exclamation "Good!" and,
with satisfaction stamped upon his features, he moved on, the old
mare appearing to mock him by an imitative stride!</p>

<p>"Hyur they've seppurated," he said, once again coming to a
stop, and regarding the ground at his feet.  "The stellyun an
States hoss hev goed thegither&mdash;thet air they've tuk the
same way.  Broken-shoe hev strayed in a diffrent direkshun."</p>

<p>"Wonder now what thet's for?" he continued, after standing
awhile to consider.  "Durn me ef I iver seed sech perplexin'
sign!  It ud puzzle ole Dan'l Boone hisself."</p>

<p>"Which on 'em shed I foller fust?  Ef I go arter the two I
know whar they'll lead.  They're boun' to kim up in thet puddle
o' blood.  Let's track up tother, and see whether he hev rud into
the same procksimmuty! To the right abeout, ole gal, and keep
clost ahint me&mdash;else ye may get lost in the chapparal, an
the coyoats may make thur supper on yur tallow.  Ho! ho! ho!"</p>

<p>With this apostrophe to his "critter," ending in a laugh at
the conceit of her "tallow," the hunter turned off on the track
of the third horse.</p>

<p>It led him along the edge of an extended tract of chapparal;
which, following all three, he had approached at a point well
known to him, as to the reader,&mdash;where it was parted by the
open space already described.</p>

<p>The new trail skirted the timber only for a short distance.
Two hundred yards from the embouchure of the avenue, it ran into
it; and fifty paces further on Zeb came to a spot where the horse
had stood tied to a tree.</p>

<p>Zeb saw that the animal had proceeded no further: for there
was another set of tracks showing where it had returned to the
prairie&mdash;though not by the same path.</p>

<p>The rider had gone beyond.  The foot-marks of a man could be
seen beyond&mdash;in the mud of a half-dry
<i>arroyo</i>&mdash;beside which the horse had been
"hitched."</p>

<p>Leaving his critter to occupy the "stall" where broken-shoe
had for some time fretted himself, the old hunter glided off upon
the footmarks of the dismounted rider.</p>

<p>He soon discovered two sets of them&mdash;one
going&mdash;another coming back.</p>

<p>He followed the former.</p>

<p>He was not surprised at their bringing him out into the
avenue&mdash;close to the pool of blood&mdash;by the coyotes long
since licked dry.</p>

<p>He might have traced them right up to it, but for the hundreds
of horse tracks that had trodden the ground like a sheep-pen.</p>

<p>But before going so far, he was stayed by the discovery of
some fresh "sign"&mdash;too interesting to be carelessly
examined.  In a place where the underwood grew thick, he came
upon a spot where a man had remained for some time.  There was no
turf, and the loose mould was baked hard and smooth, evidently by
the sole of a boot or shoe.</p>

<p>There were prints of the same sole leading out towards the
place of blood, and similar ones coming back again.  But upon the
branches of a tree between, Zeb Stump saw something that had
escaped the eyes not only of the searchers, but of their guide
Spangler&mdash;a scrap of paper, blackened and half-
burnt&mdash;evidently the wadding of a discharged gun!</p>

<p>It was clinging to the twig of a locust-tree, impaled upon one
of its spines!</p>

<p>The old hunter took it from the thorn to which, through rain
and wind, it had adhered; spread it carefully across the palm of
his horny hand; and read upon its smouched surface a name well
known to him; which, with its concomitant title, bore the

IT was less surprise, than gratification, that showed itself
on the countenance of Zeb Stump, as he deciphered the writing on
the paper.</p>

<p>"That ere's the backin' o' a letter," muttered he.  "Tells a
goodish grist o' story; more'n war wrote inside, I reck'n.  Been
used for the wad' o' a gun!  Wal; sarves the cuss right, for
rammin' down a rifle ball wi' a patchin' o' scurvy paper, i'stead
o' the proper an bessest thing, which air a bit o' greased
buckskin."</p>

<p>"The writin' air in a sheemale hand," he continued, looking
anew at the piece of paper.  "Don't signerfy for thet.  It's been
sent to <i>him</i> all the same; an he's hed it in purzeshun.  It
air somethin' to be tuk care o'."</p>

<p>So saying, he drew out a small skin wallet, which contained
his tinder of "punk," along with his flint and steel; and, after
carefully stowing away the scrap of paper, he returned the sack
to his pocket.</p>

<p>"Wal!" he went on in soliloquy, as he stood silently
considering, "I kalkerlate as how this ole coon 'll be able to
unwind a good grist o' this clue o' mystery, tho' thur be a bit
o' the thread broken hyur an thur, an a bit o' a puzzle I can't
clurly understan'.  The man who hev been murdered, whosomdiver
<i>he</i> may be, war out thur by thet puddle o' blood, an the
man as did the deed, whosomdiver <i>he</i> be, war a stannin'
behint this locust-tree.  But for them greenhorns, I mout a got
more out o' the sign.  Now thur ain't the ghost o' a chance.
They've tramped the hul place into a durnationed mess, cuvortin'
and caperin' abeout.</p>

<p>"Wal, 'tair no use goin' furrer thet way.  The bessest thing
now air to take the back track, if it air possable, an diskiver
whar the hoss wi' the broke shoe toted his rider arter he went
back from this leetle bit o' still-huntin'.  Thurfor, ole Zeb'lon
Stump, back ye go on the boot tracks!"</p>

<p>With this grotesque apostrophe to himself, he commenced
retracing the footmarks that had guided him to the edge of the
opening.  Only in one or two places were the footprints at all
distinct.  But Zeb scarce cared for their guidance.</p>

<p>Having already noted that the man who made them had returned
to the place where the horse had been left, he knew the back
track would lead him there.</p>

<p>There was one place, however, where the two trails did not go
over the same ground.  There was a forking in the open list,
through which the supposed murderer had made his way.  It was
caused by an obstruction,&mdash;a patch of impenetrable thicket.
They met again, but not till that on which the hunter was
returning straggled off into an open glade of considerable
size.</p>

<p>Having become satisfied of this, Zeb looked around into the
glade&mdash;for a time forsaking the footsteps of the
pedestrian.</p>

<p>After a short examination, he observed a trail altogether
distinct, and of a different character.  It was a well-marked
path entering the opening on one side, and going out on the
other: in short, a cattle-track.</p>

<p>Zeb saw that several shod horses had passed along it, some
days before: and it was this that caused him to come back and
examine it.</p>

<p>He could tell to a day&mdash;to an hour&mdash;<i>when</i> the
horses had passed; and from the sign itself.  But the exercise of
his ingenuity was not needed on this occasion.  He knew that the
hoof-prints were those of the horses ridden by Spangler and his
party&mdash;after being detached from the main body of searchers
who had gone home with the major.</p>

<p>He had heard the whole story of that collateral
investigation&mdash;how Spangler and his comrades had traced
Henry Poindexter's horse to the place where the negro had caught
it&mdash;on the outskirts of the plantation.</p>

<p>To an ordinary intellect this might have appeared
satisfactory.  Nothing more could be learnt by any one going over
the ground again.</p>

<p>Zeb Stump did not seem to think so.  As he stood looking along
it, his attitude showed indecision.</p>

<p>"If I ked make shur o' havin' time," he muttered, "I'd foller
it fust. Jest as like as not I'll find a <i>fluke</i> thur too.
But thur's no sartinty 'beout the time, an I'd better purceed to
settle wi' the anymal as cast the quarter shoe."</p>

<p>He had turned to go out of the glade, when a thought once more
stayed him.</p>

<p>"Arter all, it kin be eezy foun' at any time.  I kin guess
whar it'll lead, as sartint, as if I'd rud 'longside the skunk
thet made it&mdash; straight custrut to the stable o' Caser
Corver.</p>

<p>"It's a durned pity to drop this un,&mdash;now whiles I'm hyur
upon the spot. It'll gie me the makin' o' another ten-mile
jurney, an thur moutn't be time.  Dog-goned ef I don't try a
leetle way along it.  The ole maar kin wait till I kum back."</p>

<p>Bracing himself for a new investigation, he started off upon
the cattle-track, trodden by the horses of Spangler and his
party.</p>

<p>To the hoof-marks of these he paid but slight attention; at
times, none whatever.  His eye only sought those of Henry
Poindexter's horse. Though the others were of an after time, and
often destroyed the traces he was most anxious to examine, he had
no difficulty in identifying the latter.  As he would have
himself said, any greenhorn could do that. The young planter's
horse had gone over the ground at a gallop.  The trackers had
ridden slowly.</p>

<p>As far as Zeb Stump could perceive, the latter had made
neither halt nor deviation.  The former had.</p>

<p>It was about three-quarters of a mile from the edge of the
venue.</p>

<p>It was not a halt the galloping horse had made, but only a
slight departure from his direct course; as if something he had
seen&mdash;wolf, jaguar, cougar, or other beast of prey&mdash;had
caused him to shy.</p>

<p>Beyond he had continued his career; rapid and reckless as
ever.</p>

<p>Beyond the party along with Spangler had
proceeded&mdash;without staying to inquire why the horse had
shied from his track.</p>

<p>Zeb Stump was more inquisitive, and paused upon this spot.</p>

<p>It was a sterile tract, without herbage, and covered with
shingle and sand.  A huge tree overshadowed it, with limbs
extending horizontally. One of these ran transversely to the path
over which the horses had passed&mdash;so low that a horseman, to
shun contact with it, would have to lower his head.  At this
branch Zeb Stump stood gazing.  He observed an abrasion upon the
bark; that, though very slight, must have been caused by contact
with some substance, as hard, if not sounder, than itself.</p>

<p>"Thet's been done by the skull o' a human critter," reasoned
he&mdash;"a human critter, that must a been on the back o' a
hoss&mdash;this side the branch, an off on the t'other.  No
livin' man ked a stud sech a cullizyun as thet, an kep his seat
i' the seddle.</p>

<p>"Hooraw!" he triumphantly exclaimed, after a cursory
examination of the ground underneath the tree.  "I thort so.
Thur's the impreshun o' the throwed rider.  An' thur's whar he
hez creeped away.  Now I've got a explication o' thet big bump as
hez been puzzlin' me.  I know'd it wan't did by the claws o' any
varmint; an it didn't look like the blow eyther o' a stone or a
stick.  Thet ere's the stick that hez gi'n it."</p>

<p>With an elastic step&mdash;his countenance radiant of
triumph&mdash;the old hunter strode away from the tree, no longer
upon the cattle path, but that taken by the man who had been so
violently dismounted.</p>

<p>To one unaccustomed to the chapparal, he might have appeared
going without a guide, and upon a path never before pressed by
human foot.</p>

<p>A portion of it perhaps had not.  But Zeb was conducted by
signs which, although obscure to the ordinary eye, were to him
intelligible as the painted lettering upon a finger-post.  The
branch contorted to afford passage for a human form&mdash;the
displaced tendrils of a creeping plant&mdash; the scratched
surface of the earth&mdash;all told that a man had passed that
way.  The sign signified more&mdash;that the man was
disabled&mdash;had been crawling&mdash;a cripple!</p>

<p>Zeb Stump continued on, till he had traced this cripple to the
banks of a running stream.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for him to go further.  He had made one
more splice of the broken thread.  Another, and his clue would be
complete!</p>

<h2><a id="ch78"></a>CHAPTER SEVENTY EIGHT.<br>

A HORSE-SWOP.</h2>

<p class="first">
WITH an oath, a sullen look, and a brow black as
disappointment could make it, Calhoun turned away from the edge
of the chalk prairie, where he had lost the traces of the
Headless Horseman.</p>

<p>"No use following further!  No knowing where he's gone now! No
hope of finding him except by a <i>fluke</i>!  If I go back to
the creek I might see him again; but unless I get within range,
it'll end as it's done before. The mustang stallion won't let me
come near him&mdash;as if the brute knows what I'm wanting!</p>

<p>"He's even cunninger than the wild sort&mdash;trained to it, I
suppose, by the mustanger himself.  One fair shot&mdash;if I
could only get that, I'd settle his courses.</p>

<p>"There appears no chance of stealing upon him; and as to
riding him down, it can't be done with a slow mule like this.</p>

<p>"The sorrel's not much better as to speed, though he beats
this brute in bottom.  I'll try him to-morrow, with the new
shoe.</p>

<p>"If I could only get hold of something that's fast enough to
overtake the mustang!  I'd put down handsomely for a horse that
could do it.</p>

<p>"There must be one of the sort in the settlement.  I'll see
when I get back.  If there be, a couple of hundred, ay or three,
won't hinder me from having him."</p>

<p>After he had made these mutterings Calhoun rode away from the
chalk prairie, his dark countenance strangely contrasting with
its snowy sheen.  He went at a rapid rate; not sparing his horse,
already jaded with a protracted journey&mdash;as could be told by
his sweating coat, and the clots of half-coagulated blood, where
the spur had been freely plied upon his flanks.  Fresh drops soon
appeared as he cantered somewhat heavily on&mdash;his head set
for the hacienda of Casa del Corvo.</p>

<p>In less than an hour after, his rider was guiding him among
the mezquites that skirted the plantation.</p>

<p>It was a path known to Calhoun.  He had ridden over it before,
though not upon the same horse.  On crossing the bed of an
arroyo&mdash;dry from a long continuance of drought&mdash;he was
startled at beholding in the mud the tracks of another horse. One
of them showed a broken shoe, an old hoof-print, nearly eight
days old.  He made no examination to ascertain the time.  He knew
it to an hour.</p>

<p>He bent over it, with a different thought&mdash;a feeling of
surprise commingled with a touch of superstition.  The track
looked recent, as if made on the day before.  There had been
wind, rain, thunder, and lightning.  Not one of these had wasted
it.  Even the angry elements appeared to have passed over without
destroying it&mdash;as if to spare it for a testimony against the
outraged laws of Nature&mdash;their God.</p>

<p>Calhoun dismounted, with the design to obliterate the track of
the three-quarter shoe.  Better for him to have spared himself
the pains. The crease of his boot-heel crushing in the stiff mud
was only an additional evidence as to who had ridden the broken-
shoed horse.  There was one coming close behind capable of
collecting it.</p>

<p>Once more in his saddle, the ex-officer rode
on&mdash;reflecting on his own astuteness.</p>

<p>His reflections had scarce reached the point of reverie, when
the hoof-stroke of a horse&mdash;not his own&mdash;came suddenly
within hearing.  Not within sight: for the animal making them was
still screened by the chapparal.</p>

<p>Plainly was it approaching; and, although at a slow pace, the
measured tread told of its being guided, and not straying.  It
was a horse with a rider upon his back.</p>

<p>In another instant both were in view; and Calhoun saw before
him Isidora Covarubio de los Llanos; she at the same instant
catching sight of him!</p>

<p>It was a strange circumstance that these two should thus
encounter one another&mdash;apparently by chance, though perhaps
controlled by destiny. Stranger still the thought summoned up in
the bosoms of both.</p>

<p>In Calhoun, Isidora saw the man who loved the woman she
herself hated. In Isidora, Calhoun saw the woman who loved him he
both hated and had determined to destroy.</p>

<p>This mutual knowledge they had derived partly from report,
partly from observation, and partly from the suspicious
circumstances under which more than once they had met.  They were
equally convinced of its truth. Each felt certain of the sinister
entanglement of the other; while both believed their own to be
unsuspected.</p>

<p>The situation was not calculated to create a friendly feeling
between them.  It is not natural that man, or woman, should like
the admirer of a rival.  They can only be friends at that point
where jealousy prompts to the deadliest vengeance; and then it is
but a sinister sympathy.</p>

<p>As yet no such had arisen between Cassius Calhoun and Isidora
Covarubio de los Llanos.</p>

<p>If it had been possible, both might have been willing to avoid
the encounter.  Isidora certainly was.</p>

<p>She had no predilection for the ex-officer of dragoons; and
besides the knowledge that he was the lover of her rival, there
was another thought that now rendered his presence, if not
disagreeable, at least not desirable.</p>

<p>She remembered the chase of the sham Indians, and its ending.
She knew that among the Texans there had been much conjecture as
to her abrupt disappearance, after appealing to them for
protection.</p>

<p>She had her own motive for that, which she did not intend to
declare; and the man about meeting her might be inclined to ask
questions on the subject.</p>

<p>She would have passed with a simple salutation&mdash;she could
not give less than that.  And perhaps he might have done the
same; but for a thought which at that moment came into his mind,
entirely unconnected with the reflections already there
engendered.</p>

<p>It was not the lady herself who suggested the thought. Despite
her splendid beauty, he had no admiration for her.  In his
breast, ruthless as it might have been, there was no space left
for a second passion&mdash;not even a sensual one&mdash;for her
thus encountered in the solitude of the chapparal, with Nature
whispering wild, wicked suggestions.</p>

<p>It was no idea of this that caused him to rein up in the
middle of the path; remove the cap from his crown; and, by a
courtly salutation, invite a dialogue with Isidora.</p>

<p>So challenged, she could not avoid the conversation; that
commenced upon the instant&mdash;Calhoun taking the
initiative.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, señorita," said he, his glance directed more upon
her steed than herself; "I know it's very rude thus to interrupt
your ride; especially on the part of a stranger, as with sorrow I
am compelled to call myself."</p>

<p>"It needs no apology, señor.  If I'm not mistaken, we have met
before&mdash; upon the prairie, out near the Nueces."</p>

<p>"True&mdash;true!" stammered Calhoun, not caring to dwell upon
the remembrance.  "It was not of that encounter I wished to
speak; but what I saw afterwards, as you came galloping along the
cliff.  We all wondered what became of you."</p>

<p>"There was not much cause for wonder, cavallero.  The shot
which some of your people fired from below, disembarrassed me of
my pursuers.  I saw that they had turned back, and simply
continued my journey."</p>

<p>Calhoun exhibited no chagrin at being thus baffled.  The theme
upon which he designed to direct his discourse had not yet turned
up; and in it he might be more successful.</p>

<p>What it was might have been divined from his glance&mdash;half
<i>connoisseur</i>, half horse-jockey&mdash;still directed toward
the steed of Isidora.</p>

<p>"I do not say, señorita, that I was one of those who wondered
at your sudden disappearance.  I presumed you had your own
reasons for not coming on to us; and, seeing you ride as you did,
I felt no fear for your safety.  It was your riding that
astonished me, as it did all of my companions.  Such a horse you
had!  He appeared to glide, rather than gallop!  If I mistake
not, it's the same you are now <i>astride of</i>.  Am I right,
señora?  Pardon me for asking such an insignificant
question."</p>

<p>"The same?  Let me see?  I make use of so many.  I think I was
riding this horse upon that day.  Yes, yes; I am sure of it.  I
remember how the brute betrayed me."</p>

<p>"Betrayed you!  How?"</p>

<p>"Twice he did it.  Once as you and your people were
approaching.  The second time, when the Indians&mdash;<i>ay
Dios</i>! not Indians, as I've since heard&mdash;were coming
through the chapparal."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"By neighing.  He should not have done it.  He's had training
enough to know better than that.  No matter.  Once I get him back
to the Rio Grande he shall stay there.  I shan't ride <i>him</i>
again.  He shall return to his Pastures."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, señorita, for speaking to you on such a subject;
but I can't help thinking that it's a pity."</p>

<p>"What's a pity?"</p>

<p>"That a steed so splendid as that should be so lightly
discarded.  I would give much to possess him."</p>

<p>"You are jesting, cavallero.  He is nothing beyond the common;
perhaps a little pretty, and quick in his paces.  My father has
five thousand of his sort&mdash;many of them prettier, and, no
doubt, some faster than he. He's a good roadster; and that's why
I'm riding him now.  If it weren't that I'm on my way home to the
Rio Grande, and the journey is still before me, you'd be welcome
to have him, or anybody else who cared for him, as you seem to
do.  Be still, <i>musteno mio</i>!  You see there's somebody
likes you better than I do."</p>

<p>The last speech was addressed to the mustang, who, like its
rider, appeared impatient for the conversation to come to a
close.</p>

<p>Calhoun, however, seemed equally desirous of prolonging, or,
at all events, bringing it to a different termination.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, señorita," said he, assuming an air of
businesslike earnestness, at the same time speaking
apologetically; "if that be all the value you set upon the grey
mustang, I should be only too glad to make an exchange with you.
My horse, if not handsome, is estimated by our Texan dealers as a
valuable animal.  Though somewhat slow in his paces, I can
promise that he will carry you safely to your home, and will
serve you well afterwards."</p>

<p>"What, señor!" exclaimed the lady, in evident astonishment,
"exchange your grand American <i>frison</i> for a Mexican
mustang!  The offer is too generous to appear other than a jest.
You know that on the Rio Grande one of your horses equals in
value at least three, sometimes six, of ours?"</p>

<p>Calhoun knew this well enough; but he knew also that the
mustang ridden by Isidora would be to him worth a whole stableful
of such brutes as that he was bestriding.  He had been an eye-
witness to its speed, besides having heard of it from others.  It
was the thing he stood in need of&mdash;the very thing.  He would
have given, not only his "grand <i>frison</i>" in exchange, but
the full price of the mustang by way of "boot."</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, there was no attempt at extortion.  In
the composition of the Mexican maiden, however much she might be
given to equestrian tastes, there was not much of the "coper."
With five thousand horses in the paternal stables, or rather
straying over the patrimonial plains, there was but slight motive
for sharp practice; and why should she deny such trifling
gratification, even though the man seeking it was a
stranger&mdash;perhaps an enemy?</p>

<p>She did not.</p>

<p>"If you are in earnest, señor," was her response, "you are
welcome to what you want."</p>

<p>"I am in earnest, señorita."</p>

<p>"Take him, then!" said she, leaping out of her saddle, and
commencing to undo the girths, "We cannot exchange saddles: yours
would be a mile too big for me!"</p>

<p>Calhoun was too happy to find words for a rejoinder.  He
hastened to assist her in removing the saddle; after which he
took off his own.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes the horses were exchanged&mdash;the
saddles and bridles being retained by their respective
owners.</p>

<p>To Isidora there was something ludicrous in the transference.
She almost laughed while it was being carried on.</p>

<p>Calhoun looked upon it in a different light.  There was a
purpose present before his mind&mdash;one of the utmost
importance.</p>

<p>They parted without much further speech&mdash;only the usual
greetings of adieu&mdash;Isidora going off on the <i>frison</i>;
while the ex-officer, mounted on the grey mustang, continued his
course in the direction of Casa del Corvo.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch79"></a>CHAPTER SEVENTY NINE.<br>

AN UNTIRING TRACKER.</h2>

<p class="first">
ZEB was not long in arriving at the spot where he had
"hitched" his mare.  The topography of the chapparal was familiar
to him; and he crossed it by a less circuitous route than that
taken by the cripple.</p>

<p>He once more threw himself upon the trail of the broken shoe,
in full belief that it would fetch out not a hundred miles from
Casa del Corvo.</p>

<p>It led him along a road running almost direct from one of the
crossings of the Rio Grande to Fort Inge.  The road was a half-
mile in width&mdash;a thing not uncommon in Texas, where every
traveller selects his own path, alone looking to the general
direction.</p>

<p>Along one edge of it had gone the horse with the damaged
shoe.</p>

<p>Not all the way to Fort Inge.  When within four or five miles
of the post, the trail struck off from the road, at an angle of
just such degree as followed in a straight line would bring out
by Poindexter's plantation.  So confident was Zeb of this, that
he scarce deigned to keep his eye upon the ground; but rode
forwards, as if a finger-post was constantly by his side.</p>

<p>He had long before given up following the trail afoot. Despite
his professed contempt for "horse-fixings"&mdash;as he called
riding&mdash;he had no objection to finish his journey in the
saddle&mdash;fashed as he now was with the fatigue of protracted
trailing over prairie and through chapparal. Now and then only
did he cast a glance upon the ground&mdash;less to assure himself
he was on the track of the broken shoe, than to notice whether
something else might not be learnt from the sign, besides its
mere direction.</p>

<p>There were stretches of the prairie where the turf, hard and
dry, had taken no impression.  An ordinary traveller might have
supposed himself the first to pass over the ground.  But Zeb
Stump was not of this class; and although he could not always
distinguish the hoof marks, he knew within an inch where they
would again become visible&mdash;on the more moist and softer
patches of the prairie.</p>

<p>If at any place conjecture misled him, it was only for a short
distance, and he soon corrected himself by a traverse.</p>

<p>In this half-careless, half-cautious way, he had approached
within a mile of Poindexter's plantation.  Over the tops of the
mezquite trees the crenelled parapet was in sight; when something
he saw upon the ground caused a sudden change in his demeanour. A
change, too, in his attitude; for instead of remaining on the
back of his mare, he flung himself out of the saddle; threw the
bridle upon her neck; and, rapidly passing in front of her,
commenced taking up the trail afoot.</p>

<p>The mare made no stop, but continued on after him&mdash;with
an air of resignation, as though she was used to such
eccentricities.</p>

<p>To an inexperienced eye there was nothing to account for this
sudden dismounting.  It occurred at a place where the turf
appeared untrodden by man, or beast.  Alone might it be inferred
from Zeb's speech, as he flung himself out of the saddle:</p>

<p>"His track! goin' to hum!" were the words muttered in a slow,
measured tone; after which, at a slower pace, the dismounted
hunter kept on along the trail.</p>

<p>In a little time after it conducted him into the chapparal;
and in less to a stop&mdash;sudden, as if the thorny thicket had
been transformed into a <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>, impenetrable
both to him and his "critter."</p>

<p>It was not this.  The path was still open before
him&mdash;more open than ever.  It was its openness that had
furnished him with a cause for discontinuing his advance.</p>

<p>The path sloped down into a valley below&mdash;a depression in
the prairie, along the concavity of which, at times, ran a tiny
stream&mdash;ran arroyo. It was now dry, or only occupied by
stagnant pools, at long distances apart.  In the mud-covered
channel was a man, with a horse close behind him&mdash;the latter
led by the bridle.</p>

<p>There was nothing remarkable in the behaviour of the horse; he
was simply following the lead of his dismounted rider.</p>

<p>But the man&mdash;what was he doing?  In his movements there
was something peculiar&mdash;something that would have puzzled an
uninitiated spectator.</p>

<p>It did not puzzle Zeb Stump; or but for a second of time.</p>

<p>Almost the instant his eye fell upon it, he read the meaning
of the manoeuvre, and mutteringly pronounced it to himself.</p>

<p>"Oblitturatin' the print o' the broken shoe, or tryin' to do
thet same! 'Taint no use, Mister Cash Calhoun&mdash;no manner o'
use.  Ye've made yur fut marks too deep to deceive <i>me</i>; an
by the Eturnal I'll foller them, though they shed conduck me into
the fires o' hell?"</p>

<p>As the backwoodsman terminated his blasphemous apostrophe, the
man to whom it pointed, having finished his task of obscuration,
once more leaped into his saddle, and hurried on.</p>

<p>On foot the tracker followed; though without showing any
anxiety about keeping him in sight.</p>

<p>There was no need for that.  The sleuth hound on a fresh slot
could not be more sure of again viewing his victim, than was Zeb
Stump of coming up with his.  No chicanery of the
chapparal&mdash;no twistings or doublings&mdash; could save
Calhoun now.</p>

<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="0900261h-images/TheHeadlessHorseman-15.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>The tracker advanced freely; not expecting to make halt again,
till he should come within sight of Casa del Corvo.</p>

<p>Little blame to him that his reckoning proved wrong.  Who
could have foretold such an interruption as that occasioned by
the encounter between Cassius Calhoun and Isidora Covarubio de
los Llanos?</p>

<p>Though at sight of it, taken by surprise&mdash;perhaps
something more&mdash;Zeb did not allow his feelings to betray his
presence near the spot.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it seemed to stimulate him to increased
caution.</p>

<p>Turning noiselessly round, he whispered some cabalistic words
into the care of his "critter;" and then stole silently forward
under cover of the acacias.</p>

<p>Without remonstrance, or remark, the mare followed.  He soon
came to a fall stop&mdash;his animal doing the same, in imitation
so exact as to appear its counterpart.</p>

<p>A thick growth of mezquite trees separated him from the two
individuals, by this time engaged in a lively interchange of
speech.</p>

<p>He could not see them, without exposing himself to the danger
of being detected in his eaves-dropping; but he heard what they
said all the same.</p>

<p>He kept his place&mdash;listening till the <i>horse trade</i>
was concluded, and for some time after.</p>

<p>Only when they had separated, and both taken departure did he
venture to come forth from his cover.</p>

<p>Standing upon the spot lately occupied by the "swoppers," and
looking "both ways at once," he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Geehosophat! thur's a compack atween a <i>he</i> an'
<i>she</i>-devil; an' durn'd ef I kin tell, which hez got the
bessest o' the bargin!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch80"></a>CHAPTER EIGHTY.<br>

A DOORWAY WELL WATCHED.</h2>

<p class="first">
IT was some time before Zeb Stump sallied forth from the
covert where he had been witness to the "horse swop."  Not till
both the bargainers had ridden entirely out of sight.  Then he
went not after either; but stayed upon the spot, as if undecided
which he should follow.</p>

<p>It was not exactly this that kept him to the place; but the
necessity of taking what he was in the habit of calling a "good
think."</p>

<p>His thoughts were about the exchange of the horses: for he had
heard the whole dialogue relating thereto, and the proposal
coming from Calhoun. It was this that puzzled, or rather gave him
reason for reflection. What could be the motive?</p>

<p>Zeb knew to be true what the Mexican had said: that the States
horse was, in market value, worth far more than the mustang.  He
knew, moreover, that Cassius Calhoun was the last man to be
"coped" in a horse trade.  Why, then, had he done the "deal?"</p>

<p>The old hunter pulled off his felt hat; gave his hand a twist
or two through his unkempt hair; transferred the caress to the
grizzled beard upon his chin&mdash;all the while gazing upon the
ground, as if the answer to his mental interrogatory was to
spring out of the grass.</p>

<p>"Thur air but one explication o't," he at length muttered:
"the grey's the faster critter o' the two&mdash;ne'er a doubt
'beout thet; an Mister Cash wants him for his fastness: else why
the durnation shed he a gin a hoss thet 'ud sell for four o' his
sort in any part o' Texas, an twicet thet number in Mexiko?  I
reck'n he's bargained for the heels.  Why?  Durn me, ef I don't
suspect why.  He wants&mdash;he&mdash;heigh&mdash;I hev
it&mdash;somethin' as kin kum up wi' the Headless!</p>

<p>"Thet's the very thing he's arter&mdash;sure as my name's
Zeb'lon Stump. He's tried the States hoss an foun' him slow. Thet
much I knowd myself. Now he thinks, wi' the mowstang, he may hev
a chance to overhaul the tother, ef he kin only find him agin; an
for sartin he'll go in sarch o' him.</p>

<p>"He's rad on now to Casser Corver&mdash;maybe to git a pick o'
somethin' to eat.  He won't stay thur long.  'Fore many hours hev
passed, somebody 'll see him out hyur on the purayra; an thet
somebody air boun' to be Zeb'lon Stump.</p>

<p>"Come, ye critter!" he continued, turning to the mare, "ye
thort ye wur a goin' hum, did ye?  Yur mistaken 'beout that.
Ye've got to squat hyur for another hour or two&mdash;if not the
hul o' the night.  Never mind, ole gurl!  The grass don't look so
had; an ye shell hev a chance to git yur snout to it.  Thur
now&mdash;eet your durned gut-full!"</p>

<p>While pronouncing this apostrophe, he drew the head-stall over
the ears of his mare; and, chucking the bridle across the
projecting tree of the saddle, permitted her to graze at
will.</p>

<p>Having secured her in the chapparal where he had halted, he
walked on&mdash; along the track taken by Calhoun.</p>

<p>Two hundred yards farther on, and the jungle terminated.
Beyond stretched an open plain; and on its opposite side could be
seen the hacienda of Casa del Corvo.</p>

<p>The figure of a horseman could be distinguished against its
whitewashed facade&mdash;in another moment lost within the dark
outline of the entrance.</p>

<p>Zeb knew who went in.</p>

<p>"From this place," he muttered, "I kin see him kum out; an
durn me, ef I don't watch till he do kum out&mdash;ef it shed be
till this time o' the morrow.  So hyur goes for a spell o'
patience."</p>

<p>He first lowered himself to his knees.  Then, "squirming"
round till his back came in contact with the trunk of a honey-
locust, he arranged himself into a sitting posture.  This done,
he drew from his capacious pocket a wallet, containing a "pone"
of corn-bread, a large "hunk" of fried "hog-meat," and a flask of
liquor, whose perfume proclaimed it "Monongahela."</p>

<p>Having eaten about half the bread, and a like quantity of the
meat, he returned the remaining moieties to the wallet; which he
suspended over head upon a branch.  Then taking a satisfactory
swig from the whiskey-flask, and igniting his pipe, he leant back
against the locust&mdash; with arms folded over his breast, and
eyes bent upon the gateway of Casa del Corvo.</p>

<p>In this way he kept watch for a period of full two hours;
never changing the direction of his glance; or not long enough
for any one to pass out unseen by him.</p>

<p>Forms came out, and went in&mdash;several of them&mdash;men
and women.  But even in the distance their scant light-coloured
garments, and dusky complexions, told them to be only the
domestics of the mansion. Besides, they were all on foot; and he,
for whom Zeb was watching, should come on horseback&mdash;if at
all.</p>

<p>His vigil was only interrupted by the going down of the sun;
and then only to cause a change in his post of observation.  When
twilight began to fling its purple shadows over the plain, he
rose to his feet; and, leisurely unfolding his tall figure, stood
upright by the stem of the tree&mdash;as if this attitude was
more favourable for "considering."</p>

<p>"Thur's jest a posserbillity the skunk mout sneak out i' the
night?" was his reflection.  "Leastways afore the light o' the
mornin'; an I must make sure which way he takes purayra.</p>

<p>"'Taint no use my toatin' the maar after me," he continued,
glancing in the direction where the animal had been left.  "She'd
only bother me. Beside, thur's goin' to be a clurrish sort o'
moonlight; an she mout be seen from the nigger quarter.  She'll
be better hyur&mdash;both for grass and kiver."</p>

<p>He went back to the mare; took off the saddle; fastened the
trail-rope round her neck, tying the other end to a tree; and
then, unstrapping his old blanket from the cantle, he threw it
across his left arm, and walked off in the direction of Casa del
Corvo.</p>

<p>He did not proceed <i>pari passu</i>; but now quicker, and now
more hesitatingly&mdash;timing himself, by the twilight&mdash;so
that his approach might not be observed from the hacienda.</p>

<p>He had need of this caution: for the ground which he had to
pass was like a level lawn, without copse or cover of any kind.
Here and there stood a solitary tree&mdash;dwarf-oak or
<i>algarobia</i>, but not close enough to shelter him from being
seen through the windows&mdash;much less from the azotea.</p>

<p>Now and then he stopped altogether&mdash;to wait for the
deepening of the twilight.</p>

<p>Working his way in this stealthy manner, he arrived within
less than two hundred yards of the walls&mdash;just as the last
trace of sunlight disappeared from the sky.</p>

<p>He had reached the goal of his journey&mdash;for that
day&mdash;and the spot on which he was likely to pass the
night.</p>

<p>A low stemless bush grew near; and, laying himself down behind
it, he resumed the espionage, that could scarce be said to have
been interrupted.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THROUGHOUT the live-long night Zeb Stump never
closed both eyes at the same time.  One was always on the watch;
and the unflagging earnestness, with which he maintained it,
proclaimed him to be acting under the influence of some motive
beyond the common.</p>

<p>During the earlier hours he was not without sounds to cheer,
or at least relieve, the monotony of his lonely vigil.  There was
the hum of voices from the slave cabins; with now and then a peal
of laughter.  But this was more suppressed than customary; nor
was it accompanied by the clear strain of the violin, or the
lively tink-a-tink of the banjo&mdash;sounds almost
characteristic of the "negro-quarter," at night.</p>

<p>The sombre silence that hung over the "big house" extended to
the hearths of its sable retainers.</p>

<p>Before midnight the voices became hushed, and stillness
reigned everywhere; broken only at intervals by the howl of a
straying hound&mdash; uttered in response to the howl-bark of a
coyote taking care to keep far out upon the plain.</p>

<p>The watcher had spent a wearisome day, and could have
slept&mdash;but for his thoughts.  Once when these threatened to
forsake him, and he was in danger of dozing, he started suddenly
to his feet; took a turn or two over the sward; and, then lying
down again, re-lit his pipe; stuck his head into the heart of the
bush; and smoked away till the bowl was burnt empty.</p>

<p>During all this time, he kept his eyes upon the great gateway
of the mansion; whose massive door&mdash;he could tell by the
moonlight shining upon it&mdash;remained shut.</p>

<p>Again did he change his post of observation; the sun's
rising&mdash;as its setting had done&mdash;seeming to give him
the cue.</p>

<p>As the first tint of dawn displayed itself on the horizon, he
rose gently to his feet; clutched the blanket so as to bring its
edges in contact across his breast; and, turning his back upon
Casa del Corvo, walked slowly away&mdash;taking the same track by
which he had approached it on the preceding night.</p>

<p>And again with unequal steps: at short intervals stopping and
looking back&mdash;under his arm, or over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Nowhere did he make a prolonged pause; until reaching the
locust-tree, under whose shade he had made his evening meal; and
there, in the same identical attitude, he proceeded to break his
fast.</p>

<p>The second half of the "pone" and the remaining moiety of the
pork, soon disappeared between his teeth; after which followed
the liquor that had been left in his flask.</p>

<p>He had refilled his pipe, and was about relighting it, when an
object came before his eyes, that caused him hastily to return
his flint and steel to the pouch from which he had taken
them.</p>

<p>Through the blue mist of the morning the entrance of Casa del
Corvo showed a darker disc.  The door had been drawn open.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant a horseman was seen to sally forth,
mounted upon a small grey horse; and the door was at once closed
behind him.</p>

<p>Zeb Stump made no note of this.  He only looked to see what
direction the early traveller would take.</p>

<p>Less than a score of seconds sufficed to satisfy him.  The
horse's head and the face of the rider were turned towards
himself.</p>

<p>He lost no time in trying to identify either.  He did not
doubt of its being the same man and horse, that had passed that
spot on the evening before; and he was equally confident they
were going to pass it again.</p>

<p>What he did was to shamble up to his mare; in some haste get
her saddled and bridled; and then, having taken up his trail
rope, lead her off into a cover&mdash;from which he could command
a view of the chapparal path, without danger of being himself
seen.</p>

<p>This done, he awaited the arrival of the traveller on the grey
steed&mdash; whom he knew to be Captain Cassius Calhoun.</p>

<p>He waited still longer&mdash;until the latter had trotted
past; until he had gone quite through the belt of chapparal, and
in the hazy light of the morning gradually disappeared on the
prairie beyond.</p>

<p>Not till then did Zeb Stump clamber into his saddle; and,
"prodding" his solitary spur against the ribs of his roadster,
cause the latter to move on.</p>

<p>He went after Cassius Calhoun; but without showing the
slightest concern about keeping the latter in sight!</p>

<p>He needed not this to guide him.  The dew upon the grass was
to him a spotless page&mdash;the tracks of the grey mustang a
type, as legible as the lines of a printed book.</p>

<p>He could read them at a trot; ay, going at a gallop!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch81"></a>CHAPTER EIGHTY ONE.<br>

HEADS DOWN&mdash;HEELS UP!</h2>

<p class="first">
WITHOUT suspicion that he had been seen leaving the
house&mdash;except by Pluto, who had saddled the grey
mustang&mdash;Calhoun rode on across the prairie.</p>

<p>Equally unsuspicious was he, in passing the point where Zeb
Stump stood crouching in concealment.</p>

<p>In the dim light of the morning he supposed himself unseen by
human eye; and he recked not of any other.</p>

<p>After parting from the timbered border, he struck off towards
the Nueces; riding at a brisk trot&mdash;now and then increasing
to a canter.</p>

<p>Por the first six or eight miles he took but little note of
aught that was around.  An occasional glance along the horizon
seemed to satisfy him; and this extended only to that portion of
the vast circle before his face.  He looked neither to the right
nor the left; and only once behind&mdash;after getting some
distance from the skirt of the chapparal.</p>

<p>Before him was the object&mdash;still unseen&mdash;upon which
his thoughts were straying.</p>

<p>What that object was he and only one other knew&mdash;that
other Zeb Stump&mdash; though little did Calhoun imagine that
mortal man could have a suspicion of the nature of his early
errand.</p>

<p>The old hunter had only conjectured it; but it was a
conjecture of the truth of which he was as certain, as if the ex-
captain had made him his confidant.  He knew that the latter had
gone off in search of the Headless Horseman&mdash;in hopes of
renewing the chase of yesterday, with a better chance of
effecting a capture.</p>

<p>Though bestriding a steed fleet as a Texan stag, Calhoun was
by no means sanguine of success.  There were many chances against
his getting sight of the game he intended to take: at least two
to one; and this it was that formed the theme of his reflections
as he rode onward.</p>

<p>The uncertainty troubled him; but he was solaced by a hope
founded upon some late experiences.</p>

<p>There was a particular place where he had twice encountered
the thing he was in search of.  It might be there again?</p>

<p>This was an embayment of green sward, where the savannah was
bordered by the chapparal, and close to the embouchure of that
opening&mdash;where it was supposed the murder had been
committed!</p>

<p>"Odd he should always make back there?" reflected Calhoun, as
he pondered upon the circumstance.  "Damned ugly odd it is! Looks
as if he knew&mdash;.  Bah!  It's only because the grass is
better, and that pond by the side of it.  Well!  I hope he's been
thinking that way this morning. If so, there'll be a chance of
finding him.  If not, I must go on through the chapparal; and
hang me if I like it&mdash;though it be in the daylight. Ugh!</p>

<p>"Pish! what's there to fear&mdash;now that he's safe in limbo?
Nothing but the <i>bit of lead</i>; and <i>it</i> I must have, if
I should ride this thing till it drops dead in its tracks.  Holy
Heaven! what's that out yonder?"</p>

<p>These last six words were spoken aloud.  All the rest had been
a soliloquy in thought.</p>

<p>The speaker, on pronouncing them, pulled up, almost dragging
the mustang on its haunches; and with eyes that seemed ready to
start from their sockets, sate gazing across the plain.</p>

<p>There was something more than surprise in that stedfast
glance&mdash;there was horror.</p>

<p>And no wonder: for the spectacle upon which it rested was one
to terrify the stoutest heart.</p>

<p>The sun had stolen up above the horizon of the prairie, and
was behind the rider's back, in the direct line of the course he
had been pursuing. Before him, along the heaven's edge, extended
a belt of bluish mist&mdash; the exhalation arising out of the
chapparal&mdash;now not far distant.  The trees themselves were
unseen&mdash;concealed under the film floating over them, that
like a veil of purple gauze, rose to a considerable height above
their tops&mdash;gradually merging into the deeper azure of the
sky.</p>

<p>On this veil, or moving behind it&mdash;as in the
transparencies of a stage scene&mdash;appeared a form strange
enough to have left the spectator incredulous, had he not beheld
it before.  It was that of the Headless Horseman.</p>

<p>But not as seen before&mdash;either by Calhoun himself, or any
of the others. No.  It was now altogether different.  In shape
the same; but in size it was increased to tenfold its original
dimensions!</p>

<p>No longer a man, but a Colossus&mdash;a giant.  No longer a
horse, but an animal of equine shape, with the towering height
and huge massive bulk of a mastodon!</p>

<p>Nor was this all of the new to be noted about the Headless
Horseman.  A still greater change was presented in his
appearance; one yet more inexplicable, if that could possibly be.
He was no longer walking upon the ground, but against the sky;
both horse and rider moving in an inverted position!  The hoofs
of the former were distinctly perceptible upon the upper edge of
the film; while the shoulders&mdash;I had almost said
<i>head</i>&mdash;of the latter were close down to the line of
the horizon!  The serape shrouding them hung in the right
direction&mdash;not as regarded the laws of gravity, but the
attitude of the wearer.  So, too, the bridle reins, the mane, and
sweeping tail of the horse.  All draped <i>upwards</i>!</p>

<p>When first seen, the spectral form&mdash;now more spectre-like
than ever&mdash;was going at a slow, leisurely walk.  In this
pace it for some time continued&mdash;Calhoun gazing upon it with
a heart brimful of horror.</p>

<p>All of a sudden it assumed a change.  Its regular outlines
became confused by a quick transformation; the horse having
turned, and gone off at a trot in the opposite direction, though
still with his heels against the sky!</p>

<p>The spectre had become alarmed, and was retreating!</p>

<p>Calhoun, half palsied with fear, would have kept his ground,
and permitted it to depart, but for his own horse; that, just
then shying suddenly round, placed him face to face with the
explanation.</p>

<p>As he turned, the tap of a shod hoof upon the prairie turf
admonished him that a real horseman was near&mdash;if that could
be called real, which had thrown such a frightful shadow.</p>

<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="0900261h-images/TheHeadlessHorseman-16.png"

</div>
<br>

<p>"It's the <i>mirage</i>!" he exclaimed, with the addition of
an oath to give vent to his chagrin.  "What a fool I've been to
let it humbug me! There's the damned thing that did it: the very
thing I'm in search of. And so close too!  If I'd known, I might
have got hold of him before he saw me.  Now for a chase; and, by
God, I'll <i>grup</i> him, if I have to gallop to the other end
of Texas!"</p>

<p>Voice, spur, and whip were simultaneously exerted to prove the
speaker's earnestness; and in five minutes after, two horsemen
were going at full stretch across the prairie&mdash;their horses
both to the prairie born&mdash;one closely pursuing the
other&mdash;the pursued without a head; the pursuer with a heart
that throbbed under a desperate determination.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE chase was not a long one&mdash;at least, so
far as it led over the open prairie; and Calhoun had begun to
congratulate himself on the prospect of a capture.</p>

<p>His horse appeared the swifter; but this may have arisen from
his being more earnestly urged; or that the other was not
sufficiently scared to care for escaping.  Certainly the grey
steed gained ground&mdash;at length getting so close, that
Calhoun made ready his rifle.</p>

<p>His intention was to shoot the horse down, and so put an end
to the pursuit.</p>

<p>He would have fired on the instant, but for the fear of a
miss.  But having made more than one already, he restrained
himself from pulling trigger, till he could ride close enough to
secure killing shot.</p>

<p>While thus hesitating, the chase veered suddenly from off the
treeless plain, and dashed into the opening of the timber.</p>

<p>This movement, unexpected by the pursuer, caused him to lose
ground; and in the endeavour to regain it, more than a half mile
of distance was left behind him.</p>

<p>He was approaching a spot well, too well, known to
him&mdash;the place where blood had been spilt.</p>

<p>On any other occasion he would have shunned it; but there was
in his heart a thought that hindered him from dwelling upon
memories of the past&mdash;steeling it against all reflection,
except a cold fear for the future.  The capture of the strange
equestrian could alone allay this fear&mdash;by removing the
danger he dreaded.</p>

<p>Once more he had gained ground in the chase.  The spread
nostrils of his steed were almost on a line with the sweeping
tail of that pursued.  His rifle lay ready in his left hand, its
trigger guard covered by the fingers of his right.  He was
searching for a spot to take aim at.</p>

<p>In another second the shot would have been fired, and a bullet
sent between the ribs of the retreating horse, when the latter,
as if becoming aware of the danger, made a quick curvet to the
off side; and then, aiming a kick at the snout of his pursuer,
bounded on in a different direction!</p>

<p>The suddenness of the demonstration, with the sharp, spiteful
"squeal" that accompanied it&mdash;appearing almost to speak of
an unearthly intelligence&mdash;for the moment disconcerted
Calhoun; as it did the horse he was riding.</p>

<p>The latter came to a stop; and refused to go farther; till the
spur, plunged deep between his ribs, once more forced him to the
gallop.</p>

<p>And now more earnestly than ever did his rider urge him on;
for the pursued, no longer keeping to the path, was heading
direct for the thicket.  The chase might there terminate, without
the chased animal being either killed or captured.</p>

<p>Hitherto Calhoun had only been thinking of a trial of speed.
He had not anticipated such an ending, as was now both possible
and probable; and with a more reckless resolve, he once more
raised his rifle for the shot.</p>

<p>By this time both were close in to the bushes&mdash;the
Headless Horseman already half-screened by the leafy branches
that swept swishing along his sides.  Only the hips of his horse
could be aimed at; and upon these was the gun levelled.</p>

<p>The sulphureous smoke spurted forth from its muzzle; the crack
was heard simultaneously; and, as if caused by the discharge, a
dark object came whirling through the cloud, and fell with a dull
"thud" upon the turf.</p>

<p>With a bound and a roll&mdash;that brought it among the feet
of Calhoun's horse&mdash;it became stationary.</p>

<p>Stationary, but not still.  It continued to oscillate from
side to side, like a top before ceasing to spin.</p>

<p>The grey steed snorted, and reared back.  His rider uttered a
cry of intensified alarm.</p>

<p>And no wonder.  If read in Shakespearean lore, he might have
appropriately repeated the words "Shake not those gory locks":
for, on the ground beneath, was the head of a man&mdash;still
sticking in its hat&mdash; whose stiff orbicular brim hindered it
from staying still.</p>

<p>The face was toward Calhoun&mdash;upturned at just such an
angle as to bring it full before him.  The features were
bloodstained, wan, and shrivelled; the eyes open, but cold and
dim, like balls of blown glass; the teeth gleaming white between
livid lips, yet seemingly set in an expression of careless
contentment.</p>

<p>All this saw Cassius Calhoun.</p>

<p>He saw it with fear and trembling.  Not for the supernatural
or unknown, but for the real and truly comprehended.</p>

<p>Short was his interview with that silent, but speaking head.
Ere it had ceased to oscillate on the smooth sward, he wrenched
his horse around; struck the rowels deep; and galloped away from
the ground!</p>

<p>No farther went he in pursuit of the Headless
Horseman&mdash;still heard breaking through the bushes&mdash;but
back&mdash;back to the prairie; and on, on, to Casa del
Corvo!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch82"></a>CHAPTER EIGHTY TWO.<br>

A QUEER PARCEL.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE backwoodsman, after emerging from the thicket, proceeded
as leisurely along the trail, as if he had the whole day before
him, and no particular motive for making haste.</p>

<p>And yet, one closely scrutinising his features, might there
have observed an expression of intense eagerness; that accorded
with his nervous twitching in the saddle, and the sharp glances
from time to time cast before him.</p>

<p>He scarce deigned to look upon the "sign" left by Calhoun.  It
he could read out of the corner of his eye.  As to following it,
the old mare could have done that without him!</p>

<p>It was not this knowledge that caused him to hang back; for he
would have preferred keeping Calhoun in sight.  But by doing
this, the latter might see <i>him</i>; and so frustrate the end
he desired to attain.</p>

<p>This end was of more importance than any acts that might occur
between; and, to make himself acquainted with the latter, Zeb
Stump trusted to the craft of his intellect, rather than the
skill of his senses.</p>

<p>Advancing slowly and with caution&mdash;but with that
constancy that ensures good speed&mdash;he arrived at length on
the spot where the <i>mirage</i> had made itself manifest to
Calhoun.</p>

<p>Zeb saw nothing of this.  It was gone; and the sky stretched
down to the prairie&mdash;the blue meeting the green in a
straight unbroken line.</p>

<p>He saw, however, what excited him almost as much as the
spectre would have done: two sets of horse-tracks going
together&mdash;those that went after being the hoof-marks of
Calhoun's new horse&mdash;of which Zeb had already taken the
measure.</p>

<p>About the tracks <i>underneath</i> he had no
conjecture&mdash;at least as regarded their identification. These
he knew, as well as if his own mare had made them.</p>

<p>"The skunk's hed a find!" were the words that escaped him, as
he sate gazing upon the double trail.  "It don't foller from
thet," he continued, in the same careless drawl, "thet he hez
made a catch.  An' yit, who knows?  Durn me, ef he moutn't!
Thur's lots o' chances for his doin' it.  The mowstang may a let
him come clost up&mdash;seein' as he's ridin' one o' its own
sort; an ef it dud&mdash;ay, ef it dud&mdash;</p>

<p>"What the durnation am I stannin' hyur for?  Thur ain't no
time to be wasted in shiller-shallerin'.  Ef he shed grup thet
critter, an git what he wants from it, then I mout whissel for
what I want, 'ithout the ghost o' a chance for gettin' it.</p>

<p>"I must make a better rate o' speed.  Gee-up, ole gurl; an see
ef ye can't overtake that ere grey hoss, as scuttled past half-a-
hour agone. Now for a spell o' yur swiftness, the which you kin
show along wi' any o' them, I reckon&mdash;thet air when ye're
pressed.  Gee-up!"</p>

<p>Instead of using the cruel means employed by him when wanting
his mare to make her best speed, he only drove the old spur
against her ribs, and started her into a trot.  He had no desire
to travel more rapidly than was consistent with caution; and
while trotting he kept his eyes sharply ranging along the skyline
in front of him.</p>

<p>"From the way his track runs," was his reflection, "I kin tell
pretty nigh whar it's goin' to fetch out.  Everything seems to go
that way; an so did he, poor young fellur&mdash;never more to
come back.  Ah, wal! ef t'aint possible to ree-vive him agin, may
be it air to squar the yards wi' the skunk as destroyed him.  The
Scripter sez, 'a eye for a eye, an a tooth for a tooth,' an I
reckin I'll shet up somebody's daylights, an spoil the use o'
thur ivories afore I hev done wi' him.  Somebody as don't
suspeeshun it neyther, an that same&mdash;.  Heigh!  Yonner he
goes! An' yonner too the Headless, by Geehosophat!  Full gallup
both; an durn me, if the grey aint a overtakin' him!</p>

<p>"They aint comin' this way, so 'tain't no use in our
squattin', ole gurl.  Stan' steady for all that.  He <i>mout</i>
see us movin'.</p>

<p>"No fear.  He's too full o' his frolic to look anywhar else,
than straight custrut afore him.  Ha! jest as I
expected&mdash;into the openin'! Right down it, fast as heels kin
carry 'em!</p>

<p>"Now, my maar, on we go agin!"</p>

<p>Another stage of trotting&mdash;with his eyes kept steadfastly
fixed upon the chapparal gap&mdash;brought Zeb to the timber.</p>

<p>Although the chase had long since turned the angle of the
avenue, and was now out of sight, he did not go along the open
ground; but among the bushes that bordered it.</p>

<p>He went so as to command a view of the clear track for some
distance ahead; at the same time taking care that neither
himself, nor his mare, might be seen by any one advancing from
the opposite direction.</p>

<p>He did not anticipate meeting any one&mdash;much less the man
who soon after came in sight.</p>

<p>He was not greatly surprised at hearing a shot: for he had
been listening for it, ever since he had set eyes on the chase.
He was rather in surprise at not hearing it sooner; and when the
crack did come, he recognised the report of a yager rifle, and
knew whose gun had been discharged.</p>

<p>He was more astonished to see its owner returning along the
lane&mdash;in less than five minutes after the shot had been
fired&mdash;returning, too, with a rapidity that told of
retreat!</p>

<p>"Comin' back agin&mdash;an so soon!" he muttered, on
perceiving Calhoun. "Dog-goned queery thet air!  Thur's somethin'
amiss, more'n a miss, I reck'n.  Ho, ho, ho!  Goin', too, as if
hell war arter him!  Maybe it's the Headless hisself, and thur's
been a changin' about in the chase&mdash;tit for tat!  Darn me,
ef it don't look like it!  I'd gie a silver dollar to see thet
sort o' a thing.  He, he, he, ho, ho, hoo!"</p>

<p>Long before this, the hunter had slipped out of his saddle,
and taken the precaution to screen both himself and his animal
from the chance of being seen by the retreating rider&mdash;who
promise soon to pass the spot.</p>

<p>And soon did he pass it, going at such a gait, and with such a
wild abstracted air, that Zeb would scarce have been perceived
had he been standing uncovered in the avenue!</p>

<p>"Geehosophat!" mentally ejaculated the backwoodsman, as the
passion-scathed countenance came near enough to be scrutinised.
"If hell ain't <i>arter</i>, it's <i>inside</i> o' him!  Durn me,
ef thet face ain't the ugliest picter this coon ever clapped eyes
on.  I shed pity the wife as gets him.  Poor Miss Peintdexter!  I
hope she'll be able to steer clur o' havin' sech a cut-throat as
him to be her lord an master.</p>

<p>"What's up anyhow?  Thar don't 'pear to be anythin' arter him?
An' he still keeps on!  Whar's he boun' for now?  I must foller
an see.</p>

<p>"To hum agin!" exclaimed the hunter, after going on to the
edge of the chapparal, and observed Calhoun still going at a
gallop, with head turned homeward.  "Hum agin, for sartin!</p>

<p>"Now, ole gurl!" he continued, having remained silent till the
grey horse was nearly out of sight, "You an me goes t'other way.
We must find out what thet shot wur fired for."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">IN ten minutes after, Zeb had alighted from his
mare, and lifted up from the ground an object, the stoutest heart
might have felt horror in taking hold of&mdash;disgust, even, in
touching!</p>

<p>Not so the old hunter.  In that object he beheld the
lineaments of a face well known to him&mdash;despite the
shrivelling of the skin, and the blood streaks that so fearfully
falsified its expression&mdash;still dear to him, despite death
and a merciless mutilation.</p>

<p>He had loved that face, when it belonged to a boy; he now
cherished it, belonging not to anybody!</p>

<p>Clasping the rim of the hat that fitted tightly to the
temples&mdash;Zeb endeavoured to take it off.  He did not
succeed.  The head was swollen so as almost to burst the bullion
band twisted around it!</p>

<p>Holding it in its natural position, Zeb stood for a time
gazing tenderly on the face.</p>

<p>"Lord, O Lordy!" he drawlingly exclaimed, "what a present to
take back to <i>his</i> father, to say nothin' o' the sister!  I
don't think I'll take it.  It air better to bury the thing out
hyur, an say no more abeout it.</p>

<p>"No; durn me ef I do!  What am I thinkin' o'?  Tho' I don't
exackly see how it may help to sarcumstantiate the chain o'
evvydince, it may do somethin' torst it.  Durned queery witness
<i>it</i> 'll be to purduce in a coort o' justis!"</p>

<p>Saying this, he unstrapped his old blanket; and, using it as a
wrapper, carefully packed within it head, hat, and all.</p>

<p>Then, hanging the strange bundle over the horn of his saddle,
he remounted his mare, and rode reflectingly away.</p>

<h2><a id="ch83"></a>CHAPTER EIGHTY THREE.<br>

LIMBS OF THE LAW.</h2>

<p class="first">
ON the third day after Maurice Gerald became an inmate of the
military prison the fever had forsaken him, and he no longer
talked incoherently. On the fourth he was almost restored to his
health and strength.  The fifth was appointed for his trial!</p>

<p>This haste&mdash;that elsewhere would have been considered
indecent&mdash;was thought nothing of in Texas; where a man may
commit a capital offence, be tried, and hanged within the short
space of four-and-twenty hours!</p>

<p>His enemies, who were numerous, for some reason of their own,
insisted upon despatch: while his friends, who were few, could
urge no good reason against it.</p>

<p>Among the populace there was the usual clamouring for prompt
and speedy justice; fortified by that exciting phrase, old as the
creation itself: "that the blood of the murdered man was calling
from the ground for vengeance."</p>

<p>The advocates of an early trial were favoured by a fortuitous
circumstance.  The judge of the Supreme Court chanced just then
to be going his circuit; and the days devoted to clearing the
calendar at Fort Inge, had been appointed for that very week.</p>

<p>There was, therefore, a sort of necessity, that the case of
Maurice Gerald, as of the other suspected murderers, should be
tried within a limited time.</p>

<p>As no one objected, there was no one to ask for a
postponement; and it stood upon the docket for the day in
question&mdash;the fifteenth of the month.</p>

<p>The accused might require the services of a legal adviser.
There was no regular practitioner in the place: as in these
frontier districts the gentlemen of the long robe usually travel
in company with the Court; and the Court had not yet arrived. For
all that, a lawyer had appeared: a "counsellor" of distinction;
who had come all the way from San Antonio, to conduct the case.
As a volunteer he had presented himself!</p>

<p>It may have been generosity on the part of this gentleman, or
an eye to Congress, though it was said that gold, presented by
fair fingers, had induced him to make the journey.</p>

<p>When it rains, it rains.  The adage is true in Texas as
regards the elements; and on this occasion it was true of the
lawyers.</p>

<p>The day before that appointed for the trial of the mustanger,
a second presented himself at Fort Inge, who put forward his
claim to be upon the side of the prisoner.</p>

<p>This gentleman had made a still longer journey than he of San
Antonio; a voyage, in fact: since he had crossed the great
Atlantic, starting from the metropolis of the Emerald Isle.  He
had come for no other purpose than to hold communication with the
man accused of having committed a murder!</p>

<p>It is true, the errand that had brought him did not anticipate
this; and the Dublin solicitor was no little astonished when,
after depositing his travelling traps under the roof of Mr
Oberdoffer's hostelry, and making inquiry about Maurice Gerald,
he was told that the young Irishman was shut up in the guard-
house.</p>

<p>Still greater the attorney's astonishment on learning the
cause of his incarceration.</p>

<p>"Fwhat! the son of a Munsther Gerald accused of murdher!  The
heir of Castle Ballagh, wid its bewtiful park and demesne.  Fwy,
I've got the papers in my portmantyee here.  Faugh-a-ballagh!
Show me the way to him!"</p>

<p>Though the "Texan" Boniface was inclined to consider his
recently arrived guest entitled to a suspicion of lunacy, he
assented to his request; and furnished him with a guide to the
guard-house.</p>

<p>If the Irish attorney was mad, there appeared to be method in
his madness.  Instead of being denied admittance to the accused
criminal, he was made welcome to go in and out of the military
prison&mdash;as often as it seemed good to him.</p>

<p>Some document he had laid before the eyes of the major-
commandant, had procured him this privilege; at the same time
placing him <i>en rapport</i>, in a friendly way, with the Texan
"counsellor."</p>

<p>The advent of the Irish attorney at such a crisis gave rise to
much speculation at the Port, the village, and throughout the
settlement. The bar-room of the "Rough and Ready" was rife with
conjecturers&mdash;<i>quidnuncs</i> they could scarcely be
called: since in Texas the genus does not exist.</p>

<p>A certain grotesqueness about the man added to the national
instinct for guessing&mdash;which had been rendered
excruciatingly keen through some revelations, contributed by "Old
Duffer."</p>

<p>For all that, the transatlantic limb of the law proved himself
tolerably true to the traditions of his craft.  With the
exception of the trifling imprudences already
detailed&mdash;drawn from him in the first moments of
surprise&mdash;he never afterwards committed himself; but kept
his lips close as an oyster at ebb tide.</p>

<p>There was not much time for him to use his tongue.  On the day
after his arrival the trial was to take place; and during most of
the interval he was either in the guard-house along with the
prisoner, or closeted with the San Antonio counsel.</p>

<p>The rumour became rife that Maurice Gerald had told them a
tale&mdash;a strange weird story&mdash;but of its details the
world outside remained in itching ignorance.</p>

<p>There was one who knew it&mdash;one able to confirm
it&mdash;Zeb Stump the hunter.</p>

<p>There may have been another; but this other was not in the
confidence either of the accused or his counsel.</p>

<p>Zeb himself did not appear in their company.  Only once had he
been seen conferring with them.  After that he was
gone&mdash;both from the guard-house and the settlement, as
everybody supposed, about his ordinary business&mdash; in search
of deer, "baar," or "gobbler."</p>

<p>Everybody was in error.  Zeb for the time had forsaken his
usual pursuits, or, at all events, the game he was accustomed to
chase, capture, and kill.</p>

<p>It is true he was out upon a stalking expedition; but instead
of birds or beasts, he was after an animal of neither sort; one
that could not be classed with creatures either of the earth or
the air&mdash;a horseman without a head!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch84"></a>CHAPTER EIGHTY FOUR.<br>

AN AFFECTIONATE NEPHEW.</h2>

<p class="first">
"TRIED to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow, thank God!  Not likely that
anybody 'll catch that cursed thing before then&mdash;to be
hoped, never.</p>

<p>"<i>It</i> is all I've got to fear.  I defy them to tell
what's happened without that.  Hang me if I know myself!  Enough
only to&mdash;.</p>

<p>"Queer, the coming of this Irish pettifogger!</p>

<p>"Queer, too, the fellow from San Antonio!  Wonder who and
what's brought him?  Somebody's promised him his costs?</p>

<p>"Damn 'em!  I don't care, not the value of a red cent.  They
can make nothing out of it, but that Gerald did the deed.
Everything points that way; and everybody thinks so.  They're
bound to convict him.</p>

<p>"Zeb Stump don't think it, the suspicious old snake!  He's
nowhere to be found.  Wonder where he has gone?  On a hunt, they
say.  'Tain't likely, such time as this.  What if he be hunting
it?  What if he should catch it?</p>

<p>"I'd try again myself, if there was time.  There ain't. Before
to-morrow night it'll be all over; and afterwards if there should
turn up&mdash;.  Damn afterwards!  The thing is to make sure now.
Let the future look to itself.  With one man hung for the murder,
'tain't likely they'd care to accuse another.  Even if something
suspicious <i>did</i> turn up! they'd be shy to take hold of it.
It would be like condemning themselves!</p>

<p>"I reckon, I've got all right with the Regulators.  Sam Manley
himself appears pretty well convinced.  I knocked his doubts upon
the head, when I told him what I'd heard that night.  A little
more than I did hear; though that was enough to make a man stark,
staring mad.  Damn!</p>

<p>"It's no use crying over spilt milk.  She's met the man, and
there's an end of it.  She'll never meet him again, and that's
another end of it&mdash; except she meet him in heaven.  Well;
that will depend upon herself.</p>

<p>"I don't think <i>anything has happened between them</i>.
She's not the sort for that, with all her wildness; and it may be
what that yellow wench tells me&mdash;only <i>gratitude</i>.  No,
no, no!  It can't be.  Gratitude don't get out of its bed in the
middle of the night&mdash;to keep appointments at the bottom of a
garden?  She loves him&mdash;she loves him!  Let her love and be
damned!  She shall never have him.  She shall never see him
again, unless she prove obstinate; and then it will be but to
condemn him.  A word from her, and he's a hanged man.</p>

<p>"She shall speak it, if she don't say that other word, I've
twice asked her for.  The third time will be the last.  One more
refusal, and I show my hand.  Not only shall this Irish
adventurer meet his doom; but she shall be his condemner; and the
plantation, house, niggers, everything&mdash;.  Ah! uncle
Woodley; I wanted to see you."</p>

<p>The soliloquy above reported took place in a chamber, tenanted
only by Cassius Calhoun.</p>

<p>It was Woodley Poindexter who interrupted it.  Sad, silent,
straying through the corridors of Casa del Corvo, he had entered
the apartment usually occupied by his nephew&mdash;more by chance
than from any premeditated purpose.</p>

<p>"Want me!  For what, nephew?"</p>

<p>There was a tone of humility, almost obeisance, in the speech
of the broken man.  The once proud Poindexter&mdash;before whom
two hundred slaves had trembled every day, every hour of their
lives, now stood in the presence of his master!</p>

<p>True, it was his own nephew, who had the power to humiliate
him&mdash;his sister's son.</p>

<p>But there was not much in that, considering the character of
the man.</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you about Loo," was the rejoinder of
Calhoun.</p>

<p>It was the very subject Woodley Poindexter would have shunned.
It was something he dreaded to think about, much less make the
topic of discourse; and less still with him who now challenged
it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he did not betray surprise.  He scarce felt it.
Something said or done on the day before had led him to
anticipate this request for a conversation&mdash;as also the
nature of the subject.</p>

<p>The manner in which Calhoun introduced it, did not diminish
his uneasiness.  It sounded more like a demand than a
request.</p>

<p>"About Loo?  What of her?" he inquired, with assumed
calmness.</p>

<p>"Well," said Calhoun, apparently in reluctant utterance, as if
shy about entering upon the subject, or pretending to be so,
"I&mdash;I&mdash;wanted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd rather," put in the planter, taking advantage of the
other's hesitancy, "I'd rather not speak of <i>her</i> now."</p>

<p>This was said almost supplicatingly.</p>

<p>"And why not now, uncle?" asked Calhoun, emboldened by the
show of opposition.</p>

<p>"You know my reasons, nephew?"</p>

<p>"Well, I know the time is not pleasant.  Poor Henry
missing&mdash;supposed to be&mdash;After all, he may turn up yet,
and everything be right again."</p>

<p>"Never! we shall never see him again&mdash;living or dead.  I
have no longer a son?"</p>

<p>"You have a daughter; and she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Has disgraced me!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it, uncle&mdash;no."</p>

<p>"What means those things I've heard&mdash;myself seen?  What
could have taken her there&mdash;twenty miles across the
country&mdash;alone&mdash;in the hut of a common horse-
trader&mdash;standing by his bedside?  O God!  And why should she
have interposed to save him&mdash;him, the murderer of my
son&mdash;her own brother?  O God!"</p>

<p>"Her own story explains the first&mdash;satisfactorily, as I
think."</p>

<p>Calhoun did <i>not</i> think so.</p>

<p>"The second is simple enough.  Any woman would have done the
same&mdash;a woman like Loo."</p>

<p>"There is <i>none</i> like her.  I, her father, say so.  Oh!
that I could think it is, as you say!  My poor daughter! who
should now be dearer to me than ever&mdash;now that I have no
son!"</p>

<p>"It is for her to find you a son&mdash;one already related to
you; and who can promise to play the part&mdash;with perhaps not
so much affection as him you have lost, but with all he has the
power to give.  I won't talk to you in riddles, Uncle Woodley.
You know what I mean; and how my mind's made up about this
matter.  <i>I want Loo</i>!"</p>

<p>The planter showed no surprise at the laconic declaration.  He
expected it.  For all that, the shadow became darker on his brow.
It was evident he did not relish the proposed alliance.</p>

<p>This may seem strange.  Up to a late period, he had been its
advocate&mdash; in his own mind&mdash;and more than once,
delicately, in the ear of his daughter.</p>

<p>Previous to the migration into Texas, he had known
comparatively little of his nephew.</p>

<p>Since coming to manhood, Calhoun had been a citizen of the
state of Mississippi&mdash;more frequently a dweller in the
dissipated city of New Orleans.  An occasional visit to the
Louisiana plantation was all his uncle had seen of him; until the
developing beauty of his cousin Louise gave him the inducement to
make these visits at shorter intervals&mdash;each time
protracting them to a longer stay.</p>

<p>There was then twelve months of campaigning in Mexico; where
he rose to the rank of captain; and, after his conquests in war,
he had returned home with the full determination to make a
conquest in love&mdash;the heart of his Creole cousin.</p>

<p>From that time his residence under his uncle's roof had been
more permanent.  If not altogether liked by the young lady, he
had made himself welcome to her father, by means seldom known to
fail.</p>

<p>The planter, once rich, was now poor.  Extravagance had
reduced his estate to a hopeless indebtedness.  With his nephew,
the order was reversed: once poor, he was now rich.  Chance had
made him so.  Under the circumstances, it was not surprising,
that money had passed between them.</p>

<p>In his native place, and among his old neighbours, Woodley
Poindexter still commanded sufficient homage to shield him from
the suspicion of being <i>under</i> his nephew; as also to
restrain the latter from exhibiting the customary arrogance of
the creditor.</p>

<p>It was only after the move into Texas, that their relations
began to assume that peculiar character observable between
mortgagor and mortgagee.</p>

<p>It grew more patent, after several attempts at love-making on
the part of Calhoun, with corresponding repulses on the part of
Louise.</p>

<p>The planter had now a better opportunity of becoming
acquainted with the true character of his nephew; and almost
every day; since their arrival at Casa del Corvo, had this been
developing itself to his discredit.</p>

<p>Calhoun's quarrel with the mustanger, and its ending, had not
strengthened his uncle's respect for him; though, as a kinsman,
he was under the necessity of taking sides with him.</p>

<p>There had occurred other circumstances to cause a change in
his feelings&mdash;to make him, notwithstanding its many
advantages, <i>dislike</i> the connection.</p>

<p>Alas! there was much also to render it, if not agreeable, at
least not to be slightingly set aside.</p>

<p>Indecision&mdash;perhaps more than the sorrow for his son's
loss dictated the character of his reply.</p>

<p>"If I understand you aright, nephew, you mean <i>marriage</i>!
Surely it is not the time to talk of it now&mdash;while death is
in our house!  To think of such a thing would cause a scandal
throughout the settlement."</p>

<p>"You mistake me, uncle.  I do not mean marriage&mdash;that is,
not <i>now</i>. Only something that will secure it&mdash;when the
proper time arrives."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, Cash."</p>

<p>"You'll do that, if you only listen to me a minute."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"Well; what I want to say is this.  I've made up my mind to
get married. I'm now close upon thirty&mdash;as you know; and at
that time a man begins to get tired of running about the world.
I'm damnably tired of it; and don't intend to keep single any
longer.  <i>I'm willing to have Loo for my wife</i>.  There need
be no hurry about it.  All I want now is her promise; signed and
sealed, that there may be no <i>fluke</i>, or uncertainty.  I
want the thing settled.  When these <i>bothers</i> blow past, it
will be time enough to talk of the wedding business, and that
sort of thing."</p>

<p>The word "bothers," with the speech of which it formed part,
grated harshly on the ear of a father, mourning for his murdered
son!</p>

<p>The spirit of Woodley Poindexter was aroused&mdash;almost to
the resumption of its old pride, and the indignation that had oft
accompanied it.</p>

<p>It soon cowered again.  On one side he saw land, slaves,
wealth, position; on the other, penury that seemed perdition.</p>

<p>He did not yield altogether; as may be guessed by the
character of his reply.</p>

<p>"Well, nephew; you have certainly spoken plain enough.  But I
know not my daughter's disposition towards you.  You say you are
willing to have her for your wife.  Is she willing to have you? I
suppose there is a question about that?"</p>

<p>"I think, uncle, it will depend a good deal upon yourself. You
are her father.  Surely you can <i>convince</i> her?"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that.  She's not of the kind to be
convinced&mdash; against her will.  You, Cash, know that as well
as I."</p>

<p>"Well, I only know that I intend getting 'spliced,' as the
sailors say; and I'd like Loo for the <i>mistress of Casa del
Corvo</i>, better than any other woman in the Settlement&mdash;in
all Texas, for that matter."</p>

<p>Woodley Poindexter recoiled at the ungracious speech.  It was
the first time he had been told, that he was not the
<i>master</i> of Casa del Corvo! Indirectly as the information
had been conveyed, he understood it.</p>

<p>Once more rose before his mind the reality of lands, slaves,
wealth, and social status&mdash;alongside, the apparition of
poverty and social abasement.</p>

<p>The last looked hideous; though not more so than the man who
stood before him&mdash;his own nephew&mdash;soliciting to become
his son!</p>

<p>For purposes impossible to comprehend, God often suffers
himself to be defeated by the Devil.  In this instance was it so.
The good in Poindexter's heart succumbed to the evil.  He
promised to assist his nephew, in destroying the happiness of his
daughter.</p>

<p>"Loo!"</p>

<p>"Father!"</p>

<p>"I come to ask a favour from you."</p>

<p>"What is it, father?"</p>

<p>"You know that your cousin Cash loves you.  He is ready to die
for&mdash;more and better still, to marry you."</p>

<p>"But I am not ready to marry <i>him</i>.  No, father; <i>I</i>
shall die first. The presumptuous wretch!  I know what it means.
And he has sent <i>you</i> to make this proposal!  Tell him in
return, that, sooner than consent to become his wife, I'd go upon
the prairies&mdash;and seek my living by lassoing wild horses!
Tell him that!"</p>

<p>"Reflect, daughter!  You are, perhaps, not aware
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That my cousin is your creditor.  I know all that, dear
father.  But I know also that you are Woodley Poindexter, and I
your daughter."</p>

<p>Delicately as the hint was given, it produced the desired
effect.  The spirit of the planter surged up to its ancient
pride, His reply was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dearest Louise! image of your mother!  I had doubted you.
Forgive me, my noble girl!  Let the past be forgotten.  I shall
leave it to yourself.  You are free to refuse him!"</p>

<h2><a id="ch85"></a>CHAPTER EIGHTY FIVE.<br>

A KIND COUSIN.</h2>

<p class="first">
LOUISE POINDEXTER made full use of the liberty allowed by her
father. In less than an hour after, Calhoun was flatly
refused.</p>

<p>It was his third time of asking.  Twice before had the same
suit been preferred; informally, and rather by a figure of speech
than in the shape of a direct declaration.</p>

<p>It was the third time; and the answer told it would be the
last.  It was a simple "No," emphatically followed by the equally
simple "Never!"</p>

<p>There was no prevarication about the speech&mdash;no apology
for having made it.</p>

<p>Calhoun listened to his rejection, without much show of
surprise. Possibly&mdash;in all probability&mdash;he expected
it.</p>

<p>But instead of the blank look of despair usually observable
under the circumstances, his features remained firm, and his
cheeks free from blanching.</p>

<p>As he stood confronting his fair cousin, a spectator might
have been reminded of the jaguar, as it pauses before springing
on its prey.</p>

<p>There was that in his eye which seemed to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In less than sixty seconds, you'll change your tune."</p>

<p>What he did say was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're not in earnest, Loo?"</p>

<p>"I am, sir.  Have I spoken like one who jests?"</p>

<p>"You've spoken like one, who hasn't taken pains to
reflect."</p>

<p>"Upon what?"</p>

<p>"Many things."</p>

<p>"Name them!"</p>

<p>"Well, for one&mdash;the way I love you."</p>

<p>She made no rejoinder.</p>

<p>"A love," he continued, in a tone half explanatory, half
pleading; "a love, Loo, that no man can feel for a woman, and
survive it.  It can end only with my life.  It could not end with
<i>yours</i>."</p>

<p>There was a pause, but still no reply.</p>

<p>"'Tis no use my telling you its history.  It began on the same
day&mdash;ay, the same hour&mdash;I first saw you.</p>

<p>"I won't say it grew stronger as time passed.  It could not.
On my first visit to your father's house&mdash;now six years
ago&mdash;you may remember that, after alighting from my horse,
you asked me to take a walk with you round the garden&mdash;while
dinner was being got ready.</p>

<p>"You were but a stripling of a girl; but oh, Loo, you were a
woman in beauty&mdash;as beautiful as you are at this moment.</p>

<p>"No doubt you little thought, as you took me by the hand, and
led me along the gravelled walk, under the shade of the China
trees, that the touch of your fingers was sending a thrill into
my soul; your pretty prattle making an impression upon my heart,
that neither time, nor distance, nor yet <i>dissipation</i>, has
been able to efface."</p>

<p>The Creole continued to listen, though not without showing
sign.  Words so eloquent, so earnest, so full of sweet flattery,
could scarce fail to have effect upon a woman.  By such speech
had Lucifer succeeded in the accomplishment of his purpose. There
was pity, if not approval, in her look!</p>

<p>Still did she keep silence.</p>

<p>Calhoun continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, Loo; it's true as I tell you.  I've tried all three. Six
years may fairly be called time.  From Mississippi to Mexico was
the distance: for I went there with no other purpose than to
forget you.  It proved of no avail; and, returning, I entered
upon a course of dissipation.  New Orleans knows that.</p>

<p>"I won't say, that my passion grew stronger by these attempts
to stifle it.  I've already told you, it could not.  From the
hour you first caught hold of my hand, and called me
cousin&mdash;ah! you called me <i>handsome</i> cousin,
Loo&mdash;from that hour I can remember no change, no degrees, in
the fervour of my affection; except when jealousy has made me
hate&mdash;ay, so much, that I could have <i>killed</i> you!"</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Captain Calhoun!  This is wild talk of yours.
It is even silly!"</p>

<p>"'Tis serious, nevertheless.  I've been so jealous with you at
times, that it was a task to control myself.  My temper I could
not&mdash;as you have reason to know."</p>

<p>"Alas, cousin, I cannot help what has happened.  I never gave
you cause, to think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you are going to say; and you may leave it
unspoken.  I'll say it for you: 'to think that you ever loved
me.'  Those were the words upon your lips.</p>

<p>"I don't say you did," he continued, with deepening despair:
"I don't accuse you of tempting me.  Something did.  God, who
gave you such beauty; or the Devil, who led me to look upon
it."</p>

<p>"What you say only causes me pain.  I do not suppose you are
trying to flatter me.  You talk too earnestly for that.  But oh,
cousin Cassius, 'tis a fancy from which you will easily recover.
There are others, far fairer than I; and many, who would feel
complimented by such speeches. Why not address yourself to
them?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" he echoed, with bitter emphasis.  "What an idle
question!"</p>

<p>"I repeat it.  It is not idle.  Far more so is your affection
for me: for I must be candid with you, Cassius.  I do not&mdash;I
<i>cannot</i>, love you."</p>

<p>"You will not marry me then?"</p>

<p>"That, at least, is an idle question.  I've said I do not love
you. Surely that is sufficient."</p>

<p>"And I've said I love <i>you</i>.  I gave it as one reason why
I wish you for my wife: but there are <i>others</i>.  Are you
desirous of hearing them?"</p>

<p>As Calhoun asked this question the suppliant air forsook him.
The spirit of the jaguar was once more in his eye.</p>

<p>"You said there were other reasons.  State them!  Do not be
backward. I'm not afraid to listen."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" he rejoined, sneeringly.  "You're not afraid, ain't
you?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of.  What have I to fear?"</p>

<p>"I won't say what <i>you</i> have; but what your father
has."</p>

<p>"Let me hear it?  What concerns him, equally affects me.  I am
his daughter; and now, alas, his only&mdash;.  Go on, cousin
Calhoun!  What is this shadow hanging over him?"</p>

<p>"No shadow, Loo; but something serious, and substantial.  A
trouble he's no longer able to contend with.  You force me to
speak of things you shouldn't know anything about."</p>

<p>"Oh! don't I?  You're mistaken, cousin Cash.  I know them
already.  I'm aware that my father's in debt; and that you are
his creditor.  How could I have remained in ignorance of it? Your
arrogance about the house&mdash;your presumption, shown every
hour, and in presence of the domestics&mdash;has been evidence
sufficient to satisfy even them, that there is something amiss.
You are master of Casa del Corvo.  I know it.  You are not master
of <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>Calhoun quailed before the defiant speech.  The card, upon
which he had been counting, was not likely to gain the trick.  He
declined playing it.</p>

<p>He held a still stronger <i>in</i> his hand; which was
exhibited without farther delay.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" he retorted, sneeringly.  "Well; if I'm not master
of your heart, I am of your happiness&mdash;or shall be.  I know
the worthless wretch that's driven you to this denial&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"How innocent you are!"</p>

<p>"Of that at least I am; unless by worthless wretch you mean
yourself. In that sense I can understand you, sir.  The
description is too true to be mistaken."</p>

<p>"Be it so!" he replied, turning livid with rage, though still
keeping himself under a certain restraint.  "Well; since you
think me so worthless, it won't, I suppose, better your opinion
of me, when I tell you what I'm going to do with you?"</p>

<p>"Do with me!  You are presumptuous, cousin Cash!  You talk as
if I were your <i>protegee</i>, or slave!  I'm neither one, nor
the other!"</p>

<p>Calhoun, cowering under the outburst of her indignation,
remained silent.</p>

<p>"<i>Pardieu</i>!" she continued, "what is this threat?  Tell
me what you are <i>going to do with me</i>!  I should like to
know that."</p>

<p>"You shall."</p>

<p>"Let me hear it!  Am I to be turned adrift upon the prairie,
or shut up in a convent?  Perhaps it may be a prison?"</p>

<p>"You would like the last, no doubt&mdash;provided your
incarceration was to be in the company of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on, sir!  What is to be my destiny?  I'm impatient to have
it declared."</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry.  The first act shall be rehearsed
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"So soon?  And where, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"In a court of justice."</p>

<p>"How, sir?"</p>

<p>"By your standing before a judge, and in presence of a
jury."</p>

<p>"You are pleased to be facetious, Captain Calhoun.  Let me
tell you that I don't like such pleasantries&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pleasantries indeed!  I'm stating plain facts.  To-morrow is
the day of trial.  Mr Maurice Gerald, or McSweeney, or O'Hogerty,
or whatever's his name, will stand before the bar&mdash;accused
of murdering your brother."</p>

<p>"'Tis false!  Maurice Gerald never&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did the deed, you are going to say?  Well, that remains to be
proved. It <i>will</i> be; and from your own lips will come the
words that'll prove it&mdash;to the satisfaction of every man
upon the jury."</p>

<p>The great gazelle-eyes of the Creole were opened to their
fullest extent.  They gazed upon the speaker with a look such as
is oft given by the gazelle itself&mdash;a commingling of fear,
wonder, and inquiry.</p>

<p>It was some seconds before she essayed to speak.  Thoughts,
conjectures, fears, fancies, and suspicions, all had to do in
keeping her silent.</p>

<p>"I know not what you mean," she at length rejoined.  "You talk
of my being called into court.  For what purpose?  Though I am
the sister of him, who&mdash;I know nothing&mdash;can tell no
more than is in the mouth of everybody."</p>

<p>"Yes can you; a great deal more.  It's not in the mouth of
everybody: that on the night of the murder, you gave Gerald a
meeting at the bottom of the garden.  No more does all the world
know what occurred at that stolen interview.  How Henry intruded
upon it; how, maddened, as he might well be, by the thought of
such a disgrace&mdash;not only to his sister, but his
family&mdash;he threatened to kill the man who had caused it; and
was only hindered from carrying out that threat, by the
intercession of the woman so damnably deluded!</p>

<p>"All the world don't know what followed: how Henry, like a
fool, went after the low hound, and with what intent.  Besides
themselves, there were but two others who chanced to be
spectators of that parting."</p>

<p>"Two&mdash;who were they?"</p>

<p>The question was asked mechanically&mdash;almost with a
tranquil coolness.</p>

<p>It was answered with equal <i>sang froid</i>.</p>

<p>"One was Cassius Calhoun&mdash;the other Louise Poindexter."
She did not start.  She did not even show sign of being
surprised.  What was spoken already had prepared her for the
revelation.  Her rejoinder was a single word, pronounced in a
tone of defiance.  "Well!"</p>

<p>"Well!" echoed Calhoun, chagrined at the slight effect his
speeches had produced; "I suppose you understand me?"</p>

<p>"Not any more than ever."</p>

<p>"You wish me to speak further?"</p>

<p>"As you please, sir."</p>

<p>"I shall then.  I say to you, Loo, there's but one way to save
your father from ruin&mdash;yourself from shame.  You know what I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I know that much."</p>

<p>"You will not refuse me now?"</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i> more than <i>ever</i>!"</p>

<p>"Be it so!  Before this time to-morrow&mdash;and, by Heaven! I
mean it&mdash; before this time <i>to-morrow</i>, you shall stand
in the witness-box?"</p>

<p>"Vile spy!  Anywhere but in your presence!  Out of my sight!
This instant, or I call my father!"</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>"You needn't put yourself to the trouble.  I'm not going to
embarrass you any longer with my company&mdash;so disagreeable to
you.  I leave you to reflect.  Perhaps before the trial comes on,
you'll see fit to change your mind.  If so, I hope you'll give
notice of it&mdash;in time to stay the summons.  Good night, Loo!
I'll sleep thinking of you."</p>

<p>With these words of mockery upon his lips&mdash;almost as
bitter to himself as to her who heard them&mdash;Calhoun strode
out of the apartment, with an air less of triumph than of
guilt.</p>

<p>Louise listened, until his footsteps died away in the distant
corridor.</p>

<p>Then, as if the proud angry thoughts hitherto sustaining her
had become suddenly relaxed, she sank into a chair; and, with
both hands pressing upon her bosom, tried to still the dread
throbbings that now, more than ever, distracted it.</p>

<h2><a id="ch86"></a>CHAPTER EIGHTY SIX.<br>

A TEXAN COURT.</h2>

<p class="first">
IT is the dawn of another day.  The Aurora, rising rose-
coloured from the waves of a West Indian sea, flings its sweetest
smile athwart the savannas of Texas.</p>

<p>Almost on the same instant that the rosy light kisses the
white sand-dunes of the Mexican Gulf, does it salute the flag on
Fort Inge, nearly a hundred leagues distant: since there is just
this much of an upward inclination between the coast at Matagorda
and the spurs of the Guadalupe mountains, near which stand this
frontier post.</p>

<p>The Aurora has just lighted up the flag, that at the same time
flouting out from its staff spreads its broad field of red,
white, and blue to the gentle zephyrs of the morning.</p>

<p>Perhaps never since that staff went up, has the star-spangled
banner waved over a scene of more intense interest than is
expected to occur on this very day.</p>

<p>Even at the early hour of dawn, the spectacle may be said to
have commenced.  Along with the first rays of the Aurora,
horsemen may be seen approaching the military post from all
quarters of the compass. They ride up in squads of two, three, or
half a dozen; dismount as they arrive; fasten their horses to the
stockade fences, or picket them upon the open prairie.</p>

<p>This done, they gather into groups on the parade-ground; stand
conversing or stray down to the village; all, at one time or
another, taking a turn into the tavern, and paying their respects
to Boniface behind the bar.</p>

<p>The men thus assembling are of many distinct types and
nationalities. Almost every country in Europe has furnished its
quota; though the majority are of that stalwart race whose
ancestors expelled the Indians from the "Bloody Ground;" built
log cabins on the sites of their wigwams; and spent the remainder
of their lives in felling the forests of the Mississippi.  Some
of them have been brought up to the cultivation of corn; others
understand better the culture of cotton; while a large number,
from homes further south, have migrated into Texas to speculate
in the growth and manufacture of sugar and tobacco.</p>

<p>Most are planters by calling and inclination; though there are
graziers and cattle-dealers, hunters and horse-dealers,
storekeepers, and traders of other kinds&mdash;not a few of them
traffickers in human flesh!</p>

<p>There are lawyers, land-surveyors, and land-speculators, and
other speculators of no proclaimed calling&mdash;adventurers
ready to take a hand in whatever may turn up&mdash;whether it be
the branding of cattle, a scout against Comanches, or a spell of
filibustering across the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>Their costumes are as varied as their callings.  They have
been already described: for the men now gathering around Fort
Inge are the same we have seen before assembled in the courtyard
of Casa del Corvo&mdash;the same with an augmentation of
numbers.</p>

<p>The present assemblage differs in another respect from that
composing the expedition of searchers.  It is graced by the
presence of women&mdash;the wives, sisters, and daughters of the
men.  Some are on horseback; and remain in the saddle&mdash;their
curtained cotton-bonnets shading their fair faces from the glare
of the sun; others are still more commodiously placed for the
spectacle&mdash;seated under white waggon-tilts, or beneath the
more elegant coverings of "carrioles" and "Jerseys."</p>

<p>There is a spectacle&mdash;at least there is one looked for.
It is a trial long talked of in the Settlement.</p>

<p>Superfluous to say that it is the trial of Maurice
Gerald&mdash;known as <i>Maurice the mustanger</i>.</p>

<p>Equally idle to add, that it is for the murder of Henry
Poindexter.</p>

<p>It is not the high nature of the offence that has attracted
such a crowd, nor yet the characters of either the accused or his
victim&mdash; neither much known in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The same Court&mdash;it is the Supreme Court of the district,
Uvalde&mdash;has been in session there before&mdash;has tried all
sorts of cases, and all kinds of men&mdash;thieves, swindlers,
homicides, and even murderers&mdash;with scarce fourscore people
caring to be spectators of the trial, or staying to hear the
sentence!</p>

<p>It is not this which has brought so many settlers together;
but a series of strange circumstances, mysterious and
melodramatic; which seem in some way to be connected with the
crime, and have been for days the sole talk of the
Settlement.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to name these circumstances: they are
already known.</p>

<p>All present at Fort Inge have come there anticipating: that
the trial about to take place will throw light on the strange
problem that has hitherto defied solution.</p>

<p>Of course there are some who, independent of this, have a
feeling of interest in the fate of the prisoner.  There are
others inspired with a still sadder interest&mdash;friends and
relatives of the man <i>supposed to have been</i> murdered: for
it must be remembered, that there is yet no evidence of the
actuality of the crime.</p>

<p>But there is little doubt entertained of it.  Several
circumstances&mdash; independent of each other&mdash;have united
to confirm it; and all believe that the foul deed has been
done&mdash;as firmly as if they had been eye-witnesses of the
act.</p>

<p>They only wait to be told the details; to learn the how, and
the when, and the wherefore.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">TEN o'clock, and the Court is in session.</p>

<p>There is not much change in the composition of the crowd; only
that a sprinkling of military uniforms has become mixed with the
more sober dresses of the citizens.  The soldiers of the garrison
have been dismissed from morning parade; and, free to take their
recreation for the day, have sought it among the ranks of the
civilian spectators. There stand they side by side&mdash;soldiers
and citizens&mdash;dragoons, riflemen, infantry, and artillery,
interspersed among planters, hunters, horse-dealers, and
desperate adventurers, having just heard the "Oyez!" of the Court
crier&mdash;grotesquely pronounced "O yes!"&mdash;determined to
stand there till they hear the last solemn formulary from the
lips of the judge: "May God have mercy on your soul!"</p>

<p>There is scarce one present who does not expect ere night to
listen to this terrible final phrase, spoken from under the
shadow of that sable cap, that denotes the death doom of a fellow
creature.</p>

<p>There may be only a few who wish it.  But there are many who
feel certain, that the trial will end in a conviction; and that
ere the sun has set, the soul of Maurice Gerald will go back to
its God!</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE Court is in session.</p>

<p>You have before your mind's eye a large hall, with a raised
dais at one side; a space enclosed between panelled partitions; a
table inside it; and on its edge a box-like structure, resembling
the rostrum of a lecture-room, or the reading-desk in a
church.</p>

<p>You see judges in ermine robes; barristers in wigs of grey,
and gowns of black, with solicitors attending on them; clerks,
ushers, and reporters; blue policemen with bright buttons
standing here and there; and at the back a sea of heads and
faces, not always kempt or clean.</p>

<p>You observe, moreover, a certain subdued look on the
countenances of the spectators&mdash;not so much an air of
decorum, as a fear of infringing the regulations of the
Court.</p>

<p>You must get all this out of your mind, if you wish to form an
idea of a Court of justice on the frontiers of Texas&mdash;as
unlike its homonym in England as a bond of guerillas to a brigade
of Guardsmen.</p>

<p>There is no court-house, although there is a sort of public
room used for this and other purposes.  But the day promises to
be hot, and the Court has decided to <i>sit under a tree</i>!</p>

<p>And under a tree has it established itself&mdash;a gigantic
live-oak, festooned with Spanish moss&mdash;standing by the edge
of the parade-ground, and extending its shadow afar over the
verdant prairie.</p>

<p>A large deal table is placed underneath, with half a score of
skin-bottomed chairs set around it, and on its top a few
scattered sheets of foolscap paper, an inkstand with goose-quill
pens, a well-thumbed law-book or two, a blown-glass decanter
containing peach-brandy, a couple of common tumblers, a box of
Havannah cigars, and another of lucifer-matches.</p>

<p>Behind these <i>paraphernalia</i> sits the judge, not only un-
robed in ermine, but actually un-coated&mdash;the temperature of
the day having decided him to try the case in his <i>shirt-
sleeves</i>!</p>

<p>Instead of a wig, he wears his Panama hat, set slouchingly
over one cheek, to balance the half-smoked, half-chewed Havannah
projecting from the other.</p>

<p>The remaining chairs are occupied by men whose costume gives
no indication of their calling.</p>

<p>There are lawyers among them&mdash;attorneys, and
<i>counsellors</i>, there called&mdash;with no difference either
in social or legal status; the sheriff and his "deputy"; the
military commandant of the fort; the chaplain; the doctor;
several officers; with one or two men of undeclared
occupations.</p>

<p>A little apart are twelve individuals grouped together; about
half of them seated on a rough slab bench, the other half
"squatted" or reclining along the grass.</p>

<p>It is the <i>jury</i>&mdash;an "institution" as germane to
Texas as to England; and in Texas ten times more true to its
trust; scorning to submit to the dictation of the judge&mdash;in
England but too freely admitted.</p>

<p>Around the Texan judge and jury&mdash;close pressing upon the
precincts of the Court&mdash;is a crowd that may well be called
nondescript.  Buckskin hunting-shirts; blanket-coats&mdash;even
under the oppressive heat; frocks of "copperas stripe" and
Kentucky jeans; blouses of white linen, or sky-blue
<i>cottonade</i>; shirts of red flannel or unbleached "domestic";
dragoon, rifle, infantry, and artillery uniforms, blend and
mingle in that motley assemblage.</p>

<p>Here and there is seen a more regular costume&mdash;one more
native to the country&mdash;the <i>jaqueta</i> and
<i>calzoneros</i> of the Mexican, with the broad <i>sombrero</i>
shading his swarthy face of <i>picaresque</i> expression.</p>

<p>Time was&mdash;and that not very long ago&mdash;when men
assembled in this same spot would all have been so attired.</p>

<p>But then there was no jury of twelve, and the
judge&mdash;<i>Juez de Letras</i>&mdash; was a far more important
personage, with death in his nod, and pardon easily obtained by
those who could put <i>onzas</i> in his pocket.</p>

<p>With all its rude irregularity&mdash;despite the absence of
effete forms&mdash;of white ermine, and black silk&mdash;of
uniformed <i>alguazils</i>, or bright-buttoned
policemen&mdash;despite the presence of men that, to the
civilised eye, may appear uncouth&mdash;even savage I hesitate
not to say, that among these red flannel-shirts and coats of
Kentucky jean, the innocent man is as safe&mdash;ay far
safer&mdash;to obtain justice, and the guilty to get punished,
than amidst the formalities and hair-splitting chicaneries of our
so-called civilisation.</p>

<p>Do not mistake those men assembled under the Texan
tree&mdash;however rough their exterior may seem to your
hypercritical eye&mdash;do not mistake them for a mob of your own
"masses," brutalised from their very birth by the curse of over-
taxation.  Do not mistake them, either, for things like
yourselves&mdash;filled to the throat with a spirit of
flunkeyism&mdash;would that it choked you!&mdash;scorning all
that is grand and progressive&mdash;revering only the effete, the
superficial, and the selfish.</p>

<p>I am talking to you, my middle-class friend, who fancy
yourself a <i>citizen</i> of this our English country.  A
citizen, forsooth; without even the first and scantiest right of
citizenship&mdash;that of choosing your parliamentary
representative.</p>

<p>You fancy you <i>have</i> this right.  I have scarce patience
to tell you, you are mistaken.</p>

<p>Ay, grandly mistaken, when you imagine yourself standing on
the same political platform with those quasi-rude frontiersmen of
Texas.</p>

<p>Nothing of the kind.  <i>They</i> are "sovereign
citizens"&mdash;the peers of your superiors, or of those who
assume so to call themselves, and whose assumption you are base
enough to permit without struggle&mdash;almost without
protest!</p>

<br>

<p class="first">IN most assemblies the inner circle is the more
select.  The gem is to be found in the centre at Port Inge.</p>

<p>In that now mustered the order is reversed.  Outside is the
elegance. The fair feminine forms, bedecked in their best
dresses, stand up in spring waggons, or sit in more elegant
equipages, sufficiently elevated to see over the heads of the
male spectators.</p>

<p>It is not upon the judge that their eyes are bent, or only at
intervals. The glances are given to a group of three men, placed
near the jury, and not very far from the stem of the tree.  One
is seated, and two standing.  The former is the prisoner at the
bar; the latter the sheriff's officers in charge of him.</p>

<p>It was originally intended to try several other men for the
murder; Miguel Diaz and his associates, as also Phelim
O'Neal.</p>

<p>But in the course of a preliminary investigation the Mexican
mustanger succeeded in proving an <i>alibi</i>, as did also his
trio of companions. All four have been consequently
discharged.</p>

<p>They acknowledged having disguised themselves as Indians: for
the fact being proved home to them, they could not do less.</p>

<p>But they pretended it to have been a joke&mdash;a
<i>travestie</i>; and as there was proof of the others being at
home&mdash;and Diaz dead drunk&mdash;on the night of Henry
Poindexter's disappearance, their statement satisfied those who
had been entrusted with the inquiry.</p>

<p>As to the Connemara man, it was not thought necessary to put
him upon trial.  If an accomplice, he could only have acted at
the instigation of his master; and he might prove more
serviceable in the witness-box than in the dock.</p>

<p>Before the bar, then&mdash;if we may be permitted the figure
of speech&mdash;there stands but one prisoner, Maurice
Gerald&mdash;known to those gazing upon him as <i>Maurice the
mustanger</i>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch87"></a>CHAPTER EIGHTY SEVEN.<br>

A FALSE WITNESS.</h2>

<p class="first">
THERE are but few present who have any personal acquaintance
with the accused; though there are also but a few who have never
before heard his name.  Perhaps not any.</p>

<p>It is only of late that this has become generally known: for
previous to the six-shot duel with Calhoun, he had no other
reputation than that of an accomplished horse-catcher.</p>

<p>All admitted him to be a fine young fellow&mdash;handsome,
dashing, devoted to a fine horse, and deeming it no sin to look
fondly on a fair woman&mdash; free of heart, as most Irishmen
are, and also of speech, as will be more readily believed.</p>

<p>But neither his good, nor evil, qualities were carried to
excess.  His daring rarely exhibited itself in reckless rashness;
while as rarely did his speech degenerate into "small talk."</p>

<p>In his actions there was observable a certain <i>juste
milieu</i>.  His words were alike well-balanced; displaying, even
over his cups, a reticence somewhat rare among his
countrymen.</p>

<p>No one seemed to know whence he came; for what reason he had
settled in Texas; or why he had taken to such a queer "trade," as
that of catching wild horses&mdash;a calling not deemed the most
reputable.</p>

<p>It seemed all the more strange to those who knew: that he was
not only educated, but evidently a "born gentleman"&mdash;a
phrase, however, of but slight significance upon the frontiers of
Texas.</p>

<p>There, too, was the thing itself regarded with no great
wonder; where "born noblemen," both of France and the
"Faderland," may oft be encountered seeking an honest livelihood
by the sweat of their brow.</p>

<p>A fig for all patents of nobility&mdash;save those stamped by
the true die of Nature!</p>

<p>Such is the sentiment of this far free land.</p>

<p>And this sort of impress the young Irishman carries about
him&mdash;blazoned like the broad arrow.  There is no one likely
to mistake him for either fool or villain.</p>

<p>And yet he stands in the presence of an assembly, called upon
to regard him as an assassin&mdash;one who in the dead hour of
night has spilled innocent blood, and taken away the life of a
fellow-creature!</p>

<p>Can the charge be true?  If so, may God have mercy on his
soul!</p>

<p>Some such reflection passes through the minds of the
spectators, as they stand with eyes fixed upon him, waiting for
his trial to begin.</p>

<p>Some regard him with glances of simple curiosity; others with
interrogation; but most with a look that speaks of anger and
revenge.</p>

<p>There is one pair of eyes dwelling upon him with an expression
altogether unlike the rest&mdash;a gaze soft, but
steadfast&mdash;in which fear and fondness seem strangely
commingled.</p>

<p>There are many who notice that look of the lady spectator,
whose pale face, half hid behind the curtains of a
<i>caleche</i>, is too fair to escape observation.</p>

<p>There are few who can interpret it.</p>

<p>But among these, is the prisoner himself; who, observing both
the lady and the look, feels a proud thrill passing through his
soul, that almost compensates for the humiliation he is called
upon to undergo.  It is enough to make him, for the time, forget
the fearful position in which he is placed.</p>

<p>For the moment, it is one of pleasure.  He has been told of
much that transpired during those dark oblivious hours.  He now
knows that what he had fancied to be only a sweet, heavenly
vision, was a far sweeter reality of earth.</p>

<p>That woman's face, shining dream-like over his couch, was the
same now seen through the curtains of the <i>caleche</i>; and the
expression upon it tells him: that among the frowning spectators
he has one friend who will be true to the end&mdash;even though
it be death!</p>

<p>The trial begins.</p>

<p>There is not much ceremony in its inception.  The judge takes
off his hat strikes a lucifer-match; and freshly ignites his
cigar.</p>

<p>After half a dozen draws, he takes the "weed" from between his
teeth, lays it still smoking along the table, and says&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury!  We are here assembled to try a case,
the particulars of which are, I believe, known to all of you.  A
man has been murdered,&mdash;the son of one of our most respected
citizens; and the prisoner at the bar is accused of having
committed the crime.  It is my duty to direct you as to the legal
formalities of the trial.  It is yours to decide&mdash;after
hearing the evidence to be laid before you&mdash; whether or not
the accusation be sustained."</p>

<p>The prisoner is asked, according to the usual
formality,&mdash;"<i>Guilty, or not guilty</i>?"</p>

<p>"Not guilty," is the reply; delivered in a firm, but modest
tone.</p>

<p>Cassius Calhoun, and some "rowdies" around him, affect an
incredulous sneer.</p>

<p>The judge resumes his cigar, and remains silent.</p>

<p>The counsel for the State, after some introductory remarks,
proceeds to introduce the witnesses for the prosecution.</p>

<p>First called is Franz Oberdoffer.</p>

<p>After a few unimportant interrogatories about his calling, and
the like, he is requested to state what he knows of the affair.
This is the common routine of a Texan trial.</p>

<p>Oberdoffer's evidence coincides with the tale already told by
him: how on the night that young Poindexter was missed, Maurice
Gerald had left his house at a late hour&mdash;after midnight. He
had settled his account before leaving; and appeared to have
plenty of money.  It was not often Oberdoffer had known him so
well supplied with cash.  He had started for his home on the
Nueces; or wherever it was.  He had not said where he was going.
He was not on the most friendly terms with witness.  Witness only
supposed he was going there, because his man had gone the day
before, taking all his traps upon a pack-mule&mdash;everything,
except what the mustanger himself carried off on his horse.</p>

<p>What had he carried off?</p>

<p>Witness could not remember much in particular.  He was not
certain of his having a gun.  He rather believed that he had
one&mdash;strapped, Mexican fashion, along the side of his
saddle.</p>

<p>He could speak with certainty of having seen pistols in the
holsters, with a bowie-knife in the mustanger's belt.  Gerald was
dressed as he always went&mdash;in Mexican costume, and with a
striped Mexican blanket.  He had the last over his shoulders as
he rode off.  The witness thought it strange, his leaving at that
late hour of the night.  Still stranger, that he had told witness
of his intention to start the next morning.</p>

<p>He had been out all the early part of the night, but without
his horse&mdash; which he kept in the tavern stable.  He had
started off immediately after returning.  He stayed only long
enough to settle his account.  He appeared excited, and in a
hurry.  It was not with drink.  He filled his flask with
<i>Kirschenwasser</i>; but did not drink of it before leaving the
hotel.  Witness could swear to his being sober.  He knew that he
was excited by his manner.  While he was saddling his
horse&mdash;which he did for himself&mdash;he was all the time
talking, as if angry.  Witness didn't think it was at the animal.
He believed he had been crossed by somebody, and was angry at
something that had happened to him, before coming back to the
hotel.  Had no idea where Gerald had been to; but heard
afterwards that he had been seen going out of the village, and
down the river, in the direction of Mr Poindexter's plantation.
He had been seen going that way often for the last three or four
days of his sojourn at the hotel&mdash;both by day and
night&mdash;on foot as well as horseback&mdash;several times both
ways.</p>

<p>Such are the main points of Oberdoffer's evidence relating to
the movements of the prisoner.</p>

<p>He is questioned about Henry Poindexter.</p>

<p>Knew the young gentleman but slightly, as he came very seldom
to the hotel.  He was there on the night when last seen.  Witness
was surprised to see him there&mdash;partly because he was not in
the habit of coming, and partly on account of the lateness of the
hour.</p>

<p>Young Poindexter did not enter the house.  Only looked inside
the saloon; and called witness to the door.</p>

<p>He asked after Mr Gerald.  He too appeared sober, but excited;
and, upon being told that the mustanger was gone away, became
very much more excited.  Said he wished very much to see Gerald
that very night; and asked which way he had gone.  Witness
directed him along the Rio Grande trace&mdash;thinking the
mustanger had taken it.  Said he knew the road, and went off, as
if intending to overtake the mustanger.</p>

<p>A few desultory questions, and Oberdoffer's evidence is
exhausted.</p>

<p>On the whole it is unfavourable to the accused; especially the
circumstance of Gerald's having changed his intention as to his
time of starting.  His manner, described as excited and
angry,&mdash;perhaps somewhat exaggerated by the man who naively
confesses to a grudge against him. That is especially
unfavourable.  A murmur through the court tells that it has made
this impression.</p>

<p>But why should Henry Poindexter have been excited too?  Why
should he have been following after Gerald in such hot haste, and
at such an unusual hour&mdash;unusual for the young planter, both
as regarded his haunts and habits?</p>

<p>Had the order been reversed, and Gerald inquiring about and
going after him, the case would have been clearer.  But even then
there would have been an absence of motive.  Who can show this,
to satisfy the jury?</p>

<p>Several witnesses are called; but their testimony rather
favours the reverse view.  Some of them testify to the friendly
feeling that existed between the prisoner and the man he stands
charged with having murdered.</p>

<p>One is at length called up who gives evidence of the opposite.
It is Captain Cassius Calhoun.</p>

<p>His story produces a complete change in the character of the
trial.  It not only discloses a motive for the murder, but
darkens the deed tenfold.</p>

<p>After a craftily worded preface, in which he declares his
reluctance to make the exposure, he ends by telling all: the
scene in the garden; the quarrel; the departure of Gerald, which
he describes as having been accompanied by a threat; his being
followed by Henry; everything but the true motive for this
following, and his own course of action throughout. These two
facts he keeps carefully to himself.</p>

<p>The scandalous revelation causes a universal
surprise&mdash;alike shared by judge, jury, and spectators.  It
exhibits itself in an unmistakable manner&mdash;here in ominous
whisperings, there in ejaculations of anger.</p>

<p>These are not directed towards the man who has testified; but
against him who stands before them, now presumptively charged
with a double crime: the assassination of a son&mdash;the
defilement of a daughter!</p>

<p>A groan had been heard as the terrible testimony proceeded. It
came from a man of more than middle age&mdash;of sad subdued
aspect&mdash;whom all knew to be the father of both these
unfortunates.</p>

<p>But the eyes of the spectators dwell not on him.  They look
beyond, to a curtained <i>caleche</i>, in which is seen seated a
lady: so fair, as long before to have fixed their attention.</p>

<p>Strange are the glances turned upon her; strange, though not
inexplicable: for it is Louise Poindexter who occupies the
carriage.</p>

<p>Is she there of her own accord&mdash;by her own free will?</p>

<p>So runs the inquiry around, and the whispered reflections that
follow it.</p>

<p>There is not much time allowed them for speculation.  They
have their answer in the crier's voice, heard pronouncing the
name&mdash;</p>

<p>"Louise Poindexter!"</p>

<p>Calhoun has kept his word.</p>

<h2><a id="ch88"></a>CHAPTER EIGHTY EIGHT.<br>

AN UNWILLING WITNESS.</h2>

<p class="first">
BEFORE the monotonous summons has been three times repeated,
the lady is seen descending the steps of her carriage.</p>

<p>Conducted by an officer of the Court, she takes her stand on
the spot set apart for the witnesses.</p>

<p>Without flinching&mdash;apparently without fear&mdash;she
faces towards the Court.</p>

<p>All eyes are upon her: some interrogatively; a few, perhaps,
in scorn: but many in admiration&mdash;that secret approval which
female loveliness exacts, even when allied with guilt!</p>

<p>One regards her with an expression different from the rest: a
look of tenderest passion, dashed with an almost imperceptible
distrust.</p>

<p>It is the prisoner himself.  From him her eyes are averted as
from everybody else.</p>

<p>Only one man she appears to think worthy of her
attention&mdash;he who has just forsaken the stand she occupies.
She looks at Calhoun, her own cousin&mdash;as though with her
eyes she would kill him.</p>

<p>Cowering under the glance, he slinks back, until the crowd
conceals him from her sight.</p>

<p>"Where were you, Miss Poindexter, on the night when your
brother was last seen?"</p>

<p>The question is put by the State counsellor.</p>

<p>"At home,&mdash;in my father's house."</p>

<p>"May I ask, if on that night you went into the garden?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will be good enough to inform the Court at what
hour?"</p>

<p>"At the hour of midnight&mdash;if I rightly remember."</p>

<p>"Were you alone?"</p>

<p>"Not all the time."</p>

<p>"Part of it there was some one with you?"</p>

<p>"There was."</p>

<p>"Judging by your frankness, Miss Poindexter, you will not
refuse to inform the Court who that person was?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"May I ask the name of the individual?"</p>

<p>"There was more than one.  My brother was there."</p>

<p>"But before your brother came upon the ground, was there not
some one else in your company?"</p>

<p>"There was."</p>

<p>"It is <i>his</i> name we wish you to give.  I hope you will
not withhold it."</p>

<p>"Why should I?  You are welcome to know that the gentleman,
who was with me, was Mr Maurice Gerald."</p>

<p>The answer causes surprise, and something more.  There is a
show of scorn, not unmixed with indignation.</p>

<p>There is one on whom it produces a very different
effect&mdash;the prisoner at the bar&mdash;who looks more
triumphant than any of his accusers!</p>

<p>"May I ask if this meeting was accidental, or by
appointment?"</p>

<p>"By appointment."</p>

<p>"It is a delicate question, Miss Poindexter; you will pardon
me for putting it&mdash;in the execution of my duty:&mdash;What
was the nature&mdash;the object I should rather term it&mdash;of
this appointment?"</p>

<p>The witness hesitates to make answer.</p>

<p>Only for an instant.  Braising herself from the stooping
attitude she has hitherto held, and casting a careless glance
upon the faces around her, she replies&mdash;</p>

<p>"Motive, or object, it is all the same.  I have no intention
to conceal it.  I went into the garden to meet the man I
loved&mdash;whom I still love, though he stands before you an
accused criminal!  Now, sir, I hope you are satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Not quite," continues the prosecuting counsel, unmoved by the
murmurs heard around him; "I must ask you another question, Miss
Poindexter. The course I am about to take, though a little
irregular, will save the time of the Court; and I think no one
will object to it.  You have heard what has been said by the
witness who preceded you.  Is it true that your brother parted in
anger with the prisoner at the bar?"</p>

<p>"Quite true."</p>

<p>The answer sends a thrill through the crowd&mdash;a thrill of
indignation. It confirms the story of Calhoun.  It establishes
the <i>motive</i> of the murder!</p>

<p>The bystanders do not wait for the explanation the witness
designs to give.  There is a cry of "Hang&mdash;hang him!" and,
along with it, a demonstration for this to be done without
staying for the verdict of the jury, "Order in the Court!" cries
the judge, taking the cigar from between his teeth, and looking
authoritatively around him.</p>

<p>"My brother did not <i>follow him in anger</i>," pursues the
witness, without being further questioned.  "He had forgiven Mr
Gerald; and went after to apologise."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> have something to say about that," interposes
Calhoun, disregarding the irregularity of the act; "they
quarrelled <i>afterwards</i>.  I heard them, from where I was
standing on the top of the house."</p>

<p>"Mr Calhoun!" cries the judge rebukingly; "if the counsel for
the prosecution desire it, you can be put in the box again.
Meanwhile, sir, you will please not interrupt the
proceedings."</p>

<p>After a few more questions, eliciting answers explanatory of
what she has last alleged, the lady is relieved from her
embarrassing situation.</p>

<p>She goes back to her carriage with a cold heaviness at her
heart: for she has become conscious that, by telling the truth,
she has damaged the cause of him she intended to serve.  Her own
too: for in passing through the crowd she does not fail to
perceive eyes turned upon her, that regard her with an expression
too closely resembling contempt!</p>

<p>The "chivalry" is offended by her condescension; the morality
shocked by her free confession of that midnight meeting; to say
nought of the envy felt for the <i>bonne fortune</i> of him who
has been so daringly endorsed.</p>

<p>Calhoun is once more called to the stand; and by some
additional perjury, strengthens the antipathy already felt for
the accused.  Every word is a lie; but his statements appear too
plausible to be fabrications.</p>

<p>Again breaks forth the clamour of the crowd.  Again is heard
the cry, "Hang!"&mdash;this time more vociferous, more earnest,
than ever.</p>

<p>This time, too, the action is more violent.  Men strip off
their coats, and fling their hats into the air.  The women in the
waggons&mdash;and even those of gentle strain in the
carriages&mdash;seem, to share the frenzied spite against the
prisoner&mdash;all save that one, who sits screened behind the
curtain.</p>

<p>She too shows indignation; but from a different cause.  If she
trembles at the commotion, it is not through fear; but from the
bitter consciousness that she has herself assisted in stirring it
up.  In this dark hour she remembers the significant speech of
Calhoun: that from her own lips were to come the words that would
prove Maurice Gerald a murderer!</p>

<p>The clamour continues, increasing in earnestness.  There are
things said aloud&mdash;insinuations against the
accused&mdash;designed to inflame the passions of the assembly;
and each moment the outcry grows fiercer and more virulent.</p>

<p>Judge Roberts&mdash;the name of him who presides&mdash;is in
peril of being deposed; to be succeeded by the lawless Lynch!</p>

<p>And then what must follow?  For Maurice Gerald no more trial;
no condemnation: for that has been done already.  No shrift
neither; but a quick execution, occupying only the time it will
take half a score of expert rope-men to throw a noose around his
neck, and jerk him up to the limb of the live-oak stretching
horizontally over his head!</p>

<p>This is the thought of almost everybody on the ground, as they
stand waiting for some one to say the word&mdash;some bad, bold
borderer daring enough to take the initiative.</p>

<p>Thanks be to God, the spectators are not <i>all</i> of this
mind.  A few have determined on bringing the affair to a
different finale.</p>

<p>There is a group of men in uniform, seen in excited
consultation.  They are the officers of the Fort, with the
commandant in their midst.</p>

<p>Only for a score of seconds does their council continue.  It
ends with the braying of a bugle.  It is a signal sounded by
command of the major.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant a troop of two-score dragoons, with
a like number of mounted riflemen, is seen filing out from the
stockade enclosure that extends rearward from the Fort.</p>

<p>Having cleared the gateway, they advance over the open ground
in the direction of the live-oak.</p>

<p>Silently, and as though acting under an instinct, they deploy
into an alignment&mdash;forming three sides of a square, that
partially encloses the Court!</p>

<p>The crowd has ceased its clamouring; and stands gazing at a
spectacle, which might be taken for a <i>coup de theatre</i>.</p>

<p>It produces not only silence, but submission: for plainly do
they perceive its design, and that the movement is a
precautionary measure due to the skill of the commanding officer
of the post.</p>

<p>Equally plain is it, that the presidency of Justice Lynch is
no longer possible; and that the law of the land is once more in
the ascendant.</p>

<p>Without further opposition Judge Roberts is permitted to
resume his functions, so rudely interrupted.</p>

<p>"Fellow citizens!" he cries, with a glance towards his
auditory, now more reproachful than appealing, "the law is bound
to take its course&mdash; just the same in Texas as in the
States.  I need not tell you that, since most of you, I reckon,
have seen corn growing on the other side of the Mississippi.
Well, taking this for granted, you wouldn't hang a man without
first hearing what he's got to say for himself?  That would
neither be law, nor justice, but downright murder!"</p>

<p>"And hasn't he done murder?" asks one of the rowdies standing
near Calhoun.  "It's only sarvin' him, as he sarved young
Poindexter."</p>

<p>"There is no certainty about that.  You've not yet heard all
the testimony.  Wait till we've examined the witnesses on the
other side. Crier!" continues he, turning to the official; "call
the witnesses for the defence."</p>

<p>The crier obeys; and Phelim O'Neal is conducted to the
stand.</p>

<p>The story of the <i>ci-devant</i> stable-boy, confusedly told,
full of incongruities&mdash;and in many parts altogether
improbable&mdash;rather injures the chances of his master being
thought innocent.</p>

<p>The San Antonio counsel is but too anxious for his testimony
to be cut short&mdash;having a firmer reliance on the tale to be
told by another.</p>

<p>That other is next announced.</p>

<p>"Zebulon Stump!"</p>

<p>Before the voice of the summoning officer has ceased to
reverberate among the branches of the live-oak, a tall stalwart
specimen of humanity is seen making his way through the
throng&mdash;whom all recognise as Zeb Stump, the most noted
hunter of the Settlement.</p>

<p>Taking three or four strides forward, the backwoodsman comes
to a stand upon the spot set apart for the witnesses.</p>

<p>The sacred volume is presented to him in due form; which,
after repeating the well-known words of the "affidavit," Zeb is
directed to kiss.</p>

<p>He performs this operation with a smack sufficiently sonorous
to be heard to the extreme outside circle of the assemblage.</p>

<p>Despite the solemnity of the scene, there is an audible
tittering, instantly checked by the judge; a little, perhaps, by
Zeb himself, whose glance, cast inquiringly around, seems to
search for some one, that may be seen with a sneer upon his
face.</p>

<p>The character of the man is too well known, for any one to
suppose he might make merry at his expense; and before his
searching glance the crowd resumes, or affects to resume, its
composure.</p>

<p>After a few preliminary questions, Zeb is invited to give his
version of the strange circumstances, which, have been keeping
the Settlement in a state of unwonted agitation.</p>

<p>The spectators prick up their ears, and stand in expectant
silence. There is a general impression that Zeb holds the key to
the whole mystery.</p>

<p>"Wal, Mister Judge!" says he, looking straight in the face of
that cigar-smoking functionary; "I've no objection to tell what I
know 'beout the bizness; but ef it be all the same to yurself, an
the Jewry hyur, I'd preefar that the young fellur shed gie his
varsion fust.  I kud then foller wi' mine, the which mout sartify
and confirm him."</p>

<p>"Of what young fellow do you speak?" inquires the judge.</p>

<p>"The mowstanger thur, in coorse.  Him as stan's 'cused o'
killin' young Peintdexter."</p>

<p>"It would be somewhat irregular," rejoins the
judge&mdash;"After all, our object is to get at the truth.  For
my part, I haven't much faith in old-fashioned forms; and if the
jury don't object, let it be as you say."</p>

<p>The "twelve," speaking through their foreman, profess
themselves of the same way of thinking.  Frontiersmen are not
noted for strict adherence to ceremonious forms; and Zeb's
request is conceded <i>nemine dissentiente</i>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch89"></a>CHAPTER EIGHTY NINE.<br>

THE CONFESSION OF THE ACCUSED.</h2>

<p class="first">
ACTING under the advice of his counsel, the accused prepares
to avail himself of the advantage thus conceded.</p>

<p>Directed by the judge, he stands forward; the sheriff's
officers in charge falling a step or two into the rear.</p>

<p>It is superfluous to say that there is universal silence. Even
the tree crickets, hitherto "chirping" among the leaves of the
live-oak, desist from their shrill stridulation&mdash;as if awed
by the stillness underneath. Every eye is fixed upon the
prisoner; every ear bent to catch the first words of, what may be
termed, his <i>confession</i>.</p>

<p>"Judge, and gentlemen of the jury!" says he, commencing his
speech in true Texan style; "you are good enough to let me speak
for myself; and in availing myself of the privilege, I shall not
long detain you.</p>

<p>"First, have I to say: that, notwithstanding the many
circumstances mentioned during the course of this
trial&mdash;which to you appear not only odd, but
inexplicable&mdash;my story is simple enough; and will explain
some of them.</p>

<p>"Not all of the statements you have heard are true.  Some of
them are false as the lips from which they have fallen."</p>

<p>The speaker's glance, directed upon Cassius Calhoun, causes
the latter to quail, as if standing before the muzzle of a six-
shooter.</p>

<p>"It is true that I met Miss Poindexter, as stated.  That noble
lady, by her own generous confession, has saved me from the sin
of perjuring myself&mdash;which otherwise I might have done.  In
all else I entreat you to believe me.</p>

<p>"It is also true that our interview was a stolen one; and that
it was interrupted by him who is not here to speak to what
occurred after.</p>

<p>"It is true that angry words passed between us, or rather from
him to me: for they were all on his side.</p>

<p>"But it is <i>not</i> true that the quarrel was afterwards
renewed; and the man who has so sworn dared not say it, were I
free to contradict him as he deserves."</p>

<p>Again are the eyes of the accused turned towards Calhoun,
still cowering behind the crowd.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," continues he, "the next meeting between
Henry Poindexter and myself, was one of apology on his part, and
friendship&mdash;I might say affection&mdash;on mine.</p>

<p>"Who could have helped liking him?  As to forgiving him for
the few words he had rashly spoken, I need hardly tell you how
grateful I felt for that reconciliation."</p>

<p>"There was a reconciliation, then?" asks the judge, taking
advantage of a pause in the narration.  "Where did it take
place?"</p>

<p>"About four hundred yards from the spot <i>where the murder
was committed</i>."</p>

<p>The judge starts to his feet.  The jury do the same.  The
spectators, already standing, show signs of a like exciting
surprise.</p>

<p>It is the first time any one has spoken positively of the spot
where the murder was committed; or even that a murder has been
committed at all!</p>

<p>"You mean the place where some blood was found?" doubtingly
interrogates the judge.</p>

<p>"I mean the place where <i>Henry Poindexter was
assassinated</i>."</p>

<p>There is a fresh exhibition of astonishment in the
Court&mdash;expressed in muttered speeches and low exclamations.
One louder than the rest is a groan.  It is given by Woodley
Poindexter; now for the first time made certain he has no longer
a son!  In the heart of the father has still lingered a hope that
his son may be alive: that he might be only missing&mdash;kept
out of the way by accident, illness, Indians, or some other
circumstance.  As yet there has been no positive proof of his
death&mdash;only a thread of circumstantial evidence, and it of
the slightest.</p>

<p>This hope, by the testimony of the accused himself, is no
longer tenable.</p>

<p>"You are sure he is dead, then?" is the question put to the
prisoner by the prosecuting counsel.</p>

<p>"Quite sure," responds the accused.  "Had you seen him as I
did, you would think the interrogatory a very idle one."</p>

<p>"You saw the body?"</p>

<p>"I must take exception to this course of examination,"
interposes the counsel for the accused.  "It is quite
irregular."</p>

<p>"Faith! in an Owld Country court it wouldn't be allowed," adds
the Cis-Atlantic attorney.  "The counsel for the prosecution
wouldn't be permitted to spake, till it came to the cross-
examination."</p>

<p>"That's the law here, too," says the judge, with a severe
gesture towards him who has erred.  "Prisoner at the bar! you can
continue your story.  Your own counsel may ask you what question
he pleases; but nobody else, till you have done.  Go on!  Let us
hear all you have to say."</p>

<p>"I have spoken of a reconciliation," resumes the accused, "and
have told you where it took place.  I must explain how it came to
be there.</p>

<p>"It has been made known to you how we parted&mdash;Miss
Poindexter, her brother, and myself.</p>

<p>"On leaving them I swam across the river; partly because I was
too excited to care how I went off, and partly that I did not
wish <i>him</i> to know how I had got into the garden.  I had my
reasons for that.  I walked on up stream, towards the village. It
was a very warm night&mdash;as may be remembered by many of
you&mdash;and my clothes had got nearly dry by the time I reached
the hotel.</p>

<p>"The house was still open, and the landlord behind his bar;
but as up to that day I had no reason to thank him for any extra
hospitality, and as there was nothing to detain me any longer
under his roof, I took it into my head to set out at once for the
Alamo, and make the journey during the cool hours of the
night.</p>

<p>"I had sent my servant before, and intended to follow in the
morning; but what happened at Casa del Corvo made me desirous of
getting away as soon as possible; and I started off, after
settling my account with Mr Oberdoffer."</p>

<p>"And the money with which you paid him?" asks the State
prosecutor, "where did you get&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I protest against this!" interrupts the counsel for the
accused.</p>

<p>"Bedarrah!" exclaims the Milesian lawyer, looking daggers, or
rather <i>duelling pistols</i>, at the State counsellor; "if yez
were to go on at that rate in a Galway assize, ye'd stand a nate
chance of gettin' conthradicted in a different style
altogether!"</p>

<p>"Silence, gentlemen!" commands the judge, in an authoritative
tone. "Let the accused continue his statement."</p>

<p>"I travelled slowly.  There was no reason for being in a
hurry.  I was in no mood for going to sleep that night; and it
mattered little to me where I should spend it&mdash;on the
prairie, or under the roof of my <i>jacale</i>.  I knew I could
reach the Alamo before daybreak; and that would be as soon as I
desired.</p>

<p>"I never thought of looking behind me.  I had no suspicion
that any one was coming after; until I had got about half a mile
into the chapparal&mdash; where the Rio Grande trace runs through
it.</p>

<p>"Then I heard the stroke of a horse's hoof, that appeared
hurrying up behind.</p>

<p>"I had got round the corner&mdash;where the trace makes a
sharp turn&mdash;and was hindered from seeing the horseman.  But
I could tell that he was coming on at a trot.</p>

<p>"It might be somebody I wouldn't care to encounter?</p>

<p>"That was the reflection I made; though I wasn't much caring
who.  It was more from habit&mdash;by living in the neighbourhood
of the Indians&mdash;that I drew in among the trees, and waited
until the stranger should show himself.</p>

<p>"He did so shortly after.</p>

<p>"You may judge of my surprise when, instead of a stranger, I
saw the man from whom I had so lately parted in anger.  When I
say anger, I don't speak of myself&mdash;only him.</p>

<p>"Was he still in the same temper?  Had he been only restrained
by the presence of his sister from attacking me?  Relieved of
this, had he come after me to demand satisfaction for the injury
he supposed her to have sustained?</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury!  I shall not deny, that this was the
impression on my mind when I saw who it was.</p>

<p>"I was determined there should be no concealment&mdash;no
cowardly shrinking on my part.  I was not conscious of having
committed crime.  True I had met his sister clandestinely; but
that was the fault of others&mdash;not mine&mdash;not hers.  I
loved her with a pure honest passion, and with my whole heart.  I
am not afraid to confess it.  In the same way I love her
still!"</p>

<p>Louise Poindexter, seated in her carriage behind the outer
circle of spectators, is not so distant from the speaker, nor are
the curtains so closely drawn, but that she can hear every word
passing from his lips.</p>

<p>Despite the sadness of her heart, a gleam of joy irradiates
her countenance, as she listens to the daring declaration.</p>

<p>It is but the echo of her own; and the glow that comes quickly
to her cheeks is not shame, but the expression of a proud
triumph.</p>

<p>She makes no attempt to conceal it.  Rather does she appear
ready to spring up from her seat, rush towards the man who is
being tried for the murder of her brother, and with the
<i>abandon</i> that love alone can impart, bid defiance to the
boldest of his accusers!</p>

<p>If the signs of sorrow soon reappear, they are no longer to be
traced to jealousy.  Those sweet ravings are well remembered, and
can now be trusted as truth.  They are confirmed by the
confession of restored reason&mdash;by the avowal of a man who
may be standing on the stoup of death, and can have no earthly
motive for a deception such as that!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch90"></a>CHAPTER NINETY.<br>

A COURT QUICKLY CLEARED.</h2>

<p class="first">
If the last speech has given satisfaction to Louise
Poindexter, there are few who share it with her.  Upon most of
the spectators it has produced an impression of a totally
different character.</p>

<p>It is one of the saddest traits of our ignoble nature; to feel
pain in contemplating a love we cannot share&mdash;more
especially when exhibited in the shape of a grand absorbing
passion.</p>

<p>The thing is not so difficult of explanation.  <i>We</i> know
that he, or she, thus sweetly possessed, can feel no interest in
ourselves.</p>

<p>It is but the old story of self-esteem, stung by the thought
of indifference.</p>

<p>Even some of the spectators unaffected by the charms of the
beautiful Creole, cannot restrain themselves from a certain
feeling of envy; while others more deeply interested feel
chagrined to the heart's core, by what they are pleased to
designate an impudent avowal!</p>

<p>If the story of the accused contains no better proofs of his
innocence it were better untold.  So far, it has but helped his
accusers by exciting the antipathy of those who would have been
otherwise neutral.</p>

<p>Once more there is a murmuring among the men, and a movement
among the rowdies who stand near Calhoun.</p>

<p>Again seems Maurice Gerald in danger of being seized by a
lawless mob, and hanged without farther hearing!</p>

<p>The danger exists only in seeming.  Once more the major
glances significantly towards his well-trained troop; the judge
in an authoritative voice commands "Silence in the Court!" the
clamouring is subdued; and the prisoner is permitted to
proceed.</p>

<p>He continues his recital:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On seeing who it was, I rode out from among the trees, and
reined up before him.</p>

<p>"There was light enough for him to see who I was; and he at
once recognised me.</p>

<p>"Instead of the angry scene I expected&mdash;perhaps had
reason to expect&mdash;I was joyfully surprised by his reception
of me.  His first words were to ask if I would forgive him for
what he had said to me&mdash;at the same time holding out his
hand in the most frank and friendly manner.</p>

<p>"Need I tell you that I took that hand?  Or how heartily I
pressed it? I knew it to be a true one; more than that, I had a
hope it might one day be the hand of a brother.</p>

<p>"It was the last time, but one, I ever grasped it alive.  The
last was shortly after&mdash;when we bade each other good night,
and parted upon the path.  I had no thought it was to be for
ever.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury! you do not wish me to take up your
time with the conversation that occurred between us?  It was upon
matters that have nothing to do with this trial.</p>

<p>"We rode together for a short distance; and then drew up under
the shadow of a tree.</p>

<p>"Cigars were exchanged, and smoked; and there was another
exchange&mdash;the more closely to cement the good understanding
established between us. It consisted of our hats and cloaks.</p>

<p>"It was a whim of the moment suggested by myself&mdash;from a
fashion I had been accustomed to among the Comanches.  I gave
Henry Poindexter my Mexican sombrero and striped
blanket&mdash;taking his cloth cloak and Panama hat.</p>

<p>"We then parted&mdash;he riding away, myself remaining.</p>

<p>"I can give no reason why I stayed upon the spot; unless that
I liked it, from being the scene of our reconciliation&mdash;by
me so little looked for and so much desired.</p>

<p>"I no longer cared for going on to the Alamo that night.  I
was happy enough to stay under the tree; and, dismounting, I
staked out my horse; wrapped myself up in the cloak; and with the
hat upon my head, lay down upon the grass.</p>

<p>"In three seconds I was asleep.</p>

<p>"It was rare for sleep to come on me so readily.  Half an hour
before, and the thing would have been impossible.  I can only
account for the change by the feeling of contentment that was
upon me&mdash;after the unpleasant excitement through which I had
passed.</p>

<p>"My slumbers could not have been very sound; nor were they
long undisturbed.</p>

<p>"I could not have been unconscious for more than two minutes,
when a sound awoke me.  It was the report of a gun.</p>

<p>"I was not quite sure of its being this.  I only fancied that
it was.</p>

<p>"My horse seemed to know better than I.  As I looked up, he
was standing with ears erect, snorting, as if he had been fired
at!</p>

<p>"I sprang to my feet, and stood listening.</p>

<p>"But as I could hear nothing more, and the mustang soon
quieted down, I came to the conclusion that we had both been
mistaken.  The horse had heard the footsteps of some straying
animal; and that which struck upon my ear might have been the
snapping of a branch broken by its passage through the thicket;
or perhaps one of the many mysterious sounds&mdash; mysterious,
because unexplained&mdash;often heard in the recesses of the
chapparal.</p>

<p>"Dismissing the thing from my mind, I again lay down along the
grass; and once more fell asleep.</p>

<p>"This time I was not awakened until the raw air of the morning
began to chill me through the cloak.</p>

<p>"It was not pleasant to stay longer under the tree; and,
recovering my horse, I was about to continue my journey.</p>

<p>"But the shot seemed still ringing in my ears&mdash;even
louder than I had heard it while half asleep!</p>

<p>"It appeared, too, to be in the direction in which Henry
Poindexter had gone.</p>

<p>"Fancy or no fancy, I could not help connecting it with him;
nor yet resist the temptation to go back that way and seek for an
explanation of it.</p>

<p>"I did not go far till I found it.  Oh, Heavens!  What a
sight!</p>

<p>"I saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>The Headless Horseman</i>!" exclaims a voice from the
outer circle of the spectators, causing one and all to turn
suddenly in that direction.</p>

<p>"<i>The Headless Horseman</i>!" respond fifty others, in a
simultaneous shout.</p>

<p>Is it mockery, this seeming contempt of court?</p>

<p>There is no one who takes it in this sense; for by this time
every individual in the assemblage has become acquainted with the
cause of the interruption.  It is the Headless Horseman himself
seen out upon the open plain, in all his fearful shape!</p>

<p>"Yonder he goes&mdash;yonder! yonder!"</p>

<p>"No, he's coming this way!  See!  He's making straight for the
Fort!"</p>

<p>The latest assertion seems the truer; but only for an instant.
As if to contradict it, the strange equestrian makes a sudden
pause upon the prairie, and stands eyeing the crowd gathered
around the tree.</p>

<p>Then, apparently not liking the looks of what is before him,
the horse gives utterance to his dislike with a loud snort,
followed by a still louder neighing.</p>

<p>The intense interest excited by the confession of the accused
is for the time eclipsed.</p>

<p>There is a universal impression that, in the spectral form
thus opportunely presenting itself, will be found the explanation
of all that has occurred.</p>

<p>Three-fourths of the spectators forsake the spot, and rush
towards their horses.  Even the jurymen are not exempt from
taking part in the general <i>debandade</i>, and at least six out
of the twelve go scattering off to join in the chase of the
Headless Horseman.</p>

<p>The latter has paused only for an instant&mdash;just long
enough to scan the crowd of men and horses now moving towards
him.  Then repeating his wild "whigher," he wheels round, and
goes off at full speed&mdash;followed by a thick clump of
shouting pursuers!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch91"></a>CHAPTER NINETY ONE.<br>

A CHASE THROUGH A THICKET.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE chase leads straight across the prairie&mdash;towards the
tract of chapparal, ten miles distant.</p>

<p>Before reaching it, the ruck of riders becomes thinned to a
straggling line&mdash;one after another falling off,&mdash;as
their horses become blown by the long sweltering gallop.</p>

<p>But few get within sight of the thicket; and only two enter
it, in anything like close proximity to the escaping horseman;
who, without making halt, plunges into the timber.</p>

<p>The pursuer nearest him is mounted upon a grey mustang; which
is being urged to its utmost speed by whip, spur, and voice.</p>

<p>The one coming after&mdash;but with a long interval
between&mdash;is a tall man in a slouched hat and blanket coat,
bestriding a rawboned roadster, that no one would suspect to be
capable of such speed.</p>

<p>It is procured not by whip, spur, and voice; but by the more
cruel prompting of a knife-blade held in the rider's hand, and at
intervals silently applied to the animal's spine, just behind the
croup.</p>

<p>The two men, thus leading the chase, are Cassius Calhoun and
Zeb Stump.</p>

<p>The swiftness of the grey mustang has given Calhoun the
advantage; aided by a determination to be in at the
death&mdash;as if some desperate necessity required it.</p>

<p>The old hunter appears equally determined.  Instead of being
contented to proceed at his usual gait, and trusting to his skill
as a tracker, he seems aiming to keep the other in sight&mdash;as
if a like stern necessity was prompting him to do so.</p>

<p>In a short time both have entered the chapparal, and are lost
to the eyes of those riding less resolutely behind.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">ON through the thicket rush the three horsemen;
not in a straight line, but along the lists and cattle
tracks&mdash;now direct, now in sweeping curves, now sharply
zigzagging to avoid the obstructions of the timber.</p>

<p>On go they, regardless of bush or brake&mdash;fearlessly,
buffeted by the sharp spines of the cactus, and the stinging
thorns of the mezquites.</p>

<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="0900261h-images/TheHeadlessHorseman-18.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>The branches snap and crackle, as they cleave their way
between; while the birds, scared by the rude intrusion, fly
screaming to some safer roost.</p>

<p>A brace of black vultures, who have risen with a croak from
their perch upon a scathed branch, soar up into the air. Instinct
tells them, that a pursuit so impetuous can end only in death.
On broad shadowy wings they keep pace with it.</p>

<p>It is now a chase in which the pursued has the advantage of
the pursuers.  He can choose his path; while they have no choice
but to follow him.</p>

<p>Less from having increased the distance, than by the
interposition of the trees, he is soon out of sight of both; as
each is of the other.</p>

<p>No one of the three can see either of the other two; though
all are under the eyes of the vultures.</p>

<p>Out of sight of his pursuers, the advantage of the pursued is
greater than ever.  He is free to keep on at full speed; while
they must submit to the delay of riding along a trail.  He can
still be followed by the sound of his hoofstrokes ahead, and the
swishing of the branches as he breaks through between them; but
for all that the foremost of his two pursuers begins to despair.
At every turning of the track, he appears to have gained
distance; until at length his footfall ceases to be heard.</p>

<p>"Curse the damned thing!" cries Calhoun, with a gesture of
chagrin. "It's going to escape me again!  Not so much matter, if
there were nobody after it but myself.  But there <i>is</i> this
time.  That old hell-hound's coming on through the thicket.  I
saw him as I entered it&mdash; not three hundred yards behind
me.</p>

<p>"Is there no chance of shaking him off?  No.  He's too good a
tracker for that.</p>

<p>"By God! <i>but there is a chance</i>!"</p>

<p>At the profane utterance, the speaker reins up; wrenches his
horse half round; and scans the path over which he has just
passed.</p>

<p>He examines it with the look of one who has conceived a
scheme, and is reconnoitring the <i>terrain</i>, to see if it
will suit.</p>

<p>At the same time, his fingers close nervously around his
rifle, which he manipulates with a feverish impatience.</p>

<p>Still is there irresolution in his looks; and he hesitates
about throwing himself into a fixed attitude.</p>

<p>On reflection the scheme is abandoned.</p>

<p>"It won't do!" he mutters.  "There's too many of them fellows
coming after&mdash;some that can track, too?  They'd find his
carcase, sure,&mdash;maybe hear the shot?</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no.  It won't do!"</p>

<p>He stays a while longer, listening.  There is no sound heard
either before or behind&mdash;only that overhead made by the soft
waving of the vulturine wings.  Strange, the birds should keep
above <i>him</i>!</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;he must be coming on?  Damn the crooked luck, that
the others should be so close after him!  But for that, it would
have been just the time to put an end to his spying on me!  And
so easy, too!"</p>

<p>Not so easy as you think, Cassius Calhoun; and the birds
above&mdash;were they gifted with the power of speech&mdash;could
tell you so.</p>

<p>They see Zeb Stump coming on; but in a fashion to frustrate
any scheme for his assassination.  It is this that hinders him
from being heard.</p>

<p>"I'll be in luck, if he should lose the trail!" reflects
Calhoun, once more turning away.  "In any case, I must keep on
till it's lost to me: else some of those fools may be more
fortunate.</p>

<p>"What a fool <i>I've</i> been in wasting so much time.  If I
don't look sharp, the old hound will be up with me; and then it
would be no use if I did get the chance of a shot.  Hell! that
would be worse than all!"</p>

<p>Freshly spurring the grey mustang, he rides forward&mdash;fast
as the circuitous track will allow him.</p>

<p>Two hundred paces further on, and he again comes to a
halt&mdash;surprise and pleasure simultaneously lighting up his
countenance.</p>

<p>The Headless Horseman is in sight, at less than twenty paces'
distance!</p>

<p>He is not advancing either; but standing among some low bushes
that rise only to the flaps of the saddle.</p>

<p>His horse's head is down.  The animal appears to be browsing
upon the bean-pods of the mezquites.</p>

<p>At first sight, so thinks Calhoun.</p>

<p>His rifle is carried quickly to his shoulder, and as quickly
brought down again.  The horse he intends firing at is no longer
at rest, nor is he browsing upon the beans.  He has become
engaged in a sort of spasmodic struggle&mdash;with his head half
buried among the bushes!</p>

<p>Calhoun sees that it is <i>held</i> there, and by the bridle-
rein,&mdash;that, dragged over the pommel of the saddle, has
become entangled around the stem of a mezquite!</p>

<p>"Caught at last!  Thank God&mdash;thank God!"</p>

<p>He can scarce restrain himself from shout of triumph, as he
spurs forward to the spot.  He is only withheld by the fear of
being heard from behind.</p>

<p>In another instant, he is by the side of the Headless
Horseman&mdash;that spectral shape he has so long vainly
pursued!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch92"></a>CHAPTER NINETY TWO.<br>

A RELUCTANT RETURN.</h2>

<p class="first">
CALHOUN clutches at the trailing bridle.</p>

<p>The horse tries to avoid him, but cannot.  His head is secured
by the tangled rein; and he can only bound about in a circle, of
which his nose is the centre.</p>

<p>The rider takes no heed, nor makes any attempt to elude the
capture; but sits stiff and mute in the saddle, leaving the horse
to continue his "cavortings."</p>

<p>After a brief struggle the animal is secured.</p>

<p>The captor utters an exclamation of joy.</p>

<p>It is suddenly checked, and by a thought.  He has not yet
fully accomplished his purpose.</p>

<p>What is this purpose?</p>

<p>It is a secret known only to himself; and the stealthy glance
cast around tells, that he has no wish to share it with
another.</p>

<p>After scanning the selvedge of the thicket, and listening a
second or two, he resumes action.</p>

<p>A singular action it might appear, to one ignorant of its
object.  He draws his knife from its sheath; clutches a corner of
the serape; raises it above the breast of the Headless rider; and
then bends towards him, as if intending to plunge the blade into
his heart!</p>

<p>The arm is uplifted.  The blow is not likely to be warded
off.</p>

<p>For all that it is not struck.  It is stayed by a shout sent
forth from the chapparal&mdash;by the edge of which a man has
just made his appearance. The man is Zeb Stump.</p>

<p>"Stop that game!" cries the hunter, riding out from the
underwood and advancing rapidly through the low bushes; "stop it,
durn ye!"</p>

<p>"What game?" rejoins the ex-officer with a dismayed look, at
the same time stealthily returning his knife to its sheath. "What
the devil are you talking about?  This brute's got caught by the
bridle.  I was afraid he might get away again.  I was going to
cut his damned throat&mdash;so as to make sure of him."</p>

<p>"Ah, thet's what ye're arter.  Wal, I reck'n thur's no need to
cut the critter's throat.  We kin skewer it 'ithout thet sort o'
bloody bizness. It air the hoss's throat ye mean, I s'pose?"</p>

<p>"Of course I mean the horse."</p>

<p>"In coorse.  As for the man, someb'y's dud thet for him
arready&mdash;<i>if it be a man</i>.  What do <i>you</i> make o'
it, Mister Cash Calhoun?"</p>

<p>"Damned if I know what to make of it.  I haven't had time to
get a good look at it.  I've just this minute come up.  By
heaven!" he continues, feigning a grand surprise, "I believe it's
the body of a man; and dead!"</p>

<p>"Thet last air probibble enuf.  'Tain't likely he'd be alive
wi' no head on his shoulders.  Thar's none under the blanket, is
thar?"</p>

<p>"No; I think not.  There cannot be?"</p>

<p>"Lift it a leetle, an see."</p>

<p>"I don't like touching it.  It's such a cursed queer-looking
thing."</p>

<p>"Durn it, ye wan't so partickler a minnit ago.  What's kim
over ye now?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" stammers Calhoun, "I was excited with chasing it.  I'd
got angry at the damned thing, and was determined to put an end
to its capers."</p>

<p>"Never mind then," interposes Zeb,&mdash;"I'll make a
inspecshun o' it. Ye-es," he continues, riding nearer, and
keeping his eyes fixed upon the strange shape.  "Ye-es, it's the
body o' a man, an no mistake!  Dead as a buck, an stiff as a
hunch o' ven'son in a hard frost!"</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he exclaims, on raising the skirt of the serape,
"it's the body o' the man whose murder's bein' tried&mdash;yur
own cousin&mdash;young Peintdexter!  It is, by the Eturnal
God!"</p>

<p>"I believe you are right.  By heaven it is he!"</p>

<p>"Geehosophat!" proceeds Zeb, after counterfeiting surprise at
the discovery, "this air the mysteeriousest thing o' all.  Wal; I
reck'n thur's no use in our stayin' hyur to spek'late upon it.
Bessest thing we kin do 's to take the body back, jest as it's
sot in the seddle&mdash; which it appears putty firm.  I know the
hoss too; an I reck'n, when he smell my ole maar a bit, he'll kum
along 'ithout much coaxin'.  Gee up, ole gurl! an make yurself
know'd to him.  Thur now!  Don't ye see it's a preevious
acquaintance o' yourn; though sarting the poor critter appears to
hev hed rough usage o' late; an ye mout well be excused for not
reconisin' him.  'Tair some time since he's hed a curry to his
skin."</p>

<p>While the hunter is speaking, the horse bestridden by the dead
body, and the old mare, place their snouts in contact&mdash;then
withdraw them with a sniff of recognition.</p>

<p>"I thort so," exclaims Zeb, taking hold of the strayed bridle,
and detaching it from the mezquite; "the stellyun's boun to lead
quietly enuf&mdash;so long as he's in kumpny with the maar.  'T
all events, 'twon't be needcessary to cut his throat to keep him
from runnin' away.  Now, Mister Calhoun," he continues, glancing
stealthily at the other, to witness the effect produced by his
speeches; "don't ye think we'd better start right away?  The
trial may still be goin' on; an', ef so, we may be wanted to take
a part in it.  I reck'n thet we've got a witness hyur, as 'll do
somethin' torst illoocidatin' the case&mdash;either to the
hangin' the mowstanger, or, what air more likely, clurrin' him
althogither o' the churge.  Wal, air ye riddy to take the back
track?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly.  As you say, there's no reason for our
remaining here."</p>

<p>Zeb moves off first, leading the captive alongside of him. The
latter makes no resistance; but rather seems satisfied at being
conducted in company.</p>

<p>Calhoun rides slowly&mdash;a close observer might say
reluctantly in the rear.</p>

<p>At a point where the path angles abruptly round a clump of
trees, he reins up, and appears to consider whether he should go
on, or gallop back.</p>

<p>His countenance betrays terrible agitation.  Zeb Stump,
admonished by the interrupted footfall, becomes aware that his
travelling companion has stopped.</p>

<p>He pulls up his mare; and facing round, regards the loiterer
with a look of interrogation.</p>

<p>He observes the agitated air, and perfectly comprehends its
cause.</p>

<p>Without saying a word, he lowers his long rifle from its rest
upon his left shoulder; lays it across the hollow of his arm,
ready at an instant's notice to be carried to his cheek.  In this
attitude he sits eyeing the ex-captain of cavalry.  There is no
remark made.  None is needed.  Zeb's gesture is sufficient.  It
plainly says:&mdash;"Go back if ye dare!"</p>

<p>The latter, without appearing to notice it, takes the hint;
and moves silently on.</p>

<p>But no longer is he permitted to ride in the rear.  Without
saying it, the old hunter has grown suspicious, and makes an
excuse for keeping behind&mdash;with which his <i>compagnon du
voyage</i> is compelled to put up.</p>

<p>The cavalcade advances slowly through the chapparal.</p>

<p>It approaches the open prairie.</p>

<p>At length the sky line comes in sight.</p>

<p>Something seen upon the distant horizon appears to impress
Calhoun with a fresh feeling of fear; and, once more reining up,
he sits considering.</p>

<p>Dread is the alternative that occupies his mind.  Shall he
plunge back into the thicket, and hide himself from the eyes of
men?  Or go on and brave the dark storm that is fast gathering
around him?</p>

<p>He would give all he owns in the world&mdash;all that he ever
hopes to own&mdash; even Louise Poindexter herself&mdash;to be
relieved of the hated presence of Zeb Stump&mdash;to be left for
ten minutes alone with the Headless Horseman!</p>

<p>It is not to be.  The sleuth-hound, that has followed him thus
far, seems more than ever inexorable.  Though loth to believe it,
instinct tells him: that the old hunter regards <i>him</i> as the
real captive, and any attempt on his part to steal away, will but
end in his receiving a bullet in the back!</p>

<p>After all, what can Zeb Stump say, or do?  There is no
certainty that the backwoodsman knows anything of the
circumstance that is troubling him?</p>

<p>And after all, there may be nothing to be known?</p>

<p>It is evident that Zeb is suspicious.  But what of that?  Only
the friendless need fear suspicion; and the ex-officer is not one
of these. Unless that little tell-tale be discovered, he has
nothing to fear; and what chance of its being discovered?  One
against ten.  In all likelihood it stayed not where it was sent,
but was lost in the secret recesses of the chapparal?</p>

<p>Influenced by this hope, Calhoun regains courage; and with an
air of indifference, more assumed than real, he rides out into
the open prairie&mdash;close followed by Zeb Stump on his
critter&mdash;the dead body of Henry Poindexter bringing up the
rear!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch93"></a>CHAPTER NINETY THREE.<br>

A BODY BEHEADED.</h2>

<p class="first">
FORSAKEN by two-thirds of its spectators&mdash;abandoned, by
one-half of the jury&mdash;the trial taking place under the tree
is of necessity interrupted.</p>

<p>There is no adjournment of the Court&mdash;only an
interregnum, unavoidable, and therefore tacitly agreed to.</p>

<p>The interlude occupies about an hour; during which the judge
smokes a couple of cigars; takes about twice that number of
drinks from the bottle of peach brandy; chats familiarly with the
counsel, the fragment of a jury, and such spectators as, not
having horses, or not caring to give them a gallop, have stayed
by the tree.</p>

<p>There is no difficulty in finding a subject of conversation.
That is furnished by the incident that has just
transpired&mdash;strange enough to be talked about not only for
an hour, but an age.</p>

<p>The spectators converse of it, while with excited feelings
they await the return of those who have started on the chase.</p>

<p>They are in hopes that the Headless Horseman will be captured.
They believe that his capture will not only supply a clue to the
mystery of his being, but will also throw light on that of the
murder.</p>

<p>There is one among them who could explain the
first&mdash;though ignorant of the last.  The accused could do
this; and will, when called upon to continue his confession.</p>

<p>Under the direction of the judge, and by the advice of his
counsel, he is for the time preserving silence.</p>

<p>After a while the pursuers return; not all together, but in
straggling squads&mdash;as they have despairingly abandoned the
pursuit.</p>

<p>All bring back the same story.  None of them has been near
enough to the Headless rider to add one iota to what is already
known of him.  His entity remains mythical as ever!</p>

<p>It is soon discovered that two who started in the chase have
not reappeared.  They are the old hunter and the ex-captain of
volunteers. The latter has been last seen heading the field, the
former following not far behind him.</p>

<p>No one saw either of them afterward.  Are they still
continuing on? Perhaps they may have been successful?</p>

<p>All eyes turn towards the prairie, and scan it with inquiring
glances. There is an expectation that the missing men may be seen
on their way back&mdash;with a hope that the Headless Horseman
may be along with them.</p>

<p>An hour elapses, and there is no sign of them&mdash;either
with or without the wished-for captive.</p>

<p>Is the trial to be further postponed?</p>

<p>The counsel for the prosecution urges its continuance; while
he for the accused is equally desirous of its being delayed.  The
latter moves an adjournment till to-morrow; his plea the absence
of an important witness in the person of Zeb Stump, who has not
yet been examined.</p>

<p>There are voices that clamour for the case to be
completed.</p>

<p>There are paid <i>claquers</i> in the crowd composing a Texan
Court, as in the pit of a Parisian theatre.  The real tragedy has
its supporters, as well as the sham!</p>

<p>The clamourers succeed in carrying their point.  It is decided
to go on with the trial&mdash;as much of it as can be got through
without the witness who is absent.  He may be back before the
time comes for calling him. If not, the Court can then talk about
adjournment.</p>

<p>So rules the judge; and the jury signify their assent.  The
spectators do the same.</p>

<p>The prisoner is once more directed to stand up, and continue
the confession so unexpectedly interrupted.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">"YOU were about to tell us what you saw,"
proceeds the counsel for the accused, addressing himself to his
client.  "Go on, and complete your statement.  What was it you
saw?"</p>

<p>"A man lying at full length upon the grass."</p>

<p>"Asleep?"</p>

<p>"Yes; in the sleep of death."</p>

<p>"Dead?"</p>

<p>"More than dead; if that were possible.  On bending over him,
I saw that he had been beheaded!"</p>

<p>"What!  His head cut off?"</p>

<p>"Just so.  I did not know it, till I knelt down beside him. He
was upon his face&mdash;with the head in its natural position.
Even the hat was still on it!</p>

<p>"I was in hopes he might be asleep; though I had a
presentiment there was something amiss.  The arms were extended
too stiffly for a sleeping man.  So were the legs.  Besides,
there was something red upon the grass, that in the dim light I
had not at first seen.</p>

<p>"As I stooped low to look at it, I perceived a strange
odour&mdash;the salt smell that proceeds from human blood.</p>

<p>"I no longer doubted that it was a dead body I was bending
over; and I set about examining it.</p>

<p>"I saw there was a gash at the back of the neck, filled with
red, half-coagulated blood.  I saw that the head was severed from
the shoulders!"</p>

<p>A sensation of horror runs through the
auditory&mdash;accompanied by the exclamatory cries heard on such
occasions.</p>

<p>"Did you know the man?"</p>

<p>"Alas! yes."</p>

<p>"Without seeing his face?"</p>

<p>"It did not need that.  The dress told who it was&mdash;too
truly."</p>

<p>"What dress?"</p>

<p>"The striped blanket covering his shoulders and the hat upon
his head. They were my own.  But for the exchange we had made, I
might have fancied it was myself.  It was Henry Poindexter."</p>

<p>A groan is again heard&mdash;rising above the hum of the
excited hearers.</p>

<p>"Proceed, sir!" directs the examining counsel.  "State what
other circumstances came under your observation."</p>

<p>"On touching the body, I found it cold and stiff.  I could see
that it had been dead for some length of time.  The blood was
frozen nearly dry; and had turned black.  At least, so it
appeared in the grey light: for the sun was not yet up.</p>

<p>"I might have mistaken the cause of death, and supposed it to
have been by the <i>beheading</i>.  But, remembering the shot I
had heard in the night, it occurred to me that another wound
would be found somewhere&mdash;in addition to that made by the
knife.</p>

<p>"It proved that I was right.  On turning the body breast
upward, I perceived a hole in the serape; that all around the
place was saturated with blood.</p>

<p>"On lifting it up, and looking underneath, I saw a livid spot
just over the breast-bone.  I could tell that a bullet had
entered there; and as there was no corresponding wound at the
back, I knew it must be still inside the body."</p>

<p>"In your opinion, was the shot sufficient to have caused
death, without the mutilation that, you think, must have been
done afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly it was.  If not instantaneous, in a few
minutes&mdash;perhaps seconds."</p>

<p>"The head was cut off, you say.  Was it quite severed from the
body?"</p>

<p>"Quite; though it was lying close up&mdash;as if neither head
nor body had moved after the dismemberment."</p>

<p>"Was it a clean out&mdash;as if done by a sharp-edged
weapon?"</p>

<p>"It was."</p>

<p>"What sort of weapon would you say?"</p>

<p>"It looked like the cut of a broad axe; but it might have been
done with a bowie-knife; one heavily weighted at the back of the
blade."</p>

<p>"Did you notice whether repeated strokes had been given?  Or
had the severance been effected by a single cut?"</p>

<p>"There might have been more than one.  But there was no
appearance of chopping.  The first cut was a clean slash; and
must have gone nearly, if not quite, through.  It was made from
the back of the neck; and at right angles to the spine.  From
that I knew that the poor fellow must have been down on his face
when the stroke was delivered."</p>

<p>"Had you any suspicion why, or by whom, the foul deed had been
done?"</p>

<p>"Not then, not the slightest.  I was so horrified, I could not
reflect. I could scarce think it real.</p>

<p>"When I became calmer, and saw for certain that a murder had
been committed, I could only account for it by supposing that
there had been Comanches upon the ground, and that, meeting young
Poindexter, they had killed him out of sheer wantonness.</p>

<p>"But then there was his scalp untouched&mdash;even the hat
still upon his head!"</p>

<p>"You changed your mind about its being Indians?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Who did you then think it might be?"</p>

<p>"At the time I did not think of any one.  I had never heard of
Henry Poindexter having an enemy&mdash;either here or elsewhere.
I have since had my suspicions.  I have them now."</p>

<p>"State them."</p>

<p>"I object to the line of examination," interposes the
prosecuting counsel.  "We don't want to be made acquainted with,
the prisoner's suspicions.  Surely it is sufficient if he be
allowed to proceed with his <i>very plausible tale</i>?"</p>

<p>"Let him proceed, then," directs the judge, igniting a fresh
Havannah.</p>

<p>"State how you yourself acted," pursues the examiner.  "What
did you do, after making the observations you have
described?"</p>

<p>"For some time I scarce knew what to do&mdash;I was so
perplexed by what I saw beside me.  I felt convinced that there
had been a murder; and equally so that it had been done by the
shot&mdash;the same I had heard.</p>

<p>"But who could have fired it?  Not Indians.  Of that I felt
sure.</p>

<p>"I thought of some <i>prairie-pirate</i>, who might have
intended plunder. But this was equally improbable.  My Mexican
blanket was worth a hundred dollars.  That would have been taken.
It was not, nor anything else that Poindexter had carried about
him.  Nothing appeared to have been touched.  Even the watch was
still in his waistcoat pocket, with the chain around his neck
glistening through the gore that had spurted over it!</p>

<p>"I came to the conclusion: that the deed must have been done
for the satisfaction of some spite or revenge; and I tried to
remember whether I had ever heard of any one having a quarrel
with young Poindexter, or a grudge against him.</p>

<p>"I never had.</p>

<p>"Besides, why had the head been cut off?</p>

<p>"It was this that filled me with astonishment&mdash;with
horror.</p>

<p>"Without attempting to explain it, I bethought me of what was
best to be done.</p>

<p>"To stay by the dead body could serve no purpose.  To bury it
would have been equally idle.</p>

<p>"Then I thought of galloping back to the Fort, and getting
assistance to carry it to Casa del Corvo.</p>

<p>"But if I left it in the chapparal, the coyotes might discover
it; and both they and the buzzards would be at it before we could
get back. Already the vultures were above&mdash;taking their
early flight.  They appeared to have espied it.</p>

<p>"Mutilated as was the young man's form, I could not think of
leaving it, to be made still more so.  I thought of the tender
eyes that must soon behold it&mdash;in tears."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch94"></a>CHAPTER NINETY FOUR.<br>

THE MYSTERY MADE CLEAR.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE accused pauses in his recital.  No one offers any
observation&mdash; either to interrupt, or hurry him on.</p>

<p>There is a reluctance to disturb the chain of a narrative, all
know to be unfinished; and every link of which has been binding
them to a closer and more earnest attention.</p>

<p>Judge, jury, and spectators remain breathlessly silent; while
their eyes&mdash;many with mouths agape&mdash;are attentively
turned upon the prisoner.</p>

<p>Amidst solemn stillness he is permitted to proceed.</p>

<p>"My next idea was to cover the body with the cloak&mdash;as
well as the serape still around the shoulders.  By so doing it
would be protected from both wolves and buzzards&mdash;at least
till we could get back to fetch it away.</p>

<p>"I had taken off the cloak for this purpose; when a different
plan suggested itself&mdash;one that appeared in every way
better.</p>

<p>"Instead of returning to the Port alone, I should take the
body along with me.  I fancied I could do this, by laying it
across the croup, and lashing it to the saddle with my lazo.</p>

<p>"I led my horse up to the spot, and was preparing to put the
body upon him, when I perceived that there was another horse upon
the ground.  It was that lately ridden by him who was now no
more.</p>

<p>"The animal was near by, browsing upon the grass&mdash;as
tranquilly as if nothing had happened to disturb it.</p>

<p>"As the bridle trailed upon the ground, I had no difficulty in
catching hold of it.  There was more in getting the horse to
stand still&mdash; especially when brought alongside what lay
upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Holding the reins between my teeth, I lifted the body up, and
endeavoured to place it crosswise in the saddle.</p>

<p>"I succeeded in getting it there, but it would not remain.  It
was too stiff to bend over, and there was no way to steady
it.</p>

<p>"Besides, the <i>horse</i> became <i>greatly excited</i>, at
sight of the strange load he was being called upon to carry.</p>

<p>"After several attempts, I saw I could not succeed.</p>

<p>"I was about to give up the idea, when another occurred to
me&mdash;one that promised better.  It was suggested by a
remembrance of something I had read, relating to the Gauchos of
South America.  When one dies, or is killed by accident, in some
remote station of the Pampas, his comrades carry his corpse to
their distant home&mdash;strapped in the saddle, and seated in
the same attitude, as though he were still alive.</p>

<p>"Why should I not do the same with the body of Henry
Poindexter?</p>

<p>"I made the attempt&mdash;first trying to set him on his own
horse.</p>

<p>"But the saddle being a flat one, and the animal still
remaining restive, I did not succeed.</p>

<p>"There was but one other chance of our making the home journey
together: by exchanging horses.</p>

<p>"I knew that my own would not object.  Besides, my Mexican
saddle, with its deep tree, would answer admirably for the
purpose.</p>

<p>"In a short while I had the body in it, seated erect,&mdash;in
the natural position.  Its stiffness, that had obstructed me
before, now served to keep it in its place.  The rigid limbs were
easily drawn into the proper stride; and with the feet inserted
into the stirrups, and the water-guards buckled tightly over the
thighs, there was little chance of the body slipping off.</p>

<p>"To make it thoroughly secure, I cut a length from my lazo;
and, warping it round the waist, fastened one end to the pommel
in front, the other to the cantle behind.</p>

<p>"A separate piece tied to the stirrups, and passing under the
belly of the horse, kept the feet from swinging about.</p>

<p>"The head still remained to be dealt with.  It too must be
taken along.</p>

<p>"On lifting it from the ground, and endeavouring to detach it
from the hat, I found that this could not be done.  It was
swollen to enormous dimensions; and the sombrero adhered to
it&mdash;close as the skin itself.</p>

<p>"Having no fear that they would fall apart, I tied a piece of
string to the buckle of the band; and hung both hat and head over
the horn of the saddle.</p>

<p>"This completed my preparations for the journey.</p>

<p>"I mounted the horse of the murdered man; and, calling upon my
own to follow me&mdash;he was accustomed to do so without
leading&mdash;I started to ride back to the settlement.</p>

<p>"In less than five minutes after, I was knocked out of my
saddle&mdash;and my senses at the same time.</p>

<p>"But for that circumstance I should not be standing
here,&mdash;at all events, not in the unpleasant position I now
hold."</p>

<p>"Knocked out of your saddle!" exclaims the judge.  "How was
that?"</p>

<p>"A simple accident; or rather was it due to my own
carelessness.  On mounting the strange horse I neglected to take
hold of the bridle. Accustomed to guide my own&mdash;often with
only my voice and knees&mdash;I had grown regardless of the
reins.  I did not anticipate an occurrence of the kind that
followed.</p>

<p>"The horse I was on, had only stopped three lengths of itself,
from the place where I had bestridden him, when something caused
him to shy to one side, and break into a gallop.</p>

<p>"I need not say <i>something</i>; for I knew what it was.  He
had looked round, and seen the other coming on behind, with that
strange shape upon his back, that now in the broad light of day
was enough to frighten horse or man.</p>

<p>"I clutched at the bridle; but, before I could lay my hand
upon it, the horse was at his full speed.</p>

<p>"At first I was but little alarmed; indeed not at all.  I
supposed I should soon recover the reins, and bring the runaway
to a stand.</p>

<p>"But I soon found this could not be so easily done.  They had
strayed forward, almost to the animal's ears; and I could not
reach them, without laying myself flat along the neck.</p>

<p>"While endeavouring to secure the bridle, I took no heed of
the direction in which the horse was taking me.  It was only when
I felt a sharp twitching against my cheeks, that I discovered he
had forsaken the open tract, and was carrying me through the
chapparal.</p>

<p>"After that I had no time to make observations&mdash;no chance
even to look after the lost reins.  I was enough occupied in
dodging the branches of the mezquites, that stretched out their
spinous arms as if desiring to drag me from the saddle.</p>

<p>"I managed to steer clear of them, though not without getting
scratches.</p>

<p>"But there was one I could not avoid&mdash;the limb of a large
tree that projected across the path.  It was low down&mdash;on a
level with my breast&mdash; and the brute, shying from something
that had given him a fresh start, shot right under it.</p>

<p>"Where he went afterwards I do not attempt to say.  You all
know that&mdash;I believe, better than I.  I can only tell you,
that, after unhorsing, he left me under the limb, with a lump
upon my forehead and a painful swelling in the knee; neither of
which I knew anything about till two hours afterwards.</p>

<p>"When my senses came back to me, I saw the sun high up in the
heavens, and some scores of turkey buzzards wheeling in circles
above me.  I could tell by the craning of their necks what was
the prey they were expecting.</p>

<p>"The sight of them, as well as my thirst&mdash;that was
beginning to grow painful&mdash;prompted me to move away from the
place.</p>

<p>"On rising to my feet, I discovered that I could not walk.
Worse still, I was scarce able to stand.</p>

<p>"To stay on that spot was to perish&mdash;at least I so
thought at the time.</p>

<p>"Urged by the thought, I exerted all the strength left me, in
an effort to reach water.</p>

<p>"I knew there was a stream near by; and partly by
crawling,&mdash;partly by the help of a rude crutch procured in
the thicket&mdash;I succeeded in reaching it.</p>

<p>"Having satisfied my thirst, I felt refreshed; and soon after
fell asleep.</p>

<p>"I awoke to find myself surrounded by coyotes.</p>

<p>"There were at least two score of them; and although at first
I had no fear&mdash;knowing their cowardly nature&mdash;I was
soon brought to a different way of thinking.</p>

<p>"They saw that I was disabled; and for this reason had
determined upon attacking me.</p>

<p>"After a time they did so&mdash;clustering around and
springing upon me in a simultaneous onslaught.</p>

<p>"I had no weapon but my knife; and it was fortunate I had
that. Altogether unarmed, I must have been torn to pieces, and
devoured.</p>

<p>"With the knife I was able to keep them off, stabbing as many
as I could get a fair stroke at.  Half-a-dozen, I should think,
were killed in this way.</p>

<p>"For all that it would have ended ill for me.  I was becoming
enfeebled by the blood fast pouring from my veins, and must soon
have succumbed, but for an unexpected chance that turned up in my
favour.</p>

<p>"I can scarce call it chance.  I am more satisfied, to think
it was the hand of God."</p>

<p>On pronouncing this speech the young Irishman turns his eyes
towards Heaven, and stands for a time as if reflecting
reverentially.</p>

<p>Solemn silence around tells that the attitude is respected.
The hearts of all, even the rudest of his listeners, seem touched
with the confidence so expressed.</p>

<p>"It showed itself," he continues, "in the shape of an old
comrade&mdash;one ofttimes more faithful than man
himself&mdash;my staghound, Tara.</p>

<p>"The dog had been straying&mdash;perhaps in search of
me&mdash;though I've since heard a different explanation of it,
with which I need not trouble you. At all events, he found me;
and just in time to be my rescuer.</p>

<p>"The coyotes scattered at his approach; and I was saved from a
fearful fate&mdash;I may say, out of the jaws of death.</p>

<p>"I had another spell of sleep, or
unconsciousness&mdash;whichever it may have been.</p>

<p>"On awaking I was able to reflect.  I knew that the dog must
have come from my jacale; which I also knew to be several miles
distant.  He had been taken thither, the day before, by my
servant, Phelim.</p>

<p>"The man should still be there; and I bethought me of sending
him a message&mdash;the staghound to be its bearer.</p>

<p>"I wrote some words on a card, which I chanced to have about
me.</p>

<p>"I was aware that my servant could not read; but on seeing the
card he would recognise it as mine, and seek some one who could
decipher what I had written upon it.</p>

<p>"There would be the more likelihood of his doing so, seeing
that the characters were traced in blood.</p>

<p>"Wrapping the card in a piece of buckskin, to secure it
against being destroyed, I attached it to Tara's neck.</p>

<p>"With some difficulty I succeeded in getting the animal to
leave me. But he did so at length; and, as I had hoped, to go
home to the hut.</p>

<p>"It appears that my message was duly carried; though it was
only yesterday I was made acquainted with the result.</p>

<p>"Shortly after the dog took his departure, I once more fell
asleep&mdash; again awaking to find myself in the presence of an
enemy&mdash;one more terrible than I had yet encountered.</p>

<p>"It was a jaguar.</p>

<p>"A conflict came off between us; but how it ended, or after
what time, I am unable to tell.  I leave that to my brave
rescuer, Zeb Stump; who, I hope, will soon return to give an
account of it&mdash;with much besides that is yet mysterious to
me, as to yourselves.</p>

<p>"All I can remember since then is a series of incongruous
dreams&mdash; painful phantasmagoria&mdash;mingled with pleasant
visions&mdash;ah! some that were celestial&mdash;until the day
before yesterday, when I awoke to find myself the inmate of a
prison&mdash;with a charge of murder hanging over my head!</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the jury!  I have done."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">"<i>SI non vero e ben trovato</i>," is the
reflection of judge, jury, and spectators, as the prisoner
completes his recital.</p>

<p>They may not express it in such well-turned phrase; but they
feel it&mdash; one and all of them.</p>

<p>And not a few believe in the truth, and reject the thought of
contrivance.  The tale is too simple&mdash;too
circumstantial&mdash;to have been contrived, and by a man whose
brain is but just recovered from the confusion of fevered
fancies.</p>

<p>It is altogether improbable he should have concocted such a
story.  So think the majority of those to whom it has been
told.</p>

<p>His confession&mdash;irregular as it may have been&mdash;has
done more for his defence than the most eloquent speech his
counsel could have delivered.</p>

<p>Still it is but his own tale; and other testimony will be
required to clear him.</p>

<p>Where is the witness upon whom so much is supposed to depend.
Where is Zeb Stump?</p>

<p>Five hundred pairs of eyes turn towards the prairie, and scan
the horizon with inquiring gaze.  Five hundred hearts throb with
a mad impatience for the return of the old hunter&mdash;with or
without Cassius Calhoun&mdash;with or without the Headless Horse,
man&mdash;now no longer either myth or mystery, but a natural
phenomenon, explained and comprehended.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to say to that assemblage, that the thing
is an improbability&mdash;much less to pronounce it impossible.
They are Texans of the south-west&mdash;denizens of the high
upland plateau, bordering upon the "Staked Plain," from which
springs the lovely Leona, and where the river of Nuts heads in a
hundred crystal streams.</p>

<p>They are dwellers in a land, where death can scarce be said to
have its successor in decay; where the stag struck down in its
tracks&mdash;or the wild steed succumbing to some hapless
chance&mdash;unless by wild beasts devoured, will, after a time,
bid defiance both to the laws of corruption and the teeth of the
coyote; where the corpse of mortal man himself, left uncoffined
and uncovered, will, in the short period of eight-and-forty
hours, exhibit the signs, and partake of the qualities, of a
mummy freshly exhumed from the catacombs of Egypt!</p>

<p>But few upon the ground who are not acquainted with this
peculiarity of the Texan climate&mdash;that section of it close
to the Sierra Madro&mdash;and more especially among the spurs of
the Llano Estacado.</p>

<p>Should the Headless Horseman be led back under the live oak,
there is not one who will be surprised to see the dead body of
Henry Poindexter scarce showing the incipient signs of
decomposition.  If there be any incredulity about the story just
told them, it is not on this account; and they stand in impatient
expectation, not because they require it to be confirmed.</p>

<p>Their impatience may be traced to a different cause&mdash;a
suspicion, awakened at an early period of the trial, and which,
during its progress, has been gradually growing stronger; until
it has at length assumed almost the shape of a belief.</p>

<p>It is to confirm, or dissipate this, that nearly every man
upon the ground&mdash;every woman as well&mdash;chafes at the
absence of that witness, whose testimony is expected to restore
the accused to his liberty, or consign him to the gallows
tree.</p>

<p>Under such an impression, they stand interrogating the level
line&mdash;where sky and savannah mingle the soft blue of the
sapphire with the vivid green of the emerald.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch95"></a>CHAPTER NINETY FIVE.<br>

THE LAST WITNESS.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE watchful air is kept up for a period of full ten minutes,
and along with it the solemn silence.</p>

<p>The latter is at intervals interrupted by a word or
exclamation&mdash;when some one sees, or fancies, a spot upon the
prairie.  Then there is a buzz of excitement; and men stand on
tiptoe to obtain a better view.</p>

<p>Thrice is the crowd stirred by warnings that have proved
false.  Its patience is becoming exhausted, when a fourth salutes
the ear, spoken in a louder voice and more confident tone.</p>

<p>This time the tale is true.  There are shadows upon the
skyline&mdash;shadows fast assuming shape, substance, and
motion.</p>

<p>A wild shout&mdash;the old Saxon "huzza," swells up among the
branches of the live oak, as the figures of three horsemen
emerging from the film of the sun-parched prairie are seen coming
in the direction of the tree!</p>

<p>Two of them are easily recognised, as Zeb Stump and Cassius
Calhoun. The third still more easily: for far as eye can see,
that fantastic form cannot be mistaken.</p>

<p>The first cry of the crowd, which but signalled the return of
the two men, is followed by another, yet more
significant&mdash;when it is seen that they are accompanied by a
creature, so long the theme of weird thoughts, and strange
conjecturings.</p>

<p>Though its nature is now known, and its cause understood still
is it regarded with feelings akin to awe.</p>

<p>The shout is succeeded by an interregnum of
silence&mdash;unbroken, till the three horsemen have come close
up; and then only by a hum of whisperings, as if the thoughts of
the spectators are too solemn to be spoken aloud.</p>

<p>Many go forward to meet the approaching cortege; and with
wondering gaze accompany it back upon the ground.</p>

<p>The trio of equestrians comes to a halt outside the circle of
spectators; which soon changes centre, closing excitedly around
them.</p>

<p>Two of them dismount; the third remains seated in the
saddle.</p>

<p>Calhoun, leading his horse to one side, becomes commingled
with the crowd.  In the presence of such a companion, he is no
longer thought of. All eyes, as well as thoughts, dwell upon the
Headless Horseman.</p>

<p>Zeb Stump, abandoning the old mare, takes hold of his bridle-
rein, and conducts him under the tree&mdash;into the presence of
the Court.</p>

<p>"Now, judge!" says he, speaking as one who has command of the
situation, "an' you twelve o' the jury! hyur's a witness as air
likely to let a glimp o' daylight into yur dulliberashuns.  What
say ye to examinin' <i>him</i>?"</p>

<p>An exclamation is heard, followed by the words, "O God, it is
he!"  A tall man staggers forward, and stands by the side of the
Headless Horseman.  <i>It is his father</i>!</p>

<p>A cry proceeds from a more distant point&mdash;a scream
suddenly suppressed, as if uttered by a woman before swooning.
<i>It is his sister</i>!</p>

<p>After a time, Woodley Poindexter is led
away&mdash;unresisting,&mdash;apparently unconscious of what is
going on around him.</p>

<p>He is conducted to a carriage drawn up at a distance, and
placed upon a seat beside its only occupant&mdash;his
daughter.</p>

<p>But the carriage keeps its place.  She who commands the check-
string intends to stay there, till the Court has declared its
sentence&mdash;ay, till the hour of execution, if that is to be
the end!</p>

<p>Zeb Stump is officially directed to take his place in the
"witness-box."</p>

<p>By order of the judge, the examination proceeds&mdash;under
direction of the counsel for the accused.</p>

<p>Many formalities are dispensed with.  The old hunter, who has
been already sworn, is simply called to tell what he knows of the
affair; and left to take his own way in the telling it; which he
does in curt phrases&mdash;as if under the belief that such is
required by the technicalities of the law!</p>

<p>After the following fashion does Zeb proceed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fust heerd o' this ugly bizness on the second day arter young
Peint war missin'.  Heerd on it as I war reeturnin' from a
huntin' spell down the river.  Heerd thar wur a suspeeshun 'beout
the mowstanger hevin' kermitted the murder.  Knowd he wan't the
man to do sech; but, to be saterfied, rud out to his shanty to
see him.  He wan't at home, though his man Pheelum war; so
skeeart 'beout one thing an the tother he ked gie no clur account
o' anythin'.</p>

<p>"Wal, whiles we war palaverin', in kim the dog, wi' somethin'
tied roun' his neck&mdash;the which, on bein' 'zamined, proved to
be the mowstanger's curd.  Thur war words on it; wrote in red
ink, which I seed to be blood.</p>

<p>"Them words tolt to whosomedever shed read 'em, whar the young
fellur war to be foun'.</p>

<p>"I went thar, takin' the other two&mdash;thet air Pheelum an
the houn'&mdash;along wi' me.</p>

<p>"We got to the groun' jest in time to save the mowstanger from
hevin' his guts clawed out by one o' them ere spotted
painters&mdash;the Mexikins call tigers&mdash;tho' I've heern the
young fellur hisself gie 'em the name o' Jug-wars.</p>

<p>"I put a bullet through the brute; an thet wur the eend o'
it.</p>

<p>"Wal, we tuk the mowstanger to his shanty.  We hed to toat him
thar on a sort o' streetcher; seein' as he wan't able to make
trades o' hisself. Beside, he wur as much out o' his senses as a
turkey gobber at treadin' time.</p>

<p>"We got him hum; an thur he stayed, till the sarchers kim to
the shanty an foun' him."</p>

<p>The witness makes pause: as if pondering within himself,
whether he should relate the series of extraordinary incidents
that took place during his stay at the jacale.  Would it be for
the benefit of the accused to leave them untold?  He resolves to
be reticent.</p>

<p>This does not suit the counsel for the prosecution, who
proceeds to cross-examine him.</p>

<p>It results in his having to give a full and particular account
of everything that occurred&mdash;up to the time of the prisoner
being taken out of his hands, and incarcerated in the guard-
house.</p>

<p>"Now," says he, as soon as the cross-questioning comes to a
close, "since ye've made me tell all I know 'beout thet part o'
the bizness, thur's somethin' ye haint thought o' askin', an the
which this child's boun' to make a clean breast o'."</p>

<p>"Proceed, Mr Stump!" says he of San Antonio, entrusted with
the direct examination.</p>

<p>"Wal, what I'm goin' to say now haint so much to do wi' the
prisoner at the bar, as wi' a man thet in my opeenyun oughter be
stannin' in his place.  I won't say who thet man air.  I'll tell
ye what I know, an hev foun' out, an then you o' the jury may
reckon it up for yurselves."</p>

<p>The old hunter makes pause, drawing a long breath&mdash;as if
to prepare himself for a full spell of confession.</p>

<p>No one attempts either to interrupt or urge him on.  There is
an impression that he can unravel the mystery of the murder. That
of the Headless Horseman no longer needs unravelling.</p>

<p>"Wal, fellur citizens!" continues Zeb, assuming a changed
style of apostrophe, "arter what I heerd, an more especially what
I seed, I knowd that poor young Peint wur gone under&mdash;struck
down in his tracks&mdash;wiped out o' the world.</p>

<p>"I knowd equally well thet he who did the cowardly deed wan't,
an kedn't be, the mowstanger&mdash;Maurice Gerald.</p>

<p>"Who war it, then?  Thet war the questyun thet bamboozled me,
as it's done the rest o' ye&mdash;them as haint made up thur
minds 'ithout reflekshun.</p>

<p>"Wal; thinkin' as I did that the Irish wur innocent, I bekim
detarmined to diskiver the truth.  I ain't goin' to say thet
appearances wan't agin him.  They wur dog-gonedly agin him.</p>

<p>"For all thet, I wan't goin' to rely on them; an so I tuk
purayra to hev a squint at the sign.</p>

<p>"I knowd thur must be hoss-tracks leadin' to the place, an
hoss tracks goin' from it; an damn 'em! thur wur too many o' 'em,
goin' everywhur&mdash; else the thing mout a been eezy
enough.</p>

<p>"But thar wur one partickler set I'd got a <i>down</i> upon;
an them I detarmined to foller up to the eend o' creashun.</p>

<p>"They war the footmarks o' an Amerikin hoss, hevin' three
shoes to the good, an a fourth wi' a bit broken off the eend o'
it.  This hyur's the eyedentikul piece o' iron!"</p>

<p>The witness draws his hand from the pocket of his blanket
coat, in which it has been some time buried.  In the fingers are
seen the shoe of a horse, only three quarters complete.</p>

<p>He holds it on high&mdash;enough for judge, jury, and
spectators to see what it is.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr Judge," he continues, "an' you o' the jury, the hoss
that carried this shoe went acrosst the purayra the same night
thet the murder war committed.  He went arter the man thet air
murdered, as well as him thet stans thar accused o' it.  He went
right upon the track o' both, an stopped short o' the place whur
the crime wur committed.</p>

<p>"But the man that rud him didn't stop short.  He kep on till
he war clost up to the bloody spot; an it war through him it
arterwards bekim bloody.  It war the third hoss&mdash;him wi' the
broken shoe&mdash;thet carried the murderer!"</p>

<p>"Go on, Mr Stump!" directs the judge.  "Explain what you mean
by this extraordinary statement."</p>

<p>"What I mean, judge, air jest this.  The man I'm speakin' o'
tuk stan' in the thicket, from which stan' he fired the shet thet
killed poor young Peintdexter."</p>

<p>"What man?  Who was it?  His name!  Give his name!"
simultaneously interrogate twenty voices.</p>

<p>"I reckon yu'll find it thar."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Whar!  In thet thur body as sits 'ithout a head, lookin'
dumbly down on ye!</p>

<p>"Ye kin all see," continues the witness, pointing to the
silent shape, "ye kin all see a red patch on the breast o' the
striped blanket. Thur's a hole in the centre o' it.  Ahint that
hole I reck'n thur'll be another, in the young fellur's karkidge.
Thar don't appear any to match it at the back.  Thurfor I
konklude, thet the bullet as did his bizness air still inside o'
him.  S'posin' we strip off his duds, an see!"</p>

<p>There is a tacit consent to this proposition of the witness.
Two or three of the spectators&mdash;Sam Manly one of
them&mdash;step forward; and with due solemnity proceed to remove
the serape.</p>

<p>As at the inauguration of a statue&mdash;whose once living
original has won the right of such commemoration&mdash;the
spectators stand in respectful silence at its uncovering, so
stand they under the Texan tree, while the serape is being raised
from the shoulders of the Headless Horseman.</p>

<p>It is a silence solemn, profound, unbroken even by whispers.
These are heard only after the unrobing is complete, and the dead
body becomes revealed to the gaze of the assemblage.</p>

<p>It is dressed in a blouse of sky-blue
<i>cottonade</i>&mdash;box plaited at the breast, and close
buttoned to the throat.</p>

<p>The limbs are encased in a cloth of the like colour, with a
lighter stripe along the seams.  But only the thighs can be
seen&mdash;the lower extremities being concealed by the "water-
guards" of spotted skin tightly stretched over them.</p>

<p>Around the waist&mdash;twice twined around it&mdash;is a piece
of plaited rope, the strands of horse's hair.  Before and behind,
it is fastened to the projections of the high-peaked saddle.  By
it is the body retained in its upright attitude.  It is further
stayed by a section of the same rope, attached to the stirrups,
and traversing&mdash;surcingle fashion&mdash;under the belly of
the horse.</p>

<p>Everything as the accused has stated&mdash;all except the
head.</p>

<p>Where is this?</p>

<p>The spectators do not stay to inquire.  Guided by the speech
of Zeb Stump, their eyes are directed towards the body, carefully
scrutinising it.</p>

<p>Two bullet holes are seen; one over the region of the heart;
the other piercing the breast-bone just above the abdomen.</p>

<p>It is upon this last that the gaze becomes concentrated: since
around its orifice appears a circle of blood with streams
straying downward. These have saturated the soft
<i>cottonade</i>&mdash;now seemingly desiccated.</p>

<p>The other shot-hole shows no similar signs.  It is a clear
round cut in the cloth&mdash;about big enough for a pea to have
passed through, and scarce discernible at the distance.  There is
no blood stain around it.</p>

<p>"<i>It</i>," says Zeb Stump, pointing to the smaller, "it
signifies nothin'. It's the bullet I fired myself out o' the
gully; the same I've ben tellin' ye o'.  Ye obsarve thar's no
blood abeout it: which prove thet it wur a dead body when it
penetrated.  The other air different.  It wur the shot as settled
him; an ef I ain't dog-gonedly mistaken, ye'll find the bit o'
lead still inside o' the corp.  Suppose ye make a incizyun, an
see!"</p>

<p>The proposal meets with no opposition.  On the contrary, the
judge directs it to be done as Zeb has suggested.</p>

<p>The stays, both fore and back, are unloosed; the water-guards
unbuckled; and the body is lifted out of the saddle.</p>

<p>It feels stark and stiff to those who take part in the
unpacking,&mdash;the arms and limbs as rigid as if they had
become fossilised.  The lightness tells of desiccation: for its
specific gravity scarce exceeds that of a mummy!</p>

<p>With respectful carefulness it is laid at full length along
the grass. The operators stoop silently over it&mdash;Sam Manly
acting as the chief.</p>

<p>Directed by the judge, he makes an incision around the
wound&mdash;that with the circle of extravasated blood.</p>

<p>The dissection is carried through the ribs, to the lungs
underneath.</p>

<p>In the left lobe is discovered the thing searched for.
Something firmer than flesh is touched by the probe&mdash;the
point of a bowie-knife.  It has the feel of a leaden bullet.  It
is one!</p>

<p>It is extracted; rubbed clean of its crimson coating; and
submitted to the examination of the jury.</p>

<p>Despite the abrasion caused by the spirally-grooved bore of
the barrel&mdash; despite an indentation where it came in contact
with a creased rib&mdash; there is still discernible the outlines
of a stamped crescent, and the letters C.C.</p>

<p>Oh! those tell-tale initials!  There are some looking on who
remember to have heard of them before.  Some who can testify to
that boast about a marked bullet&mdash;when the killing of the
jaguar was contested!</p>

<p>He who made that boast has now reason to regret it!</p>

<p>"But where is he?"</p>

<p>The question is beginning to be asked.</p>

<p>"What's your explanation, Mr Stump?" is another question put
by the counsel for the accused.</p>

<p>"Don't need much, I reck'n," is the reply.  "He'd be a
durnationed greenhorn as can't see, clur as the light o' day,
thet young Peint war plugged by thet ere bullet."</p>

<p>"By whom fired, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Wal; thet appear to be eeqully clur.  When a man signs his
name to a message, thar's no chance o' mistakin' who it kums
from.  Thar's only the ineeshuls thur; but they're plain enuf, I
reck'n, an speak for theirselves."</p>

<p>"I see nothing in all this," interposes the prosecuting
counsel. "There's a marked bullet, it is true&mdash;with a symbol
and certain letters, which may, or may not, belong to a gentleman
well known in the Settlement.  For the sake of argument, let us
suppose them to be his&mdash;as also the ball before us.  What of
that?  It wouldn't be the first time that a murder has been
committed&mdash;by one who has first stolen his weapon, and then
used it to accomplish the deed.  It is but a piece of ordinary
cunning&mdash;a common trick.  Who can say that this is not
something of the same sort?"</p>

<p>"Besides," continues the specious pleader, "where is the
motive for a murder such as this would be&mdash;supposing it to
have been committed by the man you are now called upon to
suspect?  Without mentioning names, we all know to whom these
initials belong.  I don't suppose the gentleman will deny that
they are his.  But that signifies nothing: since there is no
other circumstance to connect him in any way with the committal
of the crime."</p>

<p>"Ain't thar though?" asks Stump, who has been impatiently
awaiting the wind up of the lawyer's speech.  "What do ye call
this?"</p>

<p>Zeb, on delivering himself, takes from his tinder-pouch a
piece of paper&mdash;crumpled&mdash;scorched along the
edges&mdash;and blackened as with gunpowder.</p>

<p>"This I foun'," says he, surrendering it to the jury, "stuck
fast on the thorn o' a muskeet tree, whar it hed been blowed out
o' the barrel o' a gun.  It kim out o' the same gun as discharged
thet bullet&mdash;to which it hed served for waddin'.  As this
chile takes it, it's bin the backin' o' a letter.  Thur's a name
on it, which hev a kewrious correspondings wi' the ineeshuls on
the bit o' lead.  The jury kin read the name for tharselves."</p>

<p>The foreman takes the scrap of paper; and, smoothing out the
creases, reads aloud:&mdash;</p>

<p>Captain Cassius Calhoun!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch96"></a>CHAPTER NINETY SIX.<br>

STOLE AWAY!</h2>

<p class="first">
THE announcement of the name produces a vivid impression upon
the Court.</p>

<p>It is accompanied by a cry&mdash;sent up by the spectators,
with a simultaneity that proclaims them animated by a common
sentiment.</p>

<p>It is not a cry of surprise; but one of far different augury.
It has a double meaning, too: at once proclaiming the innocence
of the accused, and the guilt of him who has been the most
zealous amongst the accusers.</p>

<p>Against the latter, the testimony of Zeb Stump has done more
than direct suspicion.  It confirms that already aroused; and
which has been growing stronger, as fact after fact has been
unfolded: until the belief becomes universal: that Maurice Gerald
is not the man who should be on trial for the murder of Henry
Poindexter.</p>

<p>Equally is it believed that Calhoun is the man.  The scrap of
smeared paper has furnished the last link in the chain of
evidence; and, though this is but circumstantial, and the motive
an inconceivable mystery, there is now scarce any one who has a
doubt about the doer of the deed.</p>

<p>After a short time spent in examining the
envelope&mdash;passed from hand to hand among the
jurymen&mdash;the witness who has hinted at having something more
to tell, is directed to continue his narration.</p>

<p>He proceeds to give an account of his suspicions&mdash;those
that originally prompted him to seek for "sign" upon the prairie.
He tells of the shot fired by Calhoun from the copse; of the
chase that succeeded; and the horse trade that came after.  Last
of all, he describes the scene in the chapparal, where the
Headless Horseman has been caught&mdash;giving this latest
episode in all its details, with his own interpretation of
it.</p>

<p>This done, he makes a pause, and stands silent, as if awaiting
the Court to question him.</p>

<p>But the eyes of the auditory are no longer fixed upon him.
They know that his tale is completed; or, if not so, they need no
further testimony to guide their conclusions.</p>

<p>They do not even stay for the deliberations of the Court, now
proceeding to sift the evidence.  Its action is too slow for men
who have seen justice so near being duped&mdash;themselves along
with it; and&mdash;swayed by a bitter reactionary
spirit&mdash;revenge, proceeding from self-reproach&mdash;they
call loudly for a change in the programme.</p>

<p>The Court is assailed with the cries:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let the Irishman go&mdash;he is innocent!  We don't want any
farther evidence.  We're convinced of it.  Let him go free!"</p>

<p>Such is the talk that proceeds from the excited
spectators.</p>

<p>It is followed by other speeches equally earnest:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let Cassius Calhoun be arrested, and put upon his trial! It's
he that's done the deed!  That's why he's shown so bitter against
the other!  If he's innocent, he'll be able to prove it. He shall
have a fair trial; but tried he shall be.  Come, judge; we're
waiting upon you! Order Mr Calhoun to be brought before the
Court.  An innocent man's been there long enough.  Let the guilty
take his place!"</p>

<p>The demand, at first made by some half dozen voices, soon
becomes a clamour, universally endorsed by the assemblage.</p>

<p>The judge dares not refuse compliance with a proposal so
energetically urged: and, despite the informality, Cassius
Calhoun is called upon to come before the Court.</p>

<p>The summons of the crier, thrice loudly pronounced, receives
no response; and all eyes go in search of Calhoun.</p>

<p>There is only one pair that looks in the right
direction&mdash;those of Zeb Stump.</p>

<p>The <i>ci-devant</i> witness is seen suddenly to forsake the
spot on which he has been giving his testimony, and glide towards
his old mare&mdash;still alongside the horse late relieved of his
ghastly rider.</p>

<p>With an agility that surprises every one, the old hunter
springs upon the mare's back, and spurs her from under the
tree.</p>

<p>At the same instant the spectators catch sight of a man,
moving among the horses that stand picketed over the plain.</p>

<p>Though proceeding stealthily, as if to avoid being observed,
he moves at a rapid rate&mdash;making for a particular quarter of
the <i>cavallada</i>.</p>

<p>"'Tis he!  'Tis Calhoun!" cries the voice of one who has
recognised him.</p>

<p>"Trying to steal off!" proclaims another.</p>

<p>"Follow him!" shouts the judge, in a tone of stern command.
"Follow, and bring him back!"</p>

<p>There is no need for the order to be repeated.  Ere the words
are well out, it is in the act of being obeyed&mdash;by scores of
men who rush simultaneously towards their horses.</p>

<p>Before reaching them, Calhoun has reached his&mdash;a grey
mustang, standing on the outskirts of the <i>cavallada</i>.</p>

<p>It is the same he has lately ridden in chase of the Headless
Horseman. The saddle is still upon its back, and the bitt between
its teeth.</p>

<p>From the commotion observable under the tree, and the shouting
that accompanies it, he has become cognisant of that terrible
signal&mdash;the "hue and cry."</p>

<p>Concealment is no longer possible; and, changing from the
stealthy pace to a quick earnest run, he bounds upon the animal's
back.</p>

<p>Giving a wild glance backward, he heads it towards the
prairie&mdash;going off at a gallop.</p>

<p>Fifty horses are soon laid along his track&mdash;their riders
roused to the wildest excitement by some words pronounced at
their parting.</p>

<p>"Bring him back&mdash;dead or alive!" was the solemn
phrase,&mdash;supposed to have been spoken by the major.</p>

<p>No matter by whom.  It needs not the stamp of official warrant
to stimulate the pursuers.  Their horror of the foul deed is
sufficient for this&mdash;coupled with the high respect in which
the victim of it had been held.</p>

<p>Each man spurs onward, as if riding to avenge the death of a
relative&mdash;a brother; as if each was himself eager to become
an instrument in the execution of justice!</p>

<p>Never before has the ex-captain of cavalry been in such danger
of his life; not while charging over the red battle-field of
Buena Vista; not while stretched upon the sanded floor of
Oberdoffer's bar-room, with the muzzle of the mustanger's pistol
pointed at his head!</p>

<p>He knows as much; and, knowing it, spurs on at a fearful
pace&mdash;at intervals casting behind a glance, quick, furtive,
and fierce.</p>

<p>It is not a look of despair.  It has not yet come to this;
though at sight of such a following&mdash;within hearing of their
harsh vengeful cries&mdash;one might wonder he could entertain
the shadow of a hope.</p>

<p>He has.</p>

<p>He knows that he is mounted on a fleet horse, and that there
is a tract of timber before him.</p>

<p>True, it is nearly ten miles distant.  But what signify ten
miles?  He is riding at the rate of twenty to the hour; and in
half an hour he may find shelter in the chapparal?</p>

<p>Is this the thought that sustains him?</p>

<p>It can scarce be.  Concealment in the thicket&mdash;with half
a score of skilled trackers in pursuit&mdash;Zeb Stump at their
head!</p>

<p>No: it cannot be this.  There is no hiding-place for him; and
he knows it.</p>

<p>What, then, hinders him from sinking under despair, and at
once resigning himself to what must be his ultimate destiny?</p>

<p>Is it the mere instinct of the animal, giving way to a blind
unreasoning effort at impossible escape?</p>

<p>Nothing of the kind.  The murderer of Henry Poindexter is not
mad.  In his attempt to elude the justice he now dreads, he is
not trusting to such slender chances as either a quick gallop
across the prairie, or a possible concealment in the timber
beyond.</p>

<p>There is a still farther beyond&mdash;a <i>border</i>.  Upon
this his thoughts are dwelling, and his hopes have become
fixed.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, two <i>borders</i>.  One that separates two
nations termed civilised.  There is a law of extradition between
them.  For all this the red-handed assassin may cheat
justice&mdash;often does&mdash;by an adroit migration from one to
the other&mdash;a mere change of residence and nationality.</p>

<p>But it is not this course Calhoun intends to take.  However
ill observed the statute between Texas and Mexico, he has no
intention to take advantage of its loose observance.  He dreads
to risk such a danger. With the consciousness of his great crime,
he has reason.</p>

<p>Though riding toward the Rio Grande, it is not with the design
of crossing it.  He has bethought him of the <i>other
border</i>&mdash;that beyond which roams the savage
Comanche&mdash;the Ishmaelite of the prairies&mdash;whose hand is
against every man with a white skin; but will be lifted lightly
against him, who has spilled the white man's blood!</p>

<p>In his tent, the murderer may not only find a home, but hope
for hospitality&mdash;perhaps promotion, in the red career of his
adoption!</p>

<p>It is from an understanding of these circumstances, that
Calhoun sees a chance of escape, that support him against
despair; and, though he has started in a direct line for the Rio
Grande, he intends, under cover of the chapparal, to flee towards
the <i>Llano Estacado</i>.</p>

<p>He does not dread the dangers of this frightful desert; nor
any others that may lie before him.  They can be but light
compared with those threatening behind.</p>

<p>He might feel regret at the terrible expatriation forced upon
him&mdash;the loss of wealth, friends, social status, and
civilisation&mdash;more than all, the severance from one too
wildly, wickedly loved&mdash;perhaps never to be seen again!</p>

<br>

<p class="first">BUT he has no time to think even of <i>her</i>.
To his ignoble nature life is dearer than love.  He fancies that
life is still before him; but it is no fancy that tells him,
death is behind&mdash;fast travelling upon his tracks!</p>

<p>The murderer makes haste&mdash;all the haste that can be taken
out of a Mexican mustang&mdash;swift as the steeds of Arabia,
from which it can claim descent.</p>

<p>Ere this the creature should be tired.  Since the morning it
has made more than a score miles&mdash;most of them going at a
gallop.</p>

<p>But it shows no signs of fatigue.  Like all its
race&mdash;tough as terriers&mdash;it will go fifty&mdash;if need
be a hundred&mdash;without staggering in its tracks.</p>

<p>What a stroke of good fortune&mdash;that exchange of horses
with the Mexican maiden!  So reflects its rider.  But for it he
might now be standing under the sombre shadow of the live oak, in
the stern presence of a judge and jury, abetted and urged on to
convict him, by the less scrupulous Lynch and his cohort of
Regulators.</p>

<p>He is no longer in dread of such a destiny.  He begins to
fancy himself clear of all danger.  He glances back over the
plain, and sees his pursuers still far behind him.</p>

<p>He looks forward, and, in the dark line looming above the
bright green of the savannah, descries the chapparal.  He has no
doubt of being able to reach it, and then his chance of escape
will be almost certain.</p>

<p>Even if he should not succeed in concealing himself within the
thicket, who is there to overtake him?  He believes himself to be
mounted on the fastest horse that is making the passage of the
prairie.</p>

<p>Who, then, can come up with him?</p>

<p>He congratulates himself on the <i>chance</i> that has given
him such a steed.  He may ascribe it to the devil.  He cannot
attribute it to God!</p>

<p>And will God permit this red-handed ruffian to escape?  Will
He not stretch forth His almighty arm, and stay the assassin in
his flight?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch97"></a>CHAPTER NINETY SEVEN.<br>

THE CHASE OF THE ASSASSIN.</h2>

<p class="first">
WILL God permit the red-handed ruffian to escape?  Will He not
stretch forth His almighty arm, and stay the assassin in his
flight?</p>

<p>These interrogatories are put by those who have remained under
the tree.</p>

<p>They are answered by an instinct of justice&mdash;the first
negatively, the second in the affirmative.  He will not, and He
will.</p>

<p>The answers are but conjectural; doubtfully so, as Calhoun
goes galloping off; a little less doubtful as Zeb Stump is
descried starting after him; and still less, when a hundred
horsemen&mdash;soldiers and civilians&mdash;spring forward in the
pursuit.</p>

<p>The doubt diminishes as the last of the pursuers is seen
leaving the ground.  All seem to believe that the last at
starting will be first in the chase: for they perceive that it is
Maurice the mustanger mounted on a horse whose fleetness is now
far famed.</p>

<p>The exclamations late ringing through the court have
proclaimed not only a fresh postponement of his trial, but its
indefinite adjournment.  By the consent of the assemblage,
vociferously expressed, or tacitly admitted, he feels that he is
free.</p>

<p>The first use he makes of his liberty is to rush towards the
horse late ridden by the headless rider&mdash;as all
know&mdash;his own.</p>

<p>At his approach the animal recognises its master; proclaims it
by trotting towards him, and giving utterance to a glad
"whigher!"</p>

<p>Despite the long severance, there is scarce time to exchange
congratulations.  A single word passes the lips of the mustanger,
in response to the neigh of recognition; and in the next instant
he is on the back of the blood-bay, with the bridle in his
grasp.</p>

<p>He looks round for a lazo; asks for it appealingly, in speech
directed to the bystanders.</p>

<p>After a little delay one is thrown to him, and he is off.</p>

<p>The spectators stand gazing after.  There is no longer a doubt
as to the result.  The wish, almost universal, has become a
universal belief.  God has decreed that the assassin shall not
escape; but that he will be overtaken, captured, and brought back
before that same tribunal, where he so late stood a too willing
witness!</p>

<p>And the man, so near suffering death through his perjured
testimony, is the instrument chosen to carry out the Divine
decree!</p>

<p>Even the rude Regulators&mdash;with their practical habitudes
of life, but little regarding the idea of Divine
interference&mdash;cannot help having the impression of this
poetical justice.</p>

<p>One and all give way to it, as the red stallion springs off
over the prairie, carrying Maurice Gerald upon his back.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">AFTER his departure, an episode occurs under the
shadow of the live oak. It is not this that hinders it from being
observed; but because every one has turned face towards the
plain, and watches the chase, fast receding from view.</p>

<p>There is one scanning it with a look unlike the others.  A
lady strains her eyes through the curtains of a
<i>caleche</i>&mdash;her glance telling of a thought within
dissimilar to that felt by the common spectators.</p>

<p>It is no mere curiosity that causes her twin breasts to sink
and swell in quick spasmodic breathing.  In her eye, still
showing sadness, there is a gleam of triumph as it follows the
pursuer&mdash;tempered with mercy, as it falls upon the pursued;
while from her lips, slightly parted, escapes the prayer: "<i>God
have mercy on the guilty man</i>!"</p>

<br>

<p class="first">DELAYED a little at mounting&mdash;and more in
procuring the lazo&mdash;Maurice Gerald is the very latest to
leave the ground. On clearing the skirt of the crowd, now
dispersed over the parade, he sees the others far ahead&mdash; a
distance of several hundred yards separating him from the
rearmost.</p>

<p>He thinks nothing of this.  Confident in the qualities of his
steed, he knows he will not long ride in the rear.</p>

<p>And the blood-bay answers his expectations.  As if joyed at
being relieved from his inert load&mdash;to him an incubus
inexplicable&mdash;and inspired by the pressure of his master's
knees, the noble horse springs off over the prairie turf&mdash;in
long sinewy strides, showing that his body still retains its
strength, and his limbs their elasticity.</p>

<p>He soon closes upon the hindmost; overtakes one; then another,
and another, till he has surged far ahead of the "field."</p>

<p>Still on, over the rolling ridges&mdash;across the stream-beds
between&mdash;on, over soft turf, and sharp shingle, till at
length his competitors lose sight of him&mdash;as they have
already done of the grey mustang and its rider.</p>

<p>There is but one of the pursuing party who continues to keep
him in view&mdash;a tall man, mounted upon what might be taken
for the sorriest of steeds&mdash;an old mustang mare.</p>

<p>Her speed tells a different tale; produced though it be by the
strangest of spurs&mdash;the keen blade of a bowie-knife.</p>

<p>It is Zeb Stump who makes use of this quaint, but cruel, means
of persuasion.</p>

<p>Still the old mare cannot keep pace with the magnificent
stallion of the mustanger.  Nor does Zeb expect it.  He but aims
at holding the latter in sight; and in this he is so far
successful.</p>

<p>There is yet another who beholds the blood-bay making his
vigorous bounds.  He beholds him with "beard upon the shoulder."
It is he who is pursued.</p>

<p>Just as he has begun to feel hopeful of escape, Calhoun,
looking back, catches sight of the red stallion; no longer with
that strange shape upon his back, but one as well recognised, and
to him even more terrible.  He perceives it to be Maurice, the
mustanger&mdash;the man he would have devoted&mdash;was so near
devoting&mdash;to the most disgraceful of deaths!</p>

<p>He sees this man coming after&mdash;his own conscience tells
him&mdash;as an avenger!</p>

<p>Is it the hand of God that directs this enemy on his track? He
trembles as he asks himself the question.  From any other pursuer
there might have been a chance of escaping.  There is none from
Maurice Gerald!</p>

<p>A cold shiver runs through the frame of the fugitive.  He
feels as if he were fighting against Fate; and that it is idle to
continue the contest!</p>

<p>He sits despairingly in his saddle; scarce caring to ply the
spur; no longer believing that speed can avail him!</p>

<p>His flight is now merely mechanical&mdash;his mind taking no
part in the performance.</p>

<p>His soul is absorbed with the horror of a dread
death&mdash;not less dread, from his knowing that he deserves
it.</p>

<p>The sight of the chapparal, close at hand, inspires him with a
fresh hope; and, forcing the fatigued horse into a last feeble
effort, he struggles on towards it.</p>

<p>An opening presents itself.  He enters it; and continues his
gallop for a half mile further.</p>

<p>He arrives at a point, where the path turns sharply round some
heavy timber.  Beyond that, he might enter the underwood, and get
out of sight of his pursuer.</p>

<p>He knows the place, but too well.  It has been fatal to him
before.  Is it to prove so again?</p>

<p>It is.  He feels that it is, and rides irresolutely.  He hears
the hoofstroke of the red horse close upon the heels of his own;
and along with it the voice of the avenging rider, summoning him
to stop!</p>

<p>He is too late for turning the corner,&mdash;too late to seek
concealment in the thicket,&mdash;and with a cry he reins up.</p>

<p>It is a cry partly of despair, partly of fierce
defiance&mdash;like the scream of a chased jaguar under bay of
the bloodhounds.</p>

<p>It is accompanied by a gesture; quick followed by a flash, a
puff of white smoke, and a sharp detonation, that tell of the
discharge of a revolver.</p>

<p>But the bullet whistles harmlessly through the air; while in
the opposite direction is heard a hishing sound&mdash;as from the
winding of a sling&mdash;and a long serpent seems to uncoil
itself in the air!</p>

<p>Calhoun sees it through the thinning smoke.  It is darting
straight towards him!</p>

<p>He has no time to draw trigger for a second shot&mdash;no time
even to avoid the lazo's loop.  Before he can do either, he feels
it settling over his shoulders; he hears the dread summons,
"<i>Surrender, you assassin</i>!" he sees the red stallion turn
tail towards him; and, in the next instant, experiences the
sensation of one who has been kicked from a scaffold!</p>

<br>

<br>


<p>Beyond this he feels, hears, and sees nothing more.</p>

<p>He has been jerked out of his saddle; and the shock received
in his collision with the hard turf has knocked the breath out of
his body, as well as the sense out of his soul!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch98"></a>CHAPTER NINETY EIGHT.<br>

NOT DEAD YET.</h2>

<p class="first">
THE assassin lies stretched along the earth&mdash;his arms
embraced by the raw-hide rope&mdash;to all appearance dead.</p>

<p>But his captor does not trust to this.  He believes it to be
only a faint&mdash;it may be a feint&mdash;and to make sure it is
not the latter, he remains in his saddle, keeping his lazo upon
the strain.</p>

<p>The blood-bay, obedient to his will, stands firm as the trunk
of a tree&mdash;ready to rear back, or bound forward, on
receiving the slightest sign.</p>

<p>It is a terrible tableau; though far from being strange in
that region of red-handed strife, that lies along the far-
stretching frontier of Tamaulipas and Texas.</p>

<p>Oft&mdash;too oft&mdash;has the soaring vulture looked down
upon such a scene&mdash; with joy beholding it, as promising a
banquet for its filthy beak!</p>

<p>Even now half a score of these ravenous birds, attracted by
the report of the pistol, are hovering in the air&mdash;their
naked necks elongated in eager anticipation of a feast!</p>

<p>One touch of the spur, on the part of him seated in the
saddle, would give them what they want.</p>

<p>"It would serve the scoundrel right," mutters the mustanger to
himself. "Great God, to think of the crime he has committed!
Killed his own cousin, and then cut off his head!  There can be
no doubt that he has done both; though from what motive, God only
can tell,&mdash;or himself, if he be still alive.</p>

<p>"I have my own thoughts about it.  I know that he loves
<i>her</i>; and it may be that the brother stood in his way.</p>

<p>"But how, and why?  That is the question that requires an
answer. Perhaps it can only be answered by God and himself?"</p>

<p>"Yur mistaken beout thet, young fellur," interposes a voice
breaking in on the soliloquy.  "Thur's one who kin tell the how
and the why, jest as well as eyther o' them ye've made mention
o'; and thet individooal air ole Zeb Stump, at your sarvice.  But
'taint the time to talk o' sech things now; not hyur ain't the
place neythur.  We must take <i>him</i> back unner the live oak,
whar he'll git treated accordin' to his desarvins. Durn his ugly
picter!  It would sarve him right to make it uglier by draggin'
him a spell at the eend o' yur trail-rope.</p>

<p>"Never mind beout that.  We needn't volunteer to be Henry
Peintdexter's 'vengers.  From what they know now, I reck'n that
kin be trusted to the Regulators."</p>

<p>"How are we to get him back?  His horse has galloped
away!"</p>

<p>"No difeequilty beout that, Mister Gerald.  He's only fainted
a bit; or maybe, playin' possum.  In eyther case, I'll soon roust
him.  If he ain't able to make tracks on the hoof he kin go a
hossback, and hyur's the critter as 'll carry him.  I'm sick o'
the seddle myself, an I reck'n the ole gal's a leetle bit sick o'
me&mdash;leestwise o' the spur I've been a prickin' into her.
I've made up my mind to go back on Shanks's maar, an as for
Mister Cash Calhoun, he's welkim to hev my seat for the reeturn
jerney.  Ef he don't stop shammin an sit upright, we kin pack him
acrost the crupper, like a side o' dead buck-meat.  Yo-ho! he
begins to show sign!  He'll soon rekiver his senses&mdash;all
seven o' 'em, I reck'n&mdash;an then he kin mount the maar o'
hisself.</p>

<p>"Yee-up, ole hoss!" continues Zeb, grasping Calhoun by the
collar of his coat, and giving him a vigorous shake.  "Yee-up, I
say; an kum along wi' us!  Ye're wanted.  Thar's somebody
desirin' to have a talk wi' you!"</p>

<p>"Who? where?" inquires the captive, slowly recovering
consciousness, and staring unsteadily around him.  "Who wants
me?"</p>

<p>"Wal; I do for one; an&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! you it is, Zeb Stump! and&mdash;and&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"An' that air's Mister Maurice Gerald the mowstanger.  You've
seed him afore, I reck'n?  He wants ye for two.  Beside, thar's a
good grist o' others as ud like to see ye agin&mdash;back thar by
the Port.  So ye'd best get upon yur legs, an' go along wi'
us."</p>

<p>The wretched man rises to his feet.  In so doing, he discovers
that his arms are encircled by a lazo.</p>

<p>"My horse?" he exclaims, looking inquiringly around.  "Where
is my horse?"</p>

<p>"Ole Nick only knows whar <i>he</i> air by this time.  Like
enuf gone back to the Grand, whar he kim from.  Arter the
gallupin ye've gi'n him, I reck'n he air sick o' the swop; an's
goed off to take a spell o' rest on his native pasters."</p>

<p>Calhoun gazes on the old hunter with something more than
astonishment. The swop!  Even this, too, is known to him!</p>

<p>"Now, then," pursues Zeb, with a gesture of impatience.
"'Twon't do to keep the Court a-waitin'.  Are ye riddy?"</p>

<p>"Ready for what?"</p>

<p>"Fust an foremost, to go back along wi' me an Mister Gerald.
Second an second-most, to stan' yur trial."</p>

<p>"Trial!  I stand trial!"</p>

<p>"You, Mister Cash Calhoun."</p>

<p>"On what charge?"</p>

<p>"The churge o' killin' Henry Peintdexter&mdash;yur own
cousin."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!  A damned slanderous lie; and whoever says
it&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Shet up yur head!" cries Zeb, with an authoritative gesture.
"Ye're only wastin' breath.  Ef this chile ain't mistook about
it, ye'll need all ye've got afore long.  Kum, now! make riddy to
reeturn wi' us!  The judge air awaitin'; the jury air awaitin';
an <i>justice</i> air waitin', too&mdash;in the shape o' three
score Reg'lators."</p>

<p>"I'm not going back," doggedly responds Calhoun.  "By what
authority do you command me?  You have no warrant?"</p>

<p>"Hain't I, though?" interrupts Zeb.  "What d'ye call this?" he
adds, pointing to his rifle.  "Thur's my warrant, by the grace o'
God; an by thet same, this chile air a goin' to execute it.  So
no more o' yur durned palaver: for I ain't the sort to stan' it.
Take yur choice, Mister Cash Calhoun.  Mount thet old maar o'
mine, an kum along quickly; or try the toother dodge, an git
toated like a packidge o' merchandice: for back yur boun' to
go&mdash;I swar it by the Eturnal!"</p>

<p>Calhoun makes no reply.  He glances at Stump&mdash;at
Gerald&mdash;despairingly around him; then stealthily towards a
six-shooter, protruding from the breast-pocket of his
coat&mdash;the counterpart of that shaken out of his hand, as the
rope settled around him.</p>

<p>He makes an effort to reach the pistol&mdash;feeble, because
only half resolved.</p>

<p>He is restrained by the lazo; perhaps more by a movement on
the part of Zeb; who, with a significant gesture, brings his long
gun to the level.</p>

<p>"Quick!" exclaims the hunter.  "Mount, Mister Calhoun!  Thur's
the maar awaitin' for ye.  Inter the seddle, I say!"</p>

<p>Like a puppet worked by the wires of the showman, the ex-
captain of cavalry yields compliance with the commands of the
backwoodsman.  He does so, from a consciousness that there is
death&mdash;certain death&mdash;in disobeying them.</p>

<p>Mechanically he mounts the mare; and, without resistance,
suffers her to be led away from the spot.</p>

<p>Zeb, afoot, strides on in advance.</p>

<p>The mare, at bridle-length, follows upon his tracks.</p>

<p>The mustanger rides reflectingly behind; thinking less of him
held at the end of his lazo, than of her, who by a generous self-
sacrifice, has that day riveted around his heart a golden
chain&mdash;only by death to be undone!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch99"></a>CHAPTER NINETY NINE.<br>

ATTEMPTED MURDER AND SUICIDE.</h2>

<p class="first">
AFTER its second involuntary recess&mdash;less prolonged than
the first&mdash;the Court has once more resumed its functions
under the great evergreen oak.</p>

<p>It is now evening; and the sunbeams, falling aslant, intrude
upon the space canopied by the tree.</p>

<p>From the golden brightness, displayed by them at noon, they
have changed to a lurid red&mdash;as if there was anger in the
sky!</p>

<p>It is but an accident of the atmosphere&mdash;the portent of
an approaching storm.</p>

<p>For all this, it is remarked as singular, that a storm should
be coming at the time: since it symbolises the sentiment of the
spectators, who look on with sullenness in their hearts, and
gloom in their glances.</p>

<p>It would seem as if Heaven's wrath was acting in concert with
the passions of Earth!</p>

<p>Maurice Gerald is no longer the cynosure of those scowling
eyes.  He has been clamorously acquitted, and is henceforth only
one of the witnesses.</p>

<p>In the place late occupied by him another stands.  Cassius
Calhoun is now the prisoner at the bar!</p>

<p>This is the only change observable.</p>

<p>The judge is the same, the jury the same, and the spectators
as before; though with very different feelings in regard to the
criminality of the accused.</p>

<p>His guilt is no longer the question that is being
considered.</p>

<p>It has been established beyond the shadow of a doubt.  The
evidence is already before them; and though entirely
circumstantial&mdash;as in most cases of murder&mdash;the
circumstances form a chain irresistibly conclusive and
complete.</p>

<p>There is but one missing link&mdash;if link it may be
called&mdash;the <i>motive</i>.</p>

<p>The motive both for the murder and the mutilation: for the
testimony of Gerald has been confirmed by a subsequent
examination of the dead body. The surgeon of the cantonment has
pronounced the two distinct, and that Henry Poindexter's death
must have ensued, almost instantaneously after his receiving the
shot.</p>

<p>Why should Cassius Calhoun have killed his own cousin?
<i>Why</i> cut off his head?</p>

<p>No one can answer these questions, save the murderer himself.
No one expects him to do so&mdash;save to his Maker.</p>

<p>Before Him he must soon stand: for a knowledge of the motive
is not deemed essential to his condemnation, and he has been
condemned.</p>

<p>The trial has come to a close; the verdict <i>Guilty</i> has
been given; and the judge, laying aside his Panama hat, is about
to put on the black cap&mdash;that dread emblem of
death&mdash;preparatory to pronouncing the sentence.</p>

<p>In the usual solemn manner the condemned man is invited to
make his final speech; to avail himself, as it were, of the last
forlorn hope for sentence.</p>

<p>He starts at the invitation&mdash;falling, as it does, like a
death-knell upon his ear.</p>

<p>He looks wildly around.  Despairingly: when on the faces that
encircle him he sees not one wearing an expression of
sympathy.</p>

<p>There is not even pity.  All appear to frown upon him.</p>

<p>His confederates&mdash;those payed ruffians who have hitherto
supported him&mdash; are of no use now, and their sympathy of no
consequence.  They have shrunk out of sight&mdash;before the
majesty of the law, and the damning evidence of his guilt.</p>

<p>Despite his social standing&mdash;and the wealth to sustain
it&mdash;he sees himself alone; without friend or sympathiser:
for so stands the assassin in Texas!</p>

<p>His demeanour is completely changed.  In place of that high
haughty air&mdash;oft exhibited in bold brutal bullyism&mdash;he
looks cowed and craven.</p>

<p>And not strange that he should.</p>

<p>He feels that there is no chance of escape; that he is
standing by the side of his coffin&mdash;on the edge of an
Eternity too terrible to contemplate.</p>

<p>To a conscience like his, it cannot be otherwise than
appalling.</p>

<p>All at once a light is seen to flask into his
eyes&mdash;sunken as they are in the midst of two livid circles.
He has the air of one on the eve of making confession.</p>

<p>Is it to be an acknowledgment of guilt?  Is he about to
unburden his conscience of the weight that must be on it?</p>

<p>The spectators, guessing his intention, stand breathlessly
observing him.</p>

<p>There is silence even among the cicadas.</p>

<p>It is broken by the formalised interrogatory of the judge?</p>

<p>"<i>Have you anything to say why sentence of death should not
be pronounced upon you</i>?"</p>

<p>"No!" he replies, "I have not.  The jury has given a just
verdict.  I acknowledge that I have forfeited my life, and
deserve to lose it."</p>

<p>Not during all the day&mdash;despite its many strange
incidents and startling surprises&mdash;have the spectators been
so astonished.  They are confounded beyond the power of speech;
and in silence permit the condemned man to proceed, with what
they now perceive to be his confession.</p>

<p>"It is quite true," continues he, "that I killed Henry
Poindexter&mdash;shot him dead in the chapparal."</p>

<p>The declaration is answered by a cry from the crowd.  It is
altogether involuntary, and expresses horror rather than
indignation.</p>

<p>Alike involuntary is the groan that goes with
it&mdash;proceeding from a single individual, whom all know to be
the father of the murdered man&mdash; once more in their
midst.</p>

<p>Beyond these sounds, soon ceasing, there is nothing to hinder
the confession from being continued.</p>

<p>"I know that I've got to die," proceeds the prisoner, with an
air of seeming recklessness.  "You have decreed it; and I can
tell by your looks you have no intention to change your
minds.</p>

<p>"After what I've confessed, it would be folly in me to expect
pardon; and I don't.  I've been a bad fellow; and no doubt have
done enough to deserve my fate.  But, bad as I may have been, I'm
not vile enough to be sent out of the world, and leave behind me
the horrid imputation of having <i>murdered</i> my own cousin.  I
did take his life, as I've told you. You are all asking why, and
conjecturing about the motive.  There was none."</p>

<p>A new "sensation" makes itself manifest among the spectators.
It partakes of surprise, curiosity, and incredulity.</p>

<p>No one speaks, or in any way attempts interruption.</p>

<p>"You wonder at that.  It's easily explained.  <i>I killed him
by mistake</i>!"</p>

<p>The surprise culminates in a shout; suppressed as the speaker
proceeds.</p>

<p>"Yes, by mistake; and God knows I was sorry enough, on
discovering that I had made it.  I didn't know myself till long
after."</p>

<p>The condemned man looks up, as if in hopes that he has touched
a chord of mercy.  There is no sign of it, on the faces that
surround him&mdash;still solemnly austere.</p>

<p>"I don't deny," continues he; "I needn't&mdash;that I intended
to kill some one.  I did.  Nor am I going to deny who it was.  It
was the cur I <i>see</i> standing before me."</p>

<p>In a glance of concentrated hatred, the speaker rests his eye
upon Gerald; who only answers with a look, so calm as almost to
betray indifference.</p>

<p>"Yes.  I intended to kill <i>him</i>.  I had my reasons.  I'm
not going to say what they were.  It's no use now.</p>

<p>"I thought I <i>had</i> killed him; but, as hell's luck would
have it, the Irish hound had changed cloaks with my cousin.</p>

<p>"You know the rest.  By mistake I fired the shot&mdash;meant
for an enemy, and fatal to a friend.  It was sure enough; and
poor Henry dropped from his horse.  But to make more sure, I drew
out my knife; and the cursed serape still deceiving me, I hacked
off his head."</p>

<p>The "sensation" again expresses itself in shuddering and
shouts&mdash;the latter prolonged into cries of
retribution&mdash;mingled with that murmuring which proclaims a
story told.</p>

<p>There is no more mystery, either about the murder or its
motive; and the prisoner is spared further description of that
fiendish deed, that left the dead body of Henry Poindexter
without a head.</p>

<p>"Now!" cries he, as the shouting subsides, and the spectators
stand glaring upon him, "you know all that's passed; but not
what's to come. There's another scene yet.  You see me standing
on my grave; but I don't go into it, till I've sent <i>him</i> to
<i>his</i>.  I don't, by God!"</p>

<p>There is no need to guess at the meaning of this profane
speech&mdash;the last of Calhoun's life.  Its meaning is made
clear by the act that accompanies it.</p>

<p>While speaking he has kept his right hand under the left
breast of his coat.  Along with the oath it comes forth, holding
a revolver.</p>

<p>The spectators have just time to see the pistol&mdash;as it
glints under the slanting sunbeams&mdash;when two shots are heard
in quick succession.</p>

<p>With a like interval between, two men fall forward upon their
faces; and lie with their heads closely contiguous!</p>

<p>One is Maurice Gerald, the mustanger,&mdash;the other Cassius
Calhoun, ex-captain of volunteer cavalry.</p>

<p>The crowd closes around, believing both to be dead; while
through the stillness that succeeds is heard a female voice, in
those wild plaintive tones that tell of a heart nigh parting in
twain!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch100"></a>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED.<br>

JOY.</h2>

<p class="first">JOY!</p>

<p>There was this under the evergreen oak, when it was discovered
that only the suicide was a success, and the attempt at
assassination a failure. There was this in the heart of Louise
Poindexter, on learning that her lover still lived.</p>

<p>Though saddened by the series of tragedies so quickly
transpiring, she was but human; and, being woman, who can blame
her for giving way to the subdued happiness that succeeded?  Not
I.  Not you, if you speak truly.</p>

<p>The passion that controlled her may not be popular under a
strictly Puritan standard.  Still is it according to the dictates
of Nature&mdash; universal and irresistible&mdash;telling us that
father, mother, sister, and brother, are all to be forsaken for
that love illimitable; on Earth only exceeded&mdash;sometimes
scarce equalled&mdash;by the love of self.</p>

<p>Do not reproach the young Creole, because this passion was
paramount in her soul.  Do not blame her for feeling pleasure
amidst moments that should otherwise have been devoted to
sadness.  Nor, that her happiness was heightened, on learning
from the astonished spectators, how her lover's life had been
preserved&mdash;as it might seem miraculously.</p>

<p>The aim of the assassin had been true enough.  He must have
felt sure of it, before turning the muzzle towards his own
temples, and firing the bullet that had lodged in his brain.
Right over the heart he had hit his intended victim, and through
the heart would the leaden missile have made its way, but that a
<i>gage d'amour</i>&mdash;the gift of her who alone could have
secured it such a place&mdash;turned aside the shot, causing it
to <i>ricochet</i>!</p>

<p>Not harmlessly, however: since it struck one of the spectators
standing too close to the spot.</p>

<p>Not quite harmless, either, was it to him for whom it had been
intended.</p>

<p>The stunning shock&mdash;with the mental and corporeal
excitement&mdash;long sustained&mdash;did not fail to produce its
effect; and the mind of Maurice Gerald once more returned to its
delirious dreaming.</p>

<p>But no longer lay his body in danger&mdash;in the chapparal,
surrounded by wolves, and shadowed by soaring vultures,&mdash;in
a hut, where he was but ill attended&mdash;in a jail, where he
was scarce cared for at all.</p>

<p>When again restored to consciousness, it was to discover that
the fair vision of his dreams was no vision at all, but a lovely
woman&mdash;the loveliest on the Leona, or in all Texas if you
like&mdash;by name Louise Poindexter.</p>

<p>There was now no one to object to her nursing him; not even
her own father.  The spirit of the aristocratic
planter&mdash;steeped in sorrow, and humiliated by
misfortune&mdash;had become purged of its false pride; though it
needed not this to make him willingly acquiesce in an alliance,
which, instead of a "nobody," gave him a nobleman for his son.
Such, in reality, was Sir Maurice Gerald&mdash;erst known as
Maurice the mustanger!</p>

<p>In Texas the title would have counted for little; nor did its
owner care to carry it.  But, by a bit of good fortune&mdash;not
always attendant on an Irish baronetcy&mdash;it carried along
with it an endowment&mdash;ample enough to clear Casa del Corvo
of the mortgage held by the late Cassius Calhoun, and claimed by
his nearest of kin.</p>

<p>This was not Woodley Poindexter: for after Calhoun's death, it
was discovered that the ex-captain had once been a Benedict; and
there was a young scion of his stock&mdash;living in New
Orleans&mdash;who had the legal right to say he was his son!</p>

<p>It mattered not to Maurice Gerald; who, now clear of every
entanglement, became the husband of the fair Creole.</p>

<p>After a visit to his native land&mdash;including the European
tour&mdash;which was also that of his honeymoon&mdash;Sir
Maurice, swayed by his inclinations, once more returned to Texas,
and made Casa del Corvo his permanent home.</p>

<p>The "blue-eyed colleen" of Castle Ballagh must have been a
myth&mdash;having existence only in the erratic fancy of Phelim.
Or it may have been the bud of a young love, blighted ere it
reached blooming&mdash;by absence, oft fatal to such tender
plants of passion?</p>

<p>Whether or no, Louise Poindexter&mdash;Lady Gerald she must
now be called&mdash; during her sojourn in the Emerald Isle saw
nothing to excite her to jealousy.</p>

<p>Only once again did this fell passion take possession of her
spirit; and then only in the shape of a shadow soon to pass
away.</p>

<p>It was one day when her husband came home to the
hacienda&mdash;bearing in his arms the body of a beautiful
woman!</p>

<p>Not yet dead; though the blood streaming from a wound in her
bared bosom showed she had not long to live.</p>

<p>To the question, "Who has done this?" she was only able to
answer, "Diaz&mdash;Diaz!"</p>

<p>It was the last utterance of Isidora Covarubio de los
Llanos!</p>

<p>As the spirit of the unhappy <i>señorita</i> passed into
eternity, along with it went all rancour from that of her more
fortunate rival.  There can be no jealousy of the dead.  That of
Lady Gerald was at rest, and for ever.</p>

<p>It was succeeded by a strong sympathy for the ill-fated
Isidora; whose story she now better comprehended.  She even
assisted her lord in the saddling of his red-bay steed, and
encouraged him in the pursuit of the assassin.</p>

<p>She joyed to see the latter led back at the end of a
lazo&mdash;held in the hand of her husband; and refused to
interfere, when a band of Regulators, called hastily together,
dealt out summary chastisement&mdash;by hanging him to a
tree!</p>

<p>It was not cruelty&mdash;only a crude kind of
justice:&mdash;"an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth."</p>

<p>And what a poor compensation it seemed, to those who had taken
part in exacting it!</p>

<p>As they stood gazing upon the remains of the villain, and his
victim&mdash; the swarth ruffian dangling from the branch above,
and the fair form lying underneath&mdash;the hearts of the Texans
were touched&mdash;as perhaps they had never been before.</p>

<p>There was a strange thought passing through their minds; a
sadness independent of that caused by the spectacle of a murder.
It was regret at having so hastily despatched the assassin!</p>

<p>Beautiful, even in death, was Isidora.  Such features as she
possessed, owe not everything to the light of life.  That
voluptuous shape&mdash;the true form divine&mdash;may be admired
in the cold statue.</p>

<p>Men stood gazing upon her dead body&mdash;long
gazing&mdash;loth to go away&mdash;at length going with thoughts
not altogether sacred!</p>

<br>

<p class="first">IN the physical world Time is accounted the
destroyer; though in the moral, it is oft the restorer.  Nowhere
has it effected greater changes than in Texas&mdash;during the
last decade&mdash;and especially in the settlements of the Nueces
and Leona.</p>

<p>Plantations have sprung up, where late the <i>chapparal</i>
thickly covered the earth; and cities stand, where the wild steed
once roamed over a pathless prairie.</p>

<p>There are new names for men, places, and things.</p>

<p>For all this, there are those who could conduct you to an
ancient hacienda&mdash;still known as Casa del Corvo.</p>

<p>Once there, you would become the recipient of a hospitality,
unequalled in European lands.</p>

<p>You would have for your host one of the handsomest men in
Texas; for your hostess one of its most beautiful
women&mdash;both still this side of middle life.</p>

<p>Residing under their roof you would find an old gentleman, of
aristocratic air and venerable aspect&mdash;withal chatty and
cheerful&mdash;who would conduct you around the <i>corrales</i>,
show you the stock, and never tire of talking about the
hundreds&mdash;ay thousands&mdash;of horses and horned cattle,
seen roaming over the pastures of the plantation.</p>

<p>You would find this old gentleman very proud upon many points:
but more especially of his beautiful daughter&mdash;the mistress
of the mansion&mdash;and the half-dozen pretty prattlers who
cling to his skirts, and call him their "dear grandpa."</p>

<p>Leaving him for a time, you would come in contact with two
other individuals attached to the establishment.</p>

<p>One is the <i>groom</i> of the "stole,"&mdash;by name Phelim
O'Neal&mdash;who has full charge of the horses.  The other a
coachman of sable skin, yclept Pluto Poindexter; who would scorn
to look at a horse except when perched upon the "box," and after
having the "ribbons" deftly delivered into his hands.</p>

<p>Since we last saw him, the gay Pluto has become tamed down to
a staid and sober Benedict&mdash;black though he be.</p>

<p>Florinda&mdash;now the better half of his life&mdash;has
effected the transformation.</p>

<p>There is one other name known at Casa del Corvo, with which
you cannot fail to become acquainted.  You will hear it
mentioned, almost every time you sit down to dinner: for you will
be told that the turkey at the head of the table, or the venison
at its opposite end, is the produce of a rifle that rarely misses
its aim.</p>

<p>During the course of the meal&mdash;but much more over the
wine&mdash;you will hear talk of "Zeb Stump the hunter."</p>

<p>You may not often see him.  He will be gone from the hacienda,
before you are out of your bed; and back only after you have
retired.  But the huge gobbler seen in the "smoke-house," and the
haunch of venison hanging by its side, are evidence he has been
there.</p>

<p>While sojourning at Casa del Corvo, you may get hints of a
strange story connected with the place&mdash;now almost reduced
to a legend.</p>

<p>The domestics will tell it you, but only in whispers: since
they know that it is a theme <i>tabooed</i> by the master and
mistress of the mansion, in whom it excites sad souvenirs.</p>

<p>It is the story of the</p>
