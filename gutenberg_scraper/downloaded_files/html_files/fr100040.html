<h2><a name="part_1" id="part_1">THE MUCKER</a></h2>

<h2><a name="chapa1" id="chapa1">I. &mdash; BILLY BYRNE</a></h2>

<p class="first">Billy Byrne was a product of the streets and
alleys of Chicago's great West Side. From Halsted to Robey, and
from Grand Avenue to Lake Street there was scarce a bartender whom
Billy knew not by his first name. And, in proportion to their
number which was considerably less, he knew the patrolmen and plain
clothes men equally as well, but not so pleasantly.</p>

<p>His kindergarten education had commenced in an alley back of a
feed-store. Here a gang of older boys and men were wont to
congregate at such times as they had naught else to occupy their
time, and as the bridewell was the only place in which they ever
held a job for more than a day or two, they had considerable time
to devote to congregating.</p>

<p>They were pickpockets and second-story men, made and in the
making, and all were muckers, ready to insult the first woman who
passed, or pick a quarrel with any stranger who did not appear too
burly. By night they plied their real vocations. By day they sat in
the alley behind the feedstore and drank beer from a battered tin
pail.</p>

<p>The question of labor involved in transporting the pail, empty,
to the saloon across the street, and returning it, full, to the
alley back of the feed-store was solved by the presence of admiring
and envious little boys of the neighborhood who hung, wide-eyed and
thrilled, about these heroes of their childish lives.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne, at six, was rushing the can for this noble band,
and incidentally picking up his knowledge of life and the rudiments
of his education. He gloried in the fact that he was personally
acquainted with "Eddie" Welch, and that with his own ears he had
heard "Eddie" tell the gang how he stuck up a guy on West Lake
Street within fifty yards of the Twenty-eighth Precinct Police
Station.</p>

<p>The kindergarten period lasted until Billy was ten; then he
commenced "swiping" brass faucets from vacant buildings and selling
them to a fence who ran a junkshop on Lincoln Street near
Kinzie.</p>

<p>From this man he obtained the hint that graduated him to a
higher grade, so that at twelve he was robbing freight cars in the
yards along Kinzie Street, and it was about this same time that he
commenced to find pleasure in the feel of his fist against the jaw
of a fellow-man.</p>

<p>He had had his boyish scraps with his fellows off and on ever
since he could remember; but his first real fight came when he was
twelve. He had had an altercation with an erstwhile pal over the
division of the returns from some freight-car booty. The gang was
all present, and as words quickly gave place to blows, as they have
a habit of doing in certain sections of the West Side, the men and
boys formed a rough ring about the contestants.</p>

<p>The battle was a long one. The two were rolling about in the
dust of the alley quite as often as they were upon their feet
exchanging blows. There was nothing fair, nor decent, nor
scientific about their methods. They gouged and bit and tore. They
used knees and elbows and feet, and but for the timely presence of
a brickbat beneath his fingers at the psychological moment Billy
Byrne would have gone down to humiliating defeat. As it was the
other boy went down, and for a week Billy remained hidden by one of
the gang pending the report from the hospital.</p>

<p>When word came that the patient would live, Billy felt an
immense load lifted from his shoulders, for he dreaded arrest and
experience with the law that he had learned from childhood to
deride and hate. Of course there was the loss of prestige that
would naturally have accrued to him could he have been pointed out
as the "guy that croaked Sheehan"; but there is always a fly in the
ointment, and Billy only sighed and came out of his temporary
retirement.</p>

<p>That battle started Billy to thinking, and the result of that
mental activity was a determination to learn to handle his mitts
scientifically&mdash;people of the West Side do not have hands;
they are equipped by Nature with mitts and dukes. A few have paws
and flippers.</p>

<p>He had no opportunity to realize his new dream for several
years; but when he was about seventeen a neighbor's son surprised
his little world by suddenly developing from an unknown teamster
into a locally famous light-weight.</p>

<p>The young man never had been affiliated with the gang, as his
escutcheon was defiled with a record of steady employment. So Billy
had known nothing of the sparring lessons his young neighbor had
taken, or of the work he had done at the down-town gymnasium of
Larry Hilmore.</p>

<p>Now it happened that while the new light-weight was unknown to
the charmed circle of the gang, Billy knew him fairly well by
reason of the proximity of their respective parental back yards,
and so when the glamour of pugilistic success haloed the young man
Billy lost no time in basking in the light of reflected glory.</p>

<p>He saw much of his new hero all the following winter. He
accompanied him to many mills, and on one glorious occasion
occupied a position in the coming champion's corner. When the prize
fighter toured, Billy continued to hang around Hilmore's place,
running errands and doing odd jobs, the while he picked up
pugilistic lore, and absorbed the spirit of the game along with the
rudiments and finer points of its science, almost unconsciously.
Then his ambition changed. Once he had longed to shine as a gunman;
now he was determined to become a prize fighter; but the old gang
still saw much of him, and he was a familiar figure about the
saloon corners along Grand Avenue and Lake Street.</p>

<p>During this period Billy neglected the box cars on Kinzie
Street, partially because he felt that he was fitted for more
dignified employment, and as well for the fact that the railroad
company had doubled the number of watchmen in the yards; but there
were times when he felt the old yearning for excitement and
adventure. These times were usually coincident with an acute
financial depression in Billy's change pocket, and then he would
fare forth in the still watches of the night, with a couple of boon
companions and roll a souse, or stick up a saloon.</p>

<p>It was upon an occasion of this nature that an event occurred
which was fated later to change the entire course of Billy Byrne's
life. Upon the West Side the older gangs are jealous of the
sanctity of their own territory. Outsiders do not trespass with
impunity. From Halsted to Robey, and from Lake to Grand lay the
broad hunting preserve of Kelly's gang, to which Billy had been
almost born, one might say. Kelly owned the feed-store back of
which the gang had loafed for years, and though himself a
respectable businessman his name had been attached to the pack of
hoodlums who held forth at his back door as the easiest means of
locating and identifying its motley members.</p>

<p>The police and citizenry of this great territory were the
natural enemies and prey of Kelly's gang, but as the kings of old
protected the deer of their great forests from poachers, so Kelly's
gang felt it incumbent upon them to safeguard the lives and
property which they considered theirs by divine right. It is
doubtful that they thought of the matter in just this way, but the
effect was the same.</p>

<p>And so it was that as Billy Byrne wended homeward alone in the
wee hours of the morning after emptying the cash drawer of old
Schneider's saloon and locking the weeping Schneider in his own ice
box, he was deeply grieved and angered to see three rank outsiders
from Twelfth Street beating Patrolman Stanley Lasky with his own
baton, the while they simultaneously strove to kick in his ribs
with their heavy boots.</p>

<p>Now Lasky was no friend of Billy Byrne; but the officer had been
born and raised in the district and was attached to the
Twenty-eighth Precinct Station on Lake Street near Ashland Avenue,
and so was part and parcel of the natural possession of the gang.
Billy felt that it was entirely ethical to beat up a cop, provided
you confined your efforts to those of your own district; but for a
bunch of yaps from south of Twelfth Street to attempt to pull off
any such coarse work in <i>his</i> bailiwick&mdash;why it was
unthinkable.</p>

<p>A hero and rescuer of lesser experience than Billy Byrne would
have rushed melodramatically into the midst of the fray, and in all
probability have had his face pushed completely through the back of
his head, for the guys from Twelfth Street were not of the
rah-rah-boy type of hoodlum&mdash;they were bad men, with an upper
case B. So Billy crept stealthily along in the shadows until he was
quite close to them, and behind them. On the way he had gathered up
a cute little granite paving block, than which there is nothing in
the world harder, not even a Twelfth Street skull. He was quite
close now to one of the men&mdash;he who was wielding the officer's
club to such excellent disadvantage to the officer&mdash;and then
he raised the paving block only to lower it silently and suddenly
upon the back of that unsuspecting head&mdash;"and then there were
two."</p>

<p>Before the man's companions realized what had happened Billy had
possessed himself of the fallen club and struck one of them a
blinding, staggering blow across the eyes. Then number three pulled
his gun and fired point-blank at Billy. The bullet tore through the
mucker's left shoulder. It would have sent a more highly organized
and nervously inclined man to the pavement; but Billy was neither
highly organized nor nervously inclined, so that about the only
immediate effect it had upon him was to make him mad&mdash;before
he had been but peeved&mdash;peeved at the rank crust that had
permitted these cheap-skates from south of Twelfth Street to work
his territory.</p>

<p>Thoroughly aroused, Billy was a wonder. From a long line of
burly ancestors he had inherited the physique of a prize bull. From
earliest childhood he had fought, always unfairly, so that he knew
all the tricks of street fighting. During the past year there had
been added to Billy's natural fighting ability and instinct a
knowledge of the scientific end of the sport. The result was
something appalling&mdash;to the gink from Twelfth Street.</p>

<p>Before he knew whether his shot had killed Billy his gun had
been wrenched from his hand and flung across the street; he was
down on the granite with a hand as hard as the paving block
scrambling his facial attractions beyond hope of recall.</p>

<p>By this time Patrolman Lasky had staggered to his feet, and most
opportunely at that, for the man whom Billy had dazed with the club
was recovering. Lasky promptly put him to sleep with the butt of
the gun that he had been unable to draw when first attacked, then
he turned to assist Billy. But it was not Billy who needed
assistance&mdash;it was the gentleman from Bohemia. With difficulty
Lasky dragged Billy from his prey.</p>

<p>"Leave enough of him for the inquest," pleaded Lasky.</p>

<p>When the wagon arrived Billy had disappeared, but Lasky had
recognized him and thereafter the two had nodded pleasantly to each
other upon such occasions as they chanced to meet upon the
street.</p>

<p><br>
TWO years elapsed before the event transpired which proved a
crisis in Billy's life. During this period his existence had been
much the same as before. He had collected what was coming to him
from careless and less muscular citizens. He had helped to stick up
a half-dozen saloons. He had robbed the night men in two elevated
stations, and for a while had been upon the pay-roll of a certain
union and done strong arm work in all parts of the city for
twenty-five dollars a week.</p>

<p>By day he was a general utility man about Larry Hilmore's boxing
academy, and time and time again Hilmore urged him to quit drinking
and live straight, for he saw in the young giant the makings of a
great heavy-weight; but Billy couldn't leave the booze alone, and
so the best that he got was an occasional five spot for appearing
in preliminary bouts with third- and fourth-rate heavies and
has-beens; but during the three years that he had hung about
Hilmore's he had acquired an enviable knowledge of the manly art of
self-defense.</p>

<p>On the night that things really began to happen in the life of
Billy Byrne that estimable gentleman was lolling in front of a
saloon at the corner of Lake and Robey. The dips that congregated
nightly there under the protection of the powerful politician who
owned the place were commencing to assemble. Billy knew them all,
and nodded to them as they passed him. He noted surprise in the
faces of several as they saw him standing there. He wondered what
it was all about, and determined to ask the next man who evinced
even mute wonderment at his presence what was eating him.</p>

<p>Then Billy saw a harness bull strolling toward him from the
east. It was Lasky. When Lasky saw Billy he too opened his eyes in
surprise, and when he came quite close to the mucker he whispered
something to him, though he kept his eyes straight ahead as though he had not seen Billy at all.</p>

<p>In deference to the whispered request Billy presently strolled
around the corner toward Walnut Street, but at the alley back of
the saloon he turned suddenly in. A hundred yards up the alley he
found Lasky in the shadow of a telephone pole.</p>

<p>"Wotinell are you doin' around here?" asked the patrolman.
"Didn't you know that Sheehan had peached?"</p>

<p>Two nights before old man Schneider, goaded to desperation by
the repeated raids upon his cash drawer, had shown fight when he
again had been invited to elevate his hands, and the holdup men had
shot him through the heart. Sheehan had been arrested on
suspicion.</p>

<p>Billy had not been with Sheehan that night. As a matter of fact
he never had trained with him, for, since the boyish battle that
the two had waged, there had always been ill feeling between them;
but with Lasky's words Billy knew what had happened.</p>

<p>"Sheehan says I done it, eh?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"That's what he says."</p>

<p>"I wasn't within a mile of Schneider's that night," protested
Billy.</p>

<p>"The Lieut thinks different," said Lasky. "He'd be only too glad
to soak you; for you've always been too slick to get nicked before.
Orders is out to get you, and if I were you I'd beat it and beat it
quick. I don't have to tell you why I'm handing you this, but it's
all I can do for you. Now take my advice and make yourself scarce,
though you'll have to go some to make your get-away now&mdash;every
man on the force has your description by this time."</p>

<p>Billy turned without a word and walked east in the alley toward
Lincoln Street. Lasky returned to Robey Street. In Lincoln Street
Billy walked north to Kinzie. Here he entered the railroad yards.
An hour later he was bumping out of town toward the West on a fast
freight. Three weeks later he found himself in San Francisco. He
had no money, but the methods that had so often replenished his
depleted exchequer at home he felt would serve the same purpose
here.</p>

<p>Being unfamiliar with San Francisco, Billy did not know where
best to work, but when by accident he stumbled upon a street where
there were many saloons whose patrons were obviously seafaring men
Billy was distinctly elated. What could be better for his purpose
than a drunken sailor?</p>

<p>He entered one of the saloons and stood watching a game of
cards, or thus he seemed to be occupied. As a matter of fact his
eyes were constantly upon the alert, roving, about the room to
wherever a man was in the act of paying for a round of drinks that
a fat wallet might be located.</p>

<p>Presently one that filled him with longing rewarded his careful
watch. The man was sitting at a table a short distance from Billy.
Two other men were with him. As he paid the waiter from a
well-filled pocketbook he looked up to meet Billy's eyes upon
him.</p>

<p>With a drunken smile he beckoned to the mucker to join them.
Billy felt that Fate was overkind to him, and he lost no time in
heeding her call. A moment later he was sitting at the table with
the three sailors, and had ordered a drop of red-eye.</p>

<p>The stranger was very lavish in his entertainment. He scarcely
waited for Billy to drain one glass before he ordered another, and
once after Billy had left the table for a moment he found a fresh
drink awaiting him when he returned&mdash;his host had already
poured it for him.</p>

<p>It was this last drink that did the business.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa2" id="chapa2">II. &mdash; SHANGHAIED</a></h2>

<p class="first">When Billy opened his eyes again he could not
recall, for the instant, very much of his recent past. At last he
remembered with painful regret the drunken sailor it had been his
intention to roll. He felt deeply chagrined that his rightful prey
should have escaped him. He couldn't understand how it had
happened.</p>

<p>"This Frisco booze must be something fierce," thought Billy.</p>

<p>His head ached frightfully and he was very sick. So sick that
the room in which he lay seemed to be rising and falling in a
horribly realistic manner. Every time it dropped it brought Billy's
stomach nearly to his mouth.</p>

<p>Billy shut his eyes. Still the awful sensation. Billy groaned.
He never had been so sick in all his life before, and, my, how his
poor head did hurt. Finding that it only seemed to make matters
worse when he closed his eyes Billy opened them again.</p>

<p>He looked about the room in which he lay. He found it a stuffy
hole filled with bunks in tiers three deep around the sides. In the
center of the room was a table. Above the table a lamp hung
suspended from one of the wooden beams of the ceiling.</p>

<p>The lamp arrested Billy's attention. It was swinging back and
forth rather violently. This could not be a hallucination. The room
might seem to be rising and falling, but that lamp could not seem
to be swinging around in any such manner if it were not really and
truly swinging. He couldn't account for it. Again he shut his eyes
for a moment. When he opened them to look again at the lamp he
found it still swung as before.</p>

<p>Cautiously he slid from his bunk to the floor. It was with
difficulty that he kept his feet. Still that might be but the
effects of the liquor. At last he reached the table to which he
clung for support while he extended one hand toward the lamp.</p>

<p>There was no longer any doubt! The lamp was beating back and
forth like the clapper of a great bell. Where was he? Billy sought
a window. He found some little round, glass-covered holes near the
low ceiling at one side of the room. It was only at the greatest
risk to life and limb that he managed to crawl on all fours to one
of them.</p>

<p>As he straightened up and glanced through he was appalled at the
sight that met his eyes. As far as he could see there was naught
but a tumbling waste of water. And then the truth of what had
happened to him broke upon his understanding.</p>

<p>"An' I was goin' to roll that guy!" he muttered in helpless
bewilderment. "I was a-goin' to roll him, and now look here wot he
has done to me!"</p>

<p>At that moment a light appeared above as the hatch was raised,
and Billy saw the feet and legs of a large man descending the
ladder from above. When the newcomer reached the floor and turned
to look about his eyes met Billy's, and Billy saw that it was his
host of the previous evening.</p>

<p>"Well, my hearty, how goes it?" asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"You pulled it off pretty slick," said Billy.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the other with a frown.</p>

<p>"Come off," said Billy; "you know what I mean."</p>

<p>"Look here," replied the other coldly. "Don't you forget that
I'm mate of this ship, an' that you want to speak respectful to me
if you ain't lookin' for trouble. My name's <i>Mr</i>. Ward, an'
when you speak to me say <i>sir</i>. Understand?"</p>

<p>Billy scratched his head, and blinked his eyes. He never before
had been spoken to in any such fashion&mdash;at least not since he
had put on the avoirdupois of manhood. His head ached horribly and
he was sick to his stomach&mdash;frightfully sick. His mind was
more upon his physical suffering than upon what the mate was
saying, so that quite a perceptible interval of time elapsed before
the true dimensions of the affront to his dignity commenced to
percolate into the befogged and pain-racked convolutions of his
brain.</p>

<p>The mate thought that his bluster had bluffed the new hand. That
was what he had come below to accomplish. Experience had taught him
that an early lesson in discipline and subordination saved
unpleasant encounters in the future. He also had learned that there
is no better time to put a bluff of this nature across than when
the victim is suffering from the after-effects of whiskey and a
drug&mdash;mentality, vitality, and courage are then at their
lowest ebb. A brave man often is reduced to the pitiful condition
of a yellow dog when nausea sits astride his stomach.</p>

<p>But the mate was not acquainted with Billy Byrne of Kelly's
gang. Billy's brain was befuddled, so that it took some time for an
idea to wriggle its way through, but his courage was all there, and
all to the good. Billy was a mucker, a hoodlum, a gangster, a thug,
a tough. When he fought, his methods would have brought a flush of
shame to the face of His Satanic Majesty. He had hit oftener from
behind than from before. He had always taken every advantage of
size and weight and numbers that he could call to his assistance.
He was an insulter of girls and women. He was a bar-room brawler,
and a saloon-corner loafer. He was all that was dirty, and mean,
and contemptible, and cowardly in the eyes of a brave man, and yet,
notwithstanding all this, Billy Byrne was no coward. He was what he
was because of training and environment. He knew no other methods;
no other code. Whatever the meager ethics of his kind he would have
lived up to them to the death. He never had squealed on a pal, and
he never had left a wounded friend to fall into the hands of the
enemy&mdash;the police.</p>

<p>Nor had he ever let a man speak to him, as the mate had spoken,
and get away with it, and so, while he did not act as quickly as
would have been his wont had his brain been clear, he did act; but
the interval of time had led the mate into an erroneous conception
of its cause, and into a further rash show of authority, and had
thrown him off his guard as well.</p>

<p>"What you need," said the mate, advancing toward Billy, "is a
bash on the beezer. It'll help you remember that you ain't nothin'
but a dirty damn landlubber, an' when your betters come around
you'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>But what Billy would have done in the presence of his betters
remained stillborn in the mate's imagination in the face of what
Billy really did do to his better as that worthy swung a sudden,
vicious blow at the mucker's face.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne had not been scrapping with third- and fourth-rate
heavies, and sparring with real, live ones for nothing. The mate's
fist whistled through empty air; the blear-eyed hunk of clay that
had seemed such easy prey to him was metamorphosed on the instant
into an alert, catlike bundle of steel sinews, and Billy Byrne
swung that awful right with the pile-driver weight, that even The
Big Smoke himself had acknowledged respect for, straight to the
short ribs of his antagonist.</p>

<p>With a screech of surprise and pain the mate crumpled in the far
corner of the forecastle, rammed halfway beneath a bunk by the
force of the terrific blow. Like a tiger Billy Byrne was after him,
and dragging the man out into the center of the floor space he beat
and mauled him until his victim's blood-curdling shrieks echoed
through the ship from stem to stern.</p>

<p>When the captain, followed by a half-dozen seamen rushed down
the companionway, he found Billy sitting astride the prostrate form
of the mate. His great fingers circled the man's throat, and with
mighty blows he was dashing the fellow's head against the hard
floor. Another moment and murder would have been complete.</p>

<p>"Avast there!" cried the captain, and as though to punctuate his
remark he swung the heavy stick he usually carried full upon the
back of Billy's head. It was that blow that saved the mate's life,
for when Billy came to he found himself in a dark and smelly hole,
chained and padlocked to a heavy stanchion.</p>

<p>They kept Billy there for a week; but every day the captain
visited him in an attempt to show him the error of his way. The
medium used by the skipper for impressing his ideas of discipline
upon Billy was a large, hard stick. At the end of the week it was
necessary to carry Billy above to keep the rats from devouring him,
for the continued beatings and starvation had reduced him to little
more than an unconscious mass of raw and bleeding meat.</p>

<p>"There," remarked the skipper, as he viewed his work by the
light of day, "I guess that fellow'll know his place next time an
officer an' a gentleman speaks to him."</p>

<p>That Billy survived is one of the hitherto unrecorded miracles
of the power of matter over mind. A man of intellect, of
imagination, a being of nerves, would have succumbed to the shock
alone; but Billy was not as these. He simply lay still and
thoughtless, except for half-formed ideas of revenge, until Nature,
unaided, built up what the captain had so ruthlessly torn down.</p>

<p>Ten days after they brought him up from the hold Billy was
limping about the deck of the <i>Halfmoon</i> doing light manual
labor. From the other sailors aboard he learned that he was not the
only member of the crew who had been shanghaied. Aside from a
half-dozen reckless men from the criminal classes who had signed
voluntarily, either because they could not get a berth upon a
decent ship, or desired to flit as quietly from the law zone of the
United States as possible, not a man was there who had been signed
regularly.</p>

<p>They were as tough and vicious a lot as Fate ever had
forgathered in one forecastle, and with them Billy Byrne felt
perfectly at home. His early threats of awful vengeance to be
wreaked upon the mate and skipper had subsided with the rough but
sensible advice of his messmates. The mate, for his part, gave no
indication of harboring the assault that Billy had made upon him
other than to assign the most dangerous or disagreeable duties of
the ship to the mucker whenever it was possible to do so; but the
result of this was to hasten Billy's nautical education, and keep
him in excellent physical trim.</p>

<p>All traces of alcohol had long since vanished from the young
man's system. His face showed the effects of his enforced
abstemiousness in a marked degree. The red, puffy, blotchy
complexion had given way to a clear, tanned skin; bright eyes
supplanted the bleary, bloodshot things that had given the bestial
expression to his face in the past. His features, always regular
and strong, had taken on a peculiarly refined dignity from the salt
air, the clean life, and the dangerous occupation of the deep-sea
sailor, that would have put Kelly's gang to a pinch to have
recognized their erstwhile crony had he suddenly appeared in their
midst in the alley back of the feed-store on Grand Avenue.</p>

<p>With the new life Billy found himself taking on a new character.
He surprised himself singing at his work&mdash;he whose whole life
up to now had been devoted to dodging honest labor&mdash;whose
motto had been: The world owes me a living, and it's up to me to
collect it. Also, he was surprised to discover that he liked to
work, that he took keen pride in striving to outdo the men who
worked with him, and this spirit, despite the suspicion which the
captain entertained of Billy since the episode of the forecastle,
went far to making his life more endurable on board the
<i>Halfmoon</i>, for workers such as the mucker developed into are
not to be sneezed at, and though he had little idea of
subordination it was worth putting up with something to keep him in
condition to work. It was this line of reasoning that saved Billy's
skull on one or two occasions when his impudence had been
sufficient to have provoked the skipper to a personal assault upon
him under ordinary conditions; and Mr. Ward, having tasted of
Billy's medicine once, had no craving for another encounter with
him that would entail personal conflict.</p>

<p>The entire crew was made up of ruffians and unhung murderers,
but Skipper Simms had had little experience with seamen of any
other ilk, so he handled them roughshod, using his horny fist, and
the short, heavy stick that he habitually carried, in lieu of
argument; but with the exception of Billy the men all had served
before the mast in the past, so that ship's discipline was to some
extent ingrained in them all.</p>

<p>Enjoying his work, the life was not an unpleasant one for the
mucker. The men of the forecastle were of the kind he had always
known&mdash;there was no honor among them, no virtue, no
kindliness, no decency. With them Billy was at home&mdash;he
scarcely missed the old gang. He made his friends among them, and
his enemies. He picked quarrels, as had been his way since
childhood. His science and his great strength, together with his
endless stock of underhand tricks brought him out of each encounter
with fresh laurels. Presently he found it difficult to pick a
fight&mdash;his messmates had had enough of him. They left him
severely alone.</p>

<p>These ofttimes bloody battles engendered no deep-seated hatred
in the hearts of the defeated. They were part of the day's work and
play of the half-brutes that Skipper Simms had gathered together.
There was only one man aboard whom Billy really hated. That was the
passenger, and Billy hated him, not because of anything that the
man had said or done to Billy, for he had never even so much as
spoken to the mucker, but because of the fine clothes and superior
air which marked him plainly to Billy as one of that loathed
element of society&mdash;a gentleman.</p>

<p>Billy hated everything that was respectable. He had hated the
smug, self-satisfied merchants of Grand Avenue. He had writhed in
torture at the sight of every shiny, purring automobile that had
ever passed him with its load of well-groomed men and women. A
clean, stiff collar was to Billy as a red rag to a bull.
Cleanliness, success, opulence, decency, spelled but one thing to
Billy&mdash;physical weakness; and he hated physical weakness. His
idea of indicating strength and manliness lay in displaying as much
of brutality and uncouthness as possible. To assist a woman over a
mud hole would have seemed to Billy an acknowledgement of
pusillanimity&mdash;to stick out his foot and trip her so that she
sprawled full length in it, the hall mark of bluff manliness. And
so he hated, with all the strength of a strong nature, the
immaculate, courteous, well-bred man who paced the deck each day
smoking a fragrant cigar after his meals.</p>

<p>Inwardly he wondered what the dude was doing on board such a
vessel as the <i>Halfmoon</i>, and marveled that so weak a thing
dared venture among real men. Billy's contempt caused him to notice
the passenger more than he would have been ready to admit. He saw
that the man's face was handsome, but there was an unpleasant
shiftiness to his brown eyes; and then, entirely outside of his
former reasons for hating him, Billy came to loathe him
intuitively, as one who was not to be trusted. Finally his dislike
for the man became an obsession. He haunted, when discipline
permitted, that part of the vessel where he would be most likely to
encounter the object of his wrath, hoping, always hoping, that the
"dude" would give him some slight pretext for "pushing in his
mush," as Billy would so picturesquely have worded it.</p>

<p>He was loitering about the deck for this purpose one evening
when he overheard part of a low-voiced conversation between the
object of his wrath and Skipper Simms&mdash;just enough to set him
to wondering what was doing, and to show him that whatever it might
be it was crooked and that the immaculate passenger and Skipper
Simms were both "in on it."</p>

<p>He questioned "Bony" Sawyer and "Red" Sanders, but neither had
nearly as much information as Billy himself, and so the
<i>Halfmoon</i> came to Honolulu and lay at anchor some hundred
yards from a stanch, trim, white yacht, and none knew, other than
the <i>Halfmoon</i>'s officers and her single passenger, the real
mission of the harmless-looking little brigantine.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa3" id="chapa3">III. &mdash; THE CONSPIRACY</a></h2>

<p class="first">No shore leave was granted the crew of the
<i>Halfmoon</i> while the vessel lay off Honolulu, and deep and
ominous were the grumblings of the men. Only First Officer Ward and
the second mate went ashore. Skipper Simms kept the men busy
painting and holystoning as a vent for their pent emotions.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne noticed that the passenger had abandoned his
daylight strolls on deck. In fact he never once left his cabin
while the <i>Halfmoon</i> lay at anchor until darkness had fallen;
then he would come on deck, often standing for an hour at a time
with eyes fastened steadily upon the brave little yacht from the
canopied upper deck of which gay laughter and soft music came
floating across the still water.</p>

<p><br>
WHEN Mr. Ward and the second mate came to shore a strange thing
happened. They entered a third-rate hotel near the water front,
engaged a room for a week, paid in advance, were in their room for
half an hour and emerged clothed in civilian raiment.</p>

<p>Then they hastened to another hostelry&mdash;a first-class one
this time, and the second mate walked ahead in frock coat and silk
hat while Mr. Ward trailed behind in a neat, blue serge sack suit,
carrying both bags.</p>

<p>At the second hotel the second mate registered as Henri
Thérière, Count de Cadenet, and servant, France. His first act
thereafter was to hand a note to the clerk asking that it be
dispatched immediately. The note was addressed to Anthony Harding, Esq., On Board Yacht <i>Lotus</i>.</p>

<p>Count de Cadenet and his servant repaired immediately to the
count's rooms, there to await an answer to the note. Henri
Thérière, the second officer of the <i>Halfmoon</i>, in frock coat
and silk hat looked every inch a nobleman and a gentleman. What his
past had been only he knew, but his polished manners, his knowledge
of navigation and seamanship, and his leaning toward the ways of
the martinet in his dealings with the men beneath him had led
Skipper Simms to assume that he had once held a commission in the
French Navy, from which he doubtless had been kicked&mdash;in
disgrace.</p>

<p>The man was cold, cruel, of a moody disposition, and quick to
anger. He had been signed as second officer for this cruise through
the intervention of Divine and Clinker. He had sailed with Simms
before, but the skipper had found him too hard a customer to deal
with, and had been on the point of seeking another second when
Divine and Clinker discovered him on board the <i>Halfmoon</i> and
after ten minutes' conversation with him found that he fitted so
perfectly into their scheme of action that they would not hear of
Simms' releasing him.</p>

<p>Ward had little use for the Frenchman, whose haughty manner and
condescending airs grated on the sensibilities of the uncouth and
boorish first officer. The duty which necessitated him acting in
the capacity of Thérière's servant was about as distasteful to him
as anything could be, and only served to add to his hatred for the
inferior, who, in the bottom of his heart, he knew to be in every
way, except upon the roster of the <i>Halfmoon</i>, his superior;
but money can work wonders, and Divine's promise that the officers
and crew of the <i>Halfmoon</i> would have a cool million United
States dollars to divide among them in case of the success of the
venture had quite effectually overcome any dislike which Mr. Ward
had felt for this particular phase of his duty.</p>

<p>The two officers sat in silence in their room at the hotel
awaiting an answer to the note they had dispatched to Anthony
Harding, Esq. The parts they were to act had been carefully
rehearsed on board the <i>Halfmoon</i> many times. Each was
occupied with his own thoughts, and as they had nothing in common
outside the present rascality that had brought them together, and
as that subject was one not well to discuss more than necessary,
there seemed no call for conversation.</p>

<p><br>
ON board the yacht in the harbor preparations were being made to
land a small party that contemplated a motor trip up the Nuuanu
Valley when a small boat drew alongside, and a messenger from the
hotel handed a sealed note to one of the sailors.</p>

<p>From the deck of the <i>Halfmoon</i> Skipper Simms witnessed the
transaction, smiling inwardly. Billy Byrne also saw it, but it
meant nothing to him. He had been lolling upon the deck of the
brigantine glaring at the yacht <i>Lotus</i>, hating her and the
gay, well-dressed men and women he could see laughing and chatting
upon her deck. They represented to him the concentrated essence of
all that was pusillanimous, disgusting, loathsome in that other
world that was as far separated from him as though he had been a
grubworm in the manure pile back of Brady's livery stable.</p>

<p>He saw the note handed by the sailor to a gray-haired,
smooth-faced man&mdash;a large, sleek, well-groomed man. Billy
could imagine the white hands and polished nails of him. The
thought was nauseating.</p>

<p>The man who took and opened the note was Anthony Harding, Esq.
He read it, and then passed it to a young woman who stood near-by
talking with other young people.</p>

<p>"Here, Barbara," he said, "is something of more interest to you
than to me. If you wish I'll call upon him and invite him to dinner
tonight."</p>

<p>The girl was reading the note.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Anthony Harding</span>, Esq.<br>
On Board Yacht Lotus,<br>
Honolulu</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr.
Harding</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">This will introduce a very dear friend of mine,
Count de Cadenet, who expects to be in Honolulu about the time that
you are there. The count is traveling for pleasure, and as he is
entirely unacquainted upon the islands any courtesies which you may
show him will he greatly appreciated.</p>

<p class="letter">Cordially,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">L. Cortwrite
Divine</span>.</p>
<br>

<p>The girl smiled as she finished perusing the note.</p>

<p>"Larry is always picking up titles and making dear friends of
them," she laughed. "I wonder where he found this one."</p>

<p>"Or where this one found him," suggested Mr. Harding. "Well, I
suppose that the least we can do is to have him aboard for dinner.
We'll be leaving tomorrow, so there won't be much entertaining we
can do."</p>

<p>"Let's pick him up on our way through town now," suggested
Barbara Harding, "and take him with us for the day. That will be
settling our debt to friendship, and dinner tonight can depend upon
what sort of person we find the count to be."</p>

<p>"As you will," replied her father, and so it came about that two
big touring cars drew up before the Count de Cadenet's hotel half
an hour later, and Anthony Harding, Esq., entered and sent up his
card.</p>

<p>The "count" came down in person to greet his caller. Harding saw
at a glance that the man was a gentleman, and when he had
introduced him to the other members of the party it was evident
that they appraised him quite as had their host. Barbara Harding
seemed particularly taken with the Count de Cadenet, insisting that
he join those who occupied her car, and so it was that the second
officer of the <i>Halfmoon</i> rode out of Honolulu in pleasant
conversation with the object of his visit to the island.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding found De Cadenet an interesting man. There was
no corner of the globe however remote with which he was not to some
degree familiar. He was well read, and possessed the ability to
discuss what he had read intelligently and entertainingly. There
was no evidence of moodiness in him now. He was the personification
of affability, for was he not monopolizing the society of a very
beautiful, and very wealthy young lady?</p>

<p>The day's outing had two significant results. It put into the
head of the second mate of the <i>Halfmoon</i> that which would
have caused his skipper and the retiring Mr. Divine acute mental
perturbation could they have guessed it; and it put De Cadenet into
possession of information which necessitated his refusing the
urgent invitation to dine upon the yacht, <i>Lotus</i>, that
evening&mdash;the information that the party would sail the
following morning en route to Manila.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you," he said to Mr. Harding, "how much I regret
the circumstance that must rob me of the pleasure of accepting your
invitation. Only absolute necessity, I assure you, could prevent me
being with you as long as possible," and though he spoke to the
girl's father he looked directly into the eyes of Barbara
Harding.</p>

<p>A young woman of less experience might have given some outward
indication of the effect of this speech upon her, but whether she
was pleased or otherwise the Count de Cadenet could not guess, for
she merely voiced the smiling regrets that courtesy demanded.</p>

<p>They left De Cadenet at his hotel, and as he bid them farewell
the man turned to Barbara Harding with a low aside.</p>

<p>"I shall see you again, Miss Harding," he said, "very, very
soon."</p>

<p>She could not guess what was in his mind as he voiced this
rather, under the circumstances, unusual statement. Could she have,
the girl would have been terror-stricken; but she saw that in his
eyes which she could translate, and she wondered many times that
evening whether she were pleased or angry with the message it
conveyed.</p>

<p>The moment De Cadenet entered the hotel he hurried to the room
where the impatient Mr. Ward awaited him.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he cried. "We must bundle out of here posthaste. They
sail tomorrow morning. Your duties as valet have been light and
short-lived; but I can give you an excellent recommendation should
you desire to take service with another gentleman."</p>

<p>"That'll be about all of that, Mr. Thérière," snapped the first
officer, coldly. "I did not embark upon this theatrical enterprise
for amusement&mdash;I see nothing funny in it, and I wish you to
remember that I am still your superior officer."</p>

<p>Thérière shrugged. Ward did not chance to catch the ugly look in
his companion's eye. Together they gathered up their belongings,
descended to the office, paid their bill, and a few moments later
were changing back to their sea clothes in the little hotel where
they first had engaged accommodations. Half an hour later they
stepped to the deck of the <i>Halfmoon</i>.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne saw them from where he worked in the vicinity of the
cabin. When they were not looking he scowled maliciously at them.
They were the personal representatives of authority, and Billy
hated authority in whatever guise it might be visited upon him. He
hated law and order and discipline.</p>

<p>"I'd like to meet one of dem guys on Green Street some night,"
he thought.</p>

<p>He saw them enter the captain's cabin with the skipper, and then
he saw Mr. Divine join them. Billy noted the haste displayed by the
four and it set him to wondering. The scrap of conversation between
Divine and Simms that he had overheard returned to him. He wanted
to hear more, and as Billy was not handicapped by any overly
refined notions of the ethics which frown upon eavesdropping he
lost no time in transferring the scene of his labors to a point
sufficiently close to one of the cabin ports to permit him to note
what took place within.</p>

<p>What the mucker heard of that conversation made him prick up his
ears. He saw that something after his own heart was
doing&mdash;something crooked, and he wondered that so
pusillanimous a thing as Divine could have a hand in it. It almost
changed his estimate of the passenger of the <i>Halfmoon</i>.</p>

<p>The meeting broke up so suddenly that Billy had to drop to his
knees to escape the observation of those within the cabin. As it
was, Thérière, who had started to leave a second before the others,
caught a fleeting glimpse of a face that quickly had been withdrawn
from the cabin skylight as though its owner were fearful of
detection.</p>

<p>Without a word to his companions the Frenchman left the cabin,
but once outside he bounded up the companionway to the deck with
the speed of a squirrel. Nor was he an instant too soon, for as he
emerged from below he saw the figure of a man disappearing
forward.</p>

<p>"Hey there, you!" he cried. "Come back here."</p>

<p>The mucker turned, a sulky scowl upon his lowering countenance,
and the second officer saw that it was the fellow who had given
Ward such a trimming the first day out.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you is it, Byrne?" he said in a not unpleasant tone.
"Come to my quarters a moment, I want to speak with you," and so
saying he wheeled about and retraced his way below, the seaman at
his heels.</p>

<p>"My man," said Thérière, once the two were behind the closed
door of the officer's cabin, "I needn't ask how much you overheard
of the conversation in the captain's cabin. If you hadn't overheard
a great deal more than you should you wouldn't have been so keen to
escape detection just now. What I wanted to say to you is this.
Keep a close tongue in your head and stick by me in what's going to
happen in the next few days. This bunch," he jerked his thumb in
the direction of the captain's cabin, "are fixing their necks for
halters, an' I for one don't intend to poke my head through any
noose of another man's making. There's more in this thing if it's
handled right, and handled without too many men in on the whack-up
than we can get out of it if that man Divine has to be counted in.
I've a plan of my own, an' it won't take but three or four of us to
put it across.</p>

<p>"You don't like Ward," he continued, "and you may be almighty
sure that Mr. Ward ain't losing any sleep nights over love of you.
If you stick to that bunch Ward will do you out of your share as
sure as you are a foot high, an' the chances are that he'll do you
out of a whole lot more besides&mdash;as a matter of fact, Byrne,
you're a mighty poor life insurance risk right now, with a life
expectancy that's pretty near minus as long as Bender Ward is on
the same ship with you. Do you understand what I mean?"</p>

<p>"Aw," said Billy Byrne, "I ain't afraid o' that stiff. Let him
make any funny crack at me an' I'll cave in a handful of slats for
him&mdash;the piker."</p>

<p>"That's all right too, Byrne," said Thérière. "Of course you can
do it if anybody can, provided you get the chance; but Ward isn't
the man to give you any chance. There may be shooting necessary
within the next day or so, and there's nothing to prevent Ward
letting you have it in the back, purely by accident; and if he
don't do it then there'll be all kinds of opportunities for it
before any of us ever see a white man's port again. He'll get you,
Byrne, he's that kind.</p>

<p>"Now, with my proposition you'll be shut of Ward, Skipper Simms,
and Divine. There'll be more money in it for you, an' you won't
have to go around expecting a bullet in the small of your back
every minute. What do you say? Are you game, or shall I have to go
back to Skipper Simms and Ward and tell them that I caught you
eavesdropping?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm game," said Billy Byrne, "if you'll promise me a square
deal on the divvy."</p>

<p>The Frenchman extended his hand.</p>

<p>"Let's shake on it," he said.</p>

<p>Billy took the proffered palm in his.</p>

<p>"That's a go," he said; "but hadn't you better wise me to wot's
doin'?"</p>

<p>"Not now," said Thérière, "someone might overhear just as you
did. Wait a bit until I have a better opportunity, and I'll tell
you all there is to know. In the meantime think over who'd be the
best men to let into this with us&mdash;we'll need three or four
more besides ourselves. Now go on deck about your duties as though
nothing had happened, and if I'm a bit rougher than usual with you
you'll understand that it's to avert any possible suspicion
later."</p>

<p>"I'm next," said Billy Byrne.</p>

<h2><a name="chapa4" id="chapa4">IV. &mdash; PIRACY</a></h2>

<p class="first">By dusk the trim little brigantine was scudding
away toward the west before a wind that could not have suited her
better had it been made to order at the special behest of the devil
himself to speed his minions upon their devil's work.</p>

<p>All hands were in the best of humor. The crew had forgotten
their recent rancor at not having been permitted shore leave at
Honolulu in the expectancy of adventure in the near future, for
there was that in the atmosphere of the <i>Halfmoon</i> which
proclaimed louder than words the proximity of excitement, and the
goal toward which they had been sailing since they left San
Francisco.</p>

<p>Skipper Simms and Divine were elated at the luck which had
brought them to Honolulu in the nick of time, and at the success of
Thérière's mission at that port. They had figured upon a week at
least there before the second officer of the <i>Halfmoon</i> could
ingratiate himself sufficiently into the goodwill of the Hardings
to learn their plans, and now they were congratulating themselves
upon their acumen in selecting so fit an agent as the Frenchman for
the work he had handled so expeditiously and so well.</p>

<p>Ward was pleased that he had not been forced to prolong the
galling masquerade of valet to his inferior officer. He was
hopeful, too, that coming events would bring to the fore an
opportunity to satisfy the vengeance he had inwardly sworn against
the sailor who had so roughly manhandled him a few weeks
past&mdash;Thérière had not been in error in his estimate of his
fellow-officer.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne, the arduous labor of making sail over for the time,
was devoting his energies to the task of piecing out from what
Thérière had told him and what he had overheard outside the
skipper's cabin some sort of explanation of the work ahead.</p>

<p>As he pondered Thérière's proposition he saw the wisdom of it.
It would give those interested a larger amount of the booty for
their share. Another feature of it was that it was underhanded and
that appealed strongly to the mucker. Now, if he could but devise
some scheme for double-crossing Thérière the pleasure and profit of
the adventure would be tripled.</p>

<p>It was this proposition that was occupying his attention when he
caught sight of "Bony" Sawyer and "Red" Sanders emerging from the
forecastle. Billy Byrne hailed them.</p>

<p>When the mucker had explained the possibilities of profit that
were to be had by entering the conspiracy aimed at Simms and Ward
the two seamen were enthusiastically for it.</p>

<p>"Bony" Sawyer suggested that the black cook, Blanco, was about
the only other member of the crew upon whom they could depend, and
at Byrne's request "Bony" promised to enlist the cooperation of the
giant Ethiopian.</p>

<p>From early morning of the second day out of Honolulu keen eyes
scanned the eastern horizon through powerful glasses, until about
two bells of the afternoon watch a slight smudge became visible
about two points north of east. Immediately the course of the
<i>Halfmoon</i> was altered so that she bore almost directly north
by west in an effort to come safely into the course of the steamer
which was seen rising rapidly above the horizon.</p>

<p>The new course of the brigantine was held as long as it seemed
reasonably safe without danger of being sighted under full sail by
the oncoming vessel, then her head was brought into the wind, and
one by one her sails were lowered and furled, as the keen eyes of
Second Officer Thérière announced that there was no question but
that the white hull in the distance was that of the steam pleasure
yacht <i>Lotus</i>.</p>

<p>Upon the deck of the unsuspecting vessel a merry party laughed
and chatted in happy ignorance of the plotters in their path. It
was nearly half an hour after the <i>Halfmoon</i> had come to rest,
drifting idly under bare poles, that the lookout upon the
<i>Lotus</i> sighted her.</p>

<p>"Sailin' vessel lyin' to, west half south," he shouted, "flyin'
distress signals."</p>

<p>In an instant guests and crew had hurried to points of vantage
where they might obtain unobstructed view of the stranger, and take
advantage of this break in the monotony of a long sea voyage.</p>

<p>Anthony Harding was on the bridge with the captain, and both men
had leveled their glasses upon the distant ship.</p>

<p>"Can you make her out?" asked the owner.</p>

<p>"She's a brigantine," replied the officer, "and all that I can
make out from here would indicate that everything was shipshape
about her. Her canvas is neatly furled, and she is evidently well
manned, for I can see a number of figures above deck apparently
engaged in watching us. I'll alter our course and speak to
her&mdash;we'll see what's wrong, and give her a hand if we
can."</p>

<p>"That's right," replied Harding; "do anything you can for
them."</p>

<p>A moment later he joined his daughter and their guests to report
the meager information he had.</p>

<p>"How exciting," exclaimed Barbara Harding. "Of course it's not a
real shipwreck, but maybe it's the next thing to it. The poor souls
may have been drifting about here in the center of the Pacific
without food or water for goodness knows how many weeks, and now
just think how they must be lifting their voices in thanks to God
for his infinite mercy in guiding us to them."</p>

<p>"If they've been drifting for any considerable number of weeks
without food or water," hazarded Billy Mallory, "about the only
things they'll need will be what we didn't have the foresight to
bring along&mdash;an undertaker and a preacher."</p>

<p>"Don't be horrid, Billy," returned Miss Harding. "You know
perfectly well that I didn't mean weeks&mdash;I meant days; and
anyway they'll be grateful to us for what we can do for them. I can
scarcely wait to hear their story."</p>

<p>Billy Mallory was inspecting the stranger through Mr. Harding's
glass. Suddenly he gave an exclamation of dismay.</p>

<p>"By George!" he cried. "It is serious after all. That ship's
afire. Look, Mr. Harding," and he passed the glass over to his
host.</p>

<p>And sure enough, as the owner of the <i>Lotus</i> found the
brigantine again in the center of his lens he saw a thin column of
black smoke rising amidships; but what he did not see was Mr. Ward
upon the opposite side of the <i>Halfmoon</i>'s cabin
superintending the burning by the black cook of a bundle of oily
rags in an iron boiler.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed Mr. Harding. "This is terrible. The poor
devils are panic-stricken. Look at 'em making for the boats!" and
with that he dashed back to the bridge to confer with his
captain.</p>

<p>"Yes," said that officer, "I noticed the smoke about the same
time you did&mdash;funny it wasn't apparent before. I've already
signaled full speed ahead, and I've instructed Mr. Foster to have
the boats in readiness to lower away if we find that they're short
of boats on the brigantine.</p>

<p>"What I can't understand," he added after a moment's silence,
"is why they didn't show any signs of excitement about that fire
until we came within easy sight of them&mdash;it looks funny."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll know in a few minutes more," returned Mr. Harding.
"The chances are that the fire is just a recent addition to their
predicament, whatever it may be, and that they have only just
discovered it themselves."</p>

<p>"Then it can't have gained enough headway," insisted the
captain, "to cause them any such immediate terror as would be
indicated by the haste with which the whole ship's crew is tumbling
into those boats; but as you say, sir, we'll have their story out
of them in a few minutes now, so it's idle speculating
beforehand."</p>

<p>The officers and men of the <i>Halfmoon</i>, in so far as those
on board the <i>Lotus</i> could guess, had all entered the boats at
last, and were pulling frantically away from their own ship toward
the rapidly nearing yacht; but what they did not guess and could
not know was that Mr. Divine paced nervously to and fro in his
cabin, while Second Officer Thérière tended the smoking rags that
Ward and Blanco had resigned to him that they might take their
places in the boats.</p>

<p>Thérière had been greatly disgusted with the turn events had
taken for he had determined upon a line of action that he felt sure
would prove highly remunerative to himself. It had been nothing
less than a bold resolve to call Blanco, Byrne, "Bony," and "Red"
to his side the moment Simms and Ward revealed the true purpose of
their ruse to those on board the <i>Lotus</i>, and with his
henchmen take sides with the men of the yacht against his former
companions.</p>

<p>As he had explained it to Billy Byrne the idea was to permit Mr.
Harding to believe that Thérière and his companions had been duped
by Skipper Simms&mdash;that they had had no idea of the work that
they were to be called upon to perform until the last moment and
that then they had done the only thing they could to protect the
passengers and crew of the <i>Lotus</i>.</p>

<p>"And then," Thérière had concluded, "when they think we are a
band of heroes, and the best friends they have on earth we'll just
naturally be in a position to grab the whole lot of them, and
collect ransoms on ten or fifteen instead of just one."</p>

<p>"Bully!" exclaimed the mucker. "You sure got some bean,
mate."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Thérière had had no intention of carrying
the matter as far as he had intimated to Billy except as a last
resort. He had been mightily smitten by the face and fortune of
Barbara Harding and had seen in the trend of events a possible
opportunity of so deeply obligating her father and herself that
when he paid court to her she might fall a willing victim to his
wiles. In this case he would be obliged to risk nothing, and could
make away with his accomplices by explaining to Mr. Harding that he
had been compelled to concoct this other scheme to obtain their
assistance against Simms and Ward; then they could throw the three
into irons and all would be lovely; but now that fool Ward had
upset the whole thing by hitting upon this asinine fire hoax as an
excuse for boarding the <i>Lotus</i> in force, and had further
dampened Thérière's pet scheme by suggesting to Skipper Simms the
danger of Thérière being recognized as they were boarding the
<i>Lotus</i> and bringing suspicion upon them all immediately.</p>

<p>They all knew that a pleasure yacht like the <i>Lotus</i> was
well supplied with small arms, and that at the first intimation of
danger there would be plenty of men aboard to repel assault, and,
in all probability, with entire success.</p>

<p>That there were excellent grounds for Thérière's belief that he
could win Barbara Harding's hand with such a flying start as his
daring plan would have assured him may not be questioned, for the
man was cultivated, polished and, in a sinister way, good-looking.
The title that he had borne upon the occasion of his visit to the
yacht, was, all unknown to his accomplices, his by right of birth,
so that there was nothing other than a long-dead scandal in the
French Navy that might have proved a bar to an affiance such as he
dreamed of. And now to be thwarted at the last moment! It was
unendurable. That pig of a Ward had sealed his own death warrant,
of that Thérière was convinced.</p>

<p>The boats were now quite close to the yacht, which had slowed
down almost to a dead stop. In answer to the query of the
<i>Lotus</i>' captain Skipper Simms was explaining their
trouble.</p>

<p>"I'm Captain Jones," he shouted, "of the brigantine
<i>Clarinda</i>, Frisco to Yokohama with dynamite. We disabled our
rudder yesterday, an' this afternoon fire started in the hold. It's
makin' headway fast now, an'll reach the dynamite most any time.
You'd better take us aboard, an' get away from here as quick as you
can. 'Tain't safe nowhere within five hun'erd fathom of her."</p>

<p>"You'd better make haste, Captain, hadn't you?" suggested Mr.
Harding.</p>

<p>"I don't like the looks of things, sir," replied that officer.
"She ain't flyin' any dynamite flag, an' if she was an' had a hold
full there wouldn't be any particular danger to us, an' anyone that
has ever shipped dynamite would know it, or ought to. It's not fire
that detonates dynamite, it's concussion. No sir, Mr. Harding,
there's something queer here&mdash;I don't like the looks of it.
Why just take a good look at the faces of those men. Did you ever
see such an ugly-looking pack of unhung murderers in your life,
sir?"</p>

<p>"I must admit that they're not an overly prepossessing crowd,
Norris," replied Mr. Harding. "But it's not always either fair or
safe to judge strangers entirely by appearances. I'm afraid that
there's nothing else for it in the name of common humanity than to
take them aboard, Norris. I'm sure your fears are entirely
groundless."</p>

<p>"Then it's your orders, sir, to take them aboard?" asked Captain
Norris.</p>

<p>"Yes, Captain, I think you'd better," said Mr. Harding.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," replied the officer, turning to give the
necessary commands.</p>

<p>The officers and men of the <i>Halfmoon</i> swarmed up the sides
of the <i>Lotus</i>, dark-visaged, fierce, and forbidding.</p>

<p>"Reminds me of a boarding party of pirates," remarked Billy
Mallory, as he watched Blanco, the last to throw a leg over the
rail, reach the deck.</p>

<p>"They're not very pretty, are they?" murmured Barbara Harding,
instinctively shrinking closer to her companion.</p>

<p>"'Pretty' scarcely describes them, Barbara," said Billy; "and do
you know that somehow I am having difficulty in imagining them on
their knees giving up thanks to the Lord for their
rescue&mdash;that was your recent idea of 'em, you will
recall."</p>

<p>"If you have purposely set yourself the task of being more than
ordinarily disagreeable today, Billy," said Barbara sweetly, "I'm
sure it will please you to know that you are succeeding."</p>

<p>"I'm glad I'm successful at something then," laughed the man.
"I've certainly been unsuccessful enough in another matter."</p>

<p>"What, for example?" asked Barbara, innocently.</p>

<p>"Why in trying to make myself so agreeable heretofore that you'd
finally consent to say 'yes' for a change."</p>

<p>"Now you are going to make it all the worse by being stupid,"
cried the girl petulantly. "Why can't you be nice, as you used to
be before you got this silly notion into your head?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it's a silly notion to be head over heels in love
with the sweetest girl on earth," cried Billy.</p>

<p>"Hush! Someone will hear you."</p>

<p>"I don't care if they do. I'd like to advertise it to the whole
world. I'm proud of the fact that I love you; and you don't care
enough about it to realize how really hard I'm hit&mdash;why I'd
die for you, Barbara, and welcome the chance; why&mdash;My God!
What's that?"</p>

<p>"O Billy! What are those men doing?" cried the girl. "They're
shooting. They're shooting at papa! Quick, Billy! Do something. For
heaven's sake do something."</p>

<p>On the deck below them the "rescued" crew of the <i>"Clarinda"</i>
had surrounded Mr. Harding, Captain Norris, and most of the crew of
the <i>Lotus</i>, flashing quick-drawn revolvers from beneath
shirts and coats, and firing at two of the yacht's men who showed
fight.</p>

<p>"Keep quiet," commanded Skipper Simms, "an' there won't none of
you get hurted."</p>

<p>"What do you want of us?" cried Mr. Harding. "If it's money,
take what you can find aboard us, and go on your way. No one will
hinder you."</p>

<p>Skipper Simms paid no attention to him. His eyes swept aloft to
the upper deck. There he saw a wide-eyed girl and a man looking
down upon them. He wondered if she was the one they sought. There
were other women aboard. He could see them, huddled frightened
behind Harding and Norris. Some of them were young and beautiful;
but there was something about the girl above him that assured him
she could be none other than Barbara Harding. To discover the truth
Simms resorted to a ruse, for he knew that were he to ask Harding
outright if the girl were his daughter the chances were more than
even that the old man would suspect something of the nature of
their visit and deny her identity.</p>

<p>"Who is that woman you have on board here?" he cried in an
accusing tone of voice. "That's what we're a-here to find out."</p>

<p>"Why she's my daughter, man!" blurted Harding. "Who did
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Skipper Simms, with a self-satisfied grin.
"That's what I wanted to be sure of. Hey, you, Byrne! You're
nearest the companionway&mdash;fetch the girl."</p>

<p>At the command the mucker turned and leaped up the stairway to
the upper deck. Billy Mallory had overheard the conversation below
and Simms' command to Byrne. Disengaging himself from Barbara
Harding who in her terror had clutched his arm, he ran forward to
the head of the stairway.</p>

<p>The men of the <i>Lotus</i> looked on in mute and helpless rage.
All were covered by the guns of the boarding party&mdash;the still
forms of two of their companions bearing eloquent witness to the
slenderness of provocation necessary to tighten the trigger fingers
of the beasts standing guard over them.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne never hesitated in his rush for the upper deck. The
sight of the man awaiting him above but whetted his appetite for
battle. The trim flannels, the white shoes, the natty cap, were to
the mucker as sufficient cause for justifiable homicide as is an
orange ribbon in certain portions of the West Side of Chicago on
St. Patrick's Day. As were "Remember the Alamo," and "Remember the
Maine" to the fighting men of the days that they were live things
so were the habiliments of gentility to Billy Byrne at all
times.</p>

<p>Billy Mallory was an older man than the mucker&mdash;twenty-four
perhaps&mdash;and fully as large. For four years he had played
right guard on a great eastern team, and for three he had pulled
stroke upon the crew. During the two years since his graduation he
had prided himself upon the maintenance of the physical supremacy
that had made the name of Mallory famous in collegiate athletics;
but in one vital essential he was hopelessly handicapped in combat
with such as Billy Byrne, for Mallory was a gentleman.</p>

<p>As the mucker rushed upward toward him Mallory had all the
advantage of position and preparedness, and had he done what Billy
Byrne would have done under like circumstances he would have
planted a kick in the midst of the mucker's facial beauties with
all the power and weight and energy at his command; but Billy
Mallory could no more have perpetrated a cowardly trick such as
this than he could have struck a woman.</p>

<p>Instead, he waited, and as the mucker came on an even footing
with him Mallory swung a vicious right for the man's jaw. Byrne
ducked beneath the blow, came up inside Mallory's guard, and struck
him three times with trip-hammer velocity and pile-driver
effectiveness&mdash;once upon the jaw and twice&mdash;below the
belt!</p>

<p>The girl, clinging to the rail, riveted by the paralysis of
fright, saw her champion stagger back and half crumple to the deck.
Then she saw him make a brave and desperate rally, as, though torn
with agony, he lurched forward in an endeavor to clinch with the
brute before him. Again the mucker struck his victim&mdash;quick
choppy hooks that rocked Mallory's head from side to side, and
again the brutal blow below the belt; but with the tenacity of a
bulldog the man fought for a hold upon his foe, and at last,
notwithstanding Byrne's best efforts, he succeeded in closing with
the mucker and dragging him to the deck.</p>

<p>Here the two men rolled and tumbled, Byrne biting, gouging, and
kicking while Mallory devoted all of his fast-waning strength to an
effort to close his fingers upon the throat of his antagonist. But
the terrible punishment which the mucker had inflicted upon him
overcame him at last, and as Byrne felt the man's efforts weakening
he partially disengaged himself and raising himself upon one arm
dealt his now almost unconscious enemy a half-dozen frightful blows
upon the face.</p>

<p>With a shriek Barbara Harding turned from the awful sight as
Billy Mallory's bloody and swollen eyes rolled up and set, while
the mucker threw the inert form roughly from him. Quick to the
girl's memory sprang Mallory's recent declaration, which she had
thought at the time but the empty, and vainglorious boasting of the
man in love&mdash;"Why I'd die for you, Barbara, and welcome the
chance!"</p>

<p>"Poor boy! How soon, and how terribly has the chance come!"
moaned the girl.</p>

<p>Then a rough hand fell upon her arm.</p>

<p>"Here, youse," a coarse voice yelled in her ear. "Come out o' de
trance," and at the same time she was jerked roughly toward the
companionway.</p>

<p>Instinctively the girl held back, and then the mucker, true to
his training, true to himself, gave her arm a sudden twist that
wrenched a scream of agony from her white lips.</p>

<p>"Den come along," growled Billy Byrne, "an' quit dis monkey
business, or I'll sure twist yer flipper clean off'n yeh."</p>

<p>With an oath, Anthony Harding sprang forward to protect his
daughter; but the butt of Ward's pistol brought him unconscious to
the deck.</p>

<p>"Go easy there, Byrne," shouted Skipper Simms; "there ain't no
call to injure the hussy&mdash;a corpse won't be worth nothing to
us."</p>

<p>In mute terror the girl now permitted herself to be led to the
deck below. Quickly she was lowered into a waiting boat. Then
Skipper Simms ordered Ward to search the yacht and remove all
firearms, after which he was to engage himself to navigate the
vessel with her own crew under armed guard of half a dozen of the
<i>Halfmoon</i>'s cutthroats.</p>

<p>These things attended to, Skipper Simms with the balance of his
own crew and six of the crew of the <i>Lotus</i> to take the places
upon the brigantine of those left as a prize crew aboard the yacht
returned with the girl to the <i>Halfmoon</i>.</p>

<p>The sailing vessel's sails were soon hoisted and trimmed, and in
half an hour, followed by the <i>Lotus</i>, she was scudding
briskly southward. For forty-eight hours this course was held until
Simms felt assured that they were well out of the lane of regular
trans-Pacific traffic.</p>

<p>During this time Barbara Harding had been kept below, locked in
a small, untidy cabin. She had seen no one other than a great Negro
who brought her meals to her three times daily&mdash;meals that she
returned scarcely touched.</p>

<p>Now the <i>Halfmoon</i> was brought up into the wind where she
lay with flapping canvas while Skipper Simms returned to the
<i>Lotus</i> with the six men of the yacht's crew that he had
brought aboard the brigantine with him two days before, and as many
more of his own men.</p>

<p>Once aboard the <i>Lotus</i> the men were put to work with those
already on the yacht. The boat's rudder was unshipped and dropped
into the ocean; her fires were put out; her engines were attacked
with sledges until they were little better than so much junk, and
to make the slender chances of pursuit that remained to her
entirely nil every ounce of coal upon her was shoveled into the
Pacific. Her extra masts and spare sails followed the way of the
coal and the rudder, so that when Skipper Simms and First Officer
Ward left her with their own men that had been aboard her she was
little better than a drifting derelict.</p>

<p>From her cabin window Barbara Harding had witnessed the wanton
wrecking of her father's yacht, and when it was over and the crew
of the brigantine had returned to their own ship she presently felt
the movement of the vessel as it got under way, and soon the
<i>Lotus</i> dropped to the stern and beyond the range of her tiny
port. With a moan of hopelessness and terror the girl sank
prostrate across the hard berth that spanned one end of her prison
cell.</p>

<p>How long she lay there she did not know, but finally she was
aroused by the opening of her cabin door. As she sprang to her feet
ready to defend herself against what she felt might easily be some
new form of danger her eyes went wide in astonishment as they
rested on the face of the man who stood framed in the doorway of
her cabin.</p>

<p>"You?" she cried.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa5" id="chapa5">V. &mdash; LARRY DIVINE
UNMASKED</a></h2>

<p class="first">"Yes, Barbara, it is I," said Mr. Divine; "and
thank God that I am here to do what little any man may do against
this band of murdering pirates."</p>

<p>"But, Larry," cried the girl, in evident bewilderment, "how did
you come to be aboard this ship? How did you get here? What are you
doing amongst such as these?"</p>

<p>"I am a prisoner," replied the man, "just as are you. I think
they intend holding us for ransom. They got me in San Francisco.
Slugged me and hustled me aboard the night before they sailed."</p>

<p>"Where are they going to take us?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he replied, "although from something I have
overheard of their conversations I imagine that they have in mind
some distant island far from the beaten track of commerce. There
are thousands such in the Pacific that are visited by vessels
scarce once in a century. There they will hold us until they can
proceed with the ship to some point where they can get into
communication with their agents in the States. When the ransom is
paid over to these agents they will return for us and land us upon
some other island where our friends can find us, or leaving us
where we can divulge the location of our whereabouts to those who
pay the ransom."</p>

<p>The girl had been looking intently at Mr. Divine during their
conversation.</p>

<p>"They cannot have treated you very badly, Larry," she said. "You
are as well groomed and well fed, apparently, as ever."</p>

<p>A slight flush mounting to the man's face made the girl wonder a
bit though it aroused no suspicion in her mind.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he hastened to assure her, "they have not treated me
at all badly&mdash;why should they? If I die they can collect no
ransom on me. It is the same with you, Barbara, so I think you need
apprehend no harsh treatment."</p>

<p>"I hope you are right, Larry," she said, but the hopelessness of
her air rather belied any belief that aught but harm could come
from captivity with such as those who officered and manned the
<i>Halfmoon</i>.</p>

<p>"It seems so remarkable," she went on, "that you should be a
prisoner upon the same boat. I cannot understand it. Why only a few
days ago we received and entertained a friend of yours who brought
a letter from you to papa&mdash;the Count de Cadenet."</p>

<p>Again that telltale flush mantled the man's cheek. He cursed
himself inwardly for his lack of self-control. The girl would have
his whole secret out of him in another half-hour if he were not
more careful.</p>

<p>"They made me do that," he said, jerking his thumb in the
general direction of Skipper Simms' cabin. "Maybe that accounts for
their bringing me along. The 'Count de Cadenet' is a fellow named
Thérière, second mate of this ship. They sent him to learn your
plans; when you expected sailing from Honolulu and your course.
They are all crooks and villains. If I hadn't done as they bid they
would have killed me."</p>

<p>The girl made no comment, but Divine saw the contempt in her
face.</p>

<p>"I didn't know that they were going to do this. If I had I'd
have died before I'd have written that note," he added rather
lamely.</p>

<p>The girl was suddenly looking very sad. She was thinking of
Billy Mallory who had died in an effort to save her. The mental
comparison she was making between him and Mr. Divine was not overly
flattering to the latter gentleman.</p>

<p>"They killed poor Billy," she said at last. "He tried to protect
me."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Divine understood the trend of her thoughts. He tried
to find some excuse for his cowardly act; but with the realization
of the true cowardliness and treachery of it that the girl didn't
even guess he understood the futility of seeking to extenuate it.
He saw that the chances were excellent that after all he would be
compelled to resort to force or threats to win her hand at the
last.</p>

<p>"Billy would have done better to have bowed to the inevitable as
I did," he said. "Living I am able to help you now. Dead I could
not have prevented them carrying out their intentions any more than
Billy has, nor could I have been here to aid you now any more than
he is. I cannot see that his action helped you to any great extent,
brave as it was."</p>

<p>"The memory of it and him will always help me," she answered
quietly. "They will help me to bear whatever is before me bravely,
and, when the time comes, to die bravely; for I shall always feel
that upon the other side a true, brave heart is awaiting me."</p>

<p>The man was silent. After a moment the girl spoke again.</p>

<p>"I think I would rather be alone, Larry," she said. "I am very
unhappy and nervous. Possibly I could sleep now."</p>

<p>With a bow he turned and left the cabin.</p>

<p><br>
FOR weeks the <i>Halfmoon</i> kept steadily on her course, a
little south of west. There was no material change in the relations
of those aboard her. Barbara Harding, finding herself unmolested,
finally acceded to the repeated pleas of Mr. Divine, to whose
society she had been driven by loneliness and fear, and appeared on
deck frequently during the daylight watches. Here, one afternoon,
she came face to face with Thérière for the first time since her
abduction. The officer lifted his cap deferentially; but the girl
met his look of expectant recognition with a cold, blank stare that
passed through and beyond him as though he had been empty air.</p>

<p>A tinge of color rose to the man's face, and he continued on his
way for a moment as though content to accept her rebuff; but after
a step or two he turned suddenly and confronted her.</p>

<p>"Miss Harding," he said, respectfully, "I cannot blame you for
the feeling of loathing and distrust you must harbor toward me; but
in common justice I think you should hear me before finally
condemning."</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine," she returned coldly, "what defense there can
be for the cowardly act you perpetrated."</p>

<p>"I have been utterly deceived by my employers," said Thérière,
hastening to take advantage of the tacit permission to explain
which her reply contained. "I was given to understand that the
whole thing was to be but a hoax&mdash;that I was taking part in a
great practical joke that Mr. Divine was to play upon his old
friends, the Hardings and their guests. Until they wrecked and
deserted the <i>Lotus</i> in mid-ocean I had no idea that anything
else was contemplated, although I felt that the matter, even before
that event, had been carried quite far enough for a joke.</p>

<p>"They explained," he continued, "that before sailing you had
expressed the hope that something really exciting and adventurous
would befall the party&mdash;that you were tired of the monotonous
humdrum of twentieth-century existence&mdash;that you regretted the
decadence of piracy, and the expunging of romance from the
seas.</p>

<p>"Mr. Divine, they told me, was a very wealthy young man, to whom
you were engaged to be married, and that he could easily afford the
great expense of the rather remarkable hoax we were supposed to be
perpetrating. I saw no harm in taking part in it, especially as I
knew nothing of the supposititious purpose of the cruise until just
before we reached Honolulu. Before that I had been led to believe
that it was but a pleasure trip to the South Pacific that Mr.
Divine intended.</p>

<p>"You see, Miss Harding, that I have been as badly deceived as
you. Won't you let me help to atone for my error by being your
friend? I can assure you that you will need one whom you can trust
amongst this shipload of scoundrels."</p>

<p>"Who am I to believe?" cried the girl. "Mr. Divine assures me
that he, too, has been forced into this affair, but by threats of
death rather than deception."</p>

<p>The expression on Mr. Thérière's face was eloquent of sarcastic
incredulity.</p>

<p>"How about the note of introduction that I carried to your
father from Mr. Divine?" asked Thérière.</p>

<p>"He says that he was compelled to write it at the point of a
revolver," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"Come with me, Miss Harding," said the officer. "I think that I
may be able to convince you that Mr. Divine is not on any such bad
terms with Skipper Simms as would be the case were his story to you
true."</p>

<p>As he spoke he started toward the companionway leading to the
officers' cabins. Barbara Harding hesitated at the top of the
stairway.</p>

<p>"Have no fear, Miss Harding," Thérière reassured her. "Remember
that I am your friend and that I am merely attempting to prove it
to your entire satisfaction. You owe it to yourself to discover as
soon as possible who your friends are aboard this ship, and who
your enemies."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the girl. "I can be in no more danger one
place aboard her than another."</p>

<p>Thérière led her directly to his own cabin, cautioning her to
silence with upraised forefinger. Softly, like skulking criminals,
they entered the little compartment. Then Thérière turned and
closed the door, slipping the bolt noiselessly as he did so.
Barbara watched him, her heart beating rapidly with fear and
suspicion.</p>

<p>"Here," whispered Thérière, motioning her toward his berth. "I
have found it advantageous to know what goes on beyond this
partition. You will find a small round hole near the head of the
berth, about a foot above the bedding. Put your ear to it and
listen&mdash;I think Divine is in there now."</p>

<p>The girl, still frightened and fearful of the man's intentions,
did, nevertheless, as he bid. At first she could make out nothing
beyond the partition but a confused murmur of voices, and the clink
of glass, as of the touch of the neck of a bottle against a goblet.
For a moment she remained in tense silence, her ear pressed to the
tiny aperture. Then, distinctly, she heard the voice of Skipper
Simms.</p>

<p>"I'm a-tellin' you, man," he was saying, "that there wan't
nothin' else to be done, an' I'm a-gettin' damn sick o' hearin' you
finding fault all the time with the way I been a-runnin' o' this
little job."</p>

<p>"I'm not finding fault, Simms," returned another voice which the
girl recognized immediately as Divine's; "although I do think that
it was a mistake to so totally disable the <i>Lotus</i> as you did.
Why, how on earth are we ever to return to civilization if that
boat is lost? Had she been simply damaged a little, in a way that
they could themselves have fixed up, the delay would have been
sufficient to permit us to escape, and then, when Miss Harding was
returned in safety to her father, after our marriage, they would
have been so glad to be reunited that he easily could have been
persuaded to drop the matter. Then another thing; you intended to
demand a ransom for both Miss Harding and myself, to carry out the
fiction of my having been stolen also&mdash;how can you do that if
Mr. Harding be dead? And do you suppose for a moment that Miss
Harding will leave a single stone unturned to bring the guilty to
justice if any harm has befallen her father or his guests? If so
you do not know her as well as I."</p>

<p>The girl turned away from the partition, her face white and
drawn, her eyes inexpressibly sad. She rose to her feet, facing
Thérière.</p>

<p>"I have heard quite enough, thank you, Mr. Thérière," she
said.</p>

<p>"You are convinced then that I am your friend?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am convinced that Mr. Divine is not," she replied
non-committally.</p>

<p>She took a step toward the door. Thérière stood looking at her.
She was unquestionably very good to look at. He could not remember
ever having seen a more beautiful girl. A great desire to seize her
in his arms swept over the man. Thérière had not often made any
effort to harness his desires. What he wanted it had been his
custom to take&mdash;by force if necessary. He took a step toward
Barbara Harding. There was a sudden light in his eyes that the girl
had not before seen there, and she reached quickly toward the knob
of the door.</p>

<p>Thérière was upon her, and then, quickly, he mastered himself,
for he recalled his coolly thought-out plan based on what Divine
had told him of that clause in the will of the girl's departed
grandparent which stipulated that the man who shared the bequest
with her must be the choice of both herself and her father. He
could afford to bide his time, and play the chivalrous protector
before he essayed the role of lover.</p>

<p>Barbara had turned a half-frightened look toward him as he
advanced&mdash;in doubt as to his intentions.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Miss Harding," he said; "the door is
bolted&mdash;let me unlatch it for you," and very gallantly he did
so, swinging the portal wide that she might pass out. "I feared
interruption," he said, in explanation of the bolt.</p>

<p>In silence they returned to the upper deck. The intoxication of
sudden passion now under control, Thérière was again master of
himself and ready to play the cold, calculating, waiting game that
he had determined upon. Part of his plan was to see just enough of
Miss Harding to insure a place in her mind at all times; but not
enough to suggest that he was forcing himself upon her. Rightly, he
assumed that she would appreciate thoughtful deference to her
comfort and safety under the harrowing conditions of her present
existence more than a forced companionship that might entail too
open devotion on his part. And so he raised his cap and left her,
only urging her to call upon him at any time that he might be of
service to her.</p>

<p>Left alone the girl became lost in unhappy reflections, and in
the harrowing ordeal of attempting to readjust herself to the
knowledge that Larry Divine, her lifelong friend, was the
instigator of the atrocious villainy that had been perpetrated
against her and her father. She found it almost equally difficult
to believe that Mr. Thérière was so much more sinned against than
sinning as he would have had her believe. And yet, did his story
not sound even more plausible than that of Divine which she had
accepted before Thérière had made it possible for her to know the
truth? Why, then, was it so difficult for her to believe the
Frenchman? She could not say, but in the inmost recesses of her
heart she knew that she mistrusted and feared the man.</p>

<p>As she stood leaning against the rail, buried deep in thought,
Billy Byrne passed close behind her. At sight of her a sneer curled
his lip. How he hated her! Not that she ever had done aught to harm
him, but rather because she represented to him in concrete form all
that he had learned to hate and loathe since early childhood.</p>

<p>Her soft, white skin; her shapely hands and well-cared-for
nails; her trim figure and perfectly fitting suit all taunted him
with their superiority over him and his kind. He knew that she
looked down upon him as an inferior being. She was of the class
that addressed those in his walk of life as "my man." Lord, how he
hated that appellation!</p>

<p>The intentness of his gaze upon her back had the effect so often
noted by the observant, and suddenly aroused from the lethargy of
her misery the girl swung around to meet the man's eyes squarely
upon her. Instantly she recognized him as the brute who had killed
Billy Mallory. If there had been hate in the mucker's eyes as he
looked at the girl, it was as nothing by comparison with the
loathing and disgust which sprang to hers as they rested upon his
sullen face.</p>

<p>So deep was her feeling of contempt for this man, that the
sudden appearance of him before her startled a single exclamation
from her.</p>

<p>"Coward!" came the one word, involuntarily, from her lips.</p>

<p>The man's scowl deepened menacingly. He took a threatening step
toward her.</p>

<p>"Wot's dat?" he growled. "Don't get gay wit me, or I'll black
dem lamps fer yeh," and he raised a heavy fist as though to strike
her.</p>

<p>The mucker had looked to see the girl cower before his
threatened blow&mdash;that would have been ample atonement for her
insult, and would have appealed greatly to his Kelly-gang sense of
humor. Many a time had he threatened women thus, for the keen
enjoyment of hearing their screams of fright and seeing them turn
and flee in terror. When they had held their ground and opposed
him, as some upon the West Side had felt sufficiently muscular to
do, the mucker had not hesitated to "hand them one." Thus only
might a man uphold his reputation for bravery in the vicinage of
Grand Avenue.</p>

<p>He had looked to see this girl of the effete and effeminate
upper class swoon with terror before him; but to his intense
astonishment she but stood erect and brave before him, her head
high held, her eyes cold and level and unafraid. And then she spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Coward!" she said.</p>

<p>Billy almost struck her; but something held his hand. What, he
could not understand. Could it be that he feared this slender girl?
And at this juncture, when the threat of his attitude was the most
apparent, Second Officer Thérière came upon the scene. At a glance
he took in the situation, and with a bound had sprung between Billy
Byrne and Barbara Harding.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa6" id="chapa6">VI. &mdash; THE MUCKER AT BAY</a></h2>

<p class="first">"What has this man said to you, Miss Harding?"
cried Thérière. "Has he offered you harm?"</p>

<p>"I do not think that he would have dared strike me," replied the
girl, "though he threatened to do so. He is the coward who murdered
poor Mr. Mallory upon the <i>Lotus</i>. He might stoop to anything
after that."</p>

<p>Thérière turned angrily upon Byrne.</p>

<p>"Go below!" he shouted. "I'll attend to you later. If Miss
Harding were not here I'd thrash you within an inch of your life
now. And if I ever hear of your speaking to her again, or offering
her the slightest indignity I'll put a bullet through you so quick
you won't know what has struck you."</p>

<p>"T'ell yeh will!" sneered Billy Byrne. "I got your number, yeh
big stiff; an' yeh better not get gay wit me. Dey ain't no guy on
board dis man's ship dat can hand Billy Byrne dat kin' o' guff an'
get away with it&mdash;see?" and before Thérière knew what had
happened a heavy fist had caught him upon the point of the chin and
lifted him clear off the deck to drop him unconscious at Miss
Harding's feet.</p>

<p>"Yeh see wot happens to guys dat get gay wit me?" said the
mucker to the girl, and then stooping over the prostrate form of
the mate Billy Byrne withdrew a huge revolver from Thérière's hip
pocket.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll need dis gat in my business purty soon," he
remarked.</p>

<p>Then he planted a vicious kick in the face of the unconscious
man and went his way to the forecastle.</p>

<p>"Now maybe she'll tink Billy Byrne's a coward," he thought, as
he disappeared below.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding stood speechless with shock at the brutality and
ferocity of the unexpected attack upon Thérière. Never in all her
life had she dreamed that there could exist upon the face of the
earth a thing in human form so devoid of honor, and chivalry, and
fair play as the creature that she had just witnessed threatening a
defenseless woman, and kicking an unconscious man in the face; but
then Barbara Harding had never lived between Grand Avenue and Lake
Street, and Halsted and Robey, where standards of masculine bravery
are strange and fearful.</p>

<p>When she had recovered her equanimity she hastened to the head
of the cabin companionway and called aloud for help. Instantly
Skipper Simms and First Officer Ward rushed on deck, each carrying
a revolver in readiness for the conflict with their crew that these
two worthies were always expecting.</p>

<p>Barbara pointed out the still form of Thérière, quickly
explaining what had occurred.</p>

<p>"It was the fellow Byrne who did it," she said. "He has gone
into the forecastle now, and he has a revolver that he took from
Mr. Thérière after he had fallen."</p>

<p>Several of the crew had now congregated about the prostrate
officer.</p>

<p>"Here you," cried Skipper Simms to a couple of them; "you take
Mr. Thérière below to his cabin, an' throw cold water in his face.
Mr. Ward, get some brandy from my locker, an' try an' bring him to.
The rest of you arm yourselves with crowbars and axes, an' see that
that son of a sea cook don't get out on deck again alive. Hold him
there 'til I get a couple of guns. Then we'll get him, damn
him!"</p>

<p>Skipper Simms hastened below while two of the men were carrying
Thérière to his cabin and Mr. Ward was fetching the brandy. A
moment later Barbara Harding saw the skipper return to the upper
deck with a rifle and two revolvers. The sailors whom he had
detailed to keep Byrne below were gathered about the hatchway
leading to the forecastle. Some of them were exchanging profane and
pleasant badinage with the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Yeh better come up an' get killed easy-like;" one called down
to the mucker. "We're apt to muss yeh all up down there in the dark
with these here axes and crowbars, an' then wen we send yeh home
yer pore maw won't know her little boy at all."</p>

<p>"Yeh come on down here, an' try mussin' me up," yelled back
Billy Byrne. "I can lick de whole gang wit one han' tied behin'
me&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>"De skipper's gorn to get his barkers, Billy," cried "Bony"
Sawyer. "Yeh better come up an' stan' trial if he gives yeh the
chanct."</p>

<p>"Stan' nothin'," sneered Billy. "Swell chance I'd have wit him
an' Squint Eye holdin' court over me. Not on yer life, "Bony." I'm
here, an' here I stays till I croaks, but yeh better believe me,
I'm goin, to croak a few before I goes, so if any of you ginks are
me frien's yeh better keep outen here so's yeh won't get hurted.
An' anudder ting I'm goin' to do afore I cashes in&mdash;I'm goin'
to put a few of dem ginks in de cabin wise to where dey stands wit
one anudder. If I don't start something before I goes out me name's
not Billy Byrne."</p>

<p>At this juncture Skipper Simms appeared with the three weapons
he had gone to his cabin to fetch. He handed one to "Bony" Sawyer,
another to "Red" Sanders and a third to a man by the name of
Wison.</p>

<p>"Now, my men," said Skipper Simms, "we will go below and bring
Byrne up. Bring him alive if you can&mdash;but bring him."</p>

<p>No one made a move to enter the forecastle.</p>

<p>"Go on now, move quickly," commanded Skipper Simms sharply.</p>

<p>"Thought he said 'we'," remarked one of the sailors.</p>

<p>Skipper Simms, livid with rage, turned to search out the
offender from the several men behind him.</p>

<p>"Who was that?" he roared. "Show me the blitherin' swab. Jes'
show him to me, I tell you, an I'll learn him. Now you," he yelled
at the top of his voice, turning again to the men he had ordered
into the forecastle after Billy Byrne, "you cowardly landlubbers
you, get below there quick afore I kick you below."</p>

<p>Still no one moved to obey him. From white he went to red, and
then back to white again. He fairly frothed at the mouth as he
jumped up and down, cursing the men, and threatening. But all to no
avail. They would not go.</p>

<p>"Why, Skipper," spoke up "Bony" Sawyer, "it's sure death for any
man as goes below there. It's easier, an' safer, to starve him
out."</p>

<p>"Starve nothin'," shrieked Skipper Simms. "Do you reckon I'm
a-goin' to sit quiet here for a week an' let any blanked wharf rat
own that there fo'c's'le just because I got a lot o' white-livered
cowards aboard? No sir! You're a-goin' down after that would-be bad
man an' fetch him up dead or alive," and with that he started
menacingly toward the three who stood near the hatch, holding their
firearms safely out of range of Billy Byrne below.</p>

<p>What would have happened had Skipper Simms completed the
threatening maneuver he had undertaken can never be known, for at
this moment Thérière pushed his way through the circle of men who
were interested spectators of the impending tragedy.</p>

<p>"What's up, sir?" he asked of Simms. "Anything that I can help
you with?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the skipper; "so you ain't dead after all, eh?
Well that don't change the looks of things a mite. We gotta get
that man outa there an' these flea-bitten imitations of men ain't
got the guts to go in after him."</p>

<p>"He's got your gun, sir," spoke up Wison, "an' Gawd knows he be
the one as'ud on'y be too glad for the chanct to use it."</p>

<p>"Let me see if I can't handle him, sir," said Thérière to
Skipper Simms. "We don't want to lose any men if we can help
it."</p>

<p>The skipper was only too glad to welcome this unexpected rescue
from the predicament in which he had placed himself. How Thérière
was to accomplish the subjugation of the mutinous sailor he could
not guess, nor did he care so long as it was done without risk to
his own skin.</p>

<p>"Now if you'll go away, sir," said Thérière, "and order the men
away I'll see what I can do."</p>

<p>Skipper Simms did as Thérière had requested, so that presently
the officer stood alone beside the hatch. Across the deck,
amidships, the men had congregated to watch Thérière's operations,
while beyond them stood Barbara Harding held fascinated by the grim
tragedy that was unfolding before her upon this accursed
vessel.</p>

<p>Thérière leaned over the open hatch, in full view of the waiting
Byrne, ready below. There was the instant report of a firearm and a
bullet whizzed close past Thérière's head.</p>

<p>"Avast there, Byrne!" he shouted. "It's I, Thérière. Don't shoot
again, I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>"No monkey business now," growled the mucker in reply. "I won't
miss again."</p>

<p>"I want to talk with you, Byrne," said Thérière in a low tone.
"I'm coming down there."</p>

<p>"No you ain't, cul," returned Byrne; "leastways yeh ain't
a-comin' down here alive."</p>

<p>"Yes I am, Byrne," replied Thérière, "and you don't want to be
foolish about it. I'm unarmed. You can cover me with your gun until
you have satisfied yourself as to that. I'm the only man on the
ship that can save your life&mdash;the only man that has any reason
to want to; but we've got to talk it over and we can't talk this
way where there's a chance of being overheard. I'll be on the
square with you if you will with me, and if we can't come to terms
I'll come above again and you won't be any worse off than you are
now. Here I come," and without waiting for an acceptance of his
proposition the second officer of the <i>Halfmoon</i> slipped over
the edge of the hatchway and disappeared from the sight of the
watchers above.</p>

<p>That he was a brave man even Billy Byrne had to admit, and those
above who knew nothing of the relations existing between the second
mate and the sailor, who had so recently felled him, thought that
his courage was little short of marvelous. Thérière's stock went up
by leaps and bounds in the estimation of the sailors of the
<i>Halfmoon</i>, for degraded though they were they could
understand and appreciate physical courage of this sort, while to
Barbara Harding the man's act seemed unparalleled in its utter
disregard of the consequences of life and death to himself that it
entailed. She suddenly was sorry that she had entertained any
suspicions against Thérière&mdash;so brave a man could not be other
than the soul of honor, she argued.</p>

<p>Once below Thérière found himself covered by his own revolver in
the hands of a very desperate and a very unprincipled man. He
smiled at Byrne as the latter eyed him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"See here, Byrne," said Thérière. "It would be foolish for me to
say that I am doing this for love of you. The fact is that I need
you. We cannot succeed, either one of us, alone. I think you made a
fool play when you hit me today. You know that our understanding
was that I was to be even a little rougher with you than usual, in
order to avoid suspicion being attached to any seeming familiarity
between us, should we be caught conferring together. I had the
chance to bawl you out today, and I thought that you would
understand that I was but taking advantage of the opportunity which
it afforded to make it plain to Miss Harding that there could be
nothing other than hatred between us&mdash;it might have come in
pretty handy later to have her believe that.</p>

<p>"If I'd had any idea that you really intended hitting me you'd
have been a dead man before your fist reached me, Byrne. You took
me entirely by surprise; but that's all in the past&mdash;I'm
willing to let bygones be bygones, and help you out of the pretty
pickle you've got yourself into. Then we can go ahead with our work
as though nothing had happened. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know yeh was kiddin," replied the mucker, "or I
wouldn't have hit yeh. Yeh acted like yeh meant it."</p>

<p>"Very well, that part's understood," said Thérière. "Now will
you come out if I can square the thing with the skipper so's you
won't get more than a day or so in irons&mdash;he'll have to give
you something to save his own face; but I promise that you'll get
your food regularly and that you won't be beaten up the way you
were before when he had you below. If he won't agree to what I
propose I give you my word to tell you so."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Billy Byrne; "I don't trust nobody wen I don't
have to; but I'll be dinged if I see any other way out of it."</p>

<p>Thérière returned to the deck and seeking out the skipper drew
him to one side.</p>

<p>"I can get him up peaceably if I can assure him that he'll only
get a day or so in the cooler, with full rations and no beatings. I
think, sir, that that will be the easiest way out of it. We cannot
spare a man now&mdash;if we want to get the fellow later we can
always find some pretext."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Thérière," replied the skipper, "I'll leave the
matter entirely in your hands&mdash;you can do what you want with
the fellow; it's you as had your face punched."</p>

<p>Thérière returned immediately to the forecastle, from which he
presently emerged with the erstwhile recalcitrant Byrne, and for
two days the latter languished in durance vile, and that was the
end of the episode, though its effects were manifold. For one thing
it implanted in the heart of Thérière a personal hatred for the
mucker, so that while heretofore his intention of ridding himself
of the man when he no longer needed him was due purely to a matter
of policy, it was now reinforced by a keen desire for personal
revenge. The occurrence had also had its influence upon Barbara
Harding, in that it had shown her Mr. Thérière in a new
light&mdash;one that reflected credit upon him. She had thought his
magnanimous treatment of the sailor little short of heroic; and it
had deepened the girl's horror of Billy Byrne until it now amounted
to little short of an obsession. So vivid an impression had his
brutality made upon her that she would start from deep slumber,
dreaming that she was menaced by him.</p>

<p><br>
AFTER Billy was released for duty following his imprisonment, he
several times passed the girl upon deck. He noticed that she shrank
from him in disgust and terror; but what surprised him was that
instead of the thrill of pride which he formerly would have felt at
this acknowledgment of his toughness, for Billy prided himself on
being a tough, he now felt a singular resentment against the girl
for her attitude, so that he came to hate her even more than he had
before hated. Formerly he had hated her for the things she stood
for, now he hated her for herself.</p>

<p>Thérière was often with her now, and, less frequently, Divine;
for at the second officer's suggestion Barbara had not acquainted
that gentleman with the fact that she was aware of his
duplicity.</p>

<p>"It is just as well not to let him know," said Thérière. "It
gives you an advantage that would be wanting should he suspect the
truth, so that now you are always in a position to be warned in
plenty of time against any ulterior suggestion he may make. Keep me
posted as to all he tells you of his plans, and in this way we can
defeat him much more easily than as though you followed your
natural inclinations and refused to hold communication of any sort
with him. It might be well, Miss Harding, even to encourage him in
the hope that you will wed him voluntarily. I think that that would
throw him entirely off his guard, and pave the way for your early
release."</p>

<p>"Oh, I doubt if I could do that, Mr. Thérière," exclaimed the
girl. "You cannot imagine how I loathe the man now that I know him
in his true colors. For years he has importuned me to marry him,
and though I never cared for him in that way at all, and never
could, I felt that he was a very good friend and that his constancy
demanded some return on my part&mdash;my friendship and sympathy at
least; but now I shiver whenever he is near me, just as I would
were I to find a snake coiled close beside me. I cannot abide
treachery."</p>

<p>"Nor I, Miss Harding," agreed Thérière glibly. "The man deserves
nothing but your contempt, though for policy's sake I hope that you
will find it possible to lead him on until his very treachery
proves the means of your salvation, for believe me, if he has been
false to you how much more quickly will he be false to Simms and
Ward! He would ditch them in a minute if the opportunity presented
itself for him to win you without their aid. I had thought it might
be feasible to lead him into attempting to take the ship by force,
and return you to San Francisco, or, better still possibly, to the
nearest civilized port.</p>

<p>"You might, with propriety suggest this to him, telling him that
you believe that I would stand ready to assist in the undertaking.
I can promise you the support of several of the men&mdash;quite a
sufficient number with Divine and myself, easily to take the
<i>Halfmoon</i> away from her present officers."</p>

<p>"I will think over your suggestion, Mr. Thérière," replied
Barbara, "and I thank you for the generous impulse that has
prompted you to befriend me&mdash;heaven knows how badly I need a
friend now among so many enemies. What is it, Mr. Thérière? What is
the matter?"</p>

<p>The officer had turned his eyes casually toward the southeast as
the girl spoke, and just now he had given a sudden exclamation of
surprise and alarm.</p>

<p>"That cloud, Miss Harding," he answered. "We're in for a bad
blow, and it'll be on us in a minute," and with that he started
forward on a run, calling back over his shoulder, "you'd better go
below at once."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa7" id="chapa7">VII. &mdash; THE TYPHOON</a></h2>

<p class="first">The storm that struck the <i>Halfmoon</i> took her
entirely unaware. It had sprung, apparently, out of a perfectly
clear sky. Both the lookout and the man at the wheel were ready to
take oath that they had scanned the horizon not a half-minute
before Second Mate Thérière had come racing forward bellowing for
all hands on deck and ordering a sailor below to report the
menacing conditions to Captain Simms.</p>

<p>Before that officer reached the deck Thérière had the entire
crew aloft taking in sail; but though they worked with the
desperation of doomed men they were only partially successful in
their efforts.</p>

<p>The sky and sea had assumed a sickly yellowish color, except for
the mighty black cloud that raced toward them, low over the water.
The low moaning sound that had followed the first appearance of the
storm, gave place to a sullen roar, and then, of a sudden, the
thing struck the <i>Halfmoon</i>, ripping her remaining canvas from
her as if it had been wrought from tissue paper, and with the
flying canvas, spars, and cordage went the mainmast, snapping ten
feet above the deck, and crashing over the starboard bow with a
noise and jar that rose above the bellowing of the typhoon.</p>

<p>Fully half the crew of the <i>Halfmoon</i> either went down with
the falling rigging or were crushed by the crashing weight of the
mast as it hurtled against the deck. Skipper Simms rushed back and
forth screaming out curses that no one heeded, and orders that
there was none to fill.</p>

<p>Thérière, on his own responsibility, looked to the hatches. Ward
with a handful of men armed with axes attempted to chop away the
wreckage, for the jagged butt of the fallen mast was dashing
against the ship's side with such vicious blows that it seemed but
a matter of seconds ere it would stave a hole in her.</p>

<p>With the utmost difficulty a sea anchor was rigged and tumbled
over the <i>Halfmoon</i>'s pitching bow into the angry sea, that
was rising to more gigantic proportions with each succeeding
minute. This frail makeshift which at best could but keep the
vessel's bow into the wind, saving her from instant engulfment in
the sea's trough, seemed to Thérière but a sorry means of
prolonging the agony of suspense preceding the inevitable end. That
nothing could save them was the second officer's firm belief, nor
was he alone in his conviction. Not only Simms and Ward, but every
experienced sailor on the ship felt that the life of the
<i>Halfmoon</i> was now but a matter of hours, possibly minutes,
while those of lesser experience were equally positive that each
succeeding wave must mark the termination of the lives of the
vessel and her company.</p>

<p>The deck, washed now almost continuously by hurtling tons of
storm-mad water, as one mountainous wave followed another the
length of the ship, had become entirely impossible. With difficulty
the men were attempting to get below between waves. All semblance
of discipline had vanished. For the most part they were a pack of
howling, cursing, terror-ridden beasts, fighting at the hatches
with those who would have held them closed against the danger of
each new assault of the sea.</p>

<p>Ward and Skipper Simms had been among the first to seek the
precarious safety below deck. Thérière alone of the officers had
remained on duty until the last, and now he was exerting his every
faculty in the effort to save as many of the men as possible
without losing the ship in the doing of it. Only between waves was
the entrance to the main cabins negotiable, while the forecastle
hatch had been abandoned entirely after it had with difficulty been
replaced following the retreat of three of the crew to that part of
the ship.</p>

<p>The mucker stood beside Thérière as the latter beat back the men
when the seas threatened. It was the man's first experience of the
kind. Never had he faced death in the courage-blighting form which
the grim harvester assumes when he calls unbridled Nature to do his
ghastly bidding. The mucker saw the rough, brawling bullies of the
forecastle reduced to white-faced, gibbering cowards, clawing and
fighting to climb over one another toward the lesser danger of the
cabins, while the mate fought them off, except as he found it
expedient to let them pass him; he alone cool and fearless.</p>

<p>Byrne stood as one apart from the dangers and hysteric strivings
of his fellows. Once when Thérière happened to glance in his
direction the Frenchman mentally ascribed the mucker's seeming
lethargy to the paralysis of abject cowardice. "The fellow is in a
blue funk," thought the second mate; "I did not misjudge
him&mdash;like all his kind he is a coward at heart."</p>

<p>Then a great wave came, following unexpectedly close upon the
heels of a lesser one. It took Thérière off his guard, threw him
down and hurtled him roughly across the deck, landing him in the
scuppers, bleeding and stunned. The next wave would carry him
overboard.</p>

<p>Released from surveillance the balance of the crew pushed and
fought their way into the cabin&mdash;only the mucker remained
without, staring first at the prostrate form of the mate and then
at the open cabin hatch. Had one been watching him he might
reasonably have thought that the man's mind was in a muddle of
confused thoughts and fears; but such was far from the case. Billy
was waiting to see if the mate would revive sufficiently to return
across the deck before the next wave swept the ship. It was very
interesting&mdash;he wondered what odds O'Leary would have laid
against the man.</p>

<p>In another moment the wave would come. Billy glanced at the open
cabin hatch. That would never do&mdash;the cabin would be flooded
with tons of water should the next wave find the hatch still open.
Billy closed it. Then he looked again toward Thérière. The man was
just recovering consciousness&mdash;and the wave was coming.</p>

<p>Something stirred within Billy Byrne. It gripped him and made
him act quickly as though by instinct to do something that no one,
Billy himself least of all, would have suspected that the Grand
Avenue mucker would have been capable of.</p>

<p>Across the deck Thérière was dragging himself painfully to his
hands and knees, as though to attempt the impossible feat of
crawling back to the cabin hatch. The wave was almost upon Billy.
In a moment it would engulf him, and then rush on across him to
tear Thérière from the deck and hurl him beyond the ship into the
tumbling, watery, chaos of the sea.</p>

<p>The mucker saw all this, and in the instant he launched himself
toward the man for whom he had no use, whose kind he hated,
reaching him as the great wave broke over them, crushing them to
the deck, choking and blinding them.</p>

<p>For a moment they were buried in the swirling maelstrom, and
then as the <i>Halfmoon</i> rose again, shaking the watery enemy
from her back, the two men were disclosed&mdash;Thérière half over
the ship's side&mdash;the mucker clinging to him with one hand, the
other clutching desperately at a huge cleat upon the gunwale.</p>

<p>Byrne dragged the mate to the deck, and then slowly and with
infinite difficulty across it to the cabin hatch. Through it he
pushed the man, tumbling after him and closing the aperture just as
another wave swept the <i>Halfmoon</i>.</p>

<p>Thérière was conscious and but little the worse for his
experience, though badly bruised. He looked at the mucker in
astonishment as the two faced each other in the cabin.</p>

<p>"I don't know why you did it," said Thérière.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," replied Billy Byrne.</p>

<p>"I shall not forget it, Byrne," said the officer.</p>

<p>"Yeh'd better," answered Billy, turning away.</p>

<p>The mucker was extremely puzzled to account for his act. He did
not look upon it at all as a piece of heroism; but rather as a
"fool play" which he should be ashamed of. The very idea! Saving
the life of a gink who, despite his brutal ways, belonged to the
much-despised "highbrow" class. Billy was peeved with himself.</p>

<p>Thérière, for his part, was surprised at the unexpected heroism
of the man he had long since rated as a cowardly bully. He was
fully determined to repay Byrne in so far as he could the great
debt he owed him. All thoughts of revenge for the mucker's former
assault upon him were dropped, and he now looked upon the man as a
true friend and ally.</p>

<p><br>
FOR three days the <i>Halfmoon</i> plunged helplessly upon the
storm-wracked surface of the mad sea. No soul aboard her
entertained more than the faintest glimmer of a hope that the ship
would ride out the storm; but during the third night the wind died
down, and by morning the sea had fallen sufficiently to make it
safe for the men of the <i>Halfmoon</i> to venture upon deck.</p>

<p>There they found the brigantine clean-swept from stem to stern.
To the north of them was land at a league or two, perhaps. Had the
storm continued during the night they would have been dashed upon
the coast. God-fearing men would have given thanks for their
miraculous rescue; but not so these. Instead, the fear of death
removed, they assumed their former bravado.</p>

<p>Skipper Simms boasted of the seamanship that had saved the
<i>Halfmoon</i>&mdash;his own seamanship of course. Ward was
cursing the luck that had disabled the ship at so crucial a period
of her adventure, and revolving in his evil mind various possible
schemes for turning the misfortune to his own advantage. Billy
Byrne, sitting upon the corner of the galley table, hobnobbed with
Blanco. These choice representatives of the ship's company were
planning a raid on the skipper's brandy chest during the
disembarkation which the sight of land had rendered not
improbable.</p>

<p>The <i>Halfmoon</i>, with the wind down, wallowed heavily in the
trough of the sea, but even so Barbara Harding, wearied with days
of confinement in her stuffy cabin below, ventured above deck for a
breath of sweet, clean air.</p>

<p>Scarce had she emerged from below than Thérière espied her, and
hastened to her side.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Harding," he exclaimed, "it seems good to see you on
deck again. I can't tell you how sorry I have felt for you cooped
up alone in your cabin without a single woman for companionship,
and all those frightful days of danger, for there was scarce one of
us that thought the old hooker would weather so long and hard a
blow. We were mighty fortunate to come through it so handily."</p>

<p>"Handily?" queried Barbara Harding, with a wry smile, glancing
about the deck of the <i>Halfmoon</i>. "I cannot see that we are
either through it handily or through it at all. We have no masts,
no canvas, no boats; and though I am not much of a sailor, I can
see that there is little likelihood of our effecting a landing on
the shore ahead either with or without boats&mdash;it looks most
forbidding. Then the wind has gone down, and when it comes up again
it is possible that it will carry us away from the land, or if it
takes us toward it, dash us to pieces at the foot of those
frightful cliffs."</p>

<p>"I see you are too good a sailor by far to be cheered by any
questionable hopes," laughed Thérière; "but you must take the will
into consideration&mdash;I only wished to give you a ray of hope
that might lighten your burden of apprehension. However, honestly,
I do think that we may find a way to make a safe landing if the sea
continues to go down as it has in the past two hours. We are not
more than a league from shore, and with the jury mast and sail that
the men are setting under Mr. Ward now we can work in comparative
safety with a light breeze, which we should have during the
afternoon. There are few coasts, however rugged they may appear at
a distance, that do not offer some foothold for the wrecked
mariner, and I doubt not but that we shall find this no exception
to the rule."</p>

<p>"I hope you are right, Mr. Thérière," said the girl, "and yet I
cannot but feel that my position will be less safe on land than it
has been upon the <i>Halfmoon</i>. Once free from the restraints of
discipline which tradition, custom, and law enforce upon the high
seas there is no telling what atrocities these men will commit. To
be quite candid, Mr. Thérière, I dread a landing worse than I
dreaded the dangers of the storm through which we have just
passed."</p>

<p>"I think you have little to fear on that score, Miss Harding,"
said the Frenchman. "I intend making it quite plain that I consider
myself your protector once we have left the <i>Halfmoon</i>, and I
can count on several of the men to support me. Even Mr. Divine will
not dare do otherwise. Then we can set up a camp of our own apart
from Skipper Simms and his faction where you will be constantly
guarded until succor may be obtained."</p>

<p>Barbara Harding had been watching the man's face as he spoke.
The memory of his consideration and respectful treatment of her
during the trying weeks of her captivity had done much to erase the
intuitive feeling of distrust that had tinged her thoughts of him
earlier in their acquaintance, while his heroic act in descending
into the forecastle in the face of the armed and desperate Byrne
had thrown a glamour of romance about him that could not help but
tend to fascinate a girl of Barbara Harding's type. Then there was
the look she had seen in his eyes for a brief instant when she had
found herself locked in his cabin on the occasion that he had
revealed to her Larry Divine's duplicity. That expression no
red-blooded girl could mistake, and the fact that he had subdued
his passion spoke eloquently to the girl of the fineness and
chivalry of his nature, so now it was with a feeling of utter
trustfulness that she gladly gave herself into the keeping of Henri
Thérière, Count de Cadenet, Second Officer of the
<i>Halfmoon</i>.</p>

<p>"O Mr. Thérière," she cried, "if you only can but arrange it so,
how relieved and almost happy I shall be. How can I ever repay you
for all that you have done for me?"</p>

<p>Again she saw the light leap to the man's eyes&mdash;the light
of a love that would not be denied much longer other than through
the agency of a mighty will. Love she thought it; but the eye-light
of love and lust are twin lights between which it takes much
worldly wisdom to differentiate, and Barbara Harding was not
worldly-wise in the ways of sin.</p>

<p>"Miss Harding," said Thérière, in a voice that he evidently
found it difficult to control, "do not ask me now how you may repay
me; I&mdash;;" but what he would have said he checked, and with an
effort of will that was almost appreciable to the eye he took a
fresh grip upon himself, and continued: "I am amply repaid by being
able to serve you, and thus to retrieve myself in your
estimation&mdash;I know that you have doubted me; that you have
questioned the integrity of my acts that helped to lead up to the
unfortunate affair of the <i>Lotus</i>. When you tell me that you
no longer doubt&mdash;that you accept me as the friend I would wish
to be, I shall be more than amply repaid for anything which it may
have been my good fortune to have been able to accomplish for your
comfort and safety."</p>

<p>"Then I may partially repay you at once," exclaimed the girl
with a smile, "for I can assure you that you possess my friendship
to the fullest, and with it, of course, my entire confidence. It is
true that I doubted you at first&mdash;I doubted everyone connected
with the <i>Halfmoon</i>. Why shouldn't I? But now I think that I
am able to draw a very clear line between my friends and my
enemies. There is but one upon the right side of that
line&mdash;you, my friend," and with an impulsive little gesture
Barbara Harding extended her hand to Thérière.</p>

<p>It was with almost a sheepish expression that the Frenchman took
the proffered fingers, for there had been that in the frank avowal
of confidence and friendship which smote upon a chord of honor in
the man's soul that had not vibrated in response to a chivalrous
impulse for so many long years that it had near atrophied from
disuse.</p>

<p>Then, of a sudden, the second officer of the <i>Halfmoon</i>
straightened to his full height. His head went high, and he took
the small hand of the girl in his own strong, brown one.</p>

<p>"Miss Harding," he said, "I have led a hard, bitter life. I have
not always done those things of which I might be most proud: but
there have been times when I have remembered that I am the grandson
of one of Napoleon's greatest field marshals, and that I bear a
name that has been honored by a mighty nation. What you have just
said to me recalls these facts most vividly to my mind&mdash;I
hope, Miss Harding, that you will never regret having spoken them,"
and to the bottom of his heart the man meant what he said, at the
moment; for inherent chivalry is as difficult to suppress or uproot
as is inherent viciousness.</p>

<p>The girl let her hand rest in his for a moment, and as their
eyes met she saw in his a truth and honesty and cleanness which
revealed what Thérière might have been had Fate ordained his young
manhood to different channels. And in that moment a question
sprang, all unbidden and unforeseen to her mind; a question which
caused her to withdraw her hand quickly from his, and which sent a
slow crimson to her cheek.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne, slouching by, cast a bitter look of hatred upon the
two. The fact that he had saved Thérière's life had not increased
his love for that gentleman. He was still much puzzled to account
for the strange idiocy that had prompted him to that act; and two
of his fellows had felt the weight of his mighty fist when they had
spoken words of rough praise for his heroism&mdash;Billy had
thought that they were kidding him.</p>

<p>To Billy the knocking out of Thérière, and the subsequent kick
which he had planted in the unconscious man's face, were true
indications of manliness. He gauged such matters by standards
purely Grand Avenuesque and now it enraged him to see that the girl
before whose very eyes he had demonstrated his superiority over
Thérière should so look with favor upon the officer.</p>

<p>It did not occur to Billy that he would care to have the girl
look with favor upon him. Such a thought would have sent him into a
berserker rage; but the fact remained that Billy felt a strong
desire to cut out Thérière's heart when he saw him now in close
converse with Barbara Harding&mdash;just why he felt so Billy could
not have said. The truth of the matter is that Billy was far from
introspective; in fact he did very little thinking. His mind had
never been trained to it, as his muscles had been trained to
fighting. Billy reacted more quickly to instinct than to the
processes of reasoning, and on this account it was difficult for
him to explain any great number of his acts or moods&mdash;it is to
be doubted, however, that Billy Byrne had ever attempted to get at
the bottom of his soul, if he possessed one.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, had Thérière known it he was very near death
that moment when a summons from Skipper Simms called him aft and
saved his life. Then the mucker, unseen by the officer, approached
the girl. In his heart were rage and hatred, and as the girl turned
at the sound of his step behind her she saw them mirrored in his
dark, scowling face.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa8" id="chapa8">VIII. &mdash; THE WRECK OF THE
"HALFMOON"</a></h2>

<p class="first">Instantly Barbara Harding looked into the face of
the mucker she read her danger. Why the man should hate her so she
could not guess; but that he did was evidenced by the malevolent
expression of his surly countenance. For a moment he stood glaring
at her, and then he spoke.</p>

<p>"I'm wise to wot youse an' dat guy was chinnin' about," he
growled, "an' I'm right here to tell youse dat you don't wanta try
an' put nothin' over on me, see? Youse ain't a-goin' to
double-cross Billy Byrne. I gotta good notion to han' youse wot's
comin' to you. If it hadn't been fer youse I wouldn't have been
here now on dis Gawd-forsaken wreck. Youse is de cause of all de
trouble. Wot youse ought to get is croaked an' den dere wouldn't be
nothin' to bother any of us. You an' yer bunch of kale, dey give me
a swift pain. Fer half a cent I'd soak youse a wallop to de solar
plexus dat would put youse to sleep fer de long count,
you&mdash;you&mdash;" but here words failed Billy.</p>

<p>To his surprise the girl showed not the slightest indication of
fear. Her head was high, and her level gaze never wavered from his
own eyes. Presently a sneer of contempt curled her lip.</p>

<p>"You coward!" she said quietly. "To insult and threaten a woman!
You are nothing but an insufferable bully, and a cowardly murderer.
You murdered a man on the <i>Lotus</i> whose little finger held
more true manhood, bravery, and worth than the whole of your great,
hulking carcass. You are only fit to strike from behind, or when
your victim is unsuspecting, as you did Mr. Thérière that other
day. Do you think I fear a <i>thing</i> such as you&mdash;a beast
without honor that kicks an unconscious man in the face? I know
that you can kill me. I know that you are coward enough to do it
because I am a defenseless woman; and though you may kill me, you
never can make me show fear for you. That is what you wish to
do&mdash;that is your idea of manliness. I had never imagined that
such a thing as you lived in the guise of man; but I have read you,
Mr. Byrne, since I have had occasion to notice you, and I know now
that you are what is known in the great cities as a mucker. The
term never meant much to me before, but I see now that it fits your
kind perfectly, for in it is all the loathing and contempt that a
real man&mdash;a gentleman&mdash;must feel for such as you."</p>

<p>As she spoke Billy Byrne's eyes narrowed; but not with the
cunning of premeditated attack. He was thinking. For the first time
in his life he was thinking of how he appeared in the eyes of
another. Never had any human being told Billy Byrne thus coolly and
succinctly what sort of person he seemed to them. In the heat of
anger men of his own stamp had applied vile epithets to him,
describing him luridly as such that by the simplest laws of nature
he could not possibly be; but this girl had spoken coolly, and her
descriptions had been explicit&mdash;backed by illustrations. She
had given real reasons for her contempt, and somehow it had made
that contempt seem very tangible.</p>

<p>One who had known Billy would have expected him to fly into a
rage and attack the girl brutally after her scathing diatribe.
Billy did nothing of the sort. Barbara Harding's words seemed to
have taken all the fight out of him. He stood looking at her for a
moment&mdash;it was one of the strange contradictions of Billy
Byrne's personality that he could hold his eyes quite steady and
level, meeting the gaze of another unwaveringly&mdash;and in that
moment something happened to Billy Byrne's perceptive faculties. It
was as though scales which had dimmed his mental vision had
partially dropped away, for suddenly he saw what he had not before
seen&mdash;a very beautiful girl, brave and unflinching before the
brutal menace of his attitude, and though the mucker thought that
he still hated her, the realization came to him that he must not
raise a hand against her&mdash;that for the life of him he could
not, nor ever again against any other woman. Why this change, Billy
did not know, he simply knew that it was so, and with an ugly grunt
he turned his back upon her and walked away.</p>

<p>A slight breeze had risen from the southwest since Thérière had
left Barbara Harding and now all hands were busily engaged in
completing the jury rigging that the <i>Halfmoon</i> might take
advantage of the wind and make the shore that rose abruptly from
the bosom of the ocean but a league away.</p>

<p>Before the work was completed the wind increased rapidly, so
that when the tiny bit of canvas was hoisted into position it
bellied bravely, and the <i>Halfmoon</i> moved heavily forward
toward the land.</p>

<p>"We gotta make a mighty quick run of it," said Skipper Simms to
Ward, "or we'll go to pieces on them rocks afore ever we find a
landing."</p>

<p>"That we will if this wind rises much more," replied Ward;
"and's far as I can see there ain't no more chance to make a
landing there than there would be on the side of a house."</p>

<p>And indeed as the <i>Halfmoon</i> neared the towering cliffs it
seemed utterly hopeless that aught else than a fly could find a
foothold upon that sheer and rocky face that rose abruptly from the
ocean's surface.</p>

<p>Some two hundred yards from the shore it became evident that
there was no landing to be made directly before them, and so the
course of the ship was altered to carry them along parallel to the
shore in an effort to locate a cove, or beach where a landing might
safely be effected.</p>

<p>The wind, increasing steadily, was now whipping the sea into
angry breakers that dashed resoundingly against the rocky barrier
of the island. To drift within reach of those frightful destroyers
would mean the instant annihilation of the <i>Halfmoon</i> and all
her company, yet this was precisely what the almost unmanageable
hulk was doing at the wheel under the profane direction of Skipper
Simms, while Ward and Thérière with a handful of men altered the
meager sail from time to time in an effort to keep the ship off the
rocks for a few moments longer.</p>

<p>The <i>Halfmoon</i> was almost upon the cliff's base when a
narrow opening showed some hundred fathoms before her nose, an
opening through which the sea ran in long, surging sweeps, rolling
back upon itself in angry breakers that filled the aperture with
swirling water and high-flung spume. To have attempted to drive the
ship into such a place would have been the height of madness under
ordinary circumstances. No man knew what lay beyond, nor whether
the opening carried sufficient water to float the <i>Halfmoon</i>,
though the long, powerful sweep of the sea as it entered the
opening denoted considerable depth.</p>

<p>Skipper Simms, seeing the grim rocks rising close beside his
vessel, realized that naught could keep her from them now. He saw
death peering close to his face. He felt the icy breath of the Grim
Reaper upon his brow. A coward at heart, he lost every vestige of
his nerve at this crucial moment of his life. Leaping from the
wheelhouse to the deck he ran backward and forward shrieking at the
top of his lungs begging and entreating someone to save him, and
offering fabulous rewards to the man who carried him safely to the
shore.</p>

<p>The sight of their captain in a blue funk had its effect upon
the majority of the crew, so that in a moment a pack of screaming,
terror-ridden men had supplanted the bravos and bullies of the
<i>Halfmoon</i>.</p>

<p>From the cabin companionway Barbara Harding looked upon the
disgusting scene. Her lip curled in scorn at the sight of these men
weeping and moaning in their fright. She saw Ward busy about one of
the hatches. It was evident that he intended making a futile
attempt to utilize it as a means of escape after the
<i>Halfmoon</i> struck, for he was attaching ropes to it and
dragging it toward the port side of the ship, away from the shore.
Larry Divine crouched beside the cabin and wept.</p>

<p>When Simms gave up the ship Barbara Harding saw the wheelmen,
there had been two of them, desert their post, and almost instantly
the nose of the <i>Halfmoon</i> turned toward the rocks; but
scarcely had the men reached the deck than Thérière leaped to their
place at the wheel.</p>

<p>Unassisted he could do little with the heavy helm. Barbara saw
that he alone of all the officers and men of the brigantine was
making an attempt to save the vessel. However futile the effort
might be, it at least bespoke the coolness and courage of the man.
With the sight of him there wrestling with death in a hopeless
struggle a little wave of pride surged through the girl. Here
indeed was a man! And he loved her&mdash;that she knew. Whether or
no she returned his love her place was beside him now, to give what
encouragement and physical aid lay in her power.</p>

<p>Quickly she ran to the wheelhouse. Thérière saw her and
smiled.</p>

<p>"There's no hope, I'm afraid," he said; "but, by George, I
intend to go down fighting, and not like those miserable yellow
curs."</p>

<p>Barbara did not reply, but she grasped the spokes of the heavy
wheel and tugged as he tugged. Thérière made no effort to dissuade
her from the strenuous labor&mdash;every ounce of weight would help
so much, and the man had a wild, mad idea that he was attempting to
put into effect.</p>

<p>"What do you hope to do?" asked the girl. "Make that opening in
the cliffs?"</p>

<p>Thérière nodded.</p>

<p>"Do you think me crazy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is such a chance as only a brave man would dare to take,"
she replied. "Do you think that we can get her to take it?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it," he answered. "With another man at the wheel we
might, though."</p>

<p>Below them the crew of the <i>Halfmoon</i> ran hither and
thither along the deck on the side away from the breakers. They
fought with one another for useless bits of planking and cordage.
The giant figure of the black cook, Blanco, rose above the others.
In his hand was a huge butcher knife. When he saw a piece of wood
he coveted in the hands of another he rushed upon his helpless
victim with wild, bestial howls, menacing him with his gleaming
weapon. Thus he was rapidly accumulating the material for a life
raft.</p>

<p>But there was a single figure upon the deck that did not seem
mad with terror. A huge fellow he was who stood leaning against the
capstan watching the wild antics of his fellows with a certain
wondering expression of incredulity, the while a contemptuous smile
curled his lips. As Barbara Harding chanced to look in his
direction he also chanced to turn his eyes toward the wheelhouse.
It was the mucker.</p>

<p>The girl was surprised that he, the greatest coward of them all,
should be showing no signs of cowardice now&mdash;probably he was
paralyzed with fright. The moment that the man saw the two who were
in the wheelhouse and the work that they were doing he sprang
quickly toward them. At his approach the girl shrank closer to
Thérière.</p>

<p>What new outrage did the fellow contemplate? Now he was beside
her. The habitual dark scowl blackened his expression. He laid a
heavy hand on Barbara Harding's arm.</p>

<p>"Come out o' dat," he bellowed. "Dat's no kind o' job fer a
broiler."</p>

<p>And before either she or Thérière could guess his intention the
mucker had pushed Barbara aside and taken her place at the
wheel.</p>

<p>"Good for you, Byrne!" cried Thérière. "I needed you badly."</p>

<p>"Why didn't yeh say so den?" growled the man.</p>

<p>With the aid of Byrne's Herculean muscles and great weight the
bow of the <i>Halfmoon</i> commenced to come slowly around so that
presently she almost paralleled the cliffs again, but now she was
much closer in than when Skipper Simms had deserted her to her
fate&mdash;so close that Thérière had little hope of being able to
carry out his plan of taking her opposite the opening and then
turning and running her before the wind straight into the swirling
waters of the inlet.</p>

<p>Now they were almost opposite the aperture and between the giant
cliffs that rose on either side of the narrow entrance a sight was
revealed that filled their hearts with renewed hope and rejoicing,
for a tiny cove was seen to lie beyond the fissure&mdash;a cove
with a long, wide, sandy beach up which the waves, broken at the
entrance to the little haven, rolled with much diminished
violence.</p>

<p>"Can you hold her alone for a second, Byrne?" asked Thérière.
"We must make the turn in another moment and I've got to let out
sail. The instant that you see me cut her loose put your helm hard
to starboard. She'll come around easy enough I imagine, and then
hold her nose straight for that opening. It's one chance in a
thousand; but it's the only one. Are you game?"</p>

<p>"You know it, cul&mdash;go to 't," was Billy Byrne's laconic
rejoinder.</p>

<p>As Thérière left the wheel Barbara Harding stepped to the
mucker's side.</p>

<p>"Let me help you," she said. "We need every hand that we can get
for the next few moments."</p>

<p>"Beat it," growled the man. "I don't want no skirts in my
way."</p>

<p>With a flush, the girl drew back, and then turning watched
Thérière where he stood ready to cut loose the sail at the proper
instant. The vessel was now opposite the cleft in the cliffs.
Thérière had lashed a new sheet in position. Now he cut the old
one. The sail swung around until caught in position by the stout
line. The mucker threw the helm hard to starboard. The nose of the
brigantine swung quickly toward the rocks. The sail filled, and an
instant later the ship was dashing to what seemed her inevitable
doom.</p>

<p>Skipper Simms, seeing what Thérière had done after it was too
late to prevent it, dashed madly across the deck toward his
junior.</p>

<p>"You fool!" he shrieked. "You fool! What are you doing? Driving
us straight for the rocks&mdash;murdering the whole lot of us!" and
with that he sprang upon the Frenchman with maniacal fury, bearing
him to the deck beneath him.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding saw the attack of the fear-demented man, but she
was powerless to prevent it. The mucker saw it too, and
grinned&mdash;he hoped that it would be a good fight; there was
nothing that he enjoyed more. He was sorry that he could not take a
hand in it, but the wheel demanded all his attention now, so that
he was even forced to take his eyes from the combatants that he
might rivet them upon the narrow entrance to the cove toward which
the <i>Halfmoon</i> was now plowing her way at constantly
increasing speed.</p>

<p>The other members of the ship's company, all unmindful of the
battle that at another time would have commanded their undivided
attention, stood with eyes glued upon the wild channel toward which
the brigantine's nose was pointed. They saw now what Skipper Simms
had failed to see&mdash;the little cove beyond, and the chance for
safety that the bold stroke offered if it proved successful.</p>

<p>With steady muscles and giant sinews the mucker stood by the
wheel&mdash;nursing the erratic wreck as no one might have supposed
it was in him to do. Behind him Barbara Harding watched first
Thérière and Simms, and then Byrne and the swirling waters toward
which he was heading the ship.</p>

<p>Even the strain of the moment did not prevent her from wondering
at the strange contradictions of the burly young ruffian who could
at one moment show such traits of cowardliness and the next rise so
coolly to the highest pinnacles of courage. As she watched him
occasionally now she noted for the first time the leonine contour
of his head, and she was surprised to note that his features were
regular and fine, and then she recalled Billy Mallory and the
cowardly kick that she had seen delivered in the face of the
unconscious Thérière&mdash;with a little shudder of disgust she
turned away from the man at the wheel.</p>

<p>Thérière by this time had managed to get on top of Skipper
Simms, but that worthy still clung to him with the desperation of a
drowning man. The <i>Halfmoon</i> was rising on a great wave that
would bear her well into the maelstrom of the cove's entrance. The
wind had increased to the proportions of a gale, so that the
brigantine was fairly racing either to her doom or her
salvation&mdash;who could tell which?</p>

<p>Halfway through the entrance the wave dropped the ship, and with
a mighty crash that threw Barbara Harding to her feet the vessel
struck full amidships upon a sunken reef. Like a thing of glass she
broke in two with the terrific impact, and in another instant the
waters about her were filled with screaming men.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding felt herself hurtled from the deck as though
shot from a catapult. The swirling waters engulfed her. She knew
that her end had come, only the most powerful of swimmers might
hope to win through that lashing hell of waters to the beach
beyond. For a girl to do it was too hopeless even to contemplate;
but she recalled Thérière's words of so short a time ago: "There's
no hope, I'm afraid; but, by George, I intend to go down fighting,"
and with the recollection came a like resolve on her part&mdash;to
go down fighting, and so she struck out against the powerful waters
that swirled her hither and thither, now perilously close to the
rocky sides of the entrance, and now into the mad chaos of the
channel's center. Would to heaven that Thérière were near her, she
thought, for if any could save her it would be he.</p>

<p>Since she had come to believe in the man's friendship and
sincerity Barbara Harding had felt renewed hope of eventual
salvation, and with the hope had come a desire to live which had
almost been lacking for the greater part of her detention upon the
<i>Halfmoon</i>.</p>

<p>Bravely she battled now against the awful odds of the mighty
Pacific, but soon she felt her strength waning. More and more
ineffective became her puny efforts, and at last she ceased almost
entirely the futile struggle.</p>

<p>And then she felt a strong hand grasp her arm, and with a sudden
surge she was swung over a broad shoulder. Quickly she grasped the
rough shirt that covered the back of her would-be rescuer, and then
commenced a battle with the waves that for many minutes, that
seemed hours to the frightened girl, hung in the balance; but at
last the swimmer beneath her forged steadily and persistently
toward the sandy beach to flounder out at last with an unconscious
burden in his mighty arms.</p>

<p>As the man staggered up out of reach of the water Barbara
Harding opened her eyes to look in astonishment into the face of
the mucker.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa9" id="chapa9">IX. &mdash; ODA YORIMOTO</a></h2>

<p class="first">Only four men of the <i>Halfmoon</i>'s crew were
lost in the wreck of the vessel. All had been crowded in the bow
when the ship broke in two, and being far-flung by the forward part
of the brigantine as it lunged toward the cove on the wave
following the one which had dropped the craft upon the reef, with
the exception of the four who had perished beneath the wreckage
they had been able to swim safely to the beach.</p>

<p>Larry Divine, who had sat weeping upon the deck of the doomed
ship during the time that hope had been at its lowest, had
recovered his poise. Skipper Simms, subdued for the moment, soon
commenced to regain his bluster. He took Thérière to task for the
loss of the <i>Halfmoon</i>.</p>

<p>"An' ever we make a civilized port," he shouted, "I'll prefer
charges ag'in' you, you swab you; a-losin' of the finest bark as
ever weathered a storm. Ef it hadn't o' been fer you a-mutinyin'
agin' me I'd a-brought her through in safety an' never lost a
bloomin' soul."</p>

<p>"Stow it!" admonished Thérière at last; "your foolish bluster
can't hide the bald fact that you deserted your post in time of
danger. We're ashore now, remember, and there is no more ship for
you to command, so were I you I'd be mighty careful how I talked to
my betters."</p>

<p>"What's that!" screamed the skipper. "My betters! You
frog-eatin' greaser you, I'll teach you. Here, some of you, clap
this swab into irons. I'll learn him that I'm still captain of this
here bunch."</p>

<p>Thérière laughed in the man's face; but Ward and a couple of
hands who had been shown favoritism by the skipper and first mate
closed menacingly toward the second officer.</p>

<p>The Frenchman took in the situation at a glance. They were
ashore now, where they didn't think that they needed him further
and the process of elimination had commenced. Well, it might as
well come to a showdown now as later.</p>

<p>"Just a moment," said Thérière, raising his hand. "You're not
going to take me alive, and I have no idea that you want to anyhow,
and if you start anything in the killing line some of you are going
to Davy Jones' locker along with me. The best thing for all
concerned is to divide up this party now once and for all."</p>

<p>As he finished speaking he turned toward Billy Byrne.</p>

<p>"Are you and the others with me, or against me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm ag'in' Simms," replied the mucker non-committally.</p>

<p>"Bony" Sawyer, "Red" Sanders, Blanco, Wison, and two others drew
in behind Billy Byrne.</p>

<p>"We all's wid Billy," announced Blanco.</p>

<p>Divine and Barbara Harding stood a little apart. Both were
alarmed at the sudden, hostile turn events had taken. Simms, Ward,
and Thérière were the only members of the party armed. Each wore a
revolver strapped about his hips. All were still dripping from
their recent plunge in the ocean.</p>

<p>Five men stood behind Skipper Simms and Ward, but there were two
revolvers upon that side of the argument. Suddenly Ward turned
toward Divine.</p>

<p>"Are you armed, Mr. Divine?" he asked.</p>

<p>Divine nodded affirmatively.</p>

<p>"Then you'd better come over with us&mdash;it looks like we
might need you to help put down this mutiny," said Ward.</p>

<p>Divine hesitated. He did not know which side was more likely to
be victorious, and he wanted to be sure to be on the winning side.
Suddenly an inspiration came to him.</p>

<p>"This is purely a matter to be settled by the ship's officers,"
he said. "I am only a prisoner, call me a passenger if you
like&mdash;I have no interest whatever in the matter, and shall not
take sides."</p>

<p>"Yes you will," said Mr. Ward, in a low, but menacing tone.
"You're in too deep to try to ditch us now. If you don't stand by
us we'll treat you as one of the mutineers when we're through with
them, and you can come pretty near a-guessin' what they'll
get."</p>

<p>Divine was about to reply, and the nature of his answer was
suggested by the fact that he had already taken a few steps in the
direction of Simms' faction, when he was stopped by the low voice
of the girl behind him.</p>

<p>"Larry," she said, "I know all&mdash;your entire connection with
this plot. If you have a spark of honor or manhood left you will do
what little you can to retrieve the terrible wrong you have done
me, and my father. You can never marry me. I give you my word of
honor that I shall take my own life if that is the only way to
thwart your plans in that direction, and so as the fortune can
never be yours it seems to me that the next best thing would be to
try and save me from the terrible predicament in which your
cupidity has placed me. You can make the start now, Larry, by
walking over and placing yourself at Mr. Thérière's disposal. He
has promised to help and protect me."</p>

<p>A deep flush mounted to the man's neck and face. He did not turn
about to face the girl he had so grievously wronged&mdash;for the
life of him he could not have met her eyes. Slowly he turned, and
with gaze bent upon the ground walked quickly toward Thérière.</p>

<p>Ward was quick to recognize the turn events had taken, and to
see that it gave Thérière the balance of power, with two guns and
nine men in his party against their two guns and seven men. It also
was evident to him that to the other party the girl would naturally
gravitate since Divine, an old acquaintance, had cast his lot with
it; nor had the growing intimacy between Miss Harding and Thérière
been lost upon him.</p>

<p>Ward knew that Simms was an arrant coward, nor was he himself
overly keen for an upstanding, man-to-man encounter such as must
quickly follow any attempt upon his part to uphold the authority of
Simms, or their claim upon the custody of the girl.</p>

<p>Intrigue and trickery were more to Mr. Ward's liking, and so he
was quick to alter his plan of campaign the instant that it became
evident that Divine had elected to join forces with the opposing
faction.</p>

<p>"I reckon," he said, directing his remarks toward no one in
particular, "that we've all been rather hasty in this matter, being
het up as we were with the strain of what we been through an' so it
seems to me, takin' into consideration that Mr. Thérière really
done his best to save the ship, an' that as a matter of fact we was
all mighty lucky to come out of it alive, that we'd better let
bygones be bygones, for the time bein' at least, an' all of us
pitch in to save what we can from the wreckage, hunt water, rig up
a camp, an' get things sort o' shipshape here instid o' squabblin'
amongst ourselves."</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," said Thérière, "it's all the same to us," and
his use of the objective pronoun seemed definitely to establish the
existence of his faction as a separate and distinct party.</p>

<p>Simms, from years of experience with his astute mate, was wont
to acquiesce in anything that Ward proposed, though he had not the
brains always to appreciate the purposes that prompted Ward's
suggestions. Now, therefore, he nodded his approval of Squint Eye's
proposal, feeling that whatever was in Ward's mind would be more
likely to work out to Skipper Simms' interests than some unadvised
act of Skipper Simms himself.</p>

<p>"Supposin'," continued Ward, "that we let two o' your men an'
two o' ourn under Mr. Divine, shin up them cliffs back o' the cove
an' search fer water an' a site fer camp&mdash;the rest o' us'll
have our hands full with the salvage."</p>

<p>"Good," agreed Thérière. "Miller, you and Swenson will accompany
Mr. Divine."</p>

<p>Ward detailed two of his men, and the party of five began the
difficult ascent of the cliffs, while far above them a little brown
man with beady, black eyes set in narrow fleshy slits watched them
from behind a clump of bushes. Strange, medieval armor and two
wicked-looking swords gave him a most warlike appearance. His
temples were shaved, and a broad strip on the top of his head to
just beyond the crown. His remaining hair was drawn into an
unbraided queue, tied tightly at the back, and the queue then
brought forward to the top of the forehead. His helmet lay in the
grass at his feet. At the nearer approach of the party to the cliff
top the watcher turned and melted into the forest at his back. He
was Oda Yorimoto, descendant of a powerful daimio of the Ashikaga
Dynasty of shoguns who had fled Japan with his faithful samurai
nearly three hundred and fifty years before upon the overthrow of
the Ashikaga Dynasty.</p>

<p>Upon this unfrequented and distant Japanese isle the exiles had
retained all of their medieval military savagery, to which had been
added the aboriginal ferocity of the head-hunting natives they had
found there and with whom they had intermarried. The little colony,
far from making any advances in arts or letters had, on the
contrary, relapsed into primeval ignorance as deep as that of the
natives with whom they had cast their lot&mdash;only in their arms
and armor, their military training and discipline did they show any
of the influence of their civilized progenitors. They were cruel,
crafty, resourceful wild men trapped in the habiliments of a dead
past, and armed with the keen weapons of their forbears. They had
not even the crude religion of the Malaysians they had absorbed
unless a highly exaggerated propensity for head-hunting might be
dignified by the name of religion. To the tender mercies of such as
these were the castaways of the <i>Halfmoon</i> likely to be
consigned, for what might sixteen men with but four revolvers among
them accomplish against near a thousand savage samurai?</p>

<p><br>
THÉRIÈRE, Ward, Simms, and the remaining sailors at the beach
busied themselves with the task of retrieving such of the wreckage
and the salvage of the <i>Halfmoon</i> as the waves had deposited
in the shallows of the beach. There were casks of fresh water, kegs
of biscuit, clothing, tinned meats, and a similar heterogeneous
mass of flotsam. This arduous labor consumed the best part of the
afternoon, and it was not until it had been completed that Divine
and his party returned to the beach.</p>

<p>They reported that they had discovered a spring of fresh water
some three miles east of the cove and about half a mile inland, but
it was decided that no attempt be made to transport the salvage of
the party to the new camp site until the following morning.</p>

<p>Thérière and Divine erected a rude shelter for Barbara Harding
close under the foot of the cliff, as far from the water as
possible, while above them Oda Yorimoto watched their proceedings
with beady, glittering eyes. This time a half-dozen of his fierce
samurai crouched at his side. Besides their two swords these latter
bore the primitive spears of their mothers' savage tribe.</p>

<p>Oda Yorimoto watched the white men upon the beach. Also, he
watched the white girl&mdash;even more, possibly, than he watched
the men. He saw the shelter that was being built, and when it was
complete he saw the girl enter it, and he knew that it was for her
alone. Oda Yorimoto sucked in his lips and his eyes narrowed even
more than nature had intended that they should.</p>

<p><br>
A FIRE burned before the rude domicile that Barbara Harding was
to occupy, and another, larger fire roared a hundred yards to the
west where the men were congregated about Blanco, who was
attempting to evolve a meal from the miscellany of his larder that
had been cast up by the sea. There seemed now but little to
indicate that the party was divided into two bitter factions, but
when the meal was over Thérière called his men to a point midway
between Barbara's shelter and the main camp fire. Here he directed
them to dispose themselves for the night as best they could,
building a fire of their own if they chose, for with the coming of
darkness the chill of the tropical night would render a fire more
than acceptable.</p>

<p>All were thoroughly tired and exhausted, so that darkness had
scarce fallen ere the entire camp seemed wrapped in slumber. And
still Oda Yorimoto sat with his samurai upon the cliff's summit,
beady eyes fixed upon his intended prey.</p>

<p>For an hour he sat thus in silence, until, assured that all were
asleep before him, he arose and with a few whispered instructions
commenced the descent of the cliff toward the cove below. Scarce
had he started, however, with his men stringing in single file
behind him, than he came to a sudden halt, for below him in the
camp that lay between the girl's shelter and the westerly camp a
figure had arisen stealthily from among his fellows.</p>

<p>It was Thérière. Cautiously he moved to a sleeper nearby whom he
shook gently until he had awakened him.</p>

<p>"Hush, Byrne," cautioned the Frenchman. "It is I, Thérière. Help
me awaken the others&mdash;see that there is no noise."</p>

<p>"Wot's doin'?" queried the mucker.</p>

<p>"We are going to break camp, and occupy the new location before
that bunch of pirates can beat us to it," whispered Thérière in
reply; "and," he added, "we're going to take the salvage and the
girl with us."</p>

<p>The mucker grinned.</p>

<p>"Gee!" he said. "Won't dey be a sore bunch in de mornin'?"</p>

<p>The work of awakening the balance of the party required but a
few minutes and when the plan was explained to them, all seemed
delighted with the prospect of discomfiting Skipper Simms and
Squint Eye. It was decided that only the eatables be carried away
on the first trip, and that if a second trip was possible before
dawn the clothing, canvas, and cordage that had been taken from the
water might then be purloined.</p>

<p>Miller and Swenson were detailed to bring up the rear with Miss
Harding, assisting her up the steep side of the cliff. Divine was
to act as guide to the new camp, lending a hand wherever necessary
in the scaling of the heights with the loot.</p>

<p>Cautiously the party, with the exception of Divine, Miller, and
Swenson, crept toward the little pile of supplies that were heaped
fifty or sixty feet from the sleeping members of Simms' faction.
The three left behind walked in silence to Barbara Harding's
shelter. Here Divine scratched at the piece of sail cloth which
served as a door until he had succeeded in awakening the sleeper
within. And from above Oda Yorimoto watched the activity in the
little cove with intent and unwavering eyes.</p>

<p>The girl, roused from a fitful slumber, came to the doorway of
her primitive abode, alarmed by this nocturnal summons.</p>

<p>"It is I, Larry," whispered the man. "Are you dressed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the girl, stepping out into the moonlight. "What
do you want? What has happened?"</p>

<p>"We are going to take you away from Simms&mdash;Thérière and I,"
replied the man, "and establish a safe camp of our own where they
cannot molest you. Thérière and the others have gone for the
supplies now and as soon as they return we shall commence the
ascent of the cliffs. If you have any further preparations to make,
Barbara, please make haste, as we must get away from here as
quickly as possible. Should any of Simms' people awaken there is
sure to be a fight."</p>

<p>The girl turned back into the shelter to gather together a
handful of wraps that had been saved from the wreck.</p>

<p>Down by the salvage Thérière, Byrne, "Bony" Sawyer, "Red"
Sanders, Blanco, and Wison were selecting the goods that they
wished to carry with them. It was found that two trips would be
necessary to carry off the bulk of the rations, so Thérière sent
the mucker to summon Miller and Swenson.</p>

<p>"We'll carry all that eight of us can to the top of the cliffs,"
he said "hide it there and then come back for the balance. We may
be able to get it later if we are unable to make two trips to the
camp tonight."</p>

<p>While they were waiting for Byrne to return with the two
recruits one of the sleepers in Simms' camp stirred. Instantly the
five marauders dropped stealthily to the ground behind the boxes
and casks. Only Thérière kept his eyes above the level of the top
of their shelter that he might watch the movements of the
enemy.</p>

<p>The figure sat up and looked about. It was Ward. Slowly be arose
and approached the pile of salvage. Thérière drew his revolver,
holding it in readiness for an emergency. Should the first mate
look in the direction of Barbara Harding's shelter he must
certainly see the four figures waiting there in the moonlight.
Thérière turned his own head in the direction of the shelter that
he might see how plainly the men there were visible. To his delight
he saw that no one was in sight. Either they had seen Ward, or for
the sake of greater safety from detection had moved to the opposite
side of the shelter.</p>

<p>Ward was quite close to the boxes upon the other side of which
crouched the night raiders. Thérière's finger found the trigger of
his revolver. He was convinced that the mate had been disturbed by
the movement in camp and was investigating. The Frenchman knew that
the search would not end upon the opposite side of the
salvage&mdash;in a moment Ward would be upon them. He was
sorry&mdash;not for Ward, but because he had planned to carry the
work out quietly and he hated to have to muss things up with a
killing, especially on Barbara's account.</p>

<p>Ward stopped at one of the water casks. He tipped it up, filling
a tin cup with water, took a long drink, set the cup back on top of
the cask, and, turning, retraced his steps to his blanket. Thérière
could have hugged himself. The man had suspected nothing. He merely
had been thirsty and come over for a drink&mdash;in another moment
he would be fast asleep once more. Sure enough, before Byrne
returned with Miller and Swenson, Thérière could hear the snores of
the first mate.</p>

<p>On the first trip to the cliff top eight men carried heavy
burdens, Divine alone remaining to guard Barbara Harding. The
second trip was made with equal dispatch and safety. No sound or
movement came from the camp of the enemy, other than that of
sleeping men. On the second trip Divine and Thérière each carried a
burden up the cliffs, Miller and Swenson following with Barbara
Harding, and as they came Oda Yorimoto and his samurai slunk back
into the shadows that their prey might pass unobserving.</p>

<p>Thérière had the bulk of the loot hidden in a rocky crevice just
beyond the cliff's summit. Brush torn from the mass of luxuriant
tropical vegetation that covered the ground was strewn over the
cache. All had been accomplished in safety and without detection.
The camp beneath them still lay wrapped in silence.</p>

<p>The march toward the new camp, under the guidance of Divine, was
immediately undertaken. On the return trip after the search for
water Divine had discovered a well-marked trail along the edge of
the cliffs to a point opposite the spring, and another leading from
the main trail directly to the water. In his ignorance he had
thought these the runways of animals, whereas they were the age-old
highways of the head-hunters.</p>

<p>Now they presented a comparatively quick and easy approach to
the destination of the mutineers, but so narrow a one as soon to
convince Thérière that it was not feasible for him to move back and
forth along the flank of his column. He had tried it once, but it
so greatly inconvenienced and retarded the heavily laden men that
he abandoned the effort, remaining near the center of the cavalcade
until the new camp was reached.</p>

<p>Here he found a fair-sized space about a clear and plentiful
spring of cold water. Only a few low bushes dotted the grassy
clearing which was almost completely surrounded by dense and
impenetrable jungle. The men had deposited their burdens, and still
Thérière stood waiting for the balance of his party&mdash;Miller
and Swenson with Barbara Harding.</p>

<p>But they did not come, and when, in alarm, the entire party
started back in search of them they retraced their steps to the
very brink of the declivity leading to the cove before they could
believe the testimony of their own perceptions&mdash;Barbara
Harding and the two sailors had disappeared.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa10" id="chapa10">X. &mdash; BARBARA CAPTURED BY
HEAD-HUNTERS</a></h2>

<p class="first">When Barbara Harding, with Miller before and
Swenson behind her, had taken up the march behind the loot-laden
party seven dusky, noiseless shadows had emerged from the forest to
follow close behind.</p>

<p>For half a mile the party moved along the narrow trail
unmolested. Thérière had come back to exchange a half-dozen words
with the girl and had again moved forward toward the head of the
column. Miller was not more than twenty-five feet behind the first
man ahead of him, and Miss Harding and Swenson followed at
intervals of but three or four yards.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without warning, Swenson and Miller fell, pierced with
savage spears, and at the same instant sinewy fingers gripped
Barbara Harding, and a silencing hand was clapped over her mouth.
There had been no sound above the muffled tread of the seamen. It
had all been accomplished so quickly and so easily that the girl
did not comprehend what had befallen her for several minutes.</p>

<p>In the darkness of the forest she could not clearly distinguish
the forms or features of her abductors, though she reasoned, as was
only natural, that Skipper Simms' party had become aware of the
plot against them and had taken this means of thwarting a part of
it; but when her captors turned directly into the mazes of the
jungle, away from the coast, she began first to wonder and then to
doubt, so that presently when a small clearing let the moonlight
full upon them she was not surprised to discover that none of the
members of the <i>Halfmoon</i>'s company was among her guard.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding had not circled the globe half a dozen times for
nothing. There were few races or nations with whose history, past
and present, she was not fairly familiar, and so the sight that
greeted her eyes was well suited to fill her with astonishment, for
she found herself in the hands of what appeared to be a party of
Japanese warriors of the fifteenth or sixteenth century. She
recognized the medieval arms and armor, the ancient helmets, the
hairdressing of the two-sworded men of old Japan. At the belts of
two of her captors dangled grisly trophies of the hunt. In the
moonlight she saw that they were the heads of Miller and
Swenson.</p>

<p>The girl was horrified. She had thought her lot before as bad as
it could be, but to be in the clutches of these strange, fierce
warriors of a long-dead age was unthinkably worse. That she could
ever have wished to be back upon the <i>Halfmoon</i> would have
seemed, a few days since, incredible; yet that was precisely what
she longed for now.</p>

<p class="caption">Horrified, the girl realised that she was in
the<br>
clutches of fierce warriors of a long-dead age.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>On through the night marched the little, brown men&mdash;grim
and silent&mdash;until at last they came to a small village in a
valley away from the coast&mdash;a valley that lay nestled high
among lofty mountains. Here were cavelike dwellings burrowed half
under ground, the upper walls and thatched roofs rising scarce four
feet above the level. Granaries on stilts were dotted here and
there among the dwellings.</p>

<p>Into one of the filthy dens Barbara Harding was dragged. She
found a single room in which several native and halfcaste women
were sleeping, about them stretched and curled and perched a motley
throng of dirty yellow children, dogs, pigs, and chickens. It was
the palace of Daimio Oda Yorimoto, Lord of Yoka, as his ancestors
had christened their new island home.</p>

<p>Once within the warren the two samurai who had guarded Barbara
upon the march turned and withdrew&mdash;she was alone with Oda
Yorimoto and his family. From the center of the room depended a
swinging shelf upon which a great pile of grinning skulls rested.
At the back of the room was a door which Barbara had not at first
noticed&mdash;evidently there was another apartment to the
dwelling.</p>

<p>The girl was given little opportunity to examine her new prison,
for scarce had the guards withdrawn than Oda Yorimoto approached
and grasped her by the arm.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said, in Japanese that was sufficiently similar to
modern Nippon to be easily understood by Barbara Harding. With the
word he drew her toward a sleeping mat on a raised platform at one
side of the room.</p>

<p>One of the women awoke at the sound of the man's voice. She
looked up at Barbara in sullen hatred&mdash;otherwise she gave no
indication that she saw anything unusual transpiring. It was as
though an exquisite American belle were a daily visitor at the Oda
Yorimoto home.</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?" cried the frightened girl, in
Japanese.</p>

<p>Oda Yorimoto looked at her in astonishment. Where had this white
girl learned to speak his tongue?</p>

<p>"I am the daimio, Oda Yorimoto," he said. "These are my wives.
Now you are one of them. Come!"</p>

<p>"Not yet&mdash;not here!" cried the girl clutching at a straw.
"Wait. Give me time to think. If you do not harm me my father will
reward you fabulously. Ten thousand <i>koku</i> he would gladly
give to have me returned to him safely."</p>

<p>Oda Yorimoto but shook his head.</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand <i>koku</i>!" cried the girl.</p>

<p>Still the daimio shook his head negatively.</p>

<p>"A hundred thousand&mdash;name your own price, if you will but
not harm me."</p>

<p>"Silence!" growled the man. "What are even a million <i>koku</i>
to me who only know the word from the legends of my ancestors. We
have no need for <i>koku</i> here, and had we, my hills are full of
the yellow metal which measures its value. No! you are my woman.
Come!"</p>

<p>"Not here! Not here!" pleaded the girl. "There is another
room&mdash;away from all these women," and she turned her eyes
toward the door at the opposite side of the chamber.</p>

<p>Oda Yorimoto shrugged his shoulders. That would be easier than a
fight, he argued, and so he led the girl toward the doorway that
she had indicated. Within the room all was dark, but the daimio
moved as one accustomed to the place, and as he moved through the
blackness the girl at his side felt with stealthy fingers at the
man's belt.</p>

<p>At last Oda Yorimoto reached the far side of the long
chamber.</p>

<p>"Here!" he said, and took her by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Here!" answered the girl in a low, tense voice, and at the
instant that she spoke Oda Yorimoto, Lord of Yoka, felt a quick tug
at his belt, and before he guessed what was to happen his own short
sword had pierced his breast.</p>

<p>A single shriek broke from the lips of the daimio; but it was so
high and shrill and like the shriek of a woman in mortal terror
that the woman in the next room who heard it but smiled a crooked,
wicked smile of hate and turned once more upon her pallet to
sleep.</p>

<p>Again and again Barbara Harding plunged the sword of the brown
man into the still heart, until she knew beyond peradventure of a
doubt that her enemy was forevermore powerless to injure her. Then
she sank, exhausted and trembling, upon the dirt floor beside the
corpse.</p>

<p><br>
WHEN Thérière came to the realization that Barbara Harding was
gone he jumped to the natural conclusion that Ward and Simms had
discovered the ruse that he had worked upon them just in time to
permit them to intercept Miller and Swenson with the girl, and
carry her back to the main camp.</p>

<p>The others were prone to agree with him, though the mucker
grumbled that "it listened fishy." However, all hands returned
cautiously down the face of the cliff, expecting momentarily to be
attacked by the guards which they felt sure Ward would post in
expectation of a return of the mutineers, the moment they
discovered that the girl had been taken from them; but to the
surprise of all they reached the cove without molestation, and when
they had crept cautiously to the vicinity of the sleepers they
discovered that all were there, in peaceful slumber, just as they
had left them a few hours before.</p>

<p>Silently the party retraced its steps up the cliff. Thérière and
Billy Byrne brought up the rear.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it anyway, Byrne?" asked the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"If you wanta get it straight, cul," replied the mucker, "I tink
youse know a whole lot more about it dan you'd like to have de rest
of us tink."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Byrne?" cried Thérière. "Out with it
now!"</p>

<p>"Sure I'll out wid it. You didn't tink I was bashful didja? Wot
fer did you detail dem two pikers, Miller and Swenson, to guard de
skirt fer if it wasn't fer some special frame-up of yer own? Dey
never been in our gang, and dats just wot you wanted 'em fer. It
was easy to tip dem off to hike out wid de squab, and de first
chanct you get you'll hike after dem, while we hold de bag. Tought
you'd double-cross us easy, didn't yeh? Yeh cheap-skate!"</p>

<p>"Byrne," said Thérière, and it was easy to see that only through
the strength of his will-power did he keep his temper, "you may
have cause to suspect the motives of everyone connected with this
outfit. I can't say that I blame you; but I want you to remember
what I say to you now. There was a time when I fully intended to
'double-cross' you, as you say&mdash;that was before you saved my
life. Since then I have been on the square with you not only in
deed but in thought as well. I give you the word of a man whose
word once meant something&mdash;I am playing square with you now
except in one thing, and I shall tell you what that is at once. I
do not know where Miss Harding is, or what has happened to her, and
Miller, and Swenson. That is God's truth. Now for the one thing
that I just mentioned. Recently I changed my intentions relative to
Miss Harding. I was after the money the same as the rest&mdash;that
I am free to admit; but now I don't give a rap for it, and I had
intended taking advantage of the first opportunity to return Miss
Harding to civilization unharmed and without the payment of a penny
to anyone. The reason for my change of heart is my own affair. In
all probability you wouldn't believe the sincerity or honesty of my
motives should I disclose them. I am only telling you these things
because you have accused me of double dealing, and I do not want
the man who saved my life at the risk of his own to have the
slightest grounds to doubt my honesty with him. I've been a fairly
bad egg, Byrne, for a great many years; but, by George! I'm not
entirely rotten yet."</p>

<p>Byrne was silent for a few moments. He, too, had recently come
to the conclusion that possibly he was not entirely rotten either,
and had in a vague and half-formed sort of way wished for the
opportunity to demonstrate the fact, so he was willing to concede
to another that which he craved for himself.</p>

<p>"Yeh listen all right, cul," he said at last; "an' I'm willin'
to take yeh at yer own say-so until I learn different."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Thérière tersely. "Now we can work together in
the search for Miss Harding; but where, in the name of all that's
holy, are we to start?"</p>

<p>"Why, where we seen her last, of course," replied the mucker.
"Right here on top of dese bluffs."</p>

<p>"Then we can't do anything until daylight," said the
Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Not a ting, and at daylight we'll most likely have a scrap on
our hands from below," and the mucker jerked his thumb in the
direction of the cove.</p>

<p>"I think," said Thérière, "that we had better spend an hour
arming ourselves with sticks and stones. We've a mighty good
position up here. One that we can defend splendidly from an assault
from below, and if we are prepared for them we can stave 'em off
for a while if we need the time to search about up here for clews
to Miss Harding's whereabouts."</p>

<p>And so the party set to work to cut stout bludgeons from the
trees about them, and pile loose fragments of rock in handy places
near the cliff top. Thérière even went so far as to throw up a low
breastwork across the top of the trail up which the enemy must
climb to reach the summit of the cliff. When they had completed
their preparations three men could have held the place against ten
times their own number.</p>

<p>Then they lay down to sleep, leaving Blanco and Divine on guard,
for it had been decided that these two, with "Bony" Sawyer, should
be left behind on the morrow to hold the cliff top while the others
were searching for clews to the whereabouts of Barbara Harding.
They were to relieve each other at guard duty during the balance of
the night.</p>

<p><br>
SCARCE had the first suggestion of dawn lightened the eastern
sky than Divine, who was again on guard, awakened Thérière. In a
moment the others were aroused, and a hasty raid on the cached
provisions made. The lack of water was keenly felt by all, but it
was too far to the spring to chance taking the time necessary to
fetch the much-craved fluid and those who were to forge into the
jungle in search of Barbara Harding hoped to find water farther
inland, while it was decided to dispatch "Bony" Sawyer to the
spring for water for those who were to remain on guard at the cliff
top.</p>

<p>A hurried breakfast was made on water-soaked ship's biscuit.
Thérière and his searching party stuffed their pockets full of
them, and a moment later the search was on. First the men traversed
the trail toward the spring, looking for indications of the spot
where Barbara Harding had ceased to follow them. The girl had worn
heelless buckskin shoes at the time she was taken from the
<i>Lotus</i>, and these left little or no spoor in the well-tramped
earth of the narrow path; but a careful and minute examination on
the part of Thérière finally resulted in the detection of a single
small footprint a hundred yards from the point they had struck the
trail after ascending the cliffs. This far at least she had been
with them.</p>

<p>The men now spread out upon either side of the
track&mdash;Thérière and "Red" Sanders upon one side, Byrne and
Wison upon the other. Occasionally Thérière would return to the
trail to search for further indications of the spoor they
sought.</p>

<p>The party had proceeded in this fashion for nearly half a mile
when suddenly they were attracted by a low exclamation from the
mucker.</p>

<p>"Here!" he called. "Here's Miller an' the Swede, an' they sure
have mussed 'em up turrible."</p>

<p>The others hastened in the direction of his voice, to come to a
horrified halt at the sides of the headless trunks of the two
sailors.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" exclaimed the Frenchman, reverting to his
mother tongue as he never did except under the stress of great
excitement.</p>

<p>"Who done it?" queried "Red" Sanders, looking suspiciously at
the mucker.</p>

<p>"Head-hunters," said Thérière. "God! What an awful fate for that
poor girl!"</p>

<p>Billy Byrne went white.</p>

<p>"Yeh don't mean dat dey've lopped off her block?" he whispered
in an awed voice. Something strange rose in the mucker's breast at
the thought he had just voiced. He did not attempt to analyze the
sensation; but it was far from joy at the suggestion that the woman
he so hated had met a horrible and disgusting death at the hands of
savages.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not, Byrne," said Thérière, in a voice that none
there would have recognized as that of the harsh and masterful
second officer of the <i>Halfmoon</i>.</p>

<p>"Yer afraid not!" echoed Billy Byrne, in amazement.</p>

<p>"For her sake I hope that they did," said Thérière; "for such as
she it would have been a far less horrible fate than the one I fear
they have reserved her for."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" queried Byrne, and then he stopped, for the
realization of just what Thérière did mean swept over him quite
suddenly.</p>

<p>There was no particular reason why Billy Byrne should have felt
toward women the finer sentiments which are so cherished a
possession of those men who have been gently born and raised, even
after they have learned that all women are not as was the feminine
ideal of their boyhood.</p>

<p>Billy's mother, always foul-mouthed and quarrelsome, had been a
veritable demon when drunk, and drunk she had been whenever she
could, by hook or crook, raise the price of whiskey. Never, to
Billy's recollection, had she spoken a word of endearment to him;
and so terribly had she abused him that even while he was yet a
little boy, scarce out of babyhood, he had learned to view her with
a hatred as deep-rooted as is the affection of most little children
for their mothers.</p>

<p>When he had come to man's estate he had defended himself from
the woman's brutal assaults as he would have defended himself from
another man&mdash;when she had struck, Billy had struck back; the
only thing to his credit being that he never had struck her except
in self-defense. Chastity in woman was to him a thing to joke
of&mdash;he did not believe that it existed; for he judged other
women by the one he knew best&mdash;his mother. And as he hated
her, so he hated them all. He had doubly hated Barbara Harding
since she not only was a woman, but a woman of the class he
loathed.</p>

<p>And so it was strange and inexplicable that the suggestion of
the girl's probable fate should have affected Billy Byrne as it
did. He did not stop to reason about it at all&mdash;he simply knew
that he felt a mad and unreasoning rage against the creatures that
had borne the girl away. Outwardly Billy showed no indication of
the turmoil that raged within his breast.</p>

<p>"We gotta find her, bo," he said to Thérière. "We gotta find the
skirt."</p>

<p>Ordinarily Billy would have blustered about the terrible things
he would do to the objects of his wrath when once he had them in
his power; but now he was strangely quiet&mdash;only the firm set
of his strong chin, and the steely glitter of his gray eyes gave
token of the iron resolution within.</p>

<p>Thérière, who had been walking slowly to and fro about the dead
men, now called the others to him.</p>

<p>"Here's their trail," he said. "If it's as plain as that all the
way we won't be long in overhauling them. Come along."</p>

<p>Before he had the words half out of his mouth the mucker was
forging ahead through the jungle along the well-marked spoor of the
samurai.</p>

<p>"Wot kind of men do you suppose they are?" asked "Red"
Sanders.</p>

<p>"Malaysian head-hunters, unquestionably," replied Thérière.</p>

<p>"Red" Sanders shuddered inwardly. The appellation had a most
gruesome sound.</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried Thérière, and started off after the mucker, who
already was out of sight in the thick forest.</p>

<p>"Red" Sanders and Wison took a few steps after the Frenchman.
Thérière turned once to see that they were following him, and then
a turn in the trail hid them from his view. "Red" Sanders
stopped.</p>

<p>"Damme if I'm goin' to get my coconut hacked off on any such
wild-goose chase as this," he said to Wison.</p>

<p>"The girl's more'n likely dead long ago," said the other.</p>

<p>"Sure she is," returned "Red" Sanders, "an' if we go buttin'
into that there thicket we'll be dead too. Ugh! Poor Miller. Poor
Swenson. It's orful. Did you see wot they done to 'em beside
cuttin' off their heads?"</p>

<p>"Yes," whispered Wison, looking suddenly behind him.</p>

<p>"Red" Sanders gave a little start, peering in the direction that
his companion had looked.</p>

<p>"Wot was it?" he whimpered. "Wot did you do that fer?"</p>

<p>"I thought I seen something move there," replied Wison. "Fer
Gawd's sake let's get outen this," and without waiting for a word
of assent from his companion the sailor turned and ran at breakneck
speed along the little path toward the spot where Divine, Blanco,
and "Bony" Sawyer were stationed. When they arrived "Bony" was just
on the point of setting out for the spring to fetch water, but at
sight of the frightened, breathless men he returned to hear their
story.</p>

<p>"What's up?" shouted Divine. "You men look as though you'd seen
a ghost. Where are the others?"</p>

<p>"They're all murdered, and their heads cut off," cried "Red"
Sanders. "We found the bunch that got Miller, Swenson, and the
girl. They'd killed 'em all and was eatin' of 'em when we jumps
'em. Before we knew wot had happened about a thousand more of the
devils came runnin' up. They got us separated, and when we seen
Thérière and Byrne kilt we jest natch'rally beat it. Gawd, but it
was orful."</p>

<p>"Do you think they will follow you?" asked Divine.</p>

<p>At the suggestion every head turned toward the trail down which
the two panic-stricken men had just come. At the same moment a
hoarse shout arose from the cove below and the five looked down to
see a scene of wild activity upon the beach. The defection of
Thérière's party had been discovered, as well as the absence of the
girl and the theft of the provisions.</p>

<p>Skipper Simms was dancing about like a madman. His bellowed
oaths rolled up the cliffs like thunder. Presently Ward caught a
glimpse of the men at the top of the cliff above him.</p>

<p>"There they are!" he cried.</p>

<p>Skipper Simms looked up.</p>

<p>"The swabs!" he shrieked. "A-stealin' of our grub, an' abductin'
of that there pore girl. The swabs! Lemme to 'em, I say; jest lemme
to 'em."</p>

<p>"We'd all better go to 'em," said Ward. "We've got a fight on
here sure. Gather up some rocks, men, an' come along. Skipper,
you're too fat to do any fightin' on that there hillside, so you
better stay here an' let one o' the men take your gun," for Ward
knew so well the mettle of his superior that he much preferred his
absence to his presence in the face of real fighting, and with the
gun in the hands of a braver man it would be vastly more
effective.</p>

<p>Ward himself was no lover of a fight, but he saw now that
starvation might stare them in the face with their food gone, and
everything be lost with the loss of the girl. For food and money a
much more cowardly man than Bender Ward would fight to the
death.</p>

<p>Up the face of the cliff they hurried, expecting momentarily to
be either challenged or fired upon by those above them. Divine and
his party looked down with mixed emotions upon those who were
ascending in so threatening a manner. They found themselves truly
between the devil and the deep sea.</p>

<p>Ward and his men were halfway up the cliff, yet Divine had made
no move to repel them. He glanced timorously toward the dark forest
behind from which he momentarily expected to see the savage,
snarling faces of the head-hunters appear.</p>

<p>"Surrender! You swabs," called Ward from below, "or we'll string
the last mother's son of you to the yardarm."</p>

<p>For reply Blanco hurled a heavy fragment of rock at the
assaulters. It grazed perilously close to Ward, against whom Blanco
cherished a keen hatred. Instantly Ward's revolver barked, the
bullet whistling close by Divine's head. L. Cortwrite Divine,
cotillion leader, ducked behind Thérière's breastwork, where he lay
sprawled upon his belly, trembling in terror.</p>

<p>"Bony" Sawyer and "Red" Sanders followed the example of their
commander. Blanco and Wison alone made any attempt to repel the
assault. The big Negro ran to Divine's side and snatched the
terror-stricken man's revolver from his belt. Then turning he fired
at Ward. The bullet, missing its intended victim, pierced the heart
of a sailor directly behind him, and as the man crumpled to the
ground, rolling down the steep declivity, his fellows sought
cover.</p>

<p>Wison followed up the advantage with a shower of well-aimed
missiles, and then hostilities ceased temporarily.</p>

<p>"Have they gone?" queried Divine, with trembling lips, noticing
the quiet that followed the shot.</p>

<p>"Gone nothin'," yo big cowahd," replied Blanco. "Do yo done
suppose dat two men is a-gwine to stan' off five? Ef yo
white-livered skunks 'ud git up an' fight we might have a chanct.
I'se a good min' to cut out yo cowahdly heart fer yo, das wot I
has&mdash;a-lyin' der on yo belly settin' dat kin' o' example to yo
men!"</p>

<p>Divine's terror had placed him beyond the reach of contumely or
reproach.</p>

<p>"What's the use of fighting them?" he whimpered. "We should
never have left them. It's all the fault of that fool Thérière.
What can we do against the savages of this awful island if we
divide our forces? They will pick us off a few at a time just as
they picked off Miller and Swenson, Thérière and Byrne. We ought to
tell Ward about it, and call this foolish battle off."</p>

<p>"Now you're talkin'," cried "Bony" Sawyer. "I'm not a-goin' to
squat up here any longer with my friends a-shootin' at me from
below an' a lot of wild heathen creeping down on me from above to
cut off my bloomin' head."</p>

<p>"Same here!" chimed in "Red" Sanders.</p>

<p>Blanco looked toward Wison. For his own part the Negro would not
have been averse to returning to the fold could the thing be
accomplished without danger of reprisal on the part of Skipper
Simms and Ward; but he knew the men so well that he feared to trust
them even should they seemingly acquiesce to any such proposal. On
the other hand, he reasoned, it would be as much to their advantage
to have the deserters return to them as it would to the deserters
themselves, for when they had heard the story told by "Red" Sanders
and Wison of the murder of the others of the party they too would
realize the necessity for maintaining the strength of the little
company to its fullest.</p>

<p>"I don't see that we're goin' to gain nothin' by fightin' 'em,"
said Wison. "There ain't nothin' in it any more nohow for nobody
since the girl's gorn. Let's chuck it, an' see wot terms we can
make with Squint Eye."</p>

<p>"Well," grumbled the Negro, "I can't fight 'em alone; What yo
doin' dere, 'Bony?'"</p>

<p>During the conversation "Bony" Sawyer had been busy with a stick
and a piece of rag, and now as he turned toward his companions once
more they saw that he had rigged a white flag of surrender. None
interfered as he raised it above the edge of the breastwork.</p>

<p>Immediately there was a hail from below. It was Ward's
voice.</p>

<p>"Surrenderin', eh? Comin' to your senses, are you?" he
shouted.</p>

<p>Divine, feeling that immediate danger from bullets was past,
raised his head above the edge of the earthwork.</p>

<p>"We have something to communicate, Mr. Ward," he called.</p>

<p>"Spit it out, then; I'm a-listenin'," called back the mate.</p>

<p>"Miss Harding, Mr. Thérière, Byrne, Miller, and Swenson have
been captured and killed by native head-hunters," said Divine.</p>

<p>Ward's eyes went wide, and he blew out his cheeks in surprise.
Then his face went black with an angry scowl.</p>

<p>"You see what you done now, you blitherin' fools, you!" he
cried, "with your funny business? You gone an' killed the goose
what laid the golden eggs. Thought you'd get it all, didn't you?
and now nobody won't get nothin', unless it is the halter. Nice lot
o' numbskulls you be, an' whimperin' 'round now expectin' of us to
take you back&mdash;well, I reckon not, not on your measly lives,"
and with that he raised his revolver to fire again at Divine.</p>

<p>The society man toppled over backward into the pit behind the
breastwork before Ward had a chance to pull the trigger.</p>

<p>"Hol' on there mate!" cried "Bony" Sawyer; "there ain't no call
now fer gettin' excited. Wait until you hear all we gotta say. You
can't blame us pore sailormen. It was this here fool dude and that
scoundrel Thérière that put us up to it. They told us that you an'
Skipper Simms was a-fixin' to doublecross us all an' leave us here
to starve on this Gawd-forsaken islan'. Thérière said that he was
with you when you planned it. That you wanted to git rid o' as many
of us as you could so that you'd have more of the ransom to divide.
So all we done was in self-defense, as it were.</p>

<p>"Why not let bygones be bygones, an' all of us join forces
ag'in' these murderin' heathen? There won't be any too many of us
at best&mdash; "Red" an' Wison seen more'n two thousan' of the
man-eatin' devils. They're a-creepin' up on us from behin' right
this minute, an' you can lay to that; an' the chances are that they
got some special kind o' route into that there cove, an' maybe
they're a-watchin' of you right now!"</p>

<p>Ward turned an apprehensive glance to either side. There was
logic in "Bony's" proposal. They couldn't spare a man now. Later he
could punish the offenders at his leisure&mdash;when he didn't need
them any further.</p>

<p>"Will you swear on the Book to do your duty by Skipper Simms an'
me if we take you back?" asked Ward.</p>

<p>"You bet," answered "Bony" Sawyer.</p>

<p>The others nodded their heads, and Divine sprang up and started
down toward Ward.</p>

<p>"Hol' on you!" commanded the mate. "This here arrangement don'
include you&mdash;it's jes' between Skipper Simms an' his sailors.
You're a rank outsider, an' you butts in an' starts a mutiny. Ef
you come back you gotta stand trial fer that&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>"You better duck, mister," advised "Red" Sanders; "they'll hang
you sure."</p>

<p>Divine went white. To face trial before two such men as Simms
and Ward meant death, of that he was positive. To flee into the
forest meant death, almost equally certain, and much more horrible.
The man went to his knees, lifting supplicating hands to the
mate.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Mr. Ward," he cried, "be merciful. I was led
into this by Thérière. He lied to me just as he did to the men. You
can't kill me&mdash;it would be murder&mdash;they'd hang you for
it."</p>

<p>"We'll hang for this muss you got us into anyway, if we're ever
caught," growled the mate. "Ef you hadn't a-carried the girl off to
be murdered we might have had enough ransom money to have got clear
some way, but now you gone and cooked the whole goose fer the lot
of us."</p>

<p>"You can collect ransom on me," cried Divine, clutching at a
straw. "I'll pay a hundred thousand myself the day you set me down
in a civilized port, safe and free."</p>

<p>Ward laughed in his face.</p>

<p>"You ain't got a cent, you four-flusher," he cried. "Clinker put
us next to that long before we sailed from Frisco."</p>

<p>"Clinker lies," cried Divine. "He doesn't know anything about
it&mdash;I'm rich."</p>

<p>"Wot's de use ob chewin' de rag 'bout all dis," cried Blanco,
seeing where he might square himself with Ward and Simms easily.
"Does yo' take back all us sailormen, Mr. Ward, an' promise not t'
punish none o' us, ef we swear to stick by yo' all in de
future?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the mate.</p>

<p>Blanco took a step toward Divine.</p>

<p>"Den yo come along too as a prisoner, white man," and the burly
black grasped Divine by the scruff of the neck and forced him
before him down the steep trail toward the cove, and so the
mutineers returned to the command of Skipper Simms, and L.
Cortwrite Divine went with them as a prisoner, charged with a crime
the punishment for which has been death since men sailed the
seas.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa11" id="chapa11">XI. &mdash; THE VILLAGE OF
YOKA</a></h2>

<p class="first">For several minutes Barbara Harding lay where she
had collapsed after the keen short sword of the daimio had freed
her from the menace of his lust.</p>

<p>She was in a half-stupor that took cognizance only of a freezing
terror and exhaustion. Presently, however, she became aware of her
contact with the corpse beside her, and with a stifled cry she
shrank away from it.</p>

<p>Slowly the girl regained her self-control and with it came the
realization of the extremity of her danger. She rose to a sitting
posture and turned her wide eyes toward the doorway to the
adjoining room&mdash;the women and children seemed yet wrapped in
slumber. It was evident that the man's scream had not disturbed
them.</p>

<p>Barbara gained her feet and moved softly to the doorway. She
wondered if she could cross the intervening space to the outer exit
without detection. Once in the open she could flee to the jungle,
and then there was a chance at least that she might find her way to
the coast and Thérière.</p>

<p>She gripped the short sword which she still held, and took a
step into the larger room. One of the women turned and half roused
from sleep. The girl shrank back into the darkness of the chamber
she had just quitted. The woman sat up and looked around. Then she
rose and threw some sticks upon the fire that burned at one side of
the dwelling. She crossed to a shelf and took down a cooking
utensil. Barbara saw that she was about to commence the preparation
of breakfast.</p>

<p>All hope of escape was thus ended, and the girl cautiously
closed the door between the two rooms. Then she felt about the
smaller apartment for some heavy object with which to barricade
herself; but her search was fruitless. Finally she bethought
herself of the corpse. That would hold the door against the
accident of a child or dog pushing it open&mdash;it would be better
than nothing, but could she bring herself to touch the loathsome
thing?</p>

<p>The instinct of self-preservation will work wonders even with a
frail and delicate woman. Barbara Harding steeled herself to the
task, and after several moments of effort she succeeded in rolling
the dead man against the door. The scraping sound of the body as
she dragged it into position had sent cold shivers running up her
spine.</p>

<p>She had removed the man's long sword and armor before attempting
to move him, and now she crouched beside the corpse with both the
swords beside her&mdash;she would sell her life dearly. Thérière's
words came back to her now as they had when she was struggling in
the water after the wreck of the <i>Halfmoon</i>: "but, by George,
I intend to go down fighting." Well, she could do no less.</p>

<p>She could hear the movement of several persons in the next room
now. The voices of women and children came to her distinctly. Many
of the words were Japanese, but others were of a tongue with which
she was not familiar.</p>

<p>Presently her own chamber began to lighten. She looked over her
shoulder and saw the first faint rays of dawn showing through a
small aperture near the roof and at the opposite end of the room.
She rose and moved quickly toward it. By standing on tiptoe and
pulling herself up a trifle with her hands upon the sill she was
able to raise her eyes above the bottom of the window frame.</p>

<p>Beyond she saw the forest, not a hundred yards away; but when
she attempted to crawl through the opening she discovered to her
chagrin that it was too small to permit the passage of her body.
And then there came a knocking on the door she had just quitted,
and a woman's voice calling her lord and master to his morning
meal.</p>

<p>Barbara ran quickly across the chamber to the door, the long
sword raised above her head in both hands. Again the woman knocked,
this time much louder, and raised her voice as she called again
upon Oda Yorimoto to come out.</p>

<p>The girl within was panic-stricken. What should she do? With but
a little respite she might enlarge the window sufficiently to
permit her to escape into the forest, but the woman at the door
evidently would not be denied. Suddenly an inspiration came to her.
It was a forlorn hope, but well worth putting to the test.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she hissed through the closed door. "Oda Yorimoto
sleeps. It is his wish that he be not disturbed."</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence beyond the door, and then the
woman grunted, and Barbara heard her turn back, muttering to
herself. The girl breathed a deep sigh of relief&mdash;she had
received a brief reprieve from death.</p>

<p>Again she turned to the window, where, with the short sword, she
commenced her labor of enlarging it to permit the passage of her
body. The work was necessarily slow because of the fact that it
must proceed with utter noiselessness.</p>

<p>For an hour she worked, and then again came an interruption at
the door. This time it was a man.</p>

<p>"Oda Yorimoto still sleeps," whispered the girl. "Go away and do
not disturb him. He will be very angry if you awaken him."</p>

<p>But the man would not be put off so easily as had the woman. He
still insisted.</p>

<p>"The daimio has ordered that there shall be a great hunt today
for the heads of the <i>sei-yo-jin</i> who have landed upon Yoka,"
persisted the man. "He will be angry indeed if we do not call him
in time to accomplish the task today. Let me speak with him, woman.
I do not believe that Oda Yorimoto still sleeps. Why should I
believe one of the <i>sei-yo-jin</i>? It may be that you have
bewitched the daimio," and with that he pushed against the
door.</p>

<p>The corpse gave a little, and the man glued his eyes to the
aperture. Barbara held the sword behind her, and with her shoulder
against the door attempted to reclose it.</p>

<p>"Go away!" she cried. "I shall be killed if you awaken Oda
Yorimoto, and, if you enter, you, too, shall be killed."</p>

<p>The man stepped back from the door, and Barbara could hear him
in low converse with some of the women of the household. A moment
later he returned, and without a word of warning threw his whole
weight against the portal. The corpse slipped back enough to permit
the entrance of the man's body, and as he stumbled into the room
the long sword of the Lord of Yoka fell full and keen across the
back of his brown neck.</p>

<p>Without a sound he lunged to the floor, dead; but the women
without had caught a fleeting glimpse of what had taken place
within the little chamber, even before Barbara Harding could slam
the door again, and with shrieks of rage and fright they rushed
into the main street of the village shouting at the tops of their
voices that Oda Yorimoto and Hawa Nisho had been slain by the woman
of the <i>sei-yo-jin</i>.</p>

<p>Instantly, the village swarmed with samurai, women, children,
and dogs. They rushed toward the hut of Oda Yorimoto, filling the
outer chamber where they jabbered excitedly for several minutes,
the warriors attempting to obtain a coherent story from the moaning
women of the daimio's household.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding crouched close to the door, listening. She knew
that the crucial moment was at hand; that there were at best but a
few moments for her to live. A silent prayer rose from her parted
lips. She placed the sharp point of Oda Yorimoto's short sword
against her breast, and waited&mdash;waited for the coming of the
men from the room beyond, snatching a few brief seconds from
eternity ere she drove the weapon into her heart.</p>

<p><br>
THÉRIÈRE plunged through the jungle at a run for several minutes
before he caught sight of the mucker.</p>

<p>"Are you still on the trail?" he called to the man before
him.</p>

<p>"Sure," replied Byrne. "It's dead easy. They must o' been at
least a dozen of 'em. Even a mutt like me couldn't miss it."</p>

<p>"We want to go carefully, Byrne," cautioned Thérière. "I've had
experience with these fellows before, and I can tell you that you
never know when one of 'em is near you till you feel a spear in
your back, unless you're almighty watchful. We've got to make all
the haste we can, of course, but it won't help Miss Harding any if
we rush into an ambush and get our heads lopped off."</p>

<p>Byrne saw the wisdom of his companion's advice and tried to
profit by it; but something which seemed to dominate him today
carried him ahead at reckless, breakneck speed&mdash;the flight of
an eagle would have been all too slow to meet the requirements of
his unaccountable haste.</p>

<p>Once he found himself wondering why he was risking his life to
avenge or rescue this girl whom be hated so. He tried to think that
it was for the ransom&mdash;yes, that was it, the ransom. If he
found her alive, and rescued her he should claim the lion's share
of the booty.</p>

<p>Thérière too wondered why Byrne, of all the other men upon the
<i>Halfmoon</i> the last that he should have expected to risk a
thing for the sake of Miss Harding, should be the foremost in
pursuit of her captors.</p>

<p>"I wonder how far behind Sanders and Wison are," he remarked to
Byrne after they had been on the trail for the better part of an
hour. "Hadn't we better wait for them to catch up with us? Four can
do a whole lot more than two."</p>

<p>"Not wen Billy Byrne's one of de two," replied the mucker, and
continued doggedly along the trail.</p>

<p>Another half-hour brought them suddenly in sight of a native
village, and Billy Byrne was for dashing straight into the center
of it and "cleaning it up," as he put it, but Thérière put his foot
down firmly on that proposition, and finally Byrne saw that the
other was right.</p>

<p>"The trail leads straight toward that place," said Thérière, "so
I suppose here is where they brought her, but which of the huts
she's in now we ought to try to determine before we make any
attempt to rescue her. Well, by George! Now what do you think of
that?"</p>

<p>"Tink o' wot?" asked the mucker. "Wot's eatin' yeh?"</p>

<p>"See those three men down there in the village, Byrne?" asked
the Frenchman. "They're no more aboriginal headhunters than I
am&mdash;they're Japs, man. There must be something wrong with our
trailing, for it's as certain as fate itself that Japs are not
head-hunters."</p>

<p>"There ain't been nothin' fony about our trailin', bo," insisted
Byrne, "an' whether Japs are bean collectors or not here's where de
ginks dat copped de doll hiked fer, an if dey ain't dere now it's
because dey went t'rough an' out de odder side, see."</p>

<p>"Hush, Byrne," whispered Thérière. "Drop down behind this bush.
Someone is coming along this other trail to the right of us," and
as he spoke he dragged the mucker down beside him.</p>

<p>For a moment they crouched, breathless and expectant, and then
the slim figure of an almost nude boy emerged from the foliage
close beside and entered the trail toward the village. Upon his
head he bore a bundle of firewood.</p>

<p>When he was directly opposite the watchers Thérière sprang
suddenly upon him, clapping a silencing hand over the boy's mouth.
In Japanese he whispered a command for silence.</p>

<p>"We shall not harm you if you keep still," he said, "and answer
our questions truthfully. What village is that?"</p>

<p>"It is the chief city of Oda Yorimoto, Lord of Yoka," replied
the youth. "I am Oda Iseka, his son."</p>

<p>"And the large hut in the center of the village street is the
palace of Oda Yorimoto?" guessed Thérière shrewdly.</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>The Frenchman was not unversed in the ways of orientals, and he
guessed also that if the white girl were still alive in the village
she would be in no other hut than that of the most powerful chief;
but he wished to verify his deductions if possible. He knew that a
direct question as to the whereabouts of the girl would call forth
either a clever oriental evasion or an equally clever oriental
lie.</p>

<p>"Does Oda Yorimoto intend slaying the white woman that was
brought to his house last night?" asked Thérière.</p>

<p>"How should the son know the intentions of his father?" replied
the boy.</p>

<p>"Is she still alive?" continued Thérière.</p>

<p>"How should I know, who was asleep when she was brought, and
only heard the womenfolk this morning whispering that Oda Yorimoto
had brought home a new woman the night before."</p>

<p>"Could you not see her with your own eyes?" asked Thérière.</p>

<p>"My eyes cannot pass through the door of the little room behind,
in which they still were when I left to gather firewood a half hour
since," retorted the youth.</p>

<p>"Wot's de Chink sayin'?" asked Billy Byrne, impatient of the
conversation, no word of which was intelligible to him.</p>

<p>"He says, in substance," replied Thérière, with a grin, "that
Miss Harding is still alive, and in the back room of that largest
hut in the center of the village street; but," and his face
clouded, "Oda Yorimoto, the chief of the tribe, is with her."</p>

<p>The mucker sprang to his feet with an oath, and would have
bolted for the village had not Thérière laid a detaining hand upon
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"It is too late, my friend," he said sadly, "to make haste now.
We may, if we are cautious, be able to save her life, and later,
possibly, avenge her wrong. Let us act coolly, and after some
manner of plan, so that we may work together, and not throw our
lives away uselessly. The chance is that neither of us will come
out of that village alive, but we must minimize that chance to the
utmost if we are to serve Miss Harding."</p>

<p>"Well, wot's de word?" asked the mucker, for he saw that
Thérière was right.</p>

<p>"The jungle approaches the village most closely on the opposite
side&mdash;the side in rear of the chief's hut," pointed out
Thérière. "We must circle about until we can reach that point
undetected, then we may formulate further plans from what our
observations there develop."</p>

<p>"An' dis?" Byrne shoved a thumb at Oda Iseka.</p>

<p>"We'll take him with us&mdash;it wouldn't be safe to let him go
now."</p>

<p>"Why not croak him?" suggested Byrne.</p>

<p>"Not unless we have to," replied Thérière; "he's just a
boy&mdash;we'll doubtless have all the killing we want among the
men before we get out of this."</p>

<p>"I never did have no use fer Chinks," said the mucker, as though
in extenuation of his suggestion that they murder the youth. For
some unaccountable reason he had felt a sudden compunction because
of his thoughtless remark. What in the world was coming over him,
he wondered. He'd be wearing white pants and playing lawn tennis
presently if he continued to grow much softer and more unmanly.</p>

<p>So the three set out through the jungle, following a trail which
led around to the north of the village. Thérière walked ahead with
the boy's arm in his grasp. Byrne followed closely behind. They
reached their destination in the rear of Oda Yorimoto's "palace"
without interruption or detection. Here they reconnoitered through
the thick foliage.</p>

<p>"Dere's a little winder in de back of de house," said Byrne.
"Dat must be where dem guys cooped up de little broiler."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Thérière, "it would be in the back room which the
boy described. First let's tie and gag this young heathen, and then
we can proceed to business without fear of alarm from him," and the
Frenchman stripped a long, grass rope from about the waist of his
prisoner, with which he was securely trussed up, a piece of his
loin cloth being forced into his mouth as a gag, and secured there
by another strip, torn from the same garment, which was passed
around the back of the boy's head.</p>

<p>"Rather uncomfortable, I imagine," commented Thérière; "but not
particularly painful or dangerous&mdash;and now to business!"</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to make a break fer dat winder," announced the
mucker, "and youse squat here in de tall grass wid yer gat an' pick
off any fresh guys dat get gay in back here. Den, if I need youse
you can come a-runnin' an' open up all over de shop wid de
artillery, or if I gets de lizzie outen de jug an' de Chinks push
me too clost youse'll be here where yeh can pick 'em off
easy-like."</p>

<p>"You'll be taking all the risk that way, Byrne," objected
Thérière, "and that's not fair."</p>

<p>"One o' us is pretty sure to get hurted," explained the mucker
in defense of his plan, "an, if it's a croak it's a lot better dat
it be me than youse, fer the girl wouldn't be crazy about bein'
lef' alone wid me&mdash;she ain't got no use fer the likes o' me.
Now youse are her kin, an' so youse stay here w'ere yeh can help
her after I git her out&mdash;I don't want nothing to do wid her
anyhow. She gives me a swift pain, and," he added as though it were
an after-thought, "I ain't got no use fer dat ransom
eider&mdash;youse can have dat, too."</p>

<p>"Hold on, Byrne," cried Thérière; "I have something to say, too.
I do not see how I can expect you to believe me; but under the
circumstances, when one of us and maybe both are pretty sure to die
before the day is much older, it wouldn't be worth while lying. I
do not want that damned ransom any more, either. I only want to do
what I can to right the wrong that I have helped to perpetrate
against Miss Harding. I&mdash;I&mdash;Byrne, I love her. I shall
never tell her so, for I am not the sort of man a decent girl would
care to marry; but I did want the chance to make a clean breast to
her of all my connection with the whole dirty business, and get her
forgiveness if I could; but first I wanted to prove my repentance
by helping her to civilization in safety, and delivering her to her
friends without the payment of a cent of money. I may never be able
to do that now; but if I die in the attempt, and you don't, I wish
that you would tell her what I have just told you. Paint me as
black as you can&mdash;you couldn't commence to make me as black as
I have been&mdash;but let her know that for love of her I turned
white at the last minute. Byrne, she is the best girl that you or I
ever saw&mdash;we're not fit to breathe the same air that she
breathes. Now you can see why I should like to go first."</p>

<p>"I t'ought youse was soft on her," replied the mucker, "an'
dat's de reason w'y youse otter not go first; but wot's de use o'
chewin', les flip a coin to see w'ich goes an w'ich stays&mdash;got
one?"</p>

<p>Thérière felt in his trousers' pocket, fishing out a dime.</p>

<p>"Heads, you go; tails, I go," he said and spun the silver piece
in the air, catching it in the flat of his open palm.</p>

<p>"It's heads," said the mucker, grinning. "Gee! Wot's de
racket?"</p>

<p>Both men turned toward the village, where a jabbering mob of
half-caste Japanese had suddenly appeared in the streets, hurrying
toward the hut of Oda Yorimoto.</p>

<p>"Somepin doin', eh?" said the mucker. "Well, here
goes&mdash;s'long!" And he broke from the cover of the jungle and
dashed across the clearing toward the rear of Oda Yorimoto's
hut.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa12" id="chapa12">XII. &mdash; THE FIGHT IN THE
PALACE</a></h2>

<p class="first">Barbara Harding heard the samurai in the room
beyond her prison advancing toward the door that separated them
from her. She pressed the point of the daimio's sword close to her
heart. A heavy knock fell upon the door and at the same instant the
girl was startled by a noise behind her&mdash;a noise at the little
window at the far end of the room.</p>

<p>Turning to face this new danger, she was startled into a little
cry of surprise to see the head and shoulders of the mucker framed
in the broken square of the half-demolished window.</p>

<p>The girl did not know whether to feel renewed hope or utter
despair. She could not forget the heroism of her rescue by this
brutal fellow when the <i>Halfmoon</i> had gone to pieces the day
before, nor could she banish from her mind his threats of violence
toward her, or his brutal treatment of Mallory and Thérière. And
the question arose in her mind as to whether she would be any
better off in his power than in the clutches of the savage
samurai.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne had heard the knock upon the door before which the
girl knelt. He had seen the corpses of the dead men at her feet. He
had observed the telltale position of the sword which the girl held
to her breast and he had read much of the story of the impending
tragedy at a glance.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, kid!" he whispered. "I'll be wid youse in a minute,
an' Thérière's out here too, to help youse if I can't do it
alone."</p>

<p>The girl turned toward the door again.</p>

<p>"Wait," she cried to the samurai upon the other side, "until I
move the dead men, then you may come in, their bodies bar the door
now."</p>

<p>All that kept the warriors out was the fear that possibly Oda
Yorimoto might not be dead after all, and that should they force
their way into the room without his permission some of them would
suffer for their temerity. Naturally none of them was keen to lose
his head for nothing, but the moment that the girl spoke of the
dead "men" they knew that Oda Yorimoto had been slain, too, and
with one accord they rushed the little door.</p>

<p>The girl threw all her weight against her side, while the dead
men, each to the extent of his own weight, aided the woman who had
killed them in her effort to repulse their fellows; and behind the
three Billy Byrne kicked and tore at the mud wall about the window
in a frantic effort to enlarge the aperture sufficiently to permit
his huge bulk to pass through into the little room.</p>

<p>The mucker won to the girl's side first, and snatching Oda
Yorimoto's long sword from the floor he threw his great weight
against the door, and commanded the girl to make for the window and
escape to the forest as quickly as she could.</p>

<p>"Thérière is waiting dere," he said. "He will see youse de
moment yeh reach de window, and den youse will be safe."</p>

<p>"But you!" cried the girl. "What of you?"</p>

<p>"Never yeh mind me," commanded Billy Byrne. "Youse jes' do as I
tells yeh, see? Now, beat it," and he gave her a rough shove toward
the window.</p>

<p>And then, between the combined efforts of the samurai upon one
side and Billy Byrne of Kelly's gang upon the other the frail door
burst from its rotten hinges and fell to one side.</p>

<p>The first of the samurai into the little room was cleft from
crown to breast bone with the keen edge of the sword of the Lord of
Yoka wielded by the mighty arm of the mucker. The second took the
count with a left hook to the jaw, and then all that could crowd
through the little door swarmed upon the husky bruiser from Grand
Avenue.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding took one look at the carnage behind her and then
sprang to the window. At a short distance she saw the jungle and at
its edge what she was sure was the figure of a man crouching in the
long grass.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thérière!" she cried. "Quick! They are killing Byrne," and
then she turned back into the room, and with the short sword which
she still grasped in her hand sprang to the side of the mucker who
was offering his life to save her.</p>

<p>Byrne cast a horrified glance at the figure fighting by his
side.</p>

<p>"Fer de love o' Mike! Beat it!" he cried. "Duck! Git out o'
here!"</p>

<p>But the girl only smiled up bravely into his face and kept her
place beside him. The mucker tried to push her behind him with one
hand while he fought with the other, but she drew away from him to
come up again a little farther from him.</p>

<p>The samurai were pushing them closely now. Three men at a time
were reaching for the mucker with their long swords. He was
bleeding from numerous wounds, but at his feet lay two dead
warriors, while a third crawled away with a mortal wound in his
abdomen.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding devoted her energies to thrusting and cutting at
those who tried to press past the mucker, that they might take him
from behind. The battle could not last long, so unequal were the
odds. She saw the room beyond filled with surging warriors all
trying to force their way within reach of the great white man who
battled like some demigod of old in the close, dark, evil warren of
the daimio.</p>

<p>She shot a side glance at the man. He was wonderful! The fire of
battle had transformed him. No longer was he the sullen, sulky,
hulking brute she had first known upon the <i>Halfmoon</i>.
Instead, huge, muscular, alert, he towered above his pygmy
antagonists, his gray eyes gleaming, a half-smile upon his strong
lips.</p>

<p>She saw the long sword, wielded awkwardly in his unaccustomed
hands, beat down the weapons of his skilled foemen by the very
ferocity of its hurtling attack. She saw it pass through a man's
shoulder, cleaving bone and muscle as if they had been cheese,
until it stopped two-thirds across its victim's body, cutting him
almost in two.</p>

<p>She saw a samurai leap past her champion's guard in an attempt
to close upon him with a dagger, and when she had rushed forward to
thwart the fellow's design she had seen Byrne swing his mighty left
to the warrior's face with a blow that might well have felled an
ox. Then another leaped into closer quarters and she saw Byrne at
the same instant bury his sword in the body of a dark-visaged devil
who looked more Malay than Jap, and as the stricken man fell she
saw the hilt of the mucker's blade wrenched from his grip by the
dead body of his foe. The samurai who had closed upon Byrne at that
instant found his enemy unarmed, and with a howl of delight he
struck full at the broad chest with his long, thin dagger.</p>

<p>But Billy Byrne was not to be dispatched so easily. With his
left forearm he struck up the hand that wielded the menacing blade,
and then catching the fellow by the shoulder swung him around,
grasped him about the waist and lifting him above his head hurled
him full in the faces of the swordsmen who were pressing through
the narrow doorway.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously a spear shot through a tiny opening in the
ranks before Billy Byrne, and with a little gasp of dismay the huge
fellow pitched forward upon his face. At the same instant a shot
rang out behind Barbara Harding, and Thérière leaped past her to
stand across the body of the fallen mucker.</p>

<p>With the sound of the shot a samurai sank to the floor, dead,
and the others, unaccustomed to firearms, drew back in dismay.
Again Thérière fired point-blank into the crowded room, and this
time two men fell, struck by the same bullet. Once more the
warriors retreated, and with an exultant yell Thérière followed up
his advantage by charging menacingly upon them. They stood for a
moment, then wavered, turned and fled from the hut.</p>

<p>When Thérière turned back toward Barbara Harding he found her
kneeling beside the mucker.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" asked the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"No. Can we lift him together and get him through that
window?"</p>

<p>"It is the only way," replied Thérière, "and we must try
it."</p>

<p>They seized upon the huge body and dragged it to the far end of
the room, but despite their best efforts the two were not able to
lift the great, inert mass of flesh and bone and muscle and pass it
through the tiny opening.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" cried Thérière.</p>

<p>"We must stay here with him," replied Barbara Harding. "I could
never desert the man who has fought so noble a fight for me while a
breath of life remained in him."</p>

<p>Thérière groaned.</p>

<p>"Nor I," he said; "but you&mdash;he has given his life to save
yours. Should you render his sacrifice of no avail now?"</p>

<p>"I cannot go alone," she answered simply, "and I know that you
will not leave him. There is no other way&mdash;we must stay."</p>

<p>At this juncture the mucker opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Who hit me?" he murmured. "Jes' show me de big stiff."</p>

<p>Thérière could not repress a smile. Barbara Harding again knelt
beside the man.</p>

<p>"No one hit you, Mr. Byrne," she said. "You were struck by a
spear and are badly wounded."</p>

<p>Billy Byrne opened his eyes a little wider, turning them until
they rested on the beautiful face of the girl so close to his.</p>

<p>"<i>Mr</i>. Byrne!" he ejaculated in disgust. "Forget it. Wot do
youse tink I am, one of dose paper-collar dudes?"</p>

<p>Then he sat up. Blood was flowing from a wound in his chest,
saturating his shirt, and running slowly to the earth floor. There
were two flesh wounds upon his head&mdash;one above the right eye
and the other extending entirely across the left cheek from below
the eye to the lobe of the ear&mdash;but these he had received
earlier in the fracas. From crown to heel the man was a mass of
blood. Through his crimson mask he looked at the pile of bodies in
the far end of the room, and a broad grin cracked the dried blood
about his mouth.</p>

<p>"Wot we done to dem Chinks was sure a plenty, kiddo," he
remarked to Miss Harding, and then he came to his feet, seemingly
as strong as ever, shaking himself like a great bull. "But I guess
it's lucky youse butted in when you did, old pot," he added,
turning toward Thérière; "dey jest about had me down fer de long
count."</p>

<p>Barbara Harding was looking at the man in wide-eyed amazement. A
moment before she had been expecting him, momentarily, to breathe
his last&mdash;now he was standing before her talking as
unconcernedly as though he had not received a scratch&mdash;he
seemed totally unaware of his wounds. At least he was entirely
indifferent to them.</p>

<p>"You're pretty badly hurt, old man," said Thérière. "Do you feel
able to make the attempt to get to the jungle? The Japs will be
back in a moment."</p>

<p>"Sure!" cried Billy Byrne. "Come ahead," and he sprang for the
window. "Pass de kid up to me. Quick! Dey're comin' from in
back."</p>

<p>Thérière lifted Barbara Harding to the mucker who drew her
through the opening. Then Billy extended a hand to the Frenchman,
and a moment later the three stood together outside the hut.</p>

<p>A dozen samurai were running toward them from around the end of
the "Palace." The jungle lay a hundred yards across the clearing.
There was no time to be lost.</p>

<p>"You go first with Miss Harding," cried Thérière. "I'll cover
our retreat with my revolver, following close behind you."</p>

<p>The mucker caught the girl in his arms, throwing her across his
shoulder. The blood from his wounds smeared her hands and
clothing.</p>

<p>"Hang tight, kiddo," he cried, and started at a brisk trot
toward the forest.</p>

<p>Thérière kept close behind the two, reserving his fire until it
could be effectively delivered. With savage yells the samurai
leaped after their escaping quarry. The natives all carried the
long, sharp spears of the aboriginal head-hunters. Their swords
swung in their harness, and their ancient armor clanked as they
ran.</p>

<p>It was a strange, weird picture that the oddly contrasted party
presented as they raced across the clearing of this forgotten isle
toward a jungle as primitive as when "the evening and the morning
were the third day." An American girl of the highest social caste
borne in the arms of that most vicious of all social
pariahs&mdash;the criminal mucker of the slums of a great
city&mdash;and defending them with drawn revolver, a French count
and soldier of fortune, while in their wake streamed a yelling pack
of half-caste demons clothed in the habiliments of sixteenth
century Japan, and wielding the barbarous spears of the savage
head-hunting aborigines whose fierce blood coursed in their veins
with that of the descendants of Taka-mi-musu-bi-no-kami.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of the distance had been covered in safety before
the samurai came within safe spear range of the trio. Thérière,
seeing the danger to the girl, dropped back a few paces hoping to
hold the brown warriors from her. The foremost of the pursuers
raised his weapon aloft, carrying his spear hand back of his
shoulder for the throw. Thérière's revolver spoke, and the man
pitched forward, rolling over and over before he came to rest.</p>

<p>A howl of rage went up from the samurai, and a half-dozen spears
leaped at long range toward Thérière. One of the weapons transfixed
his thigh, bringing him to earth. Byrne was at the forest's edge as
the Frenchman fell&mdash;it was the girl, though, who witnessed the
catastrophe.</p>

<p>"Stop!" she cried. "Mr. Thérière is down."</p>

<p>The mucker halted, and turned his head in the direction of the
Frenchman, who had raised himself to one elbow and was firing at
the advancing enemy. He dropped the girl to her feet.</p>

<p>"Wait here!" he commanded and sprang back toward Thérière.</p>

<p>Before he reached him another spear had caught the man full in
the chest, toppling him, unconscious, to the earth. The samurai
were rushing rapidly upon the wounded officer&mdash;it was a
question who would reach him first.</p>

<p>Thérière had been nipped in the act of reloading his revolver.
It lay beside him now, the cylinder full of fresh cartridges. The
mucker was first to his side, and snatching the weapon from the
ground fired coolly and rapidly at the advancing Japanese. Four of
them went down before that deadly fusillade; but the mucker cursed
beneath his breath because of his two misses.</p>

<p>Byrne's stand checked the brown men momentarily, and in the
succeeding lull the man lifted the unconscious Frenchman to his
shoulder and bore him back to the forest. In the shelter of the
jungle they laid him upon the ground. To the girl it seemed that
the frightful wound in his chest must prove fatal within a few
moments.</p>

<p>Byrne, apparently unmoved by the seriousness of Thérière's
condition, removed the man's cartridge belt and buckled it about
his own waist, replacing the six empty shells in the revolver with
six fresh ones. Presently he noticed the bound and gagged Oda Iseka
lying in the brush behind them where he and Thérière had left him.
The samurai were now sneaking cautiously toward their refuge. A
sudden inspiration came to the mucker.</p>

<p>"Didn't I hear youse chewin' de rag wit de Chinks wen I hit de
dump over dere?" he asked of Barbara.</p>

<p>The girl, oddly, understood him. She nodded her head,
affirmatively.</p>

<p>"Youse savvy deyre lingo den, eh?"</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"Tell dis gazimbat to wise his pals to de fact dat I'll croak
'im, if dey don't beat it, an' let us make our get-away. Thérière
says as how he's kink when his ole man croaks, an' his ole man was
de guy youse put to sleep in de chicken coop," explained the mucker
lucidly; "so dis slob's kink hisself now."</p>

<p>Barbara Harding was quick to see the strength of the man's
suggestion. Stepping to the edge of the clearing in full view of
the advancing enemy, with the mucker at her side, revolver in hand,
she called to them in the language of their forbears to listen to
her message. Then she explained that they held the son of Oda
Yorimoto prisoner, and that his life would be the price of any
further attack upon them.</p>

<p>The samurai conferred together for a moment, then one of them
called out that they did not believe her, that Oda Iseka, son of
Oda Yorimoto, was safe in the village.</p>

<p>"Wait!" replied the girl. "We will show him to you," and turning
to Byrne she asked him to fetch the youth.</p>

<p>When the white man returned with the boy in his arms, a wail of
mingled anguish and rage rose from the natives.</p>

<p>"If you molest us no further we shall not harm him," cried
Barbara, "and when we leave your island we shall set him free; but
renew your attack upon us and this white man who holds him says
that he will cut out his heart and feed it to the fox," which was
rather a bloodthirsty statement for so gentle a character as
Barbara Harding; but she knew enough of the superstitious fears of
the ancient Japanese to feel confident that this threat would have
considerable weight with the subjects of the young Lord of
Yoka.</p>

<p>Again the natives conferred in whispers. Finally he who had
acted as spokesman before turned toward the strangers.</p>

<p>"We shall not harm you," he said, "so long as you do not harm
Oda Iseka; but we shall watch you always until you leave the
island, and if harm befalls him then shall you never leave, for we
shall kill you all."</p>

<p>Barbara translated the man's words to the mucker.</p>

<p>"Do youse fall fer dat?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I think they will be careful to make no open assault upon us,"
replied the girl; "but never for an instant must we cease our
watchfulness for at the first opportunity I am sure that they will
murder us."</p>

<p>They turned back to Thérière now. The man still lay, unconscious
and moaning, where Byrne had deposited him. The mucker removed the
gag from Oda Iseka's mouth.</p>

<p>"Which way is water? Ask him," he said to Barbara.</p>

<p>The girl put the question.</p>

<p>"He says that straight up this ravine behind us there is a
little spring," translated the girl.</p>

<p>Byrne lifted Thérière in his arms, after loosening Oda Iseka's
feet and tethering him to his own belt with the same grass rope;
then he motioned the youth up the ravine.</p>

<p>"Walk beside me," he said to Barbara Harding, "an' keep yer
lamps peeled behind."</p>

<p>Thus, in silence, the party commenced the ascent of the trail
which soon became rough and precipitous, while behind them, under
cover of the brush, sneaked four trailing samurai.</p>

<p>After half an hour of the most arduous climbing the mucker
commenced to feel the effects of loss of blood from his many
wounds. He coughed a little now from the exertion, and when he did
the blood spurted anew from the fresh wound in his breast.</p>

<p>Yet there was no wavering or weakness apparent to the girl who
marched beside him, and she wondered at the physical endurance of
the man. But when at last they came to a clear pool of water, half
hidden by overhanging rocks and long masses of depending mosses, in
the midst of a natural grotto of enchanting loveliness, and Oda
Iseka signaled that their journey was at an end, Byrne laid
Thérière gently upon the flower-starred sward, and with a little,
choking gasp collapsed, unconscious, beside the Frenchman.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding was horror-stricken. She suddenly realized that
she had commenced to feel that this giant of the slums was
invulnerable, and with the thought came another&mdash;that to him
she had come to look more than to Thérière for eventual rescue; and
now, here she found herself in the center of a savage island,
surrounded as she felt confident she was by skulking murderers,
with only two dying white men and a brown hostage as
companions.</p>

<p>And now Oda Iseka took in the situation, and with a grin of
triumph raised his voice in a loud halloo.</p>

<p>"Come quickly, my people!" he cried; "for both the white men are
dying," and from the jungle below them came an answering shout.</p>

<p>"We come, Oda Iseka, Lord of Yoka! Your faithful samurai
come!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa13" id="chapa13">XIII. &mdash; A GENTLEMAN OF
FRANCE</a></h2>

<p class="first">At the sound of the harsh voices so close upon her
Barbara Harding was galvanized into instant action. Springing to
Byrne's side she whipped Thérière's revolver from his belt, where
it reposed about the fallen mucker's hips, and with it turned like
a tigress upon the youth.</p>

<p>"Quick!" she cried. "Tell them to go back&mdash;that I shall
kill you if they come closer."</p>

<p>The boy shrank back in terror before the fiery eyes and menacing
attitude of the white girl, and then with the terror that animated
him ringing plainly in his voice he screamed to his henchmen to
halt.</p>

<p>Relieved for a moment at least from immediate danger Barbara
Harding turned her attention toward the two unconscious men at her
feet. From appearances it seemed that either might breathe his last
at any moment, and as she looked at Thérière a wave of compassion
swept over her, and the tears welled to her eyes; yet it was to the
mucker that she first ministered&mdash;why, she could not for the
life of her have explained.</p>

<p>She dashed cold water from the spring upon his face. She bathed
his wrists, and washed his wounds, tearing strips from her skirt to
bandage the horrid gash upon his breast in an effort to stanch the
flow of lifeblood that welled forth with the man's every
breath.</p>

<p>And at last she was rewarded by seeing the flow of blood quelled
and signs of returning consciousness appear. The mucker opened his
eyes. Close above him bent the radiant vision of Barbara Harding's
face. Upon his fevered forehead he felt the soothing strokes of her
cool, soft hand. He closed his eyes again to battle with the
effeminate realization that he enjoyed this strange, new
sensation&mdash;the sensation of being ministered to by a gentle
woman&mdash;and, perish the thought, by a gentlewoman!</p>

<p>With an effort he raised himself to one elbow, scowling at
her.</p>

<p>"Gwan," he said; "I ain't no boob dude. Cut out de mush. Lemme
be. Beat it!"</p>

<p>Hurt, more than she would have cared to admit, Barbara Harding
turned away from her ungrateful and ungracious patient, to repeat
her ministrations to the Frenchman. The mucker read in her
expression something of the wound his words had inflicted, and he
lay thinking upon the matter for some time, watching her deft,
white fingers as they worked over the scarce breathing
Thérière.</p>

<p>He saw her wash the blood and dirt from the ghastly wound in the
man's chest, and as he watched he realized what a world of courage
it must require for a woman of her stamp to do gruesome work of
this sort. Never before would such a thought have occurred to him.
Neither would he have cared at all for the pain his recent words to
the girl might have inflicted. Instead he would have felt keen
enjoyment of her discomfiture.</p>

<p>And now another strange new emotion took possession of him. It
was none other than a desire to atone in some way for his words.
What wonderful transformation was taking place in the heart of the
Kelly gangster?</p>

<p>"Say!" he blurted out suddenly.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding turned questioning eyes toward him. In them was
the cold, haughty aloofness again that had marked her cognizance of
him upon the <i>Halfmoon</i>&mdash;the look that had made his hate
of her burn most fiercely. It took the mucker's breath away to
witness it, and it made the speech he had contemplated more
difficult than ever&mdash;nay, almost impossible. He coughed
nervously, and the old dark, lowering scowl returned to his
brow.</p>

<p>"Did you speak?" asked Miss Harding, icily.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne cleared his throat, and then there blurted from his
lips not the speech that he had intended, but a sudden, hateful
rush of words which seemed to emanate from another personality,
from one whom Billy Byrne once had been.</p>

<p>"Ain't dat boob croaked yet?" he growled.</p>

<p>The shock of that brutal question brought Barbara Harding to her
feet. In horror she looked down at the man who had spoken thus of a
brave and noble comrade in the face of death itself. Her eyes
blazed angrily as hot, bitter words rushed to her lips, and then of
a sudden she thought of Byrne's self-sacrificing heroism in
returning to Thérière's side in the face of the advancing
samurai&mdash;of the cool courage he had displayed as he carried
the unconscious man back to the jungle&mdash;of the devotion,
almost superhuman, that had sustained him as he struggled,
uncomplaining, up the steep mountain path with the burden of the
Frenchman's body the while his own lifeblood left a crimson trail
behind him.</p>

<p>Such deeds and these words were incompatible in the same
individual. There could be but one explanation&mdash;Byrne must be
two men, with as totally different characters as though they had
possessed separate bodies. And who may say that her hypothesis was
not correct&mdash;at least it seemed that Billy Byrne was
undergoing a metamorphosis, and at the instant there was still a
question as to which personality should eventually dominate.</p>

<p>Byrne turned away from the reproach which replaced the horror in
the girl's eyes, and with a tired sigh let his head fall upon his
outstretched arm. The girl watched him for a moment, a puzzled
expression upon her face, and then returned to work above
Thérière.</p>

<p>The Frenchman's respiration was scarcely appreciable, yet after
a time he opened his eyes and looked up wearily. At sight of the
girl he smiled wanly, and tried to speak, but a fit of coughing
flecked his lips with bloody foam, and again he closed his eyes.
Fainter and fainter came his breathing, until it was with
difficulty that the girl detected any movement of his breast
whatever. She thought that he was dying, and she was afraid.
Wistfully she looked toward the mucker. The man still lay with his
head buried in his arm, but whether he were wrapped in thought, in
slumber, or in death the girl could not tell. At the final thought
she went white with terror.</p>

<p>Slowly she approached the man, and leaning over placed her hand
upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Mr. Byrne!" she whispered.</p>

<p>The mucker turned his face toward her. It looked tired and
haggard.</p>

<p>"Wot is it?" he asked, and his tone was softer than she had ever
heard it.</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Thérière is dying," she said, "and
I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, I am so afraid."</p>

<p>The man flushed to the roots of his hair. All that he could
think of were the ugly words he had spoken a short time
before&mdash;and now Thérière was dying! Byrne would have laughed
had anyone suggested that he entertained any other sentiment than
hatred toward the second officer of the <i>Halfmoon</i>&mdash;that
is he would have twenty-four hours before; but now, quite
unexpectedly, he realized that he didn't want Thérière to die, and
then it dawned upon him that a new sentiment had been born within
him&mdash;a sentiment to which he had been a stranger all his hard
life&mdash;friendship.</p>

<p>He felt friendship for Thérière! It was unthinkable, and yet the
mucker knew that it was so. Painfully he crawled over to the
Frenchman's side.</p>

<p>"Thérière!" he whispered in the man's ear.</p>

<p>The officer turned his head wearily.</p>

<p>"Do youse know me, old pal?" asked the mucker, and Barbara
Harding knew from the man's voice that there were tears in his
eyes; but what she did not know was that they welled there in
response to the words the mucker had just spoken&mdash;the nearest
approach to words of endearment that ever had passed his lips.</p>

<p>Thérière reached up and took Byrne's hand. It was evident that
he too had noted the unusual quality of the mucker's voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, old man," he said very faintly, and then "water,
please."</p>

<p>Barbara Harding brought him a drink, holding his head against
her knee while he drank. The cool liquid seemed to give him new
strength for presently he spoke, quite strongly.</p>

<p>"I'm going, Byrne," he said; "but before I go I want to tell you
that of all the brave men I ever have known I have learned within
the past few days to believe that you are the bravest. A week ago I
thought you were a coward&mdash;I ask your forgiveness."</p>

<p>"Ferget it," whispered Byrne, "fer a week ago I guess I was a
coward. Dere seems to be more'n one kind o' nerve&mdash;I'm jest
a-learnin' of the right kind, I guess."</p>

<p>"And, Byrne," continued Thérière, "don't forget what I asked of
you before we tossed up to see which should enter Oda Yorimoto's
house."</p>

<p>"I'll not ferget," said Billy.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Byrne," whispered Thérière. "Take good care of Miss
Harding."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, old pal," said the mucker. His voice broke, and two
big tears rolled down the cheeks of "de toughest guy on de Wes'
Side."</p>

<p>Barbara Harding stepped to Thérière's side.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my friend," she said. "God will reward you for your
friendship, your bravery, and your devotion. There must be a
special honor roll in heaven for such noble men as you."</p>

<p>Thérière smiled sadly.</p>

<p>"Byrne will tell you all," he said, "except who I am&mdash;he
does not know that"</p>

<p>"Is there any message, my friend," asked the girl, "that you
would like to have me deliver?"</p>

<p>Thérière remained silent for a moment as though thinking.</p>

<p>"My name," he said, "is Henri Thérière. I am the Count de
Cadenet of France. There is no message, Miss Harding, other than
you see fit to deliver to my relatives. They lived in Paris the
last I heard of them&mdash;my brother, Jacques, was a deputy."</p>

<p>His voice had become so low and weak that the girl could scarce
distinguish his words. He gasped once or twice, and then tried to
speak again. Barbara leaned closer, her ear almost against his
lips.</p>

<p>"Good-bye&mdash;dear." The words were almost inaudible, and then
the body stiffened with a little convulsive tremor, and Henri
Thérière, Count de Cadenet, passed over into the keeping of his
noble ancestors.</p>

<p>"He's gone!" whispered the girl, dry-eyed but suffering. She had
not loved this man, she realized, but she had learned to think of
him as her one true friend in their little world of scoundrels and
murderers. She had cared for him very much&mdash;it was entirely
possible that some day she might have come to return his evident
affection for her. She knew nothing of the seamy side of his hard
life. She had guessed nothing of the scoundrelly duplicity that had
marked his first advances toward her. She thought of him only as a
true, brave gentleman, and in that she was right, for whatever
Henri Thérière might have been in the past the last few days of his
life had revealed him in the true colors that birth and nature had
intended him to wear through a brilliant career. In his death he
had atoned for many sins.</p>

<p>And in those last few days he had transferred, all unknown to
himself or the other man, a measure of the gentility and chivalry
that were his birthright, for, unrealizing, Billy Byrne was
patterning himself after the man he had hated and had come to
love.</p>

<p>After the girl's announcement the mucker had continued to sit
with bowed head staring at the ground. Afternoon had deepened into
evening, and now the brief twilight of the tropics was upon
them&mdash;in a few moments it would be dark.</p>

<p>Presently Byrne looked up. His eyes wandered about the tiny
clearing. Suddenly he staggered to his feet. Barbara Harding sprang
up, startled by the evident alarm in the man's attitude.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she whispered. "What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"De Chink!" he cried. "Where is de Chink?"</p>

<p>And, sure enough, Oda Iseka had disappeared!</p>

<p>The youthful daimio had taken advantage of the preoccupation of
his captors during the last moments of Thérière to gnaw in two the
grass rope which bound him to the mucker, and with hands still fast
bound behind him had slunk into the jungle path that led toward his
village.</p>

<p>"They will be upon us again now at any moment," whispered the
girl. "What can we do?"</p>

<p>"We better duck," replied the mucker. "I hates to run away from
a bunch of Chinks, but I guess it's up to us to beat it."</p>

<p>"But poor Mr. Thérière?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"I'll have to bury him close by," replied the mucker. "I don't
tink I could pack him very fer tonight&mdash;I don't feel jest
quite fit agin yet. You wouldn't mind much if I buried him here,
would you?"</p>

<p>"There is no other way, Mr. Byrne," replied the girl. "You
mustn't think of trying to carry him far. We have done all we can
for poor Mr. Thérière&mdash;you have almost given your life for him
already&mdash;and it wouldn't do any good to carry his dead body
with us."</p>

<p>"I hates to tink o' dem head-huntin' Chinks gettin' him,'
replied Byrne; "but maybe I kin hide his grave so's dey won't
tumble to it."</p>

<p>"You are in no condition to carry him at all," said the girl. "I
doubt if you can go far even without any burden."</p>

<p>The mucker grinned.</p>

<p>"Youse don't know me, miss," he said, and stooping he lifted the
body of the Frenchman to his broad shoulder, and started up the
hillside through the trackless underbrush.</p>

<p>It would have been an impossible feat for an ordinary man in the
pink of condition, but the mucker, weak from pain and loss of
blood, strode sturdily upward while the marveling girl followed
close behind him. A hundred yards above the spring they came upon a
little level spot, and here with the two swords of Oda Yorimoto
which they still carried they scooped a shallow grave in which they
placed all that was mortal of the Count de Cadenet.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding whispered a short prayer above the new-made
grave, while the mucker stood with bowed head beside her. Then they
turned to their flight again up the wild face of the savage
mountain. The moon came up at last to lighten the way for them, but
it was a rough and dangerous climb at best. In many places they
were forced to walk hand in hand for considerable distances, and
twice the mucker had lifted the girl bodily in his arms to bear her
across particularly dangerous or difficult stretches.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight they struck a small mountain stream up
which they followed until in a natural cul-de-sac they came upon
its source and found their farther progress barred by precipitous
cliffs which rose above them, sheer and unscalable.</p>

<p>They had entered the little amphitheater through a narrow, rocky
pass in the bottom of which the tiny stream flowed, and now, weak
and tired, the mucker was forced to admit that he could go no
farther.</p>

<p>"Who'd o' t'ought dat I was such a sissy?" he exclaimed
disgustedly.</p>

<p>"I think that you are very wonderful, Mr. Byrne," replied the
girl. "Few men could have gone through what you have today and been
alive now."</p>

<p>The mucker made a deprecatory gesture.</p>

<p>"I suppose we gotta make de best of it," he said. "Anyhow, dis
ought to make a swell joint to defend."</p>

<p>Weak as he was he searched about for some soft grasses which he
threw in a pile beneath a stunted tree that grew well back in the
hollow.</p>

<p>"Here's yer downy," he said, with an attempt at jocularity. "Now
you'd better hit de hay, fer youse must be dead fagged."</p>

<p>"Thanks!" replied the girl. "I <i>am</i> nearly dead."</p>

<p>So tired was she that she was asleep almost as soon as she had
found a comfortable position in the thick mat of grass, so that she
gave no thought to the strange position in which circumstance had
placed her.</p>

<p><br>
THE sun was well up the following morning before the girl
awakened, and it was several minutes before she could readjust
herself to her strange surroundings. At first she thought that she
was alone, but finally she discerned a giant figure standing at the
opening which led from their mountain retreat.</p>

<p>It was the mucker, and at sight of him there swept over the girl
the terrible peril of her position&mdash;alone in the savage
mountains of a savage island with the murderer of Billy
Mallory&mdash;the beast that had kicked the unconscious Thérière in
the face&mdash;the mucker who had insulted and threatened to strike
her! She shuddered at the thought. And then she recalled the man's
other side, and for the life of her she could not tell whether to
be afraid of him or not&mdash;it all depended upon what mood
governed him. It would be best to propitiate him. She called a
pleasant good morning.</p>

<p>Byrne turned. She was shocked at the pallor of his haggard
face.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said. "How did yeh sleep?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just splendidly, and you?" she replied.</p>

<p>"So-so," he answered.</p>

<p>She looked at him searchingly as he approached her.</p>

<p>"Why I don't believe that you have slept at all," she cried.</p>

<p>"I didn't feel very sleepy," he replied evasively.</p>

<p>"You sat up all night on guard!" she exclaimed. "You know you
did."</p>

<p>"De Chinks might o' been shadowin' us&mdash;it wasn't safe to
sleep," he admitted; "but I'll tear off a few dis mornin' after we
find a feed of some kind."</p>

<p>"What can we find to eat here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Dis crick is full o' fish," he explained, "an' ef youse got a
pin I guess we kin rig up a scheme to hook a couple."</p>

<p>The girl found a pin that he said would answer very nicely, and
with a shoe lace for a line and a big locust as bait the mucker set
forth to angle in the little mountain torrent. The fish, unwary,
and hungry thus early in the morning proved easy prey, and two
casts brought forth two splendid specimens.</p>

<p>"I could eat a dozen of dem minnows," announced the mucker, and
he cast again and again, until in twenty minutes he had a goodly
mess of plump, shiny trout on the grass beside him.</p>

<p>With his pocketknife he cleaned and scaled them, and then
between two rocks he built a fire and passing sticks through the
bodies of his catch roasted them all. They had neither salt, nor
pepper, nor butter, nor any other viand than the fish, but it
seemed to the girl that never in her life had she tasted so
palatable a meal, nor had it occurred to her until the odor of the
cooking fish filled her nostrils that no food had passed her lips
since the second day before&mdash;no wonder that the two ate
ravenously, enjoying every mouthful of their repast.</p>

<p>"An' now," said Billy Byrne, "I tink I'll poun' my ear fer a
few. You kin keep yer lamps peeled fer de Chinks, an' de first fony
noise youse hears, w'y be sure to wake me up," and with that he
rolled over upon the grass, asleep almost on the instant.</p>

<p>The girl, to while away the time, explored their rock-bound
haven. She found that it had but a single means of ingress, the
narrow pass through which the brook found outlet. Beyond the
entrance she did not venture, but through it she saw, beneath, a
wooded slope, and twice deer passed quite close to her, stopping at
the brook to drink.</p>

<p>It was an ideal spot, one whose beauties appealed to her even
under the harrowing conditions which had forced her to seek its
precarious safety. In another land and with companions of her own
kind she could well imagine the joy of a fortnight spent in such a
sylvan paradise.</p>

<p>The thought aroused another&mdash;how long would the mucker
remain a safe companion? She seemed to be continually falling from
the frying pan into the fire. So far she had not been burned, but
with returning strength, and the knowledge of their utter isolation
could she expect this brutal thug to place any check upon his
natural desires?</p>

<p>Why there were few men of her own station in life with whom she
would have felt safe to spend a fortnight alone upon a savage,
uncivilized island! She glanced at the man where he lay stretched
in deep slumber. What a huge fellow he was! How helpless would she
be were he to turn against her! Yet his very size; yes, and the
brutality she feared, were her only salvation against every other
danger than he himself. The man was physically a natural protector,
for he was able to cope with odds and dangers to which an ordinary
man would long since have succumbed. So she found that she was both
safer and less safe because the mucker was her companion.</p>

<p>As she pondered the question her eyes roved toward the slope
beyond the opening to the amphitheater. With a start she came to
her feet, shading her eyes with her hand and peering intently at
something that she could have sworn moved among the trees far
below. No, she could not be mistaken&mdash;it was the figure of a
man.</p>

<p>Swiftly she ran to Byrne, shaking him roughly by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Someone is coming," she cried, in response to his sleepy
query.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa14" id="chapa14">XIV. &mdash; THE MUCKER SEES A
NEW LIGHT</a></h2>

<p class="first">Together the girl and the mucker approached the
entrance to the amphitheater. From behind a shoulder of rock they
peered down into the forest below them. For several minutes neither
saw any cause for alarm.</p>

<p>"I guess youse must o' been seein' things," said Byrne,
drily.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl, "and I see them again. Look! Quick! Down
there&mdash;to the right."</p>

<p>Byrne looked in the direction she indicated.</p>

<p>"Chinks," he commented. "Gee! Look at 'em comin'. Dere must be a
hundred of 'em."</p>

<p>He turned a rueful glance back into the amphitheater.</p>

<p>"I dunno as dis place looks as good to me as it did," he
remarked. "Dose yaps wid de toad stabbers could hike up on top o'
dese cliffs an' make it a case o' 'thence by carriages to Calvary'
for ours in about two shakes."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl, "I'm afraid it's a regular
cul-de-sac."</p>

<p>"I dunno nothin' about dat," replied the mucker; "but I do know
dat if we wants to get out o' here we gotta get a hump on ourselves
good an' lively. Come ahead," and with his words he ran quickly
through the entrance, and turning squarely toward the right skirted
the perpendicular cliffs that extended as far as they could see to
be lost to view in the forest that ran up to meet them from
below.</p>

<p>The trees and underbrush hid them from the head-hunters. There
had been danger of detection but for the brief instant that they
passed through the entrance of the hollow, but at the time they had
chosen the enemy had been hidden in a clump of thick brush far down
the slope.</p>

<p>For hours the two fugitives continued their flight, passing over
the crest of a ridge and downward toward another valley, until by a
small brook they paused to rest, hopeful that they had entirely
eluded their pursuers.</p>

<p>Again Byrne fished, and again they sat together at a one-course
meal. As they ate the man found himself looking at the girl more
and more often. For several days the wonder of her beauty had been
growing upon him, until now he found it difficult to take his eyes
from her. Thrice she surprised him in the act of staring intently
at her, and each time he had dropped his eyes guiltily. At length
the girl became nervous, and then terribly frightened&mdash;was it
coming so soon?</p>

<p>The man had talked but little during this meal, and for the life
of her Barbara Harding could not think of any topic with which to
distract his attention from his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better be moving on?" she asked at last.</p>

<p>Byrne gave a little start as though surprised in some
questionable act.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," he said; "this ain't no place to spend the
night&mdash;it's too open. We gotta find a sort o' hiding place if
we can, dat a fellow kin barricade wit something."</p>

<p>Again they took up their seemingly hopeless march&mdash;an
aimless wandering in search of they knew not what. Away from one
danger to possible dangers many fold more terrible. Barbara's heart
was very heavy, for again she feared and mistrusted the mucker.</p>

<p>They followed down the little brook now to where it emptied into
a river and then down the valley beside the river which grew wider
and more turbulent with every mile. Well past mid-afternoon they
came opposite a small, rocky island, and as Byrne's eyes fell upon
it an exclamation of gratification burst from his lips.</p>

<p>"Jest de place!" he cried. "We orter be able to hide dere
forever."</p>

<p>"But how are we to get there?" asked the girl, looking fearfully
at the turbulent river.</p>

<p>"It ain't deep," Byrne assured her. "Come ahead; I'll carry yeh
acrost," and without waiting for a reply he gathered her in his
arms and started down the bank.</p>

<p>What with the thoughts that had occupied his mind off and on
during the afternoon the sudden and close contact of the girl's
warm young body close to his took Billy Byrne's breath away, and
sent the hot blood coursing through his veins. It was with the
utmost difficulty that he restrained a mad desire to crush her to
him and cover her face with kisses.</p>

<p>And then the fatal thought came to him&mdash;why should he
restrain himself? What was this girl to him? Had he not always
hated her and her kind? Did she not look with loathing and contempt
upon him? And to whom did her life belong anyway but to
him&mdash;had he not saved it twice? What difference would it make?
They'd never come out of this savage world alive, and if he didn't
take her some monkey-faced Chink would get her.</p>

<p>They were in the middle of the stream now. Byrne's arms already
had commenced to tighten upon the girl. With a sudden tug he strove
to pull her face down to his; but she put both hands upon his
shoulders and held his lips at arms' length. And her wide eyes
looked full into the glowing gray ones of the mucker. And each saw
in the other's something that held their looks for a full
minute.</p>

<p>Barbara saw what she had feared, but she saw too something else
that gave her a quick, pulsing hope&mdash;a look of honest love, or
could she be mistaken? And the mucker saw the true eyes of the
woman he loved without knowing that he loved her, and he saw the
plea for pity and protection in them.</p>

<p>"Don't," whispered the girl. "Please don't, you frighten
me."</p>

<p>A week ago Billy Byrne would have laughed at such a plea.
Doubtless, too, he would have struck the girl in the face for her
resistance. He did neither now, which spoke volumes for the change
that was taking place within him, but neither did he relax his hold
upon her, or take his burning eyes from her frightened ones.</p>

<p>Thus he strode through the turbulent, shallow river to clamber
up the bank onto the island. In his soul the battle still raged,
but he had by no means relinquished his intention to have his way
with the girl. Fear, numb, freezing fear, was in the girl's eyes
now. The mucker read it there as plain as print, and had she not
said that she was frightened? That was what he had wanted to
accomplish back there upon the <i>Halfmoon</i>&mdash;to frighten
her. He would have enjoyed the sight, but he had not been able to
accomplish the thing. Now she not only showed that she was
frightened&mdash;she had admitted it, and it gave the mucker no
pleasure&mdash;on the contrary it made him unaccountably
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>And then came the last straw&mdash;tears welled to those lovely
eyes. A choking sob wracked the girl's frame&mdash;"And just when I
was learning to trust you so!" she cried.</p>

<p>They had reached the top of the bank, now, and the man, still
holding her in his arms, stood upon a mat of jungle grass beneath a
great tree. Slowly he lowered her to her feet. The madness of
desire still gripped him; but now there was another force at work
combating the evil that had predominated before.</p>

<p>Thérière's words came back to him: "Good-bye, Byrne; take good
care of Miss Harding," and his admission to the Frenchman during
that last conversation with the dying man: "&mdash;a week ago I
guess I was a coward. Dere seems to be more'n one kind o'
nerve&mdash;I'm just a-learnin' of the right kind, I guess."</p>

<p>He had been standing with eyes upon the ground, his heavy hand
still gripping the girl's arm. He looked into her face again. She
was waiting there, her great eyes upon his filled with fear and
questioning, like a prisoner before the bar awaiting the sentence
of her judge.</p>

<p>As the man looked at Barbara Harding standing there before him
he saw her in a strange new light, and a sudden realization of the
truth flashed upon him. He saw that he could not harm her now, or
ever, for he loved her!</p>

<p>And with the awakening there came to Billy Byrne the withering,
numbing knowledge that his love must forever be a hopeless
one&mdash;that this girl of the aristocracy could never be for such
as he.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding, still looking questioningly at him, saw the
change that came across his countenance&mdash;she saw the swift
pain that shot to the man's eyes, and she wondered. His fingers
released their grasp upon her arm. His hands fell limply to his
sides.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," he said. "Please don't be afraid o' me. I
couldn't hurt youse if I tried."</p>

<p>A deep sigh of relief broke from the girl's lips&mdash;relief
and joy; and she realized that its cause was as much that the man
had proved true to the new estimate she had recently placed upon
him as that the danger to herself had passed.</p>

<p>"Come," said Billy Byrne, "we'd better move in a bit out o'
sight o' de mainland, an' look fer a place to make camp. I reckon
we'd orter rest here for a few days till we git in shape ag'in. I
know youse must be dead beat, an' I sure am, all right, all
right."</p>

<p>Together they sought a favorable site for their new home, and it
was as though the horrid specter of a few moments before had never
risen to menace them, for the girl felt that a great burden of
apprehension had been lifted forever from her shoulders, and though
a dull ache gnawed at the mucker's heart, still he was happier than
he had ever been before&mdash;happy to be near the woman he
loved.</p>

<p>With the long sword of Oda Yorimoto, Billy Byrne cut saplings
and bamboo and the fronds of fan palms, and with long tough grasses
bound them together into the semblance of a rude hut. Barbara
gathered leaves and grasses with which she covered the floor.</p>

<p>"Number One, Riverside Drive," said the mucker, with a grin,
when the work was completed; "an' now I'll go down on de river
front an' build de Bowery."</p>

<p>"Oh, are you from New York?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Not on yer life," replied Billy Byrne. "I'm from good ol' Chi;
but I been to Noo York twice wit de Goose Island Kid, an' so I
knows all about it. De roughnecks belongs on de Bowery, so dat's
wot we'll call my dump down by de river. You're a highbrow, so
youse gotta live on Riverside Drive, see?" and the mucker laughed
at his little pleasantry.</p>

<p>But the girl did not laugh with him. Instead she looked
troubled.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you rather be a 'highbrow' too?" she asked, "and live
up on Riverside Drive, right across the street from me?"</p>

<p>"I don't belong," said the mucker gruffly.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you rather belong?" insisted the girl.</p>

<p>All his life Billy had looked with contempt upon the hated,
pusillanimous highbrows, and now to be asked if he would not rather
be one! It was unthinkable, and yet, strange to relate, he realized
an odd longing to be like Thérière, and Billy Mallory; yes, in some
respects like Divine, even. He wanted to be more like the men that
the woman he loved knew best.</p>

<p>"It's too late fer me ever to belong, now," he said ruefully.
"Yeh gotta be borned to it. Gee! Wouldn't I look funny in wite
pants, an' one o' dem dinky, little 'Willie-off-de-yacht'
lids?"</p>

<p>Even Barbara had to laugh at the picture the man's words raised
to her imagination.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that," she hastened to explain. "I didn't mean
that you must necessarily dress like them; but <i>be</i> like
them&mdash;act like them&mdash;talk like them, as Mr. Thérière did,
you know. He was a gentleman."</p>

<p>"An' I'm not," said Billy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean <i>that</i>," the girl hastened to
explain.</p>

<p>"Well, whether youse meant it or not, it's so," said the mucker.
"I ain't no gent&mdash;I'm a mucker. I have your word for it, you
know&mdash;yeh said so that time on de <i>Halfmoon</i>, an' I ain't
fergot it; but youse was right&mdash;I am a mucker. I ain't never
learned how to be anything else. I ain't never wanted to be
anything else until today. Now, I'd like to be a gent; but it's too
late."</p>

<p>"Won't you try?" asked the girl. "For my sake?"</p>

<p>"Go to't," returned the mucker cheerfully; "I'd even wear side
whiskers fer youse."</p>

<p>"Horrors!" exclaimed Barbara Harding. "I couldn't look at you if
you did."</p>

<p>"Well, then, tell me wot youse do want me to do."</p>

<p>Barbara discovered that her task was to be a difficult one if
she were to accomplish it without wounding the man's feelings; but
she determined to strike while the iron was hot and risk offending
him&mdash;why she should be interested in the regeneration of Mr.
Billy Byrne it never once occurred to her to ask herself. She
hesitated a moment before speaking.</p>

<p>"One of the first things you must do, Mr. Byrne," she said, "is
to learn to speak correctly. You mustn't say 'youse' for 'you,' or
'wot' for 'what'&mdash;you must try to talk as I talk. No one in
the world speaks any language faultlessly, but there are certain
more or less obvious irregularities of grammar and pronunciation
that are particularly distasteful to people of refinement, and
which are easy to guard against if one be careful."</p>

<p>"All right," said Billy Byrne, "youse&mdash;you kin pitch in an'
learn me wot&mdash;whatever you want to an' I'll do me best to talk
like a dude&mdash;fer your sake."</p>

<p>And so the mucker's education commenced, and as there was little
else for the two to do it progressed rapidly, for once started the
man grew keenly interested, spurred on by the evident pleasure
which his self-appointed tutor took in his progress&mdash;further
it meant just so much more of close companionship with her.</p>

<p><br>
FOR three weeks they never left the little island except to
gather fruit which grew hard by on the adjacent mainland. Byrne's
wounds had troubled him considerably&mdash;at times he had been
threatened with blood poisoning. His temperature had mounted once
to alarming heights, and for a whole night Barbara Harding had sat
beside him bathing his forehead and easing his sufferings as far as
it lay within her power to do; but at last the wonderful vitality
of the man had saved him. He was much weakened though and neither
of them had thought it safe to attempt to seek the coast until he
had fully regained his old-time strength.</p>

<p>So far but little had occurred to give them alarm. Twice they
had seen natives on the mainland&mdash;evidently hunting parties;
but no sign of pursuit had developed. Those whom they had seen had
been pure-blood Malays&mdash;there had been no samurai among them;
but their savage, warlike appearance had warned the two against
revealing their presence.</p>

<p>They had subsisted upon fish and fruit principally since they
had come to the island. Occasionally this diet had been relieved by
messes of wild fowl and fox that Byrne had been successful in
snaring with a primitive trap of his own invention; but lately the
prey had become wary, and even the fish seemed less plentiful.
After two days of fruit diet, Byrne announced his intention of
undertaking a hunting trip upon the mainland.</p>

<p>"A mess of venison wouldn't taste half bad," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes," cried the girl, "I'm nearly famished for meat&mdash;it
seems as though I could almost eat it raw."</p>

<p>"I know that I could," stated Billy. "Lord help the deer that
gets within range of this old gat of Thérière's, and you may not
get even a mouthful&mdash;I'm that hungry I'll probably eat it all,
hoof, hide, and horns, before ever I get any of it back here to
you."</p>

<p>"You'd better not," laughed the girl. "Good-bye and good luck;
but please don't go very far&mdash;I shall be terribly lonely and
frightened while you are away."</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd better come along," suggested Billy.</p>

<p>"No, I should be in the way&mdash;you can't hunt deer with a
gallery, and get any."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll stay within hailing distance, and you can look for
me back any time between now and sundown. Good-bye," and he picked
his way down the bank into the river, while from behind a bush upon
the mainland two wicked, black eyes watched his movements and those
of the girl on the shore behind him while a long, sinewy, brown
hand closed more tightly upon a heavy war spear, and steel muscles
tensed for the savage spring and the swift throw.</p>

<p>The girl watched Billy Byrne forging his way through the swift
rapids. What a mighty engine of strength and endurance he was! What
a man! Yes, brute! And strange to relate Barbara Harding found
herself admiring the very brutality that once had been repellent to
her. She saw him leap lightly to the opposite bank, and then she
saw a quick movement in a bush close at his side. She did not know
what manner of thing had caused it, but her intuition warned her
that behind that concealing screen lay mortal danger to the
unconscious man.</p>

<p>"Billy!" she cried, the unaccustomed name bursting from her lips
involuntarily. "In the bush at your left&mdash;look out!"</p>

<p>At the note of warning in her voice Byrne had turned at her
first word&mdash;it was all that saved his life. He saw the
half-naked savage and the out-shooting spear arm, and as he would,
instinctively, have ducked a right-for-the-head in the squared
circle of his other days, he ducked now, side stepping to the
right, and the heavy weapon sped harmlessly over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The warrior, with a growl of rage, drew his sharp parang,
leaping to close quarters. Barbara Harding saw Byrne whip
Thérière's revolver from its holster, and snap it in the face of
the savage; but to her horror the cartridge failed to explode, and
before he could fire again the warrior was upon him.</p>

<p>The girl saw the white man leap to one side to escape the
furious cut aimed at him by his foe, and then she saw him turn with
the agility of a panther and spring to close quarters with the wild
man. Byrne's left arm went around the Malay's neck, and with his
heavy right fist he rained blow after blow upon the brown face.</p>

<p>The savage dropped his useless parang&mdash;clawing and biting
at the mighty creature in whose power he found himself; but never
once did those terrific, relentless blows cease to fall upon his
unprotected face.</p>

<p>The sole witness to this battle primeval stood spellbound at the
sight of the fierce, brutal ferocity of the white man, and the
lion-like strength he exhibited. Slowly but surely he was beating
the face of his antagonist into an unrecognizable pulp&mdash;with
his bare hands he had met and was killing an armed warrior. It was
incredible! Not even Thérière or Billy Mallory could have done such
a thing. Billy Mallory! And she was gazing with admiration upon his
murderer!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa15" id="chapa15">XV. &mdash; THE RESCUE</a></h2>

<p class="first">After Byrne had dropped the lifeless form of his
enemy to the ground he turned and retraced his steps toward the
island, a broad grin upon his face as he climbed to the girl's
side.</p>

<p>"I guess I'd better overhaul this gat," he said, "and stick
around home. It isn't safe to leave you alone here&mdash;I can see
that pretty plainly. Gee, supposin' I'd got out of sight before he
showed himself!" And the man shuddered visibly at the thought.</p>

<p>The girl had not spoken and the man looked up suddenly,
attracted by her silence. He saw a look of horror in her eyes, such
as he had seen there once before when he had kicked the unconscious
Thérière that time upon the <i>Halfmoon</i>.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked, alarmed. "What have I done now? I
had to croak the stiff&mdash;he'd have got me sure if I hadn't, and
then he'd have got you, too. I had to do it for your sake&mdash;I'm
sorry you saw it."</p>

<p>"It isn't that," she said slowly. "That was very brave, and very
wonderful. It's Mr. Mallory I'm thinking of. O Billy! How could you
do it?"</p>

<p>The man hung his head.</p>

<p>"Please don't," he begged. "I'd give my life to bring him back
again, for your sake. I know now that you loved him, and I've tried
to do all I could to atone for what I did to him; just as I tried
to play white with Thérière when I found that he loved you, and
intended to be on the square with you. He was your kind, and I
hoped that by helping him to win you fairly it might help to wipe
out what I had done to Mallory. I see that nothing ever can wipe
that out. I've got to go through life regretting it because you
have taught me what a brutal, cowardly thing I did. If it hadn't
been for you I'd always have been proud of it&mdash;but you and
Thérière taught me to look at things in a different way than I ever
had learned to before. I'm not sorry for that&mdash;I'm glad, for
if remorse is a part of my punishment I'll take it gladly and
welcome the chance to get a little of what's coming to me. Only
please don't look at me that way any more&mdash;it's more than I
can stand, from you."</p>

<p>It was the first time that the man ever had opened his heart in
any such whole-souled way to her, and it touched the girl more than
she would have cared to admit.</p>

<p>"It would be silly to tell you that I ever can forget that
terrible affair," she said; "but somehow I feel that the man who
did that was an entirely different man from the man who has been so
brave and chivalrous in his treatment of me during the past few
weeks."</p>

<p>"It was me that did it, though," he said; "you can't get away
from that. It'll always stick in your memory, so that you can never
think of Mr. Mallory without thinking of the damned beast that
murdered him&mdash;God! and I thought it smart!</p>

<p>"But you have no idea how I was raised, Miss Harding," he went
on. "Not that that's any excuse for the thing I did; but it does
make it seem a wonder that I ever could have made a start even at
being decent. I never was well acquainted with any human being that
wasn't a thief, or a pickpocket, or a murderer&mdash;and they were
all beasts, each in his own particular way, only they weren't as
decent as dumb beasts.</p>

<p>"I wasn't as crafty as most of them, so I had to hold my own by
brute force, and I did it; but, gad, how I accomplished it. The
idea of fighting fair," he laughed at the thought, "was utterly
unknown to me. If I'd ever have tried it I'd have seen my finish in
a hurry. No one fought fair in my gang, or in any other gang that I
ever ran up against. It was an honor to kill a man, and if you
accomplished it by kicking him to death when he was unconscious it
detracted nothing from the glory of your exploit&mdash;it was
<i>what</i> you did, not <i>how</i> you did it, that counted.</p>

<p>"I could have been decent, though, if I'd wanted to. Other
fellows who were born and raised near me were decent enough. They
got good jobs and stuck to them, and lived straight; but they made
me sick&mdash;I looked down on them, and spent my time hanging
around saloon corners rushing the can and insulting women&mdash;I
didn't want to be decent&mdash;not until I met you, and learned
to&mdash;to," he hesitated, stammering, and the red blood crept up
his neck and across his face, "and learned to want your
respect."</p>

<p>It wasn't what he had intended saying and the girl knew it.
There sprang into her mind a sudden wish to hear Billy Byrne say
the words that he had dared not say; but she promptly checked the
desire, and a moment later a qualm of self-disgust came over her
because of the weakness that had prompted her to entertain such a
wish in connection with a person of this man's station in life.</p>

<p><br>
DAYS ran into weeks, and still the two remained upon their
little island refuge. Byrne found first one excuse and then another
to delay the march to the sea. He knew that it must be made sooner
or later, and he knew, too, that its commencement would mark the
beginning of the end of his association with Miss Harding, and that
after that was ended life would be a dreary waste.</p>

<p>Either they would be picked up by a passing vessel or murdered
by the natives, but in the latter event his separation from the
woman he loved would be no more certain or absolute than in her
return to her own people, for Billy Byrne knew that he "didn't
belong" in any society that knew Miss Barbara Harding, and he
feared that once they had regained civilization there would be a
return on the girl's part to the old haughty aloofness, and that
again he would be to her only a creature of a lower order, such as
she and her kind addressed with a patronizing air as, "my man."</p>

<p>He intended, of course, to make every possible attempt to
restore her to her home; but, he argued, was it wrong to snatch a
few golden hours of happiness in return for his service, and as
partial recompense for the lifetime of lonely misery that must be
his when the woman he loved had passed out of his life forever?
Billy thought not, and so he tarried on upon "Manhattan Island," as
Barbara had christened it, and he lived in the second finest
residence in town upon the opposite side of "Riverside Drive" from
the palatial home of Miss Harding.</p>

<p>Nearly two months had passed before Billy's stock of excuses and
delay ran out, and a definite date was set for the commencement of
the journey.</p>

<p>"I believe," Miss Harding had said, "that you do not wish to be
rescued at all. Most of your reasons for postponing the trip have
been trivial and ridiculous&mdash;possibly you are afraid of the
dangers that may lie before us," she added, banteringly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you've hit it off about right," he replied with a
grin. "I don't want to be rescued, and I am very much afraid of
what lies before&mdash;me."</p>

<p>"Before <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to lose you, any way you look at it,
and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, can't you see that I love you?" he blurted
out, despite all his good intentions.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding looked at him for a moment, and then she did the
one thing that could have hurt him most&mdash;she laughed.</p>

<p>The color mounted to Billy Byrne's face, and then he went very
white.</p>

<p>The girl started to say something, and at the same instant there
came faintly to them from the mainland the sound of hoarse
shouting, and of shots.</p>

<p>Byrne turned and started on a run in the direction of the
firing, the girl following closely behind. At the island's edge he
motioned her to stop.</p>

<p>"Wait here, it will be safer," he said. "There may be white men
there&mdash;those shots sound like it, but again there may not. I
want to find out before they see you, whoever they are."</p>

<p>The sound of firing had ceased now, but loud yelling was
distinctly audible from down the river. Byrne took a step down the
bank toward the water.</p>

<p>"Wait!" whispered the girl. "Here they come now, we can see them
from here in a moment," and she dragged the mucker down behind a
bush.</p>

<p>In silence the two watched the approaching party.</p>

<p>"They're the Chinks," announced Byrne, who insisted on using
this word to describe the proud and haughty samurai.</p>

<p>"Yes, and there are two white men with them," whispered Barbara
Harding, a note of suppressed excitement in her voice.</p>

<p>"Prisoners," said Byrne. "Some of the precious bunch from the
<i>Halfmoon</i> doubtless."</p>

<p>The samurai were moving straight up the edge of the river. In a
few minutes they would pass within a hundred feet of the island.
Billy and the girl crouched low behind their shelter.</p>

<p>"I don't recognize them," said the man.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;O Mr. Byrne, it can't be possible!" cried
the girl with suppressed excitement. "Those two men are Captain
Norris and Mr. Foster, mate of the <i>Lotus</i>!"</p>

<p>Byrne half rose to his feet. The party was opposite their hiding
place now.</p>

<p>"Sit tight," he whispered. "I'm goin' to get 'em," and then,
fiercely "for your sake, because I love you&mdash;now laugh," and
he was gone.</p>

<p>He ran lightly down the river bank unnoticed by the samurai who
had already passed the island. In one hand he bore the long war
spear of the head-hunter he had slain. At his belt hung the long
sword of Oda Yorimoto, and in its holster reposed the revolver of
the Count de Cadenet.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding watched him as he forded the river, and
clambered up the opposite bank. She saw him spring rapidly after
the samurai and their prisoners. She saw his spear hand go up, and
then from the deep lungs of the man rose a savage yell that would
have done credit to a whole tribe of Apaches.</p>

<p>The warriors turned in time to see the heavy spear flying toward
them and then, as he dashed into their midst, Billy Byrne drew his
revolver and fired to right and left. The two prisoners took
advantage of the consternation of their guards to grapple with them
and possess themselves of weapons.</p>

<p>There had been but six samurai in the party, two had fallen
before Byrne's initial onslaught, but the other four, recovered
from their first surprise, turned now to battle with all the
terrific ferocity of their kind.</p>

<p>Again, at a crucial moment, had Thérière's revolver missed fire,
and in disgust Byrne discarded it, falling back upon the long sword
with which he was no match for the samurai. Norris snatched Byrne's
spear from the ground, and ran it through the body of one of the
Japs who was pressing Byrne too closely. Odds were even
now&mdash;they fought three against three.</p>

<p>Norris still clung to the spear&mdash;it was by far the most
effective weapon against the long swords of the samurai. With it he
killed his antagonist and then rushed to the assistance of
Foster.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding from the island saw that Byrne's foe was
pressing him closely. The white man had no chance against the
superior swordsmanship of the samurai. She saw that the mucker was
trying to get past the Jap's guard and get his hands upon him, but
it was evident that the man was too crafty and skilled a fighter to
permit of that. There could be but one outcome to that duel unless
Byrne had assistance, and that mighty quickly. The girl grasped the
short sword that she constantly wore now, and rushed into the
river. She had never before crossed it except in Byrne's arms. She
found the current swift and strong. It almost swept her off her
feet before she was halfway across, but she never for an instant
thought of abandoning her effort.</p>

<p>After what seemed an eternity she floundered out upon the
mainland, and when she reached the top of the bank she saw to her
delight that Byrne was still on his feet, fighting. Foster and
Norris were pushing their man back&mdash;they were in no
danger.</p>

<p>Quickly she ran toward Byrne and the samurai. She saw a wicked
smile upon the brown face of the little warrior, and then she saw
his gleaming sword twist in a sudden feint, and as Byrne lunged out
awkwardly to parry the expected blow the keen edge swerved and came
down upon his head.</p>

<p>She was an instant too late to save, but just in time to
avenge&mdash;scarcely had the samurai's sword touched the mucker
than the point of Oda Yorimoto's short sword, wielded by the fair
hand of Barbara Harding, plunged into his heart. With a shriek he
collapsed beside the body of his victim.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding threw herself beside Byrne. Apparently life was
extinct. With a little cry of horror the girl put her ear close to
the man's lips. She could hear nothing.</p>

<p>"Come back! Come back!" she wailed. "Forgive me that cruel
laugh. O Billy! Billy! I love you!" and the daughter of old Anthony
Harding, multimillionaire and scion of the oldest aristocracy that
America boasts, took the head of the Grand Avenue mucker in her
arms and covered the white, bloody face with kisses&mdash;and in
the midst of it Billy Byrne opened his eyes.</p>

<p>She was caught in the act. There was no escape, and as a crimson
flush suffused her face Billy Byrne put his arms about her and drew
her down until their lips met, and this time she did not put her
hands upon his shoulders and push him away. "I love you, Billy,"
she said simply.</p>

<p>"Remember who and what I am," he cautioned, fearful lest this
great happiness be stolen away from him because she had forgotten
for the moment.</p>

<p>"I love you Billy," she answered, "for what you <i>are</i>."</p>

<p>"Forever?"</p>

<p>"Until death do us part!"</p>

<p>And then Norris and Foster, having dispatched their man, came
running up.</p>

<p>"Is he badly hurt, madam?" cried Captain Norris.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Miss Harding; "I'm just trying to help
him up, Captain Norris," she laboriously explained in an effort to
account for her arms about Billy's neck.</p>

<p>Norris gave a start of surprise at hearing his name.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he cried. "How do you know me?" and as the girl
turned her face toward him, "Miss Harding! Thank God, Miss Harding,
you are safe."</p>

<p>"But where on earth did you come from?" asked Barbara.</p>

<p>"It's a long story, Miss Harding," replied the officer, "and the
ending of it is going to be pretty hard on you&mdash;you must try
to bear up though."</p>

<p>"You don't mean that father is dead?" she asked, a look of
terror coming to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Not that&mdash;we hope," replied Norris. "He has been taken
prisoner by these half-breed devils on the island. I doubt if they
have killed him&mdash;we were going to his rescue when we ourselves
were captured. He and Mr. Mallory were taken three days ago."</p>

<p>"Mallory!" shouted Billy Byrne, who had entirely recovered from
the blow that had merely served to stun him for a moment. "Is
Mallory alive?"</p>

<p>"He was yesterday," replied Norris; "these fellows from whom you
so bravely rescued us told us that much."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" whispered Billy Byrne.</p>

<p>"What made you think he was dead?" inquired the officer, looking
closely at Byrne as though trying to place him.</p>

<p>Another man might have attempted to evade the question but the
new Billy Byrne was no coward in any department of his moral or
physical structure.</p>

<p>"Because I thought that I had killed him," he replied, "the day
that we took the <i>Lotus</i>."</p>

<p>Captain Norris looked at the speaker in undisguised horror.</p>

<p>"You!" he cried. "You were one of those damned cut-throats!
You're the man that nearly killed poor Mr. Mallory! Miss Harding,
has he offered you any indignities?"</p>

<p>"Don't judge him rashly, Captain Norris," said the girl. "But
for him I should have been dead and worse than dead long since.
Some day I will tell you of his heroism and his chivalry, and don't
forget, Captain, that he has just saved you and Mr. Foster from
captivity and probable death."</p>

<p>"That's right," exclaimed the officer, "and I want to thank him;
but I don't understand about Mallory."</p>

<p>"Never mind about him now," said Billy Byrne. "If he's alive
that's all that counts&mdash;I haven't got his blood on my hands.
Go on with your story."</p>

<p>"Well, after that gang of pirates left us," continued the
captain, "we rigged an extra wireless that they didn't know we had,
and it wasn't long before we raised the warship <i>Alaska</i>. Her
commander put a crew on board the <i>Lotus</i> with machinists and
everything necessary to patch her up&mdash;coaled and provisioned
her and then lay by while we got her in running order. It didn't
take near as long as you would have imagined. Then we set out in
company with the warship to search for the <i>'Clarinda'</i>, as your
Captain Simms called her. We got on her track through a pirate junk
just north of Luzon&mdash;he said he'd heard from the natives of a
little out-of-the-way island near Formosa that a brigantine had
been wrecked there in the recent typhoon, and his description of
the vessel led us to believe that it might be the <i>'Clarinda'</i>, or <i>Halfmoon</i>.</p>

<p>"We made the island, and after considerable search found the
survivors. Each of 'em tried to lay the blame on the others, but
finally they all agreed that a man by the name of Thérière with a
seaman called Byrne, had taken you into the interior, and that they
had believed you dead until a few days since they had captured one
of the natives and learned that you had all escaped, and were
wandering in some part of the island unknown to them.</p>

<p>"Then we set out with a company of marines to find you. Your
father, impatient of the seeming slowness of the officer in
command, pushed ahead with Mr. Mallory, Mr. Foster, and myself, and
two of the men of the <i>Lotus</i> whom he had brought along with
us.</p>

<p>"Three days ago we were attacked and your father and Mr. Mallory
taken prisoners. The rest of us escaped, and endeavored to make our
way back to the marines, but we became confused and have been
wandering aimlessly about the island ever since until we were
surprised by these natives a few moments ago. Both the seamen were
killed in this last fight and Mr. Foster and myself taken
prisoners&mdash;the rest you know."</p>

<p>Byrne was on his feet now. He found his sword and revolver and
replaced them in his belt.</p>

<p>"You men stay here on the island and take care of Miss Harding,"
he said. "If I don't come back the marines will find you sooner or
later, or you can make your way to the coast, and work around
toward the cove. Good-bye, Miss Harding."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" cried the girl.</p>

<p>"To get your father&mdash;and Mr. Mallory," said the mucker.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa16" id="chapa16">XVI. &mdash; THE SUPREME
SACRIFICE</a></h2>

<p class="first">Through the balance of the day and all during the
long night Billy Byrne swung along his lonely way, retracing the
familiar steps of the journey that had brought Barbara Harding and
himself to the little island in the turbulent river.</p>

<p>Just before dawn he came to the edge of the clearing behind the
dwelling of the late Oda Yorimoto. Somewhere within the silent
village he was sure that the two prisoners lay.</p>

<p>During the long march he had thrashed over again and again all
that the success of his rash venture would mean to him. Of all
those who might conceivably stand between him and the woman he
loved&mdash;the woman who had just acknowledged that she loved
him&mdash;these two men were the most to be feared.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne did not for a moment believe that Anthony Harding
would look with favor upon the Grand Avenue mucker as a prospective
son-in-law. And then there was Mallory! He was sure that Barbara
had loved this man, and now should he be restored to her as from
the grave there seemed little doubt but that the old love would be
aroused in the girl's breast. The truth of the matter was that
Billy Byrne could not conceive the truth of the testimony of his
own ears&mdash;even now he scarce dared believe that the wonderful
Miss Harding loved him&mdash;him, the despised mucker!</p>

<p>But the depth of the man's love for the girl, and the
genuineness of his new-found character were proven beyond question
by the relentless severity with which he put away every thought of
himself and the consequences to him in the matter he had
undertaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">FOR HER SAKE!</span> had become his slogan. What though the results
sent him to a savage death, or to a life of lonely misery, or to
the arms of his beloved! In the face of duty the result was all the
same to Billy Byrne.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood looking at the moon-bathed village,
listening for any sign of wakefulness or life, then with all the
stealth of an Indian, and with the trained wariness of the thief
that he had been, the mucker slunk noiselessly across the clearing
to the shadows of the nearest hut.</p>

<p>He listened beneath the window through which he and Barbara and
Thérière had made their escape a few weeks before. There was no
sound from within. Cautiously he raised himself to the sill, and a
moment later dropped into the inky darkness of the interior.</p>

<p>With groping hands he felt about the room&mdash;it was
unoccupied. Then he passed to the door at the far end. Cautiously
he opened it until a narrow crack gave him a view of the dimly
lighted chamber beyond. Within all seemed asleep. The mucker pushed
the door still further open and stepped within&mdash;so must he
search every hut within the village until he had found those he
sought?</p>

<p>They were not there, and on silent feet that disturbed not even
the lightly slumbering curs the man passed out by the front
entrance into the street beyond.</p>

<p>Through a second and third hut he made his precarious way. In
the fourth a man stirred as Byrne stood upon the opposite side of
the room from the door&mdash;with a catlike bound the mucker was
beside him. Would the fellow awake? Billy scarce breathed. The
samurai turned restlessly, and then, with a start, sat up with
wide-open eyes. At the same instant iron fingers closed upon his
throat and the long sword of his dead daimio passed through his
heart.</p>

<p>Byrne held the corpse until he was positive that life was
extinct, then he dropped it quietly back upon its pallet, and
departed to search the adjoining dwelling. Here he found a large
front room, and a smaller chamber in the rear&mdash;an arrangement
similar to that in the daimio's house.</p>

<p>The front room revealed no clue to the missing men. Within the
smaller, rear room Byrne heard the subdued hum of whispered
conversation just as he was about to open the door. Like a graven
image he stood in silence, his ear glued to the frail door. For a
moment he listened thus and then his heart gave a throb of
exultation, and he could have shouted aloud in
thanksgiving&mdash;the men were conversing in English!</p>

<p>Quietly Byrne pushed open the door far enough to admit his body.
Those within ceased speaking immediately. Byrne closed the door
behind him, advancing until he felt one of the occupants of the
room. The man shrank from his touch.</p>

<p>"I guess we're done for, Mallory," said the man in a low tone;
"they've come for us."</p>

<p>"Sh-sh," warned the mucker. "Are you and Mallory alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;for God's sake who are you and where did you come
from?" asked the surprised Mr. Harding.</p>

<p>"Be still," admonished Byrne, feeling for the cords that he knew
must bind the captive.</p>

<p>He found them presently and with his jackknife cut them asunder.
Then he released Mallory.</p>

<p>"Follow me," he said, "but go quietly. Take off your shoes if
you have 'em on, and hang 'em around your neck&mdash;tie the ends
of the laces together."</p>

<p>The men did as he bid and a moment later he was leading them
across the room, filled with sleeping men, women, children, and
domestic animals. At the far side stood a rack filled with long
swords. Byrne removed two without the faintest suspicion of a
noise. He handed one to each of his companions, cautioning them to
silence with a gesture.</p>

<p>But neither Anthony Harding nor Billy Mallory had had
second-story experience, and the former struck his weapon
accidentally against the door frame with a resounding clatter that
brought half the inmates of the room, wide-eyed, to sitting
postures. The sight that met the natives' eyes had them on their
feet, yelling like madmen, and dashing toward their escaping
prisoners, in an instant.</p>

<p>"Quick!" shouted Billy Byrne. "Follow me!"</p>

<p>Down the village street the three men ran, but the shouts of the
natives had brought armed samurai to every door with a celerity
that was uncanny, and in another moment the fugitives found
themselves surrounded by a pack of howling warriors who cut at them
with long swords from every side, blocking their retreat and
hemming them in in every direction.</p>

<p>Byrne called to his companions to close in, back to back, and
thus, the gangster in advance, the three slowly fought their way
toward the end of the narrow street and the jungle beyond. The
mucker fought with his long sword in one hand and Thérière's
revolver in the other&mdash;hewing a way toward freedom for the two
men whom he knew would take his love from him.</p>

<p>Beneath the brilliant tropic moon that lighted the scene almost
as brilliantly as might the sun himself the battle waged, and
though the odds were painfully uneven the white men moved steadily,
though slowly, toward the jungle. It was evident that the natives
feared the giant white who led the three. Anthony Harding, familiar
with Japanese, could translate sufficient of their jargon to be
sure of that, had not the respectful distance most of them kept
from Byrne been ample proof.</p>

<p>Out of the village street they came at last into the clearing.
The warriors danced about them, yelling threats and taunts the
while they made occasional dashes to close quarters that they might
deliver a swift sword cut and retreat again before the great white
devil could get them with the sword that had been Oda Yorimoto's,
or the strange fire stick that spoke in such a terrifying
voice.</p>

<p>Fifty feet from the jungle Mallory went down with a spear
through the calf of his leg. Byrne saw him fall, and dropping back
lifted the man to his feet, supporting him with one arm as the two
backed slowly in front of the onpressing natives.</p>

<p>The spears were flying thick and fast now, for the samurai all
were upon the same side of the enemy and there was no danger of
injuring one of their own number with their flying weapons as there
had been when the host entirely surrounded the three men, and when
the whites at last entered the tall grasses of the jungle a perfect
shower of spears followed them.</p>

<p>With the volley Byrne went down&mdash;he had been the principal
target for the samurai and three of the heavy shafts had pierced
his body. Two were buried in his chest and one in his abdomen.</p>

<p>Anthony Harding was horrified. Both his companions were down,
and the savages were pressing closely on toward their hiding place.
Mallory sat upon the ground trying to tear the spear from his leg.
Finally he was successful. Byrne, still conscious, called to
Harding to pull the three shafts from him.</p>

<p>"What are we to do?" cried the older man. "They will get us
again as sure as fate."</p>

<p>"They haven't got us yet," said Billy. "Wait, I got a scheme.
Can you walk, Mallory?"</p>

<p>Mallory staggered to his feet.</p>

<p>"I'll see," he said, and then: "Yes, I can make it."</p>

<p>"Good," exclaimed Byrne. "Now listen. Almost due north, across
this range of hills behind us is a valley. In the center of the
valley is a river. It is a good fifteen-hour march for a well
man&mdash;it will take Mallory and you longer. Follow down the
river till you come to a little island&mdash;it should be the first
one from where you strike the river. On that island you will find
Miss Harding, Norris, and Foster. Now hurry."</p>

<p>"But you, man!" exclaimed Mallory. "We can't leave you."</p>

<p>"Never!" said Anthony Harding.</p>

<p>"You'll have to, though," replied Billy. "That's part of the
scheme. It won't work any other way." He raised his revolver and
fired a single shot in the direction of the howling savages.
"That's to let 'em know we're still here," he said. "I'll keep that
up, off and on, as long as I can. It'll fool 'em into thinking that
we're all here, and cover your escape. See?"</p>

<p>"I won't do it," said Mallory.</p>

<p>"Yes you will," replied the mucker. "It's not any of us that
counts&mdash;it's Miss Harding. As many as can have got to get back
to her just as quick as the Lord'll let us. I can't, so you two'll
have to. I'm done for&mdash;a blind man could see that. It wouldn't
do a bit of good for you two to hang around here and get killed,
waitin' for me to die; but it would do a lot of harm, for it might
mean that Miss Harding would be lost too."</p>

<p>"You say my daughter is on this island you speak of, with Norris
and Foster&mdash;is she quite safe and well?" asked Harding.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said Byrne; "and now beat it&mdash;you're wasting a
lot of precious time."</p>

<p>"For Barbara's sake it looks like the only way," said Anthony
Harding, "but it seems wicked and cowardly to desert a noble fellow
like you, sir."</p>

<p>"It is wicked," said Billy Mallory. "There must be some other
way. By the way, old man, who are you anyhow, and how did you
happen to be here?"</p>

<p>Byrne turned his face upward so that the full moon lighted his
features clearly.</p>

<p>"There is no other way, Mallory," he said. "Now take a good look
at me&mdash;don't you recognize me?"</p>

<p>Mallory gazed intently at the strong face looking into his. He
shook his head.</p>

<p>"There is something familiar about your face," he said; "but I
cannot place you. Nor does it make any difference who you
are&mdash;you have risked your life to save ours and I shall not
leave you. Let Mr. Harding go&mdash;it is not necessary for both to
stay."</p>

<p>"You will both go," insisted Byrne; "and you will find that it
does make a big difference who I am. I hadn't intended telling you,
but I see there is no other way. I'm the mucker that nearly killed
you on board the <i>Lotus</i>, Mallory. I'm the fellow that
man-handled Miss Harding until even that beast of a Simms made me
quit, and Miss Harding has been alone with me on this island for
weeks&mdash;now go!"</p>

<p>He turned away so that they could no longer see his face, with
the mental anguish that he knew must be writ large upon it, and
commenced firing toward the natives once more.</p>

<p>Anthony Harding stood with white face and clinched hands during
Byrne's recital of his identity. At its close he took a threatening
step toward the prostrate man, raising his long sword, with a
muffled oath. Billy Mallory sprang before him, catching his
upraised arm.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he whispered. "Think what we owe him now. Come!" and
the two men turned north into the jungle while Billy Byrne lay upon
his belly in the tall grass firing from time to time into the
direction from which came an occasional spear.</p>

<p>Anthony Harding and Billy Mallory kept on in silence along their
dismal way. The crack of the mucker's revolver, growing fainter and
fainter, as they drew away from the scene of conflict, apprised the
men that their rescuer still lived.</p>

<p>After a time the distant reports ceased. The two walked on in
silence for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"He's gone," whispered Mallory.</p>

<p>Anthony Harding made no response. They did not hear any further
firing behind them. On and on they trudged. Night turned to day.
Day rolled slowly on into night once more. And still they staggered
on, footsore and weary. Mallory suffered excruciating agony from
his wound. There were times when it seemed that it would be
impossible for him to continue another yard; but then the thought
that Barbara Harding was somewhere ahead of them, and that in a
short time now they must be with her once more kept him doggedly at
his painful task.</p>

<p>They had reached the river and were following slowly down its
bank. The moon, full and gorgeous, flooded the landscape with
silvery light.</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed Mallory. "The island!"</p>

<p>"Thank God!" whispered Harding, fervently.</p>

<p>On the bank opposite they stopped and hallooed. Almost instantly
three figures rushed from the interior of the island to the shore
before them&mdash;two men and a woman.</p>

<p>"Barbara!" cried Anthony Harding. "O my daughter! My
daughter!"</p>

<p>Norris and Foster hastened through the river and brought the two
men to the island. Barbara Harding threw herself into her father's
arms. A moment later she had grasped Mallory's outstretched hands,
and then she looked beyond them for another.</p>

<p>"Mr. Byrne?" she asked. "Where is Mr. Byrne?"</p>

<p>"He is dead," said Anthony Harding.</p>

<p>The girl looked, wide-eyed and uncomprehending, at her father
for a full minute.</p>

<p>"Dead!" she moaned, and fell unconscious at his feet.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa17" id="chapa17">XVII. &mdash; HOME AGAIN</a></h2>

<p class="first">Billy Byrne continued to fire intermittently for
half an hour after the two men had left him. Then he fired several
shots in quick succession, and dragging himself to his hands and
knees crawled laboriously and painfully back into the jungle in
search of a hiding place where he might die in peace.</p>

<p>He had progressed some hundred yards when he felt the earth give
way beneath him. He clutched frantically about for support, but
there was none, and with a sickening lunge he plunged downward into
Stygian darkness.</p>

<p>His fall was a short one, and he brought up with a painful thud
at the bottom of a deer pit&mdash;a covered trap which the natives
dig to catch their fleet-footed prey.</p>

<p>The pain of his wounds after the fall was excruciating. His head
whirled dizzily. He knew that he was dying, and then all went
black.</p>

<p><br>
WHEN consciousness returned to the mucker it was daylight. The
sky above shone through the ragged hole that his falling body had
broken in the pit's covering the night before.</p>

<p>"Gee!" muttered the mucker; "and I thought that I was dead!"</p>

<p>His wounds had ceased to bleed, but he was very weak and stiff
and sore.</p>

<p>"I guess I'm too tough to croak!" he thought.</p>

<p>He wondered if the two men would reach Barbara in safety. He
hoped so. Mallory loved her, and he was sure that Barbara had loved
Mallory. He wanted her to be happy. No thought of jealousy entered
his mind. Mallory was her kind. Mallory "belonged." He didn't. He
was a mucker. How would he have looked training with her bunch. She
would have been ashamed of him, and he couldn't have stood that.
No, it was better as it had turned out. He'd squared himself for
the beast he'd been to her, and he'd squared himself with Mallory,
too. At least they'd have only decent thoughts of him, dead; but
alive, that would be an entirely different thing. He would be in
the way. He would be a constant embarrassment to them all, for they
would feel that they'd have to be nice to him in return for what he
had done for them. The thought made the mucker sick.</p>

<p>"I'd rather croak," he murmured.</p>

<p>But he didn't "croak"&mdash;instead, he waxed stronger, and
toward evening the pangs of hunger and thirst drove him to consider
means for escaping from his hiding place, and searching for food
and water.</p>

<p>He waited until after dark, and then he crawled, with utmost
difficulty, from the deep pit. He had heard nothing of the natives
since the night before, and now, in the open, there came to him but
the faint sounds of the village life across the clearing.</p>

<p>Byrne dragged himself toward the trail that led to the spring
where poor Thérière had died. It took him a long time to reach it,
but at last he was successful. The clear, cold water helped to
revive and strengthen him. Then he sought food. Some wild fruit
partially satisfied him for the moment, and he commenced the
laborious task of retracing his steps toward "Manhattan
Island."</p>

<p>The trail that he had passed over in fifteen hours as he had
hastened to the rescue of Anthony Harding and Billy Mallory
required the better part of three days now. Occasionally he
wondered why in the world he was traversing it anyway. Hadn't he
wanted to die, and leave Barbara free? But life is sweet, and the
red blood still flowed strong in the veins of the mucker.</p>

<p>"I can go my own way," he thought, "and not bother her; but I'll
be dinged if I want to croak in this God-forsaken hole&mdash;Grand
Avenue for mine, when it comes to passing in my checks. Gee! but
I'd like to hear the rattle of the Lake Street 'L' and see the
dolls coming down the station steps by Skidmore's when the crowd
comes home from the Loop at night."</p>

<p>Billy Byrne was homesick. And then, too, his heart was very
heavy and sad because of the great love he had found&mdash;a love
which he realized was as hopeless as it was great. He had the
memory, though, of the girl's arms about his neck, and her dear
lips crushed to his for a brief instant, and her words&mdash;ah,
those words! They would ring in Billy's head forever: "I love you,
Billy, for what you <i>are</i>."</p>

<p>And a sudden resolve came into the mucker's mind as he whispered
those words over and over again to himself. "I can't have her," he
said. "She isn't for the likes of me; but if I can't live with her,
I can live for her&mdash;as she'd want me to live, and, s'help me,
those words'll keep me straight. If she ever hears of Billy Byrne
again it won't be anything to make her ashamed that she had her
arms around him, kissing him, and telling him that she loved
him."</p>

<p>At the river's edge across from the little island Billy came to
a halt. He had reached the point near midnight, and hesitated to
cross over and disturb the party at that hour. At last, however, he
decided to cross quietly, and lie down near <i>her</i> hut until
morning.</p>

<p>The crossing was most difficult, for he was very weak, but at
last he came to the opposite bank and drew himself up to lie
panting for a few minutes on the sloping bank. Then he crawled on
again up to the top, and staggering to his feet made his way
cautiously toward the two huts. All was quiet. He assumed that the
party was asleep, and so he lay down near the rude shelter he had
constructed for Barbara Harding, and fell asleep.</p>

<p><br>
IT was broad daylight when he awoke&mdash;the sun was fully
three hours high, and yet no one was stirring. For the first time
misgivings commenced to assail Billy's mind. Could it be possible?
He crossed over to his own hut and entered&mdash;it was deserted.
Then he ran to Barbara's&mdash;it, too, was unoccupied. They had
gone!</p>

<p>All during the painful trip from the village to the island Billy
had momentarily expected to meet a party of rescuers coming back
for him. He had not been exactly disappointed, but a queer little
lump had risen to his throat as the days passed and no help had
come, and now this was the final blow. They had deserted him! Left
him wounded and dying on this savage island without taking the
trouble to assure themselves that he really was dead! It was
incredible!</p>

<p>"But was it?" thought Billy. "Didn't I tell them that I was
dying? I thought so myself, and there is no reason why they
shouldn't have thought so too. I suppose I shouldn't blame them,
and I don't; but I wouldn't have left them that way and not come
back. They had a warship full of blue jackets and
marines&mdash;there wouldn't have been much danger to them."</p>

<p>Presently it occurred to him that the party may have returned to
the coast to get the marines, and that even now they were searching
for him. He hastened to return to the mainland, and once more he
took up his wearisome journey.</p>

<p><br>
THAT night he reached the coast. Early the next morning he
commenced his search for the man-of-war. By walking entirely around
the island he should find her he felt sure.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon he scaled a high promontory which jutted out
into the sea. From its summit he had an unobstructed view of the
broad Pacific. His heart leaped to his throat, for there but a
short distance out were a great battleship and a trim white
yacht&mdash;the <i>Alaska</i> and the <i>Lotus</i>! They were
steaming slowly out to sea.</p>

<p>He was just in time! Filled with happiness the mucker ran to the
point of the promontory and stripping off his shirt waved it high
above his head, the while he shouted at the top of his lungs; but
the vessels kept on their course, giving no answering signal.</p>

<p>For half an hour the man continued his futile efforts to attract
the attention of someone on board either craft, but to his dismay
he saw them grow smaller and smaller until in a few hours they
passed over the rim of the world, disappearing from his view
forever.</p>

<p>Weak, wounded, and despairing, Billy sank to the ground, burying
his face in his arms, and there the moon found him when she rose,
and he was still there when she passed from the western sky.</p>

<p><br>
FOR three months Billy Byrne lived his lonely life upon the wild
island. The trapping and fishing were good and there was a
plentiful supply of good water. He regained his lost strength,
recovering entirely from his wounds. The natives did not molest
him, for he had stumbled upon a section of the shore which they
considered bewitched and to which none of them would come under any
circumstances.</p>

<p>One morning, at the beginning of his fourth month of solitude,
the mucker saw a smudge of smoke upon the horizon. Slowly it
increased in volume and the speck beneath it resolved itself into
the hull of a steamer. Closer and closer to the island it came.</p>

<p>Billy gathered together a quantity of dry brush and lighted a
signal fire on the lofty point from which he had seen the
<i>Alaska</i> and the <i>Lotus</i> disappear. As it commenced to
blaze freely he threw fresh, green boughs upon it until a vertical
column of smoke arose high above the island.</p>

<p>In breathless suspense Billy watched the movements of the
steamer. At first it seemed that she would pass without taking
notice of his signal, but at last he saw that she was changing her
course and moving directly toward the island.</p>

<p>Close in she came, for the sea was calm and the water deep, and
when Billy was sure that those on board saw him and his frantic
waving, he hurried, stumbling and falling, down the steep face of
the cliff to the tiny beach at its foot.</p>

<p>Already a boat had been lowered and was putting in for land.
Billy waded out to the end of the short shelving beach and
waited.</p>

<p>The sight that met the eyes of the rescuers was one that filled
them with awe, for they saw before them a huge, giant of a white
man, half-naked except for a few tattered rags, who wore the long
sword of an ancient samurai at his side, a modern revolver at his
hip, and bore in his brawny hand the heavy war spear of a
head-hunter. Long black hair, and a huge beard covered the man's
head and face, but clean gray eyes shone from out of the tangle,
and a broad grin welcomed them.</p>

<p>"Oh, you white men!" shouted the mucker. "You certainly do look
good to me."</p>

<p><br>
SIX months later a big, smooth-faced giant in ill-fitting sea
togs strolled up Sixth Avenue. It was Billy Byrne&mdash;broke, but
happy; Grand Avenue was less than a thousand miles away!</p>

<p>"Gee!" he murmured; "but it's good to be home again!"</p>

<p>There were places in New York where Billy would find
acquaintances. One in particular he recalled&mdash;a little,
third-floor gymnasium not far distant from the Battery. Thither he
turned his steps now. As he entered the stuffy room in which two
big fellows, stripped to the waist, were sparring, a stout,
low-browed man sitting in a back-tilted chair against one wall
looked up inquiringly. Billy crossed over to him, with outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>"Howdy, Professor!" he said.</p>

<p>"Yeh got me, kid," replied Professor Cassidy, taking the
proffered hand.</p>

<p>"I was up here with Larry Hilmore and the Goose Island Kid a
year or so ago&mdash;my name's Byrne," exclaimed Billy.</p>

<p>"Sure," said the professor; "I gotcha now. You're de guy 'at
Larry was a tellin' me about. He said you'd be a great heavy if
you'd leave de booze alone."</p>

<p>Billy smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>"You don't look much like a booze fighter now," remarked
Cassidy.</p>

<p>"And I ain't" said the mucker. "I've been on the wagon for most
a year, and I'm never comin' down."</p>

<p>"That's right, kid," said the professor; "but wots the good
word? Wot you doin' in little ol' Noo York?"</p>

<p>"Lookin' for a job," said Billy.</p>

<p>"Strip!" commanded Professor Cassidy. "I'm lookin' for sparrin'
partners for a gink dat's goin' to clean up de Big Smoke&mdash;if
he'll ever come back an' scrap."</p>

<p>"You're on," said Billy, commencing to divest himself of his
outer clothing.</p>

<p>Stripped to the waist he displayed as wondrous a set of muscles
as even Professor Cassidy had ever seen. The man waxed enthusiastic
over them.</p>

<p>"You sure ought to have some wallop up your sleeve," he said,
admiringly. He then introduced Billy to the Harlem Hurricane, and
Battling Dago Pete. "Pete's de guy I was tellin' you about,"
explained Professor Cassidy. "He's got such a wallop dat I can't
keep no sparrin' partners for him. The Hurricane here's de only
bloke wit de guts to stay wit him&mdash;he's a fiend for
punishment, Hurricane is; he jest natchrly eats it.</p>

<p>"If you're broke I'll give you your keep as long as you stay wit
Pete an' don't get cold feet, an' I'll fix up a mill for you now
an' then so's you kin pull down a little coin fer yourself. Are you
game?"</p>

<p>"You know it," said Billy.</p>

<p>"All to the good then," said the professor gaily; "now you put
on the mitts an' spell Hurricane for a couple o' rounds."</p>

<p>Billy slipped his huge hands into the tight-fitting gloves.</p>

<p>"It's been more'n a year since I had these on," he said, "an' I
may be a little slow an' stale at first; but after I get warmed up
I'll do better."</p>

<p>Cassidy grinned and winked at Hurricane. "He won't never get
warmed up," Hurricane confided; "Pete'll knock his block off in
about two minutes," and the men settled back to watch the fun with
ill-concealed amusement written upon their faces.</p>

<p>What happened within the next few minutes in the stuffy little
room of Professor Cassidy's third-floor "gymnasium" marks an epoch
in the professor's life&mdash;he still talks of it, and doubtless
shall until the Great Referee counts him out in the Last Round.</p>

<p>The two men sparred for a moment, gaging one another. Then
Battling Dago Pete swung a vicious left that landed square on
Billy's face. It was a blow that might have felled an ox; but Billy
only shook his head&mdash;it scarce seemed to jar him. Pete had
half lowered his hands as he recovered from the blow, so sure he
was that it would finish his new sparring partner, and now before
he could regain his guard the mucker tore into him like a
whirlwind. That single blow to the face seemed to have brought back
to Billy Byrne all that he ever had known of the manly art of
self-defense.</p>

<p>Battling Dago Pete landed a few more before the fight was over,
but as any old fighter will tell you there is nothing more
discouraging than to discover that your most effective blows do not
faze your opponent, and only the knowledge of what a defeat at the
hands of a new sparring partner would mean to his future, kept him
plugging away at the hopeless task of attempting to knock out this
mountain of bone and muscle.</p>

<p>For a few minutes Billy Byrne played with his man, hitting him
when and where he would. He fought, crouching, much as Jeffries
used to fight, and in his size and strength was much that reminded
Cassidy of the fallen idol that in his heart of hearts he still
worshiped.</p>

<p>And then, like a panther, the mucker sprang in with a vicious
left hook to the jaw, followed, with lightning rapidity, by a right
upper cut to the chin that lifted Battling Dago Pete a foot from
the floor to drop him, unconscious, against the foot of the further
wall.</p>

<p>It was a clean knock-out, and when Cassidy and Hurricane got
through ministering to the fallen man, and indications of returning
consciousness were apparent, the professor turned to Billy.</p>

<p>"Got any more 'hopes' lyin' around loose?" asked the mucker with
a grin. "I guess the big dinge's safe for a while yet."</p>

<p>"Not if you'll keep on stayin' away from the booze, kid," said
Professor Cassidy, "an' let me handle you."</p>

<p>"I gotcha Steve," said Billy; "go to it; but first, stake me to
a feed. The front side of my stomach's wrapped around my back
bone."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapa18" id="chapa18">XVIII. &mdash; THE GULF
BETWEEN</a></h2>

<p class="first">For three months Billy met has-beens, and
third-and fourth-rate fighters from New York and its environs. He
thrashed them all&mdash;usually by the knockout route and finally
local sports commenced talking about him a bit, and he was matched
up with second-raters from other cities.</p>

<p>These men he cleaned up as handily as he had the others, so that
it was apparent to fight fandom that the big, quiet "unknown" was a
comer; and pretty soon Professor Cassidy received an offer from
another trainer-manager to match Billy against a real "hope" who
stood in the forefront of hopedom.</p>

<p>This other manager stated that he thought the mill would prove
excellent practice for his man who was having difficulty in finding
opponents. Professor Cassidy thought so too, and grinned for two
hours straight after reading the challenge.</p>

<p>The details of the fight were quickly arranged. In accordance
with the state regulations it was to be a ten round, no decision
bout&mdash;the weight of the gloves was prescribed by law.</p>

<p>The name of the "white hope" against whom Billy was to go was
sufficient to draw a fair house, and there were some there who had
seen Billy in other fights and looked for a good mill. When the
"coming champion," as Billy's opponent was introduced, stepped into
the ring he received a hearty round of applause, whereas there was
but a scattered ripple of handclapping to greet the mucker. It was
the first time he ever had stepped into a ring with a first-rate
fighter, and as he saw the huge muscles of his antagonist and
recalled the stories he had heard of his prowess and science,
Billy, for the first time in his life, felt a tremor of
nervousness.</p>

<p>His eyes wandered across the ropes to the sea of faces turned up
toward him, and all of a sudden Billy Byrne went into a blue funk.
Professor Cassidy, shrewd and experienced, saw it even as soon as
Billy realized it&mdash;he saw the fading of his high
hopes&mdash;he saw his castles in Spain tumbling in ruins about his
ears&mdash;he saw his huge giant lying prone within that squared
circle as the hand of the referee rose and fell in cadence to the
ticking of seconds that would count his man out.</p>

<p>"Here," he whispered, "take a swig o' this," and he pressed a
bottle toward Billy's lips.</p>

<p>Billy shook his head. The stuff had kept him down all his
life&mdash;he had sworn never to touch another drop of it, and he
never would, whether he lost this and every other fight he ever
fought. He had sworn to leave it alone for <i>her</i> sake! And
then the gong called him to the center of the ring.</p>

<p>Billy knew that he was afraid&mdash;he thought that he was
afraid of the big, trained fighter who faced him; but Cassidy knew
that it was a plain case of stage fright that had gripped his man.
He knew, too, that it would be enough to defeat Billy's every
chance for victory, and after the big "white hope" had felled Billy
twice in the first minute of the first round Cassidy knew that it
was all over but the shouting.</p>

<p>The fans, many of them, were laughing, and yelling derogatory
remarks at Billy.</p>

<p>"Stan' up an' fight, yeh big stiff!" and "Back to de farm fer
youse!" and then, high above the others a shrill voice cried
"Coward! Coward!"</p>

<p>The word penetrated Billy's hopeless, muddled brain. Coward!
<i>she</i> had called him that once, and then she had changed her
mind. Thérière had thought him a coward, yet as he died he had said
that he was the bravest man he ever had known. Billy recalled the
yelling samurai with their keen swords and terrible spears. He saw
the little room in the "palace" of Oda Yorimoto, and again he faced
the brown devils who had hacked and hewed and stabbed at him that
day as he fought to save the woman he loved. Coward! What was there
in this padded ring for a man to fear who had faced death as Billy
had faced it, and without an instant's consciousness of the meaning
of the word fear? What was wrong with him, and then the shouts and
curses and taunts of the crowd smote upon his ears, and he knew. It
was the crowd! Again the heavy fist of the "coming champion"
brought Billy to the mat, and then, before further damage could be
done him, the gong saved him.</p>

<p>It was a surprised and chastened mucker that walked with bent
head to his corner after the first round. The "white hope" was
grinning and confident, and so he returned to the center of the
ring for the second round. During the short interval Billy had
thrashed the whole thing out. The crowd had gotten on his nerves.
He was trying to fight the whole crowd instead of just one
man&mdash;he would do better in this round; but the first thing
that happened after he faced his opponent sent the fans into
delirious ecstasies of shouting and hooting.</p>

<p>Billy swung his right for his foe's jaw&mdash;a terrible blow
that would have ended the fight had it landed&mdash;but the man
side-stepped it, and Billy's momentum carried him sprawling upon
his face. When he regained his feet the "white hope" was waiting
for him, and Billy went down again to lie there, quite still, while
the hand of the referee marked the seconds: One. Two. Three. Four.
Five. Six. Billy opened his eyes. Seven. Billy sat up. Eight. The
meaning of that monotonous count finally percolated to the mucker's
numbed perceptive faculties. He was being counted out! Nine! Like a
flash he was on his feet. He had forgotten the crowd.
Rage&mdash;cool, calculating rage possessed him&mdash;not the
feverish, hysterical variety that takes its victim's brains
away.</p>

<p>They had been counting out the man whom Barbara Harding had once
loved!&mdash;the man she had thought the bravest in the
world!&mdash;they were making a monkey and a coward of him! He'd
show them!</p>

<p>The "white hope" was waiting for him. Billy was scarce off his
knees before the man rushed at him wickedly, a smile playing about
his lips. It was to be the last of that smile, however. Billy met
the rush with his old familiar crouch, and stopped his man with a
straight to the body.</p>

<p>Cassidy saw it and almost smiled. He didn't think that Billy
could come back&mdash;but at least he was fighting for a minute in
his old form.</p>

<p>The surprised "hope" rushed in to punish his presuming foe. The
crowd was silent. Billy ducked beneath a vicious left swing and put
a right to the side of the "hope's" head that sent the man to his
knees. Then came the gong.</p>

<p>In the third round Billy fought carefully. He had made up his
mind that he would show this bunch of pikers that he knew how to
box, so that none might say that he had won with a lucky punch, for
Billy intended to win.</p>

<p>The round was one which might fill with delight the soul of the
fan who knows the finer points of the game. And when it was over,
while little damage had been done on either side, it left no shadow
of a doubt in the minds of those who knew that the unknown fighter
was the more skilful boxer.</p>

<p>Then came the fourth round. Of course there was no question in
the minds of the majority of the spectators as to who would win the
fight. The stranger had merely shown one of those sudden and
ephemeral bursts of form that occasionally are witnessed in every
branch of sport; but he couldn't last against such a man as the
"white hope'!&mdash;they looked for a knock-out any minute now. Nor
did they look in vain.</p>

<p>Billy was quite satisfied with the work he had done in the
preceding round. Now he would show them another style of fighting!
And he did. From the tap of the gong he rushed his opponent about
the ring at will. He hit him when and where he pleased. The man was
absolutely helpless before him. With left and right hooks Billy
rocked the "coming champion's" head from side to side. He landed
upon the swelling optics of his victim as he listed.</p>

<p>Thrice he rushed him to the ropes, and once the man fell through
them into the laps of the hooting spectators&mdash;only now they
were not hooting Billy. Until the gong Billy played with his man as
a cat might play with a mouse; yet not once had he landed a
knock-out blow.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you finish him?" cried Professor Cassidy, as Billy
returned to his corner after the round. "You had 'im goin'
man&mdash;why in the world didn't yeh finish him?"</p>

<p>"I didn't want to," said Billy; "not in that round. I'm
reserving the finish for the fifth round, and if you want to win
some money you can take the hunch!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?" asked Cassidy.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Billy. "You might make more by laying that I'd make
him take the count in the first minute of the round&mdash;you can
place a hundred of mine on that, if you will, please."</p>

<p>Cassidy took the hunch, and a moment later as the two men faced
each other he regretted his act, for to his surprise the "white
hope" came up for the fifth round smiling and confident once
more.</p>

<p>"Someone's been handin' him an earful," grumbled Cassidy, "an'
it might be all he needed to take 'im through the first minute of
the round, and maybe the whole round&mdash;I've seen that did lots
o' times."</p>

<p>As the two men met the "white hope" was the aggressor. He rushed
in to close quarters aiming a stinging blow at Billy's face, and
then to Cassidy's chagrin and the crowd's wonder, the mucker
lowered his guard and took the wallop full on the jaw. The blow
seemed never to jar him the least. The "hope" swung again, and
there stood Billy Byrne, like a huge bronze statue taking blow
after blow that would have put an ordinary man down for the
count.</p>

<p>The fans saw and appreciated the spectacular bravado of the act,
and they went wild. Cheer on cheer rose, hoarse and deafening, to
the rafters. The "white hope" lost his self-control and what little
remained of his short temper, and deliberately struck Billy a foul
blow, but before the referee could interfere the mucker swung
another just such blow as he had missed and fallen with in the
second round; but this time he did not miss&mdash;his mighty fist
caught the "coming champion" on the point of the chin, lifted him
off his feet and landed him halfway through the ropes. There he lay
while the referee tolled off the count of ten, and as the official
took Billy's hand in his and raised it aloft in signal that he had
won the fight the fickle crowd cheered and screamed in a delirium
of joy.</p>

<p>Cassidy crawled through the ropes and threw his arms around
Billy.</p>

<p>"I knew youse could do it, kid!" he screamed. "You're as good as
made now, an' you're de next champ, or I never seen one."</p>

<p><br>
THE following morning the sporting sheets hailed "Sailor" Byrne
as the greatest "white hope" of them all. Flashlights of him filled
a quarter of a page. There were interviews with him. Interviews
with the man he had defeated. Interviews with Cassidy. Interviews
with the referee. Interviews with everybody, and all were agreed
that he was the most likely heavy since Jeffries. Corbett admitted
that, while in his prime he could doubtless have bested the new
wonder, he would have found him a tough customer.</p>

<p>Everyone said that Byrne's future was assured. There was not a
man in sight who could touch him, and none who had seen him fight
the night before but would have staked his last dollar on him in a
mill with the black champion.</p>

<p>Cassidy wired a challenge to the Negro's manager, and received
an answer that was most favorable. The terms were, as usual, rather
one-sided but Cassidy accepted them, and it seemed before noon that
a fight was assured.</p>

<p>Billy was more nearly happy again than he had been since the day
he had renounced Barbara Harding to the man he thought she loved.
He read and re-read the accounts in the papers, and then searching
for more references to himself off the sporting page he ran upon
the very name that had been constantly in his thoughts for all
these months&mdash;Harding.</p>
<br>

<p class="newspaper">Persistent rumor has it that the engagement of
the beautiful Miss Harding to Wm. J. Mallory has been broken. Miss
Harding could not be seen at her father's home up to a late hour
last night. Mr. Mallory refused to discuss the matter, but would
not deny the rumor.</p>
<br>

<p>There was more, but that was all that Billy Byrne read. The
paper dropped from his hand. Battles and championships faded from
his thoughts. He sat with his eyes bent upon the floor, and his
mind was thousands of miles away across the broad Pacific upon a
little island in the midst of a turbulent stream.</p>

<p><br>
AND far uptown another sat with the same paper in her hand.
Barbara Harding was glancing through the sporting sheet in search
of the scores of yesterday's woman's golf tournament. And as she
searched her eyes suddenly became riveted upon the picture of a
giant man, and she forgot about tournaments and low scores. Hastily
she searched the heads and text until she came upon the
name&mdash;"'Sailor' Byrne!"</p>

<p>Yes! It must be he. Greedily she read and re-read all that had
been written about him. Yes, she, Barbara Harding, scion of an
aristocratic house&mdash;ultra-society girl, read and re-read the
accounts of a brutal prize fight.</p>

<p><br>
A HALF hour later a messenger boy found "Sailor" Byrne the
center of an admiring throng in Professor Cassidy's third-floor
gymnasium. With worshiping eyes taking in his new hero from head to
foot the youth handed Byrne a note.</p>

<p>He stood staring at the heavy weight until he had perused
it.</p>

<p>"Any answer?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No answer, kid," replied Byrne, "that I can't take myself," and
he tossed a dollar to the worshiping boy.</p>

<p><br>
AN hour later Billy Byrne was ascending the broad, white steps
that led to the entrance of Anthony Harding's New York house. The
servant who answered his ring eyed him suspiciously, for Billy
Byrne still dressed like a teamster on holiday. He had no card!</p>

<p>"Tell Miss Harding that Mr. Byrne has come," he said.</p>

<p>The servant left him standing in the hallway, and started to
ascend the great staircase, but halfway up he met Miss Harding
coming down.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Smith," she said. "I am expecting Mr. Byrne," and
then seeing that the fellow had not seated her visitor she added,
"He is a very dear friend." Smith faded quickly from the scene.</p>

<p>"Billy!" cried the girl, rushing toward him with out-stretched
hands. "O Billy, we thought you were dead. How long have you been
here? Why haven't you been to see me?"</p>

<p>Byrne hesitated.</p>

<p>A great, mad hope had been surging through his being since he
had read of the broken engagement and received the girl's note. And
now in her eyes, in her whole attitude, he could read, as
unmistakably as though her lips had formed the words that he had
not hoped in vain.</p>

<p>But some strange influence had seemed suddenly to come to work
upon him. Even in the brief moment of his entrance into the
magnificence of Anthony Harding's home he had felt a strange little
stricture of the throat&mdash;a choking, half-suffocating
sensation.</p>

<p>The attitude of the servant, the splendor of the furnishings,
the stateliness of the great hall, and the apartments opening upon
it&mdash;all had whispered to him that he did not "belong."</p>

<p>And now Barbara, clothed in some wondrous foreign creation,
belied by her very appearance the expression that suffused her
eyes.</p>

<p>No, Billy Byrne, the mucker, did not belong there. Nor ever
could he belong, more than Barbara ever could have "belonged" on
Grand Avenue. And Billy Byrne knew it now. His heart went cold. The
bottom seemed suddenly to have dropped out of his life.</p>

<p>Bravely he had battled to forget this wonderful creature, or,
rather, his hopeless love for her&mdash;her he could never forget.
But the note from her, and the sight of her had but served to
rekindle the old fire within his breast.</p>

<p>He thought quickly. His own life or happiness did not count.
Nothing counted now but Barbara. He had seen the lovelight in her
eyes. He thanked God that he had realized what it all would have
meant, before he let her see that he had seen it.</p>

<p>"I've been back several months," he said presently, in answer to
her question; "but I got sense enough to stay where I belong. Gee!
Wouldn't I look great comin' up here buttin' in, wit youse bunch of
highlifes?"</p>

<p>Billy slapped his thigh resoundingly and laughed in stentorian
tones that caused the eyebrows of the sensitive Smith on the floor
above to elevate in shocked horror.</p>

<p>"Den dere was de mills. I couldn't break away from me work,
could I, to chase a bunch of skirts?"</p>

<p>Barbara felt a qualm of keen disappointment that Billy had
fallen again into the old dialect that she had all but eradicated
during those days upon distant "Manhattan Island."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't o' come up atal," he went on, "if I hadn't o' read
in de poiper how youse an' Mallory had busted. I t'ought I'd breeze
in an' see wot de trouble was."</p>

<p>His eyes had been averted, mostly, as he talked. Now he swung
suddenly upon her.</p>

<p>"He's on de square, ain't he?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Barbara. She was not quite sure whether to feel
offended, or not. But the memory of Billy's antecedents came to his
rescue. Of course he didn't know that it was such terribly bad form
to broach such a subject to her, she thought.</p>

<p>"Well, then," continued the mucker, "wot's up? Mallory's de guy
fer youse. Youse loved him or youse wouldn't have got engaged to
him."</p>

<p>The statement was almost an interrogation.</p>

<p>Barbara nodded affirmatively.</p>

<p>"You see, Billy," she started, "I have always known Mr. Mallory,
and always thought that I loved him until&mdash;until&mdash;" There
was no answering light in Billy's eyes&mdash;no encouragement for
the words that were on her lips. She halted lamely. "Then," she
went on presently, "we became engaged after we reached New York. We
all thought you dead," she concluded simply.</p>

<p>"Do you think as much of him now as you did when you promised to
marry him?" he asked, ignoring her reference to himself and all
that it implied.</p>

<p>Barbara nodded.</p>

<p>"What is at the bottom of this row?" persisted Billy. He had
fallen back into the decent pronunciation that Barbara had taught
him, but neither noticed the change. For a moment he had forgotten
that he was playing a part. Then he recollected.</p>

<p>"Nothing much," replied the girl. "I couldn't rid myself of the
feeling that they had murdered you, by leaving you back there alone
and wounded. I began to think 'coward' every time I saw Mr.
Mallory. I couldn't marry him, feeling that way toward him, and,
Billy, I really never <i>loved</i> him as&mdash;as&mdash;" Again
she stumbled, but the mucker made no attempt to grasp the
opportunity opened before him.</p>

<p>Instead he crossed the library to the telephone. Running through
the book he came presently upon the number he sought. A moment
later he had his connection.</p>

<p>"Is this Mallory?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm Byrne&mdash;Billy Byrne. De guy dat cracked your puss fer
youse on de <i>Lotus</i>."</p>

<p>"Dead, hell! Not me. Say, I'm up here at Barbara's."</p>

<p>"Yes, dat's wot I said. She wants youse to beat it up here's
swift as youse kin beat it."</p>

<p>Barbara Harding stepped forward. Her eyes were blazing.</p>

<p>"How dare you?" she cried, attempting to seize the telephone
from Billy's grasp.</p>

<p>He turned his huge frame between her and the instrument. "Git a
move!" he shouted into the mouthpiece. "Good-bye!" and he hung
up.</p>

<p>Then he turned back toward the angry girl.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said. "Once youse was strong on de sob stuff wit
me, tellin' me how noble I was, an' all de different tings youse
would do fer me to repay all I done fer youse. Now youse got de
chanct."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the girl, puzzled. "What can I do for
you?"</p>

<p>"Youse kin do dis fer me. When Mallory gits here youse kin tell
him dat de engagement is all on again&mdash;see!"</p>

<p>In the wide eyes of the girl Billy read a deeper hurt than he
had dreamed of. He had thought that it would not be difficult for
her to turn back from the vulgar mucker to the polished gentleman.
And when he saw that she was suffering, and guessed that it was
because he had tried to crush her love by brute force he could
carry the game no further.</p>

<p>"O Barbara," he cried, "can't you see that Mallory is your
kind&mdash;that <i>he</i> is a fit mate for you. I have learned
since I came into this house a few minutes ago the unbridgeable
chasm that stretches between Billy Byrne, the mucker, and such as
you. Once I aspired; but now I know just as you must have always
known, that a single lifetime is far too short for a man to cover
the distance from Grand Avenue to Riverside Drive.</p>

<p>"I want you to be happy, Barbara, just as I intend to be. Back
there in Chicago there are plenty of girls on Grand Avenue as
straight and clean and fine as they make 'em on Riverside Drive.
Girls of my own kind, they are, and I'm going back there to find
the one that God intended for me. You've taught me what a good girl
can do toward making a man of a beast. You've taught me pride and
self-respect. You've taught me so much that I'd rather that I'd
died back there beneath the spears of Oda Iseka's warriors than
live here beneath the sneers and contempt of servants, and the pity
and condescension of your friends.</p>

<p>"I want you to be happy, Barbara, and so I want you to promise
me that you'll marry Billy Mallory. There isn't any man on earth
quite good enough for you; but Mallory comes nearer to it than
anyone I know. I've heard 'em talking about him around town since I
came back&mdash;and there isn't a rotten story chalked up against
him nowhere, and that's a lot more than you can say for ninety-nine
of a hundred New Yorkers that are talked about at all.</p>

<p>"And Mallory's a man, too&mdash;the kind that every woman ought
to have, only they ain't enough of 'em to go 'round. Do you
remember how he stood up there on the deck of the <i>Lotus</i> and
fought fair against my dirty tricks? He's a man and a gentleman,
Barbara&mdash;the sort you can be proud of, and that's the sort you
got to have. You see I know you.</p>

<p>"And he fought against those fellows of Yoka in the street of
Oda Iseka's village like a man should fight. There ain't any yellow
in him, Barbara, and he didn't leave me until there seemed no other
way, even in the face of the things I told them to make them go.
Don't harbor that against him&mdash;I only wonder that he didn't
croak me; your dad wanted to, and Mallory wouldn't let him."</p>

<p>"They never told me that," said Barbara.</p>

<p>The bell rang.</p>

<p>"Here he is now," said Billy. "Good-bye&mdash;I'd rather not see
him. Smith'll let me out the servants' door. Guess that'll make him
feel better. You'll do as I ask, Barbara?"</p>

<p>He had paused at the door, turning toward her as he asked the
final question.</p>

<p>The girl stood facing him. Her eyes were dim with unshed tears.
Billy Byrne swam before them in a hazy mist.</p>

<p>"You'll do as I ask, Barbara!" he repeated, but this time it was
a command.</p>

<p>As Mallory entered the room Barbara heard the door of the
servants' entrance slam behind Billy Byrne.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="part_2" id="part_2">THE RETURN OF THE MUCKER</a></h2>

<h2><a name="chapb1" id="chapb1">I. &mdash; THE MURDER TRIAL</a></h2>

<p class="first">Billy Byrne squared his broad shoulders and filled
his deep lungs with the familiar medium which is known as air in
Chicago. He was standing upon the platform of a New York Central
train that was pulling into the La Salle Street Station, and though
the young man was far from happy something in the nature of content
pervaded his being, for he was coming home.</p>

<p>After something more than a year of world wandering and strange
adventure Billy Byrne was coming back to the great West Side and
Grand Avenue.</p>

<p>Now there is not much upon either side or down the center of
long and tortuous Grand Avenue to arouse enthusiasm, nor was Billy
particularly enthusiastic about that more or less squalid
thoroughfare.</p>

<p>The thing that exalted Billy was the idea that he was coming
back to <i>show them</i>. He had left under a cloud and with a
reputation for genuine toughness and rowdyism that has seen few
parallels even in the ungentle district of his birth and
upbringing.</p>

<p>A girl had changed him. She was as far removed from Billy's
sphere as the stars themselves; but Billy had loved her and learned
from her, and in trying to become more as he knew the men of her
class were he had sloughed off much of the uncouthness that had
always been a part of him, and all of the rowdyism. Billy Byrne was
no longer the mucker.</p>

<p>He had given her up because he imagined the gulf between Grand
Avenue and Riverside Drive to be unbridgeable; but he still clung
to the ideals she had awakened in him. He still sought to be all
that she might wish him to be, even though he realized that he
never should see her again.</p>

<p>Grand Avenue would be the easiest place to forget his
sorrow&mdash;her he could never forget. And then, his newly
awakened pride urged him back to the haunts of his former life that
he might, as he would put it himself, show them. He wanted the gang
to see that he, Billy Byrne, wasn't afraid to be decent. He wanted
some of the neighbors to realize that he could work steadily and
earn an honest living, and he looked forward with delight to the
pleasure and satisfaction of rubbing it in to some of the saloon
keepers and bartenders who had helped keep him drunk some five days
out of seven, for Billy didn't drink any more.</p>

<p>But most of all he wanted to vindicate himself in the eyes of
the once-hated law. He wanted to clear his record of the unjust
charge of murder which had sent him scurrying out of Chicago over a
year before, that night that Patrolman Stanley Lasky of the Lake
Street Station had tipped him off that Sheehan had implicated him
in the murder of old man Schneider.</p>

<p>Now Billy Byrne had not killed Schneider. He had been nowhere
near the old fellow's saloon at the time of the holdup; but
Sheehan, who had been arrested and charged with the crime, was an
old enemy of Billy's, and Sheehan had seen a chance to divert some
of the suspicion from himself and square accounts with Byrne at the
same time.</p>

<p>The new Billy Byrne was ready to accept at face value everything
which seemed to belong in any way to the environment of that
exalted realm where dwelt the girl he loved. Law, order, and
justice appeared to Billy in a new light since he had rubbed elbows
with the cultured and refined.</p>

<p>He no longer distrusted or feared them. They would give him what
he sought&mdash;a square deal.</p>

<p>It seemed odd to Billy that he should be seeking anything from
the law or its minions. For years he had waged a perpetual battle
with both. Now he was coming back voluntarily to give himself up,
with every conviction that he should be exonerated quickly. Billy,
knowing his own innocence, realizing his own integrity, assumed
that others must immediately appreciate both.</p>

<p>"First," thought Billy, "I'll go take a look at little old Grand
Ave., then I'll give myself up. The trial may take a long time, an'
if it does I want to see some of the old bunch first."</p>

<p>So Billy entered an "L' coach and leaning on the sill of an open
window watched grimy Chicago rattle past until the guard's
"Granavenoo" announced the end of his journey.</p>

<p><br>
MAGGIE SHANE was sitting on the upper step of the long flight of
stairs which lean precariously against the scarred face of the
frame residence upon the second floor front of which the lares and
penates of the Shane family are crowded into three ill-smelling
rooms.</p>

<p>It was Saturday and Maggie was off. She sat there rather
disconsolate for there was a dearth of beaux for Maggie, none
having arisen to fill the aching void left by the sudden departure
of "Coke" Sheehan since that worthy gentleman had sought a more
salubrious clime&mdash;to the consternation of both Maggie Shane
and Mr. Sheehan's bondsmen.</p>

<p>Maggie scowled down upon the frowsy street filled with frowsy
women and frowsy children. She scowled upon the street cars
rumbling by with their frowsy loads. Occasionally she varied the
monotony by drawing out her chewing gum to wondrous lengths,
holding one end between a thumb and finger and the other between
her teeth.</p>

<p>Presently Maggie spied a rather pleasing figure sauntering up
the sidewalk upon her side of the street. The man was too far away
for her to recognize his features, but his size and bearing and
general appearance appealed to the lonesome Maggie. She hoped it
was someone she knew, or with whom she might easily become
acquainted, for Maggie was bored to death.</p>

<p>She patted the hair at the back of her head and righted the mop
which hung over one eye. Then she rearranged her skirts and waited.
As the man approached she saw that he was better looking than she
had even dared to hope, and that there was something extremely
familiar about his appearance. It was not, though, until he was
almost in front of the house that he looked up at the girl and she
recognized him.</p>

<p>Then Maggie Shane gasped and clutched the handrail at her side.
An instant later the man was past and continuing his way along the
sidewalk.</p>

<p>Maggie Shane glared after him for a minute, then she ran quickly
down the stairs and into a grocery store a few doors west, where
she asked if she might use the telephone.</p>

<p>"Gimme West 2063," she demanded of the operator, and a moment
later: "Is this Lake Street?"</p>

<p>"Well say, Billy Byrne's back. I just see him."</p>

<p>"Yes an' never mind who I am; but if youse guys want him he's
walkin' west on Grand Avenoo right now. I just this minute seen him
near Lincoln," and she smashed the receiver back into its hook.</p>

<p><br>
BILLY BYRNE thought that he would look in on his mother, not
that he expected to be welcomed even though she might happen to be
sober, or not that he cared to see her; but Billy's whole manner of
thought had altered within the year, and something now seemed to
tell him that it was his duty to do the thing he contemplated.
Maybe he might even be of help to her.</p>

<p>But when he reached the gloomy neighborhood in which his
childhood had been spent it was to learn that his mother was dead
and that another family occupied the tumble-down cottage that had
been his home.</p>

<p>If Billy Byrne felt any sorrow because of his mother's death he
did not reveal it outwardly. He owed her nothing but for kicks and
cuffs received, and for the surroundings and influences that had
started him upon a life of crime at an age when most boys are just
entering grammar school.</p>

<p>Really the man was relieved that he had not had to see her, and
it was with a lighter step that he turned back to retrace his way
along Grand Avenue. No one of the few he had met who recognized him
had seemed particularly delighted at his return. The whole affair
had been something of a disappointment. Therefore Billy determined
to go at once to the Lake Street Station and learn the status of
the Schneider murder case. Possibly they had discovered the real
murderer, and if that was the case Billy would be permitted to go
his way; but if not then he could give himself up and ask for a
trial, that he might be exonerated.</p>

<p>As he neared Wood Street two men who had been watching his
approach stepped into the doorway of a saloon, and as he passed
they stepped out again behind him. One upon either side they seized
him.</p>

<p>Billy turned to remonstrate.</p>

<p>"Come easy now, Byrne," admonished one of the men, "an' don't
make no fuss."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Billy, "it's you, is it? Well, I was just goin' over
to the station to give myself up."</p>

<p>Both men laughed, skeptically. "We'll just save you the
trouble," said one of them. "We'll take you over. You might lose
your way if you tried to go alone."</p>

<p>Billy went along in silence the rest of the way to where the
patrol waited at another corner. He saw there was nothing to be
gained by talking to these detectives; but he found the lieutenant
equally inclined to doubt his intentions. He, too, only laughed
when Billy assured him that he was on his way to the station at the
very instant of arrest.</p>

<p><br>
AS the weeks dragged along, and Billy Byrne found no friendly
interest in himself or his desire to live on the square, and no
belief in his protestations that he had had naught to do with the
killing of Schneider he began to have his doubts as to the wisdom
of his act.</p>

<p>He also commenced to entertain some of his former opinions of
the police, and of the law of which they are supposed to be the
guardians. A cell-mate told him that the papers had scored the
department heavily for their failure to apprehend the murderer of
the inoffensive old Schneider, and that public opinion had been so
aroused that a general police shakeup had followed.</p>

<p>The result was that the police were keen to fasten the guilt
upon someone&mdash;they did not care whom, so long as it was
someone who was in their custody.</p>

<p>"You may not o' done it," ventured the cell-mate; "but they'll
send you up for it, if they can't hang you. They're goin' to try to
get the death sentence. They hain't got no love for you, Byrne. You
caused 'em a lot o' throuble in your day an' they haven't forgot
it. I'd hate to be in your boots."</p>

<p>Billy Byrne shrugged. Where were his dreams of justice? They
seemed to have faded back into the old distrust and hatred. He
shook himself and conjured in his mind the vision of a beautiful
girl who had believed in him and trusted him&mdash;who had
inculcated within him a love for all that was finest and best in
true manhood, for the very things that he had most hated all the
years of his life before she had come into his existence to alter
it and him.</p>

<p>And then Billy would believe again&mdash;believe that in the end
justice would triumph and that it would all come out right, just
the way he had pictured it.</p>

<p>With the coming of the last day of the trial Billy found it more
and more difficult to adhere to his regard for law, order, and
justice. The prosecution had shown conclusively that Billy was a
hard customer. The police had brought witnesses who did not
hesitate to perjure themselves in their testimony&mdash;testimony
which it seemed to Billy the densest of jurymen could plainly see
had been framed up and learned by rote until it was
letter-perfect.</p>

<p>These witnesses could recall with startling accuracy every
detail that had occurred between seventeen minutes after eight and
twenty-one minutes past nine on the night of September 23 over a
year before; but where they had been and what they had done ten
minutes earlier or ten minutes later, or where they were at nine
o'clock in the evening last Friday they couldn't for the lives of
them remember.</p>

<p>And Billy was practically without witnesses.</p>

<p>The result was a foregone conclusion. Even Billy had to admit
it, and when the prosecuting attorney demanded the death penalty
the prisoner had an uncanny sensation as of the tightening of a
hempen rope about his neck.</p>

<p>As he waited for the jury to return its verdict Billy sat in his
cell trying to read a newspaper which a kindly guard had given him.
But his eyes persisted in boring through the white paper and the
black type to scenes that were not in any paper. He saw a turbulent
river tumbling through a savage world, and in the swirl of the
water lay a little island. And he saw a man there upon the island,
and a girl. The girl was teaching the man to speak the language of
the cultured, and to view life as people of refinement view it.</p>

<p>She taught him what honor meant among her class, and that it was
better to lose any other possession rather than lose honor. Billy
realized that it had been these lessons that had spurred him on to
the mad scheme that was to end now with the verdict of
"Guilty"&mdash;he had wished to vindicate his honor. A hard laugh
broke from his lips; but instantly he sobered and his face
softened.</p>

<p>It had been for her sake after all, and what mattered it if they
did send him to the gallows? He had not sacrificed his
honor&mdash;he had done his best to assert it. He was innocent.
They could kill him but they couldn't make him guilty. A thousand
juries pronouncing him so could not make it true that he had killed
Schneider.</p>

<p>But it would be hard, after all his hopes, after all the plans
he had made to live square, to <i>show them</i>. His eyes still
boring through the paper suddenly found themselves attracted by
something in the text before them&mdash;a name, Harding.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne shook himself and commenced to read:</p>
<br>

<p class="newspaper">The marriage of Barbara, daughter of Anthony
Harding, the multimillionaire, to William Mallory will take place
on the twenty-fifth of June.</p>
<br>

<p>The article was dated New York. There was more, but Billy did
not read it. He had read enough. It is true that he had urged her
to marry Mallory; but now, in his lonesomeness and friendlessness,
he felt almost as though she had been untrue to him.</p>

<p>"Come along, Byrne," a bailiff interrupted his thoughts, "the
jury's reached a verdict."</p>

<p>The judge was emerging from his chambers as Billy was led into
the courtroom. Presently the jury filed in and took their seats.
The foreman handed the clerk a bit of paper. Even before it was
read Billy knew that he had been found guilty. He did not care any
longer, so he told himself. He hoped that the judge would send him
to the gallows. There was nothing more in life for him now anyway.
He wanted to die. But instead he was sentenced to life imprisonment
in the penitentiary at Joliet.</p>

<p>This was infinitely worse than death. Billy Byrne was appalled
at the thought of remaining for life within the grim stone walls of
a prison. Once more there swept over him all the old, unreasoning
hatred of the law and all that pertained to it. He would like to
close his steel fingers about the fat neck of the red-faced judge.
The smug jurymen roused within him the lust to kill. Justice! Billy
Byrne laughed aloud.</p>

<p>A bailiff rapped for order. One of the jurymen leaned close to a
neighbor and whispered. "A hardened criminal," he said. "Society
will be safer when he is behind the bars."</p>

<p>The next day they took Billy aboard a train bound for Joliet. He
was handcuffed to a deputy sheriff. Billy was calm outwardly; but
inwardly he was a raging volcano of hate.</p>

<p><br>
IN a certain very beautiful home on Riverside Drive, New York
City, a young lady, comfortably backed by downy pillows, sat in her
bed and alternated her attention between coffee and rolls, and a
morning paper.</p>

<p>On the inside of the main sheet a heading claimed her languid
attention:</p>
<br>

<p class="headline">CHICAGO MURDERER GIVEN LIFE SENTENCE</p>
<br>

<p>Of late Chicago had aroused in Barbara Harding a greater
proportion of interest than ever it had in the past, and so it was
that she now permitted her eyes to wander casually down the printed
column.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Murderer of harmless old saloon keeper is
finally brought to justice. The notorious West Side rowdy, 'Billy'
Byrne, apprehended after more than a year as fugitive from justice,
is sent to Joliet for life."</p>

<p>Barbara Harding sat stony-eyed and cold for what seemed many
minutes. Then with a stifled sob she turned and buried her face in
the pillows.</p>

<p><br>
THE train bearing Billy Byrne and the deputy sheriff toward
Joliet had covered perhaps half the distance between Chicago and
Billy's permanent destination when it occurred to the deputy
sheriff that he should like to go into the smoker and enjoy a
cigar.</p>

<p>Now, from the moment that he had been sentenced Billy Byrne's
mind had been centered upon one thought&mdash;escape. He knew that
there probably would be not the slightest chance for escape; but
nevertheless the idea was always uppermost in his thoughts.</p>

<p>His whole being revolted, not alone against the injustice which
had sent him into life imprisonment, but at the thought of the long
years of awful monotony which lay ahead of him.</p>

<p>He could not endure them. He would not! The deputy sheriff rose,
and motioning his prisoner ahead of him, started for the smoker. It
was two cars ahead. The train was vestibuled. The first platform
they crossed was tightly enclosed; but at the second Billy saw that
a careless porter had left one of the doors open. The train was
slowing down for some reason&mdash;it was going, perhaps, twenty
miles an hour.</p>

<p>Billy was the first upon the platform. He was the first to see
the open door. It meant one of two things&mdash;a chance to escape,
or, death. Even the latter was to be preferred to life
imprisonment.</p>

<p>Billy did not hesitate an instant. Even before the deputy
sheriff realized that the door was open, his prisoner had leaped
from the moving train dragging his guard after him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapb2" id="chapb2">II. &mdash; THE ESCAPE</a></h2>

<p class="first">Byrne had no time to pick any particular spot to
jump for. When he did jump he might have been directly over a
picket fence, or a bottomless pit&mdash;he did not know. Nor did he
care.</p>

<p>As it happened he was over neither. The platform chanced to be
passing across a culvert at the instant. Beneath the culvert was a
slimy pool. Into this the two men plunged, alighting unharmed.</p>

<p>Byrne was the first to regain his feet. He dragged the deputy
sheriff to his knees, and before that frightened and astonished
officer of the law could gather his wits together he had been
relieved of his revolver and found himself looking into its cold
and business-like muzzle.</p>

<p>Then Billy Byrne waded ashore, prodding the deputy sheriff in
the ribs with cold steel, and warning him to silence. Above the
pool stood a little wood, thick with tangled wildwood. Into this
Byrne forced his prisoner.</p>

<p>When they had come deep enough into the concealment of the
foliage to make discovery from the outside improbable Byrne
halted.</p>

<p>"Now say yer prayers," he commanded. "I'm a-going to croak
yeh."</p>

<p>The deputy sheriff looked up at him in wild-eyed terror.</p>

<p>"My God!" he cried. "I ain't done nothin' to you, Byrne. Haven't
I always been your friend? What've I ever done to you? For God's
sake Byrne you ain't goin' to murder me, are you? They'll get you,
sure."</p>

<p>Billy Byrne let a rather unpleasant smile curl his lips.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "youse ain't done nothin' to me; but you stand
for the law, damn it, and I'm going to croak everything I meet that
stands for the law. They wanted to send me up for life&mdash;me, an
innocent man. Your kind done it&mdash;the cops. You ain't no cop;
but you're just as rotten. Now say yer prayers."</p>

<p>He leveled the revolver at his victim's head. The deputy sheriff
slumped to his knees and tried to embrace Billy Byrne's legs as he
pleaded for his life.</p>

<p>"Cut it out, you poor boob," admonished Billy. "You've gotta die
and if you was half a man you'd wanna die like one."</p>

<p>The deputy sheriff slipped to the ground. His terror had
overcome him, leaving him in happy unconsciousness. Byrne stood
looking down upon the man for a moment. His wrist was chained to
that of the other, and the pull of the deputy's body was
irritating.</p>

<p>Byrne stooped and placed the muzzle of the revolver back of the
man's ear. "Justice!" he muttered, scornfully, and his finger
tightened upon the trigger.</p>

<p>Then, conjured from nothing, there rose between himself and the
unconscious man beside him the figure of a beautiful girl. Her face
was brave and smiling, and in her eyes was trust and
pride&mdash;whole worlds of them. Trust and pride in Billy
Byrne.</p>

<p>Billy closed his eyes tight as though in physical pain. He
brushed his hand quickly across his face.</p>

<p>"Gawd!" he muttered. "I can't do it&mdash;but I came awful close
to it."</p>

<p>Dropping the revolver into his side pocket he kneeled beside the
deputy sheriff and commenced to go through the man's clothes. After
a moment he came upon what he sought&mdash;a key ring confining
several keys.</p>

<p>Billy found the one he wished and presently he was free. He
still stood looking at the deputy sheriff.</p>

<p>"I ought to croak you," he murmured. "I'll never make my
get-away if I don't; but SHE won't let me&mdash;God bless her."</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought came to Billy Byrne. If he could have a start
he might escape. It wouldn't hurt the man any to stay here for a
few hours, or even for a day. Billy removed the deputy's coat and
tore it into strips. With these he bound the man to a tree. Then he
fastened a gag in his mouth.</p>

<p>During the operation the deputy regained consciousness. He
looked questioningly at Billy.</p>

<p>"I decided not to croak you," explained the young man. "I'm just
a-goin' to leave you here for a while. They'll be lookin' all along
the right o' way in a few hours&mdash;it won't be long afore they
find you. Now so long, and take care of yerself, bo," and Billy
Byrne had gone.</p>

<p>A mistake that proved fortunate for Billy Byrne caused the
penitentiary authorities to expect him and his guard by a later
train, so no suspicion was aroused when they failed to come upon
the train they really had started upon. This gave Billy a good two
hours' start that he would not otherwise have had&mdash;an
opportunity of which he made good use.</p>

<p>Wherefore it was that by the time the authorities awoke to the
fact that something had happened Billy Byrne was fifty miles west
of Joliet, bowling along aboard a fast Santa Fe freight. Shortly
after night had fallen the train crossed the Mississippi. Billy
Byrne was hungry and thirsty, and as the train slowed down and came
to a stop out in the midst of a dark solitude of silent,
sweet-smelling country, Billy opened the door of his box car and
dropped lightly to the ground.</p>

<p>So far no one had seen Billy since he had passed from the ken of
the trussed deputy sheriff, and as Billy had no desire to be seen
he slipped over the edge of the embankment into a dry ditch, where
he squatted upon his haunches waiting for the train to depart. The
stop out there in the dark night was one of those mysterious stops
which trains are prone to make, unexplained and doubtless
unexplainable by any other than a higher intelligence which directs
the movements of men and rolling stock. There was no town, and not
even a switch light. Presently two staccato blasts broke from the
engine's whistle, there was a progressive jerking at coupling pins,
which started up at the big locomotive and ran rapidly down the
length of the train, there was the squeaking of brake shoes against
wheels, and the train moved slowly forward again upon its long
journey toward the coast, gaining momentum moment by moment until
finally the way-car rolled rapidly past the hidden fugitive and the
freight rumbled away to be swallowed up in the darkness.</p>

<p>When it had gone Billy rose and climbed back upon the track,
along which he plodded in the wake of the departing train.
Somewhere a road would presently cut across the track, and along
the road there would be farmhouses or a village where food and
drink might be found.</p>

<p>Billy was penniless, yet he had no doubt but that he should eat
when he had discovered food. He was thinking of this as he walked
briskly toward the west, and what he thought of induced a doubt in
his mind as to whether it was, after all, going to be so easy to
steal food.</p>

<p>"Shaw!" he exclaimed, half aloud, "she wouldn't think it wrong
for a guy to swipe a little grub when he was starvin'. It ain't
like I was goin' to stick a guy up for his roll. Sure she wouldn't
see nothin' wrong for me to get something to eat. I ain't got no
money. They took it all away from me, an' I got a right to
live&mdash;but, somehow, I hate to do it. I wisht there was some
other way. Gee, but she's made a sissy out o' me! Funny how a
feller can change. Why I almost like bein' a sissy," and Billy
Byrne grinned at the almost inconceivable idea.</p>

<p>Before Billy came to a road he saw a light down in a little
depression at one side of the track. It was not such a light as a
lamp shining beyond a window makes. It rose and fell, winking and
flaring close to the ground.</p>

<p>It looked much like a camp fire, and as Billy drew nearer he saw
that such it was, and he heard a voice, too. Billy approached more
carefully. He must be careful always to see before being seen. The
little fire burned upon the bank of a stream which the track
bridged upon a concrete arch.</p>

<p>Billy dropped once more from the right of way, and climbed a
fence into a thin wood. Through this he approached the camp fire
with small chance of being observed. As he neared it the voice
resolved itself into articulate words, and presently Billy leaned
against a tree close behind the speaker and listened.</p>

<p>There was but a single figure beside the small fire&mdash;that
of a man squatting upon his haunches roasting something above the
flames. At one edge of the fire was an empty tin can from which
steam arose, and an aroma that was now and again wafted to Billy's
nostrils.</p>

<p>Coffee! My, how good it smelled. Billy's mouth watered. But the
voice&mdash;that interested Billy almost as much as the
preparations for the coming meal.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"We'll dance a merry saraband from here to drowsy Samarcand.<br>
Along the sea, across the land, the birds are flying South,<br>
And you, my sweet Penelope, out there somewhere you wait for me,<br>
With buds of roses in your hair and kisses on your mouth."</p>
<br>

<p>The words took hold of Billy somewhere and made him forget his
hunger. Like a sweet incense which induces pleasant daydreams they
were wafted in upon him through the rich, mellow voice of the
solitary camper, and the lilt of the meter entered his blood.</p>

<p>But the voice. It was the voice of such as Billy Byrne always
had loathed and ridiculed until he had sat at the feet of Barbara
Harding and learned many things, including love. It was the voice
of culture and refinement. Billy strained his eyes through the
darkness to have a closer look at the man. The light of the camp
fire fell upon frayed and bagging clothes, and upon the back of a
head covered by a shapeless, and disreputable soft hat.</p>

<p>Obviously the man was a hobo. The coffee boiling in a discarded
tin can would have been proof positive of this without other
evidence; but there seemed plenty more. Yes, the man was a hobo.
Billy continued to stand listening.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"The mountains are all hid in mist; the valley is like amethyst,<br>
The poplar leaves they turn and twist; oh, silver, silver green!<br>
Out there somewhere along the sea a ship is waiting patiently,<br>
While up the beach the bubbles slip with white afloat between."</p>
<br>

<p>"Gee!" thought Billy Byrne; "but that's great stuff. I wonder
where he gets it. It makes me want to hike until I find that place
he's singin' about."</p>

<p>Billy's thoughts were interrupted by a sound in the wood to one
side of him. As he turned his eyes in the direction of the slight
noise which had attracted him he saw two men step quietly out and
cross toward the man at the camp fire.</p>

<p>These, too, were evidently hobos. Doubtless pals of the poetical
one. The latter did not hear them until they were directly behind
him. Then he turned slowly and rose as they halted beside his
fire.</p>

<p>"Evenin', bo," said one of the newcomers.</p>

<p>"Good evening, gentlemen," replied the camper, "welcome to my
humble home. Have you dined?"</p>

<p>"Naw," replied the first speaker, "we ain't; but we're goin' to.
Now can the chatter an' duck. There ain't enough fer one here, let
alone three. Beat it!" and the man, who was big and burly, assumed
a menacing attitude and took a truculent step nearer the solitary
camper.</p>

<p>The latter was short and slender. The larger man looked as
though he might have eaten him at a single mouthful; but the camper
did not flinch.</p>

<p>"You pain me," he said. "You induce within me a severe and
highly localized pain, and furthermore I don't like your
whiskers."</p>

<p>With which apparently irrelevant remark he seized the matted
beard of the larger tramp and struck the fellow a quick, sharp blow
in the face. Instantly the fellow's companion was upon him; but the
camper retained his death grip upon the beard of the now yelling
bully and continued to rain blow after blow upon head and face.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne was an interested spectator. He enjoyed a good fight
as he enjoyed little else; but presently when the first tramp
succeeded in tangling his legs about the legs of his chastiser and
dragging him to the ground, and the second tramp seized a heavy
stick and ran forward to dash the man's brains out, Billy thought
it time to interfere.</p>

<p>Stepping forward he called aloud as he came: "Cut it out, boes!
You can't pull off any rough stuff like that with this here sweet
singer. Can it! Can it!" as the second tramp raised his stick to
strike the now prostrate camper.</p>

<p>As he spoke Billy Byrne broke into a run, and as the stick fell
he reached the man's side and swung a blow to the tramp's jaw that
sent the fellow spinning backward to the river's brim, where he
tottered drunkenly for a moment and then plunged backward into the
shallow water.</p>

<p>Then Billy seized the other attacker by the shoulder and dragged
him to his feet.</p>

<p>"Do you want some, too, you big stiff?" he inquired.</p>

<p>The man spluttered and tried to break away, striking at Billy as
he did so; but a sudden punch, such a punch as Billy Byrne had once
handed the surprised Harlem Hurricane, removed from the mind of the
tramp the last vestige of any thought he might have harbored to do
the newcomer bodily injury, and with it removed all else from the
man's mind, temporarily.</p>

<p>As the fellow slumped, unconscious, to the ground, the camper
rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Some wallop you have concealed in your sleeve, my friend," he
said; "place it there!" and he extended a slender, shapely
hand.</p>

<p>Billy took it and shook it.</p>

<p>"It don't get under the ribs like those verses of yours, though,
bo," he returned.</p>

<p>"It seems to have insinuated itself beneath this guy's thick
skull," replied the poetical one, "and it's a cinch my verses, nor
any other would ever get there."</p>

<p>The tramp who had plumbed the depths of the creek's foot of
water and two feet of soft mud was crawling ashore.</p>

<p>"Whadda <i>you</i> want now?" inquired Billy Byrne. "A piece o'
soap?"</p>

<p>"I'll get youse yet," spluttered the moist one through his
watery whiskers.</p>

<p>"Ferget it," admonished Billy, "an' hit the trail." He pointed
toward the railroad right of way. "An' you, too, John L," he added
turning to the other victim of his artistic execution, who was now
sitting up. "Hike!"</p>

<p>Mumbling and growling the two unwashed shuffled away, and were
presently lost to view along the vanishing track.</p>

<p>The solitary camper had returned to his culinary effort, as
unruffled and unconcerned, apparently, as though naught had
occurred to disturb his peaceful solitude.</p>

<p>"Sit down," he said after a moment, looking up at Billy, "and
have a bite to eat with me. Take that leather easy chair. The Louis
Quatorze is too small and spindle-legged for comfort." He waved his
hand invitingly toward the sward beside the fire.</p>

<p>For a moment he was entirely absorbed in the roasting fowl
impaled upon a sharp stick which he held in his right hand. Then he
presently broke again into verse.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"Around the world and back again; we saw it all. The mist and rain<br>
In England and the hot old plain from Needles to Berdoo.<br>
We kept a-rambling all the time. I rustled grub, he rustled rhyme&mdash;<br>
Blind-baggage, hoof it, ride or climb&mdash;We always put it through."</p>
<br>

<p>"You're a good sort," he broke off, suddenly. "There ain't many
boes that would have done as much for a fellow."</p>

<p>"It was two against one," replied Billy, "an' I don't like them
odds. Besides I like your poetry. Where d'ye get it&mdash;make it
up?"</p>

<p>"Lord, no," laughed the other. "If I could do that I wouldn't be
pan-handling. A guy by the name of Henry Herbert Knibbs did them.
Great, ain't they?"</p>

<p>"They sure is. They get me right where I live," and then, after
a pause; "sure you got enough fer two, bo?"</p>

<p>"I have enough for you, old top," replied the host, "even if I
only had half as much as I have. Here, take first crack at the
ambrosia. Sorry I have but a single cup; but James has broken the
others. James is very careless. Sometimes I almost feel that I
shall have to let him go."</p>

<p>"Who's James?" asked Billy.</p>

<p>"James? Oh, James is my man," replied the other.</p>

<p>Billy looked up at his companion quizzically, then he tasted the
dark, thick concoction in the tin can.</p>

<p>"This is coffee," he announced. "I thought you said it was
ambrosia."</p>

<p>"I only wished to see if you would recognize it, my friend,"
replied the poetical one politely. "I am highly complimented that
you can guess what it is from its taste."</p>

<p>For several minutes the two ate in silence, passing the tin can
back and forth, and slicing&mdash;hacking would be more nearly
correct&mdash;pieces of meat from the half-roasted fowl. It was
Billy who broke the silence.</p>

<p>"I think," said he, "that you been stringin' me&mdash;'bout
James and ambrosia."</p>

<p>The other laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"You are not offended, I hope," said he. "This is a sad old
world, you know, and we're all looking for amusement. If a guy has
no money to buy it with, he has to manufacture it."</p>

<p>"Sure, I ain't sore," Billy assured him. "Say, spiel that part
again 'bout Penelope with the kisses on her mouth, an' you can kid
me till the cows come home."</p>

<p>The camper by the creek did as Billy asked him, while the latter
sat with his eyes upon the fire seeing in the sputtering little
flames the oval face of her who was Penelope to him.</p>

<p>When the verse was completed he reached forth his hand and took
the tin can in his strong fingers, raising it before his face.</p>

<p>"Here's to&mdash;to his Knibbs!" he said, and drank, passing the
battered thing over to his new friend.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other; "here's to his Knibbs,
and&mdash;Penelope!"</p>

<p>"Drink hearty," returned Billy Byrne.</p>

<p>The poetical one drew a sack of tobacco from his hip pocket and
a rumpled package of papers from the pocket of his shirt, extending
both toward Billy.</p>

<p>"Want the makings?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I ain't stuck on sponging," said Billy; "but maybe I can get
even some day, and I sure do want a smoke. You see I was frisked. I
ain't got nothin'&mdash;they didn't leave me a sou markee."</p>

<p>Billy reached across one end of the fire for the tobacco and
cigarette papers. As he did so the movement bared his wrist, and as
the firelight fell upon it the marks of the steel bracelet showed
vividly. In the fall from the train the metal had bitten into the
flesh.</p>

<p>His companion's eyes happened to fall upon the telltale mark.
There was an almost imperceptible raising of the man's eyebrows;
but he said nothing to indicate that he had noticed anything out of
the ordinary.</p>

<p>The two smoked on for many minutes without indulging in
conversation. The camper quoted snatches from Service and Kipling,
then he came back to Knibbs, who was evidently his favorite. Billy
listened and thought.</p>

<p>"Goin' anywheres in particular?" he asked during a momentary
lull in the recitation.</p>

<p>"Oh, south or west," replied the other. "Nowhere in
particular&mdash;any place suits me just so it isn't north or
east."</p>

<p>"That's me," said Billy.</p>

<p>"Let's travel double, then," said the poetical one. "My name's
Bridge."</p>

<p>"And mine's Billy. Here, shake," and Byrne extended his
hand.</p>

<p>"Until one of us gets wearied of the other's company," said
Bridge.</p>

<p>"You're on," replied Billy. "Let's turn in."</p>

<p>"Good," exclaimed Bridge. "I wonder what's keeping James. He
should have been here long since to turn down my bed and fix my
bath."</p>

<p>Billy grinned and rolled over on his side, his head uphill and
his feet toward the fire. A couple of feet away Bridge paralleled
him, and in five minutes both were breathing deeply in healthy
slumber.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapb3" id="chapb3">III. &mdash; "FIVE-HUNDRED DOLLARS
REWARD"</a></h2>

<p class="first">"We kept a-rambling all the time. I rustled grub,
he rustled rhyme," quoted Billy Byrne, sitting up and stretching
himself.</p>

<p>His companion roused and came to one elbow. The sun was topping
the scant wood behind them, glinting on the surface of the little
creek. A robin hopped about the sward quite close to them, and from
the branch of a tree a hundred yards away came the sweet piping of
a song bird. Farther off were the distance-subdued noises of an
awakening farm. The lowing of cows, the crowing of a rooster, the
yelping of a happy dog just released from a night of captivity.</p>

<p>Bridge yawned and stretched. Billy rose to his feet and shook
himself.</p>

<p>"This is the life," said Bridge. "Where you going?"</p>

<p>"To rustle grub," replied Billy. "That's my part o' the
sketch."</p>

<p>The other laughed. "Go to it," he said. "I hate it. That's the
part that has come nearest making me turn respectable than any
other. I hate to ask for a hand-out."</p>

<p>Billy shrugged. He'd done worse things than that in his life,
and off he trudged, whistling. He felt happier than he had for many
a day. He never had guessed that the country in the morning could
be so beautiful.</p>

<p>Behind him his companion collected the material for a fire,
washed himself in the creek, and set the tin can, filled with
water, at the edge of the kindling, and waited. There was nothing
to cook, so it was useless to light the fire. As he sat there,
thinking, his mind reverted to the red mark upon Billy's wrist, and
he made a wry face.</p>

<p>Billy approached the farmhouse from which the sounds of
awakening still emanated. The farmer saw him coming, and ceasing
his activities about the barnyard, leaned across a gate and eyed
him, none too hospitably.</p>

<p>"I wanna get something to eat," explained Billy.</p>

<p>"Got any money to pay for it with?" asked the farmer
quickly.</p>

<p>"No," said Billy; "but me partner an' me are hungry, an' we
gotta eat."</p>

<p>The farmer extended a gnarled forefinger and pointed toward the
rear of the house. Billy looked in the direction thus indicated and
espied a woodpile. He grinned good naturedly.</p>

<p>Without a word he crossed to the corded wood, picked up an ax
which was stuck in a chopping block, and, shedding his coat, went
to work. The farmer resumed his chores. Half an hour later he
stopped on his way in to breakfast and eyed the growing pile that
lay beside Billy.</p>

<p>"You don't hev to chop all the wood in the county to get a meal
from Jed Watson," he said.</p>

<p>"I wanna get enough for me partner, too," explained Billy.</p>

<p>"Well, yew've chopped enough fer two meals, son," replied the
farmer, and turning toward the kitchen door, he called: "Here, Maw,
fix this boy up with suthin' t'eat&mdash;enough fer a couple of
meals fer two on 'em."</p>

<p>As Billy walked away toward his camp, his arms laden with milk,
butter, eggs, a loaf of bread and some cold meat, he grinned rather
contentedly.</p>

<p>"A year or so ago," he mused, "I'd a stuck 'em up fer this, an'
thought I was smart. Funny how a feller'll change&mdash;an' all fer
a skirt. A skirt that belongs to somebody else now, too. Hell!
what's the difference, anyhow? She'd be glad if she knew, an' it
makes me feel better to act like she'd want. That old farmer guy,
now. Who'd ever have taken him fer havin' a heart at all? Wen I
seen him first I thought he'd like to sic the dog on me, an' there
he comes along an' tells 'Maw' to pass me a hand-out like this!
Gee! it's a funny world. She used to say that most everybody was
decent if you went at 'em right, an' I guess she knew. She knew
most everything, anyway. Lord, I wish she'd been born on Grand
Ave., or I on Riverside Drive!"</p>

<p>As Billy walked up to his waiting companion, who had touched a
match to the firewood as he sighted the numerous packages in the
forager's arms, he was repeating, over and over, as though the
words held him in the thrall of fascination: "There ain't no sweet
Penelope somewhere that's longing much for me."</p>

<p>Bridge eyed the packages as Billy deposited them carefully and
one at a time upon the grass beside the fire. The milk was in a
clean little graniteware pail, the eggs had been placed in a paper
bag, while the other articles were wrapped in pieces of
newspaper.</p>

<p>As the opening of each revealed its contents, fresh, clean, and
inviting, Bridge closed one eye and cocked the other up at
Billy.</p>

<p>"Did he die hard?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Did who die hard?" demanded the other.</p>

<p>"Why the dog, of course."</p>

<p>"He ain't dead as I know of," replied Billy.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say, my friend, that they let you get away
with all this without siccing the dog on you," said Bridge.</p>

<p>Billy laughed and explained, and the other was
relieved&mdash;the red mark around Billy's wrist persisted in
remaining uppermost in Bridge's mind.</p>

<p>When they had eaten they lay back upon the grass and smoked some
more of Bridge's tobacco.</p>

<p>"Well," inquired Bridge, "what's doing now?"</p>

<p>"Let's be hikin'," said Billy.</p>

<p>Bridge rose and stretched. "'My feet are tired and need a
change. Come on! It's up to you!'" he quoted.</p>

<p>Billy gathered together the food they had not yet eaten, and
made two equal-sized packages of it. He handed one to Bridge.</p>

<p>"We'll divide the pack," he explained, "and here, drink the rest
o' this milk, I want the pail."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with the pail?" asked Bridge.</p>

<p>"Return it," said Billy. "'Maw' just loaned it to me."</p>

<p>Bridge elevated his eyebrows a trifle. He had been mistaken,
after all. At the farmhouse the farmer's wife greeted them kindly,
thanked Billy for returning her pail&mdash;which, if the truth were
known, she had not expected to see again&mdash;and gave them each a
handful of thick, light, golden-brown cookies, the tops of which
were encrusted with sugar.</p>

<p>As they walked away Bridge sighed. "Nothing on earth like a good
woman," he said.</p>

<p>"'Maw,' or 'Penelope'?" asked Billy.</p>

<p>"Either, or both," replied Bridge. "I have no Penelope, but I
did have a mighty fine 'maw'."</p>

<p>Billy made no reply. He was thinking of the slovenly, blear-eyed
woman who had brought him into the world. The memory was far from
pleasant. He tried to shake it off.</p>

<p>"'Bridge,'" he said, quite suddenly, and apropos of nothing, in
an effort to change the subject. "That's an odd name. I've heard of
Bridges and Bridger; but I never heard Bridge before."</p>

<p>"Just a name a fellow gave me once up on the Yukon," explained
Bridge. "I used to use a few words he'd never heard before, so he
called me 'The Unabridged,' which was too long. The fellows
shortened it to 'Bridge' and it stuck. It has always stuck, and now
I haven't any other. I even think of myself, now, as Bridge. Funny,
ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Billy, and that was the end of it. He never
thought of asking his companion's true name, any more than Bridge
would have questioned him as to his, or of his past. The ethics of
the roadside fire and the empty tomato tin do not countenance such
impertinences.</p>

<p><br>
FOR several days the two continued their leisurely way toward
Kansas City. Once they rode a few miles on a freight train, but for
the most part they were content to plod joyously along the dusty
highways. Billy continued to "rustle grub," while Bridge relieved
the monotony by an occasional burst of poetry.</p>

<p>"You know so much of that stuff," said Billy as they were
smoking by their camp fire one evening, "that I'd think you'd be
able to make some up yourself."</p>

<p>"I've tried," admitted Bridge; "but there always seems to be
something lacking in my stuff&mdash;it don't get under your
belt&mdash;the divine afflatus is not there. I may start out all
right, but I always end up where I didn't expect to go, and where
nobody wants to be."</p>

<p>"'Member any of it?" asked Billy.</p>

<p>"There was one I wrote about a lake where I camped once," said
Bridge, reminiscently; "but I can only recall one stanza."</p>

<p>"Let's have it," urged Billy. "I bet it has Knibbs hangin' to
the ropes."</p>

<p>Bridge cleared his throat, and recited:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Silver are the ripples.<br>
Solemn are the dunes.<br>
Happy are the fishes,<br>
For they are full of prunes."</p>
<br>

<p>He looked up at Billy, a smile twitching at the corners of his
mouth. "How's that?" he asked.</p>

<p>Billy scratched his head.</p>

<p>"It's all right but the last line," said Billy, candidly. "There
is something wrong with that last line."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Bridge, "there is."</p>

<p>"I guess Knibbs is safe for another round at least," said
Billy.</p>

<p>Bridge was eyeing his companion, noting the broad shoulders, the
deep chest, the mighty forearm and biceps which the other's light
cotton shirt could not conceal.</p>

<p>"It is none of my business," he said presently; "but from your
general appearance, from bits of idiom you occasionally drop, and
from the way you handled those two boes the night we met I should
rather surmise that at some time or other you had been less than a
thousand miles from the w.k. roped arena."</p>

<p>"I seen a prize fight once," admitted Billy.</p>

<p><br>
IT was the day before they were due to arrive in Kansas City
that Billy earned a hand-out from a restaurant keeper in a small
town by doing some odd jobs for the man. The food he gave Billy was
wrapped in an old copy of the <i>Kansas City Star</i>. When Billy
reached camp he tossed the package to Bridge, who, in addition to
his honorable post as poet laureate, was also cook. Then Billy
walked down to the stream, near-by, that he might wash away the
grime and sweat of honest toil from his hands and face.</p>

<p>As Bridge unwrapped the package and the paper unfolded beneath
his eyes an article caught his attention&mdash;just casually at
first; but presently to the exclusion of all else. As he read his
eyebrows alternated between a position of considerable elevation to
that of a deep frown. Occasionally he nodded knowingly. Finally he
glanced up at Billy who was just rising from his ablutions. Hastily
Bridge tore from the paper the article that had attracted his
interest, folded it, and stuffed it into one of his
pockets&mdash;he had not had time to finish the reading and he
wanted to save the article for a later opportunity for careful
perusal.</p>

<p>That evening Bridge sat for a long time scrutinizing Billy
through half-closed lids, and often he found his eyes wandering to
the red ring about the other's wrist; but whatever may have been
within his thoughts he kept to himself.</p>

<p><br>
IT was noon when the two sauntered into Kansas City. Billy had a
dollar in his pocket&mdash;a whole dollar. He had earned it
assisting an automobilist out of a ditch.</p>

<p>"We'll have a swell feed," he had confided to Bridge, "an' sleep
in a bed just to learn how much nicer it is sleepin' out under the
black sky and the shiny little stars."</p>

<p>"You're a profligate, Billy," said Bridge.</p>

<p>"I dunno what that means," said Billy; "but if it's something I
shoudn't be I probably am."</p>

<p>The two went to a rooming-house of which Bridge knew, where they
could get a clean room with a double bed for fifty cents. It was
rather a high price to pay, of course, but Bridge was more or less
fastidious, and he admitted to Billy that he'd rather sleep in the
clean dirt of the roadside than in the breed of dirt one finds in
an unclean bed.</p>

<p>At the end of the hall was a washroom, and toward this Bridge
made his way, after removing his coat and throwing it across the
foot of the bed. After he had left the room Billy chanced to notice
a folded bit of newspaper on the floor beneath Bridge's coat. He
picked it up to lay it on the little table which answered the
purpose of a dresser when a single word caught his attention. It
was a name: Schneider.</p>

<p>Billy unfolded the clipping and as his eyes took in the heading
a strange expression entered them&mdash;a hard, cold gleam such as
had not touched them since the day that he abandoned the deputy
sheriff in the woods midway between Chicago and Joliet.</p>

<p>This is what Billy read:</p>
<br>

<p class="newspaper">Billy Byrne, sentenced to life imprisonment in
Joliet penitentiary for the murder of Schneider, the old West Side
saloon keeper, hurled himself from the train that was bearing him
to Joliet yesterday, dragging with him the deputy sheriff to whom
he was handcuffed.</p>

<p class="newspaper">The deputy was found a few hours later bound
and gagged, lying in the woods along the Santa Fe, not far from
Lemont. He was uninjured. He says that Byrne got a good start, and
doubtless took advantage of it to return to Chicago, where a man of
his stamp could find more numerous and safer retreats than
elsewhere.</p>
<br>

<p>There was much more&mdash;a detailed account of the crime for
the commission of which Billy had been sentenced, a full and
complete description of Billy, a record of his long years of
transgression, and, at last, the mention of a five-hundred-dollar
reward that the authorities had offered for information that would
lead to his arrest.</p>

<p>When Billy had concluded the reading he refolded the paper and
placed it in a pocket of the coat hanging upon the foot of the bed.
A moment later Bridge entered the room. Billy caught himself
looking often at his companion, and always there came to his mind
the termination of the article he had found in Bridge's
pocket&mdash;the mention of the five-hundred-dollar reward.</p>

<p>"Five hundred dollars," thought Billy, "is a lot o' coin. I just
wonder now," and he let his eyes wander to his companion as though
he might read upon his face the purpose which lay in the man's
heart. "He don't look it; but five hundred dollars is a lot o'
coin&mdash;fer a bo, and wotinell did he have that article hid in
his clothes fer? That's wot I'd like to know. I guess it's up to me
to blow."</p>

<p>All the recently acquired content which had been Billy's since
he had come upon the poetic Bridge and the two had made their
carefree, leisurely way along shaded country roadsides, or paused
beside cool brooklets that meandered lazily through sweet-smelling
meadows, was dissipated in the instant that he had realized the
nature of the article his companion had been carrying and hiding
from him.</p>

<p>For days no thought of pursuit or capture had arisen to perplex
him. He had seemed such a tiny thing out there amidst the vastness
of rolling hills, of woods, and plain that there had been induced
within him an unconscious assurance that no one could find him even
though they might seek for him.</p>

<p>The idea of meeting a plain clothes man from detective
headquarters around the next bend of a peaceful Missouri road was
so preposterous and incongruous that Billy had found it impossible
to give the matter serious thought.</p>

<p>He never before had been in the country districts of his native
land. To him the United States was all like Chicago or New York or
Milwaukee, the three cities with which he was most familiar. His
experience of unurban localities had been gained amidst the
primeval jungles of far-away Yoka. There had been no detective
sergeants there&mdash;unquestionably there could be none here.
Detective sergeants were indigenous to the soil that grew corner
saloons and poolrooms, and to none other&mdash;as well expect to
discover one of Oda Yorimoto's samurai hiding behind a fire plug on
Michigan Boulevard, as to look for one of those others along a
farm-bordered road.</p>

<p>But here in Kansas City, amidst the noises and odors that meant
a large city, it was different. Here the next man he met might be
looking for him, or if not then the very first policeman they
encountered could arrest him upon a word from Bridge&mdash;and
Bridge would get five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Just then Bridge burst forth into poetry:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"In a flannel shirt from earth's clean dirt,<br>
Here, pal, is my calloused hand!<br>
Oh, I love each day as a rover may,<br>
Nor seek to understand.<br>
To enjoy is good enough for me;<br>
The gypsy of God am I.<br>
Then here's a hail to&mdash;"</p>
<br>

<p>"Say," he interrupted himself; "what's the matter with going out
now and wrapping ourselves around that swell feed you were speaking
of?"</p>

<p>Billy rose. It didn't seem possible that Bridge could be going
to double-cross him.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"In a flannel shirt from earth's clean dirt,<br>
Here, pal, is my calloused hand!"</p>
<br>

<p>Billy repeated the lines half aloud. They renewed his confidence
in Bridge, somehow.</p>

<p>"Like them?" asked the latter.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Billy; "s'more of Knibbs?"</p>

<p>"No, Service. Come on, let's go and dine. How about the
Midland?" and he grinned at his little joke as he led the way
toward the street.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon. The sun already had set; but it still was
too light for lamps. Bridge led the way toward a certain
eating-place of which he knew where a man might dine well and from
a clean platter for two bits. Billy had been keeping his eyes open
for detectives. They had passed no uniformed police&mdash;that
would be the crucial test, thought he&mdash;unless Bridge intended
tipping off headquarters on the quiet and having the pinch made at
night after Billy had gone to bed.</p>

<p>As they reached the little restaurant, which was in a basement,
Bridge motioned Billy down ahead of him. Just for an instant he,
himself, paused at the head of the stairs and looked about. As he
did so a man stepped from the shadow of a doorway upon the opposite
side of the street.</p>

<p>If Bridge saw him he apparently gave no sign, for he turned
slowly and with deliberate steps followed Billy down into the
eating-place.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapb4" id="chapb4">IV. &mdash; ON THE TRAIL</a></h2>

<p class="first">As they entered the place Billy, who was ahead,
sought a table; but as he was about to hang up his cap and seat
himself Bridge touched his elbow.</p>

<p>"Let's go to the washroom and clean up a bit," he said, in a
voice that might be heard by those nearest.</p>

<p>"Why, we just washed before we left our room," expostulated
Billy.</p>

<p>"Shut up and follow me," Bridge whispered into his ear.</p>

<p>Immediately Billy was all suspicion. His hand flew to the pocket
in which the gun of the deputy sheriff still rested. They would
never take him alive, of that Billy was positive. He wouldn't go
back to life imprisonment, not after he had tasted the sweet
freedom of the wide spaces&mdash;such a freedom as the trammeled
city cannot offer.</p>

<p>Bridge saw the movement.</p>

<p>"Cut it," he whispered, "and follow me, as I tell you. I just
saw a Chicago dick across the street. He may not have seen you, but
it looked almighty like it. He'll be down here in about two seconds
now. Come on&mdash;we'll beat it through the rear&mdash;I know the
way."</p>

<p>Billy Byrne heaved a great sigh of relief. Suddenly he was
almost reconciled to the thought of capture, for in the instant he
had realized that it had not been so much his freedom that he had
dreaded to lose as his faith in the companion in whom he had
believed.</p>

<p>Without sign of haste the two walked the length of the room and
disappeared through the doorway leading into the washroom. Before
them was a window opening upon a squalid back yard. The building
stood upon a hillside, so that while the entrance to the
eating-place was below the level of the street in front, its rear
was flush with the ground.</p>

<p>Bridge motioned Billy to climb through the window while he shot
the bolt upon the inside of the door leading back into the
restaurant. A moment later he followed the fugitive, and then took
the lead.</p>

<p>Down narrow, dirty alleys, and through litter-piled back yards
he made his way, while Billy followed at his heels. Dusk was
gathering, and before they had gone far darkness came.</p>

<p>They neither paused nor spoke until they had left the business
portion of the city behind and were well out of the zone of bright
lights. Bridge was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>"I suppose you wonder how I knew," he said.</p>

<p>"No," replied Billy. "I seen that clipping you got in your
pocket&mdash;it fell out on the floor when you took your coat off
in the room this afternoon to go and wash."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Bridge, "I see. Well, as far as I'm concerned that's
the end of it&mdash;we won't mention it again, old man. I don't
need to tell you that I'm for you."</p>

<p>"No, not after tonight," Billy assured him.</p>

<p>They went on again for some little time without speaking, then
Billy said:</p>

<p>"I got two things to tell you. The first is that after I seen
that newspaper article in your clothes I thought you was figurin'
on double-crossin' me an' claimin' the five hun. I ought to of
known better. The other is that I didn't kill Schneider. I wasn't
near his place that night&mdash;an' that's straight."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you told me both," said Bridge. "I think we'll
understand each other better after this&mdash;we're each runnin'
away from something. We'll run together, eh?" and he extended his
hand. "In flannel shirt from earth's clean dirt, here, pal, is my
calloused hand!" he quoted, laughing.</p>

<p>Billy took the other's hand. He noticed that Bridge hadn't said
what <i>he</i> was running away from. Billy wondered; but asked no
questions.</p>

<p>South they went after they had left the city behind, out into
the sweet and silent darkness of the country. During the night they
crossed the line into Kansas, and morning found them in a
beautiful, hilly country to which all thoughts of cities, crime,
and police seemed so utterly foreign that Billy could scarce
believe that only a few hours before a Chicago detective had been
less than a hundred feet from him.</p>

<p>The new sun burst upon them as they topped a grassy hill. The
dew-bespangled blades scintillated beneath the gorgeous rays which
would presently sweep them away again into the nothingness from
which they had sprung.</p>

<p>Bridge halted and stretched himself. He threw his head back and
let the warm sun beat down upon his bronzed face.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"There's sunshine in the heart of me,<br>
My blood sings in the breeze;<br>
The mountains are a part of me,<br>
I'm fellow to the trees.<br>
My golden youth I'm squandering,<br>
Sun-libertine am I,<br>
A-wandering, a-wandering,<br>
Until the day I die."</p>
<br>

<p>And then he stood for minutes drinking in deep breaths of the
pure, sweet air of the new day. Beside him, a head taller, savagely
strong, stood Billy Byrne, his broad shoulders squared, his great
chest expanding as he inhaled.</p>

<p>"It's great, ain't it?" he said, at last. "I never knew the
country was like this, an' I don't know that I ever would have
known it if it hadn't been for those poet guys you're always
spouting.</p>

<p>"I always had an idea they was sissy fellows," he went on; "but
a guy can't be a sissy an' think the thoughts they musta thought to
write stuff that sends the blood chasin' through a feller like he'd
had a drink on an empty stomach.</p>

<p>"I used to think everybody was a sissy who wasn't a tough guy. I
was a tough guy all right, an' I was mighty proud of it. I ain't
any more an' haven't been for a long time; but before I took a
tumble to myself I'd have hated you, Bridge. I'd a-hated your fine
talk, an' your poetry, an' the thing about you that makes you hate
to touch a guy for a hand-out.</p>

<p>"I'd a-hated myself if I'd thought that I could ever talk mushy
like I am now. Gee, Bridge, but I was the limit! A girl&mdash;a
nice girl&mdash;called me a mucker once, an' a coward. I was both;
but I had the reputation of bein' the toughest guy on the West
Side, an' I thought I was a man. I nearly poked her face for
her&mdash;think of it, Bridge! I nearly did; but something stopped
me&mdash;something held my hand from it, an' lately I've liked to
think that maybe what stopped me was something in me that had
always been there&mdash;something decent that was really a part of
me. I hate to think that I was such a beast at heart as I acted
like all my life up to that minute. I began to change then. It was
mighty slow, an' I'm still a roughneck; but I'm gettin' on. She
helped me most, of course, an' now you're helpin' me a lot,
too&mdash;you an' your poetry stuff. If some dick don't get me I
may get to be a human bein' before I die."</p>

<p>Bridge laughed.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> odd," he said, "how our viewpoints change with
changed environment and the passing of the years. Time was, Billy,
when I'd have hated you as much as you would have hated me. I don't
know that I should have said hate, for that is not exactly the
word. It was more contempt that I felt for men whom I considered as
not belonging upon that intellectual or social plane to which I
considered I had been born.</p>

<p>"I thought of people who moved outside my limited sphere as 'the
great unwashed.' I pitied them, and I honestly believe now that in
the bottom of my heart I considered them of different clay than I,
and with souls, if they possessed such things, about on a par with
the souls of sheep and cows.</p>

<p>"I couldn't have seen the man in you, Billy, then, any more than
you could have seen the man in me. I have learned much since then,
though I still stick to a part of my original articles of
faith&mdash;I do believe that all men are not equal; and I know
that there are a great many more with whom I would not pal than
there are those with whom I would.</p>

<p>"Because one man speaks better English than another, or has read
more and remembers it, only makes him a better man in that
particular respect. I think none the less of you because you can't
quote Browning or Shakespeare&mdash;the thing that counts is that
you can appreciate, as I do, Service and Kipling and Knibbs.</p>

<p>"Now maybe we are both wrong&mdash;maybe Knibbs and Kipling and
Service didn't write poetry, and some people will say as much; but
whatever it is it gets you and me in the same way, and so in this
respect we are equals. Which being the case let's see if we can't
rustle some grub, and then find a nice soft spot whereon to pound
our respective ears."</p>

<p>Billy, deciding that he was too sleepy to work for food,
invested half of the capital that was to have furnished the swell
feed the night before in what two bits would purchase from a
generous housewife on a near-by farm, and then, stretching
themselves beneath the shade of a tree sufficiently far from the
road that they might not attract unnecessary observation, they
slept until after noon.</p>

<p>But their precaution failed to serve their purpose entirely. A
little before noon two filthy, bearded knights of the road
clambered laboriously over the fence and headed directly for the
very tree under which Billy and Bridge lay sleeping. In the minds
of the two was the same thought that had induced Billy Byrne and
the poetic Bridge to seek this same secluded spot.</p>

<p>There was in the stiff shuffle of the men something rather
familiar. We have seen them before&mdash;just for a few minutes it
is true; but under circumstances that impressed some of their
characteristics upon us. The very last we saw of them they were
shuffling away in the darkness along a railroad track, after
promising that eventually they would wreak dire vengeance upon
Billy, who had just trounced them.</p>

<p>Now as they came unexpectedly upon the two sleepers they did not
immediately recognize in them the objects of their recent hate.
They just stood looking stupidly down on them, wondering in what
way they might turn their discovery to their own advantage.</p>

<p>Nothing in the raiment either of Billy or Bridge indicated that
here was any particularly rich field for loot, and, too, the
athletic figure of Byrne would rather have discouraged any attempt
to roll him without first handing him the "k.o.", as the two would
have naively put it.</p>

<p>But as they gazed down upon the features of the sleepers the
eyes of one of the tramps narrowed to two ugly slits while those of
his companion went wide in incredulity and surprise.</p>

<p>"Do youse know dem guys?" asked the first, and without waiting
for a reply he went on: "Dem's de guys dat beat us up back dere de
udder side o' K. C. Do youse get 'em?"</p>

<p>"Sure?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"Sure, I'd know dem in a t'ous'n'. Le's hand 'em a couple an'
beat it," and he stooped to pick up a large stone that lay near at
hand.</p>

<p>"Cut it!" whispered the second tramp. "Youse don't know dem guys
at all. Dey may be de guys dat beats us up; but dat big stiff dere
is more dan dat. He's wanted in Chi, an' dere's half a t'ou on
'im."</p>

<p>"Who put youse jerry to all dat?" inquired the first tramp,
skeptically.</p>

<p>"I was in de still wit 'im&mdash;he croaked some guy. He's a
lifer. On de way to de pen he pushes dis dick off'n de rattler an'
makes his get-away. Dat peter-boy we meets at Quincy slips me an
earful about him. Here's w'ere we draws down de five hundred if
we're cagey."</p>

<p>"Whaddaya mean, cagey?"</p>

<p>"Why we leaves 'em alone an' goes to de nex' farm an' calls up
K. C. an' tips off de dicks, see?"</p>

<p>"Youse don't tink we'll get any o' dat five hun, do youse, wit
de dicks in on it?"</p>

<p>The other scratched his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said, rather dubiously, after a moment's deep thought;
"dey don't nobody get nothin' dat de dicks see first; but we'll get
even with dese blokes, annyway."</p>

<p>"Maybe dey'll pass us a couple bucks," said the other hopefully.
"Dey'd orter do dat much."</p>

<p><br>
DETECTIVE SERGEANT Flannagan of Headquarters, Chicago, slouched
in a chair in the private office of the chief of detectives of
Kansas City, Missouri. Sergeant Flannagan was sore. He would have
said as much himself. He had been sent west to identify a suspect
whom the Kansas City authorities had arrested; but had been unable
to do so, and had been preparing to return to his home city when
the brilliant aureole of an unusual piece of excellent fortune had
shone upon him for a moment, and then faded away through the grimy
entrance of a basement eating-place.</p>

<p>He had been walking along the street the previous evening
thinking of nothing in particular; but with eyes and ears alert as
becomes a successful police officer, when he had espied two men
approaching upon the opposite sidewalk.</p>

<p>There was something familiar in the swing of the giant frame of
one of the men. So, true to years of training, Sergeant Flannagan
melted into the shadows of a store entrance and waited until the
two should have come closer.</p>

<p>They were directly opposite him when the truth flashed upon
him&mdash;the big fellow was Billy Byrne, and there was a
five-hundred-dollar reward out for him.</p>

<p>And then the two turned and disappeared down the stairway that
led to the underground restaurant. Sergeant Flannagan saw Byrne's
companion turn and look back just as Flannagan stepped from the
doorway to cross the street after them.</p>

<p>That was the last Sergeant Flannagan had seen either of Billy
Byrne or his companion. The trail had ceased at the open window of
the washroom at the rear of the restaurant, and search as he would
he had been unable to pick it up again.</p>

<p>No one in Kansas City had seen two men that night answering the
descriptions Flannagan had been able to give&mdash;at least no one
whom Flannagan could unearth.</p>

<p>Finally he had been forced to take the Kansas City chief into
his confidence, and already a dozen men were scouring such sections
of Kansas City in which it seemed most likely an escaped murderer
would choose to hide.</p>

<p>Flannagan had been out himself for a while; but now he was in to
learn what progress, if any, had been made. He had just learned
that three suspects had been arrested and was waiting to have them
paraded before him.</p>

<p>When the door swung in and the three were escorted into his
presence Sergeant Flannagan gave a snort of disgust, indicative
probably not only of despair; but in a manner registering his
private opinion of the mental horse power and efficiency of the
Kansas City sleuths, for of the three one was a pasty-faced,
chestless youth, even then under the influence of cocaine, another
was an old, bewhiskered hobo, while the third was unquestionably a
Chinaman.</p>

<p>Even professional courtesy could scarce restrain Sergeant
Flannagan's desire toward bitter sarcasm, and he was upon the point
of launching forth into a vitriolic arraignment of everything west
of Chicago up to and including, specifically, the Kansas City
detective bureau, when the telephone bell at the chief's desk
interrupted him. He had wanted the chief to hear just what he
thought, so he waited.</p>

<p>The chief listened for a few minutes, asked several questions
and then, placing a fat hand over the transmitter, he wheeled about
toward Flannagan.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I guess I got something for you at last.
There's a bo on the wire that says he's just seen your man down
near Shawnee. He wants to know if you'll split the reward with
him."</p>

<p>Flannagan yawned and stretched.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, ironically, "that if I go down there I'll
find he's corralled a nigger," and he looked sorrowfully at the
three specimens before him.</p>

<p>"I dunno," said the chief. "This guy says he knows Byrne well,
an' that he's got it in for him. Shall I tell him you'll be
down&mdash;and split the reward?"</p>

<p>"Tell him I'll be down and that I'll treat him right," replied
Flannagan, and after the chief had transmitted the message, and
hung up the receiver: "Where is this here Shawnee, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I'll send a couple of men along with you. It isn't far across
the line, an' there won't be no trouble in getting back without
nobody knowin' anything about it&mdash;if you get him."</p>

<p>"All right," said Flannagan, his visions of five hundred already
dwindled to a possible one.</p>

<p>It was but a little past one o'clock that a touring car rolled
south out of Kansas City with Detective Sergeant Flannagan in the
front seat with the driver and two burly representatives of
Missouri law in the back.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapb5" id="chapb5">V. &mdash; ONE TURN DESERVES
ANOTHER</a></h2>

<p class="first">When the two tramps approached the farmhouse at
which Billy had purchased food a few hours before the farmer's wife
called the dog that was asleep in the summer kitchen and took a
shotgun down from its hook beside the door.</p>

<p>From long experience the lady was a reader of character&mdash;of
hobo character at least&mdash;and she saw nothing in the appearance
of either of these two that inspired even a modicum of confidence.
Now the young fellow who had been there earlier in the day and who,
wonder of wonders, had actually paid for the food she gave him, had
been of a different stamp. His clothing had proclaimed him a tramp,
but, thanks to the razor Bridge always carried, he was clean
shaven. His year of total abstinence had given him clear eyes and a
healthy skin. There was a freshness and vigor in his appearance and
carriage that inspired confidence rather than suspicion.</p>

<p>She had not mistrusted him; but these others she did mistrust.
When they asked to use the telephone she refused and ordered them
away, thinking it but an excuse to enter the house; but they argued
the matter, explaining that they had discovered an escaped murderer
hiding near-by&mdash;in fact in her own meadow&mdash;and that they
wished only to call up the Kansas City police.</p>

<p>Finally she yielded, but kept the dog by her side and the
shotgun in her hand while the two entered the room and crossed to
the telephone upon the opposite side.</p>

<p>From the conversation which she overheard the woman concluded
that, after all, she had been mistaken, not only about these two,
but about the young man who had come earlier in the day and
purchased food from her, for the description the tramp gave of the
fugitive tallied exactly with that of the young man.</p>

<p>It seemed incredible that so honest looking a man could be a
murderer. The good woman was shocked, and not a little unstrung by
the thought that she had been in the house alone when he had come
and that if he had wished to he could easily have murdered her.</p>

<p>"I hope they get him," she said, when the tramp had concluded
his talk with Kansas City. "It's awful the carryings on they is
nowadays. Why a body can't never tell who to trust, and I thought
him such a nice young man. And he paid me for what he got,
too."</p>

<p>The dog, bored by the inaction, had wandered back into the
summer kitchen and resumed his broken slumber. One of the tramps
was leaning against the wall talking with the farmer woman. The
other was busily engaged in scratching his right shin with what
remained of the heel of his left shoe. He supported himself with
one hand on a small table upon the top of which was a family
Bible.</p>

<p>Quite unexpectedly he lost his balance, the table tipped, he was
thrown still farther over toward it, and all in the flash of an eye
tramp, table, and family Bible crashed to the floor.</p>

<p>With a little cry of alarm the woman rushed forward to gather up
the Holy Book, in her haste forgetting the shotgun and leaving it
behind her leaning against the arm of a chair.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously the two tramps saw the real cause of her
perturbation. The large book had fallen upon its back, open; and as
several of the leaves turned over before coming to rest their eyes
went wide at what was revealed between.</p>

<p>United States currency in denominations of five, ten, and
twenty-dollar bills lay snugly inserted between the leaves of the
Bible. The tramp who lay on the floor, as yet too surprised to
attempt to rise, rolled over and seized the book as a football
player seizes the pigskin after a fumble, covering it with his
body, his arms, and sticking out his elbows as a further protection
to the invaluable thing.</p>

<p>At the first cry of the woman the dog rose, growling, and
bounded into the room. The tramp leaning against the wall saw the
brute coming&mdash;a mongrel hound-dog, bristling and savage.</p>

<p>The shotgun stood almost within the man's reach&mdash;a step and
it was in his hands. As though sensing the fellow's intentions the
dog wheeled from the tramp upon the floor, toward whom he had
leaped, and sprang for the other ragged scoundrel.</p>

<p>The muzzle of the gun met him halfway. There was a deafening
roar. The dog collapsed to the floor, his chest torn out. Now the
woman began to scream for help; but in an instant both the tramps
were upon her choking her to silence.</p>

<p>One of them ran to the summer kitchen, returning a moment later
with a piece of clothesline, while the other sat astride the
victim, his fingers closed about her throat. Once he released his
hold and she screamed again. Presently she was secured and gagged.
Then the two commenced to rifle the Bible.</p>

<p>Eleven hundred dollars in bills were hidden there, because the
woman and her husband didn't believe in banks&mdash;the savings of
a lifetime. In agony, as she regained consciousness, she saw the
last of their little hoard transferred to the pockets of the
tramps, and when they had finished they demanded to know where she
kept the rest, loosening her gag that she might reply.</p>

<p>She told them that that was all the money she had in the world,
and begged them not to take it.</p>

<p>"Youse've got more coin dan dis," growled one of the men, "an'
youse had better pass it over, or we'll find a way to make
youse."</p>

<p>But still she insisted that that was all. The tramp stepped into
the kitchen. A wood fire was burning in the stove. A pair of pliers
lay upon the window sill. With these he lifted one of the hot
stove-hole covers and returned to the parlor, grinning.</p>

<p>"I guess she'll remember she's got more wen dis begins to woik,"
he said. "Take off her shoes, Dink."</p>

<p>The other growled an objection.</p>

<p>"Yeh poor boob," he said. "De dicks'll be here in a little
while. We'd better be makin' our get-away wid w'at we got."</p>

<p>"Gee!" exclaimed his companion. "I clean forgot all about de
dicks," and then after a moment's silence during which his evil
face underwent various changes of expression from fear to final
relief, he turned an ugly, crooked grimace upon his companion.</p>

<p>"We got to croak her," he said. "Dey ain't no udder way. If dey
finds her alive she'll blab sure, an' dey won't be no trouble 'bout
gettin' us or identifyin' us neither."</p>

<p>The other shrugged.</p>

<p>"Le's beat it," he whined. "We can't more'n do time fer dis job
if we stop now; but de udder'll mean&mdash;" and he made a
suggestive circle with a grimy finger close to his neck.</p>

<p>"No it won't nothin' of de kind," urged his companion. "I got it
all doped out. We got lots o' time before de dicks are due. We'll
croak de skirt, an' den we'll beat it up de road <i>an' meet de
dicks</i>&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>The other was aghast.</p>

<p>"Wen did youse go nuts?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I ain't gone nuts. Wait 'til I gets t'rough. We meets de dicks,
innocent-like; but first we caches de dough in de woods. We tells
'em we hurried right on to lead 'em to dis Byrne guy, an' wen we
gets back here to de farmhouse an' finds wot's happened here we'll
be as flabbergasted as dey be."</p>

<p>"Oh, nuts!" exclaimed the other disgustedly. "Youse don't tink
youse can put dat over on any wise guy from Chi, do youse? Who will
dey tink croaked de old woman an' de ki-yi? Will dey tink dey kilt
deyreselves?"</p>

<p>"Dey'll tink Byrne an' his pardner croaked 'em, you simp,"
replied Crumb.</p>

<p>Dink scratched his head, and as the possibilities of the scheme
filtered into his dull brain a broad grin bared his yellow
teeth.</p>

<p>"You're dere, pal," he exclaimed, real admiration in his tone.
"But who's goin' to do it?"</p>

<p>"I'll do it," said Crumb. "Dere ain't no chanct of gettin' in
bad for it, so I jest as soon do the job. Get me a knife, or an ax
from de kitchen&mdash;de gat makes too much noise."</p>

<p><br>
SOMETHING awoke Billy Byrne with a start. Faintly, in the back
of his consciousness, the dim suggestion of a loud noise still
reverberated. He sat up and looked about him.</p>

<p>"I wonder what that was?" he mused. "It sounded like the report
of a gun."</p>

<p>Bridge awoke about the same time, and turned lazily over,
raising himself upon an elbow. He grinned at Billy.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said, and then:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">Says I, "Then let's be on the float. You certainly
have got my goat;<br>
You make me hungry in my throat for seeing things that's new.<br>
Out there somewhere we'll ride the range a-looking for the new and strange;<br>
My feet are tired and need a change. Come on! It's up to you!"</p>

<p><br>
"Come on, then," agreed Billy, coming to his feet.</p>

<p>As he rose there came, faintly, but distinct, the unmistakable
scream of a frightened woman. From the direction of the farmhouse
it came&mdash;from the farmhouse at which Billy had purchased their
breakfast.</p>

<p>Without waiting for a repetition of the cry Billy wheeled and
broke into a rapid run in the direction of the little cluster of
buildings. Bridge leaped to his feet and followed him, dropping
behind though, for he had not had the road work that Billy recently
had been through in his training for the battle in which he had
defeated the "white hope" that time in New York when Professor
Cassidy had wagered his entire pile upon him, nor in vain.</p>

<p><br>
DINK searched about the summer kitchen for an ax or hatchet; but
failing to find either rummaged through a table drawer until he
came upon a large carving knife. This would do the job nicely. He
thumbed the edge as he carried it back into the parlor to
Crumb.</p>

<p>The poor woman, lying upon the floor, was quite conscious. Her
eyes were wide and rolling in horror. She struggled with her bonds,
and tried to force the gag from her mouth with her tongue; but her
every effort was useless. She had heard every word that had passed
between the two men. She knew that they would carry out the plan
they had formulated and that there was no chance that they would be
interrupted in their gruesome work, for her husband had driven over
to a farm beyond Holliday, leaving before sunrise, and there was
little prospect that he would return before milking time in the
evening. The detectives from Kansas City could not possibly reach
the farm until far too late to save her.</p>

<p>She saw Dink return from the summer kitchen with the long knife.
She recalled the day she had bought that knife in town, and the
various uses to which she had put it. That very morning she had
sliced some bacon with it. How distinctly such little things
recurred to her at this frightful moment. And now the hideous
creature standing beside her was going to use it to cut her
throat.</p>

<p>She saw Crumb take the knife and feel of the blade, running his
thumb along it. She saw him stoop, his eyes turned down upon hers.
He grasped her chin and forced it upward and back, the better to
expose her throat.</p>

<p>Oh, why could she not faint? Why must she suffer all these
hideous preliminaries? Why could she not even close her eyes?</p>

<p>Crumb raised the knife and held the blade close above her bared
neck. A shudder ran through her, and then the door crashed open and
a man sprang into the room. It was Billy Byrne. Through the window
he had seen what was passing in the interior.</p>

<p>His hand fell upon Crumb's collar and jerked him backward from
his prey. Dink seized the shotgun and turned it upon the intruder;
but he was too close. Billy grasped the barrel of the weapon and
threw the muzzle up toward the ceiling as the tramp pulled the
trigger. Then he wrenched it from the man's hands, swung it once
above his head and crashed the stock down upon Dink's skull.</p>

<p>Dink went down and out for the count&mdash;for several counts,
in fact. Crumb stumbled to his feet and made a break for the door.
In the doorway he ran full into Bridge, winded, but ready. The
latter realizing that the matted one was attempting to escape,
seized a handful of his tangled beard, and, as he had done upon
another occasion, held the tramp's head in rigid position while he
planted a series of blows in the fellow's face&mdash;blows that
left Crumb as completely out of battle as was his mildewed
comrade.</p>

<p>"Watch 'em," said Billy, handing Bridge the shotgun. Then he
turned his attention to the woman. With the carving knife that was
to have ended her life he cut her bonds. Removing the gag from her
mouth he lifted her in his strong arms and carried her to the
little horsehair sofa that stood in one corner of the parlor,
laying her upon it very gently.</p>

<p>He was thinking of "Maw" Watson. This woman resembled her just a
little&mdash;particularly in her comfortable, motherly
expansiveness, and she had had a kind word and a cheery good-bye
for him that morning as he had departed.</p>

<p>The woman lay upon the sofa, breathing hard, and moaning just a
little. The shock had been almost too much even for her stolid
nerves. Presently she turned her eyes toward Billy.</p>

<p>"You are a good boy," she said, "and you come just in the nick
o' time. They got all my money. It's in their clothes," and then a
look of terror overspread her face. For the moment she had
forgotten what she had heard about this man&mdash;that he was an
escaped convict&mdash;a convicted murderer. Was she any better off
now that she had let him know about the money than she was with the
others after they discovered it?</p>

<p>At her words Bridge kneeled and searched the two tramps. He
counted the bills as he removed them from their pockets.</p>

<p>"Eleven hundred?" he asked, and handed the money to Billy.</p>

<p>"Eleven hundred, yes," breathed the woman, faintly, her eyes
horror-filled and fearful as she gazed upon Billy's face. She
didn't care for the money any more&mdash;they could have it all if
they would only let her live.</p>

<p>Billy turned toward her and held the rumpled green mass out.</p>

<p>"Here," he said; "but that's an awful lot o' coin for a woman to
have about de house&mdash;an' her all alone. You ought not to
a-done it."</p>

<p>She took the money in trembling fingers. It seemed incredible
that the man was returning it to her.</p>

<p>"But I knew it," she said finally.</p>

<p>"Knew what?" asked Billy.</p>

<p>"I knew you was a good boy. They said you was a murderer."</p>

<p>Billy's brows contracted, and an expression of pain crossed his
face.</p>

<p>"How did they come to say that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I heard them telephonin' to Kansas City to the police," she
replied, and then she sat bolt upright. "The detectives are on
their way here now," she almost screamed, "and even if you
<i>are</i> a murderer I don't care. I won't stand by and see 'em
get you after what you have done for me. I don't believe you're a
murderer anyhow. You're a good boy. My boy would be about as old
and as big as you by now&mdash;if he lives. He ran away a long time
ago&mdash;maybe you've met him. His name's Eddie&mdash;Eddie
Shorter. I ain't heard from him fer years.</p>

<p>"No," she went on, "I don't believe what they said&mdash;you got
too good a face; but if you are a murderer you get out now before
they come an' I'll send 'em on a wild-goose chase in the wrong
direction."</p>

<p>"But these," said Billy. "We can't leave these here."</p>

<p>"Tie 'em up and give me the shotgun," she said. "I'll bet they
don't come any more funny business on me." She had regained both
her composure and her nerve by this time.</p>

<p>Together Billy and Bridge trussed up the two tramps. An elephant
couldn't have forced the bonds they placed upon them. Then they
carried them down into the cellar and when they had come up again
Mrs. Shorter barred the cellar door.</p>

<p>"I reckon they won't get out of there very fast," she said. "And
now you two boys run along. Got any money?" and without waiting for
a reply she counted twenty-five dollars from the roll she had
tucked in the front of her waist and handed them to Billy.</p>

<p>"Nothin' doin'," said he; "but t'anks just the same."</p>

<p>"You got to take it," she insisted. "Let me make believe I'm
givin' it to my boy, Eddie&mdash;please," and the tears that came
to her eyes proved far more effective than her generous words.</p>

<p>"Aw, all right," said Billy. "I'll take it an' pass it along to
Eddie if I ever meet him, eh?"</p>

<p>"Now please hurry," she urged. "I don't want you to be
caught&mdash;even if you are a murderer. I wish you weren't
though."</p>

<p>"I'm not," said Billy; "but de law says I am an' what de law
says, goes."</p>

<p>He turned toward the doorway with Bridge, calling a goodbye to
the woman, but as he stepped out upon the veranda the dust of a
fast-moving automobile appeared about a bend in the road a
half-mile from the house.</p>

<p>"Too late," he said, turning to Bridge. "Here they come!"</p>

<p>The woman brushed by them and peered up the road.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "it must be them. Lordy! What'll we do?"</p>

<p>"I'll duck out the back way, that's what I'll do," said
Billy.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do a mite of good," said Mrs. Shorter, with a shake
of her head. "They'll telephone every farmer within twenty mile of
here in every direction, an' they'll get you sure. Wait! I got a
scheme. Come with me," and she turned and bustled through the
little parlor, out of a doorway into something that was half hall
and half storeroom. There was a flight of stairs leading to the
upper story, and she waddled up them as fast as her legs would
carry her, motioning the two men to follow her.</p>

<p>In a rear room was a trapdoor in the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Drag that commode under this," she told them. "Then climb into
the attic, and close the trapdoor. They won't never find you
there."</p>

<p>Billy pulled the ancient article of furniture beneath the
opening, and in another moment the two men were in the stuffy
atmosphere of the unventilated loft. Beneath them they heard Mrs.
Shorter dragging the commode back to its accustomed place, and then
the sound of her footsteps descending the stair.</p>

<p>Presently there came to them the rattling of a motor without,
followed by the voices of men in the house. For an hour, half
asphyxiated by the closeness of the attic, they waited, and then
again they heard the sound of the running engine, diminishing as
the machine drew away.</p>

<p>Shortly after, Mrs. Shorter's voice rose to them from below:</p>

<p>"You ken come down now," she said, "they've gone."</p>

<p>When they had descended she led them to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"I got a bite to eat ready for you while they was here," she
explained. "When you've done you ken hide in the barn 'til dark,
an' after that I'll have my ol' man take you 'cross to Dodson,
that's a junction, an' you'd aughter be able to git away easy
enough from there. I told 'em you started for Olathe&mdash;there's
where they've gone with the two tramps.</p>

<p>"My, but I did have a time of it! I ain't much good at
story-tellin' but I reckon I told more stories this arternoon than
I ever tole before in all my life. I told 'em that they was two of
you, an' that the biggest one hed red hair, an' the little one was
all pock-marked. Then they said you prob'ly wasn't the man at all,
an' my! how they did swear at them two tramps fer gettin' 'em way
out here on a wild-goose chase; but they're goin' to look fer you
jes' the same in Olathe, only they won't find you there," and she
laughed, a bit nervously though.</p>

<p><br>
IT was dusk when Mr. Shorter returned from Holliday, but after
he had heard his wife's story he said that he'd drive "them two
byes" all the way to Mexico, if there wasn't any better plan.</p>

<p>"Dodson's far enough," Bridge assured him, and late that night
the grateful farmer set them down at their destination.</p>

<p>An hour later they were speeding south on the Missouri
Pacific.</p>

<p>Bridge lay back, luxuriously, on the red plush of the smoker
seat.</p>

<p>"Some class to us, eh, bo?" asked Billy.</p>

<p>Bridge stretched.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"The tide-hounds race far up the shore&mdash;The hunt is on! The breakers roar!<br>
Her spars are tipped with gold, and o'er her deck the spray is flung,<br>
The buoys that frolic in the bay, they nod the way, they nod the way!<br>
The hunt is up! I am the prey! The hunter's bow is strung!"</p>
<br>

<h2><a name="chapb6" id="chapb6">VI. &mdash; "BABY BANDITS"</a></h2>

<p class="first">It was twenty-four hours before Detective Sergeant
Flannagan awoke to the fact that something had been put over on
him, and that a Kansas farmer's wife had done the putting.</p>

<p>He managed to piece it out finally from the narratives of the
two tramps, and when he had returned to the Shorter home and
listened to the contradictory and whole-souled improvisations of
Shorter <i>père</i> and <i>mère</i> he was convinced.</p>

<p>Whereupon he immediately telegraphed Chicago headquarters and
obtained the necessary authority to proceed upon the trail of the
fugitive, Byrne.</p>

<p>And so it was that Sergeant Flannagan landed in El Paso a few
days later, drawn thither by various pieces of intelligence he had
gathered en route, though with much delay and consequent
vexation.</p>

<p>Even after he had quitted the train he was none too sure that he
was upon the right trail though he at once repaired to a telegraph
office and wired his chief that he was hot on the trail of the
fugitive.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he was much hotter than he imagined, for
Billy and Bridge were that very minute not two squares from him,
debating as to the future and the best manner of meeting it before
it arrived.</p>

<p>"I think," said Billy, "that I'll duck across the border. I
won't never be safe in little old U. S., an' with things hoppin' in
Mexico the way they have been for the last few years I orter be
able to lose myself pretty well.</p>

<p>"Now you're all right, ol' top. You don't have to duck nothin'
for you ain't did nothin'. I don't know what you're runnin' away
from; but I know it ain't nothin' the police is worryin'
about&mdash;I can tell that by the way you act&mdash;so I guess
we'll split here. You'd be a boob to cross if you don't have to,
fer if Villa don't get you the Carranzistas will, unless the
Zapatistas nab you first.</p>

<p>"Comin' or goin' some greasy-mugged highbinder's bound to croak
you if you cross, from what little I've heard since we landed in El
Paso.</p>

<p>"We'll feed up together tonight, fer the last time. Then I'll
pull my freight." He was silent for a while, and then: "I hate to
do it, bo, fer you're the whitest guy I ever struck," which was a
great deal for Billy Byrne of Grand Avenue to say.</p>

<p>Bridge finished rolling a brown paper cigarette before he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Your words are pure and unadulterated wisdom, my friend," he
said. "The chances are scarcely even that two gringo hoboes would
last the week out afoot and broke in Viva Mexico; but it has been
many years since I followed the dictates of wisdom. Therefore I am
going with you."</p>

<p>Billy grinned. He could not conceal his pleasure.</p>

<p>"You're past twenty-one," he said, "an' dry behind the ears.
Let's go an' eat. There is still some of that twenty-five
left."</p>

<p>Together they entered a saloon which Bridge remembered as
permitting a very large consumption of free lunch upon the purchase
of a single schooner of beer.</p>

<p>There were round tables scattered about the floor in front of
the bar, and after purchasing their beer they carried it to one of
these that stood in a far corner of the room close to a rear
door.</p>

<p>Here Bridge sat on guard over the foaming open sesame to food
while Billy crossed to the free lunch counter and appropriated all
that a zealous attendant would permit him to carry off.</p>

<p>When he returned to the table he took a chair with his back to
the wall in conformity to a habit of long standing when, as now, it
had stood him in good stead to be in a position to see the other
fellow at least as soon as the other fellow saw him. The other
fellow being more often than not a large gentleman with a bit of
shiny metal pinned to his left suspender strap.</p>

<p>"That guy's a tight one," said Billy, jerking his hand in the
direction of the guardian of the free lunch. "I scoops up about a
good, square meal for a canary bird, an' he makes me cough up half
of it. Wants to know if I t'ink I can go into the restaurant
business on a fi'-cent schooner of suds."</p>

<p>Bridge laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, you didn't do so badly at that," he said. "I know places
where they'd indict you for grand larceny if you took much more
than you have here."</p>

<p>"Rotten beer," commented Billy.</p>

<p>"Always is rotten down here," replied Bridge. "I sometimes think
they put moth balls in it so it won't spoil."</p>

<p>Billy looked up and smiled. Then he raised his tall glass before
him.</p>

<p>"Here's to," he started; but he got no further. His eyes
traveling past his companion fell upon the figure of a large man
entering the low doorway.</p>

<p>At the same instant the gentleman's eyes fell upon Billy.
Recognition lit those of each simultaneously. The big man started
across the room on a run, straight toward Billy Byrne.</p>

<p>The latter leaped to his feet. Bridge, guessing what had
happened, rose too.</p>

<p>"Flannagan!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The detective was tugging at his revolver, which had stuck in
his hip pocket. Byrne reached for his own weapon. Bridge laid a
hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Not that, Billy!" he cried. "There's a door behind you. Here,"
and he pulled Billy backward toward the doorway in the wall behind
them.</p>

<p>Byrne still clung to his schooner of beer, which he had
transferred to his left hand as he sought to draw his gun.
Flannagan was close to them. Bridge opened the door and strove to
pull Billy through; but the latter hesitated just an instant, for
he saw that it would be impossible to close and bar the door,
provided it had a bar, before Flannagan would be against it with
his great shoulders.</p>

<p>The policeman was still struggling to disentangle his revolver
from the lining of his pocket. He was bellowing like a
bull&mdash;yelling at Billy that he was under arrest. Men at the
tables were on their feet. Those at the bar had turned around as
Flannagan started to run across the floor. Now some of them were
moving in the direction of the detective and his prey, but whether
from curiosity or with sinister intentions it is difficult to
say.</p>

<p>One thing, however, is certain&mdash;if all the love that was
felt for policemen in general by the men in that room could have
been combined in a single individual it still scarcely would have
constituted a grand passion.</p>

<p>Flannagan felt rather than saw that others were closing in on
him, and then, fortunately for himself, he thought, he managed to
draw his weapon. It was just as Billy was fading through the
doorway into the room beyond. He saw the revolver gleam in the
policeman's hand and then it became evident why Billy had clung so
tenaciously to his schooner of beer. Left-handed and hurriedly he
threw it; but even Flannagan must have been constrained to admit
that it was a good shot. It struck the detective directly in the
midst of his features, gave him a nasty cut on the cheek as it
broke and filled his eyes full of beer&mdash;and beer never was
intended as an eye wash.</p>

<p>Spluttering and cursing, Flannagan came to a sudden stop, and
when he had wiped the beer from his eyes he found that Billy Byrne
had passed through the doorway and closed the door after him.</p>

<p>The room in which Billy and Bridge found themselves was a small
one in the center of which was a large round table at which were
gathered a half-dozen men at poker. Above the table swung a single
arc lamp, casting a garish light upon the players beneath.</p>

<p>Billy looked quickly about for another exit, only to find that
besides the doorway through which he had entered there was but a
single aperture in the four walls&mdash;a small window, heavily
barred. The place was a veritable trap.</p>

<p>At their hurried entrance the men had ceased their play, and one
or two had risen in profane questioning and protest. Billy ignored
them. He was standing with his shoulder against the door trying to
secure it against the detective without; but there was neither bolt
nor bar.</p>

<p>Flannagan hurtling against the opposite side exerted his noblest
efforts to force an entrance to the room; but Billy Byrne's great
weight held firm as Gibraltar. His mind revolved various wild plans
of escape; but none bade fair to offer the slightest foothold to
hope.</p>

<p>The men at the table were clamoring for an explanation of the
interruption. Two of them were approaching Billy with the avowed
intention of "turning him out," when he turned his head suddenly
toward them.</p>

<p>"Can de beef, you poor boobs," he cried. "Dere's a bunch o'
dicks out dere&mdash;de joint's been pinched."</p>

<p>Instantly pandemonium ensued. Cards, chips, and money were swept
as by magic from the board. A dozen dog-eared and filthy magazines
and newspapers were snatched from a hiding place beneath the table,
and in the fraction of a second the room was transformed from a
gambling place to an innocent reading-room.</p>

<p>Billy grinned broadly. Flannagan had ceased his efforts to break
down the door, and was endeavoring to persuade Billy that he might
as well come out quietly and submit to arrest. Byrne had drawn his
revolver again. Now he motioned to Bridge to come to his side.</p>

<p>"Follow me," he whispered. "Don't move 'til I move&mdash;then
move sudden." Then, turning to the door again, "You big stiff," he
cried, "you couldn't take a crip to a hospital, let alone takin'
Billy Byrne to the still. Beat it, before I come out an' spread
your beezer acrost your map."</p>

<p>If Billy had desired to arouse the ire of Detective Sergeant
Flannagan by this little speech he succeeded quite as well as he
could have hoped. Flannagan commenced to growl and threaten, and
presently again hurled himself against the door.</p>

<p>Instantly Byrne wheeled and fired a single shot into the arc
lamp, the shattered carbon rattled to the table with fragments of
the globe, and Byrne stepped quickly to one side. The door flew
open and Sergeant Flannagan dove headlong into the darkened room. A
foot shot out from behind the opened door, and Flannagan, striking
it, sprawled upon his face amidst the legs of the literary lights
who held dog-eared magazines rightside up or upside down, as they
chanced to have picked them up.</p>

<p>Simultaneously Billy Byrne and Bridge dodged through the open
doorway, banged the door to behind them, and sped across the
barroom toward the street.</p>

<p>As Flannagan shot into their midst the men at the table leaped
to their feet and bolted for the doorway; but the detective was up
and after them so quickly that only two succeeded in getting out of
the room. One of these generously slammed the door in the faces of
his fellows, and there they pulled and hauled at each other until
Flannagan was among them.</p>

<p>In the pitch darkness he could recognize no one; but to be on
the safe side he hit out promiscuously until he had driven them all
from the door, then he stood with his back toward it&mdash;the
inmates of the room his prisoners.</p>

<p>Thus he remained for a moment threatening to shoot at the first
sound of movement in the room, and then he opened the door again,
and stepping just outside ordered the prisoners to file out one at
a time.</p>

<p>As each man passed him Flannagan scrutinized his face, and it
was not until they had all emerged and he had reentered the room
with a light that he discovered that once again his quarry had
eluded him. Detective Sergeant Flannagan was peeved.</p>

<p><br>
THE sun smote down upon a dusty road. A heat-haze lay upon the
arid land that stretched away upon either hand toward gray-brown
hills. A little adobe hut, backed by a few squalid outbuildings,
stood out, a screaming high-light in its coat of whitewash, against
a background that was garish with light.</p>

<p>Two men plodded along the road. Their coats were off, the brims
of their tattered hats were pulled down over eyes closed to mere
slits against sun and dust</p>

<p>One of the men, glancing up at the distant hut, broke into
verse:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"Yet then the sun was shining down, a-blazing on the little town,<br>
A mile or so 'way down the track a-dancing in the sun.<br>
But somehow, as I waited there, there came a shiver in the air,<br>
'The birds are flying south,' he said. 'The winter has begun.'"</p>
<br>

<p>His companion looked up at him who quoted.</p>

<p>"There ain't no track," he said, "an' that 'dobe shack don't
look much like a town; but otherwise his Knibbs has got our number
all right, all right. We are the birds a-flyin' south, and
Flannagan was the shiver in the air. Flannagan is a reg'lar frost.
Gee! but I betcha dat guy's sore."</p>

<p>"Why is it, Billy," asked Bridge, after a moment's silence,
"that upon occasion you speak king's English after the manner of
the boulevard, and again after that of the back alley? Sometimes
you say 'that' and 'dat' in the same sentence. Your conversational
clashes are numerous. Surely something or someone has cramped your
original style."</p>

<p>"I was born and brought up on 'dat,'" explained Billy.
"<i>She</i> taught me the other line of talk. Sometimes I forget. I
had about twenty years of the other and only one of hers, and
twenty to one is a long shot&mdash;more apt to lose than win."</p>

<p>"'She,' I take it, is <i>Penelope</i>," mused Bridge, half to
himself. "She must have been a fine girl."</p>

<p>"'Fine' isn't the right word," Billy corrected him. "If a
thing's fine there may be something finer, and then something else
finest. She was better than finest. She&mdash;she was&mdash;why,
Bridge, I'd have to be a walking dictionary to tell you what she
was."</p>

<p>Bridge made no reply, and the two trudged on toward the
whitewashed hut in silence for several minutes. Then Bridge broke
it:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"And you, my sweet Penelope, out there somewhere you wait for me<br>
With buds of roses in your hair and kisses on your mouth."</p>
<br>

<p>Billy sighed and shook his head.</p>

<p>"There ain't no such luck for me," he said. "She's married to
another gink now."</p>

<p>They came at last to the hut, upon the shady side of which they
found a Mexican squatting puffing upon a cigarette, while upon the
doorstep sat a woman, evidently his wife, busily engaged in the
preparation of some manner of foodstuff contained in a large,
shallow vessel. About them played a couple of half-naked children.
A baby sprawled upon a blanket just within the doorway.</p>

<p>The man looked up, suspiciously, as the two approached. Bridge
saluted him in fairly understandable Spanish, asking for food, and
telling the man that they had money with which to pay for a
little&mdash;not much, just a little.</p>

<p>The Mexican slowly unfolded himself and arose, motioning the
strangers to follow him into the interior of the hut. The woman, at
a word from her lord and master, followed them, and at his further
dictation brought them frijoles and tortillas.</p>

<p>The price he asked was nominal; but his eyes never left Bridge's
hands as the latter brought forth the money and handed it over. He
appeared just a trifle disappointed when no more money than the
stipulated purchase price was revealed to sight.</p>

<p>"Where you going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We're looking for work," explained Bridge. "We want to get jobs
on one of the American ranches or mines."</p>

<p>"You better go back," warned the Mexican. "I, myself, have
nothing against the Americans, señor; but there are many of my
countrymen who do not like you. The Americans are all leaving. Some
already have been killed by bandits. It is not safe to go farther.
Pesita's men are all about here. Even Mexicans are not safe from
him. No one knows whether he is for Villa or Carranza. If he finds
a Villa ranchero, then Pesita cries Viva Carranza! and his men kill
and rob. If, on the other hand, a neighbor of the last victim hears
of it in time, and later Pesita comes to him, he assures Pesita
that he is for Carranza, whereupon Pesita cries Viva Villa! and
falls upon the poor unfortunate, who is lucky if he escapes with
his life. But Americans! Ah, Pesita asks them no questions. He
hates them all, and kills them all, whenever he can lay his hands
upon them. He has sworn to rid Mexico of the gringos."</p>

<p>"Wot's the Dago talkin' about?" asked Billy.</p>

<p>Bridge gave his companion a brief synopsis of the Mexican's
conversation.</p>

<p>"Only the gentleman is not an Italian, Billy," he concluded.
"He's a Mexican."</p>

<p>"Who said he was an Eyetalian?" demanded Byrne.</p>

<p>As the two Americans and the Mexican conversed within the hut
there approached across the dusty flat, from the direction of the
nearer hills, a party of five horsemen.</p>

<p>They rode rapidly, coming toward the hut from the side which had
neither door nor window, so that those within had no warning of
their coming. They were swarthy, ragged ruffians, fully armed, and
with an equipment which suggested that they might be a part of a
quasi-military organization.</p>

<p>Close behind the hut four of them dismounted while the fifth,
remaining in his saddle, held the bridle reins of the horses of his
companions. The latter crept stealthily around the outside of the
building, toward the door&mdash;their carbines ready in their
hands.</p>

<p>It was one of the little children who first discovered the
presence of the newcomers. With a piercing scream she bolted into
the interior and ran to cling to her mother's skirts.</p>

<p>Billy, Bridge, and the Mexican wheeled toward the doorway
simultaneously to learn the cause of the girl's fright, and as they
did so found themselves covered by four carbines in the hands of as
many men.</p>

<p>As his eyes fell upon the faces of the intruders the countenance
of the Mexican fell, while his wife dropped to the floor and
embraced his knees, weeping.</p>

<p>"Wotinell?" ejaculated Billy Byrne. "What's doin'?"</p>

<p>"We seem to have been made prisoners," suggested Bridge; "but
whether by Villistas or Carranzistas I do not know."</p>

<p>Their host understood his words and turned toward the two
Americans.</p>

<p>"These are Pesita's men," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," spoke up one of the bandits, "we are Pesita's men, and
Pesita will be delighted, Miguel, to greet you, especially when he
sees the sort of company you have been keeping. You know how much
Pesita loves the gringos!"</p>

<p>"But this man does not even know us," spoke up Bridge. "We
stopped here to get a meal. He never saw us before. We are on our
way to the El Orobo Rancho in search of work. We have no money and
have broken no laws. Let us go our way in peace. You can gain
nothing by detaining us, and as for Miguel here&mdash;that is what
you called him, I believe&mdash;I think from what he said to us
that he loves a gringo about as much as your revered chief seems
to."</p>

<p>Miguel looked his appreciation of Bridge's defense of him; but
it was evident that he did not expect it to bear fruit. Nor did it.
The brigand spokesman only grinned sardonically.</p>

<p>"You may tell all this to Pesita himself, señor," he said. "Now
come&mdash;get a move on&mdash;beat it!" The fellow had once worked
in El Paso and took great pride in his "higher English"
education.</p>

<p>As he started to herd them from the hut Billy demurred. He
turned toward Bridge.</p>

<p>"Most of this talk gets by me," he said. "I ain't jerry to all
the Dago jabber yet, though I've copped off a little of it in the
past two weeks. Put me wise to the gink's lay."</p>

<p>"Elementary, Watson, elementary," replied Bridge. "We are
captured by bandits, and they are going to take us to their
delightful chief who will doubtless have us shot at sunrise."</p>

<p>"Bandits?" snapped Billy, with a sneer. "Youse don't call dese
little runts bandits?"</p>

<p>"Baby bandits, Billy, baby bandits," replied Bridge.</p>

<p>"An' you're goin' to stan' fer lettin' 'em pull off this rough
stuff without handin' 'em a come-back?" demanded Byrne.</p>

<p>"We seem to be up against just that very thing," said Bridge.
"There are four carbines quite ready for us. It would mean sudden
death to resist now. Later we may find an opportunity&mdash;I think
we'd better act simple and wait." He spoke in a quick, low whisper,
for the spokesman of the brigands evidently understood a little
English and was on the alert for any trickery.</p>

<p>Billy shrugged, and when their captors again urged them forward
he went quietly; but the expression on his face might have
perturbed the Mexicans had they known Billy Byrne of Grand Avenue
better&mdash;he was smiling happily.</p>

<p>Miguel had two ponies in his corral. These the brigands
appropriated, placing Billy upon one and Miguel and Bridge upon the
other. Billy's great weight rendered it inadvisable to double him
up with another rider.</p>

<p>As they were mounting Billy leaned toward Bridge and
whispered:</p>

<p>"I'll get these guys, pal&mdash;watch me," he said.</p>

<p>"I am with thee, William!&mdash;horse, foot, and artillery,"
laughed Bridge.</p>

<p>"Which reminds me," said Billy, "that I have an
ace-in-the-hole&mdash;the boobs never frisked me."</p>

<p>"And I am reminded," returned Bridge, as the horses started off
to the yank of hackamore ropes in the hands of the brigands who
were leading them, "of a touching little thing of Service's:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Just think! Some night the stars will gleam<br>
Upon a cold gray stone,<br>
And trace a name with silver beam,<br>
And lo! 'twill be your own."</p>
<br>

<p>"You're a cheerful guy," was Billy's only comment.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapb7" id="chapb7">VII. &mdash; IN PESITA'S CAMP</a></h2>

<p class="first">Pesita was a short, stocky man with a large, dark
mustache. He attired himself after his own ideas of what should
constitute the uniform of a general&mdash;ideas more or less
influenced and modified by the chance and caprice of fortune.</p>

<p>At the moment that Billy, Bridge, and Miguel were dragged into
his presence his torso was enwrapped in a once resplendent coat
covered with yards of gold braid. Upon his shoulders were brass
epaulets such as are connected only in one's mind with the ancient
chorus ladies of the light operas of fifteen or twenty years ago.
Upon his legs were some rusty and ragged overalls. His feet were
bare.</p>

<p>He scowled ferociously at the prisoners while his lieutenant
narrated the thrilling facts of their capture&mdash;thrilling by
embellishment.</p>

<p>"You are Americanos?" he asked of Bridge and Billy.</p>

<p>Both agreed that they were. Then Pesita turned toward
Miguel.</p>

<p>"Where is Villa?" he asked.</p>

<p>"How should I know, my general?" parried Miguel. "Who am
I&mdash;a poor man with a tiny rancho&mdash;to know of the
movements of the great ones of the earth? I did not even know where
was the great General Pesita until now I am brought into his
gracious presence, to throw myself at his feet and implore that I
be permitted to serve him in even the meanest of capacities."</p>

<p>Pesita appeared not to hear what Miguel had said. He turned his
shoulder toward the man, and addressed Billy in broken English.</p>

<p>"You were on your way to El Orobo Rancho, eh? Are you acquainted
there?" he asked.</p>

<p>Billy replied that they were not&mdash;merely looking for
employment upon an American-owned ranch or in an American mine.</p>

<p>"Why did you leave your own country?" asked Pesita. "What do you
want here in Mexico?"</p>

<p>"Well, ol' top," replied Billy, "you see de birds was flyin'
south an' winter was in de air, an a fat-head dick from Chi was on
me trail&mdash;so I ducks."</p>

<p>"Ducks?" queried Pesita, mystified. "Ah, the ducks&mdash;they
fly south, I see."</p>

<p>"Naw, you poor simp&mdash;I blows," explained Billy.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," agreed Pesita, not wishing to admit any ignorance of
plain American even before a despised gringo. "But the large-faced
dick&mdash;what might that be? I have spend much time in the
States, but I do not know that"</p>

<p>"I said 'fat-head dick'&mdash;dat's a fly cop," Billy
elucidated.</p>

<p>"It is he then that is the bird." Pesita beamed at this evidence
of his own sagacity. "He fly."</p>

<p>"Flannagan ain't no bird&mdash;Flannagan's a dub."</p>

<p>Bridge came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"My erudite friend means," he explained, "that the police chased
him out of the United States of America."</p>

<p>Pesita raised his eyebrows. All was now clear to him.</p>

<p>"But why did he not say so?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He tried to," said Bridge. "He did his best."</p>

<p>"Quit yer kiddin'," admonished Billy.</p>

<p>A bright fight suddenly burst upon Pesita. He turned upon
Bridge.</p>

<p>"Your friend is not then an American?" he asked. "I guessed it.
That is why I could not understand him. He speaks the language of
the gringo less well even than I. From what country is he?"</p>

<p>Billy Byrne would have asserted with some show of asperity that
he was nothing if not American; but Bridge was quick to see a
possible loophole for escape for his friend in Pesita's belief that
Billy was no gringo, and warned the latter to silence by a quick
motion of his head.</p>

<p>"He's from 'Gran' Avenoo,'" he said. "It is not exactly in
Germany; but there are a great many Germans there. My friend is a
native, so he don't speak German or English either&mdash;they have
a language of their own in 'Gran' Avenoo'."</p>

<p>"I see," said Pesita&mdash;"a German colony. I like the
Germans&mdash;they furnish me with much ammunition and rifles. They
are my very good friends. Take Miguel and the gringo
away"&mdash;this to the soldiers who had brought the prisoners to
him&mdash;"I will speak further with this man from Granavenoo."</p>

<p>When the others had passed out of hearing Pesita addressed
Billy.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, señor," he said, "that you have been put to so much
inconvenience. My men could not know that you were not a gringo;
but I can make it all right. I will make it all right. You are a
big man. The gringos have chased you from their country as they
chased me. I hate them. You hate them. But enough of them. You have
no business in Mexico except to seek work. I give you work. You are
big. You are strong. You are like a bull. You stay with me, señor,
and I make you captain. I need men what can talk some English and
look like gringo. You do fine. We make much money&mdash;you and I.
We make it all time while we fight to liberate my poor Mexico. When
Mexico liberate we fight some more to liberate her again. The
Germans they give me much money to liberate Mexico, and&mdash;there
are other ways of getting much money when one is riding around
through rich country with soldiers liberating his poor, bleeding
country. <i>Sabe</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yep, I guess I savvy," said Billy, "an' it listens all right to
me's far's you've gone. My pal in on it?"</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"You make my frien' a captain, too?"</p>

<p>Pesita held up his hands and rolled his eyes in holy horror.
Take a gringo into his band? It was unthinkable.</p>

<p>"He shot," he cried. "I swear to kill all gringo. I become
savior of my country. I rid her of all Americanos."</p>

<p>"Nix on the captain stuff fer me, then," said Billy, firmly.
"That guy's a right one. If any big stiff thinks he can croak
little ol' Bridge while Billy Byrne's aroun' he's got anudder t'ink
comin'. Why, me an' him's just like brudders."</p>

<p>"You like this gringo?" asked Pesita.</p>

<p>"You bet," cried Billy.</p>

<p>Pesita thought for several minutes. In his mind was a scheme
which required the help of just such an individual as this
stranger&mdash;someone who was utterly unknown in the surrounding
country and whose presence in a town could not by any stretch of
the imagination be connected in any way with the bandit,
Pesita.</p>

<p>"I tell you," he said. "I let your friend go. I send him under
safe escort to El Orobo Rancho. Maybe he help us there after a
while. If you stay I let him go. Otherwise I shoot you both with
Miguel."</p>

<p>"Wot you got it in for Mig fer?" asked Billy. "He's a harmless
sort o' guy."</p>

<p>"He Villista. Villista with gringos run Mexico&mdash;gringos and
the church. Just like Huerta would have done it if they'd given him
a chance, only Huerta more for church than for gringos."</p>

<p>"Aw, let the poor boob go," urged Billy, "an' I'll come along
wit you. Why he's got a wife an' kids&mdash;you wouldn't want to
leave them without no one to look after them in this God-forsaken
country!"</p>

<p>Pesita grinned indulgently.</p>

<p>"Very well, Señor Captain," he said, bowing low. "I let Miguel
and your honorable friend go. I send safe escort with them."</p>

<p>"Bully fer you, ol' pot!" exclaimed Billy, and Pesita smiled
delightedly in the belief that some complimentary title had been
applied to him in the language of "Granavenoo." "I'll go an' tell
'em," said Billy.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Pesita, "and say to them that they will start early
in the morning."</p>

<p>As Billy turned and walked in the direction that the soldiers
had led Bridge and Miguel, Pesita beckoned to a soldier who leaned
upon his gun at a short distance from his "general"&mdash;a
barefooted, slovenly attempt at a headquarters orderly.</p>

<p>"Send Captain Rozales to me," directed Pesita.</p>

<p>The soldier shuffled away to where a little circle of men in
wide-brimmed, metal-encrusted hats squatted in the shade of a tree,
chatting, laughing, and rolling cigarettes. He saluted one of these
and delivered his message, whereupon the tall, gaunt Captain
Rozales arose and came over to Pesita.</p>

<p>"The big one who was brought in today is not a gringo," said
Pesita, by way of opening the conversation. "He is from
Granavenoo. He can be of great service to us, for he is very
friendly with the Germans&mdash;yet he looks like a gringo and
could pass for one. We can utilize him. Also he is very large and
appears to be equally strong. He should make a good fighter and
we have none too many. I have made him a captain."</p>

<p>Rozales grinned. Already among Pesita's following of a hundred
men there were fifteen captains.</p>

<p>"Where is Granavenoo?" asked Rozales.</p>

<p>"You mean to say, my dear captain," exclaimed Pesita, "that a
man of your education does not know where Granavenoo is? I am
surprised. Why, it is a German colony."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. I recall it well now. For the moment it had
slipped my mind. My grandfather who was a great traveler was there
many times. I have heard him speak of it often."</p>

<p>"But I did not summon you that we might discuss European
geography," interrupted Pesita. "I sent for you to tell you that
the stranger would not consent to serve me unless I liberated his
friend, the gringo, and that sneaking spy of a Miguel. I was forced
to yield, for we can use the stranger. So I have promised, my dear
captain, that I shall send them upon their road with a safe escort
in the morning, and you shall command the guard. Upon your life
respect my promise, Rozales; but if some of Villa's cutthroats
should fall upon you, and in the battle, while you were trying to
defend the gringo and Miguel, both should be slain by the bullets
of the Villistas&mdash;ah, but it would be deplorable, Rozales, but
it would not be your fault. Who, indeed, could blame you who had
fought well and risked your men and yourself in the performance of
your sacred duty? Rozales, should such a thing occur what could I
do in token of my great pleasure other than make you a
colonel?"</p>

<p>"I shall defend them with my life, my general," cried Rozales,
bowing low.</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Pesita. "That is all."</p>

<p>Rozales started back toward the ring of smokers.</p>

<p>"Ah, Captain!" cried Pesita. "Another thing. Will you make it
known to the other officers that the stranger from Granavenoo is a
captain and that it is my wish that he be well treated, but not
told so much as might injure him, or his usefulness, about our
sacred work of liberating poor, bleeding unhappy Mexico."</p>

<p>Again Rozales bowed and departed. This time he was not
recalled.</p>

<p><br>
BILLY found Bridge and Miguel squatting on the ground with two
dirty-faced peons standing guard over them. The latter were some
little distance away. They made no objection when Billy approached
the prisoners though they had looked in mild surprise when they saw
him crossing toward them without a guard.</p>

<p>Billy sat down beside Bridge, and broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>"What's the joke?" asked Bridge. "Are we going to be hanged
instead of being shot?"</p>

<p>"We ain't goin' to be either," said Billy, "an' I'm a captain.
Whaddaya know about that?"</p>

<p>He explained all that had taken place between himself and Pesita
while Bridge and Miguel listened attentively to his every word.</p>

<p>"I t'ought it was about de only way out fer us," said Billy. "We
were in worse than I t'ought."</p>

<p>"Can the Bowery stuff, Billy," cried Bridge, "and talk like a
white man. You can, you know."</p>

<p>"All right, bo," cried Billy, good-naturedly. "You see I forget
when there is anything pressing like this, to chew about. Then I
fall back into the old lingo. Well, as I was saying, I didn't want
to do it unless you would stay too, but he wouldn't have you. He
has it in for all gringos, and that bull you passed him about me
being from a foreign country called Grand Avenue! He fell for it
like a rube for the tapped-wire stuff. He said if I wouldn't stay
and help him he'd croak the bunch of us."</p>

<p>"How about that ace-in-the-hole, you were telling me about?"
asked Bridge.</p>

<p>"I still got it," and Billy fondled something hard that swung
under his left arm beneath his shirt; "but, Lord, man! what could I
do against the whole bunch? I might get a few of them; but they'd
get us all in the end. This other way is better, though I hate to
have to split with you, old man."</p>

<p>He was silent then for a moment, looking hard at the ground.
Bridge whistled, and cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"I've always wanted to spend a year in Rio," he said. "We'll
meet there, when you can make your get-away."</p>

<p>"You've said it," agreed Byrne. "It's Rio as soon as we can make
it. Pesita's promised to set you both loose in the morning and send
you under safe escort&mdash;Miguel to his happy home, and you to El
Orobo Rancho. I guess the old stiff isn't so bad after all."</p>

<p>Miguel had pricked up his ears at the sound of the word
<i>escort</i>. He leaned far forward, closer to the two Americans,
and whispered.</p>

<p>"Who is to command the escort?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I dunno," said Billy. "What difference does it make?"</p>

<p>"It makes all the difference between life and death for your
friend and for me," said Miguel. "There is no reason why I should
need an escort. I know my way throughout all Chihuahua as well as
Pesita or any of his cutthroats. I have come and gone all my life
without an escort. Of course your friend is different. It might be
well for him to have company to El Orobo. Maybe it is all right;
but wait until we learn who commands the escort. I know Pesita
well. I know his methods. If Rozales rides out with us tomorrow
morning you may say good-bye to your friend forever, for you will
never see him in Rio, or elsewhere. He and I will be dead before
ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that, bo?" demanded Billy.</p>

<p>"I do not think, señor," replied Miguel; "I know."</p>

<p>"Well," said Billy, "we'll wait and see."</p>

<p>"If it is Rozales, say nothing," said Miguel. "It will do no
good; but we may then be on the watch, and if possible you might
find the means to obtain a couple of revolvers for us. In which
case&mdash;" he shrugged and permitted a faint smile to flex his
lips.</p>

<p>As they talked a soldier came and announced that they were no
longer prisoners&mdash;they were to have the freedom of the camp;
"but," he concluded, "the general requests that you do not pass
beyond the limits of the camp. There are many desperadoes in the
hills and he fears for your safety, now that you are his
guests."</p>

<p>The man spoke Spanish, so that it was necessary that Bridge
interpret his words for the benefit of Billy, who had understood
only part of what he said.</p>

<p>"Ask him," said Byrne, "if that stuff goes for me, too."</p>

<p>"He says no," replied Bridge after questioning the soldier,
"that the captain is now one of them, and may go and come as do the
other officers. Such are Pesita's orders."</p>

<p>Billy arose. The messenger had returned to his post at
headquarters. The guard had withdrawn, leaving the three men
alone.</p>

<p>"So long, old man," said Billy. "If I'm goin' to be of any help
to you and Mig the less I'm seen with you the better. I'll blow
over and mix with the Dago bunch, an' practice sittin' on my heels.
It seems to be the right dope down here, an' I got to learn all I
can about bein' a greaser seein' that I've turned one."</p>

<p>"Good-bye Billy, remember Rio," said Bridge.</p>

<p>"And the revolvers, señor," added Miguel.</p>

<p>"You bet," replied Billy, and strolled off in the direction of
the little circle of cigarette smokers.</p>

<p>As he approached them Rozales looked up and smiled. Then,
rising, extended his hand.</p>

<p>"Señor Captain," he said, "we welcome you. I am Captain
Rozales." He hesitated waiting for Billy to give his name.</p>

<p>"My monicker's Byrne," said Billy. "Pleased to meet you,
Cap."</p>

<p>"Ah, Captain Byrne," and Rozales proceeded to introduce the
newcomer to his fellow-officers.</p>

<p>Several, like Rozales, were educated men who had been officers
in the army under former regimes, but had turned bandit as the
safer alternative to suffering immediate death at the hands of the
faction then in power. The others, for the most part, were
pure-blooded Indians whose adult lives had been spent in outlawry
and brigandage. All were small of stature beside the giant, Byrne.
Rozales and two others spoke English. With those Billy conversed.
He tried to learn from them the name of the officer who was to
command the escort that was to accompany Bridge and Miguel into the
valley on the morrow; but Rozales and the others assured him that
they did not know.</p>

<p>When he had asked the question Billy had been looking straight
at Rozales, and he had seen the man's pupils contract and noticed
the slight backward movement of the body which also denotes
determination. Billy knew, therefore, that Rozales was lying. He
did know who was to command the escort, and there was something
sinister in that knowledge or the fellow would not have denied
it.</p>

<p>The American began to consider plans for saving his friend from
the fate which Pesita had outlined for him. Rozales, too, was
thinking rapidly. He was no fool. Why had the stranger desired to
know who was to command the escort? He knew none of the officers
personally. What difference then, did it make to him who rode out
on the morrow with his friend? Ah, but Miguel knew that it would
make a difference. Miguel had spoken to the new captain, and
aroused his suspicions.</p>

<p>Rozales excused himself and rose. A moment later he was in
conversation with Pesita, unburdening himself of his suspicions,
and outlining a plan.</p>

<p>"Do not send me in charge of the escort," he advised. "Send
Captain Byrne himself."</p>

<p>Pesita pooh-poohed the idea.</p>

<p>"But wait," urged Rozales. "Let the stranger ride in command,
with a half-dozen picked men who will see that nothing goes wrong.
An hour before dawn I will send two men&mdash;they will be our best
shots&mdash;on ahead. They will stop at a place we both know, and
about noon the Captain Byrne and his escort will ride back to camp
and tell us that they were attacked by a troop of Villa's men, and
that both our guests were killed. It will be sad; but it will not
be our fault. We will swear vengeance upon Villa, and the Captain
Byrne will hate him as a good Pesitista should."</p>

<p>"You have the cunning of the Coyote, my captain," cried Pesita.
"It shall be done as you suggest. Go now, and I will send for
Captain Byrne, and give him his orders for the morning."</p>

<p>As Rozales strolled away a figure rose from the shadows at the
side of Pesita's tent and slunk off into the darkness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapb8" id="chapb8">VIII. &mdash; BILLY'S FIRST
COMMAND</a></h2>

<p class="first">And so it was that having breakfasted in the
morning Bridge and Miguel started downward toward the valley
protected by an escort under Captain Billy Byrne. An old service
jacket and a wide-brimmed hat, both donated by brother officers,
constituted Captain Byrne's uniform. His mount was the largest that
the picket line of Pesita's forces could produce. Billy loomed
large amongst his men.</p>

<p>For an hour they rode along the trail, Billy and Bridge
conversing upon various subjects, none of which touched upon the
one uppermost in the mind of each. Miguel rode, silent and
preoccupied. The evening before he had whispered something to
Bridge as he had crawled out of the darkness to lie close to the
American, and during a brief moment that morning Bridge had found
an opportunity to relay the Mexican's message to Billy Byrne.</p>

<p>The latter had but raised his eyebrows a trifle at the time, but
later he smiled more than was usual with him. Something seemed to
please him immensely.</p>

<p>Beside him at the head of the column rode Bridge and Miguel.
Behind them trailed the six swarthy little troopers&mdash;the
picked men upon whom Pesita could depend.</p>

<p>They had reached a point where the trail passes through a narrow
dry arroyo which the waters of the rainy season had cut deep into
the soft, powdery soil. Upon either bank grew cacti and mesquite,
forming a sheltering screen behind which a regiment might have
hidden. The place was ideal for an ambuscade.</p>

<p>"Here, Señor Capitan," whispered Miguel, as they neared the
entrance to the trap.</p>

<p>A low hill shut off from their view all but the head of the cut,
and it also hid them from the sight of any possible enemy which
might have been lurking in wait for them farther down the
arroyo.</p>

<p>At Miguel's words Byrne wheeled his horse to the right away from
the trail which led through the bottom of the waterway and around
the base of the hill, or rather in that direction, for he had
scarce deviated from the direct way before one of the troopers
spurred to his side, calling out in Spanish that he was upon the
wrong trail.</p>

<p>"Wot's this guy chewin' about?" asked Billy, turning to
Miguel.</p>

<p>"He says you must keep to the arroyo, Señor Capitan," explained
the Mexican.</p>

<p>"Tell him to go back into his stall," was Byrne's laconic
rejoinder, as he pushed his mount forward to pass the brigand.</p>

<p>The soldier was voluble in his objections. Again he reined in
front of Billy, and by this time his five fellows had spurred
forward to block the way.</p>

<p>"This is the wrong trail," they cried. "Come this other way,
Capitan. Pesita has so ordered it."</p>

<p>Catching the drift of their remarks, Billy waved them to one
side.</p>

<p>"I'm bossin' this picnic," he announced. "Get out o' the way,
an' be quick about it if you don't want to be hurted."</p>

<p>Again he rode forward. Again the troopers interposed their
mounts, and this time their leader cocked his carbine. His attitude
was menacing. Billy was close to him. Their ponies were shoulder to
shoulder, that of the bandit almost broadside of the trail.</p>

<p>Now Billy Byrne was more than passing well acquainted with many
of the fundamental principles of sudden brawls. It is safe to say
that he had never heard of Van Bibber; but he knew, as well as Van
Bibber knew, that it is well to hit first.</p>

<p>Without a word and without warning he struck, leaning forward
with all the weight of his body behind his blow, and catching the
man full beneath the chin he lifted him as neatly from his saddle
as though a battering ram had struck him.</p>

<p>Simultaneously Bridge and Miguel drew revolvers from their
shirts and as Billy wheeled his pony toward the remaining five they
opened fire upon them.</p>

<p>The battle was short and sweet. One almost escaped but Miguel,
who proved to be an excellent revolver shot, brought him down at a
hundred yards. He then, with utter disregard for the rules of
civilized warfare, dispatched those who were not already dead.</p>

<p>"We must let none return to carry false tales to Pesita," he
explained.</p>

<p>Even Billy Byrne winced at the ruthlessness of the cold-blooded
murders; but he realized the necessity which confronted them though
he could not have brought himself to do the things which the
Mexican did with such <i>sang-froid</i> and even evident
enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Now for the others!" cried Miguel, when he had assured himself
that each of the six were really quite dead.</p>

<p>Spurring after him Billy and Bridge ran their horses over the
rough ground at the base of the little hill, and then parallel to
the arroyo for a matter of a hundred yards, where they espied two
Indians, carbines in hand, standing in evident consternation
because of the unexpected fusillade of shots which they had just
heard and which they were unable to account for.</p>

<p>At the sight of the three the sharpshooters dropped behind cover
and fired. Billy's horse stumbled at the first report, caught
himself, reared high upon his hind legs and then toppled over,
dead.</p>

<p>His rider, throwing himself to one side, scrambled to his feet
and fired twice at the partially concealed men. Miguel and Bridge
rode in rapidly to close quarters, firing as they came. One of the
two men Pesita had sent to assassinate his "guests" dropped his
gun, clutched at his breast, screamed, and sank back behind a clump
of mesquite. The other turned and leaped over the edge of the bank
into the arroyo, rolling and tumbling to the bottom in a cloud of
dry dust.</p>
<a id="pic3" name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

<p class="caption">The Mexican leaped into the arroyo, running<br>
for his life like a frightened jackrabbit.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>As he rose to his feet and started on a run up the bed of the
dry stream, dodging a zigzag course from one bit of scant cover to
another Billy Byrne stepped to the edge of the washout and threw
his carbine to his shoulder. His face was flushed, his eyes
sparkled, a smile lighted his regular features.</p>

<p>"This is the life!" he cried, and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The man beneath him, running for his life like a frightened
jackrabbit, sprawled forward upon his face, made a single effort to
rise and then slumped limply down, forever.</p>

<p>Miguel and Bridge, dismounted now, came to Byrne's side. The
Mexican was grinning broadly.</p>

<p>"The captain is one grand fighter," he said. "How my dear
general would admire such a man as the captain. Doubtless he would
make him a colonel. Come with me Señor Capitan and your fortune is
made."</p>

<p>"Come where?" asked Billy Byrne.</p>

<p>"To the camp of the liberator of poor, bleeding Mexico&mdash;to
General Francisco Villa."</p>

<p>"Nothin' doin'," said Billy. "I'm hooked up with this Pesita
person now, an' I guess I'll stick. He's given me more of a run for
my money in the last twenty-four hours than I've had since I parted
from my dear old friend, the Lord of Yoka."</p>

<p>"But Señor Capitan," cried Miguel, "you do not mean to say that
you are going back to Pesita! He will shoot you down with his own
hand when he has learned what has happened here."</p>

<p>"I guess not," said Billy.</p>

<p>"You'd better go with Miguel, Billy," urged Bridge. "Pesita will
not forgive you this. You've cost him eight men today and he hasn't
any more men than he needs at best. Besides you've made a monkey of
him and unless I miss my guess you'll have to pay for it."</p>

<p>"No," said Billy, "I kind o' like this Pesita gent. I think I'll
stick around with him for a while yet. Anyhow until I've had a
chance to see his face after I've made my report to him. You guys
run along now and make your get-away good, an' I'll beat it back to
camp."</p>

<p>He crossed to where the two horses of the slain marksmen were
hidden, turned one of them loose and mounted the other.</p>

<p>"So long, boes!" he cried, and with a wave of his hand wheeled
about and spurred back along the trail over which they had just
come.</p>

<p>Miguel and Bridge watched him for a moment, then they, too,
mounted and turned away in the opposite direction. Bridge recited
no verse for the balance of that day. His heart lay heavy in his
bosom, for he missed Billy Byrne, and was fearful of the fate which
awaited him at the camp of the bandit.</p>

<p><br>
BILLY, blithe as a lark, rode gaily back along the trail to
camp. He looked forward with unmixed delight to his coming
interview with Pesita, and to the wild, half-savage life which
association with the bandit promised. All his life had Billy Byrne
fed upon excitement and adventure. As gangster, thug, holdup man
and second-story artist Billy had found food for his appetite
within the dismal, sooty streets of Chicago's great West Side, and
then Fate had flung him upon the savage shore of Yoka to find other
forms of adventure where the best that is in a strong man may be
brought out in the stern battle for existence against primeval men
and conditions. The West Side had developed only Billy's basest
characteristics. He might have slipped back easily into the old
ways had it not been for <i>her</i> and the recollection of that
which he had read in her eyes. Love had been there; but greater
than that to hold a man into the straight and narrow path of
decency and honor had been respect and admiration. It had seemed
incredible to Billy that a goddess should feel such things for
him&mdash;for the same man her scornful lips once had branded as
coward and mucker; yet he had read the truth aright, and since then
Billy Byrne had done his best according to the fight that had been
given him to deserve the belief she had in him.</p>

<p>So far there had crept into his consciousness no disquieting
doubts as to the consistency of his recent action in joining the
force of a depredating Mexican outlaw. Billy knew nothing of the
political conditions of the republic. Had Pesita told him that he
was president of Mexico, Billy could not have disputed the
statement from any knowledge of facts which he possessed. As a
matter of fact about all Billy had ever known of Mexico was that it
had some connection with an important place called Juarez where
running meets were held.</p>

<p>To Billy Byrne, then, Pesita was a real general, and Billy,
himself, a bona fide captain. He had entered an army which was at
war with some other army. What they were warring about Billy knew
not, nor did he care. There should be fighting and he loved
that&mdash;that much he knew. The ethics of Pesita's warfare
troubled him not. He had heard that some great American general had
said: "War is hell." Billy was willing to take his word for it, and
accept anything which came in the guise of war as entirely proper
and as it should be.</p>

<p>The afternoon was far gone when Billy drew rein in the camp of
the outlaw band. Pesita with the bulk of his raiders was out upon
some excursion to the north. Only half a dozen men lolled about,
smoking or sleeping away the hot day. They looked at Billy in
evident surprise when they saw him riding in alone; but they asked
no questions and Billy offered no explanation&mdash;his report was
for the ears of Pesita only.</p>

<p>The balance of the day Billy spent in acquiring further
knowledge of Spanish by conversing with those of the men who
remained awake, and asking innumerable questions. It was almost
sundown when Pesita rode in. Two riderless horses were led by
troopers in the rear of the little column and three men swayed
painfully in their saddles and their clothing was stained with
blood.</p>

<p>Evidently Pesita had met with resistance. There was much voluble
chattering on the part of those who had remained behind in their
endeavors to extract from their returning comrades the details of
the day's enterprise. By piecing together the various scraps of
conversation he could understand Billy discovered that Pesita had
ridden far to demand tribute from a wealthy ranchero, only to find
that word of his coming had preceded him and brought a large
detachment of Villa's regulars who concealed themselves about the
house and outbuildings until Pesita and his entire force were well
within close range.</p>

<p>"We were lucky to get off as well as we did," said an
officer.</p>

<p>Billy grinned inwardly as he thought of the pleasant frame of
mind in which Pesita might now be expected to receive the news that
eight of his troopers had been killed and his two "guests" safely
removed from the sphere of his hospitality.</p>

<p>And even as his mind dwelt delightedly upon the subject a ragged
Indian carrying a carbine and with heavy silver spurs strapped to
his bare feet approached and saluted him.</p>

<p>"General Pesita wishes Señor Capitan Byrne to report to him at
once," said the man.</p>

<p>"Sure Mike!" replied Billy, and made his way through the
pandemonium of the camp toward the headquarters tent.</p>

<p>As he went he slipped his hand inside his shirt and loosened
something which hung beneath his left arm.</p>

<p>"Li'l ol' ace-in-the-hole," he murmured affectionately.</p>

<p>He found Pesita pacing back and forth before his tent&mdash;an
energetic bundle of nerves which no amount of hard riding and
fighting could tire or discourage.</p>

<p>As Billy approached Pesita shot a quick glance at his face, that
he might read, perhaps, in his new officer's expression whether
anger or suspicion had been aroused by the killing of his American
friend, for Pesita never dreamed but that Bridge had been dead
since mid-forenoon.</p>

<p>"Well," said Pesita, smiling, "you left Señor Bridge and Miguel
safely at their destination?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't take 'em all the way," replied Billy, "cause I
didn't have no more men to guard 'em with; but I seen 'em past the
danger I guess an' well on their way."</p>

<p>"You had no men?" questioned Pesita. "You had six troopers."</p>

<p>"Oh, they was all croaked before we'd been gone two hours. You
see it happens like this: We got as far as that dry arroyo just
before the trail drops down into the valley, when up jumps a bunch
of this here Villa's guys and commenced takin' pot shots at us.</p>

<p>"Seein' as how I was sent to guard Bridge an' Mig, I makes them
dismount and hunt cover, and then me an' my men wades in and cleans
up the bunch. They was only a few of them but they croaked the
whole bloomin' six o' mine.</p>

<p>"I tell you it was some scrap while it lasted; but I saved your
guests from gettin' hurted an' I know that that's what you sent me
to do. It's too bad about the six men we lost but, leave it to me,
we'll get even with that Villa guy yet. Just lead me to 'im."</p>

<p>As he spoke Billy commenced scratching himself beneath the left
arm, and then, as though to better reach the point of irritation,
he slipped his hand inside his shirt. If Pesita noticed the
apparently innocent little act, or interpreted it correctly may or
may not have been the fact. He stood looking straight into Byrne's
eyes for a full minute. His face denoted neither baffled rage nor
contemplated revenge. Presently a slow smile raised his heavy
mustache and revealed his strong, white teeth.</p>

<p>"You have done well, Captain Byrne," he said. "You are a man
after my own heart," and he extended his hand.</p>

<p>A half-hour later Billy walked slowly back to his own blankets,
and to say that he was puzzled would scarce have described his
mental state.</p>

<p>"I can't quite make that gink out," he mused. "Either he's a
mighty good loser or else he's a deep one who'll wait a year to get
me the way he wants to get me."</p>

<p>And Pesita a few moments later was saying to Captain
Rozales:</p>

<p>"I should have shot him if I could spare such a man; but it is
seldom I find one with the courage and effrontery he possesses. Why
think of it, Rozales, he kills eight of my men, and lets my
prisoners escape, and then dares to come back and tell me about it
when he might easily have gotten away. Villa would have made him an
officer for this thing, and Miguel must have told him so. He found
out in some way about your little plan and he turned the tables on
us. We can use him, Rozales, but we must watch him. Also, my dear
captain, watch his right hand and when he slips it into his shirt
be careful that you do not draw on him&mdash;unless you happen to
be behind him."</p>

<p>Rozales was not inclined to take his chief's view of Byrne's
value to them. He argued that the man was guilty of disloyalty and
therefore a menace. What he thought, but did not advance as an
argument, was of a different nature. Rozales was filled with rage
to think that the newcomer had outwitted him, and beaten him at his
own game, and he was jealous, too, of the man's ascendancy in the
esteem of Pesita; but he hid his personal feelings beneath a cloak
of seeming acquiescence in his chief's views, knowing that some day
his time would come when he might rid himself of the danger of this
obnoxious rival.</p>

<p>"And tomorrow," continued Pesita, "I am sending him to Cuivaca.
Villa has considerable funds in bank there, and this stranger can
learn what I want to know about the size of the detachment holding
the town, and the habits of the garrison."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapb9" id="chapb9">IX. &mdash; BARBARA IN MEXICO</a></h2>

<p class="first">The manager of El Orobo Rancho was an American
named Grayson. He was a tall, wiry man whose education had been
acquired principally in the cow camps of Texas, where, among other
things one does <i>not</i> learn to love nor trust a greaser. As a
result of this early training Grayson was peculiarly unfitted in
some respects to manage an American ranch in Mexico; but he was a
just man, and so if his <i>vaqueros</i> did not love him, they at
least respected him, and everyone who was or possessed the latent
characteristics of a wrongdoer feared him.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not fair to say that Grayson was in any way
unfitted for the position he held, since as a matter of fact he was
an ideal ranch foreman, and, if the truth be known, the simple fact
that he was a gringo would have been sufficient to have won him the
hatred of the Mexicans who worked under him&mdash;not in the course
of their everyday relations; but when the fires of racial animosity
were fanned to flame by some untoward incident upon either side of
the border.</p>

<p>Today Grayson was particularly rabid. The more so because he
could not vent his anger upon the cause of it, who was no less a
person than his boss.</p>

<p>It seemed incredible to Grayson that any man of intelligence
could have conceived and then carried out the fool thing which the
boss had just done, which was to have come from the safety of New
York City to the hazards of warring Mexico, bringing&mdash;and this
was the worst feature of it&mdash;his daughter with him. And at
such a time! Scarce a day passed without its rumors or reports of
new affronts and even atrocities being perpetrated upon American
residents of Mexico. Each day, too, the gravity of these acts
increased. From mere insult they had run of late to assault and
even to murder. Nor was the end in sight.</p>

<p>Pesita had openly sworn to rid Mexico of the gringo&mdash;to
kill on sight every American who fell into his hands. And what
could Grayson do in case of a determined attack upon the rancho? It
is true he had a hundred men&mdash;laborers and <i>vaqueros</i>,
but scarce a dozen of these were Americans, and the rest would,
almost without exception, follow the inclinations of consanguinity
in case of trouble.</p>

<p>To add to Grayson's irritability he had just lost his
bookkeeper, and if there was one thing more than any other that
Grayson hated it was pen and ink. The youth had been a "lunger"
from Iowa, a fairly nice little chap, and entirely suited to his
duties under any other circumstances than those which prevailed in
Mexico at that time. He was in mortal terror of his life every
moment that he was awake, and at last had given in to the urge of
cowardice and resigned. The day previous he had been bundled into a
buckboard and driven over to the Mexican Central which, at that
time, still was operating trains&mdash;occasionally&mdash;between
Chihuahua and Juarez.</p>

<p>His mind filled with these unpleasant thoughts, Grayson sat at
his desk in the office of the ranch trying to unravel the riddle of
a balance sheet which would not balance. Mixed with the blue of the
smoke from his briar was the deeper azure of a spirited monologue
in which Grayson was engaged.</p>

<p>A girl was passing the building at the moment. At her side
walked a gray-haired man&mdash;one of those men whom you just
naturally fit into a mental picture of a director's meeting
somewhere along Wall Street.</p>

<p>"Sich langwidge!" cried the girl, with a laugh, covering her
ears with her palms.</p>

<p>The man at her side smiled.</p>

<p>"I can't say that I blame him much, Barbara," he replied. "It
was a very foolish thing for me to bring you down here at this
time. I can't understand what ever possessed me to do it."</p>

<p>"Don't blame yourself, dear," remonstrated the girl, "when it
was all my fault. I begged and begged and begged until you had to
consent, and I'm not sorry either&mdash;if nothing happens to you
because of our coming. I couldn't stay in New York another minute.
Everyone was so snoopy, and I could just tell that they were dying
to ask questions about Billy and me."</p>

<p>"I can't get it through my head yet, Barbara," said the man,
"why in the world you broke with Billy Mallory. He's one of the
finest young men in New York City today&mdash;just my ideal of the
sort of man I'd like my only daughter to marry."</p>

<p>"I tried, Papa," said the girl in a low voice; "but I
couldn't&mdash;I just couldn't."</p>

<p>"Was it because&mdash;" the man stopped abruptly. "Well, never
mind dear, I shan't be snoopy too. Here now, you run along and do
some snooping yourself about the ranch. I want to stop in and have
a talk with Grayson."</p>

<p>Down by one of the corrals where three men were busily engaged
in attempting to persuade an unbroken pony that a spade bit is a
pleasant thing to wear in one's mouth, Barbara found a seat upon a
wagon box which commanded an excellent view of the entertainment
going on within the corral. As she sat there experiencing a
combination of admiration for the agility and courage of the men
and pity for the horse the tones of a pleasant masculine voice
broke in upon her thoughts.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"Out there somewhere! says I to me. 'By Gosh, I guess, that's poetry!"<br>
Out there somewhere&mdash;Penelope&mdash;With kisses on her mouth!<br>
And then, thinks I, O college guy! your talk it gets me in the eye,<br>
The north is creeping in the air, the birds are flying south."</p>
<br>

<p>Barbara swung around to view the poet. She saw a slender man
astride a fagged Mexican pony. A ragged coat and ragged trousers
covered the man's nakedness. Indian moccasins protected his feet,
while a torn and shapeless felt hat sat upon his well-shaped head.
<i>American</i> was written all over him. No one could have
imagined him anything else. Apparently he was a tramp as
well&mdash;his apparel proclaimed him that; but there were two
discordant notes in the otherwise harmonious ensemble of your
typical bo. He was clean shaven and he rode a pony. He rode erect,
too, with the easy seat of an army officer.</p>

<p>At sight of the girl he raised his battered hat and swept it low
to his pony's shoulder as he bent in a profound bow.</p>

<p>"I seek the majordomo, senorita," he said.</p>

<p>"Mr. Grayson is up at the office, that little building to the
left of the ranchhouse," replied the girl, pointing.</p>

<p>The newcomer had addressed her in Spanish, and as he heard her
reply, in pure and liquid English, his eyes widened a trifle; but
the familiar smile with which he had greeted her left his face, and
his parting bow was much more dignified though no less profound
than its predecessor.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"And you, my sweet Penelope, out there somewhere you wait for me,<br>
With buds of roses in your hair and kisses on your mouth."</p>

<p><br>
GRAYSON and his employer both looked up as the words of Knibbs'
poem floated in to them through the open window.</p>

<p>"I wonder where that blew in from," remarked Grayson, as his
eyes discovered Bridge astride the tired pony, looking at him
through the window. A polite smile touched the stranger's lips as
his eyes met Grayson's, and then wandered past him to the imposing
figure of the Easterner.</p>

<p>"Good evening, gentlemen," said Bridge.</p>

<p>"Evenin'," snapped Grayson. "Go over to the cookhouse and the
Chink'll give you something to eat. Turn your pony in the lower
pasture. Smith'll show you where to bunk tonight, an' you kin hev
your breakfast in the mornin'. S'long!" The ranch superintendent
turned back to the paper in his hand which he had been discussing
with his employer at the moment of the interruption. He had
volleyed his instructions at Bridge as though pouring a rain of
lead from a machine gun, and now that he had said what he had to
say the incident was closed in so far as he was concerned.</p>

<p>The hospitality of the Southwest permitted no stranger to be
turned away without food and a night's lodging. Grayson having
arranged for these felt that he had done all that might be expected
of a host, especially when the uninvited guest was so obviously a
hobo and doubtless a horse thief as well, for who ever knew a hobo
to own a horse?</p>

<p>Bridge continued to sit where he had reined in his pony. He was
looking at Grayson with what the discerning boss judged to be
politely concealed enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Possibly," suggested the boss in a whisper to his aide, "the
man has business with you. You did not ask him, and I am sure that
he said nothing about wishing a meal or a place to sleep."</p>

<p>"Huh?" grunted Grayson, and then to Bridge, "Well, what the
devil <i>do</i> you want?"</p>

<p>"A job," replied Bridge, "or, to be more explicit, I need a
job&mdash;far be it from me to <i>wish</i> one."</p>

<p>The Easterner smiled. Grayson looked a bit mystified&mdash;and
irritated.</p>

<p>"Well, I hain't got none," he snapped. "We don't need nobody now
unless it might be a good puncher&mdash;one who can rope and
ride."</p>

<p>"I can ride," replied Bridge, "as is evidenced by the fact that
you now see me astride a horse."</p>

<p>"I said <i>ride</i>," said Grayson. "Any fool can <i>sit</i> on
a horse. <i>No</i>, I hain't got nothin', an' I'm busy now. Hold
on!" he exclaimed as though seized by a sudden inspiration. He
looked sharply at Bridge for a moment and then shook his head
sadly. "No, I'm afraid you couldn't do it&mdash;a guy's got to be
eddicated for the job I got in mind."</p>

<p>"Washing dishes?" suggested Bridge.</p>

<p>Grayson ignored the playfulness of the other's question.</p>

<p>"Keepin' books," he explained. There was a finality in his tone
which said: "As you, of course, cannot keep books the interview is
now over. Get out!"</p>

<p>"I could try," said Bridge. "I can read and write, you know. Let
me try." Bridge wanted money for the trip to Rio, and, too, he
wanted to stay in the country until Billy was ready to leave.</p>

<p>"Savvy Spanish?" asked Grayson.</p>

<p>"I read and write it better than I speak it," said Bridge,
"though I do the latter well enough to get along anywhere that it
is spoken."</p>

<p>Grayson wanted a bookkeeper worse than he could ever recall
having wanted anything before in all his life. His better judgment
told him that it was the height of idiocy to employ a ragged bum as
a bookkeeper; but the bum was at least as much of a hope to him as
is a straw to a drowning man, and so Grayson clutched at him.</p>

<p>"Go an' turn your cayuse in an' then come back here," he
directed, "an' I'll give you a tryout."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Bridge, and rode off in the direction of the
pasture gate.</p>

<p>"'Fraid he won't never do," said Grayson, ruefully, after Bridge
had passed out of earshot.</p>

<p>"I rather imagine that he will," said the boss. "He is an
educated man, Grayson&mdash;you can tell that from his English,
which is excellent. He's probably one of the great army of
down-and-outers. The world is full of them&mdash;poor devils. Give
him a chance, Grayson, and anyway he adds another American to our
force, and each one counts."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right; but I hope you won't need 'em before you an'
Miss Barbara go," said Grayson.</p>

<p>"I hope not, Grayson; but one can never tell with conditions
here such as they are. Have you any hope that you will be able to
obtain a safe conduct for us from General Villa?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Villa'll give us the paper all right," said Grayson; "but
it won't do us no good unless we don't meet nobody but Villa's men
on the way out. This here Pesita's the critter I'm leery of. He's
got it in for all Americans, and especially for El Orobo Rancho.
You know we beat off a raid of his about six months
ago&mdash;killed half a dozen of his men, an' he won't never
forgive that. Villa can't spare a big enough force to give us safe
escort to the border and he can't assure the safety of the train
service. It looks mighty bad, sir&mdash;I don't see what in hell
you came for."</p>

<p>"Neither do I, Grayson," agreed the boss; "but I'm here and
we've got to make the best of it. All this may blow over&mdash;it
has before&mdash;and we'll laugh at our fears in a few weeks."</p>

<p>"This thing that's happenin' now won't never blow over 'til the
stars and stripes blow over Chihuahua," said Grayson with
finality.</p>

<p>A few moments later Bridge returned to the office, having
unsaddled his pony and turned it into the pasture.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" asked Grayson, preparing to enter it in his
time book.</p>

<p>"Bridge," replied the new bookkeeper.</p>

<p>"'Nitials," snapped Grayson.</p>

<p>Bridge hesitated. "Oh, put me down as L. Bridge," he said.</p>

<p>"Where from?" asked the ranch foreman.</p>

<p>"El Orobo Rancho," answered Bridge.</p>

<p>Grayson shot a quick glance at the man. The answer confirmed his
suspicions that the stranger was probably a horse thief, which, in
Grayson's estimation, was the worst thing a man could be.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that pony you come in on?" he demanded. "I
ain't sayin' nothin' of course, but I jest want to tell you that we
ain't got no use for horse thieves here."</p>

<p>The Easterner, who had been a listener, was shocked by the
brutality of Grayson's speech; but Bridge only laughed.</p>

<p>"If you must know," he said, "I never bought that horse, an' the
man he belonged to didn't give him to me. I just took him."</p>

<p>"You got your nerve," growled Grayson. "I guess you better git
out. We don't want no horse thieves here."</p>

<p>"Wait," interposed the boss. "This man doesn't act like a horse
thief. A horse thief, I should imagine, would scarcely admit his
guilt. Let's have his story before we judge him."</p>

<p>"All right," said Grayson; "but he's just admitted he stole the
horse."</p>

<p>Bridge turned to the boss. "Thanks," he said; "but really I did
steal the horse."</p>

<p>Grayson made a gesture which said: "See, I told you so."</p>

<p>"It was like this," went on Bridge. "The gentleman who owned the
horse, together with some of his friends, had been shooting at me
and my friends. When it was all over there was no one left to
inform us who were the legal heirs of the late owners of this and
several other horses which were left upon our hands, so I borrowed
this one. The law would say, doubtless, that I had stolen it; but I
am perfectly willing to return it to its rightful owners if someone
will find them for me."</p>

<p>"You been in a scrap?" asked Grayson. "Who with?"</p>

<p>"A party of Pesita's men," replied Bridge.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday."</p>

<p>"You see they are working pretty close," said Grayson, to his
employer, and then to Bridge: "Well, if you took that cayuse from
one of Pesita's bunch you can't call that stealin'. Your room's in
there, back of the office, an' you'll find some clothes there that
the last man forgot to take with him. You ken have 'em, an' from
the looks o' yourn you need 'em."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Bridge. "My clothes are a bit rusty. I
shall have to speak to James about them," and he passed through
into the little bedroom off the office, and closed the door behind
him.</p>

<p>"James?" grunted Grayson. "Who the devil does he mean by James?
I hain't seen but one of 'em."</p>

<p>The boss was laughing quietly.</p>

<p>"The man's a character," he said. "He'll be worth all you pay
him&mdash;if you can appreciate him, which I doubt, Grayson."</p>

<p>"I ken appreciate him if he ken keep books," replied Grayson.
"That's all I ask of him."</p>

<p>When Bridge emerged from the bedroom he was clothed in white
duck trousers, a soft shirt, and a pair of tennis shoes, and such a
change had they wrought in his appearance that neither Grayson nor
his employer would have known him had they not seen him come from
the room into which they had sent him to make the exchange of
clothing.</p>

<p>"Feel better?" asked the boss, smiling.</p>

<p>"Clothes are but an incident with me," replied Bridge. "I wear
them because it is easier to do so than it would be to dodge the
weather and the police. Whatever I may have upon my back affects in
no way what I have within my head. No, I cannot say that I feel any
better, since these clothes are not as comfortable as my old ones.
However if it pleases Mr. Grayson that I should wear a pink kimono
while working for him I shall gladly wear a pink kimono. What shall
I do first, sir?" The question was directed toward Grayson.</p>

<p>"Sit down here an' see what you ken make of this bunch of
trouble," replied the foreman. "I'll talk with you again this
evenin'."</p>

<p>As Grayson and his employer quitted the office and walked
together toward the corrals the latter's brow was corrugated by
thought and his facial expression that of one who labors to fasten
upon a baffling and illusive recollection.</p>

<p>"It beats all, Grayson," he said presently; "but I am sure that
I have known this new bookkeeper of yours before. The moment he
came out of that room dressed like a human being I knew that I had
known him; but for the life of me I can't place him. I should be
willing to wager considerable, however, that his name is not
Bridge."</p>

<p>"S'pect you're right," assented Grayson. "He's probably one o'
them eastern dude bank clerks what's gone wrong and come down here
to hide. Mighty fine place to hide jest now, too.</p>

<p>"And say, speakin' of banks," he went on, "what'll I do 'bout
sendin' over to Cuivaca fer the pay tomorrow. Next day's pay day. I
don't like to send this here bum, I can't trust a greaser no
better, an' I can't spare none of my white men thet I ken
trust."</p>

<p>"Send him with a couple of the most trustworthy Mexicans you
have," suggested the boss.</p>

<p>"There ain't no sich critter," replied Grayson; "but I guess
that's the best I ken do. I'll send him along with Tony an'
Benito&mdash;they hate each other too much to frame up anything
together, an' they both hate a gringo. I reckon they'll hev a
lovely trip."</p>

<p>"But they'll get back with the money, eh?" queried the boss.</p>

<p>"If Pesita don't get 'em," replied Grayson.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapb10" id="chapb10">X. &mdash; BILLY CRACKS A
SAFE</a></h2>

<p class="first">Billy Byrne, captain, rode into Cuivaca from the
south. He had made a wide detour in order to accomplish this; but
under the circumstances he had thought it wise to do so. In his
pocket was a safe conduct from one of Villa's generals farther
south&mdash;a safe conduct taken by Pesita from the body of one of
his recent victims. It would explain Billy's presence in Cuivaca
since it had been intended to carry its rightful possessor to
Juarez and across the border into the United States.</p>

<p>He found the military establishment at Cuivaca small and ill
commanded. There were soldiers upon the streets; but the only
regularly detailed guard was stationed in front of the bank. No one
questioned Billy. He did not have to show his safe conduct.</p>

<p>"This looks easy," thought Billy. "A reg'lar skinch."</p>

<p>He first attended to his horse, turning him into a public
corral, and then sauntered up the street to the bank, which he
entered, still unquestioned. Inside he changed a bill of large
denomination which Pesita had given him for the purpose of an
excuse to examine the lay of the bank from the inside. Billy took a
long time to count the change. All the time his eyes wandered about
the interior while he made mental notes of such salient features as
might prove of moment to him later. The money counted Billy slowly
rolled a cigarette.</p>

<p>He saw that the bank was roughly divided into two sections by a
wire and wood partition. On one side were the customers, on the
other the clerks and a teller. The latter sat behind a small wicket
through which he received deposits and cashed checks. Back of him,
against the wall, stood a large safe of American manufacture. Billy
had had business before with similar safes. A doorway in the rear
wall led into the yard behind the building. It was closed by a
heavy door covered with sheet iron and fastened by several bolts
and a thick, strong bar. There were no windows in the rear wall.
From that side the bank appeared almost impregnable to silent
assault.</p>

<p>Inside everything was primitive and Billy found himself
wondering how a week passed without seeing a bank robbery in the
town. Possibly the strong rear defenses and the armed guard in
front accounted for it.</p>

<p>Satisfied with what he had learned he passed out onto the
sidewalk and crossed the street to a saloon. Some soldiers and
citizens were drinking at little tables in front of the bar. A
couple of card games were in progress, and through the open rear
doorway Billy saw a little gathering encircling a cock fight.</p>

<p>In none of these things was Billy interested. What he had wished
in entering the saloon was merely an excuse to place himself upon
the opposite side of the street from the bank that he might inspect
the front from the outside without arousing suspicion.</p>

<p>Having purchased and drunk a bottle of poor beer, the
temperature of which had probably never been below eighty since it
left the bottling department of the Texas brewery which inflicted
it upon the ignorant, he sauntered to the front window and looked
out.</p>

<p>There he saw that the bank building was a two-story affair, the
entrance to the second story being at the left side of the first
floor, opening directly onto the sidewalk in full view of the
sentry who paced to and fro before the structure.</p>

<p>Billy wondered what the second floor was utilized for. He saw
soiled hangings at the windows which aroused a hope and a sudden
inspiration. There was a sign above the entrance to the second
floor; but Billy's knowledge of the language had not progressed
sufficiently to permit him to translate it, although he had his
suspicions as to its meaning. He would learn if his guess was
correct.</p>

<p>Returning to the bar he ordered another bottle of beer, and as
he drank it he practiced upon the bartender some of his recently
acquired Spanish and learned, though not without considerable
difficulty, that he might find lodgings for the night upon the
second floor of the bank building.</p>

<p>Much elated, Billy left the saloon and walked along the street
until he came to the one general store of the town. After another
heart rending scrimmage with the language of Ferdinand and Isabella
he succeeded in making several purchases&mdash;two heavy sacks, a
brace, two bits, and a keyhole saw. Placing the tools in one of the
sacks he wrapped the whole in the second sack and made his way back
to the bank building.</p>

<p>Upon the second floor he found the proprietor of the
rooming-house and engaged a room in the rear of the building,
overlooking the yard. The layout was eminently satisfactory to
Captain Byrne and it was with a feeling of great self-satisfaction
that he descended and sought a restaurant.</p>

<p>He had been sent by Pesita merely to look over the ground and
the defenses of the town, that the outlaw might later ride in with
his entire force and loot the bank; but Billy Byrne, out of his
past experience in such matters, had evolved a much simpler plan
for separating the enemy from his wealth.</p>

<p>Having eaten, Billy returned to his room. It was now dark and
the bank closed and unlighted showed that all had left it. Only the
sentry paced up and down the sidewalk in front.</p>

<p>Going at once to his room Billy withdrew his tools from their
hiding place beneath the mattress, and a moment later was busily
engaged in boring holes through the floor at the foot of his bed.
For an hour he worked, cautiously and quietly, until he had a rough
circle of holes enclosing a space about two feet in diameter. Then
he laid aside the brace and bit, and took the keyhole saw, with
which he patiently sawed through the wood between contiguous holes,
until, the circle completed, he lifted out a section of the floor
leaving an aperture large enough to permit him to squeeze his body
through when the time arrived for him to pass into the bank
beneath.</p>

<p>While Billy had worked three men had ridden into Cuivaca. They
were Tony, Benito, and the new bookkeeper of El Orobo Rancho. The
Mexicans, after eating, repaired at once to the joys of the
<i>cantina</i>; while Bridge sought a room in the building to which
his escort directed him.</p>

<p>As chance would have it, it was the same building in which Billy
labored and the room lay upon the rear side of it overlooking the
same yard. But Bridge did not lie awake to inspect his
surroundings. For years he had not ridden as many miles as he had
during the past two days, so that long unused muscles cried out for
rest and relaxation. As a result, Bridge was asleep almost as soon
as his head touched the pillow, and so profound was his slumber
that it seemed that nothing short of a convulsion of nature would
arouse him.</p>

<p>As Bridge lay down upon his bed Billy Byrne left his room and
descended to the street. The sentry before the bank paid no
attention to him, and Billy passed along, unhindered, to the corral
where he had left his horse. Here, as he was saddling the animal,
he was accosted, much to his disgust, by the proprietor.</p>

<p>In broken English the man expressed surprise that Billy rode out
so late at night, and the American thought that he detected
something more than curiosity in the other's manner and
tone&mdash;suspicion of the strange gringo.</p>

<p>It would never do to leave the fellow in that state of mind, and
so Billy leaned close to the other's ear, and with a broad grin and
a wink whispered: "Senorita," and jerked his thumb toward the
south. "I'll be back by mornin'," he added.</p>

<p>The Mexican's manner altered at once. He laughed and nodded,
knowingly, and poked Billy in the ribs. Then he watched him mount
and ride out of the corral toward the south&mdash;which was also in
the direction of the bank, to the rear of which Billy rode without
effort to conceal his movements.</p>

<p>There he dismounted and left his horse standing with the bridle
reins dragging upon the ground, while he removed the lariat from
the pommel of the saddle, and, stuffing it inside his shirt, walked
back to the street on which the building stood, and so made his way
past the sentry and to his room.</p>

<p>Here he pushed back the bed which he had drawn over the hole in
the floor, dropped his two sacks through into the bank, and tying
the brace to one end of the lariat lowered it through after the
sacks.</p>

<p>Looping the middle of the lariat over a bedpost Billy grasped
both strands firmly and lowered himself through the aperture into
the room beneath. He made no more noise in his descent than he had
made upon other similar occasions in his past life when he had
practiced the gentle art of porch-climbing along Ashland Avenue and
Washington Boulevard.</p>

<p>Having gained the floor he pulled upon one end of the lariat
until he had drawn it free of the bedpost above, when it fell into
his waiting hands. Coiling it carefully Billy placed it around his
neck and under one arm. Billy, acting as a professional, was a
careful and methodical man. He always saw that every little detail
was properly attended to before he went on to the next phase of his
endeavors. Because of this ingrained caution Billy had long since
secured the tops of the two sacks together, leaving only a
sufficient opening to permit of their each being filled without
delay or inconvenience.</p>

<p>Now he turned his attention to the rear door. The bar and bolts
were easily shot from their seats from the inside, and Billy saw to
it that this was attended to before he went further with his
labors. It were well to have one's retreat assured at the earliest
possible moment. A single bolt Billy left in place that he might
not be surprised by an intruder; but first he had tested it and
discovered that it could be drawn with ease.</p>

<p>These matters satisfactorily attended to Billy assaulted the
combination knob of the safe with the metal bit which he had
inserted in the brace before lowering it into the bank.</p>

<p>The work was hard and progressed slowly. It was necessary to
withdraw the bit often and lubricate it with a piece of soap which
Billy had brought along in his pocket for the purpose; but
eventually a hole was bored through into the tumblers of the
combination lock.</p>

<p>From without Billy could hear the footsteps of the sentry pacing
back and forth within fifty feet of him, all unconscious that the
bank he was guarding was being looted almost beneath his eyes. Once
a corporal came with another soldier and relieved the sentry. After
that Billy heard the footfalls no longer, for the new sentry was
barefoot.</p>

<p>The boring finished, Billy drew a bit of wire from an inside
pocket and inserted it in the hole. Then, working the wire with
accustomed fingers, he turned the combination knob this way and
that, feeling with the bit of wire until the tumblers should all be
in line.</p>

<p>This, too, was slow work; but it was infinitely less liable to
attract attention than any other method of safe cracking with which
Billy was familiar.</p>

<p>It was long past midnight when Captain Byrne was rewarded with
success&mdash;the tumblers clicked into position, the handle of the
safe door turned and the bolts slipped back.</p>

<p>To swing open the door and transfer the contents of the safe to
the two sacks was the work of but a few minutes. As Billy rose and
threw the heavy burden across a shoulder he heard a challenge from
without, and then a parley. Immediately after the sound of
footsteps ascending the stairway to the rooming-house came plainly
to his ears, and then he had slipped the last bolt upon the rear
door and was out in the yard beyond.</p>

<p><br>
NOW Bridge, sleeping the sleep of utter exhaustion that the boom
of a cannon might not have disturbed, did that inexplicable thing
which every one of us has done a hundred times in our lives. He
awakened, with a start, out of a sound sleep, though no disturbing
noise had reached his ears.</p>

<p>Something impelled him to sit up in bed, and as he did so he
could see through the window beside him into the yard at the rear
of the building. There in the moonlight he saw a man throwing a
sack across the horn of a saddle. He saw the man mount, and he saw
him wheel his horse around about and ride away toward the north.
There seemed to Bridge nothing unusual about the man's act, nor had
there been any indication either of stealth or haste to arouse the
American's suspicions. Bridge lay back again upon his pillows and
sought to woo the slumber which the sudden awakening seemed to have
banished for the remainder of the night.</p>

<p>And up the stairway to the second floor staggered Tony and
Benito. Their money was gone; but they had acquired something else
which appeared much more difficult to carry and not so easily
gotten rid of.</p>

<p>Tony held the key to their room. It was the second room upon the
right of the hall. Tony remembered that very distinctly. He had
impressed it upon his mind before leaving the room earlier in the
evening, for Tony had feared some such contingency as that which
had befallen.</p>

<p>Tony fumbled with the handle of a door, and stabbed vainly at an
elusive keyhole.</p>

<p>"Wait," mumbled Benito. "This is not the room. It was the second
door from the stairway. This is the third."</p>

<p>Tony lurched about and staggered back. Tony reasoned: "If that
was the third door the next behind me must be the second, and on
the right;" but Tony took not into consideration that he had
reversed the direction of his erratic wobbling. He lunged across
the hall&mdash;not because he wished to but because the spirits
moved him. He came in contact with a door. "This, then, must be the
second door," he soliloquized, "and it is upon my right. Ah,
Benito, this is the room!"</p>

<p>Benito was skeptical. He said as much; but Tony was obdurate.
Did he not know a second door when he saw one? Was he, furthermore,
not a grown man and therefore entirely capable of distinguishing
between his left hand and his right? Yes! Tony was all of that, and
more, so Tony inserted the key in the lock&mdash;it would have
turned any lock upon the second floor&mdash;and, lo! the door swung
inward upon its hinges.</p>

<p>"Ah! Benito," cried Tony. "Did I not tell you so? See! This is
our room, for the key opens the door."</p>

<p>The room was dark. Tony, carried forward by the weight of his
head, which had long since grown unaccountably heavy, rushed his
feet rapidly forward that he might keep them within a few inches of
his center of equilibrium.</p>

<p>The distance which it took his feet to catch up with his head
was equal to the distance between the doorway and the foot of the
bed, and when Tony reached that spot, with Benito meandering after
him, the latter, much to his astonishment, saw in the diffused
moonlight which pervaded the room, the miraculous disappearance of
his former enemy and erstwhile friend. Then from the depths below
came a wild scream and a heavy thud.</p>

<p>The sentry upon the beat before the bank heard both. For an
instant he stood motionless, then he called aloud for the guard,
and turned toward the bank door. But this was locked and he could
but peer in through the windows. Seeing a dark form within, and
being a Mexican he raised his rifle and fired through the glass of
the doors.</p>

<p>Tony, who had dropped through the hole which Billy had used so
quietly, heard the zing of a bullet pass his head, and the impact
as it sploshed into the adobe wall behind him. With a second yell
Tony dodged behind the safe and besought <i>Mary</i> to protect
him.</p>

<p>From above Benito peered through the hole into the blackness
below. Down the hall came the barefoot landlord, awakened by the
screams and the shot. Behind him came Bridge, buckling his revolver
belt about his hips as he ran. Not having been furnished with
pajamas Bridge had not thought it necessary to remove his clothing,
and so he had lost no time in dressing.</p>

<p>When the two, now joined by Benito, reached the street they
found the guard there, battering in the bank doors. Benito, fearing
for the life of Tony, which if anyone took should be taken by him,
rushed upon the sergeant of the guard, explaining with both lips
and hands the remarkable accident which had precipitated Tony into
the bank.</p>

<p>The sergeant listened, though he did not believe, and when the
doors had fallen in, he commanded Tony to come out with his hands
above his head. Then followed an investigation which disclosed the
looting of the safe, and the great hole in the ceiling through
which Tony had tumbled.</p>

<p>The bank president came while the sergeant and the landlord were
in Billy's room investigating. Bridge had followed them.</p>

<p>"It was the gringo," cried the excited Boniface. "This is his
room. He has cut a hole in my floor which I shall have to pay to
have repaired."</p>

<p>A captain came next, sleepy-eyed and profane. When he heard what
had happened and that the wealth which he had been detailed to
guard had been taken while he slept, he tore his hair and promised
that the sentry should be shot at dawn.</p>

<p>By the time they had returned to the street all the male
population of Cuivaca was there and most of the female.</p>

<p>"One-thousand dollars," cried the bank president, "to the man
who stops the thief and returns to me what the villain has
stolen."</p>

<p>A detachment of soldiers was in the saddle and passing the bank
as the offer was made.</p>

<p>"Which way did he go?" asked the captain. "Did no one see him
leave?"</p>

<p>Bridge was upon the point of saying that he had seen him and
that he had ridden north, when it occurred to him that a thousand
dollars&mdash;even a thousand dollars Mex&mdash;was a great deal of
money, and that it would carry both himself and Billy to Rio and
leave something for pleasure beside.</p>

<p>Then up spoke a tall, thin man with the skin of a coffee
bean.</p>

<p>"I saw him, Señor Capitan," he cried. "He kept his horse in my
corral, and at night he came and took it out saying that he was
riding to visit a senorita. He fooled me, the scoundrel; but I will
tell you&mdash;he rode south. I saw him ride south with my own
eyes."</p>

<p>"Then we shall have him before morning," cried the captain, "for
there is but one place to the south where a robber would ride, and
he has not had sufficient start of us that he can reach safety
before we overhaul him. Forward! March!" and the detachment moved
down the narrow street. "Trot! March!" And as they passed the
store: "Gallop! March!"</p>

<p>Bridge almost ran the length of the street to the corral. His
pony must be rested by now, and a few miles to the north the gringo
whose capture meant a thousand dollars to Bridge was on the road to
liberty.</p>

<p>"I hate to do it," thought Bridge; "because, even if he is a
bank robber, he's an American; but I need the money and in all
probability the fellow is a scoundrel who should have been hanged
long ago."</p>

<p><br>
OVER the trail to the north rode Captain Billy Byrne, secure in
the belief that no pursuit would develop until after the opening
hour of the bank in the morning, by which time he would be halfway
on his return journey to Pesita's camp.</p>

<p>"Ol' man Pesita'll be some surprised when I show him what I got
for him," mused Billy. "Say!" he exclaimed suddenly and aloud, "Why
the devil should I take all this swag back to that yellow-faced
yegg? Who pulled this thing off anyway? Why me, of course, and does
anybody think Billy Byrne's boob enough to split with a guy that
didn't have a hand in it at all. Split! Why the nut'll take it
all!</p>

<p>"Nix! Me for the border. I couldn't do a thing with all this
coin down in Rio, an' Bridgie'll be along there most any time. We
can hit it up some in lil' ol' Rio on this bunch o' dough. Why, say
kid, there must be a million here, from the weight of it."</p>

<p>A frown suddenly clouded his face. "Why did I take it?" he asked
himself. "Was I crackin' a safe, or was I pullin' off something
fine fer poor, bleedin' Mexico? If I was a-doin' that they ain't
nothin' criminal in what I done&mdash;except to the guy that owned
the coin. If I was just plain crackin' a safe on my own hook why
then I'm a crook again an' I can't be that&mdash;no, not with that
face of yours standin' out there so plain right in front of me,
just as though you were there yourself, askin' me to remember an'
be decent. God! Barbara&mdash;why wasn't I born for the likes of
you, and not just a measly, ornery mucker like I am. Oh, hell! what
is that that Bridge sings of Knibbs's:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"There ain't no sweet Penelope somewhere that's longing much for me,<br>
But I can smell the blundering sea, And hear the rigging hum;<br>
And I can hear the whispering lips that fly before the out-bound ships,<br>
And I can hear the breakers on the sand a-calling 'Come!'"</p>
<br>

<p>Billy took off his hat and scratched his head.</p>

<p>"Funny," he thought, "how a girl and poetry can get a tough nut
like me. I wonder what the guys that used to hang out in back of
Kelly's 'ud say if they seen what was goin' on in my bean just now.
They'd call me Lizzy, eh? Well, they wouldn't call me Lizzy more'n
once. I may be gettin' soft in the head, but I'm all to the good
with my dukes."</p>

<p>Speed is not conducive to sentimental thoughts and so Billy had
unconsciously permitted his pony to drop into a lazy walk. There
was no need for haste anyhow. No one knew yet that the bank had
been robbed, or at least so Billy argued. He might, however, have
thought differently upon the subject of haste could he have had a
glimpse of the horseman in his rear&mdash;two miles behind him,
now, but rapidly closing up the distance at a keen gallop, while he
strained his eyes across the moonlit flat ahead in eager search for
his quarry.</p>

<p>So absorbed was Billy Byrne in his reflections that his ears
were deaf to the pounding of the hoofs of the pursuer's horse upon
the soft dust of the dry road until Bridge was little more than a
hundred yards from him. For the last half-mile Bridge had had the
figure of the fugitive in full view and his mind had been playing
rapidly with seductive visions of the one-thousand dollars
reward&mdash;one-thousand dollars Mex, perhaps, but still quite
enough to excite pleasant thoughts. At the first glimpse of the
horseman ahead Bridge had reined his mount down to a trot that the
noise of his approach might thereby be lessened. He had drawn his
revolver from its holster, and was upon the point of putting spurs
to his horse for a sudden dash upon the fugitive when the man
ahead, finally attracted by the noise of the other's approach,
turned in his saddle and saw him.</p>

<p>Neither recognized the other, and at Bridge's command of, "Hands
up!" Billy, lightning-like in his quickness, drew and fired. The
bullet raked Bridge's hat from his head but left him unscathed.</p>

<p>Billy had wheeled his pony around until he stood broadside
toward Bridge. The latter fired scarce a second after Billy's shot
had pinged so perilously close&mdash;fired at a perfect target but
fifty yards away.</p>

<p>At the sound of the report the robber's horse reared and
plunged, then, wheeling and tottering high upon its hind feet, fell
backward. Billy, realizing that his mount had been hit, tried to
throw himself from the saddle; but until the very moment that the
beast toppled over the man was held by his cartridge belt which, as
the animal first lunged, had caught over the high horn of the
Mexican saddle.</p>

<p>The belt slipped from the horn as the horse was falling, and
Billy succeeded in throwing himself a little to one side. One leg,
however, was pinned beneath the animal's body and the force of the
fall jarred the revolver from Billy's hand to drop just beyond his
reach.</p>

<p>His carbine was in its boot at the horse's side, and the animal
was lying upon it. Instantly Bridge rode to his side and covered
him with his revolver.</p>

<p>"Don't move," he commanded, "or I'll be under the painful
necessity of terminating your earthly endeavors right here and
now."</p>

<p>"Well, for the love o' Mike!" cried the fallen bandit "You?"</p>

<p>Bridge was off his horse the instant that the familiar voice
sounded in his ears.</p>

<p>"Billy!" he exclaimed. "Why&mdash;Billy&mdash;was it you who
robbed the bank?"</p>

<p>Even as he spoke Bridge was busy easing the weight of the dead
pony from Billy's leg.</p>

<p>"Anything broken?" he asked as the bandit struggled to free
himself.</p>

<p>"Not so you could notice it," replied Billy, and a moment later
he was on his feet. "Say, bo," he added, "it's a mighty good thing
you dropped little pinto here, for I'd a sure got you my next shot.
Gee! it makes me sweat to think of it. But about this bank robbin'
business. You can't exactly say that I robbed a bank. That money
was the enemy's resources, an' I just nicked their resources.
That's war. That ain't robbery. I ain't takin' it for
myself&mdash;it's for the cause&mdash;the cause o' poor, bleedin'
Mexico," and Billy grinned a large grin.</p>

<p>"You took it for Pesita?" asked Bridge.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Billy. "I won't get a jitney of it. I
wouldn't take none of it, Bridge, honest. I'm on the square
now."</p>

<p>"I know you are, Billy," replied the other; "but if you're
caught you might find it difficult to convince the authorities of
your highmindedness and your disinterestedness."</p>

<p>"Authorities!" scoffed Billy. "There ain't no authorities in
Mexico. One bandit is just as good as another, and from Pesita to
Carranza they're all bandits at heart. They ain't a one of 'em that
gives two whoops in hell for poor, bleedin' Mexico&mdash;unless
they can do the bleedin' themselves. It's dog eat dog here. If they
caught me they'd shoot me whether I'd robbed their bank or not.
What's that?" Billy was suddenly alert, straining his eyes back in
the direction of Cuivaca.</p>

<p>"They're coming, Billy," said Bridge. "Take my
horse&mdash;quick! You must get out of here in a hurry. The whole
post is searching for you. I thought that they went toward the
south, though. Some of them must have circled."</p>

<p>"What'll you do if I take your horse?" asked Billy.</p>

<p>"I can walk back," said Bridge, "it isn't far to town. I'll tell
them that I had come only a short distance when my horse threw me
and ran away. They'll believe it for they think I'm a rotten
horseman&mdash;the two <i>vaqueros</i> who escorted me to town I
mean."</p>

<p>Billy hesitated. "I hate to do it, Bridge," he said.</p>

<p>"You must, Billy," urged the other.</p>

<p>"If they find us here together it'll merely mean that the two of
us will get it, for I'll stick with you, Billy, and we can't fight
off a whole troop of cavalry out here in the open. If you take my
horse we can both get out of it, and later I'll see you in Rio.
Good-bye, Billy, I'm off for town," and Bridge turned and started
back along the road on foot.</p>

<p>Billy watched him in silence for a moment. The truth of Bridge's
statement of fact was so apparent that Billy was forced to accept
the plan. A moment later he transferred the bags of loot to
Bridge's pony, swung into the saddle, and took a last backward look
at the diminishing figure of the man swinging along in the
direction of Cuivaca.</p>

<p>"Say," he muttered to himself; "but you're a right one, bo," and
wheeling to the north he clapped his spurs to his new mount and
loped easily off into the night.</p>

<h2><a name="chapb11" id="chapb11">XI. &mdash; BARBARA RELEASES A
CONSPIRATOR</a></h2>

<p class="first">It was a week later, yet Grayson still was
growling about the loss of "that there Brazos pony." Grayson, the
boss, and the boss's daughter were sitting upon the veranda of the
ranchhouse when the foreman reverted to the subject.</p>

<p>"I knew I didn't have no business hirin' a man thet can't ride,"
he said. "Why thet there Brazos pony never did stumble, an' if he'd
of stumbled he'd a-stood aroun' a year waitin' to be caught up
agin. I jest cain't figger it out no ways how thet there tenderfoot
bookkeeper lost him. He must a-shooed him away with a stick. An'
saddle an' bridle an' all gone too. Doggone it!"</p>

<p>"I'm the one who should be peeved," spoke up the girl with a wry
smile. "Brazos was my pony. He's the one you picked out for me to
ride while I am here; but I am sure poor Mr. Bridge feels as badly
about it as anyone, and I know that he couldn't help it. We
shouldn't be too hard on him. We might just as well attempt to hold
him responsible for the looting of the bank and the loss of the
pay-roll money."</p>

<p>"Well," said Grayson, "I give him thet horse 'cause I knew he
couldn't ride, an' thet was the safest horse in the cavvy. I wisht
I'd given him Santa Anna instid&mdash;I wouldn't a-minded losin'
him. There won't no one ride him anyhow he's thet ornery."</p>

<p>"The thing that surprises me most," remarked the boss, "is that
Brazos doesn't come back. He was foaled on this range, and he's
never been ridden anywhere else, has he?"</p>

<p>"He was foaled right here on this ranch," Grayson corrected him,
"and he ain't never been more'n a hundred mile from it. If he ain't
dead or stolen he'd a-ben back afore the bookkeeper was. It's
almighty queer."</p>

<p>"What sort of bookkeeper is Mr. Bridge?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's all right I guess," replied Grayson grudgingly. "A
feller's got to be some good at something. He's probably one of
these here paper-collar, cracker-fed college dudes thet don't know
nothin' else 'cept writin' in books."</p>

<p>The girl rose, smiled, and moved away.</p>

<p>"I like Mr. Bridge, anyhow," she called back over her shoulder,
"for whatever he may not be he is certainly a well-bred gentleman,"
which speech did not tend to raise Mr. Bridge in the estimation of
the hard-fisted ranch foreman.</p>

<p>"Funny them greasers don't come in from the north range with
thet bunch o' steers. They ben gone all day now," he said to the
boss, ignoring the girl's parting sally.</p>

<p><br>
BRIDGE sat tip-tilted against the front of the office building
reading an ancient magazine which he had found within. His day's
work was done and he was but waiting for the gong that would call
him to the evening meal with the other employees of the ranch. The
magazine failed to rouse his interest. He let it drop idly to his
knees and with eyes closed reverted to his never-failing source of
entertainment.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"And then that slim, poetic guy he turned and looked me in the eye;<br>
'....It's overland and overland and overseas to&mdash;where?'<br>
'Most anywhere that isn't here,' I says. His face went kind of queer.<br>
'The place we're in is always here. The other place is there.'"</p>
<br>

<p>Bridge stretched luxuriously. "'There,'" he repeated. "I've been
searching for <i>there</i> for many years; but for some reason I
can never get away from <i>here</i>. About two weeks of any place
on earth and that place is just plain <i>here</i> to me, and I'm
longing once again for <i>there</i>."</p>

<p>His musings were interrupted by a sweet feminine voice close by.
Bridge did not open his eyes at once&mdash;he just sat there,
listening.</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"As I was hiking past the woods, the cool and sleepy summer woods,<br>
I saw a guy a-talking to the sunshine in the air;<br>
Thinks I, 'He's going to have a fit&mdash; I'll stick around and watch a bit,'<br>
But he paid no attention, hardly knowing I was there."</p>
<br>

<p>Then the girl broke into a merry laugh and Bridge opened his
eyes and came to his feet.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you cared for that sort of stuff," he said.
"Knibbs writes man-verse. I shouldn't have imagined that it would
appeal to a young lady."</p>

<p>"But it does, though," she replied; "at least to me. There's a
swing to it and a freedom that 'gets me in the eye.'"</p>

<p>Again she laughed, and when this girl laughed, harder-headed and
much older men than Mr. L. Bridge felt strange emotions move within
their breasts.</p>

<p>For a week Barbara had seen a great deal of the new bookkeeper.
Aside from her father he was the only man of culture and refinement
of which the rancho could boast, or, as the rancho would have put
it, be ashamed of.</p>

<p>She had often sought the veranda of the little office and lured
the new bookkeeper from his work, and on several occasions had had
him at the ranchhouse. Not only was he an interesting talker; but
there was an element of mystery about him which appealed to the
girl's sense of romance.</p>

<p>She knew that he was a gentleman born and reared, and she often
found herself wondering what tragic train of circumstances had set
him adrift among the flotsam of humanity's wreckage. Too, the same
persistent conviction that she had known him somewhere in the past
that possessed her father clung to her mind; but she could not
place him.</p>

<p>"I overheard your dissertation on <i>here and there</i>," said
the girl. "I could not very well help it&mdash;it would have been
rude to interrupt a conversation." Her eyes sparkled mischievously
and her cheeks dimpled.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have been interrupting a conversation," objected
Bridge, smiling; "you would have been turning a monologue into a
conversation."</p>

<p>"But it was a conversation," insisted the girl. "The wanderer
was conversing with the bookkeeper. You are a victim of wanderlust,
Mr. L. Bridge&mdash;don't deny it. You hate bookkeeping, or any
other such prosaic vocation as requires permanent residence in one
place."</p>

<p>"Come now," expostulated the man. "That is hardly fair. Haven't
I been here a whole week?"</p>

<p>They both laughed.</p>

<p>"What in the world can have induced you to remain so long?"
cried Barbara. "How very much like an old timer you must
feel&mdash;one of the oldest inhabitants."</p>

<p>"I am a regular aborigine," declared Bridge; but his heart would
have chosen another reply. It would have been glad to tell the girl
that there was a very real and a very growing inducement to remain
at El Orobo Rancho. The man was too self-controlled, however, to
give way to the impulses of his heart.</p>

<p>At first he had just liked the girl, and been immensely glad of
her companionship because there was so much that was common to them
both&mdash;a love for good music, good pictures, and good
literature&mdash;things Bridge hadn't had an opportunity to discuss
with another for a long, long time.</p>

<p>And slowly he had found delight in just sitting and looking at
her. He was experienced enough to realize that this was a dangerous
symptom, and so from the moment he had been forced to acknowledge
it to himself he had been very careful to guard his speech and his
manner in the girl's presence.</p>

<p>He found pleasure in dreaming of what might have been as he sat
watching the girl's changing expression as different moods
possessed her; but as for permitting a hope, even, of realization
of his dreams&mdash;ah, he was far too practical for that, dreamer
though he was.</p>

<p>As the two talked Grayson passed. His rather stern face clouded
as he saw the girl and the new bookkeeper laughing there
together.</p>

<p>"Ain't you got nothin' to do?" he asked Bridge.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied the latter.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you do it?" snapped Grayson.</p>

<p>"I am," said Bridge.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bridge is entertaining me," interrupted the girl, before
Grayson could make any rejoinder. "It is my fault&mdash;I took him
from his work. You don't mind, do you, Mr. Grayson?"</p>

<p>Grayson mumbled an inarticulate reply and went his way.</p>

<p>"Mr. Grayson does not seem particularly enthusiastic about me,"
laughed Bridge.</p>

<p>"No," replied the girl, candidly; "but I think it's just because
you can't ride."</p>

<p>"Can't ride!" ejaculated Bridge. "Why, haven't I been riding
ever since I came here?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Grayson doesn't consider anything in the way of
equestrianism riding unless the ridden is perpetually seeking the
life of the rider," explained Barbara. "Just at present he is
terribly put out because you lost Brazos. He says Brazos never
stumbled in his life, and even if you had fallen from his back he
would have stood beside you waiting for you to remount him. You see
he was the kindest horse on the ranch&mdash;especially picked for
me to ride. However in the world <i>did</i> you lose him, Mr.
Bridge?"</p>

<p>The girl was looking full at the man as she propounded her
query. Bridge was silent. A faint flush overspread his face. He had
not before known that the horse was hers. He couldn't very well
tell her the truth, and he wouldn't lie to her, so he made no
reply.</p>

<p>Barbara saw the flush and noted the man's silence. For the first
time her suspicions were aroused, yet she would not believe that
this gentle, amiable drifter could be guilty of any crime greater
than negligence or carelessness. But why his evident embarrassment
now? The girl was mystified. For a moment or two they sat in
silence, then Barbara rose.</p>

<p>"I must run along back now," she explained. "Papa will be
wondering what has become of me."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bridge, and let her go. He would have been glad to
tell her the truth; but he couldn't do that without betraying
Billy. He had heard enough to know that Francisco Villa had been so
angered over the bold looting of the bank in the face of a company
of his own soldiers that he would stop at nothing to secure the
person of the thief once his identity was known. Bridge was
perfectly satisfied with the ethics of his own act on the night of
the bank robbery. He knew that the girl would have applauded him,
and that Grayson himself would have done what Bridge did had a like
emergency confronted the ranch foreman; but to have admitted
complicity in the escape of the fugitive would have been to have
exposed himself to the wrath of Villa, and at the same time
revealed the identity of the thief. "Nor," thought Bridge, "would
it get Brazos back for Barbara."</p>

<p><br>
IT was after dark when the <i>vaqueros</i> Grayson had sent to
the north range returned to the ranch. They came empty-handed and
slowly for one of them supported a wounded comrade on the saddle
before him. They rode directly to the office where Grayson and
Bridge were going over some of the business of the day, and when
the former saw them his brow clouded for he knew before he heard
their story what had happened.</p>

<p>"Who done it?" he asked, as the men filed into the office, half
carrying the wounded man.</p>

<p>"Some of Pesita's followers," replied Benito.</p>

<p>"Did they git the steers, too?" inquired Grayson.</p>

<p>"Part of them&mdash;we drove off most and scattered them. We saw
the Brazos pony, too," and Benito looked from beneath heavy lashes
in the direction of the bookkeeper.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Grayson.</p>

<p>"One of Pesita's officers rode him&mdash;an Americano. Tony and
I saw this same man in Cuivaca the night the bank was robbed, and
today he was riding the Brazos pony." Again the dark eyes turned
toward Bridge.</p>

<p>Grayson was quick to catch the significance of the Mexican's
meaning. The more so as it was directly in line with suspicions
which he himself had been nursing since the robbery.</p>

<p>During the colloquy the boss entered the office. He had heard
the returning <i>vaqueros</i> ride into the ranch and noting that
they brought no steers with them had come to the office to hear
their story. Barbara, spurred by curiosity, accompanied her
father.</p>

<p>"You heard what Benito says?" asked Grayson, turning toward his
employer</p>

<p>The latter nodded. All eyes were upon Bridge.</p>

<p>"Well," snapped Grayson, "what you gotta say fer yourself? I ben
suspectin' you right along. I knew derned well that that there
Brazos pony never run off by hisself. You an' that other crook from
the States framed this whole thing up pretty slick, didn'tcha?
Well, we'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, wait a moment, Grayson," interrupted the boss.
"Give Mr. Bridge a chance to explain. You're making a rather
serious charge against him without any particularly strong proof to
back your accusation."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," exclaimed Bridge, with a smile. "I have
known that Mr. Grayson suspected me of implication in the robbery;
but who can blame him&mdash;a man who can't ride might be guilty of
almost anything."</p>

<p>Grayson sniffed. Barbara took a step nearer Bridge. She had been
ready to doubt him herself only an hour or so ago; but that was
before he had been accused. Now that she found others arrayed
against him her impulse was to come to his defense.</p>

<p>"You didn't do it, did you, Mr. Bridge?" Her tone was almost
pleading.</p>

<p>"If you mean robbing the bank," he replied; "I did not Miss
Barbara. I knew no more about it until after it was over than
Benito or Tony&mdash;in fact they were the ones who discovered it
while I was still asleep in my room above the bank."</p>

<p>"Well, how did the robber git thet there Brazos pony then?"
demanded Grayson savagely. "Thet's what I want to know."</p>

<p>"You'll have to ask him, Mr. Grayson," replied Bridge.</p>

<p>"Villa'll ask him, when he gits holt of him," snapped Grayson;
"but I reckon he'll git all the information out of you thet he
wants first. He'll be in Cuivaca tomorrer, an' so will you."</p>

<p>"You mean that you are going to turn me over to General Villa?"
asked Bridge. "You are going to turn an American over to that
butcher knowing that he'll be shot inside of twenty-four hours?</p>

<p>"Shootin's too damned good fer a horse thief," replied
Grayson.</p>

<p>Barbara turned impulsively toward her father. "You won't let Mr.
Grayson do that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Mr. Grayson knows best how to handle such an affair as this,
Barbara," replied her father. "He is my superintendent, and I have
made it a point never to interfere with him."</p>

<p>"You will let Mr. Bridge be shot without making an effort to
save him?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"We do not know that he will be shot," replied the ranch owner.
"If he is innocent there is no reason why he should be punished. If
he is guilty of implication in the Cuivaca bank robbery he
deserves, according to the rules of war, to die, for General Villa,
I am told, considers that a treasonable act. Some of the funds upon
which his government depends for munitions of war were
there&mdash;they were stolen and turned over to the enemies of
Mexico."</p>

<p>"And if we interfere we'll turn Villa against us," interposed
Grayson. "He ain't any too keen for Americans as it is. Why, if
this fellow was my brother I'd hev to turn him over to the
authorities."</p>

<p>"Well, I thank God," exclaimed Bridge fervently, "that in
addition to being shot by Villa I don't have to endure the added
disgrace of being related to you, and I'm not so sure that I shall
be hanged by Villa," and with that he wiped the oil lamp from the
table against which he had been leaning, and leaped across the room
for the doorway.</p>

<p>Barbara and her father had been standing nearest the exit, and
as the girl realized the bold break for liberty the man was making,
she pushed her father to one side and threw open the door.</p>

<p>Bridge was through it in an instant, with a parting, "God bless
you, little girl!" as he passed her. Then the door was closed with
a bang. Barbara turned the key, withdrew it from the lock and threw
it across the darkened room.</p>

<p>Grayson and the unwounded Mexicans leaped after the fugitive
only to find their way barred by the locked door. Outside Bridge
ran to the horses standing patiently with lowered heads awaiting
the return of their masters. In an instant he was astride one of
them, and lashing the others ahead of him with a quirt he spurred
away into the night.</p>

<p>By the time Grayson and the Mexicans had wormed their way
through one of the small windows of the office the new bookkeeper
was beyond sight and earshot.</p>

<p>As the ranch foreman was saddling up with several of his men in
the corral to give chase to the fugitive the boss strolled in and
touched him on the arm.</p>

<p>"Mr. Grayson," he said, "I have made it a point never to
interfere with you; but I am going to ask you now not to pursue Mr.
Bridge. I shall be glad if he makes good his escape. Barbara was
right&mdash;he is a fellow-American. We cannot turn him over to
Villa, or any other Mexican to be murdered."</p>

<p>Grumblingly Grayson unsaddled. "Ef you'd seen what I've seen
around here," he said, "I guess you wouldn't be so keen to save
this feller's hide."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the boss.</p>

<p>"I mean that he's ben tryin' to make love to your daughter."</p>

<p>The older man laughed. "Don't be a fool, Grayson," he said, and
walked away.</p>

<p><br>
AN hour later Barbara was strolling up and down before the
ranchhouse in the cool and refreshing air of the Chihuahua night.
Her mind was occupied with disquieting reflections of the past few
hours. Her pride was immeasurably hurt by the part impulse had
forced her to take in the affair at the office. Not that she
regretted that she had connived in the escape of Bridge; but it was
humiliating that a girl of her position should have been compelled
to play so melodramatic a part before Grayson and his Mexican
<i>vaqueros</i>.</p>

<p>Then, too, was she disappointed in Bridge. She had looked upon
him as a gentleman whom misfortune and wanderlust had reduced to
the lowest stratum of society. Now she feared that he belonged to
that substratum which lies below the lowest which society
recognizes as a part of itself, and which is composed solely of the
criminal class.</p>

<p>It was hard for Barbara to realize that she had associated with
a thief&mdash;just for a moment it was hard, until recollection
forced upon her the unwelcome fact of the status of another whom
she had known&mdash;to whom she had given her love. The girl did
not wince at the thought&mdash;instead she squared her shoulders
and raised her chin.</p>

<p>"I am proud of him, whatever he may have been," she murmured;
but she was not thinking of the new bookkeeper. When she did think
again of Bridge it was to be glad that he had escaped&mdash;"for he
is an American, like myself."</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed a voice behind her. "You played us a pretty
trick, Miss Barbara."</p>

<p>The girl turned to see Grayson approaching. To her surprise he
seemed to hold no resentment whatsoever. She greeted him
courteously.</p>

<p>"I couldn't let you turn an American over to General Villa," she
said, "no matter what he had done."</p>

<p>"I liked your spirit," said the man. "You're the kind o' girl I
ben lookin' fer all my life&mdash;one with nerve an' grit, an' you
got 'em both. You liked thet bookkeepin' critter, an' he wasn't
half a man. I like you an' I am a man, ef I do say so myself."</p>

<p>The girl drew back in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Grayson!" she exclaimed. "You are forgetting yourself."</p>

<p>"No I ain't," he cried hoarsely. "I love you an' I'm goin' to
have you. You'd love me too ef you knew me better."</p>

<p>He took a step forward and grasped her arm, trying to draw her
to him. The girl pushed him away with one hand, and with the other
struck him across the face.</p>

<p>Grayson dropped her arm, and as he did so she drew herself to
her full height and looked him straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>"You may go now," she said, her voice like ice. "I shall never
speak of this to anyone&mdash;provided you never attempt to repeat
it."</p>

<p>The man made no reply. The blow in the face had cooled his ardor
temporarily, but had it not also served another purpose?&mdash;to
crystallize it into a firm and inexorable resolve.</p>

<p>When he had departed Barbara turned and entered the house.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapb12" id="chapb12">XII. &mdash; BILLY TO THE
RESCUE</a></h2>

<p class="first">It was nearly ten o'clock the following morning
when Barbara, sitting upon the veranda of the ranchhouse, saw her
father approaching from the direction of the office. His face wore
a troubled expression which the girl could not but note.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Papa?" she asked, as he sank into a chair at
her side.</p>

<p>"Your self-sacrifice of last evening was all to no avail," he
replied. "Bridge has been captured by Villistas."</p>

<p>"What?" cried the girl. "You can't mean it&mdash;how did you
learn?"</p>

<p>"Grayson just had a phone message from Cuivaca," he explained.
"They only repaired the line yesterday since Pesita's men cut it
last month. This was our first message. And do you know, Barbara, I
can't help feeling sorry. I had hoped that he would get away."</p>

<p>"So had I," said the girl.</p>

<p>Her father was eyeing her closely to note the effect of his
announcement upon her; but he could see no greater concern
reflected than that which he himself felt for a fellow-man and an
American who was doomed to death at the hands of an alien race, far
from his own land and his own people.</p>

<p>"Can nothing be done?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Absolutely," he replied with finality. "I have talked it over
with Grayson and he assures me that an attempt at intervention upon
our part might tend to antagonize Villa, in which case we are all
as good as lost. He is none too fond of us as it is, and Grayson
believes, and not without reason, that he would welcome the
slightest pretext for withdrawing the protection of his favor.
Instantly he did that we should become the prey of every marauding
band that infests the mountains. Not only would Pesita swoop down
upon us, but those companies of freebooters which acknowledge
nominal loyalty to Villa would be about our ears in no time. No,
dear, we may do nothing. The young man has made his bed, and now I
am afraid that he will have to lie in it alone."</p>

<p>For awhile the girl sat in silence, and presently her father
arose and entered the house. Shortly after she followed him,
reappearing soon in riding togs and walking rapidly to the corrals.
Here she found an American cowboy busily engaged in whittling a
stick as he sat upon an upturned cracker box and shot accurate
streams of tobacco juice at a couple of industrious tumble bugs
that had had the great impudence to roll their little ball of
provender within the whittler's range.</p>

<p>"O Eddie!" she cried.</p>

<p>The man looked up, and was at once electrified into action. He
sprang to his feet and whipped off his sombrero. A broad smile
illumined his freckled face.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss," he answered. "What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Saddle a pony for me, Eddie," she explained. "I want to take a
little ride."</p>

<p>"Sure!" he assured her cheerily. "Have it ready in a jiffy," and
away he went, uncoiling his <i>riata</i>, toward the little group
of saddle ponies which stood in the corral against necessity for
instant use.</p>

<p>In a couple of minutes he came back leading one, which he tied
to the corral bars.</p>

<p>"But I can't ride that horse," exclaimed the girl. "He
bucks."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Eddie. "I'm a-goin' to ride him."</p>

<p>"Oh, are you going somewhere?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' with you, miss," announced Eddie, sheepishly.</p>

<p>"But I didn't ask you, Eddie, and I don't want you&mdash;today,"
she urged.</p>

<p>"Sorry, miss," he threw back over his shoulder as he walked back
to rope a second pony; "but them's orders. You're not to be allowed
to ride no place without a escort. 'Twouldn't be safe neither,
miss," he almost pleaded, "an' I won't hinder you none. I'll ride
behind far enough to be there ef I'm needed."</p>

<p>Directly he came back with another pony, a sad-eyed,
gentle-appearing little beast, and commenced saddling and bridling
the two.</p>

<p>"Will you promise," she asked, after watching him in silence for
a time, "that you will tell no one where I go or whom I see?"</p>

<p>"Cross my heart hope to die," he assured her.</p>

<p>"All right, Eddie, then I'll let you come with me, and you can
ride beside me, instead of behind."</p>

<p>Across the flat they rode, following the windings of the river
road, one mile, two, five, ten. Eddie had long since been wondering
what the purpose of so steady a pace could be. This was no pleasure
ride which took the boss's daughter&mdash;"heifer," Eddie would
have called her&mdash;ten miles up river at a hard trot. Eddie was
worried, too. They had passed the danger line, and were well within
the stamping ground of Pesita and his retainers. Here each little
adobe dwelling, and they were scattered at intervals of a mile or
more along the river, contained a rabid partisan of Pesita, or it
contained no one&mdash;Pesita had seen to this latter condition
personally.</p>

<p>At last the young lady drew rein before a squalid and
dilapidated hut. Eddie gasped. It was José's, and José was a
notorious scoundrel whom old age alone kept from the active pursuit
of the only calling he ever had known&mdash;brigandage. Why should
the boss's daughter come to José? José was hand in glove with every
cutthroat in Chihuahua, or at least within a radius of two hundred
miles of his abode.</p>

<p>Barbara swung herself from the saddle, and handed her bridle
reins to Eddie.</p>

<p>"Hold him, please," she said. "I'll be gone but a moment."</p>

<p>"You're not goin' in there to see old José alone?" gasped
Eddie.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked. "If you're afraid you can leave my horse
and ride along home."</p>

<p>Eddie colored to the roots of his sandy hair, and kept silent.
The girl approached the doorway of the mean hovel and peered
within. At one end sat a bent old man, smoking. He looked up as
Barbara's figure darkened the doorway.</p>

<p>"José!" said the girl.</p>

<p>The old man rose to his feet and came toward her.</p>

<p>"Eh? Senorita, eh?" he cackled.</p>

<p>"You are José?" she asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Si</i>, senorita," replied the old Indian. "What can poor
old José do to serve the beautiful senorita?"</p>

<p>"You can carry a message to one of Pesita's officers," replied
the girl. "I have heard much about you since I came to Mexico. I
know that there is not another man in this part of Chihuahua who
may so easily reach Pesita as you." She raised her hand for silence
as the Indian would have protested. Then she reached into the
pocket of her riding breeches and withdrew a handful of silver
which she permitted to trickle, tinklingly, from one palm to the
other. "I wish you to go to the camp of Pesita," she continued,
"and carry word to the man who robbed the bank at Cuivaca&mdash;he
is an American&mdash;that his friend, Señor Bridge has been
captured by Villa and is being held for execution in Cuivaca. You
must go at once&mdash;you must get word to Señor Bridge's friend so
that help may reach Señor Bridge before dawn. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>The Indian nodded assent.</p>

<p>"Here," said the girl, "is a payment on account. When I know
that you delivered the message in time you shall have as much more.
Will you do it?"</p>

<p>"I will try," said the Indian, and stretched forth a clawlike
hand for the money.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Barbara. "Now start at once," and she dropped
the silver coins into the old man's palm.</p>

<p><br>
IT was dusk when Captain Billy Byrne was summoned to the tent of
Pesita. There he found a wizened, old Indian squatting at the side
of the outlaw.</p>

<p>"José," said Pesita, "has word for you."</p>

<p>Billy Byrne turned questioningly toward the Indian.</p>

<p>"I have been sent, Señor Capitan," explained José, "by the
beautiful senorita of El Orobo Rancho to tell you that your friend,
Señor Bridge, has been captured by General Villa, and is being held
at Cuivaca, where he will doubtless be shot&mdash;if help does not
reach him before tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>Pesita was looking questioningly at Byrne. Since the gringo had
returned from Cuivaca with the loot of the bank and turned the last
penny of it over to him the outlaw had looked upon his new captain
as something just short of superhuman. To have robbed the bank thus
easily while Villa's soldiers paced back and forth before the
doorway seemed little short of an indication of miraculous powers,
while to have turned the loot over intact to his chief, not asking
for so much as a peso of it, was absolutely incredible.</p>

<p>Pesita could not understand this man; but he admired him greatly
and feared him, too. Such a man was worth a hundred of the ordinary
run of humanity that enlisted beneath Pesita's banners. Byrne had
but to ask a favor to have it granted, and now, when he called upon
Pesita to furnish him with a suitable force for the rescue of
Bridge the brigand enthusiastically acceded to his demands.</p>

<p>"I will come," he exclaimed, "and all my men shall ride with me.
We will take Cuivaca by storm. We may even capture Villa himself.
We&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, bo," interrupted Billy Byrne. "Don't get
excited. I'm lookin' to get my pal outen' Cuivaca. After that I
don't care who you capture; but I'm goin' to get Bridgie out first.
I ken do it with twenty-five men&mdash;if it ain't too late. Then,
if you want to, you can shoot up the town. Lemme have the
twenty-five, an' you hang around the edges with the rest of 'em
'til I'm done. Whaddaya say?"</p>

<p>Pesita was willing to agree to anything, and so it came that
half an hour later Billy Byrne was leading a choice selection of
some two dozen cutthroats down through the hills toward Cuivaca.
While a couple of miles in the rear followed Pesita with the
balance of his band.</p>

<p>Billy rode until the few remaining lights of Cuivaca shone but a
short distance ahead and they could hear plainly the strains of a
grating gramophone from beyond the open windows of a dance hall,
and the voices of the sentries as they called the hour.</p>

<p>"Stay here," said Billy to a sergeant at his side, "until you
hear a hoot owl cry three times from the direction of the barracks
and guardhouse, then charge the opposite end of the town, firing
off your carbines like hell an' yellin' yer heads off. Make all the
racket you can, an' keep it up 'til you get 'em comin' in your
direction, see? Then turn an' drop back slowly, eggin' 'em on, but
holdin' 'em to it as long as you can. Do you get me, bo?"</p>

<p>From the mixture of Spanish and English and Granavenooish the
sergeant gleaned enough of the intent of his commander to permit
him to salute and admit that he understood what was required of
him.</p>

<p>Having given his instructions Billy Byrne rode off to the west,
circled Cuivaca and came close up upon the southern edge of the
little village. Here he dismounted and left his horse hidden behind
an outbuilding, while he crept cautiously forward to
reconnoiter.</p>

<p>He knew that the force within the village had no reason to fear
attack. Villa knew where the main bodies of his enemies lay, and
that no force could approach Cuivaca without word of its coming
reaching the garrison many hours in advance of the foe. That
Pesita, or another of the several bandit chiefs in the neighborhood
would dare descend upon a garrisoned town never for a moment
entered the calculations of the rebel leader.</p>

<p>For these reasons Billy argued that Cuivaca would be poorly
guarded. On the night he had spent there he had seen sentries
before the bank, the guardhouse, and the barracks in addition to
one who paced to and fro in front of the house in which the
commander of the garrison maintained his headquarters. Aside from
these the town was unguarded.</p>

<p>Nor were conditions different tonight. Billy came within a
hundred yards of the guardhouse before he discovered a sentinel.
The fellow lolled upon his gun in front of the building&mdash;an
adobe structure in the rear of the barracks. The other three sides
of the guardhouse appeared to be unwatched.</p>

<p>Billy threw himself upon his stomach and crawled slowly forward
stopping often. The sentry seemed asleep. He did not move. Billy
reached the shadow at the side of the structure and some fifty feet
from the soldier without detection. Then he rose to his feet
directly beneath a barred window.</p>

<p>Within Bridge paced back and forth the length of the little
building. He could not sleep. Tomorrow he was to be shot! Bridge
did not wish to die. That very morning General Villa in person had
examined him. The general had been exceedingly wroth&mdash;the
sting of the theft of his funds still irritated him; but he had
given Bridge no inkling as to his fate. It had remained for a
fellow-prisoner to do that. This man, a deserter, was to be shot,
so he said, with Bridge, a fact which gave him an additional
twenty-four hours of life, since, he asserted, General Villa wished
to be elsewhere than in Cuivaca when an American was executed. Thus
he could disclaim responsibility for the act.</p>

<p>The general was to depart in the morning. Shortly after, Bridge
and the deserter would be led out and blindfolded before a stone
wall&mdash;if there was such a thing, or a brick wall, or an adobe
wall. It made little difference to the deserter, or to Bridge
either. The wall was but a trivial factor. It might go far to add
romance to whomever should read of the affair later; but in so far
as Bridge and the deserter were concerned it meant nothing. A
billboard, thought Bridge, bearing the slogan: "Eventually! Why not
now?" would have been equally as efficacious and far more
appropriate.</p>

<p>The room in which he was confined was stuffy with the odor of
accumulated filth. Two small barred windows alone gave means of
ventilation. He and the deserter were the only prisoners. The
latter slept as soundly as though the morrow held nothing more
momentous in his destiny than any of the days that had preceded it.
Bridge was moved to kick the fellow into consciousness of his
impending fate. Instead he walked to the south window to fill his
lungs with the free air beyond his prison pen, and gaze sorrowfully
at the star-lit sky which he should never again behold.</p>

<p>In a low tone Bridge crooned a snatch of the poem that he and
Billy liked best:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"And you, my sweet Penelope, Out there somewhere you wait for me,<br>
With buds of roses in your hair and kisses on your mouth."</p>
<br>

<p>Bridge's mental vision was concentrated upon the veranda of a
white-walled ranchhouse to the east. He shook his head angrily.</p>

<p>"It's just as well," he thought. "She's not for me."</p>

<p>Something moved upon the ground beyond the window. Bridge became
suddenly intent upon the thing. He saw it rise and resolve itself
into the figure of a man, and then, in a low whisper, came a
familiar voice:</p>

<p>"There ain't no roses in my hair, but there's a barker in my
shirt, an' another at me side. Here's one of 'em. They got kisses
beat a city block. How's the door o' this thing fastened?" The
speaker was quite close to the window now, his face but a few
inches from Bridge's.</p>

<p>"Billy!" ejaculated the condemned man.</p>

<p>"Surest thing you know; but about the door?"</p>

<p>"Just a heavy bar on the outside," replied Bridge.</p>

<p>"Easy," commented Billy, relieved. "Get ready to beat it when I
open the door. I got a pony south o' town that'll have to carry
double for a little way tonight."</p>

<p>"God bless you, Billy!" whispered Bridge, fervently.</p>

<p>"Lay low a few minutes," said Billy, and moved away toward the
rear of the guardhouse.</p>

<p>A few minutes later there broke upon the night air the dismal
hoot of an owl. At intervals of a few seconds it was repeated
twice. The sentry before the guardhouse shifted his position and
looked about, then he settled back, transferring his weight to the
other foot, and resumed his bovine meditations.</p>

<p>The man at the rear of the guardhouse moved silently along the
side of the structure until he stood within a few feet of the
unsuspecting sentinel, hidden from him by the corner of the
building. A heavy revolver dangled from his right hand. He held it
loosely by the barrel, and waited.</p>

<p>For five minutes the silence of the night was unbroken, then
from the east came a single shot, followed immediately by a
scattering fusillade and a chorus of hoarse cries.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne smiled. The sentry resumed indications of quickness.
From the barracks beyond the guardhouse came sharp commands and the
sounds of men running. From the opposite end of the town the noise
of battle welled up to ominous proportions.</p>

<p>Billy heard the soldiers stream from their quarters and a moment
later saw them trot up the street at the double. Everyone was
moving toward the opposite end of the town except the lone sentinel
before the guardhouse. The moment seemed propitious for his
attempt.</p>

<p>Billy peered around the corner of the guardhouse. Conditions
were just as he had pictured they would be. The sentry stood gazing
in the direction of the firing, his back toward the guardhouse door
and Billy.</p>

<p>With a bound the American cleared the space between himself and
the unsuspecting and unfortunate soldier. The butt of the heavy
revolver fell, almost noiselessly, upon the back of the sentry's
head, and the man sank to the ground without even a moan.</p>

<p>Turning to the door Billy knocked the bar from its place, the
door swung in and Bridge slipped through to liberty.</p>

<p>"Quick!" said Billy. "Follow me," and turned at a rapid run
toward the south edge of the town. He made no effort now to conceal
his movements. Speed was the only essential, and the two covered
the ground swiftly and openly without any attempt to take advantage
of cover.</p>

<p>They reached Billy's horse unnoticed, and a moment later were
trotting toward the west to circle the town and regain the trail to
the north and safety.</p>

<p>To the east they heard the diminishing rifle fire of the
combatants as Pesita's men fell steadily back before the defenders,
and drew them away from Cuivaca in accordance with Billy's
plan.</p>

<p>"Like takin' candy from a baby," said Billy, when the flickering
lights of Cuivaca shone to the south of them, and the road ahead
lay clear to the rendezvous of the brigands.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Bridge; "but what I'd like to know, Billy, is how
you found out I was there."</p>

<p>"Penelope," said Byrne, laughing.</p>

<p>"Penelope!" queried Bridge. "I'm not at all sure that I follow
you, Billy."</p>

<p>"Well, seein' as you're sittin' on behind you can't be leadin'
me," returned Billy; "but cuttin' the kid it was a skirt tipped it
off to me where you was&mdash;the beautiful senorita of El Orobo
Rancho, I think José called her. Now are you hep?"</p>

<p>Bridge gave an exclamation of astonishment. "God bless her!" he
said. "She did that for me?"</p>

<p>"She sure did," Billy assured him, "an' I'll bet an iron case
she's a-waitin' for you there with buds o' roses in her hair an'
kisses on her mouth, you old son-of-a-gun, you." Billy laughed
happily. He was happy anyway at having rescued Bridge, and the
knowledge that his friend was in love and that the girl
reciprocated his affection&mdash;all of which Billy assumed as the
only explanation of her interest in Bridge&mdash;only added to his
joy. "She ain't a greaser is she?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"I should say not," replied Bridge. "She's a perfect queen from
New York City; but, Billy, she's not for me. What she did was
prompted by a generous heart. She couldn't care for me, Billy. Her
father is a wealthy man&mdash;she could have the pick of the
land&mdash;of many lands&mdash;if she cared to marry. You don't
think for a minute she'd want a hobo, do you?"</p>

<p>"You can't most always tell," replied Billy, a trifle sadly. "I
knew such a queen once who would have chosen a mucker, if he'd
a-let her. You're stuck on her, ol' man?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am, Billy," Bridge admitted; "but what's the use?
Let's forget it. Oh, say, is this the horse I let you take the
night you robbed the bank?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Billy; "same little pony, an' a mighty well-behaved
one, too. Why?"</p>

<p>"It's hers," said Bridge.</p>

<p>"An' she wants it back?"</p>

<p>"She didn't say so; but I'd like to get it to her some way,"
said Bridge.</p>

<p>"You ride it back when you go," suggested Billy.</p>

<p>"But I can't go back," said Bridge; "it was Grayson, the
foreman, who made it so hot for me I had to leave. He tried to
arrest me and send me to Villa."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Billy.</p>

<p>"He didn't like me, and wanted to get rid of me." Bridge
wouldn't say that his relations with Billy had brought him into
trouble.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I'll take it back myself then, and at the same time
I'll tell Penelope what a regular fellow you are, and punch in the
foreman's face for good luck."</p>

<p>"No, you mustn't go there. They know you now. It was some of El
Orobo's men you shot up day before yesterday when you took their
steers from them. They recognized the pony, and one of them had
seen you in Cuivaca the night of the robbery. They would be sure to
get you, Billy."</p>

<p>Shortly the two came in touch with the retreating Pesitistas who
were riding slowly toward their mountain camp. Their pursuers had
long since given up the chase, fearing that they might be being
lured into the midst of a greatly superior force, and had returned
to Cuivaca.</p>

<p>It was nearly morning when Bridge and Billy threw themselves
down upon the latter's blankets, fagged.</p>

<p>"Well, well," murmured Billy Byrne; "li'l ol' Bridgie's found
his Penelope," and fell asleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapb13" id="chapb13">XIII. &mdash; BARBARA AGAIN</a></h2>

<p class="first">Captain Billy Byrne rode out of the hills the
following afternoon upon a pinto pony that showed the whites of its
eyes in a wicked rim about the iris and kept its ears perpetually
flattened backward.</p>

<p>At the end of a lariat trailed the Brazos pony, for Billy,
laughing aside Bridge's pleas, was on his way to El Orobo Rancho to
return the stolen horse to its fair owner.</p>

<p>At the moment of departure Pesita had asked Billy to ride by way
of José's to instruct the old Indian that he should bear word to
one Esteban that Pesita required his presence.</p>

<p>It is a long ride from the retreat of the Pesitistas to José's
squalid hut, especially if one be leading an extra horse, and so it
was that darkness had fallen long before Billy arrived in sight of
José's. Dismounting some distance from the hut, Billy approached
cautiously, since the world is filled with dangers for those who
are beyond the law, and one may not be too careful.</p>

<p>Billy could see a light showing through a small window, and
toward this he made his way. A short distance from José's is
another, larger structure from which the former inhabitants had
fled the wrath of Pesita. It was dark and apparently tenantless;
but as a matter of fact a pair of eyes chanced at the very moment
of Billy's coming to be looking out through the open doorway.</p>

<p>The owner turned and spoke to someone behind him.</p>

<p>"José has another visitor," he said. "Possibly this one is less
harmless than the other. He comes with great caution. Let us
investigate."</p>

<p>Three other men rose from their blankets upon the floor and
joined the speaker. They were all armed, and clothed in the
nondescript uniforms of Villistas. Billy's back was toward them as
they sneaked from the hut in which they were intending to spend the
night and crept quietly toward him.</p>

<p>Billy was busily engaged in peering through the little window
into the interior of the old Indian's hovel. He saw an American in
earnest conversation with José. Who could the man be? Billy did not
recognize him; but presently José answered the question.</p>

<p>"It shall be done as you wish, Señor Grayson," he said.</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought Billy; "the foreman of El Orobo. I wonder what
business he has with this old scoundrel&mdash;and at night."</p>

<p>What other thoughts Billy might have had upon the subject were
rudely interrupted by four energetic gentlemen in his rear, who
leaped upon him simultaneously and dragged him to the ground. Billy
made no outcry; but he fought none the less strenuously for his
freedom, and he fought after the manner of Grand Avenue, which is
not a pretty, however effective, way it may be.</p>

<p>But four against one when all the advantages lie with the four
are heavy odds, and when Grayson and José ran out to investigate,
and the ranch foreman added his weight to that of the others Billy
was finally subdued. That each of his antagonists would carry
mementos of the battle for many days was slight compensation for
the loss of liberty. However, it was some.</p>

<p>After disarming their captive and tying his hands at his back
they jerked him to his feet and examined him.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Grayson. "What you doin' sneakin' 'round
spyin' on me, eh?"</p>

<p>"If you wanna know who I am, bo," replied Billy, "go ask de
Harlem Hurricane, an' as fer spyin' on youse, I wasn't; but from de
looks I guess youse need spyin, yuh tinhorn."</p>

<p>A pony whinnied a short distance from the hut.</p>

<p>"That must be his horse," said one of the Villistas, and walked
away to investigate, returning shortly after with the pinto pony
and Brazos.</p>

<p>The moment Grayson saw the latter he gave an exclamation of
understanding.</p>

<p>"I know him now," he said. "You've made a good catch, Sergeant.
This is the fellow who robbed the bank at Cuivaca. I recognize him
from the descriptions I've had of him, and the fact that he's got
the Brazos pony makes it a cinch. Villa oughter promote you for
this."</p>

<p>"Yep," interjected Billy, "he orter make youse an admiral at
least; but youse ain't got me home yet, an' it'll take more'n four
Dagos an' a tin-horn to do it."</p>

<p>"They'll get you there all right, my friend," Grayson assured
him. "Now come along."</p>

<p>They bundled Billy into his own saddle, and shortly after the
little party was winding southward along the river in the direction
of El Orobo Rancho, with the intention of putting up there for the
balance of the night where their prisoner could be properly secured
and guarded. As they rode away from the dilapidated hut of the
Indian the old man stood silhouetted against the rectangle of dim
light which marked the open doorway, and shook his fist at the back
of the departing ranch foreman.</p>

<p>"<i>El cochino</i>!" he cackled, and turned back into his
hut.</p>

<p><br>
AT El Orobo Rancho Barbara walked to and fro outside the
ranchhouse. Within her father sat reading beneath the rays of an
oil lamp. From the quarters of the men came the strains of guitar
music, and an occasional loud laugh indicated the climax of some of
Eddie Shorter's famous Kansas farmer stories.</p>

<p>Barbara was upon the point of returning indoors when her
attention was attracted by the approach of a half-dozen horsemen.
They reined into the ranchyard and dismounted before the office
building. Wondering a little who came so late, Barbara entered the
house, mentioning casually to her father that which she had just
seen.</p>

<p>The ranch owner, now always fearful of attack, was upon the
point of investigating when Grayson rode up to the veranda and
dismounted. Barbara and her father were at the door as he ascended
the steps.</p>

<p>"Good news!" exclaimed the foreman. "I've got the bank robber,
and Brazos, too. Caught the sneakin' coyote up to&mdash;up the
river a bit." He had almost said "José's;" but caught himself in
time. "Someone's been cuttin' the wire at the north side of the
north pasture, an' I was ridin' up to see ef I could catch 'em at
it," he explained.</p>

<p>"He is an American?" asked the boss.</p>

<p>"Looks like it; but he's got the heart of a greaser," replied
Grayson. "Some of Villa's men are with me, and they're a-goin' to
take him to Cuivaca tomorrow."</p>

<p>Neither Barbara nor her father seemed to enthuse much. To them
an American was an American here in Mexico, where every hand was
against their race. That at home they might have looked with
disgust upon this same man did not alter their attitude here, that
no American should take sides against his own people. Barbara said
as much to Grayson.</p>

<p>"Why this fellow's one of Pesita's officers," exclaimed Grayson.
"He don't deserve no sympathy from us nor from no other Americans.
Pesita has sworn to kill every American that falls into his hands,
and this fellow's with him to help him do it. He's a bad un."</p>

<p>"I can't help what he may do," insisted Barbara. "He's an
American, and I for one would never be a party to his death at the
hands of a Mexican, and it will mean death to him to be taken to
Cuivaca."</p>

<p>"Well, miss," said Grayson, "you won't hev to be
responsible&mdash;I'll take all the responsibility there is and
welcome. I just thought you'd like to know we had him." He was
addressing his employer. The latter nodded, and Grayson turned and
left the room. Outside he cast a sneering laugh back over his
shoulder and swung into his saddle.</p>

<p>In front of the men's quarters he drew rein again and shouted
Eddie's name. Shorter came to the door.</p>

<p>"Get your six-shooter an' a rifle, an' come on over to the
office. I want to see you a minute."</p>

<p>Eddie did as he was bid, and when he entered the little room he
saw four Mexicans lolling about smoking cigarettes while Grayson
stood before a chair in which sat a man with his arms tied behind
his back. Grayson turned to Eddie.</p>

<p>"This party here is the slick un that robbed the bank, and got
away on thet there Brazos pony thet miserable bookkeepin' dude giv
him. The sergeant here an' his men are a-goin' to take him to
Cuivaca in the mornin'. You stand guard over him 'til midnight,
then they'll relieve you. They gotta get a little sleep first,
though, an' I gotta get some supper. Don't stand fer no funny
business now, Eddie," Grayson admonished him, and was on the point
of leaving the office when a thought occurred to him. "Say,
Shorter," he said, "they ain't no way of gettin' out of the little
bedroom in back there except through this room. The windows are too
small fer a big man to get through. I'll tell you what, we'll lock
him up in there an' then you won't hev to worry none an' neither
will we. You can jest spread out them Navajos there and go to sleep
right plump ag'in the door, an' there won't nobody hev to relieve
you all night."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Eddie, "leave it to me&mdash;I'll watch the
slicker."</p>

<p>Satisfied that their prisoner was safe for the night the
Villistas and Grayson departed, after seeing him safely locked in
the back room.</p>

<p>At the mention by the foreman of his guard's names&mdash;Eddie
and Shorter&mdash;Billy had studied the face of the young American
cowpuncher, for the two names had aroused within his memory a
tantalizing suggestion that they should be very familiar. Yet he
could connect them in no way with anyone he had known in the past
and he was quite sure that he never before had set eyes upon this
man.</p>

<p>Sitting in the dark with nothing to occupy him Billy let his
mind dwell upon the identity of his jailer, until, as may have
happened to you, nothing in the whole world seemed equally as
important as the solution of the mystery. Even his impending fate
faded into nothingness by comparison with the momentous question as
to where he had heard the name Eddie Shorter before.</p>

<p>As he sat puzzling his brain over the inconsequential matter
something stirred upon the floor close to his feet, and presently
he jerked back a booted foot that a rat had commenced to gnaw
upon.</p>

<p>"Helluva place to stick a guy," mused Billy, "in wit a bunch o'
man-eatin' rats. Hey!" and he turned his face toward the door.
"You, Eddie! Come here!"</p>

<p>Eddie approached the door and listened.</p>

<p>"Wot do you want?" he asked. "None o' your funny business, you
know. I'm from Shawnee, Kansas, I am, an' they don't come no
slicker from nowhere on earth. You can't fool me."</p>

<p>Shawnee, Kansas! Eddie Shorter! The whole puzzle was cleared in
Billy's mind in an instant.</p>

<p>"So you're Eddie Shorter of Shawnee, Kansas, are you?" called
Billy. "Well I know your maw, Eddie, an' ef I had such a maw as you
got I wouldn't be down here wastin' my time workin' alongside a lot
of Dagos; but that ain't what I started out to say, which was that
I want a light in here. The damned rats are tryin' to chaw off me
kicks an' when they're done wit them they'll climb up after me an'
old man Villa'll be sore as a pup."</p>

<p>"You know my maw?" asked Eddie, and there was a wistful note in
his voice. "Aw shucks! you don't know her&mdash;that's jest some o'
your funny, slicker business. You wanna git me in there an' then
you'll try an' git aroun' me some sort o' way to let you escape;
but I'm too slick for that."</p>

<p>"On the level Eddie, I know your maw," persisted Billy. "I ben
in your maw's house jest a few weeks ago. 'Member the horsehair
sofa between the windows? 'Member the Bible on the little
marble-topped table? Eh? An' Tige? Well, Tige's croaked; but your
maw an' your paw ain't an' they want you back, Eddie. I don't care
ef you believe me, son, or not; but your maw was mighty good to me,
an' you promise me you'll write her an' then go back home as fast
as you can. It ain't everybody's got a swell maw like that, an'
them as has ought to be good to 'em."</p>

<p>Beyond the closed door Eddie's jaw was commencing to tremble.
Memory was flooding his heart and his eyes with sweet recollections
of an ample breast where he used to pillow his head, of a big
capable hand that was wont to smooth his brow and stroke back his
red hair. Eddie gulped.</p>

<p>"You ain't joshin' me?" he asked. Billy Byrne caught the tremor
in the voice.</p>

<p>"I ain't kiddin' you son," he said. "Wotinell do you take me
fer&mdash;one o' these greasy Dagos? You an' I're Americans&mdash;I
wouldn't string a home guy down here in this here Godforsaken neck
o' the woods."</p>

<p>Billy heard the lock turn, and a moment later the door was
cautiously opened revealing Eddie safely ensconced behind two
six-shooters.</p>

<p>"That's right, Eddie," said Billy, with a laugh. "Don't you take
no chances, no matter how much sob stuff I hand you, fer, I'll give
it to you straight, ef I get the chanct I'll make my get-away; but
I can't do it wit my flippers trussed, an' you wit a brace of gats
sittin' on me. Let's have a light, Eddie. That won't do nobody any
harm, an' it may discourage the rats."</p>

<p>Eddie backed across the office to a table where stood a small
lamp. Keeping an eye through the door on his prisoner he lighted
the lamp and carried it into the back room, setting it upon a
commode which stood in one corner.</p>

<p>"You really seen maw?" he asked. "Is she well?"</p>

<p>"Looked well when I seen her," said Billy; "but she wants her
boy back a whole lot. I guess she'd look better still ef he walked
in on her some day."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," cried Eddie. "The minute they get money for the
pay I'll hike. Tell me your name. I'll ask her ef she remembers you
when I get home. Gee! but I wish I was walkin' in the front door
now."</p>

<p>"She never knew my name," said Billy; "but you tell her you seen
the bo that mussed up the two yeggmen who rolled her an' were
tryin' to croak her wit a butcher knife. I guess she ain't fergot.
Me an' my pal were beatin' it&mdash;he was on the square but the
dicks was after me an' she let us have money to make our get-away.
She's all right, kid."</p>

<p>There came a knock at the outer office door. Eddie sprang back
into the front room, closing and locking the door after him, just
as Barbara entered.</p>

<p>"Eddie," she asked, "may I see the prisoner? I want to talk to
him."</p>

<p>"You want to talk with a bank robber?" exclaimed Eddie. "Why you
ain't crazy are you, Miss Barbara?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not crazy; but I want to speak with him alone for just
a moment, Eddie&mdash;please."</p>

<p>Eddie hesitated. He knew that Grayson would be angry if he let
the boss's daughter into that back room alone with an outlaw and a
robber, and the boss himself would probably be inclined to have
Eddie drawn and quartered; but it was hard to refuse Miss Barbara
anything.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" she asked.</p>

<p>Eddie jerked a thumb in the direction of the door. The key still
was in the lock.</p>

<p>"Go to the window and look at the moon, Eddie," suggested the
girl. "It's perfectly gorgeous tonight. Please, Eddie," as he still
hesitated.</p>

<p>Eddie shook his head and moved slowly toward the window.</p>

<p>"There can't nobody refuse you nothin', miss," he said;
"'specially when you got your heart set on it."</p>

<p>"That's a dear, Eddie," purred the girl, and moved swiftly
across the room to the locked door.</p>

<p>As she turned the key in the lock she felt a little shiver of
nervous excitement run through her. "What sort of man would he
be&mdash;this hardened outlaw and robber&mdash;this renegade
American who had cast his lot with the avowed enemies of his own
people?" she wondered.</p>

<p>Only her desire to learn of Bridge's fate urged her to attempt
so distasteful an interview; but she dared not ask another to put
the question for her, since should her complicity in Bridge's
escape&mdash;provided of course that he had escaped&mdash;become
known to Villa the fate of the Americans at El Orobo would be
definitely sealed.</p>

<p>She turned the knob and pushed the door open, slowly. A man was
sitting in a chair in the center of the room. His back was toward
her. He was a big man. His broad shoulders loomed immense above the
back of the rude chair. A shock of black hair, rumpled and tousled,
covered a well-shaped head.</p>

<p>At the sound of the door creaking upon its hinges he turned his
face in her direction, and as his eyes met hers all four went wide
in surprise and incredulity.</p>

<p>"Billy!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Barbara!&mdash;you?" and Billy rose to his feet, his bound
hands struggling to be free.</p>

<p>The girl closed the door behind her and crossed to him.</p>

<p>"You robbed the bank, Billy?" she asked. "It was you, after the
promises you made me to live straight always&mdash;for my sake?"
Her voice trembled with emotion. The man could see that she
suffered, and yet he felt his own anguish, too.</p>

<p>"But you are married," he said. "I saw it in the papers. What do
you care, now, Barbara? I'm nothing to you."</p>

<p>"I'm not married, Billy," she cried. "I couldn't marry Mr.
Mallory. I tried to make myself believe that I could; but at last I
knew that I did not love him and never could, and I wouldn't marry
a man I didn't love.</p>

<p>"I never dreamed that it was you here, Billy," she went on. "I
came to ask you about Mr. Bridge. I wanted to know if he escaped,
or if&mdash;if&mdash;oh, this awful country! They think no more of
human life here than a butcher thinks of the life of the animal he
dresses."</p>

<p>A sudden light illumined Billy's mind. Why had it not occurred
to him before? This was Bridge's Penelope! The woman he loved was
loved by his best friend. And she had sent a messenger to him, to
Billy, to save her lover. She had come here to the office tonight
to question a stranger&mdash;a man she thought an outlaw and a
robber&mdash;because she could not rest without word from the man
she loved. Billy stiffened. He was hurt to the bottom of his heart;
but he did not blame Bridge&mdash;it was fate. Nor did he blame
Barbara because she loved Bridge. Bridge was more her kind anyway.
He was a college guy. Billy was only a mucker.</p>

<p>"Bridge got away all right," he said. "And say, he didn't have
nothin' to do with pullin' off that safe crackin'. I done it
myself. He didn't know I was in town an' I didn't know he was
there. He's the squarest guy in the world, Bridge is. He follered
me that night an' took a shot at me, thinkin' I was the robber all
right but not knowin' I was me. He got my horse, an' when he found
it was me, he made me take your pony an' make my get-away, fer he
knew Villa's men would croak me sure if they caught me. You can't
blame him fer that, can you? Him an' I were good pals&mdash;he
couldn't do nothin' else. It was him that made me bring your pony
back to you. It's in the corral now, I reckon. I was a-bringin' it
back when they got me. Now you better go. This ain't no place fer
you, an' I ain't had no sleep fer so long I'm most dead." His tones
were cool. He appeared bored by her company; though as a matter of
fact his heart was breaking with love for her&mdash;love that he
believed unrequited&mdash;and he yearned to tear loose his bonds
and crush her in his arms.</p>

<p>It was Barbara's turn now to be hurt. She drew herself up.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that I have disturbed your rest," she said, and
walked away, her head in the air; but all the way back to the
ranchhouse she kept repeating over and over to herself: "Tomorrow
they will shoot him! Tomorrow they will shoot him! Tomorrow they
will shoot him!"</p>

<h2><a name="chapb14" id="chapb14">XIV. &mdash; 'TWIXT LOVE AND
DUTY</a></h2>

<p class="first">For an hour Barbara Harding paced the veranda of
the ranchhouse, pride and love battling for the ascendency within
her breast. She could not let him die, that she knew; but how might
she save him?</p>

<p>The strains of music and the laughter from the bunkhouse had
ceased. The ranch slept. Over the brow of the low bluff upon the
opposite side of the river a little party of silent horsemen filed
downward to the ford. At the bluff's foot a barbed-wire fence
marked the eastern boundary of the ranch's enclosed fields. The
foremost horseman dismounted and cut the strands of wire, carrying
them to one side from the path of the feet of the horses which now
passed through the opening he had made.</p>

<p>Down into the river they rode following the ford even in the
darkness with an assurance which indicated long familiarity. Then
through a fringe of willows out across a meadow toward the ranch
buildings the riders made their way. The manner of their approach,
their utter silence, the hour, all contributed toward the
sinister.</p>

<p>Upon the veranda of the ranchhouse Barbara Harding came to a
sudden halt. Her entire manner indicated final decision, and
determination. A moment she stood in thought and then ran quickly
down the steps and in the direction of the office. Here she found
Eddie dozing at his post. She did not disturb him. A glance through
the window satisfied her that he was alone with the prisoner. From
the office building Barbara passed on to the corral. A few horses
stood within the enclosure, their heads drooping dejectedly. As she
entered they raised their muzzles and sniffed suspiciously, ears
a-cock, and as the girl approached closer to them they moved warily
away, snorting, and passed around her to the opposite side of the
corral. As they moved by her she scrutinized them and her heart
dropped, for Brazos was not among them. He must have been turned
out into the pasture.</p>

<p>She passed over to the bars that closed the opening from the
corral into the pasture and wormed her way between two of them. A
hackamore with a piece of halter rope attached to it hung across
the upper bar. Taking it down she moved off across the pasture in
the direction the saddle horses most often took when liberated from
the corral.</p>

<p>If they had not crossed the river she felt that she might find
and catch Brazos, for lumps of sugar and bits of bread had inspired
in his equine soul a wondrous attachment for his temporary
mistress.</p>

<p>Down the beaten trail the animals had made to the river the girl
hurried, her eyes penetrating the darkness ahead and to either hand
for the looming bulks that would be the horses she sought, and
among which she might hope to discover the gentle little
Brazos.</p>

<p>The nearer she came to the river the lower dropped her spirits,
for as yet no sign of the animals was to be seen. To have attempted
to place a hackamore upon any of the wild creatures in the corral
would have been the height of foolishness&mdash;only a well-sped
<i>riata</i> in the hands of a strong man could have captured one
of these.</p>

<p>Closer and closer to the fringe of willows along the river she
came, until, at their very edge, there broke upon her already taut
nerves the hideous and uncanny scream of a wildcat. The girl
stopped short in her tracks. She felt the chill of fear creep
through her skin, and a twitching at the roots of her hair
evidenced to her the extremity of her terror. Should she turn back?
The horses might be between her and the river, but judgment told
her that they had crossed. Should she brave the nervous fright of a
passage through that dark, forbidding labyrinth of gloom when she
knew that she should not find the horses within reach beyond?</p>

<p>She turned to retrace her steps. She must find another way! But
was there another way? And "Tomorrow they will shoot him!" She
shuddered, bit her lower lip in an effort to command her courage,
and then, wheeling, plunged into the thicket.</p>

<p>Again the cat screamed&mdash;close by&mdash;but the girl never
hesitated in her advance, and a few moments later she broke through
the willows a dozen paces from the river bank. Her eyes strained
through the night; but no horses were to be seen.</p>

<p>The trail, cut by the hoofs of many animals, ran deep and
straight down into the swirling water. Upon the opposite side
Brazos must be feeding or resting, just beyond reach.</p>

<p>Barbara dug her nails into her palms in the bitterness of her
disappointment. She followed down to the very edge of the water. It
was black and forbidding. Even in the daytime she would not have
been confident of following the ford&mdash;by night it would be
madness to attempt it.</p>

<p>She choked down a sob. Her shoulders drooped. Her head bent
forward. She was the picture of disappointment and despair.</p>

<p>"What can I do?" she moaned. "Tomorrow they will shoot him!"</p>

<p>The thought seemed to electrify her.</p>

<p>"They shall not shoot him!" she cried aloud. "They shall not
shoot him while I live to prevent it!"</p>

<p>Again her head was up and her shoulders squared. Tying the
hackamore about her waist, she took a single deep breath of
reassurance and stepped out into the river. For a dozen paces she
found no difficulty in following the ford. It was broad and
straight; but toward the center of the river, as she felt her way
along a step at a time, she came to a place where directly before
her the ledge upon which she crossed shelved off into deep water.
She turned upward, trying to locate the direction of the new turn;
but here too there was no footing. Down river she felt solid rock
beneath her feet. Ah! this was the way, and boldly she stepped out,
the water already above her knees. Two, three steps she took, and
with each one her confidence and hope arose, and then the fourth
step&mdash;and there was no footing. She felt herself lunging into
the stream, and tried to draw back and regain the ledge; but the
force of the current was too much for her, and, so suddenly it
seemed that she had thrown herself in, she was in the channel
swimming for her life.</p>

<p>The trend of the current there was back in the direction of the
bank she had but just quitted, yet so strong was her determination
to succeed for Billy Byrne's sake that she turned her face toward
the opposite shore and fought to reach the seemingly impossible
goal which love had set for her. Again and again she was swept
under by the force of the current. Again and again she rose and
battled, not for her own life; but for the life of the man she once
had loathed and whom she later had come to love. Inch by inch she
won toward the shore of her desire, and inch by inch of her
progress she felt her strength failing. Could she win? Ah! if she
were but a man, and with the thought came another: Thank God that I
am a woman with a woman's love which gives strength to drive me
into the clutches of death for his sake!</p>

<p>Her heart thundered in tumultuous protest against the strain of
her panting lungs. Her limbs felt cold and numb; but she could not
give up even though she was now convinced that she had thrown her
life away uselessly. They would find her body; but no one would
ever guess what had driven her to her death. Not even <i>he</i>
would know that it was for his sake. And then she felt the tugging
of the channel current suddenly lessen, an eddy carried her gently
inshore, her feet touched the sand and gravel of the bottom.</p>

<p>Gasping for breath, staggering, stumbling, she reeled on a few
paces and then slipped down clutching at the river's bank. Here the
water was shallow, and here she lay until her strength returned.
Then she urged herself up and onward, climbed to the top of the
bank with success at last within reach.</p>

<p>To find the horses now required but a few minutes' search. They
stood huddled in a black mass close to the barbed-wire fence at the
extremity of the pasture. As she approached them they commenced to
separate slowly, edging away while they faced her in curiosity.
Softly she called: "Brazos! Come, Brazos!" until a unit of the
moving mass detached itself and came toward her, nickering.</p>

<p>"Good Brazos!" she cooed. "That's a good pony," and walked
forward to meet him.</p>

<p>The animal let her reach up and stroke his forehead, while he
muzzled about her for the expected tidbit. Gently she worked the
hackamore over his nose and above his ears, and when it was safely
in place she breathed a deep sigh of relief and throwing her arms
about his neck pressed her cheek to his.</p>

<p>"You dear old Brazos," she whispered.</p>

<p>The horse stood quietly while the girl wriggled herself to his
back, and then at a word and a touch from her heels moved off at a
walk in the direction of the ford. The crossing this time was one
of infinite ease, for Barbara let the rope lie loose and Brazos
take his own way.</p>

<p>Through the willows upon the opposite bank he shouldered his
path, across the meadow still at a walk, lest they arouse
attention, and through a gate which led directly from the meadow
into the ranchyard. Here she tied him to the outside of the corral,
while she went in search of saddle and bridle. Whose she took she
did not know, nor care, but that the saddle was enormously heavy
she was perfectly aware long before she had dragged it halfway to
where Brazos stood.</p>

<p>Three times she essayed to lift it to his back before she
succeeded in accomplishing the Herculean task, and had it been any
other horse upon the ranch than Brazos the thing could never have
been done; but the kindly little pony stood in statuesque
resignation while the heavy Mexican tree was banged and thumped
against his legs and ribs, until a lucky swing carried it to his
withers.</p>

<p>Saddled and bridled Barbara led him to the rear of the building
and thus, by a roundabout way, to the back of the office building.
Here she could see a light in the room in which Billy was confined,
and after dropping the bridle reins to the ground she made her way
to the front of the structure.</p>

<p>Creeping stealthily to the porch she peered in at the window.
Eddie was stretched out in cramped though seeming luxury in an
office chair. His feet were cocked up on the desk before him. In
his lap lay his six-shooter ready for any emergency. Another
reposed in its holster at his belt.</p>

<p>Barbara tiptoed to the door. Holding her breath she turned the
knob gently. The door swung open without a sound, and an instant
later she stood within the room. Again her eyes were fixed upon
Eddie Shorter. She saw his nerveless fingers relax their hold upon
the grip of his revolver. She saw the weapon slip farther down into
his lap. He did not move, other than to the deep and regular
breathing of profound slumber.</p>

<p>Barbara crossed the room to his side.</p>

<p>Behind the ranchhouse three figures crept forward in the
shadows. Behind them a matter of a hundred yards stood a little
clump of horses and with them were the figures of more men. These
waited in silence. The other three crept toward the house. It was
such a ranchhouse as you might find by the scores or hundreds
throughout Texas. Grayson, evidently, or some other Texan, had
designed it. There was nothing Mexican about it, nor anything
beautiful. It stood two storied, verandaed and hideous, a blot upon
the soil of picturesque Mexico.</p>

<p>To the roof of the veranda clambered the three prowlers, and
across it to an open window. The window belonged to the bedroom of
Miss Barbara Harding. Here they paused and listened, then two of
them entered the room. They were gone for but a few minutes. When
they emerged they showed evidences, by their gestures to the third
man who had awaited outside, of disgust and disappointment.</p>

<p>Cautiously they descended as they had come and made their way
back to those other men who had remained with the horses. Here
there ensued a low-toned conference, and while it progressed
Barbara Harding reached forth a steady hand which belied the terror
in her soul and plucked the revolver from Eddie Shorter's lap.
Eddie slept on.</p>

<p>Again on tiptoe the girl recrossed the office to the locked door
leading into the back room. The key was in the lock. Gingerly she
turned it, keeping a furtive eye upon the sleeping guard, and the
muzzle of his own revolver leveled menacingly upon him. Eddie
Shorter stirred in his sleep and raised a hand to his face. The
heart of Barbara Harding ceased to beat while she stood waiting for
the man to open his eyes and discover her; but he did nothing of
the kind. Instead his hand dropped limply at his side and he
resumed his regular breathing.</p>

<p>The key turned in the lock beneath the gentle pressure of her
fingers, the bolt slipped quietly back and she pushed the door
ajar. Within, Billy Byrne turned inquiring eyes in the direction of
the opening door, and as he saw who it was who entered surprise
showed upon his face; but he spoke no word for the girl held a
silencing finger to her lips.</p>

<p>Quickly she came to his side and motioned him to rise while she
tugged at the knots which held the bonds in place about his arms.
Once she stopped long enough to recross the room and close the door
which she had left open when she entered.</p>

<p>It required fully five minutes&mdash;the longest five minutes of
Barbara Harding's life, she thought&mdash;before the knots gave to
her efforts; but at last the rope fell to the floor and Billy Byrne
was free.</p>

<p>He started to speak, to thank her, and, perhaps, to scold her
for the rash thing she had undertaken for him; but she silenced him
again, and with a whispered, "Come!" turned toward the door.</p>

<p>As she opened it a crack to reconnoiter she kept the revolver
pointed straight ahead of her into the adjoining room. Eddie,
however, still slept on in peaceful ignorance of the trick which
was being played upon him.</p>

<p>Now the two started forward for the door which opened from the
office upon the porch, and as they did so Barbara turned again
toward Billy to caution him to silence for his spurs had tinkled as
he moved. For a moment their eyes were not upon Eddie Shorter and
Fate had it that at that very moment Eddie awoke and opened his own
eyes.</p>

<p>The sight that met them was so astonishing that for a second the
Kansan could not move. He saw Barbara Harding, a revolver in her
hand, aiding the outlaw to escape, and in the instant that surprise
kept him motionless Eddie saw, too, another picture&mdash;the
picture of a motherly woman in a little farmhouse back in Kansas,
and Eddie realized that this man, this outlaw, had been the means
of arousing within him a desire and a determination to return again
to those loving arms. Too, the man had saved his mother from
injury, and possible death.</p>

<p>Eddie shut his eyes quickly and thought hard and fast. Miss
Barbara had always been kind to him. In his boyish heart he had
loved her, hopelessly of course, in a boyish way. She wanted the
outlaw to escape. Eddie realized that he would do anything that
Miss Barbara wanted, even if he had to risk his life at it.</p>

<p>The girl and the man were at the door. She pushed him through
ahead of her while she kept the revolver leveled upon Eddie, then
she passed out after him and closed the door, while Eddie Shorter
kept his eyes tightly closed and prayed to his God that Billy Byrne
might get safely away.</p>

<p>Outside and in the rear of the office building Barbara pressed
the revolver upon Billy.</p>

<p>"You will need it," she said. "There is Brazos&mdash;take him.
God bless and guard you, Billy!" and she was gone.</p>

<p>Billy swallowed hard. He wanted to run after her and take her in
his arms; but he recalled Bridge, and with a sigh turned toward the
patient Brazos. Languidly he gathered up the reins and mounted, and
then unconcernedly as though he were an honored guest departing by
daylight he rode out of the ranchyard and turned Brazos' head north
up the river road.</p>

<p>And as Billy disappeared in the darkness toward the north
Barbara Harding walked slowly toward the ranchhouse, while from a
little group of men and horses a hundred yards away three men
detached themselves and crept toward her, for they had seen her in
the moonlight as she left Billy outside the office and strolled
slowly in the direction of the house.</p>

<p>They hid in the shadow at the side of the house until the girl
had turned the corner and was approaching the veranda, then they
ran quickly forward and as she mounted the steps she was seized
from behind and dragged backward. A hand was clapped over her mouth
and a whispered threat warned her to silence.</p>

<p>Half dragging and half carrying her the three men bore her back
to where their confederates awaited them. A huge fellow mounted his
pony and Barbara was lifted to the horn of the saddle before him.
Then the others mounted and as silently as they had come they rode
away, following the same path.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding had not cried out nor attempted to, for she had
seen very shortly after her capture that she was in the hands of
Indians and she judged from what she had heard of the little band
of Pimans who held forth in the mountains to the east that they
would as gladly knife her as not.</p>

<p>José was a Piman, and she immediately connected José with the
perpetration, or at least the planning of her abduction. Thus she
felt assured that no harm would come to her, since José had been
famous in his time for the number and size of the ransoms he had
collected.</p>

<p>Her father would pay what was demanded, she would be returned
and, aside from a few days of discomfort and hardship, she would be
none the worse off for her experience. Reasoning thus it was not
difficult to maintain her composure and presence of mind.</p>

<p>As Barbara was borne toward the east, Billy Byrne rode steadily
northward. It was his intention to stop at José's hut and deliver
the message which Pesita had given him for the old Indian. Then he
would disappear into the mountains to the west, join Pesita and
urge a new raid upon some favored friend of General Francisco
Villa, for Billy had no love for Villa.</p>

<p>He should have been glad to pay his respects to El Orobo Rancho
and its foreman; but the fact that Anthony Harding owned it and
that he and Barbara were there was sufficient effectually to banish
all thoughts of revenge along that line.</p>

<p>"Maybe I can get his goat later," he thought, "when he's away
from the ranch. I don't like that stiff, anyhow. He orter been a
harness bull."</p>

<p><br>
IT was four o'clock in the morning when Billy dismounted in
front of José's hut. He pounded on the door until the man came and
opened it.</p>

<p>"Eh!" exclaimed José as he saw who his early morning visitor
was, "you got away from them. Fine!" and the old man chuckled. "I
send word to Pesita two, four hours ago that Villistas capture
Capitan Byrne and take him to Cuivaca."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Billy. "Pesita wants you to send Esteban to him.
I didn't have no chance to tell you last night while them pikers
was stickin' aroun', so I stops now on my way back to the
hills."</p>

<p>"I will send Esteban tonight if I can get him; but I do not
know. Esteban is working for the pig, Grayson."</p>

<p>"Wot's he doin' fer Grayson?" asked Billy. "And what was the
Grayson guy doin' up here with you, José? Ain't you gettin' pretty
thick with Pesita's enemies?"</p>

<p>"José good friends everybody," and the old man grinned. "Grayson
have a job he want good men for. José furnish men. Grayson pay
well. Job got nothin' do Pesita, Villa, Carranza,
revolution&mdash;just private job. Grayson want senorita. He pay to
get her. That all."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Billy, and yawned. He was not interested in Mr.
Grayson's amours. "Why didn't the poor boob go get her himself?" he
inquired disinterestedly. "He must be a yap to hire a bunch o' guys
to go cop off a siwash girl fer him."</p>

<p>"It is not a siwash girl, Señor Capitan," said José. "It is one
beautiful senorita&mdash;the daughter of the owner of El Orobo
Rancho."</p>

<p>"What?" cried Billy Byrne. "What's that you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Señor Capitan, what of it?" inquired José. "Grayson he pay
me furnish the men. Esteban he go with his warriors. I get Esteban.
They go tonight take away the senorita; but not for Grayson," and
the old fellow laughed. "I can no help can I? Grayson pay me money
get men. I get them. I no help if they keep girl," and he
shrugged.</p>

<p>"They're comin' for her tonight?" cried Billy.</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>," replied José. "Doubtless they already take
her."</p>

<p>"Hell!" muttered Billy Byrne, as he swung Brazos about so
quickly that the little pony pivoted upon his hind legs and dashed
away toward the south over the same trail he had just
traversed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapb15" id="chapb15">XV. &mdash; AN INDIAN'S
TREACHERY</a></h2>

<p class="first">The Brazos pony had traveled far that day but for
only a trifle over ten miles had he carried a rider upon his back.
He was, consequently, far from fagged as he leaped forward to the
lifted reins and tore along the dusty river trail back in the
direction of Orobo.</p>

<p>Never before had Brazos covered ten miles in so short a time,
for it was not yet five o'clock when, reeling with fatigue, he
stopped, staggered and fell in front of the office building at El
Orobo.</p>

<p>Eddie Shorter had sat in the chair as Barbara and Billy had last
seen him waiting until Byrne should have an ample start before
arousing Grayson and reporting the prisoner's escape. Eddie had
determined that he would give Billy an hour. He grinned as he
anticipated the rage of Grayson and the Villistas when they learned
that their bird had flown, and as he mused and waited he fell
asleep.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight when Eddie awoke, and as he looked up at
the little clock ticking against the wall, and saw the time he gave
an exclamation of surprise and leaped to his feet. Just as he
opened the outer door of the office he saw a horseman leap from a
winded pony in front of the building. He saw the animal collapse
and sink to the ground, and then he recognized the pony as Brazos,
and another glance at the man brought recognition of him, too.</p>

<p>"You?" cried Eddie. "What are you doin' back here? I gotta take
you now," and he started to draw his revolver; but Billy Byrne had
him covered before ever his hand reached the grip of his gun.</p>

<p>"Put 'em up!" admonished Billy, "and listen to me. This ain't no
time fer gunplay or no such foolishness. I ain't back here to be
took&mdash;get that out o' your nut. I'm tipped off that a bunch o'
siwashes was down here last night to swipe Miss Harding. Come! We
gotta go see if she's here or not, an' don't try any funny business
on me, Eddie. I ain't a-goin' to be taken again, an' whoever tries
it gets his, see?"</p>

<p>Eddie was down off the porch in an instant, and making for the
ranchhouse.</p>

<p>"I'm with you," he said. "Who told you? And who done it?"</p>

<p>"Never mind who told me; but a siwash named Esteban was to pull
the thing off for Grayson. Grayson wanted Miss Harding an' he was
goin' to have her stolen for him."</p>

<p>"The hound!" muttered Eddie.</p>

<p>The two men dashed up onto the veranda of the ranchhouse and
pounded at the door until a Chinaman opened it and stuck out his
head, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Harding here?" demanded Billy.</p>

<p>"Mlissy Hardie Kleep," snapped the servant. "Wally wanee here
flo blekfas?" and would have shut the door in their faces had not
Billy intruded a heavy boot. The next instant he placed a large
palm over the celestial's face and pushed the man back into the
house. Once inside he called Mr. Harding's name aloud.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the gentleman a moment later as he appeared
in a bedroom doorway off the living-room clad in his pajamas.
"What's the matter? Why, gad man, is that you? Is this really Billy
Byrne?"</p>

<p>"Sure," replied Byrne shortly; "but we can't waste any time
chinnin'. I heard that Miss Barbara was goin' to be swiped last
night&mdash;I heard that she had been. Now hurry and see if she is
here."</p>

<p>Anthony Harding turned and leaped up the narrow stairway to the
second floor four steps at a time. He hadn't gone upstairs in that
fashion in forty years. Without even pausing to rap he burst into
his daughter's bedroom. It was empty. The bed was unruffled. It had
not been slept in. With a moan the man turned back and ran hastily
to the other rooms upon the second floor&mdash;Barbara was nowhere
to be found. Then he hastened downstairs to the two men awaiting
him.</p>

<p>As he entered the room from one end Grayson entered it from the
other through the doorway leading out upon the veranda. Billy Byrne
had heard footsteps upon the boards without and he was ready, so
that as Grayson entered he found himself looking straight at the
business end of a sixshooter. The foreman halted, and stood looking
in surprise first at Billy Byrne, and then at Eddie Shorter and Mr.
Harding.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he demanded, addressing Eddie. "What you
doin' here with your prisoner? Who told you to let him out,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Can the chatter," growled Billy Byrne. "Shorter didn't let me
out. I escaped hours ago, and I've just come back from José's to
ask you where Miss Harding is, you low-lived cur, you. Where is
she?"</p>

<p>"What has Mr. Grayson to do with it?" asked Mr. Harding. "How
should he know anything about it? It's all a mystery to
me&mdash;you here, of all men in the world, and Grayson talking
about you as the prisoner. I can't make it out. Quick, though,
Byrne, tell me all you know about Barbara."</p>

<p>Billy kept Grayson covered as he replied to the request of
Harding.</p>

<p>"This guy hires a bunch of Pimans to steal Miss Barbara," he
said. "I got it straight from the fellow he paid the money to for
gettin' him the right men to pull off the job. He wants her it
seems," and Billy shot a look at the ranch foreman that would have
killed if looks could. "She can't have been gone long. I seen her
after midnight, just before I made my getaway, so they can't have
taken her very far. This thing here can't help us none neither, for
he don't know where she is any more'n we do. He thinks he does; but
he don't. The siwashes framed it on him, an' they've
doubled-crossed him. I got that straight too; but, Gawd! I don't
know where they've taken her or what they're goin' to do with
her."</p>

<p>As he spoke he turned his eyes for the first time away from
Grayson and looked full in Anthony Harding's face. The latter saw
beneath the strong character lines of the other's countenance the
agony of fear and doubt that lay heavy upon his heart.</p>

<p>In the brief instant that Billy's watchful gaze left the figure
of the ranch foreman the latter saw the opportunity he craved. He
was standing directly in the doorway&mdash;a single step would
carry him out of range of Byrne's gun, placing a wall between it
and him, and Grayson was not slow in taking that step.</p>

<p>When Billy turned his eyes back the Texan had disappeared, and
by the time the former reached the doorway Grayson was halfway to
the office building on the veranda of which stood the four soldiers
of Villa grumbling and muttering over the absence of their prisoner
of the previous evening.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne stepped out into the open. The ranch foreman called
aloud to the four Mexicans that their prisoner was at the
ranchhouse and as they looked in that direction they saw him,
revolver in hand, coming slowly toward them. There was a smile upon
his lips which they could not see because of the distance, and
which, not knowing Billy Byrne, they would not have interpreted
correctly; but the revolver they did understand, and at sight of it
one of them threw his carbine to his shoulder. His finger, however,
never closed upon the trigger, for there came the sound of a shot
from beyond Billy Byrne and the Mexican staggered forward, pitching
over the edge of the porch to the ground.</p>

<p>Billy turned his head in the direction from which the shot had
come and saw Eddie Shorter running toward him, a smoking
six-shooter in his right hand.</p>

<p>"Go back," commanded Byrne; "this is my funeral."</p>

<p>"Not on your life," replied Eddie Shorter. "Those greasers don't
take no white man off'n El Orobo, while I'm here. Get busy! They're
comin'."</p>

<p>And sure enough they were coming, and as they came their
carbines popped and the bullets whizzed about the heads of the two
Americans. Grayson, too, had taken a hand upon the side of the
Villistas. From the bunkhouse other men were running rapidly in the
direction of the fight, attracted by the first shots.</p>

<p>Billy and Eddie stood their ground, a few paces apart. Two more
of Villa's men went down. Grayson ran for cover. Then Billy Byrne
dropped the last of the Mexicans just as the men from the bunkhouse
came panting upon the scene. There were both Americans and Mexicans
among them. All were armed and weapons were ready in their
hands.</p>

<p>They paused a short distance from the two men. Eddie's presence
upon the side of the stranger saved Billy from instant death, for
Eddie was well liked by both his Mexican and American
fellow-workers.</p>

<p>"What's the fuss?" asked an American.</p>

<p>Eddie told them, and when they learned that the boss's daughter
had been spirited away and that the ranch foreman was at the bottom
of it the anger of the Americans rose to a dangerous pitch.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" someone asked. They were gathered in a little
cluster now about Billy Byrne and Shorter.</p>

<p>"I saw him duck behind the office building," said Eddie.</p>

<p>"Come on," said another. "We'll get him."</p>

<p>"Someone get a rope." The men spoke in low, ordinary
tones&mdash;they appeared unexcited. Determination was the most
apparent characteristic of the group. One of them ran back toward
the bunkhouse for his rope. The others walked slowly in the
direction of the rear of the office building. Grayson was not
there. The search proceeded. The Americans were in advance. The
Mexicans kept in a group by themselves a little in rear of the
others&mdash;it was not their trouble. If the gringos wanted to
lynch another gringo, well and good&mdash;that was the gringos'
business. They would keep out of it, and they did.</p>

<p>Down past the bunkhouse and the cookhouse to the stables the
searchers made their way. Grayson could not be found. In the
stables one of the men made a discovery&mdash;the foreman's saddle
had vanished. Out in the corrals they went. One of the men
laughed&mdash;the bars were down and the saddle horses gone. Eddie
Shorter presently pointed out across the pasture and the river to
the skyline of the low bluffs beyond. The others looked. A horseman
was just visible urging his mount upward to the crest, the two
stood in silhouette against the morning sky pink with the new
sun.</p>

<p>"That's him," said Eddie.</p>

<p>"Let him go," said Billy Byrne. "He won't never come back and he
ain't worth chasin'. Not while we got Miss Barbara to look after.
My horse is down there with yours. I'm goin' down to get him. Will
you come, Shorter? I may need help&mdash;I ain't much with a rope
yet."</p>

<p>He started off without waiting for a reply, and all the
Americans followed. Together they circled the horses and drove them
back to the corral. When Billy had saddled and mounted he saw that
the others had done likewise.</p>

<p>"We're goin' with you," said one of the men. "Miss Barbara
b'longs to us."</p>

<p>Billy nodded and moved off in the direction of the ranchhouse.
Here he dismounted and with Eddie Shorter and Mr. Harding commenced
circling the house in search of some manner of clue to the
direction taken by the abductors. It was not long before they came
upon the spot where the Indians' horses had stood the night before.
From there the trail led plainly down toward the river. In a moment
ten Americans were following it, after Mr. Harding had supplied
Billy Byrne with a carbine, another six-shooter, and
ammunition.</p>

<p>Through the river and the cut in the barbed-wire fence, then up
the face of the bluff and out across the low mesa beyond the trail
led. For a mile it was distinct, and then disappeared as though the
riders had separated.</p>

<p>"Well," said Billy, as the others drew around him for
consultation, "they'd be goin' to the hills there. They was
Pimans&mdash;Esteban's tribe. They got her up there in the hills
somewheres. Let's split up an' search the hills for her. Whoever
comes on 'em first'll have to do some shootin' and the rest of us
can close in an' help. We can go in pairs&mdash;then if one's
killed the other can ride out an' lead the way back to where it
happened."</p>

<p>The men seemed satisfied with the plan and broke up into parties
of two. Eddie Shorter paired off with Billy Byrne.</p>

<p>"Spread out," said the latter to his companions. "Eddie an' I'll
ride straight ahead&mdash;the rest of you can fan out a few miles
on either side of us. S'long an' good luck," and he started off
toward the hills, Eddie Shorter at his side.</p>

<p><br>
BACK at the ranch the Mexican <i>vaqueros</i> lounged about,
grumbling. With no foreman there was nothing to do except talk
about their troubles. They had not been paid since the looting of
the bank at Cuivaca, for Mr. Harding had been unable to get any
silver from elsewhere until a few days since. He now had assurances
that it was on the way to him; but whether or not it would reach El
Orobo was a question.</p>

<p>"Why should we stay here when we are not paid?" asked one of
them.</p>

<p>"Yes, why?" chorused several others.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to do here," said another. "We will go to
Cuivaca. I, for one, am tired of working for the gringos."</p>

<p>This met with the unqualified approval of all, and a few moments
later the men had saddled their ponies and were galloping away in
the direction of sun-baked Cuivaca. They sang now, and were happy,
for they were as little boys playing hooky from school&mdash;not
bad men; but rather irresponsible children.</p>

<p>Once in Cuivaca they swooped down upon the drinking-place,
where, with what little money a few of them had left they proceeded
to get drunk.</p>

<p>Later in the day an old, dried-up Indian entered. He was hot and
dusty from a long ride.</p>

<p>"Hey, José!" cried one of the <i>vaqueros</i> from El Orobo
Rancho; "you old rascal, what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>José looked around upon them. He knew them all&mdash;they
represented the Mexican contingent of the riders of El Orobo. José
wondered what they were all doing here in Cuivaca at one time. Even
upon a pay day it never had been the rule of El Orobo to allow more
than four men at a time to come to town.</p>

<p>"Oh, José come to buy coffee and tobacco," he replied. He looked
about searchingly. "Where are the others?" he asked, "&mdash;the
gringos?"</p>

<p>"They have ridden after Esteban," explained one of the
<i>vaqueros</i>. "He has run off with Senorita Harding."</p>

<p>José raised his eyebrows as though this was all news.</p>

<p>"And Señor Grayson has gone with them?" he asked. "He was very
fond of the senorita."</p>

<p>"Señor Grayson has run away," went on the other speaker. "The
other gringos wished to hang him, for it is said he has bribed
Esteban to do this thing."</p>

<p>Again José raised his eyebrows. "Impossible!" he ejaculated.
"And who then guards the ranch?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"Señor Harding, two Mexican house servants, and a Chinaman," and
the <i>vaquero</i> laughed.</p>

<p>"I must be going," José announced after a moment. "It is a long
ride for an old man from my poor home to Cuivaca, and back
again."</p>

<p>The <i>vaqueros</i> were paying no further attention to him, and
the Indian passed out and sought his pony; but when he had mounted
and ridden from town he took a strange direction for one whose path
lies to the east, since he turned his pony's head toward the
northwest.</p>

<p>José had ridden far that day, since Billy had left his humble
hut. He had gone to the west to the little rancho of one of
Pesita's adherents who had dispatched a boy to carry word to the
bandit that his Captain Byrne had escaped the Villistas, and then
José had ridden into Cuivaca by a circuitous route which brought
him up from the east side of the town.</p>

<p>Now he was riding once again for Pesita; but this time he would
bear the information himself. He found the chief in camp and after
begging tobacco and a cigarette paper the Indian finally reached
the purpose of his visit.</p>

<p>"José has just come from Cuivaca," he said, "and there he drank
with all the Mexican <i>vaqueros</i> of El Orobo
Rancho&mdash;<i>all</i>, my general, you understand. It seems that
Esteban has carried off the beautiful senorita of El Orobo Rancho,
and the <i>vaqueros</i> tell José that <i>all</i> the American
<i>vaqueros</i> have ridden in search of her&mdash;<i>all</i>, my
general, you understand. In such times of danger it is odd that the
gringos should leave El Orobo thus unguarded. Only the rich Señor
Harding, two house servants, and a Chinaman remain."</p>

<p>A man lay stretched upon his blankets in a tent next to that
occupied by Pesita. At the sound of the speaker's voice, low though
it was, he raised his head and listened. He heard every word, and a
scowl settled upon his brow. Barbara stolen! Mr Harding practically
alone upon the ranch! And Pesita in possession of this
information!</p>

<p>Bridge rose to his feet. He buckled his cartridge belt about his
waist and picked up his carbine, then he crawled under the rear
wall of his tent and walked slowly off in the direction of the
picket line where the horses were tethered.</p>

<p>"Ah, Señor Bridge," said a pleasant voice in his ear; "where
to?"</p>

<p>Bridge turned quickly to look into the smiling, evil face of
Rozales.</p>

<p>"Oh," he replied, "I'm going out to see if I can't find some
shooting. It's awfully dull sitting around here doing nothing."</p>

<p>"Si, señor," agreed Rozales; "I, too, find it so. Let us go
together&mdash;I know where the shooting is best."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it," thought Bridge; "probably in the back;" but
aloud he said: "Certainly, that will be fine," for he guessed that
Rozales had been set to watch his movements and prevent his escape,
and, perchance, to be the sole witness of some unhappy event which
should carry Señor Bridge to the arms of his fathers.</p>

<p>Rozales called a soldier to saddle and bridle their horses and
shortly after the two were riding abreast down the trail out of the
hills. Where it was necessary that they ride in single file Bridge
was careful to see that Rozales rode ahead, and the Mexican
graciously permitted the American to fall behind.</p>

<p>If he was inspired by any other motive than simple espionage he
was evidently content to bide his time until chance gave him the
opening he desired, and it was equally evident that he felt as safe
in front of the American as behind him.</p>

<p>At a point where a ravine down which they had ridden debauched
upon a mesa Rozales suggested that they ride to the north, which
was not at all the direction in which Bridge intended going. The
American demurred.</p>

<p>"But there is no shooting down in the valley," urged
Rozales.</p>

<p>"I think there will be," was Bridge's enigmatical reply, and
then, with a sudden exclamation of surprise he pointed over
Rozales' shoulder. "What's that?" he cried in a voice tense with
excitement.</p>

<p>The Mexican turned his head quickly in the direction Bridge's
index finger indicated.</p>

<p>"I see nothing," said Rozales, after a moment.</p>

<p>"You do now, though," replied Bridge, and as the Mexican's eyes
returned in the direction of his companion he was forced to admit
that he did see something&mdash;the dismal, hollow eye of a
six-shooter looking him straight in the face.</p>

<p>"Señor Bridge!" exclaimed Rozales. "What are you doing? What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean," said Bridge, "that if you are at all solicitous of
your health you'll climb down off that pony, not forgetting to keep
your hands above your head when you reach the ground. Now
climb!"</p>

<p>Rozales dismounted.</p>

<p>"Turn your back toward me," commanded the American, and when the
other had obeyed him, Bridge dismounted and removed the man's
weapons from his belt. "Now you may go, Rozales," he said, "and
should you ever have an American in your power again remember that
I spared your life when I might easily have taken it&mdash;when it
would have been infinitely safer for me to have done it."</p>

<p>The Mexican made no reply, but the black scowl that clouded his
face boded ill for the next gringo who should be so unfortunate as
to fall into his hands. Slowly he wheeled about and started back up
the trail in the direction of the Pesita camp.</p>

<p>"I'll be halfway to El Orobo," thought Bridge, "before he gets a
chance to tell Pesita what happened to him," and then he remounted
and rode on down into the valley, leading Rozales' horse behind
him.</p>

<p>It would never do, he knew, to turn the animal loose too soon,
since he would doubtless make his way back to camp, and in doing so
would have to pass Rozales who would catch him. Time was what
Bridge wanted&mdash;to be well on his way to Orobo before Pesita
should learn of his escape.</p>

<p>Bridge knew nothing of what had happened to Billy, for Pesita
had seen to it that the information was kept from the American. The
latter had, nevertheless, been worrying not a little at the absence
of his friend for he knew that he had taken his liberty and his
life in his hands in riding down to El Orobo among avowed
enemies.</p>

<p>Far to his rear Rozales plodded sullenly up the steep trail
through the mountains, revolving in his mind various exquisite
tortures he should be delighted to inflict upon the next gringo who
came into his power.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapb16" id="chapb16">XVI. &mdash; EDDIE MAKES
GOOD</a></h2>

<p class="first">Billy Byrne and Eddie Shorter rode steadily in the
direction of the hills. Upon either side and at intervals of a mile
or more stretched the others of their party, occasionally visible;
but for the most part not. Once in the hills the two could no
longer see their friends or be seen by them.</p>

<p>Both Byrne and Eddie felt that chance had placed them upon the
right trail for a well-marked and long-used path wound upward
through a canyon along which they rode. It was an excellent
location for an ambush, and both men breathed more freely when they
had passed out of it into more open country upon a narrow tableland
between the first foothills and the main range of mountains.</p>

<p>Here again was the trail well marked, and when Eddie, looking
ahead, saw that it appeared to lead in the direction of a vivid
green spot close to the base of the gray brown hills he gave an
exclamation of assurance.</p>

<p>"We're on the right trail all right, old man," he said. "They's
water there," and he pointed ahead at the green splotch upon the
gray. "That's where they'd be havin' their village. I ain't never
been up here so I ain't familiar with the country. You see we don't
run no cattle this side the river&mdash;the Pimans won't let us.
They don't care to have no white men pokin' round in their country;
but I'll bet a hat we find a camp there."</p>

<p>Onward they rode toward the little spot of green. Sometimes it
was in sight and again as they approached higher ground, or wound
through gullies and ravines it was lost to their sight; but always
they kept it as their goal. The trail they were upon led to
it&mdash;of that there could be no longer the slightest doubt. And
as they rode with their destination in view black, beady eyes
looked down upon them from the very green oasis toward which they
urged their ponies&mdash;tiring now from the climb.</p>

<p>A lithe, brown body lay stretched comfortably upon a bed of
grasses at the edge of a little rise of ground beneath which the
riders must pass before they came to the cluster of huts which
squatted in a tiny natural park at the foot of the main peak. Far
above the watcher a spring of clear, pure water bubbled out of the
mountain-side, and running downward formed little pools among the
rocks which held it. And with this water the Pimans irrigated their
small fields before it sank from sight again into the earth just
below their village. Beside the brown body lay a long rifle. The
man's eyes watched, unblinking, the two specks far below him whom
he knew and had known for an hour were gringos.</p>

<p>Another brown body wormed itself forward to his side and peered
over the edge of the declivity down upon the white men. He spoke a
few words in a whisper to him who watched with the rifle, and then
crawled back again and disappeared. And all the while, onward and
upward came Billy Byrne and Eddie Shorter, each knowing in his
heart that if not already, then at any moment a watcher would
discover them and a little later a bullet would fly that would find
one of them, and they took the chance for the sake of the American
girl who lay hidden somewhere in these hills, for in no other way
could they locate her hiding place more quickly. Any one of the
other eight Americans who rode in pairs into the hills at other
points to the left and right of Billy Byrne and his companion would
have and was even then cheerfully taking the same chances that
Eddie and Billy took, only the latter were now assured that to one
of them would fall the sacrifice, for as they had come closer Eddie
had seen a thin wreath of smoke rising from among the trees of the
oasis. Now, indeed, were they sure that they had chanced upon the
trail to the Piman village.</p>

<p>"We gotta keep our eyes peeled," said Eddie, as they wound into
a ravine which from its location evidently led directly up to the
village. "We ain't far from 'em now, an' if they get us they'll get
us about here."</p>

<p>As though to punctuate his speech with the final period a rifle
cracked above them. Eddie jumped spasmodically and clutched his
breast.</p>

<p>"I'm hit," he said, quite unemotionally.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne's revolver had answered the shot from above them,
the bullet striking where Billy had seen a puff of smoke following
the rifle shot. Then Billy turned toward Eddie.</p>
<a id="pic4" name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src="fr100040-images/TheMucker-04.jpg"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"I'm hit," said Eddie unemotionally, as
Billy<br>
Byrne's revolver answered the shot from above.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"Hit bad?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yep, I guess so," said Eddie. "What'll we do? Hide up here, or
ride back after the others?"</p>

<p>Another shot rang out above them, although Billy had been
watching for a target at which to shoot again&mdash;a target which
he had been positive he would get when the man rose to fire again.
And Billy did see the fellow at last&mdash;a few paces from where
he had first fired; but not until the other had dropped Eddie's
horse beneath him. Byrne fired again, and this time he had the
satisfaction of seeing a brown body rise, struggle a moment, and
then roll over once upon the grass before it came to rest.</p>

<p>"I reckon we'll stay here," said Billy, looking ruefully at
Eddie's horse.</p>

<p>Eddie rose and as he did so he staggered and grew very white.
Billy dismounted and ran forward, putting an arm about him. Another
shot came from above and Billy Byrne's pony grunted and
collapsed.</p>

<p>"Hell!" exclaimed Byrne. "We gotta get out of this," and lifting
his wounded comrade in his arms he ran for the shelter of the bluff
from the summit of which the snipers had fired upon them. Close in,
hugging the face of the perpendicular wall of tumbled rock and
earth, they were out of range of the Indians; but Billy did not
stop when he had reached temporary safety. Farther up toward the
direction in which lay the village, and halfway up the side of the
bluff Billy saw what he took to be excellent shelter. Here the face
of the bluff was less steep and upon it lay a number of large
boulders, while others protruded from the ground about them.</p>

<p>Toward these Billy made his way. The wounded man across his
shoulder was suffering indescribable agonies; but he bit his lip
and stifled the cries that each step his comrade took seemed to
wrench from him, lest he attract the enemy to their position.</p>

<p>Above them all was silence, yet Billy knew that alert, red
foemen were creeping to the edge of the bluff in search of their
prey. If he could but reach the shelter of the boulders before the
Pimans discovered them!</p>

<p>The minutes that were consumed in covering the hundred yards
seemed as many hours to Billy Byrne; but at last he dragged the
fainting cowboy between two large boulders close under the edge of
the bluff and found himself in a little, natural fortress, well
adapted to defense.</p>

<p>From above they were protected from the fire of the Indians upon
the bluff by the height of the boulder at the foot of which they
lay, while another just in front hid them from possible marksmen
across the canyon. Smaller rocks scattered about gave promise of
shelter from flank fire, and as soon as he had deposited Eddie in
the comparative safety of their retreat Byrne commenced forming a
low breastwork upon the side facing the village&mdash;the direction
from which they might naturally expect attack. This done he turned
his attention to the opening upon the opposite side and soon had a
similar defense constructed there, then he turned his attention to
Eddie, though keeping a watchful eye upon both approaches to their
stronghold.</p>

<p>The Kansan lay upon his side, moaning. Blood stained his lips
and nostrils, and when Billy Byrne opened his shirt and found a
gaping wound in his right breast he knew how serious was his
companion's injury. As he felt Billy working over him the boy
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you think I'm done for?" he asked in a tortured whisper.</p>

<p>"Nothin' doin'," lied Billy cheerfully. "Just a scratch. You'll
be all right in a day or two."</p>

<p>Eddie shook his head wearily. "I wish I could believe you," he
said. "I ben figgerin' on goin' back to see maw. I ain't thought o'
nothin' else since you told me 'bout how she missed me. I ken see
her right now just like I was there. I'll bet she's scrubbin' the
kitchen floor. Maw was always a-scrubbin' somethin'. Gee! but it's
tough to cash in like this just when I was figgerin' on goin'
home."</p>

<p>Billy couldn't think of anything to say. He turned to look up
and down the canyon in search of the enemy.</p>

<p>"Home!" whispered Eddie. "Home!"</p>

<p>"Aw, shucks!" said Billy kindly. "You'll get home all right,
kid. The boys must a-heard the shootin' an' they'll be along in no
time now. Then we'll clean up this bunch o' coons an' have you back
to El Orobo an' nursed into shape in no time."</p>

<p>Eddie tried to smile as he looked up into the other's face. He
reached a hand out and laid it on Billy's arm.</p>

<p>"You're all right, old man," he whispered. "I know you're lyin'
an' so do you; but it makes me feel better anyway to have you say
them things."</p>

<p>Billy felt as one who has been caught stealing from a blind man.
The only adequate reply of which he could think was, "Aw,
shucks!"</p>

<p>"Say," said Eddie after a moment's silence, "if you get out o'
here an' ever go back to the States promise me you'll look up maw
and paw an' tell 'em I was comin' home&mdash;to stay. Tell 'em I
died decent, too, will you&mdash;died like paw was always a-tellin'
me my granddad died, fightin' Injuns 'round Fort Dodge
somewheres."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Billy; "I'll tell 'em. Gee! Look who's comin'
here," and as he spoke he flattened himself to the ground just as a
bullet pinged against the rock above his head and the report of a
rifle sounded from up the canyon. "That guy most got me. I'll have
to be 'tendin' to business better'n this."</p>

<p>He drew himself slowly up upon his elbows, his carbine ready in
his hand, and peered through a small aperture between two of the
rocks which composed his breastwork. Then he stuck the muzzle of
the weapon through, took aim and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>"Didje get him?" asked Eddie.</p>

<p>"Yep," said Billy, and fired again. "Got that one too. Say,
they're tough-lookin' guys; but I guess they won't come so fast
next time. Those two were right in the open, workin' up to us on
their bellies. They must a-thought we was sleepin'."</p>

<p>For an hour Billy neither saw nor heard any sign of the enemy,
though several times he raised his hat above the breastwork upon
the muzzle of his carbine to draw their fire.</p>

<p>It was midafternoon when the sound of distant rifle fire came
faintly to the ears of the two men from somewhere far below
them.</p>

<p>"The boys must be comin'," whispered Eddie Shorter
hopefully.</p>

<p>For half an hour the firing continued and then silence again
fell upon the mountains. Eddie began to wander mentally. He talked
much of Kansas and his old home, and many times he begged for
water.</p>

<p>"Buck up, kid," said Billy; "the boys'll be along in a minute
now an' then we'll get you all the water you want."</p>

<p>But the boys did not come. Billy was standing up now, stretching
his legs, and searching up and down the canyon for Indians. He was
wondering if he could chance making a break for the valley where
they stood some slight chance of meeting with their companions, and
even as he considered the matter seriously there came a staccato
report and Billy Byrne fell forward in a heap.</p>

<p>"God!" cried Eddie. "They got him now, they got him."</p>

<p>Byrne stirred and struggled to rise.</p>

<p>"Like'll they got me," he said, and staggered to his knees.</p>

<p>Over the breastwork he saw a half-dozen Indians running rapidly
toward the shelter&mdash;he saw them in a haze of red that was
caused not by blood but by anger. With an oath Billy Byrne leaped
to his feet. From his knees up his whole body was exposed to the
enemy; but Billy cared not. He was in a berserker rage. Whipping
his carbine to his shoulder he let drive at the advancing Indians
who were now beyond hope of cover. They must come on or be shot
down where they were, so they came on, yelling like devils and
stopping momentarily to fire upon the rash white man who stood so
perfect a target before them.</p>

<p>But their haste spoiled their marksmanship. The bullets zinged
and zipped against the rocky little fortress, they nicked Billy's
shirt and trousers and hat, and all the while he stood there
pumping lead into his assailants&mdash;not hysterically; but with
the cool deliberation of a butcher slaughtering beeves.</p>

<p>One by one the Pimans dropped until but a single Indian rushed
frantically upon the white man, and then the last of the assailants
lunged forward across the breastwork with a bullet from Billy's
carbine through his forehead.</p>

<p>Eddie Shorter had raised himself painfully upon an elbow that he
might witness the battle, and when it was over he sank back, the
blood welling from between his set teeth.</p>

<p>Billy turned to look at him when the last of the Pimans was
disposed of, and seeing his condition kneeled beside him and took
his head in the hollow of an arm.</p>

<p>"You orter lie still," he cautioned the Kansan. "Tain't good for
you to move around much."</p>

<p>"It was worth it," whispered Eddie. "Say, but that was some
scrap. You got your nerve standin' up there against the bunch of
'em; but if you hadn't they'd have rushed us and some of 'em would
a-got in."</p>

<p>"Funny the boys don't come," said Billy.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Eddie, with a sigh; "it's milkin' time now, an' I
figgered on goin' to Shawnee this evenin'. Them's nice cookies,
maw. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Billy Byrne was bending low to catch his feeble words, and when
the voice trailed out into nothingness he lowered the tousled red
head to the hard earth and turned away.</p>

<p>Could it be that the thing which glistened on the eyelid of the
toughest guy on the West Side was a tear?</p>

<p>The afternoon waned and night came, but it brought to Billy
Byrne neither renewed attack nor succor. The bullet which had
dropped him momentarily had but creased his forehead. Aside from
the fact that he was blood covered from the wound it had
inconvenienced him in no way, and now that darkness had fallen he
commenced to plan upon leaving the shelter.</p>

<p>First he transferred Eddie's ammunition to his own person, and
such valuables and trinkets as he thought "maw" might be glad to
have, then he removed the breechblock from Eddie's carbine and
stuck it in his pocket that the weapon might be valueless to the
Indians when they found it.</p>

<p>"Sorry I can't bury you old man," was Billy's parting comment,
as he climbed over the breastwork and melted into the night.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne moved cautiously through the darkness, and he moved
not in the direction of escape and safety but directly up the
canyon in the way that the village of the Pimans lay.</p>

<p>Soon he heard the sound of voices and shortly after saw the
light of cook fires playing upon bronzed faces and upon the fronts
of low huts. Some women were moaning and wailing. Billy guessed
that they mourned for those whom his bullets had found earlier in
the day. In the darkness of the night, far up among the rough,
forbidding mountains it was all very weird and uncanny.</p>

<p>Billy crept closer to the village. Shelter was abundant. He saw
no sign of sentry and wondered why they should be so lax in the
face of almost certain attack. Then it occurred to him that
possibly the firing he and Eddie had heard earlier in the day far
down among the foothills might have meant the extermination of the
Americans from El Orobo.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be next then," mused Billy, and wormed closer to the
huts. His eyes were on the alert every instant, as were his ears;
but no sign of that which he sought rewarded his keenest
observation.</p>

<p>Until midnight he lay in concealment and all that time the
mourners continued their dismal wailing. Then, one by one, they
entered their huts, and silence reigned within the village.</p>

<p>Billy crept closer. He eyed each hut with longing, wondering
gaze. Which could it be? How could he determine? One seemed little
more promising than the others. He had noted those to which Indians
had retired. There were three into which he had seen none go.
These, then, should be the first to undergo his scrutiny.</p>

<p>The night was dark. The moon had not yet risen. Only a few dying
fires cast a wavering and uncertain light upon the scene. Through
the shadows Billy Byrne crept closer and closer. At last he lay
close beside one of the huts which was to be the first to claim his
attention.</p>

<p>For several moments he lay listening intently for any sound
which might come from within; but there was none. He crawled to the
doorway and peered within. Utter darkness shrouded and hid the
interior.</p>

<p>Billy rose and walked boldly inside. If he could see no one
within, then no one could see him once he was inside the door.
Therefore, so reasoned Billy Byrne, he would have as good a chance
as the occupants of the hut, should they prove to be enemies.</p>

<p>He crossed the floor carefully, stopping often to listen. At
last he heard a rustling sound just ahead of him. His fingers
tightened upon the revolver he carried in his right hand, by the
barrel, clublike. Billy had no intention of making any more noise
than necessary.</p>

<p>Again he heard a sound from the same direction. It was not at
all unlike the frightened gasp of a woman. Billy emitted a low
growl, in fair imitation of a prowling dog that has been
disturbed.</p>

<p>Again the gasp, and a low: "Go away!" in liquid feminine
tones&mdash;and in English!</p>

<p>Billy uttered a low: "S-s-sh!" and tiptoed closer. Extending his
hands they presently came in contact with a human body which shrank
from him with another smothered cry.</p>

<p>"Barbara!" whispered Billy, bending closer.</p>

<p>A hand reached out through the darkness, found him, and closed
upon his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked a low voice.</p>

<p>"Billy," he replied. "Are you alone in here?"</p>

<p>"No, an old woman guards me," replied the girl, and at the same
time they both heard a movement close at hand, and something
scurried past them to be silhouetted for an instant against the
path of lesser darkness which marked the location of the
doorway.</p>

<p>"There she goes!" cried Barbara. "She heard you and she has gone
for help."</p>

<p>"Then come!" said Billy, seizing the girl's arm and dragging her
to her feet; but they had scarce crossed half the distance to the
doorway when the cries of the old woman without warned them that
the camp was being aroused.</p>

<p>Billy thrust a revolver into Barbara's hand. "We gotta make a
fight of it, little girl," he said. "But you'd better die than be
here alone."</p>

<p>As they emerged from the hut they saw warriors running from
every doorway. The old woman stood screaming in Piman at the top of
her lungs. Billy, keeping Barbara in front of him that he might
shield her body with his own, turned directly out of the village.
He did not fire at first hoping that they might elude detection and
thus not draw the fire of the Indians upon them; but he was doomed
to disappointment, and they had taken scarcely a dozen steps when a
rifle spoke above the noise of human voices and a bullet whizzed
past them.</p>

<p>Then Billy replied, and Barbara, too, from just behind his
shoulder. Together they backed away toward the shadow of the trees
beyond the village and as they went they poured shot after shot
into the village.</p>

<p>The Indians, but just awakened and still half stupid from sleep,
did not know but that they were attacked by a vastly superior
force, and this fear held them in check for several
minutes&mdash;long enough for Billy and Barbara to reach the summit
of the bluff from which Billy and Eddie had first been fired
upon.</p>

<p>Here they were hidden from the view of the Indians, and Billy
broke at once into a run, half carrying the girl with a strong arm
about her waist.</p>

<p>"If we can reach the foothills," he said, "I think we can dodge
'em, an' by goin' all night we may reach the river and El Orobo by
morning. It's a long hike, Barbara, but we gotta make it&mdash;we
gotta, for if daylight finds us in the Piman country we won't never
make it. Anyway," he concluded optimistically, "it's all down
hill."</p>

<p>"We'll make it, Billy," she replied, "if we can get past the
sentry."</p>

<p>"What sentry?" asked Billy. "I didn't see no sentry when I come
in."</p>

<p>"They keep a sentry way down the trail all night," replied the
girl. "In the daytime he is nearer the village&mdash;on the top of
this bluff, for from here he can see the whole valley; but at night
they station him farther away in a narrow part of the trail."</p>

<p>"It's a mighty good thing you tipped me off," said Billy; "for
I'd a-run right into him. I thought they was all behind us
now."</p>

<p>After that they went more cautiously, and when they reached the
part of the trail where the sentry might be expected to be found,
Barbara warned Billy of the fact. Like two thieves they crept along
in the shadow of the canyon wall. Inwardly Billy cursed the
darkness of the night which hid from view everything more than a
few paces from them; yet it may have been this very darkness which
saved them, since it hid them as effectually from an enemy as it
hid the enemy from them. They had reached the point where Barbara
was positive the sentry should be. The girl was clinging tightly to
Billy's left arm. He could feel the pressure of her fingers as they
sunk into his muscles, sending little tremors and thrills through
his giant frame. Even in the face of death Billy Byrne could sense
the ecstasies of personal contact with this girl&mdash;the only
woman he ever had loved or ever would.</p>

<p>And then a black shadow loomed before them, and a rifle flashed
in their faces without a word or a sign of warning.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chapb17" id="chapb17">XVII. &mdash; "YOU ARE MY
GIRL!"</a></h2>

<p class="first">Mr. Anthony Harding was pacing back and forth the
length of the veranda of the ranchhouse at El Orobo waiting for
some word of hope from those who had ridden out in search of his
daughter, Barbara. Each swirling dust devil that eddied across the
dry flat on either side of the river roused hopes within his breast
that it might have been spurred into activity by the hoofs of a
pony bearing a messenger of good tidings; but always his hopes were
dashed, for no horseman emerged from the heat haze of the distance
where the little dust devils raced playfully among the cacti and
the greasewood.</p>

<p>But at last, in the northwest, a horseman, unheralded by
gyrating dust column, came into sight. Mr. Harding shook his head
sorrowfully. It had not been from this direction that he had
expected word of Barbara, yet he kept his eyes fastened upon the
rider until the latter reined in at the ranchyard and loped a tired
and sweating pony to the foot of the veranda steps. Then Mr.
Harding saw who the newcomer was.</p>

<p>"Bridge!" he exclaimed. "What brings you back here? Don't you
know that you endanger us as well as yourself by being seen here?
General Villa will think that we have been harboring you."</p>

<p>Bridge swung from the saddle and ran up onto the veranda. He
paid not the slightest attention to Anthony Harding's protest.</p>

<p>"How many men you got here that you can depend on?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"None," replied the Easterner. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"None!" cried Bridge, incredulity and hopelessness showing upon
his countenance. "Isn't there a Chinaman and a couple of faithful
Mexicans?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course," assented Mr. Harding; "but what are you
driving at?"</p>

<p>"Pesita is on his way here to clean up El Orobo. He can't be
very far behind me. Call the men you got, and we'll get together
all the guns and ammunition on the ranch, and barricade the
ranchhouse. We may be able to stand 'em off. Have you heard
anything of Miss Barbara?"</p>

<p>Anthony Harding shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"Then we'll have to stay right here and do the best we can,"
said Bridge. "I was thinking we might make a run for it if Miss
Barbara was here; but as she's not we must wait for those who went
out after her."</p>

<p>Mr. Harding summoned the two Mexicans while Bridge ran to the
cookhouse and ordered the Chinaman to the ranchhouse. Then the
erstwhile bookkeeper ransacked the bunkhouse for arms and
ammunition. What little he found he carried to the ranchhouse, and
with the help of the others barricaded the doors and windows of the
first floor.</p>

<p>"We'll have to make our fight from the upper windows," he
explained to the ranch owner. "If Pesita doesn't bring too large a
force we may be able to stand them off until you can get help from
Cuivaca. Call up there now and see if you can get Villa to send
help&mdash;he ought to protect you from Pesita. I understand that
there is no love lost between the two."</p>

<p>Anthony Harding went at once to the telephone and rang for the
central at Cuivaca.</p>

<p>"Tell it to the operator," shouted Bridge who stood peering
through an opening in the barricade before a front window; "they
are coming now, and the chances are that the first thing they'll do
is cut the telephone wires."</p>

<p>The Easterner poured his story and appeal for help into the ears
of the girl at the other end of the line, and then for a few
moments there was silence in the room as he listened to her
reply.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" and "My God! it can't be true," Bridge heard the
older man ejaculate, and then he saw him hang up the receiver and
turn from the instrument, his face drawn and pinched with an
expression of utter hopelessness.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" asked Bridge.</p>

<p>"Villa has turned against the Americans," replied Harding,
dully. The operator evidently feels friendly toward us, for she
warned me not to appeal to Villa and told me why. Even now, this
minute, the man has a force of twenty-five hundred ready to march
on Columbus, New Mexico. Three Americans were hanged in Cuivaca
this afternoon. It's horrible, sir! It's horrible! We are as good
as dead this very minute. Even if we stand off Pesita we can never
escape to the border through Villa's forces."</p>

<p>"It looks bad," admitted Bridge. "In fact it couldn't look much
worse; but here we are, and while our ammunition holds out about
all we can do is stay here and use it. Will you men stand by us?"
he addressed the Chinaman and the two Mexicans, who assured him
that they had no love for Pesita and would fight for Anthony
Harding in preference to going over to the enemy.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Bridge, "and now for upstairs. "They'll be
howling around here in about five minutes, and we want to give them
a reception they won't forget."</p>

<p>He led the way to the second floor, where the five took up
positions near the front windows. A short distance from the
ranchhouse they could see the enemy, consisting of a detachment of
some twenty of Pesita's troopers riding at a brisk trot in their
direction.</p>

<p>"Pesita's with them," announced Bridge, presently. "He's the
little fellow on the sorrel. Wait until they are close up, then
give them a few rounds; but go easy on the ammunition&mdash;we
haven't any too much."</p>

<p>Pesita, expecting no resistance, rode boldly into the ranchyard.
At the bunkhouse and the office his little force halted while three
or four troopers dismounted and entered the buildings in search of
victims. Disappointed there they moved toward the ranchhouse.</p>

<p>"Lie low!" Bridge cautioned his companions. "Don't let them see
you, and wait till I give the word before you fire."</p>

<p>On came the horsemen at a slow walk. Bridge waited until they
were within a few yards of the house, then he cried: "Now! Let 'em
have it!" A rattle of rifle fire broke from the upper windows into
the ranks of the Pesitistas. Three troopers reeled and slipped from
their saddles. Two horses dropped in their tracks. Cursing and
yelling, the balance of the horsemen wheeled and galloped away in
the direction of the office building, followed by the fire of the
defenders.</p>

<p>"That wasn't so bad," cried Bridge. "I'll venture a guess that
Mr. Pesita is some surprised&mdash;and sore. There they go behind
the office. They'll stay there a few minutes talking it over and
getting up their courage to try it again. Next time they'll come
from another direction. You two," he continued, turning to the
Mexicans, "take positions on the east and south sides of the house.
Sing can remain here with Mr. Harding. I'll take the north side
facing the office. Shoot at the first man who shows his head. If we
can hold them off until dark we may be able to get away. Whatever
happens don't let one of them get close enough to fire the house.
That's what they'll try for."</p>

<p>It was fifteen minutes before the second attack came. Five
dismounted troopers made a dash for the north side of the house;
but when Bridge dropped the first of them before he had taken ten
steps from the office building and wounded a second the others
retreated for shelter.</p>

<p>Time and again as the afternoon wore away Pesita made attempts
to get men close up to the house; but in each instance they were
driven back, until at last they desisted from their efforts to fire
the house or rush it, and contented themselves with firing an
occasional shot through the windows opposite them.</p>

<p>"They're waiting for dark," said Bridge to Mr. Harding during a
temporary lull in the hostilities, "and then we're goners, unless
the boys come back from across the river in time."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we get away after dark?" asked the Easterner.</p>

<p>"It's our only hope if help don't reach us," replied Bridge.</p>

<p>But when night finally fell and the five men made an attempt to
leave the house upon the side away from the office building they
were met with the flash of carbines and the ping of bullets. One of
the Mexican defenders fell, mortally wounded, and the others were
barely able to drag him within and replace the barricade before the
door when five of Pesita's men charged close up to their defenses.
These were finally driven off and again there came a lull; but all
hope of escape was gone, and Bridge reposted the defenders at the
upper windows where they might watch every approach to the
house.</p>

<p>As the hours dragged on the hopelessness of their position grew
upon the minds of all. Their ammunition was almost gone&mdash;each
man had but a few rounds remaining&mdash;and it was evident that
Pesita, through an inordinate desire for revenge, would persist
until he had reduced their fortress and claimed the last of them as
his victim.</p>

<p>It was with such cheerful expectations that they awaited the
final assault which would see them without ammunition and
defenseless in the face of a cruel and implacable foe.</p>

<p>It was just before daylight that the anticipated rush occurred.
From every side rang the reports of carbines and the yells of the
bandits. There were scarcely more than a dozen of the original
twenty left; but they made up for their depleted numbers by the
rapidity with which they worked their firearms and the loudness and
ferocity of their savage cries.</p>

<p>And this time they reached the shelter of the veranda and
commenced battering at the door.</p>

<p><br>
AT the report of the rifle so close to them Billy Byrne shoved
Barbara quickly to one side and leaped forward to close with the
man who barred their way to liberty.</p>

<p>That they had surprised him even more than he had them was
evidenced by the wildness of his shot which passed harmlessly above
their heads as well as by the fact that he had permitted them to
come so close before engaging them.</p>

<p>To the latter event was attributable his undoing, for it
permitted Billy Byrne to close with him before the Indian could
reload his antiquated weapon. Down the two men went, the American
on top, each striving for a deathhold; but in weight and strength
and skill the Piman was far outclassed by the trained fighter, a
part of whose daily workouts had consisted in wrestling with
proficient artists of the mat.</p>

<p>Barbara Harding ran forward to assist her champion but as the
men rolled and tumbled over the ground she could find no opening
for a blow that might not endanger Billy Byrne quite as much as it
endangered his antagonist; but presently she discovered that the
American required no assistance. She saw the Indian's head bending
slowly forward beneath the resistless force of the other's huge
muscles, she heard the crack that announced the parting of the
vertebrae and saw the limp thing which had but a moment before been
a man, pulsing with life and vigor, roll helplessly aside&mdash;a
harmless and inanimate lump of clay.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne leaped to his feet, shaking himself as a great
mastiff might whose coat had been ruffled in a fight.</p>

<p>"Come!" he whispered. "We gotta beat it now for sure. That guy's
shot'll lead 'em right down to us," and once more they took up
their flight down toward the valley, along an unknown trail through
the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>For the most part they moved in silence, Billy holding the
girl's arm or hand to steady her over the rough and dangerous
portions of the path. And as they went there grew in Billy's breast
a love so deep and so resistless that he found himself wondering
that he had ever imagined that his former passion for this girl was
love.</p>

<p>This new thing surged through him and over him with all the
blind, brutal, compelling force of a mighty tidal wave. It battered
down and swept away the frail barriers of his new-found gentleness.
Again he was the Mucker&mdash;hating the artificial wall of social
caste which separated him from this girl; but now he was ready to
climb the wall, or, better still, to batter it down with his huge
fists. But the time was not yet&mdash;first he must get Barbara to
a place of safety.</p>

<p>On and on they went. The night grew cold. Far ahead there
sounded the occasional pop of a rifle. Billy wondered what it could
mean and as they approached the ranch and he discovered that it
came from that direction he hastened their steps to even greater
speed than before.</p>

<p>"Somebody's shootin' up the ranch," he volunteered. "Wonder who
it could be."</p>

<p>"Suppose it is your friend and general?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>Billy made no reply. They reached the river and as Billy knew
not where the fords lay he plunged in at the point at which the
water first barred their progress and dragging the girl after him,
plowed bull-like for the opposite shore. Where the water was above
his depth he swam while Barbara clung to his shoulders. Thus they
made the passage quickly and safely.</p>

<p>Billy stopped long enough to shake the water out of his carbine,
which the girl had carried across, and then forged ahead toward the
ranchhouse from which the sounds of battle came now in increased
volume.</p>

<p>And at the ranchhouse "hell was popping". The moment Bridge
realized that some of the attackers had reached the veranda he
called the surviving Mexican and the Chinaman to follow him to the
lower floor where they might stand a better chance to repel this
new attack. Mr. Harding he persuaded to remain upstairs.</p>

<p>Outside a dozen men were battering to force an entrance. Already
one panel had splintered, and as Bridge entered the room he could
see the figures of the bandits through the hole they had made.
Raising his rifle he fired through the aperture. There was a scream
as one of the attackers dropped; but the others only increased
their efforts, their oaths, and their threats of vengeance.</p>

<p>The three defenders poured a few rounds through the sagging
door, then Bridge noted that the Chinaman ceased firing.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Allee gonee," replied Sing, pointing to his ammunition
belt.</p>

<p>At the same instant the Mexican threw down his carbine and
rushed for a window on the opposite side of the room. His
ammunition was exhausted and with it had departed his courage.
Flight seemed the only course remaining. Bridge made no effort to
stop him. He would have been glad to fly, too; but he could not
leave Anthony Harding, and he was sure that the older man would
prove unequal to any sustained flight on foot.</p>

<p>"You better go, too, Sing," he said to the Chinaman, placing
another bullet through the door; "there's nothing more that you can
do, and it may be that they are all on this side now&mdash;I think
they are. You fellows have fought splendidly. Wish I could give you
something more substantial than thanks; but that's all I have now
and shortly Pesita won't even leave me that much."</p>

<p>"Allee light," replied Sing cheerfully, and a second later he
was clambering through the window in the wake of the loyal
Mexican.</p>

<p>And then the door crashed in and half a dozen troopers followed
by Pesita himself burst into the room.</p>

<p>Bridge was standing at the foot of the stairs, his carbine
clubbed, for he had just spent his last bullet. He knew that he
must die; but he was determined to make them purchase his life as
dearly as he could, and to die in defense of Anthony Harding, the
father of the girl he loved, even though hopelessly.</p>

<p>Pesita saw from the American's attitude that he had no more
ammunition. He struck up the carbine of a trooper who was about to
shoot Bridge down.</p>

<p>"Wait!" commanded the bandit. "Cease firing! His ammunition is
gone. Will you surrender?" he asked of Bridge.</p>

<p>"Not until I have beaten from the heads of one or two of your
friends," he replied, "that which their egotism leads them to
imagine are brains. No, if you take me alive, Pesita, you will have
to kill me to do it."</p>

<p>Pesita shrugged. "Very well," he said, indifferently, "it makes
little difference to me&mdash;that stairway is as good as a wall.
These brave defenders of the liberty of poor, bleeding Mexico will
make an excellent firing squad. Attention, my children! Ready!
Aim!"</p>

<p>Eleven carbines were leveled at Bridge. In the ghastly light of
early dawn the sallow complexions of the Mexicans took on a weird
hue. The American made a wry face, a slight shudder shook his
slender frame, and then he squared his shoulders and looked Pesita
smilingly in the face.</p>

<p>The figure of a man appeared at the window through which the
Chinaman and the loyal Mexican had escaped. Quick eyes took in the
scene within the room.</p>

<p>"Hey!" he yelled. "Cut the rough stuff!" and leaped into the
room.</p>

<p>Pesita, surprised by the interruption, turned toward the
intruder before he had given the command to fire. A smile lit his
features when he saw who it was.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, "my dear Captain Byrne. Just in time to see
a traitor and a spy pay the penalty for his crimes."</p>

<p>"Nothin' doin'," growled Billy Byrne, and then he threw his
carbine to his shoulder and took careful aim at Pesita's face.</p>

<p>How easy it would have been to have hesitated a moment in the
window before he made his presence known&mdash;just long enough for
Pesita to speak the single word that would have sent eleven bullets
speeding into the body of the man who loved Barbara and whom Billy
believed the girl loved. But did such a thought occur to Billy
Byrne of Grand Avenue? It did not. He forgot every other
consideration beyond his loyalty to a friend. Bridge and Pesita
were looking at him in wide-eyed astonishment.</p>

<p>"Lay down your carbines!" Billy shot his command at the firing
squad. "Lay 'em down or I'll bore Pesita. Tell 'em to lay 'em down,
Pesita. I gotta bead on your beezer."</p>

<p>Pesita did as he was bid, his yellow face pasty with rage.</p>

<p>"Now their cartridge belts!" snapped Billy, and when these had
been deposited upon the floor he told Bridge to disarm the bandit
chief.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Harding safe?" he asked of Bridge, and receiving an
affirmative he called upstairs for the older man to descend.</p>

<p>As Mr. Harding reached the foot of the stairs Barbara entered
the room by the window through which Billy had come&mdash;a window
which opened upon the side veranda.</p>

<p>"Now we gotta hike," announced Billy. "It won't never be safe
for none of you here after this, not even if you do think Villa's
your friend&mdash;which he ain't the friend of no American."</p>

<p>"We know that now," said Mr. Harding, and repeated to Billy that
which the telephone operator had told him earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Marching Pesita and his men ahead of them Billy and the others
made their way to the rear of the office building where the horses
of the bandits were tethered. They were each armed now from the
discarded weapons of the raiders, and well supplied with
ammunition. The Chinaman and the loyal Mexican also discovered
themselves when they learned that the tables had been turned upon
Pesita. They, too, were armed and all were mounted, and when Billy
had loaded the remaining weapons upon the balance of the horses the
party rode away, driving Pesita's live stock and arms ahead of
them.</p>

<p>"I imagine," remarked Bridge, "that you've rather discouraged
pursuit for a while at least," but pursuit came sooner than they
had anticipated.</p>

<p>They had reached a point on the river not far from José's when a
band of horsemen appeared approaching from the west. Billy urged
his party to greater speed that they might avoid a meeting if
possible; but it soon became evident that the strangers had no
intention of permitting them to go unchallenged, for they altered
their course and increased their speed so that they were soon
bearing down upon the fugitives at a rapid gallop.</p>

<p>"I guess," said Billy, "that we'd better open up on 'em. It's a
cinch they ain't no friends of ours anywhere in these parts."</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better wait a moment," said Mr. Harding; "we do not
want to chance making any mistake."</p>

<p>"It ain't never a mistake to shoot a Dago," replied Billy. His
eyes were fastened upon the approaching horsemen, and he presently
gave an exclamation of recognition. "There's Rozales," he said. "I
couldn't mistake that beanpole nowheres. We're safe enough in
takin' a shot at 'em if Rosie's with 'em. He's Pesita's head guy,"
and he drew his revolver and took a single shot in the direction of
his former comrades. Bridge followed his example. The oncoming
Pesitistas reined in. Billy returned his revolver to its holster
and drew his carbine.</p>

<p>"You ride on ahead," he said to Mr. Harding and Barbara. "Bridge
and I'll bring up the rear."</p>

<p>Then he stopped his pony and turning took deliberate aim at the
knot of horsemen to their left. A bandit tumbled from his saddle
and the fight was on.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Americans Rozales had but a handful of men
with him and Rozales himself was never keen for a fight in the
open.</p>

<p>All morning he hovered around the rear of the escaping
Americans; but neither side did much damage to the other, and
during the afternoon Billy noticed that Rozales merely followed
within sight of them, after having dispatched one of his men back
in the direction from which they had come.</p>

<p>"After reinforcements," commented Byrne.</p>

<p>All day they rode without meeting with any roving bands of
soldiers or bandits, and the explanation was all too sinister to
the Americans when coupled with the knowledge that Villa was to
attack an American town that night.</p>

<p>"I wish we could reach the border in time to warn 'em," said
Billy; "but they ain't no chance. If we cross before sunup tomorrow
morning we'll be doin' well."</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken to Barbara Harding all day, for his
duties as rear guard had kept him busy; nor had he conversed much
with Bridge, though he had often eyed the latter whose gaze
wandered many times to the slender, graceful figure of the girl
ahead of them.</p>

<p>Billy was thinking as he never had thought before. It seemed to
him a cruel fate that had so shaped their destinies that his best
friend loved the girl Billy loved. That Bridge was ignorant of
Billy's infatuation for her the latter well knew. He could not
blame Bridge, nor could he, upon the other hand, quite reconcile
himself to the more than apparent adoration which marked his
friend's attitude toward Barbara.</p>

<p>As daylight waned the fugitives realized from the shuffling gait
of their mounts, from drooping heads and dull eyes that rest was
imperative. They themselves were fagged, too, and when a ranchhouse
loomed in front of them they decided to halt for much-needed
recuperation.</p>

<p>Here they found three Americans who were totally unaware of
Villa's contemplated raid across the border, and who when they were
informed of it were doubly glad to welcome six extra carbines, for
Barbara not only was armed but was eminently qualified to expend
ammunition without wasting it.</p>

<p>Rozales and his small band halted out of range of the ranch; but
they went hungry while their quarry fed themselves and their tired
mounts.</p>

<p>The Clark brothers and their cousin, a man by the name of Mason,
who were the sole inhabitants of the ranch counseled a long
rest&mdash;two hours at least, for the border was still ten miles
away and speed at the last moment might be their sole means of
salvation.</p>

<p>Billy was for moving on at once before the reinforcements, for
which he was sure Rozales had dispatched his messenger, could
overtake them. But the others were tired and argued, too, that upon
jaded ponies they could not hope to escape and so they waited,
until, just as they were ready to continue their flight, flight
became impossible.</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen when the little party commenced to resaddle
their ponies and in the midst of their labors there came a rude and
disheartening interruption. Billy had kept either the Chinaman or
Bridge constantly upon watch toward the direction in which Rozales'
men lolled smoking in the dark, and it was the crack of Bridge's
carbine which awoke the Americans to the fact that though the
border lay but a few miles away they were still far from
safety.</p>

<p>As he fired Bridge turned in his saddle and shouted to the
others to make for the shelter of the ranchhouse.</p>

<p>"There are two hundred of them," he cried. "Run for cover!"</p>

<p>Billy and the Clark brothers leaped to their saddles and spurred
toward the point where Bridge sat pumping lead into the advancing
enemy. Mason and Mr. Harding hurried Barbara to the questionable
safety of the ranchhouse. The Mexican followed them, and Bridge
ordered Sing back to assist in barricading the doors and windows,
while he and Billy and the Clark boys held the bandits in momentary
check.</p>

<p>Falling back slowly and firing constantly as they came the four
approached the house while Pesita and his full band advanced
cautiously after them. They had almost reached the house when
Bridge lunged forward from his saddle. The Clark boys had
dismounted and were leading their ponies inside the house. Billy
alone noted the wounding of his friend. Without an instant's
hesitation he slipped from his saddle, ran back to where Bridge lay
and lifted him in his arms. Bullets were pattering thick about
them. A horseman far in advance of his fellows galloped forward
with drawn saber to cut down the gringos.</p>

<p>Billy, casting an occasional glance behind, saw the danger in
time to meet it&mdash;just, in fact, as the weapon was cutting
through the air toward his head. Dropping Bridge and dodging to one
side he managed to escape the cut, and before the swordsman could
recover Billy had leaped to his pony's side and seizing the rider
about the waist dragged him to the ground.</p>

<p>"Rozales!" he exclaimed, and struck the man as he had never
struck another in all his life, with the full force of his mighty
muscles backed by his great weight, with clenched fist full in the
face.</p>

<p>There was a spurting of blood and a splintering of bone, and
Captain Guillermo Rozales sank senseless to the ground, his career
of crime and rapine ended forever.</p>

<p>Again Billy lifted Bridge in his arms and this time he succeeded
in reaching the ranchhouse without opposition though a little
crimson stream trickled down his left arm to drop upon the face of
his friend as he deposited Bridge upon the floor of the house.</p>

<p>All night the Pesitistas circled the lone ranchhouse. All night
they poured their volleys into the adobe walls and through the
barricaded windows. All night the little band of defenders fought
gallantly for their lives; but as day approached the futility of
their endeavors was borne in upon them, for of the nine one was
dead and three wounded, and the numbers of their assailants seemed
undiminished.</p>

<p>Billy Byrne had been lying all night upon his stomach before a
window firing out into the darkness at the dim forms which
occasionally showed against the dull, dead background of the
moonless desert.</p>

<p>Presently he leaped to his feet and crossed the floor to the
room in which the horses had been placed.</p>

<p>"Everybody fire toward the rear of the house as fast as they
can," said Billy. "I want a clear space for my getaway."</p>

<p>"Where you goin?" asked one of the Clark brothers.</p>

<p>"North," replied Billy, "after some of Funston's men on the
border."</p>

<p>"But they won't cross," said Mr. Harding. "Washington won't let
them."</p>

<p>"They gotta," snapped Billy Byrne, "an' they will when they know
there's an American girl here with a bunch of Dagos yappin'
around."</p>

<p>"You'll be killed," said Price Clark. "You can't never get
through."</p>

<p>"Leave it to me," replied Billy. "Just get ready an' open that
back door when I give the word, an' then shut it again in a hurry
when I've gone through."</p>

<p>He led a horse from the side room, and mounted it.</p>

<p>"Open her up, boes!" he shouted, and "S'long everybody!"</p>

<p>Price Clark swung the door open. Billy put spurs to his mount
and threw himself forward flat against the animal's neck. Another
moment he was through and a rattling fusillade of shots proclaimed
the fact that his bold feat had not gone unnoted by the foe.</p>

<p>The little Mexican pony shot like a bolt from a crossbow out
across the level desert. The rattling of carbines only served to
add speed to its frightened feet. Billy sat erect in the saddle,
guiding the horse with his left hand and working his revolver
methodically with his right.</p>

<p>At a window behind him Barbara Harding stood breathless and
spellbound until he had disappeared into the gloom of the early
morning darkness to the north, then she turned with a weary sigh
and resumed her place beside the wounded Bridge whose head she
bathed with cool water, while he tossed in the delirium of
fever.</p>

<p><br>
THE first streaks of daylight were piercing the heavens, the
Pesitistas were rallying for a decisive charge, the hopes of the
little band of besieged were at low ebb when from the west there
sounded the pounding of many hoofs.</p>

<p>"Villa," moaned Westcott Clark, hopelessly. "We're done for now,
sure enough. He must be comin' back from his raid on the
border."</p>

<p>In the faint light of dawn they saw a column of horsemen deploy
suddenly into a long, thin line which galloped forward over the
flat earth, coming toward them like a huge, relentless engine of
destruction.</p>

<p>The Pesitistas were watching too. They had ceased firing and sat
in their saddles forgetful of their contemplated charge.</p>

<p>The occupants of the ranchhouse were gathered at the small
windows.</p>

<p>"What's them?" cried Mason&mdash;"them things floating over
'em."</p>

<p>"They're guidons!" exclaimed Price Clark "&mdash;the guidons of
the United States cavalry regiment. See 'em! See 'em? God! but
don't they look good?"</p>

<p>There was a wild whoop from the lungs of the advancing
cavalrymen. Pesita's troops answered it with a scattering volley,
and a moment later the Americans were among them in that famous
revolver charge which is now history.</p>

<p>Daylight had come revealing to the watchers in the ranchhouse
the figures of the combatants. In the thick of the fight loomed the
giant figure of a man in nondescript garb which more closely
resembled the apparel of the Pesitistas than it did the uniforms of
the American soldiery, yet it was with them he fought. Barbara's
eyes were the first to detect him.</p>

<p>"There's Mr. Byrne," she cried. "It must have been he who
brought the troops."</p>

<p>"Why, he hasn't had time to reach the border yet," remonstrated
one of the Clark boys, "much less get back here with help."</p>

<p>"There he is though," said Mr. Harding. "It's certainly strange.
I can't understand what American troops are doing across the
border&mdash;especially under the present administration."</p>

<p>The Pesitistas held their ground for but a moment then they
wheeled and fled; but not before Pesita himself had forced his pony
close to that of Billy Byrne.</p>

<p>"Traitor!" screamed the bandit. "You shall die for this," and
fired point-blank at the American.</p>

<p>Billy felt a burning sensation in his already wounded left arm;
but his right was still good.</p>

<p>"For poor, bleeding Mexico!" he cried, and put a bullet through
Pesita's forehead.</p>

<p><br>
UNDER escort of the men of the Thirteenth Cavalry who had
pursued Villa's raiders into Mexico and upon whom Billy Byrne had
stumbled by chance, the little party of fugitives came safely to
United States soil, where all but one breathed sighs of heartfelt
relief.</p>

<p>Bridge was given first aid by members of the hospital corps, who
assured Billy that his friend would not die. Mr. Harding and
Barbara were taken in by the wife of an officer, and it was at the
quarters of the latter that Billy Byrne found her alone in the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>The girl looked up as he entered, a sad smile upon her face. She
was about to ask him of his wound; but he gave her no
opportunity.</p>

<p>"I've come for you," he said. "I gave you up once when I thought
it was better for you to marry a man in your own class. I won't
give you up again. You're mine&mdash;you're my girl, and I'm goin'
to take you with me. We're goin' to Galveston as fast as we can,
and from there we're goin' to Rio. You belonged to me long before
Bridge saw you. He can't have you. Nobody can have you but me, and
if anyone tries to keep me from taking you they'll get killed."</p>

<p>He took a step nearer that brought him close to her. She did not
shrink&mdash;only looked up into his face with wide eyes filled
with wonder. He seized her roughly in his arms.</p>

<p>"You are my girl!" he cried hoarsely. "Kiss me!"</p>

<p>"Wait!" she said. "First tell me what you meant by saying that
Bridge couldn't have me. I never knew that Bridge wanted me, and I
certainly have never wanted Bridge. O Billy! Why didn't you do this
long ago? Months ago in New York I wanted you to take me; but you
left me to another man whom I didn't love. I thought you had ceased
to care, Billy, and since we have been together here&mdash;since
that night in the room back of the office&mdash;you have made me
feel that I was nothing to you. Take me, Billy! Take me anywhere in
the world that you go. I love you and I'll slave for
you&mdash;anything just to be with you."</p>

<p>"Barbara!" cried Billy Byrne, and then his voice was smothered
by the pressure of warm, red lips against his own.</p>

<p><br>
A HALF HOUR later Billy stepped out into the street to make his
way to the railroad station that he might procure transportation
for three to Galveston. Anthony Harding was going with them. He had
listened to Barbara's pleas, and had finally volunteered to back
Billy Byrne's flight from the jurisdiction of the law, or at least
to a place where, under a new name, he could start life over again
and live it as the son-in-law of old Anthony Harding should
live.</p>

<p>Among the crowd viewing the havoc wrought by the raiders the
previous night was a large man with a red face. It happened that he
turned suddenly about as Billy Byrne was on the point of passing
behind him. Both men started as recognition lighted their faces and
he of the red face found himself looking down the barrel of a
six-shooter.</p>

<p>"Put it up, Byrne," he admonished the other coolly. "I didn't
know you were so good on the draw."</p>

<p>"I'm good on the draw all right, Flannagan," said Billy, "and I
ain't drawin' for amusement neither. I gotta chance to get away and
live straight, and have a little happiness in life, and, Flannagan,
the man who tries to crab my game is goin' to get himself croaked.
I'll never go back to stir alive. See?"</p>

<p>"Yep," said Flannagan, "I see; but I ain't tryin' to crab your
game. I ain't down here after you this trip. Where you been,
anyway, that you don't know the war's over? Why Coke Sheehan
confessed a month ago that it was him that croaked Schneider, and
the governor pardoned you about ten days ago."</p>

<p>"You stringin' me?" asked Billy, a vicious glint in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"On the level," Flannagan assured him. "Wait, I gotta clippin'
from the <i>Trib</i> in my clothes somewheres that gives all the
dope."</p>

<p>He drew some papers from his coat pocket and handed one to
Billy.</p>

<p>"Turn your back and hold up your hands while I read," said
Byrne, and as Flannagan did as he was bid Billy unfolded the soiled
bit of newspaper and read that which set him a-trembling with
nervous excitement.</p>

<p>A moment later Detective Sergeant Flannagan ventured a rearward
glance to note how Byrne was receiving the joyful tidings which the
newspaper article contained.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be!" ejaculated the sleuth, for Billy Byrne was
already a hundred yards away and breaking all records in his dash
for the sitting-room he had quitted but a few minutes before.</p>

<p><br>
IT was a happy and contented trio who took the train the
following day on their way back to New York City after bidding
Bridge good-bye in the improvised hospital and exacting his promise
that he would visit them in New York in the near future.</p>

<p><br>
IT was a month later; spring was filling the southland with new,
sweet life. The joy of living was reflected in the song of birds
and the opening of buds. Beside a slow-moving stream a man squatted
before a tiny fire. A battered tin can, half filled with water
stood close to the burning embers. Upon a sharpened stick the man
roasted a bit of meat, and as he watched it curling at the edges as
the flame licked it he spoke aloud though there was none to
hear:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">
"Just for a con I'd like to know (yes, he crossed over long ago;<br>
And he was right, believe me, bo!) if somewhere in the South,<br>
Down where the clouds lie on the sea, He found his sweet Penelope<br>
With buds of roses in her hair And kisses on her mouth."</p>
<br>

<p>"Which is what they will be singing about me one of these days,"
he commented.</p>
