<h2>BOOK I. &mdash; THE ISHMAELITE</h2>

<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>I. &mdash; THE FUGITIVE</h2>

<p class="first">THE tropic moon shone brightly on the village of
Adaffia in the Bight of Benin as a fishing-canoe steered warily
through the relatively quiet surf of the dry season towards the
steep beach. Out in the roadstead an anchored barque stood up
sharply against the moonlit sky, the yellow spark of her riding
light glimmering warmly, and a white shape dimly discernible in the
approaching canoe hinted of a visitor from the sea. Soon the little
craft, hidden for a while in the white smother of a breaking wave,
emerged triumphant and pushed her pointed nose up the beach; the
occupants leaped out and, seizing her by her inturned gunwales,
hauled her forthwith out of reach of the following wave.</p>

<p>"You know where to go?" the Englishman demanded, turning a grim,
hatchet face towards the 'headman'. "Don't take me to the wrong
house."</p>

<p>The headman grinned. "Only one white man live for Adaffia. Me
sabby him proper." He twisted a rag of cotton cloth into a kind of
turban, clapped it on his woolly pate and, poising on top a
battered cabin-trunk, strode off easily across the waste of blown
sand that separated the beach from a forest of coconut palms that
hid the village. The Englishman followed less easily, his shod feet
sinking into the loose sand; and as he went, he peered with a
stranger's curiosity along the deserted beach and into the solemn
gloom beneath the palms, whence came the rhythmical clamour of
drums and the sound of many voices joining in a strange, monotonous
chant.</p>

<p>Through the ghostly colonnade of palm trunks, out into the
narrow, tortuous alleys that served for streets, between rows of
mud-built hovels roofed with unkempt grass thatch, where all was
inky blackness in the shadow and silvery grey in the light, the
stranger followed his guide; and ever the noise of the drums and
the melancholy chant drew nearer. Suddenly the two men emerged from
an alley into a large open space and in an instant passed from the
stillness of the empty streets into a scene of the strangest bustle
and uproar. In the middle of the space was a group of men, seated
on low stools, who held between their knees drums of various sizes,
which they were beating noisily, though by no means unskillfully,
some with crooked sticks, others with the flat of the hand. Around
the musicians a circle of dancers moved in an endless procession,
the men and the women forming separate groups; and while the former
danced furiously, writhing with starting muscles and streaming
skins, in gestures grotesque and obscene, the latter undulated
languorously with half-closed eyes and rhythmically moving
arms.</p>

<p>The Englishman had halted in the black shadow to look on at this
singular scene and to listen to the strange chant that rang out at
intervals from dancers and spectators alike, when his guide touched
him on the arm and pointed.</p>

<p>"Look, Mastah!" said he; "dem white man live. You look um?"</p>

<p>The stranger looked over the heads of the dancers, and, sure
enough, in the very midst of the revellers, he espied a
fellow-countryman seated on a green-painted gin-case, the sides of
which he was pounding with his fists in unsuccessful emulation of
the drummers. He was not a spectacle to engender undue pride of
race. To begin with, he was obviously drunk, and as he drummed on
the case and bellowed discordantly at intervals, he was not
dignified. Perhaps to be drunk and dignified at one and the same
time is not easy, and assuredly the task is made no easier by a
costume consisting of a suit of ragged pyjamas, the legs tucked
into scarlet socks, gaudy carpet slippers, and a skullcap of
plaited grass. But such was the garb of this representative of a
superior race, and the final touch was given to a raffish ensemble
by an unlit cigar that waggled from the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>The stranger stood for a minute or more watching, in silence and
with grim disapproval, this unedifying spectacle, when a sudden
interruption occurred. One of the dancers, a big, powerful ruffian,
in giving an extra flourish to his performance, struck his foot
against the gin-case and staggered on to the seated white man, who,
with a loud, foolish laugh, caught him playfully by the ankle. As a
result, the big negro toppled over and fell sprawling amongst the
drummers. In an instant all was confusion and uproar. The drummers
pummelled the fallen man, the women howled, the men shouted, and
the drunken white man yelled with idiotic laughter. Then the big
negro leaped to his feet with a roar of fury, and rushing at the
white man, closed with him. The gin-case turned turtle at the first
onset, the two combatants flew off gyrating amongst the legs of the
crowd, mowing down a little lane as they went; and for some moments
nothing could be distinguished save a miscellaneous heap of black
bodies and limbs with a pair of carpet slippers kicking wildly in
the air. But the white man, if lacking in dignity and discretion,
was not deficient in valour. He was soon on his feet and hitting
out right and left with uncommon liveliness and spirit. This,
however, could not, and did not, last long; a simultaneous rush of
angry negroes soon bore him to the ground and there seemed every
prospect of his being very severely mauled.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the stranger abandoned his role of a
neutral spectator. Taking off his helmet and depositing it
carefully in the angle of a mud wall, he lowered his head, thrust
forward his shoulder, and charged heavily into the midst of the
shouting mob. Now, the Slave Coast native is a sturdy, courageous
fellow and truculent withal; but he does not play the Rugby game
and he is a stranger alike to the subtler aspects of pugilism and
the gentle art of ju-jitsu. Consequently the tactics of the new
assailant created quite a sensation among the Adaffia men. Their
heels flew up unaccountably, their heads banged together from
unknown causes, mysterious thumps, proceeding from nowhere in
particular with the weight of a pile-monkey, stretched them gasping
on the earth; and when they would have replied in kind, behold! the
enemy was not there! They rushed at him with outstretched hands and
straightway fell upon their stomachs; they grabbed at his head and
caught nothing but a pain in the shoulder or a tap under the chin;
and the sledge hammer blow that was to have annihilated him either
spent itself on empty air or, impinging upon the countenance of an
ally, led to misunderstanding and confusion. Hampered by their own
numbers and baffled by the incredible quickness of their elusive
adversary, they began to view his strange manoeuvres as feats of
magic. The fire of battle died down, giving place to doubt,
bewilderment, and superstitious fear. The space widened round the
white, silent, swiftly-moving figure; the more faint-hearted made
off with their hands clapped to their mouths, screeching forth the
hideous Efé alarm cry; the panic spread, and the remainder first
backed away and then fairly broke into a run. A minute later the
place was deserted save or the two Europeans and the headman.</p>

<p>The stranger had pursued the retreating mob for some distance,
tripping up the stragglers or accelerating their movements by
vigorous hammerings from behind, and he now returned, straightening
out his drill jacket and dusting the grimy sand from his
pipe-clayed shoes with a silk handkerchief. The other white man had
by this time returned to the gin-case, on which he was once more
enthroned with one of the abandoned drums between his knees, and,
as his compatriot approached, he executed a martial roll and would
have burst into song but that the cigar, which had been driven into
his mouth during the conflict, now dropped into his throat and
reduced him temporarily to the verge of suffocation.</p>

<p>"Many thanks, dear chappie," said he, when he had removed the
obstruction; "moral s'pport most valuable; uphold dignity of white
man; congratulate you on your style; do credit to Richardsons.
Excuse my not rising; reasons excellent; will appear when I do." In
fact his clothing had suffered severely in the combat.</p>

<p>The stranger looked down at the seated figure silently and with
tolerant contempt. A stern-faced, grim-looking man was this
new-comer, heavy-browed, square-jawed, and hatchet-faced, and his
high-shouldered, powerful figure set itself in a characteristic
pose, with the feet wide apart and the hands clasped behind the
back as he stood looking down on his new acquaintance.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, at length, "you realize that you're as
drunk as an owl?"</p>

<p>"I s'spected it," returned the other gravely. "Not's an owl,
though; owls very temp'rate in these parts."</p>

<p>At this moment the headman rose from the cabin-trunk, on which
he had seated himself to view the conflict, and, picking up the
stranger's helmet, brought it to him.</p>

<p>"Mastah," said he, earnestly, "you go for house one time. Dis
place no good. Dem people be angry too much; he go fetch gun."</p>

<p>"You hear that?" said the stranger. "You'd better clear off
home."</p>

<p>"Ver' well, dear boy," replied the other, suavely. "Call hansom;
we'll both go."</p>

<p>"Whereabouts do you live?" demanded the stranger.</p>

<p>The other man looked up with a bland smile. "Grosvenor Square,
ol' fellow, A1; brass knocker 'stinguishers on doorstep. Tell cabby
knock three times and ring bottom bell." He picked up the cigar and
began carefully to wipe the sand from it.</p>

<p>"Do you know where he lives?" asked the stranger, turning to the
headman.</p>

<p>"Yass; me sabby. He live for factory. You make him come one
time, Mastah. You hear dat?"</p>

<p>The sound of the strange and dismal Efé alarm cry (produced by
shouting or screaming continuously and patting the mouth quickly
with the flat of the hand) was borne down from the farther end of
the village. The headman caught up the trunk and started off up the
street, while the stranger, having hoisted the seated man off the
gin-case with such energy that he staggered round in a half-circle,
grasped him from behind by both arms and urged him forward at a
brisk trot.</p>

<p>"Here, I say!" protested the latter, "nosso fast, d'ye hear?
I've dropped my slipper. Lemme pick up my slipper."</p>

<p>To these protests the stranger paid no attention, but continued
to hustle his captive forward with undiminished energy.</p>

<p>"Lemme go, confound you! You're shaking me all to bits!"
exclaimed the captive; and, as the other continued to shove
silently, he continued: "Now I un'stand why you boosted those
niggers so neatly. You're a bobby, that's what you are. I know the
professional touch. A blooming escaped bobby. Well, I'm jiggered!"
He lapsed, after this, into gloomy silence, and a few minutes' more
rapid travelling brought the party to a high palm-leaf fence. A
primitive gate was unfastened, by the simple process of withdrawing
a skewer from a loop of cord, and they entered a compound in the
middle of which stood a long, low house. The latter was mud-built
and thatched with grass like the houses in the village, from which,
indeed, it differed only in that its mud walls were whitewashed and
pierced for several windows.</p>

<p>"Lemme welcome you to my humble cot," said the proprietor,
following the headman, who had unceremoniously walked into the
house and dumped down the cabin-trunk. The stranger entered a
small, untidy room lighted by a hurricane-lamp, and, having
dismissed the headman with a substantial 'dash', or present, turned
to face his host.</p>

<p>"Siddown," said the latter, dropping into a dilapidated Madeira
chair and waving his hand towards another. "Less' have a talk.
Don't know your name, but you seem to be a decent feller&mdash;for
a bobby. My name's Larkom, John Larkom, agent for Foster Brothers.
This is Fosters' factory."</p>

<p>The stranger looked curiously round the room&mdash;so little
suggestive of a factory in the European sense&mdash;and then, as he
seated himself, said: "You probably know me by name: I am John
Walker, of whom you have&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a screech of laughter from Larkom, who
flung himself back in his chair with such violence as to bring that
piece of furniture to the verge of dissolution.</p>

<p>"Johnny Walker!" he howled. "My immortal scissors! Sh'ld think I
do know you; more senses than one. I've got a letter about
you&mdash;'ll show it to you. Where is that blamed letter?" He
dragged out a table-drawer and rooted among a litter of papers,
from which he at length extracted a crumpled sheet of paper. "Here
we are. Letter from Hepburn. You 'member Hepburn? He and I at
Oxford together. Merton, y'know. Less see what he says. Ah! here
you are; I'll read it: 'And now I want you to do me a little
favour. You will receive a visit from a pal of mine who, in
consequence of certain little indiscretions, is for the moment
under a cloud, and I want you, if you can, to put him up and keep
him out of sight. His fame I am not permitted to disclose, since
being, as I have said, 'sub nube', just at present, and
consequently not in search of fame or notoriety he elects to travel
under the modest and appropriate name of Walker.'" At this point
Larkom once more burst into a screech of laughter. "Funny devil,
Hepburn! awful rum devil," he mumbled, leering idiotically at the
letter that shook in his hand; then, wiping his eyes on the gaudy
'trade' tablecloth, he resumed his reading. "'He need not cause you
any inconvenience, and you won't mind his company as he is quite a
decent fellow&mdash;he entered at Merton just after you went
down&mdash;and he won't be any expense to you; in fact, with
judicious management, he may be made to yield a profit, since he
will have some money with him and is, between ourselves, somewhat
of a mug.' Rum devil, awful rum devil," sniggered Larkom. "Doncher
think so?" he added, grinning foolishly in the other man's
face.</p>

<p>"Very," replied the stranger, stolidly. But he did not look
particularly amused.</p>

<p>"'I think that is all I have to tell you,'" Larkom continued,
reading from the letter. "'I hope you will be able to put the poor
devil up, and, by the way, you need not let on that I have told you
about his little misfortunes.'" Larkom looked up with a ridiculous
air of vexation. "There now," he exclaimed, "I've given old Hepburn
away like a silly fool. But no, it was he that was a silly fool. He
shouldn't have told me."</p>

<p>"No, he should not," agreed Walker.</p>

<p>"'Course not," said Larkom with drunken gravity. "Breach o'
confidence. However, 's all right. 'Pend on me. Close as a
lock-jawed oyster. What'll you drink?"</p>

<p>He waved his hand towards the table, on which a plate of limes,
a stone gin jar, a bottle of bitters with a quill stuck through the
cork, and a swizzle-stick, stained purple by long service, invited
to conviviality.</p>

<p>"Have a cocktail," said Larkom. "Wine of the country. Good old
swizzle-stick. I'll mix it. Or p'rhaps," he sniggered, slyly,
"p'raps you'd rather have a drop of Johnny Walker&mdash;ha! ha!
Hallo! Here they are. D'ye hear 'em?" A confused noise of angry
voices was audible outside the compound and isolated shouts
separated themselves now and again from the general hubbub.</p>

<p>"They're callin' us names," chuckled Larkom. "Good thing you
don't un'stand the language. The nigger can be rude. Personal abuse
as a fine art. Have a cocktail."</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better go out and send them about their business?"
asked Walker.</p>

<p>"Lor' bless you, they haven't got any business," was the reply.
"No, siddown. Lerrum alone and they'll go home. Have a cocktail."
He compounded one for himself, swizzling up the pink mixture with
deliberate care and pouring it down his throat with the skill of a
juggler; and when Walker had declined the refreshment and lit his
pipe, the pair sat and listened to the threats and challenges from
the outer darkness. The attitude of masterly inactivity was
justified by its results, for the noise subsided by degrees, and
presently the rumble of drums and the sound of chanting voices told
them that the interrupted revels had been resumed.</p>

<p>After the third application to the stone bottle Larkom began to
grow sleepy and subsided into silence, broken at intervals by an
abortive snore. Walker meanwhile smoked his pipe and regarded his
host with an air of gloomy meditation. At length, as the latter
became more and more somnolent, he ventured to rouse him up.</p>

<p>"You haven't said what you are going to do, Larkom," said he.
"Are you going to put me up for a time?"</p>

<p>Larkom sat up in the squeaking chair and stared at him owlishly.
"Put you up, ol' f'ler?" said he. "Lor bless you, yes. Wodjer
think? Bed been ready for you for mor'n a week. Come'n look at it.
Gettin' dam late. Less' turn in." He took up the lamp and walked
with unsteady steps through a doorway into a small, bare room, the
whitewashed walls of which were tastefully decorated with the
mud-built nests of solitary wasps. It contained two bedsteads, each
fitted with a mosquito net and furnished with a mattress, composed
of bundles of rushes lashed together, and covered with a grass
mat.</p>

<p>"Thash your doss, ol' f'ler," said Larkom, placing the lamp on
the packing-case that served for a table, "this is mine. Goo'
night!" He lifted the mosquito-curtain, crept inside, tucked the
curtain under the mattress, and forthwith began to snore
softly.</p>

<p>Walker fetched in his trunk from the outer room, and, as he
exchanged his drill clothes (which he folded carefully as he
removed them) for a suit of pyjamas, he looked curiously round the
room. A huge, hairy spider was spread out on the wall as if
displayed in a collector's cabinet, and above him a brown cockroach
of colossal proportions twirled his long antennae thoughtfully. The
low, bumpy ceiling formed a promenade for two pallid, goggle-eyed
lizards, who strolled about, defiant of the laws of gravity,
picking up an occasional moth or soft-shelled beetle as they went.
When he was half undressed an enormous fruit-bat, with a head like
that of a fox-terrier, blundered in through the open window and
flopped about the room in noisy panic for several minutes before it
could find its way out again.</p>

<p>At length he put out the lamp, and creeping inside his curtain,
tucked it in securely; and soon, despite the hollow boom of the
surf, the whistle of multitudinous bats, the piping of the
mosquitoes, and the sounds of revelry from the village, he fell
asleep and slept until the sun streamed in on to the whitewashed
wall.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>II. &mdash; THE LEGATEE</h2>

<p class="first">LARKOM appeared to have that tolerance of alcohol
that is often to be observed in the confirmed soaker. As he sat
with his guest in the living-room, taking his early tea, although
he looked frail and broken in health, there was nothing in his
appearance to suggest that he had quite recently been very drunk.
Nor, on the other hand, was his manner very different from that of
the previous night, save that his articulation and his wits were
both clearer.</p>

<p>"What made you pick out this particular health-resort for your
little holiday?" he asked. "It isn't what you would call a
fashionable watering-place."</p>

<p>"No," replied Walker. "That was the attraction. I had heard
about you from Hepburn&mdash;he is my brother-in-law, you
know&mdash;and as it seemed, from what he said, that your abode was
on the very outside edge of the world, I marked it down as a good
place to disappear in."</p>

<p>Larkom grinned. "You are not a bad judge, old chappie.
Disappearing is our speciality. We are famous for it. Always have
been. How does the old mariners' ditty run? You remember it? 'Oh,
the Bight of Benin, the Bight of Benin, One comes out where three
go in.' But perhaps that wasn't exactly what was in your mind?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't. I could have managed that sort of disappearance
without coming so far. But look here, Larkom, let us have a clear
understanding. I came here on spec, not having much time to make
arrangements, on the chance that you might be willing to put me up
and give me a job. But I haven't come to fasten on to you. If my
presence here will be in any way a hindrance to you, you've only
got to say so and I will move on. And I shan't take it as
unfriendly. I quite understand that you have your principals to
consider."</p>

<p>"Principals be blowed!" said Larkom. "They don't come into it;
and as to me, I can assure you, J. W., that this is the first
stroke of luck I've had for years. After vegetating in this
God-forgotten hole with nobody but buck-niggers to speak to, you
can imagine what it is to me to have a pukka white man&mdash;and a
gentleman at that&mdash;under my roof. I feel like chanting
'Domine, non sum dignus'; but if you can put up with me, stay as
long as you care to, and understand that you are doing me a favour
by staying."</p>

<p>"It is very handsome of you, Larkom, to put it in that way,"
said Walker, a little huskily. "Of course, I understand the
position and I accept your offer gratefully. But we must put the
arrangement on a business footing. I'm not going to sponge on you.
I must pay my share of the expenses, and if I can give you any help
in working the factory&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you be afraid, old chappie," interrupted Larkom. "I'll
keep your nose on the grindstone; and as to sharing up, we can see
to that later when we cast up the accounts. As soon as we have
lapped up our tea, we will go out to the store and I will show you
the ropes. They aren't very complicated, though they are in a bit
of a tangle just now. But that is where you will come in, dear
boy."</p>

<p>Larkom's statement as to the 'tangle' was certainly no
exaggeration. The spectacle of muddle and disorder that the store
presented filled Walker at once with joy and exasperation. After a
brief tour of the premises, during which he listened in grim
silence to Larkom's explanations, he deliberately peeled off his
jacket&mdash;which he folded up neatly and put in a place of
safety&mdash;and fell to work on the shelves and lockers with a
concentrated energy that reduced the native helper to gibbering
astonishment and Larkom to indulgent sniggers.</p>

<p>"Don't overdo it, old chap," the latter admonished. "Remember
the climate. And there's no hurry. Plenty of spare time in these
parts. Leave yourself a bit for to-morrow." To all of which advice
Walker paid no attention whatever, but slogged away at the confused
raffle of stock-in-trade without a pause until close upon noon,
when the cook came out to announce that "chop live for table." And
even this was but a temporary pause; for soon after
breakfast&mdash;or tiffin, as the Anglo-Indian calls it&mdash;when
Larkom showed a tendency to doze in his chair with a tumbler of gin
toddy, he stole away to renew his onslaught while the native
assistant attended to the 'trade'.</p>

<p>During the next few days he was kept pretty fully occupied. Not
that there was much business doing at the factory, but Larkom's
hand having become of late so tremulous that writing was
impossible, the posting of books and answering of letters had
automatically ceased.</p>

<p>"You're a perfect godsend to me, old chappie," said Larkom,
when, by dint of two days' continuous labour, the books had been
brought up to date, and Walker attacked the arrears of
correspondence. "The firm wouldn't have stood it much longer.
They've complained of my handwriting already. If you hadn't come I
should have got the order of the boot to a certainty. Now they'll
think I've got a native clerk from somewhere at my own
expense."</p>

<p>"How about the signature?" Walker asked. "Can you manage
that?"</p>

<p>"That's all right, dear boy," said Larkom cheerfully. "You sign
slowly while I kick the table. They'll never twig the
difference."</p>

<p>By means of this novel aid to calligraphy the letter was
completed and duly dispatched by a messenger to catch the land post
at Quittah. Then Walker had leisure to look about him and study the
methods of West Coast trade and the manners and customs of his
host. Larkom sober was not very different from Larkom
drunk&mdash;amiable, easy-going, irresponsible, and only a little
less cheerful. Perhaps he was better drunk. At any rate, that was
his own opinion, and he acted up to it consistently. What would
have happened had there had been any appreciable trade at Adaffia
it is impossible to guess. As it was, the traffic was never beyond
the capacity of Larkom even at his drunkest. Once or twice during
the day a party of bush natives would stroll into the compound with
a demijohn of palm oil or a calabash full of kernels, or a man from
a neighbouring village would bring in a bushel or so of copra, and
then the premises would hum with business. The demijohn would be
emptied into a puncheon or the kernels stowed in bags ready for
shipment, and the vendors would receive their little dole of
threepenny pieces&mdash;the ordinary currency of the coast. Then
the vendors would change into purchasers. A length of baft or
calico, a long flint-lock gun with red-painted stock, a keg of
powder, or a case of gin would replace the produce they had
brought; the threepenny pieces would drift back into the chest
whence they had come, and the deal would be completed.</p>

<p>At these functions Walker, owing to his ignorance of the
language, appeared chiefly in the role of onlooker, though he took
a hand at the scales, when he was about, and helped to fill the
canvas bags with kernels. But he found plenty of time to wander
about the village and acknowledge the appreciative grins of the men
whom he had hammered on the night of his arrival or the courteous
salutations of the women. Frequently in the afternoons he would
stroll out to sit on the dry sand at high-water mark and, as the
feathery leaves of the sea-washed palms pattered above him in the
breeze, would gaze wistfully across the blue and empty ocean. One
day a homeward-bound steamer came into the bay to anchor in Quittah
roads; and then his gaze grew more wistful and the stern face
softened into sadness.</p>

<p>Presently Larkom hove in sight under the palms, carolling
huskily and filling a gaudy trade pipe. He came and sat down by
Walker, and having struck some two dozen Swedish matches without
producing a single spark, gazed solemnly at the steamer.</p>

<p>"Yellow funnel boat," he observed; "that'll be the Niger, old
Rattray's boat. She's going home, dear boy, home to England, where
hansom cabs and green peas and fair ladies and lamb
chops&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, Larkom!" exclaimed the other, gruffly.</p>

<p>"Right, dear boy. Mum's the word," was the bland reply, as
Larkom resumed his fruitless attack on the matches. "But there's
one thing I've been going to say to you," he continued after a
pause, "and it's this&mdash;confound these damstinkers; I've used
up a whole box for nothing&mdash;I was going to say that you'd
better not show yourself out on the beach unnecessarily. I don't
know what your little affair amounts to, but I should say that, if
it was worth your while to cut away from home, it's worth your
while to stop away."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that you are still within the jurisdiction of the
English courts; and if you should have been traced to the ship and
you let yourself be seen, say, by any of the Germans who pass up
and down from Quittah to Lomé or Bagidá, why, some fine day you may
see an officer of the Gold Coast bearing down on you with a file of
Hausas, and then it would be ho! for England, home, and beauty. You
sabby?"</p>

<p>"I must take that risk," growled Walker. "I can't stay skulking
in the house, and I'm not going to."</p>

<p>"As you please, dear boy," said Larkom. "I only mentioned the
matter. Verbum sap. No offence, I hope."</p>

<p>"Of course not," replied Walker.</p>

<p>"I don't think you are in any immediate danger," pursued Larkom.
"Old chief Akolatchi looked in on me just now and he tells me that
there are no white officers at Quittah. The doctor died of
blackwater fever two days ago, and the commissioner is sick and is
off to Madeira by this steamer. Still, you had better keep your
weather eyelid lifting."</p>

<p>"I mean to," said Walker; and knocking out his pipe on the heel
of his shoe, he rose and shook the sand from his clothes.</p>

<p>"If you'll excuse my harping on a disagreeable topic, old
chappie," said Larkom, as they strolled homewards along the beach,
"I think you would be wise to take some elementary
precautions."</p>

<p>"What sort?" asked Walker.</p>

<p>"Well, supposing you were traced to that barque, the Sappho, it
would be easy to communicate with her skipper when she comes to her
station at Half-Jack. Then they might ascertain that a gent named
Johnny Walker with a golden beard and a Wellington nose had been
put ashore at Adaffia. You're a fairly easy chappie to describe,
with that Romanesque boko, and fairly easy to recognize from a
description."</p>

<p>"But, damn it, Larkom! You're not suggesting that I should cut
off my nose, are you?"</p>

<p>"God forbid, dear boy! But you might cut off your beard and drop
Johnny Walker. A clean shave and a new name would make a world of
difference. No native would recognize you without your beard."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But a white police officer would spot me all
right. A clean shave and a different name wouldn't deceive
him."</p>

<p>"Not if he really meant business. But the local officials here
will be pretty willing to turn a blind eye. They are not keen on
arresting a white man with a parcel of niggers looking on. Lowers
the prestige of the race. If a constabulary officer came down here
to arrest a bearded man named Walker and found only a clean-shaved
covey of the name of Cook, he'd probably say that there was no one
here answering the description and go back perfectly satisfied with
his tongue in his cheek."</p>

<p>"Do you think he really would?"</p>

<p>"I do. At any rate, you may as well give the authorities a
chance; meet 'em half-way. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it is the reasonable thing to do. Very well, Larkom,
I will take your advice and turn myself into a bald-faced
stag&mdash;I noticed that you have some razors in the store. And as
to the name, well, I will adopt your suggestion in that, too.
'Cook' will do as well as any other."</p>

<p>"Better, old chap. Distinguished name. Great man, James Cook.
Circumnavigator; all round my hat."</p>

<p>"All the same," said Walker, alias Cook, "I fancy you are a
trifle over-optimistic. If an officer were sent down here with a
warrant, I think he would have to execute it if he could. He would
be running a biggish risk if he let himself be bamboozled."</p>

<p>"Well, dear boy," replied Larkom, "you do the transformation
trick and trust in Providence. It's quite likely that the local
authorities will make no move; and if a G.C.C. officer should turn
up and insist on mistaking James Cook for Johnny Walker, I daresay
we could find some way of dealing with him."</p>

<p>The other man smiled grimly. "Yes," he agreed. "I don't think
he'd mistake James Cook for Mary's little lamb."</p>

<p>As they entered the compound a quarter of an hour later, a
native rose from the kernel bag on which he had been seated, and
disengaging from the folds of his cloth a soiled and crumpled
letter, held it out to Larkom. The latter opened it with tremulous
haste and, having glanced through it quickly, emitted a long, low
whistle.</p>

<p>"Sacked, by jiggers!" he exclaimed, and handed the letter to his
guest. It was a brief document and came to the point without
circumlocution. The Adaffia factory was a financial failure,
"whatever it might have been under other management," and the firm
hereby dispensed with Mr. Larkom's services. "But," the letter
concluded, "as we are unwilling to leave a white man stranded on
the Coast, we hereby make over to you, in lieu of notice, the
factory and such stock as remains in it, the same to be your own
property; and we hope that you will be able to carry on the trade
to more advantage for yourself than you have for us."</p>

<p>"Devilish liberal of them," groaned Larkom, "for I've been a
rotten bad servant to the firm. But I shall never make anything of
it. I'm a regular waster, old chappie, and the sooner the
land-crabs have me, the better it will be for everyone." He lifted
the lid of a gin-case and dejectedly hoisted out a high-shouldered,
square-faced Dutch bottle.</p>

<p>"Stop this boozing, Larkom," said Cook, late Walker. "Pull
yourself together, man, and let us see if we can't make a do of
it." He spoke gently enough, with his hand on the other man's
shoulder, for the thought of his own wrecked life had helped him to
understand. It was not the mere loss of employment that had hit
Larkom so hard. It was the realization, sudden and complete, of his
utter futility; of his final irrevocable failure in the battle of
life.</p>

<p>"It's awfully good of you, old chap," he said dismally; "but I
tell you, I'm beyond redemption." He paused irresolutely and then
added: "However, we'll stow the lush for the present and talk
things over," and he let the bottle slip back into its compartment
and, shut down the lid.</p>

<p>But he was in no mood for talking things over, at present. The
sense of utter failure appeared to have overwhelmed him completely,
and, though he made no further attempt upon the gin-case that
evening, his spirits seemed to sink lower and lower until, about
ten o'clock, he rose from his chair and silently tottered off to
bed, looking pitiably frail and broken.</p>

<p>It was about two o'clock in the morning when Cook awoke to the
consciousness of a very singular noise. He sat up in bed to listen.
A strange, quick rattle, like the chatter of a jigsaw, came from
the rickety bed on which Larkom slept, and with it was mingled a
confused puffing that came and went in quick gusts.</p>

<p>"Anything the matter, Larkom?" he asked anxiously; and then, as
a broken mumble and a loud chattering of teeth came in reply, he
sprang from the bed and struck a match. A single glance made
everything clear. The huddled body, shaking from head to foot, the
white, pinched face, the bloodless hands with blue finger-nails,
clutching the scanty bed-coverings to the trembling chin, presented
a picture of African fever that even a newcomer could recognize.
Hastily he lit a candle, and, gathering up every rag that he could
lay hands on, from his own travelling-rug to the sitting-room
table-cloth, piled them on to his shivering comrade until the sick
man looked like a gigantic caddis worm.</p>

<p>After an hour or so the violence of the shivering fit abated;
gradually the colour returned to the white face until its late
pallor gave place to a deep flush. The heaped coverings were thrown
on the floor, the sufferer fidgeted restlessly about the bed, his
breathing became hurried, and presently he began to babble at
intervals, This state of affairs lasted for upwards of an hour.
Then a few beads of perspiration appeared on the sick man's
forehead; the chatterings and mumblings and broken snatches of song
died away, and, as the parched skin broke out into dewy moisture, a
look of intelligence came back to the vacant face.</p>

<p>"Cover me up, old chappie," said Larkom, turning over with a
deep sigh. "Air strikes chilly. Thanks, old fellow; let's have the
table-cloth, too. That's ripping. Now you turn in and get a bit of
sleep. Sorry to have routed you up like this." He closed his eyes
and at once began to doze, and Cook, creeping back to bed, lay and
watched him by the light of the flickering candle. Then he, too,
fell asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was broad daylight, and through the open door
he could see Larkom standing by the table in the sitting-room,
wrapped in the rug. The Fanti cook was seated at the table and the
solitary Kroo boy, who formed the staff of the factory, stood by
his supplementary chair, his eyes a-goggle with curiosity.</p>

<p>"Now, Kwaku," Larkom was saying, "you see that pencil mark.
Well, you take this pen and make a mark on top of it&mdash;so." He
handed the pen to the cook, who evidently followed the
instructions, for his tongue protruded several inches, and he
presently rose, wiping his brow. The Kroo boy took his place and
the ceremony was repeated, after which the two natives retired
grinning with pride.</p>

<p>"Gad, Larkom," exclaimed Cook, when he came out and joined his
host; "that dose of fever has taken the starch out of you. You
oughtn't to be up, surely?" He looked earnestly at his comrade,
shocked at the aspect of the pitiful wreck before him and a little
alarmed at the strange, greenish-yellow tint that showed through
the waxen pallor of the face.</p>

<p>"Shan't be up long, dear boy," said Larkom. "Just setting things
straight before I turn in for good. Now, just cast your eye over
this document&mdash;devil of a scrawl, but I expect you can make it
out." He took up a sheet of paper and handed it to Cook. The
writing was so tremulous as to be almost illegible, but with
difficulty Cook deciphered it; and its purport filled him with
astonishment. It read thus:</p>

<p>'This is the last will and testament of me John Larkom of
Adaffia in the Gold Coast Colony, West Africa. I give and devise
all my estate and effects, real and personal, which I may die
possessed of or be entitled to, unto James Cook absolutely, and I
appoint him the executor of this my will.</p>

<p>'Dated this thirteenth day of November one thousand eight
hundred and ninety-seven.</p>

<p>'Signed by the testator in the presence of us, who thereupon
made our marks in his and each other's presence.</p>

<p>'JOHN LARKOM.</p>

<p>'Kwaku Mensah of Cape Coast. His + mark</p>

<p>'Pea Soup of Half-Jack. His + mark.'</p>

<p>"I've given you your new name, you see," Larkom explained. "Take
charge of this precious document and keep that letter from the
firm. Burn all other papers."</p>

<p>"But," exclaimed Cook, "why are you talking as if you expected
to snuff out? You've had fever before, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Rather," said Larkom. "But you're a new-comer; you don't sabby.
I'm an old coaster, and I sabby proper. Look at that, dear boy. Do
you know what that means?" He held out a shaking, lemon-coloured
hand, and as his companion regarded it silently, he continued:</p>

<p>"That means blackwater fever; and when a Johnny like me goes in
for that luxury, it's a job for the gardener. And talking of that,
you'd better plant me in the far corner of the compound where the
empty casks are kept, by the prickly-pear hedge; I shall be out of
the way of traffic there, though graves are a damned nuisance in
business premises, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh, dry up, Larkom, and get to bed," growled Cook; "and, I say,
aren't there any doctors in this accursed place?"</p>

<p>Larkom grinned. "In the fossil state, dear boy, they are quite
numerous. Otherwise scarce. The medico up at Quittah died three
days ago, as I told you, and there are no others on tap just now.
No good to me if they were. Remember what I've told you. Burn all
papers and, when you've planted me, take over the factory and make
things hum. There's a living to be made here and you'll make it.
Leave the swizzle-stick alone, old chappie, and if ever you should
chance to meet Hepburn again, give him my love and kick
him&mdash;kick him hard. Now I'm going to turn in."</p>

<p>Larkom's forecast of the probable course of his illness bid fair
to turn out correct. In the intervals of business&mdash;which,
perversely enough, was unusually brisk on this day&mdash;Cook
looked in on the invalid and at each visit found him visibly
changed for the worse. The pale-lemon tint of his skin gave place
to a horrible dusky yellow; his voice grew weaker and his mind more
clouded, until at last he sank into a partial stupor from which it
was almost impossible to rouse him. He wanted nothing, save an
occasional sip of water, and nothing could be done to stay the
march of the fell disease.</p>

<p>So the day passed on, a day of miserable suspense for Cook; the
little caravans filed into the compound, the kernels and copra and
knobs of rubber rolled out of the calabashes on to the ground, the
oil gurgled softly into the puncheon, the bush people chattered
vivaciously in the store and presently departed gleefully with
their purchases; and still Larkom lay silent and apathetic and ever
drawing nearer to the frontier between the known and the unknown.
The evening fell, the store was locked up, the compound gate was
shut, and Cook betook himself with a shaded lamp to sit by the sick
man's bed.</p>

<p>But presently the sight of that yellow face, grown suddenly so
strangely small and pinched, the sharpened nose, and the sunken
eyes with the yellow gleam of the half-seen eyeballs between the
lids, was more than he could bear, and he stole softly through into
the sitting-room, there to continue his vigil. So hour after weary
hour passed. The village sank to rest (for it was a moonless night)
and the sounds that came in through the open window were those of
beast and bird and insect. Bats whistled out in the darkness,
cicadas and crickets chirred and chirruped, the bark of the genet
and the snuffling mutter of prowling civets came from without the
compound, while far away the long-drawn, melancholy cry of a hyena
could be heard in the intervals of the booming surf.</p>

<p>And all the while the sick man slowly drew nearer to the dread
frontier.</p>

<p>It wanted but an hour to dawn when a change came. The feeble
babblings and mumblings, the little snatches of forgotten songs
chanted in a weak, quavering treble, had ceased for some time, and
now through the open door came a new sound&mdash;the sound of slow
breathing mingled with a soft, moist rattling. The watcher rose
from his chair and once again crept, lamp in hand, into the
dimly-lighted room, there to stand looking down gloomily at the one
friend that Fate had left him. Larkom was now unconscious and lay
quite still, save the heaving chest and the rise and fall of the
chin with each breath.</p>

<p>Cook took put down the lamp, and, sitting down, gently took the
damp and chilly hand in his, while he listened, in agony at his own
helplessness, to the monotonous, rattling murmur that went on and
on, to and fro, like the escapement of some horrible clock.</p>

<p>By and by it stopped, and Cook fumbled at the tepid wrist; then,
after a pause, it began again with an altered rhythm and presently
paused again, and again went on; and so the weary, harrowing
minutes passed, the pauses growing ever longer and the rattling
murmur more and more shallow. At last there came a pause so long
that Cook leaned over the bed to listen. A little whispering sigh
was borne to his ear, then all was still; and when, after waiting
yet several minutes more, he had reverently drawn the gaudy
table-cloth over the silent figure, he went back to his chair in
the sitting room, there to wait, with grim face and lonely heart,
for the coming of the day.</p>

<p>The late afternoon sun was slanting eagerly over the palm-tops
as he took his way to the far corner of the compound that faced
towards the western beach. The empty barrels had been rolled away
and, in the clear space, close to the low prickly-pear hedge, a
smooth mound of yellow sand and a rough wooden cross marked the
spot where Larkom, stitched up in sacking in lieu of a coffin, had
been laid to rest. The cross had occupied most of Cook's scanty
leisure since the hurried burial in the morning (for trade was
still perversely brisk, despite the ragged house-flag half-mast on
the little flag-pole), and he was now going to put the finishing
touches to it.</p>

<p>It was a rude enough memorial, the upright from a board from one
of the long gun-crates, and the cross-piece formed by a new barrel
stave cut to the requisite length; and the lack of paint left it
naked and staring.</p>

<p>Cook laid down on the sand a box containing his
materials&mdash;a set of zinc stencil plates, used for marking
barrels and cases, a stencil brush, and a pot of thin black
paint&mdash;and sketched out lightly in pencil the words of the
inscription:</p>
<br>

<p class="sign">JOHN LARKOM 14th November 1897</p>
<br>

<p>Then he picked out a J from the set of stencil plates, dipped
the brush in the pot, and made the first letter, following it in
order with O, H, and N. Something in the look of the familiar
name&mdash;his own name as well as Larkom's&mdash;made him pause
and gaze at it thoughtfully, and his air was still meditative and
abstracted as he stooped and picked up the L to commence the
following word. Rising with the fresh plate in his hand, he
happened to glance over the low hedge along the stretch of beach
that meandered away to a distant, palm-clad headland; and then he
noticed for the first time a little group of figures that stood out
sharply against the yellow background. They were about half a mile
distant and were evidently coming towards the village; and there
was something in their appearance that caused him to examine them
narrowly. Four of the figures walked together and carried some
large object that he guessed to be a travelling hammock; four
others straggled some little distance behind; and yet three more,
who walked ahead of the hammock, seemed to carry guns or rifles on
their shoulders.</p>

<p>Still holding the plate and brush, Cook stood motionless,
watching with grim attention the approach of the little procession.
On it came, at a rapid pace, each step bringing it more clearly
into view. The hammock was now quite distinct and the passenger
could be seen lying in the sagging cloth; eight of the figures were
evidently ordinary natives while the other three were plainly black
men dressed in a blue uniform, wearing red caps and carrying rifles
and bayonets.</p>

<p>Cook stooped and dropped the plate back into the box, picking
out, in place of it, a plate pierced with the letter O. Dipping his
brush into the paint, he laid the plate over the pencilled L on the
cross and brushed in the letter. Quietly and without hurry, he
followed the O with an S, M, O, N, and D; and he had just finished
the last letter when an English voice hailed him from over the
hedge.</p>

<p>He turned and saw, a little distance away, a fresh-laced
Englishman in a quiet undress uniform and a cheese-cutter cap,
peering at him curiously from the top a sand-hill, at the base of
which stood the group of hammockmen and the three Hausas.</p>

<p>"There's a gate farther down," said Cook; and, as the officer
turned away, he dropped the plate that he was holding back into the
box, laid down the brush, and took up a camel's-hair pencil.
Dipping this into the paint-pot, he proceeded deliberately and with
no little skill to write the date in small letters under the name.
Presently the sound of footsteps was audible from behind. Cook
continued his writing with deliberate care and the footsteps drew
nearer, slowing as they approached. Close behind him they halted,
and a cheery voice exclaimed: "Good Lord! What a let-off!" and then
added, "Poor beggar! When did he die?"</p>

<p>"This morning, just before dawn," replied Cook.</p>

<p>"Phew!" whistled the officer. "He wasn't long getting his
ticket. But, I say, how did you know his name? I thought he called
himself Walker."</p>

<p>"So he did. But he wished his name to be put on his grave."</p>

<p>"Naturally," said the officer. "It's no use giving an alias at
the last muster. Well, poor devil! He's had rough luck, but perhaps
it's best, after all. It's certainly best for me."</p>

<p>"Why for you?" asked Cook.</p>

<p>"Because I've got a warrant in my pocket to arrest him for some
trouble at home&mdash;signed the wrong cheque or something of that
kind&mdash;and I wasn't very sweet on the job, as you may guess.
Blood's thicker than water, you know, and the poor chap was an
English gentleman after all. However, those black devils of mine
don't know what I have come for, so now nothing need be said."</p>

<p>"No." He looked round into the bluff, rosy face and clear blue
eyes of the officer and asked: "How did you manage to run him to
earth?"</p>

<p>"He was traced to Bristol and to the barque Sappho after she had
sailed. Then the Sappho was seen from Quittah to bring up here,
right off her station&mdash;she trades to Half-Jack&mdash;and, as
we were on the look-out, we made inquiries and found that a white
man had come ashore here. Good thing we didn't find out sooner.
Well, I'll be getting back to Quittah. I've just come down with a
new doctor to take over there. My name's Cockeram, assistant
inspector G.C.C. You're Mr. Larkom, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Won't you stop and have a cocktail?" asked Cook, ignoring the
question.</p>

<p>"No, thanks. Don't take 'em. H2O is the drink for this
country."</p>

<p>He touched his cap and sauntered to the gate, and Cook saw him
walk slowly up and down behind the hedge, apparently gathering
something. Presently he sauntered back into the compound looking a
little sheepish, and, as he came, twisting some blossoming twigs of
wild cotton into a kind of grommet and shelling the little
'prayer-beads' out of some Jequirity pods that he had gathered. He
walked up the sandy mound and, sprinkling the scarlet seeds in the
form of a cross, laid the loop of cotton-blossoms above it.</p>

<p>"It's a scurvy wreath," he said, gruffly, without looking at
Cook, "but it's a scurvy country. So long." He walked briskly out
of the compound and, flinging himself into the hammock, gave the
word to march.</p>

<p>The other looked after him with an unwonted softening of the
grim face&mdash;yet grimmer and more lean now that the beard was
gone&mdash;only resuming his writing when the little procession was
growing small in the distance. The date was completed now, but,
dipping his brush afresh, he wrote below in still smaller letters:
'Now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the
morning, but I shall not be.'</p>

<p>Then he picked up the box and went back into the house.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>III. &mdash; THE MUTINY ON THE
'SPEEDWELL'</h2>

<p class="first">For a man in search of quiet and retirement, the
village of Adaffia would seem to be an ideally eligible spot;
especially if the man in question should happen be under a rather
heavy cloud. Situated in a little known part of the Slave Coast,
many miles distant from any town or settlement where white men had
their abodes, it offered a haven of security to the Ishmaelite if
it offered little else.</p>

<p>Thus reflected John Osmond, late John Walker, and now 'Mr. James
Cook', if the need for a surname should arise. But hitherto it had
not arisen; for, to the natives, he was simply 'the white man' or
'mastah', and no other European had passed along the coast since
the day on which he had buried Larkom&mdash;and his own
identity&mdash;and entered into his inheritance.</p>

<p>He reviewed the short interval with its tale of eventless and
monotonous days as he sat smoking a thoughtful pipe in the shady
coconut grove that encompassed the hamlet, letting his thoughts
travel back anon to a more distant and eventful past, and all the
while keeping an attentive eye on a shabby-looking brigantine that
was creeping up from the south. It was not, perhaps, a very
thrilling spectacle, but yet Osmond watched the approaching vessel
with lively interest. For though, on that deserted coast, ships may
be seen to pass up and down on the rim of the horizon, two or
three, perhaps, in a month, this was the first vessel that had
headed for the land since the day on which he had become the owner
of the factory and the sole representative of European civilization
in Adaffia. It was natural, then, that he should watch her with
interest and curiosity, not only as a visitor from the world which
he had left, but as one with which he was personally concerned; for
if her people had business ashore, that business was pretty
certainly with him.</p>

<p>At a distance of about a mile and a half from the shore the
brigantine luffed up, fired a gun, hoisted a dirty red ensign, let
go her anchor, scandalized her mainsail, lowered her head-sails,
and roughly dewed up the square-sails. A fishing canoe, which had
paddled out to meet her, ran alongside and presently returned
shoreward with a couple of white men on board. And still Osmond
made no move. Business considerations should have led him to go
down to the beach and meet the white men, since they were almost
certainly bound for his factory; but other considerations
restrained him. The fewer white men that he met, the safer he would
be: for, to the Ishmaelite, every stranger is a possible enemy or,
worse still, a possible acquaintance. And then, although he felt no
distaste for the ordinary trade with the natives, he did not much
fancy himself standing behind a counter selling gin and tobacco to
a party of British shell-backs. So he loitered under the coconuts
and determined to leave the business transactions to his native
assistant, Kwaku Mensah.</p>

<p>The canoe landed safely through the surf; the two white men
stepped ashore and disappeared towards the village. Osmond refilled
his pipe and walked a little farther away. Presently a file of
natives appeared moving towards the shore, each carrying on his
head a green-painted gin-case. Osmond counted them&mdash;there were
six in all&mdash;and watched them stow the cases in the canoe.
Then, suddenly, the two white men appeared, running furiously. They
made straight for the canoe and jumped in; the canoe men pushed off
and the little craft began to wriggle its way cautiously through
the surf. And at this moment another figure made its appearance on
the beach and began to make unmistakable demonstrations of
hostility to the receding canoe.</p>

<p>Now, a man who wears a scarlet flannelette coat, green cotton
trousers, yellow carpet slippers, and a gold-laced smoking-cap is
not difficult to identify even at some little distance. Osmond
instantly recognized his assistant and strode away to make
inquiries.</p>

<p>There was no need to ask what was the matter. As Osmond crossed
the stretch of blown sand that lay between the palm-grove and the
beach, his retainer came running towards him, flourishing his arms
wildly and fairly gibbering with excitement.</p>

<p>"Dem sailor man, sah!" he gasped, when he had come within
earshot, "he dam tief, sah! He tief six case gin!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that those fellows didn't pay for that gin?" Osmond
demanded.</p>

<p>"No, sah. No pay nutting. Dey send de case down for beach and
dey tell me find some country cloth. I go into store to look dem
cloth, den dey run away for deir canoe. Dey no pay nutting."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mensah. We'll go on board and collect the money or
bring back the gin. Can you get a canoe?"</p>

<p>"All canoe go out fishing excepting dat one," said Mensah.</p>

<p>"Then we must wait for that one to come back," was the reply;
and Osmond seated himself on the edge of dry sand that overhung the
beach and fixed a steady gaze on the dwindling canoe. Mensah sat
down likewise and glanced dubiously at his grim-faced employer; but
whatever doubts he had as to the wisdom of the proposed expedition,
he kept them to himself. For John Osmond&mdash;like Father
O'Flynn&mdash;had a 'wonderful way with him'; a way that induced
unruly intruders to leave the compound hurriedly and rub themselves
a good deal when they got outside. So Mensah kept his own
counsel.</p>

<p>The canoe ran alongside the brigantine, and, having discharged
its passengers and freight, put off for its return shorewards. Then
a new phase in the proceedings began. The brigantine's head-sails,
which lay loose on the jib-boom, began to slide up the stays; the
untidy bunches of canvas aloft began to flatten out to the pull of
the sheets. The brigantine, in fact, was preparing to get under
way. But it was all done in a very leisurely fashion; so
deliberately that the last of the square-sails was barely sheeted
home when the canoe grounded on the beach.</p>

<p>Osmond wasted no time. While Mensah was giving the necessary
explanations, he set his shoulder to the peak of the canoe and
shoved her round head to sea, regardless of the cloud of spray that
burst over him.</p>

<p>The canoe-men were nothing loath, for the African is keenly
appreciative of a humorous situation. Moreover, they had some
experience of the white man's peculiar methods of persuasion and
felt a natural desire to see them exercised on persons of his own
colour&mdash;especially as those persons had been none too civil.
Accordingly they pushed off gleefully and plunged once more into
the breakers, digging their massive, trident-shaped paddles into
the water to the accompaniment of those uncanny hisses, groans, and
snatches of song with which the African canoe-man sweetens his
labour.</p>

<p>Meanwhile their passenger sat in the bow of the canoe, wiping
the sea water from his face and fixing a baleful glance on the
brigantine, as she wallowed drunkenly on the heavy swell. Slowly
the tack of the mainsail descended, and then, to a series of
squeaks from the halyard-blocks, the peak of the sail rose by stow
jerks. The canoe bounded forward over the great rollers, the hull
of the vessel rose and began to loom large above the waters, and
Osmond had just read the name 'Speedwell, Bristol' on her broad
counter, when his ear caught a new sound&mdash;the 'clink, clink'
of the windlass-pawl. The anchor was being hove up.</p>

<p>But the canoe-men had heard the sound, too, and, with a loud
groan, dug their paddles into the water with furious energy. The
canoe shot forward under the swaying counter and swept alongside,
the brigantine rolled over as if she would annihilate the little
craft, and Osmond, grasping a chain-plate, swung himself up into
the channel, whence he climbed to the bulwark rail and dropped down
on the deck.</p>

<p>The windlass was manned by six of the crew, who bobbed up and
down slowly at the ends of the long levers; a seventh man was
seated on the deck, with one of the gin cases open before him, in
the act of uncorking a bottle. The other five cases were ranged
along by the bulwark.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," said Osmond, whose arrival had been unnoticed
by the preoccupied crew; "you forgot to pay for that gin."</p>

<p>The seated man looked up with a start, first at Osmond and then
at Mensah, who now sat astride the rail in a strategic position
that admitted of advance or retreat as circumstances might suggest.
The clink of the windlass ceased, and the six men came sauntering
aft with expectant grins.</p>

<p>"What are you doin' aboard this ship?" demanded the first
man.</p>

<p>"I've come to collect my dues," replied Osmond.</p>

<p>"Have yer?" said the sailor. "You'll be the factory bug, I
reckon?"</p>

<p>"I'm the owner of that gin."</p>

<p>"Now that's where you make a mistake, young feller. I'm the
owner of this here gin."</p>

<p>"Then you've got to pay me one pound four."</p>

<p>The sailor set the bottle down on the deck and rose to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Look here, young feller," said he, "I'm goin' to give you a
valuable tip&mdash;gratis. You git overboard. Sharp. D'ye
hear?"</p>

<p>"I want one pound four," said Osmond, in a misleadingly quiet
tone.</p>

<p>"Pitch 'im overboard, Dhoody," one of the other sailors
counselled. "Send 'im for a swim, mate."</p>

<p>"I'm a-goin' to," said Dhoody, "if he don't clear out," and he
began to advance, crabwise, across the deck in the manner of a
wrestler attacking.</p>

<p>Osmond stood motionless in a characteristic attitude, with his
long legs wide apart, his hands clasped behind him, his gaunt
shoulders hunched up, and his chin thrust forward, swaying
regularly to the heave of the deck, and with his grim, hatchet face
turned impassively towards his adversary, presented a decidedly
uninviting aspect. Perhaps Dhoody appreciated this fact; at any
rate, he advanced with an ostentatious show of strategy and much
intimidating air-clawing. But he made a bad choice of the moment
for the actual attack, for he elected to rush in just as the
farther side of the deck was rising. In an instant Osmond's
statuesque immobility changed to bewilderingly rapid movement.
There was a resounding "Smack, smack"; Dhoody flew backwards,
capsizing two men behind him, staggered down the sloping deck,
closely followed by Osmond (executing a continuous series of
'postman's knocks' on the Dhoodian countenance), and finally fell
sprawling in the scuppers, with his head jammed against a
stanchion. The two capsized men scrambled to their feet, and, with
their four comrades, closed in on Osmond with evidently hostile
intentions. But the latter did not wait to be attacked. Acting on
the advice of the Duke of Wellington&mdash;whom, by the way, he
somewhat resembled in appearance&mdash;to 'hit first and keep on
hitting', he charged the group of seamen like an extremely
self-possessed bull, hammering right and left, regardless of the
unskilful thumps that he got in return, and gradually drove them,
bewildered by his extraordinary quickness and the weight of his
well-directed blows, through the space between the fore mast and
the bulwark. Slowly they backed away before his continuous
battering, hitting out at him ineffectively, hampered by their
numbers and the confined space, until one man, who had had the bad
luck to catch two upper cuts in succession, uttered a howl of rage
and whipped out his sheath-knife. Osmond's quick eye caught the
dull glint of the steel just as he was passing the fife-rail.
Instantly he whisked out an unoccupied iron belaying-pin, whirled
it over and brought it down on the man's head. The fellow dropped
like a pole-axed ox, and as the belaying-pin rose aloft once more,
the other five men sprang back out of range.</p>

<p>How the combat might have ended under other circumstances it is
impossible to say. Dhoody had disappeared&mdash;with a bloody scalp
and an obliterated eye; the man with the knife lay unconscious on
the deck with a little red pool collecting by his head; the other
five men had scattered and were hastily searching for weapons and
missiles, so far as was possible with this bloodthirsty Bedlamite
of a 'factory bug' flying up and down the deck flourishing a
belaying-pin. Their principal occupation, in fact, was in keeping
out of reach; and they did not always succeed.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shot rang out. A little cloud of splinters flew from
the side of the mainmast, and the five seamen ducked
simultaneously. Glancing quickly forward, Osmond beheld his late
antagonist, Dhoody, emerging from the forecastle hatch and taking
aim at him with a still smoking revolver. Now, the 'factory bug'
was a pugnacious man and perhaps over-confident, too. But he had
some idea of his limitations. You can't walk up twenty yards of
deck to punch the head of a man who is covering you with a
revolver. At the moment, Osmond was abreast of the uncovered main
hatch. A passing glance had shown him a tier of kernel bags
covering the floor of the hold. Without a moment's hesitation he
stooped with his hands on the coaming, and, vaulting over, dropped
plump on the bags, and then, picking himself up, scrambled forward
under the shelter of the deck.</p>

<p>The hold of the <i>Speedwell</i>, like that of most vessels of
her class, was a simple cavity, extending from the forecastle
bulkhead to that of the after-cabin. Of this the forward part still
contained a portion of the out ward cargo, while the homeward
lading was stowed abaft the main hatch. But the hold was two-thirds
empty and afforded plenty of room to move about.</p>

<p>Osmond took up a position behind some bales of Manchester goods
and waited for the next move on the part of the enemy. He had not
long to wait. Voices from above told him that the crew had gathered
round the hatch; indeed, from his retreat, he could see some of
them craning over the coamings, peering into the dark recesses of
the hold.</p>

<p>"What are yer goin' to do, Dhoody?" one of the men asked.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' below to finish the beggar off," was the reply in a
tone of savage determination.</p>

<p>The place of a ladder was supplied by wooden footholds nailed to
the massive stanchion that supported the deck and rested on the
kelson. Osmond kept a sharp eye on the top foothold, clambering
quickly on the closely packed bales to get within reach; and as a
booted foot appeared below the beam and settled on the projection,
he brought down his belaying-pin on the toe with a rap that
elicited a yell of agony and caused the hasty withdrawal of the
foot. For a minute or more the air was thick with execrations, and,
as Osmond crept back into shelter, an irregular stamping on the
deck above suggested some person hopping actively on one leg.</p>

<p>But the retreat was not premature. Hardly had Osmond squeezed
himself behind the stack of bales when a succession of shots rang
out from above, and bullet after bullet embedded itself in the
rolls of cotton cloth. Osmond counted five shots and when there
came an interval&mdash;presumably to reload&mdash;he ventured to
peer between the bales, and was able to see Dhoody frantically
emptying the discharged chambers of the revolver and ramming in
fresh cartridges, while the five sailors stared curiously into the
hold.</p>

<p>"Now then," said Dhoody, when he had re-loaded, "you just nip
down, Sam Winter, and see if I've hit him, and I'll stand by here
to shoot if he goes for yer."</p>

<p>"Not me," replied Sam. "You 'and me the gun and just pop down
yerself. I'll see as he don't hurt yer."</p>

<p>"How can I?" roared Dhoody, "with me fut hammered into a
jelly?"</p>

<p>"Well," retorted Sam, "what about my feet? D'ye think I can
fly?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Dhoody, contemptuously, "if you funk the job, I won't
press yer. Bob Simmons ain't afraid, I know. He'll go."</p>

<p>"Will he?" said Simmons. "I'm jiggered if he will! That bloke's
too handy with that pin for my taste. But I'll hold the gun while
you go, Dhoody."</p>

<p>Dhoody cursed the whole ship's company collectively and
individually for a pack of chicken-livered curs. But not one of
them would budge. Each was quite willing, and even eager, to do the
shooting from above; but no one was disposed to go below and 'draw
the badger'. The proceedings seemed to have come to a deadlock when
one of the sailors was inspired with a new idea.</p>

<p>"Look 'ere, mates," he said, oracularly; "'Tis like this 'ere:
'ere's this 'ere bloomin' ship with a nomicidal maniac in 'er 'old.
Now, none of us ain't a-goin' down there for to fetch 'im out. We
don't want our 'eds broke same as what 'e's broke Jim Darker's 'ed.
Contrarywise, so long as 'e's loose on this ship, no man's life
ain't worth a brass farden. Wherefore I says, bottle 'im up, I
says; clap on the hatch-covers and batten down. Then we've got 'im,
and then we can sleep in our bunks in peace."</p>

<p>"That's right enough, Bill," another voice broke in, "but you're
forgettin' that we've got a little job to do down below there."</p>

<p>"Not yet, we ain't," the other rejoined; "not afore we gets down
Ambriz way, and he'll be quiet enough by then."</p>

<p>This seemed to satisfy all parties, including even the ferocious
Dhoody, and a general movement warned Osmond that his incarceration
was imminent, For one moment he was disposed to make a last,
desperate sortie, but the certainty that he would be a dead man
before he reached the deck decided him to lie low. Many things
might happen before the brigantine reached Ambriz.</p>

<p>As the hatchcovers grated over the coaming and dropped into
their beds, the prisoner took a rapid survey of his surroundings
before the last glimmer of daylight should be shut out. But he had
scarcely time to memorize the geographical features of the hold
before the last of the hatch-covers was dropped into its place.
Then he heard the tarpaulin drag over the hatch, shutting out the
last gleams of light that had filtered through the joints of the
covers; the battens were dropped into their catches, the wedges
driven home, and he sat, in a darkness like that of the tomb.</p>

<p>The hold was intolerably hot and close. The roasting deck above
was like the roof of an oven. A greasy reek arose from the bags of
kernels, a strange, mixed effluvium from the bales of cotton cloth.
And the place was full of strange noises. At every roll of the
ship, as the strain of the rigging changed sides, a universal groan
arose; bulkheads squeaked, timbers grated, the masts creaked
noisily in their housings, and unctuous gurgles issued from the
tier of oil puncheons. It was clear to Osmond that this was no
place for a prolonged residence. The sweat that already trickled
down his face meant thirst in the near future, and death if he
failed to discover the tank or water-casks. A diet of palm kernels
did not commend itself; and, now that the hatch was covered, the
water in the bilge made its peculiar properties manifest. The
obvious necessity was to get out; but the method of escape was not
obvious at all.</p>

<p>From his own position Osmond's thoughts turned to the state of
the vessel. From the first, it had been evident to him that there
was something very abnormal about this ship. Apart from the lawless
behaviour of the crew, there was the fact that since he had come on
board he had seen no vestige of an officer. Dhoody had seemed to
have some sort of authority, but the manner in which the men
addressed him showed that he had no superior status. Then, where
was the 'afterguard'? They had not gone ashore. And there had been
enough uproar to bring them on deck if they had been on board.
There was only one reasonable conclusion from these facts, and it
was confirmed by Dhoody's proprietary air and by a certain brown
stain that Osmond had noticed on the deck. There had been a mutiny
on the <i>Speedwell</i>.</p>

<p>The inveterate smoker invokes the aid of tobacco in all cases
where concentrated thought is required. Osmond made shift to fill
his pipe in the dark, and, noting that his tobacco was low, struck
a match. The flame lighted up the corner into which he had crept
and rendered visible some objects that he had not noticed before;
and, at the first glance, any lingering uncertainty as to the state
of affairs on the <i>Speedwell</i> vanished in an instant. For the
objects that he had seen comprised a shipwright's auger, a caulking
mallet, and a dozen or more large wooden pegs cut to a taper at one
end.</p>

<p>The purpose of these appliances was unmistakable, and very
clearly explained the nature of the 'little job' that the sailors
had to do down below. Those rascals intended to scuttle the ship.
Holes were to be bored in the bottom with the auger and the plugs
driven into them. Then, when the mutineers were ready to leave, the
plugs would be pulled out, and the ship abandoned with the water
pouring into her hold. It was a pretty scheme, if not a novel one,
and it again suggested the question: Where were the officers?</p>

<p>Turning over this question, Osmond remembered that Dhoody had
gone to the forecastle to fetch his revolver. Then the crew would
appear to be still occupying their own quarters; whence it followed
that, if the officers were on board, they were probably secured in
their berths aft.</p>

<p>This consideration suggested a new idea. Osmond lit another
match and explored the immediate neighbourhood in the hope of
finding more tools; but there were only the auger and the mallet,
the pegs having probably been tapered with a sheath-knife. As the
match went out, Osmond quenched the glowing tip, and, picking up
the auger and mallet, though for the latter he had no present use,
began to grope his way aft. The part of the hold abaft the main
hatch had a ground tier of oil-puncheons, above which was stowed a
quantity of produce, principally copra and kernels in bags.
Climbing on top of this, Osmond crawled aft until he brought up
against the bulkhead that separated the cabin from the hold. Here
he commenced operations without delay. Rapping with his knuckles to
make sure of the absence of obstructing stanchions, he set the
point of the auger against the bulkhead, and, grasping the cross
lever, fell to work vigorously. It was a big tool, boring an inch
and a half hole, and correspondingly heavy to turn; but Osmond
drove it with a will, and was soon rewarded by feeling it give with
a jerk, and when he withdrew it, there was a circular hole through
which streamed the welcome daylight.</p>

<p>He applied his eye to the hole (which, in spite of the thickness
of the planking, afforded a fairly wide view) and looked into what
was evidently the cuddy or cabin. He could see a small, nearly
triangular table fitted with 'fiddles', or safety rims, between
which a big water-bottle slid backwards and forwards as the ship
rolled, pursued by a dozen or more green limes and an empty
tumbler&mdash;a sight which made his mouth water. Opposite was the
companion-ladder and at each side of it a door&mdash;probably those
of the captain's and mate's cabins. Above the table would be the
sky light, though he could not see it; but he could make out some
pieces of broken glass on the floor and one or two on the table;
and he now recalled that he had noticed, when on deck, that the
skylight glass was smashed.</p>

<p>Having made this survey, he returned to his task. Above the hole
that he had bored, he proceeded to bore another, slightly
intersecting it, and above this another, and so on; tracing a
continuous curved row of holes, each hole encroaching a little on
the next, and the entire series looking, from the dark hold, like a
luminous silhouette of a string of beads. It was arduous work, and
monotonous, but Osmond kept at it with only an occasional pause to
wipe his streaming face and steal a wistful look at the
water-bottle on the cabin table. No sign did he perceive there of
either officers or crew; indeed the latter were busy on deck, for
he had heard the clink of the windlass, and when that had ceased,
the rattle of running gear as the sails were trimmed. And meanwhile
the curved line of holes extended along the bulkhead and began to
define an ellipse some eighteen inches by twelve.</p>

<p>By the time he had made the twenty-fourth hole, a sudden
weakening of the light that came through informed him that the sun
was setting. He took a last peep into the cabin before the brief
tropic twilight should have faded, and was surprised to note that
the tumbler seemed to have vanished and that there appeared to be
less water in the bottle. Speculating vaguely on the possible
explanation of this, he fell to work again, adding hole after hole
to the series, guiding himself by the sense of touch when the light
failed completely.</p>

<p>The thirty-eighth hole nearly completed the ellipse, and was
within an inch of the first one bored. Standing back from the
bulkhead, Osmond gave a vigorous kick on the space enclosed by the
line of holes, and sent the oval piece of planking flying through
into the cabin. Passing his head through the opening, he listened
awhile. Sounds of revelry from the deck, now plainly audible, told
him that the gin was doing its work and that the crew were fully
occupied. He slipped easily through the opening, and, groping his
way to the table, found the water-bottle and refreshed himself with
a long and delicious draught. Then, feeling his way to the
companion-ladders he knocked with his knuckles on the door at its
port side.</p>

<p>No one answered; and yet he had a feeling of some soft and
stealthy movement within. Accordingly he knocked again, a little
more sharply, and as there was still no answer, he turned the
handle and pushed gently at the door, which was, however, bolted or
locked. But the effort was not in vain, for as he gave a second,
harder push, a woman's voice&mdash;which sounded quite near, as if
the speaker were close to the door&mdash;demanded "Who is
there?"</p>

<p>Considerably taken aback by the discovery of this unexpected
denizen of the mutiny-ridden ship, Osmond was for a few moments at
a loss for a reply. At length, putting his mouth near to the
keyhole (for the skylight was open and the steersman, at least, not
far away), he answered softly: "A friend."</p>

<p>The reply did not appear to have the desired effect, for the
woman&mdash;also speaking into the keyhole&mdash;demanded
sharply:</p>

<p>"But who are you? And what do you want?"</p>

<p>These were difficult questions. Addressing himself to the first,
and boggling awkwardly at the unaccustomed lie, Osmond
stammered:</p>

<p>"My name is&mdash;er&mdash;is Cook, but you don't know me. I am
not one of the crew. If you wouldn't mind opening the door, I could
explain matters."</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the kind," was the reply.</p>

<p>"There's really no occasion for you to be afraid," Osmond
urged.</p>

<p>"Isn't there?" she retorted. "And who said I was afraid? Let me
tell you that I've got a pistol, and I shall shoot if I have any of
your nonsense. So you'd better be off."</p>

<p>Osmond grinned appreciatively but decided to abandon the
parley.</p>

<p>"Is there anyone aft here besides you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Never you mind," was the tart reply. "You had better go back
where you came from."</p>

<p>Osmond rose with a grim smile and began cautiously to feel his
way towards the companion-steps and past them to the other door
that he had seen. Having found it and located the handle, he rapped
sharply but not too loudly.</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded a gruff voice from within.</p>

<p>Osmond turned the handle, and, as a stream of light issued from
the opening door, he entered hastily and closed it behind him. He
found himself in a small cabin lighted by a candle-lamp that swung
in gimballs from the bulkhead. One side was occupied by a bunk in
which reclined a small, elderly man, who appeared to have been
reading, for he held an open volume, which Osmond observed with
some surprise to be Applin's Commentary On the Book of Job. His
head was roughly bandaged and he wore his left arm in a primitive
sling.</p>

<p>"Well," he repeated, taking off his spectacles to look at
Osmond.</p>

<p>"You are the captain, I presume?" said Osmond.</p>

<p>"Yes. Name of Hartup. Who are you?"</p>

<p>Osmond briefly explained the circumstances of his arrival on
board.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the captain. "I wondered who was boring those holes
when I went into the cabin just now. Well, you've put your head
into a hornet's nest, young man."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Osmond "and I'm going to keep it there until I'm
paid to take it out."</p>

<p>The captain smiled sourly. "You are like my mate, Will Redford;
very like him you are to look at, and the same quarrelsome
disposition, apparently."</p>

<p>"Where is the mate now?"</p>

<p>"Overboard," replied the captain. "He got flourishing a revolver
and the second mate stabbed him."</p>

<p>"Is the second mate's name Dhoody?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But he's only a substitute. The proper second mate died up
at Sherbro, so I promoted Dhoody from before the mast."</p>

<p>"I take it that your crew have mutinied?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the captain, placidly. "There is over a ton of ivory
on board and two hundred ounces of gold dust in that chest that you
are sitting on. It was a great temptation. Dhoody began it and
Redford made it worse by bullying."</p>

<p>"Dhoody seems to be a tough customer."</p>

<p>"Very," said the captain. "A violent man. A man of wrath. I am
surprised that he didn't make an end of you."</p>

<p>"So is he, I expect," Osmond replied with a grin; "and I hope to
give him one or two more surprises before we part. What are you
going to do?"</p>

<p>The captain sighed. "We are in the hands of Providence," said
he.</p>

<p>"You'll be in the hands of Davy Jones if you don't look out,"
said Osmond. "They are going to scuttle the ship when they get to
Ambriz. Can I get anything to eat?"</p>

<p>"There is corned pork and biscuit in that locker," said the
captain "and water and limes on the cabin table. No intoxicants.
This is a temperance ship."</p>

<p>Osmond smiled grimly as a wild chorus from above burst out as if
in commentary on the captain's statement. But he made no remark.
Corned pork was better than discussion just now.</p>

<p>"You seem to have been in the wars," he remarked, glancing at
the skipper's bandaged head and arm.</p>

<p>"Yes. Fell down the companion; at least, Dhoody shoved me down.
I'll get you to fix a new dressing on my arm when you've finished
eating. You'll find some lint and rubber plaster in the medicine
chest there."</p>

<p>"By the way," said Osmond, as he cracked a biscuit on his knee,
"there's a woman in the next berth. Sounded like quite a ladylike
person, too. Who is she?"</p>

<p>The captain shook his head. "Yes," he groaned, "there's another
complication. She is a Miss Burleigh; daughter of Sir Hector
Burleigh, the Administrator or Acting Governor, or something of the
sort, of the Gold Coast."</p>

<p>"But what the deuce is she doing on an old rattle trap of a
windjammer like this?"</p>

<p>The captain sat up with a jerk. "I'll trouble you, young man,"
he said, severely, "to express yourself with more decorum. I am the
owner of this vessel, and if she is good enough for me she will
have to be good enough for you. Nobody asked you to come aboard,
you know."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Osmond. "Didn't mean to give offence.
But you'll admit that she isn't cut out for the high-class
passenger trade."</p>

<p>"She is not," Captain Hartup agreed, "and that is what I pointed
out to the young woman when she asked for a passage from Axim to
Accra. I told her we had no accommodation for females, but she just
giggled and said that didn't matter. She is a very self-willed
young woman."</p>

<p>"But why didn't she take a passage on a steamer?"</p>

<p>"There was no steamer due for the Leeward Coast. Her father, Sir
Hector, tried to put her off; but she would have her own way. Said
it would be a bit of an adventure; travelling on a sailing
ship."</p>

<p>"Gad! She was right there," remarked Osmond.</p>

<p>"She was, indeed. Well, she came aboard and Redford gave her his
berth, he moving into the second mate's berth, as Dhoody remained
in the forecastle. And there she is; and I wish she was at
Jericho."</p>

<p>"I expect she does, too. What happened to her when the mutiny
broke out?"</p>

<p>"I told her to go to her berth and lock herself in. But no one
attempted to molest her."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that," said Osmond, and as he broke another
biscuit, he asked: "Did you secure the companion-hatch?"</p>

<p>"Miss Burleigh did. She fixed the bar across the inside of the
doors. But it wasn't necessary, for they had barricaded the doors
outside. They didn't want to come down to us, they only wanted to
prevent us from going up on deck."</p>

<p>"She was wise to bolt the doors, all the same," said Osmond; and
for a time there was silence in the cabin, broken only by the
vigorous mastication of stony biscuit.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>IV. &mdash; THE PHANTOM
MATE</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN he had finished his rough and hasty meal,
Osmond attended to his host's injuries, securing a pad of lint on
the lacerated arm with strips cut from a broad roll of the sticky
rubber plaster. Then he went out into the cabin to reconnoitre and
take a drink of water, closing the door of the captain's berth so
that the light should not be seen from above.</p>

<p>The hubbub on deck had now subsided into occasional snatches of
indistinct melody. The men had had a pretty long bout and
were&mdash;to judge by the tone of the songs&mdash;getting drowsy.
Osmond climbed on to the table and began carefully to pick the
remainder of the glass out of the skylight frame. The skylight had
a fixed top&mdash;there being a separate ventilator for the
cabin&mdash;and, instead of the usual guard-bars, had loose wood
shutters for use in bad weather. Hence the present catastrophe; and
hence, when Osmond had picked away the remains of the glass, there
was a clear opening through which he could, by hoisting himself up,
thrust out his head and shoulders. To avoid this fatiguing
position, however, he descended and placed on the table a case that
he had noticed by daylight on a side-locker; then, mounting, he was
able, by standing on this, to look out at his ease, and yet pop
down out of sight if necessary.</p>

<p>When he cautiously thrust out his head to look up and down the
deck, he was able at first to see very little, though there was now
a moderate starlight. Forward, whence drowsy mumblings mingled with
snores came from the neighbourhood of the caboose, he could see
only a projecting pair of feet; and aft, where a single voice
carolled huskily intervals, his view was cut off by the
boat&mdash;which lay at the side of the deck&mdash;and by the hood
of the companion-hatch. He craned out farther; and now he could
catch a glimpse of the man at the wheel. The fellow was not taking
his duties very seriously, for he was seated on the grating
unhandily filling his pipe and letting the ship steer herself;
which she did well enough, if direction was of no consequence, the
light breeze being a couple of points free and the main-sheet well
slacked out. Osmond watched the man light his pipe, recognizing
then the flat, shaven face&mdash;which he had punched earlier in
the day&mdash;and as he watched he rapidly reviewed the strategic
position and considered its possibilities. The flat, shaven face,
with its wide mouth, offered a vague suggestion. He considered;
looked out again; listened awhile; and then descended with a
distinctly purposeful air. First he crept silently up the steps of
the companion and softly removed the bar from the inside of the
doors. Then he made his way to the skipper's cabin.</p>

<p>As he entered, the "old man" looked up from his book
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I've come down for a bit of rubber plaster," said Osmond.</p>

<p>The skipper nodded towards the medicine-chest and resumed his
studies, while Osmond cut off a strip of plaster some seven inches
by four.</p>

<p>"You haven't got any thin rope or small-stuff in here, I
suppose?" said Osmond.</p>

<p>"There's a coil of rope-yarn on the peg under those
oilskins&mdash;those smart yellow ones; those were poor Redford's.
He was too much of a dandy to wear common black oilies like the
rest of us. What do you want the stuff for?"</p>

<p>"I want to try a little experiment," replied Osmond. "But I'll
tell you about it afterwards."; and he took down the oilskins and
the coil of line, the latter of which he carried away with him to
the main cabin together with the roll of plaster and the scissors.
Here, by the faint starlight that now mitigated the darkness, he
cut off a couple of lengths of the line and, having pocketed one
and made a bowline-knot or fixed loop in the end of the other,
ascended the table and once more looked out on deck. Save for some
resonant snoring from forward, all was quiet and the ship seemed to
have settled down for the night. The helmsman, however, was still
awake, for Osmond heard him yawn wearily; but he had left the wheel
with a rope hitched round one of the spokes, and was now leaning
over the quarter-rail, apparently contemplating the passing
water.</p>

<p>It was an ideal opportunity. Grasping the frame of the skylight,
Osmond gave a light spring and came through the opening like a very
stealthy harlequin. Then, creeping along the deck in the shelter of
the boat and that of the companion-hood, he rose and stole
noiselessly on the toes of his rubber-soled shoes towards the
preoccupied seaman. Nearer and nearer he crept, grasping an end of
the line between the fingers of either hand, and holding the strip
of plaster spread out on the palm of the left, until he stood close
behind his quarry. Then, as the sailor removed his pipe to emit
another enormous yawn, he slipped his left hand round, clapped the
plaster over the open mouth, and instantly pinioned the man's arms
by clasping him tightly round the chest. The fellow struggled
furiously and would have shouted, but was only able to utter
muffled grunts and snorts through his nose. His arms were gripped
to his sides as if in a vice and his efforts to kick were all
foreseen and adroitly frustrated. He had been taken by surprise by
a man who was his superior in mere strength and who was an expert
wrestler into the bargain; and he was further handicapped by
superstitious terror and lack of breath.</p>

<p>The struggle went on with surprisingly little noise&mdash;since
the sailor could not cry out&mdash;and meanwhile Osmond contrived
to pass the end of the line through the loop of the bowline and
draw it inch by inch until it was ready for the final pull. Then,
with a skilful throw, he let the man down softly, face downwards,
on the deck; jerked the line tight and sat on his prisoner's legs.
He was now master of the situation. Taking another turn with the
line round the man's body, he secured it with a knot in the middle
of the back, and with the other length of line, which he had in his
pocket, he lashed his captive's ankles together.</p>

<p>The almost noiseless struggle had passed unnoticed by the
sleepers forward. No watch or look-out had been set and it had
apparently been left to the helmsman to rouse up his relief when he
guessed his "trick" at the wheel to have expired. Osmond listened
for a few moments, and then, removing the batten with which the
doors of the companion had been secured on the outside, opened the
hatch, slid his helpless prisoner down the ladder; closed the doors
again, replaced the batten, and, creeping through the opening of
the sky light, let himself down into the cabin. Here he seized his
writhing captive, and, dragging him across the cabin, thrust him
head-first through the hole in the bulkhead and followed him into
the hold, where he finally deposited him as comfortably as possible
on the kernel bags under the main hatch.</p>

<p>"Now, listen," he said, sternly. "I'm going to take that plaster
off your mouth; but if you utter a sound, I shall stick it on again
and fix it with a lashing." He peeled the plaster off, and, as the
man drew a long breath, he demanded: "Do you hear what I say?</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply; "I hear. You've got me, governor, fair on
the hop, you have. You won't hear no more of me. And if you can cop
that there Dhoody the same way, there won't be no more trouble on
this ship."</p>

<p>"I'll see what can be done," said Osmond; and with this he
returned into the cabin, and, cutting off two fresh lengths of
rope-yarn and another piece of plaster, prepared for a fresh
capture.</p>

<p>But, at present, there was no one to capture. The wheel jerked
to and fro in its lashing, the brigantine walloped along quietly
before the soft breeze, the crew slumbered peacefully forward, and
Osmond looked out of the skylight on an empty deck, listening
impatiently to the chorus of snores and wondering if he would get
another chance.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say how long this state of affairs would
have lasted if nothing had happened to disturb it. As it was, a
sudden accident dispelled the universal repose. The unsteered
vessel, yawing from side to side, lifted her stern to a following
sea and yawed so far that her mainsail got by the lee. The long
boom swung inboard and the big sail jibed over with a slam that
shook the entire fabric. The vessel immediately broached to with
all her square-sails aback, and heeled over until the water bubbled
up through her scupper holes.</p>

<p>The noise and the jar roused some of the sleepers forward and a
hoarse voice bawled out angrily: "Now you, Sam! What the devil are
you up to? You'll have the masts overboard if you don't look
out."</p>

<p>Immediately after, Dhoody came staggering aft along the sloping
deck, followed by one or two bewildered sailors. The group stood
gazing in muddled surprise at the untended wheel, and Dhoody
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Where's the beggar gone to? Here, you Sam! Where are you?"</p>

<p>"P'raps he's gone down to the cabin," one of the men
suggested.</p>

<p>"No, he ain't," said Dhoody. "The companion's fastened up."</p>

<p>"So it is, mate," agreed the other with a glance at the battened
doors; and the party rambled slowly round the poop, peering out
into the darkness astern and speculating vaguely on the strange
disappearance.</p>

<p>"He's gone overboard," said Dhoody; "that's what he's done. So
you'd better take the wheel now, Bob Simmons; and you just mind yer
helm, or you'll be goin' overboard, too, with all that lush in yer
'ed."</p>

<p>Accordingly Simmons, protesting sleepily that it "wasn't his
trick yet," took his place at the wheel. The vessel was put once
more on her course, and the men, with the exception of Dhoody,
crawled forward to the shelter of the caboose. The second mate
remained awhile, yawning drearily and impressing on the somnolent
Simmons the responsibilities of his position. Then, at last, he too
went forward, and the ship settled down to its former quiet.</p>

<p>Osmond waited for some time in case Dhoody should return to see
that the new helmsman was attending to his instructions; but as he
made no reappearance and was now probably asleep, it seemed safe to
resume operations. Osmond thrust his head and shoulders out through
the opening, but, though he could see that the wheel was already
deserted, the unfaithful Simmons was invisible. Presently, however,
a soft snore from somewhere close by invited him to further
investigation, and as he crept out on deck, the enormity of
Simmons's conduct was revealed. He had not sunk overpowered at his
post, but had deliberately seated himself on the deck in a
comfortable position with his back against the doors of the
companion, where he now reclined at his ease, wrapped in alcoholic
slumber. If only Dhoody would keep out of the way, the capture was
as good as made.</p>

<p>Osmond stole up to the sleeping seaman and softly encircled his
arms with the noose, leaving it slack with the end handy for the
final pull. Then he put the man's feet together, and passing the
lashing round the ankles, secured it firmly. This aroused the
sleeper, who began to mumble protests. Instantly, Osmond slapped
the plaster on his mouth, jerked the arm-lashing tight and secured
it with a knot; unbattened the doors, and, opening them, slid the
wriggling captive down the ladder on to the cabin floor. Then he
came up, closed and re-battened the doors, slipped down through the
skylight, and, dragging his prisoner to the bulkhead, bundled him
neck and crop through the opening and finally deposited him on the
kernel-bags beside the other man, who was now slumbering
peacefully. Having removed the plaster, he remained awhile, for
Simmons was in no condition to give promises of good behaviour; but
in a few minutes he gave what was more reassuring, a good healthy
snore; on which Osmond departed, leaving him to sleep the sleep of
the drunk.</p>

<p>The capture had been made none too soon. As Osmond came through
into the cabin, he was aware of voices on deck, and, climbing on to
the table, put his head up to listen, but keeping carefully out of
sight.</p>

<p>"It's a dam rum go," a hoarse voice exclaimed. "Seems as if
there was somethink queer about this bloomin' ship. First of all
this factory devil comes aboard like a roarin' lion seekin' who he
can bash on the 'ed; then Sam goes overboard; then Bob Simmons goes
overboard. 'Tain't nateral, I tell yer. There's somethink queer,
and it's my belief as it's all along o' this mutiny."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, Bill," growled Dhoody.</p>

<p>"Bill's right, though," said another voice. "We ain't 'ad no
luck since we broke out. I'm for chuckin' this Ambriz job and
lettin' the old man out."</p>

<p>"And what about Redford?" demanded Dhoody.</p>

<p>"Redford ain't no affair of mine," was the sulky reply; to which
Dhoody rejoined in terms that cannot, in the interests of public
morality, be literally recorded; concluding with the remark that
'if he'd got to swing, it wouldn't be for Redford only'.</p>

<p>"Then," said the first speaker, "you'd better take the wheel
yerself. I ain't goin' to."</p>

<p>"More ain't I," said another. "I don't want to go
overboard."</p>

<p>A prolonged wrangle ensued, the upshot of which was that the men
drifted away forward, leaving Dhoody to steer the ship.</p>

<p>Osmond quietly renewed his preparations, though he realized that
a considerably tougher encounter loomed ahead. Dhoody was not only
less drunk than the others; he was a good deal more alert and
intelligent and he probably had a revolver in his pocket. And the
other men would now be more easily roused after this second
catastrophe. He peeped out from time to time, always finding Dhoody
wide awake at his post, and sensible of drowsy conversation from
the sailors forward.</p>

<p>It was fully an hour before a chance seemed to present itself;
and Osmond was too wary to attack blindly without a chance. By that
time the mumblings from forward had subsided into snores and the
ship was once more wrapped in repose. Looking out at that moment,
he saw Dhoody staring critically aloft, as if dissatisfied with the
trim of the sails. Presently the second mate stepped away from the
wheel, and, casting off one of the lee braces, took a long pull at
the rope. Now was the time for action. Slipping out through the
skylight, Osmond stole quickly along in the shelter of the boat,
and, emerging behind Dhoody, stood up just as the latter stooped to
belay the rope. He waited until his quarry had set a half-hitch on
the last turn and rose to go back to the wheel; then he sprang at
him, clapped the plaster on his mouth, and encircled him with his
arms.</p>

<p>But Dhoody was a tough adversary. He was stronger, more sober,
and less nervous than the others. And he had a moustache, which
interfered with the set of the plaster, so that his breathing was
less hampered. In fact, Osmond had to clap his hand on it to
prevent the man from calling out; and thus it was that the
catastrophe befell. For as Osmond relaxed his bear-hug with one
arm, Dhoody wriggled himself partly free. In a moment his hand flew
to his pocket, and Osmond grabbed his wrist only just in time to
prevent him from pointing the revolver. Then followed a struggle at
the utmost tension of two strong men; a struggle, on Osmond's side,
at least, for dear life. Gripping the other man's wrists, he
watched the revolver, all his strength concentrated on the effort
to prevent its muzzle from being turned on him. And so the two men
stood for a space, nearly motionless, quite silent, trembling with
the intensity of muscular strain.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dhoody took a quick step backwards. A fatal step; for
the manoeuvre failed, and Osmond followed him up, pressing him
farther backward. The bulwark on the poop was comparatively low. As
Dhoody staggered against it with accumulated momentum, his body
swung outboard and his feet rose from the deck. It was impossible
to save him without releasing the pistol hand. He remained poised
for an instant on the rail and then toppled over; and as he
slithered down the side and his wrist slipped from Osmond's grasp,
the revolver discharged, blowing a ragged hole in the bulwark and
waking the echoes in the sails with the din of the explosion.</p>

<p>Osmond sprang back to the companion-hatch and crouched behind
the hood. There was no time for him to get back to the skylight;
indeed he hardly had time to unfasten the doors and drop on to the
ladder before the men came shambling aft, muttering and rubbing
their eyes. Quietly closing the doors, he descended to the cabin
and took up his old post of observation on the table.</p>

<p>"He's gone, right enough," said an awe-stricken voice, "and I
reckon it'll be our turn next. This is a bad look-out, mates."</p>

<p>There was a brief and dismal silence; then a distant report was
heard, followed quickly by two more.</p>

<p>"That's Dhoody," exclaimed another voice. "He's a-swimmin' and
makin' signals. What's to be done? We can't let 'im drownd without
doin' nothin '."</p>

<p>"No," agreed the first man, "we must have a try at pickin' 'im
up. You and me, Tom, will put off in the dinghy, while Joe keeps
the ship hove-to."</p>

<p>"What!" protested Joe. "Am I to be left alone on the ship with
no one but Jim Darker, and him below in his bunk?"</p>

<p>"Well, yer can't let a shipmate drownd, can yer?" demanded the
other. "And look here, Joe Bradley, as soon as you've got the ship
hove-to, you just fetch up the fo'c'sle lamp and show us a glim, or
we shall be goners, too. Now hard down with the helm, mate!"</p>

<p>Very soon the loud flapping of canvas announced that the ship
had come up into the wind, and immediately after the squeal of
tackle-blocks was heard. The <i>Speedwell</i> carried a dinghy,
slung from davits at the taffrail, in addition to the larger boat
on deck, and it was in this that the two men were putting out on
their rather hopeless quest.</p>

<p>Osmond rapidly reviewed the situation. Of the original seven men
one was overboard, two were in the hold, one was below in his bunk,
and two were away in the boat. There remained only Joe Bradley. It
would be pretty easy to overpower him and stow him in the hold; but
a yet easier plan suggested itself. Joe was evidently in a state of
extreme superstitious funk and the other two were in little better
case. He recalled the captain's remark as to his resemblance to the
dead mate and also the fact that Redford's oilskins were different
from any others on board. These circumstances seemed to group
themselves naturally and indicate a course of action.</p>

<p>He made his way to the captain's berth and, knocking softly and
receiving no answer, entered. The skipper had fallen asleep over
his book and lay in his bunk, a living commentary on the Book of
Job. Osmond took the oilskins from the peg, and, stealing back
silently to the cabin, invested himself in the borrowed raiment.
Presently a passing gleam of light from above told him that Joe was
carrying the fore castle lamp aft to 'show a glim' from the
taffrail. Remembering that he had left the companion hatch
unfastened, he ascended the ladder, and, softly opening one door,
looked out. At the moment, Joe was engaged in hanging the lamp from
a fair-lead over the stern, and, as his back was towards the deck,
Osmond stepped out of the hatch and silently approached him.</p>

<p>Having secured the lamp, Joe took a long look over the dark sea
and then turned towards the deck; and as his eyes fell on the tall,
oilskinned figure, obscurely visible in the gloom&mdash;for the
lamp was below the bulwark&mdash;he uttered a gasp of horror and
began rapidly to shuffle away backwards. Osmond stood motionless,
watching him from under the deep shade of his sou'-wester as he
continued to edge away backwards. Suddenly his heel caught on a
ring-bolt and he staggered and fell on the deck with a howl of
terror; but in another instant he had scrambled to his feet and
raced away forward, whence the slam of the forecastle scuttle
announced his retirement to the sanctuary of his berth.</p>

<p>More than a quarter of an hour elapsed before a hoarse hail from
the sea heralded the return of the boat.</p>

<p>"Joe ahoy! It's no go, mate. He's gone." There was a pause. Then
came the splash of oars, a bump under the counter, the sound of the
hooking on of tackles, and another hail.</p>

<p>"Joe ahoy! Is all well aboard?"</p>

<p>Osmond stepped away into the shadow of the main sail, whence he
watched the taffrail. Soon the two men came actively up the
tackle-ropes, their heads appeared above the rail, and they swung
themselves on board simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Joe ahoy!" one of them sang out huskily, as he looked blankly
round the deck. "Where are yer, Joe?" There was a brief silence;
then, in an awe-stricken voice, he exclaimed: "Gawd-amighty, Tom!
If he ain't gone overboard, too!"</p>

<p>At this moment the other man caught sight of Osmond, and,
silently touching his companion on the shoulder, pointed to the
motionless figure. Osmond moved a little out of the shadow and
began to pace aft, treading without a sound. For one instant the
two men watched as if petrified; then, with one accord, they
stampeded forward, and once more the forecastle scuttle slammed.
Osmond followed, and quietly thrusting a belaying-pin through the
staple of the scuttle, secured them in their retreat.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>V. &mdash; THE NEW
AFTERGUARD</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Captain Hartup, brusquely aroused from his
slumbers, opened his eyes and beheld a tall, yellow oilskinned
figure in his berth, the Book of Job faded instantly from his
memory and he scrambled from his bunk with a yell of terror. Then,
when Osmond took off his sou'-wester, he recognized his visitor and
became distinctly uncivil.</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean by masquerading in this idiotic
fashion?" he demanded angrily. "I don't want any of your silly
schoolboy jokes on this ship, so you please understand that."</p>

<p>"I came down," said Osmond, smothering a grin and ignoring the
reproaches, "to report progress. I have hove the ship to, but there
is no one at the wheel and no look-out."</p>

<p>The skipper stared at him in bewilderment as he crawled back
into his bunk. "What do you mean?" he asked. "You've hove the ship
to? Isn't there anybody on deck?"</p>

<p>"No. The ship is taking care of herself at the moment."</p>

<p>"Queer," said the skipper. "I wonder what Dhoody's up to."</p>

<p>"Dhoody is overboard," said Osmond.</p>

<p>"Overboard!" exclaimed the skipper, staring harder than ever at
Osmond. Then, after an interval of silent astonishment, he said
severely:</p>

<p>"You are talking in riddles, young man. Just try to explain
yourself a little more clearly. Do I understand that you have hove
my second mate overboard?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Osmond. "He went overboard by accident. But it was
all for the best;" and hereupon he proceeded to give the skipper a
somewhat sketchy account of the stirring events of the last few
hours, to which the latter listened with sour disapproval.</p>

<p>"I don't hold with deeds of violence," he said when the story
was finished, "but what you have done is on your own head. Where do
you say the crew are?"</p>

<p>"Two are in the hold and the other four in the fo'c'sle, bolted
in. They are all pretty drunk, but you'll find them as quiet as
lambs when they've slept off their tipple. But the question is,
what is to be done now. The men won't be any good for an hour or
two, but there ought to be someone at the wheel and some sort of
watch on deck. And I can't take it on until I have had a sleep.
I've been hard at it ever since I came on board yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yes," Captain Hartup agreed, sarcastically, "I daresay you
found it fatiguing, chucking your fellow-creatures overboard and
breaking their heads. Well, you had better take the second mate's
berth&mdash;the one Redford had&mdash;and I will go on deck and
keep a look out. But I can't do much with my arm in a sling."</p>

<p>"What about the lady?" asked Osmond. "Couldn't she hold on to
the wheel if you stood by and told her what to do?"</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed the skipper. "I had forgotten her. Yes, she
knows how to steer&mdash;in a fashion. She used to wheedle Redford
into letting her take a trick in his watch while he stood by and
instructed her; a parcel of silly philandering, really, but it
wasn't any affair of mine. I'd better go and rouse her up."</p>

<p>"Wait till I've turned in," said Osmond. "I am not fit to meet a
lady until I have had a sleep and a wash. If you will show me my
berth, I will go and cast the lashings off those two beggars in the
hold and then turn in for an hour or two."</p>

<p>The captain smiled sardonically but made no comment; and when
Osmond, furnished with a lantern, had visited the hold and removed
the lashings from the still slumbering seamen, he entered the tiny
berth that the skipper pointed out to him, closed the door, and,
having taken off his jacket and folded it carefully, and wound his
watch, blew out the candle in the lantern, stretched himself in the
bunk and instantly fell asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke, the gleam from the deck-light over his
head&mdash;the berth had no port-hole&mdash;informed him that it
was day. Reference to his watch showed the hour to be about
half-past eight; and the clink of crockery and a murmur of
voices&mdash;one very distinctly feminine&mdash;suggested that
breakfast was in progress.</p>

<p>Which, again, suggested that the conditions of life on board had
returned to the more or less normal.</p>

<p>Osmond sprang out of the bunk, and, impelled by hunger and
curiosity, made a lightning toilet with the aid of Redford's razor,
sponge, and brushes. There was, of course, no bath; but a 'dry'
rub-down in the oven-like cabin was a fair substitute. In a
surprisingly short time, with the imperfect means at hand, he had
made himself almost incredibly presentable and after a final 'look
over' in Redford's minute shaving-glass, he opened the door and
entered the cuddy.</p>

<p>The little table, roughly laid for breakfast, was occupied by
Captain Hartup and a lady, and a flat-faced seaman with a black eye
officiated as cabin steward. They all looked up as Osmond emerged
from his door and the sailor grinned a little sheepishly.</p>

<p>"Had a short night, haven't you?" said the captain. "Didn't
expect you to turn out yet. Let me present you to our passenger.
Miss Burleigh, this is Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cook," said Osmond, ready for the question this time.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cook, the young man I was telling you about."</p>

<p>Miss Burleigh acknowledged Osmond's bow, gazing at him with
devouring curiosity and marvelling at his cool, trim, well
appearance.</p>

<p>"I think," she said, "we had a brief interview last night, if
you can call it an interview when there was a locked door between
us. I am afraid I wasn't very civil. But you must try to forgive
me. I've been sorry since."</p>

<p>"There is no need to be," replied Osmond. "It was perfectly
natural."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it isn't mere remorse. I am so mad with myself for
having missed all the excitements. If I had only known! But, you
see, I had happened to look out of my door in the evening, hearing
a peculiar sort of noise, and then I saw somebody boring holes in
the partition, and of course I thought it was those wretches trying
to get into the cabin. Then, when I heard your voice, I made sure
it was Dhoody or one of those other ruffians, trying to entice me
out. And so I missed all the fun."</p>

<p>"Just as well that you did," said the captain. "Females are out
of place in scenes of violence and disorder. What are you going to
have, Mr. Cook? There's corned pork and biscuit and I think there's
some lobscouse or sea-pie in the galley, if the men haven't eaten
it all."</p>

<p>Osmond turned suddenly to the sailor, who instantly came to
'attention'.</p>

<p>"You're Sam Winter, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Aye, sir," the man replied, considerably taken aback by the
'factory bug's' uncanny omniscience. "Sam Winter it is, sir."</p>

<p>"How is Jim Darker?"</p>

<p>"He's a-doin' nicely, sir," replied Sam, regarding Osmond with
secret awe. "Eat a rare breakfast of lobscouse, he did."</p>

<p>"Is there any left?"</p>

<p>"I think there is, sir."</p>

<p>"Then I'll have some;" and, as the man saluted and bustled away
up the companion-steps, he seated himself on the fixed bench by the
table.</p>

<p>Captain Hartup smiled sourly, while Miss Burleigh regarded
Osmond with delighted amusement.</p>

<p>"Seem quite intimate with 'em all," the former remarked.
"Regular friend of the family. I suppose it was you who gave Winter
that black eye?"</p>

<p>"I expect so," replied Osmond. "He probably caught it in the
scrum when I first came on board. Did you have any trouble in
getting the men to go back to duty?"</p>

<p>"The men in the fo'c'sle wouldn't come out till daylight, and
the two men in the hold took a lot of rousing from their drunken
sleep. Of course, I couldn't get through that hole with my arm in
this sling, so I had to prod them with a boat-hook. It's a pity you
made that hole. Lets the smell of the cargo and the bilge through
into the cabin."</p>

<p>He looked distastefully at the dark aperture in the bulkhead and
sniffed&mdash;quite unnecessarily, for the air of the cuddy was
charged with the mingled aroma of bilge and kernels.</p>

<p>"Well, it had to be," said Osmond; "and it will be easy to cover
it up. After all, a smell in the cuddy is better than
sea-water."</p>

<p>Here Sam Winter was seen unsteadily descending the
companion-steps with a large enamelled-iron plate in his hands;
which plate, being deferentially placed on the table before Osmond,
was seen to be loaded with a repulsive-looking mixture of 'salt
horse', shreds of fat pork and soaked biscuit floating in a greasy
brown liquid.</p>

<p>"That's all there was left, sir," said he, transferring a small
surplus from his hands to the dorsal aspect of his trousers.</p>

<p>Osmond made no comment on this statement but fell-to on the
unsavoury mess with wolfish voracity, while the captain filled a
mug with alleged coffee and passed it to him.</p>

<p>"Who is at the wheel, Winter?" the captain asked.</p>

<p>"Simmons, sir," was the reply. "I woke him up again as I come
aft."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better go up and take it from him. Carry on till I
come up."</p>

<p>As Winter disappeared up the companionway Miss Burleigh uttered
a little gurgle of enjoyment. "Aren't they funny?" she exclaimed.
"Fancy waking up the man at the wheel! It's like a comic
opera."</p>

<p>The captain looked at her sourly as he tapped the table with a
piece of biscuit for the purpose of evicting a couple of fat
weevils; but he made no comment, and for a time the meal proceeded
in silence. The skipper was fully occupied with cutting up his
corned pork with one hand and in breaking the hard biscuit and
knocking out the weevils, while Osmond doggedly worked his way
through the lobscouse with the silent concentration of a famished
man, all unconscious of the interest and curiosity with which he
was being observed by the girl opposite him.</p>

<p>However, the lobscouse came to an end&mdash;all too
soon&mdash;and as he reached out to the bread-barge for a handful
of biscuit he met her eyes; and fine, clear, bright blue eyes they
were, sparkling with vivacity and humour. She greeted his glance
with an affable smile and hoped that he was feeling revived.</p>

<p>"That looked rather awful stuff," she added.</p>

<p>"It was all right," said he, "only there wasn't enough of it.
But I hope you had something more suitable."</p>

<p>"She has had what the ship's stores provide, like the rest of
us," snapped the captain. "This is not a floating hotel."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't," Osmond agreed, "and that's a fact. But it is
something that she still floats; and it would be just as well to
keep her floating."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded the skipper.</p>

<p>Osmond thoughtfully extracted a weevil with the prong of his
fork as he replied: "You've got a crew of six, three to a watch,
and one of them has got to do the cooking. But you have got no
officers."</p>

<p>"Well, I know that," said the captain. "What about it?"</p>

<p>"You can't carry on without officers."</p>

<p>"I can and I shall. I shall appoint one of the men to be mate
and take the other watch myself."</p>

<p>"That won't answer," said Osmond. "There isn't a man among them
who could be trusted or who is up to the job; and you are not in a
fit state to stand regular watches."</p>

<p>Captain Hartup snorted. "Don't you lay down the law to me, young
man. I am the master of this ship." And then he added, a little
inconsistently "Perhaps you can tell me how I am to get a couple of
officers."</p>

<p>"I can," replied Osmond. "There will have to be some responsible
person on deck with each watch."</p>

<p>"Well?</p>

<p>"Well, there are two responsible persons sitting at this table
with you."</p>

<p>For a few moments the captain stared at Osmond in speechless
astonishment (while Miss Burleigh murmured "Hear, hear!" and rapped
the table with the handle of her knife). At length he burst out:
"What! Do I understand you to suggest that I should navigate this
vessel with a landsman and a female as my mates?"</p>

<p>"I am not exactly a landsman," Osmond replied. "I am an
experienced yachtsman and I have made a voyage in a sailing
ship."</p>

<p>"Pah!" exclaimed the skipper. "Fresh-water sailor and a
passenger! Don't talk nonsense. And a female, too!"</p>

<p>"What I am suggesting," Osmond persisted calmly, "is that you
should be about as much as is possible in your condition and that
Miss Burleigh and I should keep an eye on the men when you are
below. I could take all the night watches and Miss Burleigh could
be on deck during the day."</p>

<p>"That's just rank foolishness," said the skipper. "Talk of a
comic opera! Why, you are wanting to turn the ship into a Punch and
Judy show! I've no patience to listen to you," and the captain rose
in dudgeon and crawled&mdash;not without difficulty&mdash;up the
companion-steps. Miss Burleigh watched him with a mischievous
smile, and as his stumbling feet disappeared she turned to
Osmond.</p>

<p>"What a lark it would be!" she exclaimed, gleefully. "Do you
think you will be able to persuade him? He is rather an obstinate
little man."</p>

<p>"The best way with obstinate people," replied Osmond, "is to
assume that they have agreed, and carry on. Can you steer&mdash;not
that you need, being an officer. But you ought to know how to."</p>

<p>"I can steer by the compass. But I don't know much about the
sails excepting that you have to keep the wind on the right side of
them."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is important with a square vessel. But you will soon
learn the essentials&mdash;enough to enable you to keep the crew
out of mischief. We will go on deck presently and then I will show
you the ropes and explain how the gear works."</p>

<p>"That will be jolly," said she. "But there's another thing that
I want you to explain: about this mutiny, you know. Captain Hartup
was awfully muddled about it. I want to know all that happened
while I was locked in my berth."</p>

<p>"I expect you know all about it now," Osmond replied evasively.
"There was a bit of a rumpus, of course, but as soon as Dhoody was
overboard it was all plain sailing."</p>

<p>"Now, you are not going to put me off like that," she said, in a
resolute tone. "I want the whole story in detail, if you please,
sir. Does a second mate say 'sir' when he, or she, addresses the
first mate?"</p>

<p>"Not as a rule," Osmond replied, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Then I won't. But I want the story. Now." Osmond looked
uneasily into the delicately fair, slightly freckled face and
thought it, with its crown of red-gold hair, the prettiest face
that he had ever seen. But it was an uncommonly determined little
face, all the same.</p>

<p>"There really isn't any story," he began. But she interrupted
sharply:</p>

<p>"Now listen to me. Yesterday there were seven ferocious men
going about this ship like roaring and swearing lions. To-day there
are six meek and rather sleepy lambs&mdash;I saw them just before
breakfast. It is you who have produced this miraculous change, and
I want to know how you did it. No sketchy evasions, you know. I
want a clear, intelligible narrative."</p>

<p>"It isn't a very suitable occasion for a long yarn," he
objected. "Don't you think we ought to go on deck and keep an eye
on the old man?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps we ought," she agreed. "But I'm not going to let you
off the story, you know. That is understood, isn't it?"</p>

<p>He gave a reluctant assent, and when she had fetched her pith
helmet from her cabin and he had borrowed a Panama hat of
Redford's, they ascended together to the deck.</p>

<p>The scene was reminiscent of 'The Ancient Mariner'. The blazing
sun shone down on a sea that seemed to be composed of oil, so
smooth and unruffled was its surface. The air was absolutely still,
and the old brigantine wallowed foolishly as the great, glassy
rollers swept under her, her sails alternately filling and backing
with loud, explosive flaps as the masts swung from side to side,
and her long main-boom banging across with a heavy jar at each
roll. Sam Winter stood at the wheel in a posture of easy negligence
(but he straightened up with a jerk as Osmond's head rose out of
the companion-hood); the rest of the crew, excepting Jim Darker,
lounged about drowsily forward; and the skipper appeared to be
doing sentry-go before a row of green gin-cases that were ranged
along the side of the caboose. He looked round as the new-comers
arrived on deck, and pointing to the cases, addressed Osmond.</p>

<p>"These boxes of poison belong to you, I understand. I can't have
them lying about here."</p>

<p>"Better stow them in the lazarette when I've checked the
contents," replied Osmond.</p>

<p>"I can't have intoxicating liquors in my lazarette. This is a
temperance ship. I've a good mind to chuck 'em overboard."</p>

<p>"All right," said Osmond. "You pay me one pound four, and then
you can do what you like with them."</p>

<p>"Pay!" shrieked the captain. "I pay for this devil's elixir! I
traffic in strong drink that steals away men's reason and turns
them into fiends! Never! Not a farthing!"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Osmond, "then they had better go below. Here,
you, Simmons and Bradley, bear a hand with those cases. Will you
see them stowed away in the lazarette, Miss Burleigh?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," the latter replied, touching her helmet
smartly; whereupon the two men, with delighted grins, pounced upon
two of the cases, while Miss Burleigh edged up close to Osmond.</p>

<p>"What on earth is the lazarette?" she whispered, "and where
shall I find it?"</p>

<p>"Under the cuddy floor," he whispered in reply. "The trap is
under the table."</p>

<p>As the two seamen picked up their respective loads and went off
beaming, followed by Miss Burleigh, the captain stood gazing
open-mouthed. "Well, I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;sure!" he exclaimed, at
length. "What do you mean by giving orders to my crew? And I said I
wouldn't have that gin in my lazarette."</p>

<p>"Can't leave it about for the men to pinch. You'll have them all
drunk again. And what about the watches? We can't have the regular
port and starboard watches until you are fit again. Better do as I
suggested. Let me keep on deck during the night, and you take
charge during the day. Miss Burleigh can relieve you if you want to
go below."</p>

<p>"I'll have no women playing the fool on my ship," snapped the
skipper; "but as to you, I don't mind your staying on deck at night
if you undertake to call me up when you get into a mess&mdash;as
you certainly will."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Osmond, "we'll leave it at that. And now you'd
better come below and let me attend to your bandages. There's
nothing to do on deck while this calm lasts."</p>

<p>The skipper complied, not unwillingly; and when Osmond had very
gently and skilfully renewed the dressings and rebandaged the
injured arm and head&mdash;the captain reclining in his bunk for
the purpose&mdash;he retired, leaving his patient to rest awhile
with the aid of the Commentary On the Book of Job.</p>

<p>As soon as he arrived on deck, he proceeded definitely to take
charge. The stowage of the gin was now completed and the crew were
once more collected forward, gossiping idly but evidently watchful
and expectant of further developments from the 'after-guard.'
Osmond hailed them in a masterful tone. "Here, you men, get a pull
on the main-sheet and stop the boom from slamming. Haul her in as
taut as she'll go."</p>

<p>The men came aft with ready cheerfulness, and as Osmond cast off
the fall of the rope and gave them a lead, they tailed on and
hauled with a will until the sheet-blocks were as close as they
could be brought. Then, when the rope had been belayed, Osmond
turned to the crew and briefly explained the arrangements for
working the ship in her present, short-handed state.</p>

<p>"So you understand," he concluded, "I am the mate for the time
being, and Miss Burleigh is taking the duties of the second mate.
Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," was the reply, accompanied by the broadest of
grins, "we understands, sir."</p>

<p>"Who is the cook?" inquired Osmond.</p>

<p>"Bill Foat 'as been a-doin' the cookin', sir," Simmons
explained.</p>

<p>"Then he'd better get on with it. Whose watch on deck is
it?"</p>

<p>"Starboard watch, sir," replied Simmons; "that's me and Winter
and Darker."</p>

<p>"I must have a look at Darker," said Osmond. "Meanwhile you take
the wheel, and you, Winter, keep a look-out forward. I haven't
heard the ship's bell sounded this morning."</p>

<p>"No, sir," Winter explained. "The clock in the companion has
stopped and none of us haven't got the time."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Osmond. "I'll wind it up and start it when I
make eight bells."</p>

<p>The routine of the duties being thus set going, Osmond went
forward and paid a visit to the invalid in the forecastle, with the
result that Jim Darker presently appeared on deck with a clean
bandage and a somewhat sheepish grin. Then the chief officer turned
his attention to the education of his subordinate, observed
intently by six pairs of inquisitive eyes.</p>

<p>"I think, Miss Burleigh," he said, "you had better begin by
learning how to take an observation. Then you will be able to do
something that the men can't, as an officer should. Do you know
anything about mathematics?"</p>

<p>"As much as is necessary, I expect. I took second class honours
in maths. Will that do?"</p>

<p>"Of course it will. By the way, where did you take your
degree?"</p>

<p>"Oxford&mdash;Somerville, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Osmond, rather taken aback. "When were you up at
Oxford?"</p>

<p>She regarded him with a mischievous smile as she replied: "After
your time, I should say. I only came down a year ago."</p>

<p>It was, of course, but a chance shot. Nevertheless, Osmond
hastily reverted to the subject of observations. "It is quite a
simple matter to take the altitude of the sun, and you work out
your results almost entirely from tables. You will do it easily the
first time. I'll go and get Redford's sextant, or better still, we
might go below and I can show you how to use a sextant and how to
work out your latitude."</p>

<p>"Yes," she agreed eagerly, "I would sooner have my first lesson
below. Our friends here are so very interested in us."</p>

<p>She bustled away down to the cabin, and Osmond, following, went
into his berth, whence he presently emerged with two mahogany cases
and a portly volume, inscribed 'Norie's Navigation'.</p>

<p>"I've found the second mate's sextant as well as Redford's, so
we can have one each," he said, laying them on the table with the
volume. "And now let us get to work. We mustn't stay here too long
or we shall miss the transit."</p>

<p>The two mates seated themselves side by side at the table, and
Osmond, taking one of the sextants out of its case, explained its
construction and demonstrated its use. Then the volume was opened,
the tables explained, the mysteries of 'dip' refraction and
'parallax' expounded, and finally an imaginary observation was
worked out on the back of an envelope.</p>

<p>"I had no idea," said Miss Burleigh, as she triumphantly
finished the calculation, "that the science of navigation was so
simple."</p>

<p>"It isn't," replied Osmond. "Latitude by the meridian altitude
of the sun is the A B C of navigation. Some of it, such as
longitude by lunar distance, is fairly tough. But it is time we got
on deck. It is past eleven by my watch and the Lord knows what the
time actually is. The chronometer has stopped. The skipper bumped
against it when he staggered into his berth on the day when the
mutiny broke out."</p>

<p>"Then how shall we get the longitude?" Miss Burleigh asked.</p>

<p>"We shan't. But it doesn't matter much. We must keep on a
westerly course. There is nothing, in that direction, between us
and America."</p>

<p>The appearance on deck of the two officers, each armed with a
sextant, created a profound impression. It is true that, so far as
the 'second mate' was concerned, the attitude of the crew was
merely that of respectful amusement. But the effect, in the case of
Osmond, was very different. The evidence that he was able to 'shoot
the sun' established him in their eyes as a pukka navigator, and
added to the awe with which they regarded this uncannily capable
'factory bug'. And there was plenty of time for the impression to
soak in; for the first glance through the sextant showed that the
sun was still rising fairly fast; that there was yet some
considerable time to run before noon. In fact, more than half an
hour passed before the retardation of the sun's motion heralded the
critical phase. And at this moment the skipper's head rose slowly
above the hood of the companion-hatch.</p>

<p>At first his back was towards the observers, but when he emerged
and, turning forward, became aware of them, he stopped short as if
petrified. The men ceased their gossip to watch him with ecstatic
grins, and Sam Winter edged stealthily towards the ship's bell.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this play-acting and tom foolery?" the
skipper demanded, sourly. "Women and landsmen monkeying about with
nautical instruments."</p>

<p>Osmond held up an admonitory hand, keeping his eye glued to the
eyepiece of the sextant.</p>

<p>"I'm asking you a question," the captain persisted. There was
another brief silence. Then, suddenly, Osmond sang out "Eight
bells!" and looked at his watch. Winter, seizing the lanyard that
hung from the clapper of the bell, struck the eight strokes, and
the second mate&mdash;prompted in a hoarse whisper&mdash;called
out: "Port watch, there! Bradley will take the first trick at the
wheel."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir&mdash;Miss, I means," responded Bradley, and
proceeded purple-faced and chuckling aloud, to relieve the
gratified Simmons.</p>

<p>At these proceedings the captain looked on in helpless
bewilderment. He watched Osmond wind and set the clock in the
companion and saw him disappear below, followed by his accomplice,
to work out the reckoning, and shook his head with mute
disapproval. But yet to him, as to the rest of the ship's company,
there came a certain sense of relief. Osmond's brisk, confident
voice, the cheerful sound of the ship's bell, and the orderly
setting of the watch, seemed definitely to mark the end of the
mutiny and the return to a reign of law and order.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>VI. &mdash; BETTY MAKES A
DISCOVERY</h2>

<p class="first">For reasons best known to herself, Miss Burleigh
made no further attempt that day to satisfy her curiosity as to the
quelling of the mutiny. There was, in fact, little opportunity. For
shortly after the mid-day meal&mdash;sea-pie and corned pork with
biscuit&mdash;Osmond turned in regardless of the heat, to get a few
hours' sleep before beginning his long night vigil. But on the
following day the captain was so far recovered as to be able to
take the alternate watches&mdash;relieved to some extent in the
daytime by the second mate&mdash;and this left ample time for
Osmond to continue the education of his junior, which now extended
from theoretical navigation to practical seamanship.</p>

<p>It was during the afternoon watch, when the two mates were
seated on a couple of spare cases in the shadow of the main-sail,
practising the working of splices on some oddments of rope, that
the 'examination-in-chief' began; and Osmond, recognizing the
hopelessness of further evasion, was fain to tell the story of his
adventure, dryly enough, indeed, but in fairly satisfying detail.
And as he narrated, in jerky, colourless sentences, with his eyes
riveted on the splice that he was working, his spellbound listener
let her rope's-end and marlinspike lie idle on her lap while she
watched his impassive face with something more than mere
attention.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she said when the tale was told, "whether the men
realize who the spectre mate really was."</p>

<p>"I don't think they can quite make out what happened. But I
fancy they look upon me as something rather uncanny; which is all
for the best, seeing how short we are and what a helpless worm the
skipper is."</p>

<p>"Yes, they certainly have a holy fear of you," she agreed,
smiling at the grim, preoccupied face. She reflected awhile and
then continued: "But I don't quite understand what brought you on
board. You say that Dhoody had stolen those cases of gin. But what
business was that of yours?"</p>

<p>"It was my gin."</p>

<p>"Your gin? But you don't drink gin."</p>

<p>"No, I sell it. I am a trader. I run a store, or factory, as
they call it out here."</p>

<p>As Osmond made this statement, her look of undisguised
admiration changed to one of amazement. She smothered an
exclamation and managed to convert it at short notice into an
unconcerned "I see"; but her astonishment extinguished her powers
of conversation for the time being. She could only gaze at him and
marvel at the incongruity of his personality with his vocation. She
had encountered a good many traders, and though she had realized
that the 'palm-oil ruffian' was largely the invention of the
missionary and the official snob and that West African traders are
a singularly heterogeneous body, still that body did not ordinarily
include men of Osmond's class. And her sly suggestion of his
connection with Oxford had been something more than a mere random
shot. There are certain little tricks of speech and manner by which
members of the ancient universities can usually be recognized,
especially by their contemporaries and though Osmond was entirely
free from the deliberate affectations of a certain type of
''varsity' man, her quick ear had detected one or two turns of
phrase that seemed familiar. And he had not repudiated the
suggestion.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she said, after an interval of some what
uncomfortable silence, "what made you take to trading. The métier
doesn't seem to fit you very well."</p>

<p>"No," he admitted with a grim smile; "I am a bit of a mug at a
business deal."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that," she rejoined hastily. "But there are such
a lot of things that would suit you better. It is a sin for a man
of your class and attainments to be keeping a shop&mdash;for that
is what it amounts to."</p>

<p>"That is what it actually is," said he.</p>

<p>"Yes. But why on earth do you do it?"</p>

<p>"Must do something, you know," he replied, lamely.</p>

<p>"Of course you must, but it should be something suitable, and
selling gin is not a suitable occupation for a gentleman. And it
isn't as if you were a 'lost dog.' You are really extremely
capable."</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted with a grin, "I'm pretty handy in a
scrum."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," she admonished, severely. "I don't undervalue
your courage and strength&mdash;I shouldn't be a natural woman if I
did&mdash;but I am thinking of your resourcefulness and ingenuity.
It wasn't by mere thumping that you got your ascendancy over the
men. You beat them by sheer brains."</p>

<p>"Jim Darker thinks it was an iron belaying-pin."</p>

<p>"Now don't quibble and prevaricate. You know as well as I do
that, if it had been a matter of mere strength and courage, you
would never have got out of the hold, and we should have been at
the bottom of the sea by now. It was your mental alertness that
saved us all."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it," said Osmond. "But you aren't getting on
very fast with that splice. Have you been watching me?"</p>

<p>"Oh! bother the splices!" she exclaimed, impatiently. "I want
you to tell me why you are throwing yourself away on this
ridiculous factory."</p>

<p>"It isn't a bad sort of life," he protested. "I don't think I
mind it."</p>

<p>"Then you ought to," she retorted. "You ought to have some
ambition. Think of all the things that you might have
done&mdash;that you still might do with, your abilities and
initiative."</p>

<p>She looked at him earnestly as she spoke; and some thing that
she saw in his face as she uttered those last words gave her pause.
Suddenly it was borne in on her that she had met other men who
seemed to be out of their element; men who, report whispered, had
been driven by social misadventure&mdash;by debt, entanglements, or
drink&mdash;to seek sanctuary on the remote West Coast. Was it
possible that he might be one of these refugees? He was obviously
not a drinker and he did not look like a wastrel of any kind.
Still, there might be a skeleton in his cupboard. At any rate, he
was extraordinarily reticent about himself.</p>

<p>She changed the subject rather abruptly. "Is your factory in the
British Protectorate?"</p>

<p>"Yes. At Adaffia, a little, out-of-the-way place about a dozen
miles east of Quittah."</p>

<p>"I know it&mdash;at least I have heard of it. Isn't it the place
where that poor fellow Osmond died?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, a little startled by the question.</p>

<p>"What was he like? I suppose you saw him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A biggish man. Short moustache and Vandyke beard."</p>

<p>"Quite a gentlemanly man, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"He seemed to be. But he didn't have a great deal to say to
anybody."</p>

<p>"It was rather pathetic, his dying in that way, like a hunted ox
that has run into a trap."</p>

<p>"Well," said Osmond, "there wasn't much to choose. If the
climate hadn't had him, the police would."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure," she replied. "We all hoped he would get
away, especially the officer who was detailed to arrest him. I
think he meant to make a fussy search of all the wrong houses in
the village by way of giving notice that he was there and scaring
the fugitive away. Still, I think he was rather relieved when he
found that trader man&mdash;what was his name?&mdash;Larkin or
Larkom?&mdash;painting the poor fellow's name on the cross above
his grave. You heard about that, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Queer coincidence, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Don't be so callous. I think it was a most pathetic
incident."</p>

<p>"I suppose it was," Osmond agreed. "And now, don't you think you
had better have another try at that splice?"</p>

<p>With a little grimace she took up the piece of rope and began
obediently to unlay its ends and the interrupted course of
practical seamanship was resumed, with intervals of desultory
conversation, until eight bells, when the teapot was brought forth
from the galley and conveyed below to the cabin. After tea, through
what was left of the first dog-watch, there was another spell of
knots and splices; and then, when the sun set and darkness fell on
the sea, more desultory talk, in which Osmond mostly played the
role of listener, which&mdash;with an interval for
dinner&mdash;lasted until it was time for the second mate to turn
in.</p>

<p>So life went on aboard the <i>Speedwell</i> day after day.</p>

<p>The calm persisted as calms are apt to do in the Doldrums, with
nothing to suggest any promise of a change. Now and again, at long
intervals, the oily surface of the sea would be dimmed by a little
draught of air&mdash;just enough to 'put the sails asleep' and give
momentary life to the steering-wheel. But in a few minutes it would
die away, leaving the sails to back and fill as the vessel rolled
inertly on the glassy swell. The first observation had shown the
ship's position to be about four degrees north of the equator, with
the coast of the Bight of Benin some eighty miles away to the
north; and subsequent observations revealed a slow southerly drift.
It was pretty certain that she had a more rapid easterly drift on
the Guinea current, but as the chronometer was out of action, there
was no means of ascertaining this or of determining her longitude.
Sooner or later, if the calm continued, she would drift into the
Bight of Biafra, where she might pick up the land and sea breezes
or find an anchorage where she could bring up and get the
chronometer rated.</p>

<p>To a seaman there is nothing more exasperating than a prolonged
calm. The crew of the <i>Speedwell</i> were not sailors of a
strenuous type, but the inaction and monotony that prevailed on the
idly ship bored them&mdash;if not to tears, at least to bad
language and chronic grumbling. They lounged about with sulky looks
and yawned over the odd jobs that Osmond found for them, whistling
vainly for a breeze and crawling up the rigging from time to time
to see if anything&mdash;land or another ship&mdash;was in sight.
As to the captain, he grew daily more sour and taciturn as he saw
his stores of provisions dwindling with nothing to show for the
expenditure.</p>

<p>But by two of the ship company the calm was accepted with
something more than resignation. The two mates had no complaint
whatever to make. They were, indeed, cut off from all the world;
marooned on a stationary ship in an unfrequented sea. But they had
one another and asked for nothing better; and the longer the calm
lasted the more secure were they of the continuance of this happy
condition. For the inevitable thing had happened. They had fallen
in love.</p>

<p>It was very natural. Both were more than commonly attractive,
and circumstances had thrown them together in the closest and most
intimate companionship through every hour of the long days. They
had worked together, though the work was more than half play; they
had a common interest which kept them apart from the others.
Together they had sat, talking endlessly, in little patches of
shadow when the sun was high in the heavens, or leaned upon the
bulwark rail and watched the porpoises playing round the idle ship
or the Portuguese men-of-war gliding imperceptibly past on their
rainbow-tinted floats. They had paced the heaving deck together
when the daylight was gone and earnestly studied the constellations
'that blazed in the velvet blue', or peered down into the dark
water alongside where the Nautilus shone like submarine stars and
shoals of fish darted away before the pursuing dolphin lurid
flashes of phosphorescent light. No more perfect setting for a
romance could be imagined.</p>

<p>And then the personality of each was such as to make a special
appeal to the other. In the eyes of the girl, Osmond was a hero, a
paladin. His commanding stature, his strength, his mastery of other
men, and above all his indomitable courage, had captured her
imagination from the first. And in his rugged way he was a handsome
man; and if he could be a little brutal on occasion, he had always
been, to her, the soul of courtesy and chivalry. As to the 'past'
of which she had a strong suspicion, that was no concern of hers;
perhaps it even invested him with an added interest.</p>

<p>As to Osmond, he had been captivated at once, and, to do him
justice he had instantly perceived the danger that loomed ahead.
But he could do nothing to avoid it. Flight was impossible from
this little self-contained world, so pleasantly cut off from the
unfriendly world without; nor could he, even if he had tried, help
being thrown constantly into the society of this fascinating little
lady. And if, during the long, solitary night-watches, or in his
stifling berth, he gnashed his teeth over the perverseness of Fate
and thought bitterly of what might have been, that did not prevent
him from succumbing during the day to the charm of her frank,
unconcealed friendliness.</p>

<p>It was in the forenoon of the eighth day of the calm that the
two cronies were leaning on the rail, each holding a stout line.
The previous day Osmond had discovered a quantity of fishing tackle
among Redford's effects, and a trial cast had provided not only
excellent sport, but a very welcome addition to the ship's meagre
diet. Thereupon an epidemic of sea-angling had broken out on board,
and Bill Foat, the cook, had been kept busy with the preparation of
snappers, horse and other deep-sea fish.</p>

<p>"I wonder," the girl mused as she peered over the side, "how
much longer this calm is going to last."</p>

<p>"It may last for weeks," Osmond replied. "I hope it won't for
your sake. You must be getting frightfully bored."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I'm not," she rejoined. "It is the jolliest holiday I
have ever had. The only fly in the ointment is the fear that my
father may be a little anxious about me. But I don't suppose he is
really worrying. He is like me&mdash;not much given to fussing and
he knows that I am fairly well able to take care of myself, though
he doesn't know that I have got a Captain James Cook to stand by
me. But I expect you are getting pretty sick of this monotonous
life, aren't you, Captain J.?"</p>

<p>Osmond shook his head. "Not a bit," he replied. "It has been a
delightful interlude for me. I should be perfectly satisfied for it
to go on for the rest of my life."</p>

<p>She looked at him thoughtfully, speculating on the inward
meaning of this statement and noting a certain grave wistfulness
that softened the grim face.</p>

<p>"That sounds rather as if Adaffia were not a perfect Paradise,
for it has been a dull life for you since the mutiny collapsed and
the calm set in, with no one to talk to but me."</p>

<p>"Adaffia would be all right under the same conditions," said
he.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by the same conditions?" she asked, flushing
slightly; and as he did not immediately answer, she continued: "Do
you mean that life would be more pleasant there if you had your
second mate to gossip with?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, reluctantly, almost gruffly. "Of course that
is what I mean."</p>

<p>"It is very nice of you, Jim, to say that, but you needn't have
spoiled it by speaking in that crabby tone. It is nothing to be
ashamed of. I don't mind admitting that I shall miss you most
awfully if we have to separate when this voyage is over. You have
been the best of chums to me."</p>

<p>She flushed again as she said this and then looked at him a
little shyly. For nearly a minute he made no response, but
continued to gaze intently and rather gloomily at the water below.
At length he said, gravely, still looking steadily at the
water:</p>

<p>"There is something, Miss Burleigh, that I feel I ought to tell
you; that I wouldn't tell any one else in the world."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jim," she said. "But please don't call me Miss
Burleigh. It is so ridiculously stiff between old chums like us.
And, Jim, you are not to tell me anything that it might be better
for you that I should not know. I am not in the least inquisitive
about your affairs."</p>

<p>"I know that," he replied. "But this is a thing that I feel you
ought to know. It has been on my mind to tell you for some days
past." He paused for a few seconds and then continued: "You
remember, Betty, that man Osmond that you spoke about?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but don't call him 'that man Osmond.' Poor fellow! I don't
suppose he had done anything very dreadful, and at any rate we can
afford to speak kindly of him now that he is dead."</p>

<p>"Yes, but that is just the point. He isn't dead."</p>

<p>"Isn't dead?" she repeated. "But Captain Cockcram saw that other
man, Larkom, painting the name on his grave. Was it a dummy
grave?"</p>

<p>"No. But it was Larkom who died. The man Cockeram saw was
Osmond."</p>

<p>"Are you sure? But of course you would be. Oh, Jim! You won't
tell anybody else, will you?"</p>

<p>"I am not very likely to," he replied with a grim smile, "as I
happen to be the said John Osmond."</p>

<p>"Jim!" she gasped, gazing at him with wide eyes and parted lips.
"I am astounded! I can't believe it."</p>

<p>"I expect it is a bit of a shock," he said bitterly, "to find
that you have been socialising for more than a week with a man who
is wanted by the police."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that," she exclaimed, turning scarlet. "You know
I didn't. But it is so astonishing. I can't understand how it
happened. It seems so extraordinary, and so&mdash;so
opportune."</p>

<p>Osmond chuckled grimly. "It does," he agreed. "Remarkably
opportune. Almost as if I had polished Larkom off ad hoc. Well, I
didn't."</p>

<p>"Of course you didn't. Who supposed for a moment that you did?
But do tell me exactly how it happened."</p>

<p>"Well, it was quite simple. Poor old Larkom died of blackwater
fever. He was a good fellow. One of the very best, and the only
friend I had. He knew all about me&mdash;or nearly all&mdash;and he
did everything he could to help me. It was an awful blow to me when
he died. But he never had a chance when once the fever took hold of
him. He was an absolute wreck and he went out like the snuff of a
candle, though he managed to make a will before he died, leaving
the factory and all his effects to his friend James Cook. It was he
who invented that name for me.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, when he was dead, I had to bury him and stick
up a cross over his grave. And&mdash;then I just painted the wrong
name on it. That's all."</p>

<p>She nodded without looking at him and a shadow seemed to fall on
her face. "I see," she said, a little coldly. "It was a tempting
opportunity; and events have justified you in taking it."</p>

<p>Something in her tone arrested his attention. He looked at her
sharply and with a somewhat puzzled expression. Suddenly he burst
out: "Good Lord, Betty! You don't think I did this thing in cold
blood, do you?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you?" she asked. "Then how did you come to do it?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. Poor old Larkom's name was John, like mine. I
had painted in the 'John' and was just going to begin the 'Larkom'
when I happened to look along the beach. And there I saw Cockeram
with his armed party bearing down on Adaffia. Of course, I guessed
instantly what his business was, and I saw that there was only one
thing to be done. There was the blank space on the cross. I had
only to fill it in with my own name and the situation would be
saved. So I did."</p>

<p>Her face cleared at this explanation. "I am glad," she said,
"that it was only done on the spur of the moment. It did seem a
little callous."</p>

<p>"I should think so," he agreed, "if you thought of me sitting by
the poor old fellow's bedside and calmly planning to use his corpse
to cover my retreat. As it was, I hated doing it; but necessity
knows no law. I have thought more than once of making a dummy grave
for myself and shifting the cross to it and of setting up a proper
memorial to Larkom. And I will do it when I get back."</p>

<p>She made no comment on this; and as, at the moment her line
tightened, she hauled it in, and impassively detaching a big red
snapper from the hook, re-baited and cast the line overboard with a
curiously detached, preoccupied air. Apparently, she was reflecting
profoundly on what she had just learned, and Osmond, glancing at
her furtively from time to time, abstained from interrupting her
meditations. After a considerable interval she turned towards him
and said in a low, earnest tone: "There is one thing that I want to
ask you. Just now you said that you felt you ought to tell me this;
that I ought to know. I don't quite see why."</p>

<p>"There was a very good reason," he replied, "and I may as well
make a clean breast of it. To put it bluntly, I fell in love with
you almost as soon as I saw you, and naturally, I have grown to
love you more with every day that has passed."</p>

<p>She flushed deeply, and glancing at him for an instant, turned
her eyes once more on her line.</p>

<p>"Still," she said in a low voice, "I don't see why you thought I
ought to know."</p>

<p>"Don't you?" he rejoined. "But surely it is obvious. You
accepted me as your chum and you seemed to like me well enough. But
you had no inkling as to who or what I was. It was my clear duty to
tell you."</p>

<p>"You mean that there was the possibility that I might come to
care for you and that you felt it your duty to warn me off?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It wasn't very likely that there would be anything more
than friendship on your side; but still it was not impossible.
Women fall in love with the most unlikely men."</p>

<p>At this she smiled and looked him squarely in the face, "I
thought you meant that," she said, softly, "and, of course, you
were quite right. But if your intention was to put me on my guard
and prevent me from caring for you, your warning has come too late.
You would have had to tell me before I had seen you&mdash;and I
don't believe it would have made a scrap of difference even then.
At any rate, I don't care a fig what you have done&mdash;I know it
was nothing mean. But all the same, I am glad you told me. I should
have hated to find it out afterwards by myself."</p>

<p>He gazed at her in dismay. "But, Betty," he protested, "you
don't seem to grasp the position. There is a warrant out for my
arrest."</p>

<p>"Who cares?" she responded. "Besides, there isn't. John Osmond
is dead and there is no warrant out for Captain James Cook. It is
you who don't grasp the position."</p>

<p>"But," he expostulated, "don't you realize that I can never go
home? That I can't even show my face in Europe?"</p>

<p>"Very well," said she. "So much the worse for Europe. But there
are plenty of other places; and what is good enough for you is good
enough for me. Now, Jim, dear," she added, coaxingly, "don't create
difficulties. You have said that you love me&mdash;I think I knew
it before you told me&mdash;and that is all that matters to me.
Everything else is trivial. You are the man to whom I have given my
heart, and I am not going to have you crying off."</p>

<p>"Good God, Betty!" he groaned, "don't talk about 'crying off'.
If you only know what it means to me to look into Paradise and be
forced to turn away! But, my dearest love, it has to be. I would
give my life for you gladly, joyfully. I am giving more than my
life in refusing the sacrifice that you, in the nobleness of your
heart, are willing to make. But I could never accept it. I could
never stoop to the mean selfishness of spoiling the life of the
woman who is more to me than all the world."</p>

<p>"I am offering no sacrifice," she said. "I am only asking to
share the life of the man I love. What more does a woman want?"</p>

<p>"Not to share such a life as mine," he replied, bitterly. "Think
of it, Betty, darling! For the rest of my days I must sneak about
the world under a false name, hiding in obscure places, scanning
the face of every stranger with fear and suspicion lest he should
discover my secret and drag me from my sham grave. I am an outcast,
an Ishmaelite. Every man's hand is against me. Could I allow a
woman&mdash;a beautiful girl, a lady of position&mdash;to share
such a sordid existence as mine? I should be a poor lover if I
could think of such contemptible selfishness."</p>

<p>"It isn't so bad as that, Jim, dear," she pleaded. "We could go
abroad&mdash;to America&mdash;and make a fresh start. You would be
sure to do well there with your abilities, and we could just shake
off the old world and forget it."</p>

<p>He shook his head, sadly. "It is no use, darling, to delude
ourselves. We must face realities. Mine is a wrecked life. It would
be a crime, even if it were possible, for me to take you from the
surroundings of an English lady and involve you in the wreckage. It
was a misfortune, at least for you, that we ever met, and there is
only one remedy. When we separate, we must try to forget one
another."</p>

<p>"We shan't, Jim," she exclaimed, passionately. "You know we
shan't. We aren't, either of us, of the kind that forgets. And we
could be so happy together! Don't let us lose everything for a mere
scruple."</p>

<p>At this moment all on deck were startled by a loud hail from
aloft. One of the men had climbed up into the swaying foretop and
stood there holding on to the topmast shrouds and with his free
hand pointing to the north. Osmond stepped forward and hailed
him.</p>

<p>"Foretop there! What is it?"</p>

<p>"A steamer, sir. Seems to be headin' straight on to us."</p>

<p>Osmond ran below, and having fetched Redford's binocular from
the berth, climbed the main rigging to just below the cross-tree.
There, securing himself with one arm passed round a shroud, he
scanned the northern horizon intently for a minute or two and then
descended slowly with a grave, set face. From his loftier station
he had been able to make out the vessel's hull; and the character
of the approaching ship had left him in little doubt as to her
mission. His comrade met him with an anxious, inquiring face as he
jumped down from the rail.</p>

<p>"Small man-o'-war," he reported in response to the unspoken
question; "barquentine-rigged, buff funnel, white hull. Looks like
a gun-boat."</p>

<p>"Ha!" she exclaimed. "That will be the Widgeon. She was lying
off Accra."</p>

<p>The two looked at one another in silence for a while as they
look who have heard bad tidings. At length Osmond said, grimly:
"Well, this is the end of it, Betty. She has been sent out to
search for you. It will be 'good-bye' in less than an hour."</p>

<p>"Not 'good-bye,' Jim," she urged. "You will come, too, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied; "I can't leave the old man in this
muddle."</p>

<p>"But you'll have to leave him sooner or later."</p>

<p>"Yes; but I must give him the chance to get another mate, or at
least to ship one or two native hands."</p>

<p>"Oh, let him muddle on as he did before. My father will be wild
to see you when he hears of all that has happened. Don't forget,
Jim, that you saved my life."</p>

<p>"I saved my own," said he, "and you chanced to benefit. But I
couldn't come with you in any case, Betty. You are forgetting that
I have to keep out of sight. There may be men up at head-quarters
who know me. There may be even on this gun-boat."</p>

<p>She gazed at him despairingly and her eyes filled. "Oh, Jim,"
she moaned, "how dreadful it is. Of course I must go. But I feel
that we shall never see one another again."</p>

<p>"It will be better if we don't," said he.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that!" she pleaded. "Think of what we have been
to one another and what we could still be for ever and ever if only
you could forget what is past and done with. Think of what perfect
chums we have been and how fond we are of one another. For we are,
Jim. I love you with my whole heart and I know that you are just as
devoted to me. It is a tragedy that we should have to part."</p>

<p>"It is," he agreed, gloomily, "and the tragedy is of my
making."</p>

<p>"It isn't," she dissented, indignantly; and then, softly and
coaxingly, she continued: "But we won't lose sight of each other
altogether, Jim, will we? You will write to me as soon as you get
ashore. Promise me that you will."</p>

<p>"Much better not," he replied; but with so little decision that
she persisted until, in the end, and much against his judgment, he
yielded and gave the required promise.</p>

<p>"That makes it a little easier," she said, with a sigh. "It
leaves me something to look forward to."</p>

<p>She took the glasses from him and searched the rim of the
horizon, over which the masts of the approaching ship had begun to
appear.</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to report to the old man," said Osmond, and
he was just turning towards the companion when Captain Hartup's
head emerged slowly and was in due course followed by the remainder
of his person. His left arm was now emancipated from the sling and
in his right hand he carried a sextant.</p>

<p>"Gun-boat in sight, sir," said Osmond. "Seems to be coming our
way."</p>

<p>The captain nodded, and stepping to the taffrail, applied his
eye to the eyepiece of the sextant.</p>

<p>"It has gone seven bells," said he. "Isn't it about time you got
ready to take the latitude&mdash;you and the other officer?" he
added, with a sour grin.</p>

<p>In the agitating circumstances, Osmond had nearly forgotten the
daily ceremony&mdash;a source of perennial joy to the crew. He now
ran below and presently returned with the two sextants, one of
which he handed to 'the other officer'.</p>

<p>"For the last time, little comrade," he whispered.</p>

<p>"And we'll work the reckoning together. Norie's Navigation will
be a sacred book to me after this."</p>

<p>She took the instrument from him and advanced with him to the
bulwark. But if the truth must be told, her observation was a mere
matter of form, and twice before the skipper called "eight bells"
she had furtively to wipe a tear from the eyepiece. But she went
below to the cuddy and resolutely worked out the latitude (from the
reading on Osmond's sextant), and when the brief calculation was
finished, she silently picked up the scrap of paper on which Osmond
had worked out the reckoning and laid hers in its place. He took it
up without a word and slipped it into his pocket.</p>

<p>"They are queer keepsakes," she said in a half-whisper as the
door of the captain's cabin opened, "but they will tell us exactly
when and where we parted. Who knows when and where we shall meet
again&mdash;if we ever do?"</p>

<p>"If we ever do," he repeated in the same tone; and then, as the
captain came out and looked at them inquiringly, he reported the
latitude that they had found, and followed him up the
companion-steps.</p>

<p>When they arrived on deck they found the crew ranged along the
bulwark watching the gun-boat, which was now fully in view, end-on
to the brigantine, and approaching rapidly, her bare masts swinging
like pendulums as she rolled along over the big swell.</p>

<p>"I suppose we shall make our number, sir," said Osmond; and as
the skipper vouchsafed no reply beyond an unintelligible grunt, he
added: "The flag locker is in your cabin, isn't it?</p>

<p>"Never you mind about the flag locker," was the sour reply. "Our
name is painted legibly on the bows and the counter, and I suppose
they've got glasses if they want to know who we are." He took the
binocular from Osmond, and after a leisurely inspection of the
gun-boat, continued: "Looks like the Widgeon. Coming to pick up a
passenger, I reckon. About time, too. I suppose you are both
going&mdash;if they'll take you?"</p>

<p>"I am not," said Osmond. "I am going to stay and see you into
port."</p>

<p>The skipper nodded and emitted an ambiguous grunt, which he
amplified with the addition: "Well, you can please yourself," and
resumed his inspection of the approaching stranger.</p>

<p>His forecast turned out to be correct, for the gunboat made no
signal, but, sweeping past the <i>Speedwell's</i> stern at a
distance of less than a quarter of a mile, slowed down and
brought-to on the port side, when she proceeded to lower a boat;
whereupon Captain Hartup ordered a rope ladder to be dropped over
the port quarter. These preparations Miss Burleigh watched
anxiously and with an assumption of cheerful interest, and when the
boat ran alongside, she joined the skipper at the head of the
ladder, while Osmond, lurking discreetly in the background, kept a
watchful eye on the officer who sat in the stern-sheets until the
lessening distance rendered him distinguishable as an undoubted
stranger, when he also joined the skipper.</p>

<p>As the new-comer&mdash;a pleasant-faced, clean-shaved man in a
lieutenant's uniform&mdash;reached the top of the ladder, he
exchanged salutes with the skipper and the lady, who advanced and
held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Burleigh," said the lieutenant as he shook her hand,
heartily, "this is a relief to find you safe and sound and looking
in the very pink of health. But you have given us all a rare
fright. We were afraid the ship had been lost."</p>

<p>"So she was," replied Betty. "Lost and found. I think I have
earned a fatted calf, don't you, Captain Darley?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," rejoined the lieutenant (the honorary rank was
in acknowledgment of his position as commander of the gun-boat);
"we must leave that to His Excellency. But it doesn't sound very
complimentary to your shipmates or to your recent diet. I needn't
ask if you are coming back with us. My cabin has been made ready
for you."</p>

<p>"But how kind of you, Captain Darley. Yes, I suppose I must come
with you, though I have been having quite a good time here;
mutinies, fishing, and all sorts of entertainments."</p>

<p>"Mutinies, hey!" exclaimed Darley, with a quick glance at the
captain. "Well, I am sorry to tear you away from these
entertainments, but orders are orders. Perhaps you will get your
traps packed up while I have a few words with the captain. I shall
have to make a report of what has happened."</p>

<p>On this there was a general move towards the companion. Betty
retired&mdash;somewhat precipitately&mdash;to her berth and the
lieutenant followed Captain Hartup to his cabin.</p>

<p>Both parties were absent for some time. The first to reappear
was Betty, slightly red about the eyes and carrying a small
hand-bag. Having dispatched Sam Winter below to fetch up her
portmanteau, she drew Osmond away to the starboard side.</p>

<p>"Jack," she said, in a low, earnest tone&mdash;"I may call you
by your own name just for once, mayn't I?&mdash;you have made me a
promise. You won't go back on it, will you, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Of course I shan't, Betty," he replied.</p>

<p>"I want you to have my cabin when I've gone," she continued. "It
is a better one than yours and it has a tiny port-hole. And if you
open the locker, you will find a little note for you. That is all.
Here they come. Good-bye, Jack, darling!"</p>

<p>She turned away abruptly as he murmured a husky farewell, and
having shaken hands with Captain Hartup and thanked him for his
hospitality, was stepping on to the ladder when she paused suddenly
and turned back.</p>

<p>"I had nearly forgotten," said she. "I haven't paid my
passage."</p>

<p>"There is no passage-money to pay," the skipper said, gruffly.
"My contract was to deliver you at Accra, and I haven't done it.
Besides," he added, with a sour grin, "you've worked your
passage."</p>

<p>"Worked her passage!" exclaimed the lieutenant. "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"She has been taking the second mate's duties," the skipper
explained.</p>

<p>Darley stared open-mouthed from the skipper to the lady. Then,
with a fine, hearty British guffaw, he assisted the latter down to
the boat.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>VII. &mdash; THE MATE TAKES HIS
DISCHARGE</h2>

<p class="first">As an instance of the malicious perversity which
the forces of nature often appear to display, the calm which had
for so many days cut off Miss Betty from any communication with the
world at large seemed unable to survive her departure. Before the
gun-boat was fairly hull down on the horizon, a dark line on the
glassy sea announced the approach of a breeze, and a few minutes
later the brigantine's sails filled, her wallowings subsided, and a
visible wake began to stream out astern.</p>

<p>The change in the vessel's motion brought the captain promptly
on deck, and Osmond listened somewhat anxiously for the orders as
to the course which was to be set. But he knew his commander too
well to make any suggestions.</p>

<p>"Breeze seems to be about sou'-sou'-west," the skipper remarked
with one eye on the compass-dial and the other on the upper sails.
"Looks as if it was going to hold, too. Put her head
west-nor'-west."</p>

<p>"Did the lieutenant give you our position?" Osmond inquired.</p>

<p>"No, he didn't," the skipper snapped. "He wasn't asked. I don't
want any of your brass-bound dandies teaching me my business. The
continent of Africa is big enough for me to find without their
help."</p>

<p>Osmond smothered a grin as he thought of the chronometer,
re-started and ticking away aimlessly in the captain's cabin, its
error and rate alike unknown. But again he made no comment, and
presently the skipper resumed: "I suppose you will be wanting to
get back to Adaffia?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to leave you in the lurch."</p>

<p>"Well, you can't stay with me for good excepting as a seaman, as
you haven't got a ticket&mdash;at least, I suppose you
haven't."</p>

<p>"No. I hold a master's certificate entitling me to navigate my
own yacht, but, of course, that is no use on a merchant vessel,
excepting in an emergency. But I don't quite see what you are going
to do."</p>

<p>"It is a bit of a problem," the skipper admitted. "I shall take
on one or two native hands to help while we are on the Coast, and
appoint Winter and Simmons to act as mates. Then perhaps I shall he
able to pick up an officer from one of the steamers for the
homeward trip."</p>

<p>"I will stay with you until you are fixed up, if you like," said
Osmond; but the captain shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "I shall put you ashore at Adaffia. I can
manage all right on the Coast, and I must have a regular mate for
the homeward voyage."</p>

<p>Thus the programme was settled, and, on the whole,
satisfactorily to Osmond. It is true that, if there had been no
such person as Elizabeth Burleigh, he would have held on to his
position, even with the rating of ordinary seaman, for the homeward
voyage, on the chance of transferring later to some ship bound for
South America or the Pacific Islands. But although he had renounced
all claim to her and all hope of any future connected with her, he
still clung to the ill omened land that was made glorious to him by
her beloved presence.</p>

<p>The captain's forecast was justified by the event. The breeze
held steadily and seemed inclined to freshen rather than to fail.
The old brigantine heeled over gently and forged ahead with a
pleasant murmur in her sails and quite a fine wake trailing astern.
It was a great relief to everybody after the long calm, with its
monotony and inaction and the incessant rolling of the ship and
flapping of the sails. The captain was almost pleasant and the crew
were cheerful and contented, though they had little to do, for when
once the course was set there was no need to touch sheet or brace,
and the trick at the wheel was the only active duty apart from the
cook's activities.</p>

<p>To Osmond alone the change brought no obvious satisfaction. All
that had recently happened had been, as he could not but recognize,
for the best. The parting had to come, and every day that it was
delayed forged his fetters only the more firmly. But this
reflection offered little consolation. He loved this sweet, frank,
open-hearted girl with an intensity possible only to a man of his
strength of will and constancy of purpose. And now she was gone;
gone out of his life for ever. It was a final parting. There was no
future to look forward to; not even the most distant and shadowy.
The vision of a great happiness had floated before him and had
passed, leaving him to take up again the burden of his joyless
life, haunted for ever by the ghost of the might-have-been.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he went about his duties briskly enough, finding
jobs for the men and for himself, overhauling the cordage, doing
small repairs on the rigging, and even, with his own hands, putting
a patch on a weak spot on the bottom of the long-boat and lining it
inside and out with scraps of sheet copper. And if he was a little
grimmer and more silent than before, the men understood and in
their rough way sympathized, merely remarking that "Pore old Cook
do seem cut up along o' losin' his Judy."</p>

<p>At dawn on the third day the land was in sight; that is to say
to the north there was an appearance as if a number of small
entomological pins had been stuck into the sea-horizon in irregular
groups. Viewed from the fore-top, however, through Redford's
glasses, this phenomenon resolved itself into a narrow band of
low-lying shore, dotted with coconut palms, the characteristic
aspect of the Bight of Benin.</p>

<p>As the day wore on, the brigantine gradually closed in with the
land. Before noon, the captain was able, through his telescope, to
identify a group of white buildings as the German factories at the
village of Bagidá. Then the neighbouring village of Lomé came in
sight and slowly crept past; and as the <i>Speedwell</i> drew yet
nearer to the land, Osmond was able to recognize, among a large
grove of coconuts, the white-washed bungalow at Denu, and, a few
miles ahead, the dark mass of palms that he knew to be Adaffia.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Cook," said the captain, "you'll soon be back by your
own fireside. If the breeze holds, we ought to be in Adaffia roads
by four at the latest. I suppose you have got all your portmanteaux
packed?"</p>

<p>"I'm all ready to go ashore, if you are still of the same
mind."</p>

<p>"I never change my mind," replied the skipper; and Osmond
believed him.</p>

<p>"Are you making any stay at Adaffia?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am going to put you ashore," the captain answered. "What I
shall do after that is my business."</p>

<p>"I asked," said Osmond, "because I thought I might be able to
get you one or two native hands. However, you can let me know about
that later. Now, as it is your watch on deck, I will go below and
take a bit of a rest."</p>

<p>He went down to the berth, into which he had moved when Betty
departed, and, shutting the door, looked thoughtfully round the
little apartment. Nothing had been altered since she left. All the
little feminine tidinesses had been piously preserved. It was
still, to the eye, a woman's cabin, and everything in its aspect
spoke to him of the late tenant. Presently he lay down on the
bunk&mdash;the bunk in which she had slept&mdash;and for the
hundredth time drew from his pocket the letter which she had left
in the locker. It was quite short&mdash;just a little note hastily
written at the last moment when the boat was waiting. But to him it
was inexhaustible; and though by now he knew it by heart, he read
it again as eagerly as when he had first opened it.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">'<span class="smcap">My Dearest Jim</span>,' it
ran.</p>

<p class="letter">'I am writing you a few words of farewell (since
we must say 'good-bye' in public) to tell you that when you read
them I shall be thinking of you. I shall think of you, best and
dearest comrade, every day of my life, and I shall go on hoping
that somehow we shall meet again and be as we have been on this
dear old ship. And Jim, dearest, I want you to understand that I am
always yours. Whenever you want me&mdash;no, I don't mean that; I
know you want me now&mdash;but whenever you can cast away things
that ought to be forgotten, remember that I am waiting for you.
Try, dear, to forget every thing but your love and mine.</p>

<p class="letter">'Au revoir!</p>

<p class="letter">'Your faithful and loving<br>
'<span class="smcap">Betty</span>.'</p>
<br>

<p>It was a sweet letter, written in all sincerity; and even though
Osmond never wavered in the renunciation that honour demanded,
still it told him in convincing terms that the door was not shut.
The gate of Paradise was still ajar. If he could forget all justice
and generosity; if he, who had nothing to give, could bring himself
to accept the gift so generously held out to him, he still had the
option to enter. He realized that&mdash;and never, for an instant,
entertained the thought. Perhaps there were other ways out. But if
there were, he dismissed them, too. Like Captain Hartup, he was not
given to altering his mind. Free as he was from the captain's petty
obstinacy, he was a man of inflexible purpose, even though the
purpose might have been ill-considered.</p>

<p>His long reverie was at length interrupted by a voice which came
in through the little port-hole. "No soundings!"</p>

<p>He glanced up at the tell-tale compass which formed a rather
unusual fitting to the mate's bunk and noted that the ship's course
had been altered three points to the north. She was now heading
almost directly for the land and was presumably nearly opposite
Adaffia. He re-folded the letter and put it away, but his thoughts
went back to its message and to the beloved writer. Presently the
voice of the man in the channel who was heaving the lead was heard
again; and this time it told of a nearer approach to that dreary
shore.</p>

<p>"By the deep, eighteen!"</p>

<p>He noted the depth with faint interest and began to think of the
immediate future. As soon as he got ashore he must write to her. It
was quite wrong, but he had promised, and he could not but be glad
that she had exacted the promise. It would be a joy to write to
her, and yet he could feel that he was doing it under compulsion.
But it must be a careful letter. There must be in it no sign of
weakening or wavering that might mislead her. She must be free and
she must fully realize it; must realize that he belonged to her
past and had no part in her future. It would be a difficult letter
to write; and here he set himself to consider what he should say.
And meanwhile the leads-man's voice came in from time to time,
recording the gradual approach to the land.</p>

<p>"By the deep, ele-vern!" "By the mark, ten!" "By the deep,
eight!"</p>

<p>At this point he was aware of sounds in the cuddy as if some
heavy objects were being moved, and he surmised that the gin-cases
were being disinterred from the lazarette. Then he heard the trap
fall and heavy footsteps stumbled up the companion-stairs. A moment
later the leadsman sang out: "By the mark, sev-ern!" and as Osmond
rose from the bunk there came a thumping at his door and a voice
sang out:</p>

<p>"The captain wants you on deck, sir, and there's a canoe
a-comin' alongside."</p>

<p>Osmond cast a farewell glance round the little cabin and
followed the man up on deck, where he found the captain waiting on
the poop, standing guard, apparently, over two leathern bags and
one of canvas. Looking forward, he saw the crew gathered at the
open gangway, regarding with sheepish grins four unopened
gin-cases, while a canoe, bearing a scarlet-coated grandee, was
just running alongside. As he stepped out of the companion, the
captain picked up the three bags, and walking with him slowly
towards the gangway, addressed him in a gruff tone and a somewhat
aggressive manner.</p>

<p>"According to law," said he, "I believe you are entitled to a
third of the ship's value for salvage services. There are nearly
two hundred ounces of gold-dust in these two leather
bags&mdash;that is, roughly, eight hundred pounds&mdash;and there
is forty-eight pounds ten in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, in the
canvas bag. Will that satisfy you?</p>

<p>"Rubbish," said Osmond. "I want eight shillings for two cases of
gin broached by your men."</p>

<p>"You won't get it from me," snapped the skipper. "I'll have
nothing to do with intoxicating liquor."</p>

<p>"If you don't pay, I'll sue you," said Osmond.</p>

<p>"I haven't had the gin," retorted the skipper. "It was brought
on board without my authority. You must recover from the men who
had it. But what do you say about the question of salvage?"</p>

<p>"Hang the salvage!" replied Osmond. "I want to be paid for my
gin."</p>

<p>"You won't get a ha'penny from me for your confounded poison,"
exclaimed the skipper, hotly. "I hold very strict views on the
liquor traffic. There are the men who drank the stuff. Make them
pay. It's no concern of mine. But about this salvage question: are
you satisfied with what I offer?"</p>

<p>Osmond glanced through the gangway. The gin-cases were all
stowed in the canoe; Mensah was beaming up at him with an expectant
grin and the canoe-men grasped their paddles. He felt in his
pocket, and then, taking the canvas bag from the skipper, thrust
his hand in and brought out a handful of coins. From these he
selected a half-sovereign, and returning the others, dropped in a
couple of shillings from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Two shillings change," he remarked. He threw the bag down on
the deck, and pocketing the half sovereign, dropped down into the
canoe. But he had hardly taken his seat on the tie-tie thwart when
two heavy thumps on the floor of the canoe, followed by a jingling
impact, announced the arrival of the two bags of gold-dust and the
bag of specie.</p>

<p>Osmond stood up in the dancing canoe with a leather bag in each
hand.</p>

<p>"Now, Mensah," he sang out, "tell the boys to get away one
time."</p>

<p>The paddles dug into the blue water; the canoe bounded forward.
Aiming skilfully at the open gang way, Osmond sent the heavy
leathern bags, one after the other, skimming along the deck, and
the little bag of specie after them. The skipper grabbed them up
and rushed to the gangway. But he was too late. The canoe was
twenty yards away and leaping forward to the thud of the paddles.
Looking back at the brigantine with a satisfied smile, Osmond saw a
row of six grinning faces at the rail, and at the gangway a small
figure that shook its fist at the receding canoe with valedictory
fury.</p>

<p>His homecoming was the occasion of a pleasant surprise. At
intervals during his absence he had given a passing thought to his
factory and the little solitary house by the beach and had wondered
how they would fare while their master was away. Now he found that
in Kwaku Mensah he had a really faithful steward, and not only
faithful but strangely competent in his simple way. The house was
in apple-pie order and the store was neatly kept and evidently a
going concern, for when he arrived, Mensah's pretty Fanti wife was
behind the counter, chaffering persuasively with a party of 'bush'
people from Agotimé, and a glance into the compound showed a good
pile of produce, awaiting removal to the produce store. Accounts,
of course, there were none, since Mensah 'no sabby book', but
nevertheless that artless merchantman had kept an exact record of
all the transactions with that uncanny precision of memory that one
often observes in the intelligent illiterate.</p>

<p>So Osmond settled down at once, with a satisfaction that rather
surprised him, into the old surroundings; and as he sat that
evening at the table, consuming with uncommon relish a dinner of
okro soup, 'chickum cotrecks', and 'banana flitters', the product
of Mrs. Mensah's skill (her name was Ekua Bochwi, from which one
learned that she had been born on Wednesday and was the eighth
child of her parents), he was inclined to congratulate himself on
Captain Hartup's refusal to retain him as the provisional mate of
the <i>Speedwell</i>.</p>

<p>But in spite of the triumphant way in which he had
out-manoeuvred the skipper, Osmond had a suspicion that he had not
seen the last of his late commander. For the brigantine, which he
had left hove-to and apparently ready to proceed on her voyage, had
presently let go her anchor and stowed her sails as if the captain
contemplated a stay at Adaffia. And the event justified his
suspicions. On the following morning, while he was seated at the
breakfast-table, with a fair copy of his letter to Betty before
him, he became aware of shod feet on the gravelled compound, and a
few moments later the doorway framed the figure of Captain Hartup,
while in the background lurked Sam Winter, grinning joy and
carrying two leathern bags.</p>

<p>The captain entered, and regarding his quondam mate with an
expression that almost approached geniality, wished him "good
morning" and even held out his hand. Osmond grasped it cordially,
and drawing up a second chair, pressed his visitor to join him.</p>

<p>"A little fresh food," he remarked, untactfully, with his eye on
the leathern bags, "and a cup of real coffee will do you good."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by that," snorted the skipper. "I'm
not starving, and neither are you. The ship's grub hasn't killed
you. Still," he added, "as I see you are breakfasting like a
Christian and not in the beastly Coast fashion, I don't mind if I
do try a bit of shore tack with you. And you needn't look at those
bags like that. I am not going to force anything on you. I am not
an obstinate man" (which was a most outrageous untruth).</p>

<p>"What have you brought them here for?" Osmond demanded
stolidly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you presently," replied the skipper. "Bring 'em in,
Winter, and dump 'em on that sideboard."</p>

<p>Winter deposited the two bags on the stack of empty cases thus
politely designated and then backed to the doorway, where he was
encountered by Kwaku, who was directed to take him to the store and
feed him.</p>

<p>"I've come ashore," the captain explained when they were alone,
"to see if I can make one or two little arrangements with you."</p>

<p>Osmond nodded as he helped his guest to stuffed okros and fried
eggs (eggs are usually served, on the Coast, fried or poached or in
some other overt form, as a precaution against embryological
surprises).</p>

<p>"To begin with," continued the skipper, "I want about half a
dozen niggers&mdash;a cook, a cabin-boy, and a few hands to do the
rough work. Do you think you can manage that for me?"</p>

<p>"I've no doubt I can," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Good. Well, then, there is this gold-dust. If you care to
change your mind, say so, and the stuff is yours."</p>

<p>Osmond shook his head. "I came on board for my own purposes,"
said he, "and I am not going to take any payment for looking after
my own business."</p>

<p>"Very well," the skipper rejoined: "then if you won't have it, I
may as well keep it; and I shan't if it remains on board. It was
that gold-dust that tempted Dhoody and the others. Now I understood
from you that you have got a safe. Is it a pretty strong one?"</p>

<p>"It's strong enough. There are no skilled burglars out
here."</p>

<p>"Then I'm going to ask you to take charge of this stuff for me.
You see that both bags are sealed up, and there is a paper inside
each giving particulars of the contents and full directions as to
how they are to be disposed of if anything should happen to me.
Will you do this for me&mdash;as a matter of business, of
course?"</p>

<p>"Not as a matter of business," replied Osmond. "That would make
me responsible for the safe custody of the bags, which I can't be,
as I may have to be absent from Adaffia and leave my man, Mensah,
in charge of the factory. I will put the stuff in my safe with
pleasure, and I think it will be perfectly secure there; but I
won't take any payment or accept any responsibility beyond
exercising reasonable care. Will that do?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the captain, "that will do. What is good enough
for your own property is good enough for mine. So I will ask you to
lock the stuff up for me and keep it till I ask for it; but if you
should hear that anything has happened to me&mdash;that I am dead,
in fact&mdash;then you will open the bags and read the papers
inside and dispose of the property according to the directions
written in those papers. Will you do that? It will be a weight off
my mind if you will."</p>

<p>"Certainly I will," said Osmond. "But have you any reason to
expect that anything will happen to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing immediate," the captain replied. "But, you see, I am
not as young as I was, and I am not what you would call a very
sound man. I am subject to occasional attacks of giddiness and
faintness. I don't know how much they mean, but my doctor at
Bristol warned me not to treat them too lightly. He gave me a
supply of medicine, which I keep in the chest, and when I feel an
attack coming on, I turn in and take some. But still, 'in the midst
of life we are in death,' you know; and I'm ready to answer to my
name when the call comes."</p>

<p>"Well," said Osmond, "let us hope it won't come until you have
got your goods safely home to Bristol. But in any case, you can
depend on me to carry out your instructions."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Cook," said the captain. "I am glad to get that
little matter settled. The only anxiety that is left now is the
ivory. I had thought of asking you to take charge of that, too, but
it would be awkward for you to store. And, after all, it's fairly
safe in the hold. A man can't nip off with a dozen eighty-pound
tusks in his pocket. So I think we will leave that where it is,
ready stowed for the homeward voyage. By the way, have you got any
produce that you want to dispose of?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a ton or two of copra and a couple of puncheons of
oil; and I can let you have some kernels and rubber. Perhaps you
would like to take some of the produce in exchange for trade
goods."</p>

<p>The arrangement suited Captain Hartup exactly, and accordingly,
when they had finished breakfast and stowed the gold-dust in the
safe, they adjourned to the produce store to settle the details of
the exchange. Then half a dozen canoes were chartered, the new
hands mustered by Kwaku, and for the rest of the day the little
factory compound and the usually quiet beach were scenes of
unwonted bustle and activity. Sam Winter (secretly fortified with a
substantial 'tot' of gin) was sent on board to superintend the
stowage and breaking-out of cargo, while the skipper remained
ashore to check off the goods landed and embarked.</p>

<p>The sun was getting low when the two white men set forth to
follow the last consignment down to the beach. When they had seen
it loaded into the canoes and watched its passage through the surf,
Captain Hartup turned to Osmond, and having shaken his hand with
almost unnatural cordiality, said, gruffly but not without
emotion:</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, Mr. Cook. I've a good deal to thank you for,
and I don't forget it. Providence brought us together when I badly
needed a friend, and He will bring us together again, no doubt, in
His own good time. But how or when, no one can foresee."</p>

<p>He shook Osmond's hand again and, stepping into the waiting
canoe, took his seat on a parcel of rubber. The incoming breaker
surged up and spent its last energy in a burst of spray on the
canoe's beak. The little craft lifted and, impelled by a hearty
shove from the canoe-men, slid down the beach on the backwash and
charged into the surf. For a few minutes Osmond stood at the brink
of the sea watching the canoe as it hovered amidst clouds of spray,
dodging the great combers and waiting for its chance to slip
through the 'shouting seas' to the quiet rollers outside. At length
the periodical 'lull' came; the paddles drummed furiously on the
green-blue water; the canoe leaped at the following wave,
disappeared in a burst of snowy froth, and reappeared prancing
wildly but safely outside the line of surf. A little figure in the
canoe turned and waved its hand; and Osmond, after a responsive
flourish of his hat and a glance at the anchored brigantine, turned
away from the beach with an odd feeling of regret and walked slowly
back to the factory, pondering on the captain's curious and rather
cryptic farewell.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE LAST OF THE
'SPEEDWELL'</h2>

<p class="first">FOR a couple of months Osmond's life at Adaffia
drifted on monotonously enough, yet not at all drearily to a man of
his somewhat solitary habits and self-contained nature. The factory
prospered in a modest way with very little attention on his part,
causing him often to reflect regretfully on poor Larkom's
melancholy and unnecessary failure. That kindly wastrel was now
secured&mdash;for a time&mdash;from oblivion by a neatly-made
wooden cross, painted white and inscribed with his name, a date,
and a few appreciative words, which had been set above his grave
when the other cross had been removed to grace an elongated heap of
sand which represented the resting-place of the late John
Osmond.</p>

<p>Moreover, there were breaks in the monotony which had not
existed before the adventure of the <i>Speedwell</i>. His letter to
Betty (in which, among other matters, he had related with naive
satisfaction the incident of the leathern bags and the defeat of
Captain Hartup) had evoked a lengthy reply with a demand for a
further letter; and so, much against his judgment, he had been
drawn into a regular correspondence which was the occasion of
alternate and conflicting emotions. Every letter that he wrote
racked his conscience and filled him with self-contempt. But the
arrival of the inevitable and always prompt reply was a delight
which he accepted and enjoyed without a qualm. It was very
inconsistent. To the half-naked native who acted as the
semi-official postman, he would hand his letter shamefacedly, with
a growl of disapproval, admonishing himself that "this sort of
thing has got to stop." And then, on the day when the reply was
expected, he would take a telescope out on the sand-hills and
remain for hours watching the beach for the appearance in the
remote distance of that same native postman.</p>

<p>These letters, mostly written from head-quarters, kept him
informed respecting events of local interest, and, what was much
more to the point, of Betty's own doings and movements. He learned,
for instance, that there were rumours of a native rising in Anglóh
(officially spelt Awuna), the region at the back of Adaffia; and
that&mdash;regardless of this fact&mdash;Betty was trying to get
her father's permission for a little journey of exploration into
this very district.</p>

<p>This latter item of news set his emotional see-saw going at
double speed. His judgment denounced the project violently. First,
there was the danger&mdash;obvious, though not so very great; for
the African is essentially a gentlemanly fighter, if rather
heavy-handed, and would avoid injuring a white woman. But he is a
shockingly bad marksman and uses slugs and gravel for ammunition,
so that accidents are very liable to happen. But apart from the
danger, this expedition was highly undesirable, for it would bring
Betty into his neighbourhood, and of course they would
meet&mdash;she would see to that. And that meeting ought not to
take place. It would only prolong a state of affairs that was
disturbing to him and ruinous to her future prospects. He felt this
very sincerely, and was foolish enough to say so in his reply to
her letter.</p>

<p>From time to time his thoughts wandered to Captain Hartup, and
always with a tendency to speculate on the meaning&mdash;if there
were any&mdash;of the note of foreboding which he thought he had
detected in the captain's last words as they said "good-bye" on the
beach. Those words&mdash;together with something final and
testamentary in his manner when he had deposited the bags of
gold-dust in the safe&mdash;seemed to hint at an uncertainty of
life and distrust of the future on the captain's part, on which
Osmond reflected uneasily. And at last, there came a day on which
the skipper's meaning was made clear.</p>

<p>One morning, in the short interval between the night and the
dawn, he awoke suddenly and became aware of a dusky figure between
his bed and the window.</p>

<p>"Mastah!" the voice of Mensah exclaimed, excitedly, "dat ship,
<i>Speedwell</i>! I look um. He fit for come on de beach."</p>

<p>Osmond lifted the mosquito-curtain and, springing out of bed,
dropped into his slippers, snatched up the telescope, and followed
Mensah out to the end of the compound whence there was a clear view
of the sea. And there she was looming up sharp and clear against
the grey dawn; and the first glance of a nautical eye read tragedy
and disaster in every detail of her aspect. No telescope was
needed. She was close in shore, within a couple of cable-lengths of
the surf, with her square-sails aback and head-sails shivering,
drifting slowly but surely to the destruction that roared under her
lee. Obviously, there was no one at the wheel, nor was there any
sign of life on board. She was a perfect picture of a derelict.</p>

<p>For a few moments Osmond stared at her in horrified amazement.
Then, with a sharp command to Mensah to "get canoe one time," he
ran out of the compound and made his way to the beach.</p>

<p>But his order had been anticipated. As he and Mensah came out on
the shore, they found a group of excited fishermen dragging a canoe
down to the water's edge, while another party were already afloat
and paddling out through the surf towards the derelict brigantine.
Osmond and his henchman at once joined the fishermen, and though
the latter looked askance at the white man&mdash;for the
accommodation of the little craft was rather limited&mdash;they
made no demur, experience having taught them that he would have his
own way&mdash;and pay for it. Accordingly they hauled and shoved
with a will, and in a very few moments got the canoe down to the
water's edge. Osmond and Mensah stepped in and took their seats,
the fishermen grasped the gunwales, and when a big wave swept in
and lifted the canoe, they shoved off and went sliding down on the
backwash and charged into the surf.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the brigantine continued to drift by the wind and
current nearly parallel to the shore, but slowly approached the
latter. At the moment she was turning sluggishly and beginning to
'pay off' on the star board tack. Her sails filled and she began to
move ahead. If anyone had been on board she might even now have
been saved, for there was still room for her to 'claw off' the lee
shore. Osmond gazed at her with his heart in his mouth and urged
the canoe-men to greater efforts; though they wanted little urging,
seeing that their friends in the other canoe were now quite near to
the receding ship. Moment by moment his hopes rose as the
brigantine gathered way, though she was now less easy to overtake.
Breathlessly he watched the leading canoe approach her nearer and
nearer until at last the fishermen were able to lay hold of the
vacant tackles that hung down from the stern davits and swarm up
them to the poop. And even as they disappeared over the taffrail,
the flicker of life that the old brigantine had displayed faded
out. Under the pressure of the mainsail she began slowly to turn to
windward. The head-sails shivered, the square-sails blew back
against the mast; she ceased to move ahead, and then began once
more to drift stern-foremost towards the white line of surf.</p>

<p>As Osmond's canoe ran alongside, where the other canoe was now
towing, the first arrivals came tumbling over the side in a state
of wild excitement, jabbering as only an excited African can
jabber. Mensah proceeded hastily to interpret.</p>

<p>"Dose fishermen say dis ship no good. Dead man live inside
him."</p>

<p>Osmond acknowledged the information with an in articulate growl,
and grasping a chain-plate, hauled himself up into the channel,
whence he climbed over the rail and dropped on deck.</p>

<p>His first act was to run to the wheel, jam it hard over to port
and fix it with a lashing. Then he ran forward to look at the
anchors; but both of them were stowed securely and&mdash;for the
present purposes&mdash;useless. He looked up despairingly at the
sails, and for a moment thought of trying to swing the yards; but a
glance over the stern at the snowy line of surf showed him that the
time for manoeuvring was past. For an instant he stood scanning the
deck; noting the absence of both boats and the yawning main hatch.
Then he ran aft and scrambled down the companion-steps.</p>

<p>The door of the captain's cabin was open&mdash;had been left
open by the fishermen&mdash;and was swinging idly as the ship
rolled. But though the whereabouts of the dead man was evident
enough before he reached it, he entered without hesitation, intent
only on learning exactly what had happened on that ill-omened
ship.</p>

<p>The little cabin was just as he had last seen it&mdash;with
certain differences. And in the bunk lay something that had once
been Captain Hartup. It was a dreadful thing to look upon, for the
Tropics deal not kindly with the unsepulchred dead. But as Osmond
stood looking down on the bunk, mere physical repulsion was
swallowed up in a profound feeling of pity for the poor,
cross-grained, honest-hearted little shipmaster. There he
lay&mdash;all that was left of him. There, in the bunk, still
lightly held by the blackened, puffy hand, was the inexhaustible
Commentary, and on the deck, by the bunk-side, an open box
containing a tumbler and a large medicine-bottle the label of which
bore written directions and a Bristol address.</p>

<p>Osmond picked up the bottle and read the minute directions with
a sense of profound relief. Its presence suggested what his
inspection of the dead man confirmed; that at least death had come
to Captain Hartup peaceably and decently. The traces of a murderous
attack which he had feared to find were not there. Everything
tended to show that the captain had died, as he had seemed to
expect, from the effects of some long-standing malady.</p>

<p>From the dead man Osmond turned a swift attention to the cabin.
He had noticed, when he entered, that the chronometer was not in
its place on the little chart-table. He now observed that other
things had disappeared&mdash;the telescope, the marine glasses, the
sextant, and the mathematical instrument case In short, as he
looked round, he perceived that the little cabin had been gutted.
Every portable thing of value had been taken away.</p>

<p>His observations were interrupted by the voice of Mensah calling
to him urgently to come away "one time," and at the same moment he
felt the ship give a heavy lurch followed by a quick recovery. He
backed out of the cabin and was about to run up the companion-steps
when his glance fell on the door of the adjoining berth, which had
been his own and Betty's, and he was moved irresistibly to take a
last, farewell look at the little hutch which held so many and so
dearly prized memories. He thrust the door open and looked in; and
even as he looked, a flash of dazzling white came through the tiny
porthole, and a moment later a thunderous crash resounded and the
ship trembled as if struck by a thousand monstrous hammers.</p>

<p>He waited no more, but, springing up the steps, thrust his head
cautiously out of the companion-hatch. Glancing seaward, he saw a
great, sparkling green mass sweeping down on the ship. In another
instant, its sharp, tremulous crest whitened; a hissing sound was
borne to his ears and quickly rose to a hoarse roar which ended in
a crash that nearly shook him off his feet. Then sea and sky, masts
and deck, were swallowed up in a cloud of blinding white; there was
another roar, and the snowy cataract descended, filling the deck
with a seething torrent of foaming water.</p>

<p>Osmond sprang out of the hatch and took a quick glance round.
The two canoes were hovering on the outside edge of the surf and
obviously unable to approach the ship. Towards the land, the sea
was an unbroken expanse of white, while to seaward the long ranks
of sharp-crested waves were turning over and breaking as they
approached. Warned by a hissing roar from the nearest wave, he
stepped back into the shelter of the companion. Again the ship
staggered to the crashing impact. Again the visible world was
blotted out by the white cloud of spray and foam; and then, as the
deluge fell, came a sickening jar with loud cracking noises as the
ship struck heavily on the ground. Twice she lifted and struck
again, but the third time, rending sounds from below told that her
timbers had given way and she lifted no more. Then, under the
hammering of the surf, which filled her lower sails with green
water, she heeled over towards the shore until the deck was at an
angle of nearly forty-five.</p>

<p>Osmond looked out from his shelter and rapidly considered what
he should do. There was not much time to consider, for the ship
would soon begin to break up. He thought of dropping overboard on
the land side and swimming ashore; but it was not a very safe plan,
for at any moment the masts might go over the side, and it would
not do for him to be underneath when they fell.</p>

<p>Still, he had to act quickly if he were to escape from the
impending collapse of the whole fabric, and he looked about eagerly
to find the least perilous method. Suddenly his glance fell upon a
large cork fender which was washing about in the lee scuppers. The
way in which it floated showed that it was dry and buoyant, and it
appeared to him that with its aid he might venture into the surf
beyond the shelter of the ship and wash safely ashore.</p>

<p>He watched for an opportunity to secure it. Waiting for the
brief interval between the descent of the deluge and the bursting
of the next wave, he slipped out, and grasping the end of the main
sheet, which had washed partly loose from the cleat, ran down to
the scupper, seized the fender, and hauling himself up again, crept
into his shelter just in time to escape the next wave. When this
had burst on the ship and the cataract had fallen, he kicked off
his slippers, darted out, and clawing his way past the wheel,
reached the taffrail. Holding on firmly to the fender with one
hand, with the other he grasped the lee davit-tackle, and springing
out, let the tackle slip through his hand.</p>

<p>Just as he reached the water, the next wave burst on the ship;
and for the next few moments he was conscious of nothing but a
roaring in his ears, a sudden plunge into darkness, and a sense of
violent movement. But he still clung tenaciously to the fender, and
presently his head rose above the seething water. He took a deep
breath, shook the water from his eyes, and began to strike out with
his feet, waiting anxiously for the next wave and wondering how
much submersion he could stand without drowning. But when the next
wave came, its behaviour rather surprised him. The advancing wall
of hissing foam seemed simply to take hold of the fender and bear
it away swiftly shoreward, leaving him to hold on and follow with
his head comfortably above the surface.</p>

<p>In this way, amidst a roar like that of steam from an engine's
escape-valve, he was borne steadily and swiftly for about a quarter
of a mile. Then the spent wave left him and he could see it
travelling away towards the shore. But the following wave overtook
him after a very short interval and carried him forward another
stage. And so he was borne along with surprising ease and speed
until he was at last flung roughly on the beach and forthwith
smothered in foaming water. He clawed frantically at the wet sand
and strove to rise. But the beach was steep and the undertow would
have dragged him back but for the help of a couple of fishermen,
who, holding on to a grass rope that was held by their companions,
waded into the surf, and grabbing him by the arms, dragged him up
on to the dry sand beyond the reach of the waves.</p>

<p>As he rose to his feet, he turned to look at the ship. But she
was a ship no longer. The short time occupied by his passage ashore
had turned her into a mere wreck. Her masts lay flat on the water
and her deck had been burst through from below; and through the
yawning spaces where the planks had been driven out, daylight could
be seen in several places where her side was stove in. The two
canoes had already come ashore, and their crews stood at the
water's edge, watching the flotsam that was even now beginning to
drift shoreward on the surf. Osmond, too, watched it with interest,
for he now recalled that the instantaneous glance that he had cast
through the open main hatch had shown an unexpectedly empty
condition of the hold. And this impression was confirmed when
Mensah joined him (apparently quite unmoved by the proceedings of
his eccentric employer) and remarked:</p>

<p>"Dose fishermen say only small-small cargo live in side dat
ship. Dey say de sailor-man tief de cargo and go away in de
boats."</p>

<p>Osmond made no comment on this. Obviously the cargo could not
have been taken away in two small boats. But equally obviously it
was not there, nor were the boats. It was clear that the ship had
been abandoned&mdash;probably after the skipper's death&mdash;and
she had been abandoned at sea. The suggestion was that the crew had
transhipped on to some passing vessel and that the cargo had been
transferred with them. It might be a perfectly legitimate
transaction. But the presence in the cabin of the unburied body of
the captain, and the open main hatch, hinted at hurried proceedings
of not very scrupulous agents. A responsible shipmaster would
certainly have buried the dead captain. Altogether it was a
mysterious affair, on which it was possible only to speculate.</p>

<p>The spot where the brigantine had come ashore was about halfway
between Adaffia and the adjoining village of Denu. Osmond decided
to walk the three or four miles into Adaffia, and when he had
washed, dressed, and breakfasted, to return and examine the
wreckage. Meanwhile, he left Mensah on guard to see that nothing
was taken away&mdash;or at any rate, to keep account of anything
that was removed by the natives, who were now beginning to flock in
from the two villages. Accordingly, having borrowed from the
fishermen a large, shallow calabash to put over his head&mdash;for
the sun was now well up and making itself felt&mdash;he strode away
westward along the beach, walking as far as was possible on the wet
sand to avoid delivering his bare feet to the attacks of the
chiggers&mdash;sand-fleas&mdash;which infested the 'Aeolian sands'
above the tide-marks.</p>

<p>When he returned some three hours later all that was left of the
<i>Speedwell</i> was a litter of wreckage and flotsam strewn along
the margin of the sea or on the blown sand, to which some of the
more valuable portions had been carried. The vessel's keel, with
the stem and stern-posts and a few of the main timbers still
attached, lay some distance out, but even this melancholy skeleton
was gradually creeping shoreward under the incessant pounding of
the surf. The masts, spars, and sails were still in the water, but
they, too, were slowly creeping up the beach as the spent waves
struck them every few seconds. As to the rest, the ship seemed
almost to have decomposed into her constituent planks and beams.
There is no ship-breaker like an Atlantic surf.</p>

<p>Osmond cast a pensive glance over the disorderly frame that had
once been a stout little ship, and as Mensah observed him and
approached, he asked:</p>

<p>"How much cargo has come ashore, Kwaku?"</p>

<p>Mensah flung out his hands and pointed to the litter on the
shore. "Small, small cargo come," said he. "One, two puncheons of
oil, two or tree dozen bags kernels, some bags copra, two, tree
bales Manchester goods&mdash;finish."</p>

<p>"I don't see any Manchester goods," said Osmond.</p>

<p>"No, sah. Dem country people. Dey darn tief. Dey take eberyting.
Dey no leave nutting"; and in confirmation he pointed to sundry
little caravans of men, women, and children, all heavily laden and
all hurrying homeward, which were visible, mostly in the distance.
Indeed, Osmond had met several of them on his way.</p>

<p>"You have not seen any ivory?"</p>

<p>"No, sah. I look for um proper but I no see um."</p>

<p>"Nor any big crates or cases?"</p>

<p>"No, sah. Only de bales and crates of Manchester goods, and de
country people break dem up."</p>

<p>"Has the captain&mdash;the dead man&mdash;come ashore?"</p>

<p>"Yas, sah. He live for dat place," and Mensah pointed to a spot
at the eastern end of the beach where a clump of coconut palms grew
almost at high-water mark. Thither Osmond proceeded with Mensah,
and there, at the spot indicated, he found the uncomely corpse of
the little skipper lying amidst a litter of loose planks and small
flotsam, on the wet sand in the wash of the sea, and seeming to
wince as the spent waves alternately pushed it forward and drew it
back.</p>

<p>"Mensah," said Osmond, looking down gravely at the body, "this
man my countryman, my friend. You sabby?"</p>

<p>"Yas, sah. I sabby he be your brudder."</p>

<p>"Well, I am going to bury him in the compound with Mr. Larkom
and Mr. Osmond."</p>

<p>"Yas, sah," said Mensah, with a somewhat puzzled expression.
That second grave was a mystery that had caused him much secret
cogitation. But discretion had restrained him from asking
questions.</p>

<p>"You think," pursued Osmond, "these people fit for bring the
dead man to Adaffia?"</p>

<p>"Dey fit," replied Mensah, "s'pose you dash um plenty
money."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Osmond, with characteristic incaution, "see
that he is brought in and I will pay them what they ask."</p>

<p>"I go look dem people one time," said Mensah, who had instantly
decided that, on these advantageous terms, he would undertake the
contract himself.</p>

<p>Before starting to walk back, Osmond took another glance at the
wreckage and at the crowd of natives who were, even now, carrying
it away piecemeal. For a moment he had a thought of constituting
himself Lloyd's agent and taking possession of what was left. But
he had no authority, and as the mere wreckage was of no realizable
value, and as the little cargo there had been was already carried
away, he dismissed the idea and set out homeward, leaving the
delighted natives in undisputed possession.</p>

<p>His first proceeding on arriving home was to unlock the safe and
break open the leathern bags to see what directions Captain Hartup
had given as to the disposal of his property. He was not entirely
unprepared to find that the captain had formally transferred the
gold-dust to him. But he was totally unprepared for the contents of
the bulky paper which he drew out of the second bag, and as he
opened and read it he could hardly believe the evidence of his
eyesight. The paper was a regularly-drawn will, witnessed by Winter
and Simmons, which made 'my friend and temporary mate, Mr. James
Cook', sole executor and legatee.</p>

<p>It began with a preamble, setting forth that 'I, Nicholas
Hartup, being a widower without offspring, dependants, or near
relations, give and bequeath my worldly possessions to the man who
has dealt with me honestly, faithfully, and without thought of
material profit or reward' and then went on to make the specific
bequests, describing each of the items clearly and in detail. These
included the gold-dust, giving the exact weight, a consignment of
ivory consisting of 'thirty-nine large tusks in three large crates,
at present in the hold of the brigantine <i>Speedwell</i>, and
fifty-one scribellos in a large canvas bag wired up and sealed,
also in the hold' also the vessel herself, and, most astonishing of
all, 'my freehold house in Bristol, known as number sixty-five
Garlic Street' and a sum of about three thousand pounds, a part
invested in certain named securities and the remainder lying on
deposit at a specified bank in Bristol. It was an amazing document.
As Osmond read and re-read it he found himself wondering at the
perverseness of the little shipmaster in hiding his kindly,
appreciative feelings under so forbidding an exterior; but, to
judge by the wording of the preamble, his experience of men would
seem not to have been happy. Osmond, having put back the will in
the bag, tied up that and the other and replaced them in the safe.
As he locked the door and pocketed the key, he reflected on the
irony of his present position. In all the years during which he had
lived amidst his friends and relatives, no one had ever bequeathed
to him a single penny. Yet in the course of a few months, in this
unfrequented and forgotten corner of the world, he had twice been
made the sole legatee of almost complete strangers. And now he had
be come a man of modest substance, an owner of landed property; and
that in a country which prudence insisted that he must never
revisit.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>IX. &mdash; ARMS AND THE
MAN</h2>

<p class="first">SPEAKING in general terms, Welshmen cannot be
fairly described as excessively rare creatures; in fact, there are
some parts of the world&mdash;Wales, for instance&mdash;in which
they are quite common. But circumstances alter cases. When Jack
Osmond, busily engaged in posting up his account-books, lifted his
eyes and beheld a specimen of this well-known type of mammal, he
was quite startled; not merely because he had never before heard
anyone say "Good morning" with an accent on the "ning"&mdash;which
the present example did, although it was actually three in the
afternoon&mdash;but because no ship had called in the neighbourhood
quite lately and he had not known of the presence of any European
in the village.</p>

<p>The stranger introduced himself by the name of Jones, which
being not entirely without precedent was accepted without
difficulty. He had an additional name, but as Osmond failed to
assimilate it, and it could be expressed in writing only by an
extravagant expenditure of l's and double d's, it is omitted from
this merely Saxon chronicle. He shook Osmond's hand exuberantly and
smiled until his face&mdash;particularly the left side&mdash;was as
full of lines as a ground-plan of Willesden Junction.</p>

<p>"I come to you, Mr. Larkom," said the visitor, retaining
Osmond's unwilling hand and apparently adopting the name that
remained unaltered over the door of the factory, "as a
fellow-countryman in distress, craving a charitable judgment and a
helping hand."</p>

<p>He would have been well advised to leave it at that; for
Osmond's natural generosity needed no spur, and the memory of his
own misfortunes was enough to ensure his charity to others. But Mr.
Jones continued, smiling harder than ever: "I come to you
confidently for this help because of the many instances of your
kindness and generosity and good-fellowship that I have
heard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From whom?" interrupted Osmond.</p>

<p>"From&mdash;er&mdash;from&mdash;well, I may say, from every one
on the Coast who knows you."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Osmond; and his face relaxed into a grim smile. Jones
saw that he had made a mistake and wondered what the deuce it
was.</p>

<p>"Come into my room," said Osmond, "and tell me what you want me
to do. Have a cocktail?"</p>

<p>Mr. Jones would have a cocktail, thank you; and while Osmond
twirled the swizzle-stick and raised a pink froth in the tumbler,
he cautiously opened his business.</p>

<p>"I am taking some risk in telling you of my little affair, but I
am sure I can trust you not to give me away."</p>

<p>"Certainly you can," Osmond replied, incautiously.</p>

<p>"You promise on your honour as a gentleman not to give me
away?"</p>

<p>"I have," said Osmond, handing him the cocktail.</p>

<p>Jones still hesitated somewhat, as if desirous of further
formalities, but at length plunged into the matter in a persuasive
whisper, with much gesticulation and a craftily watchful eye on
Osmond's face.</p>

<p>It was not an encouraging face. A portrait of the 'Iron Duke' at
the age of thirty, executed in very hard wood by a heavy-handed
artist with a large chisel and mallet, would give you the kind of
face that Mr. Jones looked upon; and as the 'little affair'
unfolded itself, that face grew more and more wooden. For Osmond's
charity in respect of errors of conduct did not extend to those
that were merely in contemplation.</p>

<p>It transpired gradually that Mr. Jones's sufferings and distress
were occasioned by a little cargo that he had been unable to land;
which cargo happened to include&mdash;er&mdash;in fact, to be quite
candid, consisted largely of Mauser rifles, together with some
miscellaneous knick-knacks&mdash;such as Mauser cartridges, for
instance&mdash;all of which were at present rolling in the hold of
a privately-chartered vessel (name not mentioned). It also appeared
that the Colonial Government had most unreasonably prohibited the
importation of arms and ammunition on account of the silly little
insurrection that had broken out inland; which very circumstance
created an exceptional opportunity&mdash;don't you
understand?&mdash;for disposing of munitions of war on profitable
terms. It appeared, finally, that Mr. Larkom's factory was an ideal
place in which to conceal the goods and from which to distribute
them among local sportsmen interested in target-practice or
partridge-shooting.</p>

<p>"To put it in a nutshell," said Osmond, "you're doing a bit of
gun-running and you want to use me as a cat's paw; and to put it in
another nutshell, I'll see you damned first."</p>

<p>"But," protested Jones, "you sell arms yourself, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Not while this row is on. Besides, the niggers don't buy my
gas-pipes for war-palaver. My customers are mostly hunters from the
bush."</p>

<p>Mr. Jones lingered a while to ply the arts of persuasion and
consume two more cocktails; and when at last he departed, more in
sorrow than in anger, he paused on the threshold to remark:</p>

<p>"You have promised, on your honour, not to give me away."</p>

<p>"I know I have, like a fool," replied Osmond "Wish I hadn't.
Know better next time. Good day." And he followed his departing
guest to the compound gate and shut it after him.</p>

<p>From that moment Mr. Jones seemed to vanish into thin air. He
was seen no more in the village, and no whispers as to his
movements came from outside. But a few nights later Osmond had a
rather curious experience that somehow recalled his absent
acquaintance. He had gone out, according to his common custom, to
take a quiet stroll on the beach before turning in, and think of
his future movements and of the everlasting might-have-been. Half a
mile west of the village he came on a fishing canoe, drawn up above
tide-marks, and as he had just filled his pipe he crept under the
lee of the canoe to light it&mdash;for one learns to husband one's
matches in West Africa. Having lighted his pipe, he sat down to
think over a trading expedition that he had projected, but, finding
himself annoyed by the crabs, which at nightfall pour out of their
burrows in myriads, he shifted to the interior of the canoe. Here
he sat, looking over the spectral breakers out into the dark void
which was the sea, and immersed in his thoughts until he was
startled by the sudden appearance of a light. He watched it
curiously and not without suspicion. It was not a ship's
anchor-light, nor was it a flare-lamp in a fishing-canoe. By the
constant variation in its brightness Osmond judged it to be a
bull's-eye lantern which was being flashed to and fro along the
coast from some vessel in the offing to signal to someone
ashore.</p>

<p>He looked up and down the dark beach for the answering signal,
and presently caught a dull glimmer, as of a bull's-eye lantern
seen from one side, proceeding from the beach a short distance
farther west. Watching this spot, he soon made out a patch of
deeper darkness which grew in extent, indicating that a crowd of
natives had gathered at the water's edge; and, after a considerable
interval a momentary flash of the lantern fell on a boat dashing
towards the beach in a smother of spray.</p>

<p>Soon after this a number of dark shapes began to separate
themselves from the mass and move in single file across the low
sand-dunes, passing within a few dozen yards of the canoe. Osmond
could see them distinctly, though himself unseen; a long procession
of carriers, each bearing a load on his head; and whereas some of
these loads were of an oblong shape, like small
gun-crates&mdash;about the length of a Mauser rifle&mdash;the
others were more nearly cubical and quite small, though obviously
heavy. Osmond watched the file of carriers and counted upwards of
forty loads. Perhaps it was none of his business. But as those
parcels of death and destruction were borne silently away into the
darkness to swell the tale of slaughter in the inland villages, he
cursed Mr. Jones and his own folly in giving that unconsidered
promise.</p>

<p>The last of the carriers had vanished and he had just risen from
the canoe to return up the now deserted beach when a new phenomenon
presented itself. The clouds which had hidden the rising moon,
thinned for a few moments, leaving a patch of coppery light in the
eastern sky; and against this, sharp and distinct as if cut out of
black paper, stood the shape of a schooner. But not an ordinary
trading schooner. Brief as was the gleam that rendered her visible,
her character was perfectly obvious to a yachtsman's eye. She was a
large yacht of the type that was fashionable when the America Cup
was new; when spoon bows and bulb keels were things as yet
undreamed of. Osmond stared at her in astonishment; and even as he
looked, the clouds closed up, the sky drew dark, and she was lost
in the blackness of the night.</p>

<p>He was up betimes on the following morning and out on the beach
in the grey dawn to see if any confirmatory traces of these
mysterious proceedings were visible. But his questioning eye ranged
over the grey sea in vain. The schooner had vanished as if she had
never been. There were, however, multitudinous tracks of bare feet
leading up from the shore to the sand-hills, where they were lost;
deep footprints such as would be made by heavily-laden men. And
there was something else, even more significant. Just at high-water
mark, hardly clear of the wash of the sea, was a ship's boat, badly
battered, broken-backed, and with one bilge stove in. Some fool,
who knew not the West Coast surf, had evidently landed a heavy
lading in her with this inevitable result.</p>

<p>But it was not her condition alone that caused Osmond to stride
so eagerly towards her. There was something in her size and build
that he seemed to recognize. As he reached her, he walked round to
examine her stern. There had, of course, been a name painted on her
transom, but it had been scraped out and the stern re-painted. Then
Osmond stepped in and lifted one of the bottom-boards; and there,
on the starboard side close to the keel, was a patch covered with
sheet-copper, while inspection from without showed an external
covering of copper. There was no mistaking that patch. It was his
own handiwork. This poor battered wreck was the <i>Speedwell's</i>
long-boat; and as he realized this, he realized, too, what had
become of the <i>Speedwell's</i> cargo.</p>

<p>The discovery gave Osmond considerable food for thought for the
remainder of the morning. But about mid-day an unlooked-for letter
from Betty arrived and for the time being occupied his attention to
the exclusion of all other matters. And not entirely without
reason. For it conveyed tidings of a somewhat disturbing kind. The
message was, indeed, smuggled in inconsequently, as important
messages often are in ladies' letters, at he end. But there it was;
and Osmond read it with deep disapproval and no small
uneasiness.</p>

<p>"You will probably not hear from me again for a week or two as I
am going for a little trip inland and may not have a chance to send
a letter. I shall let you know directly I get back, and until you
hear from me you had better not write&mdash;or, at least, you can
write, and make it a nice long letter, but don't send it until you
get mine."</p>

<p>That was the message. She did not give a hint as to the region
into which the 'little trip' would take her. But Osmond had a
strong and uncomfortable suspicion that her route would take her
into the country at the back of the great lagoon and would bring
her finally to Adaffia.</p>

<p>He pondered the situation at length. As to the danger of such a
journey, it was probably negligible&mdash;if the reports were
correct. The disturbed area was far away to the north, on the
borders of Krepi. The country at the back of the lagoon was
believed to be quite peaceful and safe. But one never knew. These
Efé peoples were naturally warlike and turbulent. At any moment
they might break out in support of their inland relatives. Even now
they might have provided themselves with some of Mr. Jones's
knick-knacks and be preparing for "war-palaver."</p>

<p>The result of his cogitations was somewhat curious and not very
easy to understand. For some time past he had been turning over in
his mind a project which had really been held up by the regular
arrival of Betty's letters. That project was concerned with a
trading expedition to the interior&mdash;to the country at the back
of the lagoon. But that 'little trip' would have taken him out of
the region in which the receipt of letters was possible, and he had
accordingly put it off to some more opportune time. Now that more
opportune time seemed to have arrived. There would be no more
letters for a week or two, so there was nothing to prevent him from
starting. That was how he put it to himself, What was actually in
his mind it is impossible to guess. Whether his purpose was to be
absent from Adaffia when Betty should make her inevitable visit, to
avoid the meeting for which he had yearned but which he felt to be
so undesirable; or whether he had some vague hopes of a possible
encounter on the road: who can say? Certainly not the present
chronicler, and probably not Osmond himself. At any rate, the
upshot of it was that he decided on the journey, and with
characteristic promptitude set about his preparations forthwith;
and as they were far from elaborate and had been well considered
before hand, a single day's work saw everything ready for the
start.</p>

<p>On the following morning he set forth, leaving the faithful
Mensah in charge of the factory. A dozen carriers bore the loads of
goods for the trading venture, and his recently engaged servant,
Koffi Kuma, carried his simple necessaries in a light box. In spite
of his anxieties and haunting regrets, he was in high spirits at
the promised change from the monotony of Adaffia, which, but for
the infinitely precious letters, would have been intolerably
wearisome. The universal sand, varied only by the black lagoon mud,
the everlasting coconut palms chattering incessantly in the breeze,
and the bald horizon of the unpeopled sea, had begotten in him an
intense yearning for a change of scene; for the sight of veritable
trees with leaves, growing in actual earth, and of living things
other than the sea-birds and the amphibious denizens of the
beach.</p>

<p>A couple of hours' steady marching carried him and his little
party across the bare plain of dry mud that had once been part of
the great lagoon and brought him to the mainland and the little
nine-inch trail that did duty as a road. Gleefully he strode along
in the rear of his little caravan, refreshing his eyes and ears
with the novel sights and sounds. The tiresome boom of the surf had
faded into a distant murmur that mingled with the stirring of
leaves; strange birds, unseen in the bush, piped queer little
Gregorian chants, while others, silent, but gorgeous of
plumage&mdash;scarlet cardinals and rainbow-hued
sun-birds&mdash;disported themselves visibly among the foliage.
Little striped Barbary mice gambolled beside the track, and great,
blue-bodied lizards with scarlet heads and tails perched on the
tall ant-hills that rose on all sides like pink monuments, and
nodded their heads defiantly at the passing strangers. It was a new
world to Osmond. The bright pink soil, the crowded bush, the
buttressed forest trees, the uncouth baobabs, with their colossal
trunks and absurdly dwarfed branches&mdash;all were new and
delightful after the monotony of the beach village, and so fully
occupied his attention that when they entered a hamlet of
pink-walled houses, he was content to leave the trading to Koffi,
while he watched a troop of dog-faced monkeys who seemed to have
established a sort of modus vivendi with the villagers.</p>

<p>Thus, with occasional halts for rest or barter, the caravan
worked its way through the bush until about four o'clock in the
afternoon; when Osmond, who had lagged behind to avoid the chatter
of his carriers, rounded a sharp turn in the road and found himself
entering the main street of a village. But he was not the only
visitor. An instantaneous glance showed him a couple of stands of
piled arms, by the side of which some half-dozen bare-footed native
soldiers were seated on the ground eating from a large calabash; a
fierce and sullen looking native, secured with manacles and a
leading-rope and guarded by two more of the Hausa soldiers as he
was fed by some of the villagers; and two white officers, seated
under the village shade tree and engaged at the moment in
conversation with Koffi, who seemed to have been captured by a
Hausa sergeant.</p>

<p>As Osmond came in sight the two officers looked at one another
and rose with a rather stiff salutation.</p>

<p>"You are Mr. Cook of Adaffia, I understand?" one of them
said.</p>

<p>"Yes," Osmond replied; and as the two officers again looked at
one another with an air of some embarrassment, he continued,
bluntly: "I suppose you want to know if I have got any contraband
of war?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know," was the half-apologetic reply, "someone has
been selling rifles and ammunition to the natives, so we have to
make inquiries."</p>

<p>"Of course you do," said Osmond; "and you'd better have a look
at my goods. Koffi, tell the carriers to bring their loads here and
open them."</p>

<p>A very perfunctory inspection was enough to satisfy the
constabulary officers of the harmless character of the trade goods,
and having made it, they introduced themselves by the respective
names of Stockbridge and Westall and invited Osmond to join them in
their interrupted tea under the shade tree.</p>

<p>"Troublesome affair this rising," said Westall, as he handed
Osmond a mug of tea; "there'll be wigs on the green before it's
over. Now that the beggars have got rifles, they are ready to stand
up to the constabulary. Think they're as good as we are; and
they're not so far wrong, either."</p>

<p>"Where are you bound for now?" Osmond asked.</p>

<p>"We are going back to Quittah with some prisoners from Agotimé."
Westall nodded at the manacled native and added: "That's one of the
ring-leaders&mdash;a rascal named Zippah; a devil of a fellow,
vicious as a bush-cat and plucky, too. Stockbridge and I are
keeping him with us, in case of a rescue, but there are over a
dozen other prisoners with the main body of Hausas. They marched
out of the village just before you turned up."</p>

<p>"And we'd better be marching out, too," said Stockbridge, "or we
shan't catch them up. Will you have any more tea, Cook? If not,
we'd better get on the road. There's only a native sergeant-major
with those men ahead. Are you coming our way?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Osmond, "I'll come with you as far as
Affieringba, and then work my way home along the north shore of the
lagoon."</p>

<p>The three Englishman rose, and, as Westall's servant repacked
the tea apparatus, the little procession formed up. The six Hausas
led with fixed bayonets; then came Westall followed by the
prisoner, Zippah, and his guard; next came half a dozen carriers
loaded with bundles of confiscated muskets and powder then Osmond
and Stockbridge; and the rear was brought up by Osmond's carriers
and the three servants.</p>

<p>The road, or path, after leaving the village, passed through a
number of yam and cassava plantations and then entered a forest of
fan-palms; a dim and ghostly place now that the sun was getting
low, pervaded by a universal rustling from the broad, ragged leaves
above and a noisy crackling from the dry branches underfoot. For
nearly an hour the party threaded its way through the gloomy
aisles, then the palms gradually thinned out, giving place to
ordinary forest trees and bush.</p>

<p>"Quite pleasant to get a look at the sky again," Osmond remarked
as they came out into the thin forest.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stockbridge; "but you won't see it for long. There's
a bamboo thicket just ahead."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke there loomed up before them an immense, cloudy
mass of soft, blue-green foliage; then appeared a triangular black
hole like the entrance to a tunnel, into which the Hausas, the
prisoners, and the carriers successively vanished. A moment later
and Osmond himself had entered through that strange portal and was
groping his way in almost total darkness through a narrow passage,
enclosed and roofed in by solid masses of bamboo stalks. Ahead, he
could dimly make out the vague shapes of the carriers, while all
around the huge clusters of bamboos rose like enormous piers,
widening out until they met overhead to form a kind of groined
roof. It was an uncanny place; a place in which voices echoed
weirdly, mingling with strange, unexplained noises and with the
unceasing, distant murmur of the soft foliage far away over
head.</p>

<p>Osmond stumbled on over the crackling canes that formed the
floor, gradually growing accustomed to the darkness until there
appeared ahead a triangular spot of light that grew slowly larger,
framing the figures of the Hausas and carriers; and then, quite
suddenly, he emerged, blinking, into broad daylight on the margin
of a smallish but deep and rapid river, which at this spot was
spanned by a primitive bridge.</p>

<p>Now a native bridge is an excellent contrivance&mdash;for
natives; for the booted European it is much less suitable. The
present one was formed of the slender trunk of a young silk-cotton
tree, barkless and polished by years of wear, and Osmond watched
enviously as the Hausas strolled across, grasping the cylindrical
surface handily with their bare feet, and wondered if he had not
better take off his boots. However, Westall had no false pride.
Recognizing the disabilities involved by boots, he stooped, and,
getting astride the slender log, crossed the river with ease and
safety, if without much dignity; and the other two white men were
not too proud to follow his example.</p>

<p>Beyond the river the path, after crossing a narrow belt of
forest, entered a valley bordered by hills covered with dense bush,
which rose steeply on either side. Osmond looked at the little
party ahead, straggling in single file along the bottom of the
valley, and inwardly wondered where Westall had picked up his
strategy.</p>

<p>"It's to be hoped, Stockbridge," he remarked, "that there are
none of Mr. Zippah's friends hanging about here. You couldn't want
a prettier spot for an ambush."</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken when a tall man, wearing a hunter's
lionskin cap and carrying a musket, stepped quietly out of the bush
on to the track just in front of Westall. The prisoner, Zippah,
uttered a yell of recognition and held up his manacled hands. The
deep, cannon-like report of the musket rang out and the narrow
gorge was filled with a dense cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>There was an instant's silence. Then a scattering volley was
heard from the Hausas ahead, the panic-stricken carriers came
flying back along the trail, shouting with terror, and the two
white men plunged forward into the stinking smoke. Leaping over the
prostrate Zippah, who was being held down by two Hausas, they came
upon Westall, lying across the path, limp and motionless. A great
ragged patch on his breast, all scorched and bloody, told the tale
that his pinched, grey face and glazing eyes confirmed. Indeed,
even as they stooped over him, heedless of the bellowing muskets
and the slugs that shrieked past, he drew one shallow breath and
was gone.</p>

<p>There was no time for sentiment. With set faces the two men
turned from the dead officer and ran forward to where the shadowy
forms of the Hausas appeared through the smoke, holding their
ground doggedly and firing right and left into the bush. But a
single glance showed the hopelessness of the position. Two of the
Hausas were down, and of the remaining four, three, including the
sergeant, were more or less wounded. Not a man of the enemy was to
be seen, but from the wooded slope on either hand came jets of
flame and smoke, accompanied by the thunderous reports of the
muskets and the whistle of flying slugs, while a thick cloud of
smoke rolled down the hillsides and filled the bottom of the valley
as with a dense fog.</p>

<p>Osmond snatched up the rifle of one of the fallen Hausas and,
clearing out the man's cartridge-pouch, began firing into likely
spots in the bush when Stockbridge interposed. "It's no go, Cook.
We must fall back across the bridge. You clear out while you've got
a whole skin. Hallo! did you hear that? Those weren't trade
guns."</p>

<p>As he spoke there were heard, mingling with the noisy explosions
of the muskets, a succession of sharp, woody reports, each followed
by the musical hum of a high-speed bullet.</p>

<p>"Back you go, Cook," he urged. "This is no place for&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short, staggered back a few paces, and fell, cursing
volubly, with a bloody hand clasped on his leg just below the
knee.</p>

<p>Osmond stooped over him, and, finding that the bone was not
broken, quickly tied his handkerchief over the wound to restrain
the bleeding. "That will do for the present," said he. "Now you
tell the men to fall back, and I'll bring the prisoner."</p>

<p>"Never mind the prisoner," said Stockbridge. "Get the wounded
back and get back yourself."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Osmond. "The prisoner is going to cover our
retreat. Put your arm round the sergeant's neck and hop along on
your sound leg."</p>

<p>In spite of the galling fire, the retreat was carried out
quickly and in good order. Stockbridge was hustled away by the
sergeant&mdash;who was only disabled in one arm&mdash;and the two
helpless men and the dead officer were borne off by the three
native servants. Meanwhile Osmond took possession of the
prisoner&mdash;just as one of his guards was preparing to cut his
throat with a large and very unofficial-looking knife&mdash;and,
rapidly pinioning his arms with the leading-rope, held him up with
his face towards the enemy; in which position he served as
excellent cover, not only for Osmond but also for the two Hausas,
who were able to keep up a brisk fire over his shoulders.</p>

<p>In this fashion Osmond and his two supporters slowly backed
after the retreating party. The firing from the bush practically
ceased, since the enemy had now no mark to fire at but their own
chief; and though they continued to follow up, as the moving bushes
showed, their wholesome respect for the Snider rifle&mdash;with
which the Hausas were armed&mdash;prevented them from coming out of
cover or approaching dangerously near.</p>

<p>In less than a quarter of an hour the open space by the river
was reached; and here Osmond's retreat was covered by the rest of
the party, who had crossed the river and had taken up a safe
position in the bamboo thicket, whence they could, without exposing
themselves, command the approaches to the bridge. The two Hausas
were turning to run across the log when Osmond noticed a large
basket of produce&mdash;containing among other things, a number of
balls of shea butter&mdash;which one of his carriers had dropped in
retreat.</p>

<p>"Hi!" he sang out, "pick up that basket and take him across,";
and then, as a new idea suggested itself: "Put those balls of shea
tulu in my pocket."</p>

<p>The astonished Hausa hesitated, especially as a Mauser bullet
had just hummed past his head, but when Osmond repeated the order
impatiently he hurriedly grabbed up the unsavoury-looking balls of
grease and emptied them into Osmond's pocket. Then he turned and
ran across the bridge.</p>

<p>Osmond continued to back towards the river, still holding the
struggling Zippah close before him as a shield. Arriving at the end
of the bridge, he cautiously sat down and got astride the log,
pulling his captive, with some difficulty, into the same position,
and began to wriggle across. Once started, Zippah was docile
enough; for, with his pinioned arms, he could not afford to fall
into the swirling water. He even assisted his captor so far as he
was able, being evidently anxious to get the perilous passage over
as quickly as possible. When they had crept about a third of the
way across, Osmond took one of the balls of shea butter from his
pocket and, reaching past his prisoner, smeared the mass thickly on
the smooth surface of the log; and this proceeding he repeated at
intervals as he retired, leaving a thick trail of the solid grease
behind him. Zippah was at first profoundly mystified by the white
man's manoeuvres, which he probably regarded as some kind of fetish
ceremonial or magic; but when its purpose suddenly dawned on him,
his sullen face relaxed into a broad and appreciative grin, and as
he was at length dragged backwards from the head of the bridge,
through the opening into the dark bamboo thicket, he astonished the
besieged party (and no doubt the besiegers also) by letting off a
peal of honest African guffaws.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>X. &mdash; BETTY'S APPEAL</h2>

<p class="first">As the prisoner was withdrawn by his guard into
the dark opening of the thicket, Osmond halted for a moment to look
back across the river. Not a sign of the enemy was to be seen
excepting the pall of smoke that hung over the wooded shore. But
the reports of unseen muskets and rifles and the hum of slugs and
bullets warned him of the danger of exposing himself&mdash;though
he, too, was probably hidden from the enemy by the dense smoke of
the black powder. Accordingly he turned quickly and, plunging into
the dark tunnel-like passage, groped his way forward, unable, at
first, to distinguish anything in the all-pervading gloom.
Presently he perceived a little distance ahead a cluster of the
great bamboo stalks faintly lighted as if by a hidden fire or
torch, and a moment later, a turn of the passage brought him in
view of the light itself, which seemed to be a rough shea-butter
candle or lamp, set on the ground and lighting up dimly the forlorn
little band whose retreat he had covered.</p>

<p>This much he took in at the first glance. But suddenly he became
aware of a new presence at the sight of which he stopped short with
a smothered exclamation. Stockbridge, sitting beside his dead
comrade, had uncovered his wounded leg; and kneeling by him as she
applied a dressing to the wound was a woman. He could not see her
face, which was partly turned away from him and concealed by a wide
pith helmet; but the figure was&mdash;to him&mdash;unmistakable, as
were the little, dainty, capable hands on which the flickering
light shone. He approached slowly, and as Stockbridge greeted him
with a wry grin, she turned her head quickly and looked up at him.
"Good evening, Mr. Cook," she said, quietly. "What a fortunate
chance it is that you should be here."</p>

<p>"Yes, by Jove," agreed Stockbridge; "at least a fortunate chance
for us. He is a born tactician."</p>

<p>Osmond briefly acknowledged the greeting, and in the ensuing
silence, as Betty methodically applied the bandage, he looked about
him and rapidly assessed the situation. Stockbridge looked weak and
spent and was evidently in considerable pain, though he uttered no
complaint; the wounded Hausas lay hard by, patiently awaiting their
turn to have their injuries attended to, and the carriers crouched
disconsolately in gloomy corners out of the way of chance missiles.
A continuous firing was being kept up from the other side of the
river, and slugs and Mauser bullets ploughed noisily through the
bamboo, though none came near the fugitives. The position of the
latter, indeed, was one of great natural strength, for the river
made a horse-shoe bend at this spot and the little peninsula
enclosed by it was entirely occupied by the bamboo. An attack was
possible in only two directions; by the bridge, or by the path that
entered the thicket at the other end.</p>

<p>"Well," said Osmond, as Betty, having finished the dressing,
transferred her attention to one of the wounded Hausas, "here we
are, safe for the moment. They can't get at us in here."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Stockbridge. "It's a strong position, if we could
stay here, though they will probably try to rush the bridge when
it's dark."</p>

<p>Osmond shook his head with a grim smile. "They won't do that,"
said he. "I've taken the precaution to grease the log; so they'll
have to crawl across carefully, which they won't care to do with
the Hausas potting at them from shelter. But we can't stay here.
We'd better clear out as soon as it is dark; and the question is,
which way?"</p>

<p>"We must follow the river, I suppose," said Stockbridge, in a
faint voice. "But you'd better arrange with the sergeant. I'm no
good now. Tell him he's to take your orders. Our carriers know the
country."</p>

<p>The sergeant, who had witnessed Osmond's masterly retreat,
accepted the new command without demur. A guard was posted to watch
the bridge from safe cover, and the carriers were assembled to
discuss the route.</p>

<p>"Now," said Osmond, "where is the next bridge?" There was
apparently no other bridge, but there was a ford some miles farther
up, and a couple of miles below there was a village which possessed
one or two of the large, punt-shaped canoes that were used for
trading across the lagoon.</p>

<p>"S'pose dey no fit to pass de bridge," said the head carrier,
"dey go and fetch canoe for carry um across de river."</p>

<p>"I see," said Osmond. "Then they'd attack us from the rear and
we should be bottled up from both sides. That won't do. You must
get ready to march out as soon as it is dark, sergeant. Your
carriers can take Mr. Westall's body and some of the wounded and
the sound men must carry the rest. And send my carriers back the
way they came. There are too many of us as it is."</p>

<p>"And dem muskets and powder, dat we bring in from the villages?"
said the sergeant. "What we do wid dem?"</p>

<p>"We must leave them here or throw them in the river. Anyhow, you
get off as quickly as you can."</p>

<p>The sergeant set about his preparations without delay and
Osmond's carriers departed gleefully towards the safe part of the
country. Meanwhile Osmond considered the situation. If the enemy
obtained canoes from the lower river, they would probably ferry a
party across and attack the bamboo fortress from front and rear
simultaneously. Then they would find the nest empty, and naturally
would start in pursuit; which would be unpleasant for the helpless
fugitives, crawling painfully along the river bank. He turned the
position over again and again with deep dissatisfaction, while
Stockbridge watched him anxiously and Betty silently continued her
operations on the wounded. If they were pursued, they were lost. In
their helpless condition they could make no sort of stand against a
large body attacking from the cover of the bush. And the pursuit
would probably commence before they had travelled a couple of miles
towards safety.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eye fell on the heap of captured muskets and
powder-kegs that, were to be left behind or destroyed. He looked at
them meditatively, and, as he looked, there began to shape itself
in his mind a plan by which the fugitives might at least increase
their start by a mile or so. A fantastic scheme, perhaps, but yet,
in the absence of any better, worth trying.</p>

<p>With characteristic energy, he set to work at once, while the
carriers hastily fashioned rough litters of bamboo for the dead and
wounded. Broaching one of the powder-kegs, he proceeded to load all
but two of the muskets&mdash;of which there were twenty-three in
all&mdash;cramming the barrels with powder and filling up each with
a heavy charge of gravel. Six of the loaded and primed muskets he
laid on the ground about fifty yards from the bridge end of the
long passage, with their muzzles pointing towards the bridge; the
remaining fifteen he laid in batches of five about the same
distance from the opposite entrance, towards which their muzzles
pointed. Then, taking a length of the plaited cord with which the
muskets had been lashed into bundles, he tied one end to the stock
of one of the unloaded guns and the other to the trigger of one of
the wounded Hausas' rifles. Fixing the rifle upright against the
bamboo with its muzzle stuck in the half-empty powder-keg, of which
he broke out two or three staves, he carried the cord&mdash;well
greased with shea butter&mdash;through a loop tied to one of the
slanting bamboos. Then he propped the musket in a standing position
on two bamboo sticks, to one of which he attached another length of
cord. It was the mechanism of the common sieve bird-trap. When the
cord was pulled, the stick would be dislodged, the musket would
fall, and in falling jerk the other cord and fire the rifle.</p>

<p>Broaching another keg, he carried a large train of powder from
the first keg to the row of loaded muskets, over the pans of which
he poured a considerable heap. Leaving the tripping-cord loose, he
next proceeded to the opposite end of the thicket and set up a
similar trap near the landward entrance, connecting it by a large
powder train with the three batches of loaded muskets.</p>

<p>"You seemed to be deuced busy, Cook," Stockbridge remarked as
Osmond passed the hammock in which he was now reclining.</p>

<p>"Yes," Osmond replied; "I am arranging a little entertainment to
keep our friends amused while we are getting a start. Now,
sergeant, if you are ready, you had better gag the prisoner and
move outside the bamboos. It will be dark in a few minutes. And
give me Mr. Westall's revolver and pouch."</p>

<p>At this moment, Betty, having applied such "first aid" as was
possible to the wounded Hausas, came to him and said in a low
voice:</p>

<p>"Jim, dear, you will let me help you, if I can, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I will, dearest," he replied, "though I wish to God
you weren't here."</p>

<p>"I don't," said she. "If it comes to the worst, we shall go out
together. But it won't. I am not a bit frightened now you are with
me."</p>

<p>"I see you have given Stockbridge your hammock," said he. "How
far do you think you can walk?"</p>

<p>"Twenty miles, easily, or more at night. Now, Jim, don't worry
about me. Just tell me what I am to do and forget me. You have
plenty to think about."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I want you and Stockbridge to keep in the middle of
the column. The carrier who knows the way will lead, and the
sergeant and I will march at the rear to look out for the pursuers.
And you must get along as fast as you can."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," she replied, smiling in his face and raising
her hand smartly to the peak of her helmet; and without another
word she turned away to take her place in the retiring column.</p>

<p>As the little procession moved towards the opening, Osmond ran
back to the bridge end of the track to clear out the guard before
he set his traps. A brisk fusillade was proceeding from the
concealed enemy when he arrived, to which the guards were replying
from their cover.</p>

<p>"I tink dey fit for come across de bridge," one of the Hausas
remarked as Osmond gave them the orders to retire.</p>

<p>"Very well," he replied; "you be off one time. I stop to send
them back."</p>

<p>The two Hausas accordingly retired, reluctant and protesting,
and Osmond took their place behind the screen of bamboo, from which
he looked out across the river. It was evident by the constant
stirring of the bush and the occasional appearance of men in the
openings that some sort of move was in progress, and in fact the
footsteps of the two Hausas had hardly died away when it took
definite shape. The attack opened with a thundering volley which
sent the leaves and splinters of bamboo flying in all directions;
then, out of the bush, a compact body of warriors each armed with a
Mauser rifle, emerged in single file and advanced towards the
bridge at a smart trot. Osmond watched them with a grim smile. Down
the narrow track they came in perfect order and on to the foot of
the bridge, stepping along the smooth log with perfect security
they reached the greased portion. Then came the catastrophe. As the
leading warrior stepped on the greasy surface, his feet flew from
under him and down he slithered, grabbing frantically at the legs
of the next man, who instantly clawed hold of his neighbour and
thus passed on the disturbance. In a moment the whole file was
capsized like a row of ninepins, and as each man's rifle exploded
as he fell and the whole body broke out into simultaneous yells of
rage and terror, the orderly dignity of the attack was destroyed
utterly.</p>

<p>The cause of the disaster was not immediately perceived, and as
soon as the struggling warriors had been rescued from the river or
had drifted down stream, the attack was renewed, to end in another
wholesale capsize. After the third attempt, however, it apparently
began to dawn on the warriors that there was something unnatural
about the bridge. A noisy consultation followed, and when Osmond
opened a smart fire with his revolver, the entire body retreated
hastily into the bush.</p>

<p>As it was pretty certain that there would be no further attempt
to rush the bridge at present, and as the darkness was fast closing
in, Osmond proceeded to finish his arrangements before evacuating
the fortress. Having set the tripping-cord across the path about
six inches from the ground, he loaded and cocked the rifle. The
trap was now set. If the warriors should presently manage to crawl
across the bridge and enter the thicket, the first comer would
certainly strike the cord; and the musket volley and the flying
gravel, though they would probably do little harm, would send the
attacking party back to the cover of the bush.</p>

<p>Having set the trap, Osmond knocked in the heads of the
remaining powder-kegs and spread the powder about among the dry
dead bamboo stalks that covered the ground. Then he retired to the
landward end of the thicket, and, having set the second trap,
started in pursuit of his friends.</p>

<p>The fugitives had evidently travelled at a good pace despite
their encumbrances, for he had walked nearly a mile along the
riverside track before he overtook them. As he turned a sharp bend
he came on them quite suddenly, crouching down in the undergrowth
as if in hiding; and, as he appeared, the two Hausas who formed the
rear-guard motioned to him to crouch down too.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he whispered, kneeling beside the last Hausa.</p>

<p>"S't! Someone live for river. You no hear um, sah?"</p>

<p>Osmond listened attentively. From somewhere down the river came
a sound of muffled voices and the rhythmical swish of something
moving through water. He crept nearer to the brink and cautiously
peered through the bushes across the dark river. The sounds drew
nearer, and soon he could dimly make out the shapes of two long
canoes poling up-stream in the shallows on the other side. Each
canoe held only three or four men, just enough to drive it swiftly
against the stream; but in spite of this, there could be little
doubt as to the business on which these stealthily-moving craft
were bent. As they faded into the darkness, Osmond touched the
Hausa on the shoulder, and, whispering to him to follow, began
softly to retrace his steps. His experience of the happy-go-lucky
native had inspired him with a new hope.</p>

<p>Attended by the puzzled but obedient Hausa, he followed the
sound of the retreating canoes until it suddenly ceased. Then he
crept forward still more cautiously and presently caught sight of
the two craft, brought up under the opposite bank and filling
rapidly with men. He crouched down among the bushes and watched.
Very soon the canoes, now crowded with men, put out, one after the
other, and swiftly crossing the river, grounded on a small beach or
hard under the high bank; when the men, each of whom, as Osmond
could now see, carried a gun or rifle, landed and crept up a
sloping path. The canoe immediately put off and returned to the
other side, whence, having taken up a fresh batch of passengers
they crossed to the hard. This manoeuvre was repeated six times,
and, as each canoe carried over a dozen men, there were now
assembled on the near bank about a hundred and fifty warriors, who
remained in a mass, talking in hoarse undertones and waiting for
the word to advance.</p>

<p>The last load apparently completed the contingent, for, this
time, all the passengers landed and crept up the path, leaving the
two canoes drawn up on the hard. This was what Osmond had hoped for
and half expected. Feverishly he watched the mob of warriors form
up and move off in orderly single file, each shouldering his musket
or rifle and no one making a sound. As the silent procession
vanished towards the lately evacuated fortress, he craned forward
to see if any guards had been posted. But not a soul was in sight.
Then he stole along the track until he was above the hard, when he
turned to the Hausa.</p>

<p>"Wait," he whispered, "until I get the canoes. Then go back
quickly and tell the sergeant I come."</p>

<p>He crept down the path to the hard, and, stepping into one of
the canoes, walked to the stern, holding on to the second canoe. As
his weight depressed the stern, the bow lifted from the ground and
he was able to push off, walking slowly forward as the craft went
astern. Then, from the bow, he threw his weight on the stern of the
second canoe, which lifted free of the ground in the same manner,
and the two craft began silently to drift away down stream on the
swift current.</p>

<p>Osmond waved his free hand to the Hausa, and, when he had seen
the man steal away to carry the good tidings to the fugitives, he
set himself to secure the two canoes together. Each had a primitive
painter of grass rope rove through a hole in the bluff bow and a
small thwart or cross-band of the same material close to the stern
to strengthen the long sides. By making fast the painter of the
second canoe to the stern thwart of the one he was in, he secured
them together and left himself free to ply the pole; which he began
to do as noiselessly as possible, when he had drifted down about a
quarter of a mile from the hard, steering the canoes close along
the side on which his friends would be waiting. Presently there
came a soft hail from the bank; on which, checking their way with
the pole, he brought the two canoes up on a spit of sandy mud close
underneath.</p>

<p>As he stepped ashore, holding on to the painter of the leading
canoe, a little, white-skirted figure came scrambling down the
bank, and running to him, seized both his hands.</p>

<p>"Jim!" she whispered, "you are a wonder! You have saved us all!
Of course you have! I knew you would!" She gave his hands a final
squeeze and then abruptly returned to business. "I will see to the
wounded if you tell me where they are to go."</p>

<p>Osmond indicated the larger of the two canoes, and she at once
climbed up the bank to arrange the embarkation, while Osmond,
having drawn both canoes up on the spit, called to two of the
Hausas to take charge of the painters so that the craft should not
get adrift while loading. Then he went up to superintend. The first
problem, that of canoe-men, was easily solved, for the carriers,
who were natives of the lagoon country, all had some skill in the
use of the pole and cheerfully volunteered for duty.</p>

<p>But it was not without some difficulty that the three rough
litters&mdash;one of them containing the body of poor
Westall&mdash;were lowered down the steep bank and the wounded men
helped down to the spit; but when once they were there, the roomy,
punt-like canoes afforded ample and comfortable accommodation for
the whole party. The sound men, with three canoe-men and the
prisoner, were packed into the smaller canoe, leaving plenty of
space in the other for the wounded to lie at their ease.
Stockbridge's hammock was stowed in the bows, so that he should not
be disturbed by the movements of the canoe-men, the body of Westall
came next, decently covered with a country cloth, and then the rest
of the wounded. When all was ready, Betty and Osmond stepped on
board and took their places side by side in the stern.</p>

<p>As they pushed off into the river Stockbridge settled himself
comfortably on his pillow with a sigh of relief at exchanging the
jolting of the bush road for the easy motion of the canoe.</p>

<p>"By Jove, Cook!" he exclaimed, "it was a stroke of luck for us
that you happened to overtake us. But for your wits they would have
made a clean sweep of us. Hallo! What the deuce is that?"</p>

<p>From up the river came three thunderous volleys in quick
succession, followed by a confused noise of shouting and the
reports of muskets and rifles; then the sound of another volley,
more shouts and rattling reports; and as they looked back, the sky
was lighted for a few moments by a red glare. Osmond briefly
explained the nature of his 'little arrangements', while the
alarmed carriers poled along the shallows for dear life.</p>

<p>"But," said Stockbridge, after listening awhile, "what are the
beggars going on firing for? Just hark at them! They're blazing
away like billy-oh!"</p>

<p>"I take it," replied Osmond, "that they have gorged the bait.
Apparently, a party has managed to crawl across the bridge to
attack the bamboo thicket from the front while the other force,
which ferried across the river, attacked from the rear, and that
each party is mistaking the other for us. The trifling error ought
to keep them amused for quite a long time; in fact until we are
beyond reach of pursuit."</p>

<p>Stockbridge chuckled softly. "You are an ingenious beggar,
Cook," he declared with conviction; "and how you managed to keep
your wits about you in that hurly-burly, I can't imagine. However,
I think we are safe enough now." With this comfortable conclusion,
he snuggled down into his hammock and settled himself for a night's
rest.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jim, dear," whispered Betty, "how like you! To think out
your plans calmly with the bullets flying around and everybody else
in a hopeless twitter. It reminds me of the 'phantom mate' on the
dear old <i>Speedwell</i>. By the way, how did you happen to be
there in that miraculously opportune fashion?"</p>

<p>Osmond chuckled. "Well," he exclaimed, "you are a pretty cool
little fish, Betty. You drop down from the clouds and then inquire
how I happened to be there. How did you happen to be there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is quite simple," she replied. "I got Daddy's
permission to take a trip from Accra across the Akwapim Mountains
to Akuse; and when I got there I thought I should like to have a
look at the Country where the bobbery was going on. So I crossed
the river and was starting off gaily towards the Krepi border when
an interfering though well-meaning old chief stopped me and said I
mustn't go any farther because of war-palaver. I wanted to go on,
but my carriers wouldn't budge; so back I came, taking the road for
Quittah, and by good luck dropped into a little war-palaver after
all."</p>

<p>"Why were you going to Quittah?"</p>

<p>"Now, Jim, don't ask silly questions. You know perfectly well.
Of course I was going to run over to Adaffia to call on my friend
Captain J.; and by the same token, I shouldn't have found him
there. Now tell me how you came to be in the bush at this
particular time."</p>

<p>Osmond stated baldly the ostensible purpose of his expedition,
to which Betty listened without comment. She had her suspicions as
to the ultimate motive, but she asked no questions. The less said
on that subject, the better.</p>

<p>This was evidently Osmond's view, for he at once plunged into an
account of the loss of the <i>Speedwell</i> and of Captain Hartup's
testamentary arrangements. Betty was deeply affected, both by the
loss of the ship and the death of the worthy but cross-grained
little skipper.</p>

<p>"How awfully sad!" she exclaimed, almost in tears. "The dear old
ship, where I spent the happiest days of my life! And poor Captain
Hartup! I always liked him, really. He was quite nice to me, in
spite of his gruff manner. I used to feel that he was just a little
human porcupine with india-rubber quills. And now I love him
because, in his perverse little heart, he understood and
appreciated my Captain Jim. May I come, one day, and put a wreath
on his grave?"</p>

<p>"Yes, do, Betty," he replied. "I buried him next to Osmond's new
grave, and I put up an oaken cross which I made out of some of the
planking of the old <i>Speedwell</i>. He was very fond of his ship.
And I have kept a couple of her beams&mdash;thought you might like
to have something made out of one of them."</p>

<p>"How sweet of you, Jim, to think of it!" she exclaimed, nestling
close to him and slipping her hand round his arm, "and to know
exactly what I should like! But we do understand each other, don't
we, Jim, dear?</p>

<p>"I think we do, Betty, darling," he replied, pressing the little
hand that had stolen into his own.</p>

<p>For a long time nothing more was said. After the turmoil and the
alarms of the escape, it was very peaceful to sit in the
gently-swaying canoe and listen to the voices of the night; the
continuous "chirr" of countless cicadas, punctuated by the soft
swish of the canoe-poles as they were drawn forward for another
stroke; the deep-toned, hollow whistle of the great fox-bats,
flapping slowly across the river; the long drawn cry, or staccato
titter, of far-away hyenas, and now and again, the startling shriek
of a potto in one of the lofty trees by the river-bank. It was more
soothing than absolute silence. The sounds seemed so remote and
unreal, so eloquent of utter solitude; of a vast, unseen wilderness
with its mysterious population of bird and beast, living on its
strange, primeval life unchanged from the days when the world was
young.</p>

<p>After a long interval, Betty spoke again. "It seems," she said,
reflectively, "dreadfully callous to be so perfectly happy. I
wonder if it is."</p>

<p>"Why should it be?" her companion asked.</p>

<p>"I mean," she explained, "with poor Mr. Westall lying there
dead, only a few feet away."</p>

<p>Osmond felt inwardly that Westall had not only thrown away his
own life but jeopardized the lives of the others which were in his
custody. But he forbore to express what he felt and answered,
simply: "I don't suppose the poor chap would grudge us our
happiness. It won't last very long."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't it, Jim?" she exclaimed. "Why should we part
again and be miserable for the want of one another? Oh, Jim,
darling, my own mate, won't you try to put away your
scruples&mdash;your needless scruples, though I love and respect
you for having them? But don't let them spoil our lives. Forget
John Osmond. He is dead and buried. Let him rest. I am yours, Jim,
and you know it; and you are mine, and I know it. Those are the
realities, which we could never change if we should live for a
century. Let us accept them and forget what is past and done with.
Life is short enough, dear, and our youth is slipping away. If we
make a false move, we shall never get another chance. Oh, say it,
Jim. Say you will put away the little things that don't matter and
hold fast to the reality of our great love and the happiness that
is within our reach. Won't you, Jim?"</p>

<p>He was silent for a while. This was what he had dreaded. To have
freely offered, yet again, the gift beside which all the treasures
of the earth were to him as nothing; and, even worse, to be made to
feel that he, himself, had something to give which he must yet
withhold; it was an agony. The temptation to yield&mdash;to shut
his eyes to the future and snatch at the golden present&mdash;was
almost irresistible. He knew that Betty was absolutely sincere. He
knew quite well that whatever might befall in the future, she would
hold him blameless and accept all mischances as the consequences of
her own considered choice. His confidence in her generosity was
absolute, nor did he undervalue her judgment. He even admitted that
she was probably right. John Osmond was dead. The pursuit was at an
end and the danger of discovery negligible. In a new country and in
a new character he was sure that he could make her life all that
she hoped. Then why not forget the past and say "yes"?</p>

<p>It was a great temptation. One little word, and they would
possess all that they wished for, all that mattered to either of
them. And yet&mdash;"Betty," he said at length, in a tone of the
deepest gravity, "you have said that we understand one another. We
do; perfectly; absolutely. There is no need for me to tell you that
I love you, or that if there were any sacrifice that I could make
for you, I would make it joyfully and think it an honour and a
privilege. You know that as well as I do. But there is one thing
that I cannot do. Whatever I may be or may have done, I cannot
behave like a cad to the woman I love. And that is what I should do
if I married you. I should accept your sterling gold and give you
base metal in exchange. You would be the wife of an outlaw, you
would live under the continual menace of scandal and disaster. Your
children would be the children of a nameless man and would grow up
to the inheritance of an ancestry that could not be spoken of.</p>

<p>"Those are the realities, Betty. I realize, and I reverence,
your great and noble love for me, unworthy as I am. But I should be
a selfish brute if I accepted what you offer to me with such
incredible generosity. I can't do it, Betty. It was a disaster that
you ever met me, but that we cannot help. We can only limit its
effects."</p>

<p>She listened silently while he pronounced the doom of her
newly-born hopes, holding his hand tightly grasped in hers and
scarcely seeming to breathe. She did not reply immediately when he
ceased speaking, but sat a while, her head resting against his
shoulder and her hand still clasped in his. Once she smothered a
little sob and furtively wiped her eyes. But she was very quiet,
and, at length, in a composed, steady voice, though sadly enough,
she rejoined: "Very well, Jim, dear. It must be as you think best,
and I won't tease you with any more appeals. At any rate, we can go
on loving each other, and that will be something. The gift of real
love doesn't come to everyone."</p>

<p>For a long time they sat without further speech, thinking each
their own thoughts. To Betty the position was a little puzzling.
She understood Osmond's point of view and respected it, for she
knew that the sacrifice was as great to him as to her. And though,
woman-like, she felt their mutual devotion to be a full answer to
all his objections, yet&mdash;again, woman-like&mdash;she approved,
though reluctantly, of his rigid adherence to a masculine standard
of conduct.</p>

<p>But here came another puzzle. What was it that he had done? What
could it possibly be that a man like this should have done? He had
said plainly&mdash;and she knew that it was true&mdash;that there
had been a warrant for his arrest. He had been, and in a sense
still was, a fugitive from justice. Yet his standard of honour was
of the most scrupulous delicacy. It had compelled him quite
unnecessarily to disclose his identity. It compelled him now to put
away what she knew was his dearest wish. Nothing could be more
unlike a criminal; who, surely, is above all things self-indulgent.
Yet he was an offender against the law. Now, what, in the name of
Heaven, is the kind of offence against the law of which a man of
this type could be guilty? He had never given a hint upon the
subject, and of course she had never sought to find out. She was
not in the least inquisitive now. But the incongruity, the
discrepancy between his character and his circumstances, perplexed
her profoundly.</p>

<p>Finally, she gave up the puzzle and began to talk to him about
Captain Hartup and the pleasant old times on board the
<i>Speedwell</i>. He responded with evident relief at having passed
the dreaded crisis; and so, by degrees, they got back to cheerful
talk and frank enjoyment of one another's society, letting the
past, the future, and the might-have-been sink into temporary
oblivion.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE ORDER OF
RELEASE</h2>

<p class="first">IT was a long journey down the winding river and
across the great lagoon. How long Osmond never knew; for, as hour
after hour passed and the canoe sped on noiselessly through the
encompassing darkness, the fatigues of the day began to take
effect, not only on him, but on his companion too. Gradually the
conversation slackened, the intervals of silence grew longer and
longer, merging into periods of restful unconsciousness and
punctuated by little smothered yawns on the part of Betty; until,
at length, silence fell upon the canoe, unbroken save by the sounds
of sleeping men and the rhythmical 'swish' of the poles.</p>

<p>At the sound of a distant bugle Osmond opened his eyes and
became aware that the day was breaking and that the journey was
nearly at an end. Also that his head was very comfortably pillowed
on the shoulder of his companion, who now slumbered peacefully at
his side. Very softly he raised himself and looked down at the
sleeping girl, almost holding his breath lest he should disturb
her. How dainty and frail she looked, this brave, hardy little
maid! How delicate, almost childlike, she seemed as she lay,
breathing softly, in the easy posture of graceful youth! And how
lovely she was! He gazed adoringly at the sweet face, so charmingly
wreathed with its golden aureole, at the peacefully-closed eyes
with their fringes of long, dark lashes, and thought half-bitterly,
half-proudly, that she was his own for the asking; and even as he
looked, she opened her eyes and greeted him with a smile.</p>

<p>"What are you looking so solemn about, Jim?" she asked, as she
sat up and reached for her helmet.</p>

<p>"Was I looking solemn? I expect it was only foolishness. Most
fools are solemn animals."</p>

<p>"Don't be a guffin, Jim," she commanded, reprovingly.</p>

<p>"What is a guffin?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is a thing with a big, Roman nose and most abnormal amount
of obstinacy, which makes disparaging comments on my Captain
Jim."</p>

<p>"A horrid sort of beast it must be. Well, I won't, then. Is that
Quittah, where all those canoes are?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it is, but I've never been there. Yes, it must be. I
can see Fort Firminger&mdash;that thing like a Martello tower out
in the lagoon opposite the landing-place. Mr. Cockeram says it is
an awfully strong fort. You couldn't knock it down with a croquet
mallet."</p>

<p>Osmond looked about him with the interest of a traveller
arriving at a place which he has heard of but never seen. Behind
and on both sides, the waste of water extended as far as the eye
could see. Before them was a line of low land with occasional
clumps of coconut palms that marked the position of beach villages.
Ahead was a larger mass of palms, before which was a wide 'hard' or
landing-place, already thronged with market people, towards which
numbers of trading canoes were converging from all parts of the
lagoon.</p>

<p>As they drew nearer, an opening in the palms revealed a
whitewashed fort above which a flag was just being hoisted; and
now, over the sandy shore, the masts of two vessels came into
view.</p>

<p>"There is the Widgeon," said Betty, pointing to the masts of a
barquentine, "and there is another vessel, a schooner. I wonder who
she is."</p>

<p>Osmond had observed and was also wondering who she was; for he
had a suspicion that he had seen her before. Something in the
appearance of the tall, slim masts seemed to recall the mysterious
yacht-like craft that he had seen one night at Adaffia revealed for
a moment in 'the glimpses of the moon'.</p>

<p>They were now rapidly approaching the landing-place. The other
canoe had already arrived, and its disembarked crew could be seen
on the hard surrounded by a crowd of natives.</p>

<p>"That looks like a naval officer waiting on the beach," said
Osmond, looking at a white-clad figure which had separated itself
from the crowd and appeared to be awaiting their arrival.</p>

<p>"It is," replied Betty. "I believe it is Captain Darley. And
there is a constabulary officer coming down, too. I expect they
have heard the news. You'll get a great reception when they hear
Mr. Stockbridge's story&mdash;and mine. But they will be awfully
upset about poor Mr. Westall. You are coming up to the fort with
me, of course?"</p>

<p>Osmond had intended to go straight on to Adaffia, but he now saw
that this would be impossible. Besides, there was the schooner.
"Yes," he replied, "I will see you to your destination."</p>

<p>"It isn't my destination," said she. "I shall rest here for a
day&mdash;the German deaconesses will give me a bed, I
expect&mdash;and then I am coming on with you to Adaffia to put a
wreath on Captain Hartup's grave. You can put up either at the fort
or with one of the German traders or missionaries. There are no
English people here excepting the two officers at the fort."</p>

<p>Osmond made no comment on this, for they were now close inshore.
The canoe slid into the shallows and in a few moments more was
hauled up by a crowd of willing natives until her bows were high
and dry on the hard.</p>

<p>The officer who had joined Darley turned out to be the doctor,
under whose superintendence Stockbridge's hammock was carefully
landed and the rest of the wounded brought ashore. Then the litter
containing the body of the dead officer was lifted out and slowly
borne away, while Darley and the native soldiers stood at the
salute, and the doctor, having mustered the wounded, led the way
towards the little hospital. As the melancholy procession moved
off, Darley turned to greet Betty and Osmond, who had stepped
ashore last.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Miss Burleigh? None the worse for your
adventures, I hope. Been having rather a strenuous time, haven't
you?"</p>

<p>"We have rather," she replied. "Isn't it a dreadful thing to
have lost poor Mr. Westall?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, as they turned away from the lagoon and began
to walk towards the fort. "Shocking affair. Still, fortune of war,
you know. Can't make omelettes without breaking eggs. And here is
Mr. Cook, in the thick of the bobbery, as usual. What a fellow you
are, Cook! Always in hot water."</p>

<p>As he shook Osmond's hand heartily, the latter replied: "Well,
the bobbery wasn't of my making, this time. I found it ready made
and just bore a hand. By the way, what schooner is that out in the
roads?"</p>

<p>"That," replied Darley, "is an ancient yacht named the
Primula&mdash;a lovely old craft&mdash;sails like a witch. But she
has come down in the world now. We met her coming up from the
leeward coast and brought her in here."</p>

<p>"Brought her in? Is she in custody, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, we brought her in to overhaul her and make some
inquiries. There is just a suspicion that she has been concerned in
the gun-running that has been going on. But we haven't found
anything up to the present. She seems to be full up with ordinary,
legitimate cargo."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Osmond.</p>

<p>"Why 'ha'?" demanded Darley with a quick look at Osmond. "Do you
know anything about her?"</p>

<p>"Let us hear some more," said Osmond. "Is there a Welshman named
Jones on board?"</p>

<p>"There is. He's the skipper, purser, and super cargo all
combined."</p>

<p>"Have you looked through her manifest?"</p>

<p>"I have; and I've jotted down some notes of the items of her
lading."</p>

<p>"Is there any ivory on board?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Darley, with growing excitement.</p>

<p>"Three large crates and a big canvas bag?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"Containing in all, thirty-nine large tusks and fifty-one
scribellos?"</p>

<p>Darley dragged a pocket-book out of his pocket and feverishly
turned over the leaves. "Yes, by Jove!" he fairly shouted. "The
very numbers. Now, what have you got to tell us?"</p>

<p>"I think you can take it that the ivory and probably the rest of
the lading, too, is stolen property."</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed Betty, "that must be your ivory, Jim."</p>

<p>Darley flashed an astonished glance at her and then looked
inquiringly at Osmond. "Is that so?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that it is," the latter replied. "But if it
should happen that there is a man on board named Sam
Winter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is," interrupted Darley.</p>

<p>"And another named Simmons and others named Foat, Bradley, and
Darker, I think, if you introduce me to them, that we shall get the
whole story. And as to the gun-running, I can't make a voluntary
statement, but if you were to put me in the witness-box, I should
have to tell you all that I know; and I may say that I know a good
deal. Will that do, for the present?"</p>

<p>Darley smiled complacently. "It seems like a pretty straight
tip," said he. "I will just skip on board, now, and take possession
of the manifest; and if you will give me that list of names again,
I will see if those men are on board, and bring them ashore, if
they are. You will be staying at the fort, I suppose? There are
only Cockeram and the doctor there."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Betty, "I shall ask Mr. Cockeram to put him up, for
to-night, at any rate."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Darley, "then I shall see you again later. And
now I will be off and lay the train."</p>

<p>He touched his cap, and as they emerged into an open space
before the gateway of the fort, he turned and walked away briskly
down a long, shady avenue of wild fig-trees that led towards the
shore.</p>

<p>Quittah fort was a shabby-looking, antique structure adapted to
the conditions of primitive warfare. It was entered by an arched
gateway graced by two ancient cannon set up as posts and guarded by
a Hausa sentry in a blue serge uniform and a scarlet fez. Towards
the gateway Osmond and Betty directed their steps, and as they
approached, the sentry sprang smartly to attention and presented
arms; whereupon Betty marched in with impressive dignity and two
tiny fingers raised to the peak of her helmet.</p>

<p>"This seems to be the way up," she said, turning towards a
mouldering wooden staircase, as a supercilious-looking pelican
waddled towards them and a fish-eagle on a perch in a corner
uttered a loud yell. "What a queer place it is! It looks like a
menagerie. I wonder if there is anyone at home."</p>

<p>She tripped up the stairs, followed by Osmond and watched
suspiciously by an assemblage of storks, coots, rails, and other
birds which were strolling about at large in the quadrangle, and
came out on an open space at the top of a corner bastion. Just as
they reached this spot a man came hurrying out of a shabby building
which occupied one side of the square; and at the first glance
Osmond recognized him as the officer who had come to Adaffia to
execute the warrant on the day when he had buried poor Larkom. The
recognition was mutual, for as soon as he had saluted Betty, the
officer turned to him and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Larkom, by Jove!" said he.</p>

<p>"My name is Cook," Osmond corrected.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the other; "glad you set me right, because I have
been going to send you a note. You remember me&mdash;Cockeram. I
came down to Adaffia, you know, about that poor chap, Osmond."</p>

<p>"I remember. You said you had been going to write to me."</p>

<p>"Yes. I was going to send you something that I thought would
interest you. I may as well give it to you now." He began to
rummage in his pockets and eventually brought forth a bulging
letter-case, the very miscellaneous contents of which he proceeded
to sort out. "It's about poor Osmond," he continued, disjointedly,
and still turning over a litter of papers. "I felt that you would
like to see it. Poor chap! It was such awfully rough luck."</p>

<p>"What was?" asked Osmond.</p>

<p>"Why, you remember," replied Cockeram, suspending his search to
look up, "that I had a warrant to arrest him. It seemed that he was
wanted for some sort of jewel robbery and there had been a regular
hue-and-cry after him. Then he managed to slip away to sea and had
just contrived to get into hiding at Adaffia when the fever got
him. Frightful hard lines!"</p>

<p>"Why hard lines?" demanded Osmond.</p>

<p>"Why? Because he was innocent."</p>

<p>"Innocent!" exclaimed Osmond, staring at the officer in
amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, innocent. Had nothing whatever to do with the robbery. No
one can make out why on earth he scooted."</p>

<p>As Cockeram made his astounding statement, Betty turned deathly
pale. "Is it quite certain that he was innocent?" she asked in a
low, eager tone.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," he replied, turning an astonished blue eye on the
white-faced girl and then hastily averting it. "Where is that
confounded paper&mdash;newspaper cutting? I cut it out to send to
Lark&mdash;Cook. There is no doubt whatever. It seems that they
employed a criminal lawyer chap&mdash;a certain Dr.
Thorndyke&mdash;to work up the case against Osmond. So this lawyer
fellow got to work. And the upshot of it was that he proved
conclusively that Osmond couldn't possibly be the guilty
party."</p>

<p>"How did he prove that?" Osmond demanded.</p>

<p>"In the simplest and most satisfactory way possible," replied
Cockeram. "He followed up the tracks until he had spotted the
actual robber and held all the clues in his hand. Then he gave the
police the tip; and they swooped down on my nabs&mdash;caught him
fairly on the hop with all the stolen property in his possession.
There isn't the shadow of a doubt about it."</p>

<p>"What was the name of the man who stole the gems?" Osmond asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>"I don't remember," Cockeram replied. "What interested me was
the name of the man who didn't steal them."</p>

<p>Betty, still white-faced and trembling, stood gazing rather
wildly at Osmond. For his face bore a very singular
expression&mdash;an expression that made her feel sick at heart. He
did not look relieved or joyful. Surprised he certainly was. But it
was not joyous surprise. Rather was it suggestive of alarm and
dismay. And meanwhile Cockeram continued to turn over the
accumulations in his letter-case. Suddenly he drew forth a crumpled
and much-worn envelope from which he triumphantly extracted a long
newspaper cutting.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, as he handed it to Osmond, "here we are. You
will find full particulars in this. You needn't send it back to me.
I have done with it. And now I must hook off to the court-house.
You will take possession of the mess-room, Miss Burleigh, won't
you? and order whatever you want. Of course, Mr. Cook is my guest."
With a formal salute he turned, ran down the rickety stairs and out
at the gate, pursued closely as far as the wicket by the
pelican.</p>

<p>But Betty's whole attention was focussed on Osmond; and as he
fastened hungrily on the newspaper cutting, she took his arm and
drew him gently through a ramshackle lattice porch into the shabby
little white washed mess-room, where she stood watching with
mingled hope and terror the strange, enigmatical expression on his
face as he devoured the printed lines.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;in the twinkling of an eye&mdash;That expression
changed. Anxiety, even consternation, gave place to the wildest
astonishment; his jaw fell, and the hand which held the newspaper
cutting dropped to his side. And then he laughed aloud; a weird,
sardonic laugh that made poor Betty's flesh creep.</p>

<p>"What is it, Jim, dear?" she asked nervously.</p>

<p>He looked in her face and laughed again.</p>

<p>"My name," said he, "is not Jim. It is John. John Osmond."</p>

<p>"Very well, John," she replied, meekly. "But why did you
laugh?"</p>

<p>He placed his hands on her shoulders and looked down at her with
a smile.</p>

<p>"Betty, darling," said he, "do I understand that you are willing
to marry me?"</p>

<p>"Willing indeed!" she exclaimed. "I am going to marry you."</p>

<p>"Then, my darling," said he, "you are going to marry a
fool."</p>

<h2>BOOK II. &mdash; THE INVESTIGATOR</h2>

<h2><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE INDICTMENT</h2>

<p class="first">MR. JOSEPH PENFIELD sat behind his writing-table
in a posture of calm attention, allowing his keen grey eyes to
travel back and forth from the silver snuff box which lay on the
note-pad before him to the two visitors who confronted him from
their respective chairs. One of these, an elderly hard-faced man,
square of jaw and truculent of eye, was delivering some sort of
statement, while the other, a considerably younger man, listened
critically, with his eyes cast down, but stealing, from time to
time, a quick, furtive glance either at the speaker or at Mr.
Penfield. He was evidently following the statement closely; and to
an observer there might have appeared in his concentrated attention
something more than mere interest; something inscrutable, with,
perhaps, the faintest suggestion of irony.</p>

<p>As the speaker came, somewhat abruptly, to an end, Mr. Penfield
opened his snuff-box and took a pinch delicately between finger and
thumb.</p>

<p>"It is not quite clear to me, Mr. Woodstock," said he, "why you
are consulting me in this matter. You are an experienced
practitioner, and the issue is a fairly simple one. What is there
against your dealing with the case according to your own
judgment?"</p>

<p>"A good deal," Mr. Woodstock replied. "In the first place, I am
one of the interested parties&mdash;the principal one, in fact. In
the second, I practise in a country town, whereas you are here in
the very heart of the legal world; and in the third, I have no
experience whatever of criminal practice; I am a conveyancer pure
and simple."</p>

<p>"But," objected Mr. Penfield, "this is not a matter of criminal
practice. It is just a question of your liability as a bailee."</p>

<p>"Yes, true. But that question is closely connected with the
robbery. Since no charge was made for depositing this property in
my strong-room, obviously, I am not liable unless it can be shown
that the loss was due to negligence. But the question of negligence
turns on the robbery."</p>

<p>"Which I understand was committed by one of your own staff?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the man Osmond, whom I mentioned; one of my confidential
clerks&mdash;Hepburn, here, is the other&mdash;who had access to
the strong-room and who absconded as soon as the robbery was
discovered."</p>

<p>"When you say he had access," said Mr. Penfield, "you
mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That he had access to the key during office hours. As a matter
of fact, it hangs on the wall beside my desk, and when I am there
the strong-room is usually kept open&mdash;the door is in my
private office and opposite to my desk. Of course, when I leave at
the end of the day, I lock up the strong-room and take the key away
with me."</p>

<p>"Yes. But in the interval&mdash;hm? It almost looks as if a
claim might be&mdash;hm? But you have given me only an outline of
the affair. Perhaps a more detailed account might enable us better
to form an opinion on the position. Would it be troubling you too
much?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Mr. Woodstock; "but it is rather a long
story. However, I will cut it as short as I can. We will take the
events in the order in which they occurred; and you must pull me
up, Hepburn, if I overlook anything.</p>

<p>"The missing valuables are the property of a client of mine
named Hollis; a retired soap manufacturer, as rich as Croesus, and
like most of these over-rich men, having made a fortune was at his
wit's end what to do with it. Eventually, he adopted the usual
plan. He became a collector. And having decided to burden himself
with a lot of things that he didn't want, he put the lid on it by
specializing in goldsmith's work, jewellery and precious stones.
Wanted a valuable collection, he said, that could be kept in an
ordinary dwelling-house.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, the acquisitive mania, once started, grew by
what it fed on. The desire to possess this stuff became an
obsession. He was constantly planning expeditions in search of new
rarities, scouring the Continent for fresh loot, flitting from town
to town and from dealer to dealer like an idiotic bee. And whenever
he went off on one of these expeditions he would bring the pick of
his confounded collection to me to have it deposited in my
strong-room. I urged him to take it to the bank; but he doesn't
keep an account with any of the local branches and didn't want to
take the stuff to London. Moreover, he had inspected my strong-room
and was a good deal impressed by it."</p>

<p>"It is really strong, is it?" asked Mr. Penfield.</p>

<p>"Very. Thick reinforced concrete lined with steel. Very large,
too. Not that the strength is material as it was not broken into.
Well, eventually I agreed to deposit the things in the
strong-room&mdash;couldn't refuse an important client&mdash;but I
resolutely declined to make any charge or accept any sort of
consideration for the service. I wasn't going to make myself
responsible for the safety of things of that value. And I explained
my position to Hollis; but he said that a strong-room that was good
enough for my valuable documents was good enough for his jewels.
Which was talking like a fool. Burglars don't break into safes to
steal leases.</p>

<p>"Well, this business began about six years ago, and&mdash;so far
as I can tell&mdash;nothing amiss occurred until quite lately. I
say so far as I can tell, for of course we can't date the robbery.
We only know when it was discovered. But I assume that the theft
was committed pretty recently or it would surely have been
discovered sooner."</p>

<p>"And when was it first ascertained that a robbery had been
committed?" asked Mr. Penfield, dipping a quill into the ink.</p>

<p>"On the fourth of October," replied Mr. Woodstock; and having
paused while Mr. Penfield noted the date, he continued: "On that
day Hollis took a great ruby up to South Kensington, where it had
been accepted for a loan exhibition. He delivered it himself to the
keeper of the precious stones, and was a little taken aback when
that gentleman, after a preliminary inspection, began to pore over
it with a magnifying-glass and then sent for one of his colleagues.
The second expert raised his eyebrows when he had looked at the
gem, and he, too, made a careful scrutiny with the lens. Finally,
they sent for a third official; and the upshot of it was that the
three experts agreed that the stone was not a ruby at all but only
a first-class imitation.</p>

<p>"Of course Hollis didn't believe them, and said so. He had
bought the stone for four thousand pounds from a well-known dealer
and had shown it to a number of connoisseurs, who had all been
enthusiastic about the colour and lustre of the gem. There had
never been any question that it was not merely a genuine ruby, but
a ruby of the highest class. However, when e had heard the verdict
of the experts, he pocketed his treasure and went straight off to
Cawley's in Piccadlilly. But when Mr. Cawley shook his head over
the gem and pronounced it an unquestionable counterfeit, he became
alarmed and danced off in a deuce of a twitter to the dealer from
whom he had bought it.</p>

<p>"That interview settled the matter. The dealer remembered the
transaction quite well and knew all about the stone, for he had
full records of the circumstances under which he had acquired it.
Moreover, he recognized the setting&mdash;a pendant with a surround
of small diamonds&mdash;but he was quite clear that the stone in it
was not the stone that he had sold to Hollis. In fact it was not a
stone at all; it was just a good-class paste ruby. The original had
been picked out of the setting and the counterfeit put in its
place; and the person who had done the job was apparently not a
skilled jeweller, for there were traces on the setting of some
rather amateurish work."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt, I suppose," said Mr. Penfield, "of the
bona-fides of the dealer?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest," was the reply. "He is a man of the highest
reputation; and as a matter of fact, no regular dealer would palm
off a counterfeit. It wouldn't be business. But the question
doesn't really arise, as you will see when I proceed with the
story.</p>

<p>"As soon as Hollis was convinced that a substitution had been
effected, he commissioned an independent expert to come down and
make a critical survey of his collection; and it was then
ascertained that practically every important gem in his cabinets
was a counterfeit. And in every case in which the stone was a false
one, the same traces of clumsy workmanship were discoverable by an
expert eye.</p>

<p>"The conclusion was obvious. Since the original gems had come
from all sorts of different sources, there could he no question of
fraud on the part of the various vendors; to say nothing of the
fact that Hollis&mdash;who has practically no knowledge of stones
himself&mdash;always obtained an expert opinion before concluding a
deal. It was obvious that a systematic robbery had been carried
out, and the question that arose was, who could the robber be?</p>

<p>"But that question involved certain others; as, for instance,
when had the robbery been committed? where were the jewels at that
time? and who had access to the place in which they were?</p>

<p>"These were difficult questions. At first it seemed as if they
were unanswerable, and perhaps some of them would have been if the
robber had not lost his nerve. But I am anticipating. Let us take
the questions in their order.</p>

<p>"First as to the date of the robbery. It happens that a little
less than two years ago Professor Eccles came down by invitation
and made a careful inspection of Hollis's collection with a view to
a proposed bequest to the nation, and marked off what he considered
to be the most valuable specimens. Now, I need not say that if
Professor Eccles detected no counterfeit stones, we may take it
that no counterfeits were there. Consequently, the collection was
then intact and the robbery must have been committed since that
date. But it happens that that date coincides almost exactly with
the arrival of Osmond at my office. Just two years ago Hepburn
introduced him to me; and as he is Hepburn's brother-in-law, I
accepted him with perfect confidence.</p>

<p>"The other questions seemed more difficult. As to Hollis's own
premises, the jewel-room had a Chubb detector lock on its only
door, the cabinets have similar locks, the windows are always kept
securely fastened, and no attempt has ever been made to break into
the place. Besides, burglars would simply have taken the jewels
away. They would not have left substitutes. The personnel of his
household&mdash;a lady secretary, a housekeeper, and two
maids&mdash;appear beyond suspicion. Moreover, they had all been
with him many years before the robbery occurred. In short, I think
we may consider Hollis's premises as outside the field of
inquiry."</p>

<p>"Do you really?" said Mr. Penfield, in a tone which clearly
indicated that he did not.</p>

<p>"Certainly; and so will you when you have heard the rest of the
story. We now come to the various occasions on which the more
valuable parts of this collection were deposited in my strong-room.
Let me describe the procedure. In the first place, Hollis himself
packed the jewels in a number of wooden boxes which he had had made
specially for the purpose, each about fourteen inches by nine by
about five inches deep. Every box had a good lock with a sunk disc
on each side of the keyhole for the seals. When the boxes were
packed they were locked and a strip of tape put across the keyhole
and secured at each end with a seal. They were then wrapped in
strong paper and sealed at all the joints with Hollis's
seal&mdash;an antique Greek seal set in a ring which he always
wears on his finger. On the outside of the cover was written a list
of the contents in Hollis's own handwriting and signed by him, and
each box bore in addition a number. The boxes were brought to my
office by Hollis and by him delivered personally to me; and I gave
him a receipt, roughly describing and enumerating the boxes, but,
of course, not committing myself in respect of the contents. I then
carried them myself into the strong-room and placed them on an
upper shelf which I reserved for them; and there they remained
until Hollis fetched them away, when he used to give me a receipt
in the same terms as my own. That concluded the particular
transaction.</p>

<p>"Now, it happened that at the time when the robbery was
discovered, several of the boxes which Hollis had taken back from
me about a month previously still remained packed and in their
paper wrappings. And it further happened that one of
these&mdash;there were eight in all&mdash;contained an emerald
which Hollis had bought only a few days before he packed it. There
was no question as to the genuineness of this stone; and when the
box was opened, there was no question as to the fact that it had
been replaced by a counterfeit. Even Hollis was able to spot the
change. So that seemed to fix the date of the robbery to the period
during which the box had been in my strong-room."</p>

<p>"Apparently," Mr. Penfield agreed. "But you speak of the box as
being still in its paper wrapping. What of the seals?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Woodstock, "that is the most mysterious feature
of the affair. The seals were unbroken and, so far as Hollis could
see, the package was absolutely intact, just as it had been handed
to me."</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield pursed up his lips and took snuff to the verge of
intemperance.</p>

<p>"If the seals were unbroken," said he, "and the package was in
all other respects intact, that would seem to be incontestable
proof that it had never been opened since it was closed and
sealed."</p>

<p>"That was what I pointed out," interposed Hepburn, "when Mr.
Woodstock talked the matter over with Osmond and me. The unbroken
seals seemed a conclusive answer to any suggestion that the robbery
took place in our office."</p>

<p>"So they did," Woodstock agreed, "and so they would still if
Osmond had kept his head. But he didn't. He had evidently reckoned
on the question of a robbery from our strong-room never being
raised, and I imagine that it was that emerald that upset his
nerve. At any rate, within a week of our discussion he bolted, and
then, of course, the murder was out."</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield nodded gravely and asked, after a short pause: "And
how is Mr. Hollis taking it? Is he putting any pressure on
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all&mdash;up to the present. He has not suggested
any claim against me; he merely wants to lay his hand on the robber
and, if possible, get his jewels back. He entirely approves of what
I have done."</p>

<p>"What have you done?" Mr. Penfield asked.</p>

<p>"I have done the obvious thing," was the reply, delivered in a
slightly truculent tone. "As soon as it was clear that Osmond had
absconded, I communicated with the police. I laid an information
and gave them the leading facts."</p>

<p>"And do they propose to take any action?"</p>

<p>"Most undoubtedly; in fact I may say that they have been most
commendably prompt. They have already traced Osmond to Bristol, and
I have every hope that in due course they will run him to earth and
arrest him."</p>

<p>"That is quite probable," said Mr. Penfield. "And when they have
arrested him&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"He will be brought back and charged before a magistrate, when
we may take it that he will be committed for trial."</p>

<p>"It is possible," Mr. Penfield assented, doubtfully. "And
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then," replied Woodstock, reddening and raising his voice, "he
will be put on his trial and, I make no doubt, sent to penal
servitude."</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield took snuff deprecatingly and shook his head. "I
think not," said he; "but perhaps there is some item of evidence
which you have omitted to mention?"</p>

<p>"Evidence!" Woodstock repeated impatiently. "What evidence do
you want? The property has been stolen and the man who had an
opportunity to steal it has absconded. What more do you want?"</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield looked at his brother solicitor with mild
surprise.</p>

<p>"The judge," he replied, "and I should think the magistrate,
too, would want some positive evidence that the accused stole the
jewels. There appears to be no such evidence. The unexplained
disappearance of this man is a suspicious circumstance; but it is
useless to take suspicions into court. You have got to make out a
case, and at present you have no case. If the charge were not
dismissed by the magistrate, the bill would certainly be thrown out
by the Grand Jury."</p>

<p>Mr. Woodstock glowered sullenly at the old lawyer, but he made
no reply, while Hepburn sat with down cast eyes and the faintest
trace of an ironical smile.</p>

<p>"Consider," Mr. Penfield resumed, "what would be the inevitable
answer of the defence. They would point out that there is not a
particle of evidence that the robbery&mdash;if there has really
been a robbery&mdash;occurred in your office at all, and that there
are excellent reasons for believing that it did not."</p>

<p>"What reasons are there?"</p>

<p>"There are the unbroken seals. Until you can show how the jewels
could have been abstracted without breaking the seals, you have not
even a prima-facie case. Then there is the method of the alleged
robbery. It would have required not merely access but undisturbed
possession for a considerable time. It was not just a matter of
picking out the stones. They were replaced by plausible
counterfeits which had to be made or procured. Take the case of the
ruby that you mentioned. It deceived Hollis completely. Then it
must have been very like the original in size, form, and colour. It
could not have been picked up casually at a theatrical property
dealer's; it must have been made ad hoc by careful comparison with
the original. But all this and the subsequent setting and finishing
would take time. It would be quite possible while the jewels were
lying quietly in Hollis's cabinets, but it would seem utterly
impossible under the alleged circumstances. In short," Mr. Penfield
concluded, "I am astounded that you ever admitted the possibility
of the robbery having occurred on your premises. What do you say,
Mr. Hepburn?"</p>

<p>"I agree with you entirely," the latter replied. "My position
would have been that we had received certain sealed packages and
that we had handed them back in the same condition as we received
them. I should have left Hollis to prove the contrary."</p>

<p>"And I think he could have done it," said Woodstock doggedly.
"You seem to be forgetting that emerald. But in any case I have
accepted the suggestion and I am not going to draw back, especially
as my confidential clerk has absconded and virtually admitted the
theft. The question is, what is to be done? Hollis is mad to get
hold of the robber and recover his gems, and he is prepared to
stand the racket financially."</p>

<p>"In that case," said Mr. Penfield, taking a final pinch and
pocketing his snuff-box, "I will venture to make a suggestion. This
case is out of your depth and out of mine. I suggest that you allow
me to take counsel's opinion; and the counsel I should select would
be Dr. John Thorndyke."</p>

<p>"Thorndyke&mdash;hm!" grunted Woodstock. "Isn't he an irregular
practitioner of some sort?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," Mr. Penfield dissented warmly. "He is a scientific
expert with an unrivalled knowledge and experience of criminal
practice. If it is possible for anyone to unravel this tangle, I am
confident that he is the man; and I know of no other."</p>

<p>"Then," exclaimed Woodstock, "for God's sake get hold of him,
and let me know what he says, so that I can report to Hollis. And
let him know that there will be no trouble about costs."</p>

<p>With this Mr. Woodstock rose and, after an unemotional
leave-taking, made his way out of the office, followed by
Hepburn.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THORNDYKE TAKES UP
THE INQUIRY</h2>

<p class="first">MR. PENFIELD'S visit to Dr. Thorndyke's chambers
in King's Bench Walk, Inner Temple, was productive of some little
surprise, as such visits were rather apt to be. For the old
solicitor had definitely made up his mind that Woodstock's theory
of the robbery was untenable and that the burden of proof ought to
be cast on Hollis; and he was therefore not a little disconcerted
to find Thorndyke tending to favour the view that the probabilities
pointed to the strong-room as the scene of the robbery.</p>

<p>"After all," the latter said, "we must not ignore the obvious.
It is undeniable that Osmond's disappearance&mdash;which has the
strongest suggestion of flight&mdash;is a very suspicious
circumstance. It occurred almost immediately after the discovery of
the thefts and the suggestion that the gems had been stolen from
the strong-room. Osmond had access to the strong-room&mdash;though
I admit that a good many other persons had, too. Then there is the
striking fact that the period of the robberies coincides exactly
with the period of Osmond's presence at the office. During the four
years which preceded his arrival no robbery appears to have
occurred, although all the other conditions seem to have been the
same. So far as we can see, the robberies must have commenced very
shortly after his arrival. These are significant facts which, as I
have said, we cannot ignore."</p>

<p>"I am entirely with you," Mr. Penfield replied, "when you say
that we must not ignore the obvious. But are you not doing so?
These packages were most carefully and elaborately sealed; and it
is admitted that they were returned to the owner with the seals
unbroken. Now, it seems to me obvious that if the seals were
unbroken, the packages could not have been opened. But apparently
you think otherwise. Possibly you attach less importance to seals
than I do?"</p>

<p>"Probably," Thorndyke admitted. "It is easy to exaggerate their
significance. For what is a seal, when all is said? It is an
artificial thing which some artist or workman has made and which
another artist or workman could copy if necessary. There is no
magic in seals."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" Mr. Penfield exclaimed with a wry smile. "Another
illusion shattered! But I think a Court of Law would share my
erroneous view of the matter. However, we will let that pass. I
understand that you look upon Osmond as the probable
delinquent?"</p>

<p>"The balance of probabilities is in favour of that view. But I
am keeping an open mind. There are other possibilities, and they
will have to be explored. We must take nothing for granted."</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield nodded approvingly. "And suppose," he asked, "the
police should arrest Osmond?"</p>

<p>"Then," replied Thorndyke, "Mr. Woodstock would be in
difficulties, and so would the police&mdash;who have shown less
than their usual discretion&mdash;unless the prisoner should get in
a panic and plead 'guilty.' There is not even a prima-facie case.
They can't call upon Osmond to prove that he did not steal the
gems."</p>

<p>"Exactly," Mr. Penfield agreed. "That is what I tried to impress
on Woodstock&mdash;who is really a most extraordinarily unlegal
lawyer. But have you any suggestion to offer?"</p>

<p>"I can only suggest that, as we are practically without data, we
should endeavour to obtain some. The only fact that we have is that
the stones have been removed from their settings and replaced by
imitations. There seems to be no doubt about that. As to how they
came to be removed, there are evidently four possibilities. First,
they may have been taken from Hollis's cabinets by some person
unknown. Second, the substitution may have been effected by Hollis
himself, for reasons unknown to us and by no means easy to imagine.
Third, they may have been stolen from the strong-room by some
person other than Osmond. Fourth, they may have been stolen from
the strong-room by Osmond. The last is, I think, the most probable.
But all of the four hypotheses must be impartially considered. Do I
understand that Hollis is prepared to offer facilities?"</p>

<p>"He agrees to give every assistance, financial or other."</p>

<p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "I suggest that we make a beginning by
inspecting the boxes. I understand that there are still some
unopened."</p>

<p>"Yes; six. Hollis reserved them to be opened in the presence of
witnesses."</p>

<p>"Let Hollis bring those six boxes together with those that have
been opened, with their packings and wrappings, if he has them. If
we can fix a day, I will arrange for an expert to be present to
witness the opening of the six boxes and give an opinion on the
stones in them. If it appears that any robbery has been committed,
I shall ask Hollis to leave the boxes and the counterfeit jewels
that I may examine them at my leisure."</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield chuckled softly and helped himself to a pinch of
snuff.</p>

<p>"Your methods, Dr. Thorndyke," said be, "are a perennial source
of wonder to me. May I ask what kind of information you expect to
extract from the empty boxes?"</p>

<p>"I have no specific expectations at all," was the reply; "but it
will be strange indeed if we learn nothing from them. They will
probably have little enough to tell us; but, seeing that we have,
at present, hardly a single fact beyond that of the
substitution&mdash;and that is not of our own observing&mdash;a
very small addition to our knowledge would be all to the good."</p>

<p>"Very true, very true," agreed Mr. Penfield. "A single definite
fact might enable us to decide which of those four possibilities is
to be adopted and pursued; though how you propose to extract such a
fact from an empty box, or even a full one, I am unable to imagine.
However, I leave that problem in your hands. As soon as you have
secured your expert, perhaps you will kindly advise me and I will
then make the necessary arrangements with Mr. Hollis."</p>

<p>With this Mr. Penfield rose and took his departure, leaving
Thorndyke to read over and amplify the notes that he had taken
during the consultation.</p>

<p>As matters turned out, he was able to advise Mr. Penfield within
twenty-four hours that he had secured the services of an expert who
was probably the greatest living authority on gem stones; with the
result that a telegram arrived from Mr. Hollis accepting the
appointment for the following day at eleven in the forenoon, that
time having been mentioned by the expert as the most suitable on
account of the light.</p>

<p>It wanted several minutes to the appointed hour when the first
visitor arrived; for the Treasury clock had hardly struck the third
quarter when, in response to a smart rat-tat on the little brass
knocker, Thorndyke opened the door and admitted Professor
Eccles.</p>

<p>"I am a little before my time," the latter remarked as he shook
hands, "but I wanted to have a few words with you before Mr. Hollis
arrived. I understand that you want me to give an opinion on some
doubtful stones of his. Are they new ones? Because I may say that I
looked over his collection very carefully less than two years ago
and I can state confidently that it contained no gems that were not
unquestionably genuine. But I have heard some rumours of a
robbery&mdash;unfounded, I hope, seeing that Hollis proposes to
bequeath his treasures to the national collection."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," replied Thorndyke, "that the rumours are correct;
but that is what you are going to help us to decide. It is not a
case of simple robbery. The stolen stones seem to have been
replaced by imitations; and as you examined the collection when it
was undoubtedly intact, you will see at once if there has been any
substitution."</p>

<p>He proceeded to give the professor a brief account of the case
and the curious problem that it presented, and he had barely
finished when a cab was heard to draw up below. A minute later, as
the two men stood at the open door, the visitor made his
appearance, followed by the cabman, each carrying a bulky but
apparently light wooden case.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollis was a typical business man&mdash;dry, brisk, and
shrewd-looking. Having shaken hands with the professor and
introduced himself to Thorndyke, he dismissed the cabman and came
to the point without preamble.</p>

<p>"This case, marked A, contains the full boxes. The other, marked
B, contains the empties. I will leave you to deal with that at your
convenience. My concern and Professor Eccles's is with the other,
which I will open at once and then we can get to work."</p>

<p>He thrust the despised case B into a corner, and hoisting the
other on to the table, unbuckled the straps, unlocked it, threw
open the lid, and took out six sealed packages, which he placed
side by side on the table.</p>

<p>"Shall I open them?" he asked, producing a pocket knife, "or
will you?</p>

<p>"Before we disturb them," said Thorndyke, "we had better examine
the exteriors very carefully."</p>

<p>"I've done that," said Hollis. "I've been over each one most
thoroughly and, so far as I can see, they are in exactly the same
condition as they were when I handed them to Woodstock. The writing
on them is certainly my writing and the seals are impressions of my
seal, which, as you see, I carry on my finger in this ring."</p>

<p>"In that case," said Thorndyke, "we may as well open them
forthwith. Perhaps I had better take off the wrappings, as I should
like to preserve them and the seals intact."</p>

<p>He took up the first package and turned it over in his hands,
examining each surface closely. And as he did so, his two visitors
watched him&mdash;the professor with slightly amused curiosity, the
other with a dry, rather impatient manner not without a trace of
scepticism. The package was about fourteen inches in length by nine
wide and five inches deep. It was very neatly covered with a
strong, smooth white paper bearing a
number&mdash;thirteen&mdash;and a written and signed list of the
contents, and sealed at each end in the middle. The paper was
further secured by a string, tied tightly and skilfully, of which
the knot was embedded in a mass of wax on which was an excellent
impression of the seal.</p>

<p>"You see," Hollis pointed out, "that the parcel has been made as
secure as human care could make it. I should have said that it was
perfectly impossible to open it without breaking the seals."</p>

<p>"But surely," exclaimed the professor, "it would be an absolute
impossibility! Don't you agree, Dr. Thorndyke?"</p>

<p>"We shall be better able to judge when we have seen the inside,"
the latter replied. With a small pair of scissors he cut the
string, which he placed on one side, and then, with great care, cut
round each of the seals, removing them with the portions of paper
on which they were fixed and putting them aside with the string.
The rest of the paper was now taken off, disclosing a plain,
white-wood box, the keyhole of which was covered by a strip of tape
secured at each end by a seal seated in a small circular pit.
Thorndyke cut the tape and held the box towards Hollis, who already
held the key in readiness. This having been inserted and turned,
Thorndyke raised the lid and laid the box on the table.</p>

<p>"There, Professor," said he; "you can now answer your own
question. The list of contents is on the cover. It is for you to
say whether that list correctly describes the things which are
inside."</p>

<p>Professor Eccles drew a chair up to the table, and lifting from
the inside of the box a thick pad of tissue paper (which Thorndyke
took from him and placed with the string and the seals), ran his
eye quickly over the neatly-arranged assemblage of jewels that
reposed on a second layer of tissue. Very soon a slight frown began
to wrinkle his forehead. He bent more closely over the box, looked
narrowly first at one gem, then at another, and at length picked
out a small, plain pendant set with a single oval green stone about
half an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>"Leaf-green jargoon," said he, reading from the list as he
produced a Coddington lens from his pocket; "that is the one, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>Hollis grunted an assent as he watched the professor inspecting
the gem through his lens.</p>

<p>"I remember the stone," said the professor. "It was one of the
finest of the kind that I have ever seen. Well, this isn't it. This
is not a jargoon at all. It is just a lump of green
glass&mdash;flint glass, in fact. But it is quite well cut. The
lapidary knew his job better than the jeweller. There has been some
very rough work on the setting."</p>

<p>"How much was the stone worth?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

<p>"The original? Not more than thirty pounds, I should say. It was
a beautiful and interesting stone, but rather a collector's
specimen than a jeweller's piece. The public won't give big prices
for out-of-the-way stones. They like diamonds, rubies, sapphires,
and emeralds."</p>

<p>"Is this counterfeit a true facsimile of the original? I mean as
to size and style of cutting?"</p>

<p>Professor Eccles took from his pocket a small leather case, from
which he extracted a calliper gauge. Applying this delicately to
the exposed edges of the "girdle" between the claws, he read the
vernier and then reapplied it in the other diameter.</p>

<p>"Seven-twelfths by three-quarters of an inch, brilliant cut," he
announced. "Do you happen to remember the dimensions, Mr. Hollis?
These can't be far out, as the stone fits the setting."</p>

<p>"I've brought my catalogue," said Hollis, producing a small, fat
volume from his pocket. "Thought we might want it. What's the
number? Three-sixty-three. Here we are. 'Jargoon. Full leaf-green.
Brilliant cut. Seven-twelfths by three-quarters.'</p>

<p>"Then," said the professor, "this would seem to be a perfect
replica. Queer, isn't it? I see your point, Doctor. This fellow has
been to endless pains and some expense in lapidary's
charges&mdash;unless he is a lapidary himself&mdash;to say nothing
of the risk; and all to get possession of a stone worth only about
thirty pounds, and not easily marketable at that."</p>

<p>"Some of the other stones are worth more, though," remarked
Hollis.</p>

<p>"True, true," agreed the professor. "Let us look at some of the
others. Ha! Here is one that looks a little suspicious, if my
memory serves."</p>

<p>He picked out a gold ornament set with a large cat's-eye
bordered with small diamonds and exhibited it to Hollis, who bent
down to inspect it.</p>

<p>"Cat's-eye," he commented, after a long and anxious inspection.
"Well, it looks all right to me. What's the matter with it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is a cat's-eye, sure enough, but not the right kind, I
think. What does the catalogue say?"</p>

<p>Hollis turned over a page and read out: "Chrysoberyl. Cymophane
or cat's-eye. Brown, oval, cut en cabochon. Five-eighths by half an
inch. Bordered by twelve diamonds."</p>

<p>"I thought so," said the professor. "This is a cat's-eye, but
not a chrysoberyl. It is a quartz cat's-eye. But I should hardly
have thought it would have been worth the trouble and expense of
making the exchange. You see," he added, taking the dimensions with
his gauge, "this stone is apparently a facsimile of the missing one
in size and shape and not a bad match in colour. The diamonds don't
appear to have been tampered with."</p>

<p>"What about that emerald?" Hollis asked anxiously, indicating a
massive ring set with a large, square stone bordered with diamonds.
Professor Eccles picked up the ring, and at the first glance he
pursed up his lips, dubiously. But he examined it carefully through
his lens, nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded Hollis.</p>

<p>The professor shook his head sadly. "Paste," he replied. "A good
imitation as such things go, but unmistakable glass. Will you read
out the description?"</p>

<p>Hollis did so; and once again the correspondence in dimensions
and cutting showed the forgery to be a carefully-executed
facsimile.</p>

<p>"This fellow was a conscientious rascal," said the professor.
"He did the thing thoroughly&mdash;excepting the settings."</p>

<p>"Yes, damn him!" Hollis agreed, savagely. "That ring cost me
close on twelve hundred pounds. It came from Lord Pycroft's
collection."</p>

<p>Professor Eccles was deeply concerned; naturally enough, for any
robbery of precious things involves a wicked waste. And then there
was the depressing fact that the valuable "Hollis bequest" was
melting away before his eyes. Gloomily, he picked out one after
another of the inmates of the box and regretfully added them to the
growing heap of the rejected.</p>

<p>When the first box had been emptied, the second was attacked
with similar procedure, and so on with the remainder, until the
last box had been probed to the bottom, when the professor sat back
in his chair and drew a deep breath. "Well," he exclaimed, "it is a
terrible disaster and profoundly mysterious. In effect, the
collection has been skimmed of everything of real value. Even the
moonstones have been exchanged for cheap specimens with the rough
native cutting untouched. I have never heard of anything like it.
But I don't understand why the fellow took all this trouble. He
couldn't have supposed that the robbery would pass undetected."</p>

<p>"It might easily have remained undetected long enough to confuse
the issues," said Thorndyke. "If the jewels had been returned to
the cabinets and lain there undisturbed for a few months, it would
have been very difficult to determine exactly when, or where, or
how the robbery had been carried out."</p>

<p>"Yes," growled Hollis. "The scoundrel must have known that I am
no expert and reckoned on my not spotting the change. And I don't
suppose I should, for that matter. However, the cat slipped out of
the bag sooner than he expected and now the police are close on his
heels. I'll have my pound of flesh out of him yet."</p>

<p>As he snapped out this expression of his benevolent intentions,
Mr. Hollis gathered up the remnant of unrifled jewels and was about
to deposit them in one of the empty boxes when Thorndyke
interposed.</p>

<p>"May I lend you a deed-box with some fresh packing? I think we
agreed that the empty boxes and the packing should be left with me,
that I might examine them thoroughly before returning them."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Hollis, "though it seems a pretty futile thing
to do. But I suppose you know your own business. What about those
sham stones?"</p>

<p>"I should like to examine them too, as they are facsimile
imitations; and we may possibly learn some thing from the
settings."</p>

<p>"What do you expect to learn?" Hollis inquired in a tone which
pretty plainly conveyed his expectations.</p>

<p>"Very little," Thorndyke replied (on which Hollis nodded a
somewhat emphatic agreement). "But," he continued, "this case will
depend on circumstantial evidence&mdash;unless the robber
confesses&mdash;and that evidence has yet to be discovered. We can
do no more than use our eyes to the best advantage in the hope that
we may light on some trace that may give us a lead."</p>

<p>Hollis nodded again. "Sounds pretty hopeless," said he.
"However, Mr. Penfield advised me to put the affair in your hands,
so I have done so. If you should discover anything that will help
us with the prosecution, I suppose you will let me know."</p>

<p>"I shall keep Mr. Penfield informed as to what evidence, if any,
is available, and he will, no doubt, communicate with you."</p>

<p>With this rather vague promise Mr. Hollis appeared to be
satisfied, for he pursued the subject no farther, but, having
packed the poor remainder of his treasures in the deed-box,
prepared to depart.</p>

<p>"Before you go," said Thorndyke, "I should like to take a trial
impression of your seal, if you would allow me."</p>

<p>Hollis stared at him in amazement. "My seal!" he exclaimed.
"Why, good God, sir, you have already got some seventy
impressions&mdash;six from each of these boxes and all those from
the empties!"</p>

<p>"The seals that I have," Thorndyke replied, "are the questioned
seals. I should like to have what scientists call a 'control.'</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by 'questioned seals,'" Hollis
retorted. "I haven't questioned them, I have acknowledged them as
my own seals."</p>

<p>"I think," Thorndyke rejoined with a faint smile, "that Mr.
Penfield would advise you to acknowledge nothing. But, furthermore,
none of these seals is a really perfect impression such as one
would require for purposes of comparison."</p>

<p>"Comparison!" exclaimed Hollis. "Comparison with what? But
there," he concluded with a sour smile, "it's no use arguing. Have
it your own way. I suppose you know what you are about."</p>

<p>With this, he drew off the ring, and, laying it on the table,
bestowed a glance of defiance on Thorndyke. The latter had,
apparently, made his preparations, for he promptly produced from a
drawer a small box, the opening of which revealed a supply of
sealing-wax, a spirit-lamp, a metal plate, a little crucible or
melting-ladle with a wooden handle, a bottle of oil, a camel's-hair
brush, and a number of small squares of white paper. While he was
setting out this apparatus the professor examined the seal through
his lens.</p>

<p>"A fine example," he pronounced. "Syracusan, I should say,
fourth or fifth century B.C. Not unlike the decadrachm of that
period&mdash;the racing Quadriga with the winged Victory above and
the panoply of armour below seem to recall that coin. The stone
seems to be green chalcedony. It is a beautiful work. Seems almost
a pity to employ it in common use."</p>

<p>He surrendered it regretfully to Thorndyke, who, having taken an
infinitesimal drop of oil on the point of the brush and wiped it
off on the palm of his hand, delicately brushed the surface of the
seal. Then he laid a square of paper on the metal plate, broke off
a piece from one of the sticks of sealing-wax and melted it in the
crucible over the lamp. When it was completely liquefied, he poured
it slowly on the centre of the square of paper, where it formed a
circular, convex pool. Having given this a few seconds to cool, he
took the ring and pressed it steadily on the soft wax. When he
raised it&mdash;which he did with extreme care, steadying the paper
with his fingers&mdash;the wax bore an exquisitely perfect
impression of the seal.</p>

<p>Hollis was visibly impressed by the careful manipulation and the
fine result; and when Thorndyke had repeated the procedure, he
requested that a third impression might be made for his own use.
This having been made and bestowed in the deed-box, he replaced the
ring on his finger, bade the professor and Thorndyke a curt
farewell, and made his way down to the waiting cab.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind him, the professor turned to Thorndyke
with a somewhat odd expression on his face.</p>

<p>"This is a very mysterious affair, Doctor," said he.</p>

<p>The curiously significant tone caused Thorndyke to cast a quick,
inquiring glance at the speaker. But he merely repeated the
latter's remark.</p>

<p>"A very mysterious affair, indeed."</p>

<p>"As I understand it," the professor continued, "Hollis claims
that these gems were stolen from the boxes while they were in the
solicitor's strong-room; and that they were taken without breaking
the seals. But that sounds like sheer nonsense. And yet the
solicitor appears to accept the suggestion."</p>

<p>"Yes. Hollis claims that the gems that were put into the boxes
were the real gems; and both he and the solicitor, Woodstock, base
their beliefs on the fact that Woodstock's confidential clerk
appears to have absconded immediately after the discovery of the
robbery."</p>

<p>"H'm!" grunted the professor. "Is it quite clear that the clerk
has really absconded?"</p>

<p>"He has disappeared for no known reason."</p>

<p>"H'm. Not quite the same thing, is it? But has it been
established that the real stones were actually in the boxes when
they were handed to the solicitor?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't use the word 'established,'" Thorndyke admitted.
"There is evidence that one stone, at least, was intact a day or
two before the boxes were deposited; and that stone&mdash;a large
emerald&mdash;was found to have been changed when the box was
opened."</p>

<p>The professor grunted dubiously and reflected awhile. Then he
looked hard at Thorndyke and appeared to be about to make some
observation; and then he seemed to alter his mind, for he concluded
with the somewhat colourless remark: "Well, I daresay you are quite
alive to all the possibilities"; and with this he prepared to take
his departure.</p>

<p>"Do you happen," asked Thorndyke, "to know the addresses of any
lapidaries who specialize in imitation stones?"</p>

<p>Professor Eccles reflected. "Imitations are rather out of my
province," he replied. "Of course any lapidary could cut a paste
gem or make a doublet or triplet, and would if paid for the job. I
will write down the addresses of one or two men who have worked for
me and they will probably be able to give you any further
information." He wrote down two or three addresses, and as he put
away his pencil, he asked: "How is your colleague, Jervis? He is
still with you, I suppose?</p>

<p>"Jervis," was the reply, "is at present an independent
practitioner. He accepted, on my advice, a whole-time appointment
at the 'Griffin' Life Assurance Office. But he drops in from time
to time to lend me a hand. I will tell him you asked after him. And
let me tender you my very warmest thanks for your invaluable help
to-day."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," said the professor, "you need not thank me. I am an
interested party. If Hollis doesn't recover his gems, the national
collection is going to lose a valuable bequest. Bear that in mind
as an additional spur to your endeavours. Good-bye, and good
luck!"</p>

<p>With a hearty handshake and a valedictory smile, Professor
Eccles let himself out and went his way, apparently in a deeply
thoughtful frame of mind, as Thorndyke judged by observing his
receding figure from the window.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THORNDYKE MAKES A
BEGINNING</h2>

<p class="first">THE profound cogitations of Professor Eccles set
up in the mind of Thorndyke a sort of induced psychic current. As
he turned from the window and began to occupy himself in sorting
his material preparatory to examining it, his thoughts were busy
with his late visitor. The professor had been about to say
something and had suddenly thought better of it. Now, what could it
have been that he was about to say? And why had he not said it? And
what was the meaning of that strangely intent look that he had
bestowed on Thorndyke, and that rather odd expression that his face
had borne? And, finally, what were those 'possibilities' at which
he had hinted?</p>

<p>These were the questions that Thorndyke asked himself as he
carried out, quietly and methodically, the preliminaries to his
later investigations; with the further questions: Did the professor
know anything that bore on the mystery? and if so, what was it that
he knew? He evidently had no knowledge either of Woodstock or of
Osmond, but he was fairly well acquainted with Hollis. It was
manifest that he rejected utterly the alleged robbery from the
strong-room; which implied a conviction that the exchange of stones
had been made either before the boxes were handed to Woodstock or
after they had been received back from him.</p>

<p>It was a perfectly natural and reasonable belief. Mr. Penfield
had been of the same opinion. But Mr. Penfield had no special
knowledge of the matter. His opinion had been based exclusively on
the integrity of the seals. Was this the professor's case, too? Or
was he in possession of some significant facts which he had not
disclosed? His manner rather suggested that he was. Perhaps it
might be expedient, later, to sound him cautiously. But this would
depend on the amount and kind of information that was yielded by
other sources.</p>

<p>By the time he reached this conclusion the sorting process was
completed. The six boxes with their contents replaced were set out
in order, the empties put together as well as was possible, and the
seals from the wrapping of each box put into a separate envelope on
which the number and description was written. A supply of white
paper was laid on the table together with a number of new paper
bags, and a little simple microscope which consisted of a
watchmaker's compound eye-glass mounted on a small wooden stand.
Thorndyke ran his eye over the collection to see that everything
was in order; then, dismissing the professor from his mind, he drew
a chair up to the table and fell to work.</p>

<p>He began with the seals. Opening one of the envelopes, he took
out the four seals&mdash;including that on the knot, which he had
cut off&mdash;and laying them out on the table, examined them
quickly, one after the other. Then he picked up one of them, laid
it on a card and placed the card on the stage of the magnifier,
through which he made a more prolonged examination, turning the
card from time to time to alter the incidence of the light, and
jotting down on a note-block a few brief memoranda. The same
procedure was followed with the other three seals, and when they
had all been examined they were returned to their envelope, the top
sheet of the note-block was detached and put in with them, the
envelope was put aside and a fresh one opened. Finally he came to
the envelope which contained the two impressions that he had,
himself, taken from Hollis's seal, but these were not subjected to
the minute scrutiny that the others had received. They were merely
laid on the card, slipped under the magnifier, and after a single,
brief glance, returned to their envelope and put aside. Next, the
seals in the recesses by the keyholes of the boxes were
scrutinized, the eyeglass being swung clear of its stand for the
purpose, and when this had been done, the fresh set of notes was
detached and slipped into one of the envelopes.</p>

<p>But this did not conclude the examination. Apparently there was
some further point to be elucidated. Rising from his chair,
Thorndyke fetched from a cabinet a microscope of the kind used for
examining documents&mdash;a heavy-based instrument with a long,
pivoted arm and a bull's-eye condenser. With this he re-examined
the seals in succession, beginning with the two impressions that he
had, himself, taken; and it might have been noticed that this
examination concerned itself exclusively with a particular spot on
the seal&mdash;a portion of the background just in front of the
chariot and above the back of the near horse.</p>

<p>He had just finished and was replacing the microscope in the
cabinet when the door opened silently and a small, clerical-looking
man entered the room and regarded him benevolently.</p>

<p>"I have laid a cold lunch, sir, in the small room upstairs," he
announced, "and I have put everything ready in your laboratory. Can
I help you to carry anything up?" As he spoke, he ran an obviously
inquisitive eye over the row of boxes and the numbered
envelopes.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Polton," Thorndyke replied. "I think we will take
these things up out of harm's way and I will just look them over
before lunch. But meanwhile there is a small job that you might get
on with. I have here a collection of seals of which I want enlarged
photographs made&mdash;four diameters magnification and each set on
a separate negative and numbered similarly to the envelopes."</p>

<p>He exhibited the collection to his trusty coadjutor with a few
words of explanation, when Polton tenderly gathered together the
seven envelopes, and master and man betook themselves to the upper
regions, each laden with a consignment of Mr. Hollis's boxes, full
and empty.</p>

<p>The laboratory of which Polton had spoken was a smallish room
which Thorndyke reserved for his own use, and which was on the same
floor as the large laboratory and the workshop over which Polton
presided. Its principal features were a long work-bench, covered
with polished linoleum and at present occupied by a microscope and
a tray of slides, needles, forceps, and other accessories, a
side-table, a cupboard, and several sets of shelves.</p>

<p>"Is there anything more, sir?" Polton asked when the boxes had
been stacked on the side-table. He looked at them wistfully as he
spoke, but accepted with resignation the polite negative and stole
out, shutting the door silently behind him As soon as he had gone,
Thorndyke fell to work with a rapid but unhurried method suggestive
of a fixed purpose and a considered plan. He began by putting on a
pair of thin rubber gloves. Then, spreading on the bench a sheet of
white demy paper such as chemists use for wrapping bottles, he took
one of the boxes, detached its wrapping paper, opened the box, and
taking out the jewels and the pads of tissue paper, deposited the
former at one end of the bench and the latter at the other,
together with the empty box. First he dealt with the pads of tissue
paper, one of which he placed on the sheet of white paper, and
having opened it out and smoothed it with an ivory paper-knife,
examined it closely on both sides with the aid of a reading glass.
Then he took from a drawer a large tuning-fork, and holding the
packing paper vertically over the middle of the sheet on the bench,
he struck the tuning-fork sharply, and while it was vibrating,
lightly applied its tip to the centre of the suspended paper,
causing it to hum like a gigantic bumble-bee and to vibrate visibly
at its edges. Having repeated this proceeding two or three times,
he laid the paper aside and with the reading glass inspected the
sheet of demy, on which a quite considerable number of minute
specks of dust were now to be seen. This procedure he repeated with
the other pads of tissue paper from the box, and as he worked, the
sheet of white paper on the bench became more and more
conspicuously sprinkled with particles of dust until, by the time
all the pads had been treated, a quite appreciable quantity of dust
had accumulated. Finally, Thorndyke took the box itself and, having
opened it, placed its bottom on the sheet of paper and with a small
mallet tapped it lightly but sharply all over the bottom and sides.
When he lifted it from the paper, the further contribution of dust
could be plainly seen in a speckling of the surface corresponding
to the shape of the box.</p>

<p>For some moments Thorndyke stood by the bench looking down on
this powdering of grey that occupied the middle of the sheet of
white paper. Some of the particles, such as vegetable fibres, were
easily recognizable by the unaided eye; and there were two hairs,
evidently moustache hairs, both quite short and of a tawny brown
colour. But he made no detailed examination of the deposit. Taking
from the cupboard a largish flat pill-box, he wrote on its lid the
number of the box, and then, having lightly folded the sheet of
paper, carefully assembled the dust into a tiny heap in the middle
and transferred it to the pill-box, applying the tuning-fork to the
sheet to propel the last few grains to their destination. Then,
having put the box aside and deposited the sheets of tissue
paper&mdash;neatly folded&mdash;in a numbered envelope, he spread a
fresh sheet of demy on the bench, and taking up another box from
the side-table, subjected it to similar treatment; and so,
carefully and methodically, he dealt with the entire collection of
boxes, never pausing for more than a rapid glance at the sprinkling
of dust that each one yielded.</p>

<p>He was just shooting the 'catch' from the last package into the
pill-box when a quick step was audible on the stairs, and after a
short interval Polton let himself in silently.</p>

<p>"Here's Dr. Jervis, sir," said he, "and he says he hasn't had
lunch yet. It is past three o'clock, sir."</p>

<p>"A very delicate hint, Polton," said Thorndyke. "I will join him
immediately&mdash;but here he is, guided by instinct at the very
psychological moment."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Dr. Jervis entered the room and looked about him
inquisitively. From the row of pill-boxes his glance travelled to
the little heaps of jewellery, each on a numbered sheet of
paper.</p>

<p>"This is a quaint collection, Thorndyke," said he, stooping to
inspect the jewels. "What is the meaning of it? I trust that my
learned senior has not, at last, succumbed to temptation; but it is
a suspicious looking lot."</p>

<p>"It does look a little like a fence's stock-in-trade or the
product of a super-burglary," Thorndyke admitted. "However, I think
Polton will be able to reassure you, when he has looked over the
swag. But let us go and feed; and I will give you an outline sketch
of the case in the intervals of mastication. It is quite a curious
problem."</p>

<p>"And I take it," said Jervis, "that those pill-boxes contain the
solution. There is a necromantic look about them that I seem to
recognize. You must tell me about them when you have propounded the
problem."</p>

<p>He followed Thorndyke into the little breakfast-room, and when
they had taken their seats at the table and fairly embarked on
their immediate business, the story of the gem robbery was allowed
to transpire gradually. Jervis followed the narrative with close
attention and an occasional chuckle of amusement.</p>

<p>"It is an odd problem," he commented when the whole story had
been told. "There doesn't seem to be any doubt as to who committed
the robbery; and yet if you were to put this man Osmond into the
dock, although the jury would be convinced to a man of his guilt,
they would have to acquit him. I wonder what the deuce made him
bolt."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "that is what I have been asking myself.
He may be a nervous, panicky man, but that does not look like the
explanation. The suggestion is rather that he knew of some highly
incriminating fact which he expected to come to light, but which
has not come to light. As it is, the only incriminating fact is his
own disappearance, which is evidentially worthless by itself."</p>

<p>"Perfectly. And you are now searching for corroborative facts in
the dust from those boxes. It doesn't look a very hopeful
quest."</p>

<p>"It doesn't," Thorndyke agreed. "But still, circumstantial
evidence gains weight very rapidly. A grain of positive evidence
would give quite a new importance to the disappearance. For
instance, no less than seven of those boxes have yielded moustache
hairs, all apparently from the same person&mdash;a fair man with a
rather closely cropped moustache of a tawny colour. Now, if it
should turn out that Osmond has a moustache of that kind and that
no other person connected with those boxes has a moustache of
precisely that character, this would be a really important item of
evidence, especially coupled with the disappearance."</p>

<p>"It would, indeed; and even the number might be illuminating. I
mean that, although moustache hairs are shed pretty freely, one
would not have expected to find so many. But if the man had the not
uncommon habit of stroking or rubbing his moustache, that would
account for the number that had got detached."</p>

<p>Thorndyke nodded approvingly. "Quite a good point, Jervis. I
will make a note of it for verification. And now, as we seem to
have finished, shall we take a look at one or two of the
samples."</p>

<p>"Exactly what I was going to propose," replied Jervis; and as
they rose and repaired to the small laboratory, he added: "It's
quite like old times to be pursuing a mysterious unknown quantity
with you. I sometimes feel like chucking the insurance job and
coming back."</p>

<p>"It is better to come back occasionally and keep the insurance
job," Thorndyke rejoined as he placed two microscopes on the bench
facing the window and drew up a couple of chairs. "You had better
note the number of each box that you examine, though it is probably
of no consequence."</p>

<p>He took up the collection of pill-boxes, and having placed them
between the two microscopes, sat down, and the two friends then
fell to work, each carefully tipping the contents of a box on to a
large glass slip and laying the latter on the stage of the
microscope.</p>

<p>For some time they worked on in silence, each jotting down on a
note-block brief comments on the specimens examined. When about
half of the boxes had been dealt with&mdash;and their contents very
carefully returned to them&mdash;Jervis leaned back in his chair
and looked thoughtfully at his colleague.</p>

<p>"This is very commonplace, uncharacteristic dust in most
respects," said he, "but there is one queer feature in it that I
don't quite make out. I have found in every specimen a number of
irregularly oval bodies, some of them with pointed ends. They are
about a hundredth of an inch long by a little more than a two
hundredth wide; a dull pink in colour and apparently of a granular
homogeneous substance. I took them at first for insect eggs, but
they are evidently not, as they have no skin or shell. I don't
remember having seen anything exactly like them before. Have you
found any of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Like you, I have found some in every box."</p>

<p>"And what do you make of them? Do you recognize them?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "They are the castings of a
wood-boring beetle; particles of that fine dust that you see in the
worm-holes of worm-eaten wood. Quite an interesting find."</p>

<p>"Quite; unless they come from the boxes that the jewels were
packed in."</p>

<p>"I don't think they do. Those boxes are white wood, whereas
these castings are from a red wood. But we may as well make
sure."</p>

<p>He rose and took up the empty boxes one by one, turning each one
over and examining it closely on all sides.</p>

<p>"You see, Jervis," he said as he laid down the last of them,
"there is not a trace of a worm-hole in any of them. No, that
worm-dust came from an outside source."</p>

<p>"But," exclaimed Jervis, "it is very extraordinary. Don't you
think so? I mean," he continued in response to an inquiring glance
from his colleague, "that the quantity is so astonishing. Just
think of it. In every one of these boxes we have found an
appreciable number of these castings&mdash;quite a large quantity
in the aggregate. But the amount of dust that will fall from a
piece of worm-eaten furniture must be infinitesimal."</p>

<p>"I would hardly agree to that, Jervis. A really badly wormed
piece&mdash;say an old walnut chair or armoire&mdash;may, in the
course of time, shed a surprisingly large amount of dust. But,
nevertheless, my learned friend has, with his usual perspicacity,
laid his finger on the point that is of real evidential
importance&mdash;the remarkable quantity of this dust and its more
or less even distribution among all these boxes. And now you
realize the truth of what I was saying just now as to the
cumulative quality of circumstantial evidence. Here we have a
number of boxes which have undoubtedly been tampered with by some
person. That person is believed to be the man Osmond on the ground
that he has absconded. But his disappearance, by itself, furnishes
no evidence of his guilt. It merely offers a suggestion. He may
have gone away for some entirely different reason.</p>

<p>"Then we find in these boxes certain moustache hairs. If it
should turn out that Osmond has a moustache composed of similar
hairs, that fact alone would not implicate him, since there are
thousands of other men with similar moustaches. But taken in
conjunction with the disappearance, the similarity of the hairs
would constitute an item of positive evidence.</p>

<p>"Then we find some dust derived from worm-eaten wood. Its
presence in these boxes, its character, and its abundance offer
certain suggestions as to the kind of wood, the nature of the
wooden object, and the circumstances attending its deposition in
the boxes. Now, if it should be possible to ascertain the existence
of a wooden object of the kind suggested and associated with the
suggested circumstances, and if that object were the property of,
or definitely associated with, the man Osmond, that fact, together
with the hairs and the disappearance, would form a really weighty
mass of evidence against him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see that," said Jervis; "but what I don't see is how you
arrive at your inferences as to the object from which the dust was
derived."</p>

<p>"It is a question of probabilities," replied Thorndyke. "First,
as to the kind of wood. It is a red wood. It is pretty certainly
not mahogany, as it is too light in colour and mahogany is very
little liable to 'the worm.' But the abundance of dust suggests one
of those woods which are specially liable to be worm eaten. Of
these the fruit woods&mdash;walnut, cherry, apple, and
pear&mdash;are the most extreme cases, cherry being, perhaps, the
worst of all and therefore usually avoided by the cabinet-maker.
But this dust is obviously not walnut. It is the wrong colour. But
it might be either cherry, apple, or pear, and the probabilities
are rather in favour of cherry; though, of course, it might be some
other relatively soft and sappy red wood."</p>

<p>"But how do you infer the nature of the object?"</p>

<p>"Again, by the presence of the dust in these boxes, by the
properties of that dust and the large quantity of it. Consider the
case of ordinary room dust. You find it on all sorts of surfaces,
even high up on the walls or on the ceiling. There is no mystery as
to how it gets there. It consists of minute particles, mostly of
fibres from textiles, so small and light that they float freely in
the air. But this wood consists of relatively large and heavy
bodies&mdash;over a hundredth of an inch long. From the worm-holes
it will fall to the floor; and there it will remain even when the
floor is being swept. It cannot rise in the air and become
deposited like ordinary dust, and it must therefore have made its
way into these boxes in some other manner."</p>

<p>"Yes, I realize that; but still I don't see how that fact throws
any light on the nature of the wooden object."</p>

<p>"It is merely a suggestion," replied Thorndyke; "and the
inference may be quite wrong. But it is a perfectly obvious one.
Come now, Jervis, don't let your intellectual joints get stiff.
Keep them lissom by exercise. Consider the problem of this dust.
How did it get into these boxes and why is there so much of it? If
you reason out the probabilities, you must inevitably reach a
conclusion as to the nature of the wooden object. That conclusion
may turn out to be wrong; but it will be logically
justifiable."</p>

<p>"Well, that is all that matters," Jervis retorted with a sour
smile, as he rose and glanced at his watch. "The mere fact of its
being wrong we should ignore as an irrelevant triviality; just as
the French surgeon, undisturbed by the death of the patient,
proceeded with his operation and finally brought it to a
brilliantly successful conclusion. I will practise your logical
dumbbell exercise, and if I reach no conclusion after all I shall
still be comforted by the mental vision of my learned senior
scouring the country in search of a hypothetical worm-eaten chest
of drawers."</p>

<p>Thorndyke chuckled softly. "My learned friend is pleased to be
ironical. But nevertheless his unerring judgement leads him to a
perfectly correct forecast of my proceedings. The next stage of the
inquiry will consist in tracing this dust to its sources, and the
goal of my endeavours will be the discovery and identification of
this wooden object. If I succeed in that, there will be, I imagine,
very little more left to discover."</p>

<p>"No," Jervis agreed, "especially if the owner of the antique
should happen to be the elusive Mr. Osmond. So I wish you success
in your quest, and only hope it may not resemble too closely that
of the legendary blind man, searching in a dark room for a black
hat&mdash;that isn't there."</p>

<p>With this parting shot and a defiant grin, Jervis took his
departure, leaving Thorndyke to complete the examination of the
remaining material.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>XV. &mdash; MR. WAMPOLE IS
HIGHLY AMUSED</h2>

<p class="first">ON a certain Saturday afternoon at a few minutes
to three the door of Mr. Woodstock's office in High Street,
Burchester, opened somewhat abruptly and disclosed the figures of
the solicitor himself and his chief clerk.</p>

<p>"Confounded nuisance all this fuss and foolery," growled the
former, pulling out his watch and casting an impatient glance up
the street. "I hope he is not going to keep us waiting."</p>

<p>"He is not due till three," Hepburn remarked, soothingly; and
then, stepping out and peering up the nearly empty street, he
added: "Perhaps that may be he&mdash;that tall man with the little
clerical-looking person."</p>

<p>"If it is, he seems to be bringing his luggage with him," said
Mr. Woodstock, regarding the pair, and especially the suit-cases
that they carried, with evident disfavour; "but you are right. They
are coming here."</p>

<p>He put away his watch, and as the two men crossed the road, he
assumed an expression of polite hostility.</p>

<p>"Dr. Thorndyke?" he inquired as the new-comers halted opposite
the doorway; and having received confirmation of his surmise, he
continued: "I am Mr. Woodstock, and this is my colleague, Mr.
Hepburn. May I take it that this gentleman is concerned in our
present business?" As he spoke he fixed a truculent blue eye on
Thorndyke's companion, who crinkled apologetically.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Polton, my laboratory assistant," Thorndyke
explained, "who has come with me to give me any help that I may
need."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Woodstock, glaring inquisitively at the large
suit-case which Polton carried. "Help? I gathered from Mr.
Penfield's letter that you wished to inspect the office, and I must
confess that I found myself utterly unable to imagine why. May I
ask what you expect to learn from an inspection of the
premises?"</p>

<p>"That," replied Thorndyke, "is a rather difficult question to
answer. But as all my information as to what has occurred here is
second-or third-hand, I thought it best to see the place myself and
make a few inquiries on the spot. That is my routine practice."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see," said Woodstock. "Your visit is just a matter of
form, a demonstration of activity. Well, I am sorry I can't be
present at the ceremony. My colleague and I have an engagement
elsewhere; but my office-keeper, Mr. Wampole, will be able to tell
you anything that you may wish to know and show you all there is to
see excepting the strong-room. If you want to see that, as I
suppose you do, I had better show it to you now, as I must take the
key away with me."</p>

<p>He led the way along the narrow hall, half-way down which he
opened a door inscribed 'Clerks' Office', and entered a large room,
now unoccupied save by an elderly man who sat at a table with the
parts of a dismembered electric bell spread out before him. Through
this Mr. Woodstock passed into a somewhat smaller room furnished
with a large writing-table, one or two nests of deed-boxes, and a
set of book-shelves. Nearly opposite the table was the massive door
of the strong-room, standing wide open with the key in the
lock.</p>

<p>"This is my private office," said Mr. Woodstock, "and here is
the strong-room. Perhaps you would like to step inside. I am rather
proud of this room. You don't often see one of this size. And it is
absolutely fire-proof; thick steel lining, concrete outside that,
and then brick. It is practically indestructible. Those confounded
boxes occupied that long upper shelf."</p>

<p>Thorndyke did not appear to be specially interested in the
strong-room. He walked in, looked round at the steel walls with
their ranks of steel shelves, loaded with bundles of documents, and
then walked out.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it is a fine room, as strong and secure as one
could wish; though, of course, its security has no bearing on our
case, since it must have been entered either with its own key or a
duplicate. May I look at the key?"</p>

<p>Mr. Woodstock withdrew it from the lock and handed it to him
without comment, watching him with undisguised impatience as he
turned it over and examined its blade.</p>

<p>"Not a difficult type of key to duplicate," he remarked as he
handed it back, "though these wardless pin-keys are more subtle
than they look."</p>

<p>"I suppose they are," Woodstock assented indifferently. "But
really, these investigations appear to me rather pointless, seeing
that the identity of the thief is known. And now I must be off; but
first let me introduce you to my deputy, Mr. Wampole."</p>

<p>He led the way back to the clerks' office, where his subordinate
was busily engaged in assembling the parts of the bell.</p>

<p>"This is Dr. Thorndyke, Wampole, who has come with his
assistant, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Bolton, to inspect the premises and
make a few inquiries. You can show him anything that he wants to
see and give him all the assistance that you can in the way of
answering questions. And," concluded Mr. Woodstock, shaking hands
stiffly with Thorndyke, "I wish you a successful issue to your
labours."</p>

<p>As Mr. Woodstock and his colleague departed, closing the outer
door after them, Mr. Wampole laid down his screw-driver and looked
at Thorndyke with a slightly puzzled expression.</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand, sir, what you want to do," said he,
"or what sort of inspection you want to make; but I am entirely at
your service, if you will kindly instruct me. What would you like
me to show you first?"</p>

<p>"I don't think we need interrupt your work just at present, Mr.
Wampole. The first thing to be done is to make a rough plan of the
premises, and while my assistant is doing that, perhaps I might ask
you a few questions if it will not distract you too much."</p>

<p>"It will not distract me at all," Mr. Wampole replied, picking
up his screw-driver. "I am accustomed to doing odd jobs about the
office&mdash;I am the handy man of the establishment&mdash;and I am
not easily put out of my stride."</p>

<p>Evidently he was not; for even as he was speaking his fingers
were busy in a neat, purposive way that showed clearly that his
attention was not wandering from his task. Thorndyke watched him
curiously, not quite able to 'place' him. His hands were the
skilful, capable hands of a mechanic, and this agreed with
Woodstock's description of him and his own. But his speech was that
of a passably educated man and his manner was quite dignified and
self-possessed.</p>

<p>"By the way," said Thorndyke, "Mr. Woodstock referred to you as
the office-keeper. Does that mean that you are the custodian of the
premises?"</p>

<p>"Nominally," replied Wampole. "I am a law-writer by profession;
but when I first came here, some twenty years ago, I came as a
caretaker and used to live upstairs. But for many years past the
upstairs rooms have been used for storage&mdash;obsolete books,
documents, and all sorts of accumulations. Nobody lives in the
house now. We lock the place up when we go away at night. As for
me, I am, as I said, the handy man of the establishment. I do
whatever comes along&mdash;copy letters, engross leases, keep an
eye on the state of the premises, and so on."</p>

<p>"I see. Then you probably know as much of the affairs of this
office as anybody."</p>

<p>"Probably, sir. I am the oldest member of the staff, and I am
usually the first to arrive in the morning and the last to leave at
night. I expect I can tell you anything that you want to know."</p>

<p>"Then I will ask you one or two questions, if I may. You
probably know that my visit here is connected with the robbery of
Mr. Hollis's gems?"</p>

<p>"The alleged robbery," Mr. Wampole corrected. "Yes, sir. Mr.
Woodstock told me that."</p>

<p>"You appear to be somewhat doubtful about the robbery."</p>

<p>"I am not doubtful at all," Wampole replied in a tone of great
decision. "I am convinced that the whole thing is a mare's nest.
The gems may have been stolen. I suppose they were as Mr. Hollis
says they were. But they weren't stolen from here."</p>

<p>"You put complete trust in the strong-room?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, I don't, sir. This is a solicitor's strong-room, not a
banker's. It is secure against fire, not against robbery. It was
designed for the custody of things such as documents, of great
value to their owners but of no value to a thief. It was no proper
receptacle for jewels. They should have gone to a bank."</p>

<p>"Do I understand, then, that unauthorized persons might have
obtained access to the strong-room?"</p>

<p>"They might, during business hours. Mr. Woodstock unlocks it
when he arrives and it is usually open all day; or if it is shut,
the key is left hanging on the wall. But it has never been taken
seriously as a bank strong-room is. Mr. Hepburn and Mr. Osmond kept
their cricket-bags and other things in it, and we have all been in
the habit of putting things in there if we were leaving them here
over-night."</p>

<p>"Then, really, any member of the staff had the opportunity to
make away with Mr. Hollis's property?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't put it as strongly as that," replied Wampole, with
somewhat belated caution. "Any of us could have gone into the
strong-room; but not without being seen by some of the others.
Still, one must admit that a robbery might have been possible; the
point is that it didn't happen. I checked those boxes when I helped
to put them in, and I checked them when we took them out. They were
all there in their original wrappings with Mr. Hollis's handwriting
on them and all the seals intact. It is nonsense to talk of a
robbery in the face of those facts."</p>

<p>"And you attach no significance to Mr. Osmond's
disappearance?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. He was a bachelor and could go when and where he
pleased. It was odd of him, I admit, but he sometimes did odd
things; a hasty, impulsive gentleman, quick to jump at conclusions
and make decisions and quick to act. Not a discreet gentleman at
all; rather an unreasonable gentleman, perhaps, but I should say
highly scrupulous. I can't imagine him committing a theft."</p>

<p>"Should you describe him as a nervous or timid man?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wampole emitted a sound as if he had clock work in his
inside and was about to strike. "I never met a less nervous man,"
he replied with emphasis. "No, sir. Bold to rashness would be my
description of Mr. John Osmond. A buccaneering type of man. A
yachtsman, a boxer, a wrestler, a footballer, and a cricketer. A
regular hard nut, sir. He should never have been in an office. He
ought to have been a sailor, an explorer, or a big-game
hunter."</p>

<p>"What was he like to look at?"</p>

<p>"Just what you would expect&mdash;a big, lean, square-built man,
hatchet-faced, Roman-nosed, with blue eyes, light-brown hair, and a
close-cropped beard and moustache. Looked like a naval
officer."</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know if his residence has been examined?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Woodstock and the Chief Constable searched his rooms, but
of course they didn't find anything. He had only two small rooms,
as he took his meals and spent a good deal of his time with Mr.
Hepburn, his brother-in-law. He seemed very fond of his sister and
her two little boys."</p>

<p>"Would it be possible for me to see those rooms?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why not, sir. They are locked up now, but the keys
are here and the rooms are only a few doors down the street."</p>

<p>Here occurred a slight interruption, for Mr. Wampole, having
completed his operations on the bell, now connected it with the
battery&mdash;which had also been under repair&mdash;when it
emitted a loud and cheerful peal. At the same moment, as if
summoned by the sound, Polton entered holding a small drawing-board
on which was a neatly executed plan of the premises.</p>

<p>"Dear me, sir!" exclaimed Mr. Wampole, casting an astonished
glance at the plan. "You are very thorough in your methods. I see
you have even put in the furniture."</p>

<p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, with a faint smile; "we must needs be
thorough even if we reach no result."</p>

<p>Mr. Wampole regarded him with a sly smile. "Very true, sir," he
chuckled&mdash;"very true, indeed. A bill of costs needs something
to explain the total. But, God bless us! what is this?"</p>

<p>"This" was, in effect, a diminutive vacuum cleaner, fitted with
a little revolving brush and driven by means of a large dry
battery, which Polton was at the moment disinterring from his
suit-case. Thorndyke briefly explained the nature of the apparatus
while Mr. Wampole stared at it with an expression of stupe
faction.</p>

<p>"But why have you brought it here, sir?" he exclaimed. "The
premises would certainly be the better for a thorough cleaning, but
surely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, we are not going to 'vacuum clean' you," Thorndyke
reassured him. "We are going to take samples of dust from the
different parts of the premises."</p>

<p>"Are you, indeed, sir? And, if I may take the liberty of asking,
what do you propose to do with them?"</p>

<p>"I shall examine them carefully when I get home," Thorndyke
replied, "and I may then possibly be able to judge whether the
robbery took place here or elsewhere."</p>

<p>As Thorndyke furnished this explanation, Mr. Wampole stood
gazing at him as if petrified. Once he opened his mouth, but shut
it again tightly as if not trusting himself to speak. At length he
rejoined: "Wonderful! wonderful!" and then, after an interval, he
continued meditatively: "I seem to have read somewhere of a wise
woman of the East who was able, by merely examining a hair from the
beard of a man who had fallen downstairs, to tell exactly how many
stairs he had fallen down. But I never imagined that it was
actually possible."</p>

<p>"It does sound incredible," Thorndyke admitted, gravely. "She
must have had remarkable powers of deduction. And now, if Mr.
Polton is ready, we will begin our perambulation. Which was Mr.
Osmond's office?"</p>

<p>"I will show you," replied Mr. Wampole, recovering from his
trance of astonishment. He led the way out into the hall and thence
into a smallish room in which were a writing-table and a large,
old-fashioned, flap-top desk.</p>

<p>"This table," he explained, "is Mr. Hepburn's. The desk was used
by Mr. Osmond and his belongings are still in it. That second door
opens into Mr. Woodstock's office."</p>

<p>"Is it usually kept open or closed?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

<p>"It is nearly always open; and as it is, as you see"&mdash;here
he threw it open&mdash;"exactly opposite the door of the
strong-room, no one could go in there unobserved unless Mr.
Woodstock, Mr. Hepburn, and Mr. Osmond had all been out at the same
time."</p>

<p>Thorndyke made a note of this statement and then asked: "Would
it be permissible to look inside Mr. Osmond's desk? Or is it
locked?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it is locked. No, it is not," he added,
demonstrating the fact by raising the lid; "and, as you see, there
is nothing very secret inside."</p>

<p>The contents, in fact, consisted of a tobacco-tin, a couple of
briar pipes, a ball of string, a pair of gloves, a clothes-brush, a
pair of much-worn hair-brushes, and a number of loose letters and
bills. These last Thorndyke gathered together and laid aside
without examination, and then proceeded methodically to inspect
each of the other objects in turn, while Mr. Wampole watched him
with the faintest shadow of a smile.</p>

<p>"He seems to have had a pretty good set of teeth and a fairly
strong jaw," Thorndyke remarked, balancing a massive pipe in his
fingers and glancing at the deep tooth-marks on the mouth-piece,
"which supports your statement as to his physique."</p>

<p>He peered into the tobacco-tin, smelt the tobacco, inspected the
gloves closely, especially at their palmar surfaces, and tried them
on; examined the clothes brush, first with the naked eye and then
with the aid of his pocket-lens, and, holding it inside the desk,
stroked its hair backwards and forwards, looking closely to see if
any dust fell from it. Finally, he took up the hair-brushes one at
a time and, having examined them in the same minute fashion,
produced from his pocket a pair of fine forceps and a
seed-envelope. With the forceps he daintily picked out from the
brushes a number of hairs which he laid on a sheet of paper,
eventually transferring the collection to the little envelope, on
which he wrote: "Hairs from John Osmond's hair-brushes."</p>

<p>"You don't take anything for granted, sir," remarked Mr.
Wampole, who had been watching this proceeding with concentrated
interest (perhaps he was again reminded of the wise woman of the
East).</p>

<p>"No," Thorndyke agreed. "Your description was hearsay testimony,
whereas these hairs could be produced in Court and sworn to by
me."</p>

<p>"So they could, sir; though, as it is not disputed that Mr.
Osmond has been in this office, I don't quite see what they could
prove."</p>

<p>"Neither do I," rejoined Thorndyke. "I was merely laying down
the principle."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Polton had been silently carrying out his part of the
programme, not unobserved by Mr. Wampole; and a pale patch about a
foot square, between Mr. Hepburn's chair and the front of the
table, where the pattern of the grimy carpet had miraculously
reappeared, marked the site of his operations. Tenderly removing
the little silken bag, now bulging with its load of dust, he
slipped it into a numbered envelope and wrote the number on the
spot on the plan to which it corresponded.</p>

<p>Presently a similar patch appeared on the carpet in front of
Osmond's desk, and when the sample had been disposed of and the
spot on the plan marked, Polton cast a wistful glance at the open
desk.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be as well, sir, to take a specimen from the
inside?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would," Thorndyke replied. "It should give us what
we may call a 'pure culture.'" He rapidly emptied the desk of its
contents, when Polton introduced the nozzle of his apparatus and
drew it slowly over every part of the interior. When this operation
was completed, including the disposal of the specimen and the
marking of the plan, the party moved into Mr. Woodstock's office,
and from thence back into the clerks' office.</p>

<p>"I find this investigation intensely interesting," said Mr.
Wampole, rubbing his hands gleefully. "It seems to combine the
attractions of a religious ceremony and a parlour game. I am
enjoying it exceedingly. You will like to have the names of the
clerks who sit at those desks, I presume."</p>

<p>"If you please," replied Thorndyke.</p>

<p>"And, of course, you will wish to take samples from the insides
of the desks. You certainly ought to. The informal lunches which
the occupants consume during the forenoon will have left traces
which should be most illuminating. And the desks are not locked, as
there are no keys."</p>

<p>Mr. Wampole's advice produced on Polton's countenance a smile of
most extraordinary crinkliness, but Thorndyke accepted it with
unmoved gravity and it was duly acted upon. Each of the desks was
opened and emptied of its contents&mdash;instructive enough as to
the character and personal habits of the tenant&mdash;and cleared
of its accumulation of crumbs, tobacco-ash, and miscellaneous dirt,
the 'catch' forming a specimen supplementary to those obtained from
the floor. At length, when they had made the round of the office,
leaving in their wake a succession of clean squares on the matting
which covered the floor, Mr. Wampole halted before an old-fashioned
high desk which stood in a corner in company with a high
office-stool.</p>

<p>"This is my desk," said he. "I presume that you are going to
take a little souvenir from it?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Thorndyke, "we may as well complete the series.
We operated on Mr. Hollis's premises this morning."</p>

<p>"Did you indeed, sir! You went there first; and very proper too.
I am sure Mr. Hollis was very gratified."</p>

<p>"If he was," Thorndyke replied with a smile, "he didn't make it
obtrusively apparent. May I compliment you on your desk? You keep
it in apple-pie order."</p>

<p>"I try to show the juniors an example," replied Mr. Wampole,
throwing back the lid of the desk and looking complacently at the
neatly stowed contents. "It is a miscellaneous collection," he
added as he proceeded to transfer his treasures from the desk to a
cleared space on the table.</p>

<p>It certainly was. There were a few tools&mdash;pliers, hack-saw,
hammer, screw-driver, and a couple of gimlets&mdash;a loosely
folded linen apron, one or two battery terminals and a coil of
insulated wire, a stamp-album, a cardboard tray full of military
buttons, cap-badges, and old civilian coat buttons, and a smaller
tray containing one or two old copper and silver coins.</p>

<p>"I see you are a stamp collector," remarked Thorndyke, opening
the album and casting a glance of lukewarm interest over its
variegated pages.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply, "in a small way. It is a poor man's hobby,
unless one seeks to acquire costly rarities, which I do not. As a
matter of fact, I seldom buy specimens at all. This album has been
filled principally from our foreign correspondence. And the same is
true of the coins. I don't regularly collect them; I just keep any
odd specimens that come my way."</p>

<p>"And the buttons? You have a better opportunity there, for you
have practically no competitors. And yet it seems to me that they
are of more interest than the things that the conventional
collectors seek so eagerly."</p>

<p>"I entirely agree with you, sir," Mr. Wampole replied, warmly.
"It is the common things that are best worth collecting&mdash;the
things that are common now and will be rare in a few years' time.
But the collector who has no imagination neglects things until they
have become rare and precious. Then he buys at a high price what he
could have got a few years previously for nothing. Look at these
old gilt coat-buttons. I got them from an old-established tailor
who was clearing out his obsolete stock. Unfortunately, he had
thrown away most of them and nearly all the steel button-dies. I
just managed to rescue these few and one or two dies, which I have
at home. They are of no value now, but when the collectors discover
the interest of old buttons, they will be worth their weight in
gold. I am collecting all the buttons I can get hold of."</p>

<p>"I think you are wise, from a collector's point of view. By the
way, did you ever meet with any of those leather-bound sample
wallets that the old button-makers used to supply to tailors?"</p>

<p>"Never," replied Mr. Wampole. "I have never even heard of
them."</p>

<p>"I have seen one or two," said Thorndyke, "and each was a
collection in itself, for it contained some two or three hundred
buttons, fixed in sheets of mill-board, forming a sort of album;
and, of course, every button was different from every other."</p>

<p>Mr. Wampole's eyes sparkled. "What an opportunity you had, sir!"
he exclaimed. "But probably you are not a collector. It was a pity,
though, for, as you say, one of those wallets was a museum in
itself. If you should ever chance to meet with another, would it be
too great a liberty for me to beg you to secure an option for me,
at a price within my slender means?"</p>

<p>"It is no liberty at all," Thorndyke replied. "It is not likely
that I shall ever come across one again, but if I should, I will
certainly secure it for you."</p>

<p>"That is most kind of you, sir," exclaimed Mr. Wampole. "And
now, as Mr. Polton seems to have completed the cleansing of my
desk&mdash;the first that it has had, I am afraid, for a year or
two&mdash;we may continue our exploration. Did you wish to examine
the waiting-room?"</p>

<p>"I think not. I have just looked into it, but its associations
are too ambiguous for the dust to be of any interest. But I should
like to glance at the rooms upstairs."</p>

<p>To the upstairs rooms they accordingly proceeded, but the
inspection was little more than a formality. They walked slowly
through each room, awakening the echoes as they trod the bare
floors, and as they went, Thorndyke's eye travelled searchingly
over the shelves and rough tables, stacked with documents and
obsolete account-books, and the few rickety Windsor chairs. There
was certainly an abundance of dust, as Mr. Wampole pointed out, but
it did not appear to be of the brand in which Thorndyke was
interested.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Wampole, as they descended to the ground-floor,
"you have now seen the whole of our premises. I think you said that
you would like to inspect Mr. Osmond's rooms. If you will wait a
few moments, I will get the keys."</p>

<p>He disappeared into the principal's office, and meanwhile Polton
rapidly packed his apparatus in the suit case, so that by the time
Mr. Wampole reappeared, he was ready to start.</p>

<p>"Mr. Osmond's rooms," said Mr. Wampole, as they set forth, "are
over a bookseller's shop. This is the place. If you will wait for a
moment at the private door, I will notify the landlord of our
visit." He entered the shop and after a short interval emerged
briskly and stepped round to the side-door, into which he inserted
a latch-key. He led the way along the narrow hall, past a partially
open door, in the opening of which a portion of a human face was
visible, to the staircase, up which the little procession advanced
until the second-floor landing was reached. Here Mr. Wampole halted
and, selecting a key from the small bunch, unlocked and opened a
door, and preceded his visitors into the room.</p>

<p>"It is just as well that you came to-day," he remarked, "for I
understand that Mrs. Hepburn is going to take charge of these
rooms. A day or two later and she would have been beforehand with
you in the matter of dust. As it is, you ought to get quite a good
haul."</p>

<p>"Quite," Thorndyke agreed. "There is plenty of dust; but in
spite of that, the place has a very neat, orderly appearance. Do
you happen to know whether the rooms have been tidied up since Mr.
Osmond left?"</p>

<p>"They are just as he left them," was the reply, "excepting that
the Chief Constable and Mr. Woodstock came and looked over them.
But I don't think they disturbed them to any extent. There isn't
much to disturb, as you see."</p>

<p>Mr. Wampole was right. The furnishing of the room did not go
beyond the barest necessities, and when Thorndyke opened the door
of communication and looked into the bedroom, it was seen to be
characterized by a like austere simplicity. Whatever might be the
moral short-comings of the vanished tenant, softness or effeminate
luxuriousness did not appear to be among them.</p>

<p>As his assistant refixed the 'extractor', Thorndyke stood
thoughtfully surveying the room, trying to assess the personality
of its late occupant by the light of his belongings. And those
belongings and the room which held them were highly characteristic.
The late tenant was clearly an active man, a man whose interests
lay out-of-doors; an orderly man, too, with something of a sailor's
tidiness. He had the sailor's knack of keeping the floor clear by
slinging things aloft out of the way. Not only small articles such
as rules, dividers, marlinspike, and sheath-knife, but a gun-case,
fishing-rods, cricket-bats, and a bulky roll of charts were
disposed of on the walls by means of picture-hooks and
properly-made slings&mdash;the height of which gave a clue to the
occupant's stature and length of arm. And the nautical flavour was
accentuated by the contents of a set of rough shelves in a recess,
which included a boat compass, a nautical almanack, a volume of
sailing directions, and a manual of naval architecture. The only
touch of ornament was given by a set of four photographs in silver
frames, which occupied the mantelpiece in company with a pipe-rack,
a tobacco-jar, an ash-bowl, and a box of matches.</p>

<p>Thorndyke stepped across to the fireplace to look at them more
closely. They were portraits of five persons: a grave-looking,
elderly clergyman; a woman of about the same age with a strong,
alert, resolute face and markedly aquiline features; and a younger
woman, recognizably like the clergyman; and two boys of about seven
and eight, photographed together.</p>

<p>"Those," said Mr. Wampole, indicating the older persons, "are
Mr. Osmond's parents, both, I regret to say, deceased. The younger
lady is Mrs. Hepburn, Mr. Osmond's sister, and those little boys
are her sons. Mr. Osmond was very devoted to them, as I believe
they were to him."</p>

<p>Thorndyke nodded. "They are fine little fellows," he remarked.
"Indeed it is a good-looking family. I gather from your description
that Mr. Osmond must have taken rather strongly after his
mother."</p>

<p>"You are quite right, sir," replied Mr. Wampole. "From that
portrait of his mother you would recognize Mr. Osmond without the
slightest difficulty. The likeness is quite remarkable."</p>

<p>Thorndyke nodded again as he considered long and earnestly the
striking face that looked out of the frame so keenly under its
bold, straight brows. Strength, courage, determination, were
written in every line of it; and as he stood with his eyes bent
upon those of the portrait and thought of this woman's son&mdash;of
the mean, avaricious crime, so slyly and craftily carried out, of
the hasty, pusillanimous flight, unjustified by any hint of
danger&mdash;he was sensible of a discrepancy between personality
and conduct to which his experience furnished no parallel. A vast
amount of nonsense has been talked and believed on the subject of
physiognomy; but within this body of error there lies a soul of
truth. 'Character reading' in the Lavater manner is largely pure
quackery; but there is a certain general congruity between a man's
essential character and his bodily 'make-up', including his facial
type. Here, however, was a profound incongruity. Thorndyke found it
difficult to identify the sly, cowardly knave whom he was seeking
with the actual man who appeared to be coming into view.</p>

<p>But his doubts did not affect his actions. He had come here to
collect evidence; and that purpose he proceeded to execute with a
perfectly open mind. He pointed out to Polton the most likely spots
to work for characteristic dust; he examined minutely every piece
of furniture and woodwork in both the rooms; he made careful notes
of every fact observed by himself or communicated by Wampole that
could throw any light on the habits or occupations of the absent
man. Even the secretly-amused onlooker was impressed by the
thoroughness of the investigation, for, as Polton finally packed
his apparatus, he remarked: "Well, sir, I have told you what I
think&mdash;that you are following a will-o'-the-wisp. But if you
fail to run him to earth, it certainly won't be for lack of
painstaking effort. You deserve to succeed."</p>

<p>Thorndyke thanked him for the compliment and retired slowly down
the stairs while the rooms were being locked up. They called in at
the office to collect Thorndyke's green canvas-covered case and
then made their adieux.</p>

<p>"I must thank you most warmly, Mr. Wampole," said Thorndyke,
"for the kind interest that you have taken in our investigations.
You have given us every possible help."</p>

<p>Mr. Wampole bowed. "It is very good of you to say so. But it has
really been a great pleasure and a most novel and interesting
experience." He held the door open for them to pass out, and as
they were crossing the threshold he added: "You won't forget about
that button-wallet, sir, if the opportunity should arrive."</p>

<p>"I certainly will not," was the reply. "I will secure an
option&mdash;or better still, the wallet itself and send it to you.
By the way, should it be sent here or to your private address?"</p>

<p>Mr. Wampole reflected for a few moments. Then he drew from his
pocket a much-worn letter-case from which he extracted a printed
visiting-card.</p>

<p>"I think, sir, it would be best to send it to my private
address. One doesn't want it opened by the wrong hands. This is my
address; and let me thank you in advance, even if only for the kind
intention. Good evening, sir. Good evening, Mr. Polton. I trust
that your little dusty souvenirs will prove highly
illuminating."</p>

<p>He stood on the threshold and gravely watched his two visitors
as they retired down the street. At length, when they turned a
corner, he re-entered, shutting and locking the outer door. Then in
an instant his gravity relaxed, and flinging himself into a chair,
he roused the echoes with peal after peal of joyous laughter.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a>XVI. &mdash; WHICH TREATS OF LAW
AND BUTTONS</h2>

<p class="first">"THIS seems highly irregular," said Mr. Penfield,
settling himself comfortably in the easy-chair and smilingly
regarding a small table on which were a decanter and glasses. "I
don't treat my professional visitors in this hospitable fashion.
And you don't even ask what has brought me here."</p>

<p>"No," replied Thorndyke, as he filled a couple of glasses; "I
accept the gifts of Fortune and ask no questions."</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield bowed. "You were good enough to say that I might
call out of business hours, which is a great convenience, so here I
am, with a twofold purpose; first, to seek information from you;
and second to give you certain news of my own. Perhaps I may take
them in that order and begin by asking one or two questions?"</p>

<p>"Do so, by all means," replied Thorndyke.</p>

<p>"I have heard," pursued Mr. Penfield, "from our friends Hollis
and Woodstock, and perhaps you will not be surprised to learn that
you have made yourself somewhat unpopular with them. They have even
applied disrespectful epithets to you."</p>

<p>"Such as mountebank, impostor, quack, and so forth," suggested
Thorndyke.</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield chuckled as he sipped his wine. "Your insight is
remarkable," said he. "You have quoted the very words. They
complain that, after making a serious appointment with them and
occupying their time, you merely asked a number of foolish and
irrelevant questions, and then proceeded to sweep the floor. Is
that an exaggeration, or did you really sweep the floor?"</p>

<p>"I collected a few samples of dust from the floor and
elsewhere."</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield consumed a luxurious pinch of snuff and regarded
Thorndyke with delighted amusement.</p>

<p>"Did you indeed? Well, I am not surprised at their attitude. But
a year or so ago it would have been my own. It must have looked
like sheer wizardry. But tell me, have your investigations and
floor-sweepings yielded any tangible facts?</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke, "they have; and those facts I will lay
before you on the strict understanding that you communicate them to
nobody. As to certain further inferences of a more speculative
character, I should prefer to make no statement at present. They
may be entirely erroneous."</p>

<p>"Exactly, exactly. Let us keep scrupulously to definite facts
which are susceptible of proof. Now, what have you discovered?"</p>

<p>"My positive results amount to this: in the first place I have
ascertained beyond the possibility of any reasonable doubt that
those boxes had been opened by some person other than Mr. Hollis.
In the second place it is virtually certain that the person who
opened them was in some way connected with Mr. Woodstock's
office."</p>

<p>"Do you say that the boxes were actually opened in his
office?</p>

<p>"No. The evidence goes to prove that they were taken from the
office and opened elsewhere."</p>

<p>"But surely they would have been missed from the
strong-room?"</p>

<p>"That, I think was provided for. I infer that only one box was
taken at a time and that its place was filled by a dummy."</p>

<p>"Astonishing!" exclaimed Mr. Penfield. "It seems incredible that
you should have been able to discover this&mdash;or, indeed, that
it should be true. The seals seem to me to offer an insuperable
difficulty."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," replied Thorndyke, "it was the seals that
furnished the evidence. They were manifest forgeries."</p>

<p>"Were they really! The robber had actually had a counterfeit
seal engraved?"</p>

<p>"No. The false seal was not engraved. It was an electrotype made
from one of the wax impressions; a much simpler and easier
proceeding, and one that the robber could carry out himself and so
avoid the danger of employing a seal engraver."</p>

<p>"No doubt it would be the safer plan, and probably you are right
in assuming that he adopted it; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not assuming," said Thorndyke. "There is direct evidence
that the seal used to make the false impressions was an
electrotype."</p>

<p>"Now, what would be the nature of that evidence&mdash;or is it,
perhaps, too technical for an ignorant person like me to
follow?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing very technical about it," replied Thorndyke.
"You know how an electrotype is made? Well, to put it briefly, the
process would be this: one of the wax impressions from a box would
be carefully coated with black lead or some other conducting
material and attached to one of the terminals of an electric
battery; and to the other terminal a piece of copper would be
attached. The black-leaded wax impression and the piece of copper
would be suspended from the wires of the battery, close together
but not touching, in a solution of sulphate of copper. Then, as the
electric current passed, the copper would dissolve in the solution
and a film of metallic copper would become deposited on the
black-leaded wax and would gradually thicken until it became a
solid shell of copper. When this shell was picked off the wax it
would be, in effect, a copper seal which would give impressions on
wax just like the original seal. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. But what is the evidence that this was actually
done?"</p>

<p>"It is really very simple," replied Thorndyke. "Let us consider
what would happen in the two alternative cases. Take first that of
the seal engraver. He has handed to him one or more of the wax
impressions from the boxes and is asked to engrave a seal which
shall be an exact copy of the seal which made the impressions. What
does he do? If the wax impression were absolutely perfect, he would
simply copy it in intaglio. But a seal impression never is perfect
unless it is made with quite extraordinary care. But the wax
impressions on the boxes were just ordinary impressions, hastily
made with no attempt at precision, and almost certainly not a
perfect one among them. The engraver, then, would not rigorously
copy a particular impression, but, eliminating its individual and
accidental imperfections, he would aim at producing a seal which
should be a faithful copy of the original seal, without any
imperfections at all.</p>

<p>"Now take the case of the electrotype. This is a mechanical
reproduction of a particular impression. Whatever accidental marks
or imperfections there may be in that impression will be faithfully
reproduced. In short, an engraved seal would be a copy of the
original seal; an electrotype would be a copy of a particular
impression of that seal."</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield nodded approvingly. "An excellent point and very
clearly argued. But what is its bearing on the case?"</p>

<p>"It is this: since an electrotype seal is a mechanical copy of a
particular wax impression, including any accidental marks or
imperfections in it, it follows that every impression made on wax
with such a seal will exhibit the accidental marks or imperfections
of the original wax impression, in addition to any defects of its
own. So that, if a series of such impressions were examined,
although each would probably have its own distinctive
peculiarities, yet all of them would be found to agree in
displaying the accidental marks or imperfections of the original
impression."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see that," said Mr. Penfield with a slightly
interrogative inflexion.</p>

<p>"Well, that is what I have found in the series of
seal-impressions from Mr. Hollis's boxes. They are of all degrees
of badness, but in every one of the series two particular defects
occur; which, as the series consists of over thirty impressions, is
utterly outside the limits of probability."</p>

<p>"Might those imperfections not have been in the seal itself?</p>

<p>"No. I took, with the most elaborate care, two impressions from
the original seal, and those impressions are, I think, as perfect
as is possible. At any rate, they are free from these, or any other
visible defects. I will show them to you."</p>

<p>He took from a drawer a portfolio and an envelope. From the
latter he produced one of the two impressions that he had made with
Mr. Hollis's seal and from the former a half-plate photograph.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, handing them to Mr. Penfield, "is one of the
seal impressions taken by me, and here is a magnified photograph of
it. You can see that every part of the design is perfectly clear
and distinct and the background quite free from indentations. Keep
that photograph for comparison with these others, which show a
series of thirty-two impressions from the boxes, magnified four
diameters. In every one of them you will find two defects. First
the projecting fore-legs of the left-hand horse are blurred and
faint; second, there is, just in front of the chariot and above the
back of the near horse, a minute pit in the back ground. It is
hardly visible to the naked eye in the wax impressions, but the
photographs show it plainly. It was probably produced by a tiny
bubble of air between the seal and the wax.</p>

<p>"Now, neither of these defects is to be seen in Mr. Hollis's
seal. Either of them might have occurred accidentally in one or two
impressions. But since they both occur in every case, whether the
impressions are relatively good or bad, it is practically certain
that they existed in the matrix or seal with which the impressions
were made. And this conclusion is confirmed by the fact that, in
some cases, the defect in the horse's fore legs is inconsistent
with other defects in the same impression."</p>

<p>"How inconsistent?" Mr. Penfield demanded.</p>

<p>"I mean that the faint impression of the horse's legs is due to
insufficient pressure of the left side of the seal; the seal has
not been put down quite vertically. But here&mdash;in number 23,
for instance&mdash;the impression of the chariot and driver on the
right-hand side is quite faint and shallow. In that case, the
left-hand side of the impression should have been deep and
distinct. But both sides are faint, whereas the middle is
deep."</p>

<p>"Might not the seal have been rocked from side to side?"</p>

<p>"No, that would not explain the appearances; for if the seal
were rocked from side to side, both sides would be deep, though the
middle might be shallow. It is impossible to imagine any kind of
pressure which would give an impression shallow on both sides and
deep in the middle. The only possible explanation is that the
matrix, itself, was shallow on one side."</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield reflected, helping his cogitations with a pinch of
snuff.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed. "Incredible as the thing appears, I think you
have made out your case. But doesn't it strike you as rather odd
that this ingenious rascal should not have taken more care to
secure a good impression from which to make his false seal?"</p>

<p>"I imagine that he had no choice," replied Thorndyke. "On each
box were six seals; three on the paper wrapping, two in the
recesses by the keyhole, and one on the knot of the string. Now, as
the paper had to be preserved, the seals could not be torn or cut
from that. It would be impossible to get them out of the recesses.
There remained only the seals on the knots. These were, of course,
much the least perfect, though the string was little more than
thread and the knots quite small. But they were the only ones that
it was possible to remove, and our friend was lucky to have got as
good an impression as he did."</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield nodded. "Yes," said he, "you have an answer to
every objection. By the way, if the paper had to be preserved so
carefully, how do you suppose he got the parcels open? He would
have had to break the seals."</p>

<p>"I think not. I assume that he melted the seals by holding a hot
iron close to them and then gently opened the packets while the wax
was soft."</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield chuckled. "Yes," he admitted, "it is all very
complete and consistent. And now to go on to the next point. You
say that there is evidence that these boxes were opened by some
person other than Hollis himself; a person connected in some way
with Woodstock's office. Further that they were opened, not in the
office itself, but in some other place to which they had been
taken. I should like to hear that evidence; especially if it should
happen to be connected with those mysterious floor-sweepings."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, it is," Thorndyke replied, with a smile.
"But the floor-sweeping was not the first stage. The investigation
began with Mr. Hollis's boxes, from which I extracted every
particle of dust that I could obtain; and this dust I examined
minutely and exhaustively. The results were unexpectedly
illuminating. For instance, from every one of the untouched boxes I
obtained one or more moustache hairs."</p>

<p>"Really! But isn't that very remarkable?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is. But moustache hairs are shed very freely. If you
look at the dust from a desk used by a man with a moustache, you
will usually see in it quite a number of moustache hairs."</p>

<p>"I have not noticed that," said Mr. Penfield, "having no
moustache myself. And what else did you obtain by your curious
researches?"</p>

<p>"The other result was really very remarkable indeed. From every
one of the boxes I obtained particles&mdash;in some cases only one
or two, in others quite a number&mdash;of the very characteristic
dust which is shed by worm-eaten furniture."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Mr. Penfield. "And you were actually able
to identify it! Astonishing! Now, I suppose&mdash;you must excuse
me," he interpolated with an apologetic smile, "but I am walking in
an enchanted land and am ready to expect and believe in any
marvels&mdash;I suppose you were not able to infer the character of
the piece of furniture?</p>

<p>"Not with anything approaching certainty," replied Thorndyke. "I
formed certain opinions; but they are necessarily speculative, and
we are dealing with evidence."</p>

<p>"Quite so, quite so," said Mr. Penfield. "Let us avoid
speculation. But I now begin to see the inwardness of the
floor-sweeping. You were tracing this mysterious dust to its place
of origin."</p>

<p>"Exactly. And, naturally, I began with Mr. Hollis's
premises&mdash;though the forgery of the seals seemed to put him
outside the field of inquiry."</p>

<p>"Yes; he would hardly have needed to forge his own seal."</p>

<p>"No. But I examined his premises thoroughly, with an entirely
negative result. There was no one on them with a moustache of any
kind; the dust from his floors showed not a particle of the
wood-dust, and I could find no piece of furniture in his house
which could have yielded such dust.</p>

<p>"I then proceeded to Woodstock's office, and there I obtained
abundant samples both of hairs and wood-dust. I found Osmond's
hair-brushes in his desk, and from them obtained a number of
moustache hairs which, on careful comparison, appear to be
identically similar to those found in the boxes."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Mr. Penfield in what sounded like a tone of
disapproval. "And as to the wood-dust?"</p>

<p>"I obtained traces of it from every part of the floor. But it
was very unequally distributed; so unequally as to associate it
quite distinctly with a particular individual. I obtained abundant
traces of it from the floor round that individual's desk, and even
more from the inside of the desk; whereas, from the interiors of
the other desks I recovered hardly a particle."</p>

<p>"You refer to 'a particular individual.' Do you mean John
Osmond?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "Osmond's desk contained no
wood-dust."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Mr. Penfield in what sounded very like a tone of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"As to the individual referred to," said Thorndyke, "I think
that, for the present, it might be better&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly," Mr. Penfield interrupted emphatically, "certainly.
It will be much better to mention no names. After all, it is but a
coincidence, though undoubtedly a striking one. But we must keep an
open mind."</p>

<p>"That is what I feel," said Thorndyke. "It is an impressive
fact, but there is the possibility of some fallacy. Nevertheless it
is the most promising clue that offers, and I shall endeavour to
follow it up."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," Mr. Penfield agreed, warmly. "It indicates a new
line of inquiry adapted to your peculiar gifts, though to me I must
confess it only adds a new complication to this mystery. And I do
really find this a most perplexing case. Perhaps you do not?"</p>

<p>"I do, indeed," replied Thorndyke. "It bristles with
contradictions and inconsistencies. Take the case against Osmond.
On the one hand it is in the highest degree convincing. The
robberies coincide in time with his presence in the office. His
disappearance coincides with the discovery of the robbery; and then
in the rifled boxes we find a number of hairs from his
moustache."</p>

<p>"Can you prove that they are actually his?" Mr. Penfield
asked.</p>

<p>"No," Thorndyke replied. "But I have not the slightest doubt
that they are, and I think they would be accepted by a
jury&mdash;in conjunction with the other circumstances&mdash;as
good evidence. These facts seem to point quite clearly to his
guilt. On the other hand, the wood-dust is not connected with him
at all. None was found in his desk or near it; and when I examined
his rooms&mdash;which by a fortunate chance I was able to
do&mdash;I not only found no trace whatever of wood-dust, but from
the appearance of the place I was convinced that the boxes had not
been opened there. And furthermore, so far as I could ascertain,
the man's personality was singularly out of character with a
subtle, cunning, avaricious crime of this type; not that I would
lay great stress on that point."</p>

<p>"No," agreed Mr. Penfield; "the information is too scanty. But
tell me: you inferred that the boxes were not opened in Woodstock's
office, but were taken away and opened in some other place. How did
you arrive at that?"</p>

<p>"By means of the wood-dust. The place in which those boxes were
opened and refilled must have contained some worm-eaten wooden
object which yielded that very distinctive dust, and yielded it in
large quantities. But there was no such object on Woodstock's
premises. I searched the house from top to bottom and could not
find a single piece of worm-eaten wood work."</p>

<p>"And may I inquire&mdash;mind, I am not asking for
details&mdash;but may I inquire whether you have any idea as to the
whereabouts of that piece of furniture?"</p>

<p>"I have a suspicion," replied Thorndyke. "But there is my
dilemma. I have a strong suspicion as to the place where it might
be found; but, unfortunately, that place is not accessible for
exploration. So, at present, I am unable either to confirm or
disprove my theory."</p>

<p>"But supposing you were able to ascertain definitely that the
piece of furniture is where you believe it to be? What then?"</p>

<p>"In that case," Thorndyke replied, "provided that this
worm-eaten object turned out to be the kind of object that I
believe it to be, I should be disposed to apply for a
search-warrant."</p>

<p>"To search for what?" demanded Mr. Penfield.</p>

<p>"The stolen property&mdash;and certain other things."</p>

<p>"But surely the stolen property has been disposed of long
ago."</p>

<p>"I think," replied Thorndyke, "that there are reasons for
believing that it has not. But I would rather not go into that
question at present."</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Penfield. "We agreed to avoid speculative
questions. And now, as I think I have exhausted your supply of
information, it is my turn to contribute. I have a rather startling
piece of news to communicate. John Osmond is dead."</p>

<p>Thorndyke regarded Mr. Penfield with raised eyebrows. "Have you
heard any particulars?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Woodstock sent me a copy of the police report, of which I will
send you a duplicate if you would like one. Briefly, it amounts to
this: Osmond was traced to Bristol, and it was suspected that he
had embarked on a ship which traded from that port to the west
coast of Africa. That ship was seen, some weeks later, at anchor
off the coast at a considerable distance from her usual
trading-ground, and on her arrival at her station&mdash;a place
called Half-Jack on the Grain Coast&mdash;was boarded by an
inspector of constabulary who had been sent up from the Gold Coast
to make inquiries. To him the captain admitted that he had landed a
passenger from Bristol at a place called Adaffia in the Bight of
Benin. The passenger was a man named Walker whose description
agreed completely with that of Osmond. Thereupon, the inspector
returned to Accra to report; and from thence was sent down to
Adaffia with an armed party to find the man and arrest him.</p>

<p>"But he was too late. He arrived only in time to find a trader
named Larkom setting up a wooden cross over the grave. Walker had
died early that morning or the night before."</p>

<p>"Is it quite clear that this man was really John Osmond?"</p>

<p>"Quite," replied Mr. Penfield. "Larkom had just painted the name
John Osmond on the cross. It appeared that Osmond, when he realized
that he was dying, had disclosed his real name and asked to have it
written above his grave&mdash;naturally enough. One doesn't want to
be buried under an assumed name."</p>

<p>"No," Thorndyke agreed. "The grave is a sufficiently secure
sanctuary. Does the report say what was the cause of death?"</p>

<p>"Yes, though it doesn't seem very material. He is stated to have
died from blackwater fever&mdash;whatever that may be."</p>

<p>"It is a peculiarly malignant type of malaria," Thorndyke
explained; and he added after a pause: "Well, 'the White Man's
Grave' is a pestilential region, but poor Osmond certainly wasted
no time in dying. How does his death affect our inquiry?"</p>

<p>Mr. Penfield took snuff viciously. "Woodstock's view is&mdash;I
can hardly speak of it with patience&mdash;that as the thief is
dead, the inquiry comes automatically to an end."</p>

<p>"And Hollis, I take it, does not agree?"</p>

<p>"Indeed he does not. He wants his property traced and
recovered."</p>

<p>"And do I understand that you instruct me to proceed with my
investigations?</p>

<p>"Most certainly; especially in view of what you have told
me."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that," said Thorndyke. "I dislike exceedingly
leaving an inquiry uncompleted. In fact, I should have completed
the case for my own satisfaction and as a matter of public policy.
For if Osmond stole these gems, the fact ought to be proved lest
any other person should be suspected; and if he did not, his
character ought to be cleared as a matter of common justice."</p>

<p>"That is exactly my own feeling," said Mr. Penfield. "And then,
of course, there is the property. That ought to be recovered if
possible, especially if, as you seem to think, it is still intact.
And now," he added, draining his glass and rising, "it is time for
me to depart. I have to thank you for a most interesting and
pleasant evening."</p>

<p>As Thorndyke stood on the landing looking down upon his
retreating guest, he was dimly aware of a presence on the stair
above; and when he turned to re-enter his chambers, the presence
materialized into the form of Polton. With silent and stealthy
tread the 'familiar spirit' stole down the stairs and followed his
principal into the room, where, having closed both doors with a
secret and portentous air, he advanced to the table.</p>

<p>"What have you got under your arm, Polton?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

<p>By way of reply, Polton regarded his employer with a smile of
the most extraordinary crinkliness and began very deliberately to
untie the string of a small parcel. From the latter he at length
disengaged a kind of leathern wallet marked in gold lettering with
what appeared to be a tradesman's name and address. This he bore,
slowly and ceremoniously, to the table, where with a sudden
movement he unrolled it, displaying a glittering constellation of
metal buttons.</p>

<p>"Well done, Polton!" Thorndyke exclaimed. "What a man you are!
Now, where might you have unearthed this relic?"</p>

<p>"I discovered it, sir," replied Polton, blushing with pleasure
like a dried apricot, "in a little, old-fashioned tailor's
trimming-shop in one of the courts off Carnaby Street. It is quite
a well preserved specimen, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is in wonderful condition, considering its age. Mr.
Wampole will be delighted with it. He will be set up with buttons
for life. I think, Polton, it would add to his pleasure if you were
to run down and make the presentation in person. Don't you?"</p>

<p>Polton's features crinkled to the point of obliteration. "I do,
indeed, sir," he replied. "At his private residence, I think,
sir."</p>

<p>"Certainly; at his private residence. And we shall have to find
out at what time he usually returns from the office."</p>

<p>"We shall, sir," Polton agreed; and thereupon proceeded to
crinkle to a perfectly alarming extent.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a>XVII. &mdash; THE LAPIDARY</h2>

<p class="first">IN a small street hard by Clerkenwell Green is a
small shop of antique and mouldy aspect, the modest window of which
is so obscured by a coat of paint on the inside as to leave the
unaided observer to speculate in vain as to the kind of wares
concealed within. A clue to the mystery is, however, furnished by
an inscription in faded gilt lettering on the fascia above, which
sets forth that the tenant's name is Lambert and that his vocation
is that of a lapidary and dealer in precious stones.</p>

<p>On a certain afternoon a few days after his interview with Mr.
Penfield, Dr. John Thorndyke might have been seen to turn into the
small street with a brisk, decisive air suggestive of familiarity
with the neighbourhood and a definite purpose; and the latter
suggestion would have been confirmed when, having arrived at the
shop, he pushed open the door and entered. A faded, elderly man
confronted him across the counter and inquired what might be his
pleasure.</p>

<p>"I have called," said Thorndyke, "to make some inquiries
concerning artificial stones."</p>

<p>"Did you want them for theatrical purposes?"</p>

<p>"No. Those are usually cast or moulded, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes. Not as a rule. Can't get much sparkle out of moulded
glass, you know. But what was the class of goods you were
wanting?"</p>

<p>"I wanted a set of imitation gems made to given shapes and
dimensions to form a collection such as might be suitable for
purposes of instruction in a technical school."</p>

<p>"Would the shapes and dimensions have to be exact?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite exact. They are intended to be copies of existing
specimens and the settings are already made."</p>

<p>Thorndyke's answer seemed to occasion some surprise, for the man
to whom he made it reflected profoundly for a few moments and then
looked round at a younger man who was sorting samples from the
stock at a side-bench.</p>

<p>"Odd, isn't it, Fred?" said the former.</p>

<p>"What is odd?" inquired Thorndyke.</p>

<p>"Why, you see, sir, we had someone come in only a few days ago
making the very same inquiry. You remember him, Fred?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember him, Mr. Lambert. Crinkly-faced little
blighter."</p>

<p>"That's the man," said Mr. Lambert. "I rather wondered at the
time what his game was. Seemed to know a lot about the trade, too;
but you have to mind what you are about making strass
facsimiles."</p>

<p>"Of course you have," Thorndyke agreed, "especially when you are
dealing with these crinkly-faced people."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Mr. Lambert, "But, of course, sir, in your case
we know where we are."</p>

<p>"It is very good of you to say so," rejoined Thorndyke. "But I
gather that you are not often asked to make sets of facsimile
imitations."</p>

<p>"No, not sets. Occasionally we get an order from a jeweller to
duplicate the stones of a diamond necklace or tiara to be used
while the original is in pawn, or for safety in a crowd. But not a
collection such as you are speaking of. In fact, during all the
thirty-five years that I have been in business, I have only had one
order of the kind. That was between four and five years ago. A
gentleman named Scofield wanted a set to offer to some local
museum, and he wanted them to be copies of stones in various public
collections. He got the shapes and dimensions from the
catalogues&mdash;so I understood."</p>

<p>"Did you execute the order?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and quite a big order it was."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Thorndyke, "whether he happened to have
selected any of the stones that are in my list. Mine are mostly
from the Hollis collection. But I suppose you don't keep records of
the work you do?"</p>

<p>"I expect all the particulars are in the order book. We can soon
see."</p>

<p>He went over to a shelf on which was ranged a row of books of
all ages, and running his hand along, presently drew out a leather
volume which he laid on the counter and opened.</p>

<p>"Ah! Here we are," said he, after a brief search. "Mr. Scofield.
Perhaps you would like to glance over his list. You see there are
quite a lot of them."</p>

<p>He pushed the book across to Thorndyke, who had already produced
a note-book from his pocket, the entries in which he now proceeded
to compare with those in Mr. Scofield's list. Mr. Lambert watched
him with close interest as he placed his finger on one after
another of the entries in the book, and presently remarked:</p>

<p>"You seem to be finding some duplicates of your own lot."</p>

<p>"It is most remarkable," said Thorndyke "&mdash;and yet perhaps
it isn't&mdash;but his selection coincides with mine in over a
dozen instances. May I tick them off with a pencil?"</p>

<p>"Do, by all means," said Lambert. "Then I can copy them out
afterwards&mdash;that is, if you want me to get the duplicates
cut."</p>

<p>"I do, certainly. I will mark off those that I want, and, when
you have cut those, I will give you a further list. And I may add
that I should like you to use the best-quality strass that you can
get. I want them to be as much like real stones as possible."</p>

<p>"I should do that in any case for good cut work," said Lambert;
and he added: "I suppose there is no special hurry for these
stones?</p>

<p>"None at all," replied Thorndyke. "If you will send me a card to
this address when they are ready, I will call for them. Or,
perhaps, if I pay for them now you could send them to me."</p>

<p>The latter alternative was adopted, and while the prices were
being reckoned up and the bill was being made out, Thorndyke
occupied himself in making, in shorthand, a copy of the list in the
order book. He had finished and put away his note-book by the time
the account was ready; when, having laid a visiting-card on the
counter, he paid his score and began to put on his gloves.</p>

<p>"By the way," said he, "your customer would not happen to be Mr.
Scofield of the Middle Temple, I suppose?</p>

<p>"I really couldn't say, sir," replied Lambert. "He never gave
any address. But I had an idea that he came up from the country. He
used to give his orders and then he would call, at longish
intervals, and take away as many of the stones as were ready. He
was a middle-aged man, a bit on the shady side; tallish,
clean-shaved, iron-grey hair, and not too much of it."</p>

<p>"Ah, then I don't think that would be the same Mr. Scofield. It
is not a very uncommon name. Good-afternoon."</p>

<p>With this Thorndyke took up his stick and, emerging from the
shop, set a course southward for the Temple, walking quickly, as
was his wont, with a long, swinging stride, and turning over in his
mind the bearings of what he had just learned. In reality he had
not learned much. Still, he had added one or two small items to his
stock of facts, and in circumstantial evidence every added fact
gives additional weight to all the others. He sorted out his new
acquirements and considered each in turn.</p>

<p>In the first place, it was clear that Mr. Scofield's collection
was a facsimile of the missing part of Hollis's. The list in
Lambert's book was identical with the one in his own pocket-book;
which, in its turn, was a list of the forgeries. The discovery of
the maker of the forgeries (a result of extensive preliminary
scouting on the part of Polton) was of little importance at the
moment, though it might be of great value in the future. For, since
the forgeries existed, it was obvious that someone must have made
them. Much more to the point was the identity of the person for
whom they were made. Whoever 'Mr. Scofield' might have been, he
certainly was not John Osmond. And this set Thorndyke once more
puzzling over the really perplexing feature of this curious case.
Why had Osmond absconded? That he had really done so, Thorndyke had
no doubt, though he would have challenged the use of the word by
anyone else. But why? There had been nothing to implicate him in
any way. Beyond the hairs in the boxes&mdash;of which he could not
have known and which were not at all conclusive&mdash;there was
nothing to implicate him now but his own flight. All the other
evidence seemed to point away from him. Yet he had absconded.</p>

<p>Thorndyke put to himself the various possibilities and argued
them one at a time. There were three imaginable hypotheses. First,
that Osmond had committed the robbery alone and unassisted; second,
that he had been an accessory or worked with a confederate; third,
that he had had no connection with the robbery at all.</p>

<p>The first hypothesis could be excluded at once, for Mr. Scofield
must have been, at least, an accessory; and Mr. Scofield was not
John Osmond. The second was much more plausible. It not only agreed
with the known facts, but might even furnish some sort of
explanation of the flight. Thus, supposing Osmond to have planned
and executed the robbery with the aid of a confederate in the
expectation that, even if discovered, it would never be traced to
the office, might it not have been that, when, unexpectedly, it was
so traced, Osmond had decided to take the onus on himself, and by
absconding, divert suspicion from his accomplice? The thing was
quite conceivable. It was entirely in agreement with Osmond's
character as pictured by Mr. Wampole; that of a rash, impulsive,
rather unreasonable man. And if it were further assumed that there
had been known to him some incriminating fact which he had expected
to leak out, but which had not leaked out, then the whole set of
facts, including the flight, would appear fairly consistent.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, consistent as the explanation might be, Thorndyke
did not find it convincing. The aspect of Osmond's rooms, with
their suggestion of hardy simplicity and a robust asceticism, still
lingered in his memory. Nor had he forgotten the impressive face of
the gentlewoman whose portrait he had looked on with such deep
interest in those rooms. These were, perhaps, but mere impressions,
of no evidential weight; but yet they refused to be lightly
dismissed.</p>

<p>As to the third hypothesis, that Osmond had not been concerned
in the robbery at all, it would have been quite acceptable but for
the irreconcilable fact of the flight. That seemed, beyond any
question, to connect him with the crime. Of course it was
conceivable that he might have some other reason for his flight.
But no such reason had been suggested; whereas the circumstances in
which he had elected to disappear&mdash;at the exact moment when
the crime had been traced to the office&mdash;made it idle to look
for any other explanation. And so, once more, Thorndyke found
himself involved in a tangle of contradictions from which he could
see no means of escape.</p>

<p>The end of his train of thought coincided with his arrival at
the entry to his chambers. Ascending the stairs, he became aware of
a light above as from an open door; and a turn of the staircase
showed him that door&mdash;his own&mdash;framing a small, restless
figure.</p>

<p>"Why, Polton," he exclaimed, "you are early, aren't you? I
didn't expect you for another hour or two."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Polton, "I got away early. But I've seen it,
sir. And you were perfectly right&mdash;absolutely right. It is a
sparrowhawk, stuck in a little log of cherry wood. Exactly as you
said."</p>

<p>"I didn't say a sparrowhawk," Thorndyke objected.</p>

<p>"You said, sir, that it was a stake or a bec iron or some kind
of small anvil, and a sparrowhawk is a kind of small anvil."</p>

<p>"Very well, Polton," Thorndyke conceded. "But tell me how you
managed it and why you are home so early."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, you see," Polton explained, fidgeting about the room
as if he were afflicted with St. Vitus's dance, "it came off much
easier than I had expected. I got to his house a good hour too
soon. His house keeper opened the door and wanted me to call again.
But I said I had come down from London and would like to wait. And
then I told her about the buttons and explained how valuable they
were and asked her if she would like to see them; and she said she
would. So she took me upstairs to his sitting-room and there I
undid the parcel and showed her the buttons.</p>

<p>"Then I got talking to her about the rooms; remarked what a nice
place Mr. Wampole had got and how beautifully it was kept."</p>

<p>"Really, Polton!" Thorndyke chuckled, "I had no idea you were
such a humbug."</p>

<p>"No more had I, sir," replied Polton, with a complacent crinkle.
"But, you see, it was a case of necessity; and besides, the room
was wonderfully neat and tidy. Well, I got her talking about the
house, and very proud she seemed to be of it. So I asked her all
the questions I could think of: whether she had a good kitchen and
whether there was pipe water or a pump in the scullery, and so on.
And she got so interested and pleased with herself that presently
she offered to let me see over the house if I liked, and of course,
I said that there was nothing in the world that I should like
better. So she took me down and showed me the kitchen and the
scullery and her own little sitting-room and a couple of big
cupboards for linen and stores, and it was all as neat and clean as
a new pin. Then we went upstairs again, and as we passed a door on
the landing she said, 'That's a little room that Mr. Wampole does
his tinkering in.'</p>

<p>"'Ah!' says I, 'but I'll warrant that room isn't quite so neat
and tidy. I do a bit of tinkering myself and I know what a workroom
looks like.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, it isn't so bad,' says she. 'Mr. Wampole is a very orderly
man. You shall see for yourself, if it isn't locked. He usually
locks it when he has a job in hand.'</p>

<p>"Well, it wasn't locked; so she opened the door and in we went;
and the very moment I put my head inside, I saw it&mdash;on the
table that he used for a bench. It was set in a little upright log,
such as you get from the trimmings of fruit trees. And, my word! it
was fairly riddled.&mdash;like a sponge&mdash;and where it stood on
the bench there was a regular ring of powder round it.</p>

<p>"'That's a rare old block that his anvil is set in,' says I,
going across to look at it.</p>

<p>"'Not so old as you'd think,' says she. 'He got it about five
years ago, when we had the cherry tree lopped. You can see the tree
in the garden from this window.'</p>

<p>"She went over to the window and I followed her; and as I passed
the bench I picked up a pinch of the dust between my finger and
thumb and put my hand in my pocket, where I had a pill-box that I
had brought in case I should get a chance to collect a sample. As
we were looking out of the window, I managed to work the lid off
the pill-box and drop the pinch of dust in and slip the lid on
again. Then I was happy; and as I had done all that I came to do, I
thought I would rather like to clear off."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Polton in a slightly apologetic tone, "the
fact is that I wasn't very anxious to meet Mr. Wampole. It wouldn't
have been quite pleasant, under the circumstances, to present those
buttons and have him thanking me and shaking my hand. I should have
felt rather like Pontius Pilate."</p>

<p>"Why Pontius Pilate?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

<p>"Wasn't he the chap&mdash;or was it Judas Iscariot? At any rate,
I had a sudden feeling that I didn't want to hand him those
buttons. So I looked up my time table and discovered that I
couldn't wait to see him. 'But, however,' I said, 'it doesn't
matter. I can leave the buttons with you to give him; and I will
leave my card, too, so that he can send me a line if he wants to.'
So with that I gave her the roll of buttons and nipped off to the
station, just in time to catch the earlier train to town. I hope I
didn't do wrong, sir."</p>

<p>"Not at all," Thorndyke replied heartily. "I quite understand
your feeling on the matter; in fact, I think I should have done the
same. Shall we look at that pill-box? I didn't expect such good
fortune as to get a specimen."</p>

<p>Polton produced the little box, and having opened it to make
sure that the contents were intact, handed it to Thorndyke, who
forthwith made a preliminary inspection of the dust with the aid of
his lens.</p>

<p>"Yes," he reported, "it is evidently the same dust as was in the
other samples, so that aspect of the case is complete. I must
compliment you, Polton, on the masterly way in which you carried
out your really difficult and delicate mission. You have made a
brilliant success of it. And you have been equally successful in
another direction. I have just come from Lambert's, where I had a
very instructive interview. You were perfectly correct. It was
Lambert who cut those dummy stones."</p>

<p>"I felt sure it must be," said Polton, "when I had been round to
those other lapidaries. He seems to be the only one who specializes
in cutting strass gems. But did you find out who the customer was,
sir?"</p>

<p>"I found out who he was not," replied Thorndyke, "and that was
as far as it seemed wise to go. The rest of the inquiry&mdash;the
actual identification&mdash;will be better carried out by the
police. I think, if we give Mr. Lambert's address, with certain
other particulars, to Mr. Superintendent Miller, we can safely
leave him to do what is necessary."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-18" id="ch-18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE END OF THE
CLUE</h2>

<p class="first">IT was nearing the hour of six in the evening when
five men made their appearance on the stretch of pavement on which
Mr. Woodstock's office door opened. They did not, however, arrive
in a solid body, but in two groups&mdash;of two and three,
respectively&mdash;which held no mutual communication, but kept
within easy distance of one another. The larger group consisted of
Dr. Thorndyke, Mr. Lambert, the lapidary, and a tall, powerful man
of distinctly military appearance and bearing; the smaller group
consisted of a uniformed inspector of the local police and Mr.
Lambert's assistant "Fred."</p>

<p>"I hope our friends are punctual in coming out," Thorndyke
remarked as he stood with his two companions ostensibly inspecting
the stock in a bookseller's window. "If we have to wait about long,
we are likely to attract notice. Even a bookseller's window won't
explain our presence indefinitely."</p>

<p>"No," the tall man agreed. "But there is a good deal of traffic
in this street to cover us up and prevent us from being too
conspicuous. All I hope is that he will take things
quietly&mdash;that is, if he is the right man. You are sure you
would know him again, Mr. Lambert?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly sure, Superintendent," was the confident reply. "I
remember him quite well. I have a good memory for faces, and so has
my man, Fred. But I tell you frankly that neither of us relishes
this job."</p>

<p>"I sympathize with you, Mr. Lambert," said Thorndyke. "I don't
relish it myself. We are both martyrs to duty. Ah! Here is somebody
coming out. That is Mr. Woodstock. I mustn't let him see me."</p>

<p>He turned to the shop-window, presenting his back to the street,
and the solicitor walked quickly past without noticing him. A few
moments later Mr. Hepburn emerged and walked away in the opposite
direction, furtively observed by Fred, who, with his companion,
occupied a position on the farther side of the office door. He was
followed after a short interval by two young men, apparently
clerks, who walked away together up the street and were narrowly
inspected by Fred as they passed. Close on their heels came an
older man, who emerged with an air of business and, turning towards
the three watchers, approached at a brisk walk.</p>

<p>"That the man, Mr. Lambert?" the superintendent asked in a low,
eager tone, as the new-comer drew near.</p>

<p>"No," was the reply. "Not a bit like him."</p>

<p>Two more men came out, at both of whom Mr. Lambert shook his
head. Then came a youth of about eighteen, and after his emergence
an interval of several minutes, during which no one else
appeared.</p>

<p>"That can't be the lot," said the superintendent, with a glance
of anxious inquiry at Thorndyke.</p>

<p>"It isn't unless some of them are absent," the latter replied.
"That would be rather a disaster."</p>

<p>"It would, indeed," the superintendent replied. "What do you
say, Doctor, to going in&mdash;that is, if the door isn't
locked?</p>

<p>"Not yet, Miller," Thorndyke replied. "Of course we can't wait
indefinitely, but, if possible&mdash;Ah! here is someone else."</p>

<p>As he spoke, an elderly man came out and stood for a few moments
looking up and down the street. Then he turned and very
deliberately locked the door behind him.</p>

<p>"That's the man!" Lambert exclaimed. "That is Mr. Scofield."</p>

<p>"You are quite sure?" demanded Miller.</p>

<p>"Positive," was the reply. "I recognized him instantly"; and in
confirmation, Fred was signalling with a succession of emphatic
nods.</p>

<p>Superintendent Miller cast an interrogative glance at Thorndyke.
"Your man, too?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "Mr. Wampole."</p>

<p>The unconscious subject of these observations, having locked the
door, slowly pocketed the key and began to walk at a leisurely pace
and with a thoughtful air towards the three observers, closely
followed by Fred and the inspector. Suddenly he became aware of
Thorndyke; and the beginnings of a smile of recognition had
appeared on his face when he caught sight of Mr. Lambert.
Instantly, the smile froze; and as Superintendent Miller bore down
on him with evident purpose, he halted irresolutely and cast a
quick glance behind him. At the sight of Fred&mdash;whom he
evidently recognized at once&mdash;and the inspector, his
bewilderment changed to sheer panic, and he darted out into the
road close behind a large covered van that was drawn up at the
kerb.</p>

<p>"Look out!" roared Miller, as Wampole passed the rear of the
van; but the only effect of the warning was to cause the fugitive
to cast a terrified glance backward over his shoulder as he ran.
And then, in an instant, came the catastrophe. An empty lorry was
coming up the street at a brisk trot, but its approach had been
hidden from Wampole by the van. As the unfortunate man ran out from
behind the latter, still looking back, he charged straight in front
of the horses. The driver uttered a yell of dismay and tugged at
the reins; but the affair was over in a moment. The pole of the
lorry struck Wampole at the side of the neck with the force of a
battering-ram and flung him violently down on the road, where he
lay motionless as the ponderous vehicle swerved past within an inch
of his head.</p>

<p>A number of bystanders immediately gathered round, and the
carman, having pulled up the lorry, climbed down from his high
perch and came hurrying, white-faced and breathless, across the
road. Through the gathering crowd the inspector made his way and
piloted Thorndyke to the fatal spot.</p>

<p>"Looks a pretty bad case, sir," said he, casting a perturbed eye
down at the motionless form, which lay where it had fallen. "Will
you just have a glance at him?"</p>

<p>Thorndyke stooped over the prostrate figure and made a
brief&mdash;a very brief&mdash;inspection. Then he stood up and
announced curtly: "He is dead. The blow dislocated his neck."</p>

<p>"Ha!" the inspector exclaimed, "I was afraid he was&mdash;though
perhaps it is all for the best. At any rate, we've done with him
now."</p>

<p>"I haven't," said Miller. "I've got a search warrant; and I
shall want his keys. We will come along with you to the mortuary.
Can't very well get them here."</p>

<p>At this moment the carman presented himself, wiping his pale
face with a large red handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Shockin' affair, this, Inspector," he said, huskily. "Pore old
chap. I couldn't do no more than what I done. You could see that
for yourself. He was down almost as soon as I see 'im."</p>

<p>"Yes," the inspector agreed, "he ran straight at the pole. It
was no fault of yours. At least, that's my opinion," he added with
official caution. "Just help me and the constable here to lift the
body on to your lorry and then he will show you the way to the
mortuary. You understand, Borman," he continued, addressing the
constable. "You are to take the body to the mortuary, and wait
there with the lorry until I come. I shall be there in a minute or
two."</p>

<p>The constable saluted, and the inspector, having made a note of
the carman's name and address, stood by while the ghastly passenger
was lifted up on to the rough floor. Then, as the lorry moved off,
he turned to Miller and remarked: "Your friend Mr. Lambert looks
rather poorly, Superintendent. It has been a bit of a shock for
him. Hadn't you better take him somewhere and give him a little
pick-me-up? We shall want him and his assistant at the mortuary,
you know, for a regular identification."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Miller, glancing sympathetically at the
white-faced, shaking lapidary, "he does look pretty bad, poor old
chap. Thinks it's all his doing, I expect. Well, you show us the
way to a suitable place."</p>

<p>"The Blue Lion Hotel is just round the corner," said the
inspector, "and it is on our way."</p>

<p>To the Blue Lion he accordingly led the way, while Thorndyke
followed, assisting and trying to comfort the shaken and
self-reproachful Lambert. From the hotel they proceeded to the
mortuary, where Lambert having, almost with tears, identified the
body of 'Mr. Scofield', and the dead man's keys having been handed
to Superintendent Miller, the latter departed with Thorndyke,
leaving the inspector to conduct the carman to the
police-station.</p>

<p>"You seem to be pretty confident," said Miller as they set
forth, guided by Polton's written directions, "that the stuff is
still there."</p>

<p>"Not confident, Miller," was the reply, "but I think it is
there. At any rate, it is worth while to make the search. There may
be other things to see besides the stones."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Miller agreed doubtfully. "Well, I hope you are
right."</p>

<p>They walked on for some five minutes when Thorndyke, having
again referred to his notes, halted before a pleasant little house
in a quiet street on the outskirts of the town, and entering the
front garden, knocked at the door. It was opened by a
motherly-looking, middle-aged woman to whom Miller briefly but
courteously explained his business and exhibited his warrant.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" she exclaimed. "What on earth makes you think
the missing property is here?"</p>

<p>"I can't go into particulars," replied Miller. "Here is the
search-warrant."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see. But couldn't you wait until Mr. Wampole comes home?
He is due now, and his tea is waiting for him in his
sitting-room."</p>

<p>Miller cleared his throat. Then, hesitatingly and with manifest
discomfort, he broke the dreadful news.</p>

<p>The poor woman was thunderstruck. For a few moments she seemed
unable to grasp the significance of what Miller was telling her;
then, when the horrid reality burst upon her, she turned away
quickly, flinging out her hand towards the staircase, ran into her
room, and shut the door.</p>

<p>The two investigators ascended the stairs in silence with an
unconsciously stealthy tread. On the landing they paused, and as he
softly opened the three doors and peered into the respective
apartments, Miller remarked in an undertone: "Rather gruesome,
Doctor, isn't it? I feel like a tomb-robber. Which one shall we go
in first?"</p>

<p>"This one on the left seems to be the workshop," replied
Thorndyke. "Perhaps we had better take that first, though it isn't
likely that the gems are in there."</p>

<p>They entered the workshop, and Thorndyke looked about it with
keen interest. On a small table, fitted with a metal-worker's
bench-vice, stood the "sparrow-hawk," like a diminutive smith's
anvil, in its worm-eaten block, surrounded by a ring of
pinkish-yellow dust. A Windsor chair, polished by years of use, was
evidently the one on which the workman had been accustomed to sit
at his bench; and close inspection showed a powdering of the pink
dust on the rails and other protected parts. On the right-hand side
of the room was a small woodworker's bench, and on the wall above
it a rack filled with chisels and other small tools. There was a
tool cabinet ingeniously made from grocer's boxes, and a set of
shelves on which the glue-pot and various jars and small appliances
were stowed out of the way.</p>

<p>"Seems to have been a pretty handy man," remarked Miller,
pulling out one of the drawers of the cabinet and disclosing a set
of files.</p>

<p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed; "he appears to have been quite a good
workman. It is all very neat and orderly. This is rather
interesting," he added, reaching down from the shelf a box
containing two earthen ware cells filled with a blue liquid, and a
wide jar with similar contents.</p>

<p>"Electric battery, isn't it?" said Miller. "What is the point of
interest about it?"</p>

<p>"It is a two-cell Daniell's battery," replied Thorndyke, "the
form of battery most commonly used for making small electrotypes.
And in evidence that it was used for that purpose, here is the jar
filled with copper sulphate solution, forming the tank, with the
copper electrode in position. Moreover, I see on the shelf what
look like some gutta-percha moulds." He reached one down and
examined it. "Yes," he continued, "this is a squeeze from a coin.
Apparently he had been making electrotype copies of coins; probably
some that had been lent to him."</p>

<p>"Well," said Miller, "what about it?"</p>

<p>"The point is that whoever stole those gems made an electrotype
copy of Hollis's seal. We now have evidence that Wampole was able
to make electrotypes and did actually make them."</p>

<p>"It would be more to the point if we could find the gems
themselves," rejoined Miller.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is undoubtedly true," Thorndyke admitted; "and as we
are not likely to find them here, perhaps we had better examine the
sitting-room. That is much the most probable place."</p>

<p>"I don't quite see why," said Miller. "But I expect you do," and
with this he followed Thorndyke across the landing to the adjoining
room.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he exclaimed, stopping to gaze at the
neatly-arranged tea-service on the table, "just look at this!
Uncanny, isn't it? Teapot under the cosy&mdash;quite hot still. And
what's under this cover? Crumpets, by gum! And him lying there in
the mortuary! Fairly gives one the creeps. Don't you feel a bit
like a ghoul, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"I might, perhaps," Thorndyke replied, dryly, "if there had been
no such person as John Osmond."</p>

<p>"True," said Miller. "He did do the dirty on Osmond, and that's
the fact&mdash;unless Osmond was in it, too. Looks rather as if he
was; but you don't seem to think so."</p>

<p>"As a mere guess, I do not; but it is a puzzling case in some
respects."</p>

<p>He stood for a while looking about the room, letting his eye
travel slowly along the papered walls as if in search of a possible
hiding-place. From the general survey he proceeded to the
consideration of details, turning the door-key&mdash;which was on
the inside and turned smoothly and silently&mdash;and examining and
trying a solid-looking brass bolt.</p>

<p>"You notice, Miller," he said, "that he seems to have been in
the habit of locking and bolting himself in; and that the bolt has
been fixed on comparatively recently. That is somewhat
significant."</p>

<p>"It seems to suggests that the swag was hidden here at one time,
if it isn't here now. I suppose we may as well look through these
cabinets, just as a matter of form, for he won't have hidden the
stuff in them."</p>

<p>He produced the dead man's bunch of keys, and having unlocked
the hinged batten which secured the drawers of one, pulled out the
top drawer.</p>

<p>"Coins," he announced; "silver coins. No! By jingo, they're
copper, plated, and no backs to them. Just look at that!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, taking the specimen from him, "a
silver-faced copper electro, taken, no doubt, from a borrowed coin.
Not a bad way of forming a collection. Probably, if he had been
skilful enough to join the two faces and make a complete coin, it
would have been the original owner who would have had the
electrotype, and Wampole would have kept the genuine coin. While
you are going through the cabinets, I think I will explore those
two cupboards. They seem to me to have possibilities."</p>

<p>The cupboards in question filled the recesses on either side of
the fireplace. Each cupboard was built in two stages&mdash;a lower
about three feet in height, and an upper extending nearly to the
ceiling. Thorndyke began with the right-hand one, throwing open
both its pairs of folding doors, after unlocking them with the
keys, handed to him by Miller. Then he cleared the shelves of their
contents&mdash;principally stamp albums and back numbers of The
Connoisseur&mdash;until the cupboard was completely empty, when he
proceeded to a systematic survey of the interior, rapping with his
knuckles on every part of the back and sides and testing each shelf
by a vigorous pull. Standing on a chair, he inspected the top and
ascertained, by feeling it simultaneously from above and below,
that it consisted of only a single board.</p>

<p>Having thoroughly explored the upper stage with no result, he
next attacked the lower story, rapping at the back, sides, and
floor and pulling at the solitary shelf, which was as immovable as
the others. Then he tested the ceiling or top by feeling it with
one hand while the other was placed on the floor of the upper
story.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Miller, who had been systematically examining the row
of home-made cabinets, shut the last of the multitudinous drawers
and stood up.</p>

<p>"Well," he announced, "I've been right through the lot, Doctor,
and there's nothing in any of them&mdash;nothing, I mean, but
trash. This last one is full of buttons&mdash;brass buttons, if
you'll believe it. How are you getting on? Had any luck?"</p>

<p>"Nothing definite, so far," replied Thorndyke, who was, at the
moment, taking a measurement of the height of the lower story with
a tape-measure; "but there is something here that wants explaining.
The internal height of the lower part of this cupboard is two feet
ten inches; but the height from the floor of the lower part to the
floor of the top part is three feet one inch. So there seems to be
a space of three inches, less the thickness of two boards, between
the ceiling of the lower part and the floor of the top part. That
is not a normal state of affairs."</p>

<p>"No, by jingo!" exclaimed the superintendent. "Ordinarily, the
floor of the top part would be the ceiling of the bottom part.
Carpenters don't waste wood like that. Either the floor or the
ceiling is false. Let us see if we can get a move on the floor.
That is the most likely, as it would be the lid of the space
between the two."</p>

<p>He passed his hands over the board, feeling for a yielding spot,
and craned in, searching for some indication of a joint, as he made
heavy pressure on the edges and corners. But the floor showed no
sign whatever of a tendency to move. He was about to transfer his
attention to the ceiling underneath when Thorndyke stopped him.</p>

<p>"Wait," said he. "Here is another abnormal feature. This
moulding along the front of the door is fastened on with three
screws. They have been painted over with the rest of the moulding,
but you can make out the slots quite plainly."</p>

<p>"Well?" queried Miller.</p>

<p>"Carpenters don't fix mouldings on with screws. They use nails
and punch them in with a 'nail-set' and stop the holes with putty.
Moreover, if you look closely at these screw-heads, you can see
that they have been turned at some time since the moulding was
painted."</p>

<p>As the superintendent stooped to verify this observation,
Thorndyke produced from his pocket a small leather pouch of
portable tools from which he took a screw-bit and the universal
handle. Having fitted them together, he inserted the screwdriver
into the slot of the middle screw and gave a turn.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said he. "This screw has been greased. Do you see how
easily it turns?"</p>

<p>He rotated the tool rapidly, and as the screw emerged he picked
it out and exhibited it to Miller.</p>

<p>"Not a trace of rust, you see, although the paint is some years
old."</p>

<p>He laid it down and turned to the left-hand screw, which he
extracted with similar ease. As he drew it out of its hole, the
moulding became visibly loose, though still supported by the mitre;
but when the last screw was extracted, the length of moulding came
away in his hand, showing the free front edge of the floor, or
bottom-board. This Thorndyke grasped with both hands and gave a
steady pull, when the board slid forward easily, revealing a cavity
about two inches deep.</p>

<p>"My eye!" exclaimed Miller, as Thorndyke drew the board right
out. "This puts the lid on it&mdash;or rather takes the lid
off."</p>

<p>He stood for a moment gazing ecstatically into the cavity, and
especially at a collection of small, flat boxes that were neatly
packed into it; then he grabbed up one of the boxes, and sliding
back the hooked catch, raised the lid.</p>

<p>The expression of half-amused astonishment with which he viewed
the open box was not entirely unjustified. As the receptacle for a
robber's hoard, it was, to say the least, unconventional. The
interior of the box was divided by partitions into a number of
little square cells; and in each cell, reposing in a nest of black
or white velvet according to its colour, was an unmounted gem.</p>

<p>The superintendent drew a deep breath. "Well," he exclaimed,
"this knocks anything I've ever come across. Looks as if he never
meant to sell the stuff at all. Just meant to keep it to gloat
over. Is this what you had expected to find, Doctor? I believe it
is, from what you said."</p>

<p>"Yes," Thorndyke replied. "This agrees exactly with my theory of
the robbery. I never supposed that he had stolen the gems for the
purpose of selling them."</p>

<p>"Didn't you?" said Miller. "Now, I wonder why."</p>

<p>"My dear Miller," Thorndyke answered, with a smile, "the answer
is before you in those cabinets which you have just examined. The
man was a human magpie. He had a passion for acquiring and
accumulating. He was the born, inveterate collector. Now, your
half-baked collector will sell his treasures at a sufficient
profit; but the real, thoroughbred collector, when once he has got
hold, will never let go."</p>

<p>"Well," said Miller, who had been meanwhile lifting out the
boxes and verifying their contents with a supercilious glance into
each, "what is one man's meat is another man's poison. I can't see
myself hoarding up expensive trash like this when I could swap it
for good money."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Thorndyke. "We both lack the acquisitive instinct.
By the way, Miller, I think you will agree with me that all the
circumstances point to Wampole's having done this
single-handed?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," was the reply. "This is a 'one-man show,' if ever
there was one."</p>

<p>"And, consequently, that this 'find' puts Osmond definitely out
of the picture?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Miller agreed; "I think there is no denying that."</p>

<p>"Then you will also agree that, although we might wish it
otherwise, the whole of the circumstances connected with this
robbery must be made public. That is necessary as a measure of
common justice to the memory of Osmond. He was publicly accused and
he must be publicly exonerated."</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Doctor," Miller admitted, regretfully;
"though it seems a pity, as the poor devil is dead and we've got
the swag back. But, as you say, justice is justice. The innocent
man ought to be cleared."</p>

<p>He took out the last remaining box, and having opened it and
looked in, handed it to Thorndyke and cast a final glance into the
cavity.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he exclaimed, reaching into the back of the space,
"here's something wrapped in paper&mdash;a key, by Jove!"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Thorndyke, taking it from him and inspecting it
curiously, "the key of the strong-room. I recognize it. Quite a
well-made key, too. I think we ought to hand that to Woodstock at
once; and perhaps it would be as well to hand him the gems, too,
and get his receipt for them. We don't want property of this
value&mdash;something like a hundred thousand pounds&mdash;on our
hands any longer than we can help. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I say let us get rid of them at once if we can. But we must
seal the boxes before we hand them over. And we must seal up these
rooms until the property has been checked by Hollis. Let us put the
books back in the cupboard and then, perhaps, you might go and find
Woodstock while I keep guard on the treasure-trove."</p>

<p>They fell to work repacking the cupboard with the albums and
magazines which they had taken out; and had nearly finished when
they became aware of voices below and then of hurried footsteps on
the stairs. A few moments later the door was flung open and Mr.
Woodstock and Mr. Hepburn strode into the room.</p>

<p>"May I ask," the former demanded, glaring at Miller, "who the
deuce you are and what is the meaning of this indecent invasion?
The housekeeper tells me that you profess to have come here to
search for missing property. What property are you searching for,
and what is your authority?"</p>

<p>The superintendent quietly explained who he was and exhibited
his warrant.</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Woodstock, with a withering glance at Thorndyke.
"And I suppose you are making this ridiculous search at the
suggestion of this gentleman?"</p>

<p>"You are quite correct, sir," replied Miller. "The warrant was
issued on information supplied by Dr. Thorndyke."</p>

<p>"Ha!" was the contemptuous comment. "You obtained a warrant to
search the private residence of a man of irreproachable character
who has been in my employ for something like a score of years!
Well, have you made your search? And if so, what have you
found?"</p>

<p>"We have completed the search," replied Miller, "and we have
found what we believe to be the whole of the stolen property, and
this key, which I understand is the key of your strong-room."</p>

<p>As the superintendent made this statement, in studiously
matter-of-fact tones, Mr. Woodstock's jaw fell and his eyes opened
until he appeared the very picture of astonishment. Nor was his
colleague, Mr. Hepburn, less amazed; and for a space of some
seconds the two solicitors stood speechless looking from one
another to the wooden-faced but secretly amused detective officer.
Then Woodstock recovered somewhat and began to show signs of
incredulity. But there was the key and there were the boxes; and it
needed only a glance at the contents of the latter to put the
matter beyond all question. Even Woodstock could not reject the
evidence of his eyesight.</p>

<p>"But," he said with a puzzled air and with new born civility,
"what I cannot understand is how you came to connect Wampole with
the robbery. Where did you obtain the evidence of his guilt?"</p>

<p>"I obtained it," Thorndyke replied, "from the dust which I
collected from your office floor."</p>

<p>Mr. Woodstock frowned impatiently and shook his head. "I am
afraid," he said, coldly, "you are speaking a language that I don't
understand. But no doubt you are right to keep your own counsel.
What do you propose to do with this property?"</p>

<p>"We had proposed to hand it to you to hold pending the formal
identification of the gems by Mr. Hollis."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Woodstock; "but I shall want you to seal the
boxes before I put them in my strong-room. I can't accept any
responsibility as to the nature of the contents."</p>

<p>"They shall be sealed with my seal and the superintendent's,"
Thorndyke replied, with a faint smile; "and we will hope that the
seals will give more security than they did last time."</p>

<p>This understanding having been arrived at, the boxes were
gathered up and distributed among the party for conveyance to the
office; and after a short halt on the landing while Miller locked
the doors and sealed the keyholes, they went down the stairs, at
the foot of which the tearful housekeeper was waiting. To her Mr.
Woodstock gave a brief and somewhat obscure explanation of the
proceedings and the sealed doors, and then the party set forth for
the office, the two solicitors leading and conversing in low tones
as they went.</p>

<p>Arrived at their destination, the formalities were soon disposed
of. Each box was tied up with red tape, sealed on the knot and on
the opening of the lid. Then, when they had all been conveyed into
the strong-room and locked in, Mr. Woodstock wrote out a receipt
for "eight boxes, containing real or artificial precious stones,
said to be the property of James Hollis, Esq., and sealed with the
seals of Dr. Thorndyke and Superintendent Miller of the C.I.D.,"
and handed it to the latter officer.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, "I shall communicate with Mr. Hollis at
once and ask him to remove these things from my custody. Probably
he will write to you concerning them; but, in any case, I shall
wash my hands of them when I get his receipt&mdash;and I shall take
very good care that nobody ever saddles me with portable property
of this kind again."</p>

<p>"A very wise resolution," said Thorndyke. "Perhaps you might
point out to Mr. Hollis that the boxes ought to be opened in the
presence of witnesses, one of whom, at least, should be an expert
judge of precious stones. I shall write to him to-night, before I
leave the town, to the same effect. We all want the restitution to
be definitely proved and acknowledged."</p>

<p>"That is perfectly true," Woodstock admitted; "and perhaps I had
better make it a condition on which I allow him to take possession
of the boxes."</p>

<p>The business being now concluded, Thorndyke and the
superintendent prepared to take their departure. As they were
turning away, Mr. Hepburn addressed Thorndyke for the first
time.</p>

<p>"May I ask," he said, hesitatingly and with an air of some
embarrassment, "whether the&mdash;er&mdash;the dust from our office
floor or&mdash;er&mdash;any other observations of yours which led
you to this surprising discovery seemed to suggest the existence of
any confederate?"</p>

<p>"No," Thorndyke replied, decisively. "All the evidence goes to
show, very conclusively, that Wampole carried out this robbery
single-handed. Of that I, personally, have no doubt; and I think
the superintendent agrees with me."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," Miller assented. "I, too, am perfectly convinced
that our late lamented friend played a lone hand. You are thinking
of John Osmond?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Hepburn admitted, with a frown of perplexity. "I am. I am
wondering what on earth can have induced him to go off in that
extraordinary manner and at that particular time."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Thorndyke.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm afraid we shall never learn now," said Woodstock.</p>

<p>"Apparently not," Thorndyke agreed; "and yet&mdash;who
knows?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THORNDYKE CONNECTS
THE LINKS</h2>

<p class="first">EARLY in the afternoon&mdash;at forty minutes past
twelve, to be exact&mdash;of a sunny day in late spring, a tall,
hatchet-faced man, accompanied by a small, sprightly lady, strolled
at a leisurely pace through Pump Court and presently emerged into
the cloisters, where he and his companion halted and looked about
them.</p>

<p>"What a lovely old place it is!" the latter exclaimed, letting
her eyes travel appreciatively from the porch of the Temple Church
to the façade of Lamb Buildings. "Wouldn't you like to live here,
Jack?"</p>

<p>"I should," he replied. "It is delightful to look at whichever
way you turn; and there is such a delicious atmosphere of peace and
quiet."</p>

<p>She laughed merrily. "Peace and quiet!" she repeated. "Peace,
perfect peace. That has always been the desire of your heart,
hasn't it? Oh, you old hum bug! Before you had been here a month
you would be howling for the sea and someone to fight." Here her
glance lighted on the little wig shop, tucked away in its shady
corner, and she drew him eagerly towards it "Let us have a look at
these wigs," said she. "I love wigs. It is a pity they have gone
out of fashion for general use. They were such a let-off for
bald-headed men. Which one do you like best, Jack? I rather fancy
that big one&mdash;full-bottomed, I think, is its proper
description. It would suit you to a T. It looks a little vacant
with no face inside it, but it would have a grand appearance with
your old nose sticking out in front. You'd look like the Great
Sphinx before they knocked his nose off. Don't you think you'd look
rather well in it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that I am particularly keen on wigs," he
replied.</p>

<p>"Unless they are on the green," she suggested with a roguish
smile.</p>

<p>He smiled at her in return, with a surprising softening of the
rather rugged face, and then glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"We mustn't loiter here staring at these ridiculous wigs," said
he; "or we shall be late. Come along, you little babbler."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," she responded; "come along, it is," and they
resumed their leisurely progress eastward across the court.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he said, reflectively, "what sort of fellow
Thorndyke is. Moderately human, I hope, be cause I want him to
understand what I feel about all that he has done for us."</p>

<p>"I shall want to kiss him," said she.</p>

<p>"You had better not," he said, threateningly. "Still, short of
that, I shall look to you to let him know how grateful, beyond all
words, we are to him."</p>

<p>"You can trust me, Jack, darling," she replied, "to make it as
clear as I can. When I think of it, I feel like crying. We owe him
everything. He is our fairy-godmother."</p>

<p>"I don't think, Betty, dear," said Osmond with a faint grin,
"that I should put it to him in exactly those words."</p>

<p>"I wasn't going to, you old guffin!" she exclaimed, indignantly.
"But it is what I feel. He is a magician. A touch of his magic wand
changed us in a moment from a pair of miserable, hopeless wretches
into the pet children of Fortune, rich in everything we desired,
and with the whole world of happiness at our feet. Oh, the wonder
of it! Just think, darling! While you, with that ridiculous bee in
your silly old bonnet, were doing everything that you could to make
yourself&mdash;and me&mdash;miserable for life, here was this dry
old lawyer, whose very existence we were unaware of, quietly,
methodically working away to dig us out of our own entanglements.
We can never even thank him properly."</p>

<p>"No. That's a fact," Osmond agreed. "And, in spite of Penfield's
explanations, I can't in the least understand how he did it."</p>

<p>"Mr. Penfield admits that he has only a glimmering of an idea
himself; but as he has promised to extract a full explanation
to-day, we can afford to bottle up our curiosity a little longer.
This seems to be the house; yes, here we are: '1st Pair, Dr. John
Thorndyke.'"</p>

<p>She tripped up the stairs, followed by Osmond, and on the
landing was confronted by the open 'oak' and a closed inner door,
adorned by a small but brilliantly burnished brass knocker.</p>

<p>"What a dinkie little knocker!" she exclaimed; and forthwith
executed upon it a most impressive flourish. Almost instantly the
door was opened by a tall, dignified man who greeted the visitors
with a smile of quiet geniality.</p>

<p>"I have no need to ask who you are," he said, as, having saluted
the lady, he shook hands with Osmond. "Your resemblance to your
mother is quite remarkable."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Osmond, a little mystified, nevertheless. "I was
always considered to be very like her. I should like to think that
the likeness is not only a superficial one."</p>

<p>Here he became aware of Mr. Penfield, who had risen from an
arm-chair and was advancing, snuff-box in hand, to greet them.</p>

<p>"It is very delightful to meet you both in these chambers," said
he, with an old bow. "A most interesting and significant meeting.
Your husband's name has often been spoken here, Mrs. Osmond, in the
days when he was, to us, a mere abstraction of mystery."</p>

<p>"I've no doubt it has," said Betty, regarding the old lawyer
with a mischievous smile, "and I don't suppose it was spoken of in
very complimentary terms. But we are both absolutely bursting with
gratitude and we don't know how to put our feelings into
words."</p>

<p>"There is no occasion for gratitude." said Thorndyke. "It has
been a mutual change of benefits. Your husband has provided us with
a problem of the most thrilling interest, which we have had the
satisfaction of solving, with the added pleasure of being of some
service to you. We are really your debtors."</p>

<p>"Very kind of you to put it in that way," said Osmond, with a
faint grin. "I seem to have played a sort of Falstaffian part. My
deficiency of wit has been the occasion of wit in others."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Osmond," Thorndyke rejoined, with an appreciative
side-glance at the smiling Betty, "you seem to have had wit enough
to bring your affairs to a very happy conclusion. But let us draw
up to the table. I understand that there are to be mutual
explanations presently, so we had better fortify ourselves with
nourishment."</p>

<p>He pressed an electric bell, and, as his guests took their
places at the table, the door opened silently and Polton entered
with demure gravity to post himself behind Thorndyke's chair and
generally to supervise the proceedings.</p>

<p>Conversation was at first somewhat spasmodic and covered a good
deal of mutual and curious inspection. Betty was frankly interested
in her surroundings, in the homely simplicity of this queer
bachelor household, in which everything seemed to be done so
quietly, so smoothly, and so efficiently. But especially was she
interested in her host. Of his great intellect and learning she had
been readily enough convinced by Mr. Penfield's enthusiastic
accounts of him; but his personality, his distinguished appearance,
and his genial, pleasant manners were quite beyond her
expectations. It was a pleasure to her to look at him and to
reflect that the affectionate gratitude that she must have felt for
him, whatever he had been like, had at least been worthily
bestowed.</p>

<p>"My husband and I were speaking as we came along," she said, "of
the revolution in our prospects that you created, in an instant, as
it seemed, in the twinkling of an eye. One moment our affairs were
at a perfectly hopeless deadlock; the next, all our difficulties
were smoothed out, the tangle was unravelled, and an assured and
happy future lay before us. It looked like nothing short of magic;
for, you see, John had done everything that he possibly could to
convince all the world that he was guilty."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "that is how it appeared; and that is one
of the mysteries which has to be cleared up presently."</p>

<p>"It shall be," Osmond promised, "if utterly idiotic,
wrong-headed conduct can be made intelligible to reasonable men.
But still, I agree with my wife. There is something quite uncanny
in the way in which you unravelled this extraordinary tangle. I am
a lawyer myself&mdash;a pretty poor lawyer, I admit&mdash;and I
have heard Mr. Penfield's account of the investigation, but even
that has not enlightened me."</p>

<p>"For a very good reason," said Mr. Penfield. "I am not
enlightened myself. I am, I believe, in possession of most of the
material facts. But I have not the special knowledge that is
necessary to interpret them. I am still unable to trace the
connection between the evidence and the conclusion. Dr. Thorndyke's
methods are, to me, a source of endless wonder."</p>

<p>"And yet," said Thorndyke, "they are perfectly normal and
simple. They differ from the methods of an orthodox lawyer merely
in this: that whereas the issues that I have to try are usually
legal issues, the means which I employ are those proper to
scientific research."</p>

<p>"But surely," Betty interposed, "the purposes of legal and
scientific research are essentially the same. Both aim at arrive at
the truth."</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied. "The purposes are identical. But the
procedure is totally different. In legal practice the issues have
to be decided by persons who have no first-hand knowledge of the
facts&mdash;by the judge and jury. To them the facts are furnished
by other persons&mdash;the witnesses&mdash;who have such first-hand
knowledge and who are sworn to give it truly and completely. And on
such sworn testimony the judges form their decision. The verdict
has to be 'according to the evidence,' and its truth is necessarily
subject to the truth of the testimony and the competence of the
witnesses.</p>

<p>"But in scientific research there is no such division of
function. The investigator is at once judge, jury, and witness. His
knowledge is first-hand, and hence he knows the exact value of his
evidence. He can hold a suspended judgment. He can form alternative
opinions and act upon both alternatives. He can construct
hypotheses and try them out. He is hampered by no rules but those
of his own making. Above all, he is able to interrogate things as
well as persons."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Mr. Penfield, "that is what has impressed me. You
are independent of witnesses. Instead of having to seek somebody
who can give evidence in respect of certain facts, you obtain the
facts yourself and become your own witness. No doubt this will
become evident in your exposition of this case, to which
I&mdash;and our friends too, I am sure&mdash;are looking forward
with eager interest."</p>

<p>"You are paying me a great compliment," said Thorndyke; "and as
I hear Polton approaching with the coffee, I need not keep you
waiting any longer. By the way, how much may I assume that our
friends know?"</p>

<p>"They know all that I know," replied Mr. Penfield. "We have had
a long talk and I have told them everything I have learned and that
you have told me."</p>

<p>"Then I shall assume that they have all the main facts, and they
must stop me if I assume too much." He paused while Polton poured
out the coffee and partially disencumbered the table. Then as his
familiar retired, he continued: "I think that the clearest and most
interesting way for me to present the case will be by recounting
the investigation as it actually occurred, giving the facts
observed and the inferences from them in their actual order of
occurrence."</p>

<p>"That will certainly be the easiest plan for us to follow," said
Osmond, "if it will not be too wearisome for you."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," replied Thorndyke, "it will be quite
interesting to me to reconstitute the case as a whole; and the best
way will be to treat it in the successive stages into which the
inquiry naturally fell. I will begin with the information which was
given to me when the case was placed in my hands.</p>

<p>"A number of sealed boxes had been deposited by Mr. Hollis in
the custody of Mr. Woodstock, who placed them in his strong-room.
These boxes were stated by Hollis to contain a number of valuable
gems, but the nature of the contents was actually known only to
Hollis, who had packed the boxes himself. After an interval the
boxes were returned to Hollis; and it was agreed by all the
parties, including Hollis, that all the seals were then intact.
Nevertheless, on opening the boxes, Hollis found that most of the
gems had been abstracted and replaced by counterfeits. Thereupon he
declared that a robbery had been committed while the boxes were
reposing in the strong room; and this view was, strange to say,
accepted by Mr. Woodstock.</p>

<p>"Now, it was perfectly obvious that these statements of alleged
fact were mutually irreconcilable. They could not possibly be all
true. The question was, Which of them was untrue? If the stones
were in the boxes when they were handed to Woodstock and were not
there when he returned them to Hollis, then the boxes must have
been opened in the interval. But in that case the seals must have
been broken. On the other hand, if the seals were really intact,
the boxes could not have been opened while they were in Woodstock's
custody. Woodstock's position&mdash;which was also that of
Hollis&mdash;was a manifest absurdity. What they alleged to have
happened was a physical impossibility.</p>

<p>"So far, however, the legal position was quite simple, if
Woodstock had accepted it. The seals were admitted to be intact.
Therefore no robbery could have occurred in Woodstock's office. But
Woodstock accepted the impossible; and thereupon a certain Mr. John
Osmond proceeded very deliberately to tip the fat into the
fire."</p>

<p>"Yes, didn't he?" agreed Betty with a delighted gurgle. "You
were an old guffin, Jack! Still, it was all for the best, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It was, indeed," assented Osmond. "Best stroke of work I ever
did. You see, I knew that there is a Providence that watches over
fools. But we mustn't interrupt the exposition."</p>

<p>"Well," continued Thorndyke, "the disappearance of Mr. Osmond
settled the matter so far as Mr. Woodstock was concerned. He swore
an information forthwith, and must have grossly misled the police,
for they immediately obtained a warrant, which they certainly would
not have done if they had known the real facts. Then Woodstock,
distrusting his own abilities&mdash;very justly, but too
late&mdash;consulted Mr. Penfield. But Mr. Penfield took the
perfectly sound legal view of the case. The seals were admittedly
unbroken. Therefore the boxes had been returned intact and there
had been no robbery in the office. But if there had been no
robbery, the disappearance of Osmond had no bearing on the case. Of
course, neither Woodstock nor Hollis would agree to this view, and
Mr. Penfield then recommended that the case should be put in my
hands.</p>

<p>"Now it was obvious that the whole case turned on the seals.
They had been accepted as intact&mdash;without any kind of inquiry
or examination. But were they really intact? If they were, the case
was against Hollis; and I could see that my friend Professor Eccles
suspected him of having engineered a sham robbery to evade a
bequest to the nation. But this seemed to me a wild and unfair
suspicion, and for my own part I strongly suspected the seals.
Accordingly, I examined a whole series of them, minutely and
exhaustively, with the result that they proved to be impressions,
not of the matrix in Mr. Hollis's ring, but of an electrotype
matrix made from a wax impression.</p>

<p>"This new fact brought the inquiry to the next stage. It proved
that the boxes had been opened and that they had been opened in
Woodstock's office. For when they came there they were sealed with
Hollis's seal, but when they left the office they were sealed with
the forged seal. Things began to look rather black as regards
Osmond; but, although I was retained ostensibly to work up a case
against him, I kept an open mind and proceeded with the
investigation as if he did not exist.</p>

<p>"The second stage, then, started with the establishment of these
facts: a robbery had really occurred; it had occurred in
Woodstock's office; and, since the boxes had been kept in the
strong-room, it was from thence that they had been abstracted. The
next question was, By whom had the robbery been committed? Now,
since the property had been taken from the strong-room, and since
the strong-room had not been broken into, it followed that the
thief must have had, or obtained, access to it. Now, there were
three persons who had easy access to it: Woodstock who possessed
the key, Hepburn and Osmond, both of whom occasionally had the key
in their custody: There might be others, but if so, they were at
present unknown to me. But of the three who were known, one,
Osmond, had apparently absconded as soon as the robbery was
discovered and connected with the office. Moreover, the
commencement of the robberies apparently coincided in time with the
date on which he joined the staff.</p>

<p>"Evidently, then, everything that was known pointed to Osmond as
the delinquent. But there was no positive case against him, and I
decided to proceed as if nothing at all were known and seek for
fresh data. And my first proceeding was to make an exhaustive
examination of the boxes, the wrapping-paper, and the inside
packing. As to the paper, I may say that I developed up a large
number of finger-prints&mdash;on the outside surface only&mdash;I
never examined, as the occasion did not arise. The investigation
really concerned itself with the dust from the insides of the boxes
and from the packing material. Of this I collected every particle
that I could extract and put it aside in pill-boxes numbered in
accordance with the boxes from which it was obtained. When I came
to examine systematically the contents of the pill-boxes, I made
two very curious discoveries.</p>

<p>"First, every pill-box&mdash;representing, you will remember,
one of the gem-boxes&mdash;contained one or more hairs; usually one
only and never more than three. They were all alike. Each was a
hair from a moustache of a light-brown colour and cut quite short,
and there could be no doubt that they were all from the same
individual. Consequently they could not be chance hairs which had
blown in accidentally. The gem-boxes had been packed at various
times, and hence the uniformity of the hairs connected them
definitely with the person who packed the boxes. In short, it
seemed at first sight practically certain that they were the hairs
of the actual robber; in which case we could say that the robber
was a man with a short light-brown moustache.</p>

<p>"But when I came to reflect on the facts observed I was struck
by their singularity. Moustache hairs are shed very freely, but
they do not drop out at regular intervals. One, two, or more hairs
in any one box would not have been surprising. A man who was in the
habit of pulling at or stroking his moustache might dislodge two or
three at once. The surprising thing was the regularity with which
these hairs occurred; one, and usually one only, in each box, and
no complete box in which there was none. It was totally opposed to
the laws of probability.</p>

<p>"The point was highly significant. Anyone can recognize a hair.
Most men can recognize a moustache hair. A detective certainly
could. If these boxes had been opened by the police, as Hollis had
originally intended, these hairs would almost certainly have been
seen and eagerly fastened on as giving what would amount to a
description of the thief. They would have been put in evidence at
the trial and would have been perfectly convincing to the jury.</p>

<p>"The more I reflected on the matter the more did I suspect those
hairs. If one assumed that they had been planted deliberately, say
by a clean-shaved or dark-haired criminal, their regular occurrence
in every box would be quite understandable. It would be a necessary
precaution against their being overlooked. Otherwise it was
unaccountable. Still, the fact of their presence had to be noted
and the individual from whom they came identified, if possible.</p>

<p>"The second discovery that I made was, perhaps, even more odd.
In every one of the boxes I found particles of the fine dust which
falls out of the holes in worm-eaten wood; sometimes only a few
grains, sometimes quite a large number of grains, and in the
aggregate a really considerable quantity."</p>

<p>"But how astonishing," exclaimed Betty, "that you should be able
to tell at once that these tiny grains came from worm-eaten
wood."</p>

<p>"I make it my business," he replied, "to be able to recognize
the microscopical appearances of the different forms of dust. But
your remark indicates a very significant point. I imagine that
there will be very few persons in the world who could identify
these particles in a collection of miscellaneous dust. And therein
lay the value of this discovery; for if the significance of the
hairs was open to doubt, that of the wood certainly was not. There
was no question of its having been purposely planted. It had
certainly found its way into the boxes accidentally, and the person
who had unconsciously introduced it was pretty certainly unaware of
its presence. It was undoubtedly a genuine clue.</p>

<p>"The discovery of this characteristic dust raised several
questions. In the first place, how came it into the boxes? Dust
from worm-eaten furniture falls on the floor and remains there. It
is too coarse and heavy to float in the air like the finer kinds of
dust. In a room in which there is worm-eaten furniture, you will
find the particles of dust all over the floor; but you will not
find any on the tables or chair-rails or mantelpiece. But these
boxes must have stood on a table or bench when they were being
packed and when the dust got into them. Then the dust must have
been on the table or bench. But how could it have got there? It was
possible that the bench, itself, might have been worm-eaten. But
that was not a probable explanation, for the dust tends to fall,
not to rise. It would have fallen, for the most part, from the
under surface on to the floor. The most likely explanation emerged
from a consideration of the next question; which was, how could one
account for the large quantity that was found?</p>

<p>"The quantity was extraordinarily large. From the whole set of
boxes we collected something approaching a quarter of a thimbleful;
which seems an enormous amount if you consider that it must all
have got into the boxes during the short time that they were open
for packing. What could be the explanation?</p>

<p>"There were two factors which had to be considered: the nature
of the wood and the nature of the object which had been fashioned
from it; and both were important for purposes of identification.
Let us consider the first factor&mdash;material. Now, these
wood-boring insects do not bore through wood as the bookworm bores
through paper, to get at something else. They actually feed upon
the wood. Naturally, then, they tend to select the kind of wood
which contains the most nourishment and which, incidentally, is
usually the softest. But of all woods those of the fruit trees are
richest in gum and sap and are most subject to the attacks of the
worm. Walnut, pear, apple, plum, and cherry all have this drawback,
and of these cherry is so inveterately 'wormy' that it has usually
been shunned by the cabinet-maker. Now, the quantity of the
wood-dust pointed to some excessively worm-eaten object and
suggested one of the fruit woods as the probable material, and the
balance of probability was in favour of cherry; and this was
supported by the pinkish colour of the dust. But, of course, this
inference was purely hypothetical. It represented the general
probabilities and nothing more.</p>

<p>"And now we come to the second factor. What was the nature of
this wooden object? A piece of ordinary furniture we could dismiss
for two reasons: first, the dust from such a piece will ordinarily
fall upon the floor, from whence it could hardly have got into the
boxes; and, second, no matter how badly wormed a piece of furniture
may be, the quantity of dust which falls from it is relatively
small and accumulates quite slowly, being practically confined to
that which is pushed out of the holes by the movements of the
insects within. This process would not account for the great
quantity indicated by these samples of ours. My feeling was that
this worm-eaten object was an appliance of some sort, subject to
frequent and violent disturbance. Let us take an imaginary case as
an illustration. Let us imagine a mallet with an excessively
worm-eaten head. Whenever that mallet is used, the shock of the
impact will send a shower of wood-dust flying out on the bench,
where it will rapidly accumulate.</p>

<p>"But, of course, this object of ours could not be a mallet for
the reason that mallets are always made of hard wood; and
jewellers' mallets are usually made of box-wood, lignum vitae or
horn, none of which is subject to 'the worm'. Thinking over the
various appliances used by jewellers&mdash;since it was with a
jeweller we were dealing&mdash;I suddenly bethought me of one which
seemed to fulfil the conditions exactly. Jewellers and goldsmiths,
as you probably know, use a variety of miniature anvils, known as
stakes, bec irons, sparrowhawks, etc. Now, these little anvils are
usually stuck in a block of wood, just as a smith's anvil is
planted on a tree-stump. These blocks are not usually hard wood;
indeed, soft wood is preferable as it absorbs the shock better. A
favourite plan is to get a little log of wood and set the spike of
the stake or sparrow-hawk in a hole bored in the end grain; and the
most abundant source of these little logs&mdash;at least in the
country&mdash;is the pile of trimmings from old fruit trees. Such a
log would tend very soon to become worm-eaten; and if it did, every
time it was used a ring of wood-dust would form around its base and
would soon spread all over the bench, sticking to everything on it
and straying on to the hands, arms, and clothing of the
workman.</p>

<p>"This inference, you will observe, was, like the previous one,
purely hypothetical. But it agreed perfectly with the observed
facts and accounted for them in a reasonable way; and as I could
think of no other that did, I adopted it with the necessary
reservations. But, in fact, the correctness or incorrectness of
this hypothesis was at present of no great importance. Apart from
any question as to its exact origin, the wood-dust was an
invaluable clue. We now knew that the unknown robber was a person
whose clothing was more or less impregnated with wood-dust; that
any places that he had frequented would yield traces of wood-dust
from the floors, and that the place where the boxes had been packed
abounded in wood-dust and contained a badly worm-eaten wooden
object of some kind.</p>

<p>"The next proceeding was obvious. It was to find the places
which had been frequented by that unknown person, to seek for the
worm-eaten object, and, if possible, to identify the individual who
appeared to be connected with it. The suspected places were two:
Mr. Hollis's house and Mr. Woodstock's office. I did not, myself,
suspect Hollis; but nevertheless I determined to examine his house
as narrowly as the other. Accordingly I asked Mr. Penfield to
obtain facilities for me to visit both places to make inquiries on
the spot; which he did.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, before I describe that voyage of exploration, it may
be as well to pause and consider what knowledge I now possessed and
what I was going to look for. There was the wood-dust, of course.
That was the visible trail that I hoped to pick up. But there were
other matters. I knew that there was a man, in some way connected
with the robbery, who had a short, fair moustache. I had to find
out who he was. Also if there was any source from which some other
person might collect specimen hairs from that moustache&mdash;a
hair-brush, for instance&mdash;and if such source existed, who had
access to it.</p>

<p>"Then there was the personality of the thief. One knew a good
deal about him by this time. He was an ingenious man; a fairly good
workman, at any rate, with metal-worker's tools, but not a skilled
jeweller. He must have been able to make a key from a wax
squeeze&mdash;unless he were Woodstock himself, which he pretty
certainly was not; for none of the others had sufficiently free
access to the strong-room to do what had been done. Then he must
have had at least a simple working knowledge of electric batteries,
since we could be fairly certain that he made the electrotypes
himself; he would never have run the risk of putting the forgery
out to the trade. He was clearly a secretive, self-contained man.
The only fallacy that I had to guard against was the possibility of
a confederate outside the office, who might have done the actual
work; but this possibility seemed to be negatived by the whole
character of the robbery and especially by one very odd feature in
it, which was this: Professor Eccles had noticed with surprise that
many of the stones which were taken were of quite trifling
intrinsic value, so trifling that, if they had been sold, they
would hardly have realized enough to pay the cost of replacing them
with the specially-made counterfeits. Indeed, in one case, at
least, the thief must have lost money on the transaction, for he
had taken a fine moonstone and replaced it with an inferior one of
the same dimensions. But the value of the original was only about
ten shillings, and he must have spent more than that on the
replacement. The professor was greatly puzzled by this, having
assumed, of course, that the gems were stolen to sell. But to me,
this rather anomalous feature of the robbery offered a very curious
suggestion; which was that no sale of the booty had ever been
contemplated. It looked like a collector's robbery; and if there
had been a collector in any way connected with the parties, I
should have given him my very close attention. But, so far as I
knew, there was none. Nevertheless, this peculiarity of the robbery
had to be borne in mind when I came to make my investigations on
the spot.</p>

<p>"Let me now briefly describe those investigations. Their main
object was to ascertain whether there were any traces of wood-dust
in the premises of either Hollis or Woodstock, and the method was
this: in each case, a rough ground-plan of the premises was made;
then small areas of the floors were cleaned thoroughly with a
specially constructed vacuum cleaner and the dust from each area
put into an envelope marked with a number, which number was also
marked in the plan on the spot from which the dust had been
collected. The collection was carried out by my laboratory
assistant, Mr. Polton, whom you have seen, leaving me free to make
inquiries and to inspect the premises. Of course, the samples of
dust had to be brought home to be examined in the laboratory, so we
were hampered by the circumstance that we did not know at the time
whether any wood-dust had or had not been obtained. But this proved
to be of no importance.</p>

<p>"We operated first at Mr. Hollis's house, regardless of his
scornful protests. Then we went on to Mr. Woodstock's office; and
there I had a rather remarkable experiences As I entered with Mr.
Woodstock, I saw an elderly man engaged in repairing an electric
bell; and a glance at his hands and the way in which he manipulated
his tools showed the unmistakable facility and handiness of the
skilled workman. It was a little startling; for here were two of
the characteristics of the unknown person I was endeavouring to
identify. This man had evident skill in the use of metal-worker's
tools and he clearly knew a good deal about electric batteries. And
when I learned that this Mr. Wampole was the office-keeper and that
he evidently had a key of the premises, I was still further
impressed. I began to revise my opinion as to there being no
confederate; for the fact remained that Osmond had absconded and
that his disappearance&mdash;until it was otherwise
explained&mdash;undeniably connected him with the robbery. I began
to think it possible that there had been a partnership and that he
had been used as a cat's paw. Meanwhile, I had to find out as much
as I could about him, and to this end I sat down by Wampole, as he
worked at refitting the batteries, and questioned him on the
subject of Osmond's appearance, habits, temperament, and
circumstances. It is only fair to him to say that he scouted the
idea of Osmond's having committed the robbery and gave excellent
reasons for rejecting it. On the other hand, his description of
Osmond made it clear that the hairs which I had found in the boxes
were Osmond's hairs; and when I expressed a wish to inspect
Osmond's desk, he took me to it readily enough, and as it was
unlocked, he threw up the lid and showed me the interior. The most
interesting thing in it, from my point of view, was a pair of
hair-brushes; from which I was able to extract several moustache
hairs which appeared&mdash;and subsequently turned out to
be&mdash;identically similar to those found in the boxes.</p>

<p>"The examination of Osmond's desk suggested a similar
examination of all the other desks in the office, finishing up with
that belonging to Mr. Wampole. And it was in examining that desk
that I did really receive somewhat of a shock. For when we came to
turn out its contents, I found that these included, in addition to
a number of metal-worker's tools, a work man's linen apron and some
battery terminals and insulated wire, a stamp-album, a tray of
military buttons and badges and old civilian buttons, and another
tray of old coins.</p>

<p>"The coincidence was too striking to be ignored. Here was a man
who had free access to these premises night and day, and who
corresponded in every particular with the unknown robber. We had
already seen that he had the skill and special knowledge that were
postulated; now this stamp-album, these buttons, badges, and coins,
wrote him down an inveterate collector. If I had looked on Mr.
Wampole with interest before, I now regarded him with very definite
suspicion. Whatever significance the hairs had seemed to have was
now entirely against him; for there were the brushes, easily
available, and he knew it.</p>

<p>"I must confess that I was greatly puzzled. Every new fact that
I observed seemed more and more to confuse the issues. With the
exception of the hairs&mdash;which were, at least, doubtful
evidence&mdash;I had found nothing whatever to incriminate Osmond;
whereas Wampole presented a highly suspicious appearance. But
Osmond had absconded; which seemed to put Wampole outside the
inquiry, excepting as a confederate. And when I went with Wampole
to Osmond's rooms, my inspection of them only left me more puzzled;
for the personality that they reflected was the very opposite of
that indicated by the nature and method of the robbery. Instead of
the avarice and cunning that characterized the robber, the
qualities suggested were those of a hardy, adventurous, open-air
man, simple to austerity in his tastes and concerned with any thing
rather than wealth and worldly possessions. The very photographs on
the mantelpiece proclaimed the incongruity, especially that of his
mother, whom Wampole informed me he strongly resembled; which
showed the face of a dignified, strong, resolute, courageous
looking lady, whose son I found it hard to picture, first as a
thief, and then as a panicky fugitive. Yet the fact remained that
Osmond had absconded.</p>

<p>"However, when we got home and proceeded to question the samples
of dust in the laboratory, they gave an answer that was
unmistakable. The results were roughly thus: the samples from
Hollis's house contained no wood-dust; those from Osmond's rooms
contained none; that from the inside of his desk contained none and
that from his office floor barely a trace. Those from the floor of
the clerks' office yielded a very small quantity, but that from the
floor by Wampole's desk contained quite a large amount, while the
dust extracted from the interior of his desk was full of the
castings&mdash;derived, no doubt, to a large extent from the apron
which he had kept in it. So the murder was out. The man who had
packed those boxes was Mr. Wampole, and the hairs which I found in
them had come from Osmond's brushes.</p>

<p>"One thing only remained to be done: the final verification. The
wood-dust had to be traced to its ultimate source in Wampole's
lair. This invaluable service was carried out by my assistant,
Polton, who, with extraordinary tact and skill, contrived to get a
glimpse into the workshop during Wampole's absence; and when he
peeped in, the first object that met his eye was a sparrowhawk,
planted in a little log of cherry-wood that was absolutely riddled
by the worm. That concluded the inquiry so far as I was concerned,
though some further work had to be done to enable the police to
act. But no doubt Mr. Penfield has told you about the lapidary and
the police raid which resulted in Wampole's death and the discovery
of the gems in his possession."</p>

<p>"Yes," Osmond replied, "I think we have had full details of the
final stages. Indeed, Mr. Penfield had given us most of the facts
that you have mentioned, but neither he nor we were able to connect
them completely. It seemed to us as if you had made one or two very
fortunate guesses; but now that I have heard your reasoned
exposition I can see that there was no element of guessing at
all."</p>

<p>"Exactly," agreed Mr. Penfield; "every stage of the argument
rests securely on the preceding stages. I am beginning to suspect
that we lawyers habitually underestimate the man of science."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Osmond, "I am afraid that is so. It is pretty
certain that no lawyer could have solved this mystery."</p>

<p>"I have to remind you," Thorndyke remarked, "that the man of
science was not able to solve it. He was able only to solve a part
of it. The thief was identified and the stolen property traced to
its hiding-place. But one question remained and still remains
unanswered. Why did John Osmond disappear?"</p>

<p>Osmond and Betty both smiled, and the latter asked: "Did you
never form any guess on the subject?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Thorndyke, "I made plenty of guesses. But
that was mere speculation which led to nothing. It occurred to me,
for instance, that he was perhaps drawing a red-herring across the
trail&mdash;that he was shielding the real criminal. But I could
find no support for the idea. I could see no reason why he should
shield Wampole&mdash;unless he was a confederate, which I did not
believe. If the criminal had been Hepburn, it would have been at
least imaginable. But there was never the shadow of a suspicion in
regard to Hepburn. No, I never had even a hypothesis; and I haven't
now."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised," said Osmond, with a slightly sheepish
grin. "It was beyond even your powers to conceive the possible
actions of an impulsive fool who has mistaken the facts. However,
as I have put you to the trouble of trying to account for my
unaccountable conduct, it is only fair that I should make it clear,
if I can; even though I know that when I have finished, your
opinion of me will be like Bumble's opinion of the Law&mdash;that I
am 'a ass and a idiot.'"</p>

<p>"I hardly think that very likely," said Thorndyke, turning a
twinkling eye on Betty. "As I said just now, you seem to have
brought a most unpromising affair to an extraordinarily
satisfactory conclusion which is not at all suggestive of 'a ass
and a idiot.'"</p>

<p>"But," objected Osmond, "the satisfactory conclusion which you
are putting to my credit is entirely your own work. I set up the
obstacles; you knocked them down. However, we need not argue the
point in advance. I will tell you the story and you shall judge for
yourself."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a>XX. &mdash; OSMOND'S MOTIVE</h2>

<p class="first">"IN order to make my position clear," Osmond
began, "it is necessary for me to say certain things to you, my
best and kindest of friends, which I should not confide to any
other human creature. I shall have to confess to thoughts and
suspicions which were probably quite unjust and unreasonable and
which are now uttered subject to the seal of the confession."</p>

<p>The two lawyers bowed gravely in acknowledgement, and Osmond
continued: "I was introduced to Mr. Woodstock, as you know, by my
brother-in-law, Mr. Hepburn; and I may say that I accepted the post
chiefly that I might be near my sister. She and I had always been
very devoted to one another, and from the time when I left Oxford
up to the date of her marriage we had lived under one roof; and
that was how she came to make the acquaintance of Hepburn.</p>

<p>"I did not encourage the intimacy, but neither could I hinder
it. She was of a responsible age and she knew her own mind. The end
of it was that, after an engagement lasting a few months, they were
married, and there was nothing more to be said. But I was rather
troubled about it. I had known Hepburn nearly all my life. We had
been at school together and the greater part of our time at Oxford,
where we belonged to the same college, Merton. Through all those
years we were on the footing of intimate friends&mdash;rather
oddly, for we were very different in temperament and tastes, and,
indeed, had very little in common&mdash;and we knew one another
extremely well. I don't know what Hepburn thought of me, but I must
confess that I never had much of an opinion of him. He was a clever
man; rather too clever, to my taste. An excellent manager, very
much on the spot, and in fact decidedly cunning; fearfully keen on
the main chance, fond of money and ambitious to be rich, and none
too scrupulous in his ideas. At school he was one of those boys who
contrive to increase their pocket-money by all sorts of mysterious
little deals, and the same tendency showed up at Oxford. I didn't
like his ways at all. I always had the feeling that, if he should
ever be tempted by an opportunity to make a haul by illegitimate
means, he might be led by his acquisitiveness to do something
shady.</p>

<p>"However, his morals were not in my custody and were none of my
business until he began to visit us at my rooms, where I was living
with my sister. Then I gave her a few words of warning; but they
took no effect. He made himself acceptable to her, and, as I have
said, they became engaged and eventually, when Hepburn took up his
job with Woodstock, married. For a year or two I saw little of
them&mdash;I was articled to a solicitor in London; but when I was
fully qualified Hepburn, at my sister's suggestion, offered to
speak to Woodstock on my behalf, and the result was that I entered
the office, as you have heard.</p>

<p>"And now I come to the particular transaction. Woodstock's
office was, as you know, conducted in a rather happy-go-lucky
fashion, especially as regards the strong-room. The key hung on the
wall practically all day. Usually, Woodstock took it away with him
at night; but quite frequently, when Woodstock was away for a
night, it would be left in Hepburn's charge. Occasionally it was
left with me; and on one occasion, at least, Wampole had charge of
it for a night. And each of us four, Woodstock, Hepburn, Wampole,
and myself, had a key of the outer door and could enter the
premises whenever we pleased. You will remember, too, that the
house was empty, out of office hours. There was no caretaker.</p>

<p>"Now, one night when I had been out on the river and got home
rather late, I found that I had run out of tobacco. The shops were
all shut, but I remembered that there was a nearly full tin in my
desk at the office, so I ran round there to fill my pouch. I am
always rather quiet in my movements, and perhaps, as it was late, I
may have moved, instinctively, more silently than usual. Moreover,
I still wore my rubber-soled boating-shoes. Well, I let myself in
with my key and entered the office, leaving the outer door ajar. As
I came in through the clerks' office I could see through the open
doorway that there was a light in Woodstock's office and that the
door of the strong-room was open. A good deal surprised at this, I
stopped and listened. There were sounds of someone moving about in
the strong-room, and I was on the point of going in to see who it
was when Hepburn came out with one of Hollis's boxes in his hand.
And at that moment the outer door blew-to with a bang.</p>

<p>"At the sound of the closing door Hepburn started and whisked
round to re-enter the strong-room. Then he saw me standing in the
dark office, and I shall never forget his look of terror. He turned
as white as a ghost and nearly dropped the box. Of course I sang
out to let him know who I was and apologized for giving him such a
start, but it was a minute or two before he recovered himself, and
when he did he was decidedly huffy with me for creeping in so
silently. His explanation of the affair was quite simple. He had
been up to London with Woodstock, who had stayed in town for the
night and had sent him down with a consignment of valuable
securities which the firm were taking charge of. Not liking to have
them in his personal possession, he had come on to the office to
deposit them in the strong-room; and then, while he was there, he
had taken the opportunity of checking Hollis's boxes, which he
informed me he was in the habit of doing periodically and usually
after office hours.</p>

<p>"The explanation was, as I have said, quite simple; indeed, no
explanation seemed to be called for. There was nothing in the least
abnormal about the affair. When I had once more apologized for the
fright that I had given him, I filled my pouch and we went away
together, and I dismissed the matter from my mind.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose I should ever have given the incident another
thought if nothing had occurred to remind me of it. The months went
by and it seemed to have passed completely out of my memory. Then
Hollis dropped his bomb-shell into the office. Some one among us,
he declared, had secretly opened his boxes and stolen his gems; and
until that somebody was identified, we were all more or less under
suspicion.</p>

<p>"Of course, Hepburn scouted the idea of there having been any
robbery at all, and so did Wampole. They both pointed to the
unbroken seals and declared that the thing was a physical
impossibility; and I should have been disposed to take the same
view, in spite of the strong evidence of the missing emerald. But
as soon as I heard the charge, that scene in the office came back
to me in a flash; and now, somehow, it did not look by any means so
natural and simple as it had at the time. I recalled Hepburn's
terrified stare at me; his pale face and trembling hands. Of
course, my sudden appearance must have been startling enough to
upset anyone's nerves; but it now seemed to me that his fright had
been out of all proportion to the cause.</p>

<p>"Then, when I came to think it over, the whole affair seemed
very characteristic of Hepburn; of his greed for money, his
slyness, his cunning, calculating ways. The property which had been
stolen was of great value, and I did not doubt that Hepburn would
have annexed it without a qualm if he could have done so with
complete safety. But it had been done so skilfully that the risk
had been almost entirely eliminated. It was a very clever robbery.
But for the merest chance the things would have gone back to
Hollis's cabinet unchallenged; and when they had been there a week
or two the issues would have become hopelessly confused. It would
have been impossible to say when or where the robbery had been
committed. The whole affair had been most cunningly planned and
neatly carried out. I felt that, if Hepburn had been the robber,
that was just the way in which he would have done it.</p>

<p>"Moreover, the robbery&mdash;if there had really been one, as I
had no doubt there had&mdash;seemed to lie between three, or at the
most, four of us: those who had easy access to the strong-room. But
of these Woodstock was out of the question, Wampole had practically
no access to the strong-room and was an old and trusted servant of
irreproachable character, and as I was out of it, there remained
only Hepburn. Whichever way I thought of the affair, everything
seemed to point to him, and whenever I thought of it the vision
came back to me of that scared figure standing by the the
strong-room door with the box of gems in his hand.</p>

<p>"But I need not go into any further detail. The bald fact is
that it appeared to me beyond a doubt that Hepburn was the thief,
and the only question was, what was to be done. The fat was in the
fire. The police would be called in. The stolen property would be
traced and the crime pretty certainly brought I home to Hepburn.
That was how I forecast the probable course of events.</p>

<p>"Now, if Hepburn had been a single man it would have been no
affair of mine. But he was my sister's husband and the father of my
two little nephews, who had been to me like my own children. If
Hepburn had been convicted of this crime, my sister's life would
have been absolutely wrecked. It would have broken her heart; and
as for the two little boys, their future would have been utterly
and irrevocably damned. I couldn't bear to think of it. But was
there any way out? It seemed to me that there was. I was a bachelor
with no home-ties but my sister and the kiddies. I had always had a
desire to travel and see the world. Well, now was the time. If I
cleared off to some out-of-the-way region, the dangerous inquiries
at the office would stop at once and the whole hue-and-cry would be
transferred to me. So I decided to go. And the place that I
selected as my destination was Adaffia, where I knew that an old
friend of Hepburn's had settled as a trader.</p>

<p>"But I thought I would take Hepburn into my confidence and give
him a chance of doing the same by me, only I am afraid I rather
muddled the business. The fact is that, when it came to the point,
I was a little shy of telling him exactly what was in my mind. It
is a delicate business, telling a man that you have discovered him
to be a thief. So I hummed and hawed and approached the subject
gradually by remarking that it looked as if there would be wigs on
the green presently. But that cat didn't jump. Hepburn declined to
admit that any robbery had occurred in the office. However, I
persisted that we should presently have the police buzzing about
the office and that then the position would become mighty
uncomfortable for some of us. Still, he professed to be&mdash;and,
of course, was&mdash;quite unconcerned; but when I went on to
suggest that if I took a little holiday the state of affairs at the
office would be made more comfortable for everybody, he stared at
me in astonishment, as well he might. Of course, I could think of
nothing but what I had seen that night when I caught him coming out
of the strong-room, and I took it for granted that he realized what
was in my mind, so that his astonishment didn't surprise me.</p>

<p>"'Wouldn't it look a bit queer if you went away just now?' he
asked.</p>

<p>"'That is just the point," I replied. 'I'll hop off, they will
leave the office alone and there will be no more trouble.'</p>

<p>"He seemed a good deal puzzled, but he didn't raise any
objections; and of course he did not make any confidences, which
again did not very much surprise me. He was the very soul of
caution and secretiveness.</p>

<p>"'Where did you think of going for your holiday?' he asked.</p>

<p>"I told him that I thought of running over to Adaffia to call on
Larkom, the trader there, and suggested that he should send Larkom
a letter introducing me. He didn't much like writing that letter,
and he liked it less when I mentioned that I proposed to travel
under the name of Walker. However, Larkom was an old friend whom he
knew that he could trust, so, in the end, he agreed to write the
letter. And that settled the affair. In due course I went off in
the comfortable belief that he understood the position exactly,
leaving him considerably surprised but quite confident that he knew
all about the robbery. It was a very pretty comedy of errors; but
it would have become a tragedy but for your wonderful insight and
for the strange chance that the results of your investigations
should have found their way into the newspapers. That is to say, if
it was a chance."</p>

<p>"It was not a chance," said Mr. Penfield. "As a matter of fact,
Dr. Thorndyke wrote out the account himself and broadcast it to all
the papers, including those of the United States."</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?" Betty inquired, with a glance of intense
curiosity at Thorndyke.</p>

<p>"For two reasons," the latter replied: "one obvious, the other
less so. In the first place, Osmond had been publicly accused, and
as there had been no trial, there had been no public withdrawal of
the accusation. But he was a man of honourable antecedents and
irreproachable character. Common justice demanded that his
innocence should be proclaimed at least as widely as had been the
presumption of his guilt. Even if he were dead, it was necessary
that his memory should be cleared of all reproach. But, in the
second place, it was not at all clear to me that he was dead."</p>

<p>"The deuce it wasn't!" exclaimed Osmond. "I thought I had
settled that question beyond any possible doubt. But you were not
satisfied?"</p>

<p>"No. The report which reached me was singularly unconvincing,
and there were certain actual discrepancies. Take first the general
appearance of the alleged occurrences; here is a man, a fugitive
from justice, whose purpose is to disappear. He lands at Adaffia
and in the course of a week or two is reported to have died. Now,
West Africa is a very unhealthy place, but people don't usually
drop down dead as soon as they arrive there. On the contrary. The
mortality among new-comers is quite small. Death is most commonly
due to the cumulative effects of repeated attacks of malaria and
does not ordinarily occur during the first year of residence.
Osmond's death under the circumstances alleged was not in agreement
with ordinary probabilities.</p>

<p>"Then the fact of death was not certified or corroborated. The
officer who reported it had not seen the body; he had only seen the
grave. But to a man of my profession, the uncorroborated grave of a
man who is admittedly trying to escape from the police is an object
of deep suspicion. The possibility of a sham burial was obvious.
This man, on leaving his home, had made a bee-line for Adaffia, an
insignificant village on the African coast the existence of which
was unknown to the immense majority of persons, including myself.
How came he to know of Adaffia? and why did he select it as a
hiding-place? The obvious answer suggested was that he had a friend
there. But as there was only one white man in the place&mdash;who
must have been that friend&mdash;a sham death and burial would have
been perfectly easy and a most natural expedient.</p>

<p>"Then there was the discrepancy. Osmond was reported to have
died of blackwater fever. Now, this was almost an impossibility.
Blackwater fever is not a disease which attacks new-comers. It lies
in wait for the broken-down coaster whose health has been sapped by
long-standing chronic malaria. In the immense majority of cases it
occurs during, or after the third year of residence. I have found
no record of a single case in which the patient was a new-comer to
the coast. It was this discrepancy that immediately aroused my
suspicions; and as soon as I came to consider the circumstances at
large, the other improbabilities came into view. The conclusion
that I arrived at was that there was a considerable probability
that the trader, Larkom, had carried out a sham burial; or, if it
it had really been a case of blackwater fever at Adaffia, the
victim was Larkom himself, and that a false name had been put on
the grave; in which case the man whom the officer saw must have
been Osmond. You will note the suspicious fact that the name on the
grave was 'John Osmond'&mdash;not 'Walker.' That impressed me very
strongly. It met the necessities of the fugitive so very
perfectly."</p>

<p>Osmond chuckled softly. "It seems to me, Dr. Thorndyke," said
he, "that you and I represent the two opposite extremes. You take
nothing for granted. You accept no statement at its face value. You
weigh, measure, and verify every item of evidence put to you.
Whereas I&mdash;well, I wonder what you think of me. I shan't be
hurt if you speak your mind bluntly."</p>

<p>"There is nothing in my mind," said Thorndyke, "by which you
need be hurt. It would, of course, be insincere to pretend that you
did not display very bad judgement in taking so momentous a course
of action on a mere, unconfirmed suspicion. But perhaps there are
qualities even more valuable than worldly wisdom, and certainly
more endearing; such as chivalry, generosity and
self-forgetfulness. I can only say that what you have told us as to
your motives has made my little service to you a great pleasure to
me; it has turned a mere technical success into a source of abiding
satisfaction&mdash;even though you did seek to defeat the ends of
justice."</p>

<p>"It is nice of you to say that, Dr. Thorndyke," Betty exclaimed
with brimming eyes. "After all, it is better to be generous than
discreet&mdash;at least, I think so; and I don't mind admitting
that I am proud to be the wife of a man who could cheerfully give
up everything for the good of his kinsfolk."</p>

<p>"I think," said Mr. Penfield, tapping his snuff-box by way of
emphasis, "you have very good reason to be proud of one
another."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Penfield," she replied, smilingly. "And that
brings me to what really was the object of our visit to-day. Only,
here I am in rather a difficulty. I am commissioned to give thanks
for all that has been done for us, and I really don't know how to
express one-half of what we feel."</p>

<p>"Is there any need?" said Thorndyke. "Mr. Penfield and I already
understand that you enormously overestimate your indebtedness to
us. Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Betty, "I will just say this. But for you,
Jack and I could never have been married. It was really you who
gave us to one another. We wish to say that we are extremely
pleased with your gift and we are very much obliged."</p>
