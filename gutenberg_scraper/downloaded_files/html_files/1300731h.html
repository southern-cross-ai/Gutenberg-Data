<p>Editor's Note:</p>
<p>This book is derived from parts of three separate works:</p>
<p class="sindent">1. Historical Records of Australia, Vol. VI.,
Aug. 1806-Dec. 1808 <small>INTRODUCTION</small>. by Frederick
Watson, Jan, 1916, [pp. v-xxxvii].</p>
<p class="sindent">2. Historical Records of New South Wales, Vol.
7 [Bligh-Macquarie, 1808-11] <small>INTRODUCTION</small>. by F.
M. Bladen, 1901, [pp. xxix to lx].</p>
<p class="sindent">3. Appendix to "History of New South Wales
From its First Discovery to the Present Time (1811)" by G
Paterson. Paterson's work was compiled from [earlier]
publications&mdash;Tench, Phillip's Voyage, Hunter, Collins,
Labillardiere's voyage, Tuckey's Port Phillip&mdash;with
plentiful extracts from the Trial of Colonel Johnston for
deposing Governor Bligh." [Barton, 1889]. These extracts were
derived from a book of J. Bartrum's notes, viz. <a href=
"#title">{here}</a>:</p>
<p class="sindent">"Proceedings of a General Court-Martial held
at Chelsea Hospital, which commenced on Tuesday, May 7, 1811, and
continued by Adjournment to Wednesday, 5th of June following, for
the Trial of Lieut.-Col. Geo. Johnston, Major of the 102nd
Regiment, late the New South Wales Corps, on a Charge of Mutiny,
Exhibited against him by the Crown, for deposing on the 26th of
January, 1808, William Bligh, Esq. F.R.S., Captain-General and
Governor-in-Chief of New South Wales. Taken in short hand by Mr.
Bartrum, of Clements' Inn, who attended on behalf of Governor
Bligh, by permission of the Court."</p>
<p>The Bartrum work occupies 409 pages, together with 75 pages of
Appendix, as against 92 similarly-sized pages in Paterson. The
witnesses for both sides, some of which were omitted from
Paterson's abstract, are listed in the present Contents page.</p>
<p>The trial was held over twelve days in 1811. The prosecution
took six days: 7th to 11th and 20th May; and the defence also
took six days: 23rd to 25th, 27th, and 30th to 31st May. Summing
up by both sides took place on 5th June, 1811.</p>
<p>The <i>question and answer</i> parts of the trial have been
rearranged and reformatted to more closely conform to present-day
court transcripts.</p>
<p>For the sake of uniformity, John Macarthur's surname is given
throughout as "Macarthur". He spelled his surname "M'Arthur" for
most of his life and his name is so spelled in Source 3 and in
Bartrum.</p>
<p>Many of the illustrations here are found in "Historical
Records of New South Wales", Vol. 6 [King-Bligh, 1806, 07, 08],
edited by F. M. Bladen, 1898].</p>

<h2><i>PART I.&mdash;THE PROTAGONISTS</i></h2>
<p align="center">[Source: Watson]<br>
<a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a></p>
<h3>BLIGH'S EARLY CAREER.</h3>
<p><small>AROUND</small> the story of the life of William Bligh
and of his administration of the government of New South Wales,
more romance and misrepresentation have gathered than around the
story of any other governor of the colony. The distortion of
facts has been due in part to bitter party animosities, already
prevalent in the colony, and in part to new antagonisms created
by the determined, somewhat tactless action of a rugged,
irascible nature. Throughout his life, Bligh possessed in a
remarkable degree the faculty of making bitter and vindictive
enemies. In the words of George Caley, he was "a man whom nature
has intended to be the subject of abuse."</p>
<p>Prior to accepting the government of New South Wales, Bligh
had spent his life in the navy. He was accustomed to the stern
realities of service on the quarter-deck of a ship of the line.
He was used to the rough manners of the navy and to the forceful
and virile speech of the period. At that time, the press gang and
its methods had full swing; stern measures were necessary to
repress the opposition of men impressed; floggings were frequent;
the seamen had long been restless, and this feeling had
culminated in the mutiny at the Nore; human life was thought
little of; men were punished severely for small offences;
commissions were readily obtainable by purchase. Life generally
was stern and hard. Men served their country in naval, military,
and civil capacities with a keen intensity; but at the same time
they sought with eagerness the emoluments and perquisites of
office.</p>
<p>The birth and parentage of William Bligh are obscure. His own
statement is not definite. He said* that he was born about 1753,
probably at Tinten or Tynten in the parish of St. Tudy, Cornwall,
and was the son of Charles and Margaret Bligh. Other accounts**
affirm that his birth took place at Plymouth on the 9th of
September, 1754, and that he was the son of John Bligh, of
Tretawne in the parish of St. Kew, Cornwall.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> R. Polwhele's "Biographical
Sketches in Cornwall", ii. 19.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>cf</i>. Maclean's "Deanery of Trigg
Minor."]</p>
<p>On the 1st of July, 1762, he entered the navy as captain's
servant to John Storr on the <i>Monmouth</i>, a ship of 60 guns,
and in that capacity served seven months and three weeks. After
his discharge his career is not known, until he shipped as A.B.
on the <i>Hunter</i> on the 27th of July, 1770. He was made
midshipman on the same ship on the 5th of February following, and
was transferred as midshipman to the <i>Crescent</i> on the 22nd
of September, 1771, and to the <i>Ranger</i> on the 2nd of
September, 1774. From the <i>Ranger</i> he was discharged on the
17th of March, 1776, and on the 1st of July in the same year was
appointed master of the sloop <i>Resolution</i>, under Captain
James Cook, for his third and last voyage of discovery. Bligh, in
his previous career, must have distinguished himself, for Cook
selected him for this expedition, and thought that he "could be
usefully employed in constructing charts." After the death of
Cook and the return of the <i>Resolution</i> to England, the crew
were paid off on the 24th of October, 1780. Under Admiral Parker,
Bligh was present at the battle off the Doggerbank on the 5th of
August, 1781. On the 5th of October following, he received his
commission as fifth lieutenant on the <i>Berwick</i>, and was
transferred to a similar rank in the <i>Princess Amelia</i> on
the 30th of December. On the 20th of March, 1782, he was
commissioned as sixth lieutenant on the <i>Cambridge</i>, and
fought under Lord Howe at Gibraltar.</p>
<p>On the 14th of January, 1783, Bligh was placed on the half-pay
list and obtained permission to seek employment in merchant
vessels. During the next four years he sailed several voyages to
different parts of the world. In a ship called the Britannia, he
sailed for Jamaica under employment to a Mr. Campbell, a West
Indian merchant. Fletcher Christian, afterwards leader of the
<i>Bounty</i> mutineers, was a member of the <i>Britannia</i>'s
crew. Bligh rated him as a gunner, but gave instructions that he
should be regarded as an officer. In the words of Edward Lamb,
second in command of the <i>Britannia</i>, Christian was very
indifferent in his duties, but Bligh treated him as a brother,
was "blind to his faults, and had him to dine and sup every other
day in the cabin."</p>
<p>Bligh returned from the West Indies on the 6th of August,
1787. During his absence, an expedition was organised with the
object of transplanting bread-fruit and other trees and plants
from the island of Otaheite to the West Indies. Sir Joseph Banks,
who, for reasons unknown, had become a great patron of Bligh, had
secured for him the command of this expedition. Accordingly,
Bligh was appointed lieutenant and commander of the
<i>Bounty</i>, an armed storeship of 215 tons, with a complement
of forty-five men. Bligh's final instructions were issued on the
20th of November, and he sailed from Spithead on the 23rd of
December, 1787. On the 26th of October, 1788, the <i>Bounty</i>
anchored in Matavai bay, Otaheite. She remained there until the
25th of December, when she was removed to the neighbouring
harbour of Toahroah. After securing the desired bread-fruit
trees, Bligh sailed on the return voyage on the 4th of April,
1789. Twenty-four days later, when near Tofoa in the Friendly
Islands, twenty-five of the crew, under the leadership of
Fletcher Christian, the master's mate, mutinied and seized the
ship.</p>
<p>Bligh and eighteen companions, provided with scanty
provisions, were cast adrift by the mutineers in the ship's
launch. In this open boat he successfully accomplished a daring
voyage of about 3,600 miles to Koepang in Timor, without charts
and through little known seas. At Timor, he purchased a small
schooner and sailed for Batavia. From Java, he travelled
<i>vi&acirc;</i> the Cape of Good Hope to England, and arrived at
Portsmouth on the 14th of March, 1790. In November of the same
year, he was tried and honourably acquitted by a court martial on
the loss of the <i>Bounty</i>.</p>
<p>The story of Bligh's wonderful voyage in an open boat, the
subsequent discovery of the survivor and descendants of the
mutineers on Pitcairn Island under romantic and idyllic
conditions. and the false use of the circumstances of the mutiny
made by Bligh's enemies to damage his reputation have all tended
to give an undue prominence to this minor episode in the history
of the navy. It has been frequently asserted that the mutiny was
due to the severity and harsh measures adopted by Bligh in his
command, but probably no more unjust charge could have been made.
Sworn testimonies * are extant which are directly contradictory
to this assertion. It is recorded that though, when things went
wrong, Bligh frequently damned his men, "<i>he was never angry
with a man the next minute</i>"; that he was not fond of
flogging, and that "some deserved hanging who had only a dozen";
and that he was a father to every person on the ship. Christian
received many special favours from Bligh. He was given the use of
Bligh's cabin and liquor; he was taught navigation and drawing;
he was asked to dine every third day with Bligh.</p>
<p class="foot">[* These are contained in the "Answer", published
in 1792 by Bligh in reply to Edward Christian's criticism.]</p>
<p>The actual causes of the mutiny were undoubtedly the
attractions to the toil-hardened sailors of a life of indolence
and sensuality at Otaheite. In his reports, Bligh mentioned these
as the cause of the mutiny. The amours of the staff and crew of
the <i>Endeavour</i>, when captain Cook visited the same island
in 1769, are well known, and a mutiny was narrowly averted on
that ship, the men having the same motives as Christian and his
colleagues. Christian was twenty-four years of age, and,
according to Lamb's testimony, during the voyage of the
<i>Britannia</i> he had shown that he "was then one of the most
foolish young men I ever knew in regard to the sex." In a
spurious account ** of Christian's travels, published in 1796,
the cause of the mutiny is indicated. It is stated that Bligh, on
his arrival at Otaheite, ordered the crew to be examined for
venereal disease, as "the ladies in this happy island are known
not to be the most reserved in granting their favours. . . . . .
. The women at Otaheite are not only constitutionally votaries of
Venus, but join to the charms of person such a happy cheerfulness
of temper and such engaging manners that their allurements are
perfectly irresistible." In the same book, testimony in Bligh's
favour is given: "At the same time, it is but justice that I
[Christian] should acquit Captain Bligh in the most unequivocal
manner of having contributed in the smallest degree to the
promotion of our conspiracy by any harsh or ungentleman-like
conduct on his part. So far from it that few officers in the
service, I am persuaded, can in this respect be found superior to
him, or produce stronger claims upon the gratitude and attachment
of the men whom they are appointed to command."</p>
<p class="foot">[** "The Voyages and Travels of Fletcher
Christian", etc., London, H. D. Symonds, 1796.]</p>
<p>After his return to England, the crew of the <i>Bounty</i> was
paid off on the 22nd of October, 1790, and Bligh was put on the
half-pay list with the rank of commander. Three weeks later he
was given the command of the <i>Falcon</i>, and on the 15th of
December he was promoted to the rank of captain. On the 7th of
January, 1791, he was again placed on the half-pay list. In the
meantime, a second expedition to obtain the bread-fruit trees
from Otaheite was organised. The ship <i>Providence</i>, of 24
guns, and the brig <i>Assistant</i>, as a tender, were selected,
and Bligh was appointed to the command on the 16th of April,
1791. The fact that Bligh was selected a second time for such a
command indicates that the Admiralty did not consider that his
conduct had contributed towards the mutiny. Bligh sailed from
England on the 2nd of August, 1791. He was successful in securing
the bread-fruit trees, and after landing some at Jamaica and some
at St. Vincent's, he returned to England on the 4th of August,
and the <i>Providence</i> was paid off on the 6th of September,
1793. For his services in successfully transplanting the
bread-fruit trees, Bligh was awarded the gold medal of the
Society of Arts.</p>

<b>Captain Bligh</b></p>
<br>
<p>During Bligh's absence eleven of the <i>Bounty</i> mutineers
had been brought to England and tried by court martial on the
12th to 18th of September, 1792. At this time strong efforts were
made by the friends of the mutineers to vilify Bligh's character.
Edward Christian, brother of the mutineer, wrote many letters to
the press alleging cruelty and harshness against Bligh in his
command, but at the court martial no evidence in proof of this
was tendered. Christian wrote a commentary on the court martial,
and this provoked a rejoinder from Bligh in a pamphlet * which he
published.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "An Answer to certain assertions", etc., by
Captain Wm. Bligh, London, 1792.]</p>
<p>Similar allegations were made against Bligh in his second
voyage. Matthew Flinders, who sailed as midshipman on the
<i>Providence</i>, stated that Bligh's harshness caused
discontent. The facts were that during the voyage from Otaheite a
shortage of water occurred; as the bread-fruit trees were the
primary object of the expedition, Bligh put the men on a short
allowance in order that the plants might be watered. Someone
secretly watered the plants with salt water, and Bligh threatened
to flog the ship's company. This incident is certainly
insufficient to justify the statement that Bligh's harshness
caused any permanent discontent. In a letter to the <i>Times</i>,
dated 16th July, 1794, Edward Harwood, the surgeon during the
voyage, wrote: "Captain Bligh's general conduct during the late
expedition, which was crowned with the most ample success, his
affability to his officers and humane attention to his men gained
him their high esteem and admiration, and must eventually
dissipate any unfavourable opinion hastily adopted in his
absence." This opinion is confirmed by a notice in the <i>Kentish
Register</i>, dated 6th September, 1793, which reported the
paying off of the crew of the Providence: "The high estimation in
which Captain Bligh was deservedly held by the whole crew was
conspicuous to all present. He was cheered on quitting the ship
to attend the Commissioner, and at the dock gates the men drew up
and repeated the parting acclamation."</p>
<p>The adverse criticism to which Bligh was subjected appears to
have had some influence on Lord Chatham, for he showed some
diffidence in receiving Bligh at the Admiralty. This feeling must
have been of short duration, for in 1794 Bligh was in service **
off Ushant in command of the <i>Warrior</i>, of 74 guns. On the
30th of April, 1795, he was commissioned as captain of the
<i>Calcutta</i>, and was employed in the North Sea with Admiral
Duncan's squadron. On the 7th of January, 1796, he was given the
command of the <i>Director</i>, of 64 guns. In this ship he was
present first at the mutiny of the Nore in 1797, where he
distinguished himself by his intrepidity and resourcefulness, and
later in the year at the battle of Camperdown. In that
engagement, the <i>Director</i> was in the larboard division of
Vice-Admiral Onslow's squadron, and first silenced and then
boarded the <i>Vryheid</i>, flagship of Admiral de Winter.</p>
<p class="foot">[** This service is not recorded at the
Admiralty. Between the 6th of September, 1793, and the 30th of
April, 1795, Bligh's name is on the half-pay list. It has been
generally accepted on Bligh's own statement.]</p>
<p>On the 3rd of July, 1800, the <i>Director</i> was paid off,
and Bligh placed on the half-pay list. In the following September
he was occupied in surveying the Irish coasts. On the 13th of
March, 1801, he was given the command of the <i>Glatton</i>, on
the 12th of April of the <i>Monarch</i>, and on the 8th of May of
the <i>Irresistible</i>. In the <i>Glatton</i>, he was present in
the action off Copenhagen, and for his services on that occasion
was personally thanked by Lord Nelson.</p>
<p>On the 21st of May, 1801, Bligh was elected a fellow of the
Royal Society. In the following year, Bligh was again put on the
half-pay list when the <i>Irresistible</i> was paid off on the
28th of May. On the 2nd of May, 1804, he was appointed to the
command of the <i>Warrior</i>, and was detailed for service in
the channel. Whilst in command of this ship, Bligh was tried by
court martial on charges preferred by his lieutenant. The latter
had been ordered on deck when suffering from an injury to the
foot. Bligh was acquitted by the court, but was cautioned to be
more careful in the use of his words.</p>
<p>Whilst in command of the <i>Warrior</i>, Bligh was offered and
accepted the government of New South Wales. The offer was
conveyed to him by Sir Joseph Banks in a letter, dated 15th
March, 1805. The fact that the salary attached to the
governorship was increased from &pound;1,000 to &pound;2,000
<i>per annum</i> proves that it was the desire of the government
to induce officers of a higher rank to accept the office. In his
letter to Bligh, Sir Joseph Banks stated: "In conversation, I was
this day asked if I knew a man proper to be sent out in his
[Governor King's] stead&mdash;one who has integrity unimpeached,
a mind capable of providing its own resources in difficulties
without leaning on others for advice, firm in discipline, civil
in deportment, and not subject to whimper and whine when severity
of discipline is wanted to meet emergencies. I immediately
answered: As this man must be chosen from among the post
captains, I know of no one but Captain Bligh who will suit."
Banks was not blind to the faults of his friends, for example the
irascibility of Governor King. But he sincerely held the highest
opinion of Bligh. What Bligh's enemies called unnecessary
harshness was regarded by Banks as necessary "severity of
discipline."</p>
<p>Bligh had been inured to the stern realities of exploring in
unknown seas during his voyage under Captain James Cook and in
the two expeditions under his own leadership. His long experience
on the quarter-decks amidst the hardships of naval warfare had
hardened him. In consequence, Bligh was a strict disciplinarian,
and unfortunately had acquired an exaggerated coarseness of
speech, which rebuffed an importunate petitioner, made him a man
of few friends, and gave his enemies an opportunity to cavil. He
was a fellow of the Royal Society, and a man of varied and
considerable attainments, if it is possible to judge from the
books he requisitioned for use at the government house in Sydney.
Apart from the standard legal, geographical, and historical
works, these included such varied books as Malthus on Population,
Fontana on Venoms and Poisons, Dickson's System of Agriculture,
Cooper's complete Distiller, Emmerson's Mechanics, Kiel's
Astronomy, and a work on experimental researches in permanent
dyes. The appointment of Bligh to the government of New South
Wales placed a martinet in command of a colony whose inhabitants,
during the thirteen years since the departure of Governor
Phillip, had developed habits of unbridled license. Governor
Hunter had attempted to stem the torrent, and had failed.
Governor King had announced drastic reforms which he had proved
unable to carry out. Governor Bligh was sent out with
instructions to curb the will of a people who had become
emboldened by their previous success, and his failure was perhaps
almost inevitable. It was impossible for the efforts of any
governor to be crowned with success until the disturbing
elements, the New South Wales Corps and its partisans, were
removed.</p>
<p>Bligh sailed from England on board the transport
<i>Sinclair</i> in February, 1806, under the convoy of H.M.S.
<i>Porpoise</i>, commanded by Joseph Short. During the voyage
many disputes arose between Short and Bligh, and Bligh's
participation in them was criticised adversely by the secretary
of state.* On an examination of the evidence given at the
inquiries ** held in Sydney in connection with Short's conduct,
it is clear that his command was irregular and that he was a
difficult man to work with. It is probable that in the disputes
with Bligh, his superior officer, Short was in the wrong,
notwithstanding the criticism of the secretary of state.</p>

<h3>JOHNSTON BEFORE BLIGH.</h3>
<p><small>GEORGE JOHNSTON</small> was born at Annandale,
Dumfrieshire, Scotland, on the 19th of March, 1764. On the 6th of
March, 1776, he obtained a commission as second lieutenant of the
45th company of marines. During the years 1777 and 1778, he was
stationed at New York and Halifax. On the 27th of April, 1778, he
was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in the 91st company.
In the years 1779 and 1780, he was employed recruiting in
England. In 1781, he was despatched to the East Indies, and
remained there until December, 1785. During this period he served
on board H.M. ships <i>Sultan</i> and <i>Worcester</i>, and on
four occasions was in action with the French fleet. In one
engagement, he was severely wounded. He served under Earl Percy,
who, after succeeding to the dukedom of Northumberland, became a
patron of Johnston. In January, 1786, he obtained leave of
absence for six months, and on resuming duty was attached to
headquarters. Towards the end of the year, he was transferred as
first lieutenant to the detachment of marines intended to form
the garrison for the settlement at Botany Bay. In December, he
embarked on board the <i>Lady Penrhyn</i>, a transport in the
first fleet. When Governor Phillip examined Port Jackson in
January, 1788, it is claimed that Johnston was the first man to
land in that harbour. During the first twelve months of the
settlement, Johnston acted as adjutant of orders to Governor
Phillip. After the death of captain Shea, on the 2nd of February,
1789, he received the command of the vacant company as
captain-lieutenant. In 1790, he was in command of the marines on
detached duty at Norfolk Island. In 1791, the detachment of
marines was relieved by the New South Wales Corps, and at the
same time was given the option of being discharged or of
remaining in the colony. Many availed themselves of the
privilege, and were enlisted in an auxiliary or fifth company in
the corps. Johnston, who had returned from Norfolk Island with
the marines, took command of this company, and a commission as
captain was issued to him on the 25th of September, 1792. He was
one of the first land-owners from the class of officers, and was
granted 100 acres at Annandale by lieutenant-governor Grose on
the 12th of February, 1793. In January, 1796, he was nominated by
Governor Hunter to relieve Philip Gidley King in the command at
Norfolk Island, but owing to ill-health he was unable to fulfil
this duty. In the following September he was appointed
aide-de-camp to the governor. In 1800, Johnston received his
brevet rank as major. In the same year he was placed under arrest
by lieutenant-colonel Paterson on charges of "paying spirits to a
serjeant as part of his pay at an improper price, contempt, and
disobedience of orders." He protested against trial by court
martial in the colony, and his objection was upheld by Governor
Hunter, who, in consequence, ordered him to England under arrest.
He sailed in October, 1800, on H.M.S. <i>Buffalo</i>. In England
his trial was quashed.* He returned to the colony on the 14th of
December, 1801, on board the transport <i>Minorca</i>, but it was
not until the 17th of October, 1802, that he was released from
arrest and his reconciliation with lieutenant-colonel Paterson
was announced.**</p>

<br>
<p>In January, 1803, Johnston took the temporary command of the
New South Wales Corps during the illness of lieutenant-colonel
Paterson. At this time inquiries and courts martial were being
held in connection with certain libellous pipes about Governor
King which had been circulated. These involved the governor in
serious disputes with the military. During a court martial on
Anthony Fenn Kemp, of which Johnston was president, John Harris,
the judge-advocate and prosecutor, was charged with "scandalous
infamous behaviour" in disclosing the votes of members at
previous courts martial. Thereupon the court martial on Kemp was
adjourned, and the trial of Harris demanded by Johnston.*** The
results of this action seriously interfered with the
administration of the colony, and a bitter correspondence ****
ensued. Johnston demanded the appointment of a judge-advocate in
place of Harris. This request was strongly resisted by King, but
he ultimately gave way "to Secure the Peace of the Colony by the
Criminal Courts not continuing suspended for want of Members to
compose it and on no other consideration." This conflict between
the military and King has a remarkable similarity to the final
dispute between the military and Bligh. The action taken by
Johnston was extremely doubtful. The papers that are available do
not demonstrate how far his action was due to his personal
initiative, how far to the instigation of a party behind him, as
the papers in his actions against Bligh do.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>See</i> page 177, volume IV.]      [****
<i>See</i> page 177 <i>et seq.</i>, volume IV.]</p>
<p>In March, 1804, Johnston commanded the military sent in
pursuit of the convicts who had risen in rebellion at Castle
Hill. He acted with great courage and daring when he encountered
the rebels at Vinegar Hill, and completely routed them. When
lieutenant-colonel Paterson was detailed for the command of the
settlement at Port Dalrymple, in 1804, the command of the New
South Wales Corps devolved on Johnston, and he retained it until
the arrival of lieutenant-colonel Foveaux, on the 28th of July,
1808. On the 1st of January, 1806, he received his commission as
major.</p>

<h3>BLIGH'S GOVERNORSHIP.</h3>
<p><small>GOVERNOR BLIGH</small> arrived off Port Jackson on the
6th of August, 1806, and made his official landing at 11 a.m. on
the 8th. He assumed the government on the 13th, and his
commission as captain-general and governor-in-chief was read with
full ceremony in front of government house at noon on that
day.<br></p>
<p align="center"><a name="img-05" id="img-05"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<b>Plan of the Town of Sydney in New South Wales, October, 1807,
by order of Governor Bligh</b></p>
<br>
<p>Bligh resided in Sydney as governor-elect for four days, and
during that time he took the extraordinary action * of accepting
land grants from the retiring governor, Philip Gidley King. On
the 10th of August, 1806, three grants were given by King to
Bligh. The first, "for a private residence near Sydney",
consisted of 240 acres to be known by the name of Camperdown.
This land adjoined the Grose Farm on the south side of the
Parramatta-road, and now forms the suburb of Camperdown. The
second "for a private residence near Parramatta" comprised 105
acres, to be known by the name of Mount Betham. It lay on the
north side of the river at the town of Parramatta. The third,
"for a private residence between Sydney and Hawkesbury",
comprised 1,000 acres, to be known as Copenhagen, and lay on the
south-western side of the Hawkesbury road in the neighbourhood of
Rouse hill. The subsequent history of the grant at Parramatta
illustrates the opinion held on these transactions. After Bligh's
death, these lands were inherited by his six daughters as
co-heiresses. In 1840, the validity of the grants was questioned,
and a suit for impeachment was threatened. Action was avoided by
the surrender to the crown of the grant at Parramatta on
condition that legal proceedings with a view to the impeachment
of all three grants should be abandoned. This surrender was
completed on the 24th of February, 1841, by Sir Maurice
O'Connell, who had married Mrs. Mary Putland, one of Bligh's
daughters. The acceptance of a compromise by the crown, instead
of full impeachment of all three grants, indicates that there was
an element of doubt as to the validity of the grants. At the same
time it seems strange that there should have been a delay of so
many years before any definite action was taken.</p>
<p>The grant of 790 acres to be known as "Thanks" to Mrs. Anna
Josepha King, the wife of Governor King, by Governor Bligh on the
1st of January, 1807, has been discussed in a previous
volume.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page xv, volume IV.]</p>
<p>Soon after his assumption of the government, Bligh had
experience of the party feeling current in the colony. On the
14th of August, 1806, an address ** of welcome was presented to
him, signed by George Johnston for the military, Richard Atkins
for the civil, and John Macarthur for the free inhabitants. Bligh
accepted this address in good faith, but in the following month
addresses *** were presented to him from the free inhabitants at
Sydney and the Hawkesbury. In these addresses the validity of
Macarthur's signature was repudiated, the Sydney settlers stating
"had we deputed anyone, John Macarthur would not have been chosen
by us, we considering him an unfit person to step forward upon
such an occasion, as we may chiefly attribute the rise in the
price of mutton to his withholding the large flock of wethers he
now has to make such price as he may choose to demand."</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>See</i> page 566.]      [*** <i>See</i>
pages 568 and 570.]</p>
<p>Philip Gidley King sailed from Port Jackson in H.M.S.
<i>Buffalo</i> on the 10th of February, 1807. During these first
six months of his administration Bligh attempted no reforms, but
devoted himself to the task of acquiring a full acquaintance with
the general condition of the colony. He called for reports on the
public buildings, on the administration of the commissariat, and
on the state of agriculture and the colony generally. Through no
fault of his own, however, Bligh encountered opposition from the
commencement of his administration. Within a fortnight of his
arrival Bligh was presented with private letters written by under
secretary Cooke, stating the intentions of Lord Camden to
authorise grants of 600 acres to Joseph Short, commander of
H.M.S. <i>Porpoise</i>, and of 1,000 acres to John Townson, a
retired captain of the N.S.W. Corps. As neither Governor King nor
himself had received "any authority according to the tenor of Mr.
Cooke's letter", Bligh refused to make the grants, and on the
26th of August, 1806, wrote to the secretary of state for
instructions. At the same time he authorised the applicants "to
look out for the respective tracts they would approve of", which
would be granted to them when he "received directions to locate
the same." The neglect of the department to give orders to Bligh
was unfortunate for Joseph Short, as he had brought out a
considerable investment to be utilised on his anticipated
grant.</p>
<p>During these first six months Bligh experienced considerable
difficulty in the naval administration owing to the conduct of
Short, which necessitated the holding of two courts of inquiry.*
These resulted in Short being sent to England under arrest for
trial by court martial on charges preferred by his lieutenant. At
the time of the court martial Bligh's refusal to give Short a
land grant, a refusal which was perfectly justified, although it
entailed considerable loss to Short, was utilised by Bligh's
enemies to vilify his administration.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 44 <i>et seq.</i> and page 65
<i>et seq.</i>]</p>
<p>Although Bligh's administration and character were represented
falsely on many occasions, the exchange of land grants with
Governor King and the development of Bligh's farm at the
Hawkesbury admit fairly of adverse criticism. On the 1st of
January, 1807, Bligh purchased some land at the Hawkesbury.**
Andrew Thompson acted as Bligh's overseer. If the evidence of
Thompson in a sworn deposition *** can be relied upon, Bligh
erected buildings on his farm of the value of &pound;1,000 at the
cost of the crown; he employed twenty to thirty convicts
victualled by the crown; he drew on the public stores at the
Hawkesbury for articles for his private use; he stocked his farm
by drawing animals heavy with young from the public herds, and
after the young were born the mothers were returned without their
progeny. Bligh and Thompson **** assert that the undertaking was
of the nature of an experimental farm designed to demonstrate the
value of industry and good management under conditions prevalent
in the colony. If this was so, the experiment was valueless, for
Bligh gave himself concessions far in excess of those proposed
for settlers,***** and Thompson admitted this in the statement
****** "that a common Farmer, who has to pay for everything,
would by no means have such profits." Thompson asserted that the
live stock and articles drawn from the public herds and stores
were to be paid for in the produce of the farm. At that time very
extended credits were given to settlers by government. As Bligh
purchased his farm in January, 1807, and he was deposed in
January, 1808, it is clear that the average duration of his
credit did not exceed six months, and this was not excessive.
Because Bligh had paid nothing into the public stores in return
for goods and stock delivered before January, 1808, it is unfair
to assume that he did not intend to pay anything. It is not
possible, therefore, to accept the charge put forward by the
insurrectionaries that Bligh was guilty of conversion of public
property to private uses. At the same time it was a grave error
of judgment and utterly indefensible for a governor to engage in
farming, which secured a pecuniary profit to himself in his
private capacity, when the success of the enterprise was
dependent largely on concessions granted by himself in his
official capacity.</p>

<br>
<b>Plan shewing Locality of Governor Bligh's Farm</b></p>
<br>
<p>On the 14th of February, 1807, Governor Bligh initiated his
first big reform by the publication of a general order which
prohibited absolutely "the exchange of spirits or other liquors
as payment for grain, animal food, labour, wearing apparel or any
other commodity whatever." Severe penalties were ordered for
offences against this regulation; for a prisoner, the punishment
was 100 lashes and hard labour for twelve months; for a settler,
free by servitude, pardon, or emancipation, deprivation of all
indulgences from the crown, imprisonment for three months, and a
fine of &pound;20; for all other persons, deprivation of all
indulgences from the crown and a fine of &pound;50. This
regulation was the first indirect cause which led to the
deposition of Bligh. Although a wise and salutary measure, it
operated adversely against the pecuniary interests of all classes
of the community. John Macarthur and William Minchin admitted in
their evidence at the court martial on George Johnston that
everyone in the colony, officials, military, and all others,
trafficked in spirits by necessity for want of a proper currency.
Spirits were imported at a few shillings per gallon, and were
bartered at 100 to 200 <i>per cent</i>. profit. Imported spirits
were distributed according to the rank and influence of the
individual, and it is clear that the senior officials and most
favoured individuals reaped the greater profit. The colonists in
general lacked the public spirit that should have won support for
this well-advised reform, while pecuniary loss provoked
opposition that was active though secret. Lieutenant-colonel
Foveaux stated * that the result of the restrictions was to make
"the gentleman and the Man of character, who would blush at being
detected in an illicit transaction, the tributaries of the daring
and unprincipled Smuggler and distiller." This testimony from
Foveaux, who was an open antagonist of Bligh, indicates the
peculiar attitude of many colonists who were opposed to Bligh.
Although unwilling to commit a breach of the regulations openly,
they connived at and participated in the profits of an illicit
traffic. As in the case of the abolition of slavery by the
British Parliament, and in the case of the prohibition of Kanaka
labour on the Queensland sugar plantations, the pecuniary
interest of the individual had been injured in the endeavour to
procure the welfare of the community at large.</p>

<h3>MACARTHUR AND BLIGH.</h3>
<p><small>ON</small> the 9th of March, 1807, the ship
<i>Dart</i>, belonging to John Macarthur and Messrs. Hulletts, of
London, arrived in Port Jackson. In her two stills were imported;
one had been sent out to the order of captain Abbott, and the
second had been consigned to John Macarthur by his agent, who
acted also for Abbott. The second still had been sent out without
Macarthur's foreknowledge. Bligh ordered these stills into the
public stores to be returned to England. This action produced no
opposition, although it had important consequences at a later
date.</p>
<p>The first open and active opposition to Bligh was shown by
John Macarthur. It arose out of a verdict given by Bligh sitting
in the court of appeal. It had been the practice in giving
promissory notes to express payment in some form of barter, owing
to the lack of specie. Wheat notes were given as follows: the
sterling value of the note was divided by the current selling
price of a bushel of wheat, and the note made out for the
corresponding number of bushels. The value of wheat naturally
fluctuated. At the Hawkesbury, it had been fixed at 9s. 3d. per
bushel by general order in January, 1806. Owing to the severe
losses by floods in March, 1806, the government price offered in
the December following was 13s. 9d. In June, 1807, private sales
were transacted at 28s. Macarthur held a wheat note given by
Andrew Thompson at prices current before the flood. On this note,
Macarthur sued in the civil court for the specific performance of
the contract on the basis of the bushels of wheat expressed. The
court gave the decision that the note was an expression of value
and not of quantity of produce. Against this verdict Macarthur
appealed in July, 1807, and Bligh dismissed the appeal without
hearing the appellant. By this decision, Macarthur was compelled
to accept a reduction in the number of bushels expressed in the
note <i>pro rata</i> with the increased price of wheat between
the dates on which the bill was drawn and on which it was
liquidated. Thereafter, Macarthur ceased to visit at government
house. The governor showed no resentment of this action, and
subsequently called on Macarthur when he was reported to be
ill.</p>

<br>
<b>John Macarthur</b></p>
<br>
<p>In July, 1807, D'Arcy Wentworth, an assistant surgeon, was
tried by a court martial for contempt and disobedience of orders
on the complaint of captain Abbott. The court, under the
presidency of major Johnston, found him guilty and sentenced him
to be publicly reprimanded. On the 23rd of July, Wentworth was
ordered to return to his duties, but two days later was suspended
from office by orders of the governor. Wentworth immediately made
application to Bligh for the reasons of his suspension; and when
these were refused he sought permission to visit England, but
this request was also refused. Bligh had caused a private inquiry
* into the conduct of Wentworth, and he transmitted the charges
to England without giving Wentworth the opportunity of making any
reply. This action of Bligh was manifestly unjust. The court
martial had been instigated by one of the military party, and it
is probable that Bligh's inquiries arose out of the trial.
However, the military party, after the arrest of Bligh, took up
Wentworth's cause, when he was tried and honourably acquitted by
court martial.** Wentworth's suspension provoked his bitter
hostility to Bligh.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 188.]      [** <i>See</i> page
446 <i>et seq.</i>]</p>
<p>In the meantime, Bligh had been making inquiries into the land
tenures in the town of Sydney. He submitted a lengthy report on
the subject in his despatch, dated 31st October, 1807. Bligh
noted irregularities in many of the leases,*** and on the 23rd of
July issued a general order directing six named persons to quit
and remove their houses from lands adjoining government house on
or before the 1st of November following. These persons had
received permissive occupancies from Governor King. Amongst other
leases adversely commented on in his despatch there was a lease
to John Macarthur, near St. Phillip's church. This lease was
dated 1st January, 1806, but Bligh asserted **** that it was
given after the 12th of July, 1806, which statement is probably
correct.***** It is very likely that this and other leases were
given by King as a <i>placebo</i> to some of his active
opponents. Bligh prevented Macarthur taking possession of the
lease, as it encroached on the church lands.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>See</i> note 38.]      [**** <i>See</i>
page 424.]      [***** <i>See</i> note 128.]</p>
<p>In October, 1807, Bligh was again in open conflict with
Macarthur. Bligh gave orders that the complete stills, which had
been imported in the <i>Dart</i>, should be shipped on the
<i>Duke of Portland</i> for their return to England. After their
arrival the coppers had been removed to Macarthur's house to
unpack the sundries which they contained, and had not been
returned to the public store. When he heard of Bligh's orders,
Macarthur endeavoured to obtain permission to sell the complete
stills to some ship going to India or China, or, if this was
objected to, to retain the copper only for domestic use. These
requests were ignored. After some petty objections raised by
Macarthur, the coppers were removed from the house of Garnham
Blaxcell, Macarthur's partner, under the superintendence of
Robert Campbell, junior, acting by the orders of the naval
officer, but without the consent of Macarthur. Macarthur at once
brought an action * against Campbell, junior, for wrongful
seizure of his property, and secured a majority verdict in his
favour on the ground that Campbell, junior, held no official
status. The vindictive words used by Macarthur in his address to
the court indicate that it was a malicious prosecution directed
at Bligh. The deportation of the stills was justified fully, and
the only error was committed by the naval officer when he
directed his nephew, R. Campbell, junior, to remove the coppers,
instead of personally superintending.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 174.]</p>
<p>In the more important of his official acts, Bligh had been in
the right. But in smaller matters he had acted unwisely, and his
conduct had caused offence. By this time, there had developed,
especially amongst the military, a feeling of rancour and
bitterness. This was due to small causes, to his coarseness of
speech, to the directness of his remarks, and to his disregard
for the feelings of others. Major Johnston, in October, 1807,
wrote to the military secretary of the Duke of York, and asked
him to intervene between the governor and the commanding officer
of the military. Johnston complained of Bligh's "interfering in
the interior management of the Corps by selecting and ordering
both officers and men on various duties without my knowledge; his
abusing and confining the soldiers without the smallest
provocation and without ever consulting me as their commanding
officer; and again, his casting the most unreserved and
opprobrious censure on the Corps at different times in company at
Government House." Johnston was of a pacific nature, but it is
clear that he was antagonised by the manners which Bligh had
learnt on the quarter-deck.</p>
<p>Prior to the arrival of the schooner <i>Parramatta</i>, at the
end of November, Bligh had acquired an unenviable position. John
Macarthur and D'Arcy Wentworth were his open enemies; George
Johnston, John Harris, William Minchin, and the military
generally were in covert antagonism to him; many of the merchants
were opposed to him owing to restriction of their trade. On the
other hand, the middle and lower orders of settlers were warmly
attached to him on account of his actions for their relief after
the Hawkesbury floods. In the meantime Bligh's enemies in England
had not been idle. The opposition commenced by the friends of the
mutineers of the <i>Bounty</i> had been continued. In Bligh's
absence, many calumnies had been circulated, just as had happened
under the administration of governors Hunter and King. Short had
obtained a hearing, and his reports had gained credence to
Bligh's prejudice. Bligh was accused of selling provisions at
high prices for his own emolument during the scarcity in the
colony. An agitation for Bligh's recall was commenced, and
Francis Grose, who had become a general, was suggested openly as
his successor. As the appointment of Grose would have thrown the
colony entirely into the hands of the military, it is highly
probable that the agitation was originated by the friends of the
military party in New South Wales. The opinion held in the office
of the secretary of state is unknown, but the extent of the
agitation may be gathered by the fact that the <i>Morning
Herald</i> on the 1st of February, 1808, actually announced the
recall of Bligh. This was incorrect.</p>

<h3>EVENTS LEADING TO THE INSURRECTION.</h3>
<p><small>IN</small> June, 1807, the schooner <i>Parramatta</i>,
which belonged to John Macarthur and Messrs. Hulletts, of London,
had cleared for Otaheite. John Hoare, a convict for life,
secreted himself on board her, and at Otaheite escaped in the
<i>General Wellesley</i> to India. By the port regulations, the
master of every vessel at Port Jackson had to give security,
himself in &pound;800 and two inhabitants in &pound;50 each, not
to carry off any person without the governor's sanction.
Macarthur and his partner, Garnham Blaxcell, were the bondsmen
for the <i>Parramatta</i>. When the schooner returned in
November, 1807, the naval officer sued for the amount of the bond
in the civil court, and it was decided that the bond was
forfeited. An appeal against this verdict was entered. In the
meantime the naval officer refused to allow the vessel to be
entered, retained the ship's papers, and placed two police
officers on board in charge. Macarthur deeply resented this, and
on the 7th of December notified * the master and crew of the
schooner that he had abandoned her, and that they were no longer
to expect pay or provisions. Seven days later the master and crew
came on shore, and made affidavits ** at the judge-advocate's
office that they had left the ship on account of Macarthur's
action. These affidavits were necessary, as it was contrary to
the port regulations for seamen to remain on shore in Sydney. Up
to this moment Macarthur was wholly in the wrong, and
deliberately set the law at defiance. The decision of the civil
court for the forfeiture of the bonds was given on a question of
fact. The naval officer was justified in holding the schooner
until the penalties were liquidated. The lodging of an appeal
could have had only the object of delay. No fact justified
Macarthur in abandoning the schooner and forcing the crew to
commit a breach of the port regulations.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 295.]      [** <i>See</i> page
307.]</p>
<p>Acting under instructions from Bligh, judge-advocate Atkins
wrote * on the same day (14th December) to summon Macarthur to
appear on the following day and answer for his conduct. Macarthur
somewhat contemptuously declined to appear.** This was an error
of judgment on the part of Macarthur, though strictly within his
legal rights. The letter was virtually a command from the
representative of the King, and certainly should not have been
resented by him. On the 15th of December Atkins issued a warrant
*** for the arrest of Macarthur, and according to Atkins'
evidence, Bligh approved of his action. In issuing this warrant,
Atkins was wrong. The letter to Macarthur was not a summons, and,
until a legal summons had been served and ignored, no warrant for
Macarthur's arrest should have been issued. Bligh had the
misfortune of having a man as his legal adviser who was untrained
in the law and addicted to alcoholic excess.**** The warrant was
served by a constable. Macarthur spurned the constable, told him
that he would never submit until he was forced, and added that
Bligh and his friends would soon make a rope to hang themselves.
This action was an open defiance of the civil power. On the
following day a bench of magistrates,***** which included major
Johnston, decided that a second warrant should be issued for his
arrest. This was executed, and Macarthur was brought before
Atkins and admitted to bail. On the 17th of December, he was
again brought before a bench of magistrates,****** consisting of
the judge-advocate, John Palmer, and two of the military party,
George Johnston and Edward Abbott. By this bench he was committed
to take his trial before the criminal court, and was admitted to
bail.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 307.]      [** <i>See</i> page
296.]      [*** <i>See</i> page 310.]<br>
<br>
[**** <i>See</i> page 150.]      [***** <i>See</i> page
312.]      [****** <i>See</i> page 314.]</p>
<p>The court of criminal jurisdiction did not meet until the 25th
of January, 1808, but in the interval Macarthur was not idle.
Four days after his committal he called upon Atkins for payment
of a bill drawn in 1793. When payment was not made, he applied to
Bligh for relief in a memorial,* dated 29th December, and in
reply was informed "that a Court of Civil Jurisdiction is open to
take cognizance of all Civil Actions." He repeated his
applications to the governor without success on the 1st and 12th
of January.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 231.]</p>
<p>Macarthur then attempted to make use of his lease near St.
Phillip's church, which had been submitted by Bligh to the
consideration of the secretary of state. For this purpose he
engaged some soldiers of the New South Wales Corps to erect a
fence around the allotment, which included a public well. Bligh
was compelled publicly to put a stop to this work.</p>
<p>On the 20th of January Macarthur made a strong effort ** to
obtain a copy of his indictment, but this request was refused.
Two days later, when the members of the criminal court had been
nominated, he wrote a letter *** to Bligh protesting against
Atkins sitting as judge-advocate. In reply, he was told that the
law must take its course. In this action, Macarthur was clearly
in the wrong. At the trial of major Johnston in England in 1811,
the judge-advocate general stated that "it was perfectly
incompetent to any person brought before that Court to offer a
challenge against the Judge-Advocate sitting upon it; he might as
well offer a challenge against a Judge in this country sitting at
the Assizes. The Governor has no more right to change the
Judge-Advocate who sits upon that Court than he has to change a
Judge in England or anywhere else."</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>See</i> page 228.]      [*** <i>See</i>
page 229.]<br></p>
<p>There is no doubt that Macarthur, prior to his trial, had
determined to force a crisis with Bligh. Whether the actual
usurpation of the government had been determined will probably
never be known. There are indications that some conspiracy was on
foot. On the 11th of January the removal of captain Abbott from
his command at Parramatta to headquarters was proposed. Abbott
was a magistrate, and this change would have given the military
party a preponderancy on the bench of magistrates at Sydney. This
plan was checkmated by Bligh, who sanctioned the change to take
place on the 27th of January, but dispensed with Abbott's
services as a magistrate. Abbott, in a private letter to Philip
Gidley King, dated 13th February, 1808, stated that he had
advised major Johnston that, in the event of taking the step to
arrest Bligh, to send for lieutenant-governor Paterson, then
stationed at Port Dalrymple, immediately afterwards. As Abbott
was at Parramatta on the 26th of January, it is clear that this
advice must have been given previously, and that the decision to
make the arrest was not the mere impulse of the moment. Abbott,
however, did not confirm this statement in his evidence at the
trial of Johnston. At that trial Bligh swore that the screws were
taken out of the breeches of the two field pieces at government
house on the night of the 25th of January. Private Gillard swore
that he removed the elevating screws from the same guns a few
days before the 26th of January, by order of lieutenant Minchin.
On the 24th of January, Edward and Hannibal Macarthur, Nicholas
Bayly, and Garnham Blaxcell (Macarthur's two bailsmen), and the
six officers who were nominated for the criminal court on the
following day, all dined together at a mess dinner of the New
South Wales Corps. John Macarthur was not present at the dinner,
but spent the evening walking to and fro on the parade in front
of the mess-room. It seems highly probable that the usurpation
was the result of a well-considered plan, in which the prime
mover was John Macarthur; that major Johnston was the passive
figure-head of a more active and energetic party behind him; that
many of the malcontents against Bligh were averse to extreme
measures; and that the trial of Macarthur was made the cause of
action by the prisoner and his immediate adherents to force
Bligh's hands and to implicate the waverers and provoke them to
take a decisive step.</p>
<p>The criminal court met for the trial of Macarthur * in the
morning of the 25th of January. The members were the
judge-advocate and six military officers. As was the custom, the
oath was administered to the six officers by the judge-advocate,
but, before Atkins had taken his oath, Macarthur entered a
protest against him sitting as judge-advocate. The letters patent
constituting the courts of justice enacted that the criminal
court should consist of the judge-advocate for the time being and
six officers of his Majesty's sea or land forces. These were one
and indivisible. Until all the members of the court were sworn
in, no legal court was constituted. The six officer members of
the court therefore could only hear the protest in a private
capacity, as they had no judicial standing until the court was
legally complete. As has already been stated, no protest could
stand, and the governor had no power to remove or supersede the
judge-advocate. Before the meeting of the court, Macarthur was in
possession of Bligh's opinion ** on the merits of a protest
against Atkins, and he knew that it would not be entertained. In
the deliberations of a criminal court, the judge-advocate acted
as an exponent of the law to his colleagues, but in the
consideration of the verdict his vote was equal only to that of
any other member of the court. As six of the seven members of the
court were military officers, and probably in sympathy with him,
Macarthur had little reason to fear the verdict. The only
inference that can be drawn from these facts is that Macarthur,
in making this irregular protest, deliberately attempted to upset
the administration of the colony, to force an immediate issue
with Bligh, and to implicate openly the members of the court in
an illegal procedure. It is probable that this action was taken
on Macarthur's initiative, with the connivance of the extremist
members of the military party. For some months previously, it
must be remembered, Macarthur was not on terms of intimacy with
Johnston and several of the senior officers.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 221 <i>et seq.</i>]      [**
<i>See</i> page 229.]</p>
<p>At this stage, Bligh sought the advice of major Johnston, and
at 5.30 p.m. on the 25th of January wrote requesting to see him
without delay. Johnston sent a verbal message in reply that he
was too unwell to attend. He had been present at the mess dinner
on the night before, and had met with an accident on his return
to Annandale. It is recorded that his face was much bruised and
his arm in a sling for several days, and it is probable that a
temporary incapacity was serious enough to affect Johnston's
judgment for the time.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 26th of January, Macarthur was
arrested and lodged in gaol on a warrant, issued by Atkins,
Arndell, Campbell, and Palmer, for his alleged escape from the
custody of the provost-marshal. Probably the magistrates were
wrong in issuing this warrant. Macarthur's bailsmen were
responsible for his appearance before the criminal court. As no
criminal court had yet been legally formed, it is probable that
technically Macarthur had not surrendered to his bail, was not in
the custody of the provost-marshal, and that his bailsmen were
still responsible for his appearance.</p>
<p>At 10 o'clock the six members of the criminal court met, and
forwarded to Bligh Macarthur's protest against Atkins and their
own protest against the imprisonment of Macarthur. Bligh did not
reply to these letters, and at 3 o'clock the members adjourned.
Shortly afterwards Bligh forwarded a summons to each member to
appear before him on the following day to answer certain charges.
The crimes they were charged with were treason and usurpation of
the government. It is probable that the issue of this summons or
some similar action by Bligh was the aim and object of the
provocative conduct of Macarthur and the extremists. Bligh
immediately communicated to Johnston the charges against the
officers, and suggested that during his (Johnston's) illness
captain Abbott should take the military command. In reply to
Bligh's letter, Johnston sent a verbal message "that he was so
ill as to be unable to write, but that he would get a person to
write an answer in the evening."<br></p>

<br>
<b>Petition for Bligh's Arrest [Macarthur's handwriting]</b></p>
<br>
<p>Johnston received Bligh's letter at Annandale shortly after 4
o'clock, and notwithstanding his refusal to wait on Bligh, he
hastened to the barracks, then situated around the site of
Wynyard-square. It is evident that Johnston made no effort to
achieve a peaceable settlement, but on the contrary was
determined to let matters take their course. Soon after his
arrival at the barracks Johnston committed the first open act of
rebellion and usurpation of the civil power, when he assumed the
title of lieutenant-governor and signed the warrant for the
release of Macarthur from gaol. Macarthur had been confined in
gaol throughout the day. The promptitude with which Johnston
ordered the release is additional evidence that the insurrection
was a preconceived plan. Macarthur was released, and shortly
after 7 o'clock government house was surrounded by the soldiers,
Bligh was arrested, and the colony was in the hands of
rebels.</p>

<h3>AFTER THE MUTINY.</h3>
<p><small>AFTER</small> the insurrection Bligh was kept in
confinement until February, 1809, when he was allowed to embark
on H.M.S. Porpoise for the purpose of sailing direct for England.
Bligh, however, sailed for Tasmania,* and returned to Port
Jackson after the arrival of Governor Macquarie. He took his
final departure on the 12th of May, 1810.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See below.]</p>
<p>Johnston's first official act was to assume the title of
lieutenant-governor. This was quite unjustifiable. By the letters
patent appointing each governor, the senior officer on the
station was appointed administrator in the event of the death or
absence of the governor or lieutenant-governor, and a
lieutenant-governor was appointed only by a commission from the
King. After this, acts of rebellion succeeded one another
rapidly. On the 27th of January, the judge-advocate, commissary,
provost-marshal, naval officer, and, three days later, the
chaplain, were suspended from their duties. If the rebellion had
been only against the person of Governor Bligh, it is difficult
to understand why these officers should have been promptly
relieved of their duties before giving evidence of unwillingness
to continue acting, unless the object of the rebels was to obtain
a complete control of all branches of the government. During the
first few days of power, an insurrectionary committee sat to
examine Bligh's public and private papers, with the object of
securing incriminating evidence against him. With the possible
exception of the papers in connection with Bligh's farm, this
search was a total failure, and is decidedly discreditable to the
honour of the insurrectionaries.<br></p>

<br>
<b>Petition of Thanks to Johnston, 27th January, 1808</b></p>
<br>
<p>The legal administration under Johnston was a parody of
justice. On the 30th of January, a meeting of the criminal court
was ordered for the trial of Macarthur. This trial was a pitiable
farce. The indictment prepared by Atkins was read, but there was
no prosecutor. Under these circumstances the prisoner, Macarthur,
had unlimited license; there was no one to object to his
questions; no one to cross-examine or refute the evidence he
tendered; no one to question his conduct in producing extracts
from Bligh's correspondence. Captain Abbott advised Johnston of
the shameful character of the proceedings, but the trial was
allowed to be completed without interruption.</p>
<p>The court martial on D'Arcy Wentworth * on the 17th of
February was also a mockery, as there was no prosecutor. On the
10th of February, Thomas Jamison demanded a court martial ** on
himself, but when Bligh refused to prosecute, no trial was held.
The holding of the one trial and the refusal of the other were
decidedly inconsistent actions. William Gore was convicted of
perjury without trial after taking action similar to that of
Macarthur at his first trial, in entering a protest against the
constitution of the court. The trial of John and Gregory Blaxland
and Simeon Lord was allowed to develop into the persecution of
the prosecutor. Two men, Oliver Russell and Robert Daniels, were
convicted and sentenced for perjury without trial.*** In the case
of Russell and Daniels, Johnston recognised the flagrant
injustice committed, and released the two prisoners.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>See</i> page 446 <i>et seq.</i>]      [**
<i>See</i> page 442 <i>et seq.</i>]      [*** <i>See</i> page
484.]</p>
<p>By the end of March a very strong party had arisen in
opposition to the Johnston-Macarthur administration. To checkmate
this, Johnston ordered Charles Grimes and John Harris to carry
his despatches to England. On the 26th of April, he wrote a
letter **** to all officers stationed at Sydney challenging them
to produce charges against Macarthur, but the officers tactfully
refused. The settlers' antipathy to Macarthur is shown by their
address ***** to Johnston on the 11th of April. According to the
testimony ****** of Thomas Arndell, Macarthur endeavoured to
silence all expression of opposition by the refusal of the
individual's right to petition the representative of the
king.</p>
<p class="foot">[**** <i>See</i> page 518.]      [*****
<i>See</i> page 572.]      [****** <i>See</i> page 573.]</p>
<p>By his arrest of Bligh, Johnston took over the administration
of a colony in which existed many discontented and discordant
factions. The removal of Bligh did nothing to remove these causes
of trouble, and the ease with which the rebellion was
accomplished increased rather than allayed the restlessness. The
general peace of the colony was in a worse condition after than
before the arrest.</p>
<p>Johnston was superseded in the administration by the arrival
of his senior officer. Foveaux returned to the colony on the 28th
of July, 1808, and on the following day relieved Johnston in the
administration of the government. The <i>camaraderie</i> and
mutual support prevalent amongst the officers of the New South
Wales Corps are well shown by his action on his arrival. On the
28th of July, Foveaux first learned of the arrest of Governor
Bligh, and "determined on the same day to continue the arrest and
to carry on the government in his own name. This resolution seems
to have been taken almost sooner than it was possible to have
received the necessary information" * to form his own opinion as
to the advisability of Bligh's deposition.</p>
<p class="foot">[* From a legal opinion given by T. G. Harris for
the crown.]</p>
<p>The most important episodes of Foveaux's administration were a
continuation of the efforts to induce Bligh to leave the colony,
the granting of lands in the city of Sydney, the endeavour to
secure the cancellation of the contract ** between Messrs.
Campbell and Hook and lieutenant-governor Collins, the erection
of commissariat stores and barracks, and the drastic action ***
he adopted with regard to the ship <i>Rose</i>.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See page 645.]      [*** See page 648 et

<h3>FROM PATERSON TO THE TRIAL.</h3>
<p align="center">[Source: Bladen.]</p>
<p><small>THE</small> news [of Bligh's arrest in January, 1808]
reached England in September. At that time Great Britain, and, in
fact, the whole of the civilised world, was so engrossed in the
triumphal progress of Napoleon, and the opening scenes of the
great Peninsula War, that the affairs of a distant convict
settlement attracted no attention. After the uproar which
followed the Convention of Cintra had subsided, the British
Government began to look about for a suitable man to re-establish
order in New South Wales. It is easy to understand that Viscount
Castlereagh, filling as he did the dual position of Minister for
War and the Colonies, would lean to the appointment of a military
man. The experiment of appointing sea captains had not been
successful. Phillip, Hunter, King, and Bligh (all sea captains)
had found it impossible to live on amicable terms with the
military. Castlereagh's selection fell upon Brigadier-General
Nightingall, then fresh returned from the Peninsula, where he had
served with distinction under Sir Arthur Wellesley. At the same
time the 73rd Regiment, then quartered in Scotland, was ordered
to hold itself in readiness to embark for the colony to relieve
the old New South Wales Corps; and orders were given that in
future the returning Corps should be known as the 102nd. Before
the arrangements for his departure were completed Nightingall
fell ill, and the Governorship was conferred upon Lachlan
Macquarie, then Lieutenant-Colonel of the 73rd Regiment.</p>
<p>While these events were happening in England,
Lieutenant-Governor Paterson had arrived at Sydney from Port
Dalrymple and taken over the command from Lieutenant-Colonel
Foveaux.</p>
<p>If Paterson thought that he would find Bligh resigned to his
lot, and that he himself would only have the perfunctory mission
of holding office until orders were received from England, he was
sadly mistaken. Immediately after his arrival a fresh cause of
trouble arose. Bligh refused to relinquish his authority over the
captains of the men-of-war. He warned the captain of H.M.S.
<i>Porpoise</i> that he was to obey no orders but his. Paterson
threatened to use force and send Bligh Home, under arrest, in an
outgoing merchant vessel of 500 tons burden. In the meantime he
confined him in a barrack.</p>
<p>The subsequent negotiations were conducted on Paterson's
behalf by Johnston and Abbott. Bligh tells us (p. 173) that these
two officers had not seen him since the memorable 26th January,
1808, when the arrest was made. It is evident from this that all
communications were made by letter. We can imagine the awkward
state of affairs at Sydney during the whole of the year 1808: the
Governor confined to Government House, with its small grounds, at
the top of Bridge-street, sentinels at the gates and doors; the
head quarters of the usurping Government on the opposite side of
the small Tank Stream; the two buildings are within hail of each
other, but the only communications which pass are frigidly
formal, official notes; the principals never see one another;
Bligh keeps mostly indoors; the portraits of George III and
Catherine, in the drawing-room, are veiled, and Bligh chafes as
he hears the repeated "All's well!" of the sentinels without. It
was under such circumstances that Johnston and Abbott waited on
him on 30th January, 1809 (the anniversary, as Bligh
grandiloquently remarked, of the martyrdom of King Charles).
According to the Governor's account, it took Johnston and Abbott
"some time to recover themselves from the effect of first seeing
me." The recovery, however, when once made, was very complete,
for they unceremoniously marched Bligh off, and confined him in a
subaltern's barrack.* Bligh's account of his treatment on this
occasion is unique. He describes at length the indignities heaped
upon himself and his daughter by "as presumptuous a set of rebels
as ever existed"; the mental strain involved in counteracting the
machinations of the enemy, "whose minds are replete with every
art and dissimulation", and his daily apprehension that the food
supplied to him might be poisoned.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Bligh and his adherents stated that it was a
subaltern's barrack, the subaltern being J. Finucane, Foveaux's
secretary. Johnston, on his trial, stated that this was wrong;
according to him, it was the surgeon's.]</p>
<p>Eventually a compromise was arranged. Bligh undertook to quit
the colony in the <i>Porpoise</i>, and pledged his word of honour
as an officer and a gentleman to proceed to England as quickly as
possible, not touching at any port in the territory. He further
agreed not to interfere in the Government of the colony on any
pretence whatever. Paterson, on his part, agreed to allow Bligh
to have the <i>Porpoise</i>, to remove all restraints on his
liberty, to permit him to communicate with his friends and
supporters, and to take Home to England, with him, any persons he
desired.</p>
<p>This agreement had not been in force a fortnight before it was
broken&mdash;first by Paterson, then by Bligh. Paterson refused
to allow any one to go with Bligh, except his daughter, his
secretary, and a few domestics; and Bligh, on his part, utterly
disregarded his promise to sail direct for England.</p>
<p>Bligh seems to have had no difficulty in reconciling his
breach of the pledge of honour, to his conscience. He regarded
the fulfilment thereof&mdash;so he told Viscount
Castlereagh&mdash;as "contrary to all political, moral, or
religious precepts, and the duty I owed to my King" (p. 175). At
the Court Martial on Johnston he seemed rather proud of his
action in this particular. To him the military officers were
unscrupulous usurpers, and he was justified in resorting to any
expedient. The pledge of honour of a British officer, and a
gentleman, is one which Bligh's friends would rather have seen
him hold sacred, at whatever cost.** Fulton (p. 87) tells us that
Bligh thought that the good of His Majesty's service was not to
be sacrificed by keeping faith with rebels. Bligh himself tells
us (p. 110): "I then, by stratagem, got command of my ship."</p>
<p class="foot">[** The extent to which the <i>suggestio
falsi</i> was countenanced in the Navy a century ago is instanced
by Paley's assertion that it was the custom of English ships to
decoy an enemy into their power by counterfeiting signals of
distress.&mdash;Mor. and Nat. Phil., p. 52.]</p>
<p>In accordance with this agreement, orders were given for the
<i>Porpoise</i> to be prepared and provisioned for the voyage to
Europe, and the deposed Governor was permitted to go on
board&mdash;a free man. Having procured the command of the
<i>Porpoise</i>, Bligh drew up a proclamation, dated 12th March,
1809, declaring the Corps to be in a state of mutiny, and
forbidding the masters of vessels taking any of the persons
connected with the rebellion out of the colony. Copies of the
proclamation were made secretly, and when Bligh sailed he left
them behind him to be circulated by his adherents. Although the
wind was fair, he hovered about the coast between Port Stephens
and Broken Bay for several days, and then made sail for the
Derwent, his object, apparently, being to intercept, and take
prisoners, Johnston and Macarthur, who were on the eve of
embarking for England. When he arrived at Hobart on 31st March he
found Collins prepared to pay him all the respect due to the
Governor and Commander-in-Chief. Collins's communications were
addressed to "His Excellency Governor Bligh", and the customary
formalities were at first punctiliously observed. Bligh, it would
appear, had, in a way, undertaken not to interfere in the
internal government of the settlement. Such was the state of
affairs when the <i>&AElig;olus</i> arrived at Hobart Town with a
proclamation*** by Lieutenant-Governor Paterson, forbidding any
communication being held with Bligh, his family, or
establishment, or with any person on the <i>Porpoise</i> known to
be in his confidence or service. Collins, who had desired to be
friendly with both parties, was forced to declare for one side or
the other. After consulting his officers he decided to obey
Paterson's orders, and had the proclamation ostracising Bligh
read in church by the chaplain (Rev. Robert Knopwood) at a time
when the officers of the <i>Porpoise</i> were attending Divine
service. Bligh withdrew to his ship, and all friendly
communications with the shore ceased. The weapons with which the
fray between Bligh and his opponents was waged were proclamations
and general orders. When Bligh read Paterson's proclamation he
immediately replied with a counterblast, in which he warned all
and sundry of the consequences they might expect if they opposed
or defied him. He recited his authority to "vanquish, apprehend,
take, and put to death" all "enemies, pirates, and rebels", this
lengthy and high-sounding document will be found printed on pages
108 and 110. Bligh forwarded a copy to Collins, and requested him
to have it printed, a dilemma from which Collins was rescued by
some contumacious busybody who successfully concealed the small
stock of printing ink. Bligh then requested Collins to assemble
the inhabitants at the bell, and cause the proclamation to be
read to them. Collins declined to comply, at the same time
assuring Bligh of his unabated respect. For six months the same
sort of official bickerings were indulged in as had prevailed at
Sydney. This continued until the news of Macquarie's arrival was
received, when Bligh hastened in high spirits to Sydney.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Post, p. 81.]</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Shortly after Bligh sailed for Hobart in H.M.S.
<i>Porpoise</i>, Lieutenant-Colonel Johnston and John Macarthur
left Sydney in the <i>Admiral Gambier</i>, bound for England,
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Rio de Janeiro. They were under the impression
that Bligh had sailed for England, and hoped to forestall him.
Paterson gave them a letter to the British Ambassador at Rio, to
the effect that he had ordered them to England for the purpose of
explaining to His Majesty's Ministers the circumstances connected
with the arrest of Governor Bligh. For some months prior to their
departure from Sydney, Macarthur was very much less conspicuous
than he had been at the arrest of Bligh and the events consequent
thereon. When Foveaux superseded Johnston, Macarthur's occupation
was gone. It was very fortunate for Macarthur that he had left
Sydney when Macquarie arrived. His bold step, in sailing for
England to fight Bligh in the law courts, turned out to be the
best thing he could have done. Had he been at Sydney when the
reliefs landed from England, and Bligh returned from Hobart, he
would beyond all doubt have been arrested on a criminal charge
and tried by a court composed of the Judge-Advocate Bent and the
officers of the 73rd Regiment, who would view the transactions of
26th January from a very different point of view to that taken by
the officers of the New South Wales Corps.</p>
<p>When it became known in England that Johnston and Macarthur
had left the colony, and were daily expected to arrive in London,
steps were at once taken to secure counsel's opinion as to the
question of prosecuting them. The lawyers to whom the papers were
referred advised that both of them were guilty of conspiracy and
high misdemeanour. Johnston it was recommended should be tried by
Court Martial. Macarthur and the other civilians inculpated
(Bayly, Townson, J. Blaxland, Blaxcell, and Jamison) could only
be tried by the law of the colony in which the offence was
committed. It was, therefore, recommended that Macarthur be sent
back to New South Wales, and a prosecution instituted against him
in the Criminal Court. It may be that Macarthur suspected this,
for he sent word from Rio that they would land at Bristol. As a
matter of fact, they landed on the west coast of Ireland,
travelled by land to Cork, and from thence sailed to Bristol,
where they were met by Mr. Macarthur's eldest son, Edward, a
lieutenant in the 39th Regiment.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Macarthur expected&mdash;and he was not disappointed&mdash;to
find a powerful enemy in Sir Joseph Banks. Bligh had been a
protege of Banks for years: he had virtually received at his
hands the appointment of Governor, and under almost any
circumstances would have been fairly sure of Sir Joseph's
support. When it became known in England that the ringleader was
John Macarthur, about whom so many of Banks' friends had
complained, and with whom he had never been on friendly terms, it
is not to be wondered at that he readily took up the cudgels on
Bligh's behalf. During the whole of his residence in the colony,
Bligh kept Banks well posted in its affairs; in fact, it is
evident that Bligh deemed it no less important to report direct
to Banks than it was to do so to his official superiors at
Downing-street. A comparison of his letters and despatches to
Viscount Castlereagh and to Banks shows many of them to be
practically identical. Word for word, the private letters
addressed by Bligh to Banks correspond with the official
despatches to Viscount Castlereagh. The deferential allusions to
"your Lordship" are paraphrased into a more friendly style of
address; but in well nigh every other respect they are fairly
faithful copies.</p>
<p>Macarthur was not dismayed by Banks's open hostility. In one
of his first letters, sent from England before Bligh had arrived,
he remarked: "Sir Joseph Banks still continues to advocate his
friend's [Bligh's] cause, and speaks of him as a much-injured,
meritorious character; fortunately, no one believes him."**
Again, immediately before Johnston's trial, Macarthur tells his
wife: "Mr. Bligh is universally execrated. Sir Joseph Banks
certainly supports their cause with all his interest."*** On p.
539 will be found a private letter from Bligh to Banks. At the
time it was written, the Court Martial on Lieut.-Colonel Johnston
was sitting. It is evident from this letter that they were in
close and constant communication. Bligh complained of the methods
adopted by the prosecution, and realised that it was he, as much
as Johnston, who was standing his trial.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Post, p. 370.]      [*** Post, p. 526. [End
Bladen.]]</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>In the meantime counsel had been consulted on behalf of the
crown, and had given their opinion that major Johnston, Macarthur
"and the persons concerned with them were guilty of a conspiracy
and high misdemeanor in the arrest and imprisonment of Governor
Bligh"; that the military concerned should be tried by a court
martial in England, and all others by a criminal court in the
colony. The authorities were unable to take action until the
witnesses for the prosecution arrived, on the 25th of October,
1810, and it is doubtful whether any action would have been taken
if Johnston and his party had not been so persistent in their
agitation for an inquiry.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The Court assembled at Chelsea Hospital on 7th May, 1811, and
continued by adjournments until 5th June. It was composed of
fifteen military officers under the presidency of
Lieutenant-General Keppel. The Right Hon. Charles
Manners-Sutton&mdash;afterwards Speaker of the House of
Commons&mdash;was Judge Advocate. Governor Bligh was represented
by Mr. (afterwards Sir) Frederick Pollock, and Lieutenant Colonel
Johnston by Mr. C. F. Williams and Mr. J. Adolphus.</p>

<h3>THE CHARGE.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> warrant for holding the court, together
with the charge against Lieutenant-Colonel Johnston, were read by
the Judge Advocate, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p>  G.P.R. [George Prince Regent]</p>
<p><small>WHEREAS</small> it hath been most humbly represented
unto us, that the following charge bath been preferred against
Lieutenant-Colonel George Johnston, Major in his Majesty's 102d
regiment of foot, viz.</p>
<p class="dindent">"That Lieutenant-Colonel George Johnston,
Major as aforesaid, did, on or about the 26th day of January,
1808, at Sydney, in the colony of New South Wales, begin, excite,
cause, and join in a mutiny, by putting himself at the head of
the New South Wales Corps, then under his command and doing duty
in the colony, and seizing and causing to be seized and arrested,
and imprisoning and causing to be imprisoned, by means of the
above-mentioned military force, the person of William Bligh, Esq.
then Captain-General and Governor in Chief in and over the
territory of New South Wales:"</p>
<p>Which charge we have thought fit should be inquired into by a
General Court Martial:&mdash;Our will and pleasure therefore is,
in the name and on the behalf of his Majesty, that a General
Court Martial be forthwith held on this occasion, which is to
consist of Lieutenant-General William Keppel, Colonel of his
Majesty's 67th or the South Hampshire regiment of foot, whom we
appoint president thereof, and of a sufficient number of other
officers of competent rank and quality, who can be conveniently
summoned to attend the same. And you are to order the Provost
Marshal General of his Majesty's forces, or his deputy, to give
notice to the said president and officers, and all others whom it
may concern, when and where the said Court Martial is to be held,
and to summon such witnesses as may be able to give testimony
touching the charge above specified; the said Provost Marshal
General and his deputy being hereby required to obey your orders,
and give their attendance where it shall be requisite. And we do
hereby authorise and empower the said General Court Martial to
hear and examine all such matters and information as shall be
brought before them, touching the charge against the said
Lieutenant-Colonel George Johnston, Major as aforesaid, and to
proceed in the trial and giving sentence according to the rules
of military discipline. And for so doing, this shall be, as well
to you as to the General Court Martial, and to all others whom it
may concern, a sufficient warrant.</p>
<br>
<p class="negindent">Given at our Court at Carlton House, this
third day of April, 1811, in the fifty-first year of his
Majesty's reign. By the command of his Royal Highness the Prince
Regent, in the name anion the behalf of his Majesty.</p>

<h3>THE CROWN'S CASE.</h3>
<br>
<p align="center">[Tuesday, 7 May, 1811]</p>
<a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>
<h3>Opening Speech.</h3>
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Johnston having pleaded not guilty,
Governor Bligh read to the court a statement of the case in
substance as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In the month of May, 1805, his Majesty was pleased to appoint
me Captain General and Governor in Chief of the territory of New
South Wales. With my commission, I had the honour to receive
instructions under the sign manual accompanied by others from the
Secretary of State, directing the conduct I was to pursue in my
future government; and thus prepared, on the 28th of January,
1806, I sailed from England, having a commission as a
post-captain of his Majesty's ship Porpoise, with a commander
under me, and was afterwards directed by the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty to wear a broad pendant, constituting me a
commodore, and to hoist the same on board of such other ship as
might be at New South Wales.</p>
<p>"I arrived there on the 5th of August following, and on the
13th read my commission, took the necessary oaths, and superseded
Governor King in the command of the colony and its dependencies.
On this occasion I received respectful addresses from the
military and civil officers, free inhabitants, and others,
congratulating me on my appointment and safe arrival, which were
shortly afterwards followed by some others, that convinced me
that dissentions prevailed in the settlement, and that much
attention on my part would be necessary to preserve the peace and
promote the unanimity of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>"To ascertain the state of the colony, I visited many of the
inhabitants individually, and witnessed many melancholy proofs of
their wretched condition. A want even of the common necessaries
of life was too prevalent, particularly at the extensive
settlement of the Hawkesbury; and although Sydney, the
head-quarters, formed some exception to the general aspect, yet
there the inhabitants and public storehouses were falling into
decay; industry was declining; while a pernicious fondness for
spirituous liquors was gaining ground, to the destruction of
public morals and private happiness."</p>
<p>Governor Bligh then proceeded to state the measures he adopted
to check the pernicious custom of bartering spirits; the
committal of Mr Macarthur; the conduct of the six officers that
formed the criminal court appointed to try him; and his
subsequent release by order of Major Johnston.</p>
<p>"Immediately after the order for the release of Macarthur," he
continued, "there followed an operation of the main guard close
to the gate of the Government-House, and the regiment marched
down from the barracks led on by Major Johnston and the other
officers, with colours flying and music playing as they advanced
to the house. Within a few minutes after, the house was
surrounded; the soldiers quickly broke into all parts of it, and
arrested all the magistrates, Mr. Gore the provost marshal, Mr
Griffin my Secretary, and Mr Fulton the chaplain. I had just time
to call to my orderly serjeant to have my horses ready while I
went up stairs to put on my uniform, (the family being then in
deep mourning) when on my return, as I was standing on the
staircase waiting for my servant with my sword, I saw a number of
soldiers rushing up stairs with their muskets and fixed bayonets,
as I conceived to seize my person. I retired instantly into a
back room, to defeat their object, and to deliberate on the means
to be adopted for the restoration of my authority, which in such
a critical situation could only be accomplished by my getting
into the interior of the country adjacent to the Hawkesbury,
where I knew the whole body of the people would flock to my
standard. To this situation I was pursued by the soldiers, and
after experiencing much insult, was conducted below by Lieutenant
Minchin, who told me that Major Johnston was waiting for me. We
passed together into the drawing-room, every part being crowded
with soldiers under arms, many of whom appeared to be
intoxicated.</p>
<p>"I then received a letter brought by Lieut. Moore, and signed
by Major Johnston (calling himself Lieutenant Governor),
requiring me to resign my authority, and to submit to the arrest
under which, he placed me; which I had scarcely perused, when a
message was delivered to me that Major Johnston wished to speak
to me in the adjoining room, at the door of which he soon after
appeared, surrounded by his officers and soldiers; and in terms
much to the same effect as his letter he there verbally confirmed
my arrest. Martial law was proclaimed, my secretary and my
friends were prevented from seeing me, and I was left only with
my daughter and another lady.</p>
<p>"By Major Johnston's order several persons seized my cabinet
and papers, with my commission, instructions, and the great seal
of the colony. These were locked up in a room guarded by two
sentinels, and several others were placed wand the house to
prevent my escape.</p>
<p>"The same evening committees were formed with a pretended view
of examining into my government, but in reality to discover all
such persons as were attached to me. In this Macarthur took an
active part.</p>
<p>"On the following day Lieutenant Moore came with Major.
Johnston's orders, and carried away my swords and what fire arms
he found in the house; at noon three vollies were fired by the
soldiers, and twenty-one guns from the battery, while the royal
standard was displayed. His Majesty's Commissary, the Provost
Marshal, the Judge Advocate, and the Chaplain, were suspended
from their offices; all the magistrates were dismissed, and
others appointed in their room; the most extraordinary and
mutinous proclamations were issued, and even my broad pendant as
Commodore on the station was ordered by Major Johnston to be
struck. Thus was the mutiny complete: those who were concerned in
it had got possession of the government, had turned out all the
civil officers and substituted others in their room, and imposed
on me an arrest which continued from the time of the mutiny till
the 20th of February, 1809.</p>
<p>"The circumstances of indignity to which I was exposed during
all the period of usurpation which followed the mutiny, I need
not here state to this honourable Court; suffice it to say at
present, that after experiencing various insults while under
arrest, and many hardships after I was enlarged, being proscribed
as an outlaw, Colonel Macquarie arrived at the colony on the 28th
of December, 1809, with orders from his Majesty to reinstate me
in my government, and to express his Majesty's high
disapprobation at the mutiny. Shortly after, I left the colony,
and arrived in England the 25th of October, 1810.</p>
<br>

<br>
Rear-Admiral William Bligh<br>
<small>NLA pic-an11230917-v</small></p>
<br>
<p>"Thus have I endeavoured to give to this honourable Court such
a statement of the mutiny as may be necessary to connect and
explain the evidence that, will be given: and here for the
present, ignorant of what may be attempted to be asserted against
me, and not willing to waste unnecessarily the time of the Court,
I shall rest my case. Should any justification be attempted, I
doubt not this honourable Court will give me an opportunity of
answering it by any additional witnesses, and by again submitting
myself, or the witnesses who shall have been already examined, to
a re-examination as to the matters to which they shall not
already have been examined.</p>
<p>"What justification can be offered I am at a loss to conceive;
and although I have seen the dispatch, which three months nearly
after the event Colonel Johnston sent home to the Secretary of
State, and which contains nothing but general and vague
assertions, I am still as much in doubt what excuse can be
presented to this honourable Court for a mutiny so unprecedented
in the military annals of this country, so dangerous by its
example, and in many of its effects to the colony so
destructive."</p>
<p>After some conversation respecting the time that had elapsed
since the expulsion of Governor Bligh, it was decided by the
Court that the accusation came within the limits of the act of
parliament, as it appeared that the limited period had been
exceeded without cause. The appointment of William Bligh, Esq. to
be Governor of New South Wales, and his instruction, were then
proved, after which he was examined on the part of the
prosecution.</p>

<h3>Examination of Bligh.</h3>
<p class="qa">PROSECUTOR: Have you the Admiralty order,
authorisizing you to carry a broad pendant?</p>
<p class="qa">BLIGH: Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Put it in. [<i>Read.</i>]</p>
<p class="qa">Q When did you first, in pursuance of his Majesty's
commission, take upon yourself the government of New South Wales
as Governor and Captain General?</p>
<p class="qa">A About the 13th of Aug. 1806.</p>
<p class="qa">Q To what period were you acting as such?</p>
<p class="qa">A To the 26th of January, 1808.</p>
<p class="qa">Q In what state did you find the colony upon your
arrival?</p>
<p class="qa">A In a very miserable state.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you discover any, and what abuses, then
existing with respect to spirits?</p>
<p class="qa">A There was a barter of spirits for articles that
were wanting of every description, by those persons who had
spirits to purchase them with.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were the officers or soldiers at all interested
in that barter of spirits, and if so, how?</p>
<p class="qa">A The officers were very much interested in the
barter of spirits; so much so, as to be enabled to get whatever
they wanted at a very cheap rate.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What with respect to the soldiers?</p>
<p class="qa">A The observation applies exactly the same to the
soldiers, provided they could get it.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you take any measures to prevent this barter
of spirits?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What?</p>
<p class="qa">A By prohibiting the barter of spirits altogether;
and it stands so in my public orders.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Have you those orders?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir; there is a copy of them in the common
orderly book, and they have also been printed.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did those measures of reform create any
discontent in the colony; and if so, mention who were
discontented, and on what account, and how they shewed their
discontent?</p>
<p class="qa">A They did create discontent among a few.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Mention who were discontented.</p>
<p class="qa">A Those persons in particular who were connected
with the mutiny, who were connected with my arrest; Macarthur,
and a few others, whose names are mentioned in my dispatches.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was there a regiment in the settlement at that
time called the New South Wales Corps, or the 102d regiment?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Under whose command was this corps at that
time?</p>
<p class="qa">A Major Johnston, at head-quarters; Colonel
Paterson was colonel of the regiment, he was at one of the
out-settlements, at Port Dalrymple, as Lieutenant Governor.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Who was then the senior officer in his Majesty's
service at the colony?</p>
<p class="qa">A Am I to understand that any distinction is made
between the colony and the territory?</p>
<p class="qa">Q At Sydney?</p>
<p class="qa">A Major Johnston.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Of the 102d?</p>
<p class="qa">A Of the New South Wales Corps then; I never knew
it as the 102d till it came home.</p>
<p class="qa">Q In what state was the settlement in general in
the month of January, 1808?</p>
<p class="qa">A In a very improved state, and the whole people
happy and contented in a high degree, except as I mentioned in
answer to a former question.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was there the least danger of tumult or
insurrection, or of any disturbance in the settlement, provided
the military had remained true to you as the Governor?</p>
<p class="qa">A Not the least danger.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you receive any address as Governor on the
first of January, 1808?</p>
<p class="qa">A I did.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What is that paper?</p>
<p class="qa">A It is the original address. [<i>Read.</i>]</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Signed by how many names; It appears to
have been totalled 838.</p>
<p class="qa">A Of the settled inhabitants, the landholders; all
the respectable people, except a few as before mentioned; and it
was delivered to me by persons who have come over to witness that
these were the sentiments of the whole colony.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Are the landholders convicts?</p>
<p class="qa">A Some of the landholders use people who have been
sent out as convicts, and who have got a quantity of land, to the
extent perhaps of 50 or 100 acres, as ticket-of-leave-men; others
are regular settlers. They are a mixture of those people, which
has always been the case in that colony.</p>
<p class="qa">PROSECUTOR:</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were any of them convicts at the time they signed
the address?</p>
<p class="qa">A I really do not know: there may be some who were
convicts, because many of the convicts are emancipated, and have
spots of ground given them, which they, cultivate for themselves.
There may be convicts among them; I know nothing of them
myself.</p>
<p class="qa">THE JUDGE ADVOCATE: I understand Captain Bligh to
state, that the subscriptions to this address are composed of
persons who have been sent as convicts to the settlement and of
persons who have gone out thither as settlers, but he does not
know their respective names.</p>
<br>
<p>That is followed up by a question, whether any of those who
signed the address were convicts at the time. The answer
introduces another description of persons: there are persons sent
out as convicts who have served their time, and remain in the
colony as settlers, and persons who went out originally as
settlers, and there are persons also, who being convicts there,
still are at liberty, and have land given them; therefore there
are three descriptions of persons.</p>
<br>
<p class="qa">THE JUDGE ADVOCATE: Was Mr John Macarthur in
January, 1808, under charge for certain supposed offences?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">THE JUDGE ADVOCATE: Do you know whether any and
what Court Martial met to try this charge on the 25th of January,
1808?</p>
<p class="qa">A No Court Martial whatever; the Criminal Court
met.</p>
<p class="qa">THE JUDGE ADVOCATE: When?</p>
<p class="qa">A On the 25th of January, 1808.</p>
<p class="qa">THE JUDGE ADVOCATE: To try this supposed
charge?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">THE JUDGE ADVOCATE: Do you know the names of the
members composing that Court?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">THE JUDGE ADVOCATE: State them.</p>
<p class="qa">A Captain Anthony Fenn Kemp, Lieut. John Brabyn,
Lieut. Wm. Moore, Lieut. Thomas Laycock, Lieut. William Minchin,
Lieut. William Lawson.</p>
<p class="qa">THE JUDGE ADVOCATE: Of what corps?</p>
<p class="qa">A All of the New South Wales Corps.</p>
<p class="qa">THE JUDGE ADVOCATE: Who was at that time acting as
Judge Advocate in the settlement, what had he to do in the
Criminal Court?</p>
<p class="qa">A To preside, according to act of parliament, as
Judge of the Court.</p>
<p class="qa">PROSECUTOR:</p>
<p class="qa">Q On the same day, (that is, on the 25th of
January) was any application made to you by the Judge Advocate
for redress? If so, what was the application, and against whom
was it made?</p>
<p class="qa">A The Judge Advocate represented to me that he had
been used extremely ill; that after he had sworn in the members
of the Court, the six officers refused to swear him in until Mr
Macarthur had read a paper which was in his hand, (upon which the
paper was read) and Mr Judge Advocate Atkins prevented from being
a part of the Court. It was of a most inflammatory tendency, the
paper was, and scurrilous.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What did you do in consequence of this
application? Relate what passed between you and this Criminal
Court on the occasion.</p>
<p class="qa">A Letters passed between us to induce me to change
the Judge Advocate. I refused to appoint any other Judge
Advocate, and declared there could be no Court without him. They
however would not swear him in, or allow him to sit; upon which
they detained his papers; and finally, Mr Atkins reported the
case to me by a memorial.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What steps did you take with respect to the
Court, and by whose advice: did you advise with any body?</p>
<p class="qa">A I had all the magistrates about me.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Did you summon the magistrates to
attend, or did they come by chance?</p>
<p class="qa">A They were sent for by me by message only, and
they came: there was a consultation; and the result was, it was
determined that Mr Macarthur should be arrested.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: What consultation?</p>
<p class="qa">A The magistrates and civil officers were at the
Government House at that time; we were all together. Mr Judge
Advocate Atkins came and read his memorial. Upon the memorial
being read, circumstances were then considered to be in a very
alarming way, and I wrote a letter to Major Johnston, requesting
his attendance at Government House; and afterwards, when I found
that Mr Macarthur was let loose from the criminal court,
circumstances were then thought so much more alarming that I
immediately sent another letter to Major Johnston to come to me,
as I wanted his advice and opinion upon the circumstances, as to
what was necessary to be done. These are the letters I sent to
Major Johnston.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Are those the original letters?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Are those the letters you sent; is that
the letter itself, or is it a copy?</p>
<p class="qa">A It is signed by Mr Griffin, my secretary. I
ordered my secretary to sign it, and his name is to it. I don't
know whether it is a copy or the original.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Do you know whether it is the same in
words with the letter you sent?</p>
<p class="qa">A O, yes.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: You saw the letter before it was
sent?</p>
<p class="qa">A I did.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: You dictated it?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes. [<i>The first letter read.</i>]</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Had you any answer to that?</p>
<p class="qa">A To that letter I received a verbal answer, that
he could not come: I think it was, that he had fallen out of his
chaise, and that he could not come. This is the second letter
which I sent him, dated Government House, the 26th of January,
the day after the first was sent. [<i>Read.</i>]</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: What answer did you receive to that;
verbal or written?</p>
<p class="qa">A A verbal answer; all were verbal. That Major
Johnston was too ill to come, and he would endeavour to get a
person to write an answer in the evening. I think it was nearly
to that amount.</p>
<p class="qa">PROSECUTOR:</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was any thing stated to you on the 25th of
January by the Provost Marshal Mr Gore, relative to Mr Macarthur
and his bail?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What did you do about that?</p>
<p class="qa">A Mr Gore declared that Mr Macarthur was out of his
custody.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What did you do then?</p>
<p class="qa">A Myself and the magistrates then took the matter
into consideration, and a warrant was issued, ordering Macarthur
into custody.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Who dined with you at the Government House on the
28th of January, and remained with you during the evening?</p>
<p class="qa">A There was Mr Campbell, a merchant, a gentleman
who had been resident in the colony for some years; Mr Palmer,
the commissary; Mr Griffin, the secretary; Mr Williamson, the
deputy commissary: I am not sure whether there were any other
persons there, I am not sure whether Mr Fulton was not there, I
rather think he was not.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you see any soldiers approach the Government
House on that evening?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What soldiers, what number of them, and at what
time?</p>
<p class="qa">A At what time I am sure I cannot say with
precision; it was about sun-down.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What soldiers were they?</p>
<p class="qa">A They appeared to be the whole of the New South
Wales Corps, or the greater part of them; there might be a few
sentinels left at the barracks.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were they there with their arms?</p>
<p class="qa">A All with their arms; they marched up in battle
array, with their colours flying and bayonets fixed.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Had they any officers with them?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Who were they?</p>
<p class="qa">A Major Johnston was at the head of them; he was
the commanding officer. Before they reached Government House,
Lieutenant Bell, who was the officer of the main guard, commonly
called the Governor's guard, advanced suddenly with his men,
burst through the gates, and surrounded the house; the principal
body, with Major Johnston at their head, marching up the road in
the mean time, came in afterward. They entered the house, and
burst through the rooms; they broke open the door, and burst into
my daughter's room.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Who do you mean by <i>they</i>?</p>
<p class="qa">A Some of the soldiers.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was there any artillery?</p>
<p class="qa">A There were two pieces before the house, and two
at the barracks, upon the Parade.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Stationed there?</p>
<p class="qa">A Stationed there; the two guns upon the Parade
were pointed towards Government House: there were two
field-pieces likewise before the house: and it appeared that the
night before, without my knowledge, the screws were taken away
out of the breeches.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was the direction of the guns altered; were the
guns on this day pointed as they had always been before?</p>
<p class="qa">A Those before the house were not altered, but
those on the Parade were. They always stood with their muzzles in
the line of Government House, but not pointed directly towards
it; their position was usually to the right.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: You don't mean to say the guns were
pointed particularly to your house on that day more than on any
other?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, I do think they were.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: You say not those by your house, but
those that were at the barracks?</p>
<p class="qa">A Those that were at the barracks.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: What distance are the barracks from
Government House?</p>
<p class="qa">A I should suppose about 400 yards, in a straight
line. If the Court would allow me, I have a plan of the town,
which would serve to explain the transaction. [<i>The plan was
produced.</i>]</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Was any order to release Mr Macarthur
given to you; and by whom was that order?</p>
<p class="qa">A Mr Gore the provost marshal brought it up to me
in the room where I was with the magistrates; a written order,
signed with the name of Major Johnston, as Lieutenant
Governor.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: When did he bring it up?</p>
<p class="qa">A That was the 26th.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Was that before or after you saw the
soldiery coming up to Government House?</p>
<p class="qa">A It was just about the time they were marching up:
we saw that Mr Macarthur had been liberated a short time before
Mr Gore reported. They let him loose out of jail, and he mixed
himself with the New South Wales Corps; and the moment they got
him amongst them, they marched up along with him.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Is that the order?</p>
<p class="qa">A This is the order, sir. [<i>Read.</i>]</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: This is the order that was given to
you?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir, before Major Johnston came up; that was
prior to my being put under arrest.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: You have already stated in your
evidence, that it was given to you about the same period of time
the soldiers were marching up to Government House: do you know
whose hand-writing that is?</p>
<p class="qa">A I think it is Major Johnston's.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Do you know it?</p>
<p class="qa">A It is my belief that it is.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Have you sufficient knowledge of his
hand-writing so be able to swear that you believe it is his?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir; I have seen him write his name
frequently; and I verily believe, upon my oath, that it is his
hand-writing.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Was Colonel Johnston then, in fact,
Lieutenant-Governor?</p>
<p class="qa">A Not, sir; he was only Major Johnston. The
Lieutenant-Governor, as far as I could comprehend, and who had
been reported as such in the Calendars, was Colonel Paterson; the
prisoner was only Major Johnston, commanding the troops at
head-quarters.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Was Major Johnston the senior officer
present at head-quarters?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">JUDGE ADVOCATE: You see they are both in the same
regiment, Colonel Paterson and Major Johnston; and the patent
which has been read states, that on the death or absence of the
Governor, the government shall devolve upon the person who has
the highest command.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: That would be either Colonel Paterson or
Major Johnston, the man who would have been Lieutenant Governor,
agreeably to your commission, supposing you had died?</p>
<p class="qa">A Colonel Paterson; but Johnston took the
government for the time being.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: What distance was Colonel Paterson off
from Port Jackson?</p>
<p class="qa">A In a good sailing vessel a week or a fortnight
would perform it.</p>
<p class="qa">THE PRESIDENT: There must always have been a
Governor.</p>
<p class="qa">PROSECUTOR: Q What did you do on first seeing the
soldiers approach Government House?</p>
<p class="qa">A I immediately retired, it was so sudden; and,
with the gentlemen who were with me, went up stairs into my own
room, and got together some papers which were there, and which I
thought it necessary to take care of. While this was doing, the
gentlemen all left me, except Mr Palmer, the emissary; and Mr
Palmer and myself were standing together at the head of the
stairs, when on hearing the troops making a noise round the
house, and rushing in, Mr Palmer went down; and as he reached the
foot of the stairs, a party of the soldiers rushed past him, and
came up to the head of the stairs where he had left me. These men
were in an infuriated state, with their muskets, and bayonets
fixed; upon which, feeling that they were coming with great
fierceness to seize my person, I retired into a room which was
upon my right hand as I stood on the staircase. These were two
rooms in the place that I went into an inner and an outer room,
divided from each other by a small partitions, with a door
between them; I went into the inner room, which was an end room
of the house, where there was a window, at which it was my
contemplation how I could possibly get clear of the troops that
had surrounded the house, and get to the Hawkesbury.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Is the Hawkesbury distant?</p>
<p class="qa">A It is a district forty miles in the interior,
where most of the free persons are settled, with only a small
party of soldiers, perhaps fifteen or sixteen, and where I was
sure the people would flock to my standard, and give all their
aid in defending me. While I was in the room which I have
mentioned, the door between the two rooms was shut, and there I
arranged the papers which I had got with me, and tore a number of
them in order to lessen my bundle, which was too large to be
concealed under my waistcoat. I tore a great number of them; and
a vast quantity of the pieces were picked up by John Dunn, my
servant, and afterwards burnt. During this time the troops were
running all over the rooms; the room I was in was at the back
part of the house; they had rummaged every where except this
room; and while I was in it busied about these papers, the door
was opened, and the person who opened the door, who was
Lieutenant Moore, of the same corps, said,"Pooh! pooh! you need
not come in here, the Governor is not here", just in that
indifferent kind of way; "The Governor is not in here, the
Governor is not to be found here;" and retired; and the door was
shut again. I then heard them rattling about the staircase and
rummaging the other parts of the house in search of me for a long
while, and many bad expressions made use of. Afterwards I
understood they had been rummaging all the outhouses and
searching the grounds, and that they sent their scouts every way,
as they apprehended I had escaped into the country and gone to
the Hawkesbury. I then heard a halloo-balloo, and a man cry out,
(which was one Serjeant Whittle,) "Damn my eyes, I will find
him&mdash;soldiers! come up stairs again, I will have another
search;" or words to that effect. The fellows came in, Serjeant
Whittle commanded the party, which consisted of eight or ten men,
or there might be more; they came with their muskets, and
bayonets fixed, into the room, and there they found me. There was
a hallo-balloo directly, and a cheering by the troops outside,
that the Governor was found. I was then a little confused in
fixing and arranging my papers withinside my waistcoat; I put my
right hand up to prevent them from falling through; a fellow came
up to me, and with his bayonet presented, says, "Damn your eyes,
if you don't take your hand out of there, I will whip this into
you immediately." I immediately called out, "Serjeant, keep the
man off, I have no arms&mdash;stand off." At this moment, in the
middle of a great crowd, came Lieutenant Minchin, creeping
through upon his hands and knees, and called out, "Serjeant, keep
the men off, the Governor is not armed:" upon which Mr Minchin
took hold of me by the arm, and led me down stairs, telling me
that Major Johnston wanted me below; and accordingly I was
obliged to go below.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was any letter then given to you; and if so, by
whom?</p>
<p class="qa">A Lieutenant Moore was the first person that came
up to me with a letter.</p>
<p class="qa">Q When you got down stairs?</p>
<p class="qa">A When I got down stairs, after I had entered the
drawing-room, Lieutenant Moore brought an a letter. Communicating
with the drawing-room is an outer room, called the dining
parlour; on being led into these rooms, I found troops stationed
all round the walls, just hire a Roberspierrean party, or a
revolutionary tribunal; while other troops like sentinels
surrounded the house, having a party with them, consisting of a
few of the inhabitants.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Is that the letter that was given to you?</p>
<p class="qa">A This is the letter which was delivered to me by
Lieutenant Moore.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Do you know by whom it is signed?</p>
<p class="qa">A It is signed by Major Johnston.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Is that his hand-writing?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, it is, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q To whom is it addressed?</p>
<p class="qa">A To myself, William Bligh, Esq.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Not directed to the Governor?</p>
<p class="qa">A Not at all.</p>
<p class="qa">Q How is it directed?</p>
<p class="qa">A "On his Majesty's service. William Bligh,
Esquire, F.R.S. &amp;c."</p>
<p class="qa">Q Now read the letter? [<i>Read.</i>]</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you afterwards see Colonel Johnston
himself?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir; there was a message brought that Major
Johnston wanted to speak to me; and just as I received it, as I
was moving forward, he met me at the door of the
drawing-room.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Who were present when you saw him?</p>
<p class="qa">A Mr Griffin, my secretary, I believe, was present,
and Mr Campbell; I don't know whether some of my servants may not
have been there also.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What passed when you saw Colonel Johnston?</p>
<p class="qa">A What he said was just to the amount of the
letter; that he had put me under arrest by the advice of his
officers, and therefore commanded me to remain under the arrest
that he had placed me in.</p>
<p class="qa">Q To your own knowledge, was any thing done to your
papers, public and private, and by whom?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Only state what you know yourself.</p>
<p class="qa">A I know that every thing,&mdash;my commission, all
my papers, a cabinet, and desk, that were in one of the
rooms,&mdash;were taken possession of by Mr John Blaxland, who is
one of those gentlemen that have come home; Mr Grimes, Mr
Jamieson, Dr Townson, and Mr Blaxcell, as named in my dispatch,
which I will take my solemn oath is every word of it correct.
These were taken possession of, all my private drawers ransacked,
every thing was taken out of this room, and huddled into another,
where they were locked up, the door sealed, and two sentries put
over it; that I might have no access to the papers.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Who were then left with you, and in what state
were you left?</p>
<p class="qa">A I was left with only two ladies; one of them my
daughter, the other was a Mrs Palmer: the servants remained in
the house.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you make any application relative to your
secretary, Mr Griffin?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What was that application; to whom did you make
it, and what was the answer?</p>
<p class="qa">A I said "Major Johnston, I suppose you will not
take my secretary away, he may remain with me?" for all the
magistrates were seized and carried I knew not where, I knew
nothing of where they were carried till afterwards; there was
only a Mr Campbell at this time in the house. Major Johnston
said, "O yes, certainly, Mr Griffin may remain&mdash;but stop,"
says he, "Mr Bayly," (Mr Bayly was the person who brought every
message to me, and was the secretary of Major Johnston ever
afterward,)&mdash;Major Johnston said, "Stop, Mr Bayly, go and
ask the inhabitants outside, whether they approve of Mr Griffin's
remaining here." Away he ran: he was absent I suppose about a
minute, or not so much; then he comes back to Major Johnston, and
says, "It is not approved of." In consequence, the secretary was
not suffered to remain with me; and I was left the only person in
the house with my daughter and Mrs Palmer, as I before
stated.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Where were you left?</p>
<p class="qa">A In my own house.</p>
<p class="qa">Q From this time who acted as Governor?</p>
<p class="qa">A Major Johnston.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Do you, of your own knowledge, know of any acts
or proclamations of Colonel Johnston, at or about this time,
relating to martial law, or to the superseding of your officers,
and the appointment of others?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, I heard it mentioned in the house at the
time, that Major Johnston&mdash;</p>
<p class="qa">Q Do you know what was done with your public and
private papers?</p>
<p class="qa">A They were all put into one room on the night of
the 26th.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What has become of them since?</p>
<p class="qa">A On the 27th, or the day after, committees were
appointed, by a written order from Major Johnston, to come and
examine my papers.</p>
<p class="qa">Q How do you know they were written orders?</p>
<p class="qa">A Because the secretary, Mr Bayly, brought the
orders he was to act upon, and the papers themselves are
forth-coming to show that Major Johnston directed it.</p>
<p class="qa">Q You saw this written order?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, they came to me with it: Bayly walked in at
the head of this committee, as the principal mover of the thing,
and read the paper That his honour the Lieutenant Governor had
ordered them to come and do so and so.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was any thing done with respect to your
establishment at this time, as to allowances?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, there was.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What?</p>
<p class="qa">A Major Johnston informed me by letter, that
whatever I might want would be furnished me, and charged
according to the Government prices, or the prices then misting in
the colony, and that an account of such charges should be
transmitted home to his Majesty's Secretary of State, to know
whether I was to pay them or not.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Have you got that letter?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Your allowance was to cease from that
time?</p>
<p class="qa">A I did not consider so.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: But you understand so from that
order?</p>
<p class="qa">A No.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: What was the use of the order?</p>
<p class="qa">A I could not understand what the order meant,
further than that I was to have what I wanted, but I was to pay
for it.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Why should you not pay for what you
had?</p>
<p class="qa">A The rations and whatever things are taken out of
the government stores in the settlement are issued under the
orders of the Governor, by the commissary, and he takes an
account of it; all the Governor's provisions come from the
Government stock, and the Governor would have nothing to eat if
he had not the command of the Government stock; the Governor has
the sole power to use every thing, and if he had not the command
of the Government stock he would have nothing to live upon but
salt meat.</p>
<p class="qa">PROSECUTOR:</p>
<p class="qa">Q Where, and in what state, were you kept during
the time that Colonel Johnston continued to act as the
Governor?</p>
<p class="qa">A I was confined to Government House, with
permission from Major Johnston to go any where in the garden for
the air, having sentinels to attend me, whose orders were to keep
at about six paces from me; which orders they in general strictly
fulfilled,&mdash;so much so, that at times, when my daughter has
been walking with me arm in arm, we could not speak for the
interruption of a sentinel; we could say nothing to each other in
close conversation, the sentinels kept so close to us; we were
insulted and treated in the most cruel manner.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Who succeeded Colonel Johnston in the government,
and when?</p>
<p class="qa">A Major Johnston continued in the government till
July, 1808, I believe, when Colonel Foveaux came. I believe it
was about the 29th of July that Colonel Foveaux arrived.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Is. Colonel Foveaux senior officer to
Colonel Paterson?</p>
<p class="qa">A No, he is not senior to Colonel Paterson; he came
out from England as Lieutenant Governor of Norfolk Island, and
brought a letter to me from the Secretary of State, requiring me
not to suffer him to remain at Port Jackson, but to send him off
to Norfolk Island, there to carry into execution the orders that
were contained in my dispatch. He brought me this letter. I
informed Colonel Foveaux what my orders were, and he had himself
orders from the Secretary of State. Upon his arrival, having a
sanguine hope that he would unite with me in getting the colony
again into my hands, I sent some of my friends to wait upon him.
Mr Macarthur, however, and his adherents had got to the ship
first, and my friends could only succeed in getting a letter on
board, but which they did, and he received it. The letter from me
was my positive orders, as Commander in Chief, that be should put
himself at the head of the New South Wales Corps, and reinstate
me in my government.</p>
<p class="qa">PROSECUTOR:</p>
<p class="qa">Q What and in what state were you when Colonel
Foveaux succeeded Major Johnston?</p>
<p class="qa">A I remained in the Government House confined, and
suffered many indignities until the first of January, 1809, when
Colonel Paterson arrived.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Who succeeded Colonel Foveaux?</p>
<p class="qa">A Colonel Paterson.</p>
<p class="qa">Q When?</p>
<p class="qa">A On the first of January, 1809.</p>
<p class="qa">Q That is, he arrived at Sydney on the first of
January, 1809[?]</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, he arrived then.</p>
<p class="qa">Q How long did you remain under arrest?</p>
<p class="qa">A From the 26th of January, 1808, until the 20th of
February, 1809, at which time I got possession of my ship, in
which I was proclaimed, or rather, I was proscribed, as an
outlaw, and every person in the colony was ordered, upon pain of
punishment, not to supply me or my family with any food or
article whatever. I was completely outlawed; and in this
situation I remained till about the middle of January, 1810, when
I determined, having waited with great impatience, and no
succours coming to me for two years, to proceed to head quarters,
there to wait, and to support myself in the best manner I could
by seizing provisions out of the shipping, which was the only
means I had. I did seize them: but on my arrival at Sydney, I
found that Colonel Macquarie of the 73d regiment had arrived,
with orders from his Majesty to reinstate me in my
government.</p>
<p class="qa">Q When was this?</p>
<p class="qa">A The middle of January, 1810; Colonel Macquarie
arrived in December, 1809, I believe the last day of the year. I
had been just two years without hearing a word from England. I
went to Sydney, not only to wait there, but intending to defend
myself when I was there; because had there been no change of
government, they would have attacked me the moment they
arrived.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Where did you remain during the time you were
under arrest?</p>
<p class="qa">A At the Government House.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Then on the 20th of February, 1809, you state
that you got possession of a ship?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Where did you get possession of that ship?</p>
<p class="qa">A It was his Majesty's ship the Porpoise, which I
commanded.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Where was she lying?</p>
<p class="qa">A She was lying in Sydney Cove.</p>
<p class="qa">Q That is opposite Government House?</p>
<p class="qa">A It is opposite Government House, but I had been
carried to close confinement before that by Major Johnston I was
taken up to a subaltern's barrack because I would not consent to
give up my ship.</p>
<p class="qa">Q You have stated that you were under confinement
in the Government House from the 26th of January, 1808, to the
20th of February, 1809?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Now you say before the end of that period, you
were taken up to the barracks?</p>
<p class="qa">A Speaking generally to the question, that was the
answer: I was under arrest till the 20th of February, 1809, for
the most part in the Government House; but within that period of
time a proposal was made to me by Colonel Paterson; that is,
Major Johnston came down with orders from Colonel Paterson.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Are you speaking now to what you know?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes.</p>
<p class="qa">Q How do you know that Major Johnston came down to
you with orders from Colonel Paterson?</p>
<p class="qa">A Because he shewed me the orders; he and Captain
Abbott came down to Government House from Colonel Paterson, with
written orders first of all that I should give up his Majesty's
ship the Porpoise, to go according to their own direction to
Norfolk Island or some where else. My answer was, I will never
comply with any orders from you; Sand it is at your peril, and at
the peril of any one else, to take that ship, with my broad
pendant, from me, sir; you shall not have her. Then the prisoner
said, I am very sorry, sir, but I have orders, that unless you
comply with his Honour's request, you are to proceed with us up
to a subaltern's barrack, which is prepared for you at the
barracks. I then desired that I might have the order, which was
not granted; but my secretary was allowed to take a copy of it,
which was compared with the original. Their Majesties' pictures
were at the end of the room covered with a piece of gauze: "I
said to Colonel Johnston, It is a fortunate thing their
Majesties' faces are covered, that they cannot see this
transaction": upon which Major Johnston replied, "Sir, you must
go with us."</p>
<p class="qa">Q Then you went with Major Johnston to this
subaltern's barrack?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes.</p>
<p class="qa">Q How long did you remain there?</p>
<p class="qa">A About a week. They took me to this subaltern's
barrack, and my daughter ran after me, just seizing hold of my
arm as we entered; she fainted away in my arms. I called to Major
Johnston to get me some water; but instead of procuring any,
thinking this was the time to get the better of me, while my
daughter was in this situation, he came up with a fresh message
from the Lieutenant Governor, to tell me, "Sir, I am come with an
order from the Lieutenant Governor, that you are to prepare
yourself to embark on board the Estramina (which is a small
schooner) as soon as she arrives." I asked Major Johnston where
she was going: he said, "I don't know," made a low bow, and
retired; and the whole affair was conducted with as much awful
ceremony as possible.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What became of you at the expiration of the
week?</p>
<p class="qa">A At the expiration of the week I was permitted to
return to the Government House, under conditions. Upon my being
placed in the barracks, I remained there for a week, during which
time there was a good deal said to induce me to give up the
command of my ship; and at last it came to a treaty and agreement
with Colonel Paterson, that I should go home in the Gambier, a
merchant ship; and the farce was carried so far, that I was
desired to mark out such accommodations as I wished to have on
board the ship. I sent a statement of the accommodations which I
thought would be necessary, to Colonel Paterson. He sent me back
word that the accommodations I had marked out were too large; and
I learned afterward, that Mr Macarthur and Major Johnston were to
go home in this vessel. It was a large ship, and they did
ultimately proceed to England in her. When this was determined
upon, I desired to have no farther communications in writing; but
that if any thing was to be done they should send an officer. Mr
Finucane then came, and made proposals for my taking the command
of my ship the Porpoise.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Who was Mr Finucane?</p>
<p class="qa">A He was secretary to Colonel Fouveaux at that
time.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What were the terms?</p>
<p class="qa">A For me to return to England. I took the Porpoise
upon the terms they had proposed to me; and the moment I got the
command of the Porpoise I took care to keep it, and would not
suffer any of their terms, or any thing which they said, to have
the least influence upon my mind; I took the command of the ship,
and the command of the colony again, by which means I saved the
lives and properties of many of his Majesty's subjects. I
considered myself, the moment I got on board my ship, as the
legal Governor of the country, and so I considered myself to the
last.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Then you went straight from the barracks to the
Porpoise?</p>
<p class="qa">A I went from Government House to the Porpoise.</p>
<p class="qa">Q But you stated, that when this proposal was made
to you, you were confined in the barracks?</p>
<p class="qa">A Upon my agreeing to the terms which they proposed
the carriage was brought, and I was taken back to Government
House, whence I was to embark.</p>
<p class="qa">Q How long did you remain in Government House
before you embarked?</p>
<p class="qa">A I should think about a fortnight, or a little
better; they agreed that I should embark on the 20th. I was more
anxious to embark on the 20th than they were, for if I had waited
till the 21st, I believe they would not have permitted me to
embark at all.</p>
<p class="qa">Q On the 20th of what month did you embark?</p>
<p class="qa">A Of February, 1809.</p>
<p class="qa">Q You have said, in the former part of your
examination, that you remained under arrest from the 26th of
January, 1809 [sic]; then, you say, you took possession of the
Porpoise?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir; that is correct.</p>
<p class="qa">Q In which situation you remained till the middle
of January, 1810; you remained on board the Porpoise all that
time?</p>
<p class="qa">A All that time.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Where were you in the Porpoise?</p>
<p class="qa">A At the Derwent, waiting for succours, I sailed
from Port Jackson to the Derwent on the 17th of March, having
taken possession of the ship the 20th of February: the people
thought I was going to England,&mdash;that was the condition on
which the ship had been given up to me; but instead of going to
England, I took the command again, and went to the southward.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you land at the Derwent?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir; and saw Colonel Collins there, who,
when I arrived, united himself to me, and I landed.</p>
<p class="qa">Q He acknowledged your authority?</p>
<p class="qa">A He acknowledged my authority, he was very happy
to see me, and we remained there on the best terms a week or a
fortnight; when a Gazette containing a proclamation was sent down
from Colonel Paterson at head-quarters, proscribing me and my
family, and prohibiting all descriptions of persons from having
any communication with me. Colonel Paterson wrote at the same
time to Colonel Collins in such a way, that nothing I could say
to him could prevent his mind being alienated from me. I had been
accustomed always to sleep on board my ship, leaving my daughter
on shore for the sake of her health at the Government House, with
her servants; in short, I did not dare to quit my ship at night,
because I had my suspicions; and the first symptom I perceived of
Colonel Collins's being inclined to unite with the
Lieutenant-Governor was, that proceeding one morning about eight
o'clock to my daughter's apartments, I found the sentinel was
taken from off the door.</p>
<p class="qa">Q When was this?</p>
<p class="qa">A About a fortnight after. I had been there;
between that and three weeks.</p>
<p class="qa">Q The sentinel had been placed over the door as a
mark of respect?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir; every mark of respect, by salutes and
otherwise, was shewn to me up to this moment.</p>
<p class="qa">Q By Colonel Collins?</p>
<p class="qa">A By Colonel Collins. This circumstance struck me
with a good deal of suspicion: I desired my daughter to take hold
of my arm; and having walked out a little way, I told her what I
thought. I said to her, "I will direct the boat's crew, as many
as we can muster, to get your things out of your room, for this
is so suspicious a circumstance that I will take you on board
instantly;" and I got her on board immediately. There I remained;
Colonel Collins having united with the orders that were sent down
from Port Jackson, which I endeavoured publicly to counteract as
much as was in my power: nevertheless, Colonel Collins remained
united with Colonel Paterson, and were no longer upon any
friendly footing.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Then you remained on board your vessel?</p>
<p class="qa">A I remained on board my vessel, getting some
trivial supplies from the captains of ships, and some fresh beef
I got from a man of the name of George Guest, who did it in
opposition to Colonel Collins, setting him at defiance. Of a few
poor unfortunate settlers, who endeavoured to get off a few fowls
and some mutton to my daughter, some were seized and flogged, and
one poor man, whose name was Belbin, received, I believe, four or
five hundred lashes, and was imprisoned, for the relief he had
given to my daughter.</p>
<p class="qa">Q You remained on board your ship till you returned
to Sydney, in the middle of January, 1810?</p>
<p class="qa">A Just so.</p>
<p class="qa">Q There you found Colonel Macquarie arrived, with
orders to reinstate you?</p>
<p class="qa">A To reinstate me in my command.</p>
<p class="qa">Q How far is the Derwent from Sydney?</p>
<p class="qa">A It is considered about ten days' or a fortnight's
sail.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Is that Colonel Johnston's hand-writing?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir, it is.</p>
<p class="qa">BLIGH: I beg leave to mention to the Court, there
was a proclamation issued in the beginning of this business which
is of the utmost importance, and which shews the character of the
whole of the transaction better than any thing else: it is a
turbulent proclamation, ending&mdash;"Soldiers, you have done
your duty! you have now put the credit of the New South Wales
Corps on a footing which is not to be shaken!"&mdash;in short,
worded in all the revolutionary phraseology of France.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Have you that proclamation?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir; it shall be produced to-morrow.
<i>Adjourned.</i></p>
<br>

<a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a>
<h3>SECOND DAY&mdash;Examination of Bligh
(<i>continued</i>.)</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> <i>Second Day</i> was mostly occupied in
explaining the evidence before given. It also appeared, as the
Judge Advocate observed, 'that Governor Bligh, upon his return to
Sydney, had delivered to him, by Governor Macquarie, a letter
from the Secretary of State to him, Captain Bligh, stating, that
directions were sent out by Governor Macquarie to reinstate him
in the government for twenty-four hours, when he was to be
superseded by Colonel Macquarie. Then the fact appeared, that
Governor Bligh was not reinstated, and that the reason of that
was, that he was absent from Sydney at the time that Colonel
Macquarie arrived; therefore Colonel Macquarie had but one
alternative to follow, either to leave the colony without a
Governor until Captain Bligh should return, or to assume the
government himself; and having once assumed it, he could not
depose himself in order to reinstate Governor Bligh for
twenty-four hours.' The letter was produced, directed to Governor
Bligh; and this letter, Governor Bligh stated, was delivered to
him, on his arrival at Sydney, by Governor Macquarie.</p>

<h3>THIRD DAY&mdash;Cross-examination of Bligh.</h3>
<br>
<p class="qa">JOHNSTON: It appears by your evidence, that you
acted as Governor of New South Wales about seventeen months: had
you ever been before that time in a situation that gave you the
command of land forces?</p>
<p class="qa">BLIGH: No; marines I have, but not the regular
troops of the line.</p>
<p class="qa">Q How often has it happened, in the course of your
service in the navy, that you have found it necessary to bring
officers or others to courts martial for mutiny or other similar
offences?</p>
<p class="qa">A I think about twice, I have brought persons to a
court martial; twice or thrice, I suppose, in the course of forty
years constant and active service.</p>
<p class="qa">Q How many courts martial have you obtained against
individuals for other offences?</p>
<p class="qa">A Really, gentlemen, it is hard for me to answer
such a question; the world knows perfectly well, that in 178[9]
there was a mutiny on board the ship Bounty: I presume that is
what they allude to; I don't know any other mutiny that I have
had any thing to do with, except that dreadful mutiny at the
Nore, in which, of course, I was not particularly concerned.</p>
<p class="qa">Q How often has it happened, in the course of your
service in the navy, that you have found it necessary to bring
individuals to courts martial for mutiny or similar offences?</p>
<p class="qa">A Oh! for mutiny&mdash;in the year 178[9], when the
ship Bounty was taken from my command by the mutiny of the
people, and myself with some others turned into an open boat, and
set adrift from the ship in the Pacific Ocean, and these
circumstances stand recorded in public history, and prove that
the way in which I was turned out of that ship was most
honourable to me as commander of her, and on the public trial of
the mutineers, when the members of the Court were investigating
the case, and a witness was giving evidence, they put this
question to him: "In what situation was your captain when the
mutineer officers were standing with their swords drawn round
him?" he replied, "Standing in his shirt with his hands tied
behind his back."</p>
<br>
<p>[Here the Judge Advocate offered some observations, after
which Governor Bligh proceeded.]</p>
<p class="qa">A If the Court would allow me, I would say this in
explanation. In the year 1787, I was sent out in the command of
his Majesty's ship Bounty, to bring the bread-fruit from Otaheite
to the West Indies, and to explore the passage between New
Holland and New Guinea. In the course of this voyage it was that
a part of my crew mutinied; they seized and tied me in my shirt,
with my hands behind my back, and put me at last into the boat,
and then set us adrift. We were forty-eight days and nights
without any relief, and with scarcely any food to support life:
however, I got home at last, having escaped the greatest dangers,
of climate and the sea. Immediately upon my coming home, my King
called upon me a second time to proceed on the same voyage, which
was beside the most dangerous voyage that could then be
performed, as no man at that time knew any thing about the
geography of that part of the world. I was allowed to fit out two
ships in any manner that I liked: I did fit out two ships, and
sailed on the voyage. In the mean-time, while I was fitting those
ships out, a ship was sent in search of the mutineers; that ship
was the Pandora: it was equipped, and it sailed. I went upon the
voyage which I had been ordered upon, and returned, after fully
accomplishing the objects of my mission; and upon my return, I
found the Pandora had gone out but had not returned, for she got
aground is the very passage between New Guinea and New Holland
which I had been sent out to explore, and was lost, and it was a
miracle that the captain and any of the men reached home again.
But although the ship got into this dangerous situation, the
captain did not forget his duty to secure the mutineers: he had
been fortunate enough to lay hold of some of them, and he brought
home; I was absent all that time, on that most dangerous voyage,
and these men were brought home; they were tried in my absence;
most of them were convicted, some were executed, and some were
reprieved.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Then do I understand your answer to be, that the
men of the Bounty are the only persons brought to a court martial
for mutiny with which you have ever had any concern, you having
stated what the transaction was?</p>
<p class="qa">A Those are all that I recollect.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Then another question is, How many courts martial
have you obtained against individuals for other offences?</p>
<p class="qa">A To the best of my recollection, about three; but
if there have been three score, if the prisoner will be so good
as to mention them, I will tell him whether he is right or
not.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Have you ever been brought to a court martial,
and for what?</p>
<p class="qa">A I was brought to a court martial for the loss of
the Bounty: and my lieutenant, who, I understand, is now turned
out of the service, brought me to a trial when I commanded his
Majesty's ship the Warrior, a seventy-four.</p>
<p class="qa">Q And for what? the latter part of the question
is.</p>
<p class="qa">A I cannot say how the charge was worded; but the
amount of it, I recollect, was, that I had sent for him to do his
duty when he had a lame foot, which he had embarked on board the
ship with, but made a pretence of it when I sent for him on duty,
and said that it was an act of tyranny on my part to send for
him, or the word might be, oppression.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What was the result of that last court martial to
which you have spoken?</p>
<p class="qa">A I think, to the best of my recollection, that the
affair terminated with the Court, saying, they recommended to
Captain Bligh to be more cautious in his expressions; I think
that was just to the amount of it, word for word.</p>
<p class="qa">Q When you had prohibited the traffic in spirits,
did you enforce the order you had issued with impartiality?</p>
<p class="qa">A In the most impartial manner.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was not Andrew Thomson your bailiff convicted by
the magistrates in the penalty of 100<i>l</i>. for selling part
of a puncheon of spirits; and did you not remit the penalty?</p>
<p class="qa">A Andrew Thomson was the man who had charge of a
little farm of mine; it was through my rigid impartiality that he
was detected in the offence of making an improper use of a
quantity of spirits which had been intrusted to his care for
distribution among the settlers in the interior; and it was by my
order to the Judge Advocate that he was brought to trial; and I
would have nothing to do with him afterwards; he was in the hands
of the magistrates, and I had nothing more to do with him.</p>
<p class="qa">Q The latter part of the question is, And did you
not remit the penalty?</p>
<p class="qa">A No; I recollect nothing of the kind, of remitting
the penalty; I was so incensed, I thought the penalty too light:
he had been guilty of a breach of faith, which I thought
deserving of the highest punishment.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you immediately dismiss him from your
service?</p>
<p class="qa">A I dismissed him from my service so far, that I
never allowed him to come near me afterwards: the usurpation came
on very soon afterwards, and there were several things be had to
account for, but he never came into my confidence again, though
he supplicated in the strongest manner; but there were some
circumstances of my affairs which I had to settle with him, and
he was obliged to come to me for that purpose, and I saw him upon
that occasion.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was he not always continued as your agent; and
did he not in that quality correspond with you in the most
confidential manner?</p>
<p class="qa">A He had the impudence to address me on other
subjects beside the little trust which was confided in him, and I
reprimanded him for it in the severest manner.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Was the penalty remitted by the
magistrates?</p>
<p class="qa">A Really I cannot positively speak to that.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: You have stated, that after he was in the
hands of the magistrates you had nothing more to do with him?</p>
<p class="qa">A I do not believe it was remitted at all, I know
nothing of its being remitted; but, sir, the magistrates will be
forthcoming as witnesses to speak to the fact.</p>
<p class="qa">JOHNSTON:</p>
<p class="qa">Q Will Captain Bligh add to that, that <i>he</i>
did not remit it?</p>
<p class="qa">A I really cannot call the thing to recollection,
but the magistrates will be forthcoming; I do not recollect, upon
my oath, that it was remitted: on the contrary, upon my oath I
should declare that it was <i>not</i> remitted; that is my idea
of it, but the magistrates will be forthcoming to prove the
facts.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: You have spoken of an individual of the
name of Macarthur; Was not that Mr Macarthur one of the principal
settlers in the colony?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes.</p>
<p class="qa">JUDGE ADVOCATE: Had he the authority of his
Majesty's government for a grant of 5000 acres of land?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, I believe so; he certainly had such a grant;
I was so informed by a member of his Majesty's government, but it
was before my government.</p>
<p class="qa">JOHNSTON:</p>
<p class="qa">Q Together with the power of employing a certain
number of labourers, for forwarding a project of great public
importance, that of raising very fine wool, which should
supercede or supply the want of Spanish wool?</p>
<p class="qa">A I heard that government had been informed by Mr
Macarthur that such he could produce, and that every indulgence
was granted by government to enable him to do that.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: This grant was before your
appointment?</p>
<p class="qa">A Before my appointment, sir; I found him there in
that situation; he had sheep, but he had no quantity of wool in
his possession when I arrived.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Did you ever forward or endeavour to
forward, or did you oppose and thwart, the execution of these
declared intentions of his Majesty's government?</p>
<p class="qa">A I did every thing in my power to forward the
views of his Majesty's government</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: In this respect?</p>
<p class="qa">A In that respect.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Did you not damn the Privy Council and
Secretary of State, and say that Macarthur should not keep the
grant of land which he held by order of the Secretary of
State?</p>
<p class="qa">A No. I declare to God I never did.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Did you not, in the hearing of Major
Abbott use these words, or others to the like effect: 'Damn the
Secretary of State; what do I care for him, he commands in
England, and I command here?'</p>
<p class="qa">A I know nothing about it.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Did you not say, in the presence of
Lieutenant Minchin: 'I don't care a damn for the Secretary of
State; he is but a clerk in office, in to-day, and out
to-morrow?'</p>
<p class="qa">A I did not.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Will you venture to restate, upon your
oath, that you never did utter any of those expressions, or any
words to the like effect?</p>
<p class="qa">A To the best of my recollection, I know of nothing
of this kind of conversation taking place.</p>
<br>
<p>[After some other questions respecting houses being pulled
down and lands seized by order of Governor Bligh, the
interrogator proceeded.]</p>
<p class="qa">JOHNSTON:</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you not by force, and against the will of Mr
Harris, the agent of Captain Kent, seize and take to your own use
a fine English bull, the only one in the colony, and the property
of Captain Kent?</p>
<p class="qa">A Never.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was Mr Atkins your confidential law-adviser?</p>
<p class="qa">A He was my public law-adviser, not a confidential
one: he was Judge Advocate to the colony.</p>
<p class="qa">Q The question is, Was he your confidential
law-advisor?</p>
<p class="qa">A He was the public law-officer of the colony; I
had no private confidence with Mr Atkins, but if any thing was to
be done concerning the law he was called.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Had you a high opinion of his ability and
integrity?</p>
<p class="qa">A Whatever opinion I had of Mr Atkins, I thought
proper to keep to myself, as I do now. I do not conceive it
proper, that upon a request coming in this way, I should say
whether that man is one thing or another.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: I should certainly think it not
necessary.</p>
<p class="qa">A I only object to it, because my opinion of Mr
Atkins might not be favourable.</p>
<p class="qa">JOHNSTON:</p>
<p class="qa">Q Have you not expressed yourself of Mr Atkins in
these terms: 'He has been accustomed to inebriety; he has been
the ridicule of the community; sentence of death has been
pronounced in moments of intoxication; his determination is weak;
his opinion floating and infirm; his knowledge of the law is
insignificant, and subject to private inclination; and
confidential causes of the crown, where due secrecy is required,
he is not to be trusted with?'</p>
<p class="qa">A That paper, sir, which you have now read, was a
secret document transmitted by me to the Secretary of State in
sure confidence.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Do you know a person of the name of George
Crosley?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Do you not know that he was a man of most
infamous character, and was transported to New South Wales for
perjury?</p>
<p class="qa">A I know nothing of his character, but that he was
sent out from England to New South Wales, that win any way
injurious to him.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: That is, sent out as a convict?</p>
<p class="qa">A He was transported, but I know nothing of the
circumstances; it was many years ago, I understand.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Before you arrived?</p>
<p class="qa">A O yes, sir, a long time before I arrived.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Did you find him as a settler?</p>
<p class="qa">A As a settler, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Not as a convict?</p>
<p class="qa">A As a settler, and not as a convict. I believe Mr
Macarthur and every officer in the colony employed him as an
attorney, more or less, as they could get hold of him.</p>

<h3>FOURTH DAY&mdash;Witnesses for the Crown.</h3>
<br>
<a name="ch-50" id="ch-50"></a>
<p><b>John Palmer</b> [Commissary and Magistrate; dismissed after
the mutiny] sworn, and <i>examined on the part of the
Prosecution</i>.</p>
<p class="qa">PROSECUTOR: When did you first go out to New South
Wales?</p>
<p class="qa">PALMER: With Governor Phillips.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What time was that?</p>
<p class="qa">A In 1788.</p>
<p class="qa">Q How long have you resided there?</p>
<p class="qa">A Ever since: I first went out as Purser of the
Sirius, and was appointed Commissary on the 12th of April,
1790.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were you there while Gov. Bligh was the
governor?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q And in what situation?</p>
<p class="qa">A As Commissary.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Had you any particular means of knowing the
sentiments of the settlers at different times during your
residence there?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What were they; and when did the settlers appear
to you in general to be best satisfied with the government of the
colony?</p>
<p class="qa">A In Governor Bligh's time; more so, I think, than
in any other governor's.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What was the conduct of Governor Bligh in
general, and particularly with respect to the administration of
justice in the settlement?</p>
<p class="qa">A He always administered justice, according to my
ideas, impartially to every body and to all ranks of people.</p>
<p class="qa">Q During the government of Gov. Bligh, and
particularly January, 1808, before the 26th, in what state was
the colony; were any persons discontented?</p>
<p class="qa">A I never heard of any. I never saw the colony in a
more thriving state, or people in general better satisfied.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Had any thing taken place relating to the barter
of spirits which had excited discontent?</p>
<p class="qa">A I don't recollect particularly; if there was any
discontent, it was occasioned by that.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was there any danger of revolt or insurrection in
January, 1808, if the military had remained obedient to the
Governor?</p>
<p class="qa">A No, sir, none whatever.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were you present at the meeting of the
magistrates on the 16th of December concerning Mr
Macarthur[?]</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was Col. Johnston there?</p>
<p class="qa">A He was, sir; one of the members.</p>
<p class="qa">Q How did Mr Macarthur behave on that occasion?</p>
<p class="qa">A He was before the second bench, on the 17th, when
he behaved in a very violent manner.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did the public service suffer in consequence of
your being turned out of your office, and the stores or your
papers taken from you?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, I conceive very much, from the stores being
afterwards very improperly applied.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were you examined upon any business on the
27th?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir, I was.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was Major Johnston there?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, he was.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did Major Johnston take any part while he was
there?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, he administered an oath to me, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Who examined you?</p>
<p class="qa">A Mr Bayly, who was his secretary, Mr Blaxcell, and
another gentleman whose name I do not recollect at present.</p>
<p class="qa">Q To what were you examined?</p>
<p class="qa">A They required that I should relate all I knew
respecting Governor Bligh's administration; but indeed I was so
flurried and confused at the time, that I cannot charge my memory
with every thing that passed.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: What are the number of inhabitants in
that part of the colony?</p>
<p class="qa">A I should suppose from three to four thousand,
men, women, and children.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Not including the soldiers?</p>
<p class="qa">A I should suppose there might be about two or
three thousand inhabitants.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Including the convicts?</p>
<p class="qa">A Including the convicts about three thousand; I
know it from the numbers that were victualled there.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: What was the number of troops?</p>
<p class="qa">A I suppose, sir, between four and five
hundred.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: You mean the number of troops between
four and five hundred, within the same range within which you
have described the number of inhabitants to be between two and
three thousand?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, there were more than four hundred I am
sure.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Had you any knowledge of or connexion
with Capt. Bligh previous to his arrival as Governor in the
colony?</p>
<p class="qa">A I never saw him before, nor heard of him
before.<br></p>
<p>Mr Palmer <i>cross-examined</i> by Lieut. Col. Johnston.</p>
<p class="qa">JOHNSTON: Was not Col. Johnston the oldest military
officer in the colony?</p>
<p class="qa">PALMER: In that part of the colony, at Sydney.</p>
<p class="qa">Q How long had Col. Johnston been there?</p>
<p class="qa">A He went out at the first formation of the
settlement, the same time that I went.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Had any other officer been there so long a
time?</p>
<p class="qa">A Not that I know of, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was not his conduct uniformly quiet and
submissive to the authority of the several Governors in your
time?</p>
<p class="qa">A Until the 26th of January, sir, I never knew him
otherwise.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was there any reason for considering him a
discontented person in January, 1808?</p>
<p class="qa">A No reason that I know of, except, as I said
before, on account of the barter of spirits; but that cannot
speak particularly to.</p>
<br>
<a name="ch-51" id="ch-51"></a>
<p><b>Mr Robert Campbell</b>, a naval officer, and a magistrate
for about seven months, deposed, that the colonists were very
quiet and contented under the government of William Bligh, Esq.
and that the mutiny arose from the dissatisfaction which his
regulations concerning spirits created amongst the civil and
military officers. On his cross examination he admitted that the
fine of 100<i>l</i>. incurred by Andrew Thompson for selling
spirits contrary to the general order had never been paid to him
as treasurer of the public funds; that Col. Johnston's habits of
life were very retired, and that he never heard any officer
complain of the Governor's regulations with respect to spirits.
He also acknowledged that Mr Crosley was a very dishonest man,
and that he was consulted by the Governor in the dispute
respecting the criminal court.</p>
<p><b>Mr Francis Oakes</b>, chief constable of Parramatta and its
district, deposed, that the Colony under the Government of
Captain Bligh was very flourishing and peaceable, and that after
the Governor's arrest he himself was removed from his office, and
obliged to remove his family to a friend's house, the people of
Parramatta being much enraged against him. On his cross
examination it appeared that though his name as Constable had
been Gazetted, he was never swore into the office; and that the
barter for spirits and other goods, before Gov. Bligh's time, was
the common way of making, payments and exchanges throughout the
Colony.</p>
<br>
<a name="ch-52" id="ch-52"></a>
<p><b>Mr William Gore</b> [Provost-Marshall]
sworn.&mdash;<i>Examined on the part of the Prosecution.</i></p>
<p class="qa">PROSECUTOR: Were you in New South Wales during Gov.
Bligh's government; and in what situation?</p>
<p class="qa">GORE: I was there, sir, as Provost Marshal: I
arrived with. Gov. Bligh.</p>
<p class="qa">Q In what state was the colony previous to the 26th
of January 1808; and how were the colonists disposed towards the
Governor?</p>
<p class="qa">A The colonists generally from my knowledge of them
were extremely well disposed towards. Gov. Bligh, and the colony
was extremely tranquil.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What was the conduct of the Governor generally
during his government, especially relating to the administration
of justice; had you any, and if any what particular means of
judging of his conduct in that respect?</p>
<p class="qa">A As the Provost Marshal of the territory, I had at
all times a very general access to the Governor; all warrants of
execution were directed to me, and all sentences of magistrates
were carried into execution under my immediate orders. I have
myself made several applications in favour of individuals under
sentence of death, which were at all times attended to.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were any persons discontented with the measures
of the Government; and if so, who were discontented, and upon
what account?</p>
<p class="qa">A There were a number of individuals, sir,
discontented with the measures of the Governor, which in my
opinion originated in consequence of the suppression of certain
abuses which existed in the colony at the time of Gov. Bligh's
arrival.</p>
<p class="qa">Q State the nature of those abuses.</p>
<p class="qa">A One abuse (the suppression of which gave extreme
discontent) was the barter of spirits; another abuse (which had
prevailed very generally) was the circulation of private
notes-of-hand in that colony: those notes-of-hand on Gov. Bligh's
arrival, and previous to it, were drawn payable in colonial
currency; but the Governor issued general orders that such only
should pass in future which were drawn payable in sterling
money.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Are there any other measures of reform to which
you conceive these discontents are attributable?</p>
<p class="qa">A I think, sir, from the time of Gov. Bligh's
arrival in New South Wales till the time of the subversion of the
government, I acted as Provost Marshal, and for some months
before the latter period I was also acting as Superintendant of
the Police; and Gov. Bligh had at several times after I became
Superintendant of Police desired me to express to the Judge
Advocate his wish and his hope, that he would in future
discontinue the severe punishments to which the government
servants and the convicts indented to the settlers and others had
been subjected for minor offences. When I arrived in New South
Wales, and for some time after, it was not an uncommon thing for
individuals of that class to be imprisoned without a warrant from
any magistrate, and for corporal punishment to be inflicted to
obtain confession, of supposed crimes. I mentioned to Gov. Bligh,
as the custody of the gaol was in my charge, what I considered
the injustice and impropriety of confining these persons at the
will of any individual, and liberating them without any
investigation into their supposed offences, or the circumstances
under which they were confined; and I received the Governor's
orders to permit no man to be imprisoned without a warrant from a
magistrate, and that no prisoner should be liberated without his
discharge being submitted to myself.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did this produce any dissatisfaction?</p>
<p class="qa">A I think it did, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was there any danger of tumult or insurrection
about the end of January, 1808, if the military had supported the
Governor?</p>
<p class="qa">A None, sir, that I could see.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you know any thing concerning the removal, or
order for the removal, of some houses that stood within the
government boundary?</p>
<p class="qa">A I know some houses were removed.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Do you know any thing of the orders for that
purpose?</p>
<p class="qa">A There was a general order for the removal of the
houses within the government limits; the circumstances I really
cannot call to mind.</p>
<p class="qa">Q How many houses were there?</p>
<p class="qa">A I don't think there were six: if there were six,
to the best of my knowledge they did not exceed that number.</p>
<p>On his cross-examination he stated, that after Gov. Bligh's
arrest, he was imprisoned in the first instance; then he was
suspended from his situation; and after that, they brought a
charge against him for perjury and false imprisonment, kept him
in a dungeon for eleven weeks and four days, and then took him
from his wife and infant family, and sent him to the coal-mines
for four months.</p>
<br>
<p><a name="ch-53" id="ch-53"></a><b>The Rev. Mr [Henry]
Fulton</b>, acting Principal Chaplain in the colony, deposed to
the same effect as the preceding witnesses. He stated that he had
been suspended from his office for his attachment to the
Governor. Mr Griffin, Gov. Bligh's Secretary, gave similar
evidence. He was succeeded by <b>Mr [James] Williamson</b>, a
deputy Commissary of Stores and Provisions, who on his
cross-examination admitted that he had been tried, convicted,
cashiered, and fined, for applying the public stores to his own
use.</p>

<p class="qa">GRAY: Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q In what regiment?</p>
<p class="qa">A The 102d, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were you so in 1808, in New South Wales?</p>
<p class="qa">A I was, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you see any thing done with the guns near the
Government House on the 26th of January, before the Governor's
arrest?</p>
<p class="qa">A Not at Government House, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you with the guns at the barracks?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes; I went sentry on that day at four o'clock, I
think; and when I went on, after some considerable time, I saw
Serj. Whalley, which was Gov. Bligh's orderly serjeant, and I saw
some officers come on the parade with papers in their hands. Some
time after that, I saw Col. Johnston and Mr Minchin come in, in a
chaise, into the barracks; and there was an order given out, for
what soldiers were seen, to go to their quarters and put on their
accoutrements, and come quietly into the barracks through the
back way. Some time after this, the regiment fell in, and marched
towards Government House; and on or near about the time, I was
standing sentry upon the guns; the battalion guns were taken from
me, and run down into a magazine built upon the parade, and
loaded, and they appeared to be elevated towards Government
House.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Who ran them down?</p>
<p class="qa">A The additional gunners.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were you one of them?</p>
<p class="qa">A No, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: What was the state of the colony at this
time?</p>
<p class="qa">A I cannot pretend to say any thing about the state
of the colony; I did not see any thing of any noise or uproar
that was likely to be; I thought it was in a peaceable state.</p>

<p class="qa">CHAMPION: I am now a private soldier.</p>
<p class="qa">Q In what regiment?</p>
<p class="qa">A The 102d.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were you so in 1808?</p>
<p class="qa">A No, sir; in 1808 I was an acting serjeant-major,
and pay-serjeant to two companies.</p>
<p class="qa">Q After the arrest of Gov. Bligh, did you receive
any orders concerning him?</p>
<p class="qa">A I did, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you receive no orders respecting him till
1809?</p>
<p class="qa">A Not directly, in written orders; only that we
were to keep him a prisoner in Government House; and the guard
was regularly mounted over him, and not to admit the sentries to
let him go out of their sight; when be walked out of Government
House, he was not to leave him at a distance of more than seven
or eight paces.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you see any effigies after the Governor's
arrest?</p>
<p class="qa">A I did, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Of whom?</p>
<p class="qa">A The effigy was a picture of a naval officer; and
I know that Serj.-major Whittle at that time said, that he had
got the old tyrant and old villain's picture drawn in a proper
manner, and that he would expose it.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What was done with it?</p>
<p class="qa">A It was placed in his room, with a lamp on each
side, for the public inspection of any person who thought proper
to go there, let their character be what it would.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you see any persons there?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes; I saw a great number of persons go in and
out as they pleased.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was it carried out of the room at all?</p>
<p class="qa">A I did not see it out of the room.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you see it burnt?</p>
<p class="qa">A I saw a something burnt, an image of an effigy,
on the evening of the 28th.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Where?</p>
<p class="qa">A On the church hill, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Representing whom?</p>
<p class="qa">A There was no name mentioned; but at the time it
was thrown into the fire there were three loud shouts from the
people in general; and at that time there was a number of
officers and ladies walked by, apparently in parade order,
two-and-two; and the whole of that business was under the
direction of Serj.-major Whittle.</p>
<p class="qa">Q This, you say, was on the 28th?</p>
<p class="qa">A On the evening of the 28th?</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Who cheered; you say the people?</p>
<p class="qa">A I believe the soldiers and the convicts mixed
together.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: You say, a number of officers were
there?</p>
<p class="qa">A They were walking past along the road; I
particularly observed Lieutenant Colonel Johnston, Mr Minchin,
Major Abbott, a gentleman of the name of Macarthur, and some
ladies.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Who was the effigy intended to
represent?</p>
<p class="qa">A Why, all supposed Governor Bligh.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: That was the general impression?</p>
<p class="qa">A That was the general impression. The military
band that was there attended, and the moment after, they played a
tune which they called in common 'The Silly Old Man': they struck
it up immediately after the three shouts were over.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Do you know whether the effigy of
Governor Bligh that was kept in the Serjeant-major's room was
known to the prisoner?</p>
<p class="qa">A I can answer so far, that I heard the
Serjeant-major publicly say on the parade, in his own face, that
he would have exposed this effigy on the top of his house, only
that Colonel Johnston told him that it would hurt him in
England.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: What do you mean, that it would hurt the
Serjeant-major, or himself, Colonel Johnston?</p>
<p class="qa">A Hurt himself, the Serjeant-major.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Are you a friend of Serjeant
Whittle's?</p>
<p class="qa">A I don't know that we have ever been particular
enemies; I had been a serjeant a number of years until this
unfortunate affair happened, I was a serjeant ever since the
formation of the regiment. I have no particular enmity against
the man, more than against any other person.</p>

<p><a name="ch-56" id="ch-56"></a><b>Mr Martin Mason</b> [free
settler and surgeon] sworn&mdash;<i>Examined on the part of the
Prosecution</i>.</p>
<p class="qa">PROSECUTOR: How long, and during what period, sir,
have you resided in New South Wales?</p>
<p class="qa">MASON: From the beginning of the year 1798 until I
embarked for England with Gov. Bligh; but during that period I
sailed as acting-surgeon of his Majesty's ship Buffalo, to the
Cape of Good Hope, and returned with that ship.</p>
<p class="qa">Q In what situation had you been before the month
of January, 1808; and what were you at that time?</p>
<p class="qa">A I had been in the Commission of the Peace; I had
also been employed as Acting Assistant Surgeon, but was
superseded by a gentleman who obtained the appointment of
Assistant Surgeon in England.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What were you in January, 1808?</p>
<p class="qa">A I was a settler, and practised at a surgeon upon
my own account among the settlers in different parts of the
colony.</p>
<p class="qa">Q In what state was the colony at the time Gov.
Bligh took upon himself the government?</p>
<p class="qa">A In the most distressed state that a colony could
possibly be in: I myself have paid two shillings per pound for
Indian-corn bread.</p>
<p class="qa">Q In what state was it during the government of
Governor Bligh, and especially in the month of January, 1808?</p>
<p class="qa">A I believe at that time the primest samples of
wheat were from 8s. to 10s. per bushel. The settlers universally,
(and I believe no man had a better opportunity of knowing their
dispositions than I had, from the nature of my profession,)
contented and tranquil. There was the greatest abundance of grain
which I had ever known in the colony.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What was the conduct of Gov. Bligh, particularly
as to the administration of justice?</p>
<p class="qa">A Gov. Bligh I believe to be a strict
disciplinarian, and a man as impartial in the administration of
justice as any man that ever lived.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What was the state of the public mind in the
colony in consequence of the Governor's arrest; and in what
manner did this appear at the time, or soon afterwards?</p>
<p class="qa">A The greatest regret among the cultivators, and
every sober and industrious inhabitant, that so unfortunate an
event had taken place as the revolution, which it was generally
called.</p>
<p class="qa">Q In what state was the settlement during the three
or four days following the 26th of January; and what was the
conduct of the soldiers of the New South Wales Corps?</p>
<p class="qa">A About the 27th of January, the 28th, the 29th,
and 30th, and I believe the 31st, was a general state of
intoxication, riot, and confusion, with the detachment of
soldiers at the Green Hills, which however consisted only of
twelve, beside a serjeant and corporal; the serjeant who
commanded was present on the 29th, and directed the erection of a
gallows within fifty paces of my own door. A soldier of the name
of Butcher brought a cart-load or cart-loads of wood to make a
bonfire, and after dark they burnt the Governor and Mr Gore in
effigy, suspended from the gallows; at least they suspended
tarred hides, and called them effigies of the Governor and Mr
Gore. On the 28th of January, one Thomas Hobby, who had been an
officer in the New South Wales Corps; Mr Fitz, a deputy
commissary; and one Thomas Bigers, who kept a sort of grog-shop,
met at the house of one Andrew Thompson, and there drew up an
address to Maj. Johnston, sanctioning what had been done. They
had assembled a number of their dependents and adherents; and
when, they were heated with wine and spirits, they sallied out to
solicit signatures. I myself was solicited three times in that
day, and was told by Bigers and others, that if I did not sign it
I should be in the body of Sydney gaol within twenty-four
hours.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Do you know of any addresses having been prepared
and signed, requesting Colonel Paterson to repair to Sydney and
reinstate Gov. Bligh?</p>
<p class="qa">A I remember assisting in drawing one; I subscribed
it myself, and saw several others subscribe it, requesting Col.
Paterson to repair to Sydney, and again to place the inhabitants
under the protection of the king and the law.</p>
<br>
<p>Mr Mason <i>cross-examined</i> by Lieut.-Col. Johnston.</p>
<p class="qa">JOHNSTON: You say you were once a magistrate: did
not Gov. King dismiss you from the situation of a magistrate in
consequence of a charge that was brought against you, of extreme
inhumanity and indecency towards a female convict, named
Elizabeth Hastings?</p>
<p class="qa">MASON: It is a calumny: besides, I was never
dismissed from being a magistrate; and here is my appointment to
the command at Hunter's River, after I had been withdrawn by Gov.
King from Toongabbee, where the subject of this false accusation
is pretended to have taken place.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were you dismissed from the command at Hunter's
River?</p>
<p class="qa">A I was not dismissed: I withdrew from it,
assigning my reasons to Gov. King, who told me, that in
consequence of the then state of the colony, and the opposition
he was meeting with, he was unable to enforce his own measures:
from this cause it was I withdrew, and never returned to the
detachment at Hunter's River: and here is the document he gave me
on that occasion in his own hand-writing to resume my situation
as a magistrate at Toongabbee.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were you not removed by order of Governor King
from your command at the Coal River in consequence of your very
severe and cruel treatment of the convicts?</p>
<p class="qa">A I have answered that question already; I repeat
again, that it is a calumny; if it will not be intruding upon the
time of the court, I can relate the situation in which I found
that settlement when I went there. It had been under the command
of a corporal only, and it would shock humanity to give a precise
detail of the circumstances in which I found it. It was a
settlement consisting of the most desperate outcasts in the whole
country, who were sent there, 100 miles distance from Port
Jackson, as a punishment, and to prevent them from committing
those rapes, robberies, and other enormous excesses, that had
been greatly prevalent for a long period in the settlement of
Sydney: that is well known to every gentleman from the colony who
is now in England. In such a place, with such men as these to
govern, and without any one person of a different description,
but a corporal and six privates of the New South Wales Corps,
myself the only person there who had gone out a free settler, it
is easy to judge of the situation I was in when the convicts
mutinied. When the soldiers had taken a boat-load of provisions
and divided it among themselves and the convict women whom they
lived with, under pretence of arrears, the convicts then demanded
their arrears also; and upon my refusing to accede to their
demand, which if I had done I should have been left without a
week's provision in store; there was a mutiny among the convicts,
and through my own personal exertions I suppressed that mutiny: I
held the ringleader in my left hand, while I defended myself with
a pistol in the right, till he was secured and punished.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were you not in Gov. King's time convicted and
imprisoned for a misdemeanor?</p>
<p class="qa">A No; an action was brought, if it be necessary to
explain that: a civil action was brought against me by the Rev.
Mr Marsden, for writing an incautious letter to him, and which
was sent under seal; for which, by a court assembled expressly to
try that cause, he recovered damages to the amount of
250<i>l</i>. On the 1st of May he sent an apology to me,
proposing that, if I would sign and allow that apology to be
inserted in the Sydney Gazette, he would forgive the demises and
pay the costs. I have the apology in Court which I declined to
sign, and this is a copy of my letter to him.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you acquiesce in it?</p>
<p class="qa">A I did not, because the facts were true, although
rather incautiously stated, and in strong terms.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were you not, after the arrival of Col. Foveaux
in 1808, detected in working a private still, convicted, and the
conviction advertised in the Sydney Gazette?</p>
<p class="qa">A No; I was neither detected in working a still,
nor convicted of it. This is a copy of the warrant which was
issued upon that occasion. A still of ten gallons, it is true,
was seized and taken out of my house, but there are several
circumstances connected with that seizure which it will be
necessary for the Court to know. I had kept a still in my house
publicly and openly in a professional man; it might contain from
ten to twelve gallons, but did not exceed that: a warrant was
issued; and during my absence, and when there were none but
females there, my house was entered by a party of soldiers at one
door, headed by Serj. Lowther, and by a party of convicts at the
other, headed by one Fitzgerald, the high constable. They seized
my still, which was standing publicly in the kitchen, and carried
it away: they ransacked my writing-desk, examined all my books,
opened Mrs Mason's trunks and boxes, searched every room, and
even searched my bed; went into the shop, and from thence took
away about three pints of rectified spirits, and about half a
gallon of low spirits, which was there for the purpose of making
tinctures and other medical preparations. This took place on the
first of October, and it was the 15th of October before I could
obtain any hearing whatever; but on that day, Mr Bell, Mr Fitz,
and Mr Milcham, those three magistrates, declared that I had not
the still in my house for any improper purpose, but for use in my
profession, and that they should recommend to Lieut. Governor
Foveaux to restore me my still; notwithstanding this, to my very
great surprise, on the Sunday next I saw the advertisement in the
Sydney Gazette, of which this is a copy, published as a general
order, dated three days prior to the investigation of the
business by those three magistrates at the Green Hills. On the
22d I applied to the magistrates again, and demanded a copy of
their proceedings, which Mr Bell positively refused to give me.
This, with the scandalous libel which was published of me in the
Sydney Gazette, plainly showed the object was something more than
that of seizing my small still, while every medical man in the
colony had a still, for the most part of larger dimensions than
mine. This is a copy of a letter which I wrote to Col. Foveaux,
in consequence of so unhandsome and scurrulous a libel upon me
being published in the Sydney Gazette, to which received no
answer: on the contrary, the advertisement was continued three
weeks afterwards. As I have no reserve, I will inform the Court
that there were fifteen gallons of wash found in my house at the
same time, which I expressly avowed before the magistrates was
there for the purpose of distilling for the use of my profession;
but as to any improper use of it, I also proved before them, that
I had actually about this time paid three guineas out of my own
pocket to buy wine and spirits for poor invalid people who could
not procure it. It would have been very easy to prove the sale of
spirits if the fact had been so; and what is remarkable, the
convict who was convicted, on the same day that I was heard
before the magistrates, of working a forty-gallon still, there
was no libel of him put into the Gazette.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: That is certainly an important
circumstance, and shows that this man's character is not quite so
black as it is wished to make it appear.</p>
<p class="qa">[JOHNSTON]:</p>
<p class="qa">Q Had you given any notice to Government of your
having or working that still?</p>
<p class="qa">A I had acquainted Mr Arndell, who was the resident
magistrate; and I had also informed the Chief Constable that I
had such a still; they both knew it as well as I did myself, it
was not a matter of secret; and as this matter has been brought
before the Court with a view to impeach my veracity or
reputation, if the Court will indulge me, I can make a further
observation on this subject; but then it is only what the person
implicated told me himself; an that is, that the very man,
Patrick Portland, who was convicted of working a forty-gallon
still, settled his business by going down to Sydney, and paying
into the hands of Mr Blaxcell, Mr Macarthur's agent, 100<i>l</i>.
which he owed him for sugar that he had been distilling, and he
shewed me the receipt.</p>
<br>
<p><a name="ch-57" id="ch-57"></a><b>Mr [Nicholas] Divine</b>, a
[principal] superintendent of convicts, and director of public
works, was next sworn; he stated how the houses before spoke of
was pulled down, and admitted that he had signed two papers,
which he thought was either to put the Gov. Bligh under arrest,
or to continue him in that state, but excused himself by saying
he did it for self-preservation!</p>
<br>
<p><a name="ch-58" id="ch-58"></a><b>Charles Walker</b>, [Master
Mariner] who had commanded a brig belonging to Mr Macarthur,
deposed, that he had heard some murmur from Mr Macarthur and his
party. This question was then asked,</p>
<p class="qa">PROSECUTOR[?]: What was that discontent which you
heard?</p>
<p class="qa">WALKER: I recollect (he said) Mr Macarthur making
application to Gov. Bligh for something out of the stores: Gov.
Bligh thought it necessary, I suppose, to refuse it. Mr Macarthur
said, 'that Gov. Bligh was giving the Government property to the
settlers, a set of rascals who would deceive him; it would be
better if he gave it to me and some of the other respectable
gentlemen of the colony; if he does not, he will perhaps get
another voyage in his launch again.' This was previous to my
sailing: but after I returned, he said, 'that the colony had
suffered Governor Bligh to reign long enough, there would soon be
an alteration.' But I always heard the settlers say that Gov.
Bligh was the only Governor that ever studied the interest of the
colony, as he was the only Governor who ever allowed the
colonists any spirits, the officers having always that privilege
to themselves; the other Governors only allowed the officers to
have spirits.</p>
<p>This witness contradicted himself in speaking of an
illumination, which took place on Gov. Bligh's arrest. He next
stated his refusal to sign a paper addressed to Col. Johnston, on
the subject of the arrest of the Governor, though threatenings
were used.</p>
<p>It was asked,</p>
<p class="qa">Q You were told it would be the worse for you, you
have said, if you did not sign; was it the worse for you?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir; Gov. Bligh had given me permission to
leave the colony, in an American ship, for China; but a few days
after, I received on order from Col. Johnston, by Mr Bayly, his
secretary, not to dare go into the ship; and the ship was ordered
to get under weigh at six hours notice, and leave the harbour;
and they sent an officer on board the ship to smoke her, for fear
I should be stowed away, but the captain would not allow
them.</p>

<h3>Lieut. Col. Johnston's Defence.</h3>
<p>     <i>Mr President and Gentlemen</i>,<br>
<br>
It is now my duty to address to you my defence against the charge
which had been promoted by Capt. Bligh; a task, in the
performance of which I must appeal, and I am sure I shall not
appeal in vain, to your patience, your candour, and your
humanity. I assure you I am not using a mere phrase of course:
when I say that I feel most strongly the difficulty and
embarrassment of my situation, I make that declaration most
sincerely and unaffectedly; every circumstance attending the
charge and trial contributes to this effect. The distance of time
and remoteness of the country at which the transaction in
question took place; the death and absence of many persons whose
evidence would have been of the highest importance to me; the
seriousness of the charge, the extent to which it may effect my
fortune, my liberty, and my life; all have their share in
producing my uneasiness and embarrassment. To me, although it is
not so to Capt. Bligh, the situation of prosecutor or defendant
in a Court Martial is new and painful: but above all, I feel this
great and insuperable difficulty&mdash;I feel that, although I
must admit as an undisputed fact that I did remove Capt. Bligh
from the Government of New South Wales, and put him under an
arrest; although I am aware that such a proceeding may subject me
to the highest censure and punishment; and although the witnesses
who have been called have laboured so strenuously to refer my
conduct to the very worst of motives,&mdash;yet I feel so
thoroughly conscious of the rectitude of my intentions; so firmly
and solemnly convinced that neither malice, faction, ambition, or
avarice guided my conduct; so perfectly sure that an anxious zeal
for his Majesty's service, and the desire to prevent a massacre
and the plunder and ruin of an infant colony, alone determined my
mode of proceeding;&mdash;that I cannot, so far as a guilty
intention is necessary to constitute guilt, charge myself with
any crime. I know, and I knew in January, 1808, that the step I
was taking was one of the greatest boldness and <i>precision</i>,
to be justified only by the most cogent and imperious necessity:
I may have erred, though I do not think I did, in my opinion of
that necessity; but I am perfectly sure, that to no part of my
conduct, so far as my views and intentions decide its character,
the charge of mutiny can justly be affixed.</p>
<p>I have mentioned the late period at which this charge is
brought, as one of the hardships of my situation; and on this
head I feel myself bound in duty to submit to the Court a few
observations on the law which regulates these proceedings against
me. In doing this, I beg leave to state most implicitly my entire
submission to the judgment of the Court, and my resignation to
any decision they may definitively pronounce on this or any other
part of my case; but on the first day of this trial, when the
matter to which I am about to advert was mentioned, I understood
the mind of the court to be, that the point in question was to be
further explained in evidence; and when I should make my defence,
that would be the first time to offer any observations I might
deem adviseable. Under this impression I humbly solicit the
attention of the Court to this part of my case, premising, that I
acknowledge the matter of it to be entirely in their decision,
and I have no doubt that decision will be founded alike on sound
law, on justice, and on mercy. It has already been observed by
the Court, that I am here on my trial for a fact which took place
three years and four months ago: by the Mutiny Act it is
declared, that "No person shall be liable to be tried and
punished for any offence against any of the said acts or articles
of war, which shall appear to have been committed more than three
years before the issuing of the commission or warrant for such
trial, unless the person accused, by reason of his having
absented himself, or of some other manifest impediment, shall not
have been amenable to justice within that period; in which case,
such person shall be liable to be tried at any time not exceeding
two years after the impediment shall have ceased.' On applying
the evidence to this part of the law, I humbly apprehend, that
the point for the Court to consider will be, whether all
impediment was so far removed before the expiration of three
years, that a charge could have been preferred against me within
that time; for I think it will not be understood as the miming of
the law, that the Court Martial must come to a decision, or even
be proceeded on, within that time, but that it must be determined
by the Prosecuter within that time that proceedings shall be had;
and that a charge must be framed to which the party accused must
know that he will be called upon to answer. The absence of the
party accused is, in this case, out of the question; for I have
been in England more than eighteen months: I came hither for the
express purpose of meeting a charge which I had been given to
understand Capt. Bligh would prefer against me. More than two
years ago Capt. Bligh had the offer of free leave to take with
him whatever witnesses he might think proper; and he had, under a
solemn pledge given by him as an officer and a gentleman,
undertaken to proceed forthwith to England. I lost no time in
coming here, and was surprised that he was not also on the spot
nearly two years ago. But Capt. Bligh, it seems, had found some
reason which never occurred to me, enabling him to dispense with
his solemn pledge, and therefore remained in the colony, or in
the adjacent seas, more than a twelvemonth after he had given it.
I shall not enter into an examination whether Capt. Bligh's
conduct in this particular was justifiable or not; but I must
submit that, from the moment he was put on board the Porpoise, in
February 1809, all impediments with respect to him had ceased. He
was avowedly in pursuit of prosecution against me; he has his
choice of witnesses, by whom any charge might be supported; he
was, according to his own evidence, victualled for a voyage to
England:&mdash;it was then his bounden duty, as far as regards
this proceeding, to have come immediately to England and
preferred his charge, even if he had afterward found it necessary
to delay the trial that he might have time to collect his
witnesses. But if I read the clause in the statue rightly, it
does not afford further time than three years for the
commencement of a prosecution, if the manifest impediment shall
have been removed, and the party accused shall have been amenable
to justice within that period. Now I have certainly been amenable
to justice by being in England for so long a time; and for the
last three months of the time, namely, from October 1810 till the
26th of January, 1811, Capt. Bligh, who was also in England with
all his other witnesses, might have framed and delivered his
charge against me. He wrote home to Government his statement of
the transactions in question three years ago, at the same time
that I sent my dispatch to the Secretary of State. At that time,
had he thought fit to require it, a charge might have been framed
against me, and I might have been ordered home to answer it. Two
years and three months ago Capt. Bligh might, without an
impediment, have returned to England; but he chose to linger a
year in Van Dieman's Land, or somewhere thereabout. When I had
long left Sydney, he returned to collect evidence, and arrived
with his witnesses in October 1810. In the three months which
followed, he could have presented his charge; and I think that by
the statue he was bound to do so, unless he can show that some
manifest impediment existed up to and in January last, which has
since been removed. I had, in fact, concluded, that no
prosecution against me was intended; and the more so, as I was in
November last, after the arrival of Capt. Bligh, ordered by the
Commander in Chief to take the command of the 102d regiment, and
remained in that command until I was put under arrest in order to
answer this charge. I, need not point out to the discernment of
this honourable Court the dreadful evils to which officers would
be subjected by these delays in proceeding, if they were so
sanctioned as to be drawn into a precedent. In my own case, many
of the inevitable evils have been experienced: persons, whose
testimony would have been of the highest importance to me this
day, are dead; some, who have been in England within the time,
and who would have staid, had I known that any proceeding against
me was intended, are returned to New South Wales; and their
testimony could not be obtained without a greater delay than I
can solicit; a delay, indeed, which would be ruinous to me in
every sense of the word.</p>

<br>
<p>I have dwelt so long, I trust not improperly, on this point,
through the earnest desire which every man under an accusation so
grave and important must feel to secure to himself all the
benefits which the law affecting his state in society will allow.
I have not been influenced in the slightest degree by a wish to
avoid a trial before a Court of honour, a Court constituted and
composed as this is. The habits and predilections of my life,
from its earliest period, have been altogether military. At the
early age of twelve years I received a commission, and commenced
my services in America. Subsequently, I have served in India, and
on the Coast of Africa, under military and under naval
commanders. In 1786 I volunteered to New South Wales, and was the
first officer who landed there; and I have served there ever
since that time, with only two short intervals of absence, when I
returned to England. In all that long period&mdash;in all the
situations which I have served&mdash;under all the Governors to
whose care the colony of New. South Wales has been intrusted, not
a complaint against me, in my military character, has ever been
preferred; nor have I ever thought it necessary to bring any
officer or private to a court martial for any offence personally
affecting myself.</p>
<p>Capt. Bligh too is an officer of long standing, and has served
his Majesty in various parts of the world; but such have been the
misfortunes attending his service, that a series of prosecutions
by and against him, and all referring to his personal conduct,
has always marked his career. Mutiny and insubordination are the
charges he has repeatedly preferred; tyranny and oppression are
the offences for which he has been tried, and for which, on full
proof, he has been reprimanded and censured.</p>
<p>It is with great reluctance that I make this reflection; for
it is painful for me to speak in terms of censure of any officer
bearing his majesty's commission, and still more so to speak of
myself in terms which may be considered somewhat vain-glorious;
but I am obliged to do it, for the purpose of presenting to the
Court a correct view of my relative situation. I never was the
subject or promoter of an accusation of this kind, until,
unfortunately, I was placed under the government of Capt. Bligh,
under whose command so many have been obliged to appear as
culprits or as prosecutors. In all the vicissitudes of government
in the colony in question; in all the alternate scenes of plenty
and distress, of discipline and insubordination; in the days of
quiet and ease, and in those of rebellion and danger,&mdash;I
have always been active in my duty, and unreproached in the
discharge of it; and so probably should have continued to the end
of my days, had not compassion for the colonists, goaded into
phrensy by the injustice, tyranny, and oppression of Capt. Bligh,
and a desire to prevent those excesses to which such a
disposition of mind in such persons must have given birth,
obliged me to adopt the measures which have laid the foundation
for the present prosecution. In adopting these measures I
considered myself, and know I was considered by the great
majority of the people in New South Wales, as the saviour of the
colony.</p>
<p>I am aware that this declaration will excite some surprise
when it is contrasted with the testimony of Capt. Bligh and his
witnesses with respect to his great popularity, and the surprise,
astonishment, and indignation, with which the event of the 26th
of January was received by all the classes of the people. My
defence rests on the denial and contradiction, by argument and by
evidence, of these assertions of Capt. Bligh and his witnesses;
in the proof that in his short administration of sixteen months,
the violation of public justice and private property, a tyranny
which exhibited an extravagant mixture of system and caprice, and
perpetual violence, displaying itself both in real injury and
gross verbal abuse, and crowned at last by an avowed intention to
imprison and prosecute for high treason, or treasonable
practices, several persons who had merely uttered words
unpleasing to him; wrought up the public mind to such a pitch of
frantic indignation, that every calamity must have ensued, had I
not been induced to interfere in the way I did.</p>
<p>The summary of Capt. Bligh's statement, as disclosed, by
himself and his witnesses, is this:&mdash;That on his arrival to
take the Government, he found the colony in much distress, owing
partly to the visitations of Providence, and partly to political
causes. That he commenced and pursued a system of impartial
justice, combined with vigilance, encouragement, humanity,
economy, and reform, which re-established prosperity, and
rendered him universally popular. That some of his reforms
(particularly that which related to the prevention of the barter
of spirits) gave umbrage to a few individuals, among whom were
the officers of the New South Wales Corps and Mr Macarthur. To
these causes of discontent Mr Gore, the Provost Marshal, has
added two others, which seem to be, even if founded on truth,
extremely fanciful and inadequate; namely, a regulation with
respect to the issue of cash notes, and an act of such mere
ordinary justice and humanity as the abolition of imprisonment
without a legal warrant, and the prevention of torture for the
purpose of obtaining confession. That the discontent of a few
individuals arising from such causes should be sufficiently
operative to occasion the overthrow of a popular Government, must
on the face of it appear extremely doubtful; and I think the
Court, on a fair review of all the circumstances, would not be
disposed to believe that would begin, excite, or join in, a
mutiny originating among such persons, and proceeding from such
causes. If the habits of my whole life presented no reason for
believing the contrary, the total absence of any motive arising
out of these circumstances and affecting me would be sufficient
to prove that I could not participate in the sentiments of such
parties. Of all the witnesses who have named persons who
trafficked in spirits, sot one has mentioned me: in fact, it
never was particularly interesting to me. While it was permitted,
I used it as all other persons did, the Governors and Lieutenant
Governors not excepted. When it was prohibited, I acquiesced in
the prohibition without a struggle and without a complaint. I
knew, and acknowledge, that it was in the Governor's province to
annul this traffic. Governor Macquarie has re-established it; but
that cause alone would not make the one Governor hated or the
other beloved. As to notes payable in one mode or another, I
never issued, nor had occasion to traffic in them: the notes of
the military were always held equivalent to coined money, because
the recovery of them did not depend on the solvency of
individuals, they being payable at the public Treasury. With
respect to the imprisonment and torture mentioned by Mr Gore, I
am totally ignorant that such a fact ever existed; but if it did,
I am sure every measure tending to reform it would have met ray
most cordial and firm support; and I firmly believe that if Capt.
Bligh had had the merit of such an act to plead, not all the
efforts of the most malignant faction which the colony could
produce, aided by all the other instances of his
mal-administration, could have so obliterated the sentiments of
gratitude and affection from the bosoms of the people; but that
they would have torn in pieces any man who should have proposed
to injure so great a public benefactor.</p>
<p>To prove his popularity, Capt. Bligh has given his own
evidence, and supported by that of many other persons who had
greater or less means of knowledge. In aid of this testimony,
Capt. Bligh has produced an address signed by eight hundred and
thirty-three inhabitants of the Hawkesbury district in January,
1808. In answer to this evidence, so far as it goes, I shall show
not only Captain Bligh's real unpopularity, and the real causes
of it, but I shall prove that some time before the let of
January, 1808, Mr Williamson, one of his most intimate friends,
and Mr Palmer, now one of his principal witnesses, were
distinctly and repeatedly apprised of the profound impression
made on the public mind by the Governor's misconduct, and the
great probability that, by pursuing such a course, he would
occasion some tremendous explosion of popular indignation. I will
also prove that a similar communication was made to the Governor
himself; and that, far from even promising to redress or enquire
into the grievances complained of, he burst out into the most
lofty expressions of indignation and contempt, declaring the
information to be unfounded, and that it would be easier to move
mountains than to make him alter his conduct.</p>
<p>These communications not only throw suspicion on the evidence
which has been given of Gov. Bligh's belief in his own
popularity, but they account for the zeal and industry with which
the address from the Hawkesbury district was urged, and the
critical time at which it was procured. Commercial and other
causes gave Mr Campbell and Palmer an unlimited influence in that
part of the colony, and their emissaries exerted great activity
on this occasion; buts in fact, great exertion was hardly
necessary, for I shall call witnesses well acquainted with this
part of the colony, who will declare that for the most
insignificant reward, so small a matter as a glass of spirits per
man, an address of any import might be procured, and almost all
the signatures which the place affords would be affixed to
it.</p>
<p>Soon after the 26th of January, I, too, had an address from
the same quarter;&mdash;it is in these terms: "Impressed with the
highest sense of the obligations due to yon for having come
forward at the present momentous crisis, to extricate the loyal
inhabitants of the colony from that dread and horror which the
recent arbitrary measures had caused,&mdash;measures which, if
pursued as they hitherto have been, must ultimately have proved
destructive to this infant colony, as well as injurious to the
finances of the mother country, and which tended to destroy those
rights so dear to every Englishman,&mdash;we presume to address
you, and in the most unfeigned manner earnestly hope you will
accept our grateful acknowledgment, unadorned by any fulsome
language. The oppressions which we have lately undergone had
nearly blunted those feelings which as men we ought to have
cherished: but anxious for the welfare of our families, and to
avert those calamities which would, we fear, have inevitably
attended those persons who might have refused to sign the recent
address, many of us therein reluctantly praised those proceedings
which in our hearts we could but condemn. Now that we can freely
express the sentiments of our minds, we gladly beg to assure you
that we are ready to support you with our lives and properties,
conscious that every act of your administration will meet with
his Majesty's highest approbation. We cannot in language
sufficiently praise the meritorious services of the New South
Wales Corps on this memorable occasion.' It was signed by some
hundreds of people; but the names being much blotted, and the
paper defaced, the first sheet only, signed by four of Capt.
Bligh's principal addressers, was left in my hands; the other
names were taken away because the paper was so much blotted as to
render many of them illegible, and it was deemed adviseable to
get new signatures. That may have been done or may not, for I
interested myself so little about such addresses that I never
took the trouble to inquire.</p>
<p>Another address has been relied on by the prosecutor as
demonstrative of the public opinion respecting his conduct. It is
that which was signed by a certain number of inhabitants of New
South Wales after the arrival of Gov. Macquarie: but perhaps if
the whole of that transaction is rightly viewed, Capt. Bligh has
little reason to be proud of it. This attempt to procure a public
declaration was made when I and all my principal friends had left
the colony; when Gov. Macquarie, in pursuance of his
instructions, had pronounced the highest censure on the
proceedings of the 26th of January, and annulled all the public
acts which ensued. The meeting was announced by the authority of
the Provost Marshal, and with the known sanction of Government,
and the intent of it was defined in the advertisement. The
meeting was numerously attended: and yet the friends of Capt.
Bligh, (although the Provost Marshal, their warm partizan, was in
the chair) did not chuse to put their resolutions in a regular
way, but attempted to carry their address privately and by
subscription. Foiled in this attempt, and although they were a
pretended majority, these persons withdrew from the meeting, not
venturing to oppose the very moderate and proper
counter-resolutions which were moved, and which Mr Gore refused
to put from the chair, until Gov. Macquarie positively commanded
him to conduct himself with impartiality. Fortunately, death nor
absence does not intervene to prevent me from giving evidence of
what passed at this meeting, although I am deprived of the
benefit of one witness, who could have stated in what terms of
reproach Capt. Bligh greeted his friend Mr Gore when he was
informed of the result of this meeting, and of the pretexts by
which many persons not present at the meeting were influenced to
sign the address.</p>
<p>But by whatever arts these addresses may have been procured,
or however gratifying they may have been to the individual for
whom they were obtained, I trust I shall be able most
satisfactorily to shew, that, during his government of sixteen
months, Capt. Bligh had managed to render him universally odious.
This public detestation did not arise from speculative
regulations or small matters of offence, but from a frequent, I
may say constant irregular interference in the administration of
justice; not only in public matters, but in causes between
individuals. It was increased by frequent invasions of private
property, not, as Capt. Bligh and his witnesses have pretended,
merely for the public good and with beneficial compensation to
the parties affected, but for mere malice and love of oppression;
and in one instance at the least, (which he has most positively
denied on his oath,) for his own private accommodation. I shall
also show that the minds of the common people, particularly the
soldiery, were irritated by a constant repetition of abuse, daily
and hourly uttered in the lowest and coarsest terms, accompanied
by the threats of the privation and destruction of their
property, and declarations that appeals to law or justice from
the mandates of his will should be useless and unavailing. Above
all, I trust I shall be able to prove, that, when in addition to
these facts it Was publicly announced by the advice of Mr George
Crosley, whose known character in England made him at once the
terror and hatred of the colonists, such alarming measures were
resolved on as those which were announced on the 26th of January,
no power existing in the colony, no address or influence
possessed by any individual there, no efforts that could have
been made, not no means, except those which I adopted, could have
prevented the massacre of the Governor, his adherent's, and
advisers: and when once the restraint of the law was removed from
such persons as those who compose that colony, who is there but
must tremble at the contemplation of the consequences! For let me
here observe, that the soldiers are not at Sydney kept in a state
of separation from the people; but mix, marry, and live among
them, and are in all respects identified with them: they hear
their opinions, share in their feelings, discuss their
grievances, and would with infinite difficulty, if at all, in a
matter of great public concern, be brought to act against them:
Let me also observe, that the lower class in New South Wales
looked up to the few independent and respectable inhabitants, as
their only protectors against the violence with which they were
beset. Thus, when Gov. Bligh threatened to pull down their homes,
they were in the habit of requesting some person of
respectability and character to accept a friendly assignment of
their leases, flattering themselves that the superior station of
these persons would be respected, and their property thus
secured. But when it became known that of this class of society
seven individuals were at once to be imprisoned and sentenced to
death or banishment, every hope seemed at once to vanish, and
despair with all its attendant feelings deemed to take possession
of every mind.</p>
<p>I come now to the transactions which immediately led to those
of the 26th of January: but I beg the Court to call to mind,
that, in all the scenes and all the events I have already
described or alluded to, I was a mere spectator, never in any
manner mixing in what was done. I lived in a state of absolute
privacy and retirement, four miles from the seat of Government,
as one of the witnesses for the Prosecution has expressed it. I
merely went to town to attend my duty as a magistrate and
officer; and when that was performed, returned to my own
residence. With Mr Macarthur I had no connexion, nor was our
acquaintance at all intimate. I had heard of wrongs sustained by
him from the Governor, but I did not interfere in the discussions
which arose between them. I knew Mr Macarthur to be an opulent
and respectable settler, and a man of unblemished character both
in public and private; but when on his appearance before the
bench of magistrates, on the 16th of December, 1807, he used
expressions which could justly be considered as too warm, I did
(as Mr Campbell has stated) observe on the injury he did himself
by so much impetuosity; and, far from attempting to screen him
from justice if he was amenable to it, I concurred with the other
magistrates in ordering him to be tried before the Criminal
Court.</p>
<p>On the 24th of January, 1808, I was at Sydney, and dined with
the officers of the 102d. In Gov. King's time there had been a
regular mess-dinner, and it was now the wish of the officers to
re-establish so laudable and convivial an arrangement; and this
was the first meeting we had for the purpose of considering what
followed. I do not wonder that Capt. Bligh should imagine this
dinner had some connexion with the events of the ensuing days;
but I most solemnly declare, and I will bring the officers who
were present to prove, that nothing of the kind was agitated or
even hinted at, nor do I believe it was in the contemplation of
any one of us. 'No parish business!' was the good-humoured
expression of restriction by which we bound ourselves not to
advert to any of the affairs of the colony. It is not true, (as
estimated) that Mr Macarthur was there; he was not in the room a
single moment; he was not even named: but every thing at the
meeting displayed and denoted only that honest conviviality and
cordial friendship which distinguish such parties among
officers.</p>
<p>In returning home from this meeting I had the misfortune to
overturn my gig in a bad road, and received those hurts which
have been particularly alluded to by some of the witnesses, but
which were of much greater seriousness than they have given the
Court to understand. They were quite sufficient to confine me to
my bed, and make removal dangerous, as I should now be able to
prove, but for the long postponement of my trial; in which
interval, death has removed from me my valuable friend Doctor
Jamieson, whose evidence would have been highly important to me
in a great many particulars.</p>
<p>On the 25th, while I was thus confined, Mr Macarthur's trial
came on before the Criminal Court. Of the transactions of that
day I know nothing but from report: I have seen the paper which
Mr Macarthur put in, objecting to his being tried before Mr
Atkins. I take no share in that paper nor in its effects. The
Court will hear it read, and I am persuaded they will be of
opinion that the reasonings it contains were plausible and
ingenious, to a sufficient degree to induce a Court composed only
of officers, and not assisted by a single lawyer, to acquiesce in
their propriety. Against these reasonings, indeed, no sort of
argument was resorted to; but command and threat succeeded each
other; while measures of the greatest violence both to the
defendant and the officers were known to be preparing under the
direction and advice of Mr George Crosley.</p>
<p>As I have now more particular occasion to mention this person,
let me beg leave to make a few observations on his character,
situation, and conduct; and on the causes which in my humble
opinion, rendered it disgraceful, if not criminal, for a person
exercising his Majesty's Government to be led at all by his
advice, or to consult him officially on any business whatever. Mr
Crosley never was an eminent attorney, unless notoriety and
infamy can pass for eminence. For nearly thirty years before he
was sentenced to transportation be had been the opprobium of the
law, and the plague of the Courts. He was at the head of a gang
who infested the gaol doors of the metropolis, and who, having
first excited the unhappy criminals to acts of guilt, made them
subservient to all his villainous purposes, preyed on them to the
last; and then, often by treachery, delivered them over to the
arm of justice. There was no crime in which he had not been
implicated: perjury and subordination, conspiracy and forgery,
were among those for which he had been tried: but until the last
crime for which he was put to the bar, he had always been able to
extricate himself, by inducing his underlings to commit those
perjuries on his behalf which wrested the arm of justice. When at
last he was convicted, Lord Kenyon, with expressions of
undisguised satisfaction, seized the opportunity of freeing
British society from so very worthless a member. He might have
pronounced a milder sentence, and would have done so, had the
culprit been a man who had late in life made a single abberration
from the path of honour; but in punishing him, to the extent he
did, that virtuous Chief Justice felt and owned that he was
inflicting, for one crime, a sentence far too mild to be imposed
an one whose life had been a series of profligacy, offensive
alike to morality, religion, and the law. Far from being eminent
in his profession, this man's knowledge was limited to the arts
of fraud and chicane: no man in the profession, who had the least
regard for his reputation could hold friendly intercourse with
him; and many attorneys, conscious of the infamy of his
character, would not even engage in causes against him. In New
South Wales, more than in any other placer except London, this
man's infamy was known. Many of the unfortunate convicts owed
their original corruption and final expulsion from their native
society entirely to him. The settlement rang with his infamy.
Gov. King did nor pardon him for his good behaviour; but finding
him addicted to all the arts of law fraud and chicane, and
exercising them to the injury of the unwary, he made him a
settler, that he might be subject to the law for debts
contracted, which, as a convict, he was not No man of ordinary
credit in the colony, unless it were Mr Palmer, ever resorted to
hint for legal advice; and his being consulted both publicly and
confidentially by the Governor created universal alarm and
astonishment. I am far from asserting that the Governor had not a
perfect right to consult whomsoever he might think proper; but I
am sure it would have been more satisfactory, more wise and more
honourable, to have followed the genuine dictates of an honest
understanding, than to have contaminated the fountain of
authority with the impurities of so base an adviser. Other
Governors, before Capt. Bligh, carried on the government without
such an assistant. They may have made their mistakes, and had
their faults; but they did not expose the colony to the danger of
insurrection, nor stigmatize their own administration.</p>
<p>To return to my narrative:&mdash;On the 25th I received the
first letter from Gov. Bligh; to which, being unable to write
myself, and having no person near me to perform that office, I
returned a verbal answer by the Orderly, as mentioned Capt.
Bligh's evidence. On the 26th. I received a letter from the
Governor, announcing his resolution to arrest six officers of the
102d, for treasonable practices, and requiring me, as I was
unable to attend myself, to appoint Major Abbott to the command
of the regiment. Had these measures been adopted, there would
have been but two officers to do the duty of the regiment, and
the highest and most important duties must have been left to the
Serjeants. I was ill; Maj. Abbott was at Paramatta, sixteen miles
off; and it could not be expected, but that the arrest of six
officers, and the dread of what measures would ensue, would
occasion considerable uneasiness.</p>
<p>My medical friend had directed me on no account to leave my
room: but sensible of the danger of this crisis, and anxious to
avert impending evil, I neglected that advice, got myself
dressed, and was driven to town by the aid of my family. On my
arrival, as I passed through the streets, every thing denoted
terror and consternation: I saw in every direction groups of
people with soldiers amongst them; apparently in deep and earnest
conversation. I repaired immediately to the barrack; and, in
order to separate the military from the people, made the drum
heat to orders. The soldiers immediately repaired to the
barrack-yard, where they were drawn up, and where they
remained.</p>
<p>In the mean time an immense number of the people, comprising
all the respectable inhabitants, except those who were
immediately connected with Capt. Bligh, rushed into the barrack
and surrounded me, repeating with importunate clamour a
solicitation that I would immediately place the Governor under
arrest. They solemnly assured me, if I did not, an insurrection
and massacre would certainly take place; and added, that the
blood of the colonists would be upon my head. [Here the prisoner
mentioned the requisition which had been presented to him, after
which he proceeded.]</p>
<p>We marched to the Government House, attended by a vast
concourse of people, who were all inflamed with indignation
against the Governor. On our arrival I learnt that the officers I
had sent had not been able to obtain an interview, but that the
Governor had concealed himself. This intelligence was truly
alarming, for I had every thing to fear from the agitation it was
likely to produce. I immediately drew up the soldiers in a line
before the Government House, and between it and the people, who
were thus made to keep a respectful distance: the troops were
halted, and made to stand at ease. I then directed a small number
to proceed in search of the Governor, while I waited below to
protect the family from injury or insult. The search occupied,
according to Gov. Bligh's account, two hours. At length he was
found, and brought to the room where I was. When he was
introduced, I gently informed him of the step which, by the
requisition of the people, I had been obliged to take. He
answered, He was very sorry he had incurred public displeasure;
had he been aware that such would be the effect of his conduct,
he would have acted otherwise; and he resigned all authority into
my hands, publicly thanking me for the handsome manner in which I
had carried the wishes of the people into execution. I then gave
the orders I deemed necessary for the security and the protection
of his person, and the safety and ease of his family, and
withdrew. During all this time the troops, far from being
infuriate or uncontrollable, maintained the most steady order and
the most perfect silence; not a man stirred from his rank, except
those who were ordered, nor was a word spoken along the whole
line.</p>
<p>I know that a great part of this statement differs very
materially from that of Capt. Bligh and his witnesses; but I
trust I shall be able to support if in every particular by full
and satisfactory evidence. Capt. Bligh admits that I behaved to
him with perfect gentleness and propriety; but he talks of the
invasion of the Government House as a scene of utter riot and
confusion; his seizure he calls a Robespierrean scene: he speaks
of shouting by the soldiery; and has been led, to believe that
the position of the guns at the parade was altered so as to
menace the Government House. For all this fabrication and
exaggeration I am utterly at a loss to account. I am not willing
to assert that Capt. Bligh has wilfully feigned all these
circumstances; but if I exclude that supposition, I must believe
that the terror he underwent during his two hours concealment
must have perverted his powers of perception. I cannot of my own
knowledge speak of the situation in which he was found, nor will
I repeat what has been told me by others; their account will be
given on oath; they will state the condition in which they found
his Majesty's full uniform on the back of Capt. Bligh,&mdash;a
condition which would make the real heroes of the British navy
blush with shame and boil with indignation.</p>
<p>Such are the events which took place on the 26th of January,
1808, and for which I am now called upon to answer. I have
accounted for the causes of my conduct according to the exact
truth; and upon the opinion the Court shall form of those causes,
and not of the mere act, separated entirely from them, I trust
their opinion on this case will depend.</p>
<p>It may be said, that I might have put myself at the head of
the military, and with their aid dispersed the people, and thus
supported the Governor. I know I could have done so, and that for
the moment it would have been attended with effect; but of this I
am perfectly sure, that, identified as the military were with the
people, and inflamed by the feelings of wrongs and insults
affecting them all, they would before the night was past have
joined with them, or at least refused to act against them; while
vengeance would have been urged to its greatest degree of
acrimony, and produced on one side or the other the most
deplorable excesses. If the people, joined by the military, had
broken out, terror and devastation would have marked their
course, and his Majesty's fine flourishing infant colony would
have been reduced to a state of distress and dissolution.</p>
<br>
<p>After explaining some subsequent transactions, the prisoner
concluded by thanking the Court for their patience in attending
to his address 'I need not,' he added, 'implore them to give to
my evidence the same patient attention, for that I am sure they
will not fail to do. The only request I have to make is, that
they will not, in considering my case, forget the peculiar
position in which I was placed;&mdash;far from advice,
assistance, or control; amidst a population used to illegal acts,
and of unrestrained habits; a population driven to phrensy by
oppression, against which there was no appeal; and on the point
of taking it into their own hands vengeance of which it was
impossible to foresee, and equally impossible not to dread, the
consequence. I pray them to consider the difficulty of electing a
proper course under such circumstances: and if they feel the
least doubt in determining on my motives, I hope and trust that
my long and unblemished service of thirty-five years, and my
anxious care during a great portion of the time for this very
colony, will not be without their weight in the scale of
consideration.'</p>

<h3>Witnesses for the Defence.</h3>
<br>
<p><a name="ch-60" id="ch-60"></a><b>Mr Richard Atkins</b>, Judge
Advocate of the Colony [dismissed after the mutiny, but later
re-appointed], was first sworn by Lieut.-Col. Johnston.</p>
<p class="qa">JOHNSTON: Did your situation in the colony of New
South Wales give you great opportunities of knowing Governor
Bligh's conduct and its motives?</p>
<p class="qa">ATKINS: No doubt, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Has the Governor at different times endeavoured
to influence your opinion in causes before you, previously to the
Court's giving their decision?</p>
<p class="qa">A No sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Have you frequently been obliged, from your dread
of the Governor, to submit to or sanction measures repulsive to
your feelings and judgment?</p>
<p class="qa">A I have, sir, sometimes thought it better, from
certain reasons, to sanction measures that were contrary to my
feelings and judgment.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did those measures relate to trials between the
Crown and the subject, and to others, between party and
party?</p>
<p class="qa">A I am rather inclined to think, sir, it was with
respect to colonial regulations.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did you ever remonstrate with Gov. Bligh on any
particular occasion?</p>
<p class="qa">A I did.</p>
<p class="qa">Q State upon what.</p>
<p class="qa">A There was a Mr D'Arcy Wentworth, assistant
surgeon, who was tried by a general Court Martial on a charge
exhibited against him. He was sentenced to be reprimanded by the
Governor: he was not reprimanded by the Governor; but he was
reprimanded by the commanding officer of the regiment, who was at
that time Lieut. Col. Johnston, the prisoner. Some time
afterward, when I saw Gov. Bligh, he said that it was his
intention to suspend Mr D'Arcy Wentworth from the functions of
his office, from being assistant surgeon. I stated to him that I
conceived it was improper, because he had already undergone the
sentence of the Court, and that I did conceive it was contrary to
law, that a man should be punished a second time. The answer that
he made me was this: "The law, sir! damn the law: my will is the
law, and woe unto the man that dares to disobey it!" Mr Wentworth
was suspended.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was Mr Gore, the Provost Marshal, admitted much
about the presence and into the counsels of Gov. Bligh?</p>
<p class="qa">A Admitted much about his presence; no doubt of it,
sir; he was constantly there, and, as myself, having a great deal
of business to do with the Governor: with respect to his counsel,
any thing that might pass in private it is impossible for me to
speak to.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was Mr Gore tried for swindling and felony?</p>
<p class="qa">A He was tried, sir, once for felony and once on a
charge of fraud.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did not the Court that tried Mr Gore object to
Wellesley's pleading before them; and was there a written, order
reduced from the Governor to compel his being admitted to
plead?</p>
<p class="qa">A The Court did object to his pleading; but I never
saw any written order from the Governor to admit him to
plead.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Was Crosley for or against Mr Gore?</p>
<p class="qa">A For him, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Who prepared the indictment against Mr
Gore, and what was the event of his trial?</p>
<p class="qa">A The first trial, sir, was for felony, and I
prepared the indictment.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: What was the result of it?</p>
<p class="qa">A The result of it was, sir, that he was
acquitted.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Who prepared the indictment for the
second?</p>
<p class="qa">A The second was by information, and George Crosley
prepared it.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: What was the second for?</p>
<p class="qa">A It was for a fraud.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: What was the result of that?</p>
<p class="qa">A The charge, sir, was for a fraud, in wrongfully
obtaining the sum of 15s. upon a note that was drawn by one James
Underwood; but it was made payable neither to order nor to
bearer; and the Court were of opinion, that as the note was not
negociable, the obtaining payment of it in the manner that was
charged against Mr Gore could not be considered in law as a
fraud.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Then he was acquitted?</p>
<p class="qa">A Upon that ground he was acquitted, the Court did
not proceed. The fact was, he had once received the value, 15s.
and wanted to receive it a second time.</p>
<p class="qa">[JOHNSTON]:</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did Gov. Bligh ever shew a disposition to screen
Mr Gore from justice, by interfering in any business pending
before the magistrates?</p>
<p class="qa">A I will mention a circumstance, and the Court will
consider whether it was an interference or not. Mr Gore was
charged with a crime; and a Bench of Magistrates sat to inquire
into it. They had made progress, sir, in their examination, and
the further proceedings were deferred until the next day: before
we met on the next day, I received a letter from the Governor's
secretary, Mr Griffin, the Governor being then up the country at
Hawkesbury, about forty miles distance, stating that it was his
direction.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Whose direction; Mr Griffin's, or the
Governor's?</p>
<p class="qa">A Saying particularly, it was his Excellency the
Governor's direction, that the Bench of Magistrates do not meet
till his return to Sydney, to the capital.</p>
<p class="qa">Q State to the Court the treatment that Mr Newsham,
one of the principal witnesses against Mr Gore, experienced by
the order or privity of the Governor for some days previous to
the trial?</p>
<p class="qa">A I always understood, sir, that Mr Newsham was
exceedingly ill treated, and cruelly ill treated; but as it did
not come through me as Judge Advocate, I cannot speak to it.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Do you know whether this Mr Newsham was
ill treated by Gov. Bligh's order or not?</p>
<p class="qa">A I know nothing of it: hearsay, I presume, is not
evidence; it did not come within my knowledge.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: What was the crime that Gore was charged
with then?</p>
<p class="qa">A He was charged with that very crime for which he
was tried.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: You mean the business of the fraud?</p>
<p class="qa">A No, sir; it, was for the felony, for entering
into a house and taking out some property belonging to a Mr
McKoy.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: He was the police officer?</p>
<p class="qa">A No, sir; he had been gaoler; and I am not certain
whether he was gaoler at that time or not.</p>
<p class="qa">[JOHNSTON]:</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was there any legal accusation preferred against
Mr Newsham?</p>
<p class="qa">A At that time none, sir, to my knowledge.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was it at your request, or against your
inclination, that Mr Crosley was consulted and employed by Gov.
Bligh?</p>
<p class="qa">A It was with my own approbation. I was not bred to
the law; mine has been a military life; and not understanding
forms of law, it was at my request, and I did apply to Gov. Bligh
to allow me to consult him upon that particular occasion, being
ignorant at that time of the forms of law.</p>
<p class="qa">Q State to the Court the character and situation of
Martin Mason in the colony of New South Wales.</p>
<p class="qa">A Martin Mason, sir, came out to New South Wales as
surgeon of a merchant ship, I believe of a convict ship. After a
considerable time, Gov. King, in consideration, as I believe, of
his large family, having five children, appointed him
Superintendant at a place called Toongabbee, where the worst
characters were sent.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Does Superintendant import Superintendant
of convicts, or Superintendant of works?</p>
<p class="qa">A Superintendant of convicts and of labour, sir: he
was at the same time sworn in as a magistrate. After some time,
various complaints came to me of oppression and otherwise ill
conduct on his part towards the convicts; but as I knew the
desperate set he had to deal with, I took little or no notice of
them. At last, sir, a charge of a very serious nature was stated
to the Governor, (Gov. King) which was, that Mr Mason having
looked with an eye of cupidity (if I may be allowed the
expression) on one of the convict women, but who refused to
gratify him, he had tied her to a post, where she remained the
whole night. This was inquired into by a Bench of Magistrates, of
which I was one, when the fact was clearly proved; and in
consequence he never was permitted to act as a magistrate
afterwards, and the magistrates actually refused to act with him:
among others, Mr Marsden refused, I refused; he was not
permitted, to my knowledge, to act as a magistrate either at
Toongabbee or at the Hawkesbury.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Was he dismissed?</p>
<p class="qa">A I don't know that he was dismissed, but I never
knew him after that as a magistrate; myself and the other
magistrates refused to act with him; but whether he was formally
dismissed by the Governor, I cannot say.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Did he still continue Superintendant of
the convicts?</p>
<p class="qa">A I believe he did, but I am not certain of that.
After some time, sir, Gov. King sent him to superintend the
convicts at a place they call Hunter's River, or most commonly
the Coal River, where the worst of the convicts are sent.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Even worse than those you first
mentioned?</p>
<p class="qa">A Even worse than those, sir; we have all
descriptions of them. He had not been there any great length of
time before complaints upon, complaints came to Sydney against
him for cruelty and oppression, such as was really shocking to
think of. He was sent for to Sydney, and the Commanding Officer
at Hunter's River was desired to send such evidence as he might
think necessary to prove the fact, which he did. The matter came
before a Bench of Magistrates a second time, when it was clearly
proved that he had been guilty of those oppressions and tyranny.
There were two men brought, sir, who were so ill that we were
obliged to take their evidence lying on the ground; and they
swore positively they were in that state owing to the ill
treatment which they had received from Mr Mason, and which was
corroborated by other evidence.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: What sort of ill treatment was it that
this was owing to?</p>
<p class="qa">A To over-labour, sir; and punishments of different
kinds.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: Was he dismissed?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: By Gov. King?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">THE COURT: You say, positively, he was dismissed;
that he did not resign?</p>
<p class="qa">A He was dismissed, sir; and afterwards went to the
Hawkesbury and acted as a surgeon there: he had some land given
him in consideration of his family, which he did not cultivate,
but lived upon his professional means as a surgeon among the
settlers.</p>
<p class="qa">[JOHNSTON]:</p>
<p class="qa">Q State to the Court your opinion of the Hawkesbury
settlers; and what importance ought to be attached to an address
from them to any Governor.</p>
<p class="qa">A I believe, sir, that, except a very few, a glass
of gin would bias them.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What number do you mean by a very few?</p>
<p class="qa">A I mean, perhaps, six, or seven, or ten, I cannot
exactly say what number.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What may be the number of the population
altogether?</p>
<p class="qa">A I cannot say with precision; I suppose there
might be 2000 people there; it is a settlement of about 60 or 70
miles in extent, and the whole population, (I don't mean settlers
only) might be about 2000.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Were not a great majority of the Hawkesbury
settlers, in consequence of their debts to Mr Palmer, Mr
Campbell, and Andrew Thomson, much under their influence?</p>
<p class="qa">A There is no doubt of it, sir; they owed large
sums of money to all three; but how far that influenced them it
is not for me to judge.</p>

[formerly of the New South Wales Corps, but for long a free
settler; after the mutiny appointed a magistrate and Colonial
Secretary] sworn. <i>Examined by Lieut.-Col. Johnston.</i></p>
<p class="qa">JOHNSTON: How long have you been established in New
South Wales?</p>
<p class="qa">MACARTHUR: I went to the colony in the year 1789,
as an officer in the New South Wales Corps; twenty-one years
since.</p>
<p class="qa">Q When did you first commence your agricultural
pursuits in that colony?</p>
<p class="qa">A About the year 1793. The colony had, previously
to that period, been in the extremest distress for provisions;
the rations issued by the Government were frequently so small,
that the greatest want prevailed, and absolute famine was often
apprehended. When Major Grose, (now Gen. Grose), took the command
of the colony as Lieutenant Governor, he considered it expedient
to encourage cultivation by giving grants of land to the officers
both civil and military. Among the persons so encouraged, was
myself; and I devoted myself with great assiduity to the clearing
and the cultivating of the land given to me, and to the raising
of every kind of animal fitted for food.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What quantity of live stock do you suppose you
have reared la the period you have spokes of?</p>
<p class="qa">A To the best of my knowledge and belief, I have
circulated among the settlers at least 20,000<i>l</i>. worth of
breeding animals, all raised by myself.</p>

<br>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: We cannot judge of the number of the
cattle by such a statement, because the prices might be very
high.</p>
<p class="qa">A I have sent an immense quantity to the market to
be slaughtered, and I am sure I may fairly estimate from my
present stock, that the colony will be supplied with at least
100,000lbs. weight annually. It is perhaps proper that I should
state to the Court, that the stock from which such large supplies
have been obtained, originally consisted only of about six or
seven cows, and about thirty ewes; and that from these I have
raised 1,000 or 1,200 head of horned cattle, and at least 10 or
12,000 sheep. The last returns of my stock made the number of
sheep 4,600, the horned cattle near 300, with about 50
horses.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Are those in addition to the numbers you
before stated?</p>
<p class="qa">A No; they are the present stock.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: What was the price of beef and mutton in
the colony when you commenced breeding cattle and sheep; and what
was the price when you left the colony?</p>
<p class="qa">A When I commenced, it fluctuated from 3s. to 2s.
6d. per pound: before I left it, I supplied Government with a
large quantity at 1s.: and since my departure they have been
supplied with a still larger quantity at 9d.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: At what period, and in what manner, did
the Government of England encourage your agricultural views?</p>
<p class="qa">A In the beginning of the year 1804, some of the
most eminent manufacturers of woollen cloth in England saw by
accident some specimens of the wool that I had raised in New
South Wales; its quality was so fine that it induced them to find
me out, and to make particular inquiries how and, in what manner
this wool had been raised. On my communicating to them all I knew
upon the subject, they expressed a decided opinion that the
colony of New Holland might, with proper encouragement, be
enabled in time to supply the woollen manufacture of this country
with the whole quantity of fine wool which was then, with great
difficulty, obtained from Spain; and such was the importance
which they attached to this, that they signified their
determination to communicate their opinion to Government by
memorial, which was soon afterward done. In consequence of those
memorials being sent in, I was directed to attend a Privy
Council, before whom I was particularly examined as to the state
of my flocks and their probable improvement. The Privy Council
were so satisfied of the importance of the undertaking, that they
recommended to the Secretary of State that it should be
encouraged.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: In what shape was the encouragement of
Government conferred upon you?</p>
<p class="qa">A Lord Camden, the then Secretary of State, was
pleased to order me a grant of 5,000 acres of land, in a
particular situation which I had pointed out to his lordship: at
the same time he wrote to the Governor of the colony, directing
that I was to be supplied with shepherds.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: Did Gov. Bligh promote the intentions of
Government in your favour, and forward your agricultural
views?</p>
<p class="qa">A Never, in the smallest degree.</p>
<p class="qa">A MEMBER: State to the Court the circumstances of
your first interview with Gov. Bligh on the subject of your
agricultural speculations.</p>
<p class="qa">A When Gov. King gave up the government to the
prosecutor, he, (Gov. King) retired with his family to the
Government House at Paramatta. Having understood that the
prosecutor was on a visit there, I went to the Government House;
this was about a month after he had taken the command. I found
him walking in the garden perfectly disengaged, and alone; and
thinking it a proper opportunity to speak to him on the subject
of my affairs, I inquired if he had been informed of the wishes
of Government respecting them: I particularly alluded to the
sheep, and the probable advantages that might result to the
colony and the mother-country from the production of fine wool.
The prosecutor burst out instantly into a most violent passion,
exclaiming, 'What have I to do with your sheep, sir; what have I
to do with your cattle? Are you to have such flocks of sheep and
such herds of cattle as no man ever heard of before? No, sir!' I
endeavoured to appease him, by stating that I had understood the
Government at home had particularly recommended me to his notice.
He replied, 'I have heard of your concerns, sir; you have got
5,000 acres of land in the finest situation in the country; but,
by God, you shan't keep it!' I told him that as I had received
this land at the recommendation of the Privy Council and by the
order of the Secretary of State, I presumed that my right to it
was indisputable. 'Damn the Privy Council! and damn the Secretary
of State, too!' he says; What have they to do with me? You have
made a number of false representations respecting your wool, by
which you have obtained this land. I told him, I had made no
false representations: and that luckily, as he was on the spot,
he could, by examining the flocks, ascertain the fact himself;
and there was a flock of 7 or 800 then at my house, within a mile
of him; if he pleased he could examine them that morning. We
immediately after entered the Government House, where we found
Governor and Mrs King, and sat down to breakfast. The prosecutor
then renewed the conversation about my sheep, addressing himself
to Governor King; when he used such violent and insulting
language to him, that Gov. King burst into tears. About two hours
after, the prosecutor, Gov. King, and Major Abbott of the New
South Wales Corps, came to my house, and a flock of sheep were
produced for the prosecutor to examine. Their improvements were
so apparent, and corresponded so exactly with my representations,
that the prosecutor had nothing further to say in respect to the
truth of what I had advanced. After a little general conversation
respecting their probable increase in numbers and the value of
the wool, he burst out into a second passion, and asked me what
this examination was for, as nobody ever doubted the possibility
of raising fine wool in New South Wales; 'But what have to do
with it?' I told him in the most respectful manner I could
assume, that I certainly had understood him that morning as
doubting the truth of my representations. 'No such thing!' he
replied; 'and I desire, sir, you will never attempt to attach any
such meanings to my words.' To draw off his attention from this
subject, which seemed to give him great offence, I again
mentioned that I was extremely desirous to ascertain how far his
opinions corresponded with those of the Secretary of State. 'Damn
the Secretary of State!' he answered, with the utmost violence;
'He commands at home; I command here.'</p>
<p>Mr Macarthur then proceeded to accuse Gov. Bligh of taking
from him two Government servants, and of depossessing him of some
property which he held under lease from the crown, by removing
the fence he was erecting. He also stated the origin of his
quarrel with the Governor, which was in substance as
follows:&mdash;He sent a schooner to Otaheite to procure salted
pork: after the vessel had been some days at sea, a convict was
found concealed among the fire-wood, for which she was seized,
and &pound;900 demanded as being forfeited on a bond which the
deponent conceived had no relation to the voyage she had been
employed on. He therefore abandoned the vessel, and dismissed the
crew, who complained to the Governor. His excellency therefore
issued a warrant against Mr Macarthur, which he resisted, but
next day it was executed by force. He then gave bail, and
appealed against the Judge Advocate acting on the trial, because
he was his avowed enemy. The Court supported his objections, but
the Governor committed him to prison, and summoned the six
officers that formed the Court to answer a charge of suspicion of
treason. After this the Governor was arrested.</p>
<p>On his cross-examination he admitted that he had had
differences with Gov. Phillips, Gov. Hunter, and Gov. King. That
he had fought a duel with Gov. Paterson, and was sent home a
prisoner, but released by the Commander in Chief, and that he
also fought a duel with Col. Foveaux.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><a name="ch-62" id="ch-62"></a>Nothing very particular
resulted from the examination of <b>Lieutenants [J.] Finucane</b>
[Secretary to Lieut. Col. Foveaux and afterwards to Col.
Paterson] and <b>[Anthony Fenn] Kemp</b> [Captain in the New
South Wales Corps; appointed a magistrate], but <b>Lieut.
[William] Minchin</b> [Adjutant of the New South Wales Corps;
appointed a magistrate] stated that several persons who were
acquitted by the Criminal Court, were afterwards brought before a
bench of magistrates, and punished for the same offence, the
Governor not being satisfied with the decision of the Court. He
affirmed that he had no intimacy with Mr Macarthur, and proceeded
to state the situation in which Gov. Bligh was found at the time
of his arrest.</p>
<p class="qa">[MINCHIN] He was, [said this witness], in a small
room up stairs that appeared to me to be a servant's room; there
was a small bedstead and some lumber in it. I was called toward
that room, I believe, by the Governor's secretary, Mr Griffin; I
think it was his voice. The Governor was then standing up; there
were two or three soldiers in the room; two, I recollect
perfectly. His bosom was open, his shirt frill out, and he
appeared to me to be in the act of putting it into his waistcoat
at the time I went into the room. From his putting his hand to
put the frill of his shirt in, one of the soldiers called out to
me, "Take care, he has got a pistol." I then ordered the soldiers
away, and I said to the Governor, that I was extremely sorry he
suffered himself to be found in that manner; that he had not come
forward in the first instance to meet the officers. A corporal
who was its the room, and who is now in the 73d regiment, said,
as he was going out, "We found him there, sir," (pointing under
the bedstead.) The fore part of his coat, the lappels, were full
of dust, and the back part full of feathers: he appeared to be
very much agitated; indeed I never saw a man so much frightened
in my life, in appearance. When I went into the room he reached
his hand to me, and asked me if I would protect his life. I
assured him his life was not in danger; and that I would pledge
my own for the safety of his. I then told him that Col. Johnston
was in the room below, and that I would see him safely to him if
he would allow me: he took my arm, and we walked down stairs
together. On our getting to the stairs, his secretary came up the
other side, and said, "Will you take my arm, sir?" the Governor
replied, "No; I am perfectly safe with Mr Minchin." I shewed him
to the room where Major Johnston was waiting. The Governor came
towards him, and I must acknowledge it surprised me to see the
Governor reach his hand toward him; Col. Johnston told him he had
taken that step at the request of the whole of the inhabitants,
and that he was sorry he was obliged to do it for the
preservation of the colony. Gov. Bligh thanked him for the
handsome manner in which he had carried the wishes of the
inhabitants into effect, and said, that had he before known he
was so much disliked by the inhabitants, he would have left the
colony. Some other conversation passed, which I do not
immediately recollect, until, coming out at the door, I heard the
Governor say to Col. Johnston, He hoped he would have no
objection to his having a few friends to eat a bit of dinner with
him now and then? Col. Johnston said "Certainly not, sir;" and
immediately after that I left the house.</p>
<p>This witness underwent a long cross-examination relative to
the truth of his statement concerning the Governor interfering
improperly in the administration of justice.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><a name="ch-63" id="ch-63"></a><b>Mr John Blaxland</b> [free
settler; appointed a magistrate] deposed, that he became a
settler in New South Wales in consequence of an agreement with
the Secretary of State. He had to have 8000 acres, and the labour
of 80 convicts, and a free passage out for himself, family, and
stock; in return for which the deponent engaged to employ a
capital of not less than 6000<i>l</i>. He said that the capital
he employed exceeded 14,500<i>l</i>. but that he could only
obtain 1,290 acres, and 21 convicts, and was in other respects
ill used by Gov. Bligh, who refused to fulfil the agreement.</p>
<p>On his cross-examination, he acknowledged having signed a
subscription-paper, intended to defray the expences of John
Macarthur, Esq. who was appointed to proceed to England, in order
to lay before Government the mal-administration of Gov. Bligh. It
also appeared that he had not produced satisfactory documents,
when called on by Gov. Bligh, to prove that he had actually
employed the capital stipulated for, and that no more convicts
could be granted without prejudice to the public works. It came
also out on the examination of this witness, that Lieut.-Col.
Johnston had complained of his conduct after Gov. Bligh's arrest.
His evidence was very confused.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><a name="ch-64" id="ch-64"></a><b>Lieut. [George Carlile]
Kent</b>, Acting Commander of the <i>Porpoise</i>, said, that he
carried verbal orders from Gov. Bligh to Captain Piper, the
Commandant at Norfolk Island, that he was to send the settlers
off the island, and in case any of them refused to go, he was to
use military force, and if any of them took to the woods, he was
to outlaw them and to shoot them. He stated further, that the
settlers chose rather to go to the Derwent than to Port
Dalrymple, because the former was considered as without the
jurisdiction of Gov. Bligh.</p>
<p>This witness also stated, that Gov. Bligh gave him orders to
batter down the town of Sydney, and to compel the inhabitants to
reinstate him, and that when he came on board, he was in a
violent rage because he had not obeyed this order. He was
confined two years, brought home, and acquitted by a court
martial. The instructions sent to Capt. Piper from Gov. Bligh,
relative to the evacuation of Norfolk Island was put in, and
appeared to be drawn up in the most judicious and humane
manner.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><a name="ch-65" id="ch-65"></a><b>Mr David Dickinson Mann</b>
["Inhabitant of Sydney"] stated, that he had a house worth
400<i>l</i>. which Gov. Bligh ordered him to pull down, and to
give up the lease. When the witness mentioned the laws of
England, which entitled him to a just and quiet possession, the
Governor hastily replied, 'Damn your laws of England! don't talk
to me of your laws of England: I will make laws for this colony,
and every wretch of you, son of a bitch, shall be governed by
them; or there (pointing over to the gaol) is your habitation!'
He then bowed to him, and wished him a good morning.&mdash;This
witness also stated, that he informed Mr Palmer three months
before Gov. Bligh's arrest, that unless steps were taken to
conciliate the people, a revolution would shortly happen. On his
cross-examination, it was asked whether his house had not been
erected within the line marked out for the Government domains but
of this the witness professed his ignorance.</p>

<p><b>Serjeant-Major Thomas Whittle</b> [of the New South Wales
Corps] sworn. <i>Examined by Lieut-Col. Johnston.</i></p>
<p class="qa">JOHNSTON: Had you a leasehold in the town of
Sydney, with a house built on it?</p>
<p class="qa">WHITTLE: I had, sir.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What was the value of it?</p>
<p class="qa">A The value, sir, it stood me in, was about
510<i>l</i>.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Did Capt. Bligh ever order you to pull down that
house?</p>
<p class="qa">A Capt. Bligh, sir, came to me one morning about
seven o'clock.</p>
<p class="qa">Q When was this?</p>
<p class="qa">A About four or five months before he was put under
arrest. He came with two dragoons after him, sir. I saw him
coming towards the gate, and I went and paid him the compliment
that was due to him. He asked me how I came by it. I told him,
sir, that I had exchanged it for a house that I had lived in
before, with a man of the name of Connor, on the other side of
the water. He bawled out in a very violent manner, (and all the
neighbours heard it) that I might chop and change as pleased, but
he would have the house down by ten o'clock, and that I was
welcome to take the bricks off the ground. 'Sir,' says I, 'I have
got a lease of this house': then he paused a bit, and afterwards,
says he, 'How long has that lease to run?' Says I, 'It has about
six or seven years to run, and it is signed by Gov. Hunter.'
'Well,' says he, 'I will have the house down again by ten
o'clock, and you shall neither take bricks nor any thing else
away, but it shall be all mine, house, and ground, and all.' I
dressed myself, sir, and went to parade, and mentioned the
circumstance to my adjutant, Adj. Minchin. He advised me, sir, to
let the Commanding Officer know, to see whether he could protect
it for me; and I immediately signed it over to my commanding
officer for his protection.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Who was your commanding officer?</p>
<p class="qa">A Col. Johnston.</p>
<p class="qa">Q Was it commonly known that you had been ordered
to pull down your house?</p>
<p class="qa">A Yes, Sir; it was over in the town in less than
half an hour. I had a little business at the Hospital Wharf, and
every body had it in their mouths, that it had been ordered to be
pulled down; and were saying what a pity it was that such an
elegant house should be pulled down.</p>
<p class="qa">Q What effect did that produce upon its value?</p>
<p class="qa">A A great deal, sir; I could have got 600<i>l</i>.
for it before that, and afterwards I could get nothing for it,
till I sold it to Gov. Macquarie for 200 gallons of rum.</p>
<p>On his cross-examination he admitted having assisted in
chairing Mr Macarthur, but did not know of any transparencies
being in his house in ridicule of Gov. Bligh. Before his
cross-examination was finished, he fainted away, and was taken
out of court.</p>
<p>Several serjeants were now examined, who all expressed their
belief, except one, that had the six officers been imprisoned,
the soldiers would have mutinied and released them. After this
the defence closed.</p>

<h3>SUMMING UP.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>LIEUT.-COL.</small> Johnston was then permitted to
offer his observations to the Court. This being heard, Gov. Bligh
gave in his reply, which was read by the Judge Advocate. The
Governor complained much that his whole life had been searched
for occasions of censure. When found, he said he was in the
attitude of tearing his papers, which lay on the floor. 'It has
been said,' be added, that this circumstance would make the
heroes of the British navy blush with shame and burn with
indignation. I certainly at such a suggestion burn with
indignation, but who ought to blush with shame I leave others to
determine. The Court will forgive me if I intrude a moment on
their time, to mention the services in which I have been
employed. For twenty-one years I have been a Post-captain, and
have been engaged in services of danger, not falling within the
ordinary duties of my profession: for four years with Capt. Cook
in the Resolution, and four years more as a commander myself, I
traversed unknown seas, braving difficulties more terrible
because less frequently encountered. In subordinate situations I
fought under Admiral Parker at the Dogger Bank, and Lord Howe at
Gibraltar. In the battle of Camperdown the Director, under my
command, first silenced and then boarded the ship of Admiral de
Winter; and after the battle of Copenhagen, where I commanded the
Glatton, I was sent for by Lord Nelson to receive his thanks
publicly on the quarter-deck. Was it for me then to sully my
reputation and to disgrace the medal I wear by shrinking from
death, which I had braved in every shape? An honourable mind will
look for some other motive for my retirement, and will find it in
my anxiety for those papers, which during this inquiry have been
occasionally produced to the confusion of those witnesses who
thought they no longer existed.</p>
<p>I have not," he concluded, "so far forgotten the feelings of a
man in the character of a Prosecutor, as to feel any interest in
this investigation, except as it is connected with the
vindication of my honour and reputation; and if Col. Johnston's
innocence be consistent with that vindication, I shall be the
first to rejoice at his acquittal. From my whole conduct and
character before I took the command, I ask for a favourable
construction of my actions. To the regulations and orders made
during my government; to the public dispatches sent home to the
Secretary of State; to the written instructions in opposition to
any supposed verbal orders; to the list of the papers seized at
my arrest; I appeal, and with confidence, for proofs of my
general providence, attention, and humanity, my zeal for the
welfare of my country, and my anxiety for the prosperity of the
colony. I now leave the whole case to the judgment of the members
of this honourable court, thanking them for their unwearied
assiduity during this long inquiry, and the patient attention
with which this address has been heard." [<i>The court was
cleared; in less than an hour afterwards the court broke up, and
did not meet again. On the second of July the sentence was
issued, as follows.</i>]</p>

<h3>SENTENCE&mdash;GENERAL ORDERS.</h3>
<p align="right"><i>Horse Guards</i>, 2<i>d July</i>,1811.   </p>
<p><small>"AT</small> a General Court Martial, held at the Royal
Hospital, Chelsea, on the 7th May, 1811, and continued by
adjournments to the 5th of June following, Lieut.-Col. George
Johnston, Major of the 102d regiment, was arraigned upon the
undermentioned charge, viz.&mdash;</p>
<p>'That Lieut.-Col: George Johnston, Major as aforesaid, did, on
or about the 26th day of January, 1808, at Sydney, in the colony
of New South Wales, begin, excite, cause, and join in, a mutiny,
by putting himself at the head of the New South Wales Corps, then
under his command and doing duty in the colony, and seizing and
causing to be seized and arrested, and imprisoning and causing to
be imprisoned, by means of the above-mentioned military force,
the person of William Bligh, Esq. then Captain General and
Governor in Chief in and over the territory of New South
Wales.'</p>
<p>"Upon which charge the court came to the following
decision:&mdash;</p>
<p>'The Court having duly and maturely weighed and considered the
whole of the evidence adduced on the Prosecution, as well as what
has been offered in defence, are of opinion that <i>Lieut.-Col.
Johnston is guilty</i> of the act of Mutiny as described in the
charge, and do therefore sentence him to be <i>Cashiered</i>.</p>
<p>"His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, in the name and on the
behalf of his Majesty, was pleased, ender all the circumstances
of this case, to acquiesce in the sentence of the Court.</p>
<p>"The Court, in passing a sentence so inadequate to the
enormity of the crime of which the prisoner has been found
guilty, have apparently been actuated by a consideration of the
novel and extraordinary circumstances, which, by the evidence on
the face of the proceedings, may have appeared to them to have
existed during the administration of Gov. Bligh, both as
affecting the tranquillity of the colony, and calling for some
immediate decision. But although the Prince Regent admits the
principle under which the court have allowed this consideration
to act in mitigation of the punishment which the crime of, mutiny
would otherwise have suggested, yet no circumstances whatever can
be received by His Royal Highness in full extenuation of an
assumption of power, so subversive of every principle of good
order and discipline under which Lieut.-Col. Johnston has been
convicted.</p>
<p>"The Commander in Chief directs that the charge preferred
against Lieut.-Col. Johnston, together with the sentence of the
Court, and His Royal Highness the Prince Regent's pleasure
thereon, shall be read at the head of every regiment, and entered
in the regimental orderly book.</p>

<h2><i>PART IV.&mdash;OBSERVATIONS AND AFTERMATH</i></h2>
<br>
<a name="ch-26" id="ch-26"></a>
<h3>PATERSON'S OBSERVATIONS.</h3>
<p><small>SUCH</small> was the result of this important trial,
which involved considerations and consequences of the highest
interest. The materials of which this colony is constituted,
audits immense distance from home, certainly requires a vigorous
and respected government. The danger of permitting insurrections
to pass over with impunity, and the necessity of enforcing
colonial subordination, all concurred to require some signal
punishment to be inflicted on time who had ventured to oppose,
degrade, and imprison his Majesty's representative. Yet no doubt
can remain on the mind after perusing the trial, but that
Lieut.-Col. Johnston was actuated by a consideration of the novel
and extraordinary circumstances which appeared to exist, and
which, affecting the tranquillity of the colony, called for some
immediate measure of decision. All the witnesses admitted that
this officer was remarkable for his peaceful and retired habits;
that he had no particular intimacy with the gentleman whose
conduct and trial were the immediate causes of the arrest; that
he filled the expensive end arduous office of Governor without
requiring any remuneration, and that he diminished his popularity
by lessening the expenditure of the public money.</p>
<p>These circumstances sufficiently prove that <i>his intentions
were pure</i>, and that he was actuated by the patriotic motive
of saving the colony from the dreadful effects of military
insubordination, as he had once before saved it from the
licentious violence of a numerous, desperate, and armed mob of
convicts. This affair will, it is to be hoped, be productive of
good consequences. It will render the ministers in future more
cautious and attentive in selecting a Governor properly qualified
for occupying so trying and delicate a situation; and it will
teach inferior officers the propriety of repressing any casual
burst of public indignation, with all their power and influence,
and of holding the post allotted them to the very last
extremity.</p>
<p>The new Colony of New South Wales is undoubtedly one of the
boldest and most singular experiments ever tried. To plant a
settlement merely with robbers, thieves, and vagabonds, is a
project which was never before attempted. In America the
transported felon was landed amidst a sober, honest, and
industrious body of people. His vices were neither permitted nor
encouraged by his associates, and he was soon compelled by the
most irresistible motives to change his habits, and to deserve
the public confidence and approbation. He was, therefore, soon
moulded into the general mass, and his object was to blot out the
remembrance of the causes of his introduction. But in New South
Wales there are but two classes, convicts and their masters, or
overseers. The luxuries and vices of civilized society continue
still to influence and deprave their desires, and to counteract
the effects which a change of place and situation might produce
in accelerating their moral regeneration.</p>
<p>This perhaps is a radical error in the formation of these
settlements. We have, indeed, heard many accounts of the
wonderful transformations which have taken place; of robbers and
highwaymen being converted into good husbands, and of the most
abandoned thieves and prostitutes into intelligent and
industrious mothers, but we fear these statements are
exaggerated; for the history of this colony presents little else
but a continued disgusting, and sickening series of crimes, which
could only originate from the most inveterate depravity. There
are, however, some noble exceptions, where individuals of
industrious habits have raised a small capital, cultivated land,
and after their emancipation have entered into commercial
speculations, and now ranks amongst the richest and most
respectable inhabitants of the colony.</p>
<p>The salubrity of the climate, the fertility of the soil, and
the excellence of the situation of the country adjoining Port
Jackson, are circumstances which must ultimately render it a
great and flourishing country. Settlers possessed of a large
capital have here ample means of employing it with incalculable
advantage. The former scarcity, which so frequently recurred, was
principally owing to the careless, abandoned, and improvident
character of the convicts; but the success of Mr Macarthur, in
rearing stock, shews what may be effected with even a moderate
capital properly applied. The greatest impediment to improvement
arises from the high price of labour; but a scheme, equally sure
and effectual, might be adopted in order to remove this evil.
Were a few spirited capitalists to engage a vessel to proceed to
the coast of China to encourage some of the industrious but
half-starved inhabitants of that country to settle in New South
Wales, a communication might readily be opened, and numbers of
Chinese would flock to a country where the exertions of industry
were so well rewarded. It is a prejudice to suppose that these
people refuse to quit their native country. Necessity operates
with equal power over all men, and the thousands of peaceful and
industrious Chinese which inhabit the numerous hands in the south
of Asia, sufficiently attest their inclination to emigrate.</p>
<p>The combination which would thus be formed between the bold,
restless, and active characters of the British convicts, and the
timid, passive, and industrious habits of the Chinese, would
constitute another curious and singular experiment in morals and
legislation. The European, from his superior address and
knowledge, would acquire a kind of superiority, which, requiring
the assumption of a correspondent character, generally tends to
alter and improve the moral character. New sources of industry
might thus be opened. The whale and seal fishery might be
prosecuted with redoubled vigour. Coals in large quantities might
be sent to India and the Cape of Good Hope. A commerce might be
established with the inhabitants of Peru, extremely advantageous
to both parties. Cargoes of salted provisions might be obtained
in exchange for trinkets, &amp;c. with the natives of the South
Sea Islands, and a most lucrative commerce might be carried on by
purchasing furs, on the north-west coast of America, and selling
them to the Chinese near the mouth of the Yellow River. These
branches of trade are at present scarcely regarded, from the
limited powers of the Colonists; while the raising of articles,
useful and necessary to the mother country and for which their
soil and climate are so well adapted, is from receiving the
encouragement it deserves. But at the present time, when the
strength, commerce, and existence of the country are so furiously
attacked, it is hoped that our opulent merchants, for the good of
their country, as well as for their individual interest, will
emulate each other in encouraging every scheme which is
calculated to promote the prosperity of even the most distant
part of the British empire, particularly a part which, from a
variety of circumstances, seems destined to fix the attention and
excite the admiration of posterity.</p>

<h3>OBSERVATIONS ON BLIGH.</h3>
<p align="center">[Source: Watson]</p>
<p><small>IT</small> is needless to discuss the problem as to
which individuals were actually privy to the final decision for
the arrest of Bligh. The opinion of the English counsel who were
consulted was "that the evidence to be collected from the
correspondence principally affects John Macarthur, Nicholas
Bayly, Doctor Townson, John Blaxland, Garnham Blaxcell, and
Thomas Jamieson, as having previously concerted together with
Major Johnston the arrest and imprisonment of Governor Bligh, and
having afterwards borne a part in the assumed Government."</p>
<p>A careful study of the papers will show that very few of the
malcontents were desirous of extreme measures. The large majority
of the insurrectionaries were men who sought unrestrained freedom
of action, and a few weeks after the arrest of Bligh they were
just as antagonistic to Johnston's administration as they had
been to Bligh's. After the arrest misrepresentations were
industriously circulated by the rebels to justify their action.
It was stated even that Bligh had shown cowardice and was found
under a servant's bed. A picture illustrating this episode was
freely exhibited by sergeant-major Whittle, and is still extant.
Bligh's friends circulated pipes discrediting the leading rebels.
In consequence it is impossible to reach a definite conclusion on
many of the issues which were raised.</p>

<b>Cartoon illustrating the arrest of Governor Bligh</b></p>
<br>
<p>Governor Bligh was the victim of circumstances when he failed
to maintain the government of the colony. Since the departure of
Governor Phillip, in 1792, officials had received many privileges
and perquisites, which, though inconsistent with the public
welfare, had been excused by the fact that, owing to the high
cost of living, the man who held a situation under government
could barely subsist on his pay. Bligh put an end to these
privileges and perquisites. He refused land grants, restricted
assigned labour, and prohibited the barter of spirits. He acted
with the best intentions, and his reforms were urgently needed.
But he paid too little regard to the necessity of conciliating,
so far as might be, powerful interests and powerful individuals.
The determination of his actions and the coarseness of his speech
gave, perhaps, unnecessary offence, but by no means justified the
opposition to and the usurpation of his government.</p>
<p>A fact of importance is that at the critical moment in the
story, the second in command in the colony was major Johnston. It
was generally acknowledged that Johnston was "a well disposed
good natured man&mdash;a cheerful companion and an idol of the
soldiers and the lower order of society." His well meaning good
nature made him an easy tool in the hands of men determined to
overcome any obstacles which might interfere with their personal
interests. Probably at no other time would Macarthur have been
successful in attaining his ends. If lieutenant-governor Paterson
had been present at headquarters, Macarthur would have been
unsuccessful, for Paterson had a strong distrust of him.
Lieutenant-colonel Foveaux had similar feelings, and when he
superseded Johnston Macarthur was retired into private life. It
was otherwise with Johnston, and Macarthur was able to mould his
views, with the result that during the insurrection and
Johnston's subsequent administration, Macarthur held the actual
command. This view is well borne out by the subsequent action of
the English government. In 1809, Johnston and Macarthur sailed
for England in the <i>Admiral Gambier</i>. The government were
desirous of dropping all further inquiry into the rebellion, but
Johnston forced an issue.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>When Governor Macquarie arrived, in 1810, he made a general
summary of the circumstances of the arrest. He stated:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It occurs to me that your Lordship may perhaps wish to know
my opinion and Sentiments with regard to the extraordinary
transactions and disturbances that took place here, as connected
with the arrest of Governor Bligh, and the subversion of his
Government, by Lieut.-Colonel Johnston, at the head of the New
South Wales Corps, on the 26th of January, 1808.</p>
<p>"I have taken particular pains to discover the cause which
gave rise to that most daring event, and to the mutinous conduct
of Lt.-Colonel Johnston and the New South Wales Regiment, and
find it extremely difficult to form a just Judgment on this
delicate and mysterious subject, Party rancour having run so high
as to preclude the possibility of arriving at the truth without a
very minute and legal investigation of the whole business.</p>
<p>"But, in justice to Governor Bligh, I must say that I have not
been able to discover any Act of his which could in any degree
form an excuse for, or in any way warrant, the violent and
Mutinous Proceedings pursued against him on that occasion, very
few complaints having been made to me against him, and even those
few are rather of a trifling nature.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, there cannot be a doubt but that Governor
Bligh's administration was extremely unpopular, particularly
among the higher orders of the People; And from my own short
experience. I must acknowledge that he is a most unsatisfactory
Man to transact business with, from his want of candor and
decision, in so much that it is impossible to place the smallest
reliance on the fulfilment of any engagement he enters into."</p>
<p>All the unbiassed contemporary opinions are in full accordance
with Macquarie's summary.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The administration of Governor Bligh and its results form one
of the most important milestones in the development of the civil
life of Australia. Had this stormy epoch been eliminated from the
history of this continent, progress might have been retarded
indefinitely. In the interval between the departure of Governor
Phillip in 1792, and the arrival of Governor Bligh, the
administration of the colony had fallen into the hands of what
was to all intents and purposes a small oligarchy, consisting of
the military officers and a few wealthy partisans. Their one
object was to acquire wealth. Everything was subordinated to this
desire. with the result that the many outside the oligarchy were
forced to lose the profits of their honest labour in the ruinous
traffic which benefited chiefly the members of the ruling class.
Bligh recognised the evil, and his deposition was brought about
because it was perceived that this was the only means to prevent
immediate and complete reform. But his arrest did not result in
the failure of his efforts and a permanent reversion to the
former conditions. It concentrated the attention of the English
authorities on the conditions of the colony. It forced them to
initiate immediate reforms. It directly caused the recall of the
New South Wales Corps, which, by long residence, had become the
most powerful and perhaps the most evil factor in the community.
It indirectly led to the reform of the law courts, to the removal
of the restrictions on trade and commerce, and to the general
betterment of the conditions of life in the colony.</p>

<h3>OBSERVATIONS ON JOHNSTON.</h3>
<p align="center">[Source: Watson]</p>
<p><small>IN</small> spite of a certain weakness of decision,
Johnston's character was an admirable one. He was "a well
disposed good natured man." He had few if any personal enemies,
and was popular with all persons he came in contact with. In his
routine military administration he was methodical and just, and
was the idol of the rank and file. His very good nature made him
the easy tool of conspirators, and this was his undoing. Prior to
the rebellion, he resented the interference of Governor Bligh in
military matters, but when making his report to the military
secretary to the Duke of York on this subject, his diffidence and
fairness were shown when he stated: "I will detail to you . . . .
some of the most glaring acts of Governor Bligh's indecorous and,
<i>I hope I might be pardoned if I said</i>, oppressive
conduct."</p>
<p>Prior to the arrest of Bligh, the malcontents probably held
frequent conferences with Johnston, for without him action was
impossible. Captain Abbott stated that the arrest had been
discussed, but it is probable that Johnston was averse to extreme
action. When John Macarthur arrived at the barracks after his
liberation on the 26th of January, 1808, Johnston is reported to
have said: "God's curse! What am I to do, Macarthur? Here are
these fellows advising me to arrest the Governor!" to which
Macarthur replied: "Advising you; then, Sir, the only thing left
for you to do is to do it. To advise on such matters is legally
as criminal as to do them." If this conversation is correctly
recorded it is proof that Johnston was the tool in the hands of
the malcontents, and also that Macarthur at least recognised the
guilt of the action.</p>
<p>Both at the time of the arrest and throughout his
administration, Johnston failed to assert his personal authority,
and it was generally recognised that the actual administration
was in the hands of Macarthur. Johnston therefore was only the
figurehead under whom the maladministration for the following six
months was carried on.</p>

<h3>AFTERMATH.</h3>
<p><small>AFTER</small> his return to England, Bligh was
promoted, in July, 1811, to the rank of rear-admiral of the blue
squadron, and in June. 1814, to that of vice-admiral, but
remained on the half-pay list. He died in Bond-street, London, on
the 7th of December, 1817, and was buried in Lambeth
churchyard.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Johnston returned to the colony in October, 1812, and lived in
retirement on his estate called "Annandale", near Sydney. He
died, universally respected, on the 3rd of January, 1823. At the
time of his death his case was being considered by the war
office, and it is probable that he would have been reinstated to
his former rank in the army if he had lived a few months
longer.</p>

<p>Macarthur was dealt with very differently. No legal
proceedings were taken against him; but advantage was taken of
the power which the Government exercised of controlling the
immigration to the colony; and he was prohibited from returning.
In 1816, the Secretary of State, in view of assurances received
by him from various sources that Macarthur was sensible of the
impropriety of conduct which led to his departure from the
colony, withdrew the objections to his return. Macarthur,
however, would not accept this; he refused to acknowledge any
regret or concern for the part he had taken in Bligh's arrest. He
went farther and stated that he considered it one of the most
meritorious he had ever been engaged in. He took a high stand,
which did him infinite credit. He made known his decision to
suffer in silence no longer. Unless he was permitted to return,
unconditionally, to the colony, he would petition Parliament, and
"lay open all the iniquities of Mr. Bligh, of which I held in my
possession abundant proofs, which I was not to be deterred from
producing in the way that the unfortunate and ill-advised Colonel
Johnston had been." Eventually, in February, 1817, the Government
agreed to permit Macarthur to return, without any admissions or
conditions.</p>
