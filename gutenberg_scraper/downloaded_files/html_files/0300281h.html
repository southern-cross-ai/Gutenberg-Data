<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>Preface (1931)</h2>

<p>It was a pastime that grew on you like a fever&mdash;collecting these
outdoor sports in Finsbury, Hackney, Islington, Whitechapel,
Stepney, Limehouse, Poplar, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Deptford,
Camberwell, Kennington, Bermondsey, Rotherhithe, Shadwell, and God
knows where else; it brought you in touch with new lives and new
ideas. The first result of the craze was an article, a little
Cockney study, in the <i>English Review</i> (November 1913). By
that time the game-microbe, far from growing extenuated, had
established itself firmly in the system; incipient stamp-collectors
will recognize this symptom. The following pages, published in
1916, mark another stage in the progress of the infection; and I
might have continued to note down Street Games till Doomsday, and
compiled a veritable Corpus of them, but for the fact that, owing
to other occupations, it became increasingly difficult to find the
necessary tune. Time! It required time, days and weeks, to stalk
these children and win their confidence. Whoever doubts this&mdash;let
him try...</p>

<p>One reviewer lamented that the book did not contain sufficient
descriptions of the sports. I could double their number at this
moment, since the old manuscripts, an enormous and fascinating
bundle of play-rules written by the children themselves, are lying
before me. But I does it matter how all of them are played? What
matters is that they actually are, or at least were, played. Their
peculiar rules strike me as neither important, nor even interesting
(see page 85). I think it should suffice to have copied, for nearly
every separate class of game, one or more of its playing-rules in
the original language without the alteration of a letter, no two of
them being done by the same child. For an almost unintelligible
specimen see note to page 39; others wrote surprisingly well.</p>

<p>The typescript was offered to several publishers in vain, though
Andrew Melrose took kindly to it. 'It is simple fact,' he wrote,
'that your <i>Street Games</i> fills me with admiration for it as a
literary achievement of the most difficult kind triumphantly done.'
That sounded promising. He would not have it, all the same; not
even gratis. 'In short, I can't see a public for it.'</p>

<p>He might have seen a public, I suspect, had the material been
cast into the shape of an informative treatise. There is always a
public for stodgy professorial dissertations on out-of-the-way
subjects; and indeed, in the case of Street Games, the thing had
already been done after a fashion. That was not my aim. I wished to
produce a social document, however unpretending. My point, my only
point, was the inventiveness of the children. That is why I piled
up the games into a breathless catalogue which, to obtain its full
momentum and psychological effect, should be read through,
<i>accelerando</i>, from beginning to end without a break. It is
then that you fully realize the youngsters' inventive powers. Hence
the apparent disorder in my recital and its impromptu flavour,
which were deliberately contrived to convey that sense of flurried
accumulation. I thought I had succeeded in making this clear to an
intelligent reader. Yet a critic complained of my 'undigested
material,' and begged his readers to 'forget the irritation caused
by casual methods.' If he knew what pains those casual methods had
cost me!</p>

<p>Another of them made a sager remark when he said that one
marvels at the 'stupidity of the social reformer who desires to
close to the children the world of adventure, to take from them
their birthright of the streets, and coop them up in well-regulated
and uninspiring playgrounds where, under the supervision of
teachers, their imagination will decline, their originality
wither.' That was well said. For the standardization of youth
proceeds relentlessly; it is part of what Richard Aldington calls
the insane process of making great groups happy by destroying the
personal happiness of every individual in that group; it is one of
many steps in the direction of that termite-ideal towards which we
are trending. I wonder how many of these games are still
played?</p>

<p>1931.</p>

<hr>

<p class="cpb">LONDON STREET GAMES</p>

<p>There's not much for <i>us</i> to do, down our way&mdash;in the way
of sports, I mean. Nothing at all, in fact. When we come home from
work we generally go straight indoors and have a lay-down, and a
cup of tea and a pipe; or else we go out and watch a match
somewhere. There's always the 'Three Swans', of course...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Boys' Games</h2>

<p>But the youngsters get on all right&mdash;seem to, at all events.
Some of them have got bats and stumps or footballs, and off they go
into the park; and some of the girls have got shuttlecocks, and off
<i>they</i> go. But most of them haven't, you know; so they just
lark about where they are. PAPER-CHASE and ROUNDERS, for instance;
you know those? They're plain sailing. But some of these games,
like EGG-IN-CAP (also called EGGET), are rather complicated; and as
to MONDAY-TUESDAY (or NUMBERS; another kind of egg-in-cap)&mdash;it
would take me till next Saturday <i>week</i> to explain it. Perhaps
you can make it out from this description:</p>

<p>'After clipping the throer calls out the name of the day in the
weke and the chap whats taken that day has to catch if he misses it
they all run away and shout no Egg if I move&mdash;becose if they dont
the throer can say a egg if you move&mdash;&amp; that helps to make the
quantity of the Eggs. The Misser of the ball throes it at one of
the player and if he misses it is a egg to him and if he hits its a
egg to the one he hit. After the throer has hit his man&mdash;the man
has to throw it up again. If one of the player catch the Ball they
throw it up again and call out the name, the total of egg to get
you out is three. After the game is over the winner has clockwork
on the Losers; they each stand up against a wall wile the winner
throes at their heads with the ball. They can also claim 3 Hard
throes or six soft ones.'</p>

<p>Now you know how it's done.</p>

<p>Then there's QUEENIE, which is really a girls' game. One boy
stands on the kerbstone with his back to the street, and they call
him Queenie. He throws a ball backwards over his shoulders into the
street, where four others are standing to catch it. As soon as one
of them has it, they all hold their hands behind their backs, and
then Queenie has to turn round and face them and guess who has the
ball. If he guesses right, he goes on being Queenie; if not, the
boy who has the ball takes his place.</p>

<p>Why they call it QUEENIE? Because that happens to be its name.
Aunt Eliza, who has travelled all over the place and can explain
mostly everything (thinks she can) tells me that QUEENIE is a
Chinese game and that she has seen it played there and that it must
have come to London over the docks. I daresay it did. But the worst
of Aunt Eliza is that you never know whether&mdash;</p>

<p>There are other ball-games, such as HOT RICE and FRENCH CRICKET
and FOOTBALL-CRICKET and FIDDLE-DE-DEE and PALM OVER (a rough game)
and CATCH (also called TEASER), which goes not as you think it
does, but like this&mdash;</p>

<p>'Two boys stand at each side of the road and one in the middle,
that's Hee. One of them tries to get the ball over middles head for
the other to get it but if middle gets it the throer goes
Hee'&mdash;</p>

<p>and WALL-BOUNCING and KING and MISSINGS OUT and FRENCH FOOT and
KNOCKING UP THREE CATCHERS and SWOLO (rather like hockey) and DAYS
OF THE YEAR and PUNCH-BALL and BOUNCE-BALL and TOUCH IT EUN and
HUNDRED WINS (where you knock bricks out of a ring with a ball) and
ONE-TWO-THREE-AND-A-LAIRY (I wish I knew what a-lairy meant) and
ALONG THE ROW and UNDER THE ROW and ACROSS THE ROW and RABBIT IN
THE HUTCH and FIVE-TEN and BASE (or DOLL) and WALLIE (because
played against a wall) and STRIKE UP KNOCK DOWN and IN THE HAT and
DUSTHOLES, and no doubt many more. But however many I might tell
you, there are not nearly as many as there ought to be.</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Perkins&mdash;he works with the firm of Framlingham
Brothers (Limited), a likeable well-spoken gentleman, and he often
watches the children playing and sometimes we have a talk about
things at the 'Three Swans'&mdash;Mr. Perkins says, speaking of
ball-games, exactly what I always say, which is this: that there's
a difficulty about ball-games, which is this: that most of them
generally need a ball; meaning you can't play with a ball unless
you have a ball to play with. And you generally haven't got
one&mdash;meaning the children. And then the trouble begins. Because
then you have to start thinking about something that doesn't need a
ball.</p>

<p>Somebody or other may have a top, for those who care about this
kind of game. Top-games are not as fashionable as they used to be;
still, there are a good many of them left. You can play
TOP-FOOTBALL, and SKATING, and GRULLEY (also called GEOWLEY, or
GROWLING KEEPS, or PLACING), and GETTING IN THE RING, and SENDING
MESSAGES, and GULLEY HOLE (or HULLY-GULLY) and FLY DUTCHMAN and
BACK SCALINGS and TRACING and RAILWAY LINE and MOUSETRAP (where you
have to get the string wound round the top as it spins) and
CHUCKING and GRUDGES and GULLEY KEEP TOP and GULLEY KNOCK ABOUT and
FETCHING HOME, and PEG IN THE RING, and BOAT-RACE, and PEGGING, and
LIVE O's and CHIPSTONE. For CHIPSTONE you need hard smooth ground
and some pebbles and this is how you play it:</p>

<p>'Two lines about 6 ft. apart are drorn. A boy first puts his
stone on a place half-way between the two, he spins his top picks
it up and makes it spin in the palm of his hand and chips his stone
towards the line. The first boy who gets his stone beyond the line
he wins.'</p>

<p>I used to know a good deal about tops, but it's quite a while
since I played, and I have forgotten half their names, and couldn't
describe them if I tried. I can only remember peg-tops,
whipping-tops, mushrooms, klondykes, tomtits, boxers (made of
boxwood), racing tops, corkscrews, clodhoppers, humming tops,
Russian tops, Jews' tops, Japan tops (rather flatter at the end
than the usual kind), French tops (red and white on the top, with a
little thing for tying a piece of string on, to spin with), and
window-breakers, which are rather like mushrooms.</p>

<p><i>And</i> the dumb-bargee.</p>

<p>Ever heard of a dumb-bargee? It's a kind of top after the style
of a klondyke. It's too heavy to rise from the ground like a racer.
You simply can't get a rise out of a dumb-bargee. Perhaps that
accounts for the name. Because it's easy enough to get a rise out
of an ordinary bargee, isn't it? And when you do, he's not exactly
what you call 'dumb', is he? Not the bargees I've known.</p>

<p>And if you have no tops, you can make up games with your caps or
boots or jackets. DEAD MAN'S EISE (also called DEAD MAN'S DARK
SCENERY or COAT) is one of these jacket-games, where one party has
to hide, covered up in their coats. Shoe-games are rather
commoner&mdash;there's SIZE OP YOUR BOOT (one boy has to be blind-folded
for this), and BOOT IN THE TUB, and NAILS, and COBBLER COBBLER MEND
MY SHOE. But the commonest are the cap-games. Here are some of
them: CHIMNEY-POTS (or UPSETTING THE CHIMNEY); HAT UNDER THE MOON;
MOUSE IN TRAP; SAUSAGE; KNOCK HIM DOWN DONKEY; PULL FOR THE SHORE
SAILOR; SUGAR AND MILK; HOP o' MY THUMB; TOUCH-CAP. In the three
last you have to go 'through the mill', if you fail. NUTS IN CAP is
played with caps and crackers (Spanish nuts); in HITTING THE SUN
you must throw your cap at your opponent's at about twelve yards
distance; other cap-games are QUOITS (with folded-up caps) and FIRE
ENGINES, and SHYING OVER THE MOON, and SHOOTING THE STABS, and
PILING THE DONKEY, and CAP IT, and WHERE's THIS LITTLE HAT To Go,
and SALLY ROUND THE JAM-POT (with piled-up caps), and BALL IN CAP,
and RUN A MILE FOR A HALF-PENNY, and HOOK AND CAP, and HOT SOUP,
and Fox COME OUT OF YOUR DEN, and THROW OVER, and MILLER'S SACK,
and WHACK CAP, and HATCHING EGGS, and UNDER THE GARTER. All these
are played with caps, and some of them, such as FLIES (or SALLY)
ROUND THE JAM-POT, are really duty games, of which I must tell you
later on.</p>

<p>And if you have no caps, which you sometimes haven't, you must
just find something else to play with. Buttons, for
instance&mdash;everybody knows the old game of BUTTONS (or BANG-OUT, or
BANGINGS) where you pitch them against a wall and have to measure
the intervals between them with the span of your fingers and always
end up with a row about cheating distances. You can make a fine
gamble out of BUTTONS if you play the same game with halfpennies;
you can win quite a lot, when there are no coppers about...</p>

<p>But nobody need play for money unless they like, and, anyhow, I
don't care to talk about these things. Because, of course, our boys
don't gamble, and there's an end to it. They never try to make
money, like some do, out of silly tricks like BRAG, and BOOKS, and
SPIN UP THE PENNY, and RAPS ON THE BUGLE, and NAP, and TRUMP, and
BEAT YOUR NEIGHBOUR OUT OF DOORS, and MY BIRDIE WHISTLES, and
POLISH BANKER, and DONKEY, and TUPPENCE You HEAD IT, and PITCHING
UP THE LINE (double or single), and SHOVE HA'PENNY, and NEAREST THE
LINE TAKES, and CHUCK-FARDEN, and PONTOON*, and PIEMAN, and ODD MAN
SPINS, and ON THE STICK, and GUESSING WITH THREE CARDS, and
GUESSING WITH SIX CARDS, and ANCHOR-CROWN-HEAD, and PITCH AND Toss
and BLIND SAM and OVERS KEEPS&mdash;or whatever all these things are
called; no, not <i>our</i> boys. They never climb down to the cut**
on a Sunday afternoon like some people do&mdash;although, as a matter of
fact, it's a pretty safe place just now, because only three weeks
ago a couple of peelers were chucked into the water for
interfering.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The French 'Vingt-et-un.']]</p>

<p class="footnote">[** Footnote: The cut is the canal.]</p>

<p>Many of these sports are played with cigarette-cards or with
ordinary playing cards, or with either; and I might tell you the
names of some of those of the first kind, seeing that the lads have
to play their card-games out of doors, hereabouts, if&mdash;if it
weren't for the gambling they lead to. For instance, there's
KNOCKING DOLLY OUT o' BED where you lay down three for a king, two
for a jack, one for a queen and none for an ace, and&mdash;well, there
you are! You must just come and ask some of the boys higher up the
street; maybe they've heard of the game*. Ours are respectable.
Gambling is forbidden by law, and they know it. That's why you have
to be so darned careful not to get copped.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Footnote: One of <i>them</i> tells me that
OVERS KEEPS goes like this: 'Make a line, pitch up ha'pennies, if
they go over, they are kept by the man whose coin is nearest to the
line under. He keeps all those what are over, and spins up those
what are under.']</p>

<p>Or you can play with tins, or bits of metal and wood, or with
nuts. In THROWING THE NICKER (or TIN ON THE LINE) you really ought
to use a piece of lead or tin, or an old key, but sometimes you
haven't got one, and then you must put up with a slate; and the
same with NIXIE and PITCH OUT and PITCHING ON THE HAT and PITCHING
IN THE HAT and BULLS EYE and ONE, Two, THREE and OVER THE LINE.
There are many tin-can games, such as TIN-CAN BUMP and TIN-CAN JUMP
and TIN-CAN CATCH and TIN-CAN FISHING and TIN-CAN FETCH IT and
TIN-CAN RACING and TIN-CAN GO IT and TIN-CAN TOUCH and TIN-CAN HIDE
IT and TIN-CAN HAVE IT and COCK-SHY and CATCH THE RIDER and
PITCHING UP THE WALL. The best of all of them is TIN-CAN COPPER (or
KICK-CAN POLICEMAN) which goes like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>'You get a tin and place it on the road. You then toss up who is
to be tin-can copper. After the one is found you throw it up the
street &amp; then go and hide. The one who has to go after the can
must not turn round and must come backwards. When he has got back
he puts the tin down &amp; then looks to see if he can see you&mdash;if
he see you he points were you are and shout your name &amp; Bangs
the can down three times, if he does not see you you can creep up
and steal the can &amp; fling it up the road again and all of them
can hide. The last one caught is the Tin-can-Copper.'</p>

<p>There are different ways of playing TIPPIT and I can't stop to
explain them; one is played with sticks, and one without, and
another with tin; and you can play tippit with a top and a coin; in
fact, it 'a one of those names, like 'fire-engines' or 'pitching up
the line', that don't mean anything in particular and are used for
all kinds of sports. With sticks you can also play CUNJER, and
CATCHING THE FALLING WAND (a ring-game for children) and SEIZING
STICKS (or SCOTCH AND ENGLISH):&mdash;</p>

<p>'One of A.'s side tries to rush and get a stick from B.'s side
without being caught. If he is caught he remains a prisoner, unless
touched by one of his own side again. But no sticks can be taken by
any one while there are prisoners. The game is won by the side who
gets all the sticks'&mdash;</p>

<p>and WAND BALANCE RACE and different kinds of TIBBY-CAT (or
NIBBY-CAP) such as SETS and RUNS and WOGGLES and CATCHERS and
SINGLES. You can't play TIBBY-CAT if there are any blue boys
hanging around; they're down on the game, because people sometimes
get their windows smashed or their eyes bunged up.</p>

<p>HITTING THE MUMMY is played with nuts&mdash;</p>

<p>'You throw nuts against a wall and let them lay there till one
of them is hit, then he who hits has the lot. But if he doesn't
leave Mummy laying down he has to pay six.'</p>

<p>With nuts (or cherry-stones or date-stones) you can also play
You HAVE ALL You GET and KNOCK HIM DOWN HAVE HIM and TIP-TAP and
MOP CHEERY-STONES and UP THE GUTTER-SPOUT; as well as another game
for which you need nuts and an old tobacco-tin. I can't tell you
its name, because I don't know it; and the lads can't tell you
either, because it hasn't got one&mdash;not yet. It's quite a new
game.</p>

<p>But some of the best sports are those which they make up without
anything at all, just out of their heads, like STAGS, and
FOX-HUNTING, and SHOEING THE WILD HORSE (you need confederates for
this, and a fresh boy; but it's quite a respectable game), and
TOMMY ALL ROUND, and BLIND DONKEY, and SAILOR, and HORSE-SOLDIERS.
HORSE-SOLDIERS (also called FLYING ANGELS) is rather rough, and so
is COCK AND HEN FIGHT. Or hide-and-seek games like I SPY&mdash;SPIT IN
YOUE EYE, which goes like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Five or ten can play, one has to hide wile the Others hide. If
he sees you you have to come out of your Crib &amp; twig &amp; get
home. The one that hides can only come a little way from home&mdash;to
get home you have to run and touch the piller or Post where he was
hiding'.</p>

<p>POINT is like I SPY; but you need a lamp-post for it. MONKEY IN
THE WOOD is the same kind of game, but without a lamp-post; FORTY
and INNER AND OUTER are other hide-and-seek games. Or hunting
sports like WIDDY, which you play in winter to get warm with. There
are different ways of playing WIDDY; one is this:</p>

<p>'Say there's ten of you, one is widdy, thats Hee. He runs after
the others till he catches his one then there's two that must hold
hands then they run after the eight till they catch another and so
on till there all cort and the last one to be cawt is widdy for
next go'.</p>

<p>Or you can make WIDDY into a hopping game. One is 'he', they all
gather round him and sing&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Widdy Widdy way, I shan't play,<br>
Kick your post and run away&mdash;</p>

<p>and then he kicks his lamp-post and hops after them on one leg.
I don't know what 'Widdy' [Footnote: <i>Vide</i>&mdash;look out.] means,
but I should think that all these hunting 'he' games are rather old
(other 'he' games are sometimes new). FISHING (or FAG-OUT) is
another of them, and COALER another, and LAST ONE HOME another.</p>

<p>To play DELIVER UP THOSE GOLDEN JEWELS (or DELIVER UP THE BLACK
PUDDING) you need confederates. You go up to a soft boy and say '
Let's have a game of Deliver up those Golden Jewels <i>and you
shall be judge</i>', So the softy gets very keen about being judge,
and sits down 'in Court' on a step or somewhere; then they lead up
the prisoner who is in the know, you know, and they ask him a lot
of sham questions; and as soon as the judge says 'Therefore deliver
up them golden jools', the prisoner&mdash;no, I can't tell you any more
about that game. It's rather rude. None of our boys are caught at
it more than once&mdash;not at playing the judge, at least. There are
other games of this sort, like WHITE MICE and HIGH TREASON and
THREE GOLDEN BALLS and FARMER LEFT HIS HAT BEHIND and SCORING and
RUNNING TOO FAST and HIDE AND SEEK (<i>not</i> the usual kind);
they can all be played in a respectable fashion, but the worst of
it is, they generally aren't. Another is called P...E. That's
worse. I can't say anything whatever about it except that you need
good confederates and a boy who is quite new to the quarter. And
some of them are still worse; not at all nice, in fact. If you want
to find out about them, you must come yourself and talk to a few of
our rough chaps. You might ask them about TOUCHING THE KING'S
SCEPTRE. If you can get that out of them, you can get
anything...</p>

<hr>

<p>Now I daresay you've heard of leap-frog, and maybe you think
there's only one way of playing it. Well, if you want to see how
our boys can invent things out of their heads because, and only
because, they have no bats or other things to play with, you should
come and watch them at their leap-frog and duty games. (In
leap-frog and overbacks they go in certain fixed orders over each
other's backs; in duty one man stays down until another fails in
the duty and takes his place). Always inventing new kinds, too. You
could write a whole book about sports of this kind, each with its
separate rules and separate name &mdash;fancy names they are, some of
them&mdash;and each with its 'showman' or 'duty-man' or 'namer' who
decides what things are to be done. There's ALL THE WINKLES, a
grand game for as many as you like; and HOPPING TO LONDON and ALL
THE WAY TO LONDON and RACING TO LONDON and FOUR WAYS TO LONDON and
HOT PIES and COLD PIES and HERE COMES MY SHIP FULL SAIL and BUNNY
RABBIT (rather difficult) and HOP, STEP AND JUMP and HOPPING ROUND
BIG BEN and ALL HANDS ON DECK (also called FINGER ON THE BLOCK).
CUT-A-LUMP (or CUTTER)&mdash;that's another kind. Bill bends down in the
gutter, while the others stand up behind him in a row; the first of
them is called cut-a-lump. He goes over Bill's back, and where his
feet touch the ground&mdash;there he makes a mark; then the next boy,
without moving from his old place, has to jump over Bill and touch
the same mark; then the next, and the next&mdash;over they go! Of
course, it becomes more difficult with each jump, as the distance
gets wider.</p>

<p>Whoever first misses the mark must take the place of Bill, who
then becomes cutter in his turn. That's cut-a-lump: see?</p>

<p>Why it's called cut-a-lump?</p>

<p>Because he cuts a lump off the distance in front of Bill.</p>

<p>Then there's FROG IN FIELD and FROG IN THE MIDDLE and FROG IN
THE WATER and INCH IT UP and SHRIMPS (where you have to go over a
boy's back with your cap doubled up on your head&mdash;many duty games
have to be played with caps) and LOBSTER (also called EGGS AND
BACON, where you have to throw down your cap while going over his
head and pick it up with your teeth without rolling off his back)
and EGG IN A DUCK'S BELLY (holding the cap between your legs) and
CAT o' NINE TAILS and SPUR THE DONK and OVER THE MOON and FOOT IT
(where you jump sideways) and CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE and CAT
ON HOT BRICKS (about as good as any) and POSTMAN and HOPPING ALL
THE WAY TO CHURCH and MUSSENTOUCHET&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">'In mussentouchet one boy flies over back and
then he puts the boys' hats anywhere he likes [on their bodies] and
tells them to run to a certain spot and they must not touch their
hats. The one whose hat falls off is down'&mdash;</p>

<p>and NEWSPAPERS (or PAPERS) and Two FOOT FLY and STIFF-LEGGED
COPPER (also called POLICEMAN or STIFF BLOATERS or SHOWING No
IVORY, because, after jumping over, you have to stand stock still
and not show either your teeth or your finger nails) and WHITEWASH
and PLATES AND DISHES and FLYING THE GARTER and WRITING LETTER TO
PUNCH and SENDING LETTER TO CANADA, which is played like this:</p>

<p class="letter">'When all the boys have gone over the boy who
they call namer calls out sending a letter to Canada. Then the boy
who is down has to bend down again then all the boys write the
letter on his back then they put it up his coat then stamp it then
they hit him with their knees on the...'</p>

<p>or perhaps you can understand it better from this:</p>

<p class="letter">'One boy bends down and then you pretend to write
on his back then you bang for the Stamp and then put it under his
coat and push him first leap over his back and say Sending a Letter
to Canada '.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think these are all the duty games they play, but
there are a good many more, such as FLIES ROUND THE JAM-POT and HOT
COCKLES AND HOT MUSTARD (rather like BUNNY BABBIT) and SHOOTING THE
MOON (played with caps and spittle) and YANK HIM OVER and UPSETTING
THE APPLE-CART and WEAK HORSES (played against a lamp-post where
you pile yourselves as high as possible) and STEPPING-STONES
(difficult) and GLORY and FISHING FOR OYSTERS and TICKLERS and
COUNTRY (or NORTH, SOUTH, EAST AND WEST) and BUMPERS (or BUMPUMS)
and SMASHING YOUR GRANDMA'S WINDOWS and BACKY-O and ROMAN CANDLES
(or THUMBS UP: very difficult) and CHINESE ORDERS and CHINESE
YUM-YUM and KING JOHN SAYS So and DEAD SOLDIERS and SALMON FISHING
and MISCHIEF and PULLING LEGS and FOLLOW MY LEADER (yes; duty) and
PIGGY BACKS and WHEELBARROWS and JOCKY WHACK and SWIMMING IN BLUE
WATER. SWIMMING IN BLUE WATER is played like this:</p>

<p class="letter">'One boy stoops down in bending attitude, and
another boy lays on his back crossways, and does the action of
swimming, if the boy who is swimming falls off he has to be
down'&mdash;</p>

<p>and CARRYING THE OLD WOMAN'S WASHING and MESSENGERS (or
MESSAGES) and ELEPHANTS' TRUNKS AND TAILS and SKINNING A RABBIT and
MOGGIES [Footnote: Moggies are cats.] ON THE WALL and SOPPY SOLDIER
and TAILOR. And if you're not yet tired of duty games, I will tell
you one or two more. There's PICKING LEAVES and SCISSORS and
THROUGH THE MOON and PULLING BONES OUT OF FISHES and PORTER
COLLECTING TICKETS (or TICKET PUNCHING) and HOP THERE AND BACK
AGAIN and UP SIDES DOWN MIDDLE and NELSON and HIDING HATS IN THE
HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT and POLLY TELL ME THE TIME (duty) and BUCK,
BUCK, HOW MANY FINGERS HAVE I GOT UP and SOLOMON SILENT READING.
SOLOMON SILENT READING&mdash;queer name, isn't it? This is how the game
goes:</p>

<p class="letter">'First of all a boy bends down and each boy flies
over and the Duty man being last shouts out a game while flying
over such as Solomon silent reading. A boy must bend down, then the
Duty man thinks of a word and writes it on the boy's back with his
finger, then the one who is bending down gets up and tells the Duty
man what he wrote, then all the other boys stoop down one at a time
and the Duty man repeats the writing [on their backs] and the last
one to get it wrong has to give down'&mdash;</p>

<p>and BULL-DOG RACE and EATING FISH AND POTATOES and UPSETTING
MOTHER'S GRAVY and HANDS OFF and CAP TELLING and WHO WILL TAKE THE
PIG (or the UGLY BEAR) TO MARKET and ARM'S LENGTH and LAUGH AND CRY
and BRASS BAND and CANNON BALLS and FOOT IT and DEAF AND DUMB MOSES
(also called DUTY FOUR, where you have to pretend to be deaf and
dumb) and FIRE ENGINES (or FIREMAN: duty) and STICK IN THE MUD (or
STICKUMS) and BRITISH WORKMAN and SUGAR CANES and CARRYING
CROCODILES' FOOD. You play CROCODILES' FOOD like this:</p>

<p class="letter">'All the boys leap over one's back and then run
to end of street and then you all come back with your hands and
feet on the ground and your chest above the ground and then you
place your hat on your chest and walk along and the boy who falls
over has to go down'</p>

<p>in other words, the cap (the crocodiles' food) has to lie on
your stomach, which is sometimes called chest, while you move
forwards with your back to the earth supporting yourself on hands
and feet, as you can see perfectly well from this other
description:</p>

<p class="letter">'Have to run to top of street then the boy who is
down shouts out carrying crocodiles' food, then the other boys have
to come back with their hats on their chests and their hands behind
and running along on their backs.'</p>

<p>and GAMMON BASHER and CATCHING STONES and RACE FOR A LEAF and
CARRIAGES and ALL SORTS and PULLING UP FATHER'S RHUBARB and
HAYSTACK and KING'S DINNER and MOUSE IN THE TRAP and PUNCTURED TYRE
and COBBLER and DRUMS and FOOT AND LEE and FINGER IN THE BIRD'S
NEST and BABBLE and OVER THE GARDEN WALL and THREE AND ON and How
FAR CAN YOU RUN and BUNG THE BARREL and PICKING THE BLOATER and
SIFT THE GRAPES and HOT ROLLS and WARNIE I 'M A COMING&mdash;and that's
just a few of them.</p>

<p>WARNIE has to be played against a wall, and this is what they
say to it:</p>

<p class="poem">Hi Jimmy Nacko, one, two, three&mdash;Obobé,
Obobé-all-y-over!<br></p>

<p>Warnie, I suppose, means 'I warn ye', because they say it just
before they jump. But I can't even make a guess at Obobe&mdash;wish I
could. It's quite possible that it never meant anything at all, to
begin with. The boys sometimes call it High Bobbery&mdash;it's a way
they have, of working the old names round into a sort of sense,
when they've forgotten their real meaning. I must write and ask
Aunt Eliza; she knows everything (thinks she does). As to Jimmy
Nacko&mdash;they sometimes call it Jimmy Wag-tail, but one of the lads
tells me it means 'Neck, ho!' which only shows how they like
twisting the names about. (That's why they now say shuttlecock
instead of shuttle-cork, because they forget it's played with a
cork). What I think about Jimmy Nacko is this: judging by his name,
he was just an old shonk of some kind*...</p>

<p class="footnote">[* A shonk is a foreigner, generally a
Jew.]</p>

<p>And now I must tell you about RELEASE. There is one game of this
kind played by small children, and not worth talking about. But the
real RELEASE (or ROBBERS AND COPPERS) is quite another thing
altogether. In RE-LEASE you take sides and catch prisoners; you
have to touch their heads and 'crown' them; that's what makes them
prisoners. And that's what makes them so wild&mdash;because the other
chaps can't always release them; and that's why the old people bar
the game&mdash;because you always get your clothes torn; and that's why
it's also called BEDLAM&mdash;because there are so many rows while it's
going on. You see, they don't like being made prisoners and being
'crowned' and having their heads touched&mdash;not at all, at all. Just
mad, it makes them.</p>

<p>'D' ye want a claht over the jor?' says one. ''Cos yer never did
touch me 'ead, so there.'</p>

<p>'Ole Ikey see'd me doos it.'</p>

<p>'Liar. 'Cos 'e wos t' ovver side o' the street.'</p>

<p>''E never. Yer wos on the grahnd when I crahned yer napper.'</p>

<p>'Liar. Yer sez I wos a-layin dahn when all the time I wos on me
stumps. Yer finks I'm up the pole to 'ear yer tork. Knock 'arf yer
fice orff.'</p>

<p>'Not 'arf. Yer knows I touched yer nut 'cos don't yer remember
me a-standin on yer arms?'</p>

<p>'Ef yer want an eye bunged up or a punch on the snaht&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well ef I'm a liar yo're the biggest. So yer lumps it. I'm goin
to be blowed ef I play wiv a lahsy blisterin blitherin blinkin
blightin bloomin bleedin blasted barstard wot's got a mower wot's
got a bloke wot's&mdash;'</p>

<p>''Ere, d' ye want a clip on the Kiber-pass?'</p>

<p>'Garn! Piss up yer leg, an play wiv the steam.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Girls' Games</h2>

<p>Girls' games? Bless you, dozens of them.</p>

<p>They play sports together with the boys: ball-games like
ROUNDERS (' FOUR CORNERS ') and HEAD GAME and DAGGLES and BROKEN
BOTTLE (yes; BROKEN BOTTLE is a ball-game, and is also called
PASSING ROUND) and THREE CATCHES OUT and ROTTEN EGG (or CRACKED
EGG) and A AND B, where they have to stand in four rings marked in
chalk on the pavement; and some without balls such as FOOL, FOOL,
COME TO SCHOOL (rather like DUNCE, DUNCE, DOUBLE D.) and
WINKLE-SHELLS and HARK THE ROBBERS COMING THROUGH&mdash;an old catch
game&mdash;and STEPS, and SLY FOX, and LET GO MUST GO (a wall game) and
HONEY-POTS.</p>

<p>HONEY-POTS is very respectable, but a little old-fashioned. Aunt
Eliza says she used to play it, and I can quite believe that. I can
just see her playing HONEY-POTS.</p>

<p>PLEASE WE'VE COME TO LEARN A TRADE (also called GUESSING WORDS
or DUMB MOTIONS)&mdash;another game for boys and girls. There are two
parties, one on each side of the street. One of them has to think
of a trade, such as picking hops, for instance; then they take the
first letters, P. and H., and go over to the others and say' We
have come to work a trade.' When the others ask, 'What's your
trade?' they must answer 'P. H.', and pretend to be picking hops
with their hands. If the others guess what trade they mean, they
must shout it out and chase them across the street; and if they
catch one of them&mdash;why, then they, the hop-pickers, must do the
guessing instead. CATCH-IN-THE-ROPE is also for boys and girls, and
so is PUSSY CAT, and so is STATUES. There are UGLY STATUES and
PRETTY STATUES. When you play this game you have to line yourselves
up against a wall or a house; then the judge comes along and pulls
one of you forwards and in that moment you have to make a posture
and a face, sometimes pretty but mostly ugly, and pretend to be a
statue. It spoils everything if you laugh over this game, as you
may understand from this description:&mdash;</p>

<p>'A lot of players stand on a form. One person in front; tells
the person to form a statue if she move or laugh she is hee&mdash;'</p>

<p>Another of them is HERE WE GO UP THE MULBERRY TREE, where they
form two parties who challenge each other and try to pull each
other across the street. And they have handkerchief games together
such as I SENT A LETTER TO MY LOVE ('and on the way I dropped it',
a decent game for boys and girls, also called LOST LETTER; and if
you haven't got a handkerchief, which you generally haven't, you
can take any old rag); and NICK NACK TOLLY WHACK, which is rather
rough and goes like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Pick up for sides and one side says nick nack tolly wack. Then
if the other side does not move they rush and each one has to have
a wack with the tolly wack (a handkerchief with a knot in it).'</p>

<p>There are several more of these games for boys and girls&mdash;such
as LOOKING GLASS and GOOSE-GANDER and SNOW-WHITE (where they go on
hands and knees and get very dirty) and PET POST&mdash;but not as many
as there might be, because they don't play together as much as they
might...</p>

<p>Then the girls have games to themselves: ball-games like
MACKINTOSH, and BASKET-BALL, and CROSS-BALL, and EMPEROR BALL, and
CENTRE BALL, and CORNER CATCH BALL, and CIRCLE STRIDE BALL, and
HAND BALL, and ONE IN THE MIDDLE, and QUEEN MAB (a ball-hiding
game, also called QUEEN ANNE); and hand-clapping games such as
ONE-TWO-THREE and ORANGES, ORANGES, FOUR A PENNY, and TWISTERS AND
CLAPS; and ring games like UP TO THE KING, and RUNNING IN AND OUT
THE BLUEBELLS, and FIRE, and WALKING ROUND THE VILLAGE, and THIEF,
PRINCE, KING, QUEEN, BEGGAR, and THROWING THE BEAN-BAGS, and PRETTY
AND UGLY&mdash;where one girl stands in the centre of the ring and picks
out another one who has to make a face, and if she's satisfied with
the face, she allows her to stand in the centre instead.</p>

<p>Other girls' games are MOTHER I'M OVER THE WATER and Box NUTS
and VICTORIA and TURNING MOTHER'S WRINGER and WE THREE KINGS and
JOHN BROWN'S KNAPSACK and FILLING (or PUSHING THROUGH) THE GAP and
WHEN I WAS A SCHOOLGIRL and BREAD AND BUTTER (shuttlecock game) and
COME TO SEE POOR MARY and WE ARE ROMANS (two parties of girls) and
WHAT IS IT and WHO KNOWS and HOW, WHEN AND WHERE and HEAD AND
SHOULDERS and BEAST, BIRD, FISH, FLOWER and POLLY GOES TO BED and
POOR POLLY CAN'T SEE and TAG and RAILWAY RACE and ON THE MOUNTAIN
and HOOK AND EYE and EGG IN THE SPOON and HAWK AND DOVE and BORROW
A LIGHT and PEASE CODS and GOLDEN GOOSE and TREACLE PUDDING and
WHO's AFRAID OF BLACK PETER and JENNY PLUCK PEARS and
WALKING-STICKS and LOOKING FOR MOTHER'S THIMBLE and TIME and
LADYSMITH and PUSHY BACK and PASS OVER and WE ARE BRITISH SOLDIERS
and L. S. D. and the WHITE SHIRT. THE WHITE SHIRT is an old ghost
game, played like this:</p>

<p>'You have a lot of girls standing against a wall, one of them
being the mother of the others. She tells them to go and see if
father's shirt's dry (the shirt being a girl in white, standing at
a distance). They go in turn to see if it is dry &amp; each time
the "ghost" in father's shirt catches one. At last the mother alone
is left, she goes and is caught; then another "shirt" is picked,
and so the game goes on.'</p>

<p>I wonder whether Aunt Eliza ever played THE WHITE SHIRT?&mdash;and
MERRY MONTH OF MAY and CON-STANT-I-NO-PLE and BLACK AND BLUE and
FOLLOW YOUR MOTHER TO MARKET and PUSS and MY SISTER JANE and TWO
LITTLE PEOPLE WENT OUT ONE DAY (' As they went out they were heard
to say') and OLD DEVIL IN FIRE (or LIGHT MOTHER'S COPPER FIRE),
which is played so: 'About one dozen girls can play. They select
one who has to be the devil, she's to stand against a wall, with a
girl hid behind her. All the children have to try and light the
fire, and each time the girl behind pinches them and they say " Oh,
mother, the devil's in fire." Then the mother tries to light the
fire and the devil chases them, and the one who is caught has to
become devil, next time.'</p>

<p>It's perfectly certain Aunt Eliza never played OLD DEVIL.</p>

<p>And other girls' games are JACOB AND RACHEL (where two of them
have to chase each other blindfolded) and BUSHEL BASKET and MRS.
BROWN and WOODEN LEG and ROLLING PIN (two parties of girls who
decide which of them has to chase the other by the red or blue
colour marked on a rolling pin which is rolled between them) and
PORK AND GREENS&mdash;</p>

<p>'One player asks a question and the next says pork and greens.
If she says anything else she is out&mdash;'</p>

<p>and TWO'S AND THREE'S&mdash;</p>

<p>'A double ring is formed. Then two children are out, they chase
each other &amp; one runs in front of a child then the back one is
hee&mdash;' and BUZZ&mdash;</p>

<p>'One player counts one then the next says two and so on. Every 5
the player instead says buzz&mdash;'</p>

<p>and PARSON'S CAT&mdash;</p>

<p>'Children sit down in a ring and begin saying something about
the cat such as Abomnerble Cat. Then B, such as Bloody Cat and so
on.'</p>

<p>I SPY WITH ONE EYE and BLACK IN TOPPER and LOOKING THROUGH THE
KEY-HOLE and PEEPING BEHIND THE CURTAIN are hiding games for girls.
For SWINGS you need a lamp-post and a piece of rope; it's not
exactly a game, but you can spend a nice Sunday afternoon over it,
if there are no coppernobs about. In POLLY TELL ME THE TIME they
wind a skipping-rope round a girl's waist a certain number of
times, and then un-wind her.</p>

<p>And that reminds me that some of the best girls' games are with
skipping ropes.</p>

<p>They have SWING-SWONG, and DOUBLE DUTCH, and AMERICAN JUMP, and
HIGHER AND HIGHER, and RUN AND SKIP, and HOOP AND SKIP, and INNERS
AND OUTERS, and TOUCH TAIL, and NEBUCHADNEZZAR, and HIGH WATER, and
NEVER LEAVE THE ROPE EMPTY, and OVER THE MOON, and ONE-TWO, and
TIPPERARY (new), and ONE AND OUT, and SNAKES, and BIG BEN STRIKES
ONE, and WHAT O SHE BUMPS (a new one), and ALL IN THE ROPE, and
FOLLOW THE LEADER (yes; a skipping game), and FULL-STOP, and
COLOURS, and HAREM SKIRT, and NAUGHTY GIRL, and THROWING UP GIRLS,
and CATCH IN THE LONG ROPE, and EIGHTS, and DIFFICULTY, and THREE
BETWEEN, and THREE AND ALL ON and SITTING ON THE STAR, MARY and I
AM A LITTLE SHADOW and ROCK THE CRADLE and GIRLS' NAMES, and BOYS'
NAMES, and goodness only knows how many more...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Games with Songs</h2>

<p>Some of the hand-clapping and ring and skipping games&mdash;most of
them, in fact, and other ones too, in which the boys used to
join&mdash;have songs that go with them; BOYS' NAMES, for instance,
begins like this:</p>

<p class="poem">Black-currant&mdash;red-currant&mdash;raspberry tart:<br>
Tell me the name of your sweetheart,</p>

<p>and then they begin with A, B, C, and all through the alphabet,
a skip with each letter; and when they have found the sweetheart's
name they have to discover when they are to be married, and how
many rings, and how many brooches, and in what clothes, and in what
carriage, and how many kisses, and in what house they will live,
and how many children&mdash;all in the same alphabetical manner; so
that, if this game were ever properly finished, it would take at
least a month's hard skipping. Others of them end either with the
numbers 1, 2, 3, etc.; or with penny, tuppence, threepence, etc.;
or with the things in the cruet-stand (salt, mustard, vinegar,
pepper); or with the days of the week, or the months of the
year.</p>

<p>Here are a few of these chants: (Not all of them are sung to
games.)&mdash;</p>

<p>I had a dolly dressed in green,<br>
I didn't like her&mdash;I gave her to the Queen&mdash;<br>
The Queen didn't like her&mdash;she gave her to the cat&mdash;<br>
The cat didn't like her, because she wasn't fat.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Dancing Dolly had no sense,<br>
She bought a fiddle for eighteen pence&mdash;<br>
And all the tune that she could play<br>
Was 'Over the hills and far away'<br>
(Or: 'Sally get out of the donkey's way'.)<br>
(Or: 'Take my dolly and fire away'.)</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Eaper Weaper, chimbley-sweeper,<br>
Had a wife but couldn't keep her,<br>

<p>You can get as many of these songs out of the girls as you like,
if you care to come round and ask for them; you'll find the girls
far less shy about their games than the boys are. And you'll also
notice that they're just as good at inventing sports&mdash;the boys show
up best in the duty games, and the girls in their songs. But there
's this difference. You'll not find much talk in these songs about
sunshine and flowers and things like that&mdash;except in the older ones
which I think were used by girls and boys together, and perhaps
even by grown-ups. The girls don't discover poetic things like
'Swimming in Blue Water' or 'Dead Man's Dark Scenery'; they're
matter-of-fact; they sing about clothes and food and money. That's
what makes Aunt Eliza say that women have more common sense than
men...</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Games for Smaller Girls and
Boys</h2>

<p>Then the smaller girls and boys have a number of games together:
MOTHERS AND FATHERS, for instance, and TEACHERS, and SCHOOLS, and
SOLDIERS, and NURSES, and HOSPITALS, and CARTS AND HORSES, and
SHOPS, and CONVICTS AND WARDERS, and RAILWAY STATIONS, and games of
that kind; and OLD DADDY WITCHES (also called POLLY WITCH or GRANNY
WITCH) and SLEIGHS and I BOUGHT A DONKEY and I BOUGHT A PENNY DOLL
and FIRE ENGINES and FROGS and WAR and CAT AND MOUSE and CAT AND
DOG and HERE WE GO ROUND THE MULBERRY BUSH and A.B.C.D.F.G.&mdash;WHAT
HAVE I LEFT OUT?&mdash;</p>

<p>'one silly kid says E., and then all the others says you're
<i>it</i>!' namely 'he' (E.)&mdash;</p>

<p>and JACK HORNER and OLD AUNT SALLY and Tip-Top is A SWEETS STORE
and TOM TIDDLER. You know TOM TIDDLER, of course:</p>

<p>'I'm on old Tom Tiddler's ground, Picking up gold and
silver&mdash;'?</p>

<p>There is also another game of this kind where they sort
themselves into two parties called ORANGES AND LEMONS to the song
of</p>

<p>Oranges and Lemons<br>
Bells of Saint Clement's&mdash;</p>

<p>Everybody knows that! In fact, children are not particular what
they play at&mdash;</p>

<p>'I Can Play at Whipping top also i Play Hoopla. And i Play at
Darts. And have a game at horses. And i Play at hide and seek and i
play with Cherry stones. And i Play at skiping rope and Jumping
over the rope. And i like a game of Boxing and i like a game of
foot Ball and i like a game of Cricket. And i like a game of
rounders and i Play a Game of Blow Cards and i play Pigy Backs and
i play at Going up on your hands against the wall, i Play at racing
i Play Drawfs i Play with my hoop and Stick i Play at
Soldiers...'</p>

<p>And other children's sports are MARY, MARY and WEEK DAYS (a
ball-game played by eight of them) and another one called SHEEP,
SHEEP COME HOME, where one line of children represents the sheep,
and another line the wolves; and behind the wolves stands the
sheep's mother &mdash;many of these games are'mother-games'&mdash;who calls
the sheep; but as they run to her they are caught by the wolves. It
goes like this:</p>

<p>'Sheep Sheep come home,<br>
Afraid. What off. The Wolfs.<br>
Wolfs gone to Devonshire<br>
Wont be home for seven year<br>
Sheep Sheep come home&mdash;'</p>

<p>and DAN, DAN THREAD YOUR NEEDLE and WILL YOU GIVE us BREAD AND

<p>and</p>

<p>GRANDMOTHER, GRANDMOTHER GRAY,<br>
May I go out to play?<br>
I won't go near the water<br>

<p>and</p>

<p>MOTHER MAY I GO OUT?<br>

<p>and TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR (ring-game) and MATCH and
RING-A-RING O' ROSES and CHERRY-OGS (or CHERRY-BOBS) and
CHERRY-PIES.</p>

<p>That reminds me that the last two must not be mixed up with
CHERRY-BOB ARCH, a gambling game for bigger lads, quite simple but
rather risky, played with cherry-stones and the lid of an old
wooden box in which spaces and numbers have been marked out. You
throw and&mdash;well, you must ask some of the boys higher up the
street...</p>

<hr>

<p>Now small children don't invent games (it's the older ones who
do that) and so they carry on a good few which used to be played
long ago and which the others don't care for any more. That
accounts for the queer sports you see among the kids. One of them
is KING OF THE BARBARY, where one party captures a 'castle' made of
the other children holding their hands together. Another is GREEN
MAN RISE-O, a very old game; it goes like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>'A boy has to get don and put some gass [grass] over him and run
out and call out geren man rays and he got to fine [find]
you&mdash;'</p>

<p>Perhaps this is clearer:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The way we play the game of greenman one of us lay down and
cover his self with grass and the others run out and hide then they
say greenman greenman rise up then he gets up and trys to catch
them and the last one thats cort goes it&mdash;'</p>

<p>For GREEN MAN RISE-O you have to go to the park, nowadays; but
if you can't go to the park, and want to play it in the street,
this is how you do:&mdash;</p>

<p>'A boy as got to lay down and all the others have to put thier
coats on him and then they have to say green man rise up and if he
see a boy he as got to say one, two, three, and the last one as to
go it&mdash;'</p>

<p>&mdash;in fact, it becomes like DEAD MAN'S RISE, for lack of
grass.</p>

<p>In COCK ROBIN IS DEAD all the children who are playing have to
arm themselves with shields (for which they use saucepan-lids) and
with bows and arrows; and some of the bows are worth looking
at&mdash;made of string, they are, and half a barrel-hoop or a whalebone
out of their big sister's stays&mdash;if she wears any. Another of these
sports is an old witch-game called TO BECKLES TO BECKLES (? Beccles
in Suffolk). It is played like this:</p>

<p>'The children form a ring, and two in the middle. One is a witch
and the other is a girl. The children dance round once. Then the
girl in the ring says, "To Beckles to Beckles to get some wood."
Old witch says: "What for." Girl: "To boil the pot." Witch: "What
for." Girl: "To cook the fowl." Witch: "Where did you get it?"
Girl: "From your yard." At this a race ensues, until the girl is
caught by the witch.'</p>

<p>GROTTOES&mdash;May sport&mdash;are built heart-shaped or square or round,
with an edge of grass (if you can get it) filled up with
picture-cards and oyster-shells and old scent bottles or anything
else that looks pretty. It's just a dodge for mumping halfpennies;
and not a bad one either. They come up to you and say 'Remember the
grotto '&mdash;meaning Pay up. Speaking for myself, I gener-ally forget
the grotto&mdash;meaning Go to blazes. But some people pay up, and I
once saw Mr. Perkins give them sixpence! He was a bit all right,
that evening&mdash;must have been...</p>

<p>By far the best children's games are those played with mud. Of
mud you make PIES, and BRIDGES, and STICKING-BRICKS (against a
wall), and MUD-CARTS (played with a tin-can), and WELLS, and
TUNNELS, and FLOWER-POTS, and CASTLES&mdash;in fact, anything you
please. There's nothing like mud, when all is said and done, and
it's a perfect shame there isn't more mud about, nowadays; or sand,
at least. You should see them go for it, when the streets are up.
Because the park is too far away for most of them. And then, the
fact of the matter is, our boys don't much like playing in the
park, anyhow; and the few who care about it aren't allowed to go,
because their mothers say 'You've got no clothes.' They prefer the
streets; and that's the truth, though you wouldn't believe it. I
can't stop to tell you why. For one thing, the keeper is always
coming up in the park and interfering; next, they can't find kerbs
and paving-stones there; next, it makes them wild to see other boys
with bats and things, when they have none...</p>

<p>Some of these games used to come in at fixed seasons, as TOPS
and MARBLES and PICTURES and BUTTONS still do; they came regularly,
like the ice-cream jack or the lavender-boy or the rate-collector
or the measles or the hoky-poky man or the carol-singers. But
things are changing. SKIPPING used to begin on Good Friday, and now
they skip half the year round; HOOPS used to come in at Christmas
sharp, and here they are already. Danged if I know the reason why.
But there it is. GROTTOES ought to be played on St. James' day, and
I've seen them in mid-winter. The same with these MUD-PIES. You
would think they belonged naturally to the wet season. Not a bit of
it! Not nowadays, at all events. If their clay is too dry in
summer, they manage to make it moist again, even without waiting
for the rain. Unseasonable, I call it...</p>

<p>What I said about paving-stones reminds me of MARBLES. We used
to play them in the winter, on the pavement. But marlies are going
down in the world, that's certain. It's a good while since I
played, but I still remember the names of a few kinds&mdash;Toms, and
Alleys, and Glarnies, and Miggies; and Forty-eighter and
Twenty-fourer and Twelver and Sixer and Fourer and Three-er. You
hardly ever hear of a Forty-eighter nowadays. The smaller stone
marbles were called Tich; those you got out of lemonade bottles
were Glass-eye; they also had names, which I 've forgotten,
according to the different coloured marks. We used to play at NOCKS
(that is, KNUCKS: because your knuckles had to touch the ground),
and MARBLE-BOARD, and SKITTLES, and GLASGOW, and THREE HOLES, and
NIXY's IN THE HOLE: I TAKE, and GUTTER MARBLES, and ROW MARBLES,
and UP THE ALLEY, and SPICK AND SPAN, and DOB 'EM, and TIP, and
FOUR HOLES, and NEAREST THE WALL, and PICKING THE PLUMS, and GOING
UP, and BOWLING IN THE HOLE and HIT IT LEAVE IT and HIT IT HAVE IT
and THROWINGS OUT and STAYS and HITS AND SPANS and FIVE TEN and
PICKING NUMBERS and BAGATELLE and IN THE RING and PITCHING and
FOLLOW ON and KILLING and PORKY and THROW THE FARTHEST and SOME OR
NONE and BRIDGE-BOARD. BRIDGE-BOARD was played with a diagram
looking like a row of railway arches; and I might explain the game
if I could draw diagrams, which I can't. In BOUNCE EYE each player
gave a certain number of marbles which were pooled in a ring. Then
one of them held a marble to his eye and dropped it among them; if
any others were knocked out of the ring he kept them; if none, his
own marble went into the pool. There used also to be games that you
played with marbles in a flat iron ring&mdash;the rings cost 2d. if you
bought them, but you generally got them off the barges for
nothing&mdash;games like RINGUMS and CHIPPING OUT OF THE RING.</p>

<p>But, as I was saying, marbles are not played as they used to be.
The police are getting more interfering every day; they tell the
boys to move on and not block up the pavement, and that interrupts
them in the middle of a game and makes them half wild; and if you
don't clear off at once, they kick your marbles into the gutter
where they get lost down a drain, and that makes you alto-gether
mad. Aunt Eliza explains things by saying that marble-games wear
out boys' clothes at the knees and that mothers are growing to
be'more careful in such matters'. More fussy, I call it. And then
she says that marbles&mdash;and I say it all comes from wasting her time
running all over the place in a feather hat and silk garters, ever
since she came in for that little bit and left off trying to be
school-mistress, and messing about the way she has done with
children's homes and a lot of old cranks, instead of doing some
honest work at home&mdash;she says that marbles, and not only marbles
but HOOPS, used to be played by the big boys at the public
schools.</p>

<p>Hoops: that's what she says. And I say: hoops be blowed. With
all respect to Aunt Eliza, I might have swallowed marbles, but I
can't swallow hoops; not on this side of the year after next. I
know this, at least, that if a big lad were seen playing, or ever
had been seen playing with a hoop, down our way, except, perhaps,
an iron one&mdash;why, his own parents wouldn't know him again, when he
got home, if he ever did, which I rather doubt. But that's neither
here nor there, except in so far as it shows what Aunt Eliza's
explanations are worth. Mr. Perkins, of Framlingham Brothers (a
good old firm&mdash;and a nice place he's got, too)&mdash;he's an
understandable kind of gentleman and he gets talking about things
after his second pint of Burton and he says, speaking of marbles,
that he's noticed the same thing as I have. And when I asked him
<i>why</i> marbles are going out of fashion, he says:</p>

<p>'Marbles are going out of fashion,' he says, 'because they're
getting unpopular. That's why. And I happen to know this,' says he,
'because our little Percy he tells me that shopmen don't stock them
the way they did because they know that boys don't ask for them the
way they did and boys don't ask for them the way they did because
they know they couldn't get them the way they did because shopmen
don't stock them the way they did. Which proves what I said. Trust
me,' says he, 'when things begin to lose their popularity, they are
sure to become unfashionable sooner or later, whether it be games,
or clothes, or drinks, <i>or</i> religions. For instance', says he,
'take Nonconformity'. But I wasn't taking Nonconformity just then,
and when I tried to keep him to the point, and asked why marlies,
and just marlies, were getting unpopular, he scratches his chin
which hadn't been shaved for the inside of a week, and has another
go at his tankard, and puts it down with a bit of a bang,
emphatic-like&mdash;a sure sign, with Mr. Perkins&mdash;and then he looks at
me and says:</p>

<p>'Marbles are getting unpopular,' says he, 'because they're going
out of fashion. That's what's the matter with marbles and with a
good many other things as well. Take Nonconformity', and when I
told him I was only taking bitter that night, he has another pull
at his Burton, and at last he says, casual-fashion:</p>

<p>'Marbles are not stimulating enough for modern life. It's the
same with religions, <i>don't you see</i>? Now take Nonconformity
'&mdash;and God's truth! I had to take Nonconformity for the better part
of an hour, after all.</p>

<hr>

<p>But Mr. Perking hit the nail on the head, all the same. For I
feel sure that boys need more excitement than they did. Or perhaps
I ought to say they want it. That's it: they just want it. And
thinking it over, I believe the cinematograph is to blame: it makes
them want more excitement, and then it gives it them; and then it
makes them want still more, and then it gives them still more;
quite restless, in fact, it makes them, and I shouldn't be
surprised if sooner or later it weren't responsible for a new kind
of boy altogether. And that would mean the end of a number of these
old games. Because nowadays the bigger lads, those who used to do
most of the inventing&mdash;they prefer to go to picture-shows whenever
they get a chance, instead of larking about the streets as they
used to do. (They get some games out of the cinematograph, by the
way, such as COWBOYS-INDIANS, which has lately been re-christened
GERMANS-ENGLISH.) So the playing-age is growing to be younger and
younger, and these small boys are not so good at discovering fresh
sports; it's quite true they do make up new ones every day, but I
think, on the whole, they forget more than they ought to remember;
and this is the reason, if you really want to know, why I'm making
up this catalogue: to see whether the next lot of children knows
anything about these sports, or even their names.</p>

<p>The 'organized games' they make them play in the parks
nowadays&mdash;they work in the same direction; so does the regular
county council schooling; so does the scout movement. The fact is,
boys are not left to themselves the way they used to be; everybody
goes fussing about and telling them to do this and that, when they
want to be doing something else&mdash;something of their own; that's why
many games are being forgotten. I don't know a single boy who
really cares for 'organized games' the way a man does; even Aunt
Eliza can't bring herself to believe in the system over-much,
though she likes to think it keeps the youngsters out of mischief.
And it all comes from thinking that boys think the same as we
think&mdash;which they don't; or ought to learn to think the same as we
think&mdash;which they oughtn't. Because the right kind of boy thinks
differently from the right kind of man about games and everything
else. And so he ought.</p>

<p>To prove that they still can invent, you need only watch them at
their picture-games&mdash;played with cigarette-cards and all of them,
of course, absolutely new, seeing that these cards were quite
unknown up to a few years ago. These picture-games have helped to
do away with marbles, for two reasons: firstly, the boys are keener
on them because they're more exciting; and secondly, they're
cheaper. You have to pay for marbles. But you don't pay for
fag-pictures: you mump them, see? And here the difference between
our games and those of richer people comes in. The more expensive
their games are, the more they Like to play them; they don't seem
to care about sports that are played with nothing at all&mdash;the
dearness is what makes everybody want to go in for them; whereas
with our boys a game can only be played if it's cheap, and if it
costs nothing at all&mdash;why, then it becomes really popular, or
fashionable&mdash;as the case may be. Now fag-cards are cheap, and no
mistake. That's why you can play so many games with them&mdash;EGGS IN
THE BUSH, and SNAP, and BANKER (or BANK), and NEAREST THE WALL
TAKES, and NEAREST THE WALL SPINS UP, and SEVENS (quite a new
kind), and SCALING UP THE RING, and SCALING UP THE LINE, and UNDER
THE HAT, and GETTING IN THE RING (that's a paving-flag, and the
game is also called IN THE SQUARE), and OVER-LAPPINGS, and IN THE
RING FARTHEST, and POKE IN THE HOLE, and DROP THEM (or DROPS), and
SKATE THEM, and PICTURE OR BLANK, and WALLIE (or UP THE WALL), and
PITCHING IN THE BLOCK (or PITCHER), and PITCHING UNDER, and
SLAP-DAP, and SCRAPINGS, and TIPPING IN THE HOLE, and BLOWINGS
(also called BLOWS or BLOWUMS: you need an outside window-sill for
this), and TOUCH-CARD, and GETTING-ON, and INNERS AND OUTERS, and
THUMBS, and SHOWS-UP, and KNOCK 'EM DOWN, and DICINGS, and
WATERFALLS (or SNOW-FALLS) and SPANS (or SPANNERS)&mdash;there's thirty
of them, anyhow.</p>

<p>There's this to be said for picture-games: they make the boys
uncommonly nimble with their hands and ringers, and this must help
them later on, if they go in for certain trades like watch-making.
In fact, they require real skill; as I found out the other day when
they asked me to play BANKER (just for a lark, they said) and got
five coppers out of me in about half as many minutes. No, I've
nothing against picture-games except that their names are not as
good as those of the duty sports and that they don't give the
youngsters any chance of running about and using their legs. And
also this: they're really horrible inducements to
gambling&mdash;especially BANKER. Now I don't like even talking about
gambling, because it's forbidden by law, and everybody knows it.
And yet, only yesterday I noticed a lot of them at it; evi-dently
at it. I could see they were up to mischief, by the way they
cleared. Dam funny it was&mdash;how they just melted into nothing,
before I could get a proper sight of them. Not our boys, I'm glad
to say.</p>

<p>They're so keen on these picture-games that you can see them
playing at half-past six in the morning and after nine at night;
and in the rain, too; and when they have no fag-pictures they try
to play the same games with bus-tickets and then, if you're not
very careful, you can hear some shocking bad swear-words which they
pick up I can't think where, because the bus-tickets bend too
easily and won't fly as they should.</p>

<p>And that reminds me of some other games of the smaller
children&mdash;those played with five stones (boys) or gobs and bonsers
(girls). Gobs (cobs) are shaped like dice, or ought to be; and a
bonser or bonk or buck or bonster is a large marble that bounces
from the ground (bouncer), about the size of a forty-eighter. You
can buy four gobs and a bonk for a half-penny; you can also make
them yourself&mdash;the gobs or stones, I mean&mdash;out of bits of porcelain
and pebbles and winkle-shells; but the bought ones are the best,
because, for one reason, you have to pay for them.</p>

<p>With these things you play BUCK AND FOUR of different kinds,
such as TELLINGS and SISTER and STAND UP JACK. For BASKETS you need
a diagram on the pavement, which I can't draw. Other games of this
sort are ALLEY GOBS and CHANGES and PICKSES and STANDSES&mdash;</p>

<p>'In standses aim the marble up then as the marble is coming down
stand one of the stones up till you stand all the four up then you
drop them again&mdash;'</p>

<p>and SHUFFLES and FULL-STOP AND COMMA and FLY DOBS and BABES IN
THE WELL and ONE STAND UP ONES'ES&mdash;</p>

<p>'if one gob stands up when thrown out, the process of ones'es
must be taken. After this you must get two to stand up [on their
sides, of course], then three and so in the right order '&mdash;</p>

<p>and OVER THE WALL ONE TWO THREE and SPANS and LONDON
BRIDGE&mdash;</p>

<p>'the bonk is thrown up and while it is descending the two in the
middle are caught up, but the bonk must be caught with both stones
in the middle then the two stones outside are caught up making a
total of three in the hand' (not very clear, is it?)&mdash;</p>

<p>and BABES IN BED and PIGEON-HOLE and CROW'S NEST and
LAMP-POST&mdash;</p>

<p>'build up four stones, throw up the bonk so that it knocks down
one of them; and so on till only one stone is left. Then throw up
the bonk and catch it in your hand together with the four stones
that are on the ground; if you miss one, you're out'&mdash;</p>

<p>and TWOS AND THREES and FOURS and FIVERS and FIVES SIX TIMES and
SAVING BABY'S LIFE&mdash;</p>

<p>'The way to play Saving Babies life is like this. First of all
you pick out a stone which will be the bonk, then lay the remaining
four on the left hand, and then by hitting the hand which holds the
stones one of them flies into the air, then when it comes down the
player must catch it or else he is out. When all the stones have
been caught in this way they are laid on the hand in two's, then in
three's, and when that is done all the four are caught, but this
time the bonk must be picked up while the others are coming
down.'</p>

<p>It takes some doing, this game; and it isn't worth doing when
you can do it.</p>

<p>Now proper boys won't touch a marble that bounces from the
ground&mdash;I can't tell you why, but there it is; so they generally
use a fifth stone instead of a bonk, as in this last game, which is
the boys' way of 'Saving Baby's Life '. But most of them don't care
about these things anyhow, and I don't either; rotten games, I call
them, fit for silly little girls and only interesting because
they're a sort of half-way (the old FIVE-STONES, for instance, is
played both with common stones and with gobs) between marbles which
they can't manufacture at any price and real stones which you just
pick up anywhere.</p>

<p>Talking of real stones, there's no doubt whatever that games
played with them are the oldest in the world, together with the
mud-larks&mdash;excepting perhaps those that are not played with
<i>things</i> at all, like hide-and-seek and some of the old 'he'
games. And it's just wonderful what you can do with stones. But
they are dying out, all the same; because the worst of it is, there
are not half enough stones about, nowadays; not half enough. You
can play DUMPING (or DUMPLING) with stones, and BUNG (also called
GO-GULLEY) and NIP (also called TAP or LEG-ALONG&mdash;where you hit
each other's stones, each hit counting ten) and DUCK; and you can
tell from these names how old the games are. Stones for
LEG-ALONG&mdash;stones of the right kind, of proper shape and weight,
flat on both sides and fitting nicely into the hand, are hard to
come by and carefully kept. DUCK (or DUCK ON) goes like this:</p>

<p>'About eight or nine can play; you make a hole in the ground and
Duck puts his stone before it, then the Others come up close and
have to knock his one into the hole with theirs; if they miss they
must pick up there stones and run back to the Curb before he can
catch his One; if he catch him, that man is Duck instead.'</p>

<p>Other stone-games are FRENCH PACKET and SHUFFING THE MONEY and
FIVE-TEN and HESLING and TWO AND THREE HOLES and KNOCKING THREE'S
and PENNY-TUPPENCE and COCK-SHIES and STONE CHASE and THROWINGS OUT
and RINGING THE STONE and PUDDING.</p>

<p>Have you ever played DUCKING MUMMY? Probably not. But it's a
good old stone-game for small boys. Two of them take a stone each,
and with these stones they aim at a third stone. The third
stone&mdash;that's Mummy. If one of them hits Mummy, he keeps on
throwing till he misses; then the other has a turn at it; and so
on. In the end they are supposed to count up who has made most
hits&mdash;the loser paying a peppermint. Of course they try to cheat
each other, and so it always ends in a free fight: that's the best
part of the whole game. Nobody ever gets the peppermint.</p>

<p>But they sometimes gets a black eye...</p>

<p>And that's about all the games I can think of, just now.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chalk Games</h2>

<p>Wait a bit. There are the chalk-games. These are what you see
marked out in white or coloured chalk on the pavement or
asphalt&mdash;summer games, of course, and pretty common everywhere.
Ordinary HOP-SCOTCH, for instance, and LONG HOP-SCOTCH, and FRENCH
HOP-SCOTCH, and TIDDLEDEWINK, and PUDDING AND BEEP (or STONE
HOP-SCOTCH, where you have to keep a stone balanced on your head or
open hand as you hop through). Then there's WRIGGLY-WORM (also
called WHIRLY-WHIRLY, or WIGGLY-WOGGLY, or SNAIL), and SQUARES, and
NUMBERS, and DOT-BOXES (or DOTS) and ALL OVER THE WORLD, and
STEPPING-STONES, and ZIG-ZAG. They play NOUGHTS AND CROSSES out of
doors (OXEN-CROSSES, they call it; which shows how they twist the
names about); other chalk-games are MAPS, and LONDON, and
BATTLEMENTS, and SNAKES, and BABY, and BILL BAILY.</p>

<p>They also play BODY-BUILDING of different kinds, and one of the
most complicated of these chalk-games is now called
GERMANS-ENGLISH. It begins with a design shaped rather like a
coffin with fields of squares in the middle and a field of them
running along each side, and a field for 'lost' at the top and
another field at the bottom which I don't remember the use of, and
two starting-points at each end of the bottom. Only two boys can
play; they throw their nickers by turns into the middle fields, and
if they land on a line it counts nothing, but whoever lands in a
field can begin building a soldier in the corresponding side-field;
first his head; then (for another throw into the right field) his
body; then (for another) his legs; then his rifle; then a bullet at
the end of his rifle. Once the bullet is there, that soldier stands
for good. But while he is still being built, the other boy, if he
throws well, can set up another soldier in the corre-sponding
side-field in shorter time, and once that soldier has his
bullet&mdash;why, he can shoot the other fellow oppo-site, if he's not
complete, and finish him off for good. So there are all the time
soldiers building in the different side-fields on both sides, each
growing up as fast as he can, and all shooting each other whenever
they get the chance; and the winner is the boy who has most
soldiers alive at the end. And you can see from this that it's a
complicated business and shows what youngsters can think out with a
bit of chalk (if somebody didn't think it out for them); but to
explain it properly would require at least twenty diagrams to show
the game in its different stages, and I can't draw diagrams&mdash;never
could; which is a pity.</p>

<p>The small children have a chalk-game all to themselves called
POLLY POLLY WHAT's THE TIME, where they draw a sort of clock on the
pavement and cover up parts of it with their jackets or anything
else.</p>

<p>The girls have another, BOOTS, SHOES, TIPS, OR NAILS, in which
one of them draws a square on the pavement containing room for the
four letters b. t. s. or n.; she writes one of them down and then
covers it up; the others must guess which letter it is, and they
score up how many correct guesses each one has had. Boys some-times
play this, but not often.</p>

<p>And then the well-known CHALK-CHASE. There are different kinds
of CHALK-CHASE, such as CONVICTS AND WARDERS (or TRACKING THE
CONVICTS) and SCOUTS; but the real old CHALK-CHASE, as played by my
friends of the 'Char-charcoal-chalk-chase-club', goes like
this:&mdash;</p>

<p>'You pick parteis and then they clip for First outing. Each
player has a piece of chalk which he has to draw arroes the hounds
follow &amp; they must cross out the arroes until the Others are
caught then its the Others turn'.</p>

<p>Played it yourself, maybe?</p>

<p>And there! I nearly forgot some of the best of all these sports:
the touch games. There's OFF-GROUND TOUCH and FRENCH TOUCH and
TOUCH THE ROAD YOU MUST GO OVER and CROSS TOUCH and HE (called EE;
all touch-games are 'he' games, and this is the grandfather of the
whole family), and ELBOW TOUCH and HELP TOUCH and B&mdash;TOUCH and
TOUCHING BOOTLEATHER and HOP TOUCH and DOUBLE TOUCH and TOUCH LAST
(or HAD You LAST) and TOUCHING IRON and TOUCH WOOD AND WHISTLE and
NON-STOP TOUCH and STICK-TOUCH, or STICK-HE (touching with sticks)
and WATER-HE (played in the baths) and STRING-HE (touch and hold
hands: like WIDDY) and TREE-HE (up trees) and SHADOW-HE, which must
be played in the sunshine, like this:</p>

<p>'The one who is he has to try and tread on one of the person's
shadders, then he is he.'</p>

<p>FRENCH TOUCH is as good as any of those I can remember just now;
it is played like this:</p>

<p>'Fr tutch run after another boy and tutch him any were and the
boy you tutched has to keep his hand on the place were you tutched
and go ea (' he') and run after another boy and tutch him any were
and he has to keep his hand on the place where he tutched and go ea
and run after another boy and tutch him any were and he has to keep
his hand on the place were he tutched and go ea and run after
another boy and tutch him any were etc.'&mdash;</p>

<p>and OFF-GROUND TOUCH like this:</p>

<p>'You are not supposed to let your feet touch the ground, if you
do, the one who is out can have you '&mdash;</p>

<p>but somebody really ought to make a full list of games of this
kind. Aunt Eliza might do it (always fussing about with
school-children, she is, and seeing that their clothes are properly
patched behind) if she weren't so fond of explaining things&mdash;so
fond that I daresay she'ld mix up B&mdash;TOUCH with HOOPS and
HONEY-POTS, for the sake of fitting it in with some explanation or
other. That's the worst of Aunt Eliza; she's sometimes right, but
you never know when...</p>

<p>And now, come to think of it, I believe I can tell you just one
or two more of the games they play down our way. There's WILL YOU
'LIST (a recruiting game, very popular just now), and HAMMERS ON,
and KICKS, and RED ROVER ('Three steps and I'll be over'), and
CARLOW, and FRIED EGGS AND A RASHER, and POST-MAN'S KNOCK, and TEN
O'CLOCK POLICE, and SCHOOL-BOYS, and ICKAMY-!CKAMY-CO (' where's
the poor man to go? '), and SHUNTING ENGINES and FOLLOW THE
LEADER&mdash;</p>

<p>It's the only really dangerous game we have, FOLLOW THE LEADER.
Because of course the bravest boy is chosen as leader, one who
crosses the road just in front of some heavy van and then goes and
raps at all the doors of the neighbours who rush out in a rage to
see what's the matter; so that by the time the third man has done
the same there's sometimes a smash-up and always a row. A grand old
game is DOING EACH OTHER'S DAGS, as they call it; but it's bound to
end in trouble of some kind, for dead certain; though the 'leader'
generally comes off without a scratch, as they do in the army&mdash;</p>

<p>and STITCH AWAY TAILOR and BOATS and HOOPLA FOR CHOKLITTS and
BUS HORSES and REIN HORSES and SCOUTS and PICKING THE CROW'S NEST
and KNOCKING DOWN GINGER and KNOCKING GINGER OUT O'BED (rough;
played with door-knockers) and WHIRLIGIG and ROBIN SNATCH (with
handkerchiefs) and FLAG RACE and POTTY and FIVE HUNDRED MONKEYS UP
(the last two are hide-and-seek) and GUARDING THE STAKE and
JUPITER. I'm glad I didn't forget to remember JUPITER; it's an old
game and goes like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>'One has to be Jubiter and every time he hops out he has to say
Jubiter and if he catches one he has to be servant and so on until
you catch all except one and he has to be Jubiter'&mdash;</p>

<p>and SUNDAY-MONDAY and HIDING STEPS and OUTINGS and HOME IT and
WHAT'S THE TIME and TAILOR SAID and LAST MAN STANDING (like
OFF-GROUND TOUCH) and RELIEVO (like RELEASE, only chalked dens are
used) and POSTMAN RELAY and EGG AND SPOON RELAY and INDIAN CLUB
RELAY and DAY AND NIGHT and JUMPING THE BROOK and ONE MORE NO MORE
and PARVY and STOLEN NECKLACE and OUT OF BOUNDS and GIVE A JOIN
(like WIDDY) and DATE-HOGS&mdash;</p>

<p>I must tell you about DATE-HOGS. It's played by small children
with date-stones and screws&mdash;the stones you find, the screws you
pinch or mump; and each boy has a certain number of throws with his
date-stones at one of the other chaps' screws standing up on end.
Now it's quite clear that, getting the screws the way they do, they
sometimes get big ones, and sometimes little ones, and have to be
jolly glad to get any at all; and it's also clear that, big screws
being easier to hit than little ones, the game would be unfair if
you always threw from the same distance. Therefore you mustn't
always throw from the same distance. But how are you to settle it
fairly? Well, everybody knows that big screws have more turns or
twists in them than little screws have. So they measure the
throwing-distance by the number of these turns. A small screw,
which is hard to hit, has (say) five turns, so you have to stand
five paces of!; a big screw, which is easier to hit, has (say) ten
turns, and so you stand ten paces off; and this makes the chances
always even. Shows how artful these kids are&mdash;.</p>

<p>and Fox AND HOUNDS (HARE AND HOUNDS) and BATTLE OF WATERLOO and
LAMP AWAY and STICKJAW and PAPER TRUNCHEONS and POTATO-SHOOTERS and
FUEL FOR THE FIRE and TIME GUESSING and ROUND THE BLOCK and
HUMBLE-BUMBLE and GO YOUR WAY and A PIN TO LOOK AT THE
POPPY-SHOW&mdash;</p>

<p>A poppy-show&mdash;that's a puppet-show, if the boys hadn't forgotten
what a puppet-show was. You need rather a fresh boy for this game,
and when you 've found him, you get hold of a big book&mdash;a Bible, if
possible, because it has so many pages and looks respectable
any-how, but chiefly on account of the pages&mdash;and anywhere between
its pages you put a few transfers; just a few. You hold the book in
your hand with the back down-wards and press the covers together as
tightly as ever you can, and come up to your lad and say 'A pin to
look at the poppy-show'. Then he, with a pin, has to dab down
between the closed pages of the book, and if he strikes a place
where a transfer happens to be, of course it's his; otherwise, you
keep his pin. You can guess his chances, when there are about three
transfers hidden among four hundred pages. If he likes to be a
fool, he can get rid of all his pins that way, while you keep your
poppy-show for the next fresh boy you come across&mdash;</p>

<p>and LAST ACROSS and STEPS ACROSS and PEEP (also called JACK) and
HOME FOUR and I SPY EGGS AND BACON (hide-and-seek) and SAVOY (also
called SAVELOY) and WATER-MAN and LEADING THE BLIND HORSE TO THE
KNACKER and FAIRY CHASE and HOPPING JINNY and SKITTLES KNOCK 'EM
DOWN and GUESSING WORDS (at shop-windows) and NICKO MIDNIGHT ('
Flash your light') and PIG IN THE POT&mdash;</p>

<p>'One person stands in the middle all the rest stand at one end
the whole lot have to run to the other side. If you start you must
keep on. If one or two are caught you have to join hands and go
after the others&mdash;'</p>

<p>and FIGHT FOR THE FLAG (two parties: played from a mound) and
LEARN YOUR A. B. C. and SERVING YOUR COUNTRY A GOOD GAME and
LIG-A-LOG and FRENCH BLIND MAN'S BUFF and ANIMAL BLIND MAN'S
BUFF&mdash;</p>

<p>'A ring is drawn, in which is a blind man, and the players; the
players move about until the blind man strikes on the ground with
his wand. He then touches any one (all are standing still) and asks
them to imitate an animal's voice. He then tries to recognise them
by their voice. If he succeeds the other is the blind man, if not,
the game is continued'&mdash;</p>

<p>and WILL YOU SURRENDER and TELLING YOUR DREAM and FIVE TEN
FIFTEEN TWENTY (catch-game) and JACK AROUND (catch) and SEE YOU
ACROSS and LONG RUN and RACE TO BERLIN (new) and BOGIE MAN (catch)
and No MAN STANDING and WALL TO WALL and SAINT GEORGE AND HIS MERRY
MEN and DELIVER YOUR LUG-GAGE and FISH AWAY JACK (four lamp-posts
and eight boys) and PIN, BUTTON, OR MARBLE&mdash;</p>

<p>In this, you go up to a boy smaller than yourself and take him
by the throat and say 'Pin, button, or marble.' And that's all you
have to do. Because then he must turn out his pockets and give you
whatever he can find, and thank God if he doesn't get a thrashing
into the bargain. It isn't exactly what you 'Id call even chances,
but it's quite all right, especially if you happen to be the big
boy; because the big boy generally wins at this game. Now you may
wonder why they collect pins. Well, our boys will collect anything,
anyhow, anywhere&mdash;even if it's useless; but precious few things,
you know, are really useless (I can't think of a single one, just
now), and as to pins&mdash;I'm not even going to try to tell you in how
many ways you need them. Some boys go about with a provision of
hundreds of pins stuck in their clothes for different sports;
mothers are also very fond of pins, and if you give them a nice
handful on a Saturday morning, they'll think you 've been quietly
thinking about them all the week and collecting pins for them; and
maybe that'll mean an extra something for the picture-show later
on. They collect buttons the same way, for games like BUTTONS IN
THE RING; only the buttons must be of metal, of brass or steel;
they must ring like money when you throw them on the pavement:
that's the test. All other buttons are simply 'toot'&mdash;not worth
talking about. The best metal buttons are commissionaires' buttons;
they're called 'raileys', and a good railey is worth four or even
six ordinary metal ones, while a bad one (with a loose shank, for
instance) will fetch only two. Many boys are able to stitch
them-selves full of these buttons, for use in games; the less
clever ones, those who keep on losing them, have to cut the buttons
from their own clothes and go about from one year's end to another
with their trowsers hitched to their braces by means of their
sisters' hair-pins, bent double. But that's neither here nor
there&mdash;</p>

<p>and SINGLE SAY-GO and DOUBLE SAY-GO and QUEEN, KING OR DIRTY
RASCAL and Moscow and RUGBY SCRUM (introduced by the scouts) and I
WILL APPRENTICE MY SON TO A CARPENTER and SAILOR BOY and STORKY and
EGGS and THREE IN THREE OUT (the last four are hide-and-seek games)
and CROWNINGS (also hide-and-seek) and MOUSE IN THE COPPER and SHOW
THREE FACES: GO and MAGIC WRITING and DRAG-LAG (played with sacks)
and PICKLE CABBAGE (name-calling) and PUTTING (not pulling) THE
KAISER'S WHISKERS (new) and BLUE BOY and BACK YOU and KING CAESAR
and TING TING THE SPIDER (you need an outside window for this) and
PUSS IN THE CORNER and HOP AND CHARGE and TAKING THE CASTLE and
DARTS (also called NIBS) and PENNY THREE HALFPENCE TWOPENCE
(running) and TWO IN TWO OUT and TUG OF WAR and CHIVY CHASE and
DADDY RED-CAP (or GREEN-CAP)&mdash;and that's enough for to-day.</p>

<p>DADDY RED-CAP has a song beginning like this:</p>

<p class="letter">'Plaster of Paris has lost his hat&mdash;<br>
Some say this, and some say that...'</p>

<p>and that's interesting, because 'Plaster of Paris', of course,
is all nonsense. And so is 'Plaistow Palace', as they sometimes
call it. The real song goes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">'Beadle Palace has lost his hat&mdash;<br>
Some say this, and some say that...'</p>

<p>but the boys twist the words about, because they disremember who
Beadle Palace was; and I can't tell you either. Mr. Perkins, of
Framlingham Brothers (Limited), once told me he knew all about it;
he said that 'Beadle Palace' stands for the Bishop of London, who
<i>really did</i> lose his hat one evening; and 'some say' it was
blown off his head by the wind, and 'some say' he gave it to a
woman with red hair and a squint, and never got it back again. But
he was a bit on, that night, was Mr. Perkins. Or else the Bishop
must have been...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Summing Up</h2>

<p>These are about a thousand of the outdoor games they play down
our way&mdash;not a bad number, when you think that our children can
only play after they come home from school or work, and that they
hardly ever play on Sundays on account of their clothes, or in
winter because the evenings are too dark, and that the rain often
keeps them indoors anyhow, and that the lads over 14 don't play at
all. And yet, no doubt, I must have forgotten to tell you half of
them; and I shall never stop forgetting, if I don't stop trying to
remember...</p>

<p>Now what I think is this. It doesn't matter how all these sports
are played. What matters is that they <i>are</i> played. To show
how wide-awake our youngsters are, to be able to go on inventing
games out of their heads all the time&mdash;that's the point: my point,
at least. The particular rules of all these different games&mdash;they
don't strike me as very important, or even interesting.</p>

<p>And you'll agree with me that it's as clear as daylight, and it
all comes to this: if you want to see what children can do, you
must stop giving them things. Because of course they only invent
games when they have none ready-made for them, like richer folks
have&mdash;when, in other words, they've nothing in their hands. As Mr.
Perkins said: 'You can't play a ball-game, if you haven't got a
ball', meaning that if you want to play, and have nothing to play
with, you must play at something that doesn't need anything. Give
them bats and balls, and they soon forget their CHINESE ORDERS, and
there's an end of SHOWING NO IVORY, and nobody thinks of PULLING
our FATHER'S RHUBARB, and OLD DEVIL may go to&mdash;well, where he came
from. That's what keeps them alive and 'imaginative' (as Aunt Eliza
would say)&mdash;having nothing to play with. That's what makes them use
up all they can find&mdash;clay and kerb-stones and nuts and
winkle-shells and clothes and empty condensed-milk tins and walls
and caps and stones and window-sills and buttons and doorsteps and
lamp-posts and rags and anything else that comes handy. And that's
how they come to play any number of games and to discover new ones
every day, while better-class lads get into grooves and go on with
their frowsy old cricket and one or two more all the time, always
the same, year after year.</p>

<p>Not that I'm saying anything against CRICKET in particular. You
can do many things with a bat. But there are many more things you
can't do. And all these other things are bound to be left outside
your reach in the long run, if you get taken up by cricket.
Because, you see, you don't take up cricket&mdash;you think you do, but
you don't; you get taken up. You think you are going to do what you
please with a bat, but the fact is, the bat does what it pleases
with you; you think it's your servant, but in reality it's a master
who drives you along the way he means to go&mdash;or rather, the only
way he can go (that is, hitting a ball). It's perfectly true that
you can play well or badly; but, play as you like, you can't help
your faculty for inventing something outside bats and balls getting
rustier all the time. And it's true that cricket saves you the
trouble of inventing those other games; that's just its drawback, I
say. No getting out of the rut! With the bat in your hand, you can
only do what it allows you to do. Which is a good deal; but not
half as much as if your hand were empty.</p>

<p>And what Mr. P. said of ball-games applies to all the others
that are played with <i>things</i>. Say you want to have a go at
WRIGGLY-WORM. Eight! But you can't mark out a pattern in chalk if
you have no chalk to do it with. That's clear. And you haven't
always got a lump of chalk in your pocket; now, have you? And then
you feel about and turn them inside out and find you have not only
no chalk but nothing else&mdash;absolutely nothing at all; not a top or
a marble, no, not even a konker or a nicker or a bus-ticket. And
then?</p>

<p>Why, then, if you can't invent something different, something
jolly well altogether out of your head, where are you? Because, of
course, you 've got to play some-thing or other&mdash;unless you want to
be a soppy fathead. And our youngsters don't want to be soppy
fatheads. What's more, they aren't. They try a good many things,
and often they succeed; but they couldn't be <i>that</i>, even if
they tried; which they don't.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Postscript</h2>

<p>Aunt Eliza writes to say that she can't explain what the boys
mean when they say 'Obobe', but she feels sure it must be
'something not quite nice'. Thank God, there's one thing she can't
explain. For my part, I think these words like Obobe and A-lairy
and Widdy are the queerest thing of all, about these sports. And
what's queerer still are the names like Salmon Fishing and Cold
Pies and Blue Boy, that make sense but have nothing whatever to do
with the games.</p>

<p>She also tells me that the song of <i>London Bridge is broken
down</i> goes back to 'bloodthirsty rites of foundation-sacrifice'
(read it in some book, I daresay, and so thinks it must be true),
and that <i>Fie Sally, Cry Sally</i> 'originated in early
water-worship'. Early water-worship be blowed. Late beer-worship is
more my style. But Aunt Eliza knows too much, anyhow; so much, that
I shall have to ask her about the originating of the game of
DUCKING MUMMY, and whether it makes her think of a certain good old
custom. Then she says that <i>Here we come gathering nuts in
May</i> is 'a relic of Marriage by Capture', and some more stuff of
that kind. No doubt; no doubt. Aunt Eliza thinks a good deal about
Marriage by Capture&mdash;to judge by her talk, at least. Nobody ever
tried to capture <i>her</i>, you know. And nobody ever will, I
don't think.</p>
