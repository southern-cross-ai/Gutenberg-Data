<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">It</span> fell to my lot to write the "History
of South Australia," and in that work it was
stated:&mdash;"Honours are divided among the claimants to be
founders of South Australia. Edward Gibbon Wakefield was the
first to set forth the principles of the new form of
Colonisation; Mr. Gouger, the Secretary of the South Australian
Association, took up the idea, and worked it into practical
shape; Colonel Torrens brought experience and influence to bear
to make the scheme popular, and ensure its acceptance by the
Government; while Mr. George Fife Angas made the working of the
Act of Parliament possible."</p>
<p>In filial regard for the memory of her father, Mr. Robert
Gouger, Miss Adelaide Gouger carefully preserved all that
remained of his journals and papers relating to South Australia,
and the important part he took in its foundation, and, as no
authentic record has hitherto been published of his life-work,
she kindly placed in my hands all the documents in her
possession, with the request that I would edit them.</p>
<p>It was desirable that the story of Mr. Gouger's services
should be told, and although there may not be many living who
remember him personally, the flourishing Colony of South
Australia bears witness to his zeal; and, to quote the words of
Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield, "the successful issue of his long
contests with the judgments of ignorance, the insults of pride,
and the delays of idleness should be a lesson of encouragement to
the advocates of useful projects."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<h4>IN EARLY DAYS.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Robert Gouger</span> was born on the 26th of
June, 1802. He came of an old French family, and the name was
originally pronounced <i>Gougére</i>. His great-grandfather
emigrated from France in 1685, on the revocation of the Edict of
Nantes, and settled in Ramsgate, where he built himself a house.
He was drowned at sea&mdash;a fate which also befell his son
George&mdash;from which it is to be inferred that the business in
which the family were engaged had relation to mercantile affairs
connected with shipping in foreign parts.</p>
<p>The father of Robert Gouger was born in 1763, married in 1787,
and died in 1840. He was the father of eleven children, Robert
being the youngest but one. All of these have now passed away:
four of them died young, others lived to a good old age, John,
the eldest, dying at 93, Mary at 96, Sarah at 95, Alfred, the
youngest and unmarried, at 78.</p>
<p>Robert Gouger's mother was a remarkable woman, and her
influence left its distinct mark on the characters of all her
children. She was particularly clever and well read, and could
enter into the studies of her children in their school-days,
however abstruse the subjects might be, no less than when in
later life her sons embarked on their careers. When grown to
manhood she guided them with her counsel; it was to her keen
judgment they submitted the points they could not solve
themselves. It was she who made the brightness, attractiveness,
and happiness of a beautiful home-life, and at the same time
inspired her children to press forward to wider fields of action
and intellectual attainment. She lived in advance of her time,
and in knowledge and accomplishment was abreast of the most
advanced of the women of her day. This in no way detracted from
her activity in household duties, but only gave a zest to them,
and her wise management enabled her to devote her time and
thought to the subjects which interested her children. With her
son Robert, and his schemes for colonisation, she was in such
full sympathy that there was scarcely a phase in the many-sided
subject she did not thoroughly understand, nor a situation in
which he was in perplexity in which she could not render
practical aid.</p>
<p>To both father and mother each member of the family owed a
deep debt of gratitude for the formation of their characters.</p>
<p>Of the brothers of Robert Gouger, the subject of this
memorial, the career of Henry was perhaps the most remarkable. He
resided for some years in Bengal, where he followed what was then
regarded as the hazardous occupation of producing raw silk in
competition with the Commercial Resident of the East India
Company. That was in the days when the arbitrary power which that
Government possessed was intrusted to its servants, who, as is
well known, sometimes used it in the most unscrupulous manner to
crush the spirit of private enterprise, and to retain in their
hands the virtual monopoly of a branch of industry which, by an
act of the British legislature in 1813, had been declared open to
all its subjects under certain restrictions.</p>
<p>While in Bengal, Henry Gouger was attacked by an illness which
baffled medical skill, and he was advised, as a last resource, to
try a change of climate as affording the only means of recovery.
On the suggestion of a friend, he determined to make a voyage to
Rangoon, the chief seaport of the Burmese Dominions, and thence
by the Irrawaddi to Amerapoorah, then the capital of the Empire.
His idea was, that in addition to finding health, he might find
that a highly lucrative commerce could be established with
Amerapoorah and the regions beyond, especially in the
introduction of British cotton manufactures, which were at that
time beginning to supplant the native fabrics in most of the
markets of the East.</p>
<p>Unhappily these dreams did not come true. The Burmese Empire
was then (1822) a <i>terra incognita</i>; he found scarcely a man
in authority who was not oppressive, corrupt, crafty, and cruel;
he saw prospects of immense fortune, but depending upon enormous
difficulties to be overcome; he was staggered at the barbarity of
the king and his court, and over and over again he met with
extraordinary perils, and no less extraordinary escapes. Soon
after the bombardment of Rangoon he was falsely accused of being
a British spy, and was cast into prison, where, under horrible
circumstances, and amid appalling scenes of torture, he was
detained for two years, eventually escaping with only his life.
To the day of his death he bore traces of the frightful
sufferings he had undergone in Burmah, and in his later years he
could do little more than stroll about in the beautiful grounds
of his home at Frogmore House, Blackwater, Hants, where he led
the quiet life of a country gentleman, beloved by all who knew
him.</p>
<p>He was a man of very considerable literary ability, and in his
last years he wrote a book, published by Mr. John Murray in
1860&mdash;the year before the author's death&mdash;entitled "The
Prisoner of Burmah; A Personal Narrative of Two Years'
Imprisonment in Burmah."</p>
<p>Henry Gouger died while a second edition of his work was in
preparation, and the preface was therefore written by his brother
Alfred, who passed the edition for the press. In his preface
Alfred speaks of the "perfect truthfulness and simplicity" of his
brother's character, of his "good taste," of "the spirit of manly
independence which characterised every act of his life," of "his
energies and resources," and of "the clearness and tenacity of
his powers of memory."</p>
<p>Similar excellences appear to have attached to all the Gouger
brothers&mdash;they did at all events as regarded Robert, with
whose history we are alone concerned in these pages, and also as
regarded Alfred, the youngest of the family.</p>
<p>Before passing away from our reference to Henry Gouger, one
incident connected with his residence in Burmah may be recorded
here. After his escape from prison, the first Burmese war was in
progress, but the British were anxious for peace, and a Treaty
had been practically agreed to. Gouger in due course reported
himself to Sir Archibald Campbell, the General Commanding, who
received him with great kindness and consideration. The army
continued to advance until it reached Yandaho, a place well known
as being the spot on which the belligerents settled their
animosities, and here Gouger was able to render very important
services to Sir Archibald Campbell and to the Government. We will
let Mr. Henry Gouger tell the story in his own words.</p>
<p>"On the 22nd or 23rd of February [1826], two dignitaries from
the Burmese Court arrived in the camp, with honest instructions
this time, to consent to the terms made known to them. The
preliminaries had been complied with by the release of the
prisoners, and the arrival of a quarter of a million sterling in
specie, being one-quarter of the stipulated indemnity.</p>
<p>"But now a singular difficulty arose. How the British army
could have advanced thus far into the country without having a
man among them capable of translating a State document into the
Burmese language, it is not easy to explain. So it was, however,
and this clearly shows how slight the intercourse must have been
between the two countries before this time. The General's
interpreter was a native youth of Chinese extraction, who, of
course, <i>spoke</i> the Burmese language fluently enough, and
English indifferently. With this his knowledge ceased; he could
neither write nor read the Burmese, and had not Dr. Judson [the
famous American missionary] and myself been at the General's
disposal, the impediment would have been a serious one, as the
Burmese could not be expected to put their hands to a document
written in a language they did not understand; nor, on the other
hand, could the British Commissioners trust to a native copy
alone. The English Treaty was, therefore, placed in our hands for
translation, and when we produced a Burmese copy, both were to be
acknowledged as original documents of equal validity. It gave me
great pleasure to make some return for Sir A. Campbell's
kindness, in this and other ways where my knowledge of the
language was required&mdash;indeed, by an extraordinary accident,
I was the means not only of aiding the General, but also of
enriching the Exchequer of the East India Company to the amount
of nearly £70,000, in a manner that was not less gratifying to me
because it came from the pocket of my late oppressors. The affair
is worth recording.</p>
<p>"The fifth article of the Treaty has these words:&mdash;'As
part indemnification to the British Government for the expenses
of the war, His Majesty the King of Ava agrees to pay the sum of
<i>one crore of rupees</i>.' It will naturally be asked, What
kind of rupee is intended? It is not a coin of the country. The
Burmese only know it as the coin issued to the British troops,
and these being chiefly from the Madras Presidency, the Madras
rupee was the one issued and passed into general circulation.
This was the one commonly known to the Burmese, and one crore, or
ten millions, of these rupees they would naturally expect to
pay&mdash;no other could have been reasonably demanded of them.
But there was another kind of rupee current in Bengal in those
days, denominated the <i>sicca rupee</i> the metallic value of
which was between 6½ and 7 per cent., greater than the Madras
rupee; and as both the General and the Civil Commissioner came
from Bengal, I had reason to think the <i>sicca rupee</i> was the
one they intended, though they had failed to express it in the
words so carelessly used. As the Treaty was not yet signed, I
went to communicate my thoughts to Sir Archibald Campbell. He saw
the blunder at once, summoned the Burmese chiefs instantly to a
conference, at which I was present, and explained to them that,
although the words be allowed to stand in the Treaty, <i>sicca
rupees</i> were those intended and would be claimed; and paid
they were ultimately, in full tale! A memorandum was attached to
the Treaty expressive of this understanding." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* "The Prisoner of Burmah," by Henry Gouger
Second edition. John Murray, 1862, pp. 297-9.]</p>
<p>Very few records have been preserved of the early life of
Robert Gouger, the youngest but one of the six brothers. He spent
his childhood at Stamford, in Lincolnshire, was educated at a
school in Nottingham, and obtained his business knowledge in
London in the office of his father, who was a city merchant of
excellent repute and of good means.</p>
<p>As a youth he showed signs of unusual intelligence, addicting
himself to study for the mere love of it, and beguiling his
leisure hours with recreation in Natural History. He was an
ardent lover of nature, and delighted in roaming over woodland
and moor in search of birds, butterflies, and insects, which he
collected and classified with no ordinary skill, stuffing the
birds and setting the butterflies himself with infinite pains and
dexterity.</p>
<p>Later on he developed a taste for music, and possessing a good
rudimentary knowledge, he found the "concord of sweet sounds" a
source of enjoyment, not only then but throughout his life. Added
to this his tastes were literary; he read standard works on all
subjects with care and intelligence, and was in the habit, it
would appear, of making digests of what he had read&mdash;an
excellent habit which has sadly fallen into disuse in the present
day. His literary recreation was in reading the works of the
great poets, and in his many and long rambles a favourite book
would serve as his guide, philosopher, and Mend. As the days went
on ambition dawned, and he became a frequent contributor of poems
to the magazines&mdash;<i>Blackwoods</i> in
particular&mdash;where they were gladly received and
published.</p>
<p>By the time Robert Gouger had arrived at the age of manhood
the foundations of his character were not only laid, but were
placed in position ready for the building upon them the work of
his life.</p>
<p>In matters of religion he had accepted without reservation the
Christian faith in which he had been brought up. He had laid
hold, too, of the grand simple landmarks of morality&mdash;that
it is better to be true than false, better to be generous than
selfish, better to be chaste than licentious, better to be brave
than to be a coward, and, in proportion as he held to these
virtues, he hated, with a good and hearty hatred, those who
wantonly disregarded them.</p>
<p>In politics he was an out-and-out Radical&mdash;at first, from
his home-training and home associations, but later from his own
convictions, the result of careful inquiry and observation. Even
before he had reached manhood he had developed a strong,
passionate interest in the poor. He could not reconcile the idea
of so much luxury and extravagance and so much terrible poverty
existing side by side in London and the other great centres of
population in the country. He knew not how, but he felt sure that
there must be something essentially wrong in the Poor Law system
when this was the case; he was convinced that the poor laboured
under unjust disadvantages in not having among themselves men who
could tell in high places the story of their sufferings, and
plead for redress of their wrongs. Wherever he went&mdash;and he
travelled much, both in his own country and on the
Continent&mdash;he made investigations, and noted in his diary
the condition of the people, their habits, their wants, the
insanitary state of their dwellings, their modes of living, their
need of reformation, their lack of education, and the lethargy of
the clergy in all practical matters relating to the general
condition of the poor. He was an intimate friend of Robert Owen,
the great "Social theorist," and was deeply interested in his
views on the co-operative system, and in the many important
reforms he introduced, having for their object the improvement of
the status of the labourers in his employ.</p>
<p>It was his sympathy for the oppressed working classes, and the
hopeless state into which they were drifting through want of
employment, that first called out his zeal for
colonisation&mdash;the great work of his life&mdash;and it was
that also which inspired him, in an hour of great political
excitement, to espouse the cause of "the oppressed twelve
millions of Spaniards" to which further reference will shortly be
made.</p>
<p>The impression left on the mind of the present writer, after a
careful study of all his private papers known to be in existence,
is, that from first to last, Robert Gouger was a shrewd,
intelligent, observant man, faithful in small duties as in great,
conscious always of the obligations of Christianity combined with
high morality; that he was inspired by a strong sense of duty in
all the exacting labours he undertook, buoyed up by a yearning
aspiration to serve his fellow creatures, especially the
struggling poor; adventurous, even to recklessness, in any cause
he espoused with enthusiasm; prodigal of time and energy in every
movement to which he was pledged.</p>
<p>This estimate is borne out by one who knows the whole story of
his life, and has said that he "was a truly Christian man, with

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<h4>A REVOLUTIONARY EXPEDITION.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Some</span> extracts from a carefully written
MS. will give a better idea of what manner of man Mr. Gouger was,
in his earlier days, than can be given from any other source. He
was, as we have seen, and as we shall see more fully later on, a
man of an adventurous spirit, and the stirring times of 1830 gave
him an opportunity to indulge his love of daring enterprise.</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"On the 20th of August, 1830," he writes, "I
left England to join Colonel Valdes, who was at Havre with the
Spaniards whom I had seen on board the <i>Mary</i>. I landed at
Calais on the day Louis Phillippe was proclaimed King of the
French, and gave my first shout for liberty on that joyous
occasion. It appeared a favourable omen to me. A despot had just
been hurled from his throne, and a citizen king occupied his
place. An officer who stood by me, threw me a tri-coloured
cockade in return for my enthusiastic cry,* and this I wore
during the whole of my residence on the
Continent.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The tri-coloured cockade, much faded, is still
in the possession of Miss S. Adelaide Gouger.]</p>
<p class="quote">"On the 24th I arrived at Havre, where I found
Colonel Valdes and about 80 Spaniards, the greater part of whom
were officers. On the following day, being summoned by Colonel
Pinto, Valdes went to Paris, leaving me with four Spanish
officers, to superintend the departure of the officers and
soldiers for Bayonne. The plan of hiring a ship to make a descent
upon the north of Spain, which had been determined upon by
Valdes, being found impracticable for want of funds, the men were
observed to walk to Bayonne, a distance of 700 miles. This and
other business detained me at Havre nearly a fortnight, during
which time I was enabled partially to learn the Spanish
language.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"September the 8th saw me at Paris. Finding I was in good time
for the movements which were to take place in Spain, I resolved
to comply with the request of Colonel Pinto to remain some days
with him to assist in the English correspondence.<br>
<br>
"The glorious and successful struggle which the Parisians had
made on 'The Three Days' was marked in a variety of ways and
places.<br>
<br>
"On the 14th I had the honour of an interview with General
Lafayette. I was introduced by Colonel Pinto, and remained with
the General for nearly three hours. The General, who is in his
73rd year, was still in good health and tolerably active. His
appearance commands respect, but there is a blandness in his
manner which places those who are with him perfectly at ease. He
received me very cordially, and on being told that I was going to
fight for the constitutional cause in Spain, was warm in his
congratulations. At the conclusion of a long but interrupted
interview, he invited me to his house on the following Tuesday,
and desired me to remember that in leaving Paris I left a friend
who would be always glad to see me. From his long residence in
America and his frequent interviews with English people, the
General speaks the English language remarkably well. Speaking of
revolutions, he said it was only necessary to 'teach a soldier he
is a citizen, and rather a citizen than a soldier,' to effect any
useful salutary change that may be desired.<br>
<br>
"On the 16th September I left Paris with Colonel Minuisir, a
Spaniard, brother-in-law to General Torrijos, late Minister of
War in Spain, and Comte Linati, a Frenchman, for Lyons."</p>
<br>
<p>While Mr. Gouger was in Lyons he found time to write to his
brother Alfred, to whom he explained, more fully than in his
diary, the object of his mission to Spain, and an extract from
that letter will enable the reader better to understand the
further extracts from the diary:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<span class="u">Lyons</span>,
<i>Sept.</i> 30<i>th</i>, 1830.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote">"<span class="u">My Dear Alfred</span>,<br>
<br>
"Before this letter reaches you I shall have been in Spain, and
most probably have seen an enemy's camp.<br>
<br>
"You will perceive by the arms on the top of this sheet * that we
are now somewhat above a conspiracy. We have <i>chargés
d'affaires</i> at London and Paris, which conspirators seldom
avow. If, however, you know not what name to give us as a party,
I hope our deeds will soon show that we are worthy of a better
name. We may soon be 'legitimate warriors.' Shame on man! that
<i>success</i> should determine the goodness of a cause;
succeeding, we are the saviours of a country; defeated, we are
traitors, and ignominy is heaped upon us. When will men think
rightly? However, be our party fortunate or otherwise, there is
some satisfaction in knowing that some of the finest-minded men
in the world are engaged with us; that the cause is that of
liberty for the oppressed twelve millions of Spaniards, and that
the sympathy of all who wish well to a good cause will be with
us. I have never regretted for one moment the step I have taken.
I am convinced that it is a card worth playing, and, although a
dangerous one, it is not the leas deserving of being played. I
cannot, however, be indifferent to what I know must be the
feelings of all my family relations. The affectionate attention I
have received from you all, has not been thrown away. Believe me,
my dear Alfred, I shall never cease to grieve for the unavoidable
separation which my present pursuit entails upon me. But
affection always descends. I believe the child never loves the
parent as the parent does the child. What, then, must be the
feelings of my dear father and mother? I know that I have always
felt the warmest feelings towards them, and, although I spared
them the pain of a formal separation, I am sure they must have
suffered much since on my account. The anxiety I am occasioning
my family is the only drawback I feel to the gladness my
enthusiasm for the cause I have undertaken creates. However, I
comfort myself with the idea that I may be again installed among
you, in the service of Spain, in my native country or in France,
after the Liberal Government is settled.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The letter was written on official paper.]</p>
<p class="quote">"P.S. <i>Tarbes, September</i>
30<i>th</i>.&mdash;I finish my letter from this place, whence I
go immediately into Spain. I shall probably precede Colonel
Gurrea to some important place with despatches, but, if not, I
shall perform the same service for Valdes. I may now be
considered a military man, and you would think so if you saw my
equipage. I have a good horse, and am clad in a cocked hat, with
a tri-coloured plume of feathers, laced surtout, and
jack-boots!.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>

<br>
<br>
<p>We now return to the diary to follow up the thread of the
narrative:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"The business which led us to Lyons, namely, the
formation of a committee of Frenchmen to assist the
constitutional Spaniards in reaching their country and supplying
us with arms, ammunition, &amp;c., during the revolution, being
satisfactorily arranged, on the 21st we proceeded to
Nismes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Political feeling was rather high
here. The Royalists were strong in the neighbourhood, in
consequence of which a regiment of the line was stationed there,
and any person who went from home after 8 o'clock at night was
required to carry a lanthorn. Two travellers, Frenchmen, were put
in jail on the preceding day for non-compliance with this
order.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>September</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;At Toulouse I met Mr. John
Hutt, who was rendering his valuable services to the Spanish
constitutional cause by conducting the pecuniary affairs
consequent on the formation of a division to be commanded by
Colonel Gurrea. From him I learned of the intrigues which a
party, calling themselves patriots and lovers of liberty, were
carrying on at Bayonne with the secret intention of preventing
revolutionary movements.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>September</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;At Bagnères we found Colonel
Gurrea, who, although much annoyed by the intrigues of Mina, was
moving on in the even tenour of his way, disregarding every
object but the great one he had in view&mdash;the liberty of his
country. "With him were the two sons of General Milans, and other
Spanish officers of distinction, who were preparing for the day
of arms. ... The minor officers were all exceedingly attached to
Gurrea, who had raised himself almost from the ranks by his
bravery and skill. Already three fortified places had declared
they only waited his approach to open their gates to him, while
his knowledge of the country and the guerilla mode of warfare
raised the greatest hopes from this
incursion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>October</i> 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Reached Bayonne. Here I found
Valdes, Pinto, and a great number of Spanish officers, by whom I
was heartily welcomed, and whom I was quite as pleased again to
recognise.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>October</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Bayonne has been the seat of
numerous intrigues since Valdes arrived. Mina quickly followed
him, and has been doing all that lay in his power to shackle the
movements of the constitutionalists enrolled under the banner of
Valdes. His followers have been instigated to seduce the officers
and men of our expedition, in which, however, they succeeded only
in the case of some weak-kneed Frenchmen. Happily, we shall now
shortly be beyond the reach of their intrigues, and shall have
but one enemy to encounter...<br>
<br>
"I have twice been into the villages where our men and arms are
placed. The first time was with Colonel Minuisir and Navarette, a
Spanish engineer officer, to inspect the men and arms. We found
the soldiers all anxiety to depart, but bearing their
disappointments well. The second journey was of a more important
nature. Intelligence having arrived that the sub-prefect of
Bayonne intended to seize the arms and ammunition in the depôts
at Villa-Franca and Usteritz, Colonel Minuisir, accompanied by
myself and three officers, started at eleven at night to walk to
the former village, to take measures against a proceeding so
fatal to our plans. Some little difficulty was found in getting
through the gates so late at night, but a silver key, added to my
being metamorphosed into an English physician going to visit a
friend who was suddenly taken ill, obtained us a passage. Arrived
at Villa-Franca, we aroused six officers, who, with us,
immediately proceeded to remove the arms to a place of safety. We
chose for this purpose a shed, open on all sides to the weather,
as being the most unlikely place for arms to be concealed. This
occupied the whole night, and our work was just completed as the
morning dawned.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>October</i> 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;This morning we entered Spain.
Being appointed aide-de-camp to General Valdes, I was constantly
with the officers and messed with the staff. At about 2 o'clock
we halted at the little village of Urpaz, where the priests paid
us a visit and the inhabitants welcomed us. After a short rest we
proceeded to Zugarramurdi, a fortified village about four miles
from the frontier. Here the General established his
head-quarters, and we remained organizing our little baud until
the 17th. Our whole force consisted of about 400 men, of whom
more than half were Frenchmen. The whole body was formed into
three battalions, and a company called the Campania Sagrada, or
Sacred Company, which consisted of educated Frenchmen who had
volunteered into the service, and Spanish officers who had as yet
no men to command. The three battalions were under the respective
commands of Colonels Leguia, Trias, and Albeniz; the Campania
Sagrada, in which I was enrolled as private, was under the
command of Captain Roa.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>October</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Left head-quarters for Vera at
2 a.m., a town about 25 miles from Zugarramurdi, where about 400
of the troops of the line were stationed, and who were daily
expecting to be reinforced from Pamplona. It was hoped that we
might be enabled to surprise this place and take possession of it
prior to the reinforcements. We reached Vera at about 11 o'clock
in the day, but peasants had given notice of our approach to the
enemy, and they were quite prepared to receive us. An officer
bearing a white flag was sent with a few men to sound the wishes
of the Royalist soldiers; they met, embraced, and we thought they
had consented to join us, but on retiring to their commanding
officer the order to fire was given, which, being returned by our
troops, the action began. In a few minutes the enemy, driven from
all the posts, retired into a strongly fortified convent situated
upon a hill in a very commanding situation. From this place it
was found impossible to dislodge them; our cannon (two
6-pounders) were not sufficiently powerful to make any impression
upon the walls, and an uncovered approach was impossible without
loss of half the men. We were therefore obliged to retire, and
the signal tor retreat on our part was one for a sortie on
theirs. This was repelled by the bayonet, which quickly decided
the matter in our favour. By this movement, however, we were
divided, and the retreat was effected in three columns, that in
which I was thrown being under the command of Colonel Minuisir,
and consisting of about 80 men.<br>
<br>
"It was now about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and having procured
a guide, we marched uninterruptedly for some hours. About 10
o'clock, however, as we were marching between two mountains, one
of which was clothed with a wood, a fire suddenly opened upon us.
The enemy, who turned out to be 150 men from Pamplona, were
placed on the side of the mountain protected by the wood. This
rendered our return fire ineffectual, while theirs upon us was
murderous. We then charged with the bayonet, which drove them
from their hiding-place; and in a few minutes decided the affair
in our favour. This rencontre placed us in a very perilous
situation. A surprise at night from a very superior force (150 to
80) was in itself dangerous enough, but the evil did not end
here. At the first fire the guide ran away, and alter the action
we found ourselves 'planted' in the wilds of the Pyrenees without
knowing what direction to take. The enemy, though routed, might
rally, and our men were fatigued with the effects of a day's
severe marching, fighting, and
abstinence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"Tired, reduced in numbers, with enemies before and behind, it
was not our object to fight. We, therefore, patiently waited the
return of the other parties, and as one of them brought an old
man as guide, we gladly availed ourselves of his services to
conduct us from this mountainous labyrinth to our head-quarters.
A most arduous march at length brought us to Zugarramurdi, which
we reached at 7 o'clock on Monday morning, after having been
engaged in uninterrupted walking and fighting since 2 o'clock the
preceding morning.<br>
<br>
"We were not allowed to rest long. At noon the same day the
enemy, reinforced by large bodies of Royalist volunteers, made
their appearance on the heights above the village to the number
of about 2,000 men, while our force, from the desertion of some
Frenchmen, from killed, and from others unable to march from
fatigue, did not now exceed 250 men. These excessive odds did
not, however, prevent General Valdes attacking them. He ordered
about 50 men to advance en guerilla between the two bodies which
were descending upon us, with orders, when attacked, to retire
gradually to the village; while he, with the rest of the troops,
endeavoured to turn the right wing, consisting of about 600 men.
In this movement he was completely successful. Unaccustomed to
the bayonet in the hands of persons who knew they could expect no
mercy if taken, the volunteers of Juannito made no stand against
our decisive attack. The first division, thrown into confusion,
retreated upon the second, who, panic struck by the rapid flight
of their comrades, without even waiting for our near approach,
joined the first division in their retreat. For five miles they
were chased without having time to rally, and the approach of
night only put an end to the pursuit.<br>
<br>
"In this action we lost but few men, while on the part of the
Royalists much blood was shed. To prevent surprise, and for the
sake of giving the troops an uninterrupted night's repose, we
encamped that night in France.<br>
<br>
"<i>October</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;At daybreak of to-day we
returned to Spain and in a short time were at Zugarramurdi.
General Valdes then created two ensigns, and, as he was pleased
to think that my conduct had been useful to the cause, he thanked
me for my zeal, and conferred on me the same grade, requesting
still my services as aide-de-camp.<br>
<br>
"<i>October</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Information reached us to-day
that the enemy was still near us, to the number of 3,000, and in
the afternoon we observed a column of about 100 men marching
towards our encampment of last night. This having the appearance
of a surprise, we remained this night in the village. No alarm of
any kind.<br>
<br>
"<i>October</i> 21<i>st</i>.&mdash;The morning had not dawned
when I received a message from General Valdes, requiring my
attendance. On my arrival he informed me that it was the united
opinion of the staff-officers that a body of British troops,
commanded by British officers, would prove of the greatest
importance to their cause, and requested my opinion as to the
possibility of obtaining them. I showed him the difficulty of the
attempt, and mentioned the many obstacles thrown in the way of
the expedition which had been planned for making a descent upon
the South of Spain under General Torrijos in the ship
<i>Mary</i>; nevertheless, as the war against Spanish despotism
was actually begun, perhaps some persons might be found willing
to make the adventure. After some conversation it was determined
I should immediately go to England to make the trial, and I was
accordingly required to be in attendance as soon as the necessary
papers could be prepared for me.<br>
<br>
"These arrangements were scarcely concluded, when a messenger
arrived informing us of the melancholy death of Colonel de Pablo,
a constitutional chief of great valour and political integrity,
who was wounded the day before while leading his troops in an
attack on the Royalists. This brave commander was savagely
butchered by the enemy, whose prisoner he became in consequence
of his wound.<br>
<br>
"In the course of the day I took my leave of the General and his
brave corps for the purpose of executing my new and difficult
commission. I could not quit these fine fellows without
considerable emotion; I felt conscious that if I ever rejoined
them, many whom I there saw would have fallen sacrifices to their
patriotism, and this conviction cast a gloom over my mind I could
not conceal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>November</i> 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;After four days and nights of
uninterrupted travelling, I found myself at Paris. Here I
remained a few days, during which the evil tidings arrived of the
complete defeat of Valdes and the loss, or dispersion, of his
whole column. With him sunk all the hopes of the
constitutionalists, and a week after the French Government
ordered those of the refugees whom the Royalist bullets had
spared to be removed to Bourges, an inland town of France,
thereby completely putting an end to all future hostilities.<br>
<br>
"<i>November</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;I once more landed on my
native shore."</p>
<br>
<p>Bound up with this diary&mdash;which contains excellent
descriptions of the country through which he passed, the scenes
he witnessed, and the persons he met&mdash;are the orders issued
by General Valdes to his corps, and the MS. letter authorising
Mr. Gouger to make terms with any British officers or volunteers
who might desire to engage in the cause. At the end of the volume
a note is added: "The total defeat of Valdes, the consequent
retreat and eventual dispersion of all the revolutionary forces,
with the excitement I found in the popular mind in England on my
arrival, quite prevented even the endeavour to raise the body of
men I had been commissioned to attempt."</p>
<p>It may be mentioned here that Captain Light, who afterwards
became the Surveyor-General of South Australia, where he was
closely associated with Robert Gouger, took an active part in
this Spanish Revolutionary War, and received the rank of Colonel.
He was wounded for the first time in his distinguished military
career, and the wound was a source of trouble to him for the rest
of his life.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<h4>THE COUNTRY AND COLONISATION.</h4>
<p><span class="a">In</span> the year 1829, when Robert Gouger
commenced the real labour of his life, the position of the
working classes of this country was only just becoming capable of
definition. Many of the vexatious laws under which they had
formerly groaned were being relaxed, and the reproach that the
"common people" were merely a part of the machinery of the
country was being gradually taken away.</p>
<p>The great fiscal reforms of Huskisson in 1825; the labours of
Joseph Hume; the repeal of the Combination Laws, which rendered
the union of working men in self-defence no longer criminal; the
repeal of the laws relating to artificers going to foreign parts,
which made emigration possible when the labour market was
overstocked; and other measures of relief, were paving the way
for further reforms generally, and for the great Reform Bill of
1832 in particular.</p>
<p>But at that time, and especially in that year (1829), there
was great poverty and consequent distress throughout the country.
All trades, pursuits and professions were becoming more and more
overcrowded, and multitudes of people of all decrees and ages
were moving about without employment, useless to themselves, and
a burden to the public. The spirit of turbulence was abroad, too,
and when, owing to stagnation in trade, there was a movement
among employers of labour to reduce wages, the only argument the
mass of the working classes knew how to use effectively, was
violence. Throughout the country riotous assemblies were held for
the discussion of grievances, and, in the factory districts,
where the introduction of machinery appeared to the ignorant to
be the end of all their hopes, mobs of discontented men employed
themselves in breaking the windows of the factories, smashing the
machinery, destroying the looms, and in many instances setting
fire to the mills.</p>
<p>It was in this year that Sir Robert Peel, owing to the
enormous increase in the population,* instituted the new police
force in the metropolis, which superseded the staff of parochial
watchmen, who were wholly inadequate for the public protection.
In their day plunder and robbery of all kinds were committed with
impunity, and after sunset no one considered it safe to venture
out of doors.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In Birmingham, for example, the population in
1815 was 90,000, in 1832 150,000.]</p>
<p>The question, therefore, at that time, which affected the
minds of all thoughtful people was, What is to be done with the
unemployed and surplus population? Into this question Robert
Gouger threw himself heart and soul, and in every action he took
he was supported by the advice and sympathy of his father and
mother, who entered with the keenest interest into the social
politics of the day.</p>
<p>The only way out of the difficulty appeared to be to send the
surplus population to some British colony, so relieving the
Mother Country of the burthen, and, at the same time, opening up
new spheres of commerce and enlarging others already in
existence. But colonisation up to that time had not been a marked
success. New South Wales was founded as a penal settlement so
early as 1788&mdash;eighteen years after its discovery by Captain
Cook. The first settlement in Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) was
made in 1803 by a guard with a body of convicts, and, until 1824,
was a dependency of New South Wales, but in that year it was made
an independent colony. It had but a poor reputation, however, for
many years after that, in consequence of the hostility of the
natives, and the depredations of escaped convicts, known as
bush-rangers.</p>
<p>Neither New South Wales nor Van Diemen's Land were popular,
therefore, as a field of emigration, the great drawback being
that they were still penal settlements, and that the trade of the
colonies was in the hands of the early convicts who had served
their time.</p>
<p>In 1829 the Swan River Settlement in Western Australia was
founded, and for a time attracted many well-to-do families to
emigrate there. But it was soon discovered that the colony had
been established on an altogether wrong basis, and that
disastrous consequences must in course of time ensue. Free grants
of land had been made in enormous quantities, and had been
selected before the colonists sailed. One individual had been
granted half a million of acres, and as he naturally selected his
"lot" close by the port, other emigrants had to go beyond this
vast and most eligible tract before they could settle. Ultimately
land was sold, but at the ridiculously low price of one shilling
and sixpence per acre, and consequently, as everybody who went
out was thus enabled to become a landed proprietor, no labourers
were found to cultivate the soil. The result, which far-seeing
men had apprehended was soon realised. The scheme was an all but
total failure.</p>
<p>The renewal of interest in colonisation at the period of which
we write was due, in great measure, to Mr. Edward Gibbon
Wakefield, who advanced the theory that free grants should be
entirely abolished; that Crown lands should not be sold at a low
price; that hired labour could never be obtained side by side
with great cheapness of land; that "the exchange of land for
labour was the only method of realising a just proportion between
land, labour, and capital"; and that "the universal sale of land,
instead of land-grants, and the exclusive employment of the
purchaser's money to promote education," should be the principle
upon which colonisation in the future should be based.</p>
<p>Robert Gouger, who at one time had been almost induced to cast
in his lot with the Swan Kiver Settlers, saw at a glance, in the
light of these new theories, the rotten basis on which that
colony was founded, and without hesitation gave up all thought of
settling there, and unreservedly adopted the principles of
colonisation as laid down by Wakefield.</p>
<p>To a man of Gouger's energy, to see a thing as practicable was
to set to work and prove it, and as the subject of colonisation
had for a long time past been an absorbing theme with him, he now
made it the business of his life. Fortune favoured him. A band of
intending colonists who had been impressed with the soundness of
Wakefield's arguments in favour of the American plan of selling
waste land instead of jobbing it according to the English plan,
placed themselves in communication with Mr. Gouger, whose name
had begun to be associated with every movement in favour of
emigration.</p>
<p>He saw that any attempt to aid these intending colonists
single-handed must be abortive, and that the only present
assistance he could render them would be to influence public
opinion, and to form provisional committees of influential men to
take steps for the foundation of new colonies. But Wakefield's
doctrine was as yet a novelty, and was being fiercely opposed by
some, ridiculed by others, and, as if by common consent, ignored
by the Colonial Department of the State.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Gouger succeeded in calling general attention to
the subject, and in forming two or three provisional committees.
But that was all. When the storm of controversy set in, several
well-known men, who had given a qualified adherence, withdrew
their names, and when the task of securing a subscribed capital
was commenced, one and all forsook their posts, and the matter
was, perforce, allowed to drop for a time.</p>
<p>During the period to which we have referred, there are no
detailed records, so far as is known, of Mr. Gouger's actions. If
he kept a diary then, there is no trace of its existence, but
from contemporary sources it is clear that he was in no wise cast
down by his first defeat, and was actively engaged in originating
a new society.</p>
<p>At first his society was simply denominated "The Emigration
Society," but in process of time it assumed the more ambitious
title of "The National Colonisation Society," of which Robert
Gouger was the secretary. And here a few pages of a rough
note-book, dating from February 3rd, 1830, to May 12th, 1830,
throw some light on his movements. Upon him devolved the task of
influencing public opinion by articles in the press, by
advertisement and appeal, and eventually by personally setting
forth the scheme, by word of mouth and by pamphlet, to members of
the Government, and of both Houses of Parliament, and to men in
high positions in the commercial world.</p>
<p>The object of the society was not to found a colony in South
Australia, but to collect and diffuse information as to the best
places for establishing colonies, and to explain and recommend
the Wakefield system as the basis of any operations of a fixed
and definite character they might undertake.</p>
<p>One of the rules was:&mdash;</p>
<p>"That one of the earliest measures of the society be, to
establish a general correspondence with the colonies, in order to
ascertain in what districts the greatest demand for labour
exists, and in what settlements colonists may direct their
enterprise with the greatest advantage."</p>
<p>Enough has been said to show that the task Robert Gouger set
himself was a gigantic one, but the brief diary to which we have
referred contains only a record of dry and bewildering labour,
useful to himself as memoranda, but of little interest now. He
was greatly assisted in his work by the circulation of two small
books: one, entitled "A Letter from Sydney, edited by Robert
Gouger," * in which the writer, whose name, for certain unknown
reasons, was not disclosed at the time, dealt largely with the
convict question as affecting the social condition of New South
"Wales, and sketched the outline of a plan for more systematic

<p>In the course of the year Mr. Gouger had opened up
correspondence with Canadian settlers as to the prospects of the
society in regard to Canada, and also with the Cape; he had
organised a crusade in many of the large centres of population in
the provinces, for the discussion of the new principles in
colonisation, and he obtained the adhesion to those principles by
a large number of influential men, among whom may be mentioned
John Mill, Malthus, Buckle, Sir Francis Burdett, Labouchere,
Milne, John Abel Smith, and Sir H. Parnell; and he had scattered
abroad by pamphlet, prospectus, and all available literature,
full information as to the rise and progress of emigration.</p>
<p>The entries in the note-book relating to those proceedings
show a dogged perseverance, a determined will, and singular force
of character&mdash;the work of any one day, from early morning
till late at night, being as much as the work of any ordinary man
in a week. Occasionally the notes are varied by records such as
the following:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>April</i> 29<i>th</i>, 1830.&mdash;I went on
board the <i>Brunswick</i> in the London Docks, in which vessel
were more than 200 persons going to New York. They had been sent
from Norfolk by the parishes, and cost per head £7, averaging two
children to one adult. On landing at New York they were to have
ten shillings each given them by the Captain, and they were
provided by the parish with a change of clothing. They were all
in good spirits, and seemed contented and happy."</p>
<br>
<p>The last entries in the diary are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>May</i> 10<i>th</i>, 1830.&mdash;Took
possession of offices No. 21, Regent Street.<br>
<br>
"<i>May</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;The meeting to-day went off very
coldly indeed. Resolution for a public meeting on the 26th was
carried, but I much fear the result."</p>
<br>
<p>The result was the break up of the society. The Colonial
Department in London had again and again been urged to
acknowledge the Wakefield system with a view to its adoption by
any colony that might be founded by the Colonisation Society. But
Mr. Wilmot Horton, Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies,
persistently opposed this, and an account of his action is given
by Mr. E. G. Wakefield, which accounts for the pessimism in the
last entry in Gouger's Journal:&mdash;</p>
<p>"This suggestion having been pressed upon the Government by a
society established for the purpose of promoting systematic
colonisation, Mr. Wilmot Horton, jealous, it would seem, of any
interference with a subject, part of which had employed his
thoughts for some years, became a member of the society, and then
broke it up by getting into the chair at a public meeting, and
zealously condemning the objects of those with whom he had
professed to unite himself. But, at the same time, he greatly
promoted the objects of the society by attacking their views, and
thus causing those views to be examined. As an example of the
assistance he thus gave to the dispersed members of the society,
I may mention that he persuaded Colonel Torrens to join him in
conducting a written controversy with two of those gentlemen, and
that, in the end. Colonel Torrens became one of the warmest
advocates of the measure to which he had objected when it was
first submitted to him." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* "The Art of Colonisation." By E. G. Wakefield.
Footnote on p. 280.]</p>
<p>Repulsed and disappointed, Mr. Gouger did not despair. He was
confident in the ultimate success of his labours, in some form or
other, and in the meantime help came to his cause from unexpected
quarters.</p>
<p>In 1831 full particulars reached England of the splendid
services rendered to the world by the discoveries made in South
Australia by Captain Sturt, the famous explorer, who wrote: "A
spot has at length been found upon the South Coast of New Holland
to which the colonist might venture with every prospect of
success, and in whose valleys the exile might hope to build for
himself and for his family a peaceful and prosperous home. All
who have even landed upon the eastern shore of St. Vincent's Gulf
agree as to the richness of its soil and the abundance of its
pastures. Indeed, if we cast our eyes upon the chart and examine
the natural features of the country behind Cape Jervis, we shall
no longer wonder at its differing in soil and fertility from the
low and sandy tracts that generally prevail along the shores of
Australia."</p>
<p>Attracted by these favourable reports, once more a party of
intending colonists applied to Mr. Gouger for his aid, and he at
once obtained from Colonel Torrens an introduction to Lord
Goderich, Secretary of State for the Colonies, to whom Mr.
Gouger, Major Bacon, and Mr. Graham submitted a scheme for
founding a colony in South Australia. This scheme met with the
qualified approval of Lord Howick, the Under-Secretary, but Lord
Goderich threw cold water upon it, and when the draft of a
charter, drawn up by Colonel Torrens, was, later on, submitted to
him, he proceeded forthwith to cut it ruthlessly to pieces.</p>
<p>Every endeavour was made by Colonel Torrens to remove his
objections, and the provisional committee, with Robert Gouger as
their secretary, agreed to modify the charter; but Lord Goderich
was inexorable, and, after a lengthy correspondence, into which
we need not enter here, the "incident closed," the provisional
committee was broken up, and the intending emigrants took their
departure to America instead of Australia.</p>
<p>No memoranda of Mr. Gouger's in relation to this
movement&mdash;which dragged its weary course for nearly two
years&mdash;appear to have been preserved, but it is matter of
history that one effect of these negotiations was tho
acknowledgment by the Government of the principle of
colonisation, for which there had been so much contention.</p>
<p>Colonel Torrens, in his work on "Colonisation," says: "To Lord
Howick belongs the honour of having been the first to give
practical operation to the principle of selling the colonial
lands at the disposal of the Crown, and of employing tho proceeds
of the sale in conveying voluntary emigrants to the
colonies."</p>
<p>To this expression Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield, in his "Art of
Colonisation," adds this testimony:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Not the least impression was made upon the Government while
the Duke of Wellington's administration lasted. But soon after
the change of Ministry which followed the 'Three Days of Paris,'
soon after Lord Howick succeeded Mr. Horace Twiss as
Under-Secretary for the Colonies, the measure suggested by the
Colonisation Society was, in part, adopted by the Government.
Defective as is that part of a measure&mdash;defective because
incomplete&mdash;still, it cannot fail to be of great service to
the colonies. Whatever the people of Canada, and of the English
settlements in America, may gain by the check which has thus been
put upon official jobbing in the disposal of waste land, they
owe, not very remotely, to the workmen of Paris or M. de
Polignac. For this great improvement they are more immediately
obliged to Lord Howick; to the leading members of the
Colonisation Society, Mr. John Sterling, Mr. Hutt, now M.P. for
Hull, and Mr. Charles Tennant, then M.P. for St. Albans, and more
especially to Mr. Robert Gouger, the Secretary of the Society,
whose efforts to procure the adoption of its whole plan have been
unceasing for several years. The successful issue of Mr. Gouger's
long contests with the judgments of ignorance, the insults of
pride, and the delays of idleness, should be a lesson of
encouragement to the advocates of useful projects."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<h4>A JOINT STOCK LAND COMPANY.</h4>
<p><span class="a">In</span> view of the fact, that, although
extravagant hopes of success had attended the formation of the
Swan River Settlement, it had proved an almost total failure, it
behoved the projectors of any new colony in Australia to put
forth some very strong recommendations of their scheme if they
would secure the ear of the Government and the ready cash of
subscribers. It was necessary, at any rate, that they should show
distinctly that whatever were the causes of failure at the Swan
River those causes should not operate in any new project.</p>
<p>Such was the burden of the Press when it became known in June,
1833, that, notwithstanding the rebuffs Mr. Gouger and his
colleagues had received in their previous attempts, they were
again taking action for founding a colony in South Australia.</p>
<p>It was at this point in the history of the movement that Mr.
Gouger began to keep a systematic Journal, and henceforth in
these pages we shall, aw far as possible, let him tell his own
story in his own words.</p>
<p>The first of the large-sized and closely-written volumes is
headed&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="center">"<span class="a">Private Journal Relating to
South Australia</span>.<br>
<br>
<i>Renewal of the attempt to found a Colony at Port
Lincoln.</i>"</p>
<br>
<p>The Journal commences thus:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>June</i> 22<i>nd</i>, 1833.&mdash;In the
course of conversation with Mr. W. W. Whitmore, M.P., upon the
subject of colonisation, it appeared desirable to make an attempt
to found a colony upon the southern part of Australia, not only
for the sake of testing certain principles of colonisation, but
as affording another outlet for the superabundant capital and
population of Great Britain. It was therefore determined that I
should send to Mr. Whitmore a paper containing the heads of a
charter which he could show to the Secretary of State for the
Colonies."</p>
<br>
<p>On the next day the following letter was sent:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><span class="a">Mr. Gouger</span>, <i>to</i>
<span class="a">Mr. W. W. Whitmore, M.P.</span></p>
<br>
<div class="quote" align="right">"<i>June</i> 23<i>rd</i>,
1833.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<p class="quote">"<span class="u">Dear Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
"I have taken the liberty of enclosing a sketch of those points
which it appears to me must be included in any charter in order
to the successful formation of the colony at Spencer's Gulf. They
are simply such as are necessary to give effect to the principles
of colonisation, and to offer to a Company such a reasonable
expectation of profit as may induce commercial men to invest
money in the speculation; at the same time I should trust that
Government will not object to them, as all the parts to which
they formerly objected are now left out, and the appointment of
the Governor and the mode of administering the affairs of the
Colony are left entirely at their discretion.<br>
<br>
"The only ground upon which I can conceive that an objection will
be raised to the plan, as at present submitted, would be to the
inexpediency of increasing our colonies, and thereby producing,
to a certain extent, the very dispersion which the principle of
colonisation seeks to prevent. To this objection, however, should
it be urged, it may, I think, be answered that the mode of
administering the affairs of the other colonies in Australia has
effectually prevented concentration for a long period, and that
there are circumstances in all the other Australian Colonies
which will prevent for some time capitalists from embarking their
property in the purchase of land there, especially with a view of
settlement. The establishment, therefore, of a colony to which
the reasons restraining such an employment of capital do not
apply, would have the effect of creating a fund for the purposes
of emigration, rather than of diverting to a new spot a fund
which otherwise would have been employed in one of the colonies.
The circumstances which prevent to a certain extent the
emigration of capitalists to the other colonies may be stated to
be, in addition to the dispersion already produced, the existence
of the convict system in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land,
and the want of labour and of a harbour at Swan River, together
with the inconveniences which must result from the divisions of
that colony consequent upon the settlement formed at King
George's Sound.<br>
<br>
"There are, however, points to which the attention of the
Government should be called in relation to the regulation of the
colony which it has been deemed imprudent to insist upon as
indispensable to the formation of the colony, and which must
therefore be left to the decision of the Ministry. Of these, the
most important is free trade.<br>
<br>
"A fact is mentioned by Colonel Hanson, in his pamphlet on the
Swan River Colony, which indicates an evil from which it is
highly desirable that this colony should be exempt. He states
that at the time of the greatest privation in the colony, there
was strong inclination among the Dutch at Java, within three
weeks' sail of them, to send provisions and other articles for
their supply, but that the presence of the <i>Sulphur</i> sloop
effectually prevented any such contraband traffic. It is desired
that Port Lincoln should be free as is the Port of
Singapore."</p>
<br>
<p>The enclosure referred to the above letter was:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"A sketch of the most important heads of a
charter for founding a colony by means of a Land Company.<br>
<br>
"1. The sale of all land in the colony at, or above, a fixed
minimum price.<br>
<br>
"2. The employment of the proceeds of such sales in the
conveyance to the colony of young pauper labourers of both sexes
in equal numbers.<br>
<br>
"3. The increase of the minimum price of land till it shall be
found adequate to the full supply of the labour required for its
cultivation.<br>
<br>
"4. The territory of the colony to be defined and to extend over
a space sufficiently large to prevent any alteration in the value
of land in the colony by the .adoption of another system of
disposing of land in its vicinity.<br>
<br>
"5. The Governor and all the officers of the colony to be
appointed by the Crown.<br>
<br>
"6. The company to have the pre-emption of 1,000,000 of acres to
be selected within a given time at the minimum price; 500,000
acres to be paid for within five years from the date of the
charter.<br>
<br>
"7. The company to defray the expense of the government of the
colony until the population shall exceed a given number, the
entire cost of the government to be limited, and the whole to be
considered a colonial debt, to be repaid at such times and in
such amounts as may be agreed upon.<br>
<br>
"8. A land tax, or a tax upon rent, to be levied from the
commencement of the colony, for the purpose of raising a fund for
repaying the company, in the first instance, the sum which it
shall have advanced for the purposes of the Government, and
afterwards to meet the Government expenditure.<br>
<br>
"9. Perfect freedom of trade."</p>
<br>
<p>These papers were duly forwarded to Mr. E. G. Stanley,
successor to Lord Goderich in the Colonial Department. Against
the respective numbers in this sketch Mr. Stanley
wrote:&mdash;<br>
<br>
2. How to be accomplished?<br>
<br>
3. Not sufficiently explicit.<br>
<br>
8. Land Tax very difficult of collection.<br>
<br>
9. Cannot be granted; the colony must stand on the same footing
as other colonies in that part of the world.<br>
<br>
On July 5th, a meeting of committee was held at the office of
Messrs. Gouger &amp; Co., of Leadenhall Street, to consider this
paper and the remarks upon it, and to send in a more detailed
plan to Government. There were present Mr. Whitmore, M.P., in the
chair, Messrs. J. Montefiore, Mangles, Samuel Mills, E.
Heathfield, Col. Torrens, A. Borradaile, R. D. Hanson, Robert
Gouger, and Captain Gowan.<br>
<br>
After much discussion, the following letter and accompanying
papers were sent in to the Colonial Office through Mr.
Whitmore.</p>
<p class="quote">"<span class="u">Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
"I have the honour to enclose a series of propositions (No. 1),
which are submitted by way of suggestions for the establishment
of a colony on the southern side of Australia, subject to such
modifications as may be deemed necessary by His Majesty's
Government. It may be right to remark that the proposed limit of
territory comprehends part of the unsettled lands included within
the range prescribed as the limit of the colony of New South
Wales by the Royal Commission under which that colony was
founded; but this territory being very remote from the settled
parts of the colony, it is presumed that this will not be found
an insuperable difficulty to the establishment of the proposed
new colony.<br>
<br>
"By the enclosed paper (No. 1), it is proposed that the Joint
Stock Company, the formation of which will be necessary to the
colony, should be pledged to an advance not exceeding the sum of
£100,000 by way of guarantee against the colony becoming
chargeable to this country, and the promoters of the plan hope
that arrangement will be deemed satisfactory by H.M. Government.
Should, however, the preference be given by H.M. Government to
the expense of the colony being assumed by the company without
limit, I beg leave to submit as an alternative the enclosed paper
No. 2.</p>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:right; margin-right:15%;">"I
have the honour, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</div>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">
"<span class="u">R. D. Hanson</span>."</div>
<p align="center"><span class="u">Enclosure No. 1.</span></p>
<p class="quote">"The object proposed is to found a colony on the
southern coast of Australia by means of the purchase of waste
land from the Government by a Joint Stock Company and by private
individuals. This principle of the sale of land has been adopted
for the purpose of procuring the means of conveying to the colony
the unemployed population of the United Kingdom, as well as with
a view of preventing those evils which, in other countries, have
resulted from the dispersion of the colonists, while the mode of
applying the money arising therefrom will supply the want of
labour, which is the chief impediment to the progress of new
countries.<br>
<br>
"In order to obviate the objection which might arise from the
apprehension of expense being occasioned to the Home Government,
it is proposed that the cost of the formation and government of
the colony should be advanced by the company hereinafter
mentioned.<br>
<br>
"The following is a statement of the principles upon which it is
deemed expedient that the colony should be founded; and, with a
view to maintain them inviolate for a certain period of time, it
is proposed that they should be embodied in a charter to be
granted to the colony by the Crown.<br>
<br>
"1. The territory of the colony to be defined, and to extend over
a space sufficiently large to prevent any alteration in the value
of land by the adoption of any other system of disposing of land
in its vicinity.<br>
<br>
"The extent of land which it is thought desirable to fix as the
territory of the colony is that lying between the 130th and 140th
degrees of east longitude (both inclusive) on the southern coast
of Australia, including the islands on that line of coast. The
object of such an extent of territory being required is, as above
stated, the prevention of any other system of disposing of waste
land in the vicinity being adopted; for if land should ever again
be given away (as heretofore in the colonies) in the
neighbourhood of the estates of the company and of individuals,
the value of these would fall, and the supply of labour would be
rendered unequal to the cultivation of the appropriated land.<br>
<br>
"2. The sale of all land in the colony at, or above, a fixed
minimum price.<br>
<br>
"This regulation will ensure the concentration of the settlers in
proportion to the price at which the land is sold, and being
adopted by H.M. Government in relation to the colonies already
established in Australia, needs here no comment.<br>
<br>
"3. The employment of the proceeds of such sales in the
conveyance to the colony of young pauper labourers of both sexes
in equal numbers.<br>
<br>
"The selection of the emigrants to be made by the directors of
the company so long as the company shall continue to advance
money to defray the expenses of the government of the colony,
careful regard being had to the ages of the emigrants, who,
generally speaking, should not exceed twenty-five years.<br>
<br>
"4. The minimum price of Government land to be advanced from time
to time as the circumstances of the colony may admit.<br>
<br>
"It is proposed that the first minimum price should be 5s. per
acre: the necessity of such a regulation as this is therefore
apparent. Five shillings an acre will give £100 as the price of
400 acres; this sum would convey to the colony six persons, three
men and three women. The labour of three men is, however,
obviously insufficient for the cultivation of 400 acres of land,
and the advantages which are expected to arise from this plan
cannot be realized in any great degree until the price shall be
so raised as that the purchase money of the 400 acres shall
suffice for the passage of as many labourers as are required to
cultivate it effectively. The precise sum which it would be
expedient to demand as minimum price of land must be left to
experience to determine, but, as artificers of various kind must
be provided for the colony, as well as mere farm-labourers, it is
evident that a considerable increase in the minimum price would
be desirable.<br>
<br>
"The reasons for the low price fixed upon as the minimum price at
first are&mdash;the fact of that being the price of land in the
other Australasian settlements, and the necessity of offering
some premium to the persons who undergo the hardships and incur
the risks of the first settlement, and to give to the company a
sufficient inducement to undertake the expense of founding the
colony.<br>
<br>
"5. A land tax, or a tax upon rent, to be levied from the
commencement of the colony for the purpose of raising a fund in
aid of the expenses of the colony.<br>
<br>
"In those colonies, the population of which is scattered over a
vast extent of territory in proportion to people, and in which
the regulations attending the disposal of waste land have not
been uniform, it has been found difficult to collect a land-tax
or quit rent; but as in the proposed colony the population will
be more concentrated than in the other Australasian colonies, it
is presumed the difficulty and expense of collection will not be
an insurmountable barrier to the imposition of this tax, while
the advantages of direct taxation appear to be such as to justify
the trial.<br>
<br>
"It appears necessary that a charter, embodying the following
provisions, should also be granted to the company, together with
the usual clauses limiting the responsibility of shareholders,
&amp;c.<br>
<br>
"6. The company to have the pre-emption of 1,000,000 of acres to
be selected within a given time at the first minimum price.<br>
<br>
"The inducement to the company to found the colony is this right
of pre-emption at the first minimum price. Having the first
choice of land they will be enabled to select that upon which the
seat of Government will be placed, and that which will form the
sites of the principal towns, as well as any spots which, either
from locality or fertility, may possess a peculiar value. The
profit of the company will arise from the additional value which
the increase of population and growth of capital always confer
upon land, and from the increase in the minimum price at which
the Government land will be sold, while the price paid by the
company for their land will be uniform at whatever period it may
be taken up.<br>
<br>
"The operations of the company in selling land will be wholly
distinct from those of the Government, and will be confined to
their 1,000,000 acres. On this land they will perform such works
as they may deem expedient with a view to attract population
thereto and to Increase its value, while the Government will
sell, in an entirely unimproved state, the land not purchased by
the company to any individual or bodies of individuals who may be
desirous of purchasing it.<br>
<br>
"7. The company to advance from time to time, as may be required,
the money requisite for the government of the colony, such
advances not to exceed £5,000 per annum for the first three years
and £7,500 for any subsequent year not amounting in all to more
than £100,000, the whole to be considered a colonial debt, to be
repaid at such times and in such amounts as may be agreed upon.
In default of such repayment the company to be entitled to the
further choice of land at the minimum price of five shillings per
acre, to an extent equal in value to the amount of such
default.<br>
<br>
"It is proposed that the subscribed capital of the company shall
be £500,000, to be divided into shares of £50 each; one half of
the subscribed capital of the company to be employed in the
purchase of land in the colony from the Government, and the
remaining half to be reserved as a fund for the purpose of
carrying on the government and for the construction of roads,
bridges, wharves, &amp;c., and the foundation of a town or towns,
so far as these latter objects shall be deemed desirable by the
company.<br>
<br>
"8. The Governor and all the officers of the colony to be
appointed by the Crown.<br>
<br>
"It appears highly desirable that the whole power and
responsibility of the Government should devolve upon the Governor
until the colony shall be thought sufficiently advanced to
receive the grant of a legislative assembly.</p>

upon, and after some consultation the following paper was agreed
to be sent to Mr. Whitmore, to be forwarded by him to Mr.
Stanley. The paragraphs in Mr. Stanley's memorandum were
numbered, and to these the numbers below refer.</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"(1) The quantity of land which the company
proposes to purchase of the Government is one million acres, to
be selected between the 132nd and 141st degrees of east

south, which includes the shores of the large inlet known by the
name of Spencer's Gulf, together with the island called Kangaroo
and other islands adjacent.<br>
<br>
"It is deemed proper here to call the attention of His Majesty's
Government to the boundaries of New South Wales, more especially
as the promoters of the colony find it said, in Barrington's "New
South Wales," vol. i., p. 50 (upon what authority, however, is
not known), that on the landing of Governor Philip at New South
Wales, some document (whether a Royal Commission or Letters
Patent is uncertain) was read by the Governor, by which the
colony was found to extend as far westward as the 135th degree of
east longitude, including the adjacent islands.<br>
<br>
"It is hoped that no impediment will arise through this
circumstance to the foundation of the colony on the site
proposed, as, if the boundary of New South Wales should be
considered as unchangeably fixed by the declaration alluded to,
the proposed colony would be deprived of every safe harbour
hitherto discovered on that part of the Australian continent, and
no inducement would remain for founding the proposed colony. It
is, moreover, suggested that no injury would be done to any
individual in New South Wales by the boundary being altered <i>if
it has been considered settled</i>. On the contrary, that great
benefit would arise to every resident in that colony by the
settlement of what cannot yet be said to be even their actual
frontier.<br>
<br>
"(2) The promoters of this plan acquiesce in this proposition,
subject to the provision that in the event of the plan of
founding the colony being at any time relinquished, or of the
colony, if founded, being given up, the company shall not be
liable to the continuance of the annual payment hereinafter
mentioned; but in either of such events, the expense of removing
the emigrants who had been taken to the colony through the medium
of the company, to the nearest settlement, to be borne by the
company.<br>
<br>
"The payment for the land to be made by instalments, and to be
extended over a period of fifteen years.<br>
<br>
"(3) The committee are of opinion that if by "a corresponding
sum" be meant a sum equal to the purchase money of the land, it
would be very difficult, if not impracticable, to raise a capital
for the purpose. They propose that the money to be advanced for
the maintenance of the civil government should not exceed £7,500
per annum for the first three years, nor £10,000 for any
following year, and that such advance shall cease with the
payment of the last instalment for the land.<br>
<br>
"(4) The proposal of a land-tax is founded on the considerations:
(1) That such an impost would serve as a check to speculative
purchasers of land, the object being to get the land into
cultivation as soon after purchase as possible, and more
especially as an advantageous means of raising revenue. This tax
is proposed not to be levied until the colony has been founded
three years.<br>
<br>
"It is clearly understood, however, that the payment of the civil
government of the colony is not to be considered as depending for
support upon this tax. The company are security to the
Government, and whatever sum the company may receive by the
adoption of the tax in question will be a credit in favour of the
colony against the company.<br>
<br>
"(5) Interest at 5 per cent, per annum to be computed upon the
several sums advanced from the respective times of advancing
them, such interest to become principal when the whole principal
shall have been advanced. Repayment of the aggregate sum to be
made to the company by annual instalments of not less than 10 per
cent., and such part of the aggregate sura as may from time to
time remain unpaid to bear simple interest of £5 per cent., to be
paid in like manner. In default of payment in money, payment to
be made in land as proposed.<br>
<br>
"(6) If one particular form of worship is to be established, the
unfairness to all those who do not agree with that particular
creed or form of Church discipline, is apparent. "While the
promoters of this object agree in thinking that religious
teaching and other instruction is most important, they feel
convinced that these objects will be best promoted by leaving
their execution to the colonists themselves, who will thus avoid
a source of much contention.<br>
<br>
"(7) It is considered particularly desirable that the proposed
colony should not be subjected to an incorporation with any other
colony, especially on the ground of assuring those who may
contemplate settling in the colony, that it could not become a
penal settlement; it is therefore suggested that its
consolidation with any other colony should not take place unless
it should fail in paying its own expenses."</p>
<p>More than a month elapsed without any reply whatever being
received from Mr. Stanley in acknowledgment of the foregoing
paper, and Mr. Gouger, therefore, addressed the following letter
to Mr. Whitmore.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><span class="a">Mr. Gouger</span> <em>to</em>

"<span class="u">London</span>, <i>October</i> 9<i>th</i>,
1833.</div>
<p class="quote">"<span class="u">Dear Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
"I begin to be very anxious to obtain a reply to the paper which
Mr. Heathfield forwarded to you on the 14th of last month with a
view, if you approved of it, to its being sent to Mr. Stanley.
This gentleman is at present in London, and as his time is now
more devoted to the details of his office than it can be expected
to be during the sitting of Parliament, this would appear to be
the time to induce him to examine the subject closely, and to
decide upon it. The heads of Mr. Stanley's memorandum approximate
so closely to the propositions of the committee, that but little
correspondence seems now necessary, and I therefore am led to
hope that much time need not be consumed in completing the
arrangements.<br>
<br>
"The receipt of Mr. Stanley's memorandum has caused me to change
my plan as to leaving England, and I therefore remain here solely
to occupy myself in promoting the foundation of the new colony.
Since I had the pleasure of seeing you, I have been fortunate
enough to procure for the measure the support of some influential
persons besides those whom you have seen, and every day confirms
me more strongly in the opinion of ample means being procured to
carry out the scheme so soon as Mr. Stanley shall enable us to go
before the public. Indeed, the present moment seems to me
particularly favourable for raising money for any feasible
project. The several companies now forming for banks and
railroads find little difficulty in getting their shares taken.
Excuse me, therefore, if I seem impatient of delay. Will your
addressing a letter to him, or my seeing him for the purpose of
laying before him evidence as to the soil and harbours, tend to
remind him of the application, and, perhaps, induce him to
examine it? If so, may I request you to send me a note to deliver
to him? Again, my seeing him might perhaps lead to a conversation
upon various parts of the plan, and so prevent a lengthened
correspondence.<br>
<br>
"In the course of a few days I hope to send you a paper on the
effect which the formation of new colonies by means of land
companies may have on the pour rates: this I am preparing for the
Poor Law Commissioners, and it will form a part of their
Appendix.<br>
<br>
"I fear Mr. Heathfield's assistance cannot be retained for the
company, as he is appointed to the management of a railroad
company.".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Mr. Whitmore having replied on October 11th, that "he was too
well aware of the full occupation of Mr. Stanley's time to urge
an interview," there was nothing to do but to wait.</p>
<p>It was a relief from official discouragement for Mr. Gouger to
receive a cheery letter at this time from his brother Henry, who
possessed considerable influence in India, and took a warm
interest in Robert's colonial schemes:&mdash;</p>

"I have read attentively the pamphlets you sent me touching the
formation of a colony at Spencer's Gulph. If carried into effect,
I have no doubt the colony would receive considerable assistance
from the emigration of men who have made a competence in India,
who generally prefer retiring to a more temperate climate when
their means admit of such a change. I know myself many who would
prefer settling in Van Diemen's Land to returning to England,
were they not deterred by the state of society naturally
consequent on a convict population. Should your scheme succeed,
too, we shall not see the Indian ships returning to England,
full, as they sometimes now are, with officers in the company's
service, on leave to the Cape of Good Hope. These invalid
gentlemen would generally prefer such a settlement as yours on
the South Coast of Australia, where they could reside without
infringing the regulations, which do not allow them to reside to
the westward of the Cape under forfeiture of pay. These, as well
as your resident settlers from India, would be numerous, I have
no doubt. Of the latter you can i'orm some idea from the number
now residing in Sydney and Van Diemen's Land, even in the face of
such inconvenience as I have alluded to.<br>

<p>The next entry in the Journal is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>November</i> 27<i>th</i>, 1833.&mdash;From
the date of Mr. Whitmore's letter to the present time no very
important step was taken towards founding the colony, with the
exception of the publication of 'England and America,' which has
been favourably reviewed in many papers, (No answer from Mr.
Stanley, nor has any intimation been received of his feeling on
the subject.) On this the rooms at 4, Adam Street, Adelphi, were
taken, and the following circular was distributed:</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><span class="u">South Australia.</span></p>
<p class="quote">"<span class="u">Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
"I have the honour to inform you that an association, or
temporary society, has been formed for the purpose of
establishing a chartered colony at Spencer's Gulph, on the South
Coast of Australia, on the novel plan suggested by the
Colonisation Society, and lately adopted by the Government as to
New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land; that a negotiation with
His Majesty's Government for obtaining a charter for the colony,
similar to the charters under which Virginia, the Carolinas,
Maryland, and Pennsylvania were founded, though suddenly broken
off last year, has been renewed, and with the prospect of a
favourable termination, and that the society desire to obtain
your countenance and assistance in whatever degree or manner you
may be disposed to forward this public undertaking.<br>
<br>
"By becoming a member of the Society and taking an interest in
their proceedings, you would not incur any pecuniary or other
responsibility, since no subscription is required, and it is
understood that the society shall consist of three distinct
classes of persons: Those who may intend to settle in the colony;
those who may chose to become trustees for laying the foundation
of the colony (as in the case of all our old and successful
colonies in America); and others who, from public motives, may
wish to patronise a great national work, independently of
personal objects and without any personal responsibility.<br>
<br>
"For the present the society will have rooms at 4, Adam Street,
Adelphi, where some member will be found at all times; where
those may meet who are inclined to take the most active part;
where full information may be obtained concerning the soil,
climate, and situation of the proposed colony; the plan according
to which it is to be formed; and the state of the negotiation
with His Majesty's Government.</p>

<p class="quote">"<i>November</i> 27<i>th</i>, 1833."</p>
<br>
<p>It will be seen, that by this time Mr. Gouger had made up his
mind that further negotiations with the Colonial Office as to the
establishment of a Joint Stock Land Company were impossible. He
could not brook the vexatious delays which prevented him from
"striking his iron while it was hot;" he saw some of his best
supporters wavering because of the hard conditions suggested by
the Government, and he could not himself see how to overcome one
of those conditions, namely, "that the company must be bound to
purchase the whole of its land by fixed instalments within a
given period."</p>
<p>Negotiations with the Government were therefore again broken
off, but not before he had formed a farther plan for carrying
forward his cherished scheme of founding a colony in South
Australia.</p>
<p>It was for the furtherance of this new plan that the rooms
were taken in the Adelphi, and the circular, given above, was
issued.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<h4>THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATION.</h4>
<p><span class="a">When</span> the idea of starting "The South
Australian Association" forced itself on Mr. Gouger's mind, he
was anxious to proceed at once to its formation, and as a
preliminary step to call a public meeting in order to make the
matter known. He went so far as to obtain the promise of many
influential men to attend it, and his labours were incessant in
working up an interest in the new movement; but, as Christmas was
near at hand, it was decided to postpone the meeting until the
New Year, he guaranteeing to prepare in the meantime a sketch of
the prospectus, and others of the temporary sub-committee to
prepare evidence as to the soil and general capabilities of the
colony.</p>
<p>A few extracts from the Journal will show his activity towards
the close of this year of disappointment and fruitless
labour.</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>November</i> 28<i>th</i>, 1833.&mdash;Saw
Mr. Pottinger, a gentleman introduced by Mr. Richard Norman, and
who is anxious to go to Australia. He proposes to take out with
him about sixty families from Ireland, residents on his estates
there, and about £20,000.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;The sub-committee appointed to
arrange the evidence appear desirous of omitting a considerable
part of it. To this I object, on the principle of being candid,
by way of disarming opponents.<br>
<br>
"In a conversation upon the mode of procedure after the charter
should be obtained, and upon the first expedition, its resources,
&amp;c., Mr. Pottinger offered, in case the necessary funds could
not be readily procured, to make an advance of them upon the
faith of being repaid, with interest, when the colony should be
established, or when the trustees had effected the required
loans.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Pottinger proposed to get,
through the medium of Lords Bexley and Roden, the sanction of the
Bishop of London to the plan of the colony, and his name as
patron of a society for founding and endowing a church.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Rowland Hill called to say he
had conversed with his brother Matthew about the colony, and that
he would willingly give it his assistance if, on close
examination of the details, he approved of them. I offered to
Rowland Hill the management of the thing at home, provided he
would undertake to work assiduously with us now in getting the
plan ready.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Captain Hill called at the
office; he approves fully of the plan intended to be pursued, and
proposes to join the first party of emigrants. He said that he
would join anybody in the purchase of an exploring vessel to the
amount of £1,000, and would undertake the command of the
ship.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Called on Abraham Borradaile,
who approved fully of the prospectus and of the plan of the
Association. He would not, however, allow his name to be placed
on the committee, in consequence of the great number of
<i>Radicals</i> whose names appeared there. When some moderate
persons should appear to sanction the measure, he would then add
his name.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Called on Grote, and had a
long conversation with him, at the termination of which he said
he would be a member of the committee on two conditions; first,
that his name should not be published without his seeing that the
list of the committee was strong enough almost to compel the
Ministers to grant the charter; and, secondly, that no person
should be invited to be on the committee, excepting those persons
whose names he then saw.... Proposed at the office that the
persons who intended to emigrate should form a committee, or a
society, for the following, purposes: getting up a little land
company, to be confined to the colonists as subscribers; forming
a society for building a church and paying a clergyman; another
for building a chapel (if need be) and for paying a parson; and
another society for establishing schools, and setting on foot a
subscription for procuring a colonial library. This I recommended
Hanson to take the management of, and he
consented.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>
<br>
<p>Day after day the Journal bears witness to the unremitting
toll of Mr. Gouger in the prosecution of his work. Morning, noon,
and night, day after day, his one consuming thought was to make
known the principles upon which he hoped to found the colony and
to obtain influential supporters. Here follows an entry of one
day's work, a specimen of many, which need not be
recorded:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>December</i> 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Called on
Montefiore, who said he would join the committee on the
understanding that he pledged himself to nothing at present
except a general approval and support of the measure. On
Borradaile without seeing him. On Mangles, who was out, but I
left him a note with the prospectus, saying I would call early in
the week. On Senior, who said he would join the committee on the
understanding that he was not to be called upon to devote much
time to the measure. He would see John Lefevre and Stephen, and
endeavour to get them to view the matter favourably. On Buller,
who now allowed his name to be used, and would endeavour to get
the Bishop of Llandaff to give his sanction to the project. He
also promised to write to his uncle, a Tory, for the same
purpose. Received a letter from Poulett Scrope, saying that he
would belong to the committee and give the measure all the
assistance in his power. Peter Peachy called, and entertains some
idea of forming one of the first
settlers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><span class="a">G. Poulett Scrope, M.P.,</span>

<div class="quote" style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">
"<i>December</i> 12<i>th</i>, 1833.</div>
<p class="quote">"<span class="u">Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
"I am much indebted to you for the obliging terms in which you
have communicated to me the proposal that I should join the
association for encouraging the formation of a new colony in
Southern Australia.<br>
<br>
"I have felt the strongest interest in the progress and prospects
of the National Colonisation Society from its first commencement;
though, from having been hitherto rarely in town for any
considerable period, I have abstained from introducing myself to
its principal supporters.<br>
<br>
"I may say, too, that though I believe I formerly differed
something from you as to the extent to which the principle of
concentration ought to be enforced by putting a very high price
on waste lands, we approximate now, I believe, very closely
indeed in our views; and if the principles of that exceedingly
able and powerfully written work "England and America" are to be
understood as those of the society, I think I can profess an
almost complete accordance with them.<br>
<br>
"It will therefore be very agreeable to me, should the gentlemen
composing the provisional committee of the South Australian
Association think fit to admit me as a fellow labourer. In which
case, when Parliament meets, I hope to be able to take an active
part in promoting the objects of the society.</p>

"<span class="u">G. Poulett Scrope</span>.</div>
<p class="quote">"<span class="u">R. Gouger, Esq.</span>"</p>
<br>
<p>It was the absorbing wish of Mr. Gouger to form the
provisional committee and to issue the prospectus before the end
of the year, and he left no stone unturned with this view. The
Journal continues:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>December</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Rowland and
Matthew Hill called to talk upon the measure. The first of these
has some difficulty in fixing his name to the prospectus as
secretary in consequence of the Bruce Castle Establishment, but
he nevertheless is desirous to have the office. Hanson read a
paper at the rooms which he had written as a preface to the
evidence as to the soil. This was adopted by the committee.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Parkes wishes to take other
and better rooms and to get up a larger subscription. Romilly
fully approves the measure, but will speak to Grote upon the
subject before he decidedly gives his name. Grote thinks the
committee will be strong enough to come before the public when
the acquiescence of Strutt, Warburton and Romilly shall have been
obtained.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In a conversation upon a church
establishment, it was agreed that an attempt should be made to
found a society for building a church, and to set this on foot,
Mr. Pottinger offered to subscribe £50.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Saw Hume with Pottinger. Hume
approves entirely of the plan, and appeared pleased at having an
opportunity of declaring how much he was in error upon the
subject two or three years ago when I conversed with him. He
understands now the whole subject, sees that the only chance of
failure in our plans is the difficulty of keeping labourers, and
proposes, if we cannot get £2 an acre put upon land as the
minimum price, to have a very high fee upon transfer. This, he
thinks,, may prevent labourers buying a small lot and then
subdividing it. He will not belong to the committee, but will
support the scheme in Parliament and out.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Pottinger informs me that
Richard Norman is willing to advance the whole of the funds
required for the undertaking, and that he wishes to converse with
me on the subject. Pottinger showed me letters he had received
from Lords Downshire and Donegal. Rowland Hill called to say that
Dr. Birkbeck could not join the committee in consequence of
ill-health, but that Dr. Southwood Smith would do so and give the
association all the assistance in his power. Dined at my
brother's in company with Mr. Shand, &amp;c. My brother seems
disposed to do much as Norman has offered: he sees that money may
be made by a spirited adoption of the plan by any capitalist.
Shand says that many persons from India will join the colony if
it should be established.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 21<i>st</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; Saw Warburton.
The only difficulty which occurred to his mind was relative to
the pecuniary responsibility of the
trustees.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He has read 'England and America,'
and spoke very pointedly against the old system of
<i>granting</i>, and in favour of the present mode of
<i>selling</i> land. He approves entirely of the plan, and will
give it his warm support. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; Captains Hudson
and Currie called. The latter was with Stirling at the first
landing at Swan River, and condemned much the plan then pursued
of landing on Garden Island. If they had landed on the mainland
at first they would have saved three months' time.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; Colonel Torrens signified through D.
Wakefield his assent to belonging to the Provisional Committee.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; To obviate the difficulty of keeping
labourers from becoming very soon landowners, Pottinger proposes
to oblige all persons to procure a license to trade or to occupy
land. The cost of the license to be £6.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 23<i>rd</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Called on
Norman and had a long conversation with him on the plan, and
finally on his undertaking, to raise the necessary money and to
become agent for the colony. I mentioned 8 per cent. as the
interest I recommended to be paid, and pointed out the extent of
shipping business which he would have if he adopted the
proposition.<br>
<br>
"December 24<i>th</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Saw Hanson's proof,
and found that he and Pottinger had determined to print Hanson's
paper instead of Wakefield's. The reason Pottinger assigned for
this is that the question of drought is discussed in Wakefield's
paper, which is unnecessary, as it is not believed that the
circumstance of drought influences South
Australia.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Dr. Lang called and reported that
land in the Bathurst Plains lets for £1 an acre per annum, and
that a friend of his purchased 4,000 acres, 160 miles from
Sydney, for 15s. per acre.<br>
<br>
"December 26<i>th</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The first meeting of
the Provisional Committee was held; Grote in the chair, and
present: Clay, Mills, Romilly, Hawes, Melville, Rowland and
Matthew Hill, Roebuck, Norman, Pottinger, Gowan, Torrens, and
Southwood Smith. Everything went off as well as possible. Grote
kept the meeting to business, and made an admirable chairman. The
prospectus was passed, with the addition of Clause XIII.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; Thus the first step, upon which so much
depends, is taken, and that without
fear.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p class="quote">"The object of this association is to found a
colony, under Royal Charter, and without convict labour, at or
near Spencer's Gulph, on the south coast of Australia, a tract of
country far removed from the existing penal settlements.<br>
<br>
"For raising funds wherewith to remove people to a distant place,
as well as to establish and maintain social order in the colony,
making provision for defence, for the security of persons and
property, and for the education of the colonists, some authority
is required. When the 'heroic work,' to use an expression of Lord
Bacon, of planting a colony, and converting a desert into the
abode of civilised society, is undertaken by the Government of
the Mother Country, the requisite authority exists. But
individuals cannot extend society to distant places without
forming a compact amongst themselves, and obtaining some
guarantee for its being observed. All the old and most successful
British colonies in America&mdash;Virginia, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and
Georgia&mdash;were founded by individuals whose public spirit,
prudence, and resolution were not otherwise assisted by the
Government of this country, than as a charter from the Crown
erected each of those bodies of individuals into a corporation,
with the authority required for accomplishing, to use the words
of several of those charters, 'their generous and noble
purpose.'<br>
<br>
"In this respect, the South Australian Association, confiding in
the paternal goodness of his present Majesty, and trusting that
their undertaking will be favourably viewed by an enlightened and
liberal administration, will endeavour to follow the example of
the London and Plymouth companies, which founded Virginia; of
William Penn and his companions, who founded Pennsylvania; of
Lord Baltimore and his associates, who founded Maryland; and of
Lord Perceval and his co-trustees, who established the colony of
Georgia.<br>
<br>
"The following extracts from the Georgian Charter will, in some
measure, explain the objects of the South Australian Association,
and the means by which it is proposed to accomplish
them:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"George the Second, &amp;c., to all to whom these
presents shall come, greeting. Whereas we are credibly informed
that many of our poor subjects are, through misfortunes and want
of employment, reduced to great necessities, insomuch as by their
labour they are not able to provide a maintenance for themselves
and families; and if they had means to defray their charge of
passage, and the expenses incident to new settlements, they would
be glad to be settled in any of our provinces in America, where,
by cultivating the lands at present waste and desolate, they
might not only gain a comfortable subsistence for themselves and
families, but also strengthen our colonies, and increase the
trade, navigation, and wealth of these our
realms:.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"And whereas we think it highly becoming our Crown and royal
dignity to protect all our loving subjects, be they never so
distant from us, to extend our fatherly compassion even to the
meanest and most unfortunate of our people, and to relieve the
wants of our above-mentioned poor subjects; and that it will be
highly conducive for accomplishing those ends that a regular
colony of the said poor people be settled and established in the
southern frontiers of Carolina; and whereas we have been well
assured, that if we would be most graciously pleased to erect and
settle a Corporation for the receiving, managing, and disposing
of the contributions of our loving subjects, divers persons woula
be induced to contribute to the uses and purposes aforesaid:<br>
<br>
"Know ye, therefore, that we have, for the considerations
aforesaid, and for the better and more orderly carrying on the
said good purposes, of our special grace, certain knowledge, and
mere motion, willed, ordained, constituted, and appointed, and by
these presents, for us, our heirs and successors, do will,
ordain, constitute, declare, and grant, that our right trusty and
well-beloved John Lord Viscount Perceval, &amp;c., &amp;c., and
such other persons as shall be elected in the manner hereinafter
mentioned, and their successors to be elected in manner as
hereinafter is directed, be, and shall be one body politic and
corporate, in deed and in name, by the name of <span class=
"u">The Trustees for establishing the Colony of Georgia in
America</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"And we do hereby for us, our heirs and successors, give and
grant unto the said Corporation and their successors, full power
and authority to constitute, ordain and make, so many bye-laws,
constitutions, orders, and ordinances as to them, or the greater
part of them at their general meeting for that purpose, shall
seem meet, necessary, and convenient for the well ordering and
governing of the said Corporation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"And we do hereby for us, our heirs and successors, ordain, will,
and establish, that for and during the term of one-and-twenty
years, from the date of these our letters patent, the said
Corporation assembled for that purpose shall, and may, form and
prepare, laws, statutes, and ordinances, fit and necessary for,
and concerning the government of the said colony, and not
repugnant to the laws and statutes of England; and the same shall
and may present under their common seal to us, our heirs and
successors, in our or their privy council, for our or their
approbation or disallowance; and the said laws, statutes and
ordinances being approved by us, our heirs and successors, in our
or their privy council, shall from thenceforth be in full force
and virtue, within our said province of
Georgia.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"And our will and pleasure is that the common council of the said
Corporation for the time being, or the major part of them, who
shall be present, being assembled for that purpose, shall from
time to time, for, during and until the end and expiration of
twenty-one years to commence from the date of these our letters
patent, have full power and authority to nominate, make,
constitute, commission, ordain and appoint, by such name or
names, style or styles as to them shall seem meet and fitting all
and singular, such governors, judges, magistrates, ministers and
officers, civil and military, both by sea and land, within the
said district, as shall by them be thought fit and needful, to be
made or used for the government of the said colony (save always
and except such officers only as shall by us, our heirs and
successors, be from time to time constituted and appointed for
the managing, collecting and receiving, such revenues as shall
from time to time arise within the said province of Georgia, and
become due to us our heirs and successors),* provided always and
it is our will and pleasure that every governor of the said
province of Georgia to be appointed by the common council of the
said Corporation, before he shall enter upon or execute the said
office of Governor, shall be approved of by us, our heirs or
successors, and shall take such oaths, and shall qualify himself
in such manner in shall respects as any Governor or
Commander-in-chief of any of our colonies or plantations in
America are by law required to do.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* This exception occurs in several of the
Charters, and seems to have had for object the control of the
Home Government over the foreign trade of the Colony&mdash;a
power usually reserved by the King under the old system of
colonial trade.]</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"The South Australian Association consists of
three Classes of Members. First, Persons who propose to settle in
the colony: Secondly, Persons willing to aid the Association
without taking a responsible part in the proceedings: Thirdly,
Persons who may take an active part in the preliminary
proceedings of the Association, and may become, under the
proposed Charter, Trustees for carrying its provisions into
effect.<br>
<br>
"The Provisional Committee, of which a list appears above, is
divided into Sub-committees for particular objects, such as
preparing a draft of the proposed Charter; communicating with His
Majesty's Government; procuring and publishing information
relating to the soil, climate, and other natural circumstances of
the South Coast of Australia, and communicating with and
promoting concert amongst those who may propose to be the first
settlers in the new colony.<br>
<br>
"It is desired that the Charter of Incorporation may contain
provisions (amongst others) to the following effect:<br>
<br>
"I. The colony to be erected into a province under the name of
South Australia, extending from the 132nd to the 141st degree of
east longitude, and from the south coast, including the adjacent
islands, to the tropic of Capricorn.<br>
<br>
"II. The whole of the territory within the above limits to be
open to settlement by British subjects.<br>
<br>
"in. Provided that within the said limits, no waste or public
land shall become private property, save by one means only: viz.,
by purchase at a fixed minimum price, or as much above that price
as the competition of public auction may determine.<br>
<br>
"IV. Provided also that, subject to the above restriction, and to
the necessity of previous surveys, all persons, whether residing
in the colony or Great Britain, shall be free to acquire property
in waste or public land, in fee, and without limit, either as to
quantity or situation.<br>
<br>
"V. That the management of the surveys and sales of waste or
public land be confided to a responsible Board, with the best
provisions for constant publicity in their proceedings.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Considering that the power over the proportion
between the inhabitants of a country and the territory at their
disposal exerts a most important influence on the value of land,
capital, and labour, complete responsibility and publicity appear
quite necessary.]</p>
<p class="quote">"VI. The Corporation of Trustees to have
authority for enabling individuals, whether residing in Britain
or in the colony, to subscribe money into a joint stock for the
purpose of buying waste or public land.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** This provision will, it is conceived, be most
useful. Without some such provision, either the Corporation of
Trustees must, in order to the commodious laying out of the first
town and of roads, whereby to connect it with the interior,
become a Land Company, and purchase a large block of land with a
view to profit; or individuals might, by making purchases in the
situation most favourable for a town, not only create a monopoly
price of land near the seat of government and centre of commerce,
but might altogether prevent the observance of method and
regularity in laying the foundation of the future capital.
Whereas, if the first body of emigrating capitalists were enabled
to combine their funds, and to purchase a large tract of land in
the most favourable situation for the first town, it would be for
the interest of each and all of the owners of that favourable
situation to lay out the ground for a town in the most convenient
and ornamental manner, and at first to sell town lots at a very
moderate price, with a view to the increase in the value of
adjoining lots. It is in this way, generally, that towns are
formed in new American settlements; many combining to do that in
the best way, which separated individuals could not do at all. On
this account it was at one time intended that the South
Australian Association should be a Joint Stock Land Company as
well as a body politic; but the intention has been abandoned on
the ground that the Corporation of Trustees ought not to be
engaged in any pecuniary speculation, and that companies for the
purchase of land in the colony may be formed under the authority
given to the association. In America the formation of such
companies is greatly facilitated by the Government.]</p>
<p class="quote">"VII. That the whole of the purchase-money of
waste or public land, after defraying the necessary cost of
surveys and sales, be employed in conyeying British labourers to
the colony.<br>
<br>
"VIII. That the emigrants conveyed to the colony with the
purchase-money of waste land be of the two sexes in equal
numbers, and that the Corporation be bound to give a preference
amongst the applicants for a passage cost free to young married
persons not having children; so that for any given outlay of
their money, the purchasers of land may obtain the greatest
amount of labour wherewith to cultivate the land, and of
population to enhance its value.<br>
<br>
"IX. That until the colony be settled, and the sales of waste or
public land shall have produced an immigration fund, adequate to
the want of labour in the colony, the Corporation of Trustees
have authority to raise money on loan by the issue of bonds or
otherwise, bearing colonial interest, for the purpose of
conveying selected labourers to the colony; so that the first
body of emigrating capitalists going out to buy land may from the
first be supplied with labour. And that until such loan or loans
be repaid with interest, the Corporation be held bound to apply
all the net proceeds of the sales of land in repayment of such
loans.<br>
<br>
"X. That for defraying the necessary expenses of the Corporation
and Colonial Government, the trustees have authority to raise
money on loan by the issue of bonds or otherwise, and that
provided the said expenditure do not exceed
£&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the whole, the amount thereof
shall be deemed a colonial debt, and secured upon the entire
revenue of the colony.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* It is thus provided that this colony shall be
founded and maintained without any expense whatever to the
Government of the Mother Country.]</p>
<p class="quote">"XI. That, as in the case of our old colonies in
America, of the company for founding Sierra Leone, and of the
East India Company, the Corporation of Trustees have authority to
frame and administer regulations or laws for the maintenance of
order, the protection of persons and property, and other objects
of local government.<br>
<br>
"XII. That the said authority of the Corporation of Trustees
shall continue until the colony, having, like all the chartered
colonies of Britain, a local legislative assembly, shall have
paid off its debt to the Corporation of Trustees, and shall
undertake to defray the whole cost of its future government and
protection.<br>
<br>
"XIII. That the trustees shall be protected against personal
liability."</p>

association <i>desired</i>, and it had to be altered in many
important particulars as time went on.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<h4>IN SUSPENSE.</h4>
<p><span class="a">The</span> year 1834 opened well for Mr.
Gouger; the Provisional Committee had got into working order, the
prospectus had been successfully launched, and the Press had
favourably reviewed it. But there were prophets in those days,
and some of them saw rocks ahead! The <i>Spectator</i> * which
had been faithful throughout to Mr. Gouger and his schemes,
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* January 4th, 1834.]</p>
<p>"A body of gentlemen, surpassed by none in sagacity,
business-like habits, or weight of character, have undertaken to
plant a colony on the South Coast of Australia. The project may
be considered a revival of that which, more than a year since,
occupied the South Australian Company, with Mr. Wolryche Whitmore
at their head, and was defeated by Mr. Hay, the Tory
Under-Secretary for the Colonies. In the present case it appears
that the committee are in direct communication with the Principal
Secretary, Mr. Stanley, who, besides never having been a Tory,
has visited Canada and the United States, and is just the sort of
man not to let an underling decide for him. Mr. Hay is the Tory
bum-bureaucrat (permanent official) of the Colonial Office. He,
no doubt, will, as before, strive to <i>prevent</i> the formation
of a colony which is to be governed at a cheap rate, to defray
the whole cost of its government, and to be governed in local
matters by the colonists themselves. But we doubt whether he will
be able to lead Mr. Stanley by the nose as he led Lord Goderich.
Mr. Stanley's knowledge of colonies, with his undoubted talents
and industry, will enable him to appreciate the greatness of the
present undertaking as an experiment in the art of colonisation.
If he should do this&mdash;which, indeed. Lord Goderich did while
he thought for himself&mdash;he will decide accordingly; and
having promised to let the colony proceed to its destination, he
will keep his word&mdash;which Lord Goderich did not as to a
similar promise. In short, Mr. Stanley, notwithstanding some
defects of temper, is a man; while Lord Goderich, with the most
amiable disposition, is, begging his pardon, and speaking
politically, 'an old woman.' We may, therefore, congratulate the
new association on the removal of Lord Goderich to the sinecure
of the Privy Seal."</p>
<p>In concluding a long article, the Spectator commented on the
"Very judicious statement of the objects of the South Australian
Association," as given in the prospectus, and commended it to all
who desired that colonisation should be pursued systematically,
with a view to raising the profits of capital and wages of
labour, by a great and continual enlargement of our field of
production. The article concluded thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The men who have undertaken to found the colony are not wild
projectors; nor have they, we are confident, merely lent their
names to a wild project. They are, most of them, public men with
a high character to sustain; and they have not embarked in this
important work without a sense of the heavy responsibility
incurred in their engagement with the public. Here, then, is an
opening such as never was presented before, to young men and
heads of families in the middle class, who, with the sense to
perceive the difficulties that beset their order in England, may
have the courage to decide on being amongst the founders of a
society in which no such difficulties can exist. To thousands who
answer to this description we recommend the prospectus of the
association."</p>
<p>Mr. Gouger's Journal for January in this year is the record of
a bewildering amount of labour, almost inconceivable to any one
but an enthusiast, who, having put his hand to the plough, will
not turn his head for a moment to halt or to look back. There
were, of course, as in all new associations, minor dissensions to
be appeased, little ruggednesses to be smoothed over, prejudices
to be overcome, and endless suggestions to be considered. In
addition, there was an overwhelming amount of clerical labour to
be performed; advertisements to be sent out, letters to editors
of newspapers to be written, constant attendance to be given at
the office of the association to answer inquiries and give
detailed information about the colony and the immediate prospects
of intending emigrants, while batches of letters were received
from all parts of the country asking for information or
exploiting new ideas.</p>
<p>Under the strain Mr. Gouger took one day's rest, but the entry
in the Journal on the following day was, "Returned to town,
where, in consequence of a day's absence, the affairs of the
office were getting into confusion."</p>
<p>During the first fortnight of January no fewer than
twenty-eight capitalists, heads of families, representing
eighty-nine souls, had determined to go to the colony so soon as
arrangements could be made, defraying, of course, their own cost
of passage. And during the same period a host of clergymen and
ministers, physicians and surgeons, engineers and architects,
made applications for "posts" in the new land of promise.</p>
<p>One of the subjects which at this time pressed upon the
attention of the committee was, what to do with intending
colonists who were waiting to go out, and another, what steps
should be taken to meet the "religious difficulty" of
establishing churches and chapels. These subjects, among others,
are touched upon in the following extracts from Mr. Gouger's
Journal:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>January</i> 9<i>th</i>, 1834.&mdash;It was
proposed to form, a society of colonists in aid of the
Provisional Committee; the objects of the society to be, to
gather information upon all subjects likely to occupy the
attention of the Committee. Pottinger to-day has had a
conversation with Mr. Earle, Mr. Stanley's secretary, and the
result was very satisfactory. Mr. Earle says that the charter
will be obtained if it can be shown that the Government is to be
put to no expense, and if the money for the execution of the
project is procured<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Called on Parkes. He was just
come from Ellice, who has given him much information relative to
the charters of the Hudson's Bay and other companies. With the
letters of introduction Ellice has given him, he will be able to
obtain for Wakefield all the precedents he requires. Ellice has
promised to do all he can privately to influence Stanley in our
favour, and says he sees no reason why he should not succeed. I
showed Parkes a proof of the Church Society paper, which he likes
much.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 15<i>th</i>&mdash;Rowland Hill agrees to work
with me on the conditions that his name is not advertised as
secretary, and that his brother may supply his place in case he
may be unwell.<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;The Church Society paper
printed. The meeting of the provisional committee called for
to-day was held, and was a complete scene of turmoil in
consequence of some crotchets of Hawes'. He proposed that all
proceedings should be stopped until the Government had consented
to grant the charter. This was echoed by Borradaile and
Montefiore, who, together with Hawes, talked about the fact of
money having been asked for, for the purposes of the Committee.
This led to reading the letters of Romilly and Senior, who had
declined continuing on the Committee in consequence of the call
for money. Clay and Grote stopped this by saying that if more
money were required they would willingly subscribe again, and
they had no idea of entering upon a thing of this kind without
contributing towards the expenses.<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;I recommended to sub-committee
a protest against application to Stanley before a large body of
colonists should be procured to accompany the paper which they
might prepare.<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;In consequence of the feeling
in the committee of last Thursday relative to advertising being
delayed, I wrote Grote a letter begging him to take a decided
course. Just as it was going off he came in, and we had a long
talk upon the subject. We agreed in wishing that the
communication with Government should not be put in until (1) the
money was certain; (2) until a strong body of colonists was
obtained; (3) until the Church Society was got up; (4) until
Whitmore and Scrope came to town. Wrote to the Bishop of London,
requesting him to accept the office of patron to the society, and
to appoint clergymen. Called on Currie, who would be a member of
the Church Society, and allow subscriptions to be received at his
house."</p>
<br>
<p>The "South Australian Church Society," to which many
references have been made in Mr. Gouger's Journal, was warmly
advocated by Mr. Whitmore&mdash;who was chairman of the
provisional committee&mdash;and by Messrs. Raikes Currie, John
Labouchere, and Pascoe St. Leger Grenfell, who were on the
permanent committee.</p>
<p>In their prospectus it was stated that, "Amongst those who,
with their families, propose to settle in the new colony, are
some dissenters from the Church of England, and they are engaged
in raising funds for the purpose of establishing their mode of
worship. The emigrating members of the Church of England, also,
are most anxious that the faith and discipline to which they
subscribe should be planted from the very beginning, and
preserved for their children by means of a sufficient religious
establishment. With this view, they are prepared to contribute
towards a fund, to be vested in trustees, for the purposes of
building churches and clergymen's houses, and supporting
clergymen in the colony."</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>January</i> 21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Saw Mills,
and reported to him the state of the association, and begged him
to allow advertisements to be inserted. He clearly saw the
desirableness of this, and promised to vote in favour of my
views. Received a very warm letter from Carrie in favour of the
Church Society.<br>
<br>
"Went to Elliot [of the Colonial Office] and told him exactly our
present condition, the reasons for not applying to Government,
and the fear we entertained of being thrown over if we went to
Government without being fully prepared. After hearing and
considering the matter fully, he decided in favour of going to
Stanley immediately, and for this reason: that he knew Stanley's
tone of mind to be such as to induce him to decide upon the thing
itself, unswayed by the fact of having a body of colonists, or by
the outcry they might make if he refused the measure. The general
feeling in the Colonial Office was, that we should get the
charter, and he mentioned as an important fact in our favour,
that the Australian colonies had been, <i>since our
advertisement</i>, removed from Mr. Hay's superintendence to Mr.
Lefevre's. He recommended our sending in a paper containing the
mere outline of the plan, and asking Stanley to fix a time for
seeing a deputation.<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;It was rather a full meeting
of the Provisional Committee, and everything went off pleasantly
enough. It was decided that application should be immediately
made to Government, and a sub-committee&mdash;consisting of
Grote, Whitmore, Clay, Hawes, Pottinger, Hutt, Torrens, Gouger,
M. D. Hill, Warburton, and G. W. Norman&mdash;was appointed for
conducting the communication with Government. A committee was
also appointed for examining the charter. Some alterations were
made in the wording of the prospectus. All letters were directed
to be written on paper, printed thus:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>'The Provisional Committee are anxious that it should
be distinctly understood, that although no effort will be spared
by them to obtain from His Majesty's Government a Charter on the
principles stated in the publications referred to, yet, as they
may not succeed, there is necessarily doubt as to whether the
Colony will be established or not; they therefore hope that no
person will take any decided step with a view to emigrating to
South Australia so long as such doubt continues.'</blockquote>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>January</i> 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Received a
letter from Poulett Scrope, saying that he feared, 'from private
sources of information, that Government is still much prejudiced
against the Association and its scheme.'<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Rowland Hill recommended me to
go down to his brother at Westminster, and to get him to go with
me to Shaw-Lefevre. This I did. I told Lefevre that 'my chief
object in seeking the interview was to show him, as well as a bad
headache would allow, the difference between this scheme and the
last attempt to found a colony in the neighbourhood of Spencer's
Gulf. In the last attempt, almost all those who were connected
with the scheme intended to make money by it; this was not the
case now&mdash;we were not attempting to get anything <i>out
of</i> Government, we were not trying to make a bargain; but that
the object of every meeting with Stanley would be to confer upon
the best mode of doing a great thing, and the object of which was
wholly <i>national</i>.' He replied, 'that whatever the
objections to the scheme might be, it was quite clear that
nothing like jobbing could be urged against it. The great
respectability of the names would be a sufficient guarantee for
that.' I then said that in the course of the correspondence which
was about to take place between the Committee and Government, it
might be very desirable for me occasionally to see him, not
officially, but as a private individual, to converse upon the
measure&mdash;this kind of intercourse might prevent interminable
correspondence. He said, 'that he should be very glad to see me
at all times, and would try to get all he could out of me.' On
the whole, I am of opinion that he is rather in favour of the
measure than otherwise, but he was very guarded, and said, 'that
he might perhaps like to be more communicative than I might find
him; but that he had found it necessary to say little, and that
little cautiously.'<br>
<br>
"Matthew Hill said he heard that application had been made to
Stanley for the Governorship of the colony&mdash;this, he
thought, very injudicious, and he should take an opportunity of
saying that 'no application of a private nature which had been
made was known to, or authorized by, the committee.'<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Gave Nicol part of the charter
to be printed. Saw Parkes, and went with him to the Colonial
Office.<br>
<br>
"The object of our visit to the office was to obtain a late day
in the week for the interview. Parkes relates that his
conversation, on the whole, was favourable. Stanley took the
papers to Brighton with him on Saturday, and, as he told Earle,
read them carefully. He says, 'there is very great difference
between the present plan and the last; that there are several
points for discussion, and that it will not be all smooth work to
us.' Earle further reports that he (Stanley) has conversed the
matter over with Lefevre, and has instructed the latter as to the
points on which discussion may arise. The Church, Earle thinks,
is not likely to be a stumbling block. It is pretty clear that
Stanley does not object to the matter <i>in limine</i>. Captain
Sturt called; he is very favourable to the colony, and thinks
that good land and a harbour will be found in Gulf St. Vincent,
near a creek, discovered by Captain Barker. He also reports that
the land is good by Port Lincoln, on what authority, however, he
did not say. He will call again."</p>

"<i>Jan</i>. 31.&mdash;The deputation appointed to be received
to-day consisted of Grote, M. D. Hill, Rowland Hill, Parkes,
Pottinger and Gouger. They were received by Stanley in the
presence of Hay, Lefevre and Earle, his three secretaries. Mr.
Grote commenced the conversation by 'apologising for the absence
of Mr. Whitmore, who, although not present, took a very warm
interest in the scheme. Advertisements had been issued with a
view to ascertain whether or not the public would sanction the
measure; this was the sole object of those announcements having
been issued. The effects of these advertisements were that
numerous offers had been made of money, and that a considerable
number of respectable persons were desirous of going to the
colony. The persons who acted with him in the committee were not
influenced by any pecuniary motives; their sole object was to do
a thing which they agreed in thinking was fraught with public
benefit. He then adverted to the large powers which were asked
for the trustees, and said that it was necessary to mention some
things in relation to them, more especially as they were not
dwelt upon in the printed statement issued by the association.
The first was, that the trustees were to be uniformly approved by
the Crown; and the second that all laws were to be submitted to
the Privy Council before being enforced in the colony. Any other
provisions would be cheerfully acceded to which would have the
effect of making the trustees responsible (without pecuniary
loss) for the performance of their duties.'<br>
<br>
"To this Stanley replied 'that numerous important alterations had
been made in the plan since Mr. Whitmore sent him the paper
before him, and he gave a decided preference to that original
proposal as regarded certain provisions. By the present plan,
that power was to be placed in certain irresponsible individuals
which belonged properly to the Colonial Office, and not only were
these individuals irresponsible, but they were not influenced by
any pecuniary motive in seeking to govern well. By the present
plan, the colony would be a republic, and as the officers were to
be appointed by the trustees, the colony would be wholly
independent of the mother country.'<br>
<br>
"This was answered by Grote, saying that, 'whatever the powers
might be which were sought for the trustees, they were no more
than those which had been granted in many instances by the Crown,
and more especially in the charters for founding the settlements
in America and the colony of Sierra Leone.'<br>
<br>
"Stanley remarked that 'nothing could be more vicious in
principle than the plans of these charters; by them large blocks
of land were given to individuals, and by their general
mismanagement the colonies there planted died off repeatedly
before a successful attempt was made. As to the Sierra Leone
colony, he thought nothing of that. If this proposition was
admitted, from some cause not now to be ascertained, the colony
might fail, or the trustees might throw up their powers. In that
case, the shareholders would be ruined, the emigrants would be
ruined, and the Government would be blamed for granting so much
power to irresponsible individuals. Again, he did not see the
advantage of placing that power in individuals, doubtless very
respectable, which ought to reside in the Colonial Office.'<br>
<br>
"To this Matthew Hill replied, that 'it was necessary some body
of persons possessed of considerable powers should be appointed,
or capitalists would not have confidence in the colony, and so
would not subscribe money. Government undoubtedly might manage
the colony, he did not of course wish to compare the probable
management of the trustees with that of Government, but it must
be borne in mind, that if Government founded the colony
themselves, they must also find the means wherewith to do
it.'<br>
<br>
"In reply to this, Stanley repeated 'his preference for a company
pledged to purchase a given quantity of land at a given rate per
annum, and at a given price; the directors of such a company
would have a direct interest in governing well.'<br>
<br>
"Upon this, Gouger asked 'whether it would not meet the objection
urged, if the trustees were obliged to qualify by taking a given
number of bonds, say five bonds of £100 each?'<br>
<br>
"This question and a remark made by Matthew Hill as to the
probable interest of a body of money-getting directors being
different from that of the colony at large, Stanley answered by
saying, 'that he did not see, on consideration, that it
materially signified whether the trustees consisted of
shareholders, or of persons not possessing pecuniary interest in
the colony in whom the shareholders had confidence, so long as
funds were raised to meet the necessary pecuniary
responsibilities.'<br>
<br>
"In answer to a question, however, put subsequently by Parkes, he
said, 'that the management of the colony must be in the Colonial
Office.' Upon this point it was clear he had no decided
opinions.<br>
<br>
"Another reason he gave for preference of the other plan was,
'the greater security for funds being advanced to foimd the
colony. In this case, rather an unfavourable opinion might be
formed from the fact of its being necessary to raise money in the
first instance for a the purposes of the colony, not only for the
Government purposes, but for sending out emigrants.'<br>
<br>
"Grote replied to this, that 'very considerable funds were, he
understood, in the hands of individuals ready to embark for the
colony&mdash;these individuals would purchase land, and this
would form an emigration fund.' On Grote's appealing to Gouger
and Pottinger, they stated that 'thirty-five families of
respectability had enrolled their names at the office, and that
their united capital was estimated at nearly £200,000.' This
communication seemed to have great effect upon Stanley, and he
did not recur to the subject.<br>
<br>
"Stanley then adverted to 'the proposition of giving the trustees
the power to appoint all the officers of the colony. In the
communication with Lord Goderich the same thing was asked and
refused, and he could not, on the part of Government, recommend
such a measure. It would be necessary that all the officers
should be appointed by the Grown, and that a certain sum should
be guaranteed to be paid yearly to Government, in order to meet
the necessary expenses. He had no objection, however, to limit
the charge to a certain gross amount and sum per annum, and to
make the whole a colonial debt. This limitation would be a check
upon Government.' He was a little indistinct as to the source
whence such a sum was to be drawn. At one time he said the
company was to assure it, and at another time he said it was to
form a part of the produce of the sales of land.<br>
<br>
"In answer to a question put by Pottinger, he said that 'he would
not allow the land tax to be security for the Government
expenses&mdash;he expected nothing to arise from this source.'
Here he was prompted by Earle, who whispered the word 'customs,'
and he then said that the colony 'would have the tax of
customs.'<br>
<br>
"On Parkes asking 'if he could fix a minimum sum to be raised for
the maintenance of the Government establishment?' he replied,
that 'that had better be raised by the trustees'; and in reply to
a question put by Matthew Hill, he said, 'that there was no
objection to fix a time in the charter when the colony should be
entitled to a legislative assembly, that should be made to depend
upon the number of male adults in the colony, the quantity of
land brought into cultivation, and the fulfilment of certain
other conditions. He would not say that the colony should have
but one assembly. It should have at a certain time an elective
assembly.'<br>
<br>
"In answer to a question put by Parkes, he said that 'there
should be no exclusive church, but that a fund must be raised for
the purposes of religion and education, to be shared equally
among all sects, as at present in Upper Canada.'<br>
<br>
"He thought it right to mention that 'a clause in the Australian
Company's charter might throw some hindrance in the way; he would
not say that it <i>would</i> do so, but he thought it right to
mention it. This was a clause preventing the establishment of
another company in Australia for purposes similar to its
own.'<br>
<br>
"Gouger replied to this, that 'the Australian Company was founded
for the purpose of growing wool, and that the proposed charter
was for the purpose of founding a colony.'<br>
<br>
"Gouger then mentioned 'the boundaries of New South Wales, which,
according to a paper read by Governor Philip, on landing at New
South Wales, were found to extend to 135° of east longitude; but
as Van Diemen's Land has been formed into a province since that
time, he presumed that no difficulty would arise on that
head.'<br>
<br>
"This fact Stanley did not appear to be aware of, and said that
'of course, anything which he had said did not at all go to
approve or otherwise of the locality&mdash;whether or not the
site proposed was fit for the formation of a settlement was
another question.'<br>
<br>
"On the whole, Stanley appeared to admit that a charter, with
such provisions as he had described, might be granted on the
requisite funds being raised, and towards the end of the
interview he certainly relinquished some of the difficulties with
which he set out, especially as to the appointment of
trustees.<br>
<br>
Thus ended the first interview with Stanley, the above account of
which has been revised by Pottinger and Rowland Hill. The fact of
his having his three secretaries with him was inauspicious
enough, especially that marplot, Hay. At first he appeared to be
completely against the plan, and I expected him to give us a flat
refusal; during the interview, however, he relaxed, and showed
more inclination to see whether or not the scheme could be
modelled to meet his views. It is clear to me from his manner
that all he wants is patronage to places here and there; here,
the sole appointment of commissioner, and there, the appointment
of all the officers. This point I feel every inclination to cede
to him, more especially as he has no objection to limit the
annual expenditure&mdash;the limit, however, must be
ascertained.<br>
<br>
"His plan of the Church is also as free from objection as can be
hoped from him.<br>
<br>
"The chief obstacles are (1) as to the appointment of trustees,
for unless the public have confidence in these the money cannot
be procured, and for this purpose it is quite necessary that they
should have wide political powers; (2) as to the mode of raising
funds for the maintenance of the government of the
colony&mdash;this must not come out of the proceeds of the sales
of landy as he once proposed, but from some other source."</p>
<br>
<p>There was the rub! The one thing needed was lacking, and
although Mr. Gouger, with his aspiring and hopeful nature, could
write with an easy mind, "the funds must come from some other
source," it was many a long day before that source was found.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<h4>IMPERIUM IN IMPERIO.</h4>
<p><span class="a">The</span> next step was to prepare a fresh
draft of a charter to be submitted to Mr. Stanley, and having had
an expression of his views, Mr. Gouger, and the sub-committee
working with him, took special pains to enlarge upon those points
which would tend to make things agreeable in the Colonial
Department without altering any part of the scheme relating to
the principles for which they were contending.</p>
<p>We continue our extracts from Mr. Gouger's Journal:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>February</i> ll<i>th</i>.&mdash;Called on
Lefevre, who received me very well. I told him that my chief
object in calling was to assure him that the intention of the
committee was to found a colony wherein the system of
colonisation they approved should be tried, free from any
disturbing causes, and that no experiment in legislation was
intended. The fact of the majority of the committee being
Radicals depended upon two circumstances; first, that the Whigs
were in office, and, therefore we could not hope to have them on
the committee; secondly, that I was a Radical, and therefore knew
more Radicals than any other class of men.<br>
<br>
"<i>February</i> 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Sent Stanley the following
letter with the signatures attached:&mdash;</p>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">
"<span class="u">South Australian Association</span>.</div>
<br>
<p class="quote">"The undersigned, being members of the
Provisional Committee of the South Australian Association, have
the honour to transmit to Mr. Secretary Stanley two interleaved
copies of the draft of a charter.<br>
<br>
"The papers which were laid before Mr. Secretary Stanley on the
23rd of January last had been drawn up with a view rather to
afford information to the public as to the general principles and
objects of the Association, than to specify the details of the
proposed undertaking. In the accompanying draft, therefore,
though it contains nothing contrary to the plan which had been
framed for public information, there will be found numerous
provisions which did not appear in the other printed statements.
The most important of these added provisions relate to the
control of His Majesty's Government over the acts of the
corporation; and some of them have been inserted expressly with a
view to meet certain objections which had occurred to Mr.
Secretary Stanley, and which were expressed by him to the
deputation from the committee. It may be remarked, also, that the
powers proposed to be conferred by the present charter are much
less extensive and far more under the control of His Majesty's
Government than those conferred by any previous charter for
similar purposes.<br>
<br>
"The substitution of the word 'Commissioners' for that of
'Trustee' is not a merely verbal change; for it indicates, and
will draw attention to the fact, that the persons acting under
the charter would be servants of the supreme Government, and
quite as much subject to its control as the members of any Royal
Commission.<br>
<br>
"Supposing that the measure in its present shape should have Mr.
Secretary Stanley's approbation, the committee would propose that
before the introduction of a bill authorising His Majesty to
grant the charter, ample security should be given to His
Majesty's Government, by persons resident in this country, for
the payment of a sum adequate to meet the expenses of Government
(which sum they would propose should not exceed £7,000 in any one
year, or £100,000 in the whole), together with ample security for
the immediate purchase of waste land to the amount of
£620,000.<br>
<br>
"If, however, the great pains which the Committee have taken to
render the charter wholly unexceptionable should not prove
successful, if Mr. Secretary Stanley should still disapprove of
the measure or any part of it; and if there be any modification
of it that would make it entirely agreeable to him, the Committee
beg that he will be pleased to specify such modification on one
of the enclosed drafts, and to return the same to them, so that
without giving him the trouble of a long correspondence and
repeated interviews, they may obtain for their own guidance an
accurate knowledge of his views.</p>

<p class="quote">"<i>February</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Lefevre told
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; that Stanley felt convinced we had some
hidden object, in consequence of our committee being all
Radicals, and he was therefore very suspicious of the measure.
Finished to-day my digest of the evidence as to the locality, and
not before it is wanted, for it is now out of print.<br>
<br>
"<i>February</i> 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Called on Currie, who has
seen the Bishop of London, and conversed over with him the plan
of the Church Society. The Bishop is decidedly against any
provision for religion to be raised in the colony upon the mode
recommended by Stanley. He thinks a provision for religion
generally, the funds arising from which should be divided amongst
all sects, very objectionable, and would much prefer depending
upon a society to be got up here, and the voluntary subscriptions
of churchmen in the colony. He recommends the appointments to be
made by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, as from
that body much pecuniary aid might be expected.<br>
<br>
"<i>February</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Called on the Bishop of
London. His conversation was much of the same character as that
reported by Currie. He will allow his name to be used as
President of the Church Society, and told me I might use his name
wherever I liked to that effect. He liked the association, but
would not give his name to it, as the committee consisted of
Radicals and Unitarians. No mention was made of schools. He
prefers this mode of getting up the Church form of worship to any
other plan.<br>
<br>
"<i>March</i> 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Received a letter from Whitmore,
stating he had had a conversation with Stanley respecting the
charter, and found him decidedly adverse to the plan of
commissioners, stating that he could not submit to such an
<i>imperium in imperio</i>&mdash;he said he should not object to
the principles of the measure recommended in other respects, but
he seemed resolved to take his stand upon this point. "Whitmore
considered that his mind was so fully made up on this point, that
he thought a meeting of the committee should be summoned to take
the present posture of affairs into consideration.<br>
<br>
"<i>March</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Pottinger took me on one side to
say, that, if I encouraged the idea, he would guarantee the money
for an exploring expedition, whether the charter were obtained or
not. If it were not obtained under the present control at the
Colonial Office, he would find the money if Stanley would give
him an assurance in writing that no colony should be formed there
until his report were made, or within two years. This shows
Pottinger to be at least in earnest.<br>
<br>
"<i>March</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Saw Lefevre. Wakefield has urged
me to say little to Lefevre about the plan of the charter, and
simply to ask for an answer. Immediately on entering the room,
however, he began to talk about the objection which Stanley
entertained to the plan, <i>viz</i>., the appointment of
commissioners with the delegation of extensive powers. I answered
this by saying, that the commissioners were as much dependent for
their power upon the will of the Secretary of State as were the
commissioners for the issue of Exchequer Bills, or any other
commissioners, and that their functions were not more important
to the State. This led to a conversation which lasted nearly an
hour, in which he confessed that he had mistaken, or rather had
not perceived, the bearing of that part of the measure, and that
he was sure Stanley had not seen it. He would, therefore, speak
to Stanley upon the subject, and wished me and G. W. Norman to
see Stanley. I said I had no objection at any time to do so, but
that it must be considered a private interview. Lefevre called
the measure a most seductive one, and remarked that <i>if the
Colony were successful, as he fully believed it would be, that
other Colonies would wish to be under our orders</i>. This showed
the feeling which Wakefield has always said was the guiding
principle at the Colonial Office. I answered that it would be the
<i>plan</i>, not the men who carried the plan out, that would be
the matter of envy, and if this were found so good, I presumed
Mr. Stanley would be glad to adopt it in other cases. I am quite
certain Lefevre is sincere, and wishes to do all we require.<br>
<br>
"<i>March</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;In consequence of a message
being left for me by G. W. Norman, I went down to the Colonial
Office to see Lefevre. Lefevre has seen Stanley since I saw him,
and has got the final instructions for a letter. Stanley retains
all his old objections, and will not listen to the appointment of
commissioners with legislative powers. I gave Lefevre a copy of
the Church Society paper with the names filled in. At first, he
was highly amused with the idea of having <i>done</i> the Bishop,
but after a short time he said it was a very interesting and
important paper.<br>
<br>
"<i>March</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Called on Lefevre in consequence
of our not having received any letter. He said that I should have
it in an hour if I would call for it, and 'then we would read it
together.' In an hour I called again and got the letter. Having
read it, I said that it would be considered by some of our
committee as a decisive answer in the negative, for as they
considered that power to govern was indispensable, which Mr.
Stanley distinctly refuses to grant, the thing would, in the
estimation of many, be at an end. He replied he hoped not, for
the plan was a very ingenious one, and he should like much to see
it tried; there was truly no hope of Mr. Stanley's acquiescence
being obtained for the appointment of commissioners with
governing powers, but he thought there was room for another
communication which might succeed. I remarked that nothing was
said in the letter about the administration of the fund arising
from the sales of land; in whom would that power reside? He
replied, in any body we named. Mr. Stanley would not object to
the Emigration Fund being expended by some person or persons
appointed for the purpose. On this I reminded him that the
emigration fund was public money; that if he appointed anyone to
see to the disposition of this fund, he would be a commissioner,
if he appointed more than one, they would be a Board of
Commissioners&mdash;in that sense had he no objection to
commissioners being appointed? He replied, 'certainly not.' I
then adverted to the funds required for carrying the plan into
effect&mdash;who was to raise money? He said, 'we might borrow
it.' To this, I said that 'the Colonial Office could not borrow
it, or they would be considered as borrowing on Government
security; the proper persons to borrow money for the Government
expenses would be the commissioners before named.' He saw no
objection to this. Then I said, 'it appears that, after all,
commissioners may be appointed, but their powers are not to
extend beyond controlling the emigration fund, and raising money
by the issue of bonds.' On his saying something about the land
being taken from the control of Government, I replied that all we
required was the continuance of one system of granting land,
supposing it to be a good one; some one mode must be the best of
those in operation, and I suggested that it became His Majesty's
Government to ascertain by a commission, or by a committee of
enquiry, which was that <i>best mode</i>&mdash;this ascertained,
it was incumbent on the Government to do all in their power to
perpetuate that mode; and the committee would be perfectly
satisfied if an Act of Parliament were passed for the purpose of
ensuring the continuance of such a plan. By these means, no land
would be taken from the control of the Government. On my saying
that I felt obliged to him for the kindness and attention he had
shown during the negotiation, he said that he hoped I should come
to him again with some modification of the plan, and he
recommended especially that I should enibody such a plan as our
conversation of this morning had elicited&mdash;he would consider
such a letter private, until I told him to consider it as
official. The letter received to-day from Lefevre, on behalf of
Stanley, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<br>
<p class="quote">"<span class="u">Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
"I am directed by Mr. Secretary Stanley to communicate with you
as chairman of the provisional committee of the South Australian
Association, in reply to a letter dated the 21st ultimo,
addressed to him by the gentlemen composing that committee,
transmitting for his consideration a copy of the draft of a
proposed charter to carry into effect the objects of the
association.<br>
<br>
"I am to express Mr. Stanley's regret that you were prevented
from being present at a conference which took place between a
deputation from that committee and himself on January 31st, on
which occasion Mr. Stanley communicated his general views upon
the subject, and his objections to the plan then proposed to
him.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Stanley has since been led to believe that a minute of the
discussion which took place at that conference has been made, and
has been circulated amongst the members of the provisional
committee. As no draft of any such minute has been brought under
Mr. Stanley's notice, he cannot either admit or judge of its
accuracy, and he therefore desires me (in order to prevent any
misconception of his views) to recapitulate to you the substance
of the opinions which he expressed at that conference.<br>
<br>
"It was agreed to postpone the consideration of the evidence
which might be in the possession of the parties as to the fitness
or unfitness of the particular tract selected for the purpose of
settlement, until it should have been ascertained how far the
political views of the proposed company, and their project of
colonisation, might meet the concurrence of the Secretary of
State. With reference to this point, and reserving the former
question to be thereafter discussed, Mr. Stanley, in conforming
with the views he entertained in August last, and which were
communicated to you in his memorandum of the 22nd of that month,
declared himself willing, unless prevented by any express or
implied stipulation with the Australian Agricultural Company, to
treat with a body of persons associated as a company, with an
adequate subscribed capital, for the sale to such company of a
large quantity of land in South Australia, at the price of 5s.
per acre, with the understanding that the amount paid by the
company for such land should be laid out in sending emigrants
from this country to the colony, under the direction of the
company, and with a guarantee on the part of Government that,
within a district of very considerable extent, no further land
should be sold by the Crown under the minimum price of 5s. per
acre, reserving, however, to the Crown the power of selling any
quantity either at or above that price.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Stanley, however, signified that in consideration of this
arrangement the company should be bound to provide, for a given
number of years, a fixed annual sum in payment of the expenses of
the Civil Government, the officers of which were to be appointed
by the Crown, but that the company should be allowed to reimburse
themselves for the amount which might thus be advanced by them
towards these expenses, either by charging it as a debt on the
colony, or, by taking an equivalent in land. Mr. Stanley also
stated that out of the lands to be hereafter sold by the company
or by the Government, a fund must be set apart for the purpose of
enabling the Government to afford assistance to the colonists in
providing for education and religious instruction, not to be
limited to any exclusive church or denomination, and he likewise
intimated that when the population of the colony should have
reached a given number. His Majesty would take into consideration
the propriety of giving the inhabitants a share in the
legislation of the colony, and in the control of its finances.
Mr. Stanley pointed out to the deputation the important
differences which existed between the plan which they then
brought forward and that in which he had thus intimated his
inclination to acquiesce, and he most especially drew their
attention to the strong objection which he felt to the
interposition of a body of trustees between the Government and
the parties actually interested in the intended colony. Mr.
Stanley had hoped that the result of the conference, to which I
have adverted, would have been such a proposal on the part of the
provisional committee as Mr. Stanley would nave felt himself
justified in assenting to; but he regrets to perceive that the
more matured plan which has been brought under his consideration
in the shape of 'the proposed charter for the South Australian
Commission' is very widely different from that which he was
inclined to sanction. Mr. Stanley perceives that the parties who
bring forward this plan and who stipulate for the withdrawal from
the power of the Crown of the whole of a large territory, are not
prepared to insure the application of more than a very small
amount of capital to the purchaser of any part of this territory,
so small, indeed, as not to hold out a sufficient guarantee for
their experiment being effectually set on foot. He perceives also
that as the proposed charter is framed, the whole active
legislative power over the colony is to be taken from the Crown,
and is to be placed in the hands of commissioners, not (except in
the first instance) selected by the Crown; not removable except
for positive misconduct or neglect; not responsible either to the
colonists or to the Government at home for the measures which
they may propose, and not personally interested in the success of
the undertaking which they are to conduct.<br>
<br>
"On the other hand, the Secretary of State for the Colonial
Department, who will be unable to carry into effect any measure
whatever, however essential he may consider it to the welfare of
the colony, will still have the task of checking and controlling
the proceedings of the new legislative body, and will therefore
be subject to the responsibility of the failure of the experiment
without being able to contribute to its success.<br>
<br>
"Unless this important feature of the proposed charter is
abandoned, unless the government of the colony is to be left in
the hands of the Crown and its constitutional advisers, until it
is able to govern itself&mdash;unless, in fact, the provisional
committee of the association find themselves able to assimilate
in a much greater degree their project to that which I have above
sketched out as meeting Mr. Stanley's views, Mr. Stanley will be
under the necessity of declining to proceed any further in this
negotiation with the South Australian Association, a course which
the intrinsic merits of their plan, considered as a means of
facilitating emigration, and the respect which he entertains for
the distinguished individuals composing the committee, would lead
him sincerely to regret.<br>
<br>
"I am further to add, that, in the event of the association
ultimately deciding to treat for the purchase of a tract of land
upon the terms above suggested by Mr. Stanley, Mr. Stanley would
not object to the following stipulations being made in their
favour, namely, that the minimum price at which the Crown should
sell any additional land to individuals should be somewhat higher
than that at which the company should have purchased it; and that
a considerable part of the purchase-money of such additional land
should be expended in promoting emigration upon such principles
as might be hereafter agreed on by the association and His
Majesty's Government.</p>

the effect of dissolving the present association, and my reason
for saying so is, that Mr. Stanley insists on a Crown colony,
while the sole object of the association is to found a chartered
one. The very great difference between a Crown and a chartered
colony is clearly pointed out in the enclosed paper, which was
not written by me, or, as you will readily see, with a view to
its being laid before Mr. Stanley, and which I should not have
thought of submitting to you in your official character.<br>
<br>
"Supposing you to have read that paper, I conclude you will
perceive that the committee (who will not meet till Friday next)
are almost sure to object to a colony which should be
<i>chartered</i> as to the money, the trouble, and the
responsibility, but <i>Crown</i> as to every kind of power. This
is why I believe that your official letter will induce them to
dissolve the association and to appeal to Parliament.<br>
<br>
"But as the sole object of some of the committee is, like my own,
simply to found the colony on the principles laid down as to
<i>land and emigration</i> without regard to questions of
government, and as you allow me to express my wishes as an
individual, I submit to you whether all Mr. Stanley's objections
might not be removed if the association were to keep together
merely for the purpose of enabling him to found a Crown
colony.<br>
<br>
"The only obstacle to the founding of a Crown colony is the want
of funds for defraying the cost of government. But this
difficulty would soon be at an end if the association were able
to assure the public that a colony, on the principles laid down
as to <i>land and emigration</i>, was about to be founded. In
that case the colonists going out, and others here, wealthy
persons, who wish the colonisation system to be tried, would
advance sufficient funds for all Government purposes.<br>
<br>
"I therefore submit for your consideration that Mr. Stanley
should (following the example of Sir George Murray as to the Swan
River) bring a Bill into Parliament to the following effect:</p>
<br>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:center;">"Authorising the
King</div>
<p class="quote">"To make laws and appoint officers for the
colony.<br>
<br>
"To appoint commissioners for disposing of the waste land and the
money obtained by the sale thereof, according to the principles
laid down as to land and emigration.<br>
<br>
"To raise money, on the security of the colonial revenues, for
the purposes of the colonial government.<br>
<br>
"This would be a Crown colony; but as it would be founded and
extended on the principles laid down as to <i>land and
emigration</i>, I do believe that many of the most influential
persons in our committee, and some who do not yet belong to it,
would take great pains in collecting a respectable body of
colonists, and in finding, by way of loan, the sum required for
government expenses, but of course they would act merely as
individuals, since by the proposed Act of Parliament every sort
of power would be vested in the Colonial Secretary.<br>
<br>
"To this plan it seems to me impossible that Mr. Stanley should
have any objection whatever, if he have no objection to our
trying the principles of mere colonisation.<br>
<br>
"I earnestly beg of you to examine it, and trust that you may be
able to give some private and merely verbal intimation of your
opinion respecting it by Thursday at latest.<br>
<br>
"I have written without reserve in order that I might not be
mistaken, and I have shown, I trust, what I fear that you have
not fully understood before, that my sole object is the
<i>principles of colonisation</i> without regard to questions of
government.<br>
<br>
"For your kindness which has enabled me to take a course so well
calculated to remove all difficulties, I beg leave to return you
my sincere thanks.</p>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:right; margin-right:25%;">"I
remain. Dear Sir,</div>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:right; margin-right:15%;">
"Yours very truly,</div>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">
"<span class="u">Robert Gouger</span>.</div>
<br>
<p class="quote">"P.S.&mdash;The proposed Bill might, if that
course were preferred, be introduced by Mr. Whitmore or some
other member of the association.<br>
<br>
"I ought to have said that there is not the least chance of the
committee assenting to a Joint Stock Company for the purchase and
sale of land, as suggested in your official letter. If the
measure were turned into a private speculation, those who are
interested in it would immediately withdraw. If their object had
been private advantage they would of course have jumped at Mr.
Stanley's proposal that they should have land at a lower price
than other people; but such a preference would be directly
contrary to the principles of colonisation which they wish to see
adopted."</p>

<p class="quote">"<span class="u">Answers To Objections</span>
made by the Colonial Office to the South Australian Commission.
Sent to Lefevre with the foregoing letter.<br>
<br>
"See the charter, its <i>conditions, restrictions</i>, and
<i>reservations</i>.<br>
<br>
"I. That the charter would create an <i>imperium in
imperio</i>.<br>
<br>
"<i>Answer</i>. The Latin answer is, <i>Qui facit per alium facit
per se</i>. It is a delegation of authority. An independent and a
delegated authority are widely different. For example, the recent
Act of Parliament and Orders in Council, which establish a branch
of the English Government within the Chinese Empire, have set up
an independent authority as respects the Chinese Government; but
as respects the English Government, the superintendents of the
English trade at Canton will exercise a delegated authority. The
religious government of the Quakers is, by sufferance, an
<i>imperium in imperio</i>; but the authority exercised in
perpetual succession, by the heads of the Established Church, is
a delegated authority. So is the authority of the East India
Company, of the Grosvenor Place trust, of every canal or railway
company, and of the hundreds, nay thousands of corporations that
exist in Great Britain and Ireland. Delegation of authority in
perpetual succession has, for ages, been a leading principle of
the British Government; as one central authority acting
everywhere by means of temporary agents has ever been a leading
principle of the Turkish Government, and, since the time of
Napoleon, of the French Government. And in nothing has the
British Government more strictly adhered to the principle of
delegated authority than in the foundation of colonies. Allowing
that the first settlement in New South Wales was not a colony,
but a distant jail, there is but one exception to the English
rule of founding colonies by means of a delegated authority in
perpetual succession. That exception is the Swan River
settlement. Whether the delegation of authority be a better mode
of government than the constant and immediate agency of the
supreme authority in all the details of government is a question;
but there can be no question that the term <i>imperium in
imperio</i> is totally inapplicable to the proposed commission,
except for the purpose of misleading, except for the purpose of
hiding the truth, which is, that the proposed grant would be a
delegation of authority in strict accordance with the principles
of the British constitution and with the practice of the British
Government in the foundation of colonies.<br>
<br>
"II. That the commission would interfere with the King's
prerogative.<br>
<br>
"<i>Answer</i>. No; for the King would exercise his prerogative
in granting the charter. This is the Latin objection repeated in
English. The English answer is, that the King would do that which
it is one of his prerogatives to do, and which his predecessors
have done over and over again in the exercise of their Royal
prerogative. It is a great prerogative to have the power of
delegating so much authority.<br>
<br>
"III. That the authority required is too extensive.<br>
<br>
"<i>Answer</i>. It is less extensive, by far, than in any
preceding case. So much of the charter consists of conditions,
restrictions, and reservations, that it hardly deserves the name
of a grant, unless, indeed, it be considered a grant to the
Secretary of State as well as to the corporation. By the
conditions, restrictions, and reservations of the grant, the
Secretary of State for the time being would nominate the first
commissioners; would have a veto on the nomination of successive
commissioners; would have power to remove commissioners for
neglect or misconduct, and to appoint others in their room; would
have a veto upon the appointment of the chief servants of the
corporation, upon all the laws made by the corporation for the
colony, and even upon the instructions given by the corporation
to their servants in the colony. He would, besides, receive
copies of all the pecuniary accounts of the corporation, and of
all the correspondence with the colony. He would, in short, have
entire control over the corporation, except in the original
appointment of their servants. Amongst the thousands of cases in
which the British Government has delegated authority for a
specific purpose by means of a grant from the Crown, there is,
probably, not one in which the authority given was so much
restricted, so much held in subservience to the supreme
authority, as in the present instance.<br>
<br>
"IV. The corporation would dispense patronage.<br>
<br>
"<i>Answer</i>. Of course it would select the servants, paid with
its money for conducting its affairs. Responsible for the fate of
the colony, it would choose (subject to the Ministers' veto) the
persons on whose conduct the fate of the expedition must
depend.<br>
<br>
"V. The corporation would meddle with what belongs to the
Colonial Office.<br>
<br>
"<i>Answer</i>. What is it that belongs to the Colonial Office?
Not the deserts of South Australia, nor the families who wish to
settle there, nor the money which is ready to be advanced for
founding and governing the colony. The corporation would meddle
with nothing but a colony which remains to be founded, and that
which is not yet in existence cannot belong to the Colonial
Office.<br>
<br>
"VI. The charter will diminish the powers of the Colonial
Office.<br>
<br>
"<i>Answer</i>. Not so; for as to no part of the subject-matter
of the charter did the Colonial Office ever exercise any power
whatsoever. That over which the corporation would exercise a much
restricted power remains to be created. But the charter would add
to the power of the Colonial Office by creating, where now there
are only savages and kangaroos, a colony, over which the Colonial
Minister would, by means of the conditions, restrictions, and
reservations of the grant, exercise much control.<br>
<br>
"VII. The corporation might establish a republic in New
Holland.<br>
<br>
"<i>Answer</i>. With the help of the Colonial Minister, the King,
and Parliament, but not without, as no law framed for the colony
is to take effect without the express approval of the Secretary
of State, and, as the Parliament reserves to the King and
Parliament the office of framing a constitution for the colony,
the word 'republic' seems to be used, like the term <i>imperium
in imperio</i>, only for the purpose of exciting prejudice.<br>
<br>
"VIII. The Colonial Office is ready to find proper persons to
found and govern the colony.<br>
<br>
"<i>Answer</i>. Be it so; but then the Colonial Office must find
the money and take the responsibility. In that case the colony
would be formed according to the French or Turkish principle of
central authority, instead of the old English principle of
delegated authority. In that ease no charter is required, and
there is an end of the question.<br>
<br>
"IX. But the Colonial Office cannot find the money. Parliament
grumbles at paying £7,000 a year for the Swan River, and would
not give anything for another such colony. The Colonial Office is
ready to expend the money, but somebody else must find it.<br>
<br>
"Answer. This is the very pith of the question. The Colonial
Office wants the patronage; but there can be no patronage without
money, nor any money without a charter. None will lend their
names for raising the money, unless they have a control over the
money raised on their responsibility. So that when the Colonial
Minister insists on expending the money, he declares in effect
that there shall be no money to expend.<br>
<br>
"X. The Colonial Minister wishes, on the contrary, that the money
should be raised. He wants not the money but the
appointments.<br>
<br>
"<i>Answer</i>. That is to say, the corporation is to take all
the trouble and responsibility of the undertaking, while its
servants, on whose conduct and character the success of the
undertaking will depend, are to be chosen by the Colonial
Minister or his successor, or the successor of his successor. Or
rather this money-finding and responsible corporation is not to
have any servants of its own; it must find the money, and have
the blame of failure, but must not control the work. Such a
proposition, surely, was never made before. The Colonial Minister
wants a chartered colony as to the money, the trouble, and the
responsibility, but a Crown colony as to the patronage. The two
opposite principles of control and delegated authority can never
be so united. In either case, the appointment of servants
necessarily goes along with the money, the trouble, and the
responsibility.<br>
<br>
"XI. The Minister objects to the principle of chartered
colonies.<br>
<br>
"<i>Answer</i>. Passing by the fact that the principle of Crown
colonies is a modern innovation, <i>introduced by the conquest of
foreign colonies</i>; that the very existence of a Colonial
Office is of quite recent date; that during all the while when
England was engaged in founding the thirteen great colonies of
North America she was so unfortunate as not to have a Colonial
Minister; and that no English colony (except the Swan River
abortion) was founded otherwise than by charter; the present
objection amounts to a decree against colonisation. The Minister
cannot found a Crown colony, because Parliament will not give him
any money for that purpose; but he forbids others to found a
colony with their own money, that is, a chartered colony. He
prefers a mere desert, and the uneasiness and distress which a
new colony might relieve, to a colony which should not afford him
any patronage. Though he would not lose any patronage by allowing
a chartered colony to be established, still, because he would not
thereby gain any patronage, he says that the thing shall not be
done. He acts like the dog in the manger, preventing others,
through mere whim or envy, from using that which he cannot use
himself. Colonial Minister by name, he becomes in fact the
Secretary of State for the Prevention of Colonies.<br>
<br>
"That strange conclusion is undeniable, if this national
undertaking (which has for object to enlarge the field of
employment for <i>English</i> capital and labour) is to be
prevented by the veto of one Minister. But this is a question in
legislation, while the office of Colonial Minister is purely
executive. This, then, is a most proper subject of appeal to the
Cabinet and to Parliament. It forms no part of the duty of a
Colonial Minister to decide whether new colonies shall be
<i>Crown</i> or <i>Chartered</i>; still less is it his business
to decide whether or not the British nation shall found more
colonies. These are questions not of colonial administration, but
of national legislation. The administrative authority which the
Colonial Minister exercises in some distant provinces (some
colonies and some not), was given to him by the Legislature;
while the Legislature has placed some distant provinces quite out
of his control. It was not the Colonial Minister, but Parliament,
which made the Swan River a Crown Colony, and which renewed the
charter of the East India Company. The whole question, then, is
properly legislative and may be divided into three parts.<br>
<br>
"1st. The expediency of colonisation on national grounds.<br>
<br>
"2nd. Which is better, that new settlements should be Crown
Colonies, governed entirely by the Colonial Minister, and at the
national cost, according to the French principle of central
authority, or, chartered colonies founded and governed by a body
corporate, at no cost to the nation, according to the English
principle of delegated authority and the well-tried practice of
the British Government in respect to the foundation of
colonies?<br>
<br>
"3rd. Supposing colonisation to be expedient on national grounds,
and that we cannot decide which is better&mdash;a Crown Colony or
a Chartered one&mdash;still is not a chartered one better than
none at all?<br>
<br>
<br>
"Before this paper had gone in to Mr. Lefevre, Pottinger showed
me a paper which he had prepared, and which contained heads of a
plan for founding a Crown Colony. This I was not sorry to have,
as it would at any rate prevent the annoyance of his opposition.
His paper as read to me rendered the produce of the sales of land
applicable to the expenses of Government as well as to the
purposes of emigration. This I insisted on erasing, and finally
it was agreed to say that the immigration fund should be
applicable to the expenses of Government in case of the failure
of all other means. In no other respect did it differ from the
plan of the foregoing letter to Lefevre, and I hesitated whether
or not it would be advisable to send this in rather than the
'answers to objections.' Wakefield, however, decided this point
rather roughly, and the letter and enclosure were sent in.<br>
<br>
"<i>March</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Called on Lefevre to learn
whether or not he could express a decided opinion on the plan of
the Crown colony. He did not seem at all hurt at the tone of the
paper he yesterday received, but denied strongly that the refusal
to the chartered colony was grounded upon a love of patronage. He
had not read the letter sufficiently attentively to enable him to
express an opinion upon which I might act, but thought, at the
first blush, it looked more likely to meet Mr. Stanley's views.
Just then his luncheon came in, and I told him that if he would
allow me to read to him the heads of the plan more in detail,
while he ate his luncheon, I should be glad. He assented, and I
read the following paper, which is founded on Pottinger's above
mentioned:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:center;"><span class=
"a">"Memorandum.</span></div>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:right;">
[<i>Private</i>.]</div>
<p class="quote">"It is proposed to His Majesty's Government to
found a colony in South Australia, and the following provisions
are submitted for consideration. As a preliminary to the
introduction of an Act of Parliament, His Majesty's Government
must be fully satisfied that ample funds are ready to be invested
in the purchase of land; that the body of intending emigrants are
possessed of sufficient capital to maintain and employ the
labourers taken to the colony; and that the country will not be
put to any expense whatever, either in the founding or in the
government of the colony. The amount of capital to be provided
for these purposes to be determined by the Secretary of
State.<br>
<br>
"1. The colony to be erected into a province and in the name of
South. Australia, and extending from &mdash;&mdash; to
&mdash;&mdash;.<br>
<br>
"2. Within the above limits no waste or public land to become
private property, save by one means only, viz., by purchase at a
fixed minimum price, or as much above that price as competition
at public auction may determine.<br>
<br>
"3. Subject to the above restriction, and to the necessity of
previous survey, all persons, whether residing in the colony or
in Great Britain, to be free to acquire property in waste or
public land, without limit as to quantity or situation.<br>
<br>
"4. The whole of the purchase-money of waste or public land to be
employed in conveying poor persons, natives of the British Isles,
from Britain to the colony, subject, however, to the contingency
mentioned in Article 5.<br>
<br>
"6. The expenses of the local government, which shall not exceed
the annual sum of £&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, to be provided
for by the issue of bonds bearing colonial interest, or by taxes,
to be levied in the colony. The produce of the sales of land to
be applied to this purpose only in case of the failure of all
other means.<br>
<br>
"6. His Majesty's Government to authorize the issue of bonds for
the purpose of founding the colony; the amount to become a
colonial debt, provided it do not exceed
£&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.<br>
<br>
"7. Taxes to be levied in the Colony as soon as practicable, to
be applied, in the first instance, to replacing the amount
deducted from the produce of the sales of land (should any such
deduction have taken place), and afterwards to the liquidation of
the colonial debt.<br>
<br>
"8. The laws of the colony to be framed by His Majesty's
Government until such time as the colony shall have a legislative
assembly.<br>
<br>
"9. All the officers of the colony to be appointed by the
Crown.<br>
<br>
"10. Fpon the male population amounting to &mdash;&mdash; and
upon undertaking to liquidate the colonial debt, the colony to be
entitled to a local legislative assembly.<br>
<br>
"11. Adequate provision to be made for the support of religion
and education.<br>
<br>
<br>
"When I had finished reading this paper, Lefevre said, 'I think
that will do&mdash;it is a very important paper, and I should
like to have it.' On talking about the mode of executing the
plan, I remarked that commissioners must still be appointed to
administer the emigration fund, and to raise money by the issue
of bonds. To this Lefevre assented, and dictated the following
words: 'It is obvious that commissioners must be appointed for
the purpose of raising the money for the government of the
colony, as well as for selecting and sending out emigrants; these
commissioners, of course, will be appointed by the Crown.'<br>
<br>
"In the course of conversation after this, he said he hoped that
I should not be obliged to take my threatened journey to America,
and that, even if this plan went on, that I should not leave the
country. To this I replied that it was very uncertain, and could
only be decided by circumstances which might arise at the time.
He then said he thought I ought to belong to the Statistical
Society, and that he should be very glad to propose me as a
member. I answered that if I remained in England, I should be
much obliged to him to do so.<br>
<br>
"<i>March</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Edward Wakefield thinks I have
lost sight of the principle of colonisation in allowing the
introduction of any clause making the immigration fund applicable
to any other purpose than the conveyance of labourers, under the
contingencies mentioned in the 5th clause of the foregoing paper.
I did not care about it, because I felt assured that the colony
might be said to have failed, if no funds could be raised in it
by taxes, and if no money could be borrowed upon that security.
He maintains that, however that may be, the principle has been
lost sight of, and a premium is offered for the failure of other
means by the introduction of such a power. I shall therefore
alter the paper I gave Lefevre. Went down to the house with D.
Wakefield. There we saw Scrope, Ward, Grote, Clay, Hutt, and
Wilks. Showed them Lefevre's official letter, and the plan for
founding a Crown instead of a Chartered colony. Clay, Scrope, and
Ward thought that if Stanley would pledge himself to keep entire
the colonisation plan, sufficient inducement would be held out to
capitalists to embark money and to go to the colony. Grote and
Hutt, on the contrary, appeared to think that self-government was
necessary to the success of the colony. They were all much
annoyed at the refusal, and they certainly showed much
earnestness for the success of the measures.<br>
<br>
"<i>March</i> 21<i>st</i>.&mdash;The meeting of the provisional
committee took place, Whitmore was in the chair, and twenty-one
persons were present. W. Strutt proposed Mr. Hawkins, M.P., as
member of the committee. After the letter from Lefevre to
Whitmore was read, Whitmore said that although Mr. Stanley
objected to founding a chartered colony, that he did not think
the committee ought to dissolve the association; if Mr. Stanley
would agree to carry out the colonisation principles to which
they were all so much attached, the form of government they
required being denied them ought not to be considered a
sufficient reason for refusing to go on with the measure. At
least he would not leave the committee; if he did, he should
think he were neglecting a great public duty. On this Hawes
proposed that Lefevre's letter be copied and circulated amongst
the members of the committee. He could not decide what ought to
be done, he required time, and wished to meet again after the
Easter holidays. To this Torrens objected. This plan had been now
before the public some years, and he saw no reason why we could
not decide at once. The subject was so familiar to the minds of
many of the committee, that they could at once see what ought to
be done. Gowan followed on the same side. I then reported that I
had seen Lefevre several times lately, and could assure them that
no hopes remained in my mind of being able to found a chartered
colony. Mr. Stanley was decidedly averse to the delegation of
sufficient power for the purpose. I related some parts of the
conversation between Lefevre and myself, and then read the letter
and resolutions which I wished the committee to adopt at that
meeting. Hawes then put his resolution for adjournment, and
Torrens proposed his amendment for adopting the letter and
resolutions. A long conversation followed, but the event was in
favour of the letter and resolutions. They were therefore read
and re-read, until approved. D. Wakefield read the draft of the
Act of Parliament, but this was rejected on the ground of their
not being sufficiently advanced in the negotiation. Towards the
conclusion of the meeting Grote, Clay, and Ward came in, and
ripped open some points which had before been disposed of, thus
much embarrassing the affair. Each of these had his own peculiar
crotchet&mdash;Ward was strong on self-government&mdash;Grote on
the probability of raising money, and Clay on the position of the
committee with the public. Ward was sensible enough with his
hobby; but Clay was trifling. Grote asked Norman, Currie, Clay,
Hawes what they thought about the chance of getting money.
Norman, Clay and Hawes differed with Currie in a trifling degree.
They were very cautious in what they said about it, but Currie
said he thought there was no doubt whatever of ample funds being
raised&mdash;this he qualified again by saying that he would not
put his opinion on paper; he said it in his private capacity and
not as a committee man. They all thought there was a <i>fair
probability</i> of the money being raised, and the resolution was
framed accordingly."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<h4>A CROWN COLONY.</h4>
<p><span class="a">The</span> following are the resolutions,
referred to in the foregoing chapter, which were forwarded to Mr.
Lefevre, together with the letter signed by Mr. George
Grote:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>March</i> 2l<i>st</i>, 1834.&mdash;Resolved:
That Mr. Lefevre's letter to Mr. Whitmore of the 17th instant
leaves no hope that His Majesty's Government will consent to the
foundation of a chartered colony in South Australia.<br>
<br>
"That in case His Majesty's Government will obtain from
Parliament the authority necessary for planting a Crown colony in
South Australia, provision being made in the Act for the
permanent establishment of that mode of disposing of waste land,
and of the purchase-money of such land which has been recommended
by this committee, coupled with provisions for good government,
the South Australian Association shall continue its existence as
a private and temporary society for the purpose of promoting the
success of the measure.<br>
<br>
<br>
"<span class="u">Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
"In the absence of Mr. Whitmore, the chairman of the provisional
committee of the South Australian Association, I have the honour
to acknowledge the receipt of your letter to him of the 17th
instant, which has been submitted to the committee.<br>
<br>
"The committee wish me to express, in the first place, their fear
that their objects have not been thoroughly understood by Mr.
Secretary Stanley. It is true that at the interview to which you
refer, Mr. Stanley suggested that the association should be a
Joint Stock Company, for the purchase and sale of land; but this
never was the object of the present association; and I may add
that the proposal at the conclusion of your letter for bestowing
land on such a company at a lower price than that which should
afterwards be paid by others, is directly contrary to one of the
chief objects of the association, viz., that in the intended
colony, land should be uniformly sold upon equal terms to all
applicants.<br>
<br>
"In order to express what have been the objects of the
association, I must briefly advert to the difference between a
Chartered Colony and a Crown Colony.<br>
<br>
"A colony founded by charter is one example of that delegation of
authority which, in perpetual succession, has for ages been a
leading principle of the British Government; while a colony
founded by the Crown is an example of that central authority,
acting at whatever distance from the seat of Government, by means
of temporary agents, which is a leading principle of the French
government. In either case, however, the trouble, the
responsibility, and the authority necessarily go together.<br>
<br>
"Now the object of this association was to found a colony by
means of an authority delegated in perpetual succession to
certain persons who should incur the trouble and responsibility
of conducting the undertaking. Mr. Stanley objects to such a
delegation of authority. It follows that he objects to a
chartered colony; for, of course, no body of persons would
consent to take the trouble and responsibility of such an
undertaking without obtaining at the same time sufficient
authority for carrying their objects into effect.<br>
<br>
"But while the committee conceive that Mr. Stanley's
determination puts an end to the project of a chartered colony,
and though they would have very much preferred that mode of
proceeding, they are of opinion that a Crown colony would be very
desirable, provided that the Secretary of State, in founding such
a colony, should take effectual means to establish permanently,
so as to leave no room for change by his successors, that system
in the disposal of waste land, and the purchase-money of such
land, which has been recommended by this association. But in the
founding of a Crown colony the difficulty is to obtain funds for
the purposes of government. It is not to be expected that
Parliament should make a grant of money for that purpose, so
that, unless some other means can be devised for raising the
necessary funds, Mr. Stanley's objection to a chartered colony
will amount to a decree against the colonisation of South
Australia.<br>
<br>
"But the committee are inclined to believe that other means for
defraying the expenses of a Crown colony may be employed with
effect. They conceive that, if the proposed method of treating
waste land and immigration were permanently established and
securities given for good government, the prospect of the success
of the colony would be such as to afford a fair probability that
persons in England would be ready to advance upon the security of
the future sales of land and upon the security of the ordinary
revenue of the colony, both a fund for supplying the richer
colonists with labour until the immigration fund should be
sufficient for that purpose, and a fund for defraying the charges
of Colonial Government. Their present view of the subject,
founded on the assumption that your letter of the 17th instant
puts an end to the question of charter, is more fully explained
by certain resolutions this day passed by the committee, of which
I have the honour to enclose a copy.<br>
<br>
"The committee, then, compelled to abandon the principle of a
chartered colony, yet trusting that the Crown may be disposed to
establish permanently for South Australia the best mode of
treating Waste land and immigration, beg you will be so good as
to inform Mr. Stanley that, if he should intimate to them his
intention of permanently establishing by Act of Parliament the
system for the sale of land and immigration by them suggested,
coupled with securities for good government, they will, as a
private but temporary society, exert themselves to promote the
success of the measure.</p>

<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>March</i> 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Sent the above
letter to Lefevre, with a note (private) saying that I should
call on Monday to give him the rough draft of an Act of
Parliament, which would explain the most important articles
required by the committee. I omitted to state that on Friday,
when I was with Lefevre, he said that if it was decided to bring
in an Act of Parliament he would require my assistance, and that
I must be always with him.<br>
<br>
"<i>March</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Called on Torrens, who informed
me that he intended applying for the Governorship, and with that
view intended going to Lefevre to-day, and giving him a letter
for Stanley. I expressed my pleasure at hearing that he was going
to do so, and heartily wished him success.<br>
<br>
"<i>April</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;This morning I saw Lefevre,
according to appointment. The conversation between us was almost
a repetition of Lefevre's with Torrens. I gave him the digest of
the evidence as to the soil, &amp;c., with Wakefield's
preface&mdash;this he promised to give Stanley.<br>
<br>
"Before leaving, I told him I had the greatest desire that the
best man who could be found should be offered the governorship. I
would not mention names, but I thought it very important that no
person who held that, or any other high official situation,
should be allowed to trade in land&mdash;it would be just as
improper for the Governor to deal in land as it would be for the
Master of the Mint to trade in bullion, the Master-general of the
Ordnance to deal in stores, or for the Chancellor of the
Exchequer to negotiate loans. To this Lefevre quite assented, he
said he saw the great importance of such a provision, and it
should not be forgotten. As to men, ne asked me how I should like
Torrens as Governor? I replied that he was, in my opinion, the
most fit man I had ever seen for the appointment, and that he
would receive the suffrages of the committee, if they should be
appealed to.<br>
<br>
"This conversation I reported to Torrens, who was waiting for me
at the Golden Cross, and at 3 o'clock he had his interview with
Lefevre. Between the time of my leaving and his going to Lefevre,
Stanley had been talking to Lefevre about the measure. Lefevre
says he begged Stanley to look tenderly at the plan, for that he
took much interest in the matter. On this, Stanley said he was
like his predecessors. Hay had founded Fernando Po, Twiss had
founded Swan River, and he, Lefevre, wanted, he supposed, to
found Spencer's Gulf. However, he would at once consider the
matter, and he directed Lefevre to send all the papers about it
to his house that evening, especially the paper as to the soil,
which I had this morning given Lefevre. Lefevre, on the whole,
led Torrens to believe that there was no insurmountable
difficulty in the way, and said that on Wednesday at 2 o'clock he
should be able to give a decided answer.<br>
<br>
"<i>April</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Torrens again saw Lefevre. There
is no longer any difficulty in the way, unless the question of
money should be deemed one, and it is not yet sure how Stanley
may proceed with a view to putting the committee in the way to
getting this. I have before shown Lefevre how likely we were to
be placed in a vicious circle&mdash;we cannot actually get money
until we know decidedly how the Act of Parliament will run, and
if Stanley will not assure us of what the Act shall be, before he
sees the money, we shall do nothing. Lefevre tells Torrens that
the draft of the Act of Parliament which I privately gave in,
Stanley has seen and approves, with one remark only, 'that the
wording of the money clause is vague.'<br>
<br>
"Stanley wishes to see some of the leading city men, so as to
receive from them an assurance that money will be obtained, or at
least that there is a sufficient probability to justify him in
making the trial. The letter, therefore, which we are to receive
from Lefevre in answer to our last communication will be an
assent on Stanley's part to the plan, provided the preamble of
the Bill can be proved&mdash;that is, if money can be procured.
If the committee as a body will speak before Stanley, as they do
in committee, he will be assured that 'there is a fair
probability that the trial will be successful'&mdash;these are
Grote's cautious words. Nothing more is known about the
Governorship&mdash;Sir John Jeffcott has applied for the
appointment of judge.<br>
<br>
"<i>April</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Nothing important&mdash;I wrote,
however, a private note to Lefevre, begging him to word his
letter so as to keep to himself the writing of the Act of
Parliament, instead of leaving it to our committee&mdash;this on
the score of saving time, for I offered him the complete draft of
an Act written within three days, if he required it; it would
occupy our committee three weeks.<br>

Lefevre says that the letter, which we shall have in the course
of the day, will contain a promise to accede to our wishes, if we
can fulfil four conditions&mdash;1st. That the soil is fit for
colonisation; 2nd. That £35,000 should be invested in the
purchase of land; 3rd. That £650,000 was in the hands of the
persons going to the colony; 4th. That the expenses of the
Government should be provided for by the Association and to the
following amounts&mdash;for the first three years, £5,000 a year;
for the next three years, £8,000 a year; for the next four years,
£10,000. The letter will refer to the draft of the Act I gave
Lefevre, and will approve of it. It will also invite some persons
from the Association to see Stanley. Thus the matter may be
considered done at last, for with these four conditions it will
be easy to comply.<br>

<p class="quote">"<span class="u">Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
"I have received and laid before Mr. Secretary Stanley your
letter to me of the 21st ultimo, and the resolutions of the South
Australian Association which it contained. I have also brought
under his notice the rough draft of an Act furnished to me by Mr.
Gouger, which has been suggested as advisable to be brought in
for the purpose of founding a colony in South Australia.<br>
<br>
"I am directed by Mr. Secretary Stanley to state to you that,
approving of the general principles regarding emigration, upon
which the committee intended to found the proposed colony, he
should not be unwilling to sanction the experiment as defined in
the draft of the Act before referred to (reserving to himself the
power of suggesting such modifications as may appear to him to be
necessary), if the following points could be satisfactorily
established.<br>
<br>
"1st. That the district pointed out for the colony is favourable
in point of soil, climate, and water, for the establishment of a
colony.<br>
<br>
"2nd. That there are persons willing to purchase land in the
colony to an amount of not less than £36,000.<br>
<br>
"3rd. That there are persons willing to embark for the colony
with a capital of not less than £50,000.<br>
<br>
"4th. That there are sufficient funds actually subscribed for,
and effectually guaranteed, for the support of such parts of the
establishment of the colony as may appear to His Majesty's
Government to be absolutely essential (including a provision for
religious instruction) during the periods, and after the rates
following, <i>i.e</i>.,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first 3 years
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£5,000 per annum.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next 3 years
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
&nbsp;&nbsp;£8,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next 4 years
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. £10,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<br>
<br>
"Mr. Stanley is well aware of the difficulty of satisfying this
fourth condition, and he much doubts whether, upon the plan
suggested in the draft for raising a loan for these purposes, on
the security of the current revenues of the colony, a sufficient
fund could be obtained. At the same time, Mr. Stanley would not
feel justified in consenting to the foundation of any new colony
at present, unless the revenues of the Mother Country could be
thus protected from all expenses incidental to it.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Stanley perceives that, without some provisional sanction of
this scheme on his part, it would be almost impossible to
ascertain the disposition of the public with respect to it, but
he thinks that even such provisional sanction ought not to be
given, unless he should be furnished with good grounds for
believing that these points could be ascertained before a formal
application should be made to Parliament on the subject.<br>
<br>
"Upon the several foregoing points, therefore, Mr. Stanley would
be glad to see Mr. Whitmore, yourself, and any other three
gentlemen of the committee who might think proper to accompany
you on Friday the 18th instant, at 1 o'clock.</p>

<br>
<i>April</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Grote called to ask if we could
not have a meeting this evening at the House of Commons, to talk
over the question of the minimum price of land; accordingly, R.
Hill, Grote, Clay, Scrope, Hutt, Torrens, and Hanson, met me at
the House, and continued there till 11 o'clock. After a great
deal of irrelevant conversation, Grote, Clay, and Scrope,
appeared to decide upon fifteen shillings per acre, while
Torrens, Hanson, Hill, and Hutt, united with me in opposing so
low a price. At the end of the palaver I told Grote I hoped that
as soon as he saw that ample funds were ready for the purchase of
land in our colony, at a high price when compared with New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land, that he would move that the price of
other colonial land should be raised. This he caught at eagerly,
and said it ought clearly to be done.</p>
<p class="negindent4"><small>"<span class="a">Minute of
Conversation</span> with Mr. Secretary Stanley, revised by Clay
and Grote.</small></p>
<p class="quote">"The deputation consisted of Mr. Whitmore, Mr.
Grote, Mr. Raikes Currie, Colonel Torrens, Mr. J. Pottinger, Mr.
Clay, Mr. Gouger, and Mr. Mills; they were received by Mr.
Stanley in the presence of Mr. Lefevre and Mr. Earle.<br>
<br>
"The conversation commenced by Mr. Stanley remarking that the
soil of the proposed site did not appear from the evidence
presented to him to be decidedly fit for colonisation; it must be
admitted by all that it would be very desirable to know more upon
the subject. On this, Mr. Gouger asked to be allowed to point out
on the map the places where there was reason to believe water and
good soil were to be found. This was done, reference being made
in particular to the evidence of Captains Gould and Sutherland;
after which Mr. Stanley appeared to consider the proposed
locality fit for colonisation, and did not recur to the
subject.<br>
<br>
"He then asked what probability there was of the funds being
obtained which were necessary to found the colony; he
particularly mentioned the £35,000 for the purchase of land, and
the £50,000 which it was necessary the individuals should possess
who first emigrated to the colony. Mr. Grote, in answer,
expressed his opinion that these funds would be raised with
facility if an Act of Parliament were passed on the principles
recommended by the association, but until this were given us, no
one would consider the project a reality&mdash;Mr. Currie, Mr.
Clay, and Mr. Mills confirmed this opinion. Mr. Clay here
suggested that the best course would be, for a Bill to be brought
in at once and to be passed through the House without delay,
provision being made in the Act for its not being put into
operation until the conditions which Mr. Stanley required should
be fulfilled. This would make that a reality which was now a
thought, and would completely distinguish this plan from the
bubble schemes of 1825. Mr. Stanley appeared to give this idea
much consideration, and certainly seemed favourable to it; he did
not, however, express a decided answer in favour, but left the
deputation under the impression that he approved of Mr. Clay's
suggestion.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Stanley then asked what was to be the minimum price of land?
This caused some conversation, in the course of which Mr. Stanley
appeared to think that a price above, or even so high, as 10s.
per acre, would prevent persons possessed of capital going to the
colony, and being procurable at a much lower rate in other
colonies. This remark was answered by Mr. Grote and others, who
showed that it would be even more advantageous to capitalists to
give a considerable price for land, in the first instance,
because the low price would be attended with a proportionately
greater deficiency in the supply of labour,&mdash;which formed
the great bar to the prosperity of capitalists in a new colony.
It was finally determined that a sub-committee of the South
Australian Association should examine this subject, and that they
should report to Mr. Stanley both their opinion and the grounds
on which it rested.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Stanley then asked whether the funds for defraying the
Government expenses would be easily provided. To this question
Mr. Grote, Mr. Clay, Mr. Currie, and Mr. Mills gave a similar
opinion to that which they had previously given as to the
advancement of the funds for other purposes. It was here
mentioned by Mr. Grote that it was proposed that the money should
be raised at colonial interest, and that the rate ought to be
something about 8 per cent. Mr. Gouger here remarked that the
current interest of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land was
about 12½ per cent., and it would be no hardship on the colonists
of South Australia to pay 8 per cent., while that rate of
interest would be a sufficient inducement to English capitalists
to advance the money. Mr. Stanley then asked, where was the evil
of paying the advances for the government from the produce of the
sales of land&mdash;this would avoid a national debt being
incurred. Mr. Gouger answered this by saying such a measure would
be an infringement on the main principles of the plan of the
association, and would much complicate the question of minimum
price. Nor was such an addition to the price of land necessary
while individuals of the highest respectability were willing to
take bonds; such a security would be the best possible. To this
Mr. Stanley made no objection.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Stanley now enquired what plan it was proposed to pursue
relative to the first expedition? Mr. Gouger replied that perhaps
the commissioners would send out two ships, one of 200, and
another of 100 tons; the first would discharge her cargo on some
favourable point, and then proceed to Van Diemen's Land for food,
while the other would survey the coast. After about four or six
months, the most desirable site of the first town would be
ascertained, and about that time a third vessel would arrive,
filled with artisans and labourers, to form roads and to prepare
houses for the reception of the body of emigrants, which would
speedily afterwards follow.<br>
<br>
"In conclusion Mr. Stanley said that there appeared to be no
great difference in the views of the committee and of the
Government, and that he saw no reason for refusing his assent to
the measure, provided he were satisfied as to the minimum price
to be demanded for land; he must, however, submit the plan with
all its details to the different members of the Government for
their consideration.<br>
<br>
<br>
"After the meeting Torrens went to Lefevre privately, to learn if
anything were decided about the appointments. Torrens returned
dispirited. Lefevre says there is little chance for him, but
there is none for Pottinger. Stanley has some one in his eye for
Governor. This is a bad omen, for if Stanley is inclined to give
away the appointments according to the interest made by
individuals, and not according to the fitness of the persons,
there is much fear of the colony failing from that cause. This
excited much discussion between Edward and D. Wakefield and
myself, and it was determined to go to the House, to try to get
Whitmore to interfere privately. As to my own place, it was
determined that I should take the following letter to Lefevre, in
the morning of to-morrow, but this was not done from Whitmore
asking me for it in the House after a conversation with Edward
Wakefield.</p>

"That two hundred acres of land should therefore be sold for a
sum sufficient to carry out ten persons&mdash;half of them men

<br>
"That the cost of passage will probably be about £15 per

"That, in order to produce the first result, viz., the required

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<h4>VEXATIOUS DELAYS.</h4>
<p><span class="a">As</span> Mr. Gouger did not commence his
second Journal till January, 1835, it will be necessary to give a
brief sketch of events from the time when the first Journal
ceased, viz., from May, 1834.</p>
<p>Just when matters appeared to be on a fair footing, when Mr.
Gouger had sent in his draft of the proposed Bill, when the
energetic and persevering band of men who had devoted so much
time and thought to the colonisation of South Australia were
congratulating themselves that their success was now only a
question of days, there came a change of administration in the
Colonial Department, and Mr. Spring-Rice (afterwards Lord
Monteagle) succeeded Mr. Stanley as Secretary of State for the
Colonies.</p>
<p>Vexation, apprehension, and fear lest all the work would have
to be done over again, took possession of the provisional
committee, while poor Robert Gouger, who had known neither rest
of body nor mind for some years, was almost in despair. It is no
wonder that he ceased to record events in his Journal&mdash;like
Sisyphus, he no sooner reached the top of the hill than the heavy
stone fell back again. His was a most unthankful task; the
committee looked to him to do everything, while some of them did
nothing but consider what plums they could secure for themselves;
the waiting emigrants blamed him, and as there was no one else
upon whom they could expend their wrath, they vented it on him.
Some who had set him in the forefront of the battle drew back and
deserted him in his hour of need. But his faith failed not. He
did not pause to lament over the seemingly wasted years, during
which he had worked unceasingly without fee or reward other than
that which from the beginning had buoyed him up and urged him
on&mdash;the thought that he was engaged in a work which should
prove of lasting good, not only to his poorer fellow-creatures,
but to the nation at large.</p>
<p>Happily this period of anxiety did not last for long, and in
the end it worked good rather than evil. Mr. Spring-Rice took up
the cause with great spirit, and in course of time announced that
he was prepared to recommend the passing of a Bill on the
principles laid down by Mr. Gouger in his draft.</p>
<p>"The long-looked-for day at length arrived when 'a Bill to
erect South Australia into a British province, and to provide for
the colonisation and government thereof, was brought before the
House of Commons by Mr. Whitmore, with the sanction and approval
of the Colonial Secretary. Here it had many friends and
supporters&mdash;Lord Howick, Mr. J. Shaw-Lefevre, Lord Stanley,
and Mr. Spring-Rice, together with some of the Parliamentary
members of the provisional committee, doing yeoman's service, and
it passed the third reading without any serious hindrance. In the
House of Lords the Bill was introduced by the Marquis of
Normanby, and was so warmly supported by the Duke of Wellington
that the opposition, which at one time threatened to be
dangerous, was overcome. He expressed himself as deeply
interested in this new experiment in colonisation, and desired
that it might have a fair trial.* He also recommended that
Colonel Light, his companion in arms, should be the first
surveyor-general of the new colony. On the 15th of August, 1834,
the last day of the session, the Bill received the royal assent."

<p>The leading features of the Act (4 &amp; 5 Will. IV., cap. 95)
have been given in the preceding chapters of this work, and need
not be repeated here; but it will be well to call attention to
one part of the Act which, but for the timely intervention of one
member of the Board of Commissioners, might have rendered the
whole measure inoperative. It was this: the concluding clause of
the Act restrained the Commissioners from entering upon the
exercise of their general powers until they had invested £20,000
in Exchequer Bills, and until £35,000 worth of land had been
purchased.</p>
<p>With this brief introduction, we may now resume our quotations
from Mr. Gouger's Journal.</p>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:center;">1835.</div>
<p class="quote">"One year has now elapsed since the formation of
the South Australian Association. Thirteen months ago the
Association consisted but of two persons, Mr. Rhodes and myself.
Since that time how much has been accomplished? After delays the
most vexatious, an Act of Parliament has been passed empowering
the King to found the so long talked of colony. This first step,
achieved amidst annoyances and obstacles, only to be imagined by
those who have been engaged in this or similar work, has not,
however, been followed up with so much success as might
reasonably have been expected. The appointment of commissioners,
necessarily delayed in consequence of Mr. Grote's absence from
England, was unaccountably neglected by Mr. Spring-Rice, until he
was dismissed from office, and all hope of the thing proceeding
until the new Government was settled, was renounced by the whole
body of colonists. The new year is ushered in by considerable
political ferment, caused by the general election, and, before
the meeting of Parliament, little will be thought of by ministers
but party intrigues and plots for retaining
office.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lord Aberdeen rules at the Colonial
Office, while Stuart-Wortley and Hay are the
Under-Secretaries.<br>
<br>
"The body of emigrating capitalists is now very small. Six months
ago there were certainly more than 200 respectable families
desirous of emigrating, but the many and long delays which have
taken place during the progress of the work have consumed not
only the patience but the capital of a great number, most of
whom, therefore, are dispersed, some having gone to America and
some to our own colonies. The party commonly attending at the
Office can hardly be said to amount to two dozen families, and of
these but very few are possessed of much property. Edward
Wakefield is in Lisbon.<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;I returned to town from
Barkway, where I had been spending nearly three weeks. On
arriving at the Office on the following day, I met Colonel
Torrens, Dr. Wright, Kingston, Gilbert and Taylor. They had
written to me to come to town, as they had determined to wait no
longer, but to proceed at once to address the Colonial
Office.<br>
<br>
"It was finally determined that Torrens should obtain an
interview with Lord Aberdeen, and learn from him whether or not
he would allow us to choose our own commissioners, and whether he
would reverse or retain the nominations for colonial
appointments. In the meantime I agreed to furnish Torrens with
letters from Grote, Clay, and Norman, stating that they did not
withdraw from the commission in consequence of any alteration of
opinion as to the excellence of the measure. Torrens was also to
present Lord Aberdeen with the following list of names from which
the commissioners are to be selected.</p>

length decided on addressing the Duke of Wellington, and this
morning sent him the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">"<span class="u">My Lord Duke</span>,<br>

"The passage of the South Australian Colony Bill through the
House of Lords being entirely due to your Grace's expressed
approval of its object and plan, and having, during the
discussion on the Bill, had the honour of repeated interviews
with your Grace, I venture to address your Grace upon the
subject, although I am aware that any proceedings relative to the
Colony must emanate from a department of the State other than
that over which your Grace presides. If a further apology is
necessary for the liberty I have taken, I can only offer the
anxiety which I may be supposed to feel in. the advancement of a
measure to which I have devoted nearly five years of my life.<br>
<br>
"For some weeks before Mr. Rice ceased to be Colonial Minister,
the gentlemen who intended emigrating to South Australia expected
in each succeeding Gazette to find the appointment of
commissioners for carrying into effect the provision of the Act:
eight gentlemen, selected by Mr. Rice and Mr. Whitmore, had
consented to take upon themselves the office of commissioners,
and to perform the duties gratuitously, and the body of emigrants
eagerly hoped that as soon as the appointment of the commission
should be sanctioned by His Majesty, nothing remained to cause
fresh delay. On the dissolution of the late Administration,
however, the gentlemen who had accepted the office of
commissioners refused to act, but not, according to their own
declaration, in consequence of any change in opinion relative to
the beneficial character of the measure. Notwithstanding this
refusal, the body of colonists feel assured that the present
Government will give to a measure so totally divested of party
politics, the same encouragement which it received from the late
Administration, and they propose to request the Secretary of
State for the Colonial Department to appoint other commissioners
who they are convinced will fulfil the provisions of the Act with
equal readiness and ability.<br>
<br>
"Under these circumstances, and not having the honour of being
known to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, I venture to
express a hope that your Grace may not refuse to favour me with
such a note, or so to mention the subject of the colony to the
Earl of Aberdeen, as will secure for me, on the part of the
colonists, a reception from his Lordship different from that
which, as a total stranger, I could hope to obtain.</p>

"<i>January</i> 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;According to appointment,
Colonel Torrens and I went to Lord Aberdeen to-day at 2 o'clock.
We were received in the presence of the eternal Under-Secretary
and Marplot-Hay. His Lordship put on a most austere manner, which
seemed to augur anything but well. His appearance partakes of the
quaint precision of a methodist parson, the cynical expression of
Lord Brougham, and the pride of Lucifer. Colonel Torrens
commenced by saying that in consequence of the change of
ministry, Mr. Grote, Mr. Clay, and several others of those
persons who had consented to be commissioners now withdrew, and
that consequently the colony was no nearer foundation than
immediately after the passage of the Bill. He concluded by asking
leave of His Lordship to grant to him the same power which was
allowed by Mr. Rice, viz., to lay before him a list of names of
persons willing now to act as commissioners. To this Lord
Aberdeen replied that he could not understand how those gentlemen
who had agreed to act while the late ministry was in rule, could
refuse to act now; he did not consider the measure a question of
party politics, nevertheless he could not quarrel with those
gentlemen's decision. He would readily allow us to name to him
persons who were willing to act, and if in his opinion they were
fit, he would appoint them whether they agreed with the present
Government in politics or not. Torrens replied that we saw the
necessity of procuring the aid of the best people possible, for
unless such were appointed, neither could the loan be raised in
the City, nor could respectable emigrants be induced to go to the
colony. To this Lord Aberdeen acquiesced. On my remarking that I
believed Mr. Rice had intended to nominate as commissioner one of
the gentlemen in the Colonial Office (Mr. Elliott had been
mentioned), Hay replied, 'an inferior in the office certainly
could not be appointed.' On the whole the interview was
favourable. All we desired was granted, but it was done in such a
manner as to leave an impression on my mind that it is still
intended to burke the colony if possible."</p>

disposed to appoint the commissioners, irrespective of their

<p>The importance of this letter cannot be overestimated. Mr.
George Fife Angas was a man of sterling Christian character, of
great wealth, and of wide influence. For the previous four years
he had been carefully watching the progress of the movement in
favour of colonisation in South Australia, and at one time had
taken an active part in the deliberations of the provisional
committees. On him was to devolve the solution of the monetary
difficulty that stood in the way of everything, and would, but
for his assistance, have rendered the Act of Parliament
inoperative.</p>

<p class="quote">"<i>January</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Stuart
Wortley has resigned acting as Under Secretary for the Colonies,

"<i>February</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;In the afternoon Torrens saw
Hay The ostensible object of the interview was to ask if the
names obtained were strong enough for the appointment; the real
object was to propitiate Hay. Torrens reports that this is
completely effected. Hay said that, 'whatever his opinion as to
the measure had been, and whether or not he thought we wanted
more colonies, his course now must be different. The Legislature
had decided that another colony should be formed, and the
business of the Colonial Office now was to put the act into
execution; he would therefore render the measure all the aid he
could. He complained of the attacks which had been made upon him,
and said they were unfair.' Torrens replied, 'he had always
objected to them, and he sincerely hoped there would be no more
of them.' He asked who was chairman now that Whitmore had left
us, and on Torrens saying that no one but himself, amongst the
old commissioners, was moving in the matter, he said that he
should consider him (Torrens) chairman. Torrens, having remarked
that he would take care no objectionable names were connected
with them, then withdrew.<br>
<br>
"This interview is doubtless important, and, if Hay is in good
faith, will tend much to expedite matters.<br>
<br>
"<i>February</i> 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;It was now decided by
Torrens, R. Hill, Brown, and myself, at once to send in the names

more knowledge of the object and principles of the proposed

<p class="quote">"I gave Torrens, on a slip of paper, a familiar
description of these gentlemen, so that, if required, he might
not be at fault in relation to them. This he accidentally left
with Hay&mdash;though in the hands of an enemy it can hardly do
harm.<br>
<br>
"With these documents in his hand Torrens went to Hay, and the
following is an account of the interview, taken down from
Torrens' dictation immediately on his return; it was given, at my
request, in the presence of Brown.<br>
<br>
"After Torrens had read the list of names and their description,
Hay remarked that it would be necessary to ascertain in what way
the commissioners could be held responsible for the due execution
of their duties&mdash;suppose they were to resign in the midst of
their operations, leaving the colonists to shift for themselves.
Torrens replied, that must not be considered as an absolutely
impossible case, yet it must be nearly as improbable as that the
Government of England should throw up its functions, leaving the
country to shift for itself. That of the gentlemen who
volunteered to act, some might look to honour, some to future
emolument, some to the gratification of benevolent motives, and
that these motives were as likely to be permanent as the motives
which induced the Government itself to act. Hay said, there
should be some penalty on their resigning; to this Torrens made
no reply. Hay then said, that though the Government assented to
the measure, they did not altogether approve of it; and that, if
such a colony was to be established, they would prefer
administering it themselves. Torrens replied, that, in point of
fact, the Colonial Office had the management of the colony; they
had the appointment of the Governor, and of the whole of the
colonial functionaries, just the same as in any other colony, and
that the commissioners under the Act could be considered in no
other light than as an emigration committee, whose business it
was to sell the colonial land, and to employ the proceeds in
sending out poor emigrants. Hay then asked, what would become of
the poor emigrants if the commissioners declined? Torrens
replied, that if the functions of the commissioners should cease,
the only consequence would be, that unless the Government chose
to sell the land themselves, no more land would be sold, and no
more emigrants would be sent out. Mr. Hay asked, in this case,
what would become of the emigrants already sent out; Government
could not sanction a plan which would endanger their being left
in destitution. Torrens replied, it was impossible they could be
left in destitution, because no emigrants could be sent out
except in conjunction with capitalists who required their
services in the colony. That, previous to sending out any poor
emigrants, capitalists requiring their services must have paid
down the price of their passage in the purchase of land, and
that, therefore, by the plan of the colony there could be no
labourers without capitalists to give them employment. This
answer appeared to satisfy Hay on this point, who paid that the
questions would require further and more deliberate
consideration, and that Lord Aberdeen would send a very early
reply to the letter then delivered.'<br>
<br>
"Thus ended this interview with the ancient foe to South
Australia. It is clear his enmity is not eradicated, though
Torrens thinks all will yet go smoothly. For myself I dubitate
greatly.<br>
<br>
"<i>February</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Received from Hay the
following letter:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">
"<span class="u">Downing Street</span>, 16<i>th

<p class="quote">"<span class="u">Sir</span>,<br>
<br>
"I am directed by the Earl of Aberdeen to acknowledge the receipt
of your letter to his Lordship of the 13th instant, enclosing the
names of various gentlemen willing to act under his Lordship's
authority as commissioners for carrying into effect the Act or
Parliament for colonising Southern Australia.<br>
<br>
"Lord Aberdeen considers it to be an essential preliminary to the
further discussion of the subject, that it should be distinctly
understood whether the proposed commissioners are, or are not, to
be accountants to the Crown, and personally responsible for the
receipt and application of the money to arise from the sale of
lands in the proposed colony. By the 9th clause, the power of
appointing a treasurer and other officers, and of removing such
treasurer and officers, and of appointing successors, is given to
the commissioners, and by the 11th clause it is declared that all
monies under the control of the Board shall be received and paid
by the treasurers so appointed, who are to give securities for
the faithful discharge of their duties to such amount, and in
such manner as to the said commissioners may seem fit. The
following clause, the 12th, enacts that all accounts of the
treasurer shall be submitted to the Lords of His Majesty's
Treasury, and be audited in the same manner as other public
accounts. The Act also gives to the commissioners extensive power
of selling or leasing land, of receiving and applying the
purchaser money or the rent, and of taking up large sums at
interest. The 21st clause absolves the commissioners from
personal liability to the lenders for any loans which they may so
raise, or on any bonds which they may issue. But Lord Aberdeen
does not perceive in this Act any declaration that the
commissioners shall not be accountable to the Lords of the
Treasury for the receipts and payments effected by their
treasurer with their order or concurrence. His Lordship presumes
that all the money which they shall receive as commissioners must
be considered as part of the King's revenue, and that the
commissioners, not being a corporate body, must be regarded only
as His Majesty's agents (though appointed under the authority of
Parliament) for the management, receipt and expenditure of that
part of the revenue of the Crown. The treasurer being their
nominee, liable to removal at their bidding, and by no other
authority, and giving securities subject only to their
approbation, would seem to be in effect their agent, for whose
acts they would be answerable to the Lords of the Treasury. In
confirmation of this view of the subject, it may be noticed that
the Governor of New South Wales (in common with the Governors of
His Majesty's Colonies) is held responsible to the Lords of the
Treasury for all issues of money made by the Colonial Treasurer
with his sanction, although the Colonial Treasurer is appointed,
and, when necessary, removed, by the Crown, and enters into such
securities as the Lords of the Treasury prescribe.<br>
<br>
"Lord Aberdeen being led to apprehend from the tenor of your
letter, and from the language of the enclosures, that the
gentlemen proposing to act as commissioners consider themselves
as completely irresponsible to the Lords of the Treasury, his
Lordship thinks it right that their attention should be
distinctly drawn to the question in order that they may, if
necessary, by consulting His Majesty's Attorney, and
Solicitor-General, ascertain what would be the legal consequences
in this respect of their undertaking the proposed Trust. You will
have the goodness to understand that Lord Aberdeen does not
intimate&mdash;as, in fact, he has not formed&mdash;any decided
opinion upon this matter, but thinks it of such essential
importance, and involved in such obscurity, as to require a
solution of the question on the highest accessible authority
before the discussion advances further.</p>

<br>
<p class="quote">"After much consultation on this letter, between
Torrens and myself, we agreed that there was nothing in it
tending to discourage or to lead us to suspect Hay of renewed bad
faith. We, moreover, agreed that the commissioners ought to
sustain the responsibility required of them, which is nothing
more than a pledge for honesty and honour. Having thus
determined, we called on Hay according to appointment, though we
had little to say to him. He received us very civilly, and
behaved in a very different manner to that which he manifested
when Torrens last saw him. Torrens and I told him we saw nothing
in his letter but what should be answered in the affirmative. Hay
replied, he must have such an opinion expressed in writing by
each of the commissioners. We thanked him for his promptitude; he
said he would not allow of delay in our matter, but would help us
all he could. Torrens then gave him a paper relative to the
Church Society, and the rules of the Literary Association; and on
my telling him that they were put into his hand merely to show
that there existed a body of persons willing to go to the colony,
and who were somewhat above the common class of emigrants, he
replied, they certainly proved that some persons, fond of
intellectual pursuits, were prepared to emigrate with us.<br>

obtained over ignorance and prejudice in getting the Act of
Parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. D. Wakefield was totally wrong in the conclusion to which
he had jumped. There was no "winding-up of the business" in
contemplation, and his conversation "with hundreds" on the "total
failure of the project" was as prejudicial to the interests of
the Association as it was untrue. It was a part of Mr. Gouger's
"luck" to be associated with men who would cry "Wolf, wolf!" when
there was no wolf, and it tended greatly to increase the burden
of his labour.</p>
<p>Mr. Wakefield's letter created "no little surprise" to the

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<h4>APPOINTMENTS.</h4>
<p><span class="a">The</span> letter of Lord Aberdeen, of the
16th of February, 1835, relating to the functions of the proposed
commissioners, and suggesting a consultation with His Majesty's
Attorney and Solicitor-General, caused a long and irritating
delay at a very critical time. Mr. Gouger was sent from pillar to
post, day after day, one Department of the State referring him to
another, and that other referring him back again, as the manner
of officialism is, until he could bear it no longer. More than a
month passed, every day full of such vexatious and wearisome
circumlocution as would have taxed the patience of Job, and a
record of which would undoubtedly have tried the patience of the
reader if inserted here. At length came the following entries in
the Journal.</p>
<p class="quote">"<i>March</i> 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Though Sunday,
called on Torrens, and after a long search, found him. I then
told him that unless he would move, I would. The procrastination
was no longer bearable.<br>
<br>
"<i>March</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Met Torrens and told him
everything that had occurred since Monday last, and said that,
although I saw the importance of our meeting daily, I would not
waste time by waiting hours for him. He wishes me to meet him
every day precisely at 1 o'clock, at his lodgings, and this I
have agreed to do. He tells me that Edward Wakefield is coming to
town, and that in his opinion he must be conciliate&mdash;this is
all very well, but the business must not be sacrificed to
him.<br>
<br>
"<i>April</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;To-day I saw Torrens and gave him
the letter I had for him. It was merely to say that the business
had been dismissed from the Treasury. Ha informed me that he saw
Hay on Friday, who told him that nothing had to be determined
now, but to fix on the Under-Secretary who was to sit in the
commission.<br>
<br>
"I have had a long conversation with Westall. He proposes to sell
me six engravings of South Australia for £15 each. I have
consented to purchase them, and shall at once issue a prospectus
about them.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Several of Westall's original sketches are now
in the library of the Royal Colonial Institute, London.]</p>
<p class="quote">"<i>April</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Called at the
Colonial Office on Hay with Torrens, but could not see him.
Torrens wrote a note asking him to lay before Lord Aberdeen the
papers immediately. The division against the Government last
night, causes much dread that ministers will resign before our
matter is concluded.<br>
<br>
"<i>April</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;The ministers have resigned, and
consequently another delay must be incurred. During four
administrations at the Colonial Office have we been working this
measure. Lord Goderich, Stanley, Rice, Aberdeen, and now
another.</p>

February last as commissioners for carrying into effect the
provisions of the Act of Parliament for colonising South
Australia, have been approved by his Lordship. In reply I am
directed to acquaint you, that under the present circumstances of
the Government, Lord Aberdeen does not feel at liberty to proceed
with the arrangements of the South Australian Company. I am
directed to add, that it was not until the 4th instant that the
decision of the Board of Treasury was received at this

chooses to appoint another man, he is welcome, but I will adhere,

down for myself; namely, not to ask any government for an
appointment, and, as I am exceedingly poor, I cannot afford to
throw away another shilling in attendance upon the <i>convulsive
fits</i> of the Colonial Office, which end in nothing I Till I am
gazetted, I have neither right, or inclination, to interfere in
anything, and therefore, by going to London, I do nothing but
lose money, and, consequently, independence of mind; for he who
lays out money in the public service, must make it up by getting
employment, and to get this, he must ask favours, which I will
not do. I shall therefore wait a little while upon the course of
events. If I see another man appointed, I shall, as they say,
'<i>follow my own inventions</i>.' If <i>I</i> be appointed, I
shall go, at once, to town, and work as hard as I can in the

<p class="quote">"<i>May</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;The commissioners
are to-day gazetted, and thus the next important step in the
formation of the colony is taken.<br>
<br>
"<i>May</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Colonel Torrens, Hutt, Angas, and
Rowland Hill dined with me to-day. After dinner Hill read his
proposed terms for selling land; these were violently opposed by
Torrens, who has a mortal antipathy to the auction plan. Hutt
differed from Torrens' view, as also from that of Angas, who
maintains that the tender is useless, and the auction the only
fair plan. I fear there will be some difficulty in bringing these
views into anything like harmony.<br>
<br>
"<i>May</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;The first meeting of the
commissioners took place to-day at Osborne's Hotel. It was
attended by all, with the exception of Wright and Mills. The Act
was read and discussed, and finding that the first thing to be
done by the commissioners was to take the required oath,
arrangements for doing so were ordered to be made. The next thing
to be done was the appointment of a secretary, but as nothing
could be legally done until the oath were taken, Mr. Rowland Hill
was requested to act as secretary <i>pro tempore</i>. A
sub-committee, consisting of Hutt, Angas, and Lefevre, was
appointed for the purpose of considering and reporting to the
Board on the best mode of selling land. Torrens, as chairman, is,
of course, on all sub-committees. Adjourned to 2 o'clock on
Monday. The best feeling pervaded the Board; a good deal of
conversation took place on the formation of a Joint Stock Company
for the purchase of land; the general feeling was in favour of
the measure; but on the necessity of an Act of Parliament being
urged, and the disinclination of the colonists to such a
proposal, the conversation ended in nothing.<br>
<br>
"<i>May</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;The commissioners were to-day
sworn into their office before Mr. Baron Gurney, and at one
o'clock the Sub-committee on Land met. Again the best feeling was
evinced by them, and consequently much progress was made. The
price was fixed at twelve shillings, and Hill's plan of allotting
half-an-acre of town land to every £50 subscription to the sum of
£85,000, required by the Act of Parliament, was agreed to. The
mode of distribution of town lots to be determined by the
subscribers to the fund. The mode of tender for land purchased in
the colony was also adopted, and the matter would soon have been
finally determined, had not the hour of the Board arrived. Six
members attended&mdash;Torrens, Hutt, Angas, Palmer, and Hills. A
resolution requesting me to attend the meetings of the Board
during my stay in England was passed unanimously. Palmer
mentioned Biddulph's wish to be the treasurer, and to supply all
money required for present purposes, and Hutt mentioned my
brother's readiness to attend the Board at their next meeting, to
learn from the commissioners whether or not he could be appointed
agent, and if so, they could put the advance of money upon a
business-like footing.<br>
<br>
"<i>May</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;I received this morning from Hutt
two letters, one from Mr. Whitmore and one from Lord Glenelg.
These appear to indicate that I am in a fair way for my
appointment. Nevertheless, by way of placing my services on
record, by the advice of Hutt and Rowland Hill, I addressed to
Lord Glenelg the underwritten letter.</p>
<br>

<p class="quote">"<span class="u">My Lord</span>,<br>
<br>
"Though I cannot hope to add any reasons to those already offered
to your Lordship by Colonel Torrens and Mr. Hutt personally, and
by Mr. Whitmore and Mr. Grote by letter, why your Lordship should
confer upon me the appointment of Colonial Secretary for South
Australia&mdash;I beg leave to lay before your Lordship a
statement, which will in some measure indicate the time and
exertion I have devoted to the prosecution of the plan for
founding the colony.<br>
<br>
"Early in 1830, in conjunction with Mr. Hutt, I founded a
society, whose object it was to show the evils arising from
giving land away, attaching conditions of cultivation to
occupiers of land, and to make known to the public those
principles of colonisation on which the new province is to be
founded. The existence of the society was short; but its
publications induced Lord Howick, when Under-Secretary of State
for the Colonies, partially to adopt the plan of the society, and
to issue, in January, 1831, those terms for selling land in New
South Wales and Van Diemen's land which have since remained in
force, and which have been the means of raising, for the purposes
of the Government, a very considerable revenue.<br>
<br>
"In the autumn of 1830, I proposed the foundation of a colony in
South Australia by means of a Land Company, to which plan,
however, Lord Goderich, after a correspondence of many months,
saw reason to decline acceding.<br>
<br>
"In June, 1833, Mr. Stanley being Secretary of State for the
Colonial Department, I renewed the negotiation with Mr. Wolryche
Whitmore, and the proposition being in the main approved by Mr.
Stanley, the South Australian Association was formed for the
purpose of assisting in carrying the measure. To this association
I acted as Hon. Sec., and the object and plan, meeting at length
with Mr. Stanley's complete approval, during Mr. Rice's
administration at the Colonial Department, the sanction of the
Legislature was given to it. On the secession of the gentlemen
selected by Mr. Rice and Mr. Whitmore as commissioners, Lord
Aberdeen directed Colonel Torrens and myself to form the
commission which your Lordship has just appointed.<br>
<br>
"During the long period in which I have been thus engaged, not
only have my exertions been wholly unrequited, but I have
expended a considerable sum of money, and refused some lucrative
offers, that I might persevere in the prosecution of the subject.
I allude to this to show that, as far as services go, I may urge
some claims on your Lordship's consideration. On the point of
ability for the office to which I aspire, besides the testimony
of the gentlemen mentioned above, I may refer your Lordship to
the correspondence of the South Australian Association with the
Colonial Office; and for my bearing in life and general fitness
for the office, not only can I refer to the gentlemen who formed
the committee of the South Australian Association, but to a
memorial which I have been given to understand the body of
persons going to the colony forwarded last autumn through Mr.
Whitmore and Mr. Rice, of the purport of which I was ignorant
until several weeks after its presentation.</p>

<p class="quote">"<i>May</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;The Board met
to-day. Angas thinks that enough bonus is not allowed to the
first settlers, and he therefore wishes to have the whole of the
£35,000 worth, purchased by the first body, selected before any
other person can tender for land. This occupied at least an hour
in the discussion. I was strenuously opposed to it on the ground
of its obliging any person who had emigrated in the first body,
though unfortunate enough to come in after the £36,000 had been
subscribed, going so far from the town for land He must
necessarily, go at least fifteen or twenty miles. After all, the
point is not determined.<br>
<br>
"<i>May</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;At a meeting of the sub-committee
on land, I proposed, to obviate the objections of Angas and
Lefevre, that the town should be divided into 3,000 lots of one
acre each, the subscribers to the £35,000 to have the privilege
of selection among this number of lots. This was finally agreed
to, and another meeting was fixed for to-morrow to arrange the
wording of the terms.<br>
<br>
"<i>May</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Saw Napier. He tells me that he
has made his acceptance of the office of governor dependent upon
Government assenting to his having under his command a body of
troops, and leave to draw on the Government here for £100,000 in
case of distress I Lord Glenelg entertained the idea, says
Napier, and will speak to his colleagues about it I Napier tells
me that his appointment is safe.<br>
<br>
"In the afternoon I again saw Napier. He says that Lord Glenelg
cannot agree to the proposition he made relative to the troops,
and leave to draw on Government, but recommended Napier to go and
call on the commissioners and hear their opinion. Consequently
Napier went, and found them all sitting in council on the terms
for selling land. He there restated his terms, and he says was
answered by 'absurd generalisations.'<br>
<br>
"Since writing the above I have seen Hill, who gives a very
different report of Napier's visit to the commissioners. They
think him mad, and his conduct was so annoying to them that they
agreed to try and prevent his being governor. He said he would
not trust to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land taking off the
labourers should they be distressed. He would have a King's ship
there for the purpose, with other trash of the same kind. Torrens
was so perturbed as to get to something like high words with
Napier. However, he left, and on his leaving it was agreed that
Barnard should go to the Colonial Office, to try to prevent the
continuance of their negotiation with him, and to appoint
somebody else in his stead. Napier has certainly put on a new
style of action.<br>
<br>
"The interruption of Napier, prevented the commissioners
finishing the terms of selling land; a new idea was started by
Barnes, which, indeed, would have prevented this at any rate. He
suggests that all land shall be sold for 12s. an acre, subject to
a land-tax, which shall be the matter of competition. Thus, when
an eligible situation is offered for sale, the competitors will
bid up the land-tax, and so provide a fund for the maintenance of
Government. Mr. Freshfield's opinion is to be taken as to its
legality.<br>
<br>
"<i>May</i> 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Received letter from Brown. The
intelligence of my appointment being confirmed is the source of
no small woe at Barkway, though, of coarse, expected.<br>
<br>
"On my arrival in town I found the annexed letter awaiting me
from Edward Wakefield. He has written, it seems, to Torrens,
Hill, and Hutt. The last of these read his letter in part to the
commissioners at their meeting yesterday, but its arguments did
not change the course of action adopted by the
commissioners:&mdash;</p>

<br>
"I find it necessary to write a few lines about the colony.<br>
<br>
"Unable to tell whether you are a party to the plan for making
12s. the minimum price for land, I hardly know what to say, but
must say something.<br>
<br>
"As you have known my opinion on that subject ever since you have
known me, I need not repeat it, nay, I trust that you hold it
now, but still fear that you may become the advocate of some
other opinion. In the latter case I have a request to make, which
is, that you will take some method of letting the commission know
that I have always thought £2 the very lowest price that ought to
be required for the object in view. I have written upon the
subject to those of the commissioners whom I know, but still wish
to take some means of representing to the others that I do not
agree with you, if it be so. My opinion is of no consequence to
them, but it is of great consequence to me that such of them as
know of our intimate connection in this affair should not suppose
that you express my opinion, if, in fact, you do not. If they
start with 12s., the colony will be a second Swan River, and if
you support that price, many people will naturally suppose that I
do. It is for the sake of a year or two hence that I wish to
guard myself from only a seeming participation, through you, in
an experiment which, in my opinion, <i>must</i> fail. The
principle is mine, and I have a right to defend it from the
injury which it would sustain, if the colony, with 12s. for land,
were considered a fair trial of the principle. With 12s. for the
lowest price, whatever the average may be by means of auction,
this colony will be no trial of the principle which it has cost
me so much pains to establish thus far. On the contrary, with
that lowest price and freedom of appropriation which is not
permitted elsewhere, this colony will be worse off for hired
labour than Canada or New South Wales, and will fall into a very
low place in my catalogue of beggarly new colonies. But you know
my views on the subject as well as you know your alphabet; and I
will therefore only request that you will find an opportunity of
saying to the commission what my opinion has always been and
still remains. I could, of course, address them in their official
character, but prefer leaving it to you to make a statement, in
the way you like best, of the total difference of opinion between
us (if it exist) on this, by far the most important point in the
whole affair. If, however, you have not wholly changed your mind
on the subject, you must be almost as anxious as I am to see a
much higher price adopted. In that case, I will take some other
method of telling the commission that 12s. will not be considered
as carrying into effect the plan which we put forth in 1829, and
which we steadily supported, without allowing a single important
change in it, up to the passing of the South Australian Act.<br>
<br>
"You will, I hope, see my object in this distinction. If our
connection had continued, I should have said: 'Speak out! battle
for the truth; be no party to an ordinary new colony.' But
supposing that you may have changed your mind, and reflecting
that I can no longer support you in a controversy, I will not
lead you into one which you might think likely to hurt your
prospects, and therefore say: Do not mention the subject if you
still agree with me, but state what my opinion was, and is, in
case you agree in the proposal to make 12s. the lowest price; and
at all events, let me know what you do.<br>
<br>
"So far as concerns me and the new colonising principle. On your
own account, I long to add some of the arguments by which, just
this time six years ago, you were induced to abstain from going
to ruin at the Swan River. But I will still hope that South
Australia is to be something very superior to that abortion.</p>

has always been at variance with so low a price as 12s."<br>

"The projected subdivision of the commissioners in three

"<i>May</i> 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Two gentlemen called to-day at the
office, having rather important errands. Mr. Barton Hack, a
Quaker, called to say he has some friends, persons of capital,
desirous to emigrate. He appears to be a highly respectable man,
and is very well connected. The other is a Captain Hindmarsh, a
post-captain in the navy, who wishes to be appointed Governor. He
has letters from Lords Auckland, Palmerston, Howick, Sir Pulteney
Malcolm and others, asking for the appointment for him. He
appears to be a jovial, hearty and energetic man. I have directed
him to Lefevre.<br>
<br>
"<i>May</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Called on Lefevre with Hill to see
the terms for selling land which he has devised. His plan is to
sell the first £35,000 worth of land at 12s. 6d. an acre (80
acres for £50), and then to raise the price to 17s. 6d. per
acre&mdash;the decision between two or more persons for the same
lot of land to be by auction. This plan much simplifies the
matter, and I hope will be adopted. I urged upon Lefevre the
necessity of coming to an early decision&mdash;the commission
having now been gazetted a month, and no public step having been
taken. He concurred in the necessity of getting at I once into
operation, and said he would be ready by J Tuesday next to lay
before the Board his perfected plan. Speaking of Captain
Hindmarsh, he says he has seen Sir P. Malcolm, who gives the very
best character of the captain, both publicly and privately. He is
very distinguished as a naval officer, having been engaged in
every naval combat since Lord Howe's of the first of June, 1794,
and particularly noticed by Lord Nelson. He has a wife and four
children, three of whom are daughters above 15 and under 22 years
of age.<br>

"Rowland Hill has to-day received a long letter from Edward
Wakefield, still urging the old topic (£2 an acre for land) and
speaking of me as his mere delegate in the previous committees!
This gentleman will not let me get away without a downright
quarrel with him, and Hill himself thinks he wishes to quarrel
with him. I have to-day sent the following letter to him in
answer to his of the 25th May:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:right; margin-right:5%;">"5,
<span class="u">Hinde Street</span>.</div>
<p class="quote">"<span class="u">Dear Wakefield</span>,<br>
<br>
"I think you have unnecessarily taken alarm about the price
intended to be asked for land in South Australia, and I fancy by
the style of your letter of the 25th that you have been
misinformed as to my declaration upon that subject. I am now, as
much as ever, an advocate for what is commonly called a high
price of land&mdash;that is, such a price as will, by combination
of labour, enable the purchaser to cultivate his land
advantageously. What that price is, you, as well as I, maintain
must be left to experience to determine; in the meantime, we
agree that it is better to begin at a price decidedly too low,
than at one decidedly too high. So far principle.<br>
<br>
"Now for expediency. I am clearly of opinion that if anything
like the price you mention in your letter signed 'Kangaroo' be
fixed by the commissioners, the colony will never be founded, for
no one will buy land at that price, unless it be a joint-stock
company, which shall have power given it to take the site of the
town&mdash;nor do I think £2 an acre can be obtained. To enable
the commissioners to do anything, therefore, I have been induced
to agree to 12s. being required for land until the conditions of
the Act be complied with, on the understanding that the price is
then to be considerably advanced. That this concession to
expediency will ruin the colony I cannot for one moment
believe&mdash;nay, I do not think it will cause any injury, for
if labourers be wanting after the expenditure of the £35,000 and
before fresh sales take place, the 17th clause of the Act meeting
the difficulty, empowers the commissioners to raise money on loan
to send out emigrants.<br>
<br>
"I have to-day told the commissioners in conformity with your
wish, that you hold different views to mine upon this
subject.</p>
<div class="quote" style="text-align:right; margin-right:25%;">"I

<br>
<p class="quote">"<span class="u">My Dear Gouger</span>,<br>
<br>
"I have not 'taken alarm' about the price for land. My present
opinion is nearly seven years old. I think now, on the subject of
price, exactly as I thought during the long period when my
opinions were represented by you.<br>
<br>
"I do not maintain that the question of price ought to be left to
experience. Unless the price be high enough for its object, it
will be the same as no price at all. To begin with, no price
would be absurd. I look upon 128. as no price, in this sense. It
is not a <i>hired-labour</i> price. Beginning with that price,
there will be no experiment, no <i>experience</i> of anything but
disaster.<br>
<br>
"How do you know that nobody will buy land at a sufficient price?
That experiment has not yet been tried. That experiment may be
tried here without risk to anyone.<br>
<br>
"We wholly disagree, you see, on what you call principle. I must
now consider you as one of the opponents of my principle.<br>
<br>
"On the two points in your letter which you place under the head
of expediency, I again disagree with you, I think that people
here will be <i>more</i> ready to pay a sufficient than an
insufficient price; and I sincerely hope that, with an
insufficient price, the colony may <i>not</i> be founded.<br>
<br>
"The supposition that, 'if labourers were wanting,' the want
could be supplied by means of the 17th clause of the Act, appears
to me to be a delusion. After the want was felt, four months must
elapse before the commission could even know of it; and four more
before they could supply it. But in the course of those eight
months the want would have disappeared; the colony would have
been made like Swan Kiver during that period of its existence
when labourers were glad to emigrate to Van Diemen's Land; and
the new supply of labourers would not even find employment. The
17th clause of the Act may help to prevent, but cannot cure, a
want of labourers for hire.<br>
<br>
"We wholly disagree, you see, as to both principle and
expediency.<br>
<br>
"I am obliged to you for having spoken to the commissioners, as
you have thereby saved me, and my plan of colonisation, from all
responsibility as to the success of this undertaking. My firm
belief is that, if the commissioners should act in agreement with
you, the first expedition will prove a lamentable failure. Yoa
and I have often foretold as much, and for the very reasons which
I still urge.</p>

and is ready to lend a willing hand. A meeting of the publication
committee having been ordered at Lefevre's rooms at Somerset
House, Hindmarsh and I went down, and almost immediately after
Angas came in. He has very much assisted in publishing the
measure in the West of England, and intends to take himself
£5,000 worth of land, to be divided into small farms and let on
lease to small farmers, who will be supplied with, money by him,
the tenants having leave to purchase the estate at their
convenience at a given price. The sub-committee ordered 8,000
copies of the 'regulations' to be printed, and £10 worth of
advertisements in the country. The register to-day show £2,500
subscribed for land.<br>

tells me of two or three youths who will be under his care in the
colony, and who must be in some way provided for; of these, young
Torrens is one.<br>
<br>
"<i>July</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;After the last meeting I went to
Barkway and was detained there by illness. On my return I found
the Board assembled at a special meeting to fix the offices and
salaries. Before I arrived, a resolution had been passed obliging
the officers to purchase land in proportion to their salaries,
for each £100 of salary they were to purchase £500 of land. The
absurdity of this was evident at once, but as it had been
proposed by Torrens, and had been already passed, I did not think
it prudent to disturb the meeting.<br>

sending it, however, I showed it to Lefevre, who was immediately

subject to the reconsideration of that part of them.<br>

Gravesend to see the embarkation of the girls for Van Diemen's

a respectable class. During the passage down I had much
conversation with Angas and Montefiore in relation to the

Gilles and Wakefield.<br>

of them from very good men. Sir P. Malcolm again promises to get
us a King's ship to go out in, and as a great favour, has given
me a favourite shepherd dog.<br>
<br>
"<i>July</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;At the meeting of the Board
to-day the proposition for qualification of officers by buying
land was negatived. The questions of appointments then followed,
and Wakefield was proposed by Torrens as candidate for judge.
This was universally disliked, and after a great deal of
conversation, in which all present took part (excepting myself
and Hill), it was agreed that he should be offered a compensation
in money for the labour he had performed, and, it was added by
Lefevre, that it was to be hoped the hint would be taken. It was
ordered that the applicants should all send in testimonials.
Brown was nominated commissioner of Emigration and
Auditor-General, and Kingston Deputy-Surveyor. Gilles was fought
hard for by Torrens, but he, too, was opposed by all who knew
him, and Torrens and Hindmarsh were instructed to see him with a
view to his retirement The commissioners now having testified
their approval of me, it was agreed that they should write a
letter to Lord Glenelg asking him to confirm my appointment. I
was, moreover, voted a sum, adequate to my expenses, for
lecturing in Stamford and other places. I proceed on my journery

<p>After the appointment of the Board of Commissions to carry out
the provisions of the Act of Parliament, their first duty was to
fulfil the conditions required from them by the Government, viz.,
to sell £35,000 worth of land, and to invest £20,000 in the name
of trustees before any act of the Board would be valid. This
money question had hitherto been the crucial point, and it
remained so now. In June, 1835, therefore, the Commissioners
published their first "Regulations" for the sale of land at £1
per acre; and for two months, advertisements, pamphlets, and maps
were scattered broadcast; agents were appointed at considerable
expense to aid the Commissioners, but all to no purpose.</p>
<p>At the end of that time not half the required quantity of land
had been disposed of, and there seemed to be no chance of selling
any more.</p>
<p>At this crisis Mr. George Fife Angas said to his colleagues on
the Board of Commissioners: "Without some collateral association
to assist the Commissioners I do not see how the Act is to be
carried into effect." "He then proceeded to unfold a scheme which
was, in brief, that a Joint Stock Company should be formed with
sufficient capital to purchase the requisite quantity of land; to
take out its own agents, servants, and other emigrants, and
supply them with provisions while they carried on operations of a
reproductive and remunerative character; and to provide the
capital for the working of the Colonial Government." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* "The History of South Australia." By Edwin
Hodder. Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Co. 1893. Vol. I., p. 34.]</p>
<p>Mr. Angas was a remarkable man&mdash;no shrewder ever lived,
and few men served his day and generation with greater energy,
conscientiousness, and courage. ** He had proposed a scheme, and
he meant to see it through. He "was ready to act on the moment,
and, assisted by Mr. Henry Kingscote and Mr. Thomas Smith, at
once subscribed sufficient capital to purchase the whole of the
unsold land, to be handed over to the Company, when formed, at
cost price, with interest at 6 per cent. This purchase was the
basis of the operations of the Company, and, as a matter of fact,
of all future operations of the Commissioners, and thus the
initial difficulty in founding a colony under the Act was
overcome. But a concession had to be made by the Commissioners to
effect it. The offer for the purchase of the land was at the
reduced rate of 12s. per acre, partly because it was evident
there were no more purchasers to be obtained at £1 per acre, and
partly because this reduced price would be an incentive to
capitalists to invest in the proposed Company." ***</p>
<p class="foot">[** See, for a full account of the work of Mr.
Angas, in relation to South Australia, "George Fife Angas, Father
and Founder of South Australia." By Edwin Hodder. Hodder &amp;

<p class="foot">[*** "History." Vol. I., p. 35.]</p>
<p>On Mr. J. Wright, another of the Commissioners, devolved the
task of raising the sum of £20,000 to invest in trustees, and a
difficult task it was. But he succeeded; and although the terms
were not entirely approved by the Commissioners, they were glad
enough, in the emergency, to accept them, and on the 19th
November the required sum was invested as a guarantee to the
Government, in the names of three Trustees, in the 3 per cent.
Consols.</p>
<p>On the 22nd of January, 1836, the South Australian Company was
formed, with a subscribed capital of £200,000.</p>
<p>The original Directors of the Company were George Fife Angas
(Chairman), Raikes Currie, M.P., Charles Hindley, M.P., James
Hyde, Henry Kingscote, John Pirie (Alderman), John Rundle, M.P.,
Thomas Smith, James Ruddall Todd, and Henry Waymouth.</p>
<p>As, however, Messrs. Angas and Wright were Commissioners, they
were prohibited from having any pecuniary interest in the colony
they were appointed to establish, and both, therefore, retired
from that Board.</p>
<p>The objects of the Company were briefly&mdash;(1) To erect
upon their town land, wharves, warehouses, and dwelling-houses,
and to let, or otherwise dispose of them to the colonists. (2) To
cultivate and improve their country land, and to lease, or sell,
parts of it at their discretion.</p>
<p>(3) To lay out farms, erect suitable buildings thereon, and
let the same on lease, with the right of purchase before the
expiration of such lease, at a price to be fixed at the time of
the tenant taking possession. (4) To grow wool for the European
markets. (5) To establish whale, seal, and other fisheries in the
gulf and seas around the colony, and to cure and salt fish for
exportation. (6) To salt and cure beef and pork for ships and for
general export. (7) To establish a bank or banks; to make loans
on the security of land or produce, and to perform all necessary
and expedient banking operations. (8) To select, contract with,
and provide the requisite tools for carpenters, brickmakers,
lime-burners, blacksmiths, boat-builders, fishermen, and others,
so that every want of immigrants might be supplied on their
arrival in the colony.</p>
<p>Within a month or two of the foundation of the South
Australian Company, appointments to the various departments, both
at home and in colony, were made, and their fleet sent
forth;&mdash;the <i>John Pirie</i>, with 21 passengers, goods,
and the live stock; the <i>Duke of York</i>, with 42 passengers,
including Mr. S. Stephens, the Colonial Manager of the Company;
the <i>Lady Mary Pelham</i> and the <i>Emma</i>, with passengers
and whaling and general stores.</p>
<p>The colonial officials were, of course, sent out by the Board
of Commissioners&mdash;Captain Hindmarsh, the Governor, in the
<i>Buffalo</i>; Colonel Light, the Surveyor-General and his staff
of assistants in the <i>Rapid</i>; Mr. G. S. Kingston,
Deputy-Surveyor, and other officers in the <i>Cygnet</i>, and Mr.
Gouger, Colonial Secretary in the <i>Africaine</i>.</p>
<p>Happily, Mr. Gouger's diary, written during the voyage, has
been preserved!, and from that we shall now proceed to quote such
extracts as will throw light on his character and work.</p>

<h4>A VOYAGE TO SOUTH AUSTRALIA.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Extracts</span> from "Some Rough Notes of a
Voyage from Gravesend to South Australia in the <i>Africaine</i>,
Captain Duff, 316 Register, commencing June 30th, 1836," by
Robert Gouger.</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>June</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;At 4 o'clock my
wife * and I joined the <i>Africaine</i> at Gravesend, which
immediately afterwards moved down with the tide. Fortunately the
weather was delightful, the light winds that blew gave hardly any
perceptible motion to the ship, and were refreshing in the
extreme, and when the <i>Africaine</i> anchored on Deal, for the
reception of the Captain and some of the party, we were in good
health and spirits. In the course of the afternoon, Captain Duff
and his wife came on board. They had been married but on the
previous Thursday&mdash;a circumstance which caused a little
delay in the departure of the ship from London
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The vessel being in disorder in
consequence of this day commencing her voyage, prayers were not
read, I distributed, however, amongst the passengers and sailors
some books supplied by friends for the use of the ship during the
voyage&mdash;afterwards to be given to some public institution.
On conversing with some of the labouring emigrants, I find they
are desirous of establishing a school on board for the
instruction of some of the party who are not able to read. When
the first trials of the passage are over, this will be a subject
for attention.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Gouger was married to Miss Harriet
Jackson, a London lady, on the 22nd of October, 1835.]</p>
<p class="quote">"<i>Sunday</i>, July 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Prayers
were read by Mr. Everard, the surgeon. The whole of the
passengers and crew were present, and were most attentive and
orderly. My <i>protégé</i>, Pollard, officiated as clerk. My wife
remains very unwell indeed. She has been under the care of Mr.
Everard now nearly a week, and nothing can exceed his kind
attention; still she does not progress. Now for some gossip about
the ship. Our cabin party, besides Captain and Mrs. Duff,
consists of our noble selves; Mr., Mrs., and Miss Brown (the
emigration agent, his wife, and sister); Mr. and Mrs. Hallett, a
merchant and purchaser of land who settles in the colony, and is
partner with Duff (the Captain of the ship); Mr. Everard (the
surgeon of the ship) and his wife; Mr. Skipper, the son of a
wealthy solicitor of Norwich, and who is articled to Mr. Mann
(the Attorney-General of the Colony). The first-mate also dines
in the cuddy, thus we have the unfortunate number of thirteen! We
fare sumptuously every day.<br>
<br>
"The intermediate party (<i>i.e</i>., between the cabin and the
steerage) consists of eighteen persons, viz., Mr. Deacon, who
intends to keep an hotel in the colony; my clerk (Mr. Nantes);
Mr. Thomas (the printer of the colonial newspaper), with his
family; and four proprietors of land in South Australia. They
fare differently to the cabin passengers, having fresh meat once
a week only, and on other days salt fish, beef, or pork. The
labourers and their wives and families occupy the next
compartment of the ship.<br>
<br>
"Their number is about fifty; they are all contented, and have
every cause to be so. Pollard has volunteered to take care of the
poultry, pigs, and sheep on board, besides my goats. He takes
excessive pride in them, and boasts of their condition daily.
Moreover, he milks my goats, and performs upon the pigs and sheep
the kindly offices of the butcher when occasion requires.<br>
<br>
"... I shall confine my remarks to Captain Duff, whose conduct in
every respect merits the warmest encomiums. He appears to be a
thorough sailor, decisive and skilful; he pays equal attention to
all the passengers; has no favourites apparently, and is,
therefore, a general favourite.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>July</i> 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;The wind fell in the night, and
for four hours we were absolutely becalmed. This proved
exceedingly trying to my poor wife, for the ship being no longer
steadied by the wind, and there being so much sea, it was tossed
about in a very disagreeable manner. The waves, which broke
against her with considerable violence, gave the idea at night of
a storm.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mr. Everard's advice not having
alleviated H.'s sufferings, I requested the assistance of another
medical gentleman on board (Mr. Slater), who suggested a swinging
cot, which, being arranged with a few trifling alterations,
produced greater comfort.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>July</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Flocks of flying-fish have
surrounded the vessel to-day, and have afforded much
amusement.<br>
<br>
"<i>July</i> 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;H. is now quite well, and for the
last two days has enjoyed herself on the deck. Yesterday we
entered the torrid zone; the heat is, however, not at all
oppressive to any of the party. The thermometer in my cabin is
generally 78°, but the thorough draft, which we manage at almost
all times to keep up, renders the temperature agreeable. Some of
the passengers in the intermediate cabin, last week manifested
discontent. One complained of the bread, another of the beef,
another of the wine; indeed, each had some complaint to make,
but, rather a subject for marvel, no two agreed on the
<i>same</i> complaint.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"Seeing that the real cause of the discontent was idleness and
<i>ennui</i>, it occurred to me that it would be well to get up
some general amusement, and I consequently proposed to enrol a
body of volunteers to be drilled. Fortunately, I found on board a
man who had been a soldier in the Peninsular war (Mr. Wickham),
and, after a little persuasion, he agreed to spend half-an-hour a
day with us for the purpose.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>Sunday, July</i> 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Mr. Everard again read
prayers, and introduced a suitable prayer for the success of the
voyage and its object.<br>
<br>
"<i>July</i> 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;This morning the first-mate found
on the deck a flying-fish."</p>
<br>
<p>It may be mentioned here that, throughout this and subsequent
voyages, Mr. Gouger made elaborate notes concerning every new
form of life with which he came in contact. Thus he describes the
flying-fish scientifically, gives its length and breadth, the
manner and length of its flight, and accompanies the description
with an admirable drawing in which the various shades and hues of
the fish are given with great vividness and accuracy. The old
love of natural history, which had been his favourite study in
the days of his youth, but had been completely abandoned in the
years of stress and storm in Australian affairs, returned to him
in these hours of comparative idleness; every bird or fish
brought on board&mdash;and there were many&mdash;became the
object of his special care and amusement. But these and other
details, not falling within the scope of our present purpose,
have been omitted in our extracts.</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>July</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;H. remains in
excellent health and spirits. Yesterday a large turtle passed us,
and in the evening the ship was absolutely surrounded by large
fish&mdash;there being, according to Captain Duff's computation,
not fewer than one hundred porpoises and bottle-nosed whales
around the ship at the same time, some of which were 20 feet
long.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>August</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;I was always averse to allowing
labouring emigrants spirits, on board ship, and am now more than
ever convinced that the practice is most injudicious. Very few
indeed ever think of helping the sailors by pulling at a rope, or
of rendering any other assistance&mdash;on the contrary, they are
generally to be seen rolling on casks, or hen coops, enjoying (a
new thing for them) <i>idleness</i>, with unusually full meals;
then they become unhealthy, and the allowance of spirits makes
them vicious. The women, many of whom have perhaps very seldom
tasted rum before, and, if so, in small quantities, now drinking
largely, become quarrelsome, and the causes of quarrel amongst
the weak emigrants.<br>
<br>
"From these considerations, carried out practically as I have
seen in several instances, I am thoroughly convinced that no
ship, containing a large number of poor persons, can be other
than an arena for discord while spirits are served out as an
article of rations, or can be obtained, except in particular
cases, by the authority of the surgeon.<br>
<br>
"<i>August</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Several dolphins have been
sporting about the ship to-day, but we have not succeeded in
taking any. One of my Cashmere kids died. We have also, I fear,
lost the beautiful heliotrope which my mother so kindly left as a
last gift on board the ship to H. It has had water regularly, but
whether it is the sea air, or the absence of the sun (for it
could not be hung on deck), which has killed it I know not;
nevertheless, the stump, cut down as it is, shall be still a
cabin passenger, in the hope that the climate of Australia may
revivify any spark of life which may yet be at the root. The
mignonette before withering, providently gave its seed, and the
third little pot of treasure, the musk plant, still lives, but in
a very precarious state; our other pets, the dog and the bird,
are well and contented.<br>
<br>
"<i>August</i> 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;During the night a slight
change of wind occurred, affording us the prospect of relief from
our lengthened imprisonment; this is doubly agreeable, as the
Captain has more than once intimated his intention to go into the
Island of Ascension instead of the Cape, should this weather
continue. We were near it, and the detention there, while getting
water, would be much shorter than at the Cape. This is a great
temptation, especially now that we have had every hope of making
a <i>quick</i> passage; but it will be a source of great
disappointment to me, and to most of the passengers, as we have
prepared long lists of etceteras to be purchased at the Cape;
besides which we have looked upon two or three days' sojourn
there as a holiday, which could hardly be enjoyed on a volcanic
island, where nothing else can be had but water and turtle! Since
the first of this month we have made no more southing than 390
miles.<br>
<br>
"<i>August</i> 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;The wind, which held out a
favourable promise on the 18th, has not deceived us, and we are
therefore relieved from the apprehension of going to
Ascension.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yesterday an attempt was made by
Captain Duff to decrease, the allowance of water to every
passenger, with the obvious view of avoiding the necessity of
putting in at the Cape; this, however, was resisted by all, and
on Mr. Brown representing to the Captain, that, as 'Agent for
Emigration,' he would consider the decrease of allowance of water
as a breach of contract with the Commissioners, and would so
prevent the payment of the passage-money of the steerage
passengers, the Captain countermanded his order, and the usuful
amount of water was to-day served out. The quantity allowed is
six quarts a day for each adult, children have less in proportion
to age; and when it is remembered that this is to suffice for
washing, cooking, tea, and all other uses, it cannot be said to
be extravagant.<br>
<br>
"<i>August</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;By reference to the ship's log
it appears that we have made as much progress during the last
four days as we did during the whole antecedent part of August.
The demands upon our gallant Captain's patience not being now so
great as they were&mdash;when about £15 a day (estimated expenses
of the ship) were going out of his pocket, without any progress
in the voyage being made&mdash;the austerity he then assumed has
softened down, and he is nearly himself again. In fact, the
Captain's visage is a pretty good barometer; nothing seems to
annoy him but a calm or an adverse wind. The wrangling and
complaints of the passengers he manages to dispose of readily
enough.<br>
<br>
"<i>Sunday, September</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;The weather is still
fine and the wind favourable, but the change from heat to cold is
to me anything but agreeable. My time is divided between reading,
renewing my acquaintance with figures, and amusing myself with my
goats. We are both looking forward to our arrival at the Cape
with feelings of anticipation a little similar to those
experienced by schoolboys before the holidays. It is uncertain,
however, whether our holidays are to be spent at Simon's Bay or
Cape Town.<br>
<br>
"<i>September</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Since Sunday we have had
strong breezes; a landsman would perhaps call the wind a gale.
Flocks of the Cape pigeon are constantly about the ship, with
some birds of black plumage, and now and then an albatross is
seen sailing majestically through the air. The largest of those
we have seen would not measure, perhaps, more than 9 or 10 feet
from wing to wing; occasionally they are met with, 14 feet in
width. Several Cape pigeons have been caught by the passengers
with a line and hook, baited with pork, one of which having been
given me I have skinned and preserved.<br>
<br>
"<i>September</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;The thermometer is now at
57°, a degree of cold that affects H. and myself very much, and,
unfortunately, neither of us has made a provision for very cold
weather .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The cabin I occupy is the larboard
stem cabin; besides the two stem windows, there is a ventilator,
on the deck, about three feet in diameter, which, however, is
divided between mine and the adjacent cabin. Thus I have a
sufficiency of air and light for all purposes. But there is an
advantage in the possession of a stem cabin far beyond that of
ventilation, or even abundance of light, viz., the power of
abstracting one's self from the company of the rest of the
passengers. In our case the companion-ladder is between the stem
cabin and the cuddy, so that when the door is shut it is
impossible to hear the never-ceasing conversation in which some
of the party are sure to be engaged. To be alone is the greatest
luxury we enjoy on board; were I the occupant of a cabin adjacent
to the cuddy, I verily believe that, instead of passing my time
agreeably, I should be suffering from a brain fever caused by the
continual din and noise of my worthy fellow passengers. "Were the
society throughout agreeable and intellectual, the conversation
of even such persons would occasionally tire, but it is not to be
expected that a party meeting greatly by chance, would be all of
this kind, nor can all be expected to go through sea-sickness,
and other ship inconveniences, without petulance, or perhaps
discord. From all this the stem cabin may be a refuge; if the
'azure demons' are tormenting, there is no occasion to annoy
others; if others are similarly possessed, the stem cabin screens
from them. At any rate, we have found it a most delightful
retreat, in proof of which I may truly say that, on an average, I
have not been more than four hours a day out of it, while H. has
not been more than half that time. It is money well spent which
purchases the stem cabin.<br>
<br>
"<i>September</i> 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;This morning, about 10
o'clock, the <i>Africaine</i> anchored in Simon's Bay. The fine
day, and the joyousness of all on deck at the prospect of a
holiday on shore, seemed to give us new life and vigour, and
about 11.30 we got into a boat to convey us to land.<br>
<br>
"Simon's Town is situated at the foot of some high rocky hills,
which, overshadowing the town, give it a romantic and very
pleasing appearance. The houses (of which I imagine there are
about 160) are well built, after the English style, but with flat
roofs, and, with a few exceptions, are in the occupation of store
and innkeepers, both parties depending for support upon the
custom of ships calling at the Bay. Having taken a hasty glance
at the goods offered at the stores, and made some purchases, I
procured (at the rate of fifteen shillings per day) a horse and
gig to drive to Cape Town, to which place we were accompanied by
two of our fellow passengers (Mr. Williams and Mr. Slater), who
kindly offered to guide their movements by our own, that, in case
of distress in 'our travels in Africa,' they might be ready to
give assistance. The first six miles lie over a sandy beach,
where the winding of the shore, and the occasioned tracks of
wheels, are the only indications of the road, and which is at all
times, to a certain degree, dangerous, but especially so at high
tide. Once, indeed, we were close upon some quick-sands, which
would have been found very troublesome, to say the least, had not
a horseman seen our danger, and galloped up to inform us of it.
These sands past, the road opened into a rich alluvial soil, on
which were seen small spots of cultivated ground, and
occasionally about a dozen cottages in sufficient contiguity to
be collectively deemed worthy of the title of a village. The road
from the sands to Cape Town is in excellent order, and may well
vie with the best in Britain. During our little journey many
novelties attracted our attention, and diverted us from the
perils of the way. The skeletons of whales abounded on the shore,
and numerous wild flowers&mdash;prized highly in England&mdash;we
remarked upon the rocks. The wild flowers increased in number and
beauty as we proceeded inland, among which the most frequent were
the geranium and arum lily, the arbutus, azalia, gum cistus. Many
kinds of cactus in great luxuriance, the pomegranate, and
sugar-tree, with heath in vast profusion; some varieties of which
are the pride and care of English hot-houses. Besides these we
saw many splendid shrubs and flowers, the names of which our
botanical knowledge could not supply. The birds, again, were
particularly beautiful and varied in plumage, but they also were
strangers to me. We entered Cape Town just as the sun was sinking
behind the hills, and soon found ourselves at the George Hotel,
the only hotel in the town properly so called&mdash;all other
houses for the resort of travellers being boarding-houses.<br>
<br>
"The luxury of large rooms, abundance of fresh water, and the
absence of 'sea lurches,' were now sources of delight to us,
after having been pent up in a ship during twelve weeks, and when
to these were added a daintily served up cup of tea, with hot
toast and other sundries, we felt determined to throw our
complaints away, and fully to enjoy our trip. A short walk in the
town concluded our day's wanderings.<br>
<br>
"<i>September</i> 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Almost the whole of this day
was spent in making purchases; Captain Duff having informed us
that he should positively sail from Simon's Bay the next day
(Friday), at 12 o'clock precisely. The very limited time thus
allowed us for procuring our supplies, prevented our seeing much
of the town, excepting that which is occupied by shops and
stores. The last are well supplied with goods, and one shop (an
ironmonger's) might have challenged a comparison with any in the
best English county towns. The prices of all things imported from
Great Britain are, however, extravagantly high. Of the few things
we required, many were at least double the English
prices&mdash;some much more. The little we saw of the town
impressed us with a favourable idea of the place: it is clean,
the streets wide, the houses well built with flat roofs, and
regularly formed. It was not until after some minute
investigation that we were able to discover the probable
habitations of the labouring people; so well arranged, and (to
outward appearance) well appointed were the majority of the
houses... The church is a new and neat edifice, placed in very
good taste on a piece of rising ground at the top of a long and
wide street, looking towards the Bay, and between the two hills
known by the name of Table Mountain and the Lion's Rump. In the
evening I accompanied Mr. Thompson, a resident, to the museum
which, under the care of three brothers, has become exceedingly
interesting. The animals and birds are beautifully preserved, and
the number is very considerable. Mr. Slater, M.R.C.S., proposes
to found a museum in South Australia."</p>
<br>
<p>Mr. Gouger proceeds in the Journal with a vivid description of
people he met, who showed him hearty colonial hospitality,
conducted him over their farms, and told him of their failures
and successes. One old farmer begged him to stay an indefinite
period, and finding this impossible, "he put into a basket a
couple of favourite black pigeons, and a fine black hen, whereby
to remember him." After several adventures on the return journey,
owing to the high tide and the dangerous state of the sands, the
party returned in good time to the ship, and the Journal
continues:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"We proceeded on our journey with light but
favourable winds.<br>
<br>
"<i>September</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Spoke with a schooner on her
way to Swan River. Her cargo contained, among other things,
spirits of various kinds, equal in quantity to 100 puncheons,
which the Captain regarded as his most profitable investment. One
hundred puncheons to 1,600 persons, one puncheon to 16
persons&mdash;men, women and children! The cost of this
importation would suffice to pay the passage of 100 labourers to
the colony, or thereabouts&mdash;a mode of expenditure infinitely
more profitable to the colony, seeing that the main cause of
difficulty there is the want of labourers.<br>
<br>
"<i>October</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;This morning we passed the
singular little island of St. Paul's.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is
surprising that some misanthrope has not chosen it as his abode.
Tristan d'Acunha has its Corporal Glass, Pitcairn Island its
Adams, but St. Paul's is yet open to a hermit.<br>
<br>
"<i>October</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;This morning brought us within
sight of land, causing considerable excitement on board.<br>
<br>
"<i>November</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Towards evening the west end
of Kangaroo Island appeared in sight.<br>
<br>
"<i>November</i> 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;To-day the wind blew from the
N.E., which enabled us to make some advance. As in course of
tacking we frequently went within two or three miles of Kangaroo
Island, and as the weather seemed peculiarly inviting, some of
the young men of our party expressed a desire to land and walk
across the island by Captain Sutherland's track. [The men
resident in the island assert that Sutherland never was across
the island at all.] Their wish being communicated to Captain
Duff, he at once gave his consent, and a boat was lowered to
convey them to the shore.<br>
<br>
"<i>November</i> 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;About 4 this morning I rose
and went on deck to watch the appearance of the shore of Kangaroo
Island and Yorke's Peninsula at the
south.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
As I watched the changing shore, and reflected on the years of
anxiety and labour which I had devoted to this enterprise, the
alternations of hope and chagrin which I had suffered as the
prospect of its accomplishment appeared near or distant, the
degree of success which had at length been attained, and withal
the Providential protection which, 'He who holds the waters in
the hollow of His hand' had been pleased to extend to us; my
varied emotions almost overcame me, and I was by no means sorry
to retreat to a part of the ship where, undisturbed, I could
watch the progress of the vessel.<br>
<br>
"About 11 o'clock Nepean Bay opened to us, and all eyes were
directed to the shore in the expectation of seeing our
fellow-colonists. At length we observed three vessels at anchor
in the Bay, upon which signals were hoisted and the guns fired.
These were answered from the ships and the shore, and presently a
boat put off which, in due time, brought to us Mr. Samuel
Stephens, the Company's Colonial Manager.<br>
<br>
".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Before deciding where to take up our
temporary residence until the arrival of the Governor, Brown and
I thought it expedient to see Col. Light, who was then surveying
at Cape Jervis. We accordingly sent for Captain Lipson, the
Harbour Master, who, we understood, was in the Colonel's
confidence, and in the evening he rowed from the Cygnet to us.
From him we learned that a most enchanting country had been
discovered at Cape Jervis, with which Col. Light was so much
pleased as to be almost fixed in its favour, but that its
superior advantages to Kangaroo Island were not the only cause of
the removal of the depôt from the
island.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>
<br>
<p>Then follows, in the Journal, an excellent description of
Kangaroo Island and its resources, its flora and fauna, and a
digest of the arguments for and against its being a desirable
place for a settlement. The Journal continues:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>November</i> 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;The opinion
which the sealers (Stephens and Lipson) give of the pedestrian
party succeeding in reaching the settlement are very
discouraging&mdash;nay, fearful! All agree in saying it is
impossible but that they should be lost in the woods, and, unless
very fortunate in finding water, would be starved to death. With
a degree of folly hardly to be imagined, they refused to take
from the boats fresh water which had been provided for them, thus
they would, in a few hours, be suffering from thirst to be
quenched only in such pools as might be left from the winter
rains. On hearing this statement we thought it advisable to send
after them, and an agreement was .made with three sealers and a
native woman to go in search of them, and they immediately
started on their expedition. Reliance is chiefly placed on the
sagacity of the native woman, who is distinguished for her skill
in tracking.<br>
<br>
"<i>November</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;This morning the
<i>Africaine</i> left Nepean Bay, and in a few hours reached Cape
Jervis, and anchored in a bay where we discerned the Rapid, and,
on an adjacent hill, some tents. A boat, which put off on our
approach, brought us Colonel Light, who piloted the ship into
Rapid Bay. A party of us accompanied Colonel Light on shore,
being desirous of seeing as much as we could of the land now, in
case we should have to move onward with the ship. Now we found
that the accounts we had heard of the beauty of the mainland,
glowing as they were, were not exaggerated, for it is impossible
to imagine a more lovely valley than that which skirts the
Bay.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Delighted as we were with the spot, we
determined, on the recommendation of Colonel Light, to proceed
higher up the gulf, where he discovered there was, at all times,
fresh water, and a fine harbour for shipping, of which advantage
Kapid Bay is destitute.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>November</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;We have now been some days at
Holdfast Bay, so named by Colonel Light, in consequence of the
excellent holding ground afforded here for shipping; and all
hands are employed in erecting tents, building huts, and landing
goods and cargo; but an account of my residence here does not
fall naturally into this paper, for this is a narrative of my
voyage to South Australia, and not of my residence in it. The
landing, and first impression of South Australia as a place of
abode, is an epoch worthy of another chapter."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>
<h4>IN HOLDFAST BAY.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Extracts</span> from "Memoranda of a Residence
in Holdfast Bay. By Robert Gouger."</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>November</i> 25<i>th</i>, 1836.&mdash;Though
the <i>Africaine</i> anchored here on the 9th ultimo, for the
purpose of discharging cargo, I have been obliged to neglect my
Journal in consequence of the many calls upon my time, therefore
the accounts which follow may not be given in chronological
order. On landing with Colonel Light on the 10th, we were
informed by Mr. Field, the first officer of the Rapid, 'that a
river had been recently discovered running apparently into the
creek, known by the name of Sixteen-mile Creek '&mdash;that he
had seen it, and said it was of important magnitude. This being
the case, it became a question whether or not the
<i>Africaine</i> should at once commence the discharge of her
passengers and cargo, or wait the report of the Colonel. With a
view to the settlement of this question. Colonel Light,
accompanied by Captain Duff, Mr. Brown, and myself, started the
next day upon a walking expedition to the river. At a distance of
about five miles we came within sight of it; it ran through a
low, swampy country, covered with most luxuriant grass, and
skirting a range of beautiful, well- wooded hills, from the
centre of which rose Mount Lofty. We did not prolong our
excursion, as the Colonel felt satisfied that the river would be
found to run to the creek, but, as from the nature of the
country, he thought the investigation might last some days, he
felt a desire to strengthen the party at Holdfast Bay, and
disembark there at once. He was also anxious to land without loss
of time, as the whole surveying party (officers and men) had been
unprovided with fresh meat since their arrival, and he thought it
necessary to give them a change of food, and considered that the
most advantageous course would be to despatch the
<i>Africaine</i> to Van Diemen's Land for the purpose of bringing
sheep and oxen to the colony.<br>
<br>
The next day, therefore, saw the ship's boat busily employed in
landing passengers and cargo. The question now was, where to
pitch our tent and build our hut. Mr. Kingston (the Deputy
Surveyor-General), with his men, were located about a mile from
the beach, but I at once determined to go further in search of a
place for my temporary abode. I at length determined on a spot
shaded by large gum-trees, in the middle of a meadow covered with
pasture of a richness hardly to be surpassed, and more within the
precincts of the surveyor's tents. The next day, therefore, saw
the tent struck, and erected on the newly-chosen
site.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The first thing to be done was to
transport my packages from the beach to the tent, a distance of
little more than a mile (but not of British turn-pike road, nor
with the aid of waggons and horses). My only assistants were
Pollard, my boy Alfred, and a portable truck, which I had brought
from England. The road was first a deep sand, then an uneven
field covered with high grass, and intersected by two gullies,
which, in the wet season, doubtless bring down water to the
rivulet running into Holdfast Bay, but they were now fortunately
dry. Three journeys from the beach to the tent with laden truck
was a good day's work. The heat was sometimes very oppressive,
and the mosquitoes troublesome; but the flies are afflicting.
Nothing can equal their cruel perseverance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
While these toils were going on, Harriet had the refuge of the
ship, to which also I returned every evening, not, however,
without having to wade breast-high in the sea to reach the boat,
which, except at particular times of the tide, could not get over
a sand-bank about twenty yards from the beach. At length the time
arrived when H.'s affectionate impatience to aid me would not be
restrained, and on Saturday,<br>
<br>
"<i>November</i> 19<i>th</i> we left the <i>Africaine</i>, and
took up our residence in the tent. Troops of mosquitoes
entertained us with their music, and we, in return, entertained
them with a full repast, and in the morning we were well-nigh in
a fever from their visitation. It is not, however, from these
insects alone that annoyance has been felt, as scarcely a day
passes without something turning up to excite surprise, if not
apprehension. Within two yards of our tent, five centipedes of
about five inches long have been caught&mdash;one actually in the
tent, and one night I put my hand within an inch of a large
scorpion. Enormous ants and very small frogs abound also in our
tent, but the first of these are harmless, and the others cause
us no disturbance. We have had frequent gales of wind, and the
changes from heat to cold have been somewhat extraordinary; in
one instance, within twelve hours the thermometer ranged between
105° and 50°, both in the shade. It would, however, be premature
to pronounce an opinion as to the climate, and I endeavour to
console myself, and others, with the assurance that, when the
clearing of land and cultivation shall have commenced, many of
the annoyances will no longer exist. Some of the emigrants
brought with them tents, and those generally are insufficient
habitations for day or night, in consequence of their being
single. My own tent, being double, is, in comparison with any in
the colony, a very comfortable residence&mdash;the outside being
of draped cloth, not one drop of rain has entered. It also has a
verandah which serves as a store-room, thereby keeping the
interior in excellent order and neatness, and a boarded floor,
which I have laid down, is a luxury of much importance It is,
however, the only one yet in the colony, though nearly fifty
habitations of various kinds have been erected. Those who did not
provide tents have built huts, for which every facility
exists&mdash;there being a little forest of straight poles about
a mile off, and plenty of long sedge-grass wherewith to thatch
them. Game is in great abundance on the plain; it is almost
impossible to walk two hundred yards without putting up quails;
wild ducks and other water-fowl are to be met with constantly on
the river and in the lagoons. White cockatoos, parrots, and
parrakeets of splendid plumage are to be found on almost every
other tree. These, and a peculiar kind of plover, are excellent
eating:. Kangaroos are plentiful&mdash;one fine fellow (nearly as
large as a jackass), with his mate, bounded by within twenty
yards of my tent yesterday while I was carpentering, but had
passed out of reach before I could get my rifle, though loaded in
the tent. Fish are also numerous, though few have been taken.<br>
<br>
"<i>November</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;The <i>Africaine</i>,
<i>Rapid</i>, and <i>Cygnet</i> left us this morning. The first
to Van Diemen's Land for supplies, the Rapid up the gulf, and the
Cygnet to Port Lincoln to await the arrival of the Governor.<br>
<br>
"<i>November</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;I have now seen what I have
so often heard and read of&mdash;a country on fire! Perhaps some
imaginations could realise it from the American novels; mine
never could.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"I had a trench dug about twenty yards round me, which would, I
hoped, effectively stop its march. This precaution has kept me
and my enclosure safe, while all beyond is black and desert. One
decided advantage has been gained by this conflagration, viz.,
the destruction of myriads of insects, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;We have long been anxiously
expecting a visit from the natives, and have been somewhat uneasy
at their lengthened absence, more particularly as two natives
have been sent by land from Rapid Bay to inform the other tribes
of our peaceful intentions."</p>
<br>
<p>Throughout his lengthened labours on behalf of South
Australia, Mr. Gouger had taken the keenest possible interest in
every question that related to the Aborigines. He was anxious
that full justice should be done to them, that their pre-emptive
rights should be respected, and that every effort should be made
to win them over to civilisation and Christianity. His
introduction to them, and the kindly way in which he treated
them, speak well for his humanity, and he concludes a rather long
notice of them by saying: "If these natives be a fair specimen,
there is nothing to fear from a residence among them, but having
heard much of their ferocity, I must be cautious in giving an
opinion as care may be required in dealing with them."</p>
<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>December</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Prayers were
read to-day in Mr. Kingston's tent by Mr. Gilbert, and a sermon
was to have been read also, but information arrived that a large
ship was sailing into the bay, and the anxiety was so great that
the larger part of the congregation separated and went to the
beach, expecting it might be the Governor. It proved, however, to
be the Emma from Kangaroo Island, bringing the Company's
livestock, etc.<br>
<br>
"I returned to my dinner and we had hardly finished when two
gentlemen made their appearance. They proved to be the Captain of
the <i>Emma</i> and Captain Nelson of the <i>John Pirie</i>, who
brought us letters from England. Our first enquiry was of the
fate of the six poor fellows who, it will be remembered, landed
on the western shore of Kangaroo Island, intending to walk across
it by 'Captain Sutherland's track.' Of these only four have been
found, Mr. Nantes, a clerk in the office of the Colonial
Secretary, and three labourers. Mr. Slater (a surgeon) and Mr.
Osborne (printer) are, it is feared, lost. Mr. Nantes states
that, after being out nine days, Osborne was unable to proceed,
and that Slater, with his characteristic generosity, said he
would stay with him, while the rest of the party pushed on, in
the hope of sending relief to the two left behind. Two days after
this, Nantes and his party were found by a fishing boat, and were
conveyed to the settlement, not having tasted food for four days,
but are now recovering and are in tolerably good health. Parties
sent in search of Slater and Osborne say that they have the
tracks of but one person, and as he appears to walk in circles,
or backwards and forwards, they fear he is out of his mind. This
doubtless was Slater; Osborne most probably has perished. Search
parties were, however, still out when the <i>Emma</i> left,
though no hope remains of finding either alive. Thus to Captain
Sutherland's very erroneous account of the interior of the
island, it is to be feared two gallant and educated young men
have fallen victims.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;The last fortnight has been
devoted to the building of my hut, which nearly adjoins the tent,
and is 12 feet wide by 21 feet long. Only six nails were used in
its construction; the uprights, cross-pieces, beams and joists
being all tied together with cordage. The wood was cut in a copse
about a mile distant, and the thatch, which consists of a kind of
reed, 10 feet long with long wide leaves, was drawn by the
portable truck before alluded to; I look forward to the hut, when
finished, as being cooler and far more agreeable&mdash;during the
heat of the day&mdash;than the tent. I have also built a shed for
my goats to sleep in, in the upper part of which the fowls have
taken up their abode. The latter reward my care by laying eggs
plentifully. The Cashmere goats thrive admirably, but my two lads
from the Cape have died. We originally supplied ourselves with
five servants (male and female) before leaving England, but of
these Alfred Young is the only one who preserves his loyalty,
though assailed by evil advisers. I have, however, been fortunate
in securing the services of Colsman and his wife till the site of
the chief town shall be fixed upon.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;The <i>Tam-o'-Shanter</i> has
to-day worked into the Bay, and will discharge her cargo at the
harbour, 8 miles from us. We now find that no doubt remains as to
the fate of Slater and Osborne, the islanders having given up
their search as hopeless. Their loss is much regretted by all who
witnessed their quiet, unassuming demeanour on board. We have
been fortunate in securing other servants from this ship.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Col. Light arrived here
to-day by the <i>Rapid</i> from Kangaroo Island. It is impossible
for him to speak in more depreciating terms than he does of the
lands adjacent to Port Lincoln and of the entrance to the
harbour.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This being the case, he considers
the position for the site of the chief town as determined, and
has therefore returned to Gulf St. Vincent with the full
intention of making an accurate survey of the harbour and river
eight miles north of Holdfast Bay. The <i>Tam-o'-Shanter</i> left
behind her a considerable quantity of excellent porter. This,
with other goods, supplied the first store in the colony, opened
by Mr. Thomas.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Last Sunday was Christmas
Day! What a temptation to regale on plum-pudding! Nevertheless we
did so! In the morning we attended prayers, read by Mr. Kingston,
with a sermon on 'The birth of Christ,' hut the congregation did
not exceed 30 persons. Yesterday was oppressively hot: in the hut
the thermometer stood at 86°; in the tent, under the inner
covering, 104°; and under the outer covering, 116°. The fowls and
goats appeared exhausted by the heat, the open mouths and
outstretched wings of the former, and the frequent and laborious
panting of the latter, showed their painful sensations.</p>

<br>
<p class="quote">"<i>December</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;This
morning, on going as usual to let out my goats, I saw two large
vessels entering the Bay, which proved to be the <i>Buffalo</i>
(bringing the Governor and other officers) and the <i>Cygnet</i>
from Port Lincoln. Before 8 o'clock a messenger arrived at my
tent requiring my attendance on board. I found His Excellency and
all the party in good health and spirits and full of hope and
ardour to commence their colonial career. After some consultation
it was decided that the Governor and emigrants should land here
at once, and that, in the course of the day, the necessary oaths
should be taken and the Governor's commission read. At 3 o'clock
the marines from the <i>Buffalo</i> were drawn up in a line, and
the whole of the colonists assembled in front of my tent. Before,
however, reading the commission in public, I took the necessary
oaths of office and, as senior member of Council present, I
administered to the Governor the oaths of office. We then held a
Council in my tent for the purpose of agreeing upon a
proclamation requiring all to obey the laws and declaring the
Aborigines to have equal rights and an equal claim with the white
man upon the protection of the Government. The Commission was
then read in public, a <i>feu de joie</i> was fired by the
Marines, the white ensign hoisted, and a salute fired by the
ships. The proclamation having been read, the meeting adjourned
to Mr. Kingston's tent, where a cold dinner was provided for such
as chose to partake of it, and the festivities were kept up to a
late hour. Rapidly as my heart beat on this occasion&mdash;an
occasion to which, during the years I had devoted to the
prosecution of the enterprise, I dared sometimes to anticipate
and rejoice in&mdash;I was not suffered long to bestow even one
thought upon it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;The Commission had hardly
left my tent yesterday when the doctor was called in attendance
upon my wife, who this morning at 6 o'clock gave the new province
a son! I say 'gave the province a son,' for he is claimed by the
Governor as his godson, as being the first child born in the
colony, after the establishment of the Government.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Wife and child both going on
well.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A meeting of the Legislature was held
in my tent, at which two Acts were passed&mdash;one establishing
Courts of General and Petty Sessions, and another fixing the
Qualification of Jurors; some Magistrates were also appointed at
the meeting.<br>
<br>
"<i>December</i> 31<i>st</i>.&mdash;My wife taken seriously ill
with symptoms of fever.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1837.&mdash;H. somewhat better. Mr.
Howard performed Divine service in the Government Hut, and
preached an excellent and impressive sermon from these words:
'Lord, let it alone this year also.'<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;A Council was again held in my
tent, when an Act was passed for the Summary Determination of
Disputes between Masters and Servants.<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;H. has been getting on very
slowly, but to-day she thinks herself strong enough to remove
from the hut to the tent, where she will have less noise, as when
known that the tent is occupied by her, persons on business will
go to the Government Hut during proper hours. Previous, however,
to H.'s taking possession, I was called upon therein, as
Magistrate, to decide the first case which had arisen in the
colony, but which was dismissed with costs.<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;The last week has been one of
intense pain. On Sunday Mr. Everard declared H.'s state to be
most serious. This induced me to arrange a meeting between Mr.
Everard and Dr. Jackson, of the <i>Buffalo</i>, as the former had
expressed an opinion that my wife was labouring under pulmonary
consumption, which opinion Dr. Jackson
confirmed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On Saturday last I decided two
cases of quarrel between master and servant, according to the Act
passed by the Legislative Council, on the 2nd ultimo, without
which enactment the long process of a civil action would have
been required to procure redress. This promises to be a most
useful law, and is highly popular in the colony.<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;This week has brought two
arrivals to the colony, the <i>Coromandel</i>, from London, with
emigrants, and the <i>Africaine</i> from Van Diemen's Land, with
stock. Received letters from home, and though often separated
from my family before, I never felt, on receiving communications
from my relatives, such strong emotion as I now do... I received
to-day official information from Col. Light and from the
harbour-master, that the bar at the entrance of the harbour would
allow the passage of the <i>Buffalo</i> and all ships of that
burden, which is a most fortunate thing for the colony. To-day
our infant has been privately baptised by Mr. Howard. The name
given to him is 'Henry Hindmarsh,' the first after one of my
brothers, and the second was given, not only out of respect to
the Chief Magistrate of the province, but as a matter of
permanent interest in the history of his birth.<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;H. has to-day been in a
dreadful state from increased fever, causing intense anxiety
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Yesterday H. passed a more
comfortable day, and was able to take a little nourishment; has
had a good night, and to-day is still mending. The great
difficulty is the want of more air and quiet
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The <i>William Hutt</i> arrived here
to-day from Kangaroo Island, bringing the remainder of my goods
left by the <i>Africaine</i>.'<br>
<br>
"In consequence of our not having stone or cement floors, the
white ants have made sad devestation, not only with our clothes,
but various articles, occasioning great
loss.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>February</i> 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Every day adds to the weakness
of my dear wife, and not even hope will soon exist as my solace;
but this Journal is not a place for a detail of her sufferings;
this mournful history must be reserved for exclusive
communications; as it, however, mainly influences all my
movements, it maybe necessary sometimes to advert to it.<br>
<br>
"Much dissatisfaction has arisen in the minds of many of the
colonists upon the important subject of the site of the capital,
and among the dissentients to Col. Light's plan, is the Governor
himself. The Governor feels very strongly upon the point, and now
says that unless 500 acres are surveyed for building land at the
harbour, he will not proclaim the port nor establish the
Government at Adelaide.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>February</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Dr. Wright having recommended
me, for the sake of change of air, to build a cottage on high
ground at Adelaide, I walked over there this morning, with a view
to fixing upon a spot on which to locate temporarily. This was my
first visit to the disputed ground, not having walked many yards
from my tent during my wife's illness.<br>
<br>
"After having taken a rapid view of the place, which presents
beauties and facilities for improvement quite beyond my
expectations, and decided upon a plot of ground for the erection
of my cottage, I called upon Col. Light and found him exceedingly
anxious to do all he could for the public weal, and equally
anxious to provide for the accommodation of all parties.<br>
<br>
"<i>February</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;I saw the Governor to-day, and
after some consideration it was decided to call a public meeting
for Friday, 10th.<br>
<br>
"<i>February</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;The public meeting was held
at the time appointed, and, after much discussion, it was
determined by Col. Light, to survey at the harbour 437 acres for
a town, retaining the site of Adelaide for the residence of the
Government.<br>
<br>
"This wise arrangement appears to please all. For my own part I
shall select all the land over which I have any control, at
Adelaide, under the firm assurance that, eventually, the harbour
will be the Blackwall to our London."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>
<h4>A REIGN OF SQUABBLE.</h4>
<p><span class="a">When</span> Mr. Gouger hastily concluded his
notes on "a Residence in Holdfast Bay, "he was in a state of
great mental anxiety. Troubles fell thick and fast upon him. His
wife was in a precarious condition; his destination was
uncertain; his duties were onerous in the extreme, and over all
the future there hung the shadow of a great fear.</p>
<p>"Not even hope will soon exist as my solace," he had written
in his diary on the 3rd of February; by the time he concluded
that brief diary all hope had gone, and on the 14th of March his
beloved wife passed away. Two days later, his infant son, Henry
Hindmarsh, died, and on the 25th of March, mother and child were
buried together in one grave at Adelaide.</p>
<p>While his heart was being torn assunder by these distressing
circumstances, he was in a most anxious state on account of the
unsettled and disturbed state of the colony. His tenderness as
husband and father, "would not permit him to walk many yards from
his tent during his wife's illness"; his high sense of honour
would not allow him to neglect one single duty required of him in
his official capacity. It happened, therefore, that night and day
he was at work; now at the bedside of his wife, now in the
Councils of the Government, and all the time with a brain on fire
and a heart that was well-nigh to breaking.</p>
<p>The trouble with regard to the colony may be briefly told
here. Immediately after the proclamation of the colony in Mr.
Gouger's tent, there was great bustle and excitement among the
settlers; the Governor had won the interest of the people; much
complimentary speech-making had taken place, and there was a
spirit of hopefulness inspiring the settlers. But, below the
surface, things were not so hopeful. It was soon discovered that
on board the <i>Buffalo</i>, in the course of their voyage, a
quarrel had occurred between the Governor, Captain Hindmarsh, and
the Resident Commissioner, Mr. J. Hurtle Fisher, as to the
exercise of the respective powers entrusted to each by the Board
of Commissioners.</p>
<p>Soon after their arrival in the colony, it was manifest that
there was a settled misunderstanding between the two&mdash;a
grievous thing, so far as the interests of the colony were
concerned.</p>
<p>Two days after the Governor landed, he came into contact with
Col. Light, the Surveyor-General&mdash;one of the cleverest and
at the same time most peace-loving officers a colony ever
had&mdash;as to the proposed site for the capital; the Governor
stepped entirely outside his well-defined functions, to clamour
for the site being fixed in the neighbourhood of Encounter Bay,
which the Colonel very properly&mdash;as events soon
proved&mdash;considered altogether unsuitable. Beaten in his
attempt to coerce Col. Light, Hindmarsh's next interference was
with regard to the proposed laying out of streets, squares, and
open spaces&mdash;another matter with which he had practically
nothing whatever to do&mdash;while still harping on the question
of the site of the capital. Col. Light naturally resented these
aggravating interferences, as they were serious reflections on
his judgment and ability, and he laid before the Governor the
clear and explicit instructions he had received from the
Commissioners, which were that the choice of the site of the
capital was to be left solely to the Colonel, "whose own judgment
on this point was to be paramount and conclusive." Matters came
to a crisis between them when Mr. Gouger, as Colonial Secretary,
called a meeting, <i>at the Governor's command</i>, to discuss
the question; the result was that 218 voted for the Colonel's
choice, and 137 for that of the Governor and his "party" = 81 in
favour of Col. Light.</p>
<p>Thereupon, not knowing how to take a hint, the Governor was
foolish enough to appeal to the Commissioners, and to make a
formal complaint against Col. Light, who had only exercised the
powers made binding upon him. For this the Governor received a
sharp rap on the knuckles from the Commissioners, who
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>That "When he [Hindmarsh] applied for the office of Governor,
he was distinctly informed that the right of selecting the
capital would be vested solely in the Surveyor-General," and that
when he pressed the Board to cede this right to him, "he was
seeking for an extension of power inconsistent with the
principle, of the colony; and that a Governor of South Australia
must be content to receive and to hold his appointment subject to
the condition of non-interference with the officer appointed to
execute the surveys and to dispose of the public land."</p>
<p>Still unable to take a hint, the Governor came to an open
rupture with the Resident Commissioner&mdash;with whom, as we
have said, he had quarrelled on board ship&mdash;not only as to
the naming of places, opening the port, and such like functions,
but by a series of bickerings as unbearable on the one side as
they were undignified on the other.</p>
<p>This bad example was very contagious. Rival newspapers were
started, one to represent the views of the Governor's party, the
other to advocate the claims of those who took the side of the
Resident Commissioner. There was a chronic state of dissension,
and it is no wonder that there was disorder.</p>
<p>It was an exceptionally trying time for Mr. Gouger, whose
duties as Colonial Secretary brought him in constant contact with
the Governor, and placed him at the head and front of these
offendings. With two parties ruling, it was a matter of hourly
consideration how to steer a middle course. Traps were laid to
catch the feet of the unwary whichever way they went.</p>
<p>And so it happened that many were caught. One official was
charged with inciting the people to sedition; another with
setting the judge at defiance; the Emigration Agent was charged
with disobedience to the Governor's commands, and was suspended;
and the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Robert Gouger, was charged with
having assaulted the Colonial Treasure, and <span class="a">was
suspended</span>!</p>
<p>The act of Captain Hindmarsh in suspending Mr. Gouger from his
office was cruel to the last degree, and, according to the
testimony of others, which we shall quote, as unjust as it was
cruel. To a man of his sensitive nature&mdash;" the very soul of
honour "&mdash;and coming at a time when he was oppressed with
manifold troubles, personal and official, it was a death-blow
from which he never recovered.</p>
<p>A few quotations from the statements of others as to the
conduct of Captain Hindmarsh will be preferable to any expression
of our own opinion.</p>
<p>The colonists soon became tired of his maladministration, and
from all quarters the Commissioners received complaints, and
appeals for their intervention. The grounds of complaint were
mainly&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.) That he had, a second time, retarded the progress of the
surveys by interfering with the Surveyor-General.</p>
<p>(2.) That he had assumed some of the powers delegated to the
Resident Commissioner.</p>
<p>(3.) That he had incurred expenses without authority.</p>
<p>(4.) That he had suspended and discharged a number of public
officers without sufficient cause.</p>
<p>So widespread was the feeling, and so urgent the terms in
which it was expressed, that the Commissioners at once placed the
matter before Lord Glenelg, the Secretary of State for the
Colonies, concluding their letter thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"However much they might respect the rank of Captain Hindmarsh
as a distinguished officer of the British Navy, they were
compelled, by a paramount sense of duty, respectfully to
recommend, on the several grounds they had endeavoured to explain
to his Lordship, that he might be <i>immediately recalled</i>
from the Government of South Australia."</p>
<p>Although anticipating events in their chronological order, it
may be said here that Lord Glenelg wrote in reply (February 21st,
1838):&mdash;</p>
<p>"Governor Hindmarsh appears, from his own showing, to be
incapable of carrying on the Government. With the exception of
the Judge and Harbour Master, he is more or less, at variance
with all the official functionaries of the colony, whether
belonging to the Government or to the Commission."</p>
<p>Hindmarsh was peremptorily recalled, and on July the 14th he
left the colony, after fourteen months' reign of squabble,
greatly to the relief of the bulk of the colonists.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it had fared ill with Robert Gouger. Crushed and
broken as he was, he at once determined to leave the colony and
place his case in the hands of the Commissioners, or, if need be,
appeal to the Government for the redress of his grievances, not
knowing at that time that from various quarters formal appeals
for the removal of the Governor had been despatched. If sympathy
could have sustained him, he would soon have been strong and
active again, for it was lavished upon him on all hands; but
there was too deep a wound in his heart for early healing, and he
smarted under the pain, "sharper than a serpent's tooth," of base
ingratitude. Still, everything that his friends could do for him
they did, willingly and promptly; and the following is a copy of
a letter addressed by some of them to Colonel Torrens, the
Chairman of the Board of Commissioners:&mdash;</p>

"We cannot allow Mr. Gouger to relinquish his situation as
Colonial Secretary of this Province without expressing our deep
feeling of regret that he should have been so summarily suspended
from an office which he had filled with zeal and ability, which
few could have surpassed, and without expressing the sincere
respect and esteem we feel for his character. In looking forward
to the future, we strongly feel that the loss to the public
service of one so well qualified to assist in carrying forward
the great principles upon which this colony has been formed, must
greatly retard the rapid progress which it has hitherto made. And
further, that the security and confidence we have felt that the
best measures would be adopted for the public benefit, have been
much lessened by the treatment of one who has laboured so much
and so unremittingly for the colony. As landholders and as
individuals who have vested their whole interest in South
Australia, we have felt it our duty to lay before you our
sentiments on this important occasion, and trust that the appeal
we feel compelled to make to you will not be without its
effect.</p>

wool and oil for England. She is a splendid vessel (457 tons
register), and a refreshing breeze carried her down Gulf St.
Vincent at the rate of seven knots an hour.<br>
<br>
"Before the next morning we found ourselves past the Back Stairs
Passage, and fairly in the ocean. How different were my
sensations when I last entered a ship! I was embarking in the
<i>Africaine</i> from England to South Australia, with feelings
raised to a high pitch of enthusiasm by the success which then
crowned my hopes of seven years. The province was founded. I had
recently married, and was taking to it my beloved wife. I am now
quitting it for the purpose of seeking justice for the colony...
But I am leaving it without my wife .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
child .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>November</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Thoughts in relation to my
melancholy bereavement filled my mind for some days on boards and
deprived me alike of peace by day and sleep by night. I became
seriously indisposed, and was unable to leave my bed. I gradually
recovered, however, strong stimulants having been given to me,
and, by the twelfth day, when we reached Van Diemen's Land, I was
much better. We had had adverse and rather boisterous winds
immediately after entering Encounter Bay, until within two days
of our arrival, which had made this voyage, instead of a five or
six days' run, just double that time.<br>
<br>
<i>Nov</i>. 22.&mdash;" We started this morning in the cutter
down the river Tamar to Launceston, the ship having anchored at
George Town until her destination was finally determined. It was
a lovely day, the wind fair, and I had hardly been ten minutes in
the boat before I felt the soothing influence of the scene.<br>
<br>
"The rapid progress of the cutter, the loveliness of the
ever-changing scenery, the healthy freshness of the wind,
softened, however, by a warm sun, acted with almost magical force
upon me, and brought me a quiet serenity of mind, which I have
seldom felt equalled, and I entered Launceston a different
being.<br>
<br>
"<i>Dec</i>. 7th.&mdash;On arrival at Hobart Town I called on
Maconochie (the Governor's private secretary), and found him, as
in England, remarkably friendly. He told me I must see the
Governor, but on my telling him I came simply to pay my respects
to him (the Governor) as a matter of courtesy, and as I thought
he might fancy himself placed in a disagreeable position as
between Hindmarsh and myself, I begged Maconochie to tell him
that if that should be the case, I should wish to be told he was
too busy to see me. Maconochie took the hint, and so did
Franklin, for, on my calling at 2 o'clock, I was told Sir John
could not possibly see me, he was too much engaged! On the
following morning I returned to Kermodes at Mona Vale.<br>
<br>
"During my stay at Hobart Town, I called on Mr. Todd, a gentleman
who had been deterred from going to South Australia in
consequence of the squabbles. I have so explained matters that I
am convinced he will yet go. Mr. Clowes, however, a Scotch
clergyman with a large family, who had determined to go to the
Province, is now moving off to Port Philip. This shows
<i>some</i> of the harm the Governor has done the colony.<br>
<br>
"<i>January</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1838.&mdash;The year opens with the
most gloomy prospects for the Province. On Saturday, December
30th, news arrived of the death of Sir J. W. Jeffcott. He had
left S. Australia on the 19th November, to proceed to V. D. Land,
but having been disappointed at not finding a vessel at Kangaroo
Island for Launceston, he was advised to go to Encounter Bay,
where the <i>Gem</i> was said to be.<br>
<br>
"He accordingly went in the <i>South Australian</i>, and was on
board her when a severe gale came on, and destroyed her (the
<i>Gem</i> was not at Encounter Bay). From this ship he escaped,
and all were saved, but, being obliged to remain at Encounter Bay
for some time, he went, with some other persons, to take
Alexandrina upon an exploring expedition, and when returning the
boat upset in a heavy surf, by which he. Captain Blinkinsopp, and
two men, were drowned. The afflicting tidings reached me at Mona
Vale, and spread distress around. Miss Kermode, to whom he was to
have been immediately married, bore the intelligence with great
firmness.<br>
<br>
"<i>March</i>, 1838.&mdash;I continue this record on board the
<i>K. S. Forbes</i>, on my voyage to England, but before speaking
of her I must dispose of V. D. Land and my friends
there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"About the end of January, Mr. Mann arrived in Hobart Town from
South Australia, he having resigned his office of
Advocate-General, in consequence of his differences of opinion to
the Judge and Governor upon essential points. He came for the
purpose of consulting Stephen relative to the powers of the
Governor and Council, and as to some libel cases which the
Colonial Commissioner has against the Editor of the
<i>Gazette</i>. From him I learn the appointment of Jickling to
be Judge, Wigley to be Resident Magistrate, Johnson, Clerk of the
Court, and, in his place of Advocate-General, George Stephen was
to appear. This last person is neither a barrister nor attorney,
but was merely Clerk of the Court at Hobart Town. All these
appointments took place without the consent of the Council of
Government, and that of George Stephen, without the Council even
being informed of the intention.<br>
<br>
"I was at Kermode's when Mann arrived, and being informed of the
fact I immediately went to Hobart Town, and remained with him
until my departure, with the exception of a week when I went to
Ellenthorpe.<br>
<br>
"How much time have I lost at Fisher's request! I promised to
stay until I received cases from him to lay before Alfred
Stephen. These cases never arrived, and I never once heard from
him until Mann's arrival. I have thus lost three months, during
the greater part of which I ought to have been performing my
voyage. However, I have acted as I thought most desirable for the
interests of the Province, and I must extract consolation from
the conviction. This stay has, moreover, cost me at least £50
more than it would if I had pursued my journey direct. About the
middle of February I heard from Morphett, enclosing a specimen of
the attacks made upon those adverse to the Government. Papers
scattered about at night! Insidious slanders propagated in
darkness! This is the way in which the Governor's party thinks
fit to try to injure their adversaries. But enough of these
people! It is ¦ fortunate that the people in V. D. Land
understand the bearings of South Australian politics; they do not
believe one word of the <i>Gazette</i>, and they have shown how
they appreciate the calumnies which have been propagated therein,
by their kindness and hospitality to me. Mr. Pedder, the Chief
Justice, Mr. McDowel, the Attorney-General, Captain Swanston, and
many of the first persons in the colony, have called upon me, and
invited me to their houses. This, moreover, is without an
introduction to any one of them.<br>
<br>
"Nothing can be more gratifying to me, politically, than has been
my reception in Van Diemen's Land.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"The influence of transportation (convictism) extends itself
beyond the sphere of those immediately connected with the
management of it. The women and children of the highest class are
frequently prejudicially acted upon by convictism, and the mode
adopted to govern it. They become tyrannical, vindictive, and
severe. This temper once formed, its influence runs through all
domestic relationships, and the consequence is a general want of
blandness of manner and kindness&mdash;even between the most
intimate relations. I have heard ladies using language, to which
their ears have become habituated by the propinquity of their
convict servants, which, when they first arrived in the colony,
must have been abhorrent to them. I have heard ladies threaten
their men with a 'little bit of solitary' for misdemeanours of
the most pardonable kind, and I have known a lady order her
servant to drive her to the police office, where she laid a
complaint against him; his back was 'scratched,' or 'teazled,' to
use colonial phrases,&mdash;in English, he was flogged, and he
was then ordered to drive back the fair mistress. The children
are brought up with these examples before them, and I have heard
them, when just escaping from infancy, hold out similar threats
to their female servants, who were, a few months before, their
nurses. The men are generally overbearing, sometimes cruel, or
when the mind takes that course, either from natural mildness, or
because it is seen that the harshness they can use will not
avail, their servants are treated with a lenity amounting to
puerility."</p>
<p align="center"><span class="a">Voyage from Hobart Town to
England</span> <i>viâ</i> <span class="a">Cape Horn</span>.</p>
<p class="quote">"<i>March</i> 8<i>th</i>, 1838.&mdash;Left
Hobart Town in the morning early, anchored off the Retreat, five
miles down the Derwent, for Captain Veil and two passengers. The
next morning the voyage may be said to have fairly commenced.<br>
<br>
"<i>March</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;The dreaded voyage to the Horn
has, as yet, been more like summer sailing than in the Southern
Pacific. The cabin is made very warm and comfortable by a stove,
which has been fixed in it, and I have enjoyed much better health
than during the whole year past. Although the anniversaries of
this day, and of the 11th, bring to my mind vividly (and what
days do not?) the loss of my beloved wife and child, still my
renewed health gives elasticity to my spirits, and I have been
able to review the death-bed scenes of those so dear to me with
more quiet than I could have anticipated.<br>
<br>
"<i>April</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Passed the bulwarks of a ship
painted green inside and black outside. The <i>Glenberin</i> is
thus painted, in which my friends, the Parramores, have
sailed.<br>
<br>
"<i>April</i> 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Passed the Falkland Islands,
without, however, seeing them, and we are now protected from the
swell occasioned by the strong westerly winds which have hitherto
blown.<br>
<br>
"The Captain talks of going into Bahia or Pernambuco for cabin
supplies and water. I am sorry for this, as it will prolong the
voyage.<br>
<br>
"<i>April</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Going on exceedingly well; since
the 19th we have made eleven degrees of latitude northward, and
the weather is therefore much warmer.<br>
<br>
"<i>May</i> 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;On April 30th a severe gale set in
from the north-west, which obliged us to close reef top sails,
and carry only sufficient sail to keep the ship steady. It
continued all night, and about noon the next day the sea was
tremendous; the wind still increasing.<br>
<br>
"While we were at dinner, at half-past three, a man came running
in to ask what was to be done&mdash;the wind had suddenly chopped
round to the south-east, and there was every appearance of a
storm from that quarter. In less than five minutes, however,
there was a dead calm, the two winds had met precisely where we
were, and it was not till an hour had elapsed that the breeze set
in well from the south. The appearance of the seas on this
meeting of the winds was very peculiar, the waves, which were
very high, and coming rapidly from the northward, were met by the
south-east wind, and a spray thereby occasioned equal to that of
the most fearful breakers on a rocky coast. To-day it is a dead
calm; we are nearly in the latitude of Buenos Ayres.<br>
<br>
"<i>May</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;To-day the whole ship was thrown
into consternation. We had anchored off Pernambuco in 5½ fathoms
water, and the Captain had gone ashore for the purpose of making
arrangements relative to the supply of water and fresh
provisions, when we found that we had anchored at high tide, and
that the water was shoaling so fast that we feared for the safety
of the ship. In a short time afterwards she bumped violently
against the bottom.<br>
<br>
"The chief mate immediately sent the second mate on shore to
inform Captain Veil of the danger the ship was in, and he hoisted
the Captain's private signal.<br>
<br>
"In the meantime the sky became cloudy, and a heavy squall arose
from leeward, bringing in with it a fearful swell. The evening at
this time was approaching, and there was no moon. The striking of
the ship increased in frequency and violence, and now became very
alarming; the strokes took place at each pitching of the vessel,
the mast and rigging trembled terribly, the rudder was injured
though not unshipped, but each moment seemed to threaten fatal
injury. The wind again was blowing on shore, so that it was
impossible to ship anchor and go to sea, a thing which the chief
mate would have done at his own risk if the wind had allowed him.
About 8 o'clock the Captain came on board and brought
intelligence that the lowest tide was at half-past eight, and
that he had made arrangements on shore that launches and troops
from the arsenal were to be sent up to render aid in case he
fired guns of distress. About half-past nine the wind veered and
came off from the land, whereupon Yell determined to weigh anchor
and get, if possible, off the reef. About half-past ten the
anchor was up, and the time for determining our fate had arrived.
If she moved not, it was evident she would, by the morning, be a
wreck, and the wind was so light there was little hope of forcing
her over. For some time she drifted with the current, still
striking hard occasionally, and there seemed but little hope but
that, in the course of a short time, we should be against the
rocks of Blinda, an eminence to the northward of Pernambuco. Guns
of distress were consequently fired, for not only the cargo but
our lives seemed somewhat to depend upon assistance from the
shore. (I ought to have said that our jolly boat was left ashore
by the second mate, he and his crew returning in the cutter with
the Captain; and the cutter broke away from the ship during one
of the concussions whilst she was on the reef.) Our guns were
answered by blue lights, and the hope of assistance somewhat
relieved our feelings.<br>
<br>
"At this time my own sensations were tried to the uttermost. The
chief mate told me he feared it would be all over with the ship,
and that by the morning she would be a complete wreck. He had
heard me say (he said) that I had valuable papers on board, and
he recommended me to put them at once into an empty water cask,
to which he would attach a pig of iron for an anchor, and throw
both overboard, as the most sure way of saving them and any other
things I had about me. At the same time Miss K. fell into strong
hysterics, and by way of preventing the attention of the Captain
and officers being devoted to her, she became my charge. Her
female servant refused to help her, saying that she had enough to
do to think of herself! I made no reply to the woman, nor to the
steward who also refused assistance. My own mind was mercifully
preserved in a state of perfect tranquillity. I felt no fear, but
a firm confidence in the Almighty filled my heart; and knowing
how little I could expect from human aid, I placed myself in His
hands, and never in my recollection before felt so powerfully the
strength of religious consolation and trust. During the whole
time, when not occupied in getting Miss R. round, or in pulling
at ropes, &amp;c., my mind was occupied in prayer, and surely it
was answered, both in the tranquillity of my mind, and the event
of the danger.<br>
<br>
"When there remained in the minds of the Captain and officers
hardly a hope of saving the ship, the land breeze set in with
some strength, and the ship gradually answered to her helm. Still
we were not off the shoal, but she struck continually with so
much force that I could sometimes hardly keep on my legs, and
this continued until about half-past eleven, when the soundings
gradually deepened, and she bore away to the eastward into deep
water. We had been upon the reef bumping for about six hours. In
the morning we found ourselves about eight miles to the northward
of Pernambuco, with a strong current carrying us northward, and
an adverse wind. The ship, too, was making about double the
quantity of water which she made when she sprang a leak at the
commencement of the voyage (about 9 inches an hour), still,
however, no very serious injury appeared to have been sustained.
She is a remarkably strong ship, having the bottom of an 800-ton
ship, and to this it is perhaps owing that the damage done is so
little. In the middle of the following night we again found
ourselves opposite Pernambuco, and we again anchored in the
roads, but about two miles south of the bank, the cause of our
injury and trouble.<br>
<br>
"We landed at Pernambuco in the course of the morning, and
received the congratulations of those of its inhabitants with
whom we had dealings, they having given up all hope of the ship
being saved.<br>
<br>
"<i>May</i> 28<i>th</i>, In the course of last night we incurred
a second danger in consequence of the chronometer being injured
by the shock of the ship's bumping on the night of the 21st. The
Island of Fernando de Noranha, about ten miles long by three
wide, was announced about one o'clock this morning, to be right
ahead of the ship, whereas the chronometer gave the longitude of
the ship at least a degree to the eastward of the Island. In an
instant the ship was put about, and we sailed in a south-east
course until daybreak, when we again tacked, and about the middle
of the day went between it and the Roccas shoal, a most dangerous
reef, some miles to the westward. We shall now have to depend
upon dead reckoning and lunars instead of the chronometer for our
longitude. The night was very dark, and the great height of the
land alone rendered it visible to the sailors. Our ship, her
cargo&mdash;and perhaps our lives, have thus been twice saved
within a week, from dangers which were apparent to us&mdash;from
how many <i>unseen</i> dangers have we been protected? Who can
tell? Our nearness to severe injury, or death, from imseen
causes, is doubtless much more frequent than from causes seen,
and upon which our energies can be brought to operate, yet for
<i>these</i> mercies how seldom is gratitude felt!<br>
<br>
"<i>June</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;I now allow days to pass me not
unnoticed, but silently, which under other circumstances would
have been mentioned with joy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
"<i>June</i> 13<i>th</i>.&mdash;I have been again miserably ill.
My anxiety has well-nigh overcome me, and the task I am about to
encounter weighs upon my mind fearfully. Oh! that the first three
days after my arrival were well over! I am so conscious of right
respecting my political matters, that I am perfectly easy on that
score; if I could know I should meet my relatives alive and in
health, I should indeed rejoice&mdash;the anticipation of fresh
calamity has been the occasion of my last fit of
illness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After three days of intense
suffering how delightful is the sudden return to ease! My eyes,
however, will yet hardly permit me to read or to do this little
bit of writing.<br>
<br>
"<i>June</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;We are now fast losing sight of
the southern constellations, the North Pole star is in sight, and
the Great Bear has for some days been visible. The first time I
saw the Southern Cross I recollected, and have by no means yet
forgotten, a school incident relating thereto. Disregarding my
proper geographical lesson, I was amusing myself by looking on
the celestial globe at the Horologium&mdash;the cross and other
constellations, only seen in the southern world&mdash;when the
lord of the ferule came behind me, and hitting me rather
viciously with the cane on my hand, told me to mind my work and
not care about things I should never see, unless I went to Botany
Bay to see them. With the perverseness, however, common to human
nature, what I was ordered to disregard I paid considerable
attention to, whenever I observed the master's eye engaged.
Little did he think of the part I was to play in Australian
Politics!<br>
<br>
"<i>July</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Again becalmed! although it is
usual for the westerly wind to blow here a gale almost, we are,
as it seems to <i>us</i>, unfortunate enough to make very slow
progress. I say, <i>as it seems to us</i>, for unless we knew all
the contingencies upon our stoppage, and all to which a quicker
passage might lead, we cannot decide that our detention is
unfortunate... This kind of reasoning, and more to which it
leads, makes me bear any disappointment with comparative ease,
but not without an occasional twinge in the head.<br>
<br>
"<i>July</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;During the last two days we have
had nearly a gale of wind from the westward, thus driving us on
homeward at a great rate. If it lasts, we shall (without
accident) soon be in the Channel.<br>
<br>
"The weather is very thick and hazy, very like that we
experienced near Cape Horn. It is also very cold.<br>
<br>
"<i>July</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;The fog has continued until
to-day; it is now tolerably fine, and there is still every
probability of my voyage terminating with the end of this week or
the beginning of next. I can now hardly go off the deck to the
retirement of my cabin, so attractive has it become.<br>
<br>
"We have to-day seen four large ships (two are now visible from
my window), and it is yet but noon! What a change is this to the
desolateness of one part of our voyage, where we passed more than
eight weeks consecutively, without seeing a human being besides
our fellow-passengers! By means of great abstemiousness,
exercise, and some degree of mental control, I am in better
health than at any time during the voyage. I have not tasted for
a long time any stimulating liquor; I eat meat very slenderly, if
at all, at breakfast, take an ordinary dinner, and, instead of
tea or coffee, a glass of water and some dry toast is my repast
at night.<br>
<br>
"<i>July</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;We are now in the Channel, and
learn from a ship we have just spoken, that we are opposite the
Eddystone.<br>
<br>
"It is rather nervous work sailing in the Channel in a dense fog
and a gale of wind.<br>
<br>
"<i>July</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;To-day we saw land."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>
<h4>LENGTHENING SHADOWS.</h4>
<p><span class="a">The</span> memoranda of his return voyage to
England is the last of the papers of Robert Gouger, and what
remains to be told of his life-story must be told with great
brevity.</p>
<p>On his arrival in England, he found, to his intense
satisfaction, that not only had his suspension not been
acknowledged, but that he had at once been reinstated and
Governor Hindmarsh recalled, Colonel Gawler having been appointed
to succeed him. He found, too, that his father and mother and all
his home circle, by whom he was tenderly loved, were alive and
well, and that everywhere the old friendships, contracted, in the
busy years of early colonisation work, were as fresh and green as
ever.</p>
<p>It was with no little satisfaction that he received, soon
after his arrival, a parchment, which ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center" class="quote">"The Undersigned,<br>
"Proprietors of Land, and Persons interested in<br>
"the Colony of South Australia,<br>
"cannot refrain from expressing to<br>
"<span class="u">Robert Gouger, Esquire</span>,</p>
<p class="quote">during his temporary stay in England, the high
sense they entertain of his exertions on behalf of the infant
colony, and their sympathy at the unjust and arbitrary conduct
displayed towards him by the late Governor, in suspending him
from the office of Colonial Secretary.<br>
<br>
"Prior to Mr. Gouger's return to the colony, the undersigned have
resolved to present him with a piece of plate as a slight
testimonial of their esteem and confidence."</p>
<br>
<p>Attached to this was a long list of signatures, including
those of George Morphett, Abraham Borradaile, Rowland Hill, Peter
Peachey, John Wright, the Directors of the South Australian
Company, and a host of other names familiar to US in the earlier
chapters of this work.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year the handsome "piece of plate" duly
arrived, with a letter from Mr. Morphett, whose signature stood
first on the parchment:&mdash;</p>

"A few of the early and steadfast friends of the new colony of
South Australia, have availed themselves of your visit to England
to present to you the accompanying tribute as a testimonial of
their sense of your exertions in the establishment of the colony,
and in the support of its principles in many periods of
difficulty and trial.<br>
<br>
"The result of these exertions is now a matter of history, and
all who are interested in the welfare of the colony must, and do,
feel grateful to you, and the other labourers in the cause, for
the pain and anxiety you have endured on its behalf. The piece of
plate which accompanies this letter, and of which I have to
request your acceptance, has been purchased by the subscription
of the friends of the colony to whom I have referred, and I can
assure you I feel great satisfaction in being made their organ to
convey to you the expression of their sentiments. It is the
earnest wish of the subscribers that you may long live to enjoy
the pleasure and comfort resulting from your exertions on behalf
of South Australia, and, although many could better express their
wishes and feelings towards you, no one can more sincerely
entertain them than,</p>

<p class="negindent3">"<i>To Robert Gouger, Esq., Colonial
Secretary<br>
"of South Australia</i>."</p>
<p>The peace and rest of home, the company of old friends, the
birth of a new hope with regard to his future domestic life, and,
above all, the relief that came with the public acknowledgment
that his treatment in the colony had been unjustifiable, brought
back much of his former health and spirits, and the visit to
England, which at one time he had so much dreaded, turned into a
pleasant, as it was a much-needed, holiday.</p>
<p>In February, 1839, he started on his return voyage to the
colony, taking with him his second wife, to whom he had been
married in the previous October&mdash;a lady who, as Miss Sarah
Whittem, of Kenilworth, he had long known as cousin. Never was a
woman more suited for a colonist's wife; practical, energetic,
untiring, and withal sympathetic and affectionate. Soon after her
marriage she acted as her husband's devoted secretary, thus
materially lightening his work, and cheering him in the many
difficulties which made so great a demand upon his strength.</p>
<p>Robert Gouger arrived at Adelaide on the 26th of June, 1839,
and was warmly welcomed by his old colleagues on resuming the
office of Colonial Secretary. Captain Hindmarsh had left the
colony, and Colonel Gawler&mdash;a man of a totally different
type of character, ruled in his stead. But there was a crisis at
hand&mdash;one of the severest the colony ever had to pass
through.</p>
<p>Governor Gawler, when he arrived in the colony, found many
settlers really destitute, and to relieve these he commenced a
number of Government works. He constructed a good road between
Adelaide and Port Adelaide, formed wharves, built a Custom House,
warehouses, and a handsome Government House, the latter at a cost
of £20,000. "To benefit the colony. Colonel Gawler spent his own
private fortune in paying the wages of those employed, and tried
to persuade English merchants to send out provisions and clothing
for the famished people. The only means he had of payment for
these expenses was by drafts on the British Treasury, amounting
to about £300,000, which were dishonoured by the Government, and
the colony thus became insolvent, with a national debt of
£400,000. His summary dismissal from office was anything but
creditable to the British Government.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Loyau'a "Representative Men of South
Australia."]</p>
<p>During the whole of this trying period, Mr. Gouger worked
incessantly; but the old cheerfulness and high spirits, that had
formerly characterised his labours, began to fail&mdash;he was
not the man he had been, and what once was a pleasure became a
burden. The tasks he had once imposed upon himself became at
length impossible, and when Sir George Grey assumed the reins of
government, in succession to Colonel Gawler, Mr. Gouger appealed
to him to be released from the arduous and responsible office of
Colonial Secretary. This was readily acceded to by Sir George
Grey, who at once appointed him to the lighter and less exacting
duties of Colonial Treasurer.</p>
<p>In this office he continued until 1844, when his health so
entirely failed as to make it necessary for him to resign his
appointment and all other duties connected with the colony.</p>
<p>Before he left South Australia on his last voyage, he was
presented with a memorial, petitioning Her Majesty's Government
to grant him a pension. The memorial ran thus:&mdash;</p>

relinquishment of office, and to commend his services to your
Lordship's consideration, with the earnest hope that it may
please Her Majesty to confer on him&mdash;out of such means as
are placed at Her Majesty's disposal for such purposes&mdash;a
retiring pension.<br>
<br>
Your memorialists would not venture to prefer this request to
your Lordship, were they not deeply sensible that to the services
of Mr. Gouger the Colony is mainly indebted for its
formation.<br>
<br>
"When others had almost abandoned the hope of its establishment,
Mr. Gouger's untiring energy and perseverance, through years of
effort from 1829 to 1836&mdash;37, were eventually successful,
and his ardent wishes realised in the foundation of the Colony.
That these services were appreciated, Mr. Gouger's appointment as
Colonial Secretary fully attests, and his re-appointment by Her
Majesty's Government, after his suspension by Governor Hindmarsh,
even before his arrival in England, proves, that his talents and
official ability were recognised at home. The excitement and
anxiety incident to this event, coupled with his assiduous and
unremitting attention to the interests of the Colony, seem to
have made too great a demand upon his mental powers.<br>
<br>
"They are aware that in the prosecution of his early exertions
Mr. Gouger made considerable pecuniary sacrifices, and that the
expenses of colonial life have precluded the possibility of a
provision for his declining days.<br>
<br>
"Attached as your memorialists are to this Colony, of which many
of them are among the earliest settlers, and therefore better
acquainted with Mr. Gouger's merits, and believing that this
Province&mdash;even now an important appendage to the British
Crown&mdash;will, at no distant period, become one of its most
valuable possessions, they trust, that one who has so eminently
conduced to its existence and prosperity, will not be deemed
unworthy of the Royal favour and bounty.<br>

<br>
<p>Although this petition was signed by ninety-six of the
earliest colonists&mdash;now risen to be amongst the most
influential&mdash;it was not granted on the ground of the limited
period of service.</p>
<p>Broken in health, impoverished in fortune, he came home to
die. His mind, consequent upon the too heavy strain placed upon
it, gradually gave way, and in August, 1846, he was laid to rest
in the family vault at Norwood, near London.</p>
<p>The estimate given of Mr. Gouger's character in the opening
chapter of this work has, we think, been fully borne out by the
story of his life. He did a great work, and he did it wisely and
well. Countless thousands have been indebted to him, and South
Australia, flourishing and prosperous, is his chief debtor. But
there to-day&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="poem">"Young children gather as their own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The harvest which the dead have sown&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead, forgotten or
unknown."</p>
<p>No monument is erected to his memory in this country, where he
did so much to alleviate distress at a time of over-population
and great commercial depression, and where he opened up a sphere
for successful enterprise through all future time;&mdash;a simple
tombstone alone marks his resting-place at Norwood.</p>
<p>In Adelaide, a humble street, almost unknown among the new and
handsome ones that now grace the Queen of Colonial Cities, bears
his name, but for the rest, his record is mainly in the dusty
archives of the colony.</p>
<p>A modern poet says:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p class="poem">"And oftentimes we chafe, and think it hard<br>
That we should lay our great and costly stones<br>
For other men to build on, and get praised,<br>
While our names are forgotten or passed o'er."</p>
<br>
<p>"Would it not be well, therefore, that some day a handsome
memorial should adorn the choicest spot in Adelaide, and find a
conspicuous place in the Imperial Institute in London, with a
group representing the Fathers and Founders of South Australia,
including Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who set forth the principles
on which it was to be colonised; Robert Gouger, who created and
sustained a permanent interest in the colony, and without whose
strenuous labours the scheme would have collapsed; Colonel
Torrens, who worked vigorously in Parliament to obtain the Act of
Parliament to erect it into a British Province; and George Fife
Angas, who made the working of the Act of Parliament
possible.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.*</h3>
<p class="foot">[* See page 137.]</p>
<p><span class="a">The</span> important part played by Mr. Gouger
in the passage of the South Australian Colony Bill through the
House of Lords, by personally interviewing the Duke of
Wellington, and arousing his profoundest sympathy with the new
experiment in colonisation, is set forth in the following paper
which is in sorted here in order that the sequence of events may
not be broken. Moreover, in this place, it forms a fitting sequel
to the story of "The Founding of South Australia":&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><span class="u">The Duke of Wellington and
South Australia.</span></p>
<p class="quote">"The British public are deeply indebted to the
late Duke of Wellington, and also to the original South
Australian Commissioners, for the foundation of the Colony of
South Australia, and more especially for the trial and
establishment of the self-supporting system of
Colonisation&mdash;the experiment being tried and carried out in
South Australia, in 1836, entirely by the energy, character, and
credit of the original South Australian Commissioners, without
costing the British Public one sixpence; whereas all the other
Colonies have cost, and are costing to this day, very large sums
annually.<br>
<br>
"The Revenue of South Australia up to the quarter ending 30th
September, 1852, was equal to £125,450 7s. 4d. per annum, and the
expenditure to £72,130 5s. 8d., leaving a surplus of £53,320 1s.
8d. (<i>vide</i> the Governor, Sir Henry Young's address on the
opening of his council).<br>
<br>
"The original devisers of the self-supporting scheme belonged to
what is termed now, the "Liberal Party," but the Whig or Liberal
Government of 1834 refused to support them, when at the eleventh
hour (in July, 1834), Mr. Gouger, the Honorary Secretary of the
Provisional Committee of the South Australian Association, in
despair, applied to the Duke of Wellington for an interview,
which was granted. He then laid the whole scheme before his
Grace, and entreated his support and countenance for it. The Duke
of Wellington entered very fully into the plans of the South
Australian Association, and Mr. Gouger's reasons, and said that
he should like to see the experiment tried, concluding by telling
Mr. Gouger to let him have the Bill then before Parliament, with
all the particulars, and he would use his endeavours to pass it
through the House of Lords, which he did on the 16th of August,
1834; and afterwards, when the Duke and Lord Aberdeen held the
Seals of Office for a short time in February, 1835, they took the
requisite steps for putting this Act of Parliament in
operation.<br>
<br>
"The Commissioners, whom the Duke and Lord Aberdeen approved of
in February, 1835, were afterwards sanctioned by Lord Glenelg, in
April, 1835, on his succeeding to office, and appointed by His
Majesty William the Fourth, under the provisions of the Act of
Parliament.<br>
<br>
"These Commissioners succeeded, by their energy, character and
credit, in the City of London and elsewhere, not only to raise
the £35,000 by the sale of orders for land in South Australia, as
stipulated for by the Act of Parliament, but also £80,000 by way
of a loan, secured only on the future revenues of the Colony of
South Australia about to be established; of which sum, they
deposited £20,000 in the hands of Trustees, named by the Lords of
the Treasury, as a security against the Colony ever becoming
chargeable to the Mother Country, and gave their gratuitous
services to the country, from April, 1835, to 23rd of December,
1839; having, during that time planted a flourishing Colony at
Adelaide, of about 17,000 persons, and established a Government
with a Revenue of about £17,000 per annum, independent of the
land sales, which were realising at that time in England about
£50,000 per annum, and which sum was applied strictly for
emigration, agreeably to the provisions of the Act of Parliament;
when they were suddenly dismissed by the Colonial Minister of
that day, who prevailed upon her Majesty to appoint three
political supporters of his own as paid Commissioners, with
salaries of £1,000 per annum each, in their places, and then
stated to the Lords of the Treasury, by a minute, dated 23rd of
December, 1839, that he had recommended Her Majesty to dismiss
all the original South Australian Commissioners (excepting one)
because they had applied for salaries, which application the
majority of the original South Australian Commissioners proved,
before a Committee of the House of Commons on the 12th of March,
1841 (<i>vide</i> Evidence before the Select Committee on South
Australia, pp. 102 to 124 of the Minutes of Evidence), not to
have been the case with their knowledge or concurrence.<br>
<br>
"And notwithstanding these original South Australian
Commissioners were appointed in the first place under the
sanction of the House of Commons for ten years, they were
displaced in about five, as above related, after giving their
gratuitous services to the Country without having received any
thanks or acknowledgments whatever from the House of Commons or
the Country, that being the only reward they ever desired."</p>
