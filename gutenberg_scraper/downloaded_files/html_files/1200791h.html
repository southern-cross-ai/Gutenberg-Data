<h1>A LIBERAL EDUCATION<br>
<small>A "GIPSY" STORY</small></h1>
<h3>ILLUSTRATED BY L. RAVEN-HILL</h3>
<h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XVIII, Nov 1903, pp
657-666</h3>
<br>
<hr>
<p>GIPSY removed his cigarette and glanced at the stranger. He was a small man,
with garb reminiscent of towns&mdash;a frock-coat struggling with adversity, a
glossy top-hat, owing its refulgent rays to benzoline. For the rest, the man
was red, and had sanguine eyes behind glasses. He carried a big portfolio under
his arm.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="1200791h-images/1200791h-01.jpg" alt=
"A small man, with garb reminiscent of towns"></p>
<p>"If it ain't a rude question," Gipsy said blandly, "what the dickens are
<i>you</i> after, mate?"</p>
<p>This was the dinner interlude. The clink of pick and the rattle of drill had
ceased, and gang B14 were feeding, for the most part, out of red bandana
handkerchiefs. Gipsy's cigarettes gained flavour from curiosity. Antiquarians
and archaeologists he knew, but the specimen before him was quite new. He had
never seen a book-agent before.</p>
<p>The small man, wandering into the big engineering camp high up the Valley of
Sweet Waters, needed no more cordial greeting. The tiniest spark of curiosity
blew up the floodgates of his loquacity. The glib words flowed on.</p>
<p>"'Arf time," Gipsy cut in. "The mate what shares my 'ut 'as got a parrot.
Maybe as you might teach him to say a few words."</p>
<p>The little man smiled, nothing abashed. He spread out before Gipsy's
admiring eyes a series of illustrations, views of the world at large, maps,
sections of the human form divine, models of more or less up-to-date
steam-engines&mdash;the whole pictorial art as applied to the "Universal
Compendium Encyclopsedia," complete in twelve monthly parts at seventeen and
sixpence per volume, first instalment down, the balance on faith. The
book-agent is childlike and trusting, possibly because the seventeen and six
down covers any predatory leaning on the part of the thirsty
knowledge-seeker.</p>
<p>"That's what you want," said the little man, with fine insight. "This
dictionary in itself, sir, is a liberal education. There's
nothing&mdash;<i>nothing</i> that you won't find in it."</p>
<p>"Think so?" Gipsy asked doubtfully. "Anything about prizefights,
mister?"</p>
<p>The little man pointed to a full-page drawing of a Roman gladiator,
obviously pirated from one of the late Lord Leighton's drawings. He would like
very much to know what Gipsy thought of that. The navvy was properly impressed.
He regarded the gladiator's biceps critically. With a fund of knowledge like
that, he would be uplifted over his fellows. Seventeen and sixpence was not
much whereby he might be placed intellectually on a level with the resident
engineers at Cwm House. Besides, when the thirst for knowledge played
subordinate to thirst of a more commonplace character, and the exchequer was
low, the volume would pawn in Rhayader for the requisite silver.</p>
<p>Gipsy rattled some money in his pocket. They were a sporting lot up the
valley, and Gipsy's second in the Derby "sweep" had brought in a matter of over
six pounds. He hesitated; seventeen and sixpence was not so much to a bachelor
sharing a hut and drawing thirty-two shillings a week.</p>
<p>"I'll take it," he said. "And 'ere's the first money down."</p>
<p>"Then I'll book your order, sir," the little man said. Gipsy swelled with
pride. His vivid imagination was running ahead of the present; there were
reminiscences of the Industrious Apprentice in his mind.</p>
<p>"Perhaps your other volumes may come a little under the month, in which
case&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I shan't mind that," Gipsy said largely. "You make out the paper."</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir. In that case, Form B is the one for you to sign. Your name,
sir, please? Gipsy? Very good. And your Christian name, sir?"</p>
<p>All this with a humility that filled Gipsy with a pleased sense of
importance. But as to the Christian name, there was a hitch. Did he possess
one, it was lost in the backwash of boyish memories. He had never been called
anything but Gipsy. At his feet lay a fine, florid drawing of Hercules. Gipsy
spelt out the word slowly&mdash;his infinite resource came back to him.</p>
<p>"Rum thing," he said. "My Christian name's the same as that knobby bloke
with the belt round his waist. H-e-r-c-u-l-e-s. Call it Herkules Gipsy, and
you've got it first pop. What yer laughin' at?"</p>
<p>The little man explained that he wasn't laughing at all, it was merely a
chronic catarrh, from which he had been a victim from boyhood. Gipsy scratched
a pleasing hieroglyphic at the foot of a long, blue form, the benzoline-glossy
hat was lifted with a flourish, and Gipsy was alone with the key of knowledge
in his grasp&mdash;cheap at seventeen and sixpence.</p>
<p>The publishers of the "Universal Compendium Encyclopaedia" were less
trustful than a first casual glance would have disclosed. But then Gipsy knew
nothing about "remainders" or the fact that many old works of this
nature&mdash;fruits of failure and bankruptcy of bygone publishers&mdash;are
sold as so much waste-paper, the body or corpse being subsequently clothed in
new outer garments and peddled to a confiding public through the medium of many
little men with dilapidated frock-coats and hats resplendent of benzoline. As a
matter of fact, had no further payment been made, the Universal Compendium
Publishing Company would have lost nothing&mdash;which fact Gipsy did not
grasp, as also he had no idea that he had signed a form consenting to receive
the balance of the volumes monthly, <i>or more frequently should the publisher
deem the latter course expedient</i>. Within a month the rest of the volumes
did arrive, carriage paid, in a neat box, plus an invoice for something over
&pound;10, with a footnote to the effect that if the balance were not paid
within fourteen days, proceedings for its recovery would be taken without
further notice.</p>
<p>All this, however, escaped the usually sharp eye of the seeker after
knowledge. It was very good of these people to send on the books which need not
be paid for yet. Meanwhile, Gipsy was progressing with his liberal education.
He knew something about Adam, who seemed to be mixed up in some way with a
peculiar kind of fireplace; he gained some new information about Africa; of
Agriculture he hoped presently to speak with authority; Algebra he was forced
to ignore altogether. But the greatest delight lay in the pictures&mdash;twenty
in each volume, harnessed to the text in the most indiscriminate fashion, but
there they were.</p>
<p>It was not to be supposed that so fine a sportsman as Gipsy could have kept
his new possessions a secret. There were those who scoffed, but others who
firmly believed. Mothers came to know if the big book had any hints as to the
teething of children, or the proper treatment of warts, whilst a third desired
information as to the best way to boil cabbages; young navvies, with an eye to
a hut of their own, asked Gipsy quietly if the book had any hints as to good,
plain furniture, and the best way to get it on the instalment plan.</p>
<p>"I'm doing my best for the settlement," Gipsy replied. "It's a tough job,
this 'ere liberal education, and apt to get confusing. I can't quite make out
where I am sometimes. There's Anatomy. Now, is it a new kind of metal or a
Colony in South Africa? But it'll all come right in time. Only I ain't found
anythink about warts or furniture in the book as yet."</p>
<p>"Look the warts up under 'Antibilious,'" Mitchell, the painter, suggested.
Mitchell was a man who had bid fair for fame as an artist at one time, only he
could never keep sober for more than a week at a time. He had a fine, cynical
humour of his own, a keen eye for character-study, and Gipsy, with his dramatic
instincts, fairly fascinated him. "You've got the chance of becoming a great
force here, old man."</p>
<p>Gipsy growled uneasily. He had a vague feeling that Mitchell had once been a
gentleman. He was a master of phrases, too. But amongst the ten thousand
navvies working, there were many who could have told lurid life-stories besides
Mitchell, the painter. Dandy, standing by, sneered openly.</p>
<p>"What's the good on it," he asked, "when you can get <i>Reynolds's</i> every
week for a brown? There ain't a good rattlin' bloomin' murder in all this
volume what Gipsy's so set up about."</p>
<p>Gipsy smiled in a superior manner. Dandy eyed him with disfavour&mdash;he
seemed to be on a different plane to his old mate now.</p>
<p>"Canteen's open," Mitchell suggested. "Come along. In the full flush of
newly acquired knowledge, Gipsy ought to be able to tell us something about
beer. Letter B, all in Volume I. of the Compendium."</p>
<p>"If you only knew what it was made of," Gipsy said in his most superior
manner. All the same, he was moving towards the canteen with the rest. "There's
a thing called quashyer&mdash;"</p>
<p>"If it was made o' mud flavoured with rotten eggs an' ditch-water," Dandy
said vehemently, "it 'ud be all the same to me. Beer's beer. Been fond of it
all my life, and ain't going to turn from it for all the Compendiums as was
ever wrote."</p>
<p>A murmur of applause followed. Gipsy so far bent to popular opinion as to
take a pint of the amber fluid himself. Sooth to say, he was a little tired of
the Compendium. It was beginning to dawn before him that he could not live up
to it. For the last month he and Dandy and Gammon had not had one poaching
excursion together.</p>
<p>"I don't want to keep that book to myself," he said. "I'm all for public
spirit. I'm going to turn it into a free library&mdash;one volume a week, turn
and turn about. The subscription's a bob, limited to a 'undred. I'll collect
that bob from a 'undred of you, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Bet you a tanner you don't collect five of 'em," a sportsman in the
background suggested.</p>
<p>"Them as likes to jine, 'old up your hands," Gipsy said loftily.</p>
<p>There was no headstrong desire to comply with the request. The Higher
Education found no favour in the camp. Two shillings only were proffered, both
coupled with the suggestion that the coin should be promptly disbursed by Gipsy
in the universal liquid. But even more enlightened communities have shown
themselves averse to the blessings of the Free Libraries Act. Gipsy made a few
scornful remarks, passed in tolerating silence.</p>
<p>Comparatively early the seeker after knowledge left his hut. Mitchell, the
painter, accompanied him at his request. Dandy openly flouted his old ally and
companion. Once the Compendium was a thing of the past, they might join forces
again; meanwhile Dandy avowedly preferred the company of Gammon. It was a blow
to Gipsy's pride, but he swallowed it.</p>
<p>Mitchell, the painter, was enjoying the comedy in his grave fashion. He had
forgotten many things in his fall, but the dry humour of the born cynic had
never failed him. He was laughing at Gipsy consumedly; but the latter was in
bland ignorance of the fact. He jerked his thumb hospitably towards the spare
chair in the hut and passed the tobacco.</p>
<p>"Wishing you hadn't gone in for higher classics?" Mitchell suggested.</p>
<p>"Got it first time," Gipsy said moodily. "It didn't sound much at first; but
when I comes to think serious like over that seventeen bob a month... besides,
I got all the books. And now they've sent me three papers that I can't make
head or tail of. Like to see 'em?"</p>
<p>Mitchell nodded, and Gipsy produced three oblong sheets of dingy paper with
the Eoyal Arms on the top. They were vague and depressing documents to the
uninitiated, but Mitchell had had long experience in such matters during his
careless days.</p>
<p>"What are they all about, mate?" Gipsy asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"County-court summons, to begin with," Mitchell explained. "According to the
particulars attached to the summons, you signed an order for these books to be
delivered as the publishers deemed fit. As you didn't pay on delivery, they
have issued this summons&mdash;with costs, &pound;13 9s. 4d"</p>
<p>Gipsy exploded into a genial laugh. The faith in his purse amused him.</p>
<p>"Go on!" he cried. "<i>Me</i> pay &pound;13 <i>and</i> nine bob <i>and</i>
fourpence. Hope they'll get it."</p>
<p>"Hope they will," Mitchell proceeded genially. "You took no notice, and
judgment went by default."</p>
<p>"Sounds like a bit from the Compendium," Gipsy muttered. "Go on."</p>
<p>"So they issued a judgment summons, which costs you another ten shillings.
As you ignored that, a committal order was made against you, as this third
notice tells. Order suspended for fourteen days, but up to-morrow. You don't
seem to understand, my friend. You ought to have appeared at Rhayader and
explained matters to the judge. If this money isn't paid to-morrow, you will
have to go to Brecon Gaol for six weeks. Why didn't you tell me before?"</p>
<p>"What!" Gipsy roared. "An' this a free country an' all! Lord! what a fool
I've been! If I only 'ad the little cove with the slimy 'at 'ere now! Comin'
along and takin' advantage of a poor, ignorant bloke like myself. An' thirteen
pound nine an'&mdash;"</p>
<p>Gipsy paused, utterly overcome with the weight of this startling discovery.
He sat in a dazed kind of way whilst Mitchell expounded the procedure of
county-courts and the law as affecting the safety of the individual when the
said individual had contracted a debt that he could not pay.</p>
<p>"If you had appeared to the summons," Mitchell said, administering what
looked like very late comfort, "he might have let you off your bargain. At any
rate, he would have made an order for payment at a few shillings a month, or
something like that. As it is, you must pay at once. Of course, you have been
the victim of a book-agent's dodge, but that doesn't help you much."</p>
<p>Gipsy groaned, and the flavour faded from his tobacco.</p>
<p>"An' all this for books!" he said scornfully&mdash;"books! Things I can't
understand. I've puzzled over the things yonder till I've got a 'ead like
Sunday morning. If it 'ad been for something as 'ad done me good! What shall I
do about it, matey?"</p>
<p>Mitchell shook his head gravely. He looked deeply sympathetic. It was lucky
for him that he could enjoy comedy without outward evidence of the fact. He
could only suggest flight to some town. But Gipsy had cogent reasons for the
peaceful seclusion of the country. He'd wait till the police came</p>
<p>"They're not police," Mitchell explained. "They are county-court
bailiffs&mdash;probably there will be two of them, and they'll come from
Rhayader. If I were you, I should go to a place where the air was more suited
to your peculiar complaint."</p>
<p>But Gipsy declined to listen to any such temptations. His popularity counted
for something. He would take a day off to-morrow and borrow the money, levying
a small rate for the purpose. But, despite the measure of his popularity, Gipsy
met with a cool response. The Compendium gave no play to the imagination. If
Gipsy had lost a wife, for instance, or if he had assaulted a gamekeeper and
was seeking to make up a tine, it would have been a different matter.</p>
<p>A man who wasted on classic literature hard money, that might have been
spent on beer and tobacco, deserved no sympathy. A long morning's toil produced
something under twenty shillings, most of it gleaned with the point of the
bayonet, so to speak. In a lofty spirit, Gipsy had set out with the amiable
intention of taking no more than a shilling from each man. Early in the day he
had refused sevenpence in coppers with lurid language, by dinner-time he
accepted a threepenny-bit from a despised teetotaller, with a wan smile.
Literature is ever a thorny path.</p>
<p>"To think that I had come to this!" he said bitterly to Dandy in the
dinner-hour. "This 'ere Joey I got from 'Anks, what's a rabid teetotaller. An'
glad to get it. Well, mates?"</p>
<p>A gleam of the old geniality lighted Gipsy's eye as two strangers lounged up
to them. There was a hard look about them; there was no sympathy in the eye of
either. The taller of the two produced a paper.</p>
<p>"Looking for a party over a little matter of business," he said. "Name of
Hercules Gipsy."</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="1200791h-images/1200791h-02.jpg" alt=
"'Looking for a party over a little matter of business.'"></p>
<p>Dandy started and opened his mouth widely. Gipsy turned pale. If Dandy
spoke, he was lost.</p>
<p>"Herkules Gipsy," the little man said thoughtfully. "Why, that's my old pal,
dash my wig if 'e ain't "</p>
<p>Gipsy's thoughts were full of murder. His tea was hot&mdash;he thoughtfully
poured about half a pint over Dandy's leg.</p>
<p>"What you make all that row about?" he growled. "I know who you mean, matey.
It's a chap 'ere what bought a Compendium from a little bloke with a shiny 'at.
If I'd got 'im 'ere&mdash;leastways, I&mdash;well, there! Gipsy told me all
about it last night."</p>
<p>"Are you come to arrest 'im?" Dandy asked with sudden inspiration.</p>
<p>"For debt," the big stranger explained curtly. "Non-payment of a debt on
county-court judgment."</p>
<p>"Seen 'im lately?" Gipsy asked carelessly and perspiringly.</p>
<p>"Seen 'im this mornin'," Dandy replied. "Got all his best on, and his other
things done up in a 'ankerchief . 'Goin' to North Pole?' I says. ''Ookin' it,'
says he. 'What for?' says I. 'Got into a bit of a mess,' says 'e. So I let 'im
go, and there's an end on it."</p>
<p>"Unpopular, surly sort o' bloke, he was," Gipsy said thoughtfully. "Never
did nothing but poke about in readin' books or that kind o' thing. Bet a tanner
'e's gone to Rhayader to look after 'is wife."</p>
<p>Dandy volunteered further details. Hercules Gipsy owed him a lot of
money&mdash;he owed money all round, in fact. Dandy was glad that he had got
into trouble. The strangers moved on presently and were lost to sight down the
valley. Gipsy sat on a stone and wiped his beaded forehead.</p>
<p>"I owe you one for that, mate," he said. "But those chaps'll come back
again. It mayn't be to-day, or yet to-morrow, but they'll come. And what's the
good o' this?"</p>
<p>Gipsy displayed a big fist with some poundsworth of dingy silver in the
centre of the hard palm, and snarled at it with bitter contempt. Dandy smiled.
For the middle of the week this was wealth.</p>
<p>"I pulled you out of that, old 'un," he said. "An' a man don't think fast on
a 'ot day like this. Might as well be 'ung for a sheep as a lamb."</p>
<p>"Righto," Gipsy said recklessly. "Come on. This way to the waxworks. It's
going to be sixes."</p>
<p>The canteen stood invitingly open, the day was hot. The full measure of the
canteen allowance was partaken of, and then the pair slipped out of the
Settlement to the inviting shade of a public-house opposite. As Gipsy's pocket
grew lighter, his spirits rose.</p>
<p>"I'll go and lie down," he said hazily. "I've got a plan. Dandy. I've got a
plan, if I could only think of it. It's a very good plan, mate. I'll raise the
money and pay off the little bloke in the glossy 'at. No, I won't, I'll keep
the brass and see him further first!"</p>
<p>He pulled his cap fiercely over his eyes and strode resolutely in the
direction of his hut. Dandy sighed into his empty mug and followed with
discreet silence.</p>
<br>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>For the time being the philosophical side of Gipsy's nature was submerged.
He had expected better things of his fellow-men. Also there was the blow to his
pride. He had yet to learn that when popularity pulls against pocket, the
struggle is a terribly unequal one. Anyway, this money must be found. Gipsy had
tried to raise the rate openly and upon the strength of his individuality, and
he had failed. He had no intention of going to gaol&mdash;his Romany blood
turned cold at the mere suggestion; he would resort to strategy.</p>
<p>The man was a born dramatist and a maker of stories, only a beneficent
legislation had not caught him early enough to teach him the proper equipment.
He approached the matter now from the point of view of the novelist who has got
his hero in a tight place and is bound to get him out of it again.</p>
<p>As Gipsy sat over his pipe, illumination came to him. He must impose upon a
credulous public. A wide grin expanded over his face. He took down the volumes
of the Compendium and selected a dozen or more of the engravings therein, and
then by the aid of his knife he detached them neatly from the bindings. The
plan of campaign was perfect. Gipsy waited now to see Mitchell, the painter,
who took his evening stroll about this time. Presently the artist lounged
along.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="1200791h-images/1200791h-03.jpg" alt=
"Presently the artist lounged along."></p>
<p>"'Arf a mo'," Gipsy drawled. "Want to earn a quid?"</p>
<p>Mitchell shook his head doubtfully. As a rule, his elderly housekeeper drew
his pay and allowed him a certain modicum for tobacco-money. It was the only
way in which the artist could possibly wrestle successfully with the drink
craze. Give him a sovereign, and he would do nothing till it was gone.</p>
<p>"How long have you been a capitalist?" he asked. "Left over from the
library, eh?"</p>
<p>Gipsy said something forcible on the subject of tabloid education. He
pointed to the selected engravings taken by him from the Compendium.</p>
<p>"What a fool thing to do!" Mitchell expostulated. "Poor as the volumes were
before, they are worth nothing now. You have utterly spoilt them."</p>
<p>Gipsy winked solemnly. There was all the air of a successful dramatist about
him.</p>
<p>"I'm going to get you to help me," he said. "You just go and get those
paints of yours&mdash;the oils. Bring all the pretty 'uns. I've got to get out
of this mess; and if I ain't just a bloomin' Bobs at this game, strike me pink!
Look at this bloke."</p>
<p>At arm's length Gipsy held up a counterfeit presentment of Hercules in a
boxing attitude. He stood on a pedestal and was obviously "after" some
celebrated statue or another. Gipsy eyed the muscular form admiringly.</p>
<p>"That's a model of physical development," Gipsy remarked. "The blighted
Compendium says so. Also it's a work of art. Just so. An' if I took and tried
to raise a bob on old 'Erkules in the canteen, I couldn't do it. But nobody's
seen 'Erkules, which is a good thing. He's no good now, but you'll see when
we've done with 'im. Go and get your paints."</p>
<p>There was comedy here somewhere, as Mitchell recognised. He had a profound
admiration for Gipsy and his many "slim" expedients. He came from the class of
men who know how to jest with a straight face. Mitchell came back presently
with his oils and brushes, and Gipsy carefully locked the door before lighting
the lamp.</p>
<p>"Now look 'ere," he said. "You've got to 'elp me over this job, matey. We've
got to raise the spondulix from the delooded public. You just tackle old
'Erkules as I tell you. Take and paint 'im in tights, and a championship belt
round 'is middle. Shove them bunches of fives of 'isn into four-ounce
gloves."</p>
<p>"Make him a boxer and a bruiser up to date?" Mitchell asked with a grin.</p>
<p>"That's the time o' day," Gipsy said drily. "Up to date. Turn that 'ere
butcher's block what he's standing on into a platform, and a rope round it.
Wade in."</p>
<p>Mitchell waded in accordingly. At the end of half-an-hour the classic
engraving of the famous athlete was transformed into a glaring oil presentment
of a modern boxer of the approved type. Mitchell had been purposely prodigal of
his colouring, and Gipsy was loudly enthusiastic. The flagrant vulgarity of it
appealed to him strongly.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="1200791h-images/1200791h-04.jpg" alt=
"Mitchell waded in accordingly."></p>
<p>"Spiffin'!" he said. "Just <i>the</i> ticket for soup. All it wants now is a
nice 'omely flavour of the pub about it. Just stick a red triangle with 'Bass's
Beer Only' underneath, just behind old 'Erkules's 'ead, and there you are.
What!"</p>
<p>Gipsy stood back and surveyed the work critically. Its crude colouring and
flaring vulgarity touched him to the soul. No British "navvy " with a grain of
sport in him could look upon that picture without the longing for
possession.</p>
<p>"How long before it's dry?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Dry now," Mitchell explained. "That porous paper soaks up the oil directly.
This is my masterpiece, Gipsy. I never hoped to paint anything like that."</p>
<p>Gipsy nodded approvingly. He was in the presence of genius. He took the
picture up and rolled it with the greatest care. He was going out, he
explained, as far as the canteen. If the painter possessed the fund of humour
that Gipsy credited him with, that virtue would be gratified if Mitchell would
look into the canteen a little later.</p>
<p>The canteen was pretty full as Gipsy entered. He took up his place at an
empty table and spread out his work of art before him; he appeared to be in
rapt and admiring contemplation. Presently one or two of his own gang lounged
across, to see the cause of this thoughtful silence. They fell under the spell
of Mitchell's genius.</p>
<p>"What is it, Gipsy?" asked one in an awed voice. "Where did you get 'im
from?"</p>
<p>"Won 'im," Gipsy said carelessly, "in a raffle. A bob a share&mdash;last
time I was in Cardiff. O' course you know who that is?"</p>
<p>"Bloke just trained ready for a mill, I reckon."</p>
<p>"Bloke ready for a mill!" Gipsy said, with bitter scorn. "Where do you come
from? Was it four or five years you got? That there's Tom Flannigan, the Irish
Terror, just before his successful scrap last March with Long Coffin, the
American Champion. Knocked 'is man out after thirty-two rounds, lasting two
hours."</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="1200791h-images/1200791h-05.jpg" alt=
"'That there's Tom Flannigan, the Irish Terror.'"></p>
<p>The others gasped. The famous fight was still fresh in the recollection of
most of them. It was impossible to look upon that form and those colours
unmoved. Gipsy pinned the picture to the matchboarded wall behind him, and the
hands crowded round to admire. No famous creation from a fashionable artist
hung on the line attracted such respectful attention.</p>
<p>"I've got others," Gipsy said. "I value 'em at eight 'undred pounds. There
was ten thousand put into that raffle, at a bob a nob, and I got first prize.
Came by parcel post to-day, they did. Make me wish I was a married man, it
does. To think of a 'ut, with some good sticks o' furniture, and them things
'angin' on the walls!"</p>
<p>"Want to sell it, Gipsy?" a distant voice asked anxiously.</p>
<p>Gipsy looked up, caught the eye of Mitchell, who was standing in the
doorway. Neither man smiled; but if both had shouted with laughter, they could
not have understood one another more perfectly. The luxury of the comedy was
theirs alone.</p>
<p>"Well, I wasn't thinking about it," Gipsy said slowly. The suggestion
appeared to give him a fresh train of thought. "It ain't often as a poor bloke
like myself gets a picture what lots of nobs would be proud to 'ang in their
drorin'-rooms. But I've 'ad misfortunes, as most of you know, and a few
pounds&mdash;what'll you stand, Jimmie?"</p>
<p>"Ten bob," Jimmie said promptly, "an' a go of gin."</p>
<p>Gipsy snorted. If it had been pounds, now! He stood up, as if inspired by a
new idea. The full light of the lamps shone on the dazzling colour picture. Why
not raffle it at a shilling a share? Say sixty shares at that modest figure. A
responsive murmur followed. Half-an-hour later, Gipsy strolled thoughtfully
homeward with a bulging pocketful of greasy silver coins. Mitchell followed.
After all, there were other acts to follow, and the first had been
excellent.</p>
<p>"You'll get on," the painter said. "I should never have thought of
that."</p>
<p>"Came to me like a perspiration," Gipsy said modestly. "Only I might 'ave
waited a little longer. Believe I could 'a' got the whole bloomin' thirteen
quid out o' that 'ere effort o' yourn. But there's more where the other came
from. 'Oo's this?"</p>
<p>"That is a portrait of Sarah Siddons, the great tragedy actress, after
Romney," Mitchell explained, as Gipsy proffered him a further illustration from
the Compendium. "What do you propose to do with her? Leave us some of our
illusions, Gipsy."</p>
<p>"She'll do," Gipsy muttered. "She's going to be the cellubrated Miss Netta
Montgomery, what played in Nelson's portable theatre down at Cwm all last
winter. Every single bloke in the settlement was fair gone on her, though I
found 'er second-class myself. Lot o' yaller 'air an' a dress all over
spangles. You know the sort of thing. Then I'll get another three quid for
that. 'Ere's a cottage and what you call a landscape."</p>
<p>"Anne Hathaway's cottage," Mitchell murmured.</p>
<p>"Niver 'eard of 'er," Gipsy went on. "But it's goin' to be made into the Red
'Ouse up the valley, where the shepherd killed his wife in the spring. Put a
few piles o' timber and a derrick in the background, and there you are. I
shan't do much with it amongst the boys, but the wives will fairly rise to it.
Give 'em a touch of the 'orrors, and you've got 'em every time."</p>
<p>Mitchell nodded. His face was grave, but his eyes danced with amusement. The
oil was burning low in the lamp before he had finished his work. There was an
expression of placid contentment on Gipsy's face.</p>
<p>"Come in to-morrow and do the other one," he suggested. "Strike me! I shan't
want to trouble you any more after that. 'Picture of the Bronze 'Orse at
Venice.' Touch 'im up, and put a boy in a pair o' tight breeches leadin' 'im by
a 'alter, and there's the winner of the year's Derby what most of us backed.
I'm goin' to pay for the bloomin' Compendium on this job, so as it'll cost me
nothink. So long."</p>
<p>The following evening was a busy one for Gipsy. As he had confidently
expected, there was a brisk demand amongst the younger fraternity over the
portrait of Miss Netta Montgomery. She fell to Gammon, who had been a
particular victim to her charms, but not until Gipsy had disposed of nearly
eighty tickets. An almost equal popularity was enjoyed by the transformed
Bronze Horse, whilst the mothers of the camp took a vivid, if morbid, interest
in the picture of the Red House, where the murder had been committed.</p>
<p>Gipsy raked the money in and posed as a benefactor at the same time. His
enterprise and public spirit enabled the settlement to gratify a natural
passion for the best in art. But for Gipsy these elevating objects would never
have found their way here at all. Later on, in the seclusion of his hut, Gipsy
counted his spoils.</p>
<p>"'Ave some baccy," he suggested hospitably to Mitchell. "Fill your pouch...
Fourteen pounds seventeen and sixpence. Dunnow where the tanner came from. When
the bailiffs come, I shall be able to talk to 'em now. Still&mdash;"</p>
<p>Gipsy's face clouded thoughtfully. He had earned all that his own bright and
particular seemed a pity to waste it on mere publishers. Many a beautiful
spree, many a lurid Saturday night shone from that pile of silver on the
table.</p>
<p>"Seems a pity, don't it?" Mitchell suggested, watching his companion's
thoughts.</p>
<p>"Pity!" Gipsy snorted. "It's what them drapers call an appallin' sacrifice.
Still, it ain't me what's goin' to pay for the Compendium. An' yet&mdash;"</p>
<p>Gipsy pulled at his pipe thoughtfully. He sat there under the lamplight
after Mitchell had departed, thinking the matter out. The novelist in the rough
had got his hero out of a tight place; but in all properly appointed romances
the hero not only escapes from imminent peril in the deadly breach, but is in
honour bound to score over the miscreants who, for the time being, have
triumphed. And Gipsy practically had not scored at all. Being his own hero, he
felt it. Thoughtfully he took an envelope and addressed it to the publishers of
the Compendium. Then he produced a sheet of paper and laboriously proceeded to
write a letter. It was a slow and painful process, but in the end it seemed
satisfactory :&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Box 171, P.O.</i><br>
<i>Water Company's Scheme,</i><br>
<i>Cwm Valley.</i></p>
<p><i>Sirs,</i></p>
<p><i>A few friends of Mr Ercules Gipsy wot's left the valley and no address is
desirous of seein wot I can do in the matter of the Compendium. Which never
ought to have been sent in the way it was. Out of respec to the memory of Mr
Gipsy and if he could be allode to come back we'll between us send you four
pound</i> ["five" scratched carefully out] <i>and no questions ask. This to
clear off all back pay and put the time sheet right. A answer from you by the
next post saying as this is all right money will be sent.</i></p>
<p><i>Yours respeckfully for 6 of us,</i></p>
<p><i>Jon Price.</i></p>
<p>Gipsy duly despatched his letter, comfortable with the assurance that there
were some scores of John Prices in the settlement. For the next day or two he
was dreamy and preoccupied. The third day brought a letter from the publishers
of the Compendium, offering, with large magnanimity, to cancel the debt and all
proceedings on receipt of five pounds, coupled with a rider to the effect that
the money must be received by return of post. It cost Gipsy a pang to part with
his five sovereigns, but there was sweet consolation in the fact that he had
the Compendium, plus nearly ten pounds, and that without the outlay of a single
penny of his own money. Thus do the heroes of romances score over mere mundane
and less brilliant creatures.</p>
<p>Gipsy ran into the arms of Mitchell as he came from the post-office.</p>
<p>"Suppose you had to pay?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Suppose I didn't," Gipsy said thoughtfully. "I wrote a letter to the
Compendium bloke sayin' as a few pals of Gipsy's 'ud like to&mdash;what you
call it?&mdash;compromise. And they took five bloomin' quid. And I've just
posted the brass. What do you think of that?"</p>
<p>Mitchell shook his head admiringly and passed on. Gipsy returned
thoughtfully to his hut. The gay volumes of the Compendium seemed to smile down
at him. He could think with toleration of the words of the wily little
book-agent now.</p>
<p>"After all," he muttered&mdash;"after all, there's something in a liberal
education."</p>
