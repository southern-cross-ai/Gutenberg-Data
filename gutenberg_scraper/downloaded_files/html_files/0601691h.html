<h2><a id="grisly1" name="grisly1">1. THE HORROR IN THE PINES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE SILENCE of the pine woods lay like a brooding
cloak about the soul of Bristol McGrath. The black shadows seemed
fixed, immovable as the weight of superstition that overhung this
forgotten back-country. Vague ancestral dreads stirred at the back
of McGrath's mind; for he was born in the pine woods, and sixteen
years of roaming about the world had not erased their shadows. The
fearsome tales at which he had shuddered as a child whispered again
in his consciousness; tales of black shapes stalking the midnight
glades...</p>

<p>Cursing these childish memories, McGrath quickened his pace. The
dim trail wound tortuously between dense walls of giant trees. No
wonder he had been unable to hire anyone in the distant river
village to drive him to the Ballville estate. The road was
impassable for a vehicle, choked with rotting stumps and new
growth. Ahead of him it bent sharply.</p>

<p>McGrath halted short, frozen to immobility. The silence had been
broken at last, in such a way as to bring a chill tingling to the
backs of his hands. For the sound had been the unmistakable groan
of a human being in agony. Only for an instant was McGrath
motionless. Then he was gliding about the bend of the trail with
the noiseless slouch of a hunting panther.</p>

<p>A blue snub-nosed revolver had appeared as if by magic in his
right hand. His left involuntarily clenched in his pocket on the
bit of paper that was responsible for his presence in that grim
forest. That paper was a frantic and mysterious appeal for aid; it
was signed by McGrath's worst enemy, and contained the name of a
woman long dead.</p>

<p>McGrath rounded the bend in the trail, every nerve tense and
alert, expecting anything&mdash;except what he actually saw. His
startled eyes hung on the grisly object for an instant, and then
swept the forest walls. Nothing stirred there. A dozen feet back
from the trail visibility vanished in a ghoulish twilight, where
<i>anything</i> might lurk unseen. McGrath dropped to his knee
beside the figure that lay in the trail before him.</p>

<p>It was a man, spread-eagled, hands and feet bound to four pegs
driven deeply in the hard-packed earth; a black-bearded,
hook-nosed, swarthy man. "Ahmed!", muttered McGrath. "Ballville's
Arab Servant! God!"</p>

<p>For it was not the binding cords that brought the glaze to the
Arab's eyes. A weaker man than McGrath might have sickened at the
mutilations which keen knives had wrought on the man's body.
McGrath recognized the work of an expert in the art of torture. Yet
a spark of life still throbbed in the tough frame of the Arab.
McGrath's gray eyes grew bleaker as he noted the position of the
victim's body, and his mind flew back to another, grimmer jungle,
and a half-flayed black man pegged out on a path as a warning to
the white man who dared invade a forbidden land.</p>

<p>He cut the cords, shifted the dying man to a more comfortable
position. It was all he could do. He saw the delirium ebb
momentarily in the bloodshot eyes, saw recognition glimmer there.
Clots of bloody foam splashed the matted beard. The lips writhed
soundlessly, and McGrath glimpsed the bloody stump of a severed
tongue.</p>

<p>The black-nailed fingers began scrabbling in the dust. They
shook, clawing erratically, but with purpose. McGrath bent close,
tense with interest, and saw crooked lines grow under the quivering
fingers. With the last effort of an iron will, the Arab was tracing
a message in the characters of his own language. McGrath recognized
the name: "Richard Ballville"; it was followed by "danger," and the
hand waved weakly up the trail; then&mdash;and McGrath stiffened
convulsively&mdash;"<i>Constance.</i>" One final effort of the
dragging finger traced "John De Al&mdash;".</p>

<p>Suddenly the bloody frame was convulsed by one last sharp agony;
the lean, sinewy hand knotted spasmodically and then fell limp.
Ahmed ibn Suleyman was beyond vengeance or mercy.</p>

<p>McGrath rose, dusting his hands, aware of the tense stillness of
the grim woods around him; aware of a faint rustling in their
depths that was not caused by any breeze. He looked down at the
mangled figure with involuntary pity, though he knew well the
foulness of the Arab's heart, a black evil that had matched that of
Ahmed's master, Richard Ballville. Well, it seemed that master and
man had at last met their match in human fiendishness. But who, or
<i>what?</i> For a hundred years the Ballvilles had ruled supreme
over this back-country, first over their wide plantations and
hundreds of slaves, and later over the submissive descendants of
those slaves. Richard, the last of the Ballvilles, had exercised as
much authority over the pinelands as any of his autocratic
ancestors. Yet from this country where men had bowed to the
Ballvilles for a century, had come that frenzied cry of fear, a
telegram that McGrath clenched in his coat pocket.</p>

<p><br>
Stillness succeeded the rustling, more sinister than any sound.
McGrath knew he was watched; knew that the spot where Ahmed's body
lay was the invisible deadline that had been drawn for him. He
believed that he would be allowed to turn and retrace his steps
unmolested to the distant village. He knew that if he continued on
his way, death would strike him suddenly and unseen. Turning, he
strode back the way he had come.</p>

<p>He made the turn and kept straight on until he had passed
another crook in the trail. Then he halted, listened. All was
silent. Quickly he drew the paper from his pocket, smoothed out the
wrinkles and read, again, in the cramped scrawl of the man he hated
most on earth:</p>

<p class="letter">Bristol:</p>

<p class="letter">If you still love Constance Brand, for God's sake
forget your hate and come to Ballville Manor as quickly as the
devil can drive you.</p>

<p class="letter">RICHARD BALLVILLE.</p>

<p>That was all. It reached him by telegraph in that Far Western
city where McGrath had resided since his return from Africa. He
would have ignored it, but for the mention of Constance Brand. That
name had sent a choking, agonizing pulse of amazement through his
soul, had sent him racing toward the land of his birth by train and
plane, as if, indeed, the devil were on his heels. It was the name
of one he thought dead for three years; the name of the only woman
Bristol McGrath had ever loved.</p>

<p>Replacing the telegram, he left the trail and headed westward,
pushing his powerful frame between the thickset trees. His feet
made little sound on the matted pine needles. His progress was all
but noiseless. Not for nothing had he spent his boyhood in the
country of the big pines.</p>

<p>Three hundred yards from the old road he came upon that which he
sought&mdash;an ancient trail paralleling the road. Choked with
young growth, it was little more than a trace through the thick
pines. He knew that it ran to the back of the Ballville mansion;
did not believe the secret watchers would be guarding it. For how
could they know he remembered it?</p>

<p>He hurried south along it, his ears whetted for any sound. Sight
alone could not be trusted in that forest. The mansion, he knew,
was not far away, now. He was passing through what had once been
fields, in the days of Richard's grandfather, running almost up to
the spacious lawns that girdled the Manor. But for half a century
they had been abandoned to the advance of the forest.</p>

<p>But now he glimpsed the Manor, a hint of solid bulk among the
pine tops ahead of him. And almost simultaneously his heart shot
into his throat as a scream of human anguish knifed the stillness.
He could not tell whether it was a man or a woman who screamed, and
his thought that it might be a woman winged his feet in his
reckless dash toward the building that loomed starkly up just
beyond the straggling fringe of trees.</p>

<p>The young pines had even invaded the once generous lawns. The
whole place wore an aspect of decay. Behind the Manor, the barns,
and outhouses which once housed slave families, were crumbling in
ruin. The mansion itself seemed to totter above the litter, a
creaky giant, rat-gnawed and rotting, ready to collapse at any
untoward event. With the stealthy tread of a tiger Bristol McGrath
approached a window on the side of the house. From that window
sounds were issuing that were an affront to the tree-filtered
sunlight and a crawling horror to the brain.</p>

<p>Nerving himself for what he might see, he peered within.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="grisly2" name="grisly2">2. BLACK TORTURE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">He was looking into a great dusty chamber which
might have served as a ballroom in antebellum days; its lofty
ceiling was hung with cobwebs, its rich oak panels showed dark and
stained. But there was a fire in the great fireplace&mdash;a small
fire, just large enough to heat to a white glow the slender steel
rods thrust into it.</p>

<p>But it was only later that Bristol McGrath saw the fire and the
things that glowed on the hearth. His eyes were gripped like a
spell on the master of the Manor; and once again he looked on a
dying man.</p>

<p>A heavy beam had been nailed to the paneled wall, and from it
jutted a rude cross-piece. From this cross-piece Richard Ballville
hung by cords about his wrists. His toes barely touched the floor,
tantalizingly, inviting him to stretch his frame continually in an
effort to relieve the agonizing strain on his arms. The cords had
cut deeply into his wrists; blood trickled down his arms; his hands
were black and swollen almost to bursting. He was naked except for
his trousers, and McGrath saw that already the white-hot irons had
been horribly employed. There was reason enough for the deathly
pallor of the man, the cold beads of agony upon his skin. Only his
fierce vitality had allowed him thus long to survive the ghastly
burns on his limbs and body.</p>

<p>On his breast had been burned a curious symbol&mdash;a cold hand
laid itself on McGrath's spine. For he recognized that symbol, and
once again his memory raced away across the world and the years to
a black, grim, hideous jungle where drums bellowed in fire-shot
darkness and naked priests of an abhorred cult traced a frightful
symbol in quivering human flesh.</p>

<p>Between the fireplace and the dying man squatted a thick-set
black man, clad only in ragged, muddy trousers.</p>

<p>His back was toward the window, presenting an impressive pair of
shoulders. His bullet-head was set squarely between those gigantic
shoulders, like that of a frog, and he appeared to be avidly
watching the face of the man on the cross-piece.</p>

<p>Richard Ballville's bloodshot eyes were like those of a tortured
animal, but they were fully sane and conscious: they blazed with
desperate vitality. He lifted his head painfully and his gaze swept
the room. Outside the window McGrath instinctively shrank back. He
did not know whether Ballville saw him or not. The man showed no
sign to betray the presence of the watcher to the bestial black who
scrutinized him. Then the brute turned his head toward the fire,
reaching a long ape-like arm toward a glowing iron&mdash;and
Ballville's eyes blazed with a fierce and urgent meaning the
watcher could not mistake. McGrath did not need the agonized motion
of the tortured head that accompanied the look. With a tigerish
bound he was over the window-sill and in the room, even as the
startled black shot erect, whirling with apish agility.</p>

<p>McGrath had not drawn his gun. He dared not risk a shot that
might bring other foes upon him. There was a butcher-knife in the
belt that held up the ragged, muddy trousers. It seemed to leap
like a living thing into the hand of the black as he turned. But in
McGrath's hand gleamed a curved Afghan dagger that had served him
well in many a bygone battle.</p>

<p>Knowing the advantage of instant and relentless attack, he did
not pause. His feet scarcely touched the floor inside before they
were hurling him at the astounded black man.</p>

<p>An inarticulate cry burst from the thick red lips. The eyes
rolled wildly, the butcher-knife went back and hissed forward with
the swiftness of a striking cobra that would have disembowled a man
whose thews were less steely than those of Bristol McGrath.</p>

<p>But the black was involuntarily stumbling backward as he struck,
and that instinctive action slowed his stroke just enough for
McGrath to avoid it with a lightning-like twist of his torso. The
long blade hissed under his arm-pit, slicing cloth and
skin&mdash;and simultaneously the Afghan dagger ripped through the
black, bull throat.</p>

<p>There was no cry, but only a choking gurgle as the man fell,
spouting blood. McGrath had sprung free as a wolf springs after
delivering the death-stroke. Without emotion he surveyed his
handiwork. The black man was already dead, his head half severed
from his body. That slicing sidewise lunge that slew in silence,
severing the throat to the spinal column, was a favorite stroke of
the hairy hillmen that haunt the crags overhanging the Khyber Pass.
Less than a dozen white men have ever mastered it. Bristol McGrath
was one.</p>

<p>McGrath turned to Richard Ballville. Foam dripped on the seared,
naked breast, and blood trickled from the lips. McGrath feared that
Ballville had suffered the same mutilation that had rendered Ahmed
speechless; but it was only suffering and shock that numbed
Ballville's tongue. McGrath cut his cords and eased him down on a
worn old divan near by. Ballville's lean, muscle-corded body
quivered like taut steel strings under McGrath's hands. He gagged,
finding his voice.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd come!" he gasped, writhing at the contact of the
divan against his seared flesh. "I've hated you for years, but I
knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>McGrath's voice was harsh as the rasp of steel. "What did you
mean by your mention of Constance Brand? She is dead."</p>

<p>A ghastly smile twisted the thin lips.</p>

<p>"No, she's not dead! But she soon will be, if you don't hurry.
Quick! Brandy! There on the table&mdash;that beast didn't drink it
all."</p>

<p>McGrath held the bottle to his lips; Ballville drank avidly.
McGrath wondered at the man's iron nerve. That he was in ghastly
agony was obvious. He should be screaming in a delirium of pain.
Yet he held to sanity and spoke lucidly, though his voice was a
laboring croak.</p>

<p>"I haven't much time," he choked. "Don't interrupt. Save your
curses till later. We both loved Constance Brand. She loved you.
Three years ago she disappeared. Her garments were found on the
bank of a river. Her body was never recovered. You went to Africa
to drown your sorrow; I retired to the estate of my ancestors and
became a recluse.</p>

<p>"What you didn't know&mdash;what the world didn't know&mdash;was
that Constance Brand came with me! No, she didn't drown. That ruse
was my idea. For three years Constance Brand has lived in this
house!" He achieved a ghastly laugh. "Oh, don't look so stunned,
Bristol. She didn't come of her own free will. She loved you too
much. I kidnapped her, brought her here by force&mdash;Bristol!"
His voice rose to a frantic shriek. "If you kill me you'll never
learn where she is!"</p>

<p>The frenzied hands that had locked on his corded throat relaxed
and sanity returned to the red eyes of Bristol McGrath.</p>

<p>"Go on," he whispered in a voice not even he recognized.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it," gasped the dying man. "She was the only
woman I ever loved&mdash;oh, don't sneer, Bristol. The others
didn't count. I brought her here where I was king. She couldn't
escape, couldn't get word to the outside world. No one lives in
this section except nigger descendants of the slaves owned by my
family. My word is&mdash;<i>was</i>&mdash;their only law.</p>

<p>"I swear I didn't harm her. I only kept her prisoner, trying to
force her to marry me. I didn't want her any other way. I was mad,
but I couldn't help it. I come of a race of autocrats who took what
they wanted, recognized no law but their own desires. You know
that. You understand it. You come of the same breed yourself.</p>

<p>"Constance hates me, if that's any consolation to you, damn you.
She's strong, too. I thought I could break her spirit. But I
couldn't, not without the whip, and I couldn't bear to use that."
He grinned hideously at the wild growl that rose unbidden to
McGrath's lips. The big man's eyes were coals of fire; his hard
hands knotted into iron mallets.</p>

<p>A spasm racked Ballville, and blood started from his lips. His
grin faded and he hurried on.</p>

<p>"All went well until the foul fiend inspired me to send for John
De Albor. I met him in Vienna, years ago. He's from East
Africa&mdash;a devil in human form! He saw Constance&mdash;lusted
for her as only a man of his type can. When I finally realized
that, I tried to kill him. Then I found that he was stronger than
I; that he'd made himself master of the niggers&mdash;<i>my</i>
niggers, to whom my word had always been law. He told them his
devilish cult&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Voodoo," muttered McGrath involuntarily.</p>

<p>"No! Voodoo is infantile beside this black fiendishness. Look at
the symbol on my breast, where De Albor burned it with a white-hot
iron. You have been in Africa. You understand the brand of
Zambebwei.</p>

<p>"De Albor turned my negroes against me. I tried to escape with
Constance and Ahmed. My own blacks hemmed me in. I did smuggle a
telegram through to the village by a man who remained faithful to
me&mdash;they suspected him and tortured him until he admitted it.
John De Albor brought me his head.</p>

<p>"Before the final break I hid Constance in a place where no one
will ever find her, except you. De Albor tortured Ahmed until he
told that I had sent for a friend of the girl's to aid us. Then De
Albor sent his men up the road with what was left of Ahmed, as a
warning to you if you came. It was this morning that they seized
us; I hid Constance last night. Not even Ahmed knew where. De Albor
tortured me to make me tell&mdash;" the dying man's hands clenched
and a fierce passionate light blazed in his eyes. McGrath knew that
not all the torments of all the hells could ever have wrung that
secret from Ballville's iron lips.</p>

<p>"It was the least you could do," he said, his voice harsh with
conflicting emotions. "I've lived in hell for three years because
of you&mdash;and Constance has. You deserve to die. If you weren't
dying already I'd kill you myself."</p>

<p>"Damn you, do you think I want your forgiveness?" gasped the
dying man. "I'm glad you suffered. If Constance didn't need your
help, I'd like to see you dying as I'm dying&mdash;and I'll be
waiting for you in hell. But enough of this. De Albor left me
awhile to go up the road and assure himself that Ahmed was dead.
This beast got to swilling my brandy and decided to torture me some
himself.</p>

<p>"Now listen&mdash;Constance is hidden in Lost Cave. No man on
earth knows of its existence except you and me&mdash;not even the
negroes. Long ago I put an iron door in the entrance, and I killed
the man who did the work; so the secret is safe. There's no key.
You've got to open it by working certain knobs."</p>

<p>It was more and more difficult for the man to enunciate
intelligibly. Sweat dripped from his face, and the cords of his
arms quivered.</p>

<p>"Run your fingers over the edge of the door until you find three
knobs that form a triangle. You can't see them; you'll have to
feel. Press each one in counter-clockwise motion, three times,
around and around. Then pull on the bar. The door will open. Take
Constance and fight your way out. If you see they're going to get
you, shoot her! Don't let her fall into the hands of that black
beast&mdash;"</p>

<p>The voice rose to a shriek, foam spattered from the livid
writhing lips, and Richard Ballville heaved himself almost upright,
then toppled limply back. The iron will that had animated the
broken body had snapped at last, as a taut wire snaps.</p>

<p>McGrath looked down at the still form, his brain a maelstrom of
seething emotions, then wheeled, glaring, every nerve atingle, his
pistol springing into his hand.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="grisly3" name="grisly3">3. THE BLACK PRIEST</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A man stood in the doorway that opened upon the
great outer hall&mdash;a tall man in a strange alien garb. He wore
a turban and a silk coat belted with a gay-hued girdle. Turkish
slippers were on his feet. His skin was not much darker than
McGrath's, his features distinctly oriental in spite of the heavy
glasses he wore.</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you?" demanded McGrath, covering him.</p>

<p>"Ali ibn Suleyman, <i>effendi</i>," answered the other in
faultless Arabic. "I came to this place of devils at the urging of
my brother, Ahmed ibn Suleyman, whose soul may the Prophet ease. In
New Orleans the letter came to me. I hastened here. And lo,
stealing through the woods, I saw black men dragging my brother's
corpse to the river. I came on, seeking his master."</p>

<p>McGrath mutely indicated the dead man. The Arab bowed his head
in stately reverence.</p>

<p>"My brother loved him," he said. "I would have vengeance for my
brother and my brother's master. <i>Effendi</i>, let me go with
you."</p>

<p>"All right." McGrath was afire with impatience. He knew the
fanatical clan-loyalty of the Arabs, knew that Ahmed's one decent
trait had been a fierce devotion for the scoundrel he served.
"Follow me."</p>

<p>With a last glance at the master of the Manor and the black body
sprawling like a human sacrifice before him, McGrath left the
chamber of torture. Just so, he reflected, one of Ballville's
warrior-king ancestors might have lain in some dim past age, with a
slaughtered slave at his feet to serve his spirit in the land of
ghosts.</p>

<p>With the Arab at his heels, McGrath emerged into the girdling
pines that slumbered in the still heat of the noon. Faintly to his
ears a distant pulse of sound was borne by a vagrant drift of
breeze. It sounded like the throb of a faraway drum.</p>

<p>"Come on!" McGrath strode through the cluster of outhouses and
plunged into the woods that rose behind them. Here, too, had once
stretched the fields that built the wealth of the aristocratic
Ballvilles; but for many years they had been abandoned. Paths
straggled aimlessly through the ragged growth, until presently the
growing denseness of the trees told the invaders that they were in
forest that had never known the woodsman's ax. McGrath looked for a
path. Impressions received in childhood are always enduring. Memory
remains, overlaid by later things, but unerring through the years.
McGrath found the path he sought, a dim trace, twisting through the
trees.</p>

<p>They were forced to walk single file; the branches scraped their
clothing, their feet sank into the carpet of pine needles. The land
trended gradually lower. Pines gave way to cypresses, choked with
underbrush. Scummy pools of stagnant water glimmered under the
trees. Bullfrogs croaked, mosquitoes sang with maddening insistence
about them. Again the distant drum throbbed across the
pinelands.</p>

<p>McGrath shook the sweat out of his eyes. That drum roused
memories well fitted to these somber surroundings. His thoughts
reverted to the hideous scar seared on Richard Ballville's naked
breast. Ballville had supposed that he, McGrath, knew its meaning;
but he did not. That it portended black horror and madness he knew,
but its full significance he did not know. Only once before had he
seen that symbol, in the horror-haunted country of Zambebwei, into
which few white men had ever ventured, and from which only one
white man had ever escaped alive. Bristol McGrath was that man, and
he had only penetrated the fringe of that abysmal land of jungle
and black swamp. He had not been able to plunge deep enough into
that forbidden realm either to prove or to disprove the ghastly
tales men whispered of an ancient cult surviving a prehistoric age,
of the worship of a monstrosity whose mold violated an accepted law
of nature. Little enough he had seen; but what he had seen had
filled him with shuddering horror that sometimes returned now in
crimson nightmares.</p>

<p>No word had passed between the men since they had left the
Manor. McGrath plunged on through the vegetation that choked the
path. A fat, blunt-tailed moccasion slithered from under his feet
and vanished. Water could not be far away; a few more steps
revealed it. They stood on the edge of a dank, slimy marsh from
which rose a miasma of rotting vegetable matter. Cypresses shadowed
it. The path ended at its edge. The swamp stretched away and away,
lost to sight swiftly in twilight dimness.</p>

<p><br>
"What now, <i>effendi</i>?" asked Ali. "Are we to swim this
morass?"</p>

<p>"It's full of bottomless quagmires," answered McGrath. "It would
be suicide for a man to plunge into it. Not even the piny woods
niggers have ever tried to cross it. But there is a way to get to
the hill that rises in the middle of it. You can just barely
glimpse it, among the branches of the cypresses, see? Years ago,
when Ballville and I were boys&mdash;and friends&mdash;we
discovered an old, old Indian path, a secret, submerged road that
led to that hill. There's a cave in the hill, and a woman is
imprisoned in that cave. I'm going to it. Do you want to follow me,
or to wait for me here? The path is a dangerous one."</p>

<p>"I will go, <i>effendi</i>," answered the Arab.</p>

<p>McGrath nodded in appreciation, and began to scan the trees
about him. Presently he found what he was looking for a faint blaze
on a huge cypress, an old mark, almost imperceptible. Confidently
then, he stepped into the marsh beside the tree. He himself had
made that mark, long ago. Scummy water rose over his shoe soles,
but no higher. He stood on a flat rock, or rather on a heap of
rocks, the topmost of which was just below the stagnant surface.
Locating a certain gnarled cypress far out in the shadow of the
marsh, he began walking directly toward it, spacing his strides
carefully, each carrying him to a rockstep invisible below the
murky water. Ali ibn Suleyman followed him, imitating his
motions.</p>

<p>Through the swamp they went, following the marked trees that
were their guide-posts. McGrath wondered anew at the motives that
had impelled the ancient builders of the trail to bring these huge
rocks from afar and sink them like piles into the slush. The work
must have been stupendous, requiring no mean engineering skill. Why
had the Indians built this broken road to Lost Island? Surely that
isle and the cave in it had some religious significance to the red
men; or perhaps it was their refuge against some stronger foe.</p>

<p>The going was slow; a misstep meant a plunge into marshy ooze,
into unstable mire that might swallow a man alive. The island grew
out of the trees ahead of them&mdash;a small knoll, girdled by a
vegetation-choked beach. Through the foliage was visible the rocky
wall that rose sheer from the beach to a height of fifty or sixty
feet. It was almost like a granite block rising from a flat sandy
rim. The pinnacle was almost bare of growth.</p>

<p>McGrath was pale, his breath coming in quick gasps. As they
stepped upon the beach-like strip, Ali, with a glance of
commiseration, drew a flask from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Drink a little brandy, <i>effendi</i>," he urged, touching the
mouth to his own lips, oriental-fashion. "It will aid you."</p>

<p>McGrath knew that Ali thought his evident agitation was a result
of exhaustion. But he was scarcely aware of his recent exertions.
It was the emotions that raged within him&mdash;the thought of
Constance Brand, whose beautiful form had haunted his troubled
dreams for three dreary years. He gulped deeply of the liquor,
scarcely tasting it, and handed back the flask.</p>

<p>"Come on!"</p>

<p>The pounding of his own heart was suffocating, drowning the
distant drum, as he thrust through the choking vegetation at the
foot of the cliff. On the gray rock above the green mask appeared a
curious carven symbol, as he had seen it years ago, when its
discovery led him and Richard Ballville to the hidden cavern. He
tore aside the clinging vines and fronds, and his breath sucked in
at the sight of a heavy iron door set in the narrow mouth that
opened in the granite wall.</p>

<p>McGrath's fingers were trembling as they swept over the metal,
and behind him he could hear Ali breathing heavily. Some of the
white man's excitement had imparted itself to the Arab. McGrath's
hands found the three knobs, forming the apices of a
triangle&mdash;mere protuberances, not apparent to the sight.
Controlling his jumping nerves, he pressed them as Ballville had
instructed him, and felt each give slightly at the third pressure.
Then, holding his breath, he grasped the bar that was welded in the
middle of the door, and pulled. Smoothly, on oiled hinges, the
massive portal swung open.</p>

<p>They looked into a wide tunnel that ended in another door, this
a grille of steel bars. The tunnel was not dark; it was clean and
roomy, and the ceiling had been pierced to allow light to enter,
the holes covered with screens to keep out insects and reptiles.
But through the grille he glimpsed something that sent him racing
along the tunnel, his heart almost bursting through his ribs. Ali
was close at his heels.</p>

<p><br>
The grille-door was not locked. It swung outward under his fingers.
He stood motionless, almost stunned with the impact of his
emotions.</p>

<p>His eyes were dazzled by a gleam of gold; a sunbeam slanted down
through the pierced rock roof and struck mellow fire from the
glorious profusion of golden hair that flowed over the white arm
that pillowed the beautiful head on the carved oak table.</p>

<p>"<i>Constance!</i>" It was a cry of hunger and yearning that
burst from his livid lips.</p>

<p>Echoing the cry, the girl started up, staring wildly, her hands
at her temples, her lambent hair rippling over her shoulders. To
his dizzy gaze she seemed to float in an aureole of golden
light.</p>

<p>"Bristol! Bristol McGrath!" she echoed his call with a haunting,
incredulous cry. Then she was in his arms, her white arms clutching
him in a frantic embrace, as if she feared he were but a phantom
that might vanish from her.</p>

<p>For the moment the world ceased to exist for Bristol McGrath. He
might have been blind, deaf and dumb to the universe at large. His
dazed brain was cognizant only of the woman in his arms, his senses
drunken with the softness and fragrange of her, his soul stunned
with the overwhelming realization of a dream he had thought dead
and vanished for ever.</p>

<p>When he could think consecutively again, he shook himself like a
man coming out of a trance, and stared stupidly around him. He was
in a wide chamber, cut in the solid rock. Like the tunnel, it was
illumined from above, and the air was fresh and clean. There were
chairs, tables and a hammock, carpets on the rocky floor, cans of
food and a water-cooler. Ballville had not failed to provide for
his captive's comfort. McGrath glanced around at the Arab, and saw
him beyond the grille. Considerately he had not intruded upon their
reunion.</p>

<p>"Three years!" the girl was sobbing. "Three years I've waited. I
knew you'd come! I knew it! But we must be careful, my darling.
Richard will kill you if he finds you&mdash;kill us both!"</p>

<p>"He's beyond killing anyone," answered McGrath. "But just the
same, we've got to get out of here."</p>

<p>Her eyes flared with new terror.</p>

<p>"Yes! John De Albor! Ballville was afraid of him. That's why he
locked me in here. He said he'd sent for you. I was afraid for
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ali!" McGrath called. "Come in here. We're getting out of here
now, and we'd better take some water and food with us. We may have
to hide in the swamps for&mdash;"</p>

<p>Abruptly Constance shrieked, tore herself from her lover's arms.
And McGrath, frozen by the sudden, awful fear in her wide eyes,
felt the dull jolting impact of a savage blow at the base of his
skull. Consciousness did not leave him, but a strange paralysis
gripped him. He dropped like an empty sack on the stone floor and
lay there like a dead man, helplessly staring up at the scene which
tinged his brain with madness&mdash;Constance struggling frenziedly
in the grasp of the man he had known as Ali ibn Suleyman, now
terribly transformed.</p>

<p>The man had thrown off his turban and glasses. And in the murky
whites of his eyes, McGrath read the truth with its grisly
implications&mdash;the man was not an Arab. He was a negroid mixed
breed. Yet some of his blood must have been Arab, for there was a
slightly Semitic cast to his countenance, and this cast, together
with his oriental garb and his perfect acting of his part, had made
him seem genuine. But now all this was discarded and the negroid
strain was uppermost; even his voice, which had enunciated the
sonorous Arabic, was now the throaty gutturals of the negro.</p>

<p>"You've killed him!" the girl sobbed hysterically, striving
vainly to break away from the cruel fingers that prisoned her white
wrists.</p>

<p>"He's not dead yet," laughed the octoroon. "The fool quaffed
drugged brandy&mdash;a drug found only in the Zambebwei jungles. It
lies inactive in the system until made effective by a sharp blow on
a nerve center."</p>

<p>"Please do something for him!" she begged.</p>

<p>The fellow laughed brutally.</p>

<p>"Why should I? He has served his purpose. Let him lie there
until the swamp insects have picked his bones. I should like to
watch that&mdash;but we will be far away before nightfall." His
eyes blazed with the bestial gratification of possession. The sight
of this white beauty struggling in his grasp seemed to rouse all
the jungle lust in the man. McGrath's wrath and agony found
expression only in his bloodshot eyes. He could not move hand or
foot.</p>

<p>"It was well I returned alone to the Manor," laughed the
octoroon. "I stole up to the window while this fool talked with
Richard Ballville. The thought came to me to let him lead me to the
place where you were hidden. It had never occurred to me that there
was a hiding-place in the swamp. I had the Arab's coat, slippers
and turban; I had thought I might use them sometime. The glasses
helped, too. It was not difficult to make an Arab out of myself.
This man had never seen John De Albor. I was born in East Africa
and grew up a slave in the house of an Arab&mdash;before I ran away
and wandered to the land of Zambebwei.</p>

<p>"But enough. We must go. The drum has been muttering all day.
The blacks are restless. I promised them a sacrifice to Zemba. I
was going to use the Arab, but by the time I had tortured out of
him the information I desired, he was no longer fit for a
sacrifice. Well, let them bang their silly drum. They'd like to
have <i>you</i> for the Bride of Zemba, but they don't know I've
found you. I have a motor-boat hidden on the river five miles from
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You fool!" shrieked Constance, struggling passionately. "Do you
think you can carry a white girl down the river, like a slave?"</p>

<p>"I have a drug which will make you like a dead woman," he said.
"You will lie in the bottom of the boat, covered by sacks. When I
board the steamer that shall bear us from these shores, you will go
into my cabin in a large, well-ventilated trunk. You will know
nothing of the discomforts of the voyage. You will awake in
Africa&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was fumbling in his shirt, necessarily releasing her with one
hand. With a frenzied scream and a desperate wrench, she tore loose
and sped out through the tunnel. John De Albor plunged after her,
bellowing. A red haze floated before McGrath's maddened eyes. The
girl would plunge to her death in the swamps, unless she remembered
the guide-marks&mdash;perhaps it was death she sought, in
preference to the fate planned for her by the fiendish negro.</p>

<p>They had vanished from his sight, out of the tunnel; but
suddenly Constance screamed again, with a new poignancy. To
McGrath's ears came an excited jabbering of negro gutturals. De
Albor's accents were lifted in angry protest. Constance was sobbing
hysterically. The voices were moving away. McGrath got a vague
glimpse of a group of figures through the masking vegetation as
they moved across the line of the tunnel mouth. He saw Constance
being dragged along by half a dozen giant blacks typical pineland
dwellers, and after them came John De Albor, his hands eloquent in
dissension. That glimpse only, through the fronds, and then the
tunnel mouth gaped empty and the sound of splashing water faded
away through the marsh.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="grisly4" name="grisly4">4. THE BLACK GOD'S HUNGER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">In the brooding silence of the cavern Bristol
McGrath lay staring blankly upward, his soul a seething hell. Fool,
fool, to be taken in so easily! Yet, how could he have known? He
had never seen De Albor; he had supposed he was a fullblooded
negro. Ballville had called him a black beast, but he must have
been referring to his soul. De Albor, but for the betraying murk of
his eyes, might pass anywhere for a white man.</p>

<p>The presence of those black men meant but one thing: they had
followed him and De Albor, had seized Constance as she rushed from
the cave. De Albor's evident fear bore a hideous implication; he
had said the blacks wanted to sacrifice Constance&mdash;now she was
in their hands.</p>

<p>"God!" The word burst from McGrath's lips, startling in the
stillness, startling to the speaker. He was electrified; a few
moments before he had been dumb. But now he discovered he could
move his lips, his tongue. Life was stealing back through his dead
limbs; they stung as if with returning circulation. Frantically he
encouraged that sluggish flow. Laboriously he worked his
extremities, his fingers, hands, wrists and finally, with a surge
of wild triumph, his arms and legs. Perhaps De Albor's hellish drug
had lost some of its power through age. Perhaps McGrath's unusual
stamina threw off the effects as another man could not have
done.</p>

<p>The tunnel door had not been closed, and McGrath knew why; they
did not want to shut out the insects which would soon dispose of a
helpless body; already the pests were streaming through the door, a
noisome horde.</p>

<p>McGrath rose at last, staggering drunkenly, but with his
vitality surging more strongly each second. When he tottered from
the cave, no living thing met his glare. Hours had passed since the
negroes had departed with their prey. He strained his ears for the
drum. It was silent. The stillness rose like an invisible black
mist around him. Stumblingly he splashed along the rock-trail that
led to hard ground. Had the blacks taken their captive back to the
death-haunted Manor, or deeper into the pinelands?</p>

<p>Their tracks were thick in the mud: half a dozen pairs of bare,
splay feet, the slender prints of Constance's shoes, the marks of
De Albor's Turkish slippers. He followed them with increasing
difficulty as the ground grew higher and harder.</p>

<p>He would have missed the spot where they turned off the dim
trail but for the fluttering of a bit of silk in the faint breeze.
Constance had brushed against a tree-trunk there, and the rough
bark had shredded off a fragment of her dress. The band had been
headed east, toward the Manor. At the spot where the bit of cloth
hung, they had turned sharply southward. The matted pine needles
showed no tracks, but disarranged vines and branches bent aside
marked their progress, until McGrath, following these signs, came
out upon another trail leading southward.</p>

<p>Here and there were marshy spots, and these showed the prints of
feet, bare and shod. McGrath hastened along the trail, pistol in
hand, in full possession of his faculties at last. His face was
grim and pale. De Albor had not had an opportunity to disarm him
after striking that treacherous blow. Both the octoroon and the
blacks of the pinelands believed him to be lying helpless back in
Lost Cave. That, at least, was to his advantage.</p>

<p>He kept straining his ears in vain for the drum he had heard
earlier in the day. The silence did not reassure him. In a voodoo
sacrifice drums would be thundering, but he knew he was dealing
with something even more ancient and abhorrent than voodoo.</p>

<p>Voodoo was comparatively a young religion, after all, born in
the hills of Haiti. Behind the froth of voodooism rose the grim
religions of Africa, like granite cliffs glimpsed through a mask of
green fronds. Voodooism was a mewling infant beside the black,
immemorial colossus that had reared its terrible shape in the older
land through uncounted ages, Zambebwei! The very name sent a
shudder through him, symbolic of horror and fear. It was more than
the name of a country and the mysterious tribe that inhabited that
country; it signified something fearfully old and evil, something
that had survived its natural epoch&mdash;a religion of the Night,
and a deity whose name was Death and Horror.</p>

<p>He had seen no negro cabins. He knew these were farther to the
east and south, most of them, huddling along the banks of the river
and the tributary creeks. It was the instinct of the black man to
build his habitation by a river, as he had built by the Congo, the
Nile and the Niger since Time's first gray dawn. Zambebwei! The
word beat like a throb of a tom-tom through the brain of Bristol
McGrath. The soul of the black man had not changed, through the
slumberous centuries. Change might come in the clangor of city
streets, in the raw rhythms of Harlem; but the swamps of the
Mississippi do not differ enough from the swamps of the Congo to
work any great transmutation in the spirit of a race that was old
before the first white king wove the thatch of his wattled
hut-palace.</p>

<p>Following that winding path through the twilight dimness of the
big pines, McGrath did not find it in his soul to marvel that black
slimy tentacles from the depths of Africa had stretched across the
world to breed nightmares in an alien land. Certain natural
conditions produce certain effects, breed certain pestilences of
body or mind, regardless of their geographical situation. The
river-haunted pinelands were as abysmal in their way as were the
reeking African jungles.</p>

<p>The trend of the trail was away from the river. The land sloped
very gradually upward, and all signs of marsh vanished.</p>

<p><br>
The trail widened, showing signs of frequent use. McGrath became
nervous. At any moment he might meet someone. He took to the thick
woods alongside the trail, and forced his way onward, each movement
sounding cannon-loud to his whetted ears. Sweating with nervous
tension, he came presently upon a smaller path, which meandered in
the general direction he wished to go. The pinelands were
crisscrossed by such paths.</p>

<p>He followed it with greater ease and stealth, and presently,
coming to a crook in it, saw it join the main trail. Near the point
of junction stood a small log cabin, and between him and the cabin
squatted a big black man. This man was hidden behind the bole of a
huge pine beside the narrow path, and peering around it toward the
cabin. Obviously he was spying on someone, and it was quickly
apparent who this was, as John De Albor came to the door and stared
despairingly down the wide trail. The black watcher stiffened and
lifted his fingers to his mouth as if to sound a far-carrying
whistle, but De Albor shrugged his shoulders helplessly and turned
back into the cabin again. The negro relaxed, though he did not
alter his vigilance.</p>

<p>What this portended, McGrath did not know, nor did he pause to
speculate. At the sight of De Albor a red mist turned the sunlight
to blood, in which the black body before him floated like an ebony
goblin.</p>

<p>A panther stealing upon its kill would have made as much noise
as McGrath made in his glide down the path toward the squatting
black. He was aware of no personal animosity toward the man, who
was but an obstacle in his path of vengeance. Intent on the cabin,
the black man did not hear that stealthy approach. Oblivious to all
else, he did not move or turn&mdash;until the pistol butt descended
on his woolly skull with an impact that stretched him senseless
among the pine needles.</p>

<p>McGrath crouched above his motionless victim, listening. There
was no sound near by&mdash;but suddenly, far away, there rose a
long-drawn shriek that shuddered and died away. The blood congealed
in McGrath's veins. Once before he had heard that sound&mdash;in
the low forest-covered hills that fringe the borders of forbidden
Zambebwei; his black boys had turned the color of ashes and fallen
on their faces. What it was he did not know; and the explanation
offered by the shuddering natives had been too monstrous to be
accepted by a rational mind. They called it the voice of the god of
Zambebwei.</p>

<p>Stung to action, McGrath rushed down the path and hurled himself
against the back door of the cabin. He did not know how many blacks
were inside; he did not care. He was beserk with grief and
fury.</p>

<p>The door crashed inward under the impact. He lit on his feet
inside, crouching, gun leveled hip-high, lips asnarl.</p>

<p>But only one man faced him&mdash;John De Albor, who sprang to
his feet with a startled cry. The gun dropped from McGrath's
fingers. Neither lead nor steel could glut his hate now. It must be
with naked hands, turning back the pages of civilization to the red
dawn days of the primordial.</p>

<p>With a growl that was less like the cry of a man than the grunt
of a charging lion, McGrath's fierce hands locked about the
octoroon's throat. De Albor was borne backward by the hurtling
impact, and the men crashed together over a camp cot, smashing it
to ruins. And as they tumbled on the dirt floor, McGrath set
himself to kill his enemy with his bare fingers.</p>

<p>The octoroon was a tall man, rangy and strong. But against the
berserk white man he had no chance. He was hurled about like a sack
of straw, battered and smashed savagely against the floor, and the
iron fingers that were crushing his throat sank deeper and deeper
until his tongue protruded from his gaping blue lips and his eyes
were starting from his head. With death no more than a hand's
breadth from the octoroon, some measure of sanity returned to
McGrath.</p>

<p>He shook his head like a dazed bull; eased his terrible grip a
trifle, and snarled: "Where is the girl? Quick, before I kill
you!"</p>

<p>De Albor retched and fought for breath, ashen-faced. "The
blacks!" he gasped. "They have taken her to be the Bride of Zemba!
I could not prevent them. They demand a sacrifice. I offered them
you, but they said you were paralyzed and would die
anyway&mdash;they were cleverer than I thought. They followed me
back to the Manor from the spot where we left the Arab in the
road&mdash;followed us from the Manor to the island.</p>

<p>"They are out of hand&mdash;mad with blood-lust. But even I, who
know black men as none else knows them, I had forgotten that not
even a priest of Zambebwei can control them when the fire of
worship runs in their veins. I am their priest and master&mdash;yet
when I sought to save the girl, they forced me into this cabin and
set a man to watch me until the sacrifice is over. You must have
killed him; he would never have let you enter here."</p>

<p>With a chill grimness, McGrath picked up his pistol.</p>

<p>"You came here as Richard Ballville's friend," he said
unemotionally. "To get possession of Constance Brand, you made
devil-worshippers out of the black people. You deserve death for
that. When the European authorities that govern Africa catch a
priest of Zambebwei, they hang him. You have admitted that you are
a priest. Your life is forfeit on that score, too. But it is
because of your hellish teachings that Constance Brand is to die,
and it's for that reason that I'm going to blow out your
brains."</p>

<p>John De Albor shriveled. "She is not dead yet," he gasped, great
drops of perspiration dripping from his ashy face. "She will not
die until the moon is high above the pines. It is full tonight, the
Moon of Zambebwei. Don't kill me. Only I can save her. I know I
failed before. But if I go to them, appear to them suddenly and
without warning, they'll think it is because of supernatural powers
that I was able to escape from the hut without being seen by the
watchman. That will renew my prestige.</p>

<p>"You can't save her. You might shoot a few blacks, but there
would still be scores left to kill you&mdash;and her. But I have a
plan&mdash;yes, I am a priest of Zambebwei. When I was a boy I ran
away from my Arab master and wandered far until I came to the land
of Zambebwei. There I grew to manhood and became a priest, dwelling
there until the white blood in me drew me out in the world again to
learn the ways of the white men. When I came to America I brought a
<i>Zemba</i> with me&mdash;I can not tell you how.</p>

<p>"Let me save Constance Brand!" He was clawing at McGrath,
shaking as if with an ague. "I love her, even as you love her. I
will play fair with you both, I swear it! Let me save her! We can
fight for her later, and I'll kill you if I can."</p>

<p>The frankness of that statement swayed McGrath more than
anything else the octoroon could have said. It was a desperate
gamble&mdash;but after all, Constance would be no worse off with
John De Albor alive than she was already. She would be dead before
midnight unless something was done swiftly.</p>

<p>"Where is the place of sacrifice?" asked McGrath.</p>

<p>"Three miles away, in an open glade," answered De Albor. "South
on the trail that runs past my cabin. All the blacks are gathered
there except my guard and some others who are watching the trail
below the cabin. They are scattered out along it, the nearest out
of sight of my cabin, but within sound of the loud, shrill whistle
with which these people signal one another.</p>

<p>"This is my plan. You wait here in my cabin, or in the woods, as
you choose. I'll avoid the watchers on the trail, and appear
suddenly before the blacks at the House of Zemba. A sudden
appearance will impress them deeply, as I said. I know I can not
persuade them to abandon their plan, but I will make them postpone
the sacrifice until just before dawn. And before that time I will
manage to steal the girl and flee with her. I'll return to your
hiding-place, and we'll fight our way out together."</p>

<p>McGrath laughed. "Do you think I'm an utter fool? You'd send
your blacks to murder me, while you carried Constance away as you
planned. I'm going with you. I'll hide at the edge of the clearing,
to help you if you need help. And if you make a false move, I'll
get you, if I don't get anybody else."</p>

<p>The octoroon's murky eyes glittered, but he nodded
acquiescence.</p>

<p>"Help me bring your guard into the cabin," said McGrath. "He'll
be coming to soon. We'll tie and gag him and leave him here."</p>

<p>The sun was setting and twilight was stealing over the pinelands
as McGrath and his strange companion stole through the shadowy
woods. They had circled to the west to avoid the watchers on the
trail, and were now following on the many narrow footpaths which
traced their way through the forest. Silence reigned ahead of them,
and McGrath mentioned this.</p>

<p>"Zemba is a god of silence," muttered De Albor. "From sunset to
sunrise on the night of the full moon, no drum is beaten. If a dog
barks, it must be slain; if a baby cries, it must be killed.
Silence locks the jaws of the people until Zemba roars. Only
<i>his</i> voice is lifted on the night of the Moon of Zemba."</p>

<p>McGrath shuddered. The foul deity was an intangible spirit, of
course, embodied only in legend; but De Albor spoke of it as a
living thing.</p>

<p>A few stars were blinking out, and shadows crept through the
thick woods, blurring the trunks of the trees that melted together
in darkness. McGrath knew they could not be far from the House of
Zemba. He sensed the close presence of a throng of people, though
he heard nothing.</p>

<p>De Albor, ahead of him, halted suddenly, crouching. McGrath
stopped, trying to pierce the surrounding mask of interlacing
branches.</p>

<p>"What is it?" muttered the white man, reaching for his
pistol.</p>

<p>De Albor shook his head, straightening. McGrath could not see
the stone in his hand, caught up from the earth as he stooped.</p>

<p>"Do you hear something?" demanded McGrath.</p>

<p>De Albor motioned him to lean forward, as if to whisper in his
ear. Caught off his guard, McGrath bent toward him&mdash;even so he
divined the treacherous African's intention, but it was too late.
The stone in De Albor's hand crashed sickeningly against the white
man's temple. McGrath went down like a slaughtered ox, and De Albor
sped away down the path to vanish like a ghost in the gloom.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="grisly5" name="grisly5">5. THE VOICE OF ZEMBA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">In the darkness of the woodland path McGrath
stirred at last, and staggered groggily to his feet. That desperate
blow might have crushed the skull of a man whose physique and
vitality were not that of a bull. His head throbbed and there was
dried blood on his temple; but his strongest sensation was burning
scorn at himself for having again fallen victim to John De Albor.
And yet, who would have suspected that move? He knew De Albor would
kill him if he could, but he had not expected an attack
<i>before</i> the rescue of Constance. The fellow was dangerous and
unpredictable as a cobra. Had his pleas to be allowed to attempt
Constance's rescue been but a ruse to escape death at the hands of
McGrath?</p>

<p>McGrath stared dizzily at the stars that gleamed through the
ebon branches, and sighed with relief to see that the moon had not
yet risen. The pinewoods were black as only pinelands can be, with
a darkness that was almost tangible, like a substance that could be
cut with a knife.</p>

<p>McGrath had reason to be grateful for his rugged constitution.
Twice that day had John De Albor outwitted him, and twice the white
man's iron frame had survived the attack. His gun was in his
scabbard, his knife in its sheath. De Albor had not paused to
search, had not paused for a second stroke to make sure. Perhaps
there had been a tinge of panic in the African's actions.</p>

<p>Well, this did not change matters a great deal. He believed that
De Albor would make an effort to save the girl. And McGrath
intended to be on hand, whether to play a lone hand, or to aid the
octoroon. This was no time to hold grudges, with the girl's life at
stake. He groped down the path, spurred by a rising glow in the
east.</p>

<p>He came upon the glade almost before he knew it. The moon hung
in the low branches, blood-red, high enough to illumine it and the
throng of black people who squatted in a vast semicircle about it,
facing the moon. Their rolling eyes gleamed milkily in the shadows,
their features were grotesque masks. None spoke. No head turned
toward the bushes behind which he crouched.</p>

<p>He had vaguely expected blazing fires, a blood-stained altar,
drums and the chant of maddened worshippers; that would be voodoo.
But this was not voodoo, and there was a vast gulf between the two
cults. There were no fires, no altars. But the breath hissed
through his locked teeth. In a far land he had sought in vain for
the rituals of Zambebwei; now he looked upon them within forty
miles of the spot where he was born.</p>

<p>In the center of the glade the ground rose slightly to a flat
level. On this stood a heavy iron-bound stake that was indeed but
the sharpened trunk of a good-sized pine driven deep into the
ground. And there was something living chained to that
stake&mdash;something which caused McGrath to catch his breath in
horrified unbelief.</p>

<p>He was looking upon a god of Zambebwei. Stories had told of such
creatures, wild tales drifting down from the borders of the
forbidden country, repeated by shivering natives about jungle
fires, passed along until they reached the ears of skeptical white
traders. McGrath had never really believed the stories, though he
had gone searching for the being they described. For they spoke of
a beast that was a blasphemy against nature&mdash;a beast that
sought food strange to its natural species.</p>

<p>The thing chained to the stake was an ape, but such an ape as
the world at large never dreamed of, even in nightmares. Its shaggy
gray hair was shot with silver that shone in the rising moon; it
looked gigantic as it squatted ghoulishly on its haunches. Upright,
on its bent, gnarled legs, it would be as tall as a man, and much
broader and thicker. But its prehensile fingers were armed with
talons like those of a tiger&mdash;not the heavy blunt nails of the
natural anthropoid, but the cruel simitar-curved claws of the great
carnivora. Its face was like that of a gorilla, low browed,
flaring-nostriled, chinless; but when it snarled, its wide flat
nose wrinkled like that of a great cat, and the cavernous mouth
disclosed saber-like fangs, the fangs of a beast of prey. This was
Zemba, the creature sacred to the people of the land of
Zambebwei&mdash;a monstrosity, a violation of an accepted law of
nature&mdash;a carnivorous ape. Men had laughed at the story,
hunters and zoologists and traders.</p>

<p>But now McGrath knew that such creatures dwelt in black
Zambebwei and were worshipped, as primitive man is prone to worship
an obscenity or perversion of nature. Or a survival of past eons:
that was what the flesh-eating apes of Zambebwei
were&mdash;survivors of a forgotten epoch, remnants of a vanished
prehistoric age, when nature was experimenting with matter, and
life took many monstrous forms.</p>

<p>The sight of the monstrosity filled McGrath with revulsion; it
was abysmal, a reminder of that brutish and horror-shadowed past
out of which mankind crawled so painfully, eons ago. This thing was
an affront to sanity; it belonged in the dust of oblivion with the
dinosaur, the mastodon, and the saber-toothed tiger.</p>

<p>It looked massive beyond the stature of modern
beasts&mdash;shaped on the plan of another age, when all things
were cast in a mightier mold. He wondered if the revolver at his
hip would have any effect on it; wondered by what dark and subtle
means John De Albor had brought the monster from Zambebwei to the
pinelands.</p>

<p>But something was happening in the glade, heralded by the
shaking of the brute's chain as it thrust forward its
nightmare-head.</p>

<p><br>
From the shadows of the trees came a file of black men and women,
young, naked except for a mantle of monkeyskins and parrot-feathers
thrown over the shoulders of each. More regalia brought by John De
Albor, undoubtedly. They formed a semicircle at a safe distance
from the chained brute, and sank to their knees, bending their
heads to the ground before him. Thrice this motion was repeated.
Then, rising, they formed two lines, men and women facing one
another, and began to dance; at least it might by courtesy be
called a dance. They hardly moved their feet at all, but all other
parts of their bodies were in constant motion, twisting, rotating,
writhing. The measured, rhythmical movements had no connection at
all with the voodoo dances McGrath had witnessed. This dance was
disquietingly archaic in its suggestion, though even more depraved
and bestial&mdash;naked primitive passions framed in a cynical
debauchery of motion.</p>

<p>No sound came from the dancers, or from the votaries squatting
about the ring of trees. But the ape, apparently infuriated by the
continued movements, lifted his head and sent into the night the
frightful shriek McGrath had heard once before that day&mdash;he
had heard it in the hills that border black Zambebwei. The brute
plunged to the end of his heavy chain, foaming and gnashing his
fangs, and the dancers fled like spume blown before a gust of wind.
They scattered in all directions&mdash;and then McGrath started up
in his covert, barely stifling a cry.</p>

<p>From the deep shadows had come a figure, gleaming tawnily in
contrast to the black forms about it. It was John De Albor, naked
except for a mantle of bright feathers, and on his head a circlet
of gold that might have been forged in Atlantis. In his hand he
bore a gold wand that was the scepter of the high priests of
Zambebwei.</p>

<p>Behind him came a pitiful figure, at the sight of which the
moon-lit forest reeled to McGrath's sight.</p>

<p>Constance had been drugged. Her face was that of a sleep-walker;
she seemed not aware of her peril, or the fact that she was naked.
She walked like a robot, mechanically responding to the urge of the
cord tied about her white neck. The other end of that cord was in
John De Albor's hand, and he half led, half dragged her toward the
horror that squatted in the center of the glade. De Albor's face
was ashy in the moonlight that now flooded the glade with molten
silver. Sweat beaded his skin. His eyes gleamed with fear and
ruthless determination. And in a staggering instant McGrath knew
that the man had failed, that he had been unable to save Constance,
and that now, to save his own life from his suspicious followers,
he himself was dragging the girl to the gory sacrifice.</p>

<p>No vocal sound came from the votaries, but hissing intake of
breath sucked through thick lips, and the rows of black bodies
swayed like reeds in the wind. The great ape leaped up, his face a
slavering devil's mask; he howled with frightful eagerness,
gnashing his great fangs, that yearned to sink into that soft white
flesh, and the hot blood beneath. He surged against his chain, and
the stout post quivered. McGrath, in the bushes, stood frozen,
paralyzed by the imminence of horror. And then John De Albor
stepped behind the unresisting girl and gave her a powerful push
that sent her reeling forward to pitch headlong on the ground under
the monster's talons.</p>

<p>And simultaneously McGrath moved. His move was instinctive
rather than conscious. His .44 jumped into his hand and spoke, and
the great ape screamed like a man death-stricken and reeled,
clapping misshapen hands to its head.</p>

<p>An instant the throng crouched frozen, white eyes bulging, jaws
hanging slack. Then before any could move, the ape, blood gushing
from his head, wheeled, seized the chain in both hands and snapped
it with a wrench that twisted the heavy links apart as if they had
been paper.</p>

<p>John De Albor stood directly before the mad brute, paralyzed in
his tracks. Zemba roared and leaped, and the african went down
under him, disembowled by the razorlike talons, his head crushed to
a crimson pulp by a sweep of the great paw.</p>

<p>Ravening, the monster charged among the votaries, clawing and
ripping and smiting, screaming intolerably. Zambebwei spoke, and
death was in his bellowing. Screaming, howling, fighting, the black
people scrambled over one another in their mad flight. Men and
women went down under those shearing talons, were dismembered by
those gnashing fangs. It was a red drama of the
primitive&mdash;destruction amuck and ariot, the primordial
embodied in fangs and talons, gone mad and plunging in slaughter.
Blood and brains deluged the earth, black bodies and limbs and
fragments of bodies littered the moonlighted glade in ghastly heaps
before the last of the howling wretches found refuge among the
trees. The sounds of their blundering, panic-stricken flight
drifted back.</p>

<p><br>
McGrath had leaped from his covert almost as soon as he had fired.
Unnoticed by the terrified negroes, and himself scarcely cognizant
of the slaughter raging around him, he raced across the glade
toward the pitiful white figure that lay limply beside the
iron-bound stake.</p>

<p>"Constance!" he cried, gathering her to his breast.</p>

<p>Languidly she opened her cloudy eyes. He held her close,
heedless of the screams and devastation surging about them. Slowly
recognition grew in those lovely eyes.</p>

<p>"Bristol!" she murmured, incoherently. Then she screamed, clung
to him, sobbing hysterically. "Bristol! They told me you were dead!
The blacks! The horrible blacks! They're going to kill me! They
were going to kill De Albor too, but he promised to
sacrifice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, girl, don't!" He subdued her frantic tremblings. "It's
all right, now&mdash;" Abruptly he looked up into the grinning
bloodstained face of nightmare and death. The great ape had ceased
to rend his dead victims and was slinking toward the living pair in
the center of the glade. Blood oozed from the wound in its sloping
skull that had maddened it.</p>

<p>McGrath sprang toward it, shielding the prostrate girl; his
pistol spurted flame, pouring a stream of lead into the mighty
breast as the beast charged.</p>

<p>On it came, and his confidence waned. Bullet after bullet he
sent crashing into its vitals, but it did not halt. Now he dashed
the empty gun full into the gargoyle face without effect, and with
a lurch and a roll it had him in its grasp. As the giant arms
closed crushingly about him, he abandoned all hope, but following
his fighting instinct to the last, he drove his dagger hilt-deep in
the shaggy belly.</p>

<p>But even as he struck, he felt a shudder run through the
gigantic frame. The great arms fell away&mdash;and then he was
hurled to the ground in the last death throe of the monster, and
the thing was swaying, its face a death-mask. Dead on its feet, it
crumpled, toppled to the ground, quivered and lay still. Not even a
man-eating ape of Zambebwei could survive that close- range volley
of mushrooming lead.</p>

<p>As the man staggered up, Constance rose and reeled into his
arms, crying hysterically.</p>

<p>"It's all right <i>now</i>, Constance," he panted, crushing her
to him. "The Zemba's dead; De Albor's dead; Ballville's dead; the
negroes have run away. There's nothing to prevent us leaving now.
The Moon of Zambebwei was the end for them. But it's the beginning
of life for us."</p>
