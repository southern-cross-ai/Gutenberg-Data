<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>THE QUEENSFERRY MYSTERY</h2>

<p class="first">
SOME years ago a series of remarkable house burglaries took
place during the winter months in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh's
most beautiful suburb, Queensferry. Several of the large houses
there had been entered in a mysterious manner, and a great amount
of valuable property, consisting principally of plate and
jewellery, was carried off. As may be supposed, something like
consternation spread through the district, and very strong
complaints were made to the police, without producing material
results, however. Of course, steps were at once taken to try and
spot the gang, for it was believed to be a gang, who were working
their 'trade' so successfully; but no arrest was made, and no
explanations of the robberies were forthcoming. And more than that,
notwithstanding these inquiries, watchings, and waitings, they did
not even put a stop to the depredations. A Mr. M'Gowan, the
occupant of 'The Rowans,' complained that his house had been
entered and nearly a hundred pounds' worth of miscellaneous
jewellery carried off; Mrs. Gorst, a widow lady, living at
Islandview Lodge,' reported the loss of some very valuable old
silver which had been in her family for generations; Mrs. Wilfred
Read, of 'The Retreat,' was the poorer by a diamond necklet valued
at a hundred and fifty pounds; while Mr. John Nairn, of 'The
Rookery,' missed a presentation gold chronometer watch and a pearl
and diamond scarfpin.</p>

<p>These are mere samples of the numerous reports that reached the
police, and they serve to show how very serious the matter was. In
some cases windows or doors were forced, but this was rather the
exception than the rule, for things disappeared as if by magic, and
there was often no trace of any forcible entry into the premises
from whence the property had been taken.</p>

<p>Having regard to all the circumstances, it was perhaps in
accordance with a natural police law that the culprits, it was
expected, would be found among the ranks of the domestics in the
various houses; but though the usual methods adopted by the police
when servants are suspected were put into force, they failed to
obtain even the shadow of a clue.</p>

<p>At last a crisis was reached when a Mrs. Bertha Wylie made a
great outcry about the loss of a very valuable gold bracelet set
with diamonds and rubies&mdash;present from her father on the
morning of her marriage. It appeared that Mrs. Wylie had been
attending an 'At Home' at the house of a neighbour, where her
bracelet was the admiration of all. When she left she drove in a
cab to her own residence, and immediately went upstairs to her
bedroom, where she took off her bracelet and laid it on the
dressing-table while she washed her hands preparatory to joining
her husband at dinner. She was rather late, and he being a-hungered
was not in the best of tempers at having to wait, particularly as
he had brought a friend home to dine with him, so having hastily
arranged her hair and performed other little toilet details dear to
the heart of every woman she rushed downstairs to the dining-room,
forgetting all about the bracelet. Nor did she remember it until
the following morning when she rose. But a search on the toilet
table, on the floor, in her jewel case, and in possible and
impossible places did not bring the missing trinket to light. It
had gone, disappeared, vanished completely. Full of a great grief,
and with heavy heart, the lady made known her loss, and in
discussing the matter with a friend she said&mdash;</p>

<p>'You know, dear, valuable as the bracelet is, it is not so much
the mere value that affects me as the fact that dear papa gave it
to me the morning I married Tom.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Wylie was loud in her lamentations, and through the medium
of the newspapers, as well as by handbills exhibited in the shop
windows, she offered a reward of twenty pounds for the recovery of
the missing article.</p>

<p>This last robbery, so mysterious and audacious, aroused the
whole community, and the male representatives met together in the
house of a Mr. Scott, an Edinburgh lawyer, to discuss the situation
and see if something couldn't be done to bring the guilt home to
someone. The police had been baffled entirely, and the law-abiding
subjects felt that the time had come when they should take the
matter into their own hands. But notwithstanding that a good many
of Mr. Scott's cigars were smoked and a fair quantity of his
excellent whisky drunk, nothing practically was arrived at until
the host himself, who had remained unusually silent during the
discussion, on the principle, probably, that 'he who speaks last
speaks well,' put a suggestion before the meeting.</p>

<p>'Some time ago,' he said, 'I had to do with a very peculiar will
case, in which I was associated with the well-known London legal
firm of Fleming, Steel, &amp; Griffin, of Chancery Lane, and it
became necessary for us to engage the services of Tyler
Tatlock.'</p>

<p>'Who is Tyler Tatlock?' asked somebody.</p>

<p>'Well, he is a very remarkable man who carries on a private
detective agency in London, and I was informed that he was
considered to be without a rival.'</p>

<p>'Never heard of him,' remarked two or three persons
together.</p>

<p>'Possibly not, but he has earned a reputation. At any rate, in
the will case I instance he rendered invaluable service, and he
made a very deep impression upon me.</p>

<p>'What sort of a man is he?' asked some one.</p>

<p>'Do you mean mentally, physically, or what?'</p>

<p>'Generally.'</p>

<p>'Well, physically he is below medium height, but lithe as a
snake and tough as nails. He doesn't impress you at first sight. He
has a clean-shaven face. His features are rather small, and his
eyes are so small and deep-set that sometimes when he frowns you
would think he had no eyes at all. But I have never met a man yet
who saw so much with his eyes as Tatlock. He would discern a
microbe on the end of your nose.'</p>

<p>'I suppose what you are driving at, Scott,' said one of his
guests, 'is that we should get this marvel down here?'</p>

<p>'Precisely.'</p>

<p>'At whose cost?'</p>

<p>'Our own. I propose that we should make a whip round for his
fee, whatever it is. Those who have lost things will surely not
begrudge to give it. There is a chance of their property being
restored to them.'</p>

<p>'Well, I shall be willing to do my bit,' said one gentleman.</p>

<p>'And so will I.'</p>

<p>'And I.'</p>

<p>So the proposal was agreed to, it being understood that the
matter should be kept secret.</p>

<p>About a week later there entered Mr. Scott's office in Edinburgh
a little, somewhat sallow-faced man, with small black beady eyes,
somewhat scant black hair, a clean-shaven face that seemed to wear
an habitual expression of good humour, and a smooth, dulcet voice
that might have been taken for a woman's. He was neatly, but not
ostentatiously, dressed. This person was Tyler Tatlock, who would
have passed unnoticed in a crowd by the casual observer. But no man
who had the power to penetrate a little beneath the surface of the
human mask could have been in Tatlock's presence very long before
discovering that he was dealing with no ordinary person. The
mobility of the face, to begin with, was simply marvellous; and
then there was a strange, absolutely inexplicable magnetic
influence about him that, in spite of yourself, made you feel you
could at once take the little man into your confidence and tell him
the innermost secrets of your heart. He was so quiet, his voice was
so soft and insinuating, his manner so pleasant that he drew you
out against your will.</p>

<p>Tatlock had originally intended to become an analytical chemist,
and spent many years studying the science, when suddenly the true
bent of his mind was developed by some analytical work he was doing
in connection with a case of murder by poison. He thereupon
abandoned chemistry as a profession and became a detective, but not
without much study and preparation. He visited every capital in
Europe, made himself thoroughly conversant with the various police
systems; travelled extensively through India, China, Japan, and
other countries, including Brazil. During his wanderings he
acquired a wonderful knowledge of poisons, and at last returned
home fully equipped for the walk in life he elected to follow.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott, with lawyer-like precision, gave Tatlock a full
account of the Queensferry robberies. Tatlock listened attentively,
his small eyes seemingly hidden by a frown, the index finger of his
right hand on his temple, the elbow supported by the left hand; a
favourite attitude when he was absorbed.</p>

<p>'Of course,' said Mr. Scott, when he had finished his recital,
'no one save a few gentlemen in the Ferry knows that you are
here.'</p>

<p>'I am glad of that. A man has a much better chance of getting at
the bottom of an apparent mystery if no one suspects that he is
prowling about.'</p>

<p>A little later Tyler Tatlock went down to Queensferry to study
the lay of the land, and spent some hours in wandering about. He
strolled into a spirit merchant's shop for a dram in the course of
the afternoon, and had a chat with the man who served the drink,
and incidentally touched on the burning question of the hour in
that neighbourhood&mdash;the robberies.</p>

<p>'I suppose you've heard a' aboot the thefts,' remarked the
publican.</p>

<p>'Well, I've heard something, but one never knows what to
believe.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'm of opinion that the servants in the different hooses
are at the bottom of the whole business.'</p>

<p>'I can't think that.'</p>

<p>'Weel noo' tak' the case o' Mistress Wylie, a bonnie young woman
but newly marrit. She pits her bracelet on her dressing-table after
making a call on some friends. She forgets a' aboot it when she
gangs tae her dinner, and the next day there's nae signs o'
it.'</p>

<p>'But was the house not broken into?'</p>

<p>'Na, na.'</p>

<p>'Well, on the face of it it does look as though the servants had
had something to do with that robbery. How many does she keep?'</p>

<p>'Twa, I think.'</p>

<p>'Has she lived here long?'</p>

<p>'Na, aboot sax months.'</p>

<p>'Where does she come from?'</p>

<p>I've heard say she was born here in the Ferry, but went south
with her parents when she was a wee lassie. Her husband's an
Edinburgh man, but I understand he has been living in France or
somewhere on the Continent.'</p>

<p>'What does he do?'</p>

<p>'I'm no sure that lie has any trade. Any way I've not heard that
he does anything. I'm perfectly sure he doesna gang to Edinburgh
every day like most of the folk hereabouts.'</p>

<p>At this point the loquacious publican was called off to serve
and pass the time of day with some other customer. So Tatlock
finished his liquor and went out, and returned to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Two or three days later a curious-looking little old country
woman called at Mrs. Wylie's house at Queensferry, and asked to see
Mrs. Wylie herself. She was requested to state her business, but
declined, simply saying she wished to see the mistress on a very
important matter. Presently she was invited to enter the
breakfast-room, and having been kept waiting nearly half-an-hour
Mrs. Wylie put in an appearance.</p>

<p>A very pretty little blonde woman with golden hair, blue eyes,
and a sweet, baby face, but somewhat fussy manner.</p>

<p>'What do you want with me, my good woman?'</p>

<p>I've heard tell that you're offering a reward of twenty pounds
for the recovery of a bracelet that was stolen from you.</p>

<p>'Yes, that is right.'</p>

<p>'I suppose there is no fear but the money would be paid if you
got information?'</p>

<p>'Why, of course it would be paid.'</p>

<p>'Is the master in?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Could I see him?'</p>

<p>'No, I don't think you can. He's not up yet. He didn't go to bed
till very late. But what do you want to see him for?'</p>

<p>'Well, mistress, you see I'm a woman, and&mdash;don't be angry
with me&mdash;but I've no great faith in my own sex when it comes
to a matter of business.'</p>

<p>'You are certainly not complimentary,' remarked Mrs. Wylie
sharply.</p>

<p>'I hope I haven't offended you, Mistress Wylie,' said the woman
apologetically.</p>

<p>'But you have.'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry for it, but I thought it would be more satisfaction
to me if your husband would just give me a bit paper promising to
pay the twenty pounds if the bracelet is found.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you can trust me,' said the lady haughtily, 'but I don't
believe you know anything about the bracelet.'</p>

<p>'What makes you think that?'</p>

<p>'Two or three things. Can you describe it now?'</p>

<p>'The funny little old woman fumbled about her clothes, and at
last produced from an inner pocket one of the hand-bills offering
the reward and describing the article.</p>

<p>'I get my description from that,' she said.</p>

<p>'Oh, that's all right; but where have you seen the
bracelet?'</p>

<p>'I didn't say I had seen it.'</p>

<p>'But you evidently know something about it.'</p>

<p>'No, I've only heard some folk talking.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Wylie laughed heartily as she said:</p>

<p>'Well, you are a comical sort of person, upon my word. What's
the use of you coining here unless you can help me to recover my
property?'</p>

<p>'You see, m'm, I'm a poor body, and twenty pounds would be a
fortune to me; so I thought I would come and tell you what I've
heard.'</p>

<p>'What have you heard?'</p>

<p>'I heard a neighbour of mine say she was in a pawn-shop on
Saturday night getting out her man's duds for the Sabbath, when a
man came in and offered a bracelet in pawn, and my neighbour vows
from what she could see of it it was your bracelet.'</p>

<p>'And was it pawned?' asked the lady quickly.</p>

<p>'Oh, ay.'</p>

<p>'Well, you see, it could hardly be mine, because every
pawnbroker in Scotland has had a description of the bracelet, so no
one would be likely to lend money on it.'</p>

<p>The country woman looked rather chapfallen as she remarked:</p>

<p>'Ma certes! I didn't think of that. Ah, well, just forgive me
for calling on you. I was keen to get that twenty pounds, and I
thought I'd give you the information.'</p>

<p>The old woman took herself off, and in the course of the day
Mrs. Bertha Wylie, elegantly dressed, wearing a real sealskin
jacket and carrying a sealskin muff, called on a lady friend, a
Mrs. Smith, who resided in the Ferry, and over the tea and cakes
she told her about the old woman calling on her.</p>

<p>'Well, to be sure, what a stupid creature!' exclaimed Mrs.
Smith. 'Whatever could have been her object!'</p>

<p>'I suppose she thought I should give her something; but I wasn't
quite such a fool as she fancied I was.'</p>

<p>'I wonder,' remarked Mrs. Smith thoughtfully, 'if she is
connected in any way with the mysterious thieves who have been
committing all these robberies?'</p>

<p>'I wonder,' echoed the pretty little blonde lady, arranging the
dainty mass of flimsy tulle that encircled her white throat as she
stood before the mirror over the drawing-room mantelpiece.</p>

<p>'I shouldn't think you are ever likely to get the bracelet
back,' pursued Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p>'No, I don't think there's the slightest chance; but there's no
use crying over spilt milk. Tom must buy me another bracelet;
that's all.'</p>

<p>'You are more philosophical than I should be,' remarked Mrs.
Smith with considerable emphasis.</p>

<p>'It's a good thing to be philosophical, dear.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps it is, but I hope I shan't be called upon to exercise
my philosophy for the same cause as you.'</p>

<p>'I hope not, but one never knows. It may be your turn next. The
thieves&mdash;whoever they are&mdash;seem to be pretty impartial,
and apparently all's fish that comes to their net.'</p>

<p>The subject having been exhausted, the ladies turned to a more
agreeable one, and discussed dress. Mrs. Smith admired her friend's
sealskin jacket, and, with a woman's privilege, inquired what was
the cost of it.</p>

<p>'Oh, not very much,' answered the wearer. 'About a hundred and
fifty pounds I think Tom gave for it.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith sighed as she confessed sadly that her lord and
master was not likely to indulge her in such a piece of
extravagance. The pleasant little interview having terminated, the
ladies kissed each other lovingly and parted, as Mrs. Wylie had
another social call to make previous to returning home.</p>

<p>About a week from that date Mr. and Mrs. Smith went up to
Edinburgh to the theatre, leaving their two children, their nurse,
a cook, and housemaid at home, though the cook had permission to go
out for a couple of hours. Mr. Smith was a jeweller in Edinburgh,
and carried on a large business. He had three shops, the principal
one being in Princes Street. He and his wife gave orders to the
servants to see that all the doors were locked and everything safe
before they went to bed.</p>

<p>The cook left the house a little before eight, soon after her
master and mistress had gone, and she was to be back not later than
ten, the housemaid and nurse undertaking to sit up for her. During
her absence the two young women, having seen all the doors secured
below, went upstairs to the nursery, where a cheerful fire blazed,
and it was only when they heard the bell ring, announcing the
cook's return, that they descended together&mdash;brave women as
they were&mdash;and let her in. The three of them partook of supper
in the kitchen, and retired to bed almost on the stroke of eleven.
An hour later Mr. and Mrs. Smith returned home, had a hasty supper,
and retired also, the lady glancing in at the nursery to see that
her pets were snug and comfortable in bed.</p>

<p>The following morning Mr. Smith went off, as usual, to his
business at half-past eight, and later in the forenoon Mrs. Smith
made the alarming discovery that nearly all her jewellery had
disappeared, together with about fifty silver spoons, forks, and
two small silver dishes. Without making her loss known to the
household, she hastily attired herself, and rushed off to Edinburgh
to inform her husband. Now, it chanced that Mr. Smith was one of
the gentlemen who had on a recent occasion assembled at Mr. Scott's
when it was decided to secure the services of Tyler Tatlock; but,
in accordance with the arrangement then come to, he had not told
his wife, nor did he do so now. He merely requested her to make out
a list, and give information at the Central Police Station, and ask
them to send one of their men down to investigate the matter. He
said he was not able to get away himself then, as he was very busy,
but he would be home as soon as possible. An hour after his wife
had left him Mr. Smith made his way to Mr. Scott's office.</p>

<p>'I say, what's that man of yours about?' he asked in a tone that
indicated he was by no means pleased.</p>

<p>'What man?'</p>

<p>'Why, the brilliant detective who was to do such wonders for
us.'</p>

<p>'I really don't know. I haven't seen him for some days.'</p>

<p>'Well, shunt him.'</p>

<p>'Why, what's wrong?'</p>

<p>'Everything.'</p>

<p>'You don't mean to say you've been robbed?'</p>

<p>'I do.'</p>

<p>'When?'</p>

<p>'Last night. Mrs. Smith and I came up to the theatre, and during
our absence there's been a fine haul made.' Here Mr. Smith laid a
list of the missing articles before his legal friend. 'Now look at
that. What do you think of it? A nice state of matters, isn't
it?'</p>

<p>'It's most remarkable,' said the lawyer, musingly.</p>

<p>'Yes, but what I want to say is that that fellow Tatlock is no
good.'</p>

<p>'I shouldn't be too hasty in condemning him. Let's put him on
his defence first,' suggested Mr. Scott.</p>

<p>'But he condemns himself. The fellow's been here getting on for
a fortnight, and has done nothing. What is more, the mysterious
thief has committed a robbery under his very nose, so to speak, and
yet he can't see him. Why, I'd do better myself as a
detective.'</p>

<p>Soon after Mr. Smith had taken his departure Mr. Scott sent a
note over to Philp's Cockburn Hotel, asking Tatlock to come across
and see him; but word was brought back that Mr. Tatlock had been
absent for two days, and when he went off did not leave word when
he would be back.</p>

<p>The next morning Tyler Tatlock put in an appearance at Mr.
Scott's office soon after that gentleman arrived.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry I was away yesterday when you sent your note
across.'</p>

<p>'You've been enjoying yourself,' suggested the lawyer with a
smile.</p>

<p>'Yes, very much. A little recreation at times does no one any
harm, does it?'</p>

<p>'No, certainly not. But to be serious now, have you got hold of
any clue?'</p>

<p>'I would rather not answer that question at present.'</p>

<p>'Good. I am a lawyer and appreciate your caution. Probably you
will not have heard yet of the robbery at the private residence of
Mr. Smith, the jeweller, who lives at Queensferry?'</p>

<p>Tatlock smiled.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, I have,' he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott smiled also. It was a smile of self-satisfaction. He
felt absolutely convinced now that he was not mistaken in his
estimate of Tatlock.</p>

<p>'I don't want to force your hand,' he remarked, 'but your smile
is significant. It is a smile of meaning. You are not without some
clue, I fancy.'</p>

<p>Tatlock smiled again, and turned the conversation.</p>

<p>'Now for a little announcement,' said he. 'I am leaving
Edinburgh to-night. How long I shall be absent I really cannot
tell, but I shall return, and when I do I shall probably be able to
supply you with reliable and valuable information.'</p>

<p>'That satisfies me,' answered the lawyer; and on this the two
men parted, and in the course of the evening he saw some of his
neighbours who were in the secret about Tatlock, and to them he
said, in order to reassure them:</p>

<p>'I think Tatlock's all right. He has left Edinburgh, but will be
back again before very long, I expect, and when he again appears on
the scene he may have something to tell you.'</p>

<p>That night a tall, handsome man, wearing a costly, fur-lined coat
and dainty kid gloves, entered the refreshment room at the Waverley
Station, Edinburgh, in company with a lady, young and pretty. They
partook of some refreshment, then went on to the platform, which
was swept by a fierce snow-laden wind, for it was a bitter night,
with all the sting of winter in it. The gentleman kissed the lady
affectionately, and they parted. She went one way, and he hurried
to the Great Northern London train, which in another few minutes
would be speeding on its way to the South. At the door of a
first-class compartment stood an obsequious porter. He had already
deposited two hand-bags belonging to the gentleman in the rack of
the compartment, and, as he of the fur-lined coat appeared, the
porter touched his cap.</p>

<p>'I've pit a' your things in, sir, and there's a guid hot footpan
for ye.'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' answered the gentleman curtly, as he dropped a
silver coin into the eager, outstretched palm, and entered the
compartment, exchanged his highly polished silk hat for a
travelling cap, ensconced himself comfortably in a corner, and
enveloped the lower part of his body in a handsome rug, drew off
his dainty gloves, selected a cigar from his case, and lit
it&mdash;it was a smoking compartment. Then the guard's shrill
whistle sounded, there was a snort, puff, and jerk, and the night
mail began its journey.</p>

<p>There was only one other passenger in the compartment, a little
old man, wearing a skull cap over his snow-white hair. He was
warmly clad, and had a heavy rug across his knees.</p>

<p>'It's a bitter night,' he remarked to his fellow passenger.</p>

<p>'Yes, awful. Are you travelling far?'</p>

<p>'To London. And you?'</p>

<p>'To London also.'</p>

<p>'We had better give the guard a wink at the next stopping-place,
and ask him to keep the compartment for us, and we shall be able to
stretch out; not that I think there is much fear of being
overcrowded on a night like this.'</p>

<p>'No, I fancy not. It's a pretty empty train as it is. Do you
smoke?' asked the young man.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Allow me to offer you a cigar. I can recommend those. They're a
favourite brand with the Rothschilds.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, they look good, and smell good. I have matches,
thanks. Yes! your recommendation is justified. It's an excellent
smoke. I suppose you've seen the papers?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes.'</p>

<p>'Do you care to look at the 'Times'?'</p>

<p>'No, thank you. The light's not good enough.'</p>

<p>Thus these fellow-travellers on that winter night exchanged the
commonplace civilities peculiar to the situation until the
inevitable drowsiness which night travelling superinduces lulled
them to silence, which lasted until Carlisle was reached.</p>

<p>'Well, I think we can settle down for the night now,' remarked
the tall gentleman, as the train began to move out of the station
on its long run to York.</p>

<p>The old man agreed with this, and each prepared a comfortable
bed with rugs and wraps on the seats, and then stretched himself
out for sleep, the shade over the lamp and the curtains at the
windows having been drawn. The compartment was cosy and warm,
outside snow was falling heavily. The train thundered on through
the night. The travellers slept. Nearly an hour passed. The train
was flying through the darkness at the rate of fifty miles an hour.
Presently the little old man raised his head very cautiously, and
glanced towards his fellow-passenger, who was lying on his back,
his lips slightly apart, and testifying by nasal evidence that he
slept. The little old man gradually and silently sat bolt upright,
and drew from his pocket a tiny metal flask, with about three
inches of india-rubber tubing and hollow ball attached. He advanced
the flask close to the sleeper's mouth and nostrils, gently
squeezed the ball, and, without the slightest hissing or noise of
any kind, there issued from the tiny nozzle a thin, bluish vapour.
With the first inhalation of this vapour the sleeper gave a start
and a gasp, then he became perfectly still, and lay rigid like a
marble statue. Having assured himself that his fellow-traveller was
fully under the influence of the vapour, the old man lifted the
traveller's bags from the rack, and deliberately proceeded to open
them with keys he drew from his pocket. He carefully examined the
contents of the bags, but took nothing out. Having satisfied his
curiosity, he closed the bags again, and restored them to the rack.
He next felt the pulse of the sleeper, and, being apparently
satisfied that all was well, he rolled himself in his rugs again,
and went to sleep.</p>

<p>The tall gentleman awoke just as the train reached York. He
seemed all right, and exactly like a man who awakens from a sound,
refreshing, and health-giving sleep. He glanced at his
fellow-traveller, who was buried in his rugs and motionless. He
really was asleep. The gentleman rose and stretched himself as the
guard opened the door, and announced there were twenty minutes
allowed at York. Snow was falling heavily. The temperature was low
enough to freeze one's marrow. The gentleman, who was suffering
from a vacuum, buttoned up his fur coat, hurried to the
refreshment-room, and made a substantial meal of cold ham and
chicken and hot coffee. He returned to his carriage refreshed and
strengthened, and lit up another of his excellent cigars.</p>

<p>The little old man still slept.</p>

<p>The rest of the journey passed without incident.</p>

<p>London was reached in gloom, fog, and snow. Our two travellers
began to gather up their traps a few minutes before the train drew
up in King's Cross Station.</p>

<p>'May I inquire if you are going to stay at an hotel? asked the
little old man in the blandest possible manner, as he exchanged his
skull-cap for a silk hat, and wound a muffler about his throat.</p>

<p>'Yes; at the Holborn Viaduct.'</p>

<p>'Can you recommend it?'</p>

<p>'Most thoroughly. I always stay there, as I generally have
business in Paris, and it's so handy for the Chatham and Dover
train, you know.'</p>

<p>'Are you going to Paris to-night?'</p>

<p>No; to-morrow night.'</p>

<p>'I don't know that I envy you your journey this weather.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm used to it.'</p>

<p>'Well, we may meet again, as on your recommendation I shall put
up at the Viaduct. Good-morning.'</p>

<p>The following day the tall, handsome gentleman who had travelled
up from Edinburgh on the previous night sat at breakfast in the
well-lighted, well-warmed breakfast-room of his hotel. He had the
appearance of one who had no care on his mind, and was at peace
with all the world. His fair moustache was daintily trimmed, his
hair well brushed, his hands were white and beringed, his nails
polished and faultless. He finished his breakfast, tossed aside the
'Times' with which he had beguiled himself during the meal, glanced
admiringly at himself in the mirror, and went out. When he reached
the lobby two men were standing there. One touched him on the
shoulder, and spoke something in his ear which caused him to start
and turn deadly pale. As he seemed disposed to try conclusions with
the two men, the other seized him and very adroitly and dexterously
clapped a pair of handcuffs on his wrists.</p>

<p>'This outrage will cost you dear,' he said between his set,
gleaming teeth.</p>

<p>The two men did not seem to be disturbed by the menace. One said
You had better not make a scene, Mr. Jordon.'</p>

<p>'Remove these signs of infamy, then,' said the gentleman
addressed as Jordon, and indicating the handcuffs.</p>

<p>'No. We can't do that. We know your desperate character.'</p>

<p>Mr. Jordon smiled bitterly, but made no answer. In obedience to
the request of his captors he walked quietly down the stairs, a man
on either side of him. A waiter was ordered to go to the
gentleman's room and bring his hat for him. While that was being
done a four-wheeler was summoned, and a few minutes later Mr.
Jordon, white-faced and savage-looking, was being driven to Bow
Street.</p>

<p>Three days after that peculiarly dramatic little scene at the
Holborn Viaduct Hotel a scene scarcely less dramatic was being
enacted in Edinburgh. A cab drew up at the door of Mr. Wylie's
house at Queensferry. There were two men in the cab. One alighted,
knocked at the door, and was admitted by a servant, the other man
remaining in the cab. Fully three-quarters of an hour passed before
the man who had entered the house reappeared. He was accompanied by
pretty little Mrs. Wylie, who wore a thick veil over her face. She
entered the cab, followed by the man, and the cab at once drove off
to Edinburgh, where the two men&mdash;plain-clothes
policemen&mdash;delivered their capture, pretty, blonde-haired,
blue-eyed Mrs. Wylie, to the police authorities.</p>

<p>That afternoon Tyler Tatlock entered Mr. Scott's office. 'Well,'
he said carelessly, as he toyed with a cigar he was smoking,
'there'll be no more robberies at the Ferry&mdash;at least, for
some time.'</p>

<p>'Oh! What, have you made a capture?'</p>

<p>'Two.'</p>

<p>'Who are they?'</p>

<p>'One is Mr. Joseph Jordon, ex-convict, alias Samuel Turner,
alias Richard Graham, alias Tom Wylie, and his charming little
fair-haired wife.'</p>

<p>Mr. Scott fell back in his chair with amazement.</p>

<p>'What! Tom Wylie and his wife the thieves?'</p>

<p>'Yes; funny, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'How did you ferret the business out?'</p>

<p>'By instinct. Inquiry led me to suspect Mrs. Wylie as the
jackal. I visited her to inquire about the reward she had offered
for the bracelet she averred she had lost. Of course, she never
lost it. She made the announcement to throw people off the scent.
My interview with her convinced me she was guilty. I watched her
husband. When I disappeared for a few days, to the annoyance of
your friends, I had followed him to Glasgow, where he had put up at
the St. Enoch's Hotel, and met a man from London, whom I happened
to know was one of the cleverest forgers in London, and an expert
swell-mobsman. I found out&mdash;never mind how&mdash;that is my
affair&mdash;that the two were in partnership of some kind, and had
an agency in Paris for the disposal of stolen property. The swell
was going north on business, but, as I was not concerned with him,
I gave the police a hint, returned to Edinburgh with Wylie, and a
day or two later travelled with him to London, opened his bags, and
found them stuffed with the proceeds of the Ferry robberies, which
he was conveying to Paris. Of course, I stopped his little
game.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;you&mdash;do amaze me!' exclaimed Mr. Scott. 'But
how on earth were the robberies managed?'</p>

<p>'On a very simple plan. Mrs. Wylie, charming little woman she
is, but as dangerous as they make 'em, won the confidence of her
victims&mdash;studied their houses, ascertained where the valuables
were kept, knew when the heads of the household were likely to be
absent; and, having performed all this scouting work with skill and
adroitness, carried the information to her husband. There is hardly
a door or window that man cannot open without leaving any trace
behind. This, of course, at once threw suspicion on servants.
Artful, wasn't it?'</p>

<p>'But who is this Wylie?'</p>

<p>'Joseph Jordon, only son of the late Joseph John Jordon,
colliery proprietor and iron master, of Stockton-on-Tees. He left
his son, who had been highly educated, a fortune. The son made
ducks and drakes of it on the Turf. Then he associated himself with
swell-mobsmen and blacklegs. He was arrested in connection with a
forgery, and put in five years at Dartmoor. On his release he
married a Miss Jennie Gramont, who had been keeping body and soul
together by teaching. Jordon is one of the most plausible and
polished scoundrels in the business, and he soon educated his wife
up to his own business. However, we have them by the heels. Funny
little story, isn't it? Very human, though. The police-court
proceedings will be interesting. Jordon, of course, will be brought
north. It is to be hoped your judges won't err on the side of
leniency. Well, ta-ta; look me up when you are in London. I must
leave Edinburgh to-night, as I have pressing business demanding my
attention.'</p>

<p class="footnote">NOTE.&mdash;Any chemist reading the foregoing
story will know the nature of the vapour used by Mr. Tatlock in the
railway carriage to ensure Jordon sleeping long enough to enable
the bags to be examined, This vapour produces a sort of stupor
which may last from fifteen minutes to an hour. Its administration
is not unattended with risk, though when the sleeper awakes he
feels refreshed and lively, but some time afterwards violent
headache is apt to ensue, though it speedily passes off under
ordinary circumstances. It must be remembered that Mr. Tatlock was
a chemist, and thoroughly understood the use and nature of
drugs.</p>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>THE CLUE OF THE SILVER JUG</h2>

<p class="first">
I HAD occasion one morning to call on Tatlock at his chambers on
a matter of business in which we were jointly engaged. Having spent
an hour with him, and discussed the subject of my visit, I was
about to take my departure, when he pushed a box of cigars towards
me, inviting me to help myself, and as he lit his he remarked:</p>

<p>'By the way, that's rather a curious case at Flaxton, isn't
it?'</p>

<p>'What case is that?' I asked, not knowing what he referred
to.</p>

<p>'Oh, haven't you heard of it. Here, read that,' and he tossed a
copy of the 'Standard' to me, in which he had marked with a blue
pencil the following paragraph:</p>
<br>

<p class="headline">
MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF MR. GEORGE GRAVELING&mdash;SUPPOSED SUICIDE.</p>

<p class="quote">
Early on Friday morning last a gamekeeper in the service of Sir
John Sterling of Flaxton was crossing the wild moorland which
stretches between that place and Hutton, on the line of railway
between York and Scarborough, when he came across the dead body of
a well-dressed man lying in a little hollow that was partly
concealed by heather and bracken. The gamekeeper's attention was
attracted by a flock of crows hovering over the spot, and evidently
greatly excited about something. Thinking there might be a disabled
sheep lying there, he approached the spot, and to his horror saw
the body of a man lying on its back at the bottom of a basin-like
depression. Having satisfied himself that the man was dead, the
gamekeeper hurried back to Flaxton, a distance of four miles, and
informed his master, Sir John Sterling, of what he had seen. Sir
John lost no time in giving information to the police, and in
company with a small body of the rural constabulary he drove over
to the place where the gamekeeper had seen the body lying. They
took a country cart with them, with a layer of straw at the bottom.
On this the body was laid, and conveyed to Flaxton, where the
identity of the deceased was at once established by means of
letters and cards in his pocket. The body proved to be that of Mr.
George Graveling, the well-known bookmaker, of Glasgow and London.
A considerable amount of valuable property was found in the
pockets, including a gold watch and chain, a massive gold pencil
case, nearly fifteen pounds in gold, and about twenty pounds in
Scotch bank-notes. It appears that Mr. Graveling had travelled from
Glasgow to York to attend the York races two days previously to his
body being discovered on the moor. He was apparently in the best of
health and spirits, and he was known to have won a very large sum
of money at the York meeting. He was supposed to have returned to
Glasgow the same night, and how he came to his death in the lonely
spot where his body was found is at present a mystery, which no
doubt the coroner's inquest will be able to clear up.</p>

<p><br>
'Yes,' I remarked, as I finished reading the item of news, 'yes,
it's rather a curious business.'</p>

<p>'I am going down to the inquest,' said Tatlock, in the
apparently unconcerned way in which he usually spoke. 'Sir John
Sterling has wired to me asking me to attend.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Don't know,' answered Tatlock, shrugging his shoulders, and
puffing out a great volume of smoke from his mouth. 'Foul play
suspected, I suppose.'</p>

<p>'When do you go?'</p>

<p>'To-night. The inquest is to be held to-morrow.'</p>

<p>The foregoing is the prologue, so to speak, to as remarkable a
crime as the annals of evil-doing can furnish us with, and the
particulars of the case I now give from Tatlock's own notes and
papers.</p>

<p>The external medical examination of the body failed to reveal
any cause of death, but an autopsy made it clear that the deceased
had died from poison, and that poison diluted oxalic acid, although
there were traces of laudanum detected. The evidence given at the
inquest brought out the following facts: Mr. Graveling was a
wealthy man, and greatly respected. He was noted for his generous
liberality and kindly disposition. He was in the habit of attending
most of the great race meetings throughout the country. He left
Glasgow on the Wednesday night preceding his death, travelled to
York, and was present at the races. He dined with some friends at
an hotel in York, but left them early, saying he was going to make
a call in the town, and intended to get the down train to Glasgow.
From that hour to the discovery of his body on the moor the
following morning his movements were shrouded in mystery. The spot
where he was found was about eight miles from York and two from
Flaxton, a station on the direct line of railway between York and
Scarborough. It was obvious, therefore, that he could not have
travelled by the Scottish train. Had it not been for the mere
chance of Sir John Sterling's gamekeeper crossing the moor, and
having his curiosity aroused by the crows, the body might have lain
undiscovered for months, possibly years.</p>

<p>Had his money and other property been taken from him a motive
for crime would have been established, but though several of those
who were at the races with him declared that he had a very large
sum in his possession when he left the course, no evidence was
forthcoming to show, if that was the case, what he had done with
it. He did not keep a banking account in York.</p>

<p>There was one other item found amongst the effects in his
pocket, and a very significant item it was, being nothing more nor
less than a glass-stoppered two-ounce phial, which had contained
oxalic acid. It was in the breast pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, the most exhaustive inquiries were made with
a view to determining the source from whence the poison had been
obtained, and for this purpose the inquest was adjourned from week
to week for three weeks. But the mystery could not be cleared up.
In the end there seem to have been divided opinions as to how the
deceased came by his death, and this verdict was returned:</p>

<p>That the deceased, George Graveling, met his death from a dose
of oxalic acid, but there was no evidence to show whether the fatal
dose was administered by his own hand, or the hand of another
person.'</p>

<p>This, of course, was practically an open verdict, and its
tendency was to make the mystery more mysterious. It should be
mentioned that amongst the general public there were not many who
did not favour the suicide theory. In the minority, however, were
numbered a few old and staunch friends of the deceased, who,
feeling convinced that George Graveling was not the man to have
taken his own life, instructed Tyler Tatlock to try and solve the
problem. To these friends the circumstances of the tragedy called
for a deeper and more crucial examination than the coroner's
inquest had afforded. Tatlock himself had declined to express any
open opinion at the time; but in a private letter he wrote to me
after the verdict he referred casually to it in these words:</p>

<p>By the way, the verdict in the Graveling case couldn't have been
other than it was, though I hear that the coroner himself and some
of the jury favoured suicide. But Graveling did not commit suicide.
He was murdered.'</p>

<p>It appeared that when Tatlock arrived in Flaxton, the village
where the inquest was held, he lost no time in proceeding to the
spot where the body was found. It was a wild, lonely, desolate
region. If Graveling wanted to kill himself why did he go to such
an out-of-the-way place? It was proved by the medical evidence that
he could not have taken the poison first, and have walked to the
pit afterwards, inasmuch as the effects of the dose would be to
almost immediately paralyse the heart and brain.</p>

<p>Tatlock did not find much to help him, but an examination of the
dead man's clothes, which he was permitted to make, revealed the
fact that the soles of the boots worn by Graveling were clean; that
is, they bore no trace of the black, loamy soil of the moor.
Strangely enough, neither coroner, jury, nor witnesses attached
much, if any, importance to this remarkable fact; but Tatlock did.
The back of the deceased's coat was much stained with the boggy
earth, but the front part of the clothes were not soiled in any
way. Had he drunk the poison first, and staggered to the pit, he
would in all human probability have pitched on to his face or
knees, but there was no sign of his having done this. Another
peculiar feature was that Tatlock could discover no trace of the
deceased's footprints anywhere about the pit where he was
found.</p>

<p>Tatlock did not visit the moor again until after the coroner's
verdict. His second visit was unpremeditated. He had had some
drawings made of the footprints, and he wished to verify some minor
point. He descended into the hollow where the body had been found,
without, as he himself says, any particular reason for so doing.
When about to leave the place his attention was attracted to
some-thing with a metallic lustre, half hidden in a tuft of
heather. He picked it up, and to his astonishment found it was a
small silver cream-jug, very much tarnished and discoloured, while
the inside and the spout bore signs of having been corroded by
acid. Had it not been for the established fact that the deceased
had died from oxalic acid poison, this corrosion of the jug might
have passed almost unnoticed, but under the circumstances it was a
natural conclusion to come to that the jug had contained some or
all of the fiery acid which had found its way into Mr. Graveling's
stomach.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Tatlock considered this discovery as of great
importance, and as likely to afford him a clue to the unravelling
of the mystery. The jug, which was 'hall-marked' as silver, weighed
about four ounces, and was of a very ordinary pattern. On the
bottom the initials 'S. H.' had been roughly scratched&mdash;with
the point of a knife probably.</p>

<p>For three months, in spite of many other calls upon his time and
attention, Tatlock did not relax his vigilance or cease to exercise
his talents in the Graveling case. He had all the tenacity of a
barnacle. He clung to what he attached himself to, and could not be
easily shaken off Nor did his vigilance in this case go unrewarded,
for he made an important and startling discovery.</p>

<p>In one of the byeways of the city of York there was situated a
shop where a fairly flourishing business was carried on in
second-hand goods of a miscellaneous character. The interior of the
shop was stuffed full of assorted lumber in keeping with the
display in the window. Over the door a signboard set forth that the
proprietrix of the shop was Selina Howells. One afternoon a man
entered this shop&mdash;a seedy-looking little man, with a general
woebegone, down-at-the-heel, empty-pocket appearance about him. He
carried a bundle with him. A woman was busy behind the counter
ticketing some goods that were to go into the window.</p>

<p>'What can I do for you, my man?' she asked, looking up as the
stranger entered.</p>

<p>'I've got summat to sell, missus,' he answered as he produced an
accordion.</p>

<p>'Anything else?' A few well-worn white shirts were displayed,
and some electro-plated spoons and forks the worse for wear, and
lastly a metal cream jug. The woman's attention was arrested by the
latter article. She took it up quickly, carried it to the window,
where there was a better light, flipped it with her finger-nail,
examined it carefully inside and out, and, turning at last to the
man, remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>'This is silver.'</p>

<p>'Is it?' he said in astonishment.</p>

<p>'Yes. What did you think it was?'</p>

<p>'Electro.'</p>

<p>'Where did you get it from?' she asked, eyeing him
curiously.</p>

<p>'Found it.'</p>

<p>'Where did you find it?'</p>

<p>'On Flaxton Moor.'</p>

<p>The woman walked to the end of the shop, carrying the silver jug
with her, opened a half-glazed door, and disappeared into a room,
where a man was sitting smoking a pipe. She was absent quite ten
minutes. When she returned to the shop she told the customer she
would give him two pounds for the things.</p>

<p>'No, mum,' he answered decisively. 'If that jug's worth two
pound to you it's worth that to me, and maybe more, and so I'll
keep it.'</p>

<p>'Well, you're a fool; that's all I've got to say,' snapped the
woman angrily, as she banged the article down on the counter before
him. 'Why, it's not worth five shillings. It's been burnt inside
with something, for one thing.'</p>

<p>'Missus,' said the man, eyeing her keenly as he took the jug up,
'if I can't get more'n that for it somewhere else I'll come back to
you and you shall have it,' and with a brusque 'Good day' walked
out of the shop.</p>

<p>About a week after this little incident two men entered Mrs.
Selina Howells' shop, bent on much more serious business than that
of either selling or buying. They inquired if her husband was at
home, and on being answered in the affirmative they expressed a
desire to see him. The lady was naturally curious to know what
their errand was, and on their declining to enlighten her she said
that under these circumstances they could not see him. On that one
of the men went to the shop door and called in a third man, who was
ordered to remain in the shop while the other two searched the
house. Mrs. Howells stormed and raved, and seemed very indignant,
describing the conduct of the men as an outrage, and demanding to
know what it meant. She was told she would know in good time, and
thereupon the two men went into the back room, and thence upstairs,
the hour being eleven o'clock in the morning. They found Mr.
Howells in bed, and they at once declared themselves as police
officers, and showed him a warrant for his arrest on suspicion of
his being concerned in the death of George Graveling, and they bade
him dress himself.</p>

<p>Richard Howells was an enormous man between thirty and forty
years of age. He stood six feet three, and had the muscles and
power of a Hercules. When he recognised that he was trapped he
sprang out of bed, and his whole manner seemed to indicate
mischief, but one of the officers whipped a revolver from his
pocket and said quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>'You had better dress yourself quickly, Mr. Howells.'</p>

<p>Mr. Howells thought better of his resolve, whatever it was, and
sullenly and silently donned his clothes and made his toilet. It
was very embarrassing to have to do so in the presence of
strangers, but under the circumstances there was no avoiding it. As
soon as he had finished one of the officers very adroitly
handcuffed Mr. Howells, who looked furious, but who was helpless in
spite of his great strength. He was then conducted downstairs to
the shop, and Mrs. Howells was arrested on a warrant and on the
same charge. Two servants, a cook and maid-of-all-work, named Jane
Holcraft and Mary Prendergast respectively, were told to leave the
premises at once, and the third man was temporarily placed in
charge. The two officers and their prisoners then got into a
four-wheeled cab which had been waiting in the street, and they
were driven to the jail. Needless to say, perhaps, that the arrest
of these people was due to Tyler Tatlock, and the way in which he
tracked them down is a story in itself.</p>

<p>The initial point which gave Tatlock his clue was the clean
soles of the dead man's boots. It was clear&mdash;at least, to
Tatlock it seemed so&mdash;that the man never walked to the spot
where his dead body was found. If such was the case, it followed
that he must have been carried there, and who-ever carried him
there necessarily had a strong motive for concealing his death.
That was, so to speak, link number one.</p>

<p>Now for link number two. Mr. Graveling was well known. He was a
conspicuous man, horsy in appearance, and carrying about with him
the unmistakable air of his calling. Now, on the evening that he
left his friends at the hotel in York on the plea that he had an
appointment to keep previously to starting for the North, it was
evident to such a mind as Tatlock's that the man was going to meet
somebody outside of his particular ring of acquaintances, and that
somebody in all probability was not of the masculine gender. Acting
on this idea, Tatlock did search for the woman in York, but failed
to find her.</p>

<p>Then as to link third. There are very, very few men indeed who
have not some pages in their book of life they would like to tear
out and destroy for ever and ever. But though that cannot be done,
every care is taken to keep these pages from the eyes of the world.
Tatlock therefore turned his attention to Graveling's past history,
with the result that he learnt some curious facts. Years before, in
a certain public-house in Glasgow patronised and frequented by
betting men, was a very showy barmaid known as Agnes Lyal. She had
an almost perfect figure, a good complexion, fair hair. For the
rest, she was uneducated but intelligent, consumed with vanity,
conceited and cheeky. Her employer considered her a great
attraction to his place, and paid her well. Her admirers were
numbered by dozens, from the stupid shop-lad to the hardened old
Turfite. But Miss Agnes Lyal knew her game, and played it well.
Amongst the frequenters of the place was one who looked with very
admiring eyes on this bar Hebe, but from all his acquaintances he
concealed his admiration, and while others fawned on her and
flattered her, and she fooled them to the top of their bent, he
silently and insidiously worked to win her, and he succeeded. A
Scotch marriage took place, but he had his own reasons for
concealing it, and for some time after-wards she continued her
duties as barmaid. Then at her husband's request she took up her
residence in Belfast, where he paid her periodical visits. It
needed no prophet to predict that such an ill-assorted marriage
could have but one ending. He was a man of considerable culture and
refined tastes. She was coarse, uncultured, loud in her dress, fast
in her manner. Within two years they mutually agreed to separate.
Nevertheless, he recognised his obligation as the woman's husband,
and made her a good allowance until on the most justifiable grounds
he stopped it. It might be said that from that moment she became
his implacable enemy.</p>

<p>The name of the man who married Agnes Lyal was George Graveling.
By the way, Agnes Lyal was only an assumed name. Her real name was
Selina Smith. At the time of her marriage her father was a convict,
working out a long term of penal servitude at Dartmoor.
Subsequently she allied herself with one Richard Howells, a
powerful brute who had at one time been a prize-fighter, and
ultimately they set up a second-hand store within the precincts of
the city of York. On that fatal day when George Graveling
disappeared from the ken of his friends, to be subsequently found
stark and dead on Flaxton Moor, he had received an urgent message
from his former wife, asking him for some reason or other to see
her, and as he was still under her spell to some extent he went to
her.</p>

<p>Step by step, cleverly and patiently, Tyler Tatlock traced the
careers of Selina Smith and George Graveling down to that point. It
was in Belfast he picked up the information that Selina was
residing in York as Selina Howells. On the silver cream-jug he
found on Flaxton Moor the initials S. H. were scratched on the
bottom of the jug. They might have stood for lots of names
be-ginning with S. and H., but, having regard to all the facts he
had gathered up, he thought the jug might have belonged to Selina
Howells, and so he visited her shop, and amongst other things
offered the jug for sale. His deep-set eyes watched her the while,
and he read her face like a book, and felt perfectly sure that she
knew the secret of Graveling's death. Anyway, he laid such
information before the police that they were enabled to procure a
warrant for the arrest of the man and woman.</p>

<p>Firstly, it was absolutely certain that on the night of his
death Graveling was at the Howells' house.</p>

<p>Secondly, it was no less certain he had died from the effects of
oxalic acid.</p>

<p>Thirdly, oxalic acid was largely used by the Howells in their
business for cleaning tarnished metals and other things.</p>

<p>Here at once was a chain of presumptive evidence which justified
the warrant. The next step was to get up evidence to secure a
conviction; and the evidence as given at the magisterial inquiry
can be focussed thus:</p>

<p>Jane Holcraft had been in the service of the Howells for a
little over a year as cook. On the date mentioned she remembered a
gentleman coming to her master's house about eight o'clock at
night. She did not see the gentleman herself, but she was ordered
to cook some fish for supper, which she served at ten o'clock. She
believed a good deal of drink was consumed, including champagne.
She recognised the silver jug produced. It was one of a number of
silver things belonging to her mistress. She had the cleaning of
the silver, and had often cleaned the jug. She knew that oxalic
acid was kept in the house, but she herself never used it.</p>

<p>Jerry Coghlan was a groom in the service of the Howells. He had
two horses to look after and two traps, a dogcart, and a small
waggonette. He had been with the Howells for a little over a year.
On the date in question his master drove out in the dogcart, but
returned about four o'clock. It was the day of the races. It had
been raining, and the roads were very muddy. He washed the trap,
groomed the horses, and bedded them both down before he left for
the night. He did not sleep on the premises, as there was no
accommodation, but lodged in the neighbourhood. He went to a
music-hall that night with his young woman. The next morning when
he went to the stables he was surprised to find that one of the
horses had been out in the waggonette. The trap was very dirty, and
so was the horse; in fact, it was covered with mud, which had caked
on it. He noticed that in the apron of the waggonette there was a
large hole. It had the appearance of having been corroded or burnt
with some fluid. There was a similar burn and stain on one of the
cushions of the trap. As he did not want to be blamed for this
damage, he at once called his master's attention to it. Mr. Howells
said that he had driven a friend to the station on the previous
night, but he did not know what had caused the damage.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrew Weardale kept the Bell Inn at Market Weighton. He
attended races all over the country, and was very well acquainted
with Mr. George Graveling. On the day in question he was at the
York races, and had several business transactions with Graveling,
the result being that he gave him a cheque for twenty-nine pounds.
It was a crossed cheque, payable to the order of George Graveling,
and was drawn on the York branch of a Darlington bank. That cheque
had never been cashed. He recognised the cheque now produced as the
one he had given to Mr. Graveling.</p>

<p>This last piece of evidence added a powerful link to the chain
of evidence. The cheque had been found amongst Howells' papers in
his writing-desk.</p>

<p>The foregoing evidence was more than amply sufficient to justify
both prisoners being committed for trial at the Assizes, and during
the time that intervened more evidence was accumulated which left
little doubt that on the night of Graveling's death the two
prisoners drove in the waggonette towards Flaxton. There was a man
with them, but he was either dead drunk or asleep.</p>

<p>At the trial the prisoners were powerfully defended, but the
defence could not break down the prosecution, and both of the
accused were condemned to death. The man remained a hardened
ruffian; the woman broke down and became repentant, and the day
before her execution she made a written confession. In it she
stated she had written to Graveling asking him to see her. She had
always retained a considerable amount of influence over him. It was
Howells who suggested that he should be drugged and robbed. They
plied him first with drink. Then they gave him a large dose of
laudanum, after that they became frightened, as he looked so
strange, and seemed to be dying. The consequence was that Howells
put the horse to the waggonette. The insensible man was placed in
it. Howells also took a phial of oxalic acid which was on the
dining-room mantelpiece, and just as they were going out he
snatched up the silver cream-jug from the sideboard, so as to get
some water when they got to the moor, which Howells knew very well.
He said that by mixing the acid with water the effect would be more
rapid. As they drove along Howells took the phial from his pocket
to see how much it contained, and in the dark, thinking he had made
a mistake and brought a phial of spirits of wine, which was also on
the sideboard, he took out the stopper to spell, and in doing so he
spilt some of the acid on the apron and the cushion of the vehicle.
On reaching the moor, Howells carried the semi-insensible man, who
was then beginning to show signs of recovery, to the spot where he
was found. He got some water in the jug, put the acid into it, and
poured it down Graveling's throat. The victim was too dazed then to
know what it was he was drinking. To lead to the belief that the
man had committed suicide, in case his body should be found, the
phial that had contained the poison was placed in his pocket. It
was also decided to leave the Scotch bank-notes and the watch and
chain upon him. The loose gold, however, was left by an oversight.
In their excitement they forgot it.</p>

<p>Thus ended this remarkable tragedy, and it was due entirely to
the sagacity, skill, and patience of Tyler Tatlock that the cruel
murder of Mr. George Graveling was avenged.</p>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>TRACING A TRAITOR</h2>

<p class="first">
As most people are aware, every civilised country in the world
expends a large sum annually on what is known as 'Secret Service,'
but not many know to what extent every capital of Europe swarms
with spies, who are paid out of the Secret Service funds. It is the
business of each Government to find out all it possibly can as to
what is being done by other Governments. It is a matter of almost
absolute impossibility for any Government to preserve military or
naval secrets from the prying eyes of the ubiquitous spy. This spy
system is universal, and in the 'Service' are to be found men and
women of exceptional cleverness, who might in any other walk in
life, probably, if they so desired, become very prominent members
of society. But as spies they must ever remain unknown to the
outside world, and, no matter to what extent they distinguish
themselves in their calling, they receive no public recognition.
Secrecy is the guiding principle of the spy's existence. His life
is a mystery and a puzzle; and even those who are closest and
dearest to him are probably in ignorance of how he earns his bread.
Spies are almost invariably educated people, excellent linguists,
unemotional by nature, and gifted with the power of being able to
conceal their thoughts. Moreover, they should be adepts in the art
of disguise, and capable of deceiving their own parents. For
obvious reasons it is important that spies should not be known even
to each other, though it is not easy to guard against this. It is
the duty of the spy to transmit to his Government, as secretly as
possible, every scrap of information likely to be of value; and, as
may be supposed, in order to get his facts the spy not infrequently
has to try and corrupt somebody in a position to give the
information required. Now and again the public hear of a traitor
who may have been in the army, the navy, the dockyards or
elsewhere; but as a rule when a traitor is detected a discreet
silence is preserved. He is dismissed from the service, of course,
and for ever afterwards becomes a marked man in his own
country.</p>

<p>England, perhaps, spends less than any other European nation in
Secret Service, with the result&mdash;proved over and over
again&mdash;that we are often profoundly ignorant when we ought to
be well informed. The South African War, however, has opened the
eyes of the Government to its parsimony, and the Secret Service
vote for this year of grace is double what it has been for many
years.</p>

<p>These brief remarks are quite a propos to the remarkable story
that follows, and will serve to render the incidents more
intelligible.</p>

<p>YEARS ago, when it seemed as if this country and Russia would
become embroiled in a life-and-death struggle for supremacy in the
East, Tyler Tatlock was suddenly summoned to the War Office. It was
during a time of public excitement, and we were within an ace of
breaking off diplomatic relations with the 'Colossus of the North.'
How near we were to war the public did not know. Russia, with the
aggressiveness and self-assertiveness which have characterised her
'expansion policy' for centuries, disputed our claim to certain
boundary lines in connection with our Indian frontier; and we were
compelled to put our foot down, as the saying is, and exclaim in no
ambiguous language to the Northern Bully&mdash;'Thus far and no
farther.'</p>

<p>Some of our frontier defences, if not all, had been allowed
foolishly to fall into such a state of ruin that feverish activity
prevailed in order to be prepared for emergencies. It was at the
most critical stage of the negotiations that the Government learnt
by some means that Russia was being kept fully informed of our
plans and operations by a traitor or traitors; and at the War
Office a startling discovery was made. Copies of certain drawings
of the utmost importance were missing from the department where
much of the drawing was done, and there was every reason to suppose
they had been stolen with a view to selling them to Russia.</p>

<p>Efforts had been made to unearth the delinquent, but so far
without success, and there was a consensus of opinion amongst the
officials that it was desirable that an entire stranger should be
employed to ferret out this traitor, as the detectives employed by
the War Office permanently were more or less well known to the
clerks and others of the various departments&mdash;consequently
Tatlock was selected for the work. He bore a high reputation in
Government circles as a man of exceptional ability in his line, and
he had previously distinguished himself in carrying out Government
work.</p>

<p>Tatlock's interview was with General Sir George &mdash;&mdash;,
who in guarded language explained the situation.</p>

<p>'You will understand,' he said, after much talk, 'what an uneasy
feeling there is in the department alluded to, since every man
connected with it feels that to a greater or less extent he is
under suspicion. In a case of this kind the black sheep is at
especial pains to appear white, and, the documents having
disappeared, it may be very difficult to spot the thief. And yet it
is of the highest importance that he should be spotted, and weeded
out root and branch.'</p>

<p>Tatlock assented to the proposition involved in the foregoing
remark, and urged that the problem submitted to him for solution
was beset with so many difficulties that he was by no means hopeful
of success.</p>

<p>'For instance,' he said, running his eye down a list of about
forty names the General had placed before him, 'there are gentlemen
mentioned here whom to suspect seems almost to border upon the
ridiculous.'</p>

<p>Well&mdash;no,' replied the General. 'You see, every man in the
department is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, a
gentleman. By that I mean, apart from the necessary qualifications
of education, he is a man of honour; a man incapable of a base
action, and nothing can be baser than crime. It is not pleasant,
therefore, to have to raise one's finger and say A or B may be
guilty, when investigation would reveal that C or D was the actual
culprit. You follow me?'</p>

<p>'Perfectly well, and I appreciate your delicacy of feeling.
Nevertheless, what you say only serves to make my difficulty more
apparent.'</p>

<p>'In a sense yes; in reality perhaps no. You see, the
considerations which weigh with me can hardly influence you. You
can, for the purposes of your inquiry, place every one of these men
on a common level, and at the initial stage you need not
discriminate between Dick and Harry.'</p>

<p>The result of the interview was that Tatlock undertook to try to
unearth the culprit, stipulating for a perfectly free hand, which
the General assured him he should have.</p>

<p>The seriousness of the crime which Tatlock was called upon to
fix on the guilty person can hardly be realised by the casual
reader. But it will be best expressed by stating that owing to the
abstraction of the drawings, which it was logically concluded had
been stolen for the purpose of supplying Russia with information,
instructions had to be telegraphed out to India to make certain
modifications in the defence scheme. This meant an expenditure of
several thousand pounds. When Tatlock took up the work in earnest
he found that the laws of probability necessitated the focussing of
the suspicion on a section comprising twelve men, and closer
investigation reduced the twelve to six. It is perhaps necessary to
mention that while the various officials of the department in
question had been in conference with the chiefs of the War Office,
no definite steps had been taken with regard to the subordinates,
and the engagement of the services of Tyler Tatlock was kept a
profound secret.</p>

<p>The task that devolved upon Tatlock was one requiring the
exercise of skill, tact, and judgment. But he was equal to it, and
he set about his work with the deliberate caution that
characterised him. A full consideration of the duties, and the
conditions under which they were performed, of the six men Tatlock
had selected forced him to the conclusion that the traitor would be
found amongst them, and he proceeded to make himself acquainted
with the habits and non-official lives of this little group. Three
were married and had families; one was married, but without family;
two were bachelors.</p>

<p>Now, it chanced that at this period there lived in London, and
moved in the best society, a lady whom we'll designate as the
Countess X. She was said to be a Pole, but was an open advocate of
Russia. She was handsome, brilliant, rich; and her frequent letters
to the Times, in which by astute arguments she endeavoured to prove
that all our suspicions of Russia were absolutely unjustifiable,
had made her name known throughout the length and breadth of the
land; while her splendid receptions and entertainments at her
mansion in Park Lane had given her a conspicuous position in
society. Nevertheless, she was regarded with suspicion by some
people, as it was believed she was a spy in the pay of Russia. She
was about forty-five years of age, and whether she had a husband
living or not was a matter about which she did not choose to
enlighten the public. She had a daughter named Olga, a singularly
handsome girl of twenty or thereabouts, who was reputed to be able
to speak and write six or seven languages fluently, to be highly
educated, and to possess all her mother's cleverness and
brilliancy. The joint attractions of mother and daughter drew to
the hospitable Park Lane mansion hosts of people, a large
percentage of whom were young men, who vied with each other in
paying Olga flattering attention.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after Tyler Tatlock had seriously set to work
in his investigation of the War Office mystery he entered a very
foreign-looking cafe restaurant in the neighbourhood of Leicester
Square. He seated himself at an unoccupied table, and, speaking in
French to one of the waiters, ordered coffee a la verre and a
cheroot. He had not entered the place because it had any particular
attraction for him, but because he was interested in two young men
who had preceded him, and were joined at a table in a corner almost
immediately by a very foreign and very Jewish-looking individual,
'who might have been a Rooshian, a German, or a Prooshian, but was
not an Englishman.'</p>

<p>The two young men whom Tatlock had under his observation were
employed at the War Office. One, named Terence Trapmore, was a
draughtsman's copyist; the other, Paul Redmond, was a second-class
clerk. It was evident they had gone to the cafe for the purpose of
meeting the foreign gentleman, and by appointment. He greeted them
effusively, and for some time they engaged in earnest conversation.
The foreign gentleman gesticulated much, and shrugged his shoulders
with an impressiveness that conveyed a good deal of meaning.
Tatlock was too far removed from the trio to catch any of their
conversation, which, as a matter of fact, was carried on sotto
voce, but from his little, half-closed eyes he watched them, and
the gesticulations and shoulder-shrugs were signs to him of a dumb
language not altogether lost upon him. At last a little incident
occurred which was destined to afford him the clue for which he had
been searching so diligently. Terence Trapmore, clearly in reply to
something said by the foreign gentleman, pulled an envelope from
his pocket, took a letter from the envelope, placed the envelope on
the marble-top table, and handed the letter to the foreigner, who
read it with every manifestation of deep interest, and an elevating
of the eye-brows. Tatlock would have given a great deal to have
been able to have glanced over that letter, but that was out of the
question. He never did anything rash; he knew how to wait and
watch, and he had a saying to the effect that 'the patient watcher
was bound to sec many things.' Well, he saw the foreigner fold the
letter up and hand it back to Trapmore, who mechanically placed it
in his pocket, unmindful of the envelope on the table, and
by-and-by all unknowingly he swept the envelope off the table with
his elbow, and it fell to the sanded floor.</p>

<p>Tatlock watched and waited. And he continued to watch and wait
for fully an hour, when he was comforted by seeing the three men
rise and depart. When they had gone he moved quietly to where they
had been sitting, rapidly picked up the envelope, which had been
trampled upon and was much dirtied, and slipped it into his pocket.
He went back to his own table, gave a repeat order for coffee, and
in an unconcerned way, and as if prompted by the merest curiosity,
he inquired of the waiter who the foreign gentleman with the black
beard might be who had just gone out.</p>

<p>The waiter, suspecting nothing, answered that the gentleman was
known as Mr. Peter Petrovitch. He was staying in the house, and had
been there about five weeks. He was supposed to have some business
at the Russian Consulate, but what his business was the waiter did
not know.</p>

<p>In due time Tatlock sauntered out, and later on examined the
dirty envelope. In a cramped and unmistakably foreign hand it was
addressed to 'Terence Trapmore, Esq.,' at his private residence. Of
course, there was not much in that, but on the flap, stamped in
black and gold, was a peculiar crest. So the detective put that
envelope very carefully away in his pocket-hook. Though he did not
suspect it then, it was to prove the key to the somewhat complex
problem he had been called upon to solve. The following day he
presented himself at the Heralds' College, and showing the envelope
asked whose crest it was. After some little research he was
informed it was one that was used by the Countess X.</p>

<p>'Oh, oh,' thought Tatlock, this is getting interesting.'</p>

<p>The fact of an envelope bearing the crest of the Countess being
addressed to Terence Trapmore proved conclusively that Mr. Trapmore
was in communication with a lady who, rightly or wrongly, was
supposed to be an agent in the pay of Russia. His meeting Peter
Petrovitch at the Leicester Square cafe was also suspicious, and
altogether it seemed as if a pretty little plot was being worked to
the detriment of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Tatlock was now convinced he had got hold of certain threads
which, if followed up, would lead to important results. It was
necessary, of course, to act with caution, and apart from detecting
the traitor it was of the highest importance that the stolen
drawings should be recovered if possible. Any precipitancy would in
all probability frustrate the object aimed at. At that stage an
open accusation of Trapmore would serve no purpose; it was
Tatlock's business to get behind the scenes, and find out what was
going on. And he found out this much, that two nights after the
cafe incident Terence Trapmore and Paul Redmond were guests at the
Countess X.'s house.</p>

<p>A week later he received an intimation from the War Office that,
in spite of the precautions taken, it was believed an unauthorised
copy had been made of certain frontier out-posts in Northern India.
Up to this stage of the unravelment Tatlock had kept his suspicions
to himself. But he now laid such information as he had gathered
before Sir George &mdash;&mdash;, and was informed in return that
three days before Trapmore and Redmond had commenced their annual
holiday, and would not return to their duties for a month.</p>

<p>Tatlock now felt that, in a sense, his two men had scored a
point against him. Whoever had come into possession of the stolen
drawings would personally convey them out of the country owing to
the tremendous risks of sending them through the post, for, of
course, the postal authorities had been notified, and unusual
vigilance was being exercised. Under these circumstances Sir George
&mdash;&mdash; was in favour of an immediate arrest, which he felt
was quite justified by the suspicious movements of the two men.
Tatlock concurred with this, but he was quite prepared to find that
the birds had flown, and with the long start they had got they
might yet win in the desperate game they were playing.</p>

<p>Trapmore and Redmond were both bachelors. The former lived in
apartments in the house of a widow lady and her daughter in South
Kensington, the latter with his mother and sisters in the same
neighbourhood. He had gone with his people to Eastbourne for the
holidays, and Tatlock felt that for the time being he need not
concern himself any more about him. All his attention was given to
the presumed chief conspirator. Trapmore had left his lodgings, but
his landlady had no idea where he had gone to. He had simply said
he was off to Brighton for two days, and after that he did not know
where he would be, but anyway he would not return for at least
three weeks. The day after he left she sent on a parcel which came
after his departure, and which he was expecting. She addressed it
to the Grand Hotel, Brighton.</p>

<p>To Brighton, therefore, Tatlock went. He found that Trapmore and
Petrovitch had both been there. Petrovitch had been staying for
some time, but he and Trapmore had both left together and gone to
London. Tatlock tried the cafe in Leicester Square, but ascertained
that Petrovitch had left some time ago, and they had almost
forgotten all about him. From this point then the trace was lost,
but Tatlock was not the man to remain long baffled. His
resourcefulness was almost inexhaustible, and his deductions led
him to surmise that if anyone was likely to know of Trapmore's
whereabouts it was the Countess X. But he was not foolish enough to
suppose that that clever lady of intrigue would give the desired
information for the mere asking. Trapmore, there was every reason
to believe, was one of her creatures, and she would have to be met
by the same cunning which she so skilfully exercised herself when
dealing with others. So one morning a French gentleman called at
her residence and sent his card, marked 'pressing,' up to her. The
name on the card was M. de la Fosse, Rue Fontenelle 18, Paris.</p>

<p>Monsieur de la Fosse was a little man, dark to swarthiness, with
a waxed moustache and a fussy, self-assertive manner. Madame la
Comtesse graciously consented to receive him, although she did not
know him, and he was shown into a charming little morning room,
where she soon followed.</p>

<p>Monsieur bowed very low as the lady entered, and laid his hand
on his heart in token of the profound sentiments of his utmost
devotion to one so charming, and he apologised profusely for his
inability to speak any language but his own. It was very stupid of
him, very ignorant, but alas! it was the force of circumstances. He
hoped the Countess understood French. Of course the Countess
did.</p>

<p>'Ah!' then Monsieur de la Fosse was so happy, so very happy, and
once more he bowed and laid his hand on his breast. Monsieur de la
Fosse had allowed himself the supreme honour of calling on the
Countess to ask her for some information about his dear friend, his
more than brother, Terence Trapmore, who, as he understood, had the
felicity of knowing the Countess intimately. So much he had learnt
from his dear friend and more than brother Terence.</p>

<p>The lady's wonderfully mobile and singularly handsome face
evinced the astonishment she felt, and her keen eyes searched the
little Frenchman.</p>

<p>She confessed that she had some acquaintance with Monsieur
Trapmore, but she thought he had been guilty of some liberty in
talking about her to his friend, however intimate the friend
was.</p>

<p>Monsieur de la Fosse begged of her to compose herself. His dear
friend Trapmore was his more than brother. They had sentiments,
tastes, and feelings in common. Moreover he&mdash;Monsieur de la
Fosse&mdash;was a wonderful draughtsman. He had been in the service
of the French government as a draughtsman. He knew that his dear
friend and more than brother wanted him to assist him in making
some drawings of fortifications. He&mdash;Monsieur de la
Fosse&mdash;had come over to London on purpose, but when he called
at his dear friend and more than brother's apartments he found, to
his inexpressible astonishment, that the dear friend had gone away,
and only left a message to the effect that he would not be back for
three weeks. Happily Monsieur de la Fosse, as he assured the
Countess, was a man of peace and so fond of his dear friend, or he
would have been angry, so angry. As it was, he allowed himself the
liberty of calling on Madame la Comtesse, thinking she might be
able to tell him where he could find Monsieur Trapmore, with whom
he had much business of grave importance.</p>

<p>Madame la Comtesse looked scornful, suspicious, half-angry.
'Really,' she said, 'I am not interested in Trap-more, and know
nothing of his movements.'</p>

<p>'Alas, alas!' moaned the Frenchman, 'I have made a grave mistake
in my friend! He has played me false. He told me he wanted to see
me in London about some drawings. Now, when I come to this great
city I learn he is not your friend, and he has gone away. It is
shameful! It makes me very unhappy. Madame, I take my leave, and
beg you to accept the sentiments of my most distinguished
consideration. Madame, I am your very humble and obedient
servant.'</p>

<p>The Countess smiled again, and the whole expression of her face
indicated that she was suspicious of her visitor. As he was about
to depart she said with irony:</p>

<p>'If your friend is so devoted to you it is curious he should
have asked you to come to London, knowing full well that he was
going to Paris.'</p>

<p>Ah, he has gone to Paris. Mon Dieu, est-ce possible? and I will
swear he has gone with that Peter Petrovitch. Ma foi, what ill luck
for me!'</p>

<p>'You know Peter Petrovitch?' asked the lady, lifting her
eyebrows.</p>

<p>'Madame, I know that Peter Petrovitch.' Once more he bowed; once
more he laid his hand on his heart.</p>

<p>'Well, I believe they are both in Paris,' remarked the lady,
with a wave of her white jewelled hand, as if she meant to convey
that the discussion was closed, and she dismissed the subject and
her unwelcome visitor at the same time. Monsieur de la Fosse was
not dense, so with many bows and florid and perfervid expressions
of devotion he took his leave, and when he had left the house
behind him a little smile of triumph lurked in the corners of his
mouth, for De la Fosse was none other than Tyler Tatlock, the
detective. His visit had convinced him of three
things&mdash;firstly, Madame was the spy she was reputed to be;
secondly, she and Trapmore were in league; thirdly, Petrovitch was
a Russian agent, and between him and Trapmore was some bond, a bond
of treason as far as Trapmore was concerned.</p>

<p>Tatlock's remark to the Countess about Petrovitch was a lucky
shot. It was fired quite at random, but hit its mark. Madame knew
Petrovitch; she knew Trapmore; and she gave herself away when she
disclosed that she knew they had gone to Paris. Tatlock had made a
great stride. The problem was now less abstruse.</p>

<p>After an interview with General Sir George at the War Office,
Tatlock started for Paris. He did not know the address of the man
he was seeking, but in Paris it is infinitely less difficult to
trace a foreigner than in London. The compulsory system of
registration, and the lists of strangers kept at the Bureau de
Police, enables anyone who has a legitimate purpose in so doing to
find a person he may be looking for. Within a few hours, therefore,
Tatlock learned that Trapmore and Petrovitch had put up at the
Hotel du Nord; but both had gone. It was believed that the English
gentleman had departed for Vienna, and the Russian for London.</p>

<p>Vienna was within easy distance of the Russian frontier. If, as
was reasonable to suppose, he was conveying the stolen drawings
with him, the object of his journey to Vienna became apparent. At
any rate Tatlock acted on the supposition, and acted quickly, for
if he could only succeed in coming up with his man before he
reached Russian territory he could foil him in his little game, as
he was provided with the necessary official documents to enable him
to secure his arrest almost anywhere save in Russia.</p>

<p>Tatlock travelled through to Vienna without break of journey. He
had no certain knowledge that Trapmore had gone to Vienna, but
there were strong probabilities that he had done so. Anyway Tatlock
found himself in the beautiful Austrian capital, and, scarcely
pausing to draw his breath when he alighted from the train, he
handed in his credentials at the chief Police Bureau, and secured
the cooperation of the officials. Next to Russia, Austria has the
most perfect system of espionage of any country in the world.</p>

<p>In the 'Register of Arrivals,' kept at the Central Bureau,
Tatlock read a very full description of the man he was
after&mdash;Terence Trapmore, and learned that he was staying at
the Htel Prada.</p>

<p>To the Htel Prada, a first-class house, Tatlock went. And that
evening he saw Terence Trapmore at the table d'hte with a young
lady of striking beauty, to whom he seemed devoted. She was
handsomely dressed, and wore much jewellery. She was known in the
hotel as Fraulein Metrinkska. In reality she was Olga, daughter of
Countess X. The police books furnished Tatlock with the
following:</p>

<p>'Name&mdash;Fraulein Metrinkska, assumed. Real name, Olga,
daughter of Countess X., resident in London. Nationality, Polish or
Russian. Arrived from Dresden on the 1st. Receives much
correspondence from Russia and England. Believed to be a spy in the
interests of Russia.'</p>

<p>The following day a visit of inspection and interrogation was
paid by the police agents to the Hotel Prada at the instigation of
Tatlock. They were armed with an authority to search the baggage of
Terence Trapmore and Olga, otherwise Fraulein Metrinkska, for
suspected incriminating documents. The visit was like a thunderbolt
to the young people. They protested; they argued; they threatened;
but it was all useless. It was like banging their heads against an
adamantine wall. Their keys were demanded, and ultimately produced,
and in Olga's trunk was found a parcel of elaborate tracings and
drawings of various parts of the Indian frontier. The discovery
told its own tale. Olga had bewitched Trapmore. She had caused him
to sully his honour and become a traitor. She had waited in Vienna
for his coming with the all-important drawings, which she was going
to convey to Russia. The papers were confiscated, as she could not
prove any legitimate claim to them. Thus the little plot was
frustrated. She was furious. She stormed and raved. She even
threatened that the hosts of the Czar would swoop down and wipe
Austria off the map. The police agents smiled. Of course, they
would prefer no charge against her. She was free to remain or go as
she liked.</p>

<p>Terence Trapmore was stricken into dumbness as he realised that
his treachery was known. The light went out of his eyes, and a look
of blank despair filled them. Pending an answer to a telegraph
message Tatlock had despatched to London, asking for instructions,
Trapmore was placed under surveillance, which meant that he could
not leave the city without official permission.</p>

<p>That night was fair and beautiful. There was scarcely a cloud in
the star-gemmed heavens, and the moon shone with an effulgence
which filled the city with a sheen of silver, and trembled in
rippling wavelets of weird and solemn light on the rolling Danube,
into whose blue waters a broken-hearted and desperate man hurled
himself and his shame, and passed with a despairing wail to the
mystic beyond. Terence Trapmore had dreamed a dream, and Olga was
his vision. He awakened to reality, and death beckoned him. Some
eyes broke into tears, no doubt, when his end was known, but Olga's
didn't. What cared she? Terence Trapmore, the common-place War
Office drudge, was to her a mere man, to be used and trifled with,
and flung away when done with. She was glad when she heard he was
dead; the poor fool who had dared to suppose that he had the power
to win her love, she who was so radiantly beautiful. No; she had
her idol, but it wasn't Terence Trapmore. Two days later she
pursued her journey to Russia, smiling and radiant.</p>

<p>Tyler Tatlock's mission finished when he handed the stolen plans
back to the War Office, and thus checkmated Russia's designs as far
as these plans were concerned.</p>

<p>Nothing definite was actually proved against Paul Redmond, the
second-class clerk, though it was morally certain that he had aided
and abetted Trapmore, but the War Office authorities did not deem
it advisable to institute public proceedings. For obvious reasons
it was better to hush these things up; but Redmond was discharged,
and knowing that henceforth he would be a marked man he went
abroad. What the Countess X.'s feelings were when she heard of her
dupe's death it is not easy to tell, but it is significant that
shortly afterwards her effects in Park Lane were sold by auction,
and she departed for the Continent. She knew that her mission in
London had finished, and that she had been outwitted.</p>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>THE BIG LOAN FRAUD</h2>

<p class="first">
It was a summer evening. Time, between seven and eight o'clock.
The scene, Waverley Station, Edinburgh. The train from London had
just come in, and the passengers were numerous and miscellaneous.
The platform was thronged with an excited, jabbering crowd, made up
of passengers and porters, friends and loiterers. It was an
animated, bustling scene, full of life, movement, and noise.</p>

<p>A few moments after the train had come to a standstill at the
platform, a tall, gentlemanly-looking man, dressed in the height of
fashion, and wearing patent leather boots and canary-coloured kid
gloves, descended from a first-class compartment and greeted
another man who awaited him on the platform. The passenger appeared
so dainty and fresh that he did not give one the impression of
having travelled the whole of the hot and dusty journey from
London. But such was the case. The friend who met him was a burly
individual, whose general appearance suggested the flourishing
tradesman. His hair was close-cropped. He had bushy red whiskers
and moustache, and clean-shaven chin. The two men shook hands
warmly, and stood chatting for some few minutes until a porter came
up, touched his hat, and inquired of the passenger if he had any
luggage.</p>

<p>'Yes, a leather portmanteau, marked in front with a blue cross,
and on the top the initials R. B. painted white. You can't mistake
it.'</p>

<p>'Where's it from, sir?'</p>

<p>'Euston.'</p>

<p>'Shall I get you a cab?'</p>

<p>'No, I have already got one,' answered the friend. 'It's
standing over there, see, by the main entrance.'</p>

<p>'Right, sir. I'll bring the luggage to you,' answered the
porter, as he went off to where a crowd was surging round the
luggage van, which was being rapidly unloaded by a band of
perspiring, grimy men.</p>

<p>The two friends continued their conversation for a little while.
The new arrival carried over his arm a handsome rug, and in his
hand a brown leather handbag. At last they moved slowly through the
swirling human stream, and made their way to the vehicle which had
already been engaged by the friend. In this the passenger deposited
his rug and bag, and the two men fell to chatting again, lighting
up cigars drawn from the passenger's handsome case, which he
produced from his pocket.</p>

<p>At last the porter, labouring under the weight of a bulky
portmanteau, which he bore on his shoulder, appeared, and the
luggage having been deposited on the top of the vehicle the driver
was ordered to proceed to a certain fashionable hotel in Princes
Street, and the porter having been fee'd&mdash;evidently, by the
expression on his face, to his entire satisfaction&mdash;the two
gentlemen were driven away.</p>

<p>These two gentlemen had, all unknown to themselves, evidently
been an object of peculiar interest to a little, dark-eyed,
sharp-looking fellow, who came by the London train, and alighted at
the same time that the handsomely-dressed traveller descended from
the first-class carriage. From that moment the little man did not
lose sight of him and the friend who met him, until they drove off
to the hotel. Then the inquisitive and curious little stranger
sauntered leisurely along the platform, claimed a portmanteau from
the luggage van, and engaged the services of an outside porter to
carry it to an hotel within a biscuit throw of the station, and
lighting a cigarette he strolled after him.</p>

<p>Mr. John Rennie was the manager of the Scottish Finance
Corporation, Limited. It was a big concern with many ramifications.
They had branches in most of the principal towns of Scotland, and
their operations embraced a very wide field. Chiefly they were
concerned in lending money on mortgage, and in the purchasing and
re-selling of estates. Mr. Rennie had occupied the important
position of manager for a good many years, and was considered to be
an exceedingly shrewd and clever man.</p>

<p>To him there came one morning a fashionably-dressed gentlemanly
man, whose visiting-card bore the legend:</p>

<p>Col. John E. Pritchard.</p>

<p>'The Gables,' Richmond.</p>

<p>Army and Navy Club.</p>

<p>Colonel Pritchard had, apparently, important business to
transact. He was desirous of raising a first mortgage on what was
known as the Strathmain estate, situated in Perthshire. The estate
included an old-fashioned and somewhat dilapidated mansion,
containing about fifty rooms, with ample stabling, and about three
thousand acres of land, only a small portion of which was under
cultivation. The chief value of the property lay in its game, which
consisted of fish and feather. As was well known, the property had
been somewhat neglected owing to family disputes. A brother of the
Colonel's, a Mr. Wilfrid Pritchard, who was reputed to have been a
'rapscallion' and ne'er-do-weel, had caused a good deal of bother,
but at last he had sold his interests to the Colonel, and betaken
himself to 'the wilds of Siberia on a shooting expedition'&mdash;at
least, so it was reported by the Colonel, who apparently was
displaying a laudable desire to retrieve the family fortunes and
restore the good name, which, as the Colonel declared, had been so
shamefully bespattered by Wilfrid Pritchard. Mr. Rennie received
his visitor very courteously. He knew the Strathmain estate well by
repute. Its neglected condition had afforded the gossips food for
tattle for a long time; and there had been much speculation as to
what would be the fate of the property ultimately. It was capable
of almost any amount of development, and its value could be
trebled.</p>

<p>'I want to explain,' said Colonel Pritchard blandly, 'that my
object in raising a mortgage is with a view to developments.'</p>

<p>'What is the present rent-roll?' asked Mr. Rennie.</p>

<p>'Well, there are three farms, but the total amount realised from
them is only about six hundred and twenty pounds. They are very
much under-rented.'</p>

<p>'And the shootings, what do they realise?'</p>

<p>'Something under a thousand, but there again there has been
gross mismanagement.'</p>

<p>'What amount of money are you proposing to raise?' 'I want at
least twenty thousand pounds.'</p>

<p>'Is there any charge of any kind on the property at
present?'</p>

<p>'None whatever.'</p>

<p>'It is absolutely free?'</p>

<p>'Absolutely.'</p>

<p>The result of this interview was that Mr. Rennie, on behalf of
his company, undertook to have the estate surveyed and valued, and,
as the Colonel represented the matter as being urgent, it was
arranged that the business should be conducted with all despatch,
and a week was named as the limit in which a decision might be
looked for.</p>

<p>On this undertaking the Colonel went away, seemingly very happy
and contented, and Mr. Rennie was of opinion that he had an
opportunity of doing a good stroke of business for the Scottish
Finance Corporation, Limited, of which he was the managing
director, and an exceedingly enterprising one in the interests of
his company.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day on which Colonel John E. Pritchard
called upon Mr. Rennie with reference to the raising of a loan on
the Strathmain estate, the passenger from London was entertaining
three gentlemen in a private sitting-room of the hotel in which he
was staying. Each man was enjoying the flavour of an excellent
cigar from a box that stood on the table. And that the meeting was
not a Temperance one was verified by the fact that whisky and
brandy were also on the table, and before each gentleman was a
glass, which was frequently raised to the lips of the gentle-man,
and its liquid contents seemed to be much appreciated.</p>

<p>One of the gentlemen was the same person who had met the
passenger from London on his arrival, and was addressed as
'Sandeman.' The other was a little squat man, with clean-shaven
face, a somewhat bulbous nose of a vermilion hue, and a general
suggestiveness that he loved the flesh-pots of Egypt a good deal
more than he loved hard work. He answered to the name of Blagdon.
The passenger was familiarly referred to as 'Jack.' The fourth man
of the group answered to the name of Nick. He was a man of powerful
build and horsy&mdash;decidedly horsy&mdash;as to his
appearance.</p>

<p>These gentlemen smoked a good deal, and consumed liquor freely.
The one with the vermilion nose patronised the brandy, but the
whisky was evidently to the taste of the others. The business in
which they were engaged seemed to be of an important character.
Pens, ink, and paper were on the table. And 'Jack,' having filled a
sheet of paper with writing, handed it to Sandeman, who perused it
carefully, and passed it to Blagdon, who read it thoughtfully with
the air, of a professional man, and marked several passages with
pencil, and then gave it to Nick, who silently and with grave mien
went through it, and having spent ten minutes or a quarter of an
hour in mastering its contents said:</p>

<p>'This will have to be altered. It's not clear enough.'</p>

<p>'That's my opinion,' remarked Blagdon. 'Its terms are too vague,
and the passages I have underlined in pencil are capable of various
legal interpretations.'</p>

<p>'Ay, precisely,' put in Sandeman, speaking slowly and
decisively. 'Oor friend Jock's a fine lad, but he's no equal to
drawing up an agreement of this kind, except in so far as he would
keep the oyster to himself, and gie us the shells.'</p>

<p>There was a little laugh at this sally, though Jack didn't join
in it. The expression on his face rather indicated that he resented
the soft impeachment. But he betrayed no anger in his voice, as,
turning to Blagdon, he said:</p>

<p>Set your great legal brain to work, then, and produce something
better.'</p>

<p>This suggestion met with the hearty approval of Sande-man and
Nick, so Blagdon recharged his glass as a necessary preparation for
the important work. He also threw away the remainder of the cigar
he had been smoking, and lit a fresh one. Then, taking a sheet of
foolscap paper, he doubled it up at the edge so as to form a
margin, and, after this preliminary, he began to write, taking
Jack's document as a basis for his own. He was quite an hour before
he had completed his task, during which the conversation was
general and desultory, though Blagdon worked quietly and in a
perfectly absorbed way, so that he seemed quite oblivious of his
surroundings. At last he finished. He read over what he had
written, made one or two corrections, then with a self-satisfied
air he handed it to Jack, with the remark&mdash;</p>

<p>'There; I think that meets the case.'</p>

<p>Jack read and frowned, but said nothing. He passed the paper to
Sandeman, who expressed his approval by exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>'Capital, capital,' and he handed the document to Nick, who
dwelt upon its contents until at last he also declared that it was
all right.</p>

<p>'Very well,' said Jack, 'since you all approve of it, I've no
objection to raise. As you are a good writer, Sandeman, make three
more copies of this, so that we can each have one.'</p>

<p>Fresh cigars were lighted, more drink poured out, and then
Sandeman set to work. It took him a good two hours to accomplish
it. Then, the papers having been read, each appended his signature
to all four; each folded up his copy and put it into his pocket,
and the business of the meeting having been thus satisfactorily
arranged, the gentlemen rose, shook and stretched themselves, and,
as the hour was nearly eight o'clock, Blagdon expressed an opinion
that it was time for the inner man to be attended to, and he
suggested that Jack should order dinner; so the door was
unlocked&mdash;it was strange they should have kept the door
locked, but so it was&mdash;the bell rung, and when the waiter
appeared he was told that the four gentlemen wished to dine; and
the next move was for the four gentlemen to adjourn to Jack's
bedroom to have a wash and brush up. No sooner had they left than a
door at the end of the room opened. It was the door of a cupboard,
and there stepped from the dark recess of the cupboard the little
sharp-eyed man who had travelled from London in the same train as
the 'Passenger.' He went downstairs, had a word or two with the
landlord in the entrance hall, and about an hour later he left
Edinburgh by the night mail for London.</p>

<p>A week passed, and in accordance with the arrangement previously
made Colonel John E. Pritchard called upon Mr. Rennie to know what
decision had been arrived at with reference to the mortgage.</p>

<p>'Well,' began Rennie, 'I have had the Strathmain estate
carefully surveyed, and the report presented to me would not
justify me in recommending my company to advance you twenty
thousand pounds.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, how is that?' cried the Colonel, looking somewhat
crestfallen.</p>

<p>'Because in its present condition the value of the security
would not, in our opinion, sufficiently cover us against
contingencies.'</p>

<p>'But I have always understood that the marketable value of the
estate was between forty and fifty thousand pounds,' the Colonel
said, with obvious anxiety and disappointment in his tone.</p>

<p>Mr. Rennie smiled as he replied softly:</p>

<p>'I am afraid you have been misinformed. There is no doubt the
property is capable of much improvement, but it will take a long
time and necessitate considerable outlay.'</p>

<p>'Well, what is the best you can do?'</p>

<p>'I have gone carefully into the matter, and don't think we could
advance more than fifteen thousand pounds.'</p>

<p>'The deuce!' exclaimed the Colonel, biting his lip.</p>

<p>'I am sorry, but of course we have to look to the possibility of
having to foreclose.'</p>

<p>The Colonel seemed terribly put out. He sucked his moustache and
drummed irritably on the table with his fingers, until at last,
brusquely and suddenly, he said:</p>

<p>'Make it sixteen.'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I can't do that.'</p>

<p>'Then I'm hanged if I don't try some other firm,' cried the
Colonel, as he jumped up with the air of a person who was annoyed
and out of temper.</p>

<p>At that moment there was a knock at the door, and, in reply to
Mr. Rennie's 'Come in,' a clerk entered, and handed the manager a
slip of paper. Rennie glanced at it, and, turning to his visitor,
said&mdash;'Excuse me for a few minutes, I will not keep you
long.'</p>

<p>The Colonel sat down again, and Rennie left the room. He was
absent about ten minutes, and when he re-entered he was followed by
two tall, powerful men, one of whom approached the Colonel and
said&mdash;'You are Colonel John E. Pritchard, I believe?'</p>

<p>The Colonel, who had jumped up, looked ill at ease, and
stammered out&mdash;</p>

<p>'What has it got to do with you?' Then, suddenly changing his
manner and tone, he added, 'Yes, that is my name. What do you want
with me?'</p>

<p>'I hold a warrant for your arrest on a charge of conspiracy,
fraud, and forgery.'</p>

<p>The Colonel's face grew deadly pale, and with a nervous, jerky
movement he thrust his hand into his coat pocket, but the two men
fell upon him, dragged his hand out, and with it a nickel-plated
revolver, which dropped on to the floor, and one of the barrels
exploded, but fortunately without damaging anyone. The carpet,
however, was burned, and a hole drilled in the wall by the bullet.
Very adroitly and rapidly the Colonel was handcuffed. Then, with a
ghastly smile, he asked&mdash;Upon whose information is this absurd
charge preferred?'</p>

<p>'Upon the information sworn to by one Tyler Tatlock, a private
detective, of London, and your brother Wilfrid Pritchard.'</p>

<p>'My brother!' gasped the prisoner, as he reeled and seemed as if
he would fall, but the men caught him, and supported him. He shook
himself free, and with an effort recovered his self-possession.</p>

<p>'I shall have a full and complete answer to this monstrous
charge,' he said.</p>

<p>Many a long day had passed since the newspapers had been able to
furnish their readers with such sensational reading as that they
printed on the morning following Colonel Pritchard's arrest. The
story had in it all the elements of a thrilling romance. It
appeared that John and Wilfrid Pritchard were the sons of a
gentleman who had made a fortune in trade. Wilfrid was the elder
brother, and inherited a considerable amount of property, including
Strathmain. John had held a commission in the Militia, but had been
compelled to resign it on account of conduct unbecoming an officer
and a gentleman. Since then he had lived on his wits, and had
associated himself with a disreputable barrister, named Blagdon,
who had been struck oft the rolls; a Walter Sandeman, who had once
kept a public-house in Glasgow, but for a long time had also lived
by his wits; and one Harvey Nicolson, a racing tout. This quartette
of unprincipled rascals had resorted to many schemes for keeping
themselves supplied with coin of the realm, and at last the fertile
brain of John E. Pritchard conceived a daring and desperate plan
for raising the wind.</p>

<p>His brother Wilfrid Pritchard was a dipsomaniac, and sadly
neglected his affairs. John, in connivance with the other three
rascals, induced him to accompany him to Paris. There, by means of
corruption and bribery, they got him shut up in a private lunatic
asylum; and the road being thus cleared, the barrister Blagdon,
with the aid of Sandeman and Nicolson, forged a transfer of the
property to John, it being arranged that a mortgage should be
raised, and the money shared in varying proportions. It was
Sandeman who met Pritchard at the Waverley Station the night he
arrived from London, and it was Sandeman who had arranged that the
Finance Corporation should be applied to for a mortgage.</p>

<p>It chanced, however, that an aunt of the Pritchards, who
disliked John very much, but had a strong regard for Wilfrid in
spite of his faults, and had tried to reform him, became alarmed
and suspicious by his sudden disappearance, and fearing that there
had been foul play she enlisted the services of Tyler Tatlock, who
shadowed John, followed him to Edinburgh, concealed himself in the
cupboard in the room of the hotel, and overheard all that took
place when the quartette met and drew up an agreement as to the
amount each was to receive for his share in the villainy. Then he
hurried south to report the whereabouts of Wilfrid, so that his
friends could take steps to ensure his release, and he returned to
Edinburgh in time to make his dramatic coup while John was
conducting his negotiations with Rennie.</p>

<p>The four wretches had considered themselves so secure that their
sudden arrest was like a bolt from the blue, and as the evidence
accumulated and the net was tightened around them they felt that
their doom was sealed.</p>

<p>The trial that followed in due course was something more than a
nine days' wonder, and the result was inevitable from the first.
The offence with which they were charged was an exceedingly serious
one, and the punishment commensurate with so grave a crime. The
sentence that was pronounced made it certain that Society would be
in no further danger from the machinations of these accomplished
scoundrels for a very long time.</p>

<p>It is perhaps needless to say that Tatlock was highly
complimented on his skill in nipping this great conspiracy in the
bud, and one more triumph was added to the many that had served to
make his name famous as an unraveller of criminal mysteries.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>THE MISSING BRIDE</h2>

<p class="first">
ONE of the most peculiar cases of duplicity that Tatlock was
ever called upon to investigate was that which came to be known as
'the Gyde Abduction Case.' It was peculiar in many respects, more
particularly in the cunning, the artfulness, and cruelty displayed.
Indeed, there are few parallels to it, and it furnishes us with one
more powerful example of the depths to which human wickedness is
capable of reaching. If the story were the invention of the
romance-writer, the superlatively clever people who write the
reviews for the papers would pooh-pooh it as absurdly improbable;
but one need only go to real life to find the groundwork for
comedies and tragedies which make invention seem ridiculous. The
everyday life of almost any large community is marked by sensations
which out-romance all the romances ever evolved from clever brains.
The story here told needs no florid hyperbole to make it
attractive. It can be set down in plain, straightforward, narrative
form, with the certainty of exercising a fascination over those who
take an interest in human problems.</p>

<p>Miss Margaret Farnell was about twenty years or age. She was
petite, unsophisticated, very pretty, and of a gentle and confiding
disposition. She fell in love with Gilbert Gyde, who was about
eight years her senior; by profession a barrister, by inclination a
dilettante. He was the son of a wealthy man, who, however, was not
very liberal; and as Gilbert was a third son, it seemed as if his
prospects were not particularly bright. On the other hand, however,
he was clever, and, while he loved not law, he wooed literature,
and a facile pen found ready employment by the magazines and big
weeklies. A striking feature of this case is that Gilbert's eldest
brother, John, reputable heir to a snug estate roughly valued at
four thousand a year, was the first wooer of Margaret. For reasons,
however, which she, in her woman's way, could no doubt have
justified, Margaret gave up John Gyde, and accepted the attentions
of Gilbert. This led to family differences on both sides. John was
of a vindictive, unforgiving nature, and it was an open secret that
he had declared he would never recognise his brother Gilbert
again.</p>

<p>James Farnell, Margaret's father, falls to be described as 'a
decayed gentleman,' a somewhat vague description truly, and with a
certain objectionable suggestiveness about it. Put into plain
language, James was the son of a man who had distinguished himself
at Oxford, but nowhere else. He succeeded to a fortune, sat in
Parliament as representative of a small borough, had a somewhat
disreputable connection with a lady of title, squandered his
fortune, was compelled by force of circumstances to apply for the
Chiltern Hundreds&mdash;in other words, resign his seat in
Parliament&mdash;and afterwards became private secretary to Lord
Tintern, with whose youngest daughter he contracted a secret
marriage. When this became known to her father he disowned her, and
she and her husband had to struggle to live. They had a family of
four children, one girl&mdash;Margaret&mdash;and three boys. Mr.
Farnell was clever, well educated, and well connected, but he
lacked stability of purpose, and spent his time and energy in
railing against Fate instead of exerting himself in trying to
improve his position.</p>

<p>Margaret Farnell and Gilbert Gyde were married, not amidst
rejoicing, and with the clashing of marriage bells shivering in the
air, and flowers and gay dresses lending light, colour, and
picturesqueness to the scene. Their marriage took place in a
gloomy, mouldy church, on a drizzling, slushy, sloppy day, and with
only the gouty old verger and the asthmatical old female
pew-cleaner and a cousin of the bride and a friend of the
bridegroom present. Nothing could have been more depressing, more
sombre, more unorthodox, in the conventional and social sense, than
this wedding. Nor was the ceremony followed by congratulations,
luncheon, the drinking of health and happiness, and the merrymaking
usually associated with marriage in a respectable walk in life. The
young couple drove in a musty-smelling common four-wheeler from the
church to Euston Station, whence they got the train to Edinburgh,
where they intended to spend a week and then go on to Inverness and
Loch Maree. Four days after the wedding, however, Tyler Tatlock,
the detective, at the urgent solicitation of the distracted
bride-groom, was searching for the bride, who had been mysteriously
spirited away. The circumstances were curious enough, and pointed,
obviously, to a conspiracy. All that could be gathered at the time
was this:</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gyde were staying at the Balmoral Hotel. They had
dined as usual at half-past six. Then Mr. Gyde had betaken himself
to the smoking-room to indulge in a cigar, while his wife went
upstairs to her bedroom to attire herself to attend a swell concert
for which her husband had procured tickets. Mr. Gyde sipped his
coffee, smoked his cigar leisurely, and glanced over the London
papers, as the concert was not to begin until half-past eight.</p>

<p>At a quarter-past eight he went upstairs to see if his wife was
ready, but she was not in the bedroom. Her fan, opera-glasses, a
pocket scent-bottle, her gloves, and a cambric handkerchief were on
the dressing-table, suggesting thereby that she had temporarily
gone out of the room. So Mr. Gyde washed his hands, brushed his
hair, and put on his hat. It was then half-past eight, and his wife
had not come back. Then he noticed for the first time that her hat
and cloak were gone. He rang the bell, and inquired of the
chambermaid if she knew where his wife was. The maid could give no
information, so Gyde went downstairs. He looked in the
reading-room, the drawing-room, but failed to find his wife. He
sauntered to the door, thinking she might have run out to some
neighbouring shop for some trifle necessary for her toilet.</p>

<p>A quarter to nine chimed by the Tron clock. The concert
commenced at half-past eight, but still there was no sign of Mrs.
Gyde. Gilbert went upstairs again. On the dressing-table there were
still the fan, opera-glasses, and other odds and ends, which the
lady had evidently placed there. The husband was puzzled, but not
alarmed. He felt satisfied that his wife had run out for something
she wanted and had had to go farther afield than she anticipated.
He would chide her playfully when she came back for keeping him
waiting and missing the commencement of the concert. Nine o'clock
boomed from the Tron.</p>

<p>Somehow or other the sound of the bell as it struck the hour
begot in him the first symptoms of alarm. It emphasised the
remarkable fact that his bride of a few days was three-quarters of
an hour late for the concert&mdash;they ought to have left the
hotel at a quarter-past eight. So he hurried downstairs and made
inquiries. The head waiter knew nothing, and another waiter to whom
he addressed himself knew nothing. He therefore appealed to the
young lady bookkeeper in the office in the entrance hall.</p>

<p>'Have you seen my wife, Miss?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'You don't know if she's gone out?'</p>

<p>'No, I don't. But Archie, the hall porter, brought a note to me
addressed to her, and I sent it up to her room by James, the
waiter.'</p>

<p>This item of information literally astounded Gyde. Who could
possibly have sent a note to his wife? The hall porter was appealed
to. A youth came into the hall and inquired if Mrs. Gyde was
staying there, and he handed a note to the porter, with a request
that it be delivered immediately to Mrs. Gyde. The porter took the
note to the bookkeeper; the bookkeeper sent it upstairs to Room
47&mdash;Mrs. Gyde's room&mdash;by James, the waiter. A short time
afterwards the lady came downstairs in a great hurry. She'd her hat
and cloak on, and went out, so said the porter.</p>

<p>Mr. Gyde was more deeply puzzled, and his alarm grew. What could
it possibly mean? Neither he nor his wife had ever been to
Edinburgh before, and they knew nobody in the place&mdash;that is,
no one in the least likely to send a note by hand to his wife, the
contents of which had evidently caused her to leave the hotel
hurriedly. The circumstance was mystifying and disquieting. The
poor fellow went out into Princes Street, and walked a little way
in one direction, then turned back and went in the opposite
direction, hoping all the time, of course, that he would meet his
wife, but he didn't.</p>

<p>Once again the brazen bell of the Tron gave tongue, and
announced that half of the tenth hour had expired.</p>

<p>Half-past nine!</p>

<p>Gyde literally ran back to the hotel. Had Mrs. Gyde come in? The
hall porter hadn't seen her. The anxious husband rushed upstairs to
his room. There still lay his wife's fan, opera-glasses,
scent-bottle, &amp;c., on the dressing-table. The mystery was more
mysterious. The poor fellow was at his wit's end what to do, until
a fearful thought that something tragic had happened came over him,
and ten minutes later he was at the head Police Office telling of
his woe and beseeching that information be circulated all over the
city, without a moment's loss of time, that the lady was
missing.</p>

<p>Ten, half-past, eleven, and then midnight chimed, but there was
never a sign of his wife's return. Gyde passed a night of maddening
suspense. What he suffered cannot be adequately described by mere
words. He spent those awful laggard hours in going backwards and
forwards between the hotel and the police station. With the
urbanity for which the Edinburgh police are noted, they did all
they could to calm the distracted husband. One of their detectives
who had earned a reputation for cleverness exerted himself to the
uttermost, but failed to get any trace of the missing young
lady.</p>

<p>It was June, and the dawn of the summer morning found Gyde
blear-eyed, haggard, and forlorn. He had quite exhausted his brain
in trying to work out some plausible theory to account for his
young wife's mysterious disappearance. But the more he struggled
with the problem the more puzzled he became. That she had not
premeditated flight seemed evident on the face of it, by the fact
that her jewellery, which was of some value&mdash;in fact,
everything except what she stood upright in&mdash;she had left
behind. Therefore, if her flight had been planned, she had
displayed a vast amount of artful cunning to throw him off the
scent. But when an unworthy thought tried to fasten upon poor Gyde,
he freed himself from it. He would not, could not, think anything
unworthy of the dear little woman who, but a few days previously,
had linked her destiny with his.</p>

<p>Suddenly it occurred to him to telegraph to Tyler Tatlock. He
was not unacquainted with him, having in his capacity as a
journalist met him on several occasions. He knew Tatlock to be very
clever, though he was not gifted with the all but supernatural
powers which the public were inclined to ascribe to him. But
Tatlock had over and over again succeeded where many men of vaunted
ability had failed. So the sorrowing husband wired to him; a very
urgent message it was, and it chanced that when he got it Tatlock
was enabled so to arrange his affairs that he left that very night
for the north.</p>

<p>When the two men met, Tatlock listened patiently, as was his
wont, to the story as told by Gyde. For a moment, truly it was not
more than a moment, Tatlock deemed it probable there was another
lover in the case. But he dismissed that thought as soon as born. A
rapid mental survey of the facts as recorded served to convince him
that the young woman had not gone away as a consenting party. He
arrived at this conclusion probably more by some subtle,
indescribable instinct, than by any process of reasoning. And yet,
of course, he did reason. Equally of course, it was indispensable
to his task that he should make numerous inquiries about Margaret's
acquaintances and position before her marriage. And on this point
Gyde afforded all the information he possibly could.</p>

<p>Two very trying and torturing days to Gyde passed, and then
Tatlock advised him to return to London. As may be supposed the
young man was very averse to do that. He was crushed and broken,
but he preferred to linger in the place where he had spent the
early hours of his married life. He was argued out of this idea,
however, by Tatlock, who said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Here you are lonely and desolate. In London you will be amongst
your friends. They can give you the consolation that strangers
cannot do. Besides, your wife is not in Edinburgh.'</p>

<p>'What! Not in Edinburgh?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'How do you know that?'</p>

<p>'I guess it.'</p>

<p>'Then can you not guess where she is?'</p>

<p>'Not at present. But take my advice. Go south. Wait patiently.
Be hopeful; trust in Providence.'</p>

<p>Gyde recognised the futility of questioning Tatlock at that
stage. He was like the Sphinx&mdash;solemn, imperturbable,
mysterious when occasion required; and no amount of questioning
would make him speak if he felt that he had nothing to say. So Gyde
wisely refrained from seeking to draw him; and with heavy heart and
oppressed spirits he turned his back on beautiful Edinburgh,
feeling in so doing as if he were leaving all that held him to
life, and that hence-forth he must plod on his way, dragging for
ever with him the corpse of his dead hopes.</p>

<p>Amongst his own relatives he found that curiosity was more
conspicuous than sympathy. His brother John said some very unkind
things to members of the family about Margaret, things in which
there was only a half-concealed suggestion that the pretty but
fickle Margaret had repented of her marriage, and had thrown
herself into the arms of some old lover. This, coming to Gilbert's
ears, rendered him furious, and seeking out John he threatened him
with personal chastisement&mdash;a threat that doubtless would have
taken practical shape but for the interference of other members of
the family.</p>

<p>Gyde had been back in London a week when Tyler Tatlock called
upon him at his chambers.</p>

<p>'What news?' cried the young man with a nervous, feverish
anxiety.</p>

<p>'None at present.'</p>

<p>Gyde's heart turned cold again.</p>

<p>'Is there no hope, then, of solving this mystery?' he asked in
faltering accents.</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't take such a pessimistic view of the case as that.
We shall probably recover your wife shortly. But now I want you to
write a letter to my dictation. Don't ask me any questions, don't
seek to know to whom you are writing, but do exactly as I desire
you to do.'</p>

<p>Gyde had far too strong a faith in Tatlock to set himself in
opposition to him, and in a few minutes he had penned, from
Tatlock's dictation, the following note:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">In reply to yours I undertake to comply with all
the conditions you lay down, and will be at the place you indicate
at seven o'clock next Wednesday evening.</p>

<p><br>
Gyde signed this brief epistle, and handed it to the detective,
who put it in an envelope, sealed it up, and told Gyde to address
it to&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">
<span class="smcap"><i>Peter,<br>
34 Edgware Road,<br>
London.</i></span></p>

<p><br>
As may be supposed, Gyde's curiosity was aroused to such an
extent that he found it very hard to refrain from plying the
detective with questions. But he did refrain, for he had given his
promise to do so; moreover, he was sure that Tatlock had got a
clue, and it was better to let him go to work in his own way.</p>

<p>On the following Wednesday Tatlock turned up again, and
instructed Gyde to proceed to a sailors' slop-shop situated in
Ratcliffe Highway, and kept by a Chinaman named Woong Sing. He was
to enter the shop at seven o'clock precisely, and say to the
Chinaman: 'Keys.'</p>

<p>The Chinaman would answer&mdash;'Locks.'</p>

<p>The Chinaman would then lead him to a room, where he would very
likely meet another man. What would happen then Tatlock did not
pretend to know, but every-thing was to be left in his hands. It
was all mystifying and strange, but Gyde consented to be thus led,
blindfolded as it were, feeling sure that his guide knew what he
was about.</p>

<p>'By the way,' said Tatlock, as he was about to take his
departure, 'can you fire a pistol?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I think so.'</p>

<p>'Then take this. And for God's sake be careful, for it's loaded.
And, mark you, as you value your life conceal the weapon about your
person, and under no circumstances produce it unless it be to
defend your own life.'</p>

<p>The situation was now thrilling, in addition to being
mysterious, but Gyde resolved to play the part sketched out for him
to the letter.</p>

<p>Woong Sing's slop-shop was one of many to be found in the
unsavoury neighbourhood where Jack Tars fall an easy prey to the
land-sharks that swarm there, ever on the look-out for them. It was
a stuffy, little, dirty den, the stock-in-trade being oilskins,
sou'westers, sea-boots, jack-knives, flannel shirts, and the like.
A tall, yellow-skinned, blear-eyed Mongolian stood behind the
little counter. It was Woong Sing. To him entered Gilbert Gyde as a
neighbouring church clock was striking seven.</p>

<p>'Keys,' said Gyde.</p>

<p>'Locks,' answered the Chinaman, who, motioning his visitor to
follow him, led the way up a narrow, dark stair-way, every board of
which creaked dreadfully when trodden on, as if in pain. A second
flight, no less narrow and no less dark and creaky, was ascended,
and Gyde found himself in a small, low-ceilinged, foul-smelling
room. Such furniture as there was seemed tumbling to pieces.
Without speaking a word the Chinaman, having shown his visitor in,
departed. In the centre of the room was a small table with a
petroleum lamp burning on it. There was a mouldering couch at one
end; a tiny bedstead covered with a filthy counterpane stood in a
recess; a few rickety chairs, and a cheap wardrobe that was falling
to pieces, completed the furniture.</p>

<p>Wondering what the next act would be in this funny and
mysterious little drama, Gyde waited, almost in breath-less
expectancy, with his hand in his coat-pocket, clasping the pistol.
Presently the door opened, and a dissipated, hard-featured,
seedy-looking individual entered. He scrutinised Gyde very closely,
who scrutinised him in turn.</p>

<p>Have you brought the money?' asked the seedy one abruptly, in a
raspy, rusty voice in keeping with his appearance.</p>

<p>'What money?' asked Gyde, getting more and more mystified.</p>

<p>'What money!' echoed the blear-eyed man. 'Do you mean to
say?'</p>

<p>Before he could finish the sentence a third actor appeared on
the scene in the person of Tyler Tatlock. The man started, and his
blotchy face grew pale. Looking rapidly from Tatlock to Gyde, he
asked, addressing the latter:</p>

<p>'What does this mean?'</p>

<p>'It means that you are trapped like a rat, my fine fellow,'
answered Gyde. The man drew a revolver quickly. Whether he really
meant to use it or not, or he merely intended it as a menace, it is
difficult to say, for Tatlock with wonderful agility knocked the
weapon out of his hand, and as it fell on the floor he put his foot
on it, and said:</p>

<p>'Don't try any tricks, my man, or you'll repent it. Mr. Gyde,
have you got a pistol?' Gyde produced his weapon. 'Cover this
rascal, please.' Tatlock then stooped and picked up the revolver,
glanced at the chambers, and saw they were loaded. 'Now then, my
beauty,' he continued, addressing the man, 'you will fully realise
that you are trapped. My name is Tyler Tatlock. Perhaps you have
heard of me! Ah! your face tells a tale. I am not unknown to you,
evidently. Now, then, it may tell in your favour&mdash;for, unless
I am mistaken, you are only a tool&mdash;if you are frank, and
answer my questions quickly. What is your name?'</p>

<p>The man looked distressed and unhappy. There wasn't much of the
lion at bay about him; he was rather suggestive of a whipped hound
whose one yearning desire was to sneak off; but though Tatlock was
small of stature, his determined air and fiery eyes told too surely
that he was not a man to be trifled with. Besides, there was Gyde
with a pistol in his hand also.</p>

<p>'My name is Jerry Worboys,' answered the man.</p>

<p>'And what's your occupation, Mr. Worboys?'</p>

<p>'I've been a coachman in a gentleman's family.'</p>

<p>'The third question. Where is Mrs. Gyde?'</p>

<p>Jerry Worboys hesitated, but a glance at Tatlock was sufficient
to make him hesitate no longer.</p>

<p>'She's at her father's house,' growled Jerry.</p>

<p>Gyde fairly staggered, and Tatlock could not suppress his
surprise.</p>

<p>'Then you are in league with her father?' suggested Tatlock.</p>

<p>Worboys admitted that he was, and began to whine for mercy. Gyde
positively felt faint and ill as he now realised that his own
father-in-law was at the bottom of the business. Tatlock opened the
door, went to the top of the stairs, and bawled out, 'Woong Sing,
Woong Sing.' The Chinaman came upstairs in response to the call.
'Have you a key to this room?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, me have key.'</p>

<p>Then lock this man in. And look here, my Chinese friend, I hold
you responsible for him. I am Tyler Tatlock, the detective, and if
you let him escape I will ruin you. You understand.'</p>

<p>'Me welly understand. Me no wantee be ruined. Me keepee him all
welly secure.'</p>

<p>'How long am I to remain here?' asked Worboys in alarm.</p>

<p>'Until I choose to release you.'</p>

<p>'Woong Sing turned the key in the door, and handed it to
Tatlock. They all went downstairs, and Tatlock and Gyde into the
street. Both were glad to get out of the evil-smelling den.</p>

<p>'This is a pitiable business,' said Tatlock, 'and, presumably,
if you recover your wife, you would prefer to hush the matter up to
avoid publicity and scandal.'</p>

<p>'It is a terrible business,' gasped Gyde, mopping his forehead.
'And as my father-in-law seems to be a prime mover in it, there
must be no publicity if it can be avoided. But how did you solve
the mystery?'</p>

<p>In the fireplace of the bedroom you occupied in Edinburgh I
found an envelope addressed to your wife. It was evidently the
envelope that had contained the note which had induced her to go
out on the night she disappeared. A day or two after you left
Edinburgh a letter was delivered at the Balmoral for you by a
messenger. I heard of this, and asked the people to let me see the
letter. The superscription was the same as the handwriting on the
envelope addressed to your wife. I took the liberty of opening the
letter. It bore no address, no date, no signature. The writer said
he could restore your wife to you, but would only do so on
condition that you paid five hundred pounds, which, he suggested,
under the circumstances, you could get from your father. In the
event of your consenting to do that, the meeting between you and
the anonymous writer was to take place at Woong Sing's shop. Your
answer was to be addressed to "Peter," 34, Edgware Road. You were
also particularly requested to note that when you entered the
Chinaman's shop you were to say "Keys" and he would answer "Locks."
My first move was to go to Ratcliffe Highway and learn something
about Woong Sing. I found he had kept his shop for about ten years.
I interviewed him, but he vowed and declared he knew nothing about
"Peter." A man whom he had never seen before went there and made
arrangements for the meeting. Woong Sing was told that on Wednesday
night, precisely at seven o'clock, a stranger would enter, say
"Keys," to which Woong was to reply "Locks," then show his visitor
upstairs. For this service he was to receive five pounds.</p>

<p>Gyde hurried to Mr. Farnell's house, accompanied by Tatlock, and
it was soon disclosed that the missing bride was imprisoned there.
Being in desperate straits for money, Farnell had resorted to this
extraordinary and dastardly crime to obtain some, believing that
Gyde's father would advance the sum demanded. His confederate was a
fellow named Peter Johnston, who years before had been a coachman
in Farnell's employ. Peter kept a public-house in Chelsea, which
was a great resort for betting-men. Farnell frequented the house
and kept in touch with the ex-coachman. When he conceived the
dastardly scheme of abducting his own daughter, Farnell took Peter
into his confidence, knowing that he, too, was pressed for money.
Peter had a brother who kept a little grocery shop in Ratcliffe
Highway, two or three doors from Woong Sing, and through the
brother he became acquainted with the Chinaman. Mrs. Gyde had been
lured from the hotel by a very artful trick. Her father went down
to Edinburgh and penned the following note:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">
<span class="smcap">My Dear Margaret</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">
I have been overtaken by a terrible misfortune; ruin and
imprisonment stare me in the face. My only hope of salvation is in
your husband, but the unhappy differences between him and me
prevent my appealing direct to him&mdash;at least, until I have had
an interview with you. I am sending this by hand. The moment you
get it, come out and see me. I will be waiting close to the Sir
Walter Scott Monument. I will not detain you five minutes. However
astonishing it may seem to you that I should be in Edinburgh, and
however strange my request may be, comply with it, otherwise my
death will lie at your door.</p>

<p><br>
This note, though it distressed Margaret and put her into a
flutter, fulfilled its purpose, for nothing her father did
surprised her, and so, without waiting to think, she threw on her
hat and cloak and hurried out. When she met her father he appeared
to her to be suffering from such mental excitement that he was half
mad, and, yielding to his pressing solicitations, she accompanied
him to the Waverley Station. They went into the waiting-room, where
he had some brandy and water, and she drank a bottle of lemonade.
There is no doubt her wretched parent drugged this lemonade, for
she remembered very little afterwards until she found herself lying
on the seat of a first-class railway carriage, and her father was
seated opposite her. When she had recollected her scattered senses,
she demanded to know what it all meant. Farnell told her he was
taking her to London, and, producing a revolver, he threatened to
kill her and himself if she betrayed him. Fairly believing that he
had gone mad, she was horrified into silence and a compliance with
his wishes.</p>

<p>Arrived at Euston, he compelled her to get into a cab with him,
and he took her home and actually imprisoned her in one of the
bedrooms. The suffering she endured may be far better imagined than
described. In their happy reunion, however, husband and wife forgot
their woes, and it was decided to take no action against either
Farnell or his accomplice. A few weeks later Farnell did really
show signs of mental aberration, and it ultimately became necessary
to confine him in an asylum, where he died in the course of the
year.</p>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>LOVED AND LOST</h2>

<p class="first">
'THE entrance was effected by that side window, and two men at
least must have been engaged in the affair.'</p>

<p>Thus spoke Miss Mary Gleeve to Tyler Tatlock in the drawing-room
of the 'Old Manor' at Clepperton-on-Rill, Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Clepperton was a quiet out-of-the-world place, beautifully
situated in the heart of a purely rural district, and the Old Manor
was an ancient mansion somewhat modernised internally to suit
present-day requirements. It was a detached, irregularly-built
house, standing far back from the road, and surrounded with
charming grounds.</p>

<p>Tatlock had been sent for to investigate a rather uncommon
burglary, and at the same moment there lay up-stairs in a
semi-darkened room, silent and marble-like, the mortal remains of a
lady who had turned the allotted span of life. She had long been
ill, and had passed away after suffering and a long period of
partial coma, from which all the skill of her physicians had been
powerless to arouse her. This was Lady Gleeve, relict of Sir Henry
Gleeve, a wealthy tradesman, who had been Mayor for five
consecutive years of the borough of Clepperton, and had received
knighthood during the distribution of Birthday honours in the last
year of his mayoralty. He did not live long to enjoy his
well-earned distinction and repose. He had but one child, a
daughter, who was ten years old at the time of her father's death.
Sir Henry left everything he died possessed of to his widow for her
sole and absolute use, unless she should marry again, in which
event two-thirds of the property were to be held in trust for the
benefit of his daughter when she came of age.</p>

<p>Helen Gleeve was a very pretty and strong-minded girl, who did
not get on very well with her mother, who was an imperious,
unreasoning kind of woman of very humble origin. Sir Henry Gleeve
had commenced life in a lowly position, and while still a
struggling young man met and fell in love with a young woman who
occupied the position of upper housemaid in a gentleman's family.
Gleeve married her, and she was destined to become Lady Gleeve. Her
husband had never lost his affection for her, and had the greatest
faith in her judgment and, as he was fond of thinking, her 'good
common sense.'</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the views of Helen Gleeve and her mother did not
coincide, and when the girl was still lacking a few months of being
nineteen she took her fate in her hands and married Reginald Scott,
a well-educated but poor young man, a son of an old East Indian
officer, who had had a big family, small income, and years of hard
struggling to make both ends meet. Nevertheless, he had managed to
give his children a good education, and Reginald had been three
years at Cambridge, where he took his M.A. degree. Strangely
enough, this young man was Lady Gleeve's pet aversion. She made no
secret of the fact that 'she couldn't bear him.' He was forbidden
her house, and warned what the pains and penalties would be if he
dared to persist in making love to pretty Helen. In spite of this
he did dare, and one day Helen went off with him, and they became
man and wife. It was romantic, of course, but they were destined to
know many hard, bitter days of struggle against poverty and
misfortune.</p>

<p>Lady Gleeve vowed she would never forgive her daughter. 'She has
gone from my house,' she said, 'and I will tear her out of my
heart,' and the amiable lady did. But, having done that, there was
a void, a waste, a hollow; she felt her loneliness, she yearned for
companionship, so she advertised for a young lady as 'a companion,'
and got one. It ended in her adopting this young woman legally. She
drew up a will herself, cancelling all former wills, had it
properly attested, and stowed it away in a strong box, which was
kept in a sort of lumber-room. She did not like lawyers, and never
had anything to do with them if she could help it. Hence the reason
she made her own will and kept it herself. A previous will which
had been prepared by a lawyer left everything to her daughter
Helen. When Lady Gleeve made her second will she did not destroy
the first, and the two kept each other company in the strong box in
the lumber-room at the Old Manor.</p>

<p>Lady Gleeve lay dying, not yet physically dead, but with a dead
mind. And one night when she was in this state, and a drowsy nurse
watched, and the night light flickered, a burglary was committed at
the house. The lumber-room was entered, the strong box opened, and
Lady Gleeve's second will carried off, together with an
old-fashioned gold repeater watch and some rather valuable antique
silver spoons. These things were in the box with the wills, and the
burglar or burglars did not go to any other part of the house, but
confined themselves to that particular room. Lady Gleeve, of
course, knew nothing of the robbery, and thirty-six hours later the
undertaker was measuring her for her coffin.</p>

<p>Miss Mary Gleeve, the adopted daughter, had thus to bear a
double blow; and it does not necessarily imply that she was not
concerned about her foster-mother's death because she betrayed keen
anxiety about the robbery; for, if that second will could not be
recovered, how was she going to substantiate her claim to the
beautiful old Manor House property and a snug fortune? There was
the first will, which had been legally prepared, still in
existence, whereby all the property passed to Helen Gleeve, and the
second will, which cancelled that, and had been drawn up by Lady
Gleeve herself, was gone&mdash;perhaps destroyed.</p>

<p>The situation was a heartrending one, and Miss Mary Gleeve, by
the advice of a gentleman who was paying his addresses to her,
placed herself in communication with the renowned Tyler Tatlock.
And he, in compliance with a pressing request, sped from London by
the fastest train of the day, and had a long interview with the
adopted girl.</p>

<p>As already stated, the Old Manor was a large, rambling, detached
house. The so-called lumber-room, which as a matter of fact was a
well-furnished chamber, was filled with a good deal of superfluous
but valuable furniture, nick-nacks, pictures, some bronzes, a
rather good statuette or two, bric--brac of all kinds, articles de
vertu, &amp;c. Except as a treasure store-place the room was not
otherwise used. It was lighted by two windows, one at the side
overlooking an orchard, the other at one end, which commanded a
wide panoramic sweep of country of great beauty. It should be
mentioned that the room was situated in the angle of a wing. The
burglars had effected an entrance by means of the side window; and
they had reached the window by rearing a heavy, cumbersome ladder
underneath. This ladder had been lugged from the stable-yard at the
back of the house. Strangely enough, a large mastiff was kept in
this yard, but he had evidently been an accessory to the crime, for
though he had not been tampered with in any way he held his
peace.</p>

<p>Having listened to all the details that were to be gathered
about the burglary, Tatlock went over certain features in the case
that were too obvious to be overlooked. Firstly, the burglar or
burglars must have had a pretty intimate knowledge of the house;
and, secondly, their primary object was to steal the second will,
which gave Miss Mary Gleeve the property. It was this aspect of the
case which removed it from commonplaceness and pointed to something
very much like a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Tatlock interviewed James, the groom&mdash;a very ordinary
specimen of his kind; while 'Thetis,' the noble mastiff, was a very
extraordinary specimen of his kind. He was a magnificent brute, of
immense weight and strength, with enormous jaws. The stable-yard
was at the back of the house, and enclosed by a high wall. 'Thetis'
was allowed to run loose in this yard all night. The ladder which
had been used for the burglary was taken from the yard, where it
was kept hanging horizontally underneath a shed. James the groom
slept over the stables. The coachman slept in the house. James
heard nothing in the night. The dog made no noise. Yet the burglar
had got over the wall&mdash;for the stable-yard door was kept
locked at night&mdash;had taken down the ladder, passed it over the
wall, and all the time the dog remained silent. James averred that
when he came down at six o'clock the animal was as lively as ever,
and showed not the slightest symptoms of having been drugged. How
was it, then, that such a formidable watch-dog refrained from doing
his duty? There was but one explanation of this, according to
Tatlock's way of looking at it, and that was: the burglar and
'Thetis' were old chums. That was a point of probability which
Tatlock made the most of. At first sight circumstances suggested
that James the groom might have had a finger in the pie, but after
his interview with him Tatlock felt convinced that the fellow was
perfectly innocent. His intelligence was not of a very high order.
He was a country bumpkin&mdash;too stupid to have concealed all
traces of his guilt had he been guilty.</p>

<p>Another point on which Tatlock formed a decided opinion was that
of the robbery of the watch and spoons. His idea was that the room
was entered for one purpose, and one purpose only&mdash;namely, to
steal the will; but the cupidity of the burglar was aroused by the
sight of the spoons and watch, and he took them. A very critical
examination of the ground, which was soft owing to recent rains,
led Tatlock to another conclusion; namely, only one man had
committed the burglary. On the lawn, where the ladder was lying
underneath the window, where there was a flower-bed, and right up
to the wall of the stable-yard were very distinct traces of
hob-nailed shoes. The footprints were distinctive, inasmuch as from
one of the soles several nails were missing. The prints indicated a
large boot&mdash;a large boot suggested a big man&mdash;a big man
would have muscular strength, and could have managed to have
carried the ladder unaided. This feat would have been impossible to
a little, weak man, but certainly not beyond the powers of a
powerful one.</p>

<p>Having mentally argued out these various points, Tatlock set to
work practically. His chief aim, of course, was the recovery of the
lost will, whereby Miss Mary Gleeve was the heiress. Failing that,
there was nothing to prevent Mrs. Reginald Scott laying claim to
her late mother's property under the original will. Tatlock's first
step was to deter-mine by actual experiment if a strong man by his
unaided efforts could get the ladder over the stable-yard wall,
rear it against the side of the house, and then, having done with
it, lay it down on the lawn. To this end the services of a navvy
working on a branch railway, ten miles off, were secured. He stood
six feet high in his stockings, measured forty-two inches round the
chest, and weighed a little over thirteen stones. He was a powerful
man, and he succeeded in carrying out the experiment with
comparative ease. This was one point proved.</p>

<p>The next step was that James the groom received instructions to
creep up to the stable-yard after dark, mount on to the wall
stealthily, and as soon as he heard Thetis, the dog, move, to speak
softly to him, and then, if the dog did not declare for war, to
lower himself down into the yard. James did not readily lend
himself to this little service. Although perfectly familiar with
the dog, he was not quite sure if Thetis would consider he was
justified in allowing even James to enter the stable-yard at night
by getting over the wall. Another fear that troubled him was that
if he succeeded he might be accused of the robbery. On that score
Tatlock reassured him, and the test was carried out, while Tatlock
remained at the safe side of the wall. When James reached the top
the huge dog sniffed, then uttered a low, deep, menacing growl. A
word from the familiar voice, however, and Thetis showed every
manifestation of delight, offering no opposition whatever to
James's descent into the yard; but as soon as the door was opened,
and Tatlock took a few steps forward, there was a rumpus, and had
James not interfered, and interfered forcibly too, Tyler Tatlock
might have provided a job for an undertaker and a tombstone
merchant. Thus were two points settled, and the lines to run upon
were pretty clearly indicated.</p>

<p>Clepperton itself was a town of some importance, and municipally
it embraced Clepperton-on-Rill, Upper Clepperton, and Marsh
Clepperton, which was a very small hamlet, with not more than a
couple of hundred inhabitants. Clepperton-on-Rill was of much
greater importance. It had a parish church, and numbered about four
thousand inhabitants. The majority of them were engaged in
agricultural pursuits. A paper mill on the Rill gave employment to
nearly a hundred, and there was a very good percentage of country
gentry. It need scarcely be said, perhaps, that out of four
thousand people there was a residue of loafers, though, with some
exceptions, the worst crime that could be charged against them was
an undue love of beer, and a constitutional laziness which caused
them to prefer idleness to honest work.</p>

<p>Amongst the exceptions was a notorious character named Joseph
Waruble, but locally referred to as 'Ginger Joe,' the sobriquet
having been conferred upon him on account of his possessing a
mop-like head of fiery red hair. He was a big, hulking, powerful
fellow, a native of the village, but who had been a thorn in its
side nearly the whole of his thirty-five years of life. Poaching
had an irresistible fascination for him, and he had suffered
various terms of imprisonment, and had done one stretch of two
years' hard labour for having severely bashed a gamekeeper who
suddenly came upon him as he was setting a trap for partridge. By
trade Joe was a bricklayer, and a good one when he liked to work;
and as he had periodical fits of virtue, he did work now and again.
Curiously enough, Lady Gleeve had interested herself much in the
man, who had a wife, a wee, delicate little creature, about half
his weight, and it was a redeeming feature in Ginger Joe's
character that he treated his wife with extraordinary tenderness,
and evinced an unchanging fondness for her. She was clever with her
needle, and went occasionally to the houses of the gentry to do
sewing. She was frequently employed at the Rectory, and more
frequently at the Old Manor. Lady Gleeve had also given Joe a good
deal of work. He had practically rebuilt the stables for her, had
bricked the stable-yard, put down drain-pipes on her land, and did
various jobs of that kind.</p>

<p>Very naturally Ginger Joe came under Tyler Tatlock's
observation. He fitted in somehow with the detective's theory of
the kind of man likely to have committed the robbery. He had
prodigious strength, he knew the Old Manor well, and, what was even
more to the point, he and Thetis, the big mastiff; were churns.
Practical evidence was furnished of this. By Tatlock's advice Miss
Gleeve sent for Joe to come and take up a drain in the stable-yard,
which was stopped up. During the operation Tatlock watched him, and
noticed that Thetis displayed great affection for him, and the man
seemed just as fond of the dog.</p>

<p>Some days later Tatlock, in company with the head constable,
waited on Ginger Joe, and demanded to know where he was on the
night of September 18. That was the night of the robbery.</p>

<p>Joe tried to shirk the question&mdash;he prevaricated, he
dodged, he shuffled, and endeavoured by every means within the
grasp of his intellect to keep out of the net which was being
spread for him. At last he declared that he had been at the 'Dun
Cow' pub. until closing time, and then had gone straight home and
to bed, as he had partaken of more beer than he could comfortably
carry. Unfortunately for his story it was soon proved that on that
particular night he had not been at the 'Dun Cow' at all. Being
thus discredited, he was promptly arrested on suspicion of having
been concerned in the burglary at the Old Manor. Having got him in
custody, a search was made at his cottage, and resulted in the
discovery of a heavy pair of hob-nailed boots. From the sole of one
of these boots several nails were missing. It corresponded exactly
with the footprints in the garden and on the flower-bed of the Old
Manor.</p>

<p>The finding of the boots stimulated the searchers to increased
effort, and places that had not been dreamed of before were now
examined, as it was thought probable the silver spoons might be
somewhere about, and sure, enough, in a hole under the eaves of the
thatch there were the stolen spoons and the gold watch, enveloped
in a piece of an old mackintosh, which was covered with a strip of
dirty canvas.</p>

<p>The chances against the things being discovered were a thousand
to one, nor would they have been save for the fatal boots.</p>

<p>With such clear evidence against him, it was impossible for
Ginger Joe to wriggle out of the net that had been cast about for
his taking, and now occurred an astounding thing. He was pressed to
tell where the stolen will was, but for a time preserved a dogged
silence. There were things working in his mind, however, for,
ludicrous as it may seem, Joe was mightily hurt at being considered
a thief. To snare part-ridges and pheasants, hares and rabbits, was
not wrong in his opinion. Nor did he think it was much to his
discredit to bash a gamekeeper now and again; but when it came to a
question of being accused of house-breaking, of being a common
thief, his pride was hurt, his 'honour' wounded, and, unable to
restrain himself, he charged the Rev. William Arles with having
prompted him to, and bribed him to, commit the deed; but he
confessed he was only commissioned to steal the will. But, yielding
to a sudden weakness, he snapped up the gold watch and spoons. The
temptation overcame him. Immediately after, however, he regretted
it, and intended some day when the affair had blown over to return
the watch and spoons anonymously.</p>

<p>At first it was thought that his accusation of the Rev. Mr.
Arles was the result of a distraught mind. The Rev. William Arles
was the curate at the parish church, a position he had held for
three years. He was a young man of melancholy temperament, but much
respected. He had written a volume of really charming poetry, and
was also responsible for some very popular hymns. It seemed,
indeed, like madness to suppose that he could have been guilty of
prompting a burglary. The story was preposterous; it was the
invention of a lunatic's brain. But in a few days con-science smote
the Rev. Mr. Arles, and, with brain on fire and heart breaking, he
made a confession, which in substance was as follows:</p>

<p>He had been at Cambridge with Reginald Scott, and the two young
men had become attached friends. At a later period Arles met and
fell desperately in love with pretty Helen Gleeve. She was a dream
to him&mdash;his star. He wrote poetry about her; he worshipped the
very ground she walked upon, but though he knew he could get her
mother's sanction to his wooing he lacked the courage to make his
passion known. Then he discovered that his college friend Scott was
courting Helen, so he buried his secret in his heart, shut his
sorrow up, and resolved that no living woman should ever blur the
image of Helen as far as he was concerned. Being a constant visitor
at the Old Manor, and a friend of Lady Gleeve, who regarded him as
her spiritual comforter, he knew the family affairs&mdash;knew
about the wills, and the strange animosity the mother cherished
against her own daughter. And he knew also that his idol, Mrs.
Scott, was living with her husband in poverty, while a usurper was
to get that which by every moral right was hers. At last the
unforgiving mother lay a-dying; then it was he conceived the
strange, mad idea of bribing Ginger Joe to steal the second will in
order that Helen&mdash;the woman he had worshipped&mdash;and the
friend he honoured should be benefited. It was a curious, quixotic
thing to do; but, whatever wickedness there was in the act, no one
could say it arose from sordid motives.</p>

<p>For many and many a day the sad, true story was the sensation of
Clepperton, and few there were who were not filled with a great
sympathy for the miserable young man who had loved and lost, and
committed a crime&mdash;not to benefit himself, but the woman who
could never be aught to him, and would know nothing of his deed. So
strong was the sympathy that when the curate was put on trial at
the sessions for his offence a very light sentence indeed was
given; but to such a sensitive mind the disgrace was fatal, and he
passed to a madhouse. Ginger Joe also had his sympathisers, and had
it not been for the watch and spoons he would have been let down
easily. As it was, he had to submit to twelve months' hard
labour.</p>

<p>Of course the will was restored, and the adopted daughter
entered into possession of that which the law allowed her under the
will. It is to her credit that she offered to settle a by no means
inconsiderable sum on Mrs. Scott, but it was refused.</p>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>THE FORGED CHEQUE</h2>

<p class="first">
IN one of Glasgow's best suburbs dwelt Mr. Leslie Muir-head, on
a charming little estate of which he was the happy possessor. He
had made a fortune, and was still nominally in business at the time
of the incidents about to be narrated. His warehouse was in
Glasgow, and for nearly half a century he had given close and
untiring attention to his business, although his personal
inclinations were for a studious and scientific life. He had two
hobbies to which he devoted all his spare time. One was botany, the
other astronomy. When his position was assured, and he purchased
the property alluded to, he devoted himself less and less to his
business, and more and more to his favourite pursuits. He turned
his charming home into a little paradise. The grounds were
magnificently laid out, and were, so to speak, a shrine to which
botanical devotees made pilgrimages, and were always warmly
welcomed by the owner.</p>

<p>Mr. Muirhead did not marry until he was a good deal over thirty,
and, much to the disappointment of himself and his life partner, it
remained a childless union. The result was he ultimately adopted a
niece and nephew, the children of his deceased sister&mdash;his
only sister, who made an unfortunate marriage. Her husband was a
member of a good family, but of dissolute, abandoned habits, with
an unconquerable passion for gambling and horse-racing. His name
was Crossley, and his wife&mdash;who led a very unhappy
life&mdash;bore him two children, Mary and Ernest, the girl being
the firstborn. When they were in their early teens their father was
killed by being thrown while riding in a steeplechase. His widow,
who was suffering from cancer, survived him only six months. Mary
was then about sixteen, Ernest fourteen, and, as their father had
left nothing but an evil reputation behind him, their uncle, Leslie
Muirhead, took them. The education of both had been neglected, so
Mr. Muirhead engaged a first-class resident governess for the girl
and sent Ernest to a good school near Edinburgh for a couple of
years, and then to France, that he might learn French. It was his
uncle's intention to take him into his business, and, as he had a
considerable trade connection with France, he thought it would be a
good thing for the young man to have a knowledge of the French
language. Ernest completed his studies abroad, returned home, and
took up a position at once in the Glasgow business, the management
of which to a large extent was left in the hands of David Guthrie,
who had been in Muirhead's employ for a great many years; indeed,
ever since he was a boy.</p>

<p>Long after Muirhead had settled in his new home, and given
himself up almost entirely to his favourite pursuits, an incident
occurred which caused him the greatest amount of concern and
unhappiness. One day, quite early in a new year, when looking over
his bank pass-book, he was surprised to find on the debit side the
following entry:</p>

<p>'September 25th, cheque, 500,' and this cheque had been payable
to bearer.</p>

<p>He taxed his memory, but could not recall any transaction in
which he had paid away five hundred pounds. Besides, it wasn't in
the least likely he would have drawn a cheque for so considerable
an amount payable to bearer. He referred to the counterfoil of his
cheque-book. There it was, sure enough: 'Sept. 25th, bearer, 500l.'
The cancelled cheque&mdash;which, being payable to bearer, required
no endorsement&mdash;was the same. It was his handwriting, his
signature.</p>

<p>He was puzzled as well as concerned. Surely, he thought, he
could never have been so absent-minded as to have done such a thing
as that. If so, then it was pretty clear that his hobbies were
exercising such an influence over his mental powers that his will
and his reasoning were subordinated, and that meant mania. To a
hitherto clear-headed, straight-dealing man such a thought as this
was not pleasant, and let it be stated at once that he was
honourable and fair-dealing, sensitive to a fault, singularly
punctilious, and entirely free from suspicion, which is generally
the result of a grasping, ill-balanced mind.</p>

<p>The discovery was startling in more ways than one. He had been
giving an immense amount of attention to his hobbies of late. Not
only had he engaged himself in a singularly abstruse astronomical
problem, but he had been working at an experiment whereby he hoped
ultimately to succeed in producing a crimson lily, which had long
been the dream of floriculturists. What he now feared was that his
mental health had suffered to some extent, but he resolved to learn
more about that five hundred pound cheque, for he could not recall
a single incident in connection with it, and he was greatly
troubled.</p>

<p>A few days later he went up to Glasgow, and called at his
banker's. Though not wishing to make a feature of that cheque, he
said incidentally to the manager, after discussing other
things&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, by the way, I seem to have drawn a cheque to bearer for
five hundred pounds on the 25th of September last. I suppose you
don't happen to know who presented it?'</p>

<p>'Well, Mr. Muirhead, it was so unlike you to draw a cheque like
that that when it was presented the cashier brought it to me. But
as there was not the slightest reason to doubt your handwriting or
signature, the cheque was of course paid, but I told the clerk to
take note of the person who presented it. The presentee was a
well-dressed woman.'</p>

<p>'A woman!'</p>

<p>'Yes. I hope the transaction was all right,' remarked the
manager anxiously.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes; well, as far as I know.'</p>

<p>'As far as you know,' exclaimed the manager, as he looked at his
customer in surprise, for this was so unlike Mr. Muirhead.</p>

<p>'Yes. The fact is, I suppose I drew the cheque, but upon my
word, for the life of me I can't recall having done so, and haven't
the remotest idea what it was for.'</p>

<p>'Really, Mr. Muirhead, excuse me, but&mdash;but don't you think
you are allowing your hobbies to run away with you a bit?'</p>

<p>The manager was sufficiently well acquainted with Mr. Muirhead
to venture this remark.</p>

<p>'That is precisely what I do think,' answered Muirhead, then
having an aversion to any further discussion on the subject he
passed on to something else.</p>

<p>A few days later, acting on the advice of his wife, who,
however, knew nothing of the cheque incident, he was in London with
his niece, Mary Crossley, on his way to the Continent for a
holiday. He intended to go to Florence, thence to Rome for
Easter.</p>

<p>His niece was also needing change, although she had not said so.
But she had been looking careworn of late, and unusually pale. He
wanted her to consult a doctor, but she had resolutely declined,
and as she was a young woman with a will he did not press the
subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Muirhead and his niece enjoyed their trip. They spent three
pleasant weeks in Florence, then went on to Rome and witnessed the
Easter carnival, and from there the programme included a visit to
Naples; but Muirhead received a letter from his manager in Glasgow,
David Guthrie, that startled him in a way that the mystery about
the five hundred pound cheque had quite failed to do. It was a long
letter, and after dealing with many business matters it proceeded
as follows:</p>

<p>It is my painful duty to inform you now that I have brought to
light some very serious discrepancies in the accounts, and various
sums, aggregating something like four thousand pounds, cannot be
satisfactorily accounted for. I have not made a critical
investigation yet, but it is certain there is something wrong, and
while I am reluctant to worry you while you are on your holiday I
should have been wanting in duty had I failed to bring the matter
under your notice. I await your instructions.'</p>

<p>This letter was like the bursting of a bomb-shell at his feet,
and it seemed to throw some light on the affair of the cheque. For
long years he had carried on business smoothly and pleasantly, and
had prided himself on the honesty and uprightness of everyone in
his employ. Now there was a traitor in the camp, and it was not
altogether unnatural that his suspicions should dwell upon his own
nephew. He tried to persuade himself that this was a preposterous
thought, but it was no use. He remembered the career of the young
man's father, and he felt it was like father like son.</p>

<p>He did not say anything to Mary about the letter he had
received, but wrote off immediately to his manager, marked the
letter 'strictly private and confidential,' and gave Guthrie
peremptory orders to take no steps until he returned, and under no
circumstances breathe a syllable to living soul. Mr. Muirhead was a
proud man, and if perchance his suspicions were well founded the
loss of the money would be as nothing compared with the blow to his
pride if it became known that his sister's son was a thief. That
son lived with his uncle. He was accorded perfect freedom in the
house. He used his uncle's library, and it seemed a perfectly
justifiable suspicion that he had got hold of the cheque-book and
forged that cheque for five hundred pounds, for Mr. Muirhead felt
perfectly certain now that he himself had never drawn the
cheque.</p>

<p>On arriving back in Glasgow, Mr. Muirhead lost no time in
investigating the discrepancies of the books, and he found that his
manager's estimate was understated rather than exaggerated. It was
a terribly serious matter, and it affected him as nothing else in
the whole course of his life had done, with the exception of his
sister's unhappy marriage. It was true that there was no proof that
his nephew was the guilty person, but from the position he held the
opportunity was afforded him of robbing his uncle. The defalcations
were spread over a considerable period, beginning about six months
after Ernest Crossley had entered the business, and the frauds had
been carried out so ingeniously that the risk of
discovery&mdash;for a time, at any rate&mdash;was reduced to a
minimum.</p>

<p>Mr. Muirhead recognised the facts, and he braced him-self up for
an ordeal. He told his nephew one evening after dinner that he had
something to say to him, and they adjourned to the library. If
Ernest had any forethought of what was coming he conducted himself
with wonderful composure. He lit his post-prandial cigar, and
remarked cheerily:</p>

<p>'Well, uncle, what's the business? Nothing serious, I hope?'</p>

<p>Mr. Muirhead was astonished at his nephew's coolness and
composure, for he himself was terribly upset, and betrayed it.</p>

<p>'Yes, I'm grieved to say it is very serious.'</p>

<p>'Oh! I am sorry to hear that.'</p>

<p>'Do you know anything of this cheque?' asked his uncle, as he
placed the five hundred pound cancelled cheque before him and
scanned his face narrowly.</p>

<p>Still smoking composedly, Ernest took the cheque up, and turned
it round about. Then, as he put it on the table again, said with
perfect self-possession&mdash;Nothing whatever. What about it?'</p>

<p>Mr. Muirhead was dumbfounded. If this young man was guilty, then
his power of self-control was absolutely marvellous.</p>

<p>'Well, there is this about it,' said Mr. Muirhead, stumbling in
his speech, and painfully betraying his agitation, 'I don't think I
drew that cheque myself.'</p>

<p>'But it's your signature,' exclaimed the young man, showing more
animation as he examined the cheque again.</p>

<p>'It looks like it,' faltered Muirhead, 'but&mdash;but I don't
think it is.'</p>

<p>'Don't think it is!' echoed the nephew, now displaying
astonishment and keen interest. Then, after a pause, he added, with
significance: 'Uncle, don't you think it would be advisable to take
a longer holiday?'</p>

<p>Mr. Muirhead felt as if a knife had gone through him, and he
really began to think that his mental faculties had become
impaired.</p>

<p>He made some excuse to his nephew, said he thought he would go
away again soon, and got rid of Ernest, who was going to the house
of a neighbour to play a game of billiards.</p>

<p>Muirhead passed a very wretched night. He breathed no word of
his distress to his wife, who regarded Ernest as her own son, and
loved him as such, and her husband, who was not only just but
generous, was willing to bear any amount of suffering himself
rather than pain his wife. The more he dwelt upon the matter,
however, the clearer it became to him that an investigation was
necessary, and he resolved at all hazards to get at the bottom of
the mystery. For several reasons he did not feel competent to do
this himself, and so he sent for Tyler Tatlock, whom he knew
through a friend of his who had availed himself of the detective's
services.</p>

<p>At their first interview Mr. Muirhead, in substance, detailed
the foregoing particulars to Tatlock. 'As it is certain, Mr.
Tatlock,' he went on, 'that a guilty hand and brain have been at
work, the necessity for discovering the hand and brain is
imperative. For my nephew to rest under suspicion, if that
suspicion is not well founded, would be intolerable. But if the lad
is innocent, then we are confronted, I venture to think, with a
more serious aspect of the case.'</p>

<p>Tatlock saw clearly the lights and shades of the peculiar matter
he was called upon to investigate. While family scruples had to be
respected, he was asked to unravel a complicated case of
crime&mdash;crime of a magnitude that seemed to indicate the brain
of a practised criminal. And yet there was one point that struck
him as peculiar, inasmuch as it was clumsily amateurish in one
sense, while in another it was suggestive of deep cunning. The
point was the drawing of the cheque for five hundred pounds payable
to bearer. It was clumsily amateurish, because it might so very,
very easily have led to detection. If the manager at the bank, for
instance, whose suspicions seemed to have been slightly aroused,
had only allowed them to so far take shape as to put a question or
two to the presentee, the whole fraud would probably have been at
once exposed. It was artfully cunning, because whoever drew the
cheque relied upon the probability, if sufficient time elapsed, of
Mr. Muirhead not being able to determine whether he did or did not
sign the cheque. This argued, of course, a thorough knowledge of
Mr. Muirhead's peculiar temperament, and of his absorption in his
hobbies. It was necessarily a rotten reed to bear upon, but the
forger's cunning told him that the reed might prove equal to the
occasion. He chanced, and temporarily triumphed. On the face of it,
every circumstance seemed to fix the guilt on Ernest Crossley. He
had access to his uncle's cheque-book. He knew his uncle's affairs,
and knew that his uncle's standing at the bank, and his reputation
for enthusiasm for his botany and astronomy, would reduce the
probability of his eccentric act in drawing a cheque in such a way
arousing suspicion. And yet in spite of this very strong
circumstantial evidence&mdash;many a man has been hanged on
evidence no stronger&mdash;Tatlock thought that Ernest Crossley did
not draw that cheque.</p>

<p>Tatlock's first effort in the task of unravelling was not so
much to determine if any one else was implicated as to prove
conclusively Ernest Crossley's guilt or innocence. That was
necessary to his uncle's peace of mind. If guilty, the sooner the
truth was known and the wearying suspense ended the better. If
innocent, not a moment should be lost in establishing his
innocence. In broad principle, that was the line upon which Mr.
Muirhead was anxious Tatlock should proceed.</p>

<p>In the initial stage of this inquiry in the Muirhead affair,
Tatlock subjected the forged cheque to a crucial examination, and
he compared the writing on it with various specimens of Crossley's
handwriting. He maintained, and no doubt correctly so, that a
person who forged another person's handwriting, however cleverly it
was done, must betray his own handwriting by some minute signs.</p>

<p>This examination enabled him to determine to his own
satisfaction that Crossley did not forge that cheque. It need
scarcely be said that young Crossley hadn't the remotest idea he
was being shadowed, yet for a period of nearly three weeks his
movements were closely watched. The places he frequented, the
companions whom he associated with, his goings and comings, were
all noted, and known to the man with the small eyes, for Tatlock's
small eyes were almost able to look into or read the thoughts
passing through a person's brain.</p>

<p>Those weeks were weary ones to Mr. Muirhead. He possessed
himself with such patience as he could; but it was terribly trying
to know that one in whom he had reposed trust and confidence, and
upon whom he had lavished affection and tender solicitude, was
lying under the suspicion of being a traitor, a forger, a
thief.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed that, while Tatlock was watching a
certain thing, he had not an eye to possibilities elsewhere. Your
trained hunter does not keep his gaze fixed on one spot, for he
knows that if his prey be not in front it may be behind, and so it
came to pass that Tatlock struck a trail that seemed to promise a
startling development.</p>

<p>Adjoining the grounds in which Mr. Muirhead's house stood was a
miniature glen, through which a tiny stream babbled its way to the
Clyde. Sometimes on summer evenings young couples, to whom the
world was very beautiful, and love an ecstatic dream, lingered
there, and talked the soft nonsense which has been talked since the
human story began. One evening a man and woman stood beneath a tree
in the glen. They were engaged in deep and earnest conversation,
and certain movements on the part of the woman seemed to indicate
that she was much distressed, her distress arising, as indicated by
the man's movement, by some argument on his part urged with a not
too tender regard for her feelings. They were not exactly
quarrelling, but were agitated rather by difference of opinion.
This difference, however, was strong enough to bring the tears to
the woman's eyes, as evidenced by her pressing her handkerchief to
her face. And the man grew impatient. He thrust his hands into his
pockets, and walked away a few yards irritably, only to return
almost immediately, and resume the argument, until suddenly the
woman threw her arms about his neck, as if in passionate appeal,
and he held her and kissed her, and she sobbed audibly. Presently
they separated. The woman moved rapidly up the glen, turning
occasionally to wave her handkerchief to the man, who lingered and
gazed after her, until she was lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>Then he lit a cigar, and by the light of the match revealed his
face, and in a few moments he strolled away in a direction opposite
to that taken by the woman.</p>

<p>That same night, but later, a well-dressed man sat in a private
room of a fashionable restaurant in Glasgow, together with several
other men, and a similar number of women, some of them elegantly
dressed. The party had been indulging in oysters and champagne. The
man referred to was evidently the entertainer&mdash;the host. He
was addressed by his companions as 'Alec.' He was probably a little
under thirty. His face was not altogether pleasant to look upon. It
was sensual, and bore unmistakable signs of late hours, and of
burning the candle at both ends. His eyes, which were brown, were
restless, and he had a habit of glancing furtively about him. His
lips were overhung by a well-trimmed moustache, and he had good
teeth. His face in repose was harsh; it was the face of a selfish,
vain, and cruel man. But he had a strongly fascinating voice. It
was soft and silvery. He was called upon for a song, and he
rendered a Scottish ballad sweetly, tenderly, and with feeling. He
was evidently a force in that little circle. His companions were
deferential to him. The women seemed to vie with each other for his
attention. Without exception, the women were actresses. One or two
of the men were actors, one was a popular music-hall singer, the
others were not so easily classed. Alec, the host, if one judged
him by his clothes, his rings, his heavy watch-chain, might have
been taken for a well-to-do man about town. This Alec was the man
who that same evening had talked to the woman in the glen. Tatlock
had watched him in the glen, and was watching him now.</p>

<p>Adjoining the room in which the party were assembled was another
and smaller room. At the top of the partition that separated the
two was a window. That window afforded the watcher a post of
observation.</p>

<p>Now, Alec&mdash;or, to give him his full name, Mr. Alexander
Finlayson&mdash;was the lessee and manager of a certain music-hall
which made up for in popularity what it lacked in respectability.
This Finlayson was a mystery. He had entered into the music-hall
business only a year previous to this period, and he conducted it
with such lavish expenditure that in spite of its popularity people
wondered how it paid. He had a passion for the company of actors
and actresses, and music-hall people generally, and to them he was
a most liberal entertainer. Although a bachelor, he occupied a
swell house in the West End, and kept half a dozen servants.
Moreover, he had a yacht on the Clyde, and a house at the coast, to
which he was in the habit of taking his friends on Sundays and
holidays. He was essentially a night-bird, and those he associated
with were night-birds, and little was known of his doings in the
day, though it was vaguely rumoured amongst his circle that he had
a profitable engagement to attend to during the hours of
daylight.</p>

<p>At last the time came when Tyler Tatlock, having faithfully and
cleverly carried out his mission, felt he could present a reliable
report to Mr. Muirhead, and one day he and Muirhead sat together in
the latter's library. Tatlock was grave, Muirhead anxious and
excited. The detective had already led up to the main point by some
preliminary conversation, and Mr. Muirhead, allowing his impatience
to overcome him, exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Well, well, but what about my nephew?'</p>

<p>'Your nephew is absolutely innocent.'</p>

<p>'Thank God! thank God!' cried Muirhead with a fervency which
clearly indicated the depth of his feelings, though, alas! the
little ray of sunshine was soon to be blotted out by a heavier
cloud. Tatlock would fain have spared his patron, but the truth had
to be told.</p>

<p>'I am sorry,' he went on, 'that while I am able to exonerate
your nephew, I have some very startling information to give
you.'</p>

<p>'What is it? Don't keep me in suspense. Let me know the
worst.'</p>

<p>'Very well, sir. Although your nephew is innocent your niece is
not, for it was she who forged that cheque for five hundred
pounds.'</p>

<p>'My niece!' gasped Muirhead, as if he were choking. Then he
covered his face with his hands and sobbed. To a man of his
high-strung nervous organisation, his artistic temperament, his
uprightness, and gentleness of disposition, the revelation was a
shock that stunned him.</p>

<p>His niece a thief, a forger! It seemed impossible, and yet it
was true, and what Tatlock had learnt may be epitomised in the
following particulars:</p>

<p>Reference has been made to his comparison of the writing on the
cheque with young Crossley's handwriting, and his conclusion that
Crossley was not the forger. Now, there were two persons in
Muirhead's house besides himself who had access to his private
room. It is not necessary to take Mrs. Muirhead into the
calculation. The two persons were Mary and Ernest Crossley;
therefore, Ernest being innocent, he turned his attention to Mary.
Mr. Muirhead was very much attached to his niece, and, having the
most perfect faith in her, he not only accorded her perfect
liberty, but she did a good deal of secretarial work for him. She
was exceedingly clever with the pen, and a close study of her
writing led Tatlock to believe that she had committed the forgery.
But, if so, why did she do it? The cheque was presented by, and the
money paid to, a woman&mdash;that woman was not Mary Crossley, for
she was well known at the bank, having transacted a good deal of
business there for her uncle. It was impossible, therefore, to
avoid the deduction that a second person was implicated; and this
led to another question. Was there any connection between the
forged cheque and the defalcations at Mr. Muirhead's warehouse? To
the solving of this part of the problem Tatlock brought all his
energies and ability to bear, and as a consequence he ascertained
that Mary had a secret lover, a man named Alexander Finlayson. As
soon as Tatlock gained this knowledge he saw that the key was in
his possession.</p>

<p>Finlayson was a ledger clerk in Mr. Muirhead's employ. He had
been in the service for over fifteen years, and full confidence was
placed in him. He was exceedingly clever at figures, and in his own
particular department he had supreme control. His salary was four
pounds a week. Nevertheless, he was the proprietor of a music-hall,
had a swell west-end house, a house at the coast, a yacht on the
Clyde, and kept several servants. How was it done? Not, surely, on
his salary of four pounds a week. And, despite the fact that he was
leading a fast and shameless life, he was meeting Mary Crossley
secretly in the little glen adjoining her uncle's property, and
Tatlock had seen them meet.</p>

<p>In view of the double life he was leading, and the large income
required to keep up his false position as 'a man about town,' and a
wealthy one, his books at the warehouse were subjected to expert
examination, which brought to light a most ingenious and
complicated system of fraud, whereby he had robbed his employer of
thousands.</p>

<p>When the truth was revealed and the wickedness exposed, Mary
Muirhead was taken to task by her uncle in the presence of Tatlock,
and, though at first sullen and defiant, she broke down and
confessed the part she had played. She had known Finlayson for more
than a year. Mr. Muirhead had given a garden party in his grounds
to the people in his employ. At that party Mary and Finlay-son
became acquainted. He paid much attention to her, and she fell
entirely under his influence.</p>

<p>They corresponded; occasionally she met him in Glasgow, and more
frequently at night in the glen adjoining her uncle's place. So
completely was she fascinated that when one day he pleaded to her
to get him ten pounds, she did it by manipulating her uncle's
accounts. That was the beginning. After that he was constantly
asking her to obtain money for him. As she had control of her
uncle's accounts, she was enabled to do this by presenting him with
duplicate bills and by other means. Finlayson also induced her to
practise her uncle's handwriting and signature, so that she could
copy them. And with what success she did this was proved by the
cheque for five hundred pounds which she gave to Finlayson, and he
sent one of his actress friends to cash it at the bank.</p>

<p>On the night when Tatlock saw him meet Mary in the glen he
endeavoured to persuade his dupe to forge a cheque in her uncle's
name for a thousand pounds. At first she refused; but he overcame
her scruples, and she consented to do it, but was unable to carry
the forgery out, as she found that her uncle now kept his
cheque-book locked up in his safe, and she was sure he had become
suspicious, and this frightened her.</p>

<p>It was a very sad story of a weak woman, who had inherited some
of her father's evil ways, falling into the hands of an
unscrupulous villain, who, discerning the flaw in her nature,
preyed upon it.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be said that Mr. Muirhead was very greatly
affected. The hopes he had built upon his niece were destroyed, his
faith broken, and he bowed like a reed in a storm of wind. Nor did
he ever entirely recover. He was never the same man again. He sent
his niece to Melbourne, where she had a cousin married to a
clergyman, but a very short time afterwards she disappeared, and
went, as was believed, to America. What became of her is not
known.</p>

<p>Much against his will, but from a sense that it was a duty he
owed to society, Mr. Muirhead determined to prosecute his
fraudulent clerk, Alexander Finlayson, for falsifying the accounts
at the warehouse; but the fellow, when he found the game was up,
had the grace to put an end to his shameless career by poisoning
himself as soon as he learnt that his infamy was known.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Muirhead have long been in their graves, and Ernest
Crossley died of consumption about ten years ago; there is,
therefore, no longer any reason for concealing the facts of this
little drama of fraud and frailty and misplaced affection.</p>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>THE GOLD-SEEKER'S STRANGE FATE AN
ASTOUNDING ROMANCE OF REAL LIFE</h2>

<p class="first">
FOR true romance one must search the pages of real life, not the
volumes of fiction. Tyler Tatlock was able to furnish much evidence
of this truth, but in no case that he ever had to do with was it
exemplified in a more startling manner than in that of Dick
Reesland. The Reeslands are an old family. The name appears in
Doomsday Book as Reese-de-land. The branch of the family with which
this record deals had long been resident in a country district in
Yorkshire. Mr. Richard Reesland at one time held an appointment in
the Old East India Company's service, but was forced to retire
early owing to his health breaking down. He returned home and
married a Miss Bindloss, who had a small property. The union
resulted in the birth of a son and two daughters. Mr. Reesland died
while his children were still very young, but their mother was a
sensible and devoted woman, and by studying economy she was enabled
to give them a good education.</p>

<p>From his earliest years Dick, the son, displayed a restless,
discontented, roving spirit, and, being an only boy, he was a good
deal spoilt by his mother. He was a great reader, but beyond that
had no inclination for anything, and as he grew in years he chafed
at the dull, uneventful life he was compelled to lead; before he
was fifteen he displayed such a masterful and determined spirit
that he caused his family much distress, and there were not wanting
signs that he was getting quite out-of-hand, as the saying is.</p>

<p>One lady, who was very intimate with Dick's mother, and who, in
her own estimation, was wondrous wise, declared that she was
perfectly sure the boy would do evil things and come to grief if
not controlled with a strictness which his mother&mdash;according
to this philanthropic lady&mdash;was incapable of displaying. Now,
it was a curious and most fortunate circumstance&mdash;so thought
the lady&mdash;that her 'dear brother' was a clergyman, a worthy,
estimable, and truly pious man, and 'so clever too,' and so fond of
children, and so successful in managing wayward boys, and so many
other things, that really the lady could not enumerate them. But
she was successful in persuading Mrs. Reesland to send her boy to
her dear brother, who was such an encyclopaedia of all the virtues.
The first week that Dick was under his control he took a dislike to
him. In a month he had come to hate him with a hatred passing
words, for the dear brother was one of those incompetent, arrogant,
self-opinionated, dogmatic tyrants, who break the spirit and ruin
the dispositions of nearly every child they have to deal with. Dick
pleaded to his mother to remove him from the influence of this
objectionable teacher, but, thinking it was to the boy's interest
that he should remain, she declined, with the inevitable result in
such cases&mdash;Dick removed himself; and when his people had
passed many agonising months of suspense and fear, a letter came
from him.</p>

<p>He was in Australia, and was working on some gold diggings at a
place called Naraga in the Braidwood district. He was going to make
a rapid fortune, he said, and then he would return home. But five
years drifted away. His fortune had not been made; he did not
return home. At fairly regular intervals he wrote, but seldom twice
from the same place. His letters came from China, Japan, India,
some of the South Sea Islands, New Zealand, California; and the
last one from Australia again. He was then in Melbourne, and said
he was going up country. His letters were always bald and brief,
and seldom contained anything about himself beyond that he had been
somewhere and was going somewhere else.</p>

<p>Years passed, and nothing more was heard of him; then, by the
death of an uncle, he succeeded to a large property, which, failing
him, would pass to another branch of the family altogether. Now, as
may be supposed, his mother&mdash;then growing an old
woman&mdash;apart from her natural desire to once more clasp her
long-absent son to her bosom before she laid down the burden of
life, was anxious that he should take possession of the property to
which he was legally en-titled. It was important, also, in the
interest of all concerned, that, if dead, indisputable proof of his
death should be forthcoming. Strangely enough, however, his mother
firmly believed that he was still living; and when repeated
advertising failed to bring forth any information, she resolved on
the bold step of enlisting the services of Tyler Tatlock. It was a
bold step, because if Tatlock had to go forth and hunt for the
trail of the wanderer, it would necessarily be costly, and might be
long. As a matter of fact, the task occupied Tatlock a good deal
over a year. The great interests that were at stake, however,
justified all the expense incurred and the time employed.</p>

<p>Tatlock journeyed direct from England to Melbourne, that being
the last place from which Dick had communicated with his friends.
He had given an address in Collins Street. It proved to be a
lodging-house kept by very respectable people. Dick had stayed
there several times. The landlady seemed to think he was
peculiar.</p>

<p>He had stated before leaving Melbourne that he was going to
Sydney, and, as he was expecting some letters, he gave his address,
which turned out to be a lodging-house in Elizabeth Street. When
Tatlock arrived his man had gone, his destination being Brisbane.
He had incidentally mentioned to a fellow-boarder in Sydney that he
was going north from Brisbane. To go north from there meant either
to foot it or to travel by one of the coasting steamers, many of
which went to Torres Straits, while some crossed the Straits to New
Guinea. To Brisbane Tatlock went, only to find that he was a day
too late again, and that a stern chase was a long chase. He
ascertained, however, that Dick Reesland had taken passage in a
coasting tramp, and booked to Cook-town, which is in the Cape York
Peninsula. Tatlock had to kick his heels for a fortnight before he
could get a steamer bound north, as there was only a monthly
service in those days; and to his intense annoyance, while going
into Rockhampton, the vessel ran on to a reef. She floated off
again with the rising tide, but sustained such damage that ten days
were occupied in repairing it. Bad weather had set in when the
journey was resumed, and the passage north was long and stormy.
Cooktown was reached at last. It was a wild place, far removed from
civilisation. Gold in considerable quantities had been found in the
neighbourhood, and there was a sparse population, consisting for
the most part of gold-diggers. The climate is tropical, the country
wild and barren.</p>

<p>Tatlock learned that Dick, who was well known, was a partner
with three other men in a quartz reef fifty to sixty miles inland.
Out to the reef Tatlock journeyed, only to find that once more he
was a day too late; his man had moved on, nor did it seem likely
that he would be able to follow him further, for his movements were
evidently shrouded in mystery. His partners were reticent, and were
not to be drawn, while the statement that their chum had come into
a fortune seemed rather to annoy them than otherwise. Indeed, they
did not disguise the fact that they resented Tatlock's presence,
and it became evident to him that in that wild and lawless region a
bullet might put an end to his further usefulness, since he was
regarded as an intruder, and the rough characters who were
fossicking around had a summary manner of dealing with intruders.
To be shot like a dog and buried like a dog could serve no purpose,
but Tatlock was not the man to be easily beaten. He might not be a
match for the brute force which appeared to be the only law there,
but he was infinitely more than a match when it came to a question
of diplomacy, and so he deter-mined to retire, for a time at any
rate, to Cooktown, and to watch and wait.</p>

<p>The youngest of Dick's three partners was a Chinaman known as
Loo Foo. This placid-faced Celestial could have given points to
Bret Harte's 'Heathen Chinee.' He was as sly as they are made, and
what he did not know in the way of wickedness was scarcely worth
considering. It was obvious that the two white men with whom he
worked did not love him too well, but Loo not only knew how to hold
his own but he was in his way a little despot, and was possessed of
some knowledge which gave him a certain power over his white mates.
To the observant Tatlock this was plain, and he came to the
conclusion that he might learn a good deal by watching Loo Foo.</p>

<p>The small settlement at Cooktown was in close touch with the
diggings, as it was at Cooktown the stores were purchased and the
gold shipped. The chief store in the settlement was in the hands of
a Chinaman, Wing Lo by name, who sold most things required, and,
unless he was much maligned, stole things whenever he got the
chance. He also called himself a 'shipping agent, importer,
exporter, contractor,' and Heaven knows what else. A smug-faced,
wily demon was Wing Lo, and with his small eyes Tyler Tatlock saw
there was something mysterious going on between Wing and Loo and
the other partners of Dick Reesland.</p>

<p>One day three heavily-laden bullock drays entered the settlement
from inland, and rounded up with a creak and a groan at Wing Lo's
store. There were sacks filled with something, roughly made and
heavy cases, and irregularly-shaped bundles. To a non-observant
person these little details would have had no meaning. To Tatlock
they were significant. 'Inland' was a wilderness. Men had recently
brought gold to light, but beyond that Nature had remained
undisturbed through the ages. A bee-line through this wilderness
from Cooktown for about three hundred miles in length would strike
a desolate spot on the eastern shores of the great Gulf of
Carpentaria. Now, the question that naturally occurred to Tatlock's
mind was&mdash;What did these queer-looking packages contain, and
where had they come from? Save for the rough diggers and
prospectors scattered about inland there was no population. The
packages could not be filled with gold; what then were their
contents? There was something suspicious about the whole affair,
and the suspicion was not allayed when within an hour of the
arrival of the drays came Loo Foo and his two white companions on
horseback, and during the days that followed they and Wing Lo were
very busy. A week later a coasting steamer from the north, and
bound to Sydney, came in, and Wing Lo shipped the goods that had
come from the interior, and consigned them to an agent in
Sydney.</p>

<p>Tatlock had an instinctive feeling that those mysterious
packages which were swung on board the steamer contained the key to
the mystery, and he resolved to follow the packages, so he quietly
slipped on board an hour or so before the vessel resumed her
voyage, and in due course reached Sydney once more. He discovered
that the goods were consigned to a Chinese firm in
Sydney&mdash;'Shen, Yen, and Co., exporters and general dealers,'
and that the mysterious bales and cases were filled with gold and
silver articles, ivory goods, great quantities of silk, boxes of
tea, bags of rice, and many other Chinese products. Now Tatlock
knew quite well that silk, tea, rice, and the like were not grown
on the Cape York peninsula, and the matter therefore required
further investigation, so back he went to Cooktown, as being a
convenient point of observation, but this time he went as somebody
else.</p>

<p>During his stay he had learnt much; he was an apt pupil and
quick to gather up ideas, and when he returned it was as a
'fossicker,' prospector, gold-digger. His capacity for assimilating
himself to the character he adopted was simply marvellous. He was
not only a born actor, but an exceptionally clever mimic. So when
he once more appeared at Cooktown he had unkempt hair, wore
mole-skin trousers tucked into Wellington boots, a blue flannel
shirt, a soft felt slouched hat. On his back he carried his swag,
which, besides the inevitable red blanket and 'billy,' included
pickaxe, shovel, hammer, &amp;c. And he talked digger language, and
bounced and hinted at the rich claims he had been on, but an
irresistible desire to rove prevented his staying long anywhere. He
hired a Chinese loafer who hung about the wharf always on the
look-out for a job he hoped would never come. But for three dollars
a week and his grub he condescended to become Jack Coney's 'boy.'
Jack Coney, otherwise Tyler Tatlock, next invested in a dray, a
couple of horses, a tent, and other necessary paraphernalia for a
life in the wilderness, then he set forth towards the interior with
his Chinese attendant, Woon. When he arrived at the reef where Loo
Foo and his white companions were at work, he fraternised, he
talked in digger language, and appeared learned as regards quartz
and alluvial cradling and washing, crushing and separating.</p>

<p>Loo Foo and his mates thought Jack Coney a bit of a gasser, but
he knew a thing or two, and though he wasn't very big he was
slippery, and could handle the shooting-irons. He was a bit too
curious and inquisitive for their liking, and poked his nose where
he had no business to do. They didn't admit his right to inquire
what the old packing cases lying about were there for, nor why they
kept a wooden shanty at their claims so carefully guarded and
locked. However, all's well that ends well. The gassy little chap
announced his intention of moving on. So they liquored up, said 'So
long,' and 'Jack' and his 'boy' moved off west. He was surprised to
find there was a good track, and this seemed to confirm certain
suspicions he had in his mind. He followed the track, and in due
time came to the southern end of the Gulf of Carpentaria. He was
not surprised to find a long, low, rough log building and three or
four pigtails loafing about. He had got on very good terms with his
'boy' Woon, who was a rascal, but useful. He didn't like work, so
'Jack Coney' took good care that he should have little to do, and
he did like dollars, and Jack was liberal in that respect. You see,
he had to use Woon as eyes and cars, and it was astonishing how
much he saw and heard through that medium. Jack shifted his tent
almost daily. He was supposed to be prospecting, but he slept with
one eye open, as the saying is.</p>

<p>When he had been in the neighbourhood a fortnight, he one
morning saw a rakish-looking brig with a sharp prow and a low
freeboard standing in towards the shore under a pressure of canvas.
Her hull was painted slate colour, very unusual, and there was
something about her which suggested that she was not altogether a
peaceful trader. She made signals to the shore, and the signals
were answered by the pigtails. She was very smartly handled, and
her crew evidently knew their business. When within a mile and a
half of the shore, her sails having previously been clewed up, she
let go her anchor, and afterwards a boat was lowered and manned,
and the skipper, a bronzed, bearded, rough, determined-looking
fellow, sat in the stern, and was rowed to the shore. There he had
a conference with the guardian pigtails, and soon the brig's boats
were busy conveying a very miscellaneous lot of goods to the shore,
and as they arrived they were quickly stored in the log cabin.</p>

<p>The following day 'Jack Coney' appeared upon the scene, and
requested to have a word with the skipper, who was a white man, as
was his chief mate, while the rest of the crew were Chinamen. The
captain was known to his crew as 'Bill,' and Bill
only&mdash;'Captain Bill.' It was quite enough for them. But 'Tyler
Tatlock when alone with him said:</p>

<p>'Unless I am very much mistaken, I am addressing Dick
Reesland.'</p>

<p>Captain Bill looked savage, and exclaimed hotly, 'No, you are
not.'</p>

<p>Tatlock smiled as he answered: 'I am certain of it now.'</p>

<p>'And in the name of the fiend who are you?' demanded the
skipper, as he twisted his fingers about the butt of a
revolver.</p>

<p>Tatlock smiled again. 'An emissary who brings you good news. I
have come from England on purpose to find you, and I've had a long
search.'</p>

<p>'And what's the good news?' asked the skipper eagerly.</p>

<p>'Ah, then you are Dick Reesland?'</p>

<p>'Oh, well, since you seem to know me&mdash;Yes. Now, then,
what's your business?'</p>

<p>It did not take Tatlock long to make known the tidings of which
he was the bearer, and the sea-smitten, sun-parched salt, Captain
Dick Reesland, seemed much troubled, and for some time he remained
thoughtful. At last he spoke.</p>

<p>'As you are a detective, and have so cleverly found me out, I
suppose you know pretty well what I am. I'm part owner of yonder
brig. I'm a ruffian, and my co-partners are ruffians; my crew are
devils. We are not legitimate traders, but pirates. Yes, sir,
pirates; and we scour these Eastern seas; but we find our victims
mostly amongst Chinese coasting vessels, and we get some rich
hauls. I do not follow the calling for the sake of the pelf; but
the life, the risk, the danger, the excitement appeal to me. Now,
the fortune you have come to tell me about does not tempt me, and
were it for that alone I do not think I would leave this
fascinating calling of mine; but I owe my dear mother something.
For her sake I will return. You go back to Cooktown, where I will
rejoin you.'</p>

<p>'Can I depend upon your doing that?'</p>

<p>'Sir, if you think my honour is worth anything, I will pledge my
honour.'</p>

<p>'I accept the pledge. Give me your hand. I will wait in Cooktown
for you.'</p>

<p>'Of course, it may be weeks before we meet, for I have many
arrangements to make.'</p>

<p>'I quite understand that.'</p>

<p>So they parted, and 'Jack Coney,' with Woon his boy, slowly made
his way back to Cooktown, where he let it be known that his
prospecting had not resulted in much. But he thought he would have
another try, and go further north. He was in no hurry, however, and
people came to the conclusion that he certainly was not, for the
weeks slipped by and stretched into months, and still he lingered
in the little town. He himself began to think that Dick had played
false in spite of his pledged honour. Then a rumour ran that there
had been a murder in the interior. Some Chinese diggers had
murdered a white man. So said the rumour. A day or two afterwards
this was modified. The white man had been shot, but was still
living. And yet another version of the story was put in
circulation. The white man had not been shot at all, but had shot
several Chinamen, and had escaped into the bush, and nobody knew
what had become of him.</p>

<p>These contradictory reports will serve to show the difficulty
there was in obtaining reliable information from the interior. That
there was foundation, however, for the rumours was proved one day
by Skipper Bill, or Dick Reesland, coming into the town in a bad
way. There was a feverish anxiety to learn news, but Skipper Bill
was exasperating beyond endurance. He smiled a ghastly smile when
plied with questions, and said he had nothing to tell.</p>

<p>Privately to Tatlock he gasped, 'Yes, the fiends tried to murder
me when they heard I was going. Exasperation and a fear that I
might betray them drove them wild, and they peppered me. I'm tough,
and take a lot of killing, like a cat. But I've got a bullet in my
left lung, and I fancy the last chapter is nearly written. Get me
down to Sydney as soon as you can. Possibly the hospital people
there will be able to fish the bullet out.'</p>

<p>Two days after this Dick Reesland and Tyler Tatlock sailed away
in a southern-bound steamer. It was evident that Dick was in a very
bad way indeed, and Tatlock was afraid he would not even live to
get to Sydney. When they had left Cooktown well behind, Dick told
his companion that it was Loo Foo who had shot him. Loo was a
deeply-dyed villain, and had a large interest in the pirate
business, as well as in the quartz reef. He had established
agencies for the sale of the pirates' cargoes in Brisbane, Sydney,
and Melbourne. When Dick told him he was going away Foo feared that
his profitable trade would be gone. A quarrel ensued, and Foo
winged his man.</p>

<p>'And what did you do?' asked Tatlock.</p>

<p>'Killed him,' answered Dick, with a wan smile.</p>

<p>'A pleasant state of things,' remarked Tatlock reflectively.</p>

<p>'Oh, that's the beauty of a free life, where the only law you
recognise is the law of powder and shot. It's the only life worth
living. The sky above you, the desert or wilderness around you, or
the salt spray of the great ocean saturating every pore in your
body. I am returning to the commonplaceness of civilisation simply
because my mother's voice has spoken. But&mdash;ah, yes; you bet it
won't be long before I return to freedom.'</p>

<p>Dick talked hopefully, but it was clear to Tatlock that he was
drifting out, and it seemed doubtful if he would last until Sydney
was reached. As he himself had said, however, he was tough, and
took a lot of killing. Ninety-nine per cent. of men wounded as he
was must have succumbed long ago, but he lingered, and, though
suffering great agony, he uttered no groan.</p>

<p>Sydney was reached at last; he was carried ashore and to the
hospital, and the doctors at once pronounced the case hopeless, as
he was too low for an operation to be attempted, but it was
marvellous how tough he really proved. For three weeks after
arriving in Sydney he wrestled with death. He was cheerful and
communicative, and piece by piece, chapter by chapter, as it were,
Tatlock gathered from his own lips the following strange story of
his life:</p>

<p>He had been cowboy in America; lumberman in Canada. He had
served before the mast, and sailed in every sea. In Texas he had
fought a lassoo fight with a human scourge, who bore the reputation
of having committed a score of murders, and Dick killed his man,
for which he was presented with an address and a purse of gold. In
Mexico he married a Mexican beauty, in spite of the threats of a
rival. Three months later the rival carried off the bride, and left
the husband for dead, with a knife sticking in him. But Dick was
walking about again, sound and well, a month later. In Cuba he
placed himself at the head of a band of insurgents five hundred
strong, and he held a village for a fortnight against thousands of
Spanish soldiers. A price was set upon his head, but a Cuban belle
had fallen in love with him, and guided him for nights and days
through swamps and jungles, and nursed him for weeks through the
delirium of fever. Finally they escaped, and got to Jamaica, in the
West Indies, where the devoted preserver of his life died.</p>

<p>For a short time he was manager of a West Indian cotton
plantation, and again came within an ace of losing his life. He was
one day bitten in the arm by one of the most deadly snakes in the
West Indies&mdash;the fer-de-lance. But he had a flask of gunpowder
in his pocket. Without a moment's hesitation he poured a quantity
of the powder on the wound and fired it. It was a heroic remedy. It
made him very ill, but saved his life. After that he turned his
back on the West Indies, and sailed to Boston. There he shipped in
a South Sea whaler, and put in two years, but cleared out at
Honolulu, as the skipper was a tyrant. He next turned up in New
Zealand, and went prospecting in the 'Snowy Range,' and discovered
a gold mine, which he sold to a syndicate, and moved on.</p>

<p>Melbourne knew him next, but the hot and dusty town had no
charms for him, so he organised a small expedition, numbering
twenty all told, to go prospecting in New Guinea, and they
chartered a schooner to take them to their destination. They were
wrecked on a reef, however. They lost everything, as well as half
their number, who were drowned. He returned to Melbourne, and
shortly afterwards got a passage in a steamer going to Shanghai,
where he fell ill with cholera, but pulled through all right, and a
rebellion being in full blast he joined the rebel ranks, and had a
glorious time for something like six months, until he was captured
by the Imperialists and sent to Amoy, where he was to be
decapitated. But General Gordon came to his rescue, and on the
grounds that he was an Englishman secured his release. For some
time after that he wandered about China with no very definite
purpose, only he liked to be moving about. One day he found himself
at Pekin, went down to Tientsin on the coast, and secured a passage
in a Chinese boat going to Shanghai, but fell in with pirates, who
killed the crew, but took him prisoner, he being a white man, and
they expected that his friends would ransom him. They carried him
inland, and when he declined to give the address of any of his
friends they tortured him. He managed to escape, and made his way
to Hong Kong, where he shipped in a trader for the Philippines, but
once again was wrecked. He spent eight days in an open boat in a
tropical sea, with five others, and endured the most terrible
sufferings. He and one other, the sole survivors of the crew, were
picked up by a passing steamer, and carried to Borneo.</p>

<p>For a short time he became a sort of overseer on a guttapercha
estate. But it was too monotonous, and he wanted to move on again.
He got a passage in a native trader going to New Guinea for a cargo
of cocoanuts and native pottery. He spent two months in that
wonderful island; was one day captured by cannibals, and was about
to be speared for the pot, when he seized a native club from one of
his captors, ran amuck amongst them, got down to the coast, and was
taken aboard a beche de mer fishing vessel, which transferred him
to a pearler that subsequently landed him at Cooktown. A great many
Chinamen had flocked there, owing to rumours of gold in the
interior. He went out prospecting with Loo Foo and two other white
men. They were not very successful; then it occurred to the
ingenious mind of Loo Foo that there was good business to be done
by preying on Chinese coasters. He proposed it to Dick, who fell in
with the idea, for it would keep him moving and afford him the
excitement he craved for. They scraped enough money together to buy
a small brig, and Loo Foo, who was a born administrator, set about
organising the business. Dick knew nothing about business. He hated
it, but he could navigate a vessel with any one, and fighting was
as the breath of his nostrils.</p>

<p>For a long time the business flourished. By bringing the plunder
into the Gulf of Carpentaria, and taking it across the peninsula to
Cooktown, where Foo had his spies and agents, they managed to
escape detection, which would have been certain had they sailed
their vessel into any regular port. How long this state of matters
would have gone on it is difficult to say had Tatlock not appeared
upon the scene. Sooner or later no doubt the authorities must have
become suspicious. As it was, Loo Foo brought about the climax.
Naturally when he heard that Dick was going he was furious, for
Dick was an essential link in the chain. When persuasion, argument,
and even threats failed, he began to fear for his own skin, and on
the principle that dead men tell no tales he tried to quieten Dick.
He succeeded in putting a bullet into his lung, but got one through
his own brain in return, which stretched him low at once. Dick's
marvellous vitality enabled him to stave off the inevitable for
weeks, but he was conquered at last, and one night, as the darkness
was giving place to dawn, he passed.</p>

<p>Tatlock returned to England. His mission was fulfilled; and
though he did not restore the wandering and erring son to the
anxious and yearning mother, he carried with him a will which the
dying man had legally executed, and which prevented the greater
portion of the property from passing out of his branch of the
family. Moreover, Tatlock learned one of the strangest human
stories that have ever been told; while as a feat in the art of
detection the way in which he traced the wanderer is perhaps
unparalleled.</p>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>WITH A PASSING GLORY</h2>

<p class="first">
'GENTLEMEN, I have no hesitation in saying that in all
probability our property will prove of unparalleled richness, and
those who hold shares in this company will have cause to
congratulate themselves. You have heard the report of our engineer
at the works. Nothing could be more satisfactory, and, though we
have only been incorporated a little over four months, everything
points to the prospects of speedy dividends. Necessarily to me it
is a source of deep gratification, as your chairman, that I am able
to place before you such glowing accounts&mdash;accounts which,
from personal knowledge, I think I may venture to say are in every
way justified. And now I have another pleasurable duty to perform,
and one that I hope will meet with your approbation. I have secured
the refusal for two months of about two hundred and fifty acres of
land immediately adjoining our present property. Beneath this land
there are possibly tons of gold waiting our energy and enterprise
to bring from the darkness, in which it has lain since the
beginning of time, to the light of day. This land belonged to a
Mexican, who sold it recently to a small syndicate. This syndicate,
however, is practically in the Bankruptcy Court, but they have
given me the option of their property. Now, gentlemen, I have paid
a deposit on this property, and I propose to at once form a new
company to take it over and exploit it, and I am of opinion that we
shall prove it to be as rich or even richer than our present
possession. Before the shares are offered in the new company to the
general public, I think it but right that you should have the
privilege of subscribing, and with that end in view I have arranged
that everyone present can, before he leaves the room, sign a
provisional document pledging himself as many shares as he thinks
proper, subject to the company being formed.</p>

<p>It now remains for me to congratulate you on the rosy prospects
of our enterprise; and I express the hope that when I next have the
pleasure of meeting you I shall be able to announce a substantial
dividend on our first year's working. (Loud and prolonged
cheering.)</p>

<p>'A vote of thanks terminated the proceedings, which throughout
were most harmonious, and the general feeling was that the company
had acquired a very substantial property. We understand that the
shares are already at a premium. A large proportion of the capital
for the purchase of the adjoining property referred to by the
chairman in his speech was promised before the shareholders left
the room.'</p>

<p>The above is an extract from a report in a financial paper of
the statutory meeting of the shareholders in the 'Great Golden
Reefs Mines and Land Exploration Company, Limited,' whose
registered capital was half a million of money, the whole of which
had been subscribed. The property was situated somewhere in
California, and the chairman and managing director was a gentleman
bearing the picturesque name of Josiah Woodfield Bell Flowers. This
gentleman, whose appearance was as picturesque as his name, had
burst upon London like a meteor. What his origin was, where the
came from, what his connections were, nobody seemed to know, and
nobody seemed disposed to ask. Tall, handsome, well-proportioned,
and of an age when a man&mdash;not a born fool&mdash;is supposed to
have acquired wisdom, and in addition possessed of a beautiful
voice, an insinuating and apparently frank, artless man, Mr.
Flowers speedily won the favour of all with whom he came in
contact. Ladies vowed he was 'charming,' and 'such a nice man,'
with strong emphasis on the adjective, while men declared him to be
'a jolly good fellow.'</p>

<p>Mr. Bell Flowers had come over to begrimed, fog-sodden, and
benighted London from the rich, glowing, sun-baked lands of
California, and the tales he had to tell of the potential wealth of
certain regions he had explored, and in which he had acquired
proprietarial and mining rights, set the silly Cockneys agape; and
when, with true American philanthropy, he offered his properties
for the public benefit subject to the condition that the trifle of
half a million pounds sterling was subscribed in shares, of which
he as vendor would accept the nominal sum of two hundred and fifty
thousand pounds, and with the American aptitude for tall talk he
spoke of wealth beyond the dreams of avarice, the grateful public
flocked to him like sheep, and baaed in chorus&mdash;'Give us of
your shares. Here are our purses and cheque-books.' Widows and
parsons struggling to live respectably on a bare pittance felt that
their chance had come at last, and figuratively they threw their
money at the head of Mr. Josiah Woodfield Bell Flowers, who was
'such a nice man.'</p>

<p>Mr. Bell Flowers, as such a noble-minded benefactor had a right
to do, set himself up a superb mansion in the neighbourhood of Hyde
Park, and his palatial residence was ordered in a way that befitted
a financial king. Here he gave superb entertainments, and here
Mammon worshippers, My Lord This and My Lady That, with an army of
their followers, assembled and did honour to their god.</p>

<p>The additional company to which Mr. Bell Flowers referred at the
above-mentioned meeting was duly floated, with a capital of three
hundred thousand pounds. It was known as 'The Golden Reefs Mines
Extension.' Mr. Flowers received a handsome proportion of this, and
was elected chairman by an obedient board of guinea-pigs.</p>

<p>Mr. Bell Flowers, being rich, handsome, and still on the right
side of the hill of life, and a bachelor to boot, was, as may well
be supposed, an object of intense interest to mammas who had
unmarried daughters on their hands. These dames hovered around him
like flies around a sugar-tub. Mr. Bell Flowers showed that he was
susceptible to female charms, for he said pretty things to all of
the young ladies, and he gave them lollipops and trinkets, and set
many a foolish heart throbbing wildly. But at last it leaked out
that this golden god had deigned to smile sweetly on pretty little
Sophie Clarges, the only daughter of Mr. 'Jack' Clarges, who was
reputed to have made an enormous fortune by Stock Exchange
speculations. At any rate, he lived in a very snug little house in
fashionable Park Lane, and his wife entertained in a princely
way.</p>

<p>Sophie was young&mdash;about two-and-twenty&mdash;and, while not
exactly a beauty, she was passably fair. But anything she lacked
physically was more than amply compensated for by the fortune her
father had promised to settle upon her, and which was reputed to be
the goodly sum of a million pounds. Mr. Jack Clarges' beginnings
had been very humble, according to accounts. His father had worked
in a coal mine, and so did Jack in his youth, but he was of an
ambitious turn of mind, and, leaving the mines, had worked his way
up, and finally made his pile on the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>Mr. Bell Flowers and Mr. Jack Clarges became familiar, and while
Jack was not particularly anxious for his daughter to marry anyone,
thought it might not be a bad thing if she became the wife of
Flowers. However, he did not urge it, nor did he oppose it. He was
a good, easy-going sort of fellow, who liked good company and good
living, and was not disposed to trouble or concern himself much
about anything. His wife, however, was a lady of a very different
stamp. Being somewhat coarse, a little vulgar, and somewhat
indifferent about the use of the letter 'h,' she found
herself&mdash;in spite of her wealth&mdash;shut off from that
exclusive section of society which prides itself on its blue blood,
and which shudders at the mere thought of mingling this blue blood
with the red of the mere plebeian. She was designing, however, and
saw that the dashing, tactful, and pushing Bell Flowers was enabled
to pass the gate at which she, like the Peri at the gate of
Paradise, could only sit and sigh. So she resolved that her Sophie
should become Mrs. Bell Flowers.</p>

<p>Sophie was a dutiful daughter enough, greatly attached to her
father, and tolerant of her mother. She had given her heart to a
worthy young gentleman of the name of Robert Lacy Eccles, son of a
gentleman who had distinguished himself as an officer in the army,
but had died wretchedly poor, and left his family&mdash;a large
one&mdash;utterly unprovided for. Robert, who had been educated at
one of the great public schools, took to journalism, and had
written a couple of novels, one of which had brought him a certain
amount of fame. But Bob was poor, was without influence, and, as it
seemed to Mrs. Clarges, never likely to gain a footing within that
magic circle for which she yearned. So Mrs. Clarges said unto her
daughter:</p>

<p>'Sophie, let us have no more nonsense with that vulgar and
penniless fellow, Eccles. Ugh! Only to think he should ever have
had the audacity to suppose for a moment I should sanction his
courting you. I can't imagine how your father ever encouraged him
to come to the house. But, there, your father always was stupid,
and he seems to think that because Robert holds some obscure
position on the "Daily Snarler" he might be of use. It makes me
angry to think your father is so low in his tastes. I wish he'd
some of my pride, I'm sure. However, Robert shall not come here any
more. I have higher aims for you, and you will give every
encouragement to dear Mr. Flowers. A nicer gentleman I am sure I
wouldn't wish to meet. He's so rich, too, and then he has such
influence in society.'</p>

<p>'But, ma,' pleaded her daughter meekly, 'how do you know that
Mr. Flowers thinks anything about me?'</p>

<p>'How do I know? Well, upon my soul, child, you would make a
saint swear. How do I know, indeed? What do you think I am? Do you
think I am so blind that I cannot see? It would be a clever man, my
dear, that would deceive me, I can tell you. Why, I can read Mr.
Flowers as if he were an open book. He is just breaking his heart
about you, and you've only got to play your cards right to secure
him.'</p>

<p>Sophie sighed 'heigho,' silently. She had never opposed her own
wishes to those of her parents, and she hadn't the moral courage to
do so in this instance. Of course, there had been nothing like an
engagement between her and Robert, but she liked him ever so much,
and she was perfectly well aware that he was just breaking his
heart about her.</p>

<p>It was not many days after that conversation with her mother
that she and Bob met. When he treated her with the familiarity of
old, and showed in a thousand little ways how precious she was in
his sight, she gave him to understand&mdash;not without an
effort&mdash;that their 'flirtation,' as she called it, must end.
They parted, and many weeks passed. Bob had been very foolish
during those weeks. He sought for Lethe where men with sorrows
often seek it, when one night in a billiard-room an intimate
suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Oh, by the way, Bob, I heard to-day that the girl you used to
spoon, Sophie Clarges, is going to marry Bell Flowers, the
millionaire.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' was all that Bob said, but in it he expressed a great
volume of feeling.</p>

<p>Some days later he was in the City, and he dropped into Mr.
Clarges' office. Clarges liked him, and was always glad to see
him.</p>

<p>'I suppose,' said Bob, 'I must congratulate you.'</p>

<p>'On what?'</p>

<p>'Well, I hear that your daughter is engaged to Mr. Bell
Flowers.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes. Well, these things get fixed up somehow. Women folk,
you know, are kittle cattle. I suppose my missus has had a finger
in that pie.'</p>

<p>'But do you mean to say Sophie is only going to marry him
because her mother wishes it?'</p>

<p>'My dear Eccles, do you suppose that Sophie would be likely to
marry a man she didn't care about? No, she's not built that way, my
friend. Though I haven't been consulted in the matter, I shall
throw no obstacle in the girl's way. She's plenty of common sense,
and I've all along resolved that I would never try to influence her
choice. I used to think at one time she'd rather a sneaking regard
for you, but I suppose I was wrong.'</p>

<p>Eccles wilted, as it were, at this remark, and he asked in a
manner which seemed to imply that the subject had no interest for
him:</p>

<p>'If that had proved to have been the case what would you have
said?'</p>

<p>'I've just told you, my boy, I should never stand in the way of
the girl's happiness. If she wanted you, and you wanted her, you
should have her as far as I am concerned. But, you see, she wants
Flowers; so there's an end of the matter. It will be a marriage
after my wife's own heart, for I believe she has set her mind on
Flowers.'</p>

<p>Robert Eccles gulped down a rising sob, and as he was shaking
his friend's hand preparatory to going, he said:</p>

<p>'I suppose Mr. Bell Flowers is all right?'</p>

<p>Robert didn't know himself what induced him to make that remark.
It slipped out. It rose in his mind suddenly, and it was uttered as
it came. Perhaps it was the mere expression of some vague and
shapeless thought which had haunted him. Bell Flowers' name had
been before the public for a year or two. He was a
much-talked-about man, and, of course, like all men who make
themselves conspicuous by success, he had his enemies, for envy and
jealousy are powerful factors in the human sum, and malice had
shown itself, and some people had dared to hint that the rosy
things which had been said about Mr. Flowers' mining properties
were not justified.</p>

<p>Mr. Flowers' prospective father-in-law looked at the questioner
in a puzzled way at first, then angrily, and he said with unusual
warmth:</p>

<p>'What the deuce do you mean?'</p>

<p>Bob apologised, but Mr. Clarges was not satisfied. 'Do you know
anything against Flowers?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Have you heard anything?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Then what's the drift of your remark?'</p>

<p>'Nothing.'</p>

<p>'Now, look here, young Eccles, don't you play with me. I'm a
plain, blunt man, as you know, and I'm straight, I am. Now, if Bell
Flowers isn't straight I would rather put Sophie into her coffin
than she should marry him; so, if you know anything, be frank.'</p>

<p>'Upon my honour, I don't, Mr. Clarges.'</p>

<p>'Then what the deuce do you mean, sir, by your cowardly
insinuation?'</p>

<p>It was no insinuation. I&mdash;I&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I consider it a beastly low action for one man to try and
besmirch another out of pure spite. I had no idea you were a fellow
of that sort. You've shown yourself in a new light, and you will be
good enough to avoid my house and my people in the future. Good day
to you.'</p>

<p>Robert Eccles never quite knew how he got out of that office,
but he found himself in the street, being hurried along by the
human tide. His head was in a whirl; he was sick at heart. He had
eaten of Dead Sea fruit, and there was an exceeding bitterness
within him. He had loved Sophie and lost her, and now he had
offended his best friend.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarges' anger was not appeased for some time. Although a
plain and blunt man he had pride, and his pride was wounded. When
he went home he could not rest until he had told his wife what had
passed between him and Robert. She was furious. She said some very
harsh and bitter things about young Eccles. He was a 'sneak,' 'a
deceitful, nasty fellow,' that's what he was. And according to her
estimate Mr. Flowers was perfect, a gentleman with a great and
goodly mind, and when he became her son-in-law she would feel that
her cup of happiness was full.</p>

<p>His wife's strength of language somehow jarred on Mr. Clarges'
nerves. He was silent, and he asked himself: 'Is Bell Flowers all
right?'</p>

<p>The question reminded him that he knew absolutely nothing of
Flowers' origin, and he had heard expressions in the City far from
complimentary to Mr. Flowers, owing to his very roseate description
of the 'Great Golden Reefs' property not having been justified. In
fact, now that Mr. Clarges came to think of it, there seemed to be
a great deal of mystery about the Golden Reefs. No reports were
forth-coming. Nothing had been earned, and as far as could be
ascertained not an ounce of gold had been abstracted.</p>

<p>In the meantime the subject of Mr. Clarges' meditations
continued to flourish, but as the days passed Clarges could not
help having the feeling that he had been somewhat lax in his duty.
Although he tried to deafen himself to them, those words of Robert
Eccles rang in his ears: 'I suppose Mr. Bell Flowers is all right?'
And other questions rose in his own mind. 'Who was Mr. Bell
Flowers? Where did he come from? Who were his people? Was there any
absolute proof that the properties he sold for such an enormous sum
were worth a five-pound note?'</p>

<p>Mr. Clarges had shown strong anger to Bob Eccles, and had
severed the friendly connection between them; but, after all,
wasn't Bob's remark a perfectly justifiable one, for Bell Flowers
was a mystery. The result of these cogitations on Mr. Clarges' part
was that, impelled by something he could not quite understand, and
influenced by a feeling he could not resist, he went down one
morning to the office of Tyler Tatlock, and sought a private
interview with the famous detective. He made himself known, and the
detective intimated that by repute his visitor was no stranger to
him.</p>

<p>'You will appreciate my position, then,' continued Clarges, 'and
still more so when I tell you that my only daughter, who is as the
apple of my eye, is about to be married to a very well-known
gentleman; but, but&mdash;the fact is&mdash;well&mdash;you see it's
this way, I&mdash;I sus&mdash;No, I won't say that, but my
prospective son-in-law is rather a reticent man, and never talks
about his past. I&mdash;I&mdash;'</p>

<p>Understanding his visitor's embarrassment, the detective came to
his assistance with the remark:</p>

<p>'You wish me to learn something about him?'</p>

<p>'Precisely.'</p>

<p>'Where does he hail from?'</p>

<p>'The United States, I believe; and he has been a good deal in
California.'</p>

<p>'All, some queer people come over here from the States,'
remarked Tatlock reflectively. 'But what is the name of the
gentleman?' asked Tatlock.</p>

<p>'Mr. Josiah Woodfield Bell Flowers.'</p>

<p>'Bell Flowers; the name seems familiar to me,' mused the
detective.</p>

<p>'Very likely. He's well known in the City in connection with the
Great Gold Reefs Mines and Land Exploration Company, Limited,'
rejoined Clarges.</p>

<p>'Oh, ah! now I remember. A gigantic scheme for making the
fortune of somebody, but not the share-holders'.'</p>

<p>'Do you know anything?' asked Clarges anxiously.</p>

<p>'Oh dear no&mdash;I only suspect.'</p>

<p>'Suspect what?'</p>

<p>'That the glowing reports issued at the time the company was
formed were coloured and spiced to attract the unwary.'</p>

<p>Mr. Clarges had lapsed into silence and thoughtfulness. He
seemed much distressed, and passing his hand over his forehead said
'Well, look here, Mr. Tatlock, will you slip away quietly to
California; learn what you can about the property and Mr. Flowers,
and report to me at the earliest possible moment? My wife is very
anxious to hurry the marriage on, but as I intend giving my
daughter a large fortune, it is but right I should have some
assurance that the man who is to be her husband is worthy of
her.'</p>

<p>'I agree with you, sir. I will accept your commission, and, if I
may venture to do so, I strongly advise you not to allow this
marriage to take place until I have been abroad. A young lady with
a large fortune should be carefully guarded. If all is right, you
and I will be the only two people who will know that any inquiries
have been made, and you may console yourself with the reflection
that you have done nothing more than your duty. If all is not
right&mdash;well, then you will be able to congratulate yourself
that you have saved your child from becoming the victim of an
adventurer.'</p>

<p>Mr. Clarges acquiesced in the soundness of the proposition, and
took his leave in a somewhat relieved frame of mind.</p>

<p>The weeks that ensued from that memorable interview with Tyler
Tatlock were anxious ones to Mr. Clarges, for Mr. Bell Flowers
urged that the marriage might be allowed to take place at once, and
in this he was backed up by Mrs. Clarges, who could not understand
why there should be any delay. But her husband insisted that the
ceremony should be delayed until Sophie's twenty-second birthday,
which was four months off, and in spite of entreaty on the part of
his would-be son-in-law, and of a little storming on the part of
Mrs. Clarges, he carried his point, and in this he was supported by
his daughter, who was by no means in a desperate hurry to take upon
herself the cares and responsibilities of wifedom. And, indeed, to
tell the truth, she had not quite got over the wrench of severing
herself from Robert Eccles. Had she searched her heart, she might
have had to confess that she had not ceased to love him&mdash;for
love him she certainly did at one time&mdash;and though she was
engaged to Bell Flowers, he was not quite the same in her sight
that Bob had been.</p>

<p>At length the long and trying period of suspense for Mr. Clarges
ended. Tyler Tatlock returned from his visit to the States, and at
once notified Clarges of the fact. The stockbroker did not allow
many hours to elapse before he called at Tatlock's office.</p>

<p>'Well, what news?' he exclaimed in his eagerness. Nothing, I'm
afraid, that is likely to cause you any gratification.'</p>

<p>Mr. Clarges' countenance fell, and he had many far from
agreeable reflections, the while Tatlock unlocked a large safe and
took therefrom a bundle of papers, which he proceeded to spread out
on his desk, at which he seated himself with the air of one who was
conscious of the grave responsibility resting on him.</p>

<p>'In accordance with your instructions,' he commenced, as he
sorted his documents and unfolded a sheet of blue foolscap closely
covered with writing, 'I proceeded direct to California, and not
without considerable difficulty and some risk did I reach the
region in which the Great Gold Reefs property is located. Perhaps
you could not find in the whole world another such arid, desolate,
sun-scorched, snake-haunted wilderness.'</p>

<p>'But are there no mines?' cried the troubled Clarges.</p>

<p>'Of a kind, yes. Long and long ago some mines were worked there
and abandoned. Some goldless quartz had been got out of one
comparatively recently, and there was a quantity of primitive
wooden machinery, and a small stamping engine near the shaft. But
the wood had shrivelled up in the fierce sun and fallen in ruins,
and the stamping engine was half buried in sand. In a log house in
a gully close by dwelt an old negro with his wife and family. He
was in charge of the property, such as it was. He was an
intelligent fellow, and very communicative. He had been placed
there by the person you know as Mr. Flowers, but whom he referred
to as Sam Jedling.'</p>

<p>'But how do you know that Jedling and Flowers are the same?'</p>

<p>'Because I showed the old negro the portrait of Mr. Flowers you
furnished me with. The old negro grinned from ear to ear,
displaying his perfect teeth, and exclaimed, "Yes, yes, that's
Massa Sam." Now, I further gathered that a gang of negroes, with
two or three white men, one of whom was called "The Boss," worked
for a few months at the mines. Every drop of water required, and
every scrap of provisions, had to be brought across the desert from
a long distance. Two of the white men and several of the niggers
died. One of the white men died from sunstroke and two of the
blacks from the bite of rattlesnakes, which swarm in that part of
the country. The 'Boss,' who was an engineer of the name of Lawson,
was unable to continue working owing to being shorthanded. But he
hung on for some time, and was joined by Jedling, and the two spent
some days in examining the stone that had been brought up, but only
a speck of gold here and there could be discovered. At last they
finished their inspection, discharged the workmen, placed the old
negro as caretaker, undertaking to keep him supplied with
provisions, and went off. Lawson returned two or three times, on
each occasion with two or three white men, but Jedling never went
back.'</p>

<p>Clarges groaned. It began to dawn upon him that a huge swindle
had been perpetrated.</p>

<p>'Does the story end there?' he asked with a gasp.</p>

<p>'By no means. I have traced the history to some extent of both
Jedling and Lawson. The latter was regarded as an engineer of
considerable ability, and a mining expert of long experience. I
think myself there is little doubt he was corrupted by Jedling, who
from all accounts is a swindler of the deepest dye. He appears to
be well known in California, and particularly in San Francisco,
where he suffered imprisonment for forging a bill. In the time at
my disposal I was unable to learn much about his early career, but
you may accept the statement as one of fact that he is an
unmitigated scoundrel.</p>

<p>'To sum up, the person you know as Josiah Woodfield Bell Flowers
has in conjunction with others committed a gigantic fraud on the
British public, and you have narrowly escaped giving your daughter
and your money into his clutches, for which escape you may thank
God.'</p>

<p>Mr. Clarges bowed his head. He almost felt heart-broken. Yet he
was deeply, prayerfully thankful his daughter had not been
sacrificed. When Mrs. Clarges learnt the truth she went into
hysterics, and was ill for several weeks. Sophie sighed; perhaps in
her heart she was not altogether sorry things had turned out as
they had. Mindful of the unintentional wrong he had done Robert
Eccles, her father sent for him and told him everything, and he
made but a feeble attempt to disguise that he was not averse to the
young couple billing and cooing if they wished to do so. Needless
to say, the young couple availed themselves fully of the unexpected
opportunity which had occurred for the renewal of the erstwhile
pleasant acquaintanceship, an acquaintanceship that speedily
ripened, and culminated in the fulness of time in marriage. But
long before then punishment swift and sure fell upon Josiah
Woodfield Bell Flowers, otherwise Sam Jedling, which probably was
not his legitimate name after all. It was impossible, of course,
for Mr. Clarges to hush the fraud up. To make it known was a duty
he owed to himself as an honest man, to his position as a
stockbroker, and to the public at large. So he swore an information
which led to a warrant being issued, and an officer and two men
were sent down to Mr. Flowers' splendid house to execute it. It
chanced that he was entertaining a party of friends, but when he
learned that his short-lived glory had passed, and the bubble was
pricked, he bowed his head and said he would resign himself without
a struggle to the inevitable.</p>

<p>He was allowed, accompanied by the officer, to retire to his
bedroom to change his evening dress for a more suitable costume.
While there he unlocked a small drawer in a cabinet, took therefrom
a phial, and drawing the cork, poured the contents of the phial
down his throat before he could be stopped. The phial contained
prussic acid. For an appreciable time he stood bolt upright, a
ghastly pallor overspreading his handsome face. Then he made an
effort to speak, but Death gripped him, and he fell face forward on
the rich pile carpet that covered the floor.</p>

<p>He had lived his life; he had played his part; the glamour of
greatness had lured him; but, alas! it was but for an hour of
passing glory, and the end&mdash;unchristian burial and a
dishonoured grave.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>THE MYSTERY OF THE GRAVEL PITS
FARM</h2>

<p class="first">
A LONG and picturesque valley, with rounded heather-clad hills
on either side; here and there a patch of woodland, or a tiny
ravine running into the hills, green and cool, with ferns in their
season, and moist and misty with some trickling stream. If you
mounted to the hill-top and turned your eyes south you observed an
extensive panorama of the fair English country, while northward was
the line of the Cheviots, guarding, sentinel-like, the land of
mountain and flood. It was a lonely valley, sparsely populated, and
in one of the loneliest parts of it stood the Gravel Pits Farm, in
the occupation, at the period of this story, of two brothers,
George and David Sandeman. George was the elder. He was about
forty; David not more than thirty-five. They had lived on the farm
for about twelve years. It was not a very productive place, but the
Sandemans managed to live fairly comfortably, although they were at
times hard pressed to make ends meet. They had a long lease of the
farm, which at one time they were very anxious to dispose of, but
they were advised to hold on, for it was certain that sooner or
later a branch railway would be pushed through the valley, and the
Sandemans had been assured that whenever the railway did come, it
must, in the natural order of things, sweep over the Gravel Pits
Farm lands, and bowl the farm itself over. And so they hung on.</p>

<p>And one day men appeared with dumpy levels, theodolites, chains,
and poles. And later the brothers got an intimation that their farm
and land would be required; and, later still, came a party of
gentlemen&mdash;they were surveyors&mdash;to value the farm; and
finally, after some haggling, the Sandemans agreed to accept a
price which had been fixed by a board of arbitrators, and they were
told that they must clear out in four months. During those four
months David Sandeman mysteriously disappeared. George had been
away in Scotland. When he returned to his home he was informed that
a week before David had gone up the valley in search of a stray
pony, but had not come back.</p>

<p>George searched high, and he searched low. He advertised. He
offered a reward. He communicated with the police, but not a sign
nor trace of the missing man was obtained. He had gone, and no one
could say why he had gone, nor what his fate was. When the
'compensation for disturbance' had been settled by the railway
company, and the brothers had accepted it, each made a will by
which, in the event of the death of either, the survivor was to
inherit the deceased's property. It should be mentioned that the
brothers were bachelors, and there was a clause in the wills to the
effect that marriage on the part of either should render the will
null and void. At the expiration of the four months allowed by the
board of arbitrators George Sandeman quitted the Gravel Pits Farm,
and went to a farm in Perthshire.</p>

<p>For a whole year after that the Gravel Pits Farm remained
desolate, forlorn, and owl-haunted. At last one morning a little
party of engineers engaged on the new line of railway made the farm
their quarters. A few weeks later a band of stalwart navvies, armed
with spade, pick, and crowbar, began to demolish the buildings. In
the course of their work they made a very startling discovery. They
had begun to pull down a barn, over which was a small granary. In
this granary was an old box which had been used as a bean bin. One
of the navvies struck off the lid with his pick, and the box seemed
to be packed full of turf. A great deal of bog turf was cut on the
hillsides by the valley dwellers and used as fuel for their fires.
The navvy began to prise the sides of the box out with a crowbar,
and to scatter the turf, when suddenly he started back with an
exclamation of alarm, and called out to a mate near:</p>

<p>'I say, Jim, blowed if there ain't a dead 'un 'ere.'</p>

<p>Yes, sure enough, there was the dead body of a man, and the turf
had preserved it to such an extent that, save that the flesh was
brown and shrivelled, it did not seem to be decayed. The foreman
was called, and he in turn communicated with the superintendent,
who gave orders that the work of demolition should be suspended
until the police and the coroner had been notified. Necessarily an
inquest was ordered, and a medical man was instructed, in the
interests of justice, to examine the body. This he did, and he
found a hole in the skull and a bullet in the brain. The body was
identified beyond all question of doubt as that of David Sandeman.
And it was equally certain that David had been murdered.</p>

<p>George Sandeman came from Perthshire to give evidence at the
inquest, but he could throw no light on the mystery. The verdict of
the coroner's jury was murder&mdash;there could be no
other&mdash;but by whom the murder was done it was impossible at
that stage to say.</p>

<p>There were circumstances in connection with this Gravel Pits
Farm tragedy which removed it somewhat out of the common, and
aroused an extraordinary amount of public interest on account of
the elements of romance and mystery surrounding it.</p>

<p>Now, there was one curious fact in connection with this tragedy,
which served, as a natural consequence, to heighten the mystery.
The bullet extracted from the dead man's brain was an old-fashioned
round bullet, and on a rafter in the granary where the body had
lain so many months a pistol, rusty and dust-covered, was found. It
was a single-barrelled, flint-lock weapon, such as was in use at
the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth
century. It was a superior weapon of its class, for the barrel was
damascened and the stock was inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The
bullet exactly fitted the barrel. It therefore seemed pretty
certain that it was with that pistol the crime had been committed,
and the granary itself was probably the scene of the crime. When,
how, by whom, and why was the murder done? Those four points made
up a pretty complex problem, and so keen became the public desire
to have it solved that it was submitted to Tyler Tatlock, and an
order was given that the demolition of the farm buildings was not
to be proceeded with until a full and exhaustive inquiry had been
made.</p>

<p>The first thing Tatlock did when he set to work in the matter
was to determine the constitution of the household at the period
when David disappeared. When it became evident that the property
would be acquired by the railway company, the brothers reduced
their establishment to the lowest possible limits, and for months
before and at the time of the crime it was made up as follows. An
old woman named Margaret Westcroft, who occupied the position of
housekeeper; a dairy-maid, known as Sarah Giles, a smart,
well-figured, good-looking lass of twenty-five; a boy of about
fourteen or fifteen named Jimmy Martin. He may be described as a
boy-of-all-work. For a pound or two a year and his 'grub' he made
himself generally useful. These three persons slept in the farm
itself. Of the outside hands there were Ronald Macfarlane, the
herdsman, a middle-aged man, who had been in the service of the
brothers for some years; a ploughman, Walter Hislop, who had been
engaged six months before at the hiring fair in Carlisle; and a
waggoner, Peter Grubb, also engaged at the hiring fair at the same
time. These three men occupied a little cottage at the rear of the
farm, and about fifty yards from the main building. All the people
had been discharged, and had scattered about the country at least a
year before the discovery of the body in the granary. Margaret
Westcroft and Jimmy Martin were examined at the inquest, but could
throw no light whatever on the occurrence, if we except a statement
that before George Sandeman went away he and his brother had a
quarrel, and on the day of his disappearance David seemed very
restless and strange in his manner. By dint of perseverance, and
not without some trouble, Tatlock interviewed the others, with the
exception of Sarah Giles. They did not furnish a scrap of
information likely to be of use. Ronald Macfarlane, in fact, had
been sent to Carlisle by David with some pigs three days before the
crime. When he returned David had been missing for two days. Sarah
Giles belonged to Hereford-shire, where her mother, a brother, and
a sister lived; but she had quarrelled with her people, and held no
communication with them. Consequently they did not know where she
had gone to.</p>

<p>Tatlock's opinion was that every one he had seen who went to
make up the Sandeman household at the time of the murder had taken
no part in, and had no knowledge of; the murder. On this point he
differed from the chief constable of the county. This gentleman's
view was that George Sandeman had paid one of his servants to kill
David, and his going away during the commission of the crime was a
blind. The constable urged in support of his view that it was
elicited in evidence before the coroner that George&mdash;it was
noted at the time&mdash;when he returned and was informed of his
brother's disappearance, did not seem at all surprised, and
betrayed no concern at the continued absence of David, nor did he,
so it was alleged, make any strenuous efforts to discover him. The
constable was very firm in his view, and was anxious to arrest
George, but, in the absence of any legal evidence to support such a
step, could not do so.</p>

<p>Tatlock's theory was altogether different, and did not in any
way incriminate George Sandeman, notwithstanding that there was a
very strong public feeling against him. But according to the theory
the motive was not desire for gain, but revenge.</p>

<p>It had been stated that on the day of his death David seemed
restless and strange in his manner, and that he went up the valley
in search of a stray pony and was seen no more. The latter part of
the statement, however, was inaccurate, as Margaret Westcroft said
her master came in at tea-time, and told her he had not found the
pony. At that time Sarah Giles was in the dairy making some butter,
and all the men were out on various duties. David was silent and
moody. He swallowed down some tea, and, putting on his hat, told
his housekeeper he was going into the barn to get some rope which
was stored there, and which he wanted. Mrs. Westcroft was
bread-baking at the time, and she went on with her duties, thinking
no more of David until the hands assembled for their supper, when
she inquired where Mr. David was, but nobody could answer the
question. He was expected to put in an appearance shortly, but he
didn't. This caused no uneasiness, because it was deemed probable
he had gone to smoke a pipe with a neighbour who lived lower down
the valley, about a couple of miles away, where he was in the habit
of spending a good deal of his time.</p>

<p>Tatlock's theory was that David did go into the barn on that
fatal evening; that he was murdered in the barn, carried up to the
granary, thrown into the bean chest, and covered over at once with
the handy turf, the winter stock of which was kept there. Here,
again, the idea of revenge stood out prominently, and the deduction
was that the murderer was well acquainted with the premises. The
barn stood detached from the main building. All the farm-hands
being out in the fields, the criminal had no fear of disturbance in
his deadly work. Having committed the crime, he could easily slip
off and decamp over the hills. One of the most curious and
suggestive points in the whole of the case was the fact of the
criminal having used such an antiquated weapon wherewith to commit
the crime.</p>

<p>Having worked out his theory in his own way, Tatlock proceeded
to act upon it. Firstly, the motive of the crime was&mdash;revenge.
Secondly, the criminal must have been well acquainted with the
place. Thirdly, he had carried out his fiendish work by means of an
obsolete weapon, such as could only be met with in an old curiosity
shop or a museum.</p>

<p>Having determined the constitution of the Sandeman household at
the time of the crime, Tatlock next proceeded to learn something of
it antecedent to that event, and his inquiries brought to light
that about a year before David was slain the brothers had had in
their employ, as a sort of overseer, a man named Pierre Verne. He
was believed to be a native of France, but had been the greater
part of his life in England or Scotland, and had occupied himself
with agriculture. It was known that he used to receive letters from
France. He was clever in his way, but was singularly taciturn and
reserved, and never talked of himself or his past. He and David did
not get on very well together, and he was discharged. This was
significant on the face of it, though it did not necessarily follow
that Pierre Verne was the murderer. But Tatlock certainly deemed it
his duty to try and track him. In the course of an interview
Tatlock had with George Sandeman in Perth, the latter made a remark
to the effect that he believed there had been some love-making
between Verne and Sarah Giles. As previously stated, Giles was a
good-looking young woman. She was regarded as a
coquette&mdash;giddy, flighty, vain. She was fond of going to
Carlisle&mdash;the nearest town&mdash;whenever she got the chance,
and it was remembered that when she was away Verne frequently went
away too. From this there was but one inference to be
drawn&mdash;Giles and Verne were lovers. In this little fact
Tatlock discerned certain potentialities.</p>

<p>'Search for the woman,' say the French, 'whenever there is
mischief'; and wiseacres are never tired of declaring that a woman
is at the bottom of all mischief. Poor woman! Many sins are laid at
her door, but as woman inspires men with sentiments of love, and
love is very jealous, such crime as that of the Gravel Pits Farm
might have been the result entirely of jealousy. But jealousy of
whom? According to the theory, the crime was the result of revenge.
Jealousy often prompts revenge. If it did so in this case, was it
not allowable to suppose that David Sandeman sought to insinuate
himself between the passionate Frenchman, Pierre Verne, and the
pretty, giddy Giles?</p>

<p>Turning his attention to Carlisle, Tatlock discovered in the
most populous part of the town a tea and cake and sweetie shop,
kept by an old lady, Margaret Janwick by name, and her daughter,
Harriet. It was a small shop, but did a thriving business, and Mrs.
Janwick and her daughter made a comfortable living. Well, Sarah
Giles and Harriet Janwick&mdash;they were about the same
age&mdash;had been great chums. It was to the Janwicks that Miss
Giles always went when in town; and, as Harriet was a pretty girl,
like her friend, fond of a little flirtation and amusement, the two
young women went about a good deal. So much did Tatlock unearth,
and through it he unearthed a good deal more.</p>

<p>Harriet Janwick possessed a photograph of Sarah Giles and Pierre
Verne. They had been taken together during one of their visits to
the town.</p>

<p>Here, then, was direct evidence that they had sweet-hearted.
They were standing arm-in-arm, Sarah decked out in her Sunday best,
Pierre wearing kid gloves, and holding a stick and his hat in his
hand. On the back of the photograph was written 'To dear Harriet,
from Sarah.' Pierre was a somewhat striking-looking man, but with
rather a saturnine expression. He had a good forehead, and an
intelligent face, which was decidedly French in its type.</p>

<p>Although Verne and Sarah were ostensibly sweethearts, Miss
Janwick did not think her friend cared very much for him. He was
absurdly jealous, and grew angry if she even looked at another man.
Nevertheless, on one occasion, when they had had a serious quarrel,
Sarah wept fit to break her heart.</p>

<p>Miss Janwick confessed that she could never quite make Sarah
out. At one time she seemed very serious; and at others she was so
flighty and giddy that it was impossible to get her to rivet her
attention on anybody or anything. But some little time before
Gravel Pits Farm was vacated, Sarah seemed to entirely change in
her nature. She grew more thoughtful, more sedate; lost interest in
the things that before had pleased her, and appeared to be
suffering from dejection. Harriet Janwick had never been able to
get a satisfactory explanation of this, though she thought it was
due to Pierre Verne having gone away. After his departure Sarah
rarely spoke about him, but she did impart to her friend the
information that he had gone to Bordeaux, his native town, where he
had obtained a situation in some wine merchant's office.</p>

<p>After he had gone away Sarah's visits to Carlisle became less
and less. The very last time that she went, that is so far as Miss
Janwick knew, was then David Sandeman's strange disappearance was
causing a good deal of talk. She visited her friend that afternoon,
and stayed to tea. She seemed unusually depressed and nervous, and
once or twice burst into tears. When Harriet pressed her for the
cause of this, she exclaimed petulantly:</p>

<p>'Oh, nothing. I'm ill, that's all.'</p>

<p>Harriet had never seen her in such a strange mood, and naturally
felt much distressed. She was going to visit a cousin, and asked
her friend to accompany her, but Sarah replied:</p>

<p>'No. I must get back to that horrid farm; but I wish I hadn't to
go, for I hate the place.'</p>

<p>'Why, you used to say you liked being there,' said her
friend.</p>

<p>'Yes, so I did one time; but those were happy times.'</p>

<p>'In what way have they changed?' asked Miss Janwick.</p>

<p>'Oh, lors!' exclaimed Sarah half angrily, 'there's no need to
ask that. The farm's going to be given up, as you know, and we've
all got to clear out. That's one reason. And then Pierre's gone,
and David Sandeman's disappeared. Everything's changed.'</p>

<p>Harriet accepted that explanation as a good and sufficient
reason for her friend's unhappiness, and, sympathising and
condoling with her, she and her mother persuaded her to stay with
them all night. She yielded to the persuasion, and later on the two
girls and a young man, an acquaintance of Harriet's, went to see a
travelling theatrical company.</p>

<p>The piece in which the company appeared was the sensational
melodrama of 'Maria Martin,' based upon a well-known case many
years ago, in which a young girl was foully murdered in a barn by a
man named Martin. During the performance, much to the alarm of her
friends, Sarah Giles fainted, and, as Harriet said, 'Sarah seemed
about the last girl in the world to faint'; for she had always
seemed so strong, so sturdy, with robust, country health.
Nevertheless, she went off on that particular night, and had to be
carried out into the open air, where brandy was administered to
her. When she recovered she said she thought the heat had overcome
her. She and Harriet went straight home, and all night Sarah seemed
so uneasy and restless that her friend was much concerned about
her. The next morning, as the two girls lay in bed talking, the
conversation turned upon the mysterious disappearance of Mr. David
Sandeman, and she incidentally mentioned that he had made love to
her.</p>

<p>'I wonder what has become of him,' remarked Harriet.</p>

<p>'The Lord knows,' answered Sarah with a sigh.</p>

<p>'Perhaps he's been murdered,' suggested Harriet.</p>

<p>This suggestion caused Sarah Giles to cover her face with her
hands and burst into tears; and when her friend wished to caress
and soothe her, she pushed her away with her elbow, and in sobbing
tones said:</p>

<p>'Oh, what a horrible thing you are! Whatever put such an idea as
that into your head?'</p>

<p>Miss Janwick tried to justify the suggestions she had thrown out
by saying that the valley was so lonely, and referring to a local
tradition that a farmer had been murdered in that very valley by a
tramp some thirty years before. The end of it all was Sarah Giles
sprang out of bed and began to dress herself, and, in the
performance of her toilet, she seemed to brighten up and become
more like her old self, while during the breakfast she was quite
merry. She parted from her friends at noon, and left the town with
the country carrier, who was going part of the way, and had offered
to give her a lift as far as he went. She promised the Janwicks she
would come in the following week on market day, and visit them.
Whether she came or not they did not know. Anyway she did not visit
them, and they had never set eyes upon her since, nor had she even
condescended to write. Both mother and daughter referred to her in
somewhat bitter terms, considering she had been ungrateful, as they
had shown her much kindness and hospitality.</p>

<p>These new facts which Tatlock had elicited set him pondering.
They certainly seemed to throw some light on hitherto dark places.
Sarah Giles's conduct and changes of mood, as described by the
Janwicks, was full of significance, and her fainting during the
performance of Maria Martin' was particularly so. It was like a
handwriting on the wall, and yet it was not quite easy to interpret
it. It was difficult to suppose that she committed the murder
herself. Nevertheless, her behaviour in Carlisle subsequent to the
murder indicated apparently some guilty knowledge.</p>

<p>Although Tatlock had managed to put together several parts of
the puzzle, the key pieces were still wanting, and he deemed it his
duty to betake himself to Bordeaux, armed with that photograph with
the inscription on the back:'To dear Harriet, from Sarah.' Of
course, the first thing he did was to present himself at the head
police quarters, where he was supplied with some information which
was almost a story in itself.</p>

<p>Pierre Verne was in the employment of a large firm of wine
growers. His duties lay out of doors in connection with the
cultivation of the vines. Some time after he had held this position
he was joined by a young woman from England who did not speak
French, and she was understood to be his wife. They lived together
in a small cottage just on the outskirts of Bordeaux. Within a very
few weeks of her arrival a baby was brought into the world
prematurely, and made all haste to get out of it, for it died
within a week of bronchitis. Soon after that event it became known
to the workpeople on the estate that Pierre Verne and his English
wife were leading a cat-and-dog sort of life. The young woman
seemed very unhappy, and it was believed that Pierre was in the
habit of beating her. Their cottage was situated in a lonely spot
at the edge of a wood. One day Pierre went about inquiring for his
wife. He said she had taken herself off, and he wanted to bring her
back. But nobody could give him any information. Nobody had seen
her. In a few days he ceased to talk about her, and for a time the
people forgot the circumstance, until one evening Verne beat a boy
who was working in the vineyard mercilessly for some petty fault.
The women who were weeding were furious, and one exclaimed:</p>

<p>'I believe now you murdered your poor wife.'</p>

<p>Perhaps as far as she was concerned it was only a meaningless
taunt, but it suited the incident and the occasion; it was taken up
and repeated by others. He was jeered and hooted, and the
suggestiveness of the taunt appealed so forcibly to the people that
they talked about it until it seemed to them it must be true. It
came to the ears of the police, and they called upon Pierre Verne
for some explanation about his wife's sudden disappearance.</p>

<p>His answers were considered so unsatisfactory that he was
arrested. Then the murder idea strengthened. It became a sort of
phantom that lashed people into a fury against the prisoner. The
man was examined according to French procedure. A Judge of
Instruction (Juge d'Instruction) examined him, interrogated him
pitilessly again and again and again, but throughout the ordeal the
man maintained his innocence. The police made the most determined
and exhaustive efforts to get evidence. For a long time they were
baffled, until at last Verne's nerves gave way. He could stand the
torture no longer. The living death he had endured during these
months of incarceration maddened him, and, sending for the judge,
he laid bare his soul.</p>

<p>Yes, he had killed Sarah, and her body was buried in the wood
above his cottage. Sure enough, there it was found. He had
strangled her with a silk handkerchief, which was still round her
throat. From that moment he lapsed into silence. They could get
nothing further from him. Through the awful ordeal of trial he
passed silently and apparently indifferent. He heard his doom
pronounced unmoved. He endured the suspense and terror of the weeks
that intervened between the sentence and the fall of the knife
without a murmur or complaint, and when suddenly in the grey dawn
of morning he was awakened from his sleep, and told to have
courage, he preserved his stoicism. It was only when he went forth
and heard the roar of the rabble, and glancing upward saw the
gleaming steel blood-red in the light of the dawning day, that he
betrayed his human nature. He shuddered and fretted, and sobbed out
twice:</p>

<p>'I loved her, I loved her!'</p>

<p>An instant later there was a spurting of hot blood, a mighty
shout from the surging mob, and a severed head lay in a basket of
sawdust. Justice had smitten! The tragedy was done!</p>

<p>That Pierre Verne slew poor, misguided Sarah Giles there was not
the shadow of a doubt. But did he slay David Sandeman? it will be
asked.</p>

<p>Well, here are two little items that Tatlock brought to light.
From a museum in Bordeaux a flintlock pistol, said to have belonged
to Napoleon the First, had been stolen. How, by whom, and when it
was not known.</p>

<p>At the time of the crime at the Gravel Pits Farm, Pierre Verne
was absent from Bordeaux. He had obtained leave of absence to go to
England, where he said he had some business to settle.</p>

<p>The flintlock pistol with the damascened barrel and inlaid stock
was identified by the museum people, and returned to them by
Tatlock. Circumstantial evidence, then, convicts Pierre Verne of
having killed David Sandeman. Sarah Giles in all probability was a
party to the crime. At any rate, she knew of it.</p>

<p>Why did Verne kill Sandeman?</p>

<p>Because he was jealous; because Sandeman was his rival; because
he desired to be revenged. Why did he kill Sarah Giles? To this
question the reader can supply the answer. 'Vengeance is mine,
saith the Lord.' Through the instrumentality of man the Lord had
avenged the double crime.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>THE SIGN OF THE YELLOW STAR</h2>

<p class="first">
IT was towards the end of autumn that Mr. John Duff;
representative of a very large and well-known Scottish house,
trading principally in woollen goods and plaids, left Edinburgh on
a periodical business visit to London. Mr. Duff was a commercial
traveller of great sagacity and high repute, who had been on the
road for the same firm for about twenty years. He was still young,
not over forty, and after business was as fond of enjoying himself
as most men. In business he was punctilious and attentive. He put
up, as usual, at a very quiet but central hotel of a highly
respectable character.</p>

<p>On the evening of his arrival Mr. Duff, having dined well,
adjourned to the smoking-room to enjoy his cigar, and there he made
the acquaintance of a fair-spoken, pleasant, affable gentleman of
American nationality, as evidenced by his twang. Some commonplace
remark on the part of the American struck the keynote, and he was
so pleasant, so full of information, and so desirous, as he said,
of forming some friendships in London, which he was visiting for
the first time, that Mr. Duff quite took to him, and having
exchanged cigars and stood drinks for each other, the American
informed his new acquaintance that he bore the somewhat curious and
quaint name of Risdom Tillstone. He expressed himself as delighted
to know Mr. Duff, and said it was on his programme to visit
Scotland.</p>

<p>The acquaintanceship thus begun speedily ripened, so that in the
course of two or three days strangers might have supposed the two
men had known each other for years. Risdom Tillstone, who was
between thirty and forty, was insinuating, self-assertive, and
persevering, but withal exceedingly gentlemanly and polished. About
the third evening after the beginning of the
acquaintance&mdash;which was to lead to such extraordinary
results&mdash;had begun, Mr. Duff had gone to Tillstone's bedroom
by his request to look at some American photographs which Tillstone
was desirous of showing him. In lifting these photographs from his
trunk he inadvertently pulled out a small yellow star attached to a
morsel of blue ribbon, and it fell to the floor. Duff stooped,
picked it up, and handed it to his new-found friend. The star was
evidently made of metal&mdash;probably silver, yellowed in some
way. As Tillstone held out his hand to receive it a strange
expression came into his face. It was a mixed expression of
confusion and alarm. He took the ornament, or whatever it was, and
thrust it into his pocket, without any comment. The incident was so
trifling in itself that Mr. Duff attached no importance to it, but
casually remarked:</p>

<p>'Is that a foreign decoration?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered Tillstone curtly; and, with the obvious
intention of preventing any further questions on the subject, he
began to talk of the photographs.</p>

<p>Naturally Mr. Duff was a little curious to know Mr. Tillstone's
calling, and with Scottish bluntness asked him point blank:</p>

<p>'What business are you in?'</p>

<p>Tillstone smiled sweetly and blandly as he replied, with a
certain significance of intonation:</p>

<p>'I am living the life of a gentleman.'</p>

<p>'But you have been in business, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Oh, well, yes, a little, I guess. My father, the Judge, farmed
somewhat in the State of Nebraska, and I helped him. I guess I had
an elegant time.'</p>

<p>It was clear that this was another subject Mr. Tillstone wished
tabooed, as he quickly began to talk about something else. For a
moment or two Mr. Duff had some thoughts that the American was 'a
bit fishy,' but he came to the conclusion, on reflection, that he
was a type of a very large class of Yankees, who, having made a
'pile,' come over to 'do Europe.' They generally give themselves
airs, and talk 'big,' about their 'people,' and so forth, and seem
to have a soul above trade. Duff, however, on the whole, had a high
opinion of Tillstone.</p>

<p>Of course, Mr. Duff; having to attend to his business, did not
see much of his friend during the day, but their evenings were
generally spent together, and, as the Yankee phrased it, they 'had
a good time.' A week after the acquaintance began Mr. Risdom
Tillstone expressed a strong wish to go to a bal masque advertised
to take place at Covent Garden Theatre in a few days, and he asked
Mr. Duff to accompany him. It was to be an exceptionally grand
ball, and not only a very large but a very select attendance was
expected, as the tickets were fixed at two guineas for gentlemen
and a guinea for ladies. Mr. Duff somewhat demurred at the price,
but his friend offered to pay for him. Duff of course would not
permit that, and decided to go. When the night arrived and they
were dressed and waiting in the entrance of the hotel while a cab
was being whistled up, Duff noticed that his companion had the
yellow star pinned to his breast. Possibly it would not have
attracted his attention had it not been for the little incident in
the bed-room when the star fell on the floor, for it was an
insignificant-looking thing, and not conspicuous.</p>

<p>'I see you are wearing that order,' he remarked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered Tillstone sententiously, and he jerked his cloak
over it, as though he did not wish it to be seen. And in the way in
which he uttered the 'yes' there was a suggestion of annoyance.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, Duff asked: 'What order is it?'</p>

<p>'Oh, nothing of any consequence. But come on, here's the
cab.'</p>

<p>This reply set Duff pondering. If it was an order of merit, why
was the American so chary of talking about it? He could hardly be
accused of undue modesty. And as he did not like to talk about it,
why did he wear it? This was a pretty little problem, which, shrewd
as he was, Mr. Duff could not solve, and the arrival at the theatre
put the matter out of his mind for the time being.</p>

<p>A dance had just finished, and the revellers were promenading
the stately ballroom. Duff and his American acquaintance were
sauntering slowly amongst the gay and chattering throng, when they
came upon a gentleman in conversation with a lady in a domino. Of
course, there was nothing in that to attract attention, but the
gentleman wore on his breast a small yellow star attached to a
piece of blue ribbon. It was a facsimile of the star which Duff had
seen fall on the floor in the bedroom of the hotel and again that
evening pinned on the breast of his companion. But for that fact he
would not have noticed it. But what followed was still more
curious; each man wearing the star put his right hand up to his
forehead as if making a military salute, and it was done so rapidly
it would have escaped the observation of most people. Then the left
hand was placed over the breast with equal rapidity. These were
evidently signs.</p>

<p>'Excuse me for a few minutes,' said Tillstone, 'I fancy I see a
countryman of mine over there,' and he walked quickly away, and in
a few moments the strange man followed him.</p>

<p>Duff was amazed, and he watched them, saw them come together,
converse for a few minutes, then separate, and Tillstone returned
to his friend, who was on the point of asking for some explanation,
but checked himself, restrained his curiosity, and remained silent.
Necessarily the tiny yellow star with its morsel of blue ribbon now
interested Duff very much, and he resolved to try and find out, if
possible, at some more opportune moment, what the mystery was.</p>

<p>Two mornings later, while partaking of his breakfast&mdash;the
American was still abed&mdash;he never put in an appearance until
midday&mdash;Mr. Duff was glancing through a daily paper, as was
his wont, when, by the merest chance imaginable, his eye lighted on
the following mysterious announcement in the agony column:</p>
<br>

<p class="typewriter" style="text-align:center">
Yellow Star. The Ditch. 27. 10.</p>

<p><br>
Mr. Duff, having got yellow star on the brain, was peculiarly
interested in the conundrum embodied in this advertisement, but he
could make nothing of it. He cut the advertisement out, however,
and put it into his pocket-book. A day or two later, his business
in London completed for the time being, he prepared to take his
departure. Mr. Tillstone was very effusive when it came to saying
good-bye, and promised to look him up in Edinburgh in a week or
two.</p>

<p>Mr. Duff had been back in Edinburgh a couple of days when his
attention was drawn to the following paragraph in the daily
paper:</p>

<p>Extraordinary Occurrence.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that some time ago it was announced that
the daughter of a Mrs. Leslie, residing in one of the suburbs of
London, had apparently been spirited away. Miss Alice Leslie, who
was fourteen years of age, used to go daily to a young ladies'
school in the neighbourhood. One afternoon she failed to return
home as usual, and, in spite of every inquiry, no trace of her
could be found. The distracted mother made repeated appeals through
the press, and offered a reward of one hundred pounds for the
girl's recovery. It has now been allowed to leak out that Mrs.
Leslie received an anonymous letter saying that her daughter was
safe and sound, and would be restored to her home on the mother
consenting to pay a thousand pounds. The writer went on to say that
if she failed to pay the money she would never hear of her child
again, and if she made the contents of the letter known to anyone
it would be the signal for her daughter being put to death. If she
was willing to pay the money, she was to be at a certain spot at an
hour named, with a cheque in her pocket payable to bearer, and in
exchange for that cheque she would receive her daughter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie, who is a wealthy lady&mdash;a fact evidently known
to the miscreants concerned in the abduction&mdash;was so
distressed at the threat contained in the letter, that, without
consulting anyone, she wrote a cheque to bearer, and went to the
rendezvous, a secluded spot in the public park. After waiting some
little time she was accosted by a well-dressed woman, closely
veiled, who inquired if she was Mrs. Leslie. On receiving answer in
the affirmative, the woman demanded to see the cheque, and, the
demand being complied with, the woman conducted her to another part
of the park, where a man and another woman were waiting with the
girl. By this time it was quite dark, and Mrs. Leslie was so
overjoyed at meeting her daughter again that she readily parted
with the cheque, and failed to take any means to identify the
wretches who had taken part in the dastardly conspiracy, and they
all disappeared. The cheque was presented the next morning as soon
as the bank opened, and the money was paid in gold. This
extraordinary story seems incredible, but we have taken steps to
verify its accuracy. It appears that Mrs. Leslie, two or three
weeks after the recovery of her daughter, mentioned the
circumstance to a friend, who strongly persuaded her to communicate
with the police. This was done, and every means have been taken to
trace the wretches concerned, but so far without result. As it
turns out that there have been several cases of the kind during the
last year or two in various parts of the country, we understand
that Mr. Tyler Tatlock, the well-known detective, has been
commissioned to try and bring the guilty parties to book.</p>

<p>According to Miss Leslie's account, while on her way from school
she was accosted by a lady-like woman, who inquired if she was Miss
Leslie. The woman then said that Mrs. Leslie had been taken
suddenly ill, and was anxious that her daughter should hurry home.
With great kindness, as it seemed, the woman volunteered to drive
her there, and, strangely enough, a cab was waiting close by. Into
this cab the distressed girl and the woman got, but instead of
being driven home the girl was taken to a house some five miles
away. When she began to get anxious, on realising that she was not
going in the direction of her home, the woman told her it was all
right, and opening a satchel she carried she took out a small
scent-bottle, containing a white fluid, which she poured on a
hand-kerchief, and she suddenly placed the handkerchief over the
girl's mouth and nostrils. Miss Leslie after that became
insensible, and remembered nothing more until she found herself
lying on a strange bed with the woman sitting beside her. The whole
story is so remarkable that we deemed it our duty to thoroughly
investigate it before giving it publicity, and we can now vouch for
the facts as we have detailed them.'</p>

<p>The foregoing sensational story emanated from one of the
well-known press agencies, which gave it an importance that
otherwise would have been lacking. Mr. Duff read it with an
interest begotten by the unusual features of the case, and yet,
despite the authority of the agency in question, he was rather
disposed to believe it was the emanation of some enterprising liner
on the look-out for good copy. Anyway, Mr. Duff's interest was only
of a passing nature, and soon he had forgotten all about it.</p>

<p>In due course, and in accordance with promise, Mr. Risdom
Tillstone arrived in Edinburgh, and was welcomed by his friend. He
put up at one of the best hotels, and Mr. Duff devoted his evenings
to him. At the end of a week they parted, as Duff had to journey to
Manchester, so he wished his friend good-bye, and left him in
Edinburgh. As he travelled south and opened his daily paper he came
across the following advertisement:</p>

<p>'Yellow Star&mdash;Caution.'</p>

<p>But for what had gone before this would have had neither meaning
nor interest for him, but to his mind 'Yellow Star' had some deep
significance, and for the first time he began to think seriously
that Tillstone was an adventurer. This opinion was strengthened
when he heard that a lady staying in the hotel in Edinburgh where
Tillstone had stayed had lost a jewel case containing over two
thousand pounds worth of jewels, chiefly diamonds. The report said
that the case had evidently been taken from her room one afternoon
while she was absent shopping with some friends. A Mr. Risdom
Tillstone, an American gentleman who was staying in the hotel, also
complained that he had lost a valuable pair of sleeve-links and
three diamond shirt-studs. No arrests had been made, and the police
seemed baffled. The name of the lady who had been robbed of her
jewels was given as Mrs. Combe Phillips, wife of the Mayor of an
English provincial town. Her son was studying for the medical
profession at the college in Edinburgh, and she had gone there to
see him.</p>

<p>After considerable reflection Duff wrote to this lady, and
suggested that she should engage the services of Tyler Tatlock, who
would recover her jewels if anyone could. He also wrote to Tatlock,
mentioning his suspicions to him, and told him what he knew about
Tillstone. Adopting Duff's advice, Mrs. Phillips communicated with
Tatlock, who saw in that yellow star a sign, as he believed, of
deep significance. On commencing his investigations Tatlock found
that Risdom Tillstone had departed from Edinburgh and left no
address behind him. Nor had he done so at the hotel where he stayed
in London. The detective had a long interview with Duff, who
frankly confessed that he had been very much attracted at first by
Tillstone, whose plausibility was marvellous, while his power of
questioning, with a view to eliciting information likely to be of
use to him, he had brought to a fine art. Duff could no longer
doubt that he had been made a tool of, and had been induced to tell
the Yankee a good many things likely to be of use to him in his
nefarious transactions.</p>

<p>Tatlock had not long been engaged in this particular business
before he established pretty conclusively that the American who
called himself Risdom Tillstone had been directly or indirectly
connected with the abduction of Miss Leslie, for the girl stated
positively that during the time she was kept a prisoner, a little
man, whom she took to be an Italian, came to her room and had a
long talk with the woman who was practically her keeper in a
foreign language the girl did not understand. And once while the
man was gesticulating a good deal, and lifted up his arms, she
noticed that he had a small yellow star attached to a morsel of
blue ribbon pinned inside of his coat. There were now strong
indications of the existence of a widespread conspiracy, with
ramifications all over the country, while the badge of the
conspirators was apparently a yellow star. In addition, the members
were able to make themselves known to each other by signs, which
fortunately Duff had observed when Tillstone met another yellow
star man at Covent Garden Theatre during the bal masque. Inquiry
further revealed the fact that on that very night at the theatre a
gentleman was deprived of a very valuable gold lever watch and a
purse containing nearly ten pounds, while a lady lost a gold
hair-pin with a diamond stud. The inference was that this was the
work of either Tillstone or his co-conspirator.</p>

<p>Altogether it was a pretty puzzle that Tatlock was asked to
solve, and though with his usual caution he refrained from
expressing any opinion, he was quite sanguine of being able to
clear up the mystery, and he set himself to try and find a key to
the advertisements which Duff had observed.</p>

<p>The Scottish advertisement carried its own meaning. There was
nothing cryptic about it. But the London one stood in another
category. To those for whom it was intended it was no doubt clear
enough. To the outsider it was mystery, and yet the more Tatlock
studied it the more he was convinced that it was an intimation of
some kind couched in pretty plain language. All that was wanted was
the key, but that key was, of course, everything. After much
puzzling he decided that the numerals '27' and '10' had distinct
meanings; that is, '27' represented a date, and '10' the hour of
the day. The paper in which the advertisement appeared was dated
the 24th of the month; 27 therefore meant the third day from that,
and 10 either ten o'clock in the morning or ten o'clock at
night.</p>

<p>So much seemed clear, and also that more than two were
interested&mdash;a number, in fact&mdash;and they were scattered,
and it was necessary to reach them through a medium which by common
consent they had agreed to use for intimations, and the intimation
was to the effect that there would be a meeting of the Yellow Star
League. Such were Tatlock's deductions. It now remained to
determine the place of the meeting.</p>

<p>'I've got it,' mentally exclaimed Tatlock at last. 'Shoreditch.'
It was a common thing for Londoners in the East End to refer to
Shoreditch as 'The Ditch' when it was more of a market thoroughfare
than it is now, and on certain nights the channels of the street
were occupied by costermongers' stalls with their flaring naphtha
lamps.</p>

<p>Tatlock, then, had so far solved the problem. On the 27th of the
month, at ten o'clock (probably at ten o'clock at night), there was
to be a meeting somewhere in Shore-ditch. 'Somewhere,' however, was
vague. It was a long thoroughfare of all sorts and conditions of
buildings, from the huckster's shop to the warehouse. As it was not
likely the Yellow Stars would hold their meetings in the open
street, their place of assembly must necessarily be in a house. To
determine the house was next to impossible without a clue. To get a
clue was the task he set himself, and he re-solved on a bold
expedient. It was nothing more nor less than the insertion of the
following advertisement in the agony columns of all the daily
papers:</p>
<br>

<p class="typewriter" style="text-align:center">
Yellow Star. The Ditch. 14. 10.</p>

<p><br>
If this carried the meaning which he thought it would the Yellow
Stars would read it thus:&mdash;At Shoreditch, on the 14th inst.,
there was to be a meeting. So far so good, but something more was
wanted. If Tatlock's surmises were correct, those who responded to
the announcement would have to be spotted. How was that to be done?
Shoreditch was not like a country road. A stream of humanity
constantly flowed through it. How were the Yellow Stars who mingled
in this stream to be distinguished? It was not to be expected they
would proclaim themselves. Tatlock had wonderful eyes, and saw much
that escaped others, but he couldn't be in two places at once. He
couldn't see everything. He therefore secured the services of four
trained men from Scotland Yard, and instructed them to observe
closely anyone who seemed strange to the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Although he took these precautions and made his arrangements,
let it not be supposed that he relied too much on the possibility
of the Yellow Stars walking openly into the trap he had set for
them. If, as it seemed, they were an organised body, somebody would
be in authority, and that somebody would hardly let his followers
be misled by the announcement. So he set another trap, and a very
artfully contrived trap it was. He had ascertained that when the
Yellow Stars advertised the advertisement was sent to the
respective offices by post, the cost being enclosed by means of
postage stamps, and no address ever given. This, of course, argued
great caution on the part of the band.</p>

<p>Now, it was highly probable that the leader or
organiser&mdash;whatever he was&mdash;would see Tatlock's
announcement, and would hasten at once to counteract its effect. He
therefore arranged with the publishers, and in the interests of
Justice, that if an advertisement was sent it was not to be
inserted. The chances then were in favour of somebody calling or
writing to know why the announcement had been left out.</p>

<p>Tatlock's surmise proved to be correct. Two days after his
advertisement appeared the following was sent to each office:</p>
<br>

<p class="typewriter" style="text-align:center">
Yellow Star. The Ditch. 14. 10. No. Beware.</p>

<p><br>
In accordance with the arrangement it did not appear, and after
the lapse of a day or two a letter, of which the following is a
copy, was sent to each publisher:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">137, Crampton Street, Pimlico, S.V.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">
Please inform me why my advertisement for agony column as
follows:&mdash;'Yellow Star. 14. 10. No. Beware,' sent to you on
8th inst., with stamps to cover cost, has not been inserted. If
amount sent was not sufficient, or whatever the cause of
non-insertion, please let me know at once. Stamped addressed
envelope enclosed.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="letter">(<span class="smcap">Mrs.) Maria Hutton</span>.</p>

<p><br>
The address given proved to be a little huckster's shop, and the
proprietor made a trifle occasionally by allowing people to have
letters addressed there. When a sufficient time had elapsed for a
reply to be sent, a woman called at the shop and asked for Maria
Hutton's letters. She was watched and followed to a very
respectable-looking house in the Buckingham Palace Road, which was
found to be in the occupation of a man known to the landlord as
William Priestly. He had lived there a little over a year, paid his
rent very regularly, and was supposed to be a commercial traveller,
as he was very frequently away.</p>

<p>Needless to say Mr. William Priestly&mdash;all unknown to
himself, of course&mdash;was very closely shadowed; as the French
would say, 'placed under surveillance.' It was understood by the
tradespeople in the neighbourhood that he was a married man.
Anyway, a lady-like woman, who gave her name as Mrs. Priestly, was
an exceedingly good customer. Butcher, grocer, baker, and others
were patronised by her, and she paid cash for everything she got.
Visitors to the house were numerous. They were of both sexes, and a
good deal of eating and drinking went on.</p>

<p>It should be stated here that the reply sent to 'Maria Hutton,'
which, of course, was a fictitious name, from the newspaper offices
was to the effect that the stamps which had been received were
insufficient to defray the charge. More were at once remitted, and
by Tatlock's instructions the advertisement was inserted, as he was
now confident he had got on the trail of the Yellow Stars. Almost
immediately after their announcement appeared, the man who was
known as William Priestly&mdash;a tall, well-dressed, gentlemanly
sort of man&mdash;left London by the night train for Edinburgh. He
proceeded to a self-contained house close to the Castle, where he
was evidently well known, and where he put up. The house had been
occupied for about a year by a Mr. and Mrs. Piper, who were
supposed to be Americans. They received a good many visitors, and
they often went away for days at a time. They kept no servants, and
as they were regarded as being 'well-to-do people,' this fact was
thought to be rather remarkable. A middle-aged woman, however, also
an American, lived with them, and looked after the household
affairs, and once a week a charwoman went to the house to clean up,
but, strangely enough, there were two rooms she was never allowed
to enter. Like Blue Beard's wives she was dying with curiosity to
look into those rooms, but unlike Blue Beard's wives she was never
afforded the opportunity, for whenever she was in the house the
doors were locked and the key taken away.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that while Mr. Priestly was staying in the
northern city there was another hotel robbery. It was not at the
same hotel where Mrs. Combe Phillips was staying at the time she
was robbed, but a well-known and deservedly popular commercial
house. The sufferer on this occasion was the representative of a
Birmingham whole-sale firm of jewellers, silversmiths, and
electro-platers. His name was Reynolds, and a box of very valuable
samples, worth over a thousand pounds, was carried off from his
room during his temporary absence. He was only away an hour, and he
had adopted the usual precaution of locking his door and leaving
the key with the hall porter, but the door must have been opened
with a duplicate key. It was the busy season, and the house was
full. Of course, a police investigation took place immediately, but
no results followed. The thief had carried out his work very
cleverly, and left never a trace behind him. It appeared that for
close on a year hotel robberies had been very frequent in
Edinburgh, and though the police had made unusual efforts to try
and discover the perpetrators they were in every case baffled.
Servants and certain visitors in the different hotels had been
suspected, but not an atom of evidence to justify an arrest could
be got. Naturally there was a good deal of feeling amongst the
hotel proprietors themselves, who thought the police were at fault,
and the loss by the commercial traveller of his samples caused a
very bitter outcry.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that at the time of this robbery Tyler Tatlock
was in Edinburgh, and the reason it so chanced was that he was
acquainted with a certain fact that was to lead to great results.
The day following Priestly's arrival from the south he paid a visit
to the Commercial Hotel to see a visitor there of the name of
George Clark, described as 'of London.' When the robbery became
known, Tatlock called upon the chief of police, and had a long
interview with him. Within a very short time of his leaving the
chief's office two arrests were made quietly and without fuss. The
men arrested were Mr. George Clark and Mr. William Priestly, who,
as may be supposed, were more than astonished. An hour after they
were in safe keeping four police officers arrived at the house
occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Piper, armed with legal authority to look
into those secret chambers which had so aroused the curiosity of
the industrious charwoman, and into any other part of the
establishment that they had a mind to. Mr. and Mrs. Piper waxed
furious. They protested that they were highly respectable. They
declared that if their privacy was outraged in such a way they
would make somebody suffer for it. Such a thing as the proposed
search of the house of such eminently respectable people could not
be tolerated in a free country, and as citizens of the United
States they guessed they would make the American Eagle screech to
such a tune that the British Lion would hide his head and put his
tail between his legs. Yes, there would be a fine old rumpus if the
police dared to take such a liberty. In spite of all these awful
threats, the police had the audacity to dare, for a magistrate's
warrant is a powerful instrument, and the outcome of the daring was
a marvellous revelation, and the 'respectable' Mr. and Mrs. Piper
went to keep Messrs. Clark and Priestly company, and the following
day the newspaper press had some splendid copy, and there was more
to follow.</p>

<p>To begin with, in those jealously-guarded rooms of the Piper
mansions the commercial traveller's jewels were found. But they
only represented a trifle of what was there. They were like the
lost luggage rooms of a railway station. The contents were numerous
and varied, and there wasn't a shadow of doubt that Piper and his
lady had no legal claim of any kind to that vast and ill-assorted
collection of valuable property.</p>

<p>From Edinburgh that night Tyler Tatlock went forth with a
feeling of elation, and travelled as fast as the night express
would take him to the British metropolis, and with the energy that
characterised him when he had business on hand he soon secured the
necessary warrant to justify a police visit to Mr. William
Priestly's London house, where discoveries were made which made it
certain that the clever detective had let in the light on one of
the most gigantic and remarkable conspiracies of modern times. A
league, known as 'The League of the Yellow Star,' had been called
into existence. The members of it, men and women, were bound
together by a remarkable oath, and they were governed by rules and
regulations which everyone had to submit to. The ramifications of
this infamous League spread out, not only through Great Britain,
but over the Continent and through America. All the different
branches were in touch with each other. The objects of the League
were plunder. The punishment inflicted by the League for any
betrayal of its secrets was&mdash;Death; and more than one
mysterious murder, as was subsequently proved, was due to this
astounding organisation. The meeting-place of the League&mdash;that
is, the London branch of it&mdash;was, as Tatlock had so shrewdly
guessed, situated in Shoreditch, where they had a warehouse where
was found stored thousands of pounds worth of property, as
miscellaneous in character as that taken from' the secret rooms of
the Pipers' Edinburgh house. Every member of the League was bound
to give up all he stole to the chiefs of the organisation, and in
return he had a fixed income paid to him, together with a pro rata
percentage on the proceeds of the sales of the articles he stole,
or on the money he procured.</p>

<p>In addition, he was provided with clothes, with medical aid and
comforts if he fell sick, and legal assistance should he
unfortunately find himself face to face with a magistrate; and if
he were imprisoned his wife and children, if he had any, or any
relatives or dependents he liked to name, were supported during his
absence. The abduction of Miss Leslie was traced to the League, as
well as numerous other abductions and robberies. The gentleman
known as Mr. Risdom Tillstone, whose acquaintance Mr. Duff had made
in London, was not captured; but there is little doubt that it was
he who stole Mrs. Combe Phillips' jewels in Edinburgh. Every member
of the League had a small yellow silver star which he could wear at
his discretion. This was the badge and sign. If two members met,
and were unknown to each other, they could prove themselves true
Leaguers by certain signs, consisting of a sort of military salute
with the right hand, and the placing of the left hand over the
heart, and drawing the right thumb down the breast. Not the least
remarkable part of this remarkable organisation was the fact that
its members were men and women of more or less culture. In its
ranks in London were broken-down lawyers, seedy barristers, a
disgraced clergyman, a doctor or two, and many other men and women
who had once occupied respectable stations in life.</p>

<p>Those who are interested in knowing what the result of the
trials of the prisoners was against whom crime was proved are
referred to the records of the period. Tyler Tatlock's duties, as
far as the League was concerned, ended with its exposure, but he
received thanks and substantial acknowledgments from various
quarters; and he was highly complimented on the skill and ability
he brought to bear in unravelling the mystery of the Yellow
Star.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>TRACKED BY TEETH</h2>

<p class="first">
THE sun of a summer morning streamed through the open window of
a London house, and lighted up a sombrely furnished room. It was an
unusually large room; the walls were lined with a wooden panelling,
and there was a large old-fashioned fireplace, with a carved wooden
mantel-piece, on which stood some trumpery ornaments, but over it
was suspended a small oval-shaped sixteenth-century mirror. In
striking contrast to this some cheap and vulgar coloured prints
were hung on the walls. Nor was this the only incongruity, for old
and modern furniture were mixed without any regard for taste or
art.</p>

<p>In a spacious chair, in an attitude of profound thought, sat a
man, his left elbow leaning on the arm of the chair, his index
finger laid upon his temples. His eyes, scarcely visible, seemed
fixed on space.</p>

<p>The sunlight streaming in fell upon a ponderous mahogany
wardrobe, the door of which stood open. On the floor of the
wardrobe was a large blotch as of spilled liquor, of a
reddish-brown tint, and in the immediate front of the wardrobe the
carpet bore a similar stain, although not so easily detected as
that in the wardrobe. And the stain was the stain of blood&mdash;of
human blood. It had soaked into the carpet and was not yet properly
dry, and if the hand had touched that part it would have been
reddened. There were two windows in the room. Opposite the one that
was not opened stood a quaint four-post bedstead. The bedclothes
were turned down. The bed had evidently been occupied recently, and
the undersheet was a ghastly sight, for it was stained with a huge
patch, irregular and uneven. The stain was also a stain of
blood&mdash;human blood. The pillows were splashed, and on one
could clearly be traced the impress of blood-wetted fingers.</p>

<p>The house was one of the large old-fashioned residences which
are still to be found in the neighbourhood of the British Museum,
and were the town abodes of fashion during the eighteenth and early
part of the nineteenth century. But nowadays they are for the most
part occupied by indigent people, who eke out their existence by
letting apartments. Not a few of these noble houses have been the
scenes of strange comedies of real life, and of grim tragedy, but
no grimmer tragedy had surely ever been enacted than that which had
produced those bloodstains in the sunlit room.</p>

<p>Yes, a tragedy! A woman, only four days agone, had been foully
and cruelly slain as&mdash;there was no doubt about it&mdash;she
lay in bed. And when life had ebbed away, or it might have been
before it had gone, her body had been thrust into the wardrobe,
where the blood continued to ooze before rigor mortis set in. Her
age was guessed at about thirty-five. She was exceedingly well
developed, well nourished, good-looking, with a great quantity of
very dark, almost jet-black hair. It was a case of murder, and even
at that moment when the sun filled the room with a brilliant light
the coroner's jury was holding the necessary legal inquiry, and the
mortal remains of the victim were lying stark and stiff in the
parish mortuary.</p>

<p>Exactly a fortnight before the ghastly discovery of the woman's
doubled-up body in the wardrobe, a 'gentleman' of fair speech and
manners, and sartorially respectable, called in company with a
lady, whom he represented as his wife, to inquire about apartments.
The tenants of the house, a Mr. and Mrs. Ravel, took in boarding
lodgers. The lady and gentleman were foreigners. They gave their
names as Luchessi, which is Italian, but they spoke English well,
though with an accent. They wanted two bedrooms and a sitting-room.
The reason for two bedrooms was, as the gentleman explained, his
sister was to arrive that night or the next morning. They were on a
visit of pleasure to the British metropolis, and expected to remain
for three or four weeks. The best bedroom in the house&mdash;the
room in which the tragedy was enacted&mdash;was vacant, and a
smaller one on the other side of the passage, and a small
sitting-room on the first floor. 'Nothing,' said the gentleman,
could suit them better.' The only meal they would take in the
house, probably, would be breakfast. When asked for a reference or
a deposit, the gentleman readily pulled out a well-filled purse,
and paid a whole month in advance. Nothing could have been more
satisfactory to the landlady, who was only concerned in getting her
rent. Lodgers came and went. Hers was the class of house where
people did not stay long. To her they were mere passing shadows, in
whom she took no interest beyond the amount of rent they stipulated
to pay during their temporary sojourn under her roof. The gentleman
incidentally, as it seemed, remarked that he and his wife had
little luggage with them, as, being merely on a flying visit, they
had not burdened themselves with anything beyond what was
absolutely essential.</p>

<p>Having settled the preliminaries, Mr. and Mrs. Luchessi went
away, saying they would return in the evening. Accordingly, about
seven o'clock, they drove up in a four-wheeled cab with a third
person, a young woman, who was represented as the husband's sister,
and whose name was given as 'Miss Bella Luchessi.' They had with
them a small portmanteau, a couple of handbags, and a bundle of
rugs. Having deposited their things in their respective rooms, they
went out almost immediately, and did not return until midnight.</p>

<p>As the day went on, the landlady felt very satisfied with her
new guests, although she thought they were perhaps a little
eccentric and unduly reserved. They never associated with anyone
else in the house. They were quiet, apparently shy, and gave no
trouble. They seldom rose before midday. Then they partook of
breakfast, which invariably consisted of coffee and bread. After
that they went out, and generally returned late. So much and little
more did the landlady know of her foreign visitors when the
household was stunned by the discovery of the crime. At noon on the
day of the discovery the Luchessis had not appeared. Nor were there
any signs of them at one o'clock. A chambermaid named Alice
Worthington thereupon tapped on Mr. and Mrs. Luchessi's door, and,
getting no response, she returned in about a quarter of an hour
with the same result. Something induced her to turn the handle. The
door, to her surprise, was not locked. She peeped into the room. It
was empty. The bed was disarranged, and there was some confusion of
portions of the furniture. The girl's attention was drawn to the
pillows, which seemed stained in a suspicious manner. She turned
the upper clothes down, and started back with horror as she saw
that the sheet was saturated with blood. Scarcely able to repress a
scream, she tore down breathlessly to her mistress and made known
what she had seen. Upstairs went Mr. and Mrs. Ravel to verify the
statement, followed by the girl. Yes; it was true enough. The sheet
was wet with blood, which had soaked through to the mattress. The
landlady ran off to Miss Luchessi's room. That was empty too, but
there was no blood there. A scream rang through the house. She
rushed back to the big bedroom, to find that her servant had fallen
to the floor in a fainting fit, while her husband stood almost
spellbound. He had, not knowing what he was going to reveal, opened
the wardrobe door, and there, doubled up, was the body of Mrs.
Luchessi.</p>

<p>'Murder; my God, murder!' seemed to thrill through the air and
fall on the ears of all, and there was an instinctive shrinking
back and a general shuddering.</p>

<p>It is an ugly word, no matter when and where uttered. But when,
as in this case, it is the exclamatory outburst of horror begotten
by the sight of the victim and the victim's blood, its ugliness is
intensified. Mr. Ravel recovered his presence of mind.</p>

<p>'Run quickly and get hold of a policeman,' was his order; and
the servants, as if only too glad to hurry away from that now
accursed room, went pell-mell down the stairs. Then the man picked
up Alice Worthington, bore her to a sofa in another room, and bade
his wife attend to her, and he himself went down to the street
door, where he awaited the arrival of a constable, to whom he
quickly imparted the startling news. The two went upstairs, and in
a few minutes a doctor, who lived close by, and had been summoned
by one of the alarmed servants, followed them. He did not disturb
the body, but satisfied himself that life was absolutely extinct.
The three retired. Nothing in the room was disturbed. The door was
locked, and an intimation of the occurrence conveyed without loss
of time to the proper authorities, and in a very short time the
telegraph wires were flashing the news of the crime to every
seaport, every railway station in London, and every town of
importance in the kingdom. From the first it was seen that the
murder was one of a somewhat unusual character, and it was deemed
probable that the suspected parties, being foreigners, would get
out of the country with the least possible delay. Tyler Tatlock was
communicated with, and he was urgently requested to try and get on
the track of the fugitives.</p>

<p>The man referred to at the opening of this narrative as sitting
in a thoughtful attitude in the room where the crime had been
committed was Tyler Tatlock himself. He was endeavouring to work
out a rational theory for the crime. To him it seemed clear that
the murder was a deliberate and deeply-planned one. Three
foreigners arrived with very little luggage&mdash;nothing but what
they could conveniently carry about with them. That in itself was a
suspicious circumstance when considered in connection with other
things. The woman who passed as Bella Luchessi was, as seemed
pretty evident, in league with the man, and if she did not actually
kill the other woman she was an accessory to the crime. The object
in placing the dead body in the wardrobe was not quite clear,
except on one hypothesis. When the body was discovered life had
been extinct, according to the medical report, about eight or nine
hours. It was two o'clock when the discovery was made.</p>

<p>She had, therefore, probably been killed about six or even
before. Anyway, the criminals had gone off without anyone in the
house hearing them.</p>

<p>The victim had been stabbed to death as she lay in bed, and
possibly while she was asleep. There were indications that the
murderer was nervous, and his or her hand unsteady. The woman had
been struck in the first instance on the right side, but the knife
was turned by the ribs. Another blow had then been aimed full at
the bosom, and the weapon had come in contact with the breast bone,
the tip of the blade being broken off, and subsequently recovered
during the post mortem examination. Notwithstanding that the weapon
was now pointless it had been driven with great force into the left
breast, and perforated the pericardium. There must have been a
tremendous flow of blood from the three wounds, and Tatlock's
deduction was that the body had been removed and placed in the
wardrobe to prevent the blood soaking through the bed on to the
floor, and so through to the ceiling of the room underneath.</p>

<p>Another deduction of his was this. The first and second blow was
struck by a woman's hand&mdash;Bella Luchessi's. The third and
fatal blow, in which great force must have been exerted, by the
man. The weapon used was one common in Italy, Spain, and
Portugal&mdash;a fine blade, about six inches long, shutting up in
a handle like a clasp-knife. By touching a spring the blade can be
made to fly out, and the knife then forms a dagger of a very
formidable kind. This knife, very much bloodstained, had been
picked up on the floor between the bed and the wall, showing pretty
conclusively that the criminals had become confused, and had lost
their heads. There was further evidence of this in a scent-bottle
which had been capsized on the dressing-table. The glass stopper of
the bottle had come out, rolled to the floor, and the contents of
the bottle had been spilled. The scent was frangipanni, a perfume
much affected by Continental women.</p>

<p>When the crime was committed the man was not dressed. He had
drawn on his trousers afterwards, while his mind was confused and
his nerves unstrung. Tatlock came to this conclusion from the fact
that round about and beneath a cane-bottom chair at the foot of the
bed several English coins were picked up. In drawing on his
trousers the contents of a pocket had tumbled out, and he must have
been so preoccupied that he did not observe that the coins had
fallen. Amongst the money were two sovereigns, a half-sovereign,
some silver and coppers. Now, unless a man had been suffering from
great mental excitement, he would hardly have left this money
scattered about the floor. But what was still stronger evidence of
the condition of his mind was that with the coins was a small gold
plate with three artificial teeth&mdash;front teeth&mdash;attached.
Tatlock regarded that as of great importance as a clue, and he
advised the authorities in describing the man to say that it was
probable three of his front teeth were missing. Nothing else was
left behind by the fugitives, except a hair-brush, found in the
room occupied by Bella Luchessi, and an old travelling-rug. Both of
these articles were of foreign make, as was the murdered woman's
clothing, which was lying on a couch. The corsets, linen, and other
articles were of good quality, and all foreign. The corsets bore
the name of a Milan maker. The stockings were English, and had been
worn for the first time. And a pair of almost new shoes had the
name of a Bond Street shoemaker inside.</p>

<p>This man remembered the shoes being bought a week previous to
the murder. A man and two ladies entered his shop, and one of the
two ladies asked to see some shoes. She and her companions
conversed with each other in a foreign tongue. The lady was very
hard to please, and tried on many pairs of shoes before deciding.
She was so long about the business that the patience of her
companions became exhausted, and they went away, nor did they
return. The lady remained in the shop nearly twenty minutes after
they had gone. She paid for her purchase with a brand-new
five-pound Bank of England note. As soon as this note came into his
possession the tradesman, as was his wont in such cases, entered
the number of it in a book kept for the purpose.</p>

<p>Such luggage as the fugitives had with them, they could possibly
carry. They must have gone off at an early hour, before anyone was
about except the servants, who at that time would be occupied in
the kitchen and the breakfast-room.</p>

<p>In constructing his theory Tatlock decided that the
probabilities were strongly in favour of the criminals having made
their way at once to one of the railway stations from which trains
started in the morning for the Continent. Now, there were no fewer
than seven stations from which a morning 'boat train' left. The
question was&mdash;Which one of those seven did they go to? The
distance from the scene of the crime to the nearest station was
relatively considerable, having regard to the fact that the
Luchessis were carrying a bundle of rugs and wraps, a couple of
hand-bags, and some odds and ends. Probably, therefore, they would
go to the nearest cab-stand or hire a passing vehicle. Tatlock also
decided in favour of Luchessi being the right name of the people,
and for this reason. Assuming that the murdered woman had been
deliberately and by preconcerted plan brought to England to be
killed, if she had been asked to go under an assumed name her
suspicions would have been aroused. There was also the likelihood
of the younger woman really being the sister of the man, though, of
course, there was something to be said against that theory.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Ravel testified that the victim always wore a
profusion of jewellery. She had numerous rings on her fingers,
rings in her ears, a costly gold watch and chain, brooches, and a
string of valuable pearls which she used to wear in her hair when
she went to a theatre. The landlady had been struck with the beauty
of these pearls. But pearls, rings, brooches, everything had gone.
Absolutely nothing was left in the victim's pockets. A wedding-ring
was on her finger&mdash;it fitted too tightly to be removed. The
one thing that Tatlock felt a difficulty in deciding was the motive
of the crime, but a careful study of all the aspects of the affair
left him no alternative but to decide that plunder was at the
bottom of it.</p>

<p>Four days had passed, but never a trace of the fugitives had
been obtained, and yet not for a long time had such a hue-and-cry
been raised. Every paper, even the ultra-respectable ones which
affected a pious horror of the sensational, made good copy out of
the minutest detail they could lay hold of. And where nothing
authentic could be obtained the wildest rumours were published. The
public were morbidly eager for information, while the proprietors
of the papers were eager for the public's pennies, and so the
'Tragedy in Blank Street' was served up every day ad nauseam.</p>

<p>The five-pound note which had been paid to the Bond Street
shoemaker was the first thing to which Tatlock directed his
attention. Inquiry at the Bank of England revealed the fact that
the note was one of a number paid to the London branch of a French
bank, having its head-quarters in Paris. Inquiry at this branch
resulted in very important information. The day before the murder a
lady entered the bank and presented three letters of credit,
aggregating two thousand seven hundred and eighty-four pounds. The
letters had been issued by a Milan bank in favour of one Signora
Valetta Luchessi. The lady was alone, and, of course, she was asked
if she was the Valetta Luchessi alluded to. She stated she was, and
furnished satisfactory proofs of her identity. With the exception
of ten five-pound notes, the whole of the money was, by her own
request, paid to her in gold. She had brought with her a large
wash-leather bag to receive it. As the bag was heavy, she requested
the bank porter to carry it for her to a cab, which was waiting.
The man did this, and he noted that seated in the cab were a lady
and gentleman. As he opened the door and placed the bag on the
seat, the gentleman said something to Mrs. Luchessi in a foreign
language which the porter did not understand.</p>

<p>Tatlock had not much difficulty in finding the driver of this
cab&mdash;a four-wheeler. But all the man could tell was that on
the day in question he was waiting with his cab on the Bloomsbury
stand, when a gentleman, accompanied by two ladies, hired him, and
he drove them to the bank, and thence to the house where the murder
was committed.</p>

<p>The Milan bank was communicated with by telegraph. But all they
knew was that they had issued the letters of credit to Signora
Valetta Luchessi, who had paid the money chiefly by Italian notes.
They knew nothing of the lady, but she had incidentally mentioned
that she was going on a pleasure trip with her husband to England.
This induced the clerk who transacted the business for her to
venture the remark that the sum of money she was taking with her
was an unusually large one for such a journey. Whereupon she
exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Oh, you don't suppose I'm going to spend all that, do you? I'm
putting it in letters of credit by my husband's advice for safety.
He says it's just as though I deposited the amount with a
banker.'</p>

<p>The clerk was much struck by this remark, and thought the woman
very simple. It was in his mind to suggest to her that it would be
far wiser and safer to place the greater part of the money to a
deposit account in her name, and have a cheque-book; but he
refrained from giving expression to his thoughts, as, after all, it
was no business of his.</p>

<p>The information thus furnished from Milan on the face of it
corroborated Tatlock's theory that the murder was the result of a
deep and organised plan, and his deductions now carried him several
steps further. The clerk of the Milan bank considered the woman a
simpleton. Tatlock came to the conclusion that she had been but
recently married, and was entirely under the sway and influence of
her husband. He had first of all persuaded her to purchase letters
of credit. Then he took her to London that he might murder her,
having first influenced her to reconvert her letters of credit into
hard cash. A question that may here be asked can be anticipated. If
he had so much influence over her, why murder her in order to gain
possession of that which he could have had without taking her life?
To answer this, Tatlock found it necessary to modify one of his
conclusions, namely, that Bella Luchessi really was the supposed
husband's sister. If the victim had been old and ugly, it would
have furnished a reason for the man wishing to get rid of her; but
she was a woman of considerable beauty, with an exceptionally fine
figure, and Mrs. Ravel, the landlady of the house, said she had a
charming personality. The servants also spoke very highly of her.
What, then, induced the man to kill her?</p>

<p>Tatlock had now proved that the party had come from Milan,
though it did not follow that they belonged to that city. And he
felt pretty sure that Luchessi and his supposed sister would not
venture to return to their own country, where they would run great
risk of detection. At this stage of the proceedings an Italian who
kept a restaurant in the Waterloo Road volunteered the information
that one morning&mdash;the morning of the crime, as he
believed&mdash;a man and a woman, Italians, arrived at his place
very hot and exhausted, just as he was taking his shutters down.
They had several packages and bundles with them, and they said they
wanted some breakfast as soon as possible. He supplied their wants,
and the man paid for what they had with a five-pound note, which
the restaurant keeper had some difficulty in getting changed. His
customers went away a little before eight. He had ventured to ask
if they had been living in London long or if they had just arrived,
but they showed not the slightest disposition to be communicative,
although they were his compatriots.</p>

<p>For the information of those who are unacquainted with London,
it may be stated that Waterloo Road is on the south side of the
Thames, and in this road is now situated the terminus of the
South-Western Railway. It at once occurred to Tatlock that their
object in going to Waterloo was to take train for Southampton,
whence they could get a steamer to Brest, Havre, Cherbourg, the
Channel Islands, or to the West Indies, Brazil, or North America.
He found a porter at the station who remembered having taken charge
of some baggage for two foreigners, a man and woman, on, as he
believed, the date of the murder, and his impression was, though he
could not be sure, they left by the 9.30 Southampton train. Tatlock
did not think it in the least degree likely that the fugitives
would make for the Channel Islands, as it would be putting their
own necks in a noose, and he rejected all the French ports in
favour of America. He ascertained that a steamer left for New York
the day following that on which the fugitives presumably arrived in
Southampton, and inquiry at the office of the agents elicited the
fact that on the day of their arrival a man and a woman booked two
steerage passages by the vessel, in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Brown,
but the description of them tallied with the description of the
couple which Tatlock was so anxious to become acquainted with.</p>

<p>The telegraph cable had not at that time been laid across the
bed of the Atlantic. But Tatlock found that by hurrying to
Liverpool he could get the National Company's steamer Helvetia,
which was timed to sail for New York that week. Her date of sailing
only left him twenty-four hours in which to do the journey from
Southampton to Liverpool, and make such hurried preparations as
were necessary. He managed it, however, and feeling convinced that
Mr. and Mrs. Brown were Luchessi and his 'sister' he steamed away
in the Helvetia, which, not being a very fast boat, took nine days
in which to accomplish the passage. The fugitives, therefore, had a
good start, but the pursuer was confident of being able to trace
them.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of two artificial teeth picked up with
some coins from the floor of the room where the crime was
committed.</p>

<p>Those teeth were front ones, and presumably Luchessi's. Apart
from the inconvenience he would suffer from their loss, he could
hardly fail to remember that their absence would make him
conspicuous. His hurried flight from England left him no time to
get new ones, and the chances were in favour of his going to a
dentist in New York. Any way, Tatlock acted on that assumption, and
he took steps to bring the matter under the notice of every dentist
in the city, with the result that he ascertained that a Mr. Jabez
Choate, practising as a dentist in the Broadway, received a visit
from a foreigner who wanted two front teeth made quickly. He gave
his name as Alfred Breda, and his address at an hotel in West
Street. The teeth were made and paid for, and the transaction
closed as far as the dentist was concerned. The payment was made in
American money. At the West Street hotel a 'Mr. and Mrs. Breda'
stayed for a few days, and the man inquired of the landlord where
he could get a considerable amount of English gold and some bank
notes exchanged for American currency. The landlord, in response,
gave him an introduction to a New York money changer. Having
completed their business, the couple left for Chicago by the night
train. When they arrived they had not much luggage, but they made
considerable purchases in the town, and amongst other things a
large Saratoga trunk, which was checked through to Porkopolis.</p>

<p>To Chicago Tatlock sped in the track of the criminals. The
American system of checking baggage made it easy to discover the
fugitives, because the railway companies deliver it at the place
where the owner is going to stay. In this instance it was forwarded
to a hotel largely patronised by foreigners, and there the
detective found 'Mr. and Mrs. Breda,' but neither answered to the
description he carried with him. The woman was described as being
very dark, the man as having a clean-shaven face. But Mrs. Breda
was a blonde, fair hair and eyebrows. Mr. Breda had a full beard
and moustache. This change in their appearance might have stood
them in good stead had Tatlock not been at their heels. But one
evening in company with two Chicago detectives he entered the
billiard-room, where Breda was engaged in a game of billiards.
Watching his opportunity, Tatlock suddenly butted against him,
nearly knocking him down. Breda was indignant, and asked him what
he meant by that. Tatlock roughly told him he should not have got
in his way. Breda, who was much the more powerful man of the two,
threatened to thrash him. Thereupon Tatlock seized him by the
beard, tugging at it forcibly, and, as he anticipated, it came away
in his hand. Breda made a dive for his hip pocket, where he had a
revolver, but the other two detectives were on the alert, and
seized him. He was quickly handcuffed, and he knew then he had been
run to earth. The woman was next arrested, and the two were at once
conveyed to the police station. An examination disclosed the two
artificial teeth in the man's mouth, and the woman's hair was found
to have been dyed. These two facts were sufficient to establish
their identity, but when their baggage was searched the most ample
corroboration was forthcoming. When Luchessi found that he was
trapped, he became taciturn and moody; but the woman gave way to
passionate and hysterical weeping, and she exhibited such nervous
excitement that it was necessary to confine her in a strait
jacket.</p>

<p>Several weeks elapsed before Tatlock was able to get the
extradition warrant, and in the meantime Luchessi exhausted every
form of law available to him to prevent his extradition; but at
last the prisoners were handed over to Tatlock, and he conveyed
them to New York, where he secured passages in a Liverpool-bound
steamer. The woman was very ill, and became worse during the
passage. The doctor told Tatlock that he did not think she would
live to reach England. Her dangerous condition was made known to
her, and with the fear of death upon her she made the following
confession:</p>

<p>Luchessi was her lawful husband. He had been a courier for many
years, and had made some money, with which he opened a restaurant
business in his native town of Milan; but the business was not
successful, and he failed. He had formed an acquaintance with a
young woman of the name of Rosa Torrino, who had a little property.
He suggested to his wife that he should pay court to this young
woman, go through a mock marriage, get her to realise her property,
take her to England, and there murder her. Mrs. Luchessi, being
entirely under her husband's influence, lent herself to this
dastardly plot, and agreed to pass as his sister. On the night of
the crime poor Rosa Torrino was drugged, and Luchessi insisted on
his wife committing the murder. She lost her nerve, and bungled,
and he, seizing the broken knife from her hand, plunged it with
great force into Rosa's heart. Torrino had formerly lived in
England as a lady's maid, and spoke English well. Luchessi acquired
great influence over Rosa, and induced her to convert her letters
of credit into cash by telling her that they would all go to
America and start a business of some kind. He persuaded her that it
was better to take hard cash with them to the States, as in
converting it into American currency a large profit could be made.
The poor woman believed this, and played into the villain's
hands.</p>

<p>After this confession Mrs. Luchessi rallied, but died about
three weeks later in London.</p>

<p>Inquiry in Milan fully corroborated the wretched woman's story,
and after a long and sensational trial, during which Luchessi was
most ably defended by one of the foremost criminal counsel of the
day, he was condemned, and sentenced to be executed. The sentence
was duly carried out at the Old Bailey, and thus ended one of the
most remarkable of modern romances of crime.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>THE BAND OF THREE</h2>

<h3>(TOLD BY TYLER TATLOCK HIMSELF)</h3>

<p>BY an extraordinary chance I was travelling one summer night
from Marseilles to Paris by the 'Rapide,' when a blood-curdling
crime was committed in the train.</p>

<p>From Avignon, seventy-five miles to the north of Marseilles,
there is a long run of over seventy miles to Saint-Etienne: at
least, that was the arrangement at the period I speak of. The time
occupied was nearly two hours. At Saint-Etienne a ghastly discovery
was made by some of the company's servants. In a first class
compartment a well-preserved and even handsome woman of about fifty
was found dead. She had been stabbed in the breast on the left
side. She was elegantly dressed, and her things were soaked with
blood. It was obvious that death must have been almost
instantaneous, for she was still sitting in the corner of the
compartment, her head leaning against the cushions.</p>

<p>In the same compartment was a man who seemed dazed and
stupefied. His face was covered with blood which had trickled from
a wound in his head and had saturated his shirt-front. The
excitement necessarily caused by the discovery had attracted my
attention and, I need scarcely say, aroused my interest, and, on
making myself known to the officials, I was accorded the privilege
of being allowed to see a little more than most of the other
passengers, who crowded the platform, but were kept at a respectful
distance from the blood-soaked carriage by a cordon of
gendarmes.</p>

<p>The wounded man, having been stimulated with some brandy, gave
the following account of the affair: The lady was a somewhat
eccentric Englishwoman known as Mrs. Flora Pennell. The man was
travelling with her as her courier. He was an Italian, by name
Joseph Stradvari. He had travelled a good deal about Europe with
her on various occasions. On this, her last earthly journey, they
had been to Monte Carlo, and had remained there for three months.
Mrs. Pennell was believed to be wealthy, but had a passion for
gambling, and had several times visited Monte Carlo in order that
she might enjoy the excitement of the tables. She was generally
very fortunate, and during this visit had won something like one
hundred thousand francs. She and her courier had travelled from
Nice to Marseilles with two gentlemen whose passing acquaintance
she had made at the Monte Carlo Casino. At Marseilles, just be-fore
the Paris train started, the same two men got into Mrs. Pennell's
compartment, and made themselves very agreeable; but, soon after
leaving Avignon, the courier was suddenly stunned by a blow on the
head. One of the two men had struck him with what he believed was a
life-preserver. But whatever it was he was deprived of his senses,
and remembered nothing more until he was revived at Saint-Etienne,
and he learnt to his unspeakable horror that his mistress had been
murdered.</p>

<p>He was able to give a detailed description of the two men, and
the telegraph was at once called into requisition. A small leather
case belonging to the lady was missing. The courier said that the
case contained her jewellery and about five thousand pounds, he
believed, in French notes principally. It was her intention on
reaching Paris to convert her French money into a draft on her
London bankers. They were to spend a week or so in Paris, and then
proceed to London, where the lady had a house in Mayfair.</p>

<p>These details I gathered up during the forty minutes' wait at
Saint-Etienne. The carriage in which the crime had been committed
was taken off the train, and the courier was sent to the local
hospital to have his wound dressed. I took my seat again in my own
compartment, and the train was once more speeding north towards
Paris.</p>

<p>An incident that comes under one's own personal observation
appeals to one more forcibly than it otherwise would do. And so it
was, I suppose, that I so far interested myself in the matter that
I followed the particulars of the French investigations as they
were given in the French papers; and when I read in some of the
London morning journals a very inaccurate account of the affair, I
sent a communication over my own name to the respective editors
giving a plain, unvarnished statement of the facts so far as they
had come under my own observation.</p>

<p>When three or four weeks had passed, I gathered that the French
police had been unsuccessful in their endeavours to trace the
criminals, but they proved pretty conclusively that the unfortunate
lady had been robbed of even a larger amount than that given by
Joseph Stradvari.</p>

<p>One morning, to my astonishment, I received a letter asking me
to call at the house in Mayfair which, I learnt on the night of the
crime, was the late Mrs. Pennell's London residence. The letter was
signed 'Bertha Pennell.' As a matter of course I complied with the
written request, and duly presented myself at the address
named.</p>

<p>Miss Bertha Pennell was about thirty&mdash;an attractive,
interesting-looking woman, dressed in deep mourning, and with a
settled sadness of face that was pathetic.</p>

<p>I gathered from your letter in the papers, 'she began,' that you
were travelling to Paris by the same train in which my poor mother
was murdered, and so I thought I should like to see you. I don't
know whether you are aware of it, but the French police have quite
failed to throw any light on the crime. In compliance with their
request I have been over to France three times to give them such
information as I could about my mother. But, while they have made a
great fuss and a show of doing something, I don't believe that they
have given themselves very much trouble, possibly because the
murdered person was a foreigner. Then, again, as there have been
several robberies and murders on that line, there seems to be a
desire to hush the whole affair up. Now, I want to know if you can
help me in any way?'</p>

<p>'But you forget, Miss Pennell, I have no locus standi,' I
answered. 'This crime was committed in a foreign country.'</p>

<p>'True. But, while you have no right to interfere, you are surely
free to conduct an independent inquiry.' Presumably I am.'</p>

<p>'It is probable,' she went on, that the murderer will never be
brought to justice in this world. But amongst the property stolen
from my mother were a medallion portrait of my paternal
grandfather, Admiral Sir John Pennell, and a massive gold repeater
watch, which was personally presented to him by George III. My
father set great store upon these things, and, as family heirlooms,
they have a value beyond price for me. The portrait was painted on
ivory, and set in smoked pearls and diamonds. I would give anything
if I could recover these two articles.'</p>

<p>I gave Miss Pennell to understand that I was willing to make an
attempt to realise her wishes, and, as soon as my arrangements
permitted, I went over to France, and had an interview with the
police officials at Saint-Etienne. At first they did not seem
inclined to be very communicative, but I managed to win their
confidence, and I was informed of what had been done. They had
utterly failed to trace the two men who were alleged to have
travelled with Madame Pennell from Monte Carlo to Marseilles, and
subsequently, at the last moment, to have joined the Paris train,
and to have got into the same compartment as Mrs. Pennell and her
courier. Although the train was not a particularly crowded one on
the night of the tragedy, nothing could be learnt about these two
men. Neither the conductor of the train nor the ticket-collectors
had any recollection of two men passengers being with Mrs. Pennell
when the train left Marseilles. Joseph Stradvari had furnished a
full description of them, but neither at Monte Carlo nor Nice could
they be identified from the description, and yet Stradvari averred
that they were in Monte Carlo all the time that he and his mistress
were there.</p>

<p>This failure to trace the men seemed to me very remarkable, and
another remarkable circumstance was that the railway company were
able to account for every ticket issued at Marseilles for the Paris
express on the night of the crime. Therefore, if the two men were
in the train, they must have been without tickets. Needless to say
that the weapon with which the murder was committed had remained
undiscovered. Mrs. Pennell had been stabbed with a very long-bladed
knife or dagger, which had gone clean through the heart. Great
force had evidently been used. Now there was no doubt that the
crime was committed after the train left Avignon, because the
conductor swore that he saw Mrs. Pennell and her courier on the
platform at that station. Between there and Saint-Etienne there was
no stop, and as Mrs. Pennell, when discovered at Saint-Etienne, had
been dead for more than an hour, the crime must have been committed
almost immediately after leaving Avignon.</p>

<p>Having got all the information I could, I went on to Avignon,
which is a town of some importance, with a population of something
like fifty thousand. There, in a quiet and unostentatious way, I
pursued my inquiries. The trains on leaving there, going north, do
not get up any speed at first, as there is a big climb up a hill to
a little place called Orange. It seemed to me, therefore, that the
crime was committed before reaching Orange, as after that the speed
at which the train would travel would make alighting from it a
matter of such extreme risk that few would care to venture it. Now,
the theory was that there were two men concerned in the outrage,
and both these men had to effect their escape. That would have been
comparatively easy before Orange was reached; afterwards very
difficult. I therefore inclined to the belief that the woman was
murdered after leaving Avignon and before reaching Orange. If two
men escaped from the train, they would in all probability return to
Avignon, for Orange was only a small place, and, as strangers, they
would have been conspicuous there, and some information concerning
them ought to have been forthcoming. But the French police had made
exhaustive inquiries, and learnt nothing. For my own part, the more
I pursued my investigations the more and more shadowy did these two
men become. The description of the men as given by Stradvari had
been very widely circulated, but had resulted in nothing. From
Avignon I went on to Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pennell had stayed at the Hotel de France, where she was
well known. She lived well, was considered to be very rich, and was
looked upon as a representative type of a certain class of
eccentric English people whom foreigners regard somewhat with
contempt. But Mrs. Pennell's eccentricities&mdash;which appeared to
be nothing more serious than a masterful and independent
disposition&mdash;were easily tolerated, for she had plenty of
money, and spent it liberally. She entertained a good deal at her
hotel, but I could not find anyone who could even vaguely identify
the mysterious men who were supposed to have done the deed. Nor was
she given, according to the French police theory, to associating
with anyone who would accept her hospitality. On the contrary, she
stood a great deal upon her dignity, and resented any attempts of
mere adventurers to get on terms of familiarity with her. She kept
Joseph Stradvari in his place, and always treated him as an
inferior and a menial. Nevertheless, she fully availed herself of
his services in every way. He wrote her business letters, he did
her commissions, paid her bills, and kept her accounts. He was
clever in his way, as he spoke four or five languages, was a good
accountant, and a capable manager, but he was by no means a
favourite. These small details represent the amount of information
I picked up; and, having spent three weeks in a useless endeavour
to strike a distinct trail, I returned to London with a certain
idea taking definite shape in my mind.</p>

<p>Joseph Stradvari was resident in London. I learnt that from the
French police. He was a native of Genoa, where his people lived,
but he preferred to make his temporary home in London, as he said
he was more likely to meet with employment in the British
Metropolis.</p>

<p>Soon after my return I made it my business to call upon him, as
I wished to hear a recital of the tragic story from his own lips. I
found him occupying apartments in the house of a widow lady in a
quiet street near Westminster Abbey, and a young Italian woman,
represented as his wife, was living with him. The French police
made no mention to me of his being married.</p>

<p>When I first called at his residence he was out, but Mrs.
Stradvari came to inquire my business. That was my first
introduction to her. She was of medium height, and, like most of
her countrywomen, intensely dark, with black, fiery, passionate
eyes. She spoke English indifferently, but French well, and one
thing that struck me as singular was she evinced almost feverish
anxiety to know my business.</p>

<p>I fenced her questions, and occasionally got one in of my own,
and drew an answer. By this means I learnt that she had only been
in England for a short time. She did not like London. The climate
was awful. The smoke choked her. The absence of blue sky and
sunshine made life unbearable; and then the people were so heavy,
so morose. Everything and everybody was so sad, so colourless. Ugh!
it made her shiver when she thought of it all. But, grace a Dieu,
she and Joseph were going to South America.</p>

<p>What were they going to South America for?</p>

<p>Oh, well, Joseph was tired of roaming about, and was going to
take a farm in Southern America, and rear cattle. They were both
very fond of country life.</p>

<p>It was not until three days after this interview with Mrs.
Stradvari that I saw Joseph. I recognised him again immediately,
although when I first met him it was under peculiar circumstances.
For reasons of my own I did not tell him that I was in the train
when his mistress was murdered, nor did I tell him who I was. I
said I had been asked by a relative of the late Mrs. Pennell to
call and see him with a view to eliciting some particulars about
her affairs. He expressed his willingness to answer anything he
could, but prefaced his remarks with a shudder, and by saying it
was a horrible, ghastly affair, and he should be glad to forget it
all. I began by asking if he could tell me approximately how much
money she had spent during the time she had stayed in Monte Carlo.
He didn't know exactly, but a good deal. She was extravagant.</p>

<p>'She entertained liberally, did she not?'</p>

<p>'Very&mdash;too liberally.'</p>

<p>'What class of people were they?'</p>

<p>'Oh, generally a good class, but sometimes there were
adventurers of both sexes. If you have never been to Monte Carlo,
you don't know what a very mixed and very peculiar society one
meets there. One has to be very careful.'</p>

<p>'Mrs. Pennell was perhaps not as careful as she ought to have
been?'</p>

<p>'I was always telling her that.'</p>

<p>'Have you formed any theory to account for her murder
yourself?'</p>

<p>'What theory should I form? It is all too terrible, too plain.
The murderers, they travel with us. When I am dozing they knock me
on the head. Then when I recover I find my dear Madame dead. Mon
Dieu! Mon Dieu! it is awful!'</p>

<p>'And having committed the crime, they jumped from the
carriage?'</p>

<p>'How else would they escape, Monsieur?'</p>

<p>'Have you any idea where the train was when you were
attacked?'</p>

<p>'It was soon after we had left Avignon.'</p>

<p>'Before you came to Orange?'</p>

<p>'Yes, without doubt.'</p>

<p>Why are you so confident on that point?'</p>

<p>'I have often travelled there. We had not left Avignon more than
ten minutes, and because of a hill the train goes slowly.'</p>

<p>I suppose Madame's death is a great loss to you?'</p>

<p>This question seemed to affect him deeply, and when he answered
his voice was husky.</p>

<p>'I am not the same man,' he said; 'she was so good. She pay me
so well. I weep for her always.'</p>

<p>'But, of course, a man of your standing will have no difficulty
in obtaining an appointment?'</p>

<p>'I seek no more to be a courier.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I&mdash;am tired. I am sick here, Monsieur'&mdash;he
placed his hand over his heart.</p>

<p>'Have you made enough money that you can afford to retire from
your profession?'</p>

<p>'I am going abroad, Monsieur.'</p>

<p>'Abroad!'</p>

<p>'Yes; I go to South America. There I buy a farm.' Then you have
made some money?'</p>

<p>'A trifle&mdash;a mere trifle. If I have not enough, perhaps I
can borrow some. I don't know. Anyway, I go to America.'</p>

<p>This practically closed my interview with Stradvari, and, as I
had no purpose to serve in prolonging it, I took my departure,
firmly convinced in my own mind that I should ultimately succeed in
clearing away the mystery surrounding Mrs. Pennell's death.</p>

<p>The day following the conversation I have recorded as taking
place between myself and Joseph Stradvari I crossed over to France
once more, and went direct to Saint-Etienne. The chief of the
police there was a somewhat pompous and self-opinionated gentleman
of the name of Souste. I approached him now with a good deal of
deference, and gave him to understand that I was charged with a
mission on behalf of the daughter of Mrs. Pennell, and therefore
was interested in the case, and was anxious to assist him in
solving the mystery, and, if possible, bringing the guilty parties
to justice.</p>

<p>He hastened to assure me that his agents had so exhausted the
subject that he didn't think a stranger and a foreigner was likely
to succeed where they had failed.</p>

<p>'But suppose your agents have been pursuing phantoms?' I
ventured to ask.</p>

<p>He was not altogether pleased by the question, and demanded with
a certain sharpness of tone to know what I meant, and the following
little colloquy ensued:</p>

<p>'You believe in the story of two men having got into the same
compartment with Madame and her courier at Marseilles?'</p>

<p>'Certainly.'</p>

<p>'The murder was committed after leaving Avignon?'</p>

<p>'Of that there is no doubt.'</p>

<p>'And before Orange was reached?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'You have ascertained the speed at which the train was
travelling at that time, I presume?'</p>

<p>'Yes, about twenty-two kilometres an hour.'</p>

<p>And you think that two men could escape by jumping off the train
while going at such a speed?'</p>

<p>'The risk would be great, but it could be done.'</p>

<p>'If your theory is correct, it was done, Monsieur Souste.
Remember, the night was very dark.'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'And the murderers would be labouring under excitement.'</p>

<p>'That is true.'</p>

<p>'For them suddenly to plunge into space from a train moving at
the rate of twenty-two kilometres an hour, under such conditions as
I have named, would be to run a risk so tremendous that I should
set their chances of freedom from injury as fifty thousand to one.
In the case of two men the chance of injury to one or other of them
would be many times increased.'</p>

<p>'I fail, sir, to see the point of your argument,' remarked
Monsieur Souste, with just a trifle of irritability in his
tone.</p>

<p>'My point is this. The night being dark, the men being excited,
the likelihood of jumping from a rapidly moving train without
meeting with serious injury is so small that we may dismiss it as
an untenable theory.'</p>

<p>'But perhaps they were injured.'</p>

<p>'Sir, having regard to the exhaustive inquiries you have made,
do you think it probable you would have failed to have heard of it
if one or both of those men had been injured? Let us assume one was
hurt. His companion would make for the nearest village to seek for
assistance. At that hour his errand would have attracted great
attention, and when the murder became known somebody would surely
have come forward with information, or, failing that, your men
would have heard of the incident.'</p>

<p>'Then what is your theory?' asked Monsieur Souste, displaying
increased interest.</p>

<p>'My theory is that the two men are phantoms.'</p>

<p>'I don't quite follow you,' said Souste, with a puzzled
expression on his face that was quite comical.</p>

<p>'What I mean is this. Two men did not get into the carriage at
Marseilles or elsewhere.'</p>

<p>'Then who killed Madame Pennell?'</p>

<p>'The courier.'</p>

<p>'Joseph Stradvari?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Souste gasped. The colour left his face. He drew forth
his handkerchief, and mopped his forehead. He seemed to be
labouring under suppressed excitement that was choking him. The
suddenness with which I had sprung my theory upon him had taken his
breath away, and for the time rendered him speechless. But at last
he re-covered sufficiently to blurt out&mdash;</p>

<p>'Impossible!'</p>

<p>It took M. Souste some time to recover from the shock I had
given him, but when he did he admitted that I had probability on my
side, and it was ultimately agreed that an accredited French
detective should return with me to London, and that we should lay
such information before a Magistrate as would justify the issuing
of a warrant to search Stradvari's baggage. The discovery of any of
the late Mrs. Pennell's property amongst his things would secure us
a warrant for his arrest on a charge of murder.</p>

<p>This plan was carried out, and in the courier's possession there
were found the gold repeater watch, the medallion portrait, many
other items of jewellery, and upwards of 4,000 in French notes,
which were known to have been in the possession of the unfortunate
lady at the time of her death. Stradvari had been too artful to
attempt to part with any of the property while the hue and cry was
hot. But he had made all preparations for going out to Buenos
Ayres. There he would have little difficulty in realising on his
ill-gotten gains. His arrest was promptly effected, as also that of
the woman with him, and after the usual formalities they were
extradited and conveyed to France. In order to save her own head
the woman, under the pressure and torture of French methods of
judicial interrogation, turned traitor to her partner and revealed
the whole plot. She had long been acquainted with Stradvari, and
she had once lived in Avignon as maid to a French lady. She had a
brother, a ne'er-do-weel, who had been in the French navy, but was
discharged in disgrace, after long imprisonment for severely
injuring a superior officer. She and her brother, who were sorely
pressed for money, urged Stradvari to kill his mistress. The crime
was to be committed after leaving Avignon, and the woman and the
brother were to be waiting at a certain spot agreed upon as the
train passed, and they would carry a small lamp as a signal that
they were there. Having secured the property, Stradvari was to toss
it out of the window to his waiting confederates, and then slightly
injure himself, and stick to the story of the two men having joined
the train at Marseilles.</p>

<p>It was a clever and artfully conceived plot, and carried out
without a hitch. The woman and her brother walked back to Avignon,
whence they got train in a few hours to Marseilles. From there they
journeyed to Paris, where the man remained while the woman
proceeded to London with the stolen property to wait for Stradvari.
The brother's share of the plunder was a thousand pounds, which he
very soon commenced to get rid of in riotous living in the French
capital, where, after his sister's confession, he was arrested. He
had been drinking so heavily, and was so saturated with absinthe,
that he was a physical and mental wreck.</p>

<p>The trial that ensued was one of the most sensational that had
occurred in France for a long time, and it is satisfactory to know
that the criminals met their deserts. Stradvari was guillotined,
the brother was sentenced to imprisonment for life, and the woman
to fifteen years'.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM</h2>

<p class="first">
AT a well-known commercial and family hotel, almost in the heart
of grimy, busy Manchester, a gentleman arrived one evening by cab
from Victoria Station. He had a foreign appearance, spoke with a
foreign accent, but lacked that distinctive something in his
bearing which so unmistakably proclaims the 'commercial.' In age he
was under forty. He had a dark swarthy complexion, dark hair, dark
eyes. He was very cheerful, and seemed to be in perfect health. He
had no luggage with him, with the exception of a tolerably large
handbag. The porter who carried it up to the gentleman's bedroom
noted that it was extraordinarily heavy for so relatively small a
bag, and the man mentioned the fact to the manager, who did not
attach any importance to it, but, not knowing the stranger and in
the absence of larger luggage, he requested him to pay for his room
in advance, which he did cheerfully. He gave his name as Karl
Reinhardt, and said he was from Dresden, but did not mention if he
represented any firm. He intimated that he was expecting letters
and telegrams, and that a lady would probably call upon him between
seven and eight, and would dine with him. No letters or telegrams
came, but the lady did. She was well dressed, and about Reinhardt's
own age. They had dinner served to them at a private table, and
drank a bottle of German white wine and a bottle of champagne.
After dinner they both smoked cigarettes and drank coffee and
cognac, and about nine o'clock drove in a cab to the Theatre
Royal.</p>

<p>It was long past midnight when the man returned. He came in a
cab, and alone. He was somewhat under the influence of liquor, but
quiet and orderly, although not very steady on his legs. In handing
him his bedroom candle, the porter offered to help him upstairs,
but he politely declined the man's proffered aid, put a shilling
into his hand, wished him good-night, and mounted to the second
floor by himself. Mr. Reinhardt did not put in an appearance during
the following morning, but that aroused no suspicion. He had left
no request the previous night to be called, and so no one thought
of going to his room to disturb him.</p>

<p>When two o'clock had struck and Mr. Reinhardt had not been seen,
the manager sent a servant up to ask if he required anything. His
boots were still on the mat outside of his door. The servant
knocked and knocked and knocked again, but got no response. So she
turned the handle; the door wasn't locked, which surprised her. She
peeped in and what she saw caused her to rush downstairs to the
manager, who at once went to Reinhardt's room.</p>

<p>Reinhardt had taken off his boots and his coat, but nothing
else, and he was found lying across the bed quite dead. He had been
dead for hours, and was stiff and cold. In the fireplace some
papers had been burnt. His bag was open and perfectly empty. There
was nothing in his pockets, neither purse, money, pocket-book, nor
watch. Not a letter or card of any kind likely to lead to
identification. Some name had evidently been marked on his linen,
but it was cut out.</p>

<p>As a matter of form, a doctor was of course sent for. The man
was dead enough, but the doctor could not say how he had died.
There was no wound anywhere, and the calm, placid appearance of the
features and the absence of any indication of pain or struggle
seemed to negative the suggestion of poison, at any rate of poison
the doctor was familiar with.</p>

<p>Necessarily, the usual proceedings in such cases were followed.
The coroner was notified, a post-mortem was ordered, and steps
taken with a view to try and establish the dead man's identity.
These steps resulted in nothing. The post-mortem examination made
it clear that the deceased had met his death by chloroform; not
taken internally, but by inhalation. There was reason to suppose a
very large quantity had been inhaled, and, of course, the question
that naturally arose to the mind of all who were interested in the
case was, 'Is it murder or suicide?'</p>

<p>If murder, then it was one in which the clement of romance and
mystery was very strong. If suicide, then it stood out as being
without parallel, as there was no record case of a person having
taken his own life by inhaling chloroform. In the dead man's room a
careful search was made as soon after the notification of the death
as possible. The faint characteristic odour of chloroform was
detected on some of the bedclothes, on a sponge on the washstand,
and on a towel that lay on the floor; but no bottle or vessel of
any kind that had contained the fluid could be found.</p>

<p>The legal investigation brought nothing fresh to light. The
result was that an open verdict was returned. Every effort was made
to find the lady who accompanied the deceased to the theatre, but
without success. The wide publicity given to the case could hardly
have escaped her notice, and yet she did not come forward. And so
the stranger&mdash;no money having been found on his person, and no
one claiming his poor remains&mdash;was buried as a pauper, and in
less than a week after probably the general public had forgotten
him.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, the police were not altogether satisfied
with the turn matters had taken. The failure to get any evidence of
consequence to present to the coroner was very disappointing, and
as the open verdict left them free to pursue their inquiries an
intimation was sent to Tyler Tatlock to the effect that if he could
make it convenient to journey to Manchester he might have the
opportunity of exercising his talents on a case after his own
heart. He accepted the invitation, and nine days after Reinhardt's
body had been discovered in the hotel bedroom he was journeying to
Cottonopolis, and as he hurried north by a strange coincidence
Manchester was provided with another sensation. A daring and
dastardly attempt was made to blow up the jail in Strangeways. An
infernal machine of some kind had been placed against the wall of
one of the wings, and fired by clockwork. Although considerable
damage of a kind was done, there was no great structural injury to
the building, but the moral effect on the citizens was tremendous.
There had been a good deal of Fenian agitation going on for some
time, and many sinister threats uttered, but nobody believed these
threats would result in anything.</p>

<p>When Tatlock reached the city it was in a state of red-hot
excitement, and leather-lunged newsvendors were yelling 'Houtrage
at Strangeways Jail! Hawful explosion!' Tatlock bought a paper, and
read the first crude particulars of the outrage; but, of course,
his business was with the case of the dead Reinhardt, and at a long
interview with the chief of the police he was furnished with full
details, and the following day he set to work, and as he studied
the mystery he deemed it probable that between Reinhardt's death
and the explosion at the Strangeways Jail there was some
connection, but he kept that idea to himself. He turned his
attention, first of all, to endeavouring to discover what were the
chances of someone in the hotel having killed Reinhardt, and these
inquiries elicited the following remarkable facts, which,
singularly enough, no one had thought it worth while to mention
before.</p>

<p>Two days prior to Reinhardt's arrival another traveller,
supposed to be an Irishman by his brogue, came to the hotel, and
gave the name of James Bingham. His luggage consisted of a leather
portmanteau. He was a very quiet, reserved man, and associated with
no one in the house. The only meal he took in the hotel was
breakfast. After that he went out, and did not reappear until late
at night. Three days after Reinhardt's mysterious death Bingham
paid his bill, and took his departure. It was known that he drove
in a cab with his portmanteau to London Road Station. But that was
all that was known. To Tatlock it occurred that it might be
advisable to refer to Bingham later on. In the meantime the
inquisitive detective pottered about in the bedroom lately occupied
by James Bingham. It was a very ordinary room. There was a
fireplace with the flue closed down, as is always the case,
presumably with a view to preventing hotel guests from breathing
too much air. The fireplace itself was screened by a fancy
arrangement of tissue paper of divers colours. This fireplace was
examined, but yielded nothing. Then there was the ordinary
dressing-table, with a swing glass that wouldn't swing; the more
than ordinary washstand, and the ditto chest of drawers. Into these
drawers the prying Tatlock glanced, and fished from one of them a
half-pint label-less bottle which had undoubtedly contained
chloroform, and beside it was a large coloured handkerchief which
as certainly had had chloroform upon it. It was roughly folded up.
When unfolded, Tat-lock detected the faint, sweetish odour of the
potent drug. It was much stained, too, especially the blue colour.
Now, this was a startling discovery. The chambermaid whose duty it
was to attend that particular room had not looked into the drawers.
She knew that, as a rule, passing travellers, especially men,
seldom used the drawers they found in their bedrooms at hotels.</p>

<p>The syllogism Tatlock propounded to himself when he started on
this Manchester case was: First, Reinhardt had been murdered.
Second, he had been murdered by someone in the hotel. The
conclusion he drew from these premises was that Reinhardt was one
of a band of conspirators; he had probably been suspected of being
weak-kneed or treacherous, and so had been sacrificed. The bag
which he had brought with him to the hotel, and the weight of which
had attracted the attention of the porter, had contained something
perhaps more deadly than wearing apparel&mdash;such, for example,
as an infernal machine or machines.</p>

<p>Tatlock examined all the arguments for and against this line of
theory, and concluded that if Reinhardt was murdered the murderer
was either concealed in the room or came to the room after the
arrival of Reinhardt. This justified the belief that the murderer
was an occupant of the hotel. No one passed out of the hotel
between midnight and the opening hour in the morning. A night
porter was on duty all night.</p>

<p>Now, James Bingham occupied a room only three doors removed from
Reinhardt's room, and on the same landing. For three days after the
crime Bingham remained on. Then he paid his bill, and left. A
subsequent search in the room he had occupied brings to light a
bottle that had contained chloroform, and a doubled-up coloured
handkerchief reeking and stained with the same chemical production.
If Bingham was the murderer, the question next suggested
itself&mdash;why had he left these evidences of his crime behind
him? In solving this question Tatlock reasoned thus: The crime
completed, what was the most probable thing Bingham would do with
the empty bottle and the saturated hand-kerchief? Thrust them into
his pocket while he emptied the pockets and bag of his victim. That
done, he would get back to his own room as soon as possible.
Conscious of the instruments of death being in his pocket, he would
pull them out. He would not put them amongst his clothes in his
portmanteau, for there was the possibility that they might impart
an odour to his things, so he placed them in the empty drawer,
intending to take an early opportunity of destroying them, but from
that moment they were effaced from the tablets of his memory. The
sensational reports in the papers would absorb his attention, and
no doubt also he had numerous other things to attend to of pressing
urgency, so that when the time came for him to slip away he was too
eagerly intent on his purpose to have a spare thought for such
trivial items as the empty bottle and the stained handkerchief. And
there they were, like handwriting on the wall for those who could
read, and Tyler Tatlock read it.</p>

<p>The next stage he took up in his endeavour to get a second link
was to ascertain, if possible, what connection there was between
Reinhardt and the mysterious woman who dined with him at the hotel
and then went to the theatre with him. She surely must have had
some guilty knowledge, otherwise why did she not come forward and
state what she knew? The press beseeched her to declare herself,
and placards had been posted all over Manchester and Salford. But
the woman spoke not, nor did she give a sign. That was ominous. She
dare not speak, dare not show herself&mdash;that was the only
logical conclusion one could come to. The cabman who drove her and
Reinhardt to the theatre was found, but he had nothing to tell
beyond that he had set them down at the door of the theatre, was
paid his fare, and drove away. They occupied seats in the dress
circle. The performance had commenced some time when they arrived.
Being such late comers the money-taker observed them more closely
than he would have done otherwise; so did the natty damsel who sold
them a pro-gramme, and showed them to the seats they were entitled
to occupy, which were at the back of the circle, as there was a
pretty full house and the best places were taken.</p>

<p>A sharp-eyed barmaid in the saloon spotted them. They went in to
refresh themselves between the acts, and sat at a little table in a
corner, and both smoked cigarettes. The fact of the woman smoking
was what first attracted the barmaid's attention. She could not
gather anything they said, as they conversed in a foreign language,
and they continued to sit there long after the act had commenced,
so that the barmaid had exceptional opportunity of observing them.
From their gestures and facial expression, the young lady came to
the conclusion that they were having a heated discussion, and there
were indications that the female was somewhat wroth and disgusted
with her companion. Her manners and actions suggested that she was
urging him to do something which was repugnant to him, and because
he refused she reproached him. Of course, all this was conjecture.
The barmaid could only base her opinion on looks and actions, but
the conjecture was no doubt pretty near the truth. Where they went
to when they left the theatre it was impossible to say.</p>

<p>There was yet one other channel in which Tatlock could push
inquiries. It has been stated that when Reinhardt had been dead for
three days, James Bingham took his departure. He had with him as
luggage a pretty large leather portmanteau, which was made
conspicuous by having a red band painted round it. He engaged a cab
from the hotel door, and was driven to the London Road railway
station. All trace of this man would probably have been lost from
that moment but for one fact&mdash;he placed his portmanteau in the
left luggage office. The porter in charge gave him a ticket of
receipt. The portmanteau was not reclaimed personally; but three
days later a letter was received enclosing the receipt, and asking
that the portmanteau should be sent off immediately, addressed to
'James Bingham, left luggage office, Lime Street station,
Liverpool.' This was done, and both the attendant in charge of the
office at London Road and the porter who conveyed the portmanteau
to the Liverpool train were struck by the red band. A cross, a
square, a diamond, a star, or flag was no uncommon distinguishing
mark on a portmanteau, but it was not often a band was painted
right round it.</p>

<p>At the Lime Street Station depot they remembered the receipt of
the portmanteau, which was claimed the same day by a man who said
he was James Bingham. The portmanteau was, by the owner's request,
put on a four-wheeled cab. The porter who carried it out of the
station noted that the number of the cab was 1313. The reason why
he noticed it was a peculiar one&mdash;he was a very superstitious
man, and had a horror of the number 13, and in this combination of
figures there were two thirteens, a circumstance which fixed in his
memory the fact of the peculiarly marked bag having been taken away
on it. The cab was easily discovered, and the cabman related that
on the day in question he took up a fare at the Lime Street
station, and a portmanteau with a red band round it was placed on
the top of his cab. He was ordered to drive to the landing-stage on
the Mersey. On the way the wheels of his cab got into the points of
one of the crossings of the dock railway, and was overturned. The
portmanteau was hurled from the top of the cab, and, to the
amazement of those who witnessed the accident, there was a loud
explosion, and a volume of smoke issued from the portmanteau. The
traveller scrambled out of the overturned cab. He looked confused
and frightened, and swore roundly at cabby for the mishap. The
portmanteau was partially wrecked, and while Bingham guarded his
damaged property he sent the cabman to a ship's chandler close by
to obtain a box of some sort. He returned with a small
packing-case, into which the remains of the portmanteau were
stuffed. By this time the crowd had restored the cab, which was but
little damaged, to its proper position. The case was hoisted to the
roof, and the traveller, bidding cabby drive as fast as possible,
got inside once more. He reached the landing-stage without further
mishap, and went on hoard of a tender with his luggage, and was
taken out with numerous other passengers to the Pennsylvania, which
was on the point of starting for New York. Half an hour later she
steamed down the Mersey, carrying the mysterious Bingham and his
exploding portmanteau with her.</p>

<p>This incident was not known until it was too late to stop him,
and unfortunately the Atlantic cable had not yet come into
existence. As soon as possible, however, an intimation was sent to
the New York police that it might be advisable to take charge of
Mr. Bingham and subject him to an examination. But he had got a
good start, and, alarmed no doubt by the explosion, he tarried not,
and all trace of him was lost. It was much to be regretted that he
was thus able to elude the attentions of those who were so anxious
to be more intimately acquainted with him, but circumstances had
played into his hands; fortune, luck, or chance, whatever one likes
to call it, had favoured him, and he was enabled to hide himself in
the great crowd. The man known as Reinhardt remained in his
pauper's grave. In spite of the world-wide publicity given to the
case by the press, no one deemed it his business or duty to come
forward and throw light where there was so much darkness. No man
can achieve the impossible, but Tyler Tatlock did all that man can
do, and by his skill and cleverness he was enabled to lift one
little corner of the veil which shrouded the mystery. The glimpse
thus obtained made it tolerably certain that Reinhardt was a
conspirator, and that he fell a victim to the jealousy or suspicion
of his co-conspirators, and that between his death and the
explosion at the jail there was some connection. Many years have
passed, but to the present day that Manchester mystery remains a
mystery still.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>THE NEW TENANT</h2>

<p class="first">
STANDING back from the high road that runs between Edinburgh and
Berwick, and within a mile or so of the latter town, there stood up
to a few years ago an old house known as 'Scotter's Farm.' There is
a story in connection with that farm; which for ghastly weirdness
would be hard to beat. It will be necessary at a later stage of the
narrative to enter into some description of the house and its
surroundings. But now it is meet that we should record the truly
remarkable and even appalling circumstance that brought a curse, as
it were, upon Scotter's Farm, until, being shunned by all men as a
ghost-haunted spot, it was razed to the ground and the land knew it
no more. Years before that came about a young Scot named David Robb
went forth from his native country to seek his fortune, as many
thousands have done before him. We are not concerned with the early
history of this young man, who was destined to become the central
figure of a tragic drama.</p>

<p>Briefly, he went first to New Zealand. He did not remain very
long there, and seems to have shifted his ground to Australia, and
is known to have worked for some time on the Ballarat gold
diggings. For a good many years afterwards he appears to have led a
nomadic life, shifting his ground and turning up unexpectedly in
out-of-the-way quarters. But what we are now interested with is his
doings in his later stages. He comes into prominence in Birmingham,
England, after long drifting about the world and leading a strange
life of adventurous ups and downs. At this period he was in
partnership with a Jew named Israel Behrens, and nominally their
business was that of electro-platers and needle manufacturers.
Indeed, they seem to have gone in for all sorts of things, and
amongst others they engaged in the disreputable trade of producing
spurious antiquities. Notwithstanding the very miscellaneous
character of their enterprise, it is extremely doubtful if they
were as successful pecuniarily as they no doubt desired to be.</p>

<p>It is evident that both men were somewhat eccentric, and of
miserly habits. They did not, as far as was known, associate
themselves with womankind, but lived together in a small house in a
somewhat lonely situation in the suburbs. Three times a week an old
woman went to their place to clean up and put things in order, but
with that exception no stranger ever entered their dwelling. They
generally went out together in the morning to their place of
business in the town. They took a mid-day meal together in a cheap
eating-house, and returned together to their lonely miserable home
in the evening.</p>

<p>In the conduct of their business they seem to have been shrewd
and even clever; hard bargain-drivers, keen traders. They had a
small manufactory in rather a squalid part of the town, and they
gave employment to about fifty workpeople of both sexes. They
treated their employees fairly, although somewhat hard taskmasters,
for they insisted on having their pound of flesh. They went on in
this manner for years. No one actually knew whether they were
making money or not, though there was a general belief that they
were doing well and hoarding their gold. They kept a banking
account in their joint names purely for trading purposes. Their
business liabilities were always promptly met, and, as was
subsequently disclosed, their banking transactions were only
arranged to embrace the affairs of their trade. The margin over and
beyond these requirements was very narrow indeed. Of course, this
state of matters could not long be kept secret, and in business
centres where Robb and Behrens were known much wonder and curiosity
were expressed by the hard-headed Birmingham money-spinners.</p>

<p>One morning David Robb appeared at his place of business alone.
The clerks and workpeople marvelled, because week in and week out
for years Robb and Behrens had arrived together and departed
together, so that it had come to be said secretly amongst the
toilers that the two heads were suspicious of each other, and one
was afraid to trust the other out of his sight.</p>

<p>The unusual circumstance of Robb appearing first on the occasion
in question so affected the curiosity of the chief clerk that he
could not resist the temptation to inquire of Robb if Mr. Behrens
was ill.</p>

<p>'No,' answered Robb. 'He came into the town with me as usual,
but had to make a call.'</p>

<p>Noon came, bringing the dinner-hour, and the workpeople
suspended their labours. Robb, as was his wont, went to his cheap
eating-house and fed. And there again surprise was expressed that
he was alone. He returned to his factory with the rigid punctuality
that marked his coming and going. The bell that recalled the
workpeople to their toil was still ringing.</p>

<p>'Hasn't Mr. Behrens turned up?' he asked of his clerk.</p>

<p>'No,' was the answer.</p>

<p>'It's very strange,' muttered Robb, with seeming concern.</p>

<p>The day wore itself out. The toil ceased. Robb locked up and
went home.</p>

<p>The following day on his way to the factory he called in at the
head police station, and to the superintendent he made the
following statement:</p>

<p>'My partner, Mr. Israel Behrens, left home with me yesterday
morning. We parted in the town, as he said he wanted to make a
call. On getting back to my house last night I found that he had
returned during my absence, cleared out all the money that he could
lay his hands on, and has disappeared, leaving no trace behind him.
You must capture him; return my money or I am ruined.'</p>

<p>The superintendent asked numerous questions, as he was bound to
do, and he got a full and detailed description of the absconder.
Twenty-four hours later all Birmingham knew of the disappearance of
Behrens, for placards were freely posted about offering a reward of
fifty pounds for the capture of the Jew, while particulars were
sent to every police station in the kingdom.</p>

<p>A week went by. Behrens had not been heard of. He had carried
off, according to Robb, upwards of ten thousand pounds and some
valuable business papers. Robb manifested great distress, and
became moody and sullen. He called frequently at the police station
to know if his missing partner had been heard of. The same answer
met him each time: 'No.'</p>

<p>Then he went down to his factory, transacted his affairs, and
returned at night to his lonely abode. Those who knew him noted a
marvellous change in the few days. His iron-grey hair seemed to
grow whiter, the wrinkles in his face deepened, his whole
appearance was suggestive of one who was bowed and broken beneath
an insupportable burden. This did not cause any great surprise, for
it was taken as a matter of course that the loss of such a large
sum was bound to very seriously affect a man of his penurious and
miserly habits.</p>

<p>The chief superintendent of the police of Birmingham, having
failed to get any clue, placed himself in communication with Tyler
Tatlock, whom he knew very well, and requested him, in the interest
of justice, and with a view to upholding the majesty of the law, to
try and strike Behrens' spoor. So Tatlock went down to the great
Midland town and took up the running. It was in the order of things
that he should seek an interview with Robb. When he made himself
known and stated his errand, Robb, as Tatlock records, seemed by no
means pleased.</p>

<p>'I was content,' he growled, 'to leave this matter in the hands
of the Birmingham police. I don't know what they wanted to go
outside of their own province for. It seems to me in the nature of
a confession of incompetency and incapacity to bring you on the
scene.'</p>

<p>Tatlock suggested that his presence did not indicate either
incompetency or incapacity on the part of the Birmingham
authorities, and that it was quite in accordance with custom for an
expert to be called in in cases which presented more than ordinary
difficulties.</p>

<p>Robb seemed to give an unwilling assent to this, and after a
time showed more disposition to discuss the matter and supply the
detective with the information he asked for. Tatlock probed deeply,
as was his wont. A knowledge of the habits and character of a man
enabled him to form some idea of what that man would be likely to
do in certain circumstances. From what he was told on this occasion
he came to the conclusion that Behrens was hardly likely to betray
his whereabouts by lavish expenditure. Needless to say, Robb did
not endeavour to find any extenuating circumstances for his late
partner. Indeed, he spoke with such bitter invective, such
ill-concealed contempt and hatred, that Tatlock was surprised, and
came to the conclusion that there was some long-standing feud
between them.</p>

<p>'It seems to me,' he remarked, 'that you and your partner did
not get on very well together.'</p>

<p>'No, we did not,' Robb answered, with a touch of fierceness in
his tone.</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Because he was selfish, grasping, and deceptive.'</p>

<p>'And yet you lived under the same roof, and walked very closely
in the same path. In fact, you were companions held together by a
common interest, a common desire.'</p>

<p>'Not quite,' growled Robb. 'That is only what outsiders
thought.'</p>

<p>'In what way did you differ?'</p>

<p>'He was untrustworthy.'</p>

<p>'Why, then, did you not take greater precautions to insure
yourself against becoming his victim?'</p>

<p>Robb displayed much irritation under this questioning, and said
angrily: 'Look here, I don't know that it is part of your business
to lay bare the whole of my dealings with my late partner. You've
been asked, not with my consent, to find him. All I've got to say
is, find him, and get my money back if you can.'</p>

<p>Tatlock did not enter into any further argument. He saw the
futility of it, but he formed an opinion of Robb by no means
favourable to him. For some time he devoted his energies to trying
to get trace of Behrens, but failed. Of course the quest was
rendered harder by the isolated life the Jew had led. He had formed
no friendships. He had few acquaintances, and those few could tell
but little about him, beyond saying he was very quiet, very
reserved, very secretive.</p>

<p>In the course of a few weeks the disappearance of Behrens had
passed out of public memory. Tatlock had failed to find him, and
when six months had gone David Robb had gone too, and Birmingham
knew him no more. He was at pains to let it be known that the loss
he had sustained through his partner's rascality had ruined him. So
he sold the business and his household effects.</p>

<p>About three years from this time the disappearance of Israel
Behrens became a subject of conversation once more in the needle
town, owing to the arrival of a man named Samuel Behrens. He was
the brother of Israel, but had not seen him for a very long period.
Occasionally at long intervals letters had passed between them.
Samuel had been in Australia. He had made some money, and resolved
to visit England and find out why his brother had remained silent
for such an unusually long time. When he heard the story of his
brother vanishing, he was shocked, and he repudiated with
passionate vehemence the charge of theft preferred against Israel,
and even of his being a miser. He said that he and his brother were
born in Russia. Their mother was a gentlewoman of good birth. Their
father was a trader in furs, and was very outspoken against the
barbarities practised against the Jews in the name of the Czar. One
day Behrens the elder was seized, and, under the infamous Russian
laws, was thrown into that living tomb, the prison of Peter and
Paul at St. Petersburg. When his wife moved on his behoof, she too
was arrested, and a lying charge formulated, so as to bring her
under the iniquitous law too. She was scourged and persecuted until
her heart broke, and she died.</p>

<p>At last Behrens was put on trial&mdash;a hideous mockery, as all
such trials are in Russia&mdash;and, of course, he was sentenced
for life to Siberia. Samuel and Israel were then youths. Samuel was
the elder. They had been cared for by an aunt, and after a time
were sent to England, the land of liberty. They both made a solemn
vow that they would labour, toil, and save in order to get money to
effect the liberation of their unhappy father. It was true he had
been sentenced for life, but every official, whether high or low,
in Russia is open to bribery and corruption, and if there is money
enough even a Siberian life-prisoner may be set free. In pursuance
of their object Samuel went to Australia, while Israel elected to
remain in England, and, making the acquaintance of David Robb
somewhere or other, he subsequently entered into partnership with
him in Birmingham.</p>

<p>Such was Samuel's strange story, and when people spoke of the
serious charge that hung over his brother's head he was furious,
and expressed a firm belief that his brother was dead. Naturally he
was anxious to come face to face with David Robb, but he also had
vanished, leaving no trace behind. Of course, Samuel learnt of
Tatlock's efforts, and he resolved to go to him and ask him to try
again to clear up the mystery surrounding his brother. The story
appealed to Tatlock, and, knowing what he did of Robb, he began to
think that Robb himself was responsible for his partner's
disappearance, consequently it was necessary that Robb should be
traced.</p>

<p>The quest began. Tatlock found himself once more in Birmingham,
taking up the old threads in the hope of finding a clue. From the
fact of Robb having led such a nomadic life, the belief was
justified that he would go abroad again, but somehow Tatlock did
not hold to that belief. His argument was that, as Robb was growing
old&mdash;he was much older than Behrens&mdash;a longing for his
native land might restrain him from wandering farther afield. It
was remembered in Birmingham that when he left the town he took
many packages with him, including a large wooden case. These things
were supposed to be such remnants of his household effects as he
wished to preserve. They were sent by goods train to Liverpool.
This fact was disclosed by the railway company's records.</p>

<p>To Liverpool Tatlock went. There he discovered that the goods
had been claimed and a receipt given for them by Robb himself. And
he discovered more than that. A poor man named John Saunders, who
owned a horse and cart, had been hired by Robb to remove the things
from the railway station to a lodging-house in a street in Toxteth
Park, where Robb had hired two rooms. When the job was finished the
man wanted his payment. Robb raised some pettifogging quibble, and
offered half the amount agreed upon. The man refused to accept it.
Robb swore he would not pay more, so Saunders issued a summons
against him in the County Court, and obtained judgment. Even then
he tried to shirk payment, and the bailiff was sent to seize his
goods. Then, and not till then, did he pay.</p>

<p>Tatlock learned that Robb remained nearly two months in the
lodging-house, earning the reputation of being a skinflint and
half-mad. At last he took himself off, and he and his belongings
were conveyed to Glasgow by steamer. In Glasgow he stayed for a
short time in a house situated in the Broomielaw, and finally
removed from there to Scotter's Farm, near Berwick.</p>

<p>This farm was a very tumble-down, ramshackle place. It had at
one time been an important holding, and in its palmy days had
comprised upwards of two thousand acres of land. But first the
railway cut the estate up. Then a factory was built on the land,
and finally a family dispute arose about the ownership. The
lawyers, as they always do, sucked the juice away. And when, after
years of litigation&mdash;and, of course, as long as there was
anything to be got the lawyers hung on&mdash;the case was settled,
there was only a wretched wreck for the victor. The house, as might
be supposed, had fallen into decay, and, as there was no land to
farm, it was a farm only in name. The owner was too poor to
renovate it. He would have got nothing by pulling it down, and so
his only hope was that he might find somebody who would become a
tenant. That somebody came along at last in the person of David
Robb, who took the place on a three years' agreement at a low
rental.</p>

<p>Nothing was known in the neighbourhood of the new tenant at this
time, and much curiosity was manifested to learn what manner of man
he was who was coming to the miserable 'hovel,' as it was termed,
and what he intended to do with it.</p>

<p>At last the 'new tenant' came himself, an old, haggard-faced,
grey-haired man, with white cheeks, and a vacant expression in his
eyes. There were no bairns or wife, only a cart laden with
packages. Curiosity was aroused still more. Kindly-disposed
neighbours asked if they could be of any service.</p>

<p>They were rebuffed with a grumpy 'No.'</p>

<p>The new tenant, having got his packages in, bolted and barred
the place, and went down to Berwick, where he sought out a
second-hand huckster's shop, and haggled and bargained and haggled
again about some odd articles of rubbish of furniture. He bought a
little coal and some wood, and he secured the services of an old
woman older than himself to act as housekeeper. She did not remain
with him long. She asserted that he was a terrible old man, so mean
and stingy that he begrudged every mouthful of food she ate, and
from morning till night was nagging at her on the importance of
practising economy. So the new tenant was left to himself, and,
though some sympathised with him, the majority of those round about
regarded him with horror and loathing. Thus things went on for a
little while, and the neighbourhood ceased to take any concern in
the new tenant.</p>

<p>One day a visitor called upon him. It was Samuel Behrens. The
two men had never met before. Samuel went there at the suggestion
of Tyler Tatlock. When Samuel made himself known Robb was strangely
perturbed, and was particularly anxious to know how he had been
discovered. He vehemently protested that it was shameful to disturb
him in his old age and misery, and he poured out a torrent of
violent abuse on his late partner, who, he averred, had ruined
him.</p>

<p>Naturally, Samuel asked many questions, but to all of them Robb
either returned evasive answers or would not answer at all. When
Samuel declared his unshaken belief in his brother's integrity and
unsullied honour, Robb grew more and more excited. He gave way to
incoherent ravings, and repeated again and again that Israel
Behrens had ruined him. Samuel's endeavours to elicit some plain
and definite explanation as to his brother's faults and failings
only served to increase Robb's anger, and from abuse he fell to
threats, and displayed so much violence that Samuel became
frightened, and moved towards the door with the intention of taking
his departure. Then Robb's manner changed. From a violent,
threatening, passionate madman, he became a pleading, fawning,
cringing creature. He threw his arms about his visitor's neck. He
moaned, sighed, and sobbed. He declared that he was a lonely,
broken, miserable old man, and it was all through his late partner,
who had wrecked him. But he was willing to forget it all, he said,
and bestow his confidence and affection upon Samuel. He used every
art and wile he was capable of to persuade him to remain.</p>

<p>'Make this your home,' he cried. 'Live with me. I have a few
pounds, and all, all shall be yours.'</p>

<p>Samuel was not impressed by this sudden display of regard. On
the contrary, his fear of the strange old man increased. There was
something in Robb's manner which made Samuel desire to get out of
the house as speedily as possible. But when he would have gone Robb
barred his way, and pleaded to him to remain.</p>

<p>'The world thinks bad of me,' he exclaimed, 'but you need not.
We will be friends, eh; friends, very good friends. You shall
protect me, and when evil things are said, you shall give the lie
to them. You will stay, won't you?'</p>

<p>Samuel by this time had come to the conclusion that he was face
to face with a very cunning and very dangerous madman, and,
thinking it was better to humour him for a little while until a
more favourable moment occurred for him to get away, he said he
would remain for a time at any rate. At this a cunning expression
spread itself over the haggard face of Robb, who invited his guest
to seat himself by the hearth, on which burned a handful of wood.
Suddenly, and without any preliminary warning, Robb sprang at the
other, and with a knife he had concealed hacked at Samuel's throat.
Then ensued a fierce, terrible struggle. Although wounded and
bleeding profusely, Samuel fought desperately for his life. He was
much inferior in strength to his opponent, but he made a bold bid
for victory. He succeeded by extreme exertion in wrenching the
knife from the hand of the other and flinging it away, though he
was terribly cut and gashed about the fingers. Not to be easily
denied in his fell purpose, which unquestionably was to murder the
other, Robb renewed his exertions, striving with all the strength
which the passion of madness gave him to slay his victim; but in
the end the staying powers of the younger man told. Robb showed
symptoms of exhaustion, and taking advantage of this Samuel made a
supreme effort, which enabled him to fling his opponent off. Then,
smothered in blood, his clothes hanging in rags, faint, half-blind,
and terrified, he escaped and sought shelter in the nearest house,
where the services of a doctor were secured as speedily as
possible.</p>

<p>When Samuel had recovered his presence of mind, he sent an
urgent message to Tatlock, who was staying at an inn in the town,
waiting to hear the result of the interview, but never for a moment
anticipating anything of this kind. No time was lost in acquainting
the police with what had happened at Scotter's Farm, and in less
than a couple of hours Tatlock, accompanied by two policemen, went
up to the farm. They experienced no difficulty in obtaining
entrance, for the door was open. All was silent. They entered the
kitchen. Blood seemed to be everywhere. There was a pool of it on
the floor, and doubled up in a corner was Robb. They spoke to him,
but he answered not. They touched him, but he gave no sign, and
when they attempted to lift him up they found he was dead.</p>

<p>From the kitchen they went to other parts of the house, and in
one of the rooms they made a horrible discovery. In a large wooden
case was a body, the withered, mummified body of a man. Subsequent
investigation left not the shadow of a doubt that it was the body
of Israel Behrens, and his partner had murdered him. How, it was
not easy to say. Since the crime the murderer had kept the ghastly
evidence of his deed by him, possibly under the impression that it
was the surest way of preventing the crime being discovered.</p>

<p>Hoards of money were also found in a box, mostly in notes and
gold, and there was every reason to suppose that Robb had killed
his partner in order to possess himself of his money, the
perpetration of the crime being rendered comparatively easy by the
isolated lives the two men led, and the unusual way in which they
conducted their business. Robb's own death was due to excitement
acting on a weak heart. That he was mad admitted of no questioning,
but it was the madness of the miser, combined with peculiar and
clever cunning.</p>

<p>It was some time before Samuel Behrens recovered from the shock
and the wounds he had received. But he ultimately did so, and he
succeeded, as his brother's heir, after some trouble, in obtaining
possession of the bulk of the money found in Robb, the madman's,
house. Scotter's Farm no longer exists, but the curious who may
find themselves in the neighbourhood may still hear the story of
the strange old man and his awful crime, which is not likely to be
ever forgotten by the good folk of Berwick. David Robb and
Scotter's Farm have been indelibly woven into the traditions of the
countryside.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>THE YANKEE TOURIST</h2>

<p class="first">
IN compliance with an urgent request Tatlock called at the
American Embassy in London, and had an interview with the
Ambassador.</p>

<p>'I want you,' said the Ambassador, 'if you can make it
convenient to do so, to proceed at once down to Edinburgh, and put
up at the Hotel Balmoral, where a certain James Washington Jackson
is staying. I further want you to watch this man closely, and find
out all you possibly can about him&mdash;trace his career, in fact,
from his cradle to the present day. If it can be done. Needless for
me to say, the utmost caution must be exercised in order that
Jackson's suspicions may not be aroused. My Government have
instructed me to take steps to shadow Jackson, and to employ the
best talent in England to that end.</p>

<p>'My Government have reason to suppose that Jackson is a
notorious character, one of the cleverest rascals in the world, who
has travelled everywhere, passed under many names, but whose real
name is Shapcott Darlton, who years ago forged an immense number of
United States bonds, and is believed to have poisoned Judge
Bronson, who tried and condemned to death Darlton's brother, who
was charged with shooting the husband, brother, and father of a
young lady with whom he had been intriguing in the State of
Nebraska. Darlton was, it appears, a man of protean character, and
so clever that he outwitted everyone, and finally disappeared from
the country. For years nothing has been heard of him, but Jackson
is suspected. Of course we want unmistakable proof, and we look to
you to supply us with that proof if it can be obtained. Without it
we should not, as you know, be justified in arresting Jackson and
asking for his extradition.'</p>

<p>Tatlock intimated that he grasped the situation, and thoroughly
understood all that was required of him, and in the course of the
next few days he had located himself in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>It was the summer season, and the city was full of strangers
coming and going. Tatlock had some difficulty in obtaining a room
at the Balmoral, but as he expressed his willingness to occupy a
garret at the top of the house until the departure of someone
enabled him to be more fittingly accommodated he was duly installed
in the house, and de-scribed himself in the visitors' book as
Ebenezer Gurney, of Manchester. He had attired himself in a tourist
suit, consisting of tweed jacket and knickerbockers. He wore
spectacles, and an admirably fitting wig of long dark brown hair
gave him a somewhat artistic finish.</p>

<p>He had not been long in the house before he spotted his man, who
seemed to be the central figure of a little group of people,
consisting of two or three men and four ladies, three being young
and pretty, the daughters of the fourth, a charming woman of about
fifty-five. She was known as Lady Gwendoline Tarrant, of reputed
wealth, and was conspicuous for her philanthropic qualities. She
was the widow of Sir Richard Tarrant, Bart., who had sat as a
Conservative in the House of Commons for many years, and was the
owner of Bingley Hall and thousands of broad acres in the hunting
county of Leicestershire, besides a town house in Berkeley Square,
London. One of the men in her party was a nephew; the others were
friends, one being the affianced of Ruth Tarrant, the youngest
daughter.</p>

<p>James Washington Jackson was a singularly attractive and
fascinating man&mdash;tall and powerful, with a strongly marked
face, keen, bright, dark eyes, perfect teeth, a good complexion,
and regular features. His cheeks and chin were clean shaved, but a
well-trimmed moustache shaded his mouth. He had a pleasant musical
voice and a polished, gentlemanly manner. In age he was about
thirty-two or three, and his general appearance suggested the
well-trained gentleman. There was a slight American accent in his
speech, which was far from unpleasant. There was nothing about him
to indicate that he was the villain the American Ambassador seemed
to think he was. And Tatlock himself was at first inclined to
believe a mistake had been made. It did not take the detective long
to discover that Mr. Jackson was paying court to one of Lady
Tarrant's daughters, Miss Beryl Tarrant, a very charming young
woman of three-and-twenty, and it was obvious that he was a persona
grata with the family and their friends.</p>

<p>For four days Tatlock closely watched the movements of Mr.
Jackson, but saw not a sign to warrant a suspicion of the man's
honesty. At length the party took their departure and journeyed
through the Trossachs. Tatlock went with them, though he was not of
their party, and no one suspected that this quiet, demure,
unostentatious little gentleman, who was so primly dressed, and
moved about as though even with his spectacles he had a difficulty
in seeing, was shadowing them.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson was either very well acquainted with the country, or
had been at special pains to post himself up, for he constituted
himself the guide of the party, and his knowledge seemed of the
cyclopaedic order. He had the story of Rob Roy at his tongue's end.
Ellen's Isle aroused his poetic fervour. He recited with correct
intonation and an obvious appreciation of its beauties the stirring
description of the fight between Fitzjames and Roderick Dhu. He
expatiated on the merits of Scott, and rattled off long quotations
with a grace and facility that greatly impressed his listeners, and
drew around him a number of curious and admiring strangers, who
regarded the well-informed and well-spoken gentleman as a man worth
knowing.</p>

<p>From Glasgow the party visited Ayrshire, and trod the scenes
that are endeared for ever to Scotsmen by the genius of Burns. And
here again Mr. Jackson was equally at home, and proved himself as
familiar with the ploughman poet as he was with Scott.</p>

<p>Returning to Glasgow, they rested for a couple of days and then
took their departure for Oban, from whence they visited Staffa and
Iona, and afterwards continued their journey to Inverness.</p>

<p>During all this time Tatlock had kept in touch with them, and
yet had avoided attracting their notice in any way. And his mission
so far had been fruitless. He had learnt nothing about Jackson
beyond that he was exceptionally clever, singularly well read, a
good talker, but a poser; on the other hand, he was vain, and in
some respects frivolous, and it was clear he liked to be regarded
as a person of importance. In all this, of course, there was
nothing that warranted suspicion of the man's honesty, but by this
time Tatlock had come to the conclusion that beneath Jackson's
affable and polished manner there lurked a demon.</p>

<p>The first glimpse he got of this was at Oban. After landing from
the trip to Staffa, Jackson was coming over the gangway from the
steamer, when a small nail, which had been carelessly left sticking
out in the rail, ripped one of Jackson's kid gloves&mdash;he was
wearing light-coloured gloves that fitted him to perfection. This
trifling incident would never have disturbed the equanimity of a
well-balanced mind, but the effect on Jackson was marvellous,
magical. His usual expression underwent a complete change. From his
eyes flashed a light of such wrath and fury that the man looked
positively demoniacal. A deep frown furrowed his brow, his lips
were compressed, he ground his teeth, and a fiery passion displayed
itself in every feature.</p>

<p>It chanced that Tatlock was standing on the landing&mdash;place
amongst the crowd when this little incident occurred. Jackson's
exhibition of temper came and passed like a flash, but it did not
escape the watcher, who was able also to gauge its significance,
and from that moment Tatlock decided that his man was a consummate
actor, and that there was infinitely more of the fiend than the
saint in his composition. Possibly no one else saw the change. At
any rate, if they did, they did not attach the same importance to
it that Tatlock did. A minute after the little accident Jackson was
laughing and chatting to Beryl Tarrant, and making a joke about the
torn glove.</p>

<p>A few days were spent in Inverness, and the battlefield of
Culloden was visited. Then the party moved on to Loch Maree. It was
here that Tatlock's patience and perseverance in watching and
waiting were rewarded. The day after their arrival a special
messenger came over from the post office five miles away with a
telegram for Mr. Jackson. Tatlock a little later became aware that
Jackson had made arrangements with the landlord to be driven with
all speed to the nearest railway station, as he had to catch the
train that night for London. There was consternation amongst the
Tarrant party when Jackson announced his departure, but he consoled
them by promising to be back in five days, when they would continue
their tour to the Isle of Skye.</p>

<p>Tatlock recognised the necessity of still keeping an eye on the
man he was shadowing. The difficulties of the situation created by
the receipt of that telegram were very great, but Tatlock was equal
to them. It was of course of the highest importance that he should
avoid arousing Jackson's suspicions, as that might have frustrated
the whole plan for acquiring the necessary information about him.
So he put a knapsack on his back containing a few necessary
articles, and, leaving the rest of his things in the hands of the
landlord, told him he was going to make a little tramp in the
district, and would be back in a few days. Then he slipped quietly
away, steered for a farm he had spotted, and bargained with the
farmer to drive him to the station to catch a train due before the
one by which Jackson was going to travel. This train was caught.
Tatlock left his knapsack in the left luggage office of the
station, and proceeded to Inverness. He was at the station when the
next train arrived, bringing Jackson, and the two men travelled
then to Edinburgh, though Jackson was all unconscious that he was
being shadowed.</p>

<p>The next day they went up to London, and Jackson engaged a room
at the London and North-Western Hotel; so did Tatlock. At this
hotel Jackson was met by a superbly dressed, handsome woman, and it
was evident she imparted some unpleasant news to him. They had
ordered supper, and sat together at a small table in the
dining-room. The woman handed Jackson a letter to read. As he read
it he bit his lip and frowned deeply. The contents of that letter
annoyed him greatly. When he had read it he sank into a fit of
abstraction; then he slowly tore the letter into minute pieces and
dropped them into a tumbler on the table.</p>

<p>Tatlock addressed himself to a waiter. You see that tumbler with
pieces of paper in it on the table where that lady and gentleman
are sitting. Bring it to me without attracting attention, and you
shall have a sovereign.</p>

<p>The waiter was naturally curious, but he was also discreet. A
sovereign was not to be sneezed at for so small a service, and he
secured it. As soon as he was in possession of the fragments of the
letter Tatlock went to his room, and with infinite patience
succeeded in putting that letter together, and this is what he
read:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">The Club, Boston, U.S.A.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My dear Julia</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">
A catastrophe has happened. Dear Old Joe has been nabbed,
although they may have a difficulty in proving anything against
him, for you know how cautious he is. But, if anything is
discovered, it will be awkward for all concerned. Get hold of the
boss without a moment's loss of time, and put him on his guard. He
is so prolific in resource that he may be able to suggest some
means of throwing a shield over Joe, whom we must try and save at
all costs. I am watching developments, and ready to skip at a
moment's notice. I will write more fully by the next mail. But give
the boss the tip immediately. Perhaps he will come across the
pond.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours eternally,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Jacinithia.</span></p>

<p><br>
This letter revealed a good deal, and left no room to doubt that
Jackson was the 'boss' referred to, and that he was a rascal.
Tatlock soon determined on the course to pursue. In a few hours he
was travelling back to Scotland, and as fast as trains and coach
would take him he made his way to Loch Maree, where he found Lady
Tarrant and her daughters and friends still staying there. When he
had made himself presentable after his long journey, he sought an
interview with Lady Tarrant, and opened the ball by asking her how
long she had known James Washington Jackson.</p>

<p>'Only three months,' she said. She had made his acquaintance at
Grasmere, in the English Lake Country. He represented himself as
being a nephew of the renowned Stonewall Jackson, who won fame
during the American Civil War. His father, according to his
account, was a very wealthy man, and was a High Court Judge in the
State of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>'Of course, you have no reason to doubt the truthfulness of
these statements?'</p>

<p>'None whatever.'</p>

<p>'And Mr. Jackson is engaged to one of your daughters?'</p>

<p>'Yes, to Beryl. They are very fond of each other.'</p>

<p>'I presume I am right in supposing that if you were assured that
Mr. Jackson was an adventurer you would not allow your daughter to
see him again?'</p>

<p>Lady Tarrant uttered a little suppressed scream. The bare
suggestion of such a possibility shocked her. Then she was
indignant, and said some harsh things.</p>

<p>'Madam,' said Tatlock, 'please have a little patience. I have a
duty to perform, and before long I think I may be able to prove to
you that Mr. Jackson has deceived you, and that he is not the
person he represents himself to be. Failing that, nothing remains
for me to do but offer my abject apology. You will, however,
confess that it is better to suspect than to be deceived. If Mr.
Jackson became the husband of your daughter, and turned out to be
an impostor and a scamp, you would be sorry, but sorrow would be of
no avail. Better, therefore, to err on the side of caution.'</p>

<p>Lady Tarrant could not find fault with the logic of this
argument, and the result was she promised to be silent and secret
until the time came to speak, and she undertook to assist Tatlock
in every way.</p>

<p>In the course of conversation she had mentioned incidentally
that Jackson had placed in her care when he went away a small
despatch box, saying that it contained valuables, and he asked her
to guard it jealously till his return. No doubt he was under the
impression that this box could not be in safer hands than those of
his prospective mother-in-law. And this impression would have been
right under other circumstances. As matters now stood, Tatlock
re-quested her to let him have the box for a short time. At first
she was very reluctant to do this, but yielded at last to his
arguments, subject to a condition that it should be opened in her
presence. This was agreed to, the services of a village blacksmith
were secured, and he succeeded after some difficulty in picking the
lock.</p>

<p>The contents of the box were principally papers, but amongst
them were several United States bonds, cheque books of various
English banks and of the Bank of New York. There were scores of
letters, and these, together with other documents, proved that
'Jackson' was an assumed name; that the man had passed under many
aliases, but that his real name was Shapcott Darlton. There was
also a book containing the names and addresses of a large number of
titled and wealthy people in England and elsewhere. Amongst them
was the name of Lady Tarrant, with this comment:</p>

<p>'Rich, with unmarried daughters. Said to be an old fool and
easily gulled.'</p>

<p>Lady Tarrant almost had a fit when she read this. It was a
terrible blow to her pride and self-respect, and she could not
avoid an articulate prayer of thankfulness that she had so narrowly
escaped the trap set for her by the clever rascal Darlton, who,
although a man of immense cleverness and ability, chose to walk in
the paths of vice rather than apply his talents to the benefit of
his fellow-beings, as he might have done, while enriching himself
at the same time. Of course his abilities, added to his polished
and plausible manner, made him terribly dangerous. He was the head
of a little band of educated and expert rogues, all related by ties
of blood, and who resorted to the most daring and complicated
crimes in various parts of the world in order that they might
enrich themselves.</p>

<p>Tatlock's task had finished. He briefly telegraphed at follows
to the American Ambassador: 'Jackson is Shapcots Darlton.'</p>

<p>In a very short time afterwards Darlton was arrested, and his
box of documentary evidence was seized. The woman he had met at the
London and North-Western Hotel turned out to be his cousin, and the
person who had sent the warning to her from America was another
cousin. In due course the man and woman were extradited and sent
hack to the States, where they were subsequently found guilty of
many crimes, and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CLINTON &amp; HILLS' DEED-BOX</h2>

<p class="first">
ONE blistering August day, when London was sweltering under a
tropical sun and the one aim and object of every-one seemed to be
to get cooling drinks, two young men, carrying between them a
solicitor's deed-box, slowly and wearily toiled up Chancery Lane.
Horses, pedestrians, drivers, everyone suffered from languidness
begotten of the heat. The wood pavement sweated out its tar until
the atmosphere reeked with a sickening odour. The stones were hot,
the walls of the houses were hot, the iron railings would have
blistered the hands that touched them. The sky was cloudless; there
was no wind; the sun's rays were like a thrice-heated fiery
furnace. The policemen on point-duty mopped their steaming faces,
and puffed and groaned. Italian ice-cream vendors did a roaring
trade at the street-corners, and everywhere where they could be
obtained cooled drinks, drinks, drinks were in brisk demand.</p>

<p>The two young men carrying the deed-box, on which was painted in
white letters 'Re Edward Burley, Esq., Deceased,' moved with an
evident sense of oppression. They swung the box between them with
the air of men who were longing to creep into some cool and shady
corner and go to sleep. They were lawyers' touts and clerks; they
were ill paid, they fed coarsely, and they were cunning after their
kind; but still they were human, and never having seen much of the
sun, for they had never been out of England, they were
overcome.</p>

<p>Coming from the opposite direction, a stranger stopped and
addressed them. He wore a top-hat and frockcoat, its hideous
blackness relieved by a splash of red at the buttonhole&mdash;a
crimson rose. He didn't seem much affected by the heat, though, as
he stopped, he removed his headgear and mopped his forehead.</p>

<p>'Can you tell me where Crim, Crisp &amp; Co.'s place is?' he
asked of the clerks.</p>

<p>'Why, you're coming away from it,' answered one. 'It's up in
Gray's Inn, out of Holborn.'</p>

<p>'What a nuisance!' exclaimed the stranger, irritably. 'Some fool
told me it was in the Middle Temple.'</p>

<p>The clerks laughed in chorus. 'We are going towards Gray's Inn,
and will direct you, if you like.'</p>

<p>'It's very kind of you.' He turned in his steps and went with
them. Presently he stopped. There was a tempting-looking public at
the corner of a street. 'By Jove, I'm parched,' he said. 'I must go
and have a drink.' He moved towards the door. The clerks looked
longingly. He halted. 'Will you fellows join me?' Of course the
fellows would.</p>

<p>The three went in through a side doorway. On the door was
painted the legend 'Private Bar.' The stranger was affable,
courtly, and liberal. 'Three large whiskies and soda, with a huge
block of ice in each,' was his order. The ice fluid was grateful to
the cracked lips and parched throats of the clerks. They had put
the deed-box on a fixed seat against the panelling of the
compartment. The bar was pretty full, and people came and went. The
whiskies and soda were consumed, and with princely liberality the
courteous stranger commanded the glasses to be replenished. But joy
and pleasure were ever evanescent. Twenty minutes or so had passed.
The clerks felt hotter than ever, but their throats were not so
parched. They turned to go, and to their amazement found that the
deed-box had gone before them. Possibly it was a teetotal deed-box,
and objected to a public-house bar. Anyway, it had disappeared. The
young men rushed out. They looked north and they looked south, but
the box was not visible.</p>

<p>The stranger commiserated with them, and wondered what sort of
'bally rascal' it was who was mean enough to steal a lawyer's
deed-box. Agitated with a great distress, the young men discussed
the situation. It was a very serious one for them. It meant ruin,
for they would be dismissed without character, and even a lawyer's
clerk must have a character of some sort for appearance sake. There
was but one thing to do under the circumstances, and they did it.
That was, they hurried off to the nearest police station to make
known their loss, and of course they parted from the stranger, and
saw him no more. As may be surmised, the case passed into the hands
of Tyler Tatlock, for it was far more serious a matter than appears
on the surface, and the police failed to trace the thief.</p>

<p>Clinton &amp; Hills were lawyers. They had been established for
some time in dingy chambers in Fleet Street, but had taken more
commodious offices in Holborn, for big fees and silly clients had
enriched them. To these offices they were removing on the day that
the box disappeared. They had had the management for some years of
the estate of a Mr. Edward Burley. He had been a wealthy man and a
client of theirs for a very long time. He was regarded as an
eccentric man; secretive as to his affairs, though the solicitors
knew a good deal about them. He left the bulk of his property, the
net value of which was about ten thousand a year, to a nephew, who
was a minor at the time of his uncle's death, and the solicitors
were appointed his guardians. The stolen deed-box contained
documents of the utmost importance, and failing their recovery no
end of complications might arise. The two youths who had been
entrusted with the important duty of carrying the box to the new
offices told a plain, unvarnished talc, for they were cute enough
to see that any other might place them in an exceedingly awkward
predicament, so for once in their lives they were truthful.</p>

<p>From the first Tatlock was firmly of opinion that the stranger
who had accosted them and treated them to drinks was in collusion
with somebody else; that the whole business was a plant, and he set
to work to discover if possible who was likely to be so far
interested in the estate of the late Mr. Burley as to think it
worth while to steal the deeds. A mere stranger would surely never
have walked off with a box of deeds relating to property of which
he knew nothing. The theory, therefore, was that whoever stole the
deeds knew a good deal of Mr. Edward Burley's affairs. Tatlock
worked from this hypothesis. It was obvious to him that the theft
was the result of a deep-laid scheme, and was carried out by some
person who was well posted up in the doings of Clinton &amp; Hills.
Necessarily the detective took every means to find out if the two
clerks were in any way in collusion, and he satisfied himself that
the story they told was a perfectly correct one.</p>

<p>Clinton &amp; Hills were not able to furnish Tatlock with any
serviceable information with reference to Mr. Burley's domestic and
purely private affairs. Clinton was a man well advanced in years,
and had known Burley for a very long time. Hills was a young man of
about thirty, and had been Clinton's partner for six years. They
agreed in the opinion that Burley had been somewhat of a mystery,
and, as far as they were concerned, he never talked of his past.
Tatlock was convinced that in the man's past would be found a clue
to the robbery, so he worked accordingly.</p>

<p>Burley was practically a self-made man, and a money-grabber. He
was unfortunate in being violent-tempered, and of a selfish and
unfeeling disposition. Tatlock gathered up these facts with
comparative ease, for the prominent characteristics of a man are
generally known to a pretty wide circle of people; but his further
information which enabled him to solve the problem was only
acquired by the exercise of great tact, discretion, and ingenuity,
and at the cost of much patient toil.</p>

<p>He discovered that Burley had married when he was a little over
twenty and very poor. He was married at Christchurch, Whitechapel,
and the register set forth, amongst others, the following
particulars:</p>

<p>Marriage between Edward Burley, bachelor, importer and agent;
father's occupation, carpenter; and Emma Amelia Scranns, spinster,
shop assistant; father's occupation, market gardener.'</p>

<p>For some years after the marriage the young couple lived in the
neighbourhood of Whitechapel, and Burley's financial progress could
be traced. At first they occupied a small house at a rental value
of twenty-four pounds. Soon after they removed into one worth
forty. Later still into one worth seventy, and ten years after
marriage they were tenants of a comparatively palatial abode in a
square situated between Bow Road and Commercial Road East.</p>

<p>No children came to bless the union of Mr. and Mrs. Burley, and
there was a crystallised belief that their conjugal life was far
from happy. Indeed, it was a tradition of the neighbourhood that
Mr. Burley used to 'bash his missus,' and at last she 'took up'
with a young Jew, and her liege lord and master kicked her out.</p>

<p>After this little incident in his domestic affairs Mr. Burley
shook the dust of Whitechapel from his shoes, and, washing his
hands of all and sundry, trekked west. About this time there was a
hiatus of some two years that could not be easily filled up, but
there was reason for the belief that Mr. Burley travelled
abroad.</p>

<p>When next the trail was picked up he was living in a big house
in Russell Square and had a small riverside residence on the banks
of the Thames, near Henley. He had set up his carriage, had
numerous horses and traps, kept a butler and several other
servants, was believed to be a widower, was looked upon as
eminently respectable, but 'close-fisted.' He had a housekeeper, a
Mrs. Doyle, who had a son, a youth at this time between twelve and
fourteen, in whom Mr. Burley took great interest. This son, Thomas
Doyle, was a pupil at the City of London Schools, and was said to
have brains. Before he was twenty he went up to Oxford, but the
chief thing in which he seemed to have distinguished himself was
extravagance. He plunged into debt. Mr. Burley paid his debts and
forgave him. Encouraged by that, he took a still deeper plunge, but
this time Burley declined to pay any more. There was a scandal, and
young Doyle was rusticated. He disappeared after that, and there
was reason to believe that he went abroad; but his mother continued
to live for years under Mr. Burley's roof, until the measure of her
years being full she passed away. Mr. Burley only survived her by
two years. For years before he died he had a manservant, who acted
as his valet. He was a Scotsman, by name James Gillespie. This man
was with him up to his death. Tatlock discovered Gillespie in this
way: In the house adjoining Burley's house in Russell Square was a
servant whose sister had been a housemaid in Burley's service. This
sister married Gillespie, and they took a small hotel in the
neighbourhood of Henley. From Gillespie the following information
was gleaned by Tatlock:</p>

<p>For two or three years before Mr. Burley's death a man was in
the habit of visiting him occasionally. It was made evident that he
was not a welcome guest. There were many signs to indicate this. He
was known to the house-hold as Mr. Moore, and it was generally
believed that there was some relationship between Mr. Moore and Mr.
Burley. A very short time before Burley's death, and being then in
delicate health, he was visited by Moore, who sat with him in his
bedroom. Gillespie remembered that particular visit very well
indeed, and he knew that between his master and the visitor there
was a violent altercation. At last the bell of the room was rung
violently, and, on Gillespie hurrying up, he found his master
unconscious in his chair, while Moore was pale and agitated. He
said he believed Mr. Burley was in a fit, and urged that the doctor
should be summoned immediately. This was done, and as the doctor
lived in the neighbourhood he was soon at Mr. Burley's house. He
diagnosed the 'fit' as apoplexy, and pronounced it a serious case,
and he got in a colleague, who confirmed this. The usual course in
such cases was adopted, and at length the patient showed signs of
being relieved.</p>

<p>The medical men did not consider it advisable to leave the sick
man, they dined in the house together with Mr. Moore, who seemed
much concerned about Burley, and was particularly anxious to know
if he was likely to re-cover his faculties or not. To this the
medical men gave a cautious reply. The attack was a bad one, they
said, but still they were hopeful that their patient would rally.
It was useless, however, to attempt to disguise the fact that he
was in a dangerous condition. Moore was asked if he knew any of
Burley's relations. He replied that he did not think there were any
Mr. Burley would care to have about him. Nevertheless, the doctors
urged that it was a duty on Moore's part to inform these relatives
that Burley's life was hanging by a thread. He promised to do this
on the following day, and expressed his intention of staying in the
house all night. Of course no one had the power or authority to
object to this.</p>

<p>The doctors took it in turns to watch by the bedside of the
stricken man. One stayed the first half of the night, and was
relieved by his colleague at four o'clock. Moore slept in a room
leading out of Burley's room, though connected with the landing by
an independent door. Although the word 'slept' is used, it would
appear as if he slept but little or not at all, for he was
constantly in and out of the patient's room, and seemed restless
and ill at ease. About nine o'clock the medical watcher was alarmed
by noticing a change for the worse in Burley's condition, and he
sent a post-haste message to his colleague. Before the latter could
arrive, however, the struggle was over. Burley was dead. Moore said
that as one who all his life long had known Burley, he would avail
himself of his position to seal up some of the effects. This he did
in the presence of the doctors, affixing tape and seal to a
cupboard in the bedroom, to the deceased man's desk, and to sundry
drawers and boxes. He then left the house, saying he would call
upon Mr. Burley's solicitors, whom he knew. He did that about
midday, but previous to doing so he called at Burley's bank, as
Tatlock discovered, and cashed an open cheque for 4,000. It was
dated two days previously, and was made payable to George
Moore.</p>

<p>As it was very unusual for Burley to give an open cheque for so
large an amount, the cashier took it to the manager, who, while
surprised, believed it to be all right. Nevertheless, Mr. Moore was
asked if he had business connections with Mr. Burley. He seemed
indignant at being questioned, and handed the cashier his card, on
which was printed 'George Moore, 37 Ebury Street, Pimlico.' In the
end the cheque was cashed, the amount being paid chiefly in Bank of
England notes. An hour later those notes were converted into gold
at the Bank of England by, there is little doubt, Moore
himself.</p>

<p>In all these various incidents Tyler Tatlock saw good reason for
thinking that the mysterious George Moore might be able to throw
some light on the disappearance of the deed-box, more especially as
there was reason to think the signature on the 4,000 cheque was a
forgery. This could not be proved, of course, as Mr. Burley was
dead, but critical examination and comparison with scores of other
cheques signed by Burley revealed differences sufficiently marked
to arouse suspicions. Experts, in fact, declared that the cheque
was a forgery, but in the absence of Burley himself no charge of
forgery could have been legally sustained.</p>

<p>As Tatlock worked the problem out he came to the conclusion that
George Moore and Thomas Doyle were one and the same, and that Doyle
was Burley's son. The description given by the doctors and
Gillespie of Moore, and the description of the stranger who met
Clinton &amp; Hills' clerks as they were carrying the deed-box,
were identical.</p>

<p>Now, it was obvious that while he lured the young men into the
public-house he must have had a confederate at hand to carry off
the box, and scarcely less obvious that there was a traitor in
Clinton &amp; Hills' office who gave Doyle the tip about the box.
Tatlock kept this thought to himself, but he watched and probed.
Besides the two youths who carried the box, there were four other
clerks in the offices. But against no one of these could he get a
tittle of anything that would warrant him in suspecting him. Then
Tatlock said to himself:</p>

<p>'Thomas Doyle was Burley's son, and between them was ill blood.
A quarrel between them brought on the attack of apoplexy from which
Burley died. Instead of the son inheriting a share at least of his
father's property, it was all left to a nephew. Doyle, enraged and
desperate, thought that if he could get hold of the documents in
possession of Clinton &amp; Hills' they might be of value to him.
Some-body in Clinton &amp; Hills' office gave him information. 'Who
was it? Not the clerks, because I've tested them. One of the
partners, then? This is startling, but quite feasible. Which of the
partners? Not Clinton. He is an old man, and very well off. Hills,
then? Yes, probably. He is young, fast, extravagant. At any rate,
he must be watched.'</p>

<p>Falling in practically with this line of argument, Tatlock did
watch. Hills was not well off. He had a fourth share only in
Clinton &amp; Hills. That fourth share had been bought for him by a
brother. Hills was single, but engaged to be married. One day he
left England for a short holiday. He went to Paris. Tatlock went
with him, but all unknown to him. The night of his arrival in Paris
Hills dined at the Cafes de la Paix with Thomas Doyle alias George
Moore. The detective hastened back to London, and reported to Mr.
Clinton, who was shocked, but decided to take no steps till his
partner came back. When he did he was questioned. He realised that
his guilty secret was discovered, and did the best thing he could
perhaps for himself under the circumstances&mdash;he went home and
put an end to his existence.</p>

<p>Doyle was arrested in Paris, and in his possession was found all
the deeds and papers. He declared himself the son of the late Mr.
Burley, said that he and Hills had discussed the matter, and
resolved that the deed-box should be stolen, and later on, when all
chance of recovering it had passed, arrangements should be made to
return it to the guardians subject to the payment of a large sum of
money, which the partners in guilt were to share.</p>

<p>It was a pretty and ingenious plot, frustrated by the cleverness
of Tatlock; but Doyle slipped through the meshes. He employed an
exceedingly able French advocate to oppose the extradition, and
owing to some technical flaw in the indictment he succeeded in
getting his client released while fresh papers were being prepared
in London. In the meantime Doyle disappeared, and was heard of no
more.</p>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>THE MYSTERIOUS PASSENGER</h2>

<p class="first">
THE great American liner, the City of Baltimore, which had been
lying in the Mersey all ready for sea, had blown her final warning
whistle; all visitors had been cleared from her decks, her anchors
were tripped, and her mighty engines were beginning to pulse and
throb through every fibre, timber, and plate of the floating city,
when the scream of a tug's whistle was heard, and a tiny tug was
seen to put forth from the landing-stage, and to tear through the
yellow waters of the muddy river at her best speed towards the
slowly-moving ship. She was flying a signal at her mast-head, and
this signal caused the captain of the liner to telegraph 'Dead
slow' to his engine-room. In a few minutes the tug snorted and
puffed up alongside the City of Baltimore, looking in comparison
like a barnacle against the side of a whale. From the liner a rope
was thrown and dexterously caught on board the tug, which steamed
up right amidships of the big vessel, from which a rope ladder was
lowered, and the gruff voice of the captain sang out: 'Now, then
there, bear a hand. Make haste, please.'</p>

<p>A little, dapper, agile man sprang from the rail of the tug on
to the rope ladder, mounting swiftly, and, like a practised hand,
he stepped lightly on to the big ship's deck, and was received by
the purser and one of the officers, while a crowd of passengers,
whose curiosity had been aroused, pressed eagerly round to get a
glimpse of the last passenger, who had only saved his passage
apparently by the 'skin of his teeth.' A leather portmanteau was
pulled up after him from the tug, which was instantly cast adrift,
and headed back for the landing-stage. The engines of the liner now
revolved more rapidly, and the great vessel stately and grace-fully
proceeded towards the sea.</p>

<p>The passenger who had arrived by the tug was a little man, with
small piercing eyes, which were almost hidden at times when his
brow was contracted. He was neatly dressed, and wore a
broad-brimmed soft felt hat. He requested the purser to conduct him
at once to the captain, as he bore a letter from the owners, and
must deliver it at once. This statement was, of course, a passport
to the captain's presence, and a quarter of an hour later the
purser was summoned, and to him the captain spoke thus:</p>

<p>'Mr. Arnold, you must find a berth for this gentleman, Mr.
Walter Bilby. A berth for himself, you understand?'</p>

<p>'But, sir,' protested the purser, 'I have not a vacant berth in
the ship.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Arnold, I said you must find one.'</p>

<p>The purser knew the skipper too well to risk his position by
attempting to argue against a matter which the skipper had said
'must' be done. So the worried purser went away scratching his
head, and he held a consultation with the chief steward, and, as
two heads are always better than one, the problem was ultimately
solved by the steward himself giving up his cabin to the stranger,
while he himself under-took to sleep on the floor in the purser's
room.</p>

<p>The City of Baltimore was unusually crowded, for it was the
autumn season, and Americans who had been 'doing Europe' were
flocking back to their country in crowds. There were over a hundred
passengers in the saloon alone, and upwards of five hundred second
and third class. When the Baltimore had cleared the Tuskar, and
began to face the swell of the sea, the majority of the passengers
disappeared, and the stewards were in great request. But dapper
little Mr. Bilby was evidently a seasoned traveller, as he was in
no ways affected, and, smoking a big and strong cigar, he paced up
and down the quarter-deck, in spite of the roll and pitch, with
perfect ease.</p>

<p>Naturally there was much curiosity on the part of his
fellow-voyagers to know who this late passenger was; evidently a
person of some importance, or the big liner would not have waited
for him. But Mr. Walter Bilby was not a communicative person, and
he showed no disposition to satisfy the curiosity. Nevertheless, he
was voted a pleasant fellow, for he could sing a good song and tell
a good story. He did not exclude himself from the smoking-room, nor
did he object to take a hand at cards, though all efforts to draw
him out failed. But though this was the case as far as he was
concerned, he was himself enabled to learn something of a good many
of his companions, for he had a wonderful, insinuating, and artful
way that was perfectly irresistible. An apparently chance remark,
or carelessly asked question, drew a considerable amount of
information from others. The impression he created is best
illustrated by the following remarks of one man to another as the
two stood talking on the deck that evening:</p>

<p>'I say, isn't that fellow Bilby a curious cuss? His eyes are
precious small, and almost invisible sometimes, but upon my soul
they make one feel as if they were peering into your brains. He
seems to me the sort of fellow that would worm your heart's secrets
out of you, but it's very little you would learn about him in
return.'</p>

<p>Man number two acquiesced in the general correctness of this
criticism, and the two agreed that Mr. Walter Bilby was somewhat of
a mystery.</p>

<p>Amongst the lady passengers in the saloon was one who puzzled
and mystified her sex no less than Mr. Bilby puzzled his. She was
of somewhat masculine type, as her features were rather large. But
she had a good complexion, so delicate and fresh that it was the
envy of the women. Her eyes were blue, her hair, of which she had a
great quantity, was tawny in hue. She had delicate and beautifully
shaped hands, and wore a number of diamond rings. She occupied a
berth by herself, and studiously held aloof from all her fellows.
Her age might have been guessed at anything from twenty-five to
forty. She spent her days in a deck chair, and seemed interested in
a book, and her manner was so disdainful, so cold, so repellent, so
stand-offish, that the women by tacit consent avoided her. Some of
the men, however, tried to ingratiate themselves, but succeeded no
better, with one exception. Mr. Bilby, to the astonishment of all,
so far overcame her reserve that occasionally he sat beside her,
and they chatted and laughed, and two or three times he carried her
wraps down to her cabin for her.</p>

<p>One morning, after she had made herself comfortable in her deck
chair on the leeside of the hurricane house, Mr. Bilby came on
deck, and spying her out approached her. She was known on board as
Miss Veronica Broadwood. The following conversation between her and
Bilby was overheard by some of the other passengers:</p>

<p>'I wish, Miss Broadwood, you would do a little favour for
me.'</p>

<p>'With pleasure if I can. What is it?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I am sure you can if you will try. It's a very small
matter. I have a smoking-cap for which I have a great liking. It
was given to me and elaborately embroidered by a young lady to whom
I was much attached. By some carelessness I have managed to unravel
a great deal of this embroidery, and I am much distressed. Will you
kindly put it on again? I shall be so greatly obliged if you
will.'</p>

<p>Miss Broadwood laughed, though there was a troubled expression
on her face.</p>

<p>'My dear sir,' she exclaimed, 'it's absolutely beyond
me&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Surely not.'</p>

<p>'Yes, it is indeed.'</p>

<p>'But it is only a question of sewing it on the velvet in
accordance with the rest of the pattern.'</p>

<p>'That may be, but I cannot sew.'</p>

<p>'Cannot sew?'</p>

<p>'No. I hate it.'</p>

<p>'Do you never use the needle?'</p>

<p>'Never.'</p>

<p>'How strange! I thought every woman was more or less clever with
the needle.'</p>

<p>'A popular error, Mr. Bilby. At any rate, if that is a general
rule, then I am the one exception.'</p>

<p>'Well, well, you do astonish me. Why, I should have thought
those shapely and delicate hands of yours would have been capable
of executing the most exquisite needle-work.'</p>

<p>'If my hands have given you that impression, I am afraid they
are deceptive.'</p>

<p>'Obviously&mdash;obviously. Well, I am sorry. I must see if I
cannot get some other lady to oblige me.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you will have no difficulty in doing that.'</p>

<p>'How do you know?'</p>

<p>'Because you are so fascinating. What woman could resist
you?'</p>

<p>'You've resisted me any way.'</p>

<p>'Don't say that.'</p>

<p>'But you won't oblige me.'</p>

<p>'Haven't I told you that I can't use the needle at all?'
answered Miss Broadwood, with a certain sharpness which indicated
that the subject must be dismissed. Bilby took the hint, and
something else was talked about.</p>

<p>The City of Baltimore was a very comfortable but not a fast
boat, and she usually took nearly ten days to complete the passage
to New York. During the last day or two Mr. Bilby, it was noticed,
became more than ever attentive to Miss Broadwood, which called
forth from one lady the remark&mdash;made to another young
lady&mdash;'I declare, that fellow Bilby is flirting with that
she-cat, Miss Broad-wood. Well, what he can see to admire in her,
goodness knows&mdash;the stuck-up hussy. I'll bet she's some
adventuress on the look-out for a fellow with money.'</p>

<p>This was a little spiteful, but feminine, though it was but an
echo of the sentiment of the rest of the ladies in the floating
community.</p>

<p>As the vessel proceeded up East River to her berth Mr. Bilby
became even more closely attentive to Miss Broad-wood. He wished to
know if he could be of use to her. Might he inquire where she was
going to stay?</p>

<p>She thanked him very much, but she would not trouble him in any
way. She did not quite know where she was going to. She expected
friends to meet her, and they would make all arrangements. Possibly
she would only stay in New York a few hours.</p>

<p>When the vessel was berthed and the custom-house officers were
examining the passengers' baggage, Mr. Bilby strolled to the
section where the ladies' baggage was being subjected to scrutiny.
Miss Broadwood, unlike most of her sex, had only a comparatively
small box. Nevertheless the officers were turning everything out of
it, while the lady herself stood by, looking pale and anxious. For
a woman of position, as she seemed to be, she had an astonishingly
meagre and scant wardrobe, which caused one of the men to exclaim
ironically:</p>

<p>'Well, madam, I guess European shopkeepers ain't much better off
for your visit, and the revenue of this country won't benefit by
your trip.'</p>

<p>Miss Broadwood did not reply, though she looked very indignant.
She peremptorily ordered the man to put all her things back. That
done, she locked her trunk, and instructed one of the licensed
porters to convey it for her to an address she gave in Twenty-Fifth
Street. She then joined two gentlemanly-looking men who had
evidently been waiting for her, and the three drove in a carriage
to Delmonico's, where they dined sumptuously, the party being
swelled by two other men and two ladies, who also arrived in a
carriage.</p>

<p>The next morning pretty early Miss Broadwood called in a state
of excitement at the chief Police Bureau to coin-plain that on the
previous evening she had handed her trunk to a licensed porter, No.
107, for conveyance to an address in Twenty-Fifth Street, but he
had failed to deliver the box, and she was terribly distressed
about it. The officer on duty asked her if she was sure she had
given her property into the charge of a licensed man. She said
there was no mistake about it. She looked at his badge, and he
showed her his licence. The officer was puzzled. All the licensed
men were vigilantly superintended, and robbery by one of them was
almost an unknown thing. However, he promised that very active
steps should be made at once to get on the track of the man and
recover the lost trunk.</p>

<p>Miss Broadwood was in a great state of mental commotion, and
declared that she would pay a reward of a hundred dollars if the
box was at once restored to her with its contents intact. The
officer said he would do his best, and communicate with her
immediately he heard anything. On this understanding Miss Broadwood
took her departure, looking disconsolate and downcast. She had not
been gone very long before another curious thing happened. The
officer received a fresh visitor, and this time it was Mr. Bilby.
This gentleman remained at the Bureau for over an hour, and had a
long interview with the chief. Then he went away.</p>

<p>In the course of that day Miss Broadwood sent repeated, urgent
messages to the station to inquire if her lost property had been
heard of. To the last message an answer was returned to the effect
that the police hoped to give her some information about the trunk
in a few hours.</p>

<p>The principal houses in Twenty-Fifth Street were very imposing,
and proportionately as high-rented as they were high
architecturally. They were let out in flats, and occupied by people
of means and position. The address Miss Broadwood had given was at
one of the most imposing buildings in the thoroughfare, on the
third floor of a ten-storeyed structure. Night had closed in when a
dozen men assembled at the main entrance. They had come in twos and
threes from different directions. There was a hurried consultation
amongst them, carried on in low tones. Then almost noiselessly they
filed up the stairs to floor three, and gathered about the door on
which was an obtrusive brass plate setting forth that the flat was
the residence of 'Mr. Aaron Gristwold.' One of the men, who seemed
to be the leader, rang the bell. In a few minutes the door was
opened by a black manservant.</p>

<p>'Is Mr. Gristwold in?' was the query.</p>

<p>'I guess he is, but he's mighty busy. What do you want?'</p>

<p>'To see him,' was the curt answer, and the leader, brushing
aside the nigger, swept in and was followed by the others. Several
of them had revolvers in their hands. One man kept the nigger
quiet, and the others marched down the passage, pushed open a door,
disclosing a brilliantly-lighted room, filled with men and three or
four women, including Miss Broadwood.</p>

<p>'Hands up!' cried the leader.</p>

<p>The party thus suddenly disturbed were thrown into a state of
consternation. The table was littered with papers, and some of the
party made a grab at them, but the intruders presented their
revolvers, and in a stern, commanding voice the leader exclaimed:
'Hands up, or by God we'll shoot!' Miss Broadwood suddenly drew a
small revolver from her pocket and placed it to her mouth; but
before she could fire, one of the intruders rushed at her and
seized her, wresting the weapon away.</p>

<p>The leader was the celebrated New York detective Josh Bryant,
and the others were policemen, who, thanks to 'Mr. Bilby,'
otherwise Tyler Tatlock, had thus swept into their net a nest of
notorious scoundrels, including one of the cleverest forgers in the
world, Jack Humphrey by name, but who had passed under as many
aliases as there are days in the year, the latest being 'Miss
Broadwood.'</p>

<p>To explain how this dramatic scene had been brought about it is
necessary to state that a large number of United States bonds had
been sold in London. These bonds, however, were forgeries. Tatlock
was employed to trace the delinquent, and he obtained information
to the effect that a man named 'Walter Nolan,' who had been staying
at one of the large West End hotels, had sold the bonds. There was
every reason to believe that Nolan was the much-wanted Jack
Humphrey, who had been on the stage and was accounted an excellent
actor. He was a little, effeminate man, with singularly
delicate-looking white hands, and had made his mark as the
impersonator of female characters, his voice being very like a
woman's. When Tatlock went to the hotel he found the bird had
flown. He was traced to the Euston Station, and there was every
reason to believe he had gone to Liverpool, and, as he was known to
be unsurpassed in the art of disguising himself, it was feared that
he might get clear away.</p>

<p>But those who thought so reckoned without their Tatlock.
Humphrey was known to have his principal quarters in New York, and
to be the head of a gang there of as clever swindlers as ever
preyed upon society. Tatlock surmised that the fellow would take
the first boat sailing for America. That boat was the City of
Baltimore. Tatlock rushed to the office of the owners, and secured
the list of passengers. It was a long list, and did not help him.
Yet instinctively he felt sure that his man would be on board, for,
knowing that the scent was hot, he would hasten to get out of the
country where the hounds were baying at his heels, so he made known
his business to the owners. There wasn't a moment to lose, as the
vessel was weighing anchor. But Tatlock rushed down in a cab to the
landing-stage in the company of an official of the firm, who took
'Mr. Bilby' off in one of the tugs, flying a private signal to the
captain that he must take this last passenger on board and find him
a berth in the saloon. That order was law to the captain, and he
obeyed it.</p>

<p>Tatlock had not been long on board before he began to suspect
that there was something strange about Miss Broad-wood. He shadowed
her, and at last hit upon the clever device of asking her to do
some sewing for him. Her confession that she could not use the
needle convinced him that 'Miss Broadwood' was not a woman. In the
meantime he took the captain into his confidence, and when the ship
reached the East River a message was sent to the custom-house
officials to thoroughly search Miss Broadwood's trunk. Although it
contained a good many articles of feminine attire there were some
men's clothes, and several coils of different coloured hair. But
acting on advice the officers asked no questions about this
extraordinary circumstance.</p>

<p>When the licensed porter had started on his journey with the
trunk to the address given he was overtaken by a detective from the
custom-house and ordered to proceed to a police depot. There the
trunk was subjected to a critical examination. It was found to be
beautifully and ingeniously constructed, with double sides and lids
which were well calculated to escape any but the closest scrutiny.
These sides were lined with a quantity of forged bonds, banknotes,
and mortgage deeds, which no doubt would have been palmed off on
unsuspecting victims had it not been for Tatlock. As it was, the
New York police, thanks to Tatlock, captured most of the notorious
gang, and though Tatlock had not the satisfaction of conveying
'Miss Broadwood' back to England, as the rascal had to be tried
first of all in the United States for crimes committed there, he
was warmly congratulated on breaking up the exceedingly clever band
of wretches whose depredations had been carried on for years,
during which they had obtained immense sums of money.</p>

<p>The ruling spirit of the band was unquestionably Jack Humphreys
of the many aliases, and on both sides of the Atlantic there was a
sigh of relief that this marvellously clever and artistic swindler
had been laid by the heels at last. In recognition of the valuable
service rendered in this remarkable case Tyler Tatlock was publicly
presented with a purse of gold, some plate, and a
magnificently-illuminated address, subscribed for by merchants and
bankers both in London and New York.</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>THE STOLEN PICTURE</h2>

<p class="first">
MADAME IRENE was a Spanish lady naturalised in England, where
she had spent the greater part of her life. She was a widow of an
uncertain age, but with a very certain income, which enabled her to
live in excellent style and indulge an extravagant hobby for
collecting works of art and miscellaneous knicknacks which are
generally classified as bric-a-brac. Her beautifully-situated house
on Richmond Hill was a storehouse of valuable art treasures, and
there she entertained in a princely way, and proudly displayed her
collections to anyone who took an interest in such things.</p>

<p>To Tatlock she went one day full of moaning and wailing. It was
a distressful story she had to tell, and her artistic soul was
stirred to its depths. She had just returned from a
treasure-hunting expedition in Italy. She had been to quaint
Bologna, the mouldering old city of a dead glory. While there she
heard of one, Jacob Weinberg by name, a Jew curio-dealer, who was
said to possess a wonderful Rubens. She was told of a Madonna which
was reputed to be matchless. Of course she sought out Weinberg and
saw the Madonna. 'A lovely head! Oh, so beautiful, so wonderful, so
poetically sad, so full of divine sorrow!' Thus she rapturously
described this 'unique work of art.' She bargained with Weinberg.
He had elevated bargaining to a science. He demanded a sum that
nearly drove her into hysterics. He expatiated with glowing warmth
on the merits of the head. He declared it should never&mdash;no,
never&mdash;leave his possession unless the price he asked was
paid. She offered him one-third, and he wept with a wordless
sorrow. When he recovered he called her attention with enthusiastic
ardour to the beauty of the colouring, to the pathetic tenderness
of the eyes, to the wistful, pleading, yearning expression of the
saintly face. She increased her price by a hundred or two. He wept
again, and vowed he would rather die than part with it unless the
small value he had put upon it was paid. To sell it for less would
be a sin and outrage against art. Madame wanted the treasure, but
she was not without commercial instinct, and she refused to budge
an inch. The Jew wailed and wept. He grew heated, he protested, he
appealed. 'Art was art,' he said, and not butcher's meat.' Day
after day for a whole week did the Jew and the lady struggle for
mastery, and in the end the lady won, but it was at the cost of the
Jew's heart, for that gentleman declared by all his fathers and
prophets that that important organ of his anatomy was burst
asunder. Nevertheless he was enabled to give her a receipt for her
very substantial cheque, and to receive her instructions for its
despatch to London. And he insisted upon her seeing with her own
eyes the packing of the precious treasure. She failed not to do
this. Had it been a newborn babe, or a bottle of a rare vintage
port, it could not have been handled with greater tenderness.
Madame saw it securely packed up in its case, the lid of which was
screwed, and the address label fixed. Then, full of emotional joy,
the lady took her departure and journeyed to Rome.</p>

<p>Two months later she arrived at her Richmond residence. Her
anxious inquiries elicited the fact that a wooden case had arrived
from abroad. Her heart palpitated with joy. She depicted the
delight and envy of the world of art when she invited its chief
representatives to view her wonderful find. It was a proud moment
for her when her careful carpenter commenced to loosen the screws
of the box. With what a loving regard for the precious contents of
the box were the screws withdrawn! How cautiously was the lid
removed and the top wrapping taken out! Then a cry of horror burst
from the lips of Madame Irene, for, instead of her Madonna coming
to view, all that could be discovered was a quantity of fine
shavings and bits of paper. The Madonna was not there; she had been
spirited away.</p>

<p>The shock to Madame's nerves was great. The loss from the mere
monetary point of view was a very serious one, while from the art
standpoint it was irreparable unless the picture could be
regained.</p>

<p>The next post that went out carried with it a letter from the
lady to the Jew. And a few posts later came a letter from the Jew
to the lady. He had despatched the picture within a few hours of
her seeing it packed. He was 'tremendously' distressed. The
treasure had been stolen en route; probably by the rascally
Italians, or still more rascally French, while the package was in
transit. He was sure it could not have been abstracted on the
English lines, for the English railway people and carriers were so
honest. He instituted inquiries, and so did Madame, but to all and
sundry it seemed a profound mystery. The Italian authorities
indignantly repudiated the insinuation that the theft was committed
while they had charge of the box. But the French! Yes. Was it not
well known that the French railway employees were as villainous as
they could be?</p>

<p>The French, on their part, were very blunt in their condemnation
of the Italian system of conveying goods. No proper check, they
alleged, was kept, and the Italians were so wanting in principles
and morality that anything was possible amongst them. The English
railway company were emphatic in declaring that it was next to
impossible that the picture could have been stolen on their
system.</p>

<p>Weeks were thus consumed in useless correspondence and inquiry,
until in despair Madame invoked the aid of the great English
detective. She had paid a very large sum for the painting, and she
wanted her money back or the picture. The recovery of the picture
was probable; the recovery of the money next to impossible. The Jew
had delivered the property to the Bologna Railway people for
transmission to England. He had paid all charges on it for transit,
as he had agreed to do, and there his responsibility ended. His
distress almost drove him mad, and his very elastic heart was once
more broken as he thought of the unmitigated wickedness of anyone
who would steal a Madonna.</p>

<p>Tatlock listened patiently to the story, which was told somewhat
disjointedly, but with impassioned gesture. Now and again he
dropped in a question, which was the means of eliciting a good deal
of straightforward information, calculated to help him in working
out a theory, and Madame felt a trifle happier when he took leave
of her, with the assurance that he would use every endeavour to
recover her picture.</p>

<p>As was his wont he thought the whole matter out very carefully,
and examined all the possibilities. He knew that on the Continental
lines robberies were of frequent occurrence. However charitably
disposed one might be, it was impossible to acquit the companies of
a laxity of supervision, which made crime comparatively easy.
Complaints were numerous of the ransacking of passengers' luggage
and the pilfering of small things, but the theft of the picture
seemed to Tatlock to point to an organised plan and a pre-knowledge
of the valuable contents of the wooden case. He had been careful to
ascertain that when the case was opened at Richmond there was no
appearance of its having been previously disturbed. It had passed
through the English Custom House without examination, the
'declaration of contents' being accepted as accurate. It was very
obvious, therefore, that if the picture had been stolen while in
transit the thieves must have been well prepared, and have had
facilities afforded them for carrying out the robbery; nor was it
less clear that they were no ordinary pilferers, for the vulgar
luggage-rifler would hardly be likely to carry off a unique work of
art, which could only be disposed of at very great risk and under
exceptionally favourable circumstances.</p>

<p>Tatlock had a free hand with regard to his investigations.
Madame, with the enthusiasm of the art worshipper, had told him he
was to spare no expense if he thought there was the faintest chance
of recovering the Madonna. From the first he was of the opinion
that the chances were very good, for whereas a watch, or ring, or
the like, could have easily been disposed of, there was no open
market for a painting by so celebrated an artist as Rubens. A
genuine Rubens was far too rare for the typical pilferer to be able
to offer it for sale without attracting attention to himself. A
collector or dealer would to a certainty inquire about its history,
and wish to know how it came into the possession of the vendor.
These facts were so indisputable that it was impossible to avoid
the conclusion that the guilty parties were no ordinary railway
thieves.</p>

<p>As already stated, there had been quite a mass of correspondence
on the subject. Each company over whose system the package
travelled was excessively desirous of repudiating any suggestion
that laxity of supervision on their part had rendered the thief's
way easy. Each company tried to pose as the embodiment of all the
virtues, and declared with an emphasis the outcome of firm
conviction that 'it is impossible that the picture could have been
stolen while it was passing over our line,' and, further, each
Continental company, with the smug consciousness of exalted virtue,
hinted in what might almost be described as veiled allegory that if
the picture had really been stolen in transit the search-light of
exhaustive inquiry should be directed on the English system. They
did not make any definite accusation, but told pretty fairy stories
of things that were said to have happened on English railways.
Tatlock, who carefully examined this correspondence, knew what
value to attach to the protestations of sweet innocence. Nor was it
from any insular prejudice or obliquity of vision to the sins of
his compatriots that he made up his mind that it was impossible the
Madonna could have been stolen in England. The box was put on hoard
of the steamer at Boulogne. The passage across the Channel occupied
a little over an hour, and there was absolutely no opportunity for
the box to be opened, the picture taken out, and the packing
replaced in its original state unless captain and crew were in
league. Such an idea as that was too absurd for consideration.
Landed at Folkestone, and being marked to be expedited by grande
vitesse&mdash;that is to say, by express, which meant passenger
train instead of ordinary goods&mdash;it was placed with the
passengers' luggage in the London boat train at Folkestone. In
London it came under the notice of the custom-house authorities,
but they did not open the box, and in less than twenty-four hours
it was delivered at its destination.</p>

<p>Tatlock's inquiries and investigations were of a very exhaustive
nature, and the result was that he came to the conclusion that the
Madonna had never left Bologna. That suggested one or two
probabilities, and narrowed the area of search considerably. One
day, in the character of an art treasure seeker, he called upon
Jacob Weinberg, a German Jew long resident in Italy. He was a
striking-looking man, seventy years of age if a day. His singularly
lined and drawn face bore in it evidence of a life spent in greed
for gain. His small and somewhat vicious-looking eyes were
strangely suggestive of a sleepless watchfulness for chances of
money-making. Jacob Weinberg was a little man, with a restless,
nervous temperament, and a wonderful command of the voluble
language of persuasion, which men of his calling and religion
possess to a greater or lesser degree. He displayed a passionate
eagerness to trade, and a feverish anxiety lest a possible customer
should depart without purchasing.</p>

<p>He lived in a mouldy old house that had once been a palace.
Bologna is full of palaces, and the cobbler who patches your shoes
beats his leather and plies his awl under a roof which probably, in
the times of long ago, may have sheltered some representative of
Italy's wealth and grandeur in the days of her greatness. Jacob
Weinberg took snuff in a somewhat disagreeable manner; his garments
were ancient and patched, and he evidently attached no weight to
the axiom that 'cleanliness is next to godliness.'</p>

<p>As 'Mr. John Sturgess, of London,' Tyler Tatlock inspected the
art treasures in Jacob Weinberg's storehouse, and he priced this
and that, and made numerous inquiries. The old Jew had somewhat of
a European reputation. He was in correspondence with many
notabilities, and often received commissions to ransack the
capitals of the Continent in search of some particular work of art
that was much coveted. That he was an authority in such matters was
undoubted, and in his way he was a character of much
originality.</p>

<p>When 'Mr. Sturgess' had finished his inspection he alluded to
the loss of the Madonna, and this allusion drew from the Jew an
exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>'Ah, you know Madame Irene?'</p>

<p>'A little.'</p>

<p>'She is to be pitied: she is to be pitied. It is sad that she
should lose that fine head I sold her. Who could have stolen it, I
wonder?'</p>

<p>'I wonder, too,' replied Tatlock reflectively.</p>

<p>'It could not have been done by any ordinary thief. It was all
so cleverly managed.'</p>

<p>'Have you any theory of the robbery?' asked Tatlock.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes.'</p>

<p>'What is it?'</p>

<p>'Madame Irene got that Madonna very cheap. She beat me down; she
is so clever, and I&mdash;I am weak, you know. She is so charming a
lady that she made a triumph over me. It gave her great joy, and
she must have talked about it. That is so very like a woman, you
know. Madame is a great lady, and I am a poor Jew&mdash;very, very
poor. But I love art, and I make many sacrifices. I like my patrons
to have good things; and sometimes I lose in my bargains.'</p>

<p>'But how does that square in with the theory of the
robbery?'</p>

<p>'Ah, I come to that. Madame she made a big story, no doubt. She
tells people she has bought a genuine Madonna, and that she
squeezed poor old Weinberg until she got her picture for the price
of dirt. She boasts about that picture, and the story spreads. Then
somebody who hears it makes a fine plan to steal it.'</p>

<p>'But surely more than one person must have been mixed up in the
affair?'</p>

<p>'Beyond doubt. It is a business. Several persons perhaps have an
interest. They provide money. They give a big bribe to some
official on the railway. In Italy the officials are such rascals.
They get so little wages that they can be easily bought. If you
comprehend that, then the rest is easy.'</p>

<p>'Then you believe that the head has never left Italy?'</p>

<p>'I believe the robbery was done in Italy; but now the Madonna
may be the other side of the world.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you have done your best to help Madame in her search
for the lost treasure?'</p>

<p>'Truly, truly have I. But it has been so cleverly done. It is so
difficult to trace the thieves.'</p>

<p>'Then you don't think the picture is likely to be
recovered?'</p>

<p>'Alas, I fear not.'</p>

<p>Tatlock dismissed the subject, and soon after, much to
Weinberg's disgust, he departed without making a purchase. The
following day he had to answer an anxious letter of inquiry from
Madame Irene, in which she urged him to candidly tell her whether
he had got any clue, and if he thought it likely he would recover
the painting. In reply he said:</p>

<p>'It is impossible for me to say at present what the chances are
of recovering the Madonna. The robbery seems to have been effected
in a very clever manner. Of course the railway officials here are
very indignant at the mere suggestion that the picture was stolen
on any part of their system. They declare it would be absolutely
impossible for such a thing to be done without there was a
widespread conspiracy, which would necessarily involve a good many
of the employees. From my own investigations I am pretty well
convinced the theft was not committed on the Italian railways, and,
though I do not wish to raise your hopes too much, I think it
possible I shall ultimately succeed in solving the mystery.'</p>

<p>In less than a week of the date of despatch of this letter to
Madame, Tyler Tatlock was in Milan, and one evening, accompanied by
two gendarmes and an Italian detective, armed with the necessary
legal authority for a domiciliary visit, he went to an old house in
the Rue Cavour. It was a sort of lumber place for the storage of
all kinds of bric--brac and the like, and, after much rummaging
about in what seemed most unlikely corners, the stolen Madonna was
brought to light. Carefully packed and enfolded in long strips of
canvas, it had been concealed on the beams of the roof in a loft
where the spiders and dust were seldom disturbed. Forth from that
house as a prisoner went a young Jew named Moses Weinberg, son of
Jacob Weinberg, of Bologna, and the telegraph was set in motion to
Bologna, carrying instructions that Jacob was to be arrested. And
when the morrow dawned Madame Irene, to her joy and delight, was
telegraphically informed by Tatlock that the lost Madonna had been
recovered.</p>

<p>It was another triumph for Tatlock. His investigations had led
him to suspect that old Weinberg could throw some light on the
robbery. Link by link he worked out a chain of circumstantial
evidence, and his deductions forced him to the conclusion that the
Madonna was abstracted from the case by Weinberg himself after
Madame had seen it packed and had herself gone away; and when
Tatlock learned that Weinberg's son managed a branch establishment
in Milan, and that the son had visited the father a few days after
Madame had made her purchase, then were his suspicions deepened,
and he resolved to lay such information in Milan as would insure
him the cooperation of the Milan police. It was a clever move, the
result of accurate theorising, and, as was determined at a later
stage, old Weinberg, annoyed at Madame's persistency in beating him
down in price, resolved that, though he took her money, she should
not have the picture, which he resolved, when the affair had blown
over, to sell to another customer. That little bit of greed was his
ruin, and he did not live to complete the sentence that was passed
upon him.</p>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>THE PRIVATE SECRETARY</h2>

<p class="first">
THE following story&mdash;alas! too true&mdash;records one of
those grim tragedies of real life the recital of which moves one to
the pathos of tears, unless one is strangely emotionless. It needs
no pen-dressing, no florid colouring to heighten its dramatic
interest; it is best told in the plain and homely language of
everyday life. Tatlock confesses that during his long experience
none of the many cases he had to deal with stirred him to his
depths as this one did.</p>

<p>A gentle lady, tenderly nurtured and brought up, married, when
she was only seventeen, Richard Ernest Merford, who held a
commission in the army. He was one of a large family. His father
was a country clergyman, who had practised a life of self-denial
and self-suppression in order to educate his children well and
bring them up respectably. It was said of Richard Merford that he
was one of the handsomest men the world had ever seen. Whether that
was true or not matters little, for it is not with him the
narrative is mainly concerned. Two children were born unto him, a
girl and a boy, the latter being named Gabriel, who grew up
handsome and reckless, like his father before him. Captain Richard
Merford died before he had turned forty. During his short life he
discounted the future in every possible way. A small fortune he had
inherited was dissipated; he alienated his friends; he blighted his
career, and a scandal, in which the name of a lady of title was
involved, compelled him to resign his commission. Then followed a
few brief years of mad recklessness on the turf, until, wrecked
with disease and broken-hearted, he sank into a dishonoured
grave.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merford, who was a sweet woman, had borne with exemplary
patience shame, contumely, and misery, struggling with heroic
devotion to screen her girl and boy from the father's blighting
influence. Fortunately for herself she had had a small income
settled upon her, and so bound with the bonds of legal strictness
that it was completely out of her husband's reach. When he died she
continued to be-stow unremitting care and attention on her
children; and particularly was she mindful of the boy, who was as
the apple of her eye; her soul's delight. Gabriel spent some years
at a public school, and then went up to Oxford; but he disappointed
his tutors, and left without taking honours, and with a somewhat
unsavoury odour clinging to his name. Not that he had committed, so
far as was known, any grievous fault; but he was credited with many
youthful follies which greatly pained all who were interested in
his welfare.</p>

<p>On leaving college considerable influence was brought to bear by
his mother's relatives, and after a few months' travelling abroad
he secured an appointment as private secretary to a member of
Parliament, who was immensely wealthy. For three or four years he
seems to have fulfilled his duties to the entire satisfaction of
his employer and with credit to himself. His employer, whom we will
refer to for the purpose of the story as 'Mr. Grantly,' took great
interest in him, and indicated his desire to promote his interests
in every way. But heredity was strong in the young man, and some of
the vices which had ruined and destroyed his father began to
manifest themselves, and led him into debt. In a moment of
desperation he confessed his errors to Mr. Grantly, who generously,
on receiving his solemn promise to reform, paid off his
liabilities, and rein-stated him in his estimation.</p>

<p>Mr. Grantly had three daughters, the youngest, Virginia, being
about nineteen. She was a girl of surpassing beauty and high
accomplishments. As might have been expected, between this
beautiful girl and her father's hand-some secretary a strong
attachment sprang up. Mr. Grantly, having full confidence in young
Merford, treated him almost as one of his family, and, as it
chanced, the secretary and Virginia were thrown much together. She
was a very clever linguist, and as her father had a large foreign
correspondence she attended to his foreign letters, the consequence
being that she and Merford saw a great deal of each other.</p>

<p>It was to be revealed at a later stage that he frequently urged
her with passionate pleading to go through a secret marriage with
him. But against this deception she set her face with stubborn
determination; and no less passionately she prayed him to go boldly
to her father in an honourable, straightforward way, and ask his
permission to marry her. Merford declined for some time to do this,
much to the young lady's amazement, for she was very sanguine that
her father, who loved her devotedly, would not stand in the way of
her happiness. Nevertheless Merford maintained a stubborn
obstinacy, and used every argument he could think of to bring her
to his way of thinking. Virginia, however, was too dutiful and
loyal, and had too high a regard for honour and truth, to deceive
her father; and when Merford realised this, and he had exhausted
his arguments, he sought a private interview with Mr. Grantly, and
nervously and excitedly declared his passion for Virginia, and
craved per-mission to marry her.</p>

<p>Mr. Grantly, who had never suspected anything, was quite taken
aback, and had hard work to conceal his anger and annoyance. As was
only natural in the case of a man of his standing and ability, he
said that he would commit himself to no hasty decision one way or
the other. In the meantime he would talk to Virginia, and ascertain
her feelings in the matter, for he had her happiness deeply at
heart. Subsequently he made known his views to his secretary, and
they are best expressed, perhaps, in his own words.</p>

<p>From what I have seen and heard, you have succeeded in entirely
winning the trust and love of my daughter, and though, if I had
been referred to at an earlier date, I should resolutely have set
my face against your becoming my son-in-law, I fear that matters
have gone too far now, and I therefore countenance an engagement
between you, subject to the following conditions:&mdash;You shall
pledge me your solemn word of honour that for two years you will
hold no communication with her. During that time she shall live out
of England with some relatives. If at the end of the two years you
are still both of the same mind I will sanction your marriage, and
will liberally dower my daughter, so that you may have no financial
anxiety as regards the future.'</p>

<p>Merford expressed himself as satisfied with the conditions, and
gave the necessary promise to refrain from making any attempt to
communicate with Virginia during the stipulated time. Twelve months
later Mr. Grantly died somewhat suddenly after a trying and
exhausting Parliamentary session. When his will became known to the
family it was found that he had added a codicil, embodying in
effect the verbal conditions he had made with Merford, and setting
forth that if at the end of the two years Virginia was still
desirous of becoming the wife of Merford, and subject to his
keeping his promise not to communicate with her, he was to receive
from the estate the sum of twenty-five thousand pounds, and
provision was made for settling three thousand pounds a year on her
for life, and her children, in the event of any being born, were
not forgotten. Indeed, Mr. Grantly's generosity and foresight were
displayed in a very marked manner. Until the expiry of the
stipulated two years Merford was, in the event of the testator's
death, to continue to act as secretary, and was charged with the
duty of collating, sorting, and arranging the deceased's
papers.</p>

<p>The foregoing may be taken as a sort of prologue to what
follows. Mr. Grantly had been in his grave about six months, when
Tyler Tatlock was called upon to investigate the circumstances
attending the death of a young woman, known as Mrs. Sherrington,
and her daughter, Ada, aged four and a half. For some time Mrs.
Sherrington and her child had occupied a picturesque but lonely
little cottage standing in about an acre of garden near Maidenhead.
Mrs. Sherrington led a very secluded life, and had aroused the
curiosity of the neighbourhood, for nothing was known about her,
and she seemed determined that nothing should be known, for she
visited no one, and did not encourage anyone to call upon her. She
kept no servant, but twice a week a Mrs. Rogers, a charwoman from
Maidenhead, went to the cottage to do the washing and help to clean
up.</p>

<p>One morning she went as usual&mdash;it was Friday&mdash;and she
found the house shut up. She knocked and waited and waited, and
knocked again; but, getting no response, she became alarmed,
because she knew that Mrs. Sherrington was expecting her. So she
appealed to a rural constable who was passing, and expressed her
fears that something was wrong. He was induced to obtain a ladder,
which he reared against an upper window that was unfastened.
Lifting the window, he got in, reappearing a few moments later with
the startling information that Mrs. Sherrington and her child were
lying on the bed, both dead, and he hurried off to make the affair
known in the proper quarter. A doctor who was called in said the
woman and child had been dead many hours, and, as they had both
vomited very much, he was of opinion they had both partaken of some
poisonous food. Of course a coroner's inquest was held, and the
poison theory confirmed. In a dust-bin at the back of the house a
broken pie-dish containing some remnants of a rabbit pie was found,
and, as the medical evidence proved that the dead woman and child
had partaken of rabbit pie shortly before death, the contents of
the stomachs and the remains of the pie, which had been partly
devoured by a cat, which was lying dead under a hedge a few yards
away, were subjected to analysis, and the fact revealed that the
pie was poisoned with arsenic, and mother and child had died from
arsenic poisoning.</p>

<p>Here at once was a first-class sensation, and it flew on the
wings of electricity from John o' Groat's to Land's End. It was
just the kind of mystery the public delight in, and mystery it
remained for some time. Adjournment after adjournment of the
inquest became necessary, until the difficult analytical work had
been completed, and when that was done there was no room to doubt
that mother and child had died from eating rabbit pie which was
almost saturated with arsenic. Then, of course, arose the question,
Who put the arsenic in the pie?' For the time being that question
was more difficult of answer than the most complicated of any of
Euclid's problems. No arsenic was found in the house. Mrs. Rogers
was almost the only witness. She testified to the secluded life
Mrs. Sherrington lived. She never heard of arsenic being used for
any purpose in the house, and did not consider it possible that her
mistress could have put it in the pie wilfully. Mrs. Sherrington
always seemed very happy, and was passionately fond of her child.
Mrs. Rogers was aware that on two or three occasions a gentleman
visited her mistress, but Mrs. Rogers had never seen him. Sometimes
amongst the clothing she washed at the cottage she had found a
gentleman's shirt and collars.</p>

<p>Jim Schofield was the next witness. He was a farm labourer, an
unlettered and ignorant man, but with a certain native shrewdness
and considerable intelligence. The cottage occupied by Mrs.
Sherrington stood on his master's land. The farm fields surrounded
it, and Jim worked in those fields early and late. He knew Mrs.
Sherrington, because he kept her garden tidy, for which she often
gave him a good square meal and a shilling or two. He had
occasionally seen a gentleman go to and leave the house. On the day
that Mrs. Sherrington and her little girl died it happened that Jim
was working in the field which was separated from Mrs.
Sherrington's garden by an oak paling only. Between three and four
in the afternoon he saw the gentleman open the wicket gate, go up
the garden path, and knock at the door of the house. In a few
moments the door was opened. Mrs. Sherrington and the little girl
appeared, and embraced affectionately the man, who in turn embraced
them. The witness remained working in the field in full view of the
cottage until seven o'clock, but did not see the man leave. A few
days before his master and some friends had been out
rabbit-shooting. Three of the rabbits shot were sent to Mrs.
Sherrington, and Jim took them. He never saw her again after
that.</p>

<p>This was about all the evidence there was to offer, and when
everything had been weighed and examined it was made evident beyond
all dispute that the woman and child had died from eating rabbit
pie poisoned with arsenic, but there was nothing to prove how the
arsenic got into the pie.</p>

<p>Of course this was the only verdict that could be returned under
the circumstances, but the police were fully convinced they were
face to face with a mysterious case of murder, and they enlisted
Tatlock's services without delay. He states that he had rarely had
anything submitted to him which looked so hopeless from the start
as this case did. A careful search of the premises failed to bring
to light any document or letter calculated to be of use. Mrs.
Sherrington either had no correspondents or destroyed her letters
as soon as read. But in the pocket of the dress she had worn on the
day she died was a note written on half a sheet of note paper. It
was without date or address, and was worded as follows:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dearest Ada</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">
I will run down to see you to-morrow (Thursday). I shall
arrive at the house between three and four. Kiss the Babs for
me.&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">Lovingly yours, <span class="smcap">G</span>.</p>

<p><br>
Now it happened that it was between three and four on a Thursday
that Jim Schofield saw the gentleman he had seen on two or three
occasions go into the cottage. The deduction, therefore, was that
the 'gentleman' and the writer of the note were the same. In a
drawer in Mrs. Sherrington's bedroom, amongst a quantity of linen,
a gentleman's white shirt was found, marked in one corner with the
initials 'G. M.' These things and a detailed description of the
mysterious visitor, the description being supplied by Jim
Schofield, were all that Tatlock had to guide him in the initial
stage of the inquiry. He ascertained that Mrs. Sherrington had
rented the cottage two years previously to her death from a farmer
named Archibald Gifford, the rent being twenty pounds a year,
payable quarterly. The instalments were paid with great punctuality
and regularity. In Maidenhead was a grocer's shop kept by John
Hunter. At this shop Mrs. Sherrington had been in the habit of
obtaining her supplies of groceries. Once she ran up an account of
ten pounds odd, which was not forthcoming at the time it was
expected, and, two or three applications having failed to get a
settlement, John Hunter gave the debtor peremptory notice that if
the amount was not forthcoming by a certain date he would pass the
matter into his solicitor's hands. The result was that before the
date came round Mrs. Sherrington presented a cheque in payment. The
cheque was for fifteen pounds. It was drawn in favour of Ada
Sherrington, and it was signed Alfred Smalley. The grocer cashed
the cheque, deducting his account, and handed the balance to his
customer. It was a crossed cheque, and he paid it into his bank in
the usual way.</p>

<p>Now Tatlock noted that the brief letter found in Mrs.
Sherrington's pocket and signed 'G.' had, according to the post
mark on the envelope, been posted in Paddington, and the branch
bank on which the cheque was drawn was also in Paddington. This to
him was significant. It was suggestive that the drawer of the
cheque and 'G.' both lived in Paddington; and was there not a
probability, he argued, that 'G.' and Alfred Smalley were one and
the same person? Inquiries at the bank elicited the fact that
Alfred Smalley had had a small current account there for about two
years. They did not know what or who he was, but, according to his
address in their books, he lived at 27 Ebury Street, Pimlico. This
proved to be a house kept by a woman who took in lodgers. She
received letters from Alfred Smalley, who had once lodged at her
house, though not in the name of Smalley, but Gabriel Merton. The
initials marked on the shirt were 'G. M.' The lodging-house keeper
further informed Tatlock that her late lodger had, she believed,
been living at the house of Mr. Grantly, the member of Parliament.
She did not know what Merton's occupation was, but she thought he
was 'a sort of a superior kind of servant&mdash;a gentleman's
wallet or something.'</p>

<p>Following up the clue thus obtained, Tatlock proceeded to the
house of the late Mr. Grantly, and learnt Merton's true position;
but Merton had suddenly disappeared a fort-night ago, leaving word
that he had been called to the death-bed of a relative, and would
return in a few days. But he had not returned, and had sent no word
of explanation. The late Mr. Grantly interested himself in farming,
and carried on a model farm in Essex. At this farm large quantities
of arsenic were used for sheep. Merton had recently spent much time
at the farm.</p>

<p>The gathering up of these facts placed Gabriel Merton under
grave suspicion, which was greatly strengthened when it was
ascertained that he had closed his account at the bank and removed
all his things from Mr. Grantly's house. If he were honest and
guiltless why had he gone off so strangely and tried to destroy his
tracks? Of course Tatlock learnt the story of Merton's life, for it
seemed to have been pretty well known to the late Mr. Grantly and
members of his family. Merton's description and the description of
the strange man who was in the habit of visiting Mrs. Sherrington
were identical, and all over the country this description was
circulated. A little later it was announced to Tatlock by a firm of
shipowners that a young man answering the description in every way,
though known to them as William Smith, had sailed in a ship of
theirs called the 'Somersetshire' for Melbourne. He had booked a
saloon passage, and the date of his sailing tallied with the date
of Merton's leaving Mr. Grantly's house. The 'Somersetshire' was a
sailing ship, but a fast one, and she had been gone three
weeks.</p>

<p>Tatlock laid all the facts as he had gathered them up before the
authorities, but they did not seem able to make up their minds as
to whether or not Gabriel Merton, Alfred Smalley, and William Smith
were one and the same. But Tatlock never wavered nor doubted. He
was convinced, and urging the necessity for action on the part of
the authorities, he was at last furnished with a warrant of arrest
and commissioned to start in pursuit. A stern chase is a ong [sic]
chase, and Merton had got a good start; but Tatlock secured a berth
in a P. and O. boat from Southampton for Alexandria. Thence
overland to Aden (it was long before the opening of the Suez
Canal). At Aden he got a trading steamer just starting for
Melbourne. She was a slow boat, and the passage was long and
stormy.</p>

<p>On arriving at Melbourne he learnt that the 'Somerset-shire' had
arrived weeks ago, discharged her cargo, and gone to Newcastle, on
the Hunter River, to load coal for China. Of course her passengers
had dispersed far and wide, and for the moment the trail of William
Smith was lost. But Tatlock found that a Mr. Collins, head of the
firm of Collins &amp; Co., printers, Melbourne, had come out in the
'Somersetshire,' and to him Tatlock went in the bare hope of
picking up a thread. Nor was he disappointed. Collins had become
somewhat interested in William Smith, who seemed to hold himself
aloof from every one. But Collins succeeded in winning his
confidence to some extent, inasmuch as he asked many questions
about Australia, and particularly how best to reach some gold
diggings in the Braidwood district of New South Wales. After going
on shore he dined, by invitation, two or three times at Mr.
Collins's, and finally called to say good-bye, as he was off on a
bush tramp, and was going to make his way to the diggings he had
spoken of, as he intimated that he had a cousin there.</p>

<p>Having thus got on the trail again, Tatlock was speedily
following it, accompanied by two experienced men of the mounted
police force. It was a rough and trying ride through some of the
finest of Australian scenery, which, at any other time, would have
filled Tatlock with delight. But now he was so intent on running
his quarry down that he had little thought for anything else. At
last, after rapid travelling, they crossed into New South Wales,
reached Braidwood, and learnt that a man answering the description
of the one wanted had gone to a very wild spot called Naraga, where
some quartz and alluvial diggings were being worked. Forth the
trackers went, and, not without some difficulty, reached their
destination, which, up to a recent period, when some prospectors
had discovered gold, had been one of Nature's unbroken solitudes.
William Smith was found at last, and from a portrait Tatlock
carried he had no difficulty in recognising him as Gabriel Merton.
When the warrant was read over to him he seemed aghast, but quickly
recovering himself vowed and declared that the suspicion against
him was infamous.</p>

<p>Protestations, however, were useless. He was arrested, deprived
of all weapons, and escorted under a watchful guard to Sydney. A
week later he was being conveyed back to England as a prisoner.
Tatlock found him an interesting, intelligent, and clever fellow,
and did what he could and dared to ameliorate the harsh conditions
of his position as a prisoner charged with a dreadful crime. The
prisoner's behaviour was all that could be desired. He gave no
trouble, and conformed without a murmur to the rules to which he
was subjected. Without being sullen he was silent and reserved, and
seemed to have resigned himself to his fate.</p>

<p>When the vessel, which was bound to Liverpool, reached the mouth
of the Mersey all hands were startled by the discovery that the
prisoner passenger had strangled himself in his cabin. He left a
document for Tatlock, in which he told the terrible story of his
life, and acknowledged that he was Gabriel Merton and had been
known as Alfred Smalley. When at Oxford he had made the
acquaintance of a publican's daughter, and secretly married her. He
placed her under an oath to keep the marriage secret until he gave
her permission to divulge it. At his request she went to live with
her child at the cottage near Maidenhead. As was inevitable, his
folly came home to him, and when he found that but for this
obstacle he might have married Miss Grantly and a fortune he was
maddened, and in a moment of desperation he resolved to rid himself
of his wife and child by the awful expedient of murder. At first he
did not realise the enormity of his offence. When he did he was
overwhelmed, and, unable at last to withstand the fearful strain
and suspense, as he gathered that no effort was to be spared to
bring the crime home to the guilty person, he resolved upon flight,
the end of which was to be the dark tragedy that closed his career
in sight of his native land. Had he been stronger-minded, more
self-reliant, and a clever criminal, he might have managed to
escape earthly punishment. As it was, his sin found him out, and
the cruel deaths of his wife and daughter were revenged. In his
confession he stated that he had obtained the arsenic at Mr.
Grantly's farm, and had availed himself of the opportunity afforded
by the temporary absence of his wife from the cottage to poison the
pie which she had specially pre-pared, and which stood upon the
table ready for supper.</p>

<p>The revelation of his awful wickedness killed his aged mother,
who sank beneath the shock; and the sweet girl who had believed him
true and honourable, and had loved him passionately, renounced the
world and its ways and went into a convent.</p>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>A MEMORABLE CHRISTMAS</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I &mdash; LIKE GLIDING WATER</h3>

<p class="first">
'DYING, I bequeath to you a precious legacy&mdash;my daughter,
and between dead lips I pledge you and her.'</p>

<p>Speaking these words, with a sad smile on his pale and wasted
face, Herbert Lindmark raised with trembling white hand a tumbler
of hot spirit to his lips and drank. Then replacing the glass on
the table, he put his silk handkerchief to his eyes to wipe away a
tear.</p>

<p>Herbert Lindmark, B.A. and Barrister-at-Law, was quite a young
man, being at this time under thirty; but he was drifting away,
silently but surely, like gliding water to the great ocean of
eternity.</p>

<p>Scarcely a year had passed since Mr. Lindmark, having eaten all
his dinners and passed his examinations, had been called to the
bar. But though he had installed himself in sumptuous chambers in
Lincoln's Inn, he had never yet held a brief. He had distinguished
himself at his college, and might have distinguished himself in the
profession he had chosen, had not a want of stability of character
and a fatal weakness of purpose proved his ruin. His life had been
short, but he had spent it recklessly. To use a popular phrase, he
had 'burnt the candle at both ends,' and though a strong and robust
man may sometimes do this and yet live to a green old age,
Lindmark's constitution was too delicate and his frame too weak to
withstand the liberties which had been taken with them. And so on
this cold bright Christmas morning, Herbert Lindmark, Esq.,
Barrister-at-Law, knew and felt that he was trembling on the
borders of the unknown. The scene is a comfortable room in his
chambers, and a bright fire sends out warmth and a ruddy glow, and
imparts a sort of crimson stain to the old dark oak furniture, and
the quaint knick-knacks that had been Lindmark's hobby.</p>

<p>The words with which this chapter opens were ad-dressed to his
confidant and bosom friend, John Gyde, his junior by several years.
The two young men had been at school and college together, and
since their first meeting a friendship had sprung up that had never
grown cold for a single day. John Gyde, like his friend, aspired to
wear silk, but though he was studying very hard he had not yet
attained to the dignity of a 'call' even.</p>

<p>Between these two young men the contrast in character was so
marked that their unalterable friendship presented one of those
psychological problems that it is not easy to find solutions for by
any process of ordinary reasoning. Lind-mark had been wild and
reckless; Gyde steady, plodding, and rather humdrum, and it was
obvious that if ever he gained any marked position in his
profession it would rather be by unalterable determination to reach
some given end, than by any extraordinary ability. His friend, on
the other hand, had shown certain mental power that at times
flashed out with the brilliancy of genius; but this, alas seems
ever to be a fatal gift, and the sons of genius die young.</p>

<p>Lindmark's career had been a short one, but it had had its tinge
of romance. He had come of good stock, and his father's boast was
his patrician descent. Young Lindmark's mother dying while yet in
her prime, his father had married again; but the second wife proved
an clement of strife in the family; she did not take kindly to the
children, and Herbert, who was the youngest of three sons, was sent
early to school. During his school years he showed such marked
ability that when he went to Oxford his friends predicted a
brilliant future for him. He had ever been wayward, fitful, and
impulsive, however, so that those who had watched him narrowly and
knew him best, shook their heads dubiously and expressed fears that
he would come to grief.</p>

<p>He had not been long at Oxford before he made the acquaintance
of Dorothy Whymper, whose singular beauty of face and figure earned
for her the position of the 'Belle of Oxford.' Her parents,
unfortunately, were not only humble, but very vulgar. They kept a
small public-house that was a noted rendezvous of betting men, and
her father himself combined with the business of a publican the
debasing occupation of a 'Professional Bookmaker.' These facts,
however, did not deter Herbert Lindmark from becoming infatuated
with the publican and bookmaker's daughter; and blind to the
future, indifferent to all con-sequences, reckless of self and
reputation, he secretly married her, and a few months afterwards
she bore him a daughter. It was then he began to realise the false
step he had taken; a truth that was brought more forcibly and
painfully to him by the unprincipled importunities for money which
her father was constantly making under the threat of publicly
announcing the marriage. At length, when driven to desperation,
Herbert determined to go to his own father like a prodigal son,
and, confessing his fault, sue for pardon. The confession, however,
almost stunned Mr. Lindmark. It was a crushing blow to his pride.
Sternly refusing to see his daughter-in-law, he ordered his son
never again to darken his doors. Herbert obeyed the order to the
letter, and between him and his irate parent a reconcilation [sic]
was never effected, as Mr. Lindmark died soon afterwards, his end
being accelerated, so people said, by his son's msalliance.</p>

<p>His father's death was certainly a blow to Herbert, who began to
feel the penalty of his error, for his marriage relations proved
unhappy. His wife was vain and extravagant, and at that time, owing
to his slender means, he was unable to gratify her taste, the
result being disastrous to his domestic peace. It was destined,
however, that this should not last long, for Mrs. Lindmark fell
into a rapid decline, and left him a widower. Possibly he felt this
to be a relief, and as he noticed that his daughter Dorothy gave
promise of inheriting all her mother's extraordinary beauty, he
determined that he would use every endeavour to prevent her
developing her mother's mental characteristics.</p>

<p>Fortunately about this time he came into a small but comfortable
fortune left to him by an aunt, and this enabled him to make such
provision for his child as would secure her being well brought up.
None of his own relations would ever recognise her, and as he was
painfully anxious that she should not be subject to the baneful
influences of her mother's connections, he had placed her under the
care of an English lady resident in Paris.</p>

<p>This, then, was Herbert Lindmark's little history; and now at an
age when many men can scarcely be said to have passed their youth,
his frail constitution had broken down through over-study and
dissipation, and he knew only too well that he must die.</p>

<p>His friend John Gyde was the only son of a barrister who had
gained some eminence in his day, but he had been dead three years,
and young Gyde's widowed mother was the only life between him and
the possession of a snug little estate in Devonshire, which
comprised a very quaint and curious old house known as the 'Raven's
Nest,' which had been in his family for many generations. Gyde,
notwithstanding that he came from a legal stock, had never shown
much love for the law, but at the earnest entreaties of his friend
Lindmark he had taken chambers in the Inn, and was plodding on with
his studies in a manner that was peculiarly characteristic of
him.</p>

<p>It had been his intention to have spent the Christmas, upon
which this story opens, with his mother in Devonshire, but the
serious illness of his friend had induced him to remain in town.
Gyde knew very well that his friend was dying, but still he tried
to cheer him, and in answer to his remark he said:</p>

<p>'Tut, man, don't talk of dying yet. You are worth twenty dead
men. Come, I drink to your better health.'</p>

<p>They clinked glasses, and drained a bumper, and then with forced
gaiety Gyde continued, 'So Dorothy is coming to-day, and if I
outlive you, I am to be her guardian.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mrs. Turner and she would arrive from Paris last night and
stay at an hotel. They will be here by twelve o'clock. As regards
your outliving me, that is a certainty, and for our old
friendship's sake I have appointed you Dorothy's guardian. I know
how faithfully you will per-form your trust, and that makes my
coming end less difficult to face. Her fortune will be about three
hundred a year, so that her future is secure, save in one thing.'
Lindmark paused, covered his face with his hand for a moment, then
said: 'That one thing is marriage; I suppose she will want to marry
some day; and if I could live till that time, the husband I would
choose for her would be the counterpart of yourself.'</p>

<p>'You flatter me,' said Gyde thoughtfully; 'but one thing you may
rely upon, I will guard her jealously, and no man shall ever have
my consent to wed her unless he is of sterling worth.'</p>

<p>'God bless you,' Lindmark exclaimed in a choking voice as he
grasped his friend's hand. 'But away with this melancholy. It is
the last Christmas I shall spend with you; let us try and get some
pleasure out of it.' Then, with a great sigh, he added: 'Ah, old
fellow, we have known some jolly Christmases together, eh?'</p>

<p>'Yes, and I would fain hope we may yet know others.'</p>

<p>Lindmark shook his head sadly, as, filling his own and his
friend's glass from the punch-bowl, he said, 'A toast&mdash;to be
drunk in silence&mdash;To the memory of departed pleasures.'</p>

<p>Gyde humoured his friend, knowing his peculiarities, and drank
the toast. After this, and under the influence of the liquor,
Lindmark grew more cheerful, and trilled snatches of songs; but
every now and then was interrupted by a cough that almost
asphyxiated him, and left him pale and gasping. Thus the morning
slipped away, and it was a great relief to Gyde when he heard the
bell ring, and the old housekeeper came in to announce the arrival
of 'Mrs. Turner and Miss Dorothy.' In a few minutes the door of the
apartment was flung open, and a young, bright, and laughing girl
burst into the room with a joyous cry of delight, and flying to
Lindmark, and throwing her arms round his neck, she exclaimed, 'Oh,
my dear, dear papa, I am so glad to see you!' Then suddenly, as she
heard the hacking cough and saw the bloodless face, she drew back
in alarm and said, 'Oh, papa, what is the matter? You are ill, and
you have never told me anything about it.'</p>

<p>He pressed the fair head to his shrunken chest, and with a
ghastly smile he answered:</p>

<p>'No, darling, I have not told you. I did not think it necessary
to do so. But come, come, we mustn't talk of illness now. I want
this to be a very pleasant Christmas to you, so that in after years
it may live in your memory. Possibly, dear'&mdash;here his voice
faltered&mdash;'possibly, dear, you and I will not be able to spend
next Christmas together; but if I could only get a little stronger
I would go away to some warm climate, and I might then get
perfectly well again.'</p>

<p>Lindmark spoke thus to calm the fears of his child, but he knew
perfectly well that his days were numbered, and that if his life
stretched out for another three months it was as much as it would.
Knowing the hopelessness of his case, he had become, as it were,
despairingly reckless, and was rather disposed to hasten the coming
end, and so cut short the torturing suspense, than make an attempt
to delay it.</p>

<p>His daughter was deeply affected, and cried very much, but she
was too young to fully realise the dreadful truth, and under the
influence of her father's forced laughter, and Gyde's jokes, she
grew merry as a cricket. She sat on Gyde's knee and pulled his
beard; then she played havoc amongst her father's books, and next,
with sweet wilfulness, rattled off a stirring piece on the piano.
She was, indeed, a young wild beauty, and her presence was like a
burst of glad sunshine.</p>

<p>At this time Dorothy Lindmark was about eleven years of age,
with a face of perfect sweetness. She was beautiful, and she knew
it, and she had so often heard people exclaim when they first
beheld her, 'What a pretty child; what beautiful hair she's got;
what bonny eyes!' that she had become very vain. Her skin was
almost waxen in its fairness, and her mouth was exquisitely shaped.
Her eyes were hazel and languid, while an astonishing wealth of
fair hair fell in ripples about her shoulders.</p>

<p>Mrs. Turner, under whose care Dorothy had been in Paris, was a
stiff and severe lady of a very uncertain age. Rigid as to her
morals and unbending as to her discipline, she had been iron-handed
with Dorothy, who consequently felt like a bird escaped from its
cage whenever she got a holiday.</p>

<p>The poor child was very happy on this Christmas afternoon, in
spite of the severe looks that Mrs. Turner gave her every now and
then, for this lady seemed to think that a child should be stiff,
conventional, and silent. But Dorothy, when she was with her
father, knew that she could do much as she liked, and for the sake
of these brief snatches of joyous freedom she was ready to endure
any amount of extra discipline that Mrs. Turner liked to
impose.</p>

<p>The dinner passed off very merrily, and Herbert Lindmark seemed
in unusually high spirits, and, much to good Mrs. Turner's
amazement, he allowed his daughter to partake of a little glass of
sherry, and to follow this with a glass of champagne; and the
lady's indignation reached a point when it burst into a wordy
protest as she witnessed her charge attack a third helping of the
rich Christmas pudding, very freely moistened with brandy sauce.
But Lindmark, who had never brooked authority, would tolerate no
interference now, and said politely:</p>

<p>'Excuse me, Mrs. Turner, if I say that I wish Dorothy to do as
she likes to-day.'</p>

<p>The lady felt the rebuke and held her peace, though, as the
saying is, her blood boiled; but she was a worldly-minded and
selfish woman, and knew that she could not afford to quarrel with
Mr. Lindmark.</p>

<p>Mrs. Turner was the widow of an officer in the army who had been
dead nearly a dozen years. He left her with one son and a hundred a
year, and on this scant income she had lived in genteel poverty in
Paris. The sixty guineas a year, therefore, which Mr. Lindmark
allowed her for Dorothy's keep and education was not to be lightly
thrown away. Now, notwithstanding that Mrs. Turner had highly
respectable connections, and had been well brought up and well
educated herself, she was a designing if not an unscrupulous woman,
and she was rather fond of boasting that anything that she set her
mind upon she almost invariably accomplished. One of the things
upon which her mind had long been set was the marriage of her son
to Dorothy when the children were old enough, as she believed
Dorothy to be an heiress, and, therefore, a prize worth hooking,
seeing that her son's inheritance was only a reversionary interest
in the two thousand pounds from which she derived her modest
income. Alfred Turner was more French than English, having been in
France the greater part of his life; and as a natural consequence
he had become impregnated with the insincerity and easy morality
which is so conspicuous of French youth; his mother had been to
great pains to thoroughly imbue him with the very French social
doctrines that marriage should be a marriage of convenience and
money; if love comes afterwards well and good, but if it does not
it's of no consequence as long as the money is there; but under no
circumstances must love be considered before the financial
question. It is a pernicious doctrine, but it accorded well with
Mrs. Turner's own views, and she preached it.</p>

<p>Alfred Turner was strikingly handsome, but exceedingly forward,
and quite as fast as the most lively of his French companions; and
in spite of his youth scandal had already coupled his name in a
very compromising manner with that of a young lady whose husband
occupied a diplomatic position abroad. To Dorothy he had always
strenuously endeavoured, in accordance with his mother's
promptings, to exhibit the best side of his character, and at times
to display devotion, that had it been sincere would have been
worthy the name of chivalry. Under these circumstances there was no
wonder that the child had come to enjoy the society of her boy
lover, and to feel proud and happy when he told her that some day
she should be his 'wee wifie.'</p>

<p>To return, however. When the dinner had been cleared away, and
the dessert discussed, Dorothy played several pieces on the piano
by her father's request, and as the time drew near for her and Mrs.
Turner to take their departure&mdash;for it was necessary for them
to return to the hotel to sleep&mdash;Mr. Lindmark requested
Dorothy to go with him to another apartment, as he wished to have a
quiet half-hour with her.</p>

<p>The child had spent a happy and joyous day, and one that was
likely to live green in her memory for many a long year, for it was
the first Christmas she had spent with her father for five years.
In spite of his flushed face, his apparent high spirits, and
seeming improvement in health, it is probable that Lindmark had an
impression that his end was very near, and that this might be the
last opportunity he would ever have of saying what he wished to say
to his daughter. Had this not been so, it is hard to understand why
he should have cast a shadow over the child's gaiety, and have
changed her gladness to sorrow.</p>

<p>Sinking into a large cushioned chair that had been wheeled up
before the fire, he drew her between his knees; and as her soft
cheek was laid lovingly against his, and her arms were twined about
his neck, he said in tremulous tones, 'Dolly, my darling, this is
Christmas night, and I have something solemn to say.' He paused,
for, though he often boasted of being very stoical, he was nearly
breaking down in this supreme moment. 'I am afraid, Dolly,' he
continued tenderly, 'that you will never spend another Christmas
day with me.'</p>

<p>'Why, papa?' she cried in anxious alarm, as starting back from
him to arm's length, and looking into his now ashen face and
burning eyes, she guessed the truth, child as she was.</p>

<p>He laughed a little melancholy laugh as he made answer, the
while toying nervously with her golden hair, 'Because, my pet, I am
afraid I shall never recover from my illness. There, there, my
precious darling, don't fret like that,' he added as he strained
her to him, and kissed her tenderly. Then, after a great effort to
steady his voice, he went on: Young as you are, dear, I wish you as
my daughter to meet the inevitable with strength of mind and
fortitude. What I wish to say now, and I wish you to ever remember
the words, as words coming from between dead lips, is that I have
appointed my dear companion and faithful friend John Gyde your
legal guardian. I know that he will watch over you with tender and
fatherly care; and when you shall come to be old enough to
understand such things, it will give me pleasure now to think that
he might even have the right to shield you as his wife. But do not
forget that I have never mentioned it to him. As the years pass on
and you gain discretion and wisdom, you must use them to determine
your own happiness; and that you should do so is my solemn
admonition now.'</p>

<p>This was all he had to say, and he was glad he had said it. It
had cost him a tremendous effort, but it was done and he felt
lighter, for it had seemed to him a duty he owed to his child to
speak a few words that should sink into her heart and influence her
conduct in after life.</p>

<p>Dorothy made no reply. How could she? She was too young and too
inexperienced to understand the stupendous mystery of death, and
the equally stupendous mystery of life, with all its great
responsibilities and solemn duties. She, therefore, did as any
other child would have done, she caressed her father with childish
fervour, and pressing her face to his breast she fretted
passionately.</p>

<p>And so they sat with the ruddy glow of the firelight playing
about them, and calling into being strange shadows that were,
perhaps, typical of the shadows that were coming into the girl's
life. Suddenly, on the cold still night air, a church clock slowly
tolled out eleven; and with a little start Lindmark raised the face
of his daughter, who had grown very quiet, and kissing her,
said:</p>

<p>'Come, my darling, it is time you went to bed.'</p>

<p>As Dorothy came into the lamplight of the other room, where Gyde
and Mrs. Turner were sitting, her face was flushed, her eyes
tearful, and her hair disarranged. Neither Mrs. Turner nor Gyde,
however, made any remark, although they both noticed these
signs.</p>

<p>In a little while Dorothy stood arrayed in a heavy fur-cloak,
and her sweet face framed in a woollen hood that made her look, if
possible, even more charming. But an expression of thoughtfulness
had come into that face, and caused her to appear older than her
years.</p>

<p>With her arms round her father's neck, she clung to him for some
minutes; and when at last she tore herself from him, after many
warm embraces, he said:</p>

<p>'Remember, Dolly, you come and see me quite early tomorrow.'</p>

<p>'May I come at nine o'clock, papa?' she asked between her
sobs.</p>

<p>'Yes, my darling, if you wish it.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Turner, who wisely witnessed the scene without making any
remark, was glad enough when she and her charge were descending the
stairs, piloted by John Gyde, who was to escort them to their hotel
at Charing Cross, and then return to pass the night at his friend's
chambers.</p>

<p>As soon as he was alone, and the sounds of the descending
footsteps had died away, Lindmark uttered a great sob, and sank
like a lump of lead upon the couch. In a few minutes he struggled
to his feet, and seizing a bottle half full of champagne that stood
on the table, he poured out a tumblerful of the wine and drained it
at a draught. For a few brief moments it gave him a deceptive
strength; but suddenly there spread over his face a ghastly pallor,
and a little frothy blood oozed from between his lips. Clasping his
hands to his face in a paroxysm of anguish, he uttered a deep moan
of pain, then staggering back he fell, with his body on the floor
and his head resting against the couch. It was long past midnight
when Gyde strolled leisurely back through the silent and deserted
streets. It was bitterly cold; the air was keen with frost, and the
stars glittered superbly. Gyde was very thoughtful, and a shade
melancholy. He thought of the severe and rigid Mrs. Turner; of the
sweet child-face of Dorothy as he had last seen it framed in its
woollen hood; and of the pallid wasted face of his dying friend,
and he dreamed and speculated upon the future; wondered what his
own future would be; what Dorothy's future would be; and whether
his friend had any future. The latter part of his speculation was
soon answered, for when, a few minutes later, he entered Herbert
Lindmark's chamber, he found the silence which could never be
unsealed. The current of Lindmark's life, like gliding water, had
merged itself into the ocean of mystery which is called Death.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II &mdash; WITH A PASSIONATE WAIL OF PITIFUL PAIN</h3>

<p class="first">
IVY-COVERED and honeysuckled, with quaint gable ends, and oriel
windows, a smoothly shaven lawn sloping down to the brink of the
river that flowed ever onward with a murmuring song, a few old elm
trees overshadowing the house that stood in a scene of romantic
beauty. Such was the 'Raven's Nest,' the peaceful country home of
John Gyde, Esq., who was able to put Barrister-at-Law after his
name, but who had never held a brief, and was never likely to
do.</p>

<p>During the seven years that had passed since his friend
Lindmark's death on that memorable Christmas night, many changes
had taken place in John Gyde's circumstances. He had been called to
the Bar, and had come into his fortune through his mother's death.
The law had never been particularly attractive for him; he
preferred the retirement and pleasures associated with the life of
a country gentleman. Although not wealthy, John had ample means for
the gratification of his simple tastes. His home, while not
luxurious, might have served as a model for the most perfect
comfort. Scarcely yet in the prime of life, and healthy and
vigorous, he seemed destined to know a great many peaceful years. A
handsome man and favoured by fortune, he might have had his pick of
Devonshire beauties, but he had chosen to remain single, much to
the astonishment of many a designing mother; and to the sorrow of
many a young lady who would have lived in sackcloth and ashes for a
whole year to have become the mistress of the Raven's Nest.' But
Gyde avoided all the snares that were set for him, and was proof
against the languishing looks and sweet smiles lavished upon him.
He was a perplexing riddle to the Devonshire feminine world; and
not a few shrewd ladies of uncertain age shook their heads sagely,
and said, 'Ah! depend upon it, Mr. John Gyde has designs upon his
ward.' Now, Mr. John Gyde's ward upon whom he was said to have
designs was Dorothy Lindmark, the daughter of his dead friend, and
his sacred trust given to him between dead lips.</p>

<p>Dorothy, or 'Doll,' as he delighted to call her, was in her
nineteenth year. Beautiful as a child, she was infinitely more
beautiful now that the stamp of womanhood had set its seal upon
her.</p>

<p>For three years after her father's death, which had been a sore
trial to her, she had remained in Paris under Mrs. Turner's charge.
But one day she had written a hurried letter to her guardian asking
him to take her away at once. On receiving this note he had lost
not a moment in starting for Paris, and on arrival there he found
his ward evidently unhappy. The cause of her unhappiness she would
not state, though she persisted in her desire to be removed, and on
his ordering her things to be packed up ready for the home-ward
journey, a scene ensued between him and Mrs. Turner. The lady was
evidently unprepared for this summary mode of doing business, and
at first was disposed to be obstinate, but at last, recognising how
fruitless it would be to oppose Dorothy's legal guardian, she
withdrew her opposition, but proceeded to heap opprobrium upon the
girl, accusing her of inconstancy and ingratitude, an accusation
that was supported by Mrs. Turner's son Alfred. This was the first
occasion upon which Alfred and Gyde had met, and it was nearly
being marked by what at first threatened to be a serious quarrel.
But with great dignity and firmness, Gyde told the young man that
he did not recognise him, and would have nothing to say to him.
Turner felt himself very effectually snubbed, and like all
mean-spirited men he felt very bitter; and he made use of these
words just as Gyde and his charge were on the point of leaving the
house:</p>

<p>'Look here, Mister Gyde'&mdash;he strongly emphasized the word
Mister&mdash;'look here, Mister Gyde, you've insulted me, and
there's bad blood between us. If you were going to stay in France,
I would call you out and shoot you like a cur. But don't think I'll
forget you. Some day, perhaps, I'll retaliate.'</p>

<p>Gyde attached no importance to these words. He looked upon them
as the frothy outpourings of a vanity-stricken boy, whose vanity
had been wounded, and as such beneath contempt. He therefore did
not even make reply, and in a little while had turned his back upon
Paris, and was glad to have 'Doll' safely under his care.</p>

<p>For a year after this, John Gyde's life was very bright and very
peaceful; and all his energies, all his concern, all his thoughts,
were devoted to and of his ward. Her happiness and pleasure were
his constant study, and in order that she should not go from his
watchful care he engaged a most accomplished governess for her, but
suddenly, like a flash of lighting from a summer sky, came a blight
upon his peace, and a shadow on his hearth. The governess one
morning sent a request that he would grant her an interview, and on
his doing so she almost stunned him by expressing strong suspicion
that Dorothy was secretly corresponding with a gentleman.</p>

<p>Gyde heard this statement in silence, and with the almost
stately dignity that was part of his character, and on dismissing
her, he promised to investigate the matter. For several days
afterwards he said nothing, but his troubled face told how great
the shock had been; and yet he could not bring himself to believe
it could possibly be true. He had such faith in Doll, and that
faith was not to be destroyed lightly. Still his interest in his
beautiful house and grounds seemed suddenly to cease. He was
frequently observed walking in gloomy silence in some of the
bye-paths, or sitting dejected and thoughtful in his favourite seat
under the great ivy-clad elm that was such a graceful ornament in
the centre of the lawn. This change in his manner was not likely to
escape notice. The housekeeper noticed it, the chambermaids noticed
it, the gardener, the groom, the coachman noticed it, and wondered
and talked amongst themselves as to the cause, and last, not least,
Dorothy herself noticed it, and one morning followed him into the
grounds, and said:</p>

<p>'John'&mdash;he had taught her to call him John&mdash;'there is
something the matter with you. I wish you would tell me what it
is.'</p>

<p>Then ensued within himself a terrible struggle. Was he to doubt
and lose faith; or should he say nothing, but go on believing that
it was impossible for her to deceive him? With such a man, so
sterling, so rugged in his honesty, so strong in the grand old
chivalry, a struggle between doubt and faith was likely to be very
severe, and it was. But at length it seemed to him that it was his
duty to tell her what he had heard, and in a few well-chosen
sentences he did so.</p>

<p>At first she seemed covered with shame and confusion, and then
indignantly denied it. It was sweet music to his ears that denial,
and in a moment he had caught her in his arms, and while he
caressed her he craved her pardon for ever thinking for one brief
instant that she could possibly be guilty of deception.</p>

<p>It followed as a matter of course that the unfortunate governess
was dismissed. But she went in sorrow and not in anger, and
protested strongly that she had spoken truly. This protest,
however, had no influence with John. His ward's denial had built
his faith up whole again, and as against that denial all the
protests in the world would have been unavailing, and so the peace
and the brightness came back; the shadow went from off his hearth,
and joy reigned once more in the 'Raven's Nest.'</p>

<p>It is possible that no man ever watched a girl bud and blossom,
as it were, into womanhood with more tender solicitude, and more
fervent admiration, than he did. Not ordinarily a demonstrative
man, he became demonstrative over her. With her growth grew his
love also, and John Gyde fondly dreamed of the time when his ward
would become his wife. He had dreamed this dream from the memorable
Christmas, when his dear friend Lindmark had said, 'Between dead
lips,' and with the solemn knowledge of his near end: 'I suppose
she will want to marry some day; and if I could live till that
time, the husband I would choose for her would be the counterpart
of yourself.' Gyde had gazed on her childish face that night, as
wrapped in her hood she was a study for a painter, and he said to
himself: 'I understand poor Herbert's meaning, and I will try and
teach her to love me.' And then, as he returned to his friend's
chambers on that bright frosty night, after he had escorted Dorothy
and Mrs. Turner to their hotel, he mused thus: 'Poor child, I will
be a father to you; and some day, perhaps, a husband to you. But,
whether or not, I will try earnestly to make your life a sweet
harmony, devoid of one jarring note. Hitherto I have gone through
the world purposeless almost. Now I have a purpose, and that
purpose shall be an attempt to make from one of the sweetest of
children one of the most perfect of women.'</p>

<p>This was, perhaps, a romantic dream, but John was a young man
and might be forgiven. At any rate, from the moment that he, with
wonderful gentleness, broke to Dorothy the news of her father's sad
death on that memorable Christmas night, up to the present moment,
his purpose had become fixed and unalterable, and with true
nobleness, and a great-hearted chivalry, he had tried to accomplish
it; but never once had he breathed a syllable of love to her.
Before he did that he wanted to learn her heart, and to know
whether she could give him something more than affection&mdash;give
him what a true man desires from a true woman&mdash;pure love, love
that shall find no delight in aught else but the loved object; love
that shall feel that in its object it finds its hope, its trust,
its world, its bliss, its heaven. 'She shall never become mine from
a mere sense of duty,' he said to himself, and John Gyde was too
true a gentleman ever to depart from that.</p>

<p>The peace that came back to him when Doll denied that there was
any truth in her governess's suspicions was not to remain long
undisturbed. He was an observing man, and he noticed often there
was a little cloud of trouble in her face, and the lightness of
spirits which had hitherto so distinguished her gave place to a
certain thoughtfulness that at times almost became abstraction.</p>

<p>Naturally enough this troubled him very much; but once, and only
once, did he venture to question her as to the cause of this
change, and her answer was: 'I think, John, you are getting
morbidly nervous. There is really no change in me.' But there was a
change, and John saw it; and when he had endured anxiety many weeks
he was tempted into questioning her maid as to whether she knew of
any-thing likely to cause her young mistress trouble.</p>

<p>This maid was a French girl, a few years older than Dorothy, who
had known her in Paris, and had begged her guardian to allow her to
take her into her service, a request that was at once granted, when
John had made the necessary inquiries about the girl's character.
She was known as Marie Delorme, and, as she had always exhibited
great devotion and attachment for her mistress, John had allowed
her many advantages and great freedom; in fact, had treated her
more like a member of his family than a servant.</p>

<p>In reply to his questioning she expressed great surprise, and
said that she knew of nothing that could cause Dorothy any
concern.</p>

<p>John did not feel satisfied, but what could he do? 'I will be
patient and wait,' he thought, 'and some day she will make me her
confidant.'</p>

<p>Save for this little trouble in his own heart, and which he kept
to himself, John Gyde's domestic life went on smoothly enough, and
Doll reached her nineteenth birthday. Beauty itself had set its
seal upon her. Men loved her, and women envied her.</p>

<p>It was soon after this, and on Christmas day, that John Gyde
determined to speak to her of himself for the first time. He
selected Christmas day, because that day had been marked with a red
cross in the calendar of both their lives; if a certain sadness was
associated with it, it was a purifying sadness, and one that
certainly knit them together in a bond of close acquaintance, and
which he hoped would bind them in a still closer bond that only
death itself could sever.</p>

<p>For years it had been his custom&mdash;a custom hallowed by his
father and mother for nearly half a century&mdash;to keep open
house at Christmas time, so that the 'Raven's Nest' had become
famed for its hospitality. John had the good old-fashioned
notion&mdash;a notion that would be better for our common humanity
were it more often acted up to&mdash;that Christmas time was a time
of peace; that is, a time of peace in the sense that the truest
charity of the heart should be exercised towards one's fellows, and
that injuries should be forgiven, and friendships cemented.</p>

<p>It was a white Christmas truly this, for the weather had been
singularly severe for many days. A great snowstorm had swept over
the country, and this had been followed by an extraordinarily low
temperature, so that the land was locked in the grip of a powerful
frost that hardened the snow to iron, and bound up streamlets and
ponds in ice of more than a foot in thickness.</p>

<p>John, his guests, and his ward worshipped in the village church
that morning, and Dorothy herself had helped to make the church
bright with flowers and holly.</p>

<p>'Doll, I should like to have a quiet half-hour with you in the
library before dinner, if you will grant me the favour,' he said,
as they returned from church.</p>

<p>It struck him that his request caused her some annoyance,
judging from a look that came into her face, and he said
quietly:</p>

<p>'Never mind, my dear. If it's not agreeable to you to give me
the half-hour, I can say what I've got to say some other time.'</p>

<p>'Oh no, John. I will come, of course, if you wish it.'</p>

<p>The manner in which this was said troubled him, because he
fancied that they were words that did not come from the heart. But
he reasoned with himself thus&mdash;'John, John, do not be unjust;
you are growing suspicious, and are inclined to misinterpret
Dorothy's acts and words.' And so some time afterwards, when she
presented herself at his library door, he took both her hands in
his, and looking into her fair, sweet face, he said:</p>

<p>'Doll, I have done you a wrong in my heart, because I thought
when I asked you to come here that you seemed unwilling to come. I
sue for your pardon.'</p>

<p>During all the years that he had known her he had never once,
not even when she was a child, kissed her. He had purposely avoided
doing this, as he had purposely avoided doing anything that might
raise the foul breath of scandal against her fair fame. Throughout,
his conduct towards her, both in public and private, had been
studied and reserved. In all his bearing he had been her legal
guardian, and he could have defied the world to say that for a
single instant the guardian had ever become merged into the lover.
Yet now he was tempted&mdash;so strongly tempted&mdash;that he
almost yielded to kiss her fair white forehead. But he resisted,
and led her to a scat.</p>

<p>'Doll,' he commenced, as she did not answer his remark, 'if I
did not know that on this day you always think solemnly of that
memorable Christmas, eight years ago, when your dear father and my
friend died in his chambers in Lincoln's Inn, I would not have
ventured to remind you of it. But I have something to say, and it
seems to me that this is the proper and fitting day upon which to
say it. Eight years ago, on that sad Christmas morning, your father
and I had been talking of your future. He told me that he had
appointed me your guardian, and said: "Dying, I bequeath to you a
precious legacy: my daughter, and between dead lips I pledge you
and her;" and subsequently he added words that burnt themselves
into my brain. After speaking of the fortune you would have, he
said: "Her future is secure save in one thing&mdash;that one thing
is marriage. I suppose she will marry some day, and if I could live
till that time the husband I should choose for her would be the
counterpart of yourself."'</p>

<p>As he repeated this, Dorothy, who had become very pale, suddenly
pressed her handkerchief to her face, and letting her head fall
upon the arm of the sofa upon which he sat, she burst into tears.
This emotion seemed so natural to Gyde that, though he did not like
to see her weeping, he did not attempt to disturb her; but wishing
to get done with what he had determined to do, and believing that
no more favourable opportunity than the present could occur, he
continued:</p>

<p>'Those words of your father's were pregnant with a great meaning
for me. I know that he meant that he wished you to become my wife
when time had ripened you. I would ask you now whether during the
years that I have humbly striven to justify the trust he reposed in
me, and to do my duty to you, I have in your estimation proved
myself worthy of asking you for your love, of asking you to become
my wife?'</p>

<p>He had spoken hastily, and with apparent trepidation, as if his
feelings were not altogether under his control.</p>

<p>Looking up as he uttered the last word, she exclaimed with a
passionate sob&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, John, forgive me. It cannot be. I cannot love you,
excepting as a dear, dear, good true friend.'</p>

<p>'So ends my dream,' he said, with a deep sigh that told only too
well how his heart had rent. Then rising, he crossed to her, and
laying his hand on her head as if in blessing, he said: 'I will
always be your good and true friend; and never again will I ask you
to let me be anything else. I will leave you to compose yourself,
my dear, for the dinner-bell will ring soon.'</p>

<p>He had controlled himself now with a mighty effort, and he
waited a few moments to see if she would make reply, or stay him
from going; but she did not raise her head even to look at him, and
her only utterances were sobs. So he went forth from the room a
changed man.</p>

<p>It was a merry and jovial party that sat down that Christmas
night to partake of the hospitality of the 'Raven's Nest.' But at
the festive board was a skeleton, though only two persons saw it.
Those two were John Gyde and his ward, Dorothy Lindmark. She was
slightly paler than usual, and her face wore an expression of
anxiety. He was, as he ever was, the hospitable host, the courtly
gentleman, with ready wit and keen anticipatory attention to the
wants of his guests. Alas, how little did those guests dream that
these two people felt that the festivities were a mockery so long
as the skeleton was there confronting them!</p>

<p>So sped the night away with jest and song. The holly glistened
on the wall, and beneath the laughing mistletoe many a bearded face
touched ruby lips. But silence at last reigned throughout the
house. The guests had gone to their rooms, and all was quiet where
laughter a little while ago had made the rafters ring. John Gyde
had not yet retired, but feeling lonely and sad he had betaken
himself to his snug little sanctum that he was fond of calling his
study; where, in dressing-gown and slippers, he had ensconced
himself in his great easy chair wheeled before the fire. He had lit
a cigar, but it had been a mechanical act, and, with his elbow
resting on the arm of the chair and his hand supporting his head,
he was gazing dreamily into the glowing embers, and his other arm,
with the cigar between the long white fingers, hung listlessly over
the other side of the chair.</p>

<p>Never before had Doll gone to bed without first coming to wish
him good-night, but this night she had suddenly disappeared without
word or sign to him; and subsequently, on making inquiries, he was
informed that she had complained of a violent headache, and had
retired much earlier than usual.</p>

<p>'Ah, poor child,' he thought, 'I have done her a wrong in
speaking of love. I ought to have known that she did not love me,
and should have kept my love an inviolable secret. Poor Doll, how
bright your life should be, could I order it as I could wish! It is
eight years ago since your father died, and the trust he placed in
my hands, as he spoke from the brink of the grave, I have held as
something sacred, and have humbly tried to do my duty. Dear old
Lindmark, well do I remember your strange words on that memorable
Christmas night&mdash;"Dying, I bequeath to you a precious
legacy&mdash;my daughter; and between dead lips I pledge you and
her!" I wonder, if your poor dead lips could speak to-night, if
they would praise or blame me.'</p>

<p>Thus John Gyde ruminated, and as the last thought passed through
his brain he was suddenly startled into vigilance by a strange
sound. It was a metallic sound like the falling of an iron bar, and
it echoed hollow and strangely through the silent house. Now, Gyde
was not a superstitious man. He was too intelligent and
strong-minded for that; but for the moment that sound begat a
feeling in him that had had no counterpart during his whole life, a
feeling, no doubt, that was consequent on his then frame of mind,
for, coming coincident with the memory of his dead friend, it was
strange. But he was not the man to accept effects without trying to
learn something of causes; and if superstition did for the single
instant touch him, he had soon shaken it off, and, flinging his
scarcely burnt cigar into the grate, he rose and listened.</p>

<p>In order to make what followed more intelligible to the reader
it is necessary to briefly describe the ground plan of the
house.</p>

<p>The main entrance was by a large old-fashioned porch reached by
a flight of stone steps from the carriage drive. From the porch a
massive oaken door gave entrance to the hall, which was a spacious
passage with rooms on either side, one of these rooms nearest the
entrance being John's snuggery, the window of which looked over the
lawn and the river. The main staircase led up from the hall. This
staircase, which was of dark polished oak, was guarded by massive
carved balustrades, and the lower pilaster was surmounted by a
griffin rampant, its fore paws resting on a shield, this being the
coat of arms of the Gyde family&mdash;their motto, 'Animo, non
astutia.' The head of the first flight of stairs was ornamented by
beautifully arranged plants, that were backed by an exquisite
stained-glass window. This landing and window, of course, faced
anyone entering the house. As a precaution against any contingency
that might arise the master of 'Raven's Nest 'insisted upon a light
being kept burning all night on this landing, and it was the duty
of the butler, the last thing after the gas was turned out in the
house, to place a small lamp in a niche in the wall at right angles
with the stained-glass window, and the lamp was so placed on this
particular night. Between the stair and the wall, the passage
necessarily contracted to narrower limits, ran the full length of
the house, then turned sharply to the left, descended a flight of
steps to the basement, where a door gave egress to the grounds.
This door at night was not only securely bolted by two large bolts,
one at the top and one at the bottom, but a massive iron bar,
working on a centre swivel, rendered it more secure. This bar, if
it was unfastened carelessly and allowed to swing by its own weight
on its swivel, always made a rattling noise. Of course, Gyde was
acquainted with this fact, and as he stood he instantly solved the
mystery of the sound that had startled him&mdash;it was the falling
bar that had made it. The bar being moved at that time of night
indicated something wrong, he thought, and by one of those strong
instincts, or promptings, that come to men in supreme moments, Gyde
turned down his own lamp, drew back the heavy tapestry curtains
that screened the bay window of the room, and, stepping into the
recess, he lifted one of the laths of the venetian blind and peered
out, and by the weird light of the stars he saw what he believed to
be the figure of a man creeping along the lawn towards the
shrubbery at the back of the house.</p>

<p>John was quick to act. He stepped back, drew the curtain again,
touched the bell-pull that communicated with the butler's
sleeping-room, opened a drawer in his desk, and took therefrom a
revolver that he always kept loaded as a precautionary measure
against midnight intruders, for he held the good old-fashioned
faith that an Englishman's house is his castle, and that he has a
right to defend it. Thus armed, he quietly opened the door of his
study and stepped into the hall, and as he did so he started again,
and back came that feeling of&mdash;shall I say
superstition?&mdash;for there on the landing, thrown into strong
relief by the green plants and the stained window, was a white
shrouded figure.. It seemed to wave an arm to him, and then
suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>'What is this mystery?' he thought. 'Can it be possible for the
dead to come back?' He stood irresolute. What man would not under
such circumstances? But the feeling went as quickly as it came, and
he was the strong, bold man again, for he fancied he heard somebody
moving at the bottom of the passage.</p>

<p>Grasping his revolver firmly and making but little noise with
his slippered feet, he hurried in the direction, and when he
reached the angle, already spoken of, the cold blast of air that
came up told him plainly that the door below was open.</p>

<p>'So; burglars!' he thought.</p>

<p>He hurried down the flight of steps. The door was open, and the
rush of keen frosty air made him shiver. He stood and listened. It
was strange how silent every-thing was. His heart throbbed and he
heard it, and out-side the leaves rustled like the sweep of wings.
Then came another sound; it was a footstep on the gravel he was
sure. John stepped boldly out and cried, 'Who is there?' There was
no answer, unless the night wind sighing in the leaves with ghostly
moan answered. Gyde passed through the shrubbery, and got a full
view of the lawn, and his eyes, now accustomed to the darkness, saw
a figure near the ivy-clad elm tree.</p>

<p>'Who are you? If you are a stranger, you are trespassing on my
grounds; stop, or I'll fire,' Gyde shouted.</p>

<p>But the figure did not answer, and did not seem to stop, so Gyde
levelled his weapon, and cried, 'If you value your life, stop!'</p>

<p>Suddenly the figure was lost in the shadow thrown by the trunk
of the tree, and then, with the intention of inducing a wholesome
fear of his authority in the breast of the trespasser, Gyde fired
towards the tree. Instantly a piercing scream rose on the night
wind&mdash;it was the scream of a woman. With an awful, sickening
fear in his breast, John rushed forward. He saw a man speed away
across the lawn to the river, and he saw the huddled-up form of a
woman lying at the foot of the tree. He stooped down and raised
her. Then, with a passionate wail of pitiful pain, he
exclaimed&mdash;' God forgive me! It's Doll!'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III &mdash; ERRORS, LIKE STRAWS UPON THE SURFACE,
FLOW</h3>

<p class="first">
THE pistol-shot and the woman's scream had aroused the
household, but previous to this the alarm-bell rung by John had
disturbed Mr. Septimus Smith, the butler, from his first sleep.
This gentleman had been entertaining his fellow-servants in his own
snuggery to a very recherche' little supper, and he had imbibed
slightly more of his master's port wine than was good for him, or
than his master might have approved of. So, on retiring, Mr.
Septimus Smith, being in a somewhat absent state of mind, had
neglected to perform his usual nightly toilet, and no doubt he was
a little amazed himself, when startled into wakefulness by the
warning bell, to find that he was still attired in his pantaloons
and claw-hammer coat, and that he had even neglected to remove his
boots; while a candle that he had left burning had a snuff fully an
inch long surmounted by 'a death's head.' However, all things in
the end are generally wisely ordered, and this was especially the
case with Mr. Septimus Smith, who, notwithstanding that he was a
little unsteady on his pins, and slightly muddled in his head, was
ready prepared for any emergency, even to a lighted candle.</p>

<p>'I wonder what that bell means,' was Mr. Septimus Smith's sage
reflection as he sat bolt upright and rubbed his eves; and then,
after a pause of some duration, he added with a resigned philosophy
that was really touching and beautiful: 'I suppose as it's
Christmas time master's been a-making a beast of hisself, and wants
me to help him up to his bed. But I consider as how such a duty as
that would be unbecoming to a gentleman of my standing, so I ain't
a-going to do anything as is against my dignity.'</p>

<p>Having thus expressed his views, Mr. Septimus Smith was
addressing himself to sleep once more, when there arose on the
night air the sounds of a pistol-shot and a woman's scream. The
effect on Mr. Smith was almost electrical, and with upraised hair,
pale face, and trembling limbs, he was suddenly standing in the
centre of the room as though he had been shot from the bed by a
catapult.</p>

<p>'Oh, lud; oh, lud!' he cried, 'there's murder a-being done!'
Then he cautiously peeped out on to the passage, as he heard an
uproar and many anxious inquiries being addressed to each other by
frightened servants and guests. In a few minutes more, Mr. Septimus
Smith was heroically bringing up the rear of an excited little
crowd of guests and servants all struggling towards the stairs, on
which they were met by Marie Delorme, Dorothy's French maid.
Covered with shame and confusion, this young lady was struggling up
as the guests were struggling down, and from the fact that her hair
was disordered and hanging down her back, and that her only garment
was a <i>robe de nuit</i>, it might have been safely assumed that
shewas the ghostly figure that Gyde had seen on the landing. Such,
then, were the details of an exciting picture as, 'pale as death,'
and bearing the inanimate form of Dorothy in his arms, John Gyde
rushed into the hall.</p>

<p>'For the love of Heaven,' he cried, in a passionate appeal,
'some of you ride to the village for Dr. Williams Don't spare the
horses; don't wait for anything; go as you are&mdash;go at
once!'</p>

<p>Instantly there was wailing and weeping amongst the women folk,
but men sprang forward in answer to that heart-broken appeal. There
was necessarily confusion; lights were procured, the stables
opened, two or three of the horses hastily saddled and being ridden
at a mad gallop along the hard frost-bound ground.</p>

<p>In the meantime, John Gyde had conveyed his burden into the
dining-room, and laid her on the great wool rug. She was fully
dressed, and wore a bonnet; and in addition to a heavy cloak she
had a woollen shawl round her shoulders. Willing hands soon removed
these things, which were saturated with blood, and it was then seen
that there was a jagged wound in the fleshy part of the left side
of the neck.</p>

<p>Amongst many accomplishments that Gyde had acquired was a
smattering of that of surgery. He had studied it a bit because, as
he said, 'one never knew when it might be useful.' As in most
country houses, the 'Raven's Nest' was provided with a well-stocked
medicine chest, and this and John's knowledge served him in good
stead now, for he was enabled to apply some simple remedies that
were effectual in stopping the outflow of that precious life
current.</p>

<p>For one long hour&mdash;an hour hideous with a sort of nightmare
distortions to John Gyde&mdash;the poor fellow bent over the silent
form of his ward, and never once for the briefest instant relaxed
his efforts to save the darling life. His brain was on fire, his
heart like lead, and he felt that if she died he must either go
raving mad or kill himself. At the end of this hour the excited
messengers who had ridden to the village returned heated and
anxious, bringing with them Dr. Williams, who bore a high local
reputation as a surgeon. He was an elderly man, calm and staid.
Entering the room, he removed his hat, muffler, and gloves,
directing a keen, searching professional glance at the still
unconscious Dorothy, nodding to Gyde, and bowing to the assembled
ladies and gentlemen, and doing these things simultaneously in a
sense, and with the grave professional air of a man who thoroughly
understands his business; and as a further proof that hedidso, he
remarked to those assembled:</p>

<p>'Permit me to request that you withdraw, ladies and gentlemen,
if you please.'</p>

<p>The ladies and gentlemen were not at all loth to do this, and
the ladies, suddenly awakening to the fact that being en dshabill
they were in a very unpresentable condition, scampered off to their
rooms; while the gentlemen gathered in the billiard-room to discuss
the mysterious affair, and suggest all sorts of theories to account
for it; for John Gyde had been too much distressed to offer any
explanations. Of course, Gyde remained by Dorothy's side, and as
Dr. Williams stooped down and first of all felt the pulse, he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>'What is the history of this case, Mr. Gyde?'</p>

<p>The sad story was soon told. Much as John would have liked to
have screened Dorothy, he could not pervert the truth.</p>

<p>'I find that the bullet has passed right through the neck and
has been within an ace of severing the carotid artery.'</p>

<p>'Will she live, Doctor?' Gyde asked in agonised voice.</p>

<p>'She may,' the Doctor replied in that pronounced professional
way which indicated that, in order not to compromise himself, he
clearly meant that there was an ellipsis to be supplied to complete
his sentence, and the ellipsis was or may not.</p>

<p>In all probability, John Gyde was not slow to take it in this
way, for with a choking sensation in his throat he gasped:</p>

<p>'Save her life, Doctor; she is too young and too beautiful to
die.'</p>

<p>He could say no more; he felt, in fact, as if he would fall down
dead himself if he remained another minute, and so somehow he got
out of the room and into his own room. Then, in his solitude and
loneliness, his lacerated heart found vent for its pain. Such
sorrow as John Gyde suffered that night is too sacred for mere
words. The sad night passed away, and the morning, bright and clear
and cold, came as a relief. A programme of amusements had been
drawn up the day previous for Boxing Day, but, of course, it was
abandoned, and most of the guests, out of respect for the dreadful
blow that had fallen upon the unhappy master of 'Raven's Nest,'
prepared to take their departure.</p>

<p>Dr. Williams remained with his patient all night, and brought
all his skill to bear on the case. At eight o'clock he felt that he
could venture to go away.</p>

<p>Blear-eyed, haggard, careworn, ghastly in his sorrow and
weariness, Gyde met him in the hall.</p>

<p>'What is your report now, Doctor?' he asked in a hoarse
whisper.</p>

<p>'I venture to think we may hope; but I warn you that her life
hangs by a thread. Absolute quietude is imperative. The slightest
excitement will kill her. You must not go near her under any
circumstances. I have left the necessary instructions for her
treatment during my absence. I will return at twelve.'</p>

<p>John retired again to his room, but he summoned Mr. Septimus
Smith, and by that gentleman sent a message to his guests,
expressing his sense of dreadful sorrow for the sad and sudden
termination of the festivities, and he asked their indulgence and
sympathy in his bereavement.</p>

<p>Of course, after this it would have been discourteous for anyone
to have remained, and in a few hours they had all gone, and the
silence of an unrelieved sorrow brooded mournfully over the
'Raven's Nest.'</p>

<p>And so a week passed during which hope rose and fell. During
this time John was not allowed to go near the patient. It was a
torturing trial for him, and the suspense was cruel, but he
endeavoured to bear it with fortitude.</p>

<p>On the eighth day from the time of the accident a little
incident occurred that was pregnant with a great meaning. Marie
Delorme, who had kept her room during the week on the plea of
illness from sorrow for her mistress, descended to the dining-room,
where Dorothy still lay, for it had not been considered safe to
remove her. Fortunately the Doctor happened to be present,
otherwise the consequences might have been more serious. Dorothy
grew excited on seeing Marie, and with a shriek she exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Take that woman away. Don't let her come near me. All this is
through her.'</p>

<p>What more might have been said it is difficult to tell had not
Marie heat a hasty retreat; but even those few words were
significant. Dr. Williams thought it wise in the present state of
matters to keep this scene a secret, but it took all his skill and
tact to soothe the excited patient; and for some hours afterwards
there was danger of grave complications arising in the case.</p>

<p>On the following morning, Marie having failed to see her master,
requested the coachman to drive her to the station, as she was so
ill that she wished to go home to her friends without a moment's
delay. Of course, the coachman complied with the request, and
taking her boxes and belongings, and even some of the belongings of
her mistress, Marie Delorme departed, and was heard of no more.</p>

<p>This incident had no effect upon Gyde. He was too absorbed, too
sorrowful, too broken, to bestow any thought upon such a matter. Of
course, there had been a good deal of scandal arising out of the
'Shooting affair up at the Raven's Nest'&mdash;as in local parlance
it had come to be spoken of. The small-brained people, the silly
chatterers, and the would-be wiseacres (who exist in every
community) had many spiteful things to say, and not a few sinister
rumours floated about. But if Gyde heard them at all, he certainly
did not heed them. He knew well enough that your human drone who is
only conspicuous by his objection-able buzz cannot live against
contempt. Nothing wounds brainless gossips so much as to find that
their impertinences pass unnoticed.</p>

<p>During these dark and dreary days John Gyde saw no company. To
all comers alike the invariable answer was, 'Master cannot be
seen.' They were agonising days indeed to the poor fellow; days
filled with dreadful suspense and crushing anxiety.</p>

<p>At last, when a fortnight had drifted away, Dr. Williams
reported his patient quite out of danger. Then John felt as if he
had been relieved from a hideous incubus, and he breathed freely
for the first time since that awful night. During the fortnight he
had not been allowed to sec his ward, and the Doctor said that at
least another week must pass before he could sanction an
interview.</p>

<p>It was a long weary week to John Gyde; but at length, towards
the end of January, on a brilliantly bright morning, when the air
was keen with frost, and the sunlight streamed in a golden flood
from a cloudless sky, John found himself in Dorothy's room.</p>

<p>It was a charming room, occupying one of the best positions in
the house, and commanding a perfectly enrapturing panorama of
river, woodland, and fell. In fitting it up for his ward he had
exercised the most exquisite art tastes, and no expense had been
spared. Here, with a fleecy, snow-white shawl wrapped around her,
Dorothy sat before a glowing fire. Pale and thin she was, but very
beautiful in spite of it. As soon as the door had closed and John
was alone with her, he threw himself at her feet, and taking her
delicate white hand kissed it fervently.</p>

<p>'Doll, my darling child; how can you ever forgive me?' he cried,
forgetting in his utter unselfishness that he was the wronged one
and she the sinner.</p>

<p>'John, you must rise,' she said in a voice that only too
painfully told how ill she had been. 'It is not your place to kneel
to me, but mine to you. Willingly would I perform that act of
penitence if my strength would permit me, but I am too weak. Nay,
do not interrupt me,' she said quickly as he was about to speak.
'My heart will break; I shall die if you don't let me relieve my
over-burdened conscience.' He rose to his feet and seated him-self
at a respectful distance from her. 'Ah, John,' she continued with a
sob, 'I have grown very old during my illness. Before this just
punishment came upon me, I was a giddy, wicked, thoughtless girl.
But now I would fain hope that I am wiser. Since my dear father's
death you have been more than a father to me; and now, as a wilful
and disobedient daughter, I ask you to forgive me.'</p>

<p>'If I have anything to forgive, Doll,' he cried, 'it goes
without saying that my forgiveness is yours.'</p>

<p>'I do not deserve your kindness,' she said; 'you should punish
me; you should heap reproaches upon me; you ought to spurn me; I am
unworthy even to be in your presence. But I felt that I could not
live without I heard from your own lips that you would forgive
me.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Doll, do not talk like that!' he said. 'Do not speak of
yourself in such a severe manner. At the most you were guilty of
some girlish escapade for which you have been visited with a
punishment all too heavy and dreadful. I know not what that
escapade was. I have waited to learn it from your own lips. But now
I do not want to know. I only want to see you go strong and well
again.'</p>

<p>'John,' she said solemnly, and looking at him with tearful eyes,
'your great good heart would look lightly upon my faults; and even
the hideous sin I was nearly guilty of you speak of as an escapade.
Oh, how you will hate me when you know the truth! How you will
detest me for the deception I have practised towards you! Why did
you not kill me on that night? Why did your bullet not go through
my wicked heart?'</p>

<p>She broke down and wept passionately; and he, to calm the
feeling that was agitating him, and all but wringing tears from his
own eyes, rose and paced the room. Presently she recovered herself,
and in a voice that was broken by 'rifting sobs,' she said:</p>

<p>'The truth must be told. You must hear it, John. Oh, that
dreadful night! I had arranged to go away with Alfred Turner, and
it was he who, like a craven as he is, fled from me when you
fired.' Gyde's face darkened with an expression of fierce anger; he
clenched his fists and bit his lip. 'He persecuted me, John, and
never let me rest. And he found an able ally in Marie Delorme. She
was always urging me to fly with him; she was everlastingly singing
his praises in my ears. When I denied my governess's statements
about the correspondence I was guilty of a base falsehood; but I
was prompted to it by Marie, who carried my letters to Turner and
brought his back to me. On that dreadful night the plot was all
arranged by her. Turner had come up the river in a boat, and it had
been pre-arranged that I was to meet him at one o'clock in the
morning and go away to become his wife. Marie followed me
downstairs. She was to see me out of the house, and the next
morning was to raise the alarm about my flight, and in the course
of time join me and Turner in Paris. That is the pitiable story,
John. I was mad then&mdash;I am sane now. I have outraged my dead
father's memory; I have outraged your hospitality, insulted your
honour, betrayed your trust, but in the most solemn manner I
promise that whatever punishment you like to inflict upon me I will
bear it uncomplainingly, and the rest of my life shall be devoted
to penitence for my heinous sin.'</p>

<p>She was sobbing very bitterly now, and her sobs found an echo in
his breast. It was only with a supreme effort he could say, as
standing before her he took her white soft hand into his own:</p>

<p>'Doll, what you term a "heinous sin," I still look upon as a
girlish escapade, and would never have happened but for the evil
influence of Marie Delorme. Your punishment has been too heavy
already. No further word; no act of mine shall add to it.'</p>

<p>There was a pause&mdash;a long pause. She leaned wearily back in
the chair and silently sobbed; and he, with his back to her, stood
in the bay window gazing across the snow-covered, sunlit country,
but seeing it not, because in his eyes was a blinding mist of
tears. Presently he turned, and walking to her chair he stood
behind it, and as he looked down on the bowed head, he said, with
touching tenderness:</p>

<p>'Doll, circumstances have caused me to alter a resolution I
made, and I venture to ask you now if you remember our interview
last Christmas day in the study?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she faintly murmured, the while she trembled like an
aspen-leaf.</p>

<p>'Oh, Doll,' he cried, with a great passionate sigh, 'may I still
hope to call you some day by the name of wife?' She turned her face
upwards, and murmured:</p>

<p>'John, you are wronging yourself. I am not worthy of you. You
must have a better woman than I.'</p>

<p>In another moment he was kneeling at her feet again. Her face,
wet with streaming tears, was pressed to his, and for the first
time in their lives their lips met in a kiss of passionate love.
That kiss sealed his forgiveness, her sincere penitence.</p>

<p>It was a long time before either of them could speak. Each heart
was too full for words. At last she found her voice. With her arms
locked around his neck, her breath playing on his cheek, she said
softly:</p>

<p>'John, my father speaks again from between dead lips. On that
sorrowful night when he died, and he held me between his knees, he
said, "What I wish to say now and I wish you to ever remember the
words, as words coming from between dead lips, is that I have
appointed my dear companion and faithful friend, John Gyde, your
legal guardian. I know that he will watch over you with tender and
fatherly care; and when you shall be old enough to understand such
things it will give me pleasure now to think that he might even
have the right to shield you as his wife." During my madness I
forgot these words. I will never forget them again. The dead lips
shall never cease to speak to me.'</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Christmas has once more come, and a crowd of people have
assembled to partake of the splendid hospitality of the 'Raven's
Nest,' from which the shadow that had erstwhile rested there had
been lifted, for that morning John Gyde and sweet Dorothy had been
made man and wife in the ivy-covered church on the hill, and never
did woman take for her wedded husband a truer or nobler man than
Dorothy Lindmark took when she became Gyde's wife. All that year he
had tenderly nursed her; wooing her back to health and happiness.
During the summer he had travelled with her in Switzerland, and
when they had returned she was perfectly strong again. The wound in
her neck had quite healed, though an ugly scar remained. Some folks
wondered why John and Dorothy had chosen Christmas day for their
marriage day. They allowed these folks to wonder; but they
themselves knew that Christmas must ever be a memorable time to
them; for it was on a solemn Christmas night that the wish that
they should become man and wife had been expressed 'Between Dead
Lips.'</p>
