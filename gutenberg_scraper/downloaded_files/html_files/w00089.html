<br>
 Change is written on the tide&mdash; <br>
On the forest's leafy pride; <br>
All, where'er the eye can rest, <br>
Show it legibly imprest.

<p>&mdash;Rev. J.H. Clinch.</p>

<p>On the banks of the beautiful Ohio, some five or six miles above the
large and flourishing city of Cincinnati, can be seen the small and
pleasant village of Columbia, once laid out and designed to become the
capital of the great West. This village stands on a beautiful plain,
which stretches away from the Ohio in a north-easterly direction, between
two ridges, for a goodly number of miles, and at the base of what is
termed Bald Hill&mdash; a hill of a conical shape, from the summit
whereof you can command every point of compass, and some of the most
delightful views in the western country.</p>

<p>Standing upon this hill, with your face toward the south, you first
behold, immediately below you, a cluster of dwellings, mostly white, with
their green lawns in front, and their flowery gardens in the rear, with
one or two neat, unostentatious looking churches rising above them, as if
to give a quiet and moral beauty, if we may so express it, to the scene.
Be yond these buildings, which constitute the principal village of
Columbia, the eye at once falls upon an open, variegated and fertile
plain, over which it wanders for something like a mile, to rest again for
a moment upon a few brick and wood-colored houses, half hid amid a grove
of beautiful trees, then upon the smooth, silvery Ohio, which here comes
sweeping past with a graceful bend, and, lastly, upon the green and
romantic looking hills of old Kentucky. Turning to the left, or eastward,
you behold, some mile or two miles distant, a woody ridge, which
intersects the Ohio at right angles, and, stretching away northward,
forms the eastern boundary of the plain. At the base of this ridge, can
be seen, here and there, a quiet farm-house, and portions of the Little
Miami, as it rolls its silvery waters onward through a most delightful
grove, to unite with, and be lost in, the placid bosom of La Belle
Riviere. Between you and the Little Miami, and for many a mile up toward
its source, lies the plain we have mentioned, now divided as far as you
can see, into lots of four or five acres each, all of which, being under
cultivation, present, in the summer season, with their different
products, a pleasing variety of colors, as if to enchain the attention of
the beholder with an unspeakable sensation of delight. Following the
course of the plain away to the north-east, you behold, some few miles
distant, another pleasant village, with its neat, white houses peeping
from among the green foliage of the surrounding trees. Turning again to
the south and west, and following the windings of the Ohio, you can
perceive the village of Fulton along its banks, some two miles away, with
here and there an elegant mansion, all standing out in bold relief
against the green background of a neighboring ridge, and not unfrequently
finding themselves mirrored in the river's placid bosom. A view of the
delightful city of Cincinnati is here cut off by a bend in the ridge and
river; but notwithstanding, the landscape, taken as a whole, is one of
the most pleasing that can be found on the globe.</p>

<p>Such is an outline, only, of the scene which is presented to the
beholder of modern days; but very different was it sixty years ago, when
along the banks of the river and over the plain and hills, instead of the
quiet village and its hum of civilization, and the many pleasant farms
under cultivation, and the farm-houses sending up in graceful wreaths the
smoke of their peaceful fires, there was a vast, unbroken forest,
inhabited by the barbarous, untutored savage, and the thousand wild
beasts of the wilderness. As it is with the early settlement of this
portion of the country we have to do, we must leave the scene as it now
exists, and go back to the period when the hardy pioneer left his
comfortable and well-protected home, to venture hither, and dare all the
dangers and suffer all the privations of frontier life.</p>

<p>As early as November, 1788, a party, consisting of some twenty
persons, conducted by Major Benjamin Stites, landed at the mouth of the
Little Miami, and began a settlement upon the purchase of ten thousand
acres, which the Major had previously made from Judge Symmes. Among this
party were many whose names afterward became noted in history, and whose
descendants still occupy prominent positions in the community whereof
they are citizens. They were the first adventurers into this region of
country, and were a month in advance of the party which landed at, and
erected the first log cabins on, the present site of Cincinnati. On their
arrival, they immediately constructed a log fort, built several cabins or
huts, and then proceeded to lay out the town of Columbia into streets or
lots, on the plain we have described&mdash;believing at the time, that it
would eventually become the great capital of the West.</p>

<p>Beginning at Crawfish Creek, a small stream which was to form the
north-western boundary of the city, ascending the Ohio for more than a
mile, and extending back from the river for three-quarters of a mile,
taking in a portion of what is now called Bald Hill, they laid out the
ground in streets and squares. The residue of the plain, between this
imaginative city and the Little Miami, and for three miles up this
stream, was cut up into lots of four or five acres each, intended for the
support of the town, when it should come to maturity. These lots have
since been divided by trenches, and so remain at the present day; and as
you view them from Bald Hill, one covered with greensward, another with a
crop of wheat, a third with corn, a fourth with oats, and so on, the
whole plain appears like a many-colored carpet of beautiful squares.</p>

<p>The first pioneers of the Miami Bottom were soon joined by others;
and, in the course of a few years, Columbia became quite a flourishing
place, and, for a time, took the lead of its sister towns, Cincinnati and
North Bend&mdash;the last since noted as the residence of General
Harrison. At this period, these three villages, with the exception of
Marietta, higher up the river, were the only white settlements in Ohio;
and as it was more than suspected by the inhabitants of each, that one of
them was destined to become the great emporium of the West, each looked
upon the advancement of its neighbor with a jealous eye, and sought, by
every means, to push itself forward to the grand desideratum. For a time,
Fortune seemed bent on playing her pranks, by now favoring this one, now
that, and so alternately raising and depressing the spirits of each; but,
at last, as the world already knows, she yielded the palm to Cincinnati,
by establishing there a fort and garrison, which rendered it, with its
natural advantages, a place of greater security than either of the
others, and, consequently, a more desirable location for those venturing
into the Western Wilds.</p>

<p>About the period when rivalry between the places named was at its
height&mdash;and when the momentous question was pending, as to which
would be the favored spot of fortune, the Queen City of the
West&mdash;our story opens. Columbia, as we said before, had already made
rapid advances, and taken the lead of her rival sisters, in point of
business and population. Over the broad plain, between Bald Hill and the
Little Miami, were now scattered some forty or fifty log cabins, and at
the southern base of this hill, on a little knoll&mdash;where, at the
present day, can be seen a neat grave-yard, with its marble and
sand-stone slabs recording the names of many who, since then, have gone
to the shadowy realms of death&mdash;stood a rude sanctuary, the first
building erected solely to the worship of God by the pioneers of the
Miami Valley. Around this humble sanctuary was a grove of beautiful
trees, in whose branches a thousand merry songsters, of all hues, sang
blithely. Side by side with this place of worship, on the same knoll,
amid the same delightful grove, was erected a block-house, for the
protection of the inhabitants in the immediate vicinity. Hither, on a
Sabbath morning, when the toil of the week was over, the villagers of
both sexes, and all ages, would repair, to listen to the word of God, as
it fell from the lips of the venerable Stephen Gano (father of the late
General Gano), whose mild, noble, benevolent countenance, his long, white
flowing locks, and his solemn, tremulous voice, as he raised his eyes to
Heaven in supplication, or forcibly pointed out to his hearers the way to
eternal life, made his remarks deep, grand and impressive. And the more
so, it may be, that each felt himself to be in the wilderness, surrounded
by the hostile savage, and knew not at what moment he might be called to
his last account, a victim to the fatal rifle, or the bloody tomahawk and
scalping-knife.</p>

<p>To avoid a surprise and be prepared for any emergency, during the
hours of worship, sentinels were stationed without the walls of the
sanctuary, who, with loaded rifles on their shoulders, paced to and fro
with measured tread, examining minutely every object of a suspicious
character; while those within sat, with their weapons by their sides,
ready, at a moment's warning, a given signal, to rush from the house of
quiet devotion, to the field of blood and slaughter. Not only to church,
but to their places of labor, where they repaired in companies, and, in
fact, on all occasions, the early settlers went armed.</p>

<p>Besides the block-house on the knoll, there were one or two others
nearer the river, and one some half a mile further up the plain, close by
where now winds a broad and beautiful turnpike, and on the site of which
now stands a private dwelling. Bald Hill (now owned by N. Longworth, one
of the wealthiest gentlemen in the country, and by him devoted to the
cultivation of the grape) was, at the period referred to, covered by a
dark, dense forest, where prowled the wild beasts, and not unfrequently
lurked the murderous Indian, seeking his "great revenge" on his more
civilized and less wily foe.</p>

<p>Such, reader, is an outline view of the scene where our story is laid,
and the condition of the country at the time of its opening. Having said
this much of general facts, we shall now proceed to detail.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_3">CHAPTER II.</a></h3>

<p>A lovely being, scarcely formed or molded&mdash;<br>
 A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded.</p>

<p>&mdash;Byron.</p>

<p>Her eyes, her lips, her cheeks, her shape, her features, Seem to be
drawn by Love's own hand.</p>

<p>&mdash;Dryden.<br>
 Strange being he,<br>
Of whom all men did stand in awe; and none<br>
Knew whence he came, nor how, nor whither bound,<br>
Nor cared to question. Strange things he told,<br>
And true&mdash;then disappeared mysteriously. <i>&mdash;Old Play.</i></p>

<p>It was a lovely day in spring, and earth had donned her raiment of
many colors, and seemed smiling to the whispering zephyr that softly
floated over her. The bright sun had already passed the zenith of the
day, yet his oblique rays fell warmly upon the great forest, extending
over the Miami Bottom, and pierced through the foliage, here and there,
down to the earth, and kissed the violet, the rose and the lily, and
danced to and fro to the music of the swaying branches. A thousand
songsters, of all hues&mdash; from the bright red-bird, the black-bird,
the paroquet of green and gold, to the white and plaintive
dove&mdash;flew hither and thither, fluttered among the leaves, and made
the perfumed air heavy with their melody. Here might be seen the bear,
sitting upon his haunches, or lazily crawling off to seek his lair; there
the timid deer, daintily cropping the green herbage, or, startled by some
rude sound, bounding away with an unmatched grace and the speed of the
flying arrow. Underneath the leaves, occasionally, lay coiled the wily
copper-head, ready to strike his victim; and the sound of the
rattle-snake could ever and anon be heard, giving the generous, but if
unheeded, perchance fatal, warning. Here, too, more cunning, more deadly
than all the dread beasts or serpents of the forest, might peradventure
be found the swarthy savage, with his murderous weapons in hand, crawling
stealthily and silently onward, to execute his fell design upon some
innocent and unwary foe of his race.</p>

<p>But for the dangers everywhere lurking in this forest of beauty, it
might have seemed a Paradise indeed, unsurpassed by that primitive Eden,
where man first broke the holy command, and entailed misery upon his
descendants even to the last generation of time.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the peril which surrounded her, which perchance
lay hid behind each bush and beneath each leaf, there was one, a fairy,
beautiful being, who seemed to give no thought to danger, as if her own
fair self were an amulet of safety. She was standing on the bank of the
Little Miami, some two hundred rods above its junction with the Ohio, her
back braced against a tall old Sycamore, her head bent a little forward,
and her eyes, those sparkling orbs of the soul, resting upon the dark
waters rolling slowly onward before her, perchance to catch a glimpse of
her own fair face, perchance to watch the motions of the finny tribe, or
perchance to behold the pictures of light and shade, which the sportive
sunheams, streaming through the rustling leaflets, made upon the glassy
surface of the quivering stream.</p>

<p>Beautiful creature! how shall we describe her? how convey, by the dull
pen, to the optical sense, the etheriality, the reality, the sunny
brightness of the being in form divine before us? We can give the outline
of form&mdash;we can describe the shape of her features, the color of her
hair and eyes&mdash;yet how shall we convey the ever-varying expression
of her countenance&mdash;the buoyant, merry, sympathetic, versatile soul,
which animated, and made to differ from others, the clayey tenement which
it inhabited! We cannot&mdash; we despair of doing it; and yet we will
do, to the extent of our ability, and let the imagination of the reader
supply the deficiency.</p>

<p>Know then, reader, that she whom we have introduced to your notice,
was an angel&mdash;not of heaven, but of earth; not pale and pensive,
with wings upon her shoulders, as we sometimes see the tenants of
paradise represented&mdash;but full of color, life, music, soul&mdash;a
bright being, calculated to adorn the sphere where her lot was cast, and
yet, when done, to "shuffle off the mortal coil," and be equally an
ornament among immortals! Her age was sweet, glowing, imaginative
seventeen; that age of all others in woman, the most peculiar and full of
strange sensations; when she stands timidly, as it were, between two
periods&mdash;girlhood and womanhood&mdash;just pensively looking back
and bidding adieu to the one&mdash;just brightly looking before and
greeting the other: when, if by chance she sees through the rose colored
optics of love, the whole pathway before her seems strewn with bright,
unfading flowers, and every thing appears so new and perfectly beautiful;
and she dreams not that serpents, and thorns, and ashes, and
coffin-palls, lie in her path, to make her weep and mourn, and sigh for
the rest of the grave to which time is bearing her.</p>

<p>Bright, rosy, buoyant seventeen! how many thousands daily look back to
it with a sigh, as they think of the hundred still unexecuted plans laid
out for coming time, and contrast their present conditions with those
they intended to occupy! At seventeen, all is sweet indecision,
uncertainty and inexperience; and life is then to us only an ever-varying
kaleidescope, where every thing we behold&mdash;no matter how we twist
and turn it by pretended reason&mdash;is a beautiful flower; and flower
upon flower, each more bright, lovely and fascinating than the last; and
if we dream of change at all, it is always change for the better.</p>

<p>Happy seventeen, then, was she who stood leaning against the old
sycamore&mdash;God keep her from the cold, stinging, unhappy experience
of many of her sex! In form she was a beauty &mdash; light, slender,
graceful&mdash;full of youthful elasticity and vigor&mdash;with a well
developed bust&mdash;a small, white, plump, dimpled hand, and a foot so
exquisite, it might have rivalled that of the divine Fanny of modern
days. Her features corresponded with her form&mdash;were fine and comely,
and radiant with the glow of health&mdash;but remarkable for nothing save
expression. Had they been chisseled in marble; with the soul absent, they
would not probably have even excited a passing remark; but with the soul
there&mdash;that ever varying soul&mdash;they took the beholder captive
to their charms, drew him forward as the magnet draws the needle, held
him fast as the iron chain the prisoner. The predominant expression of
her countenance was a bright, roguish, girlish smile, which almost
invariably hovered around two as pretty lips as were ever seen, and was a
type of her nature and happy heart. The skin of her features, though
somewhat dark, was smooth and transparent, where every thought seemed to
make a passing impression, as the light breeze upon the still bosom of a
glassy lake. Her cheeks were tinted with the rose, and slightly dimpled;
and her mouth was set with a beautiful row of pearly teeth. Her eyes were
dark and sparkling, full of vivacity and animation, and yet so softened
by long fringy lashes, that it seemed as if she were eternally looking
love. Her hair was a glossy, light brown; and now, when the sunlight fell
upon it (for her hood was held in her left hand), it gave out a bright,
golden hue. On the present occasion, she wore a loose riding dress,
carelessly arranged, which, together with her partially dishevelled hair,
showed that her mind was not entirely occupied with external appearances.
In her right hand she held the bridle rein of a sleek, coal-black steed,
from the saddle of which she had apparently just dismounted; and by her
side, lolling as if from hard running, and occasionally looking up into
her sweet face, crouched a large, Newfoundland dog. For a moment she
stood gazing into the limpid stream, in the position we have described
her, and then giving her head a shake, as if to throw back the ringlets
that had fallen somewhat forward over her eyes, she turned to her canine
companion, and, in a clear, ringing voice, as if addressing an
individual, said:</p>

<p>"So, my Bowler, you think you have had a hard chase, eh? In faith, I
thought Marston's legs would prove too much for you?"</p>

<p>Here she turned, and stepping around the tree, patted the proudly
arched neck of her horse: while the dog arose, and approaching her,
rubbed his head in a familiar manner against her hand.</p>

<p>"Ah, Bowler, dog, you look tired," she continued, stooping down and
playfully caressing the brute; "you can watch, better than keep Marston's
company&mdash;particularly when he is in such fine running trim as now.
Come, Marston," she added, to the beast, "let us away again, for I trust
you are now refreshed;" and as she adjusted her dress, preparatory to
mounting, she struck out in a full, silvery voice, in the following</p>

<p>SONG.</p>

<br>
 "Cheerily, merrily, off we go, <br>
 Over hill and plain with glee, <br>
And the swiftly bounding roe, <br>
 Scarce can keep our company; <br>
Swift, as arrow in its flight, <br>
Speed we with a wild delight. <br>
"Horse and rider, linked in one&mdash; <br>
 Instinct, reason, both cembined&mdash; <br>
This to guide, and that to run, <br>
 How the breezes lag behind! <br>
Cheerily, merrily, off we go, <br>
Swifter than the bounding roe."

<p>"Well sung, pretty Kate Clarendon," said a deep, heavy voice behind
her.</p>

<p>Kate (for the fair being we have described was none other than our
heroine), who was in the act of mounting, started and wheeled around with
a look of alarmed surprise; while the horse pricked up his ears, and the
dog, with a savage growl, sprang in front of his mistress, ready to
defend her with his life.</p>

<p>"Be not alarmed, fair being," continued the strange voice; and at the
same instant, a thick cluster of bushes, growing on the bank of the
stream some ten paces distant, was parted by a large, sunburnt, hairy
hand, and a tall, athletic, singular looking figure emerged therefrom.
Toward him the dog now sprang furiously; but the next moment, and ere he
had gained half way between his mistress and the stranger, he dropped his
tail between his legs, and then wagging it in token of recognition,
trotted up to the other as if to solicit a caress.</p>

<p>The new comer, as we have said, was a singular looking being. In
stature he was tall&mdash;being full six feet&mdash;and in person very
ungainly. His legs and arms, each very long and sinewy, were joined to a
crooked, bony body. He had tremendous breadth of shoulder, from which he
tapered down to his feet, in shape not unlike a wedge. His neck was slim,
but full of large muscles and veins, which seemed to stand out from it
like cords. His head was rather large, even for his body, with features
very coarse, and, to one unacquainted with him, exceedingly repulsive. He
had a big, Roman nose, sallow, sunken cheeks, and a prominent chin,
covered with a thick, coarse, dirty, grizzly beard, which extended down
even to his broad, hard, bronzed bosom, and added, to his otherwise
unpleasing exterior, an almost ferocious look. About his eyes, if indeed
eyes they could be called, he had a remarkable appearance; and a
stranger, at first sight, would have pronounced him totally blind. The
lid of one eye was closed entirely; and that of the other so much so, as
just to leave a dull, lead-colored rim of the lower part of the ball
visible. To add to this disagreeable appearance, the nearly closed lid
quivered continually, like the leaf of the aspen; while the ball of the
eye rolled around in every direction, as if the owner were suffering
mortal agony. Above these lids, across the lower portion of a high, dark,
wrinkled forehead, extended light, shaggy brows; and his hair, which was
also light, coarse and matted, came down to his shoulders. He wore no
hat; but instead, a strip of deerskin, painted white, on which were some
strange devices in black, passed across his brow, and around his head,
giving to him an air of mystery. His costume was as simple as an
Indian's. It consisted of a frock made of deerskin, with the hair
outside, which was worn next his body, reached to his knees, and was
tightened around his waist by a rough belt. To this frock were no
sleeves, and, in consequence, his brawny arms were entirely naked;
neither did it fit close around his neck, but left a large portion of his
breast bare also. On his feet were moccasins, which completed his attire;
and in his belt, instead of the usual weapons of that day, was only a
long knife. Strapped to his back was a rude knapsack, in which he carried
jerk, a blanket, and various implements. In one hand (the nails of which
were very long, and the back of which was thickly covered with hair) he
held a stick of witch-hazel, at one end of which were prongs, not unlike
the tines of a fork. To conclude, the age of this strange personage might
have been forty, or perhaps fifty, so difficult was it to determine by
his rough, weather-beaten countenance. His voice was very deep, a little
inclined to the sepulchral&mdash; and his language, ever good, was often
metaphorical.</p>

<p>Such is a description of the personal appearance of one of the most
remarkable individuals ever known. Who he was, or whence he came, none
could tell. Among the settlers of the early times, he appeared
mysteriously, and as mysteriously disappeared; and as he pretended to be
gifted with second sight, or a sight into futurity, there were not
wanting those superstitious enough to believe him either a supernatural
being, or leagued with the devil. This feeling he took care to foster, by
his acts, such as incantations, strange mutterrings to himself,
occasionally a wild manner, and eccentricities of various kinds. In fact,
it is not to be wondered at, that, in those times, he should excite a
feeling of awe and superstition; for often, when thought far distant,
would he make his appearance among a group of individuals, who had
perchance been conversing of him; and this so suddenly, many times, as
really to alarm them; and then again, ere any one was aware how, as
suddenly disappear. He was sometimes on the pretended search for mines or
money, and not unfrequently did he excite persons to dig for treasures.
He told fortunes, occasionally, and occasionally, too, uttered prophesies
and prophetic warnings. Among the whites he came and went as he chose,
and also among the savages, who respected him as a "great medicine" and
prophet&mdash;to injure whom would be to offend the Great Spirit. By the
latter he was called Kitchochobeka, or Great Medicine; and by the former,
Blind Luther, the Necromancer.</p>

<p>As soon as Kate saw his person in full, she said, with a gay
laugh:</p>

<p>" 'Pon my word, Luther, for once you startled me, for I deemed myself
entirely alone."</p>

<p>"We are never alone, Kate," returned the other, shaking his head
gravely; "the spirits of the dead are always with us."</p>

<p>"O, come, come," rejoined the fair girl, tossing her head gaily,
though not without a perceptible shade of uneasiness in her countenance:
"Come, come, Luther, do not seek to make me superstitious; you can find
plenty of proselytes without me, you know. But tell me&mdash;how long
have you been concealed in you thicket?"</p>

<p>"As long as it would take you to count ten."</p>

<p>"But how got you there so silently?"</p>

<p>"By my will, and the wings of the wind."</p>

<p>"By your will, for one thing, most undoubtedly; but as to the
<i>wings</i> of the <i>wind</i>&mdash;why, I rather think that a joke of
yours&mdash;eh, my conjuror?" and the gay girl closed with a laugh.</p>

<p>"He to whom the future is as an open scroll, legibly written, never
stoops to joke," was the grave reply.</p>

<p>"And do you really pretend to know the future, in sincere
earnest?"</p>

<p>"Do you pretend to know the voice of your own mother, girl?"</p>

<p>"But now," said Kate, in a coaxing, coquettish tone, "be honest,
Luther, for once, now do, and tell me&mdash;have you any faith in
yourself? All in confidence, you know, between you and I; for of course
<i>I</i> will never mention it. O no, I will give you a proud example of
a woman keeping a secret;" and the black eyes of fairy Kate sparkled with
a roguish expression.</p>

<p>"You jest, girl," replied the other, solemnly, and in an offended
tone, "with the great mysteries of nature. Have I faith in myself? Have
you faith in what you behold? Look yonder, and tell me what you see!" and
he pointed with his finger toward the great luminary of the day.</p>

<p>"I behold trees, and leaves, and birds, the sky and sun," answered
Kate, who looked in the direction indicated by the finger of the
other.</p>

<p>"And do you believe the things you nave named really exist?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly I do."</p>

<p>"Why do you so believe?"</p>

<p>"Because I see them."</p>

<p>"And see you nothing more?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of importance."</p>

<p>"I do," rejoined the Necromancer, in a guttural voice, so changed from
the tone in which he had just been conversing, that Kate turned to him
with an involuntary expression of surprise and wonder; which was not
lessened, by observing him standing with his gaze fixed on high, in wrapt
meditation, while every feature seemed expressive of some strange sight,
and his lips moved as if uttering words, though no sound issued from
them.</p>

<p>"And what do you see, strange man?" inquired the maiden, after a
minute's pause, while a thrill of mysterious awe made her blood creep
coldly through her veins.</p>

<p>"A century of futurity, and God permitting man to seize upon the
elements and harness them to his task," answered Luther, in a solemn
tone. "I behold, springing from the earth, only a few miles distant, a
great city. I behold the light and smoke of its fires, and hear the
voices of many thousand inhabitants, and the clink of the hammers of
industry, and see it it gradually spreading itself, enlarging on every
hand, as the eagle when he raises his wings to soar on high. I behold the
dust of the earth put into a great crucible, and lo! it comes forth
another substance. It is seized, and wrought upon, and shapcd like no
living thing that now exists; and yet it is to be a thing of life and
motion, with rolling legs, and speed beyond the speed of the deer,
endurance beyond calculation, and strength exceeding a hundred horse. Its
breath, its vitality, its soul, is vapor; and though it travels with
tearing velocity, through mountains, over streams, hollows and plains,
dragging a thousand times its own weight behind it, yet so gentle is it,
when properly handled, that a child can guide and command it; but once
let it get the upper hand, and the strength of ten thousand men would be
no more to it than a thread to a ship in the gale. I behold, too, the
great timbers of the forest transformed to leviathans, whose vital power
is also vapot, and which, with spoutings that can be heard afar off,
glide swiftly over the bosom of rivers, against wind and tide, and plow
foaming channels in the mighty deep, and carry the sons of earth in their
great bosoms. I behold the red lightning, also, drawn from the
thunder-car of heaven, and sent courier throughout the Christian world. I
behold the great blue vault of heaven turned to an ocean, over which sail
ten thousand ves sels, looking down upon, forests and mountains, that now
to us seem almost impassable barriers. And I behold plague, and famine,
and war, and blood, and fire, and flood, and desolation, and woe, and
crime, stalking apace, by whose dread calls and thunderings, thrones
totter, governments of tyrants are overthrown, and liberty shoots upward,
like a beautiful tree, and spreads its ever-green branches abroad to the
uttermost ends of the earth, beneath which all nations at last repose in
security, and smoke together the calumet of peace. And the vision has
gone from me&mdash;and all is darkness&mdash;and I behold no
more&mdash;for the great seal of obscurity is now set upon my sight."</p>

<p>During this speech of Blind Luther, his countenance was lighted up
with the fires of an enthusiastic soul, until in part it had the sublime
look we conceive the seers to have had of old, when they uttered those
great and mystic truths, which shall descend to all generations; and our
fair heroine gazed upon him in wonder, not unmingled with admiration; for
there was something lofty and elevating in his manner and strange
eloquence. As he concluded, he waved his hand with a majestic gesture,
and then turned suddenly to Kate.</p>

<p>"You think me demented&mdash;or perhaps an idiot; yet what I have just
uttered, is written on the great seal of the nineteenth century. You do
not understand it&mdash;you think me an impostor, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"No, Luther," answered Kate, "not an impostor; but I fear, at times,
you let a wild imagination get the better of your reasoning powers."</p>

<p>"It is seldom," returned Luther, "that I condescend to experiment, in
order to convince frail mortality I am what I pretend; but in the present
instance I shall do so; as it is necessary, for your future welfare, that
you believe in me, and adhere to my instructions. Behold my power!"</p>

<p>As he concluded, he brought the fore-finger of his right hand in front
of his face, and strode slowly toward Kate, who fixed her gaze upon him
in curious wonder. When he had reached within a pace of her, he paused,
fastened his eye upon hers for a moment, and said:</p>

<p>"You are now under the influence of my spirit. You have not power to
move a limb without my consent."</p>

<p>Kate made an effort to move, but found, in truth, she had not the
command of a single muscle. She was like a rock. Not even her eyes could
she turn away from that strange being who stood before her. For the first
time in her life she felt superstitious&mdash;for the first time in her
life she secretly acknowledged a power in man beyond the scope of reason.
As she thought upon it, her blood ran cold, and cold drops of
perspiration stood upon her face and body.</p>

<p>"And now you believe," said the Necromancer, at length, waving his
hand.</p>

<p>"I believe you are a wonderful being," answered the other, with a
shudder.</p>

<p>"Yet fear me not girl; I am your friend. Open me your hand."</p>

<p>Gazing for a few moments into the soft, white palm, which Kate, in
compliance with his request, now extended toward him, he said,
solemnly:</p>

<p>"Eventful destiny is thine&mdash;thou of the sunny locks, fairy form,
and laughing eye!" And he proceeded to chant the following mystical
lines:<br>
 "Where the parent stem is broken,<br>
'Neath the tree that's old and oaken&mdash;<br>
Where the night-wind cool is blowing,<br>
O'er the life-blood warmly flowing&mdash;<br>
By unchanging Fate's decree,<br>
And Almighty Destiny,<br>
One shall stand thou sawest never,<br>
Yet shall see and love forever:<br>
And he unto thy spirit,<br>
Shall a legal right inherit:<br>
Yet moons shall come and wane,<br>
And the harvest leave the plain,<br>
And the earth be green again,<br>
And tribulations sore<br>
Shall befall thee o'er and o'et&mdash;<br>
Ere thy evil all be mated,<br>
And thy web of joy completed.<br>
Come, ye fates, and set the seal,<br>
On what I of ye reveal!"</p>

<p>He paused, and struck the palms of his hands three times together.</p>

<p>"These are strange words, Luther," said Kate, "and I do not understand
them."</p>

<p>"Thou shalt understand all in time," answered the other.</p>

<br>
 "When sorrows dark do weigh thee down, <br>
Thou shalt behold this mystic crown;

<p>[Here he touched the band around his head]</p>

<br>
 "And in the depths of deepest woe, <br>
The mysteries I have told thee, know; <br>
Whate'er thy fortune, nobly bear, <br>
And yield thee never to despair.

<p>"My mission first is ended, and so I leave thee. Farewell!"</p>

<p>He waved his hand, and turned to depart; but just as he did so, Kate
uttered a piercing scream, and wheeling suddenly around, Luther perceived
her features distorted with horror&mdash;for notwithstanding his apparent
blindnes, he could see very distinctly. She was looking upward, at an
angle of sixty degrees; and turning his own gaze in that direction, he
beheld, to his amazement and alarm, the fiery, glaring eyeballs of a
large panther, crouched on a neighboring tree, and just in the act of
springing. There was not a moment to be lost; and catching Kate by the
arm, as though she were an infant, he swung her upon the back of her coal
black steed, and shouted: "Away! away!"</p>

<p>The next moment, horse and rider were bounding over the plain, and man
and beast were closing together for the death struggle; for in his haste
to spring, that his prey might not escape him, the panther had fallen a
little short of Luther, who, dodging quickly around the tree, had thus
time to draw his knife and prepare himself for defense.</p>

<p>As to Kate, knowing that she could render Blind Luther no personal
assistance, she rode swiftly to an open field, some quarter of a mile
distant, where several laborers were at work, to whom she quickly made
known the peril of the Necromancer. Seizing their rifles, which were
always their companions, some five or six hardy fellows started
immediately to the assistance of Blind Luther (whom all knew and
respected), preceded by Kate herself. When they arrived at the spot, to
their astonishment, they found the panther lying dead, but not a single
trace of his opponent.</p>

<p>"He's not here now," said one.</p>

<p>"He's the devil," returned another.</p>

<p>"Wonderful being," observed a third.</p>

<p>Uttering such, and similar remarks, they spent some half an hour in
examining the animal, the ground round about, and then returned to their
labors, more than ever convinced that Blind Luther was something
superhuman.</p>

<p>As for Kate, she explained to the others how Luther had suddenly
appeared to her, and the manner of their separation; but of their
conversation she told nothing; and her thoughts on what she had seen and
heard she kept to herself. As she rode slowly over the plain, however, to
the dwelling of her father, some half a mile distant, a close observer
might have seen a sedateness on her countenance, a sadness in her eye,
that accorded but ill with her naturally light-hearted, merry look.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_4">CHAPTER III.</a></h3>

<br>
 With all that's ours, together let us rise, <br>
Seek brighter plains, and more indulgent skies; <br>
Where fair Ohio rolls her amber tide, <br>
And Nature blossoms in her virgin pride; <br>
Where all that Bounty's hand can form to please, <br>
Shall crown our heavy toils with rural case.

<p>&mdash;David Homphreys.</p>

<p>Misfortune does not always wait on vice, Nor is success the constant
guest of virtue.</p>

<p>&mdash;Havard.</p>

<p>George Clarendon, the father of our fair heroine, was a native of
eastern Pennsylvania, and only son of a gentleman, who, to use the
phrase, was "well to do in the world." At an early age, he was sent to
school in Philadelphia, where he received a good education, and became
acquainted with a merchant's daughter, between whom and himself sprang up
an intimacy, which, in course of time, ripened into an ardent passion,
and was at last productive of a happy marriage. Not having any set
occupation, he entered into partnership with his father-in-law; and for
many years afterward, the firm of Cooly &amp; Clarendon was extensively
known and respected.</p>

<p>During this time, a daughter was added to the family&mdash;the bright,
rosy, mirth-loving Kate, whom we have just described, and on whom both
parents doated fondly, looking upon her as an angel sent from Heaven to
minister to their happiness. Years rolled onward, and all went smoothly;
and of course Kate, who gave promise of making a beautiful and
intelligent woman, was not neglected. As soon as she became of a suitable
age, she was sent to school, and every means possible taken to secure her
a pol ished education&mdash;which she, to her praise be it said, was not
slow to profit by. At the age of fourteen, she returned to her parents.
At fifteen, extensive preparations were being set on foot for giving a
grand party, that she might make her debut in society; but ere the
consummation of this event, the firm of Cooly &amp; Clarendon, to the
utter astonishment of every one, suddenly failed. This was caused by the
failure of a large mercantile house in England, with which our
Philadelphians had a too close business connection.</p>

<p>After having honorably discharged their debts, by other property in
their posession, Clarendon and his partner found they had but little left
them; and the former at once resolved to take what means he had, and set
out for the West forthwith; there to embrace the more sure, if not more
profitable, occupation of agriculture.</p>

<p>Having completed his arrangements, he bid adieu to his friends, and
departed with his family, on a journey of adventure to the frontiers. His
first stopping place was Pittsburgh; but not satisfied with the
appearance of the town, he joined a party descending the river, and
landed at Marietta Still dissatisfied, he joined the party of Major
Stites, and was one of the first who landed at the mouth of the Little
Miami, on the ground we have before described.</p>

<p>About half, or perhaps three-fourths of a mile above the mouth of the
Miami, and a hundred rods west of this stream, was the spot selected by
Clarendon for his residence. Here, soon after his arrival, he erected a
comfortable log-cabin, whither he soon removed his wife and daughter, who
meantime had remained at Marietta.</p>

<p>As must naturally be supposed, it was anything but agreeable to people
brought up in the refined manner of the Clarendons, and used all their
lives to luxury, to be changed so suddenly from their former enjoyments,
to all the rough, rude customs of pioneer life; and from a state of
security and ease, be transported to one of danger and hardship. But they
had counted the cost beforehand, and prepared themselves for the worst;
so that the change proved less severe than it might otherwise have done.
Happiness is not to be found in externals&mdash; it lies within, and
depends altogether upon the mind&mdash;and as the Clarendons, instead of
fretting and complaining of what they could not alter, strove to look
upon everything as happening for the best, and sought to be cheerful and
to cheer each other with words of hope and encouragement, so they soon
found themselves in possession of enjoyments beyond what at first thought
seemed possible for them to obtain.</p>

<p>As for Kate, always light-hearted and merry, she was not slow in
finding means to make life pass gaily and agreeably, even in the wilds of
the frontiers. She was exceedingly fond of the art eques train; and that
she might not be deprived of all the priviliges to which fortune had
hitherto entitled her, her father purchased the steed, on which the
reader has already seen her mounted, and on which it was her delight to
scour the surrounding country, accompanied by the playmate of her youth,
the faithful Bowler.</p>

<p>Kate soon grew to like her new home, and to be the favorite of every
one who knew her. Her frank, cheerful, merry disposition and winning
ways, won the hearts of all; and there was not a man, woman or child, in
the village of Columbia, but spoke of her in the highest terms of praise;
nor one whose face did not grow brighter at her coming. She ever had a
cheerful word and a smile for all, either young or old. She was the belle
of the village, by general acclamation, and yet none were envious.
Whatever Kate did was perfectly right; and as to the young men, the
greatest poltroon of them all would have put his life in jeopardy to
gratify her slightest wish. She was a queen, and reigned supreme; and
though England's sovereign of modern days may possess more power and
splendor, yet Victoria, in the height of her popularity, never had
admirers more ardent, nor subjects more devoted, than had simple Kate
Clarendon.</p>

<p>Our fair heroine had but one fault&mdash;perhaps this was not a fault,
strictly speaking&mdash;but if so, it was a fault of
circumstances&mdash;one of which almost every pretty woman is
guilty&mdash;and one which, if not carried to extremes, is certainly
pardonable: she was, in a measure, a coquette. Among the villagers she
had many admirers, of whom there were three, genteel young men, special
suitors for her hand, at the opening, of our story. For these three, it
was rumored, Kate held a preference over all others; but which one of the
three was most admired by the fair girl, none could tell&mdash;not even
themselves&mdash;for to-day it was apparently this one, and the next day
that, so that each was alternately buoyed up with hope, and depressed by
disappointment. All the gossips contended she had a choice; but the
difficulty lay in finding out the favored one. Whenever Kate was
importuned on the subject herself, she invariably replied with a laugh,
that she liked them all, but that her choice was neither. This, however,
was not believed; and those who strove to keep a record of every event
transpiring in the world of Columbia, were daily on the look-out for the
news of a wedding&mdash;of beholding the merry Kate caught in the noose
Hymenial.</p>

<p>The father of Kate, was a man some forty years of age, large and
well-proportioned, with a noble, manly, handsome countenance, and manners
dignified and pleasing. Among the villagers he was very popular; and
being a man of fine intellect and education, he was looked up to, by
most, with much deference and esteem. His wife was a mild, quiet lady, of
a sweet, benevolent disposition, a few years his junior, who also stood
high in the estimation of the people; so that, among all the villagers,
there was, probably, no family that en joyed a greater share of genuine,
heart-felt popularity, than the Clarendons.</p>

<p>The residence of the Clarendons was a well-constructed double cabin,
with puncheon floors and clap-board roof. Their furuiture, of course, was
of the plainest description; for in those days, and in this section of
country, it was impossible to have other. They had some good clothing,
and a number of small articles of value, which they had brought with them
from the East. The cabin itself stood upon a very slight knoll, and
fronted the west, surrounded by a tall grove of beech, sugar-tree,
locust, &amp;c.&mdash;with the exception of an acre in the rear, that had
been cut away, and the ground turned into a handsome garden of vegetables
and flowers. There seemed but one fault in the whole arrangement; and
that was, that the dweliing was too much exposed&mdash;its nearest
neighbor being at the distance of nearly half a mile. This was remarked
upon by some of the settlers at the time of its erection; but Clarendon
himself declared that he had no apprehension, and the subject was never
again referred to.</p>

<p>Time rolled on smoothly, and the Clarendons, at the date of our story,
found themselves once more in rather prosperous circumstances. But as it
is with Kate we have for the present especially to do, we will return to
her forthwith.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_5">CHAPTER IV.</a></h3>

<br>
 Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike; <br>
And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.

<p>&mdash;Pope.<br>
 There's danger in the dazzling eye,<br>
That wooes thee with its witching smile.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mrs. Osgood.<br>
 But then her face,<br>
So lovely, yet so arch&mdash;so full of mirth,<br>
The overflowing of an innocent heart.</p>

<p>&mdash;Rogers.</p>

<p>Upon the youthful mind of Kate, the words of the Necromancer made a
deep impression; and for several days after their interview, it was
noticed by her friends, with some concern, that, contrary to her usual
manner, she appeared sad, thoughtful, and even abstracted. But as it was
known she had received a severe fright from the panther, the cause was
attributed to this, and every one looked to see it gradually wear off,
and behold her again bright with her own cheerful, happy smile. Wear off
the sadness certainly did; and a week from the event we have chronicled,
Kate appeared the same smiling, joyous being as before.</p>

<p>About this time, the young people of Columbia decided on having a
ball&mdash;which, if it could not rival in splendor some in the older
settlements, might, at least, in heart-felt enjoyment. Accordingly, an
appropriate place was selected, a fiddler engaged, and every preparation
thought necessary for the coming event speedily set on foot. The building
chosen for the purpose, was a new double cabin, which had just been
completed, and only waited this kind of christening, as some of them
termed it, for the young couple, who were to tenant it, to take up their
abode therein. Flowers of all hues, together with sprigs of cedar, were
collected; and the walls and ceiling were decorated with hangings of
green, and with beautiful festoons and boquets. In one apartment a long
table was spread, and covered with such delicacies as the country then
afforded; and many dishes there were (composed of deer, bear and buffalo
meat), which, among us of the present day, would be considered great
rarities. An old banner of stars and stripes (that had been somewhat torn
and riddled in the long and sanguinary struggle of the Revolution, which
belonged to one of the settlers, who had himself carried it in the heat
of battle, and which was held in great veneration by all) was procured
and arched over the door of entrance; and not all the purple and crimson
robes of royalty, could have excited one tithe of the pride in the bosoms
of those simple-minded pioneers, than did this soiled and dirt-begrimmed
bunting of "red, white and blue."</p>

<p>The belle of the ball was, of course, to be our youthful Kate; and as
she was to be escorted thither by one individual only, and as there were
three young men who laid equal claims to the honor of being her
beau-gallant for the occasion, there was, as a natural consequence, some
peculiar sensations excited in the breasts of each, in regard to which
should be the favored one.</p>

<p>Unwilling to take an undue advantage of each other, they met to decide
the matter by themselves. Among other things, one proposed that they
should draw lots for the preference; another, that they should run a race
for it; and the third and last, that they should all go in a body
together, and allow her to make her own selection. This last proposition
was finally agreed to, as the point at issue would, in this way, be
decided by the girl herself; and, consequently, each would know which was
the most favored suitor of the three.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next morning, which was a beautiful one indeed, and
the third preceding the gala night, our three lovers mounted themselves
on fine horses, and together rode over the plain toward the residence of
their fair umpire, to have the pending question decided by her own sweet
lips and voice&mdash;each to be made happy or miserable, as the case
might turn out.</p>

<p>Kate was seated in the door of her cot, gazing upon the lofty old
trees, that threw their deep, cool shadows over the luxuriant earth
beneath, watching the birds that hopped from branch to branch, and
listening to their happy, musical, artless songs, the while humming some
tune herself, in a corresponding strain of melody. At length the tones of
her voice swelled out, rich and clear, in the following</p>

<br>
 SONG. <br>
"Sing, ye warblers, sing! <br>
 Make the forest cheery&mdash; <br>
 Swell your throats, <br>
 With glorious notes, <br>
And let not earth seem dreary. <br>
"Sing, ye warblers, sing! <br>
 To the streams and flowers&mdash; <br>
 In your prime, <br>
 Improve your time, <br>
And golden make the hours. <br>
"Sing, ye warblers, sing! <br>
 God lists your voices&mdash; <br>
 Nature hears, <br>
 Through morning tears, <br>
And in the sound rejoices."

<p>As Kate concluded, she leisurely cast her eyes over the plain, and, as
she did so, an observer might have seen them widen, brighten and twinkle
with an expression of quiet, mischievous satisfaction. Turning to her
mother, who was seated behind her some little distance, within the
cottage, needle-work in hand, she said, gaily:</p>

<p>"I do wonder, mother, whether you and I are going to be taken by
storm, or whether it be me alone."</p>

<p>"Why so, Kate?" inquired Mrs. Clarendon.</p>

<p>"Why, yonder come three gallant gentlemen, all mounted, who
individually honor me with their addresses and words of flattery. One
alone, or one at a time, is enough, Heaven knows!&mdash;but, heigh-ho,
here are three together&mdash;what shall I do?</p>

<p>"Well, Kate, if you would follow my instructions, you would not be
troubled this way," returned the mother of our heroine, reprovingly. "Why
don't you make a selection, and dismiss the others? It does not look well
to see a young lady with too many beaux, I can assure you."</p>

<p>"But which shall I select, dearest mother mine?" asked Kate, with a
roguish smile.</p>

<p>"How should I know! Select the one you esteem the most."</p>

<p>"But suppose they are all alike in my estimation?"</p>

<p>"Why, then, you do not love any, and so discharge them all."</p>

<p>"Discharge them, indeed!" rejoined Kate, laughing. "Why they would all
go mad, and hang or drown themselves&mdash;that is, if I may believe
their assurances&mdash;and then what awful crimes would be laid to my
charge, and what a weight would eternally be on my conscience!"</p>

<p>"Go to, Kate," replied her mother, smiling; "there is no use in trying
to do anything with you, for you turn everything into ridicule. You are a
spoiled child, Kate, I fear."</p>

<p>"Heigh-ho! I fear so, too," rejoined Kate, drawing a long sigh, and
pretending to be very serious, although she could scarcely refrain from a
burst of merriment. "But I say, mother, would I not be worse spoiled
indeed, should I discharge all these gay youths, and have not a single
one left to help myself with? O, would not that be awful!" And Kate
clasped her hands together, with a stage struck air, and rolled her eyes
upward in mock solemnity.</p>

<p>"Have a care, child, or that will be your fate in earnest," said her
mother, her own risible muscles requiring a great effort to keep them
quiet, as she gazed upon her daughter. "Have a care, Kate, or they will
discharge themselves."</p>

<p>"Do you think so, mother? O, wonderful youths! how I envy them such
firmness of decision."</p>

<p>"Many a gay coquette has died an old maid, despised and rejected by
those she once flirted with, and rejected herself," pursued Mrs.
Clarendon. "Better take warning in time daughter mine."</p>

<p>"An old maid!" exclaimed Kate, in mock horror, shaking her head, and
throwing about her sunny curls in wanton profusion. "O, horrible
fate&mdash;horrible! To think of living without a lord to control all
one's actions&mdash;to hold the purse&mdash;to give one grave advice on
the most trifling subjects&mdash;to tell one how to dress&mdash;where one
may go&mdash;when one must stay at home;&mdash;to think of living without
a family to slave for&mdash;to have no one to take care of but one's
self:&mdash;oh! this <i>must</i> be horrible! No, no! I must not think of
such a thing; and as here come my cavalier gallants, I will strive to
secure one, at least, in time to save me from a destiny so awful."</p>

<p>As Kate concluded, the three young men we have alluded to, rode up to
the door, and each made his obeisance, and spoke his morning
salutation.</p>

<p>"Good morning, gentlemen," said Kate, in return. "Really, I know not
what to think of beholding you three together. Are you on a mission of
peace or blood?"</p>

<p>"Peace, most decidedly," answered the foremost, a fine, comely youth
of twenty, with dark, bright eyes, brown curly hair, and an intelligent
countenance. He was the son of a respectable citizen of the village, and
was called Albert Danvers.</p>

<p>"We never enter a lady's company with any other motive," added the
second, a square-built, robust, jolly-faced young man of nineteen, whose
countenance indicated health and happiness. He was also the son of a
settler, and was called Orville Danbury.</p>

<p>The third member of the party was older, more marked in his apperance
than either of the others, and consequently will require a more minute
description. His age was about twenty-three, and his figure slim and
tall. His features were rather effeminate than manly, with a pale, sallow
complexion, and were expressive of habitual thought on gloomy subjects.
He had black, sunken, piercing eyes, a straight, well-formed nose, a
rather pretty mouth, and a round and prominent chin. His lips were thin
and habitually compressed; and when he smiled, which he did but seldom,
and then as if by an effort, there lurked around them an expression both
sensual and sinister. He had little, very little beard&mdash;so that his
face was as smooth almost as a lady's. His forehead was high, but not of
a prepossessing cast, and was marred by deep furrows, as if the mind were
continually employed on some difficult theme. His hair was black and
curly; and what was somewhat rare in that part of the country at that
day, was kept well oiled and brushed. His suit of fine broad-cloth,
neatly fitted to his person, contrasted forcibly with the coarse, loose,
home-made, woolmixed grey of his companions.</p>

<p>The origin of Rashton Moody (so he termed himself) was not definitely
known to any of the villagers. About a year previous to the date of our
story, he made his appearance in Columbia, bearing a pack upon his
shoulder, and with him bringing the implements of a surveyor. As a person
of his profession happened to be wanted at the time, he was immediately
given employment, and had remained in the vicinity ever since. His dress,
occupation, and finished manners, at once made him the beau ideal of all
the young ladies of the village, to whom his slightest expression was an
oracle of wisdom; and in whose pale, thoughtful, half-melancholy
countenance, they saw enough to excite their sympathies, together with a
world of romance; and consequently, of all their imaginings, he was the
hero. But if all fancied him, it was evident that he did not reciprocate;
for after a time, he gradually withdrew his company from all save Kate
Clarendon; and if there chanced to be a gathering where she was not
expected to be present, Rashton Moody was invariably absent. Had Kate not
been a great favorite with all, this marked expression of regard for her
alone, from one so universally popular, must have made her many enemies
among her own sex.</p>

<p>Now, as often happens in such cases, the individual himself, and the
preference shown by him for her company, were less agreeable to Kate,
than they would have been to almost any other unmarried lady in Columbia.
But Kate, as we have said, was a little inclined to be coquettish; so
that whatever might be her real feelings, they were concealed by a
dissemblance that completely deceived all; and, moreover, it was
perfectly natural that one of her turn of mind should feel flattered by
the attentions of a personage so much sought for by others, whether she
cared for him herself or not. Had Kate expressed the real sentiments of
her heart, she would have said that she liked Danvers, could endure
Danbury, but that the company of Moody was really disagreeable to her.
Notwithstanding all this, however, there was, to her, rare sport in
having what she termed three devoted lovers of respectability; and so she
encouraged all collectively, but managed to evade committing herself with
any individually. Her plan was adopted more for her own amusement,
doubtless, than for any other purpose. Her delight was in drawing them on
to a certain point, and then, just as the conversation was becoming
somewhat serious, adroitly turning it by some light remark foreign to the
subject. As she cared less for Moody than either of the others, so she
feared him the more; for there was something about him, that, in spite of
herself, always made her gloomy, and chilled all the warm impulses of her
joyous heart. Could she with propriety have dismissed him, doubtless she
would have done so; but to do this, while receiving the attentions of
others, would have called for an explanation, and she had none suitable
to give. Neither would it do, as she looked upon the matter, to wound his
feelings, by treating him less civilly than his rivals. Thus matters
stood between the various parties, at the time we have chosen to
introduce them to the reader.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir Knight of the Black Armor," said Kate, addressing Moody, in
a tone of innocent raillery, after having waited a sufficient time for
him to begin the conversation, "how is it that your lips are more sealed
than your companions in arms of the Hodden Grey?"</p>

<p>"True love is ever silent," returned Moody, laconically, fixing his
dark, piercing eyes upon Kate, in a manner so earnest, as to draw a blush
to her cheek.</p>

<p>"Nay," said Kate, rallying, "that is not to the point, sirrah! We were
not talking of love."</p>

<p>"Only thinking," observed Moody.</p>

<p>"Nay, sir, I deny that, for myself, I was even thinking of love."</p>

<p>"I cannot say as much for myself," sighed Moody.</p>

<p>"Faith, but you are becoming sentimental," replied Kate, forcing out a
ringing laugh, to cover the embarrassment she felt from a remark so
pointed. "Come, my gallant cavaliers," she added to all, "will you not
dismount, and honor the dwelling of a poor maiden, for a short time?"</p>

<p>"Why, as to that," replied the first speaker, Albert Danvers, "I can
say, for myself, that nothing would be more agreeable to me, were it not
that I think the errand on which we came can be better done as we
sit."</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said Danbury.</p>

<p>"Say on, my noble seniors&mdash;I am all attention," replied Kate.</p>

<p>"As I have been appointed spokesman," said Danvers, "I may as
well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not make any blunders," put in Kate, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, first you must know, fair Miss Clarendon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" interrupted Kate; "no eulogy on the party present. No flattery
to the face, Albert."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you must know, Miss Kate, if you do not already, that a
few nights since, in solemn conclave met, the young people of Columbia
decided on having a ball&mdash;rude, it is true&mdash;but still a
ball&mdash;and the best we can give."</p>

<p>"Hum!&mdash;indeed!&mdash;Well?"</p>

<p>"And at this ball, it was anxiously hoped, and certainly expected,
would be collected all the fair faces of the town."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"In which case, Kate Clarendon could not be absent."</p>

<p>"Hum!&mdash;flattery again."</p>

<p>"Whereupon the query afterward came up, as to which should be the
lucky man, out of a certain three, to escort her thither."</p>

<p>"Which was decided&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, which has not been decided at all, but left to your own fair
self to say."</p>

<p>"How? I do not understand you."</p>

<p>"Why, simply, Miss Kate, you are to choose out of the three before
you, which one you will have for your gallant on the occasion."</p>

<p>"In earnest?"</p>

<p>"Earnest, I assure you."</p>

<p>Kate looked at the three mounted young men, for a moment, seriously,
and then burst into a wild, merry laugh, and clapped her hands with
childish delight.</p>

<p>"Well, if this is not the funniest thing I ever heard of," she
exclaimed: "Three young men, riding off to their lady-love together, to
be piched from as a farmer would select a sheep from his flock for the
slaughter. Well, trot out here, and let me consider.</p>

<p>"First," continued Kate, as if soliloquising, "there is Albert
Danvers&mdash;a good-looking fellow enough, but then he don't know how to
sit his horse properly, keeps his knees too stiff, and is too tall, I
think, and broad in the shoulders, to suit my taste. Then there is
Orville Danbury&mdash;not quite so good-looking as the first, is too
short and clumsy, has a face too big, and laughs too much: I can't take
him. Lastly, here is Rashton Moody&mdash;too tall, too slim, too pale and
sallow, dresses too nice, and don't laugh enough; and when he does laugh,
makes one have the cold chills. He won't do. Gentlemen," concluded Kate,
her dark, sparkling eyes twinkling with merriment, "I have thought the
matter over, seriously, and, 'pon my word, I really don't think I shall
be able to make a choice."</p>

<p>"Then," said Moody, quickly, "allow me to tender my services
alone."</p>

<p>"Why, really, Sir Knight of the Black Armor, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unfair! unfair!" cried Albert and Orville. "Kate must make her own
selection, or we go back as we came&mdash;those are the terms of
agreement."</p>

<p>"Terms, or no terms, I shall do as I think proper," replied Moody,
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Come, come&mdash;no airs here!" returned Danvers, his dark eyes
flashing.</p>

<p>"Do you pretend to dictate to <i>me</i>, sir?" retorted Moody,
angrily.</p>

<p>"Hold, comrades! you are in the presence of a lady," said Danbury.</p>

<p>"And pretend to come on a mission of peace," rejoined Kate. "I thought
you would be at each other's throats soon, when I saw you ride up. Fie!
my cavaliers&mdash;for shame!"</p>

<p>"Your rebuke is just, and you shall hear no more from me of a
quarrelsome nature," replied Danvers. "But come&mdash;will you not make a
choice between us, for your escort to the ball?"</p>

<p>"I <i>fear</i> to choose <i>now</i>, lest I revive the quarrel,"
answered Kate, pointedly.</p>

<p>"I pledge you my honor, that I will abide the decision without a
word," said Danvers.</p>

<p>"And I," said Danbury.</p>

<p>"I shall do as the others," said Moody, sullenly, compressing his
lips, and looking downward.</p>

<p>"I have it!" exclaimed Kategaily, a new idea at the moment striking
her. "I have it! I will decide it by a race. I will have my Marston, and
mount him, and have five rods the start, and he who overtakes me first,
shall be my companion for the ball. What say you, my cavaliers?"</p>

<p>"Agreed!&mdash;agreed!"&mdash;cried Danvers and Danbury, in a
breath.</p>

<p>"I shall take my chance of course," said Moody, drily.</p>

<p>"Mother, where is Icha?" inquired Kate, springing into the house.</p>

<p>"He is at work in the garden, child; but what strange freak have you
got in your head now?"</p>

<p>"A race for a lover," answered Kate, laughing; and darting to the door
in the rear, the next moment her clear voice was heard calling, at the
top of her lungs, the name of Ichabod Longtree.</p>

<p>Presently an answer was returned; and shortly after, the personage
bearing the poetical appellation just mentioned, made his appearance. He
was a tall, gaunt, bony man of thirty, with a long, thin visage, small,
grey, cunning eyes, a large nose and mouth, with teeth projecting, a
falling off, double chin, and, taken as a whole, anything but a beauty.
For many years, while the Clarendons were in good circumstances, he had
served them in the capacity of gardener; and so attached had he become to
the family, particularly to his "little pet," as he was wont to term Kate
that when he was paid off and discharged, he refused to go, and begged,
with tears in his eyes, that he might be allowed to accompany them to the
West. For some time, Clarendon tried to dissuade him from this; but
finding his arguments of no avail, he at last consented, on condition
that he must expect no wages, unless he, Clarendon, again became
prosperous. As affection, not money, was the tie which bound Ichabod
Longtree to the Clarendons, so he, in consequence, made one of the party,
and had remained with them ever since&mdash;employing his time as
gardener, hostler, and an attendantin general upon the ladies.</p>

<p>"Well, Icha," said Kate, as the personage in question made his ap
pearance, "saddle Marston, and bring him to the door. I am off for a
race."</p>

<p>"Yes, and some day you'll jest git your neck broke in a race, my
little pet," returned Ichabod.</p>

<p>"Never you mind my neck, but do as I bid you!"</p>

<p>"O, don't fear me; I'll go straightway;" and off went Ichabod for the
horse.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, the coal-black pony of Kate stood before the door,
arching his proud neck, and pawing the ground, impatient to be off. Kate,
meantime, had thrown on her riding-dress, and in another moment she was
in the saddle.</p>

<p>"Now, my cavaliers," she said, gaily, "square your horses' heads, and
wait the word."</p>

<p>Complying with her request, each put his beast on a line with his
neighbor, while Kate rode out in front, to a suitable distance, and
turning upon her saddle, said:</p>

<p>"Ready, all! Now!"</p>

<p>At the last word, her riding-whip touched the flank of Marston, and
away bounded the fiery beast with great velocity, and forward leaped the
horses of the rivals, in eager chase.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful and novel sight. Erect upon her rushing steed,
motionless as if carved there from marble, sat Kate Clarendon, her
tightened reins held gracefully in her snowy hands, speeding onward
fearlessly, amid the labyrinthian forest, gradually gaining upon her
pursuers, who now, becoming separated from each other, somewhat, by the
difference in the speed of their horses, were spurring and whipping
forward with all their might. On, on they dashed&mdash;startling the
tenants of the wood&mdash;causing the birds to flutter and twitter above
them, or leave what they considered a dangerous vicinity&mdash; while
ever and anon the ringing voice and laugh of Kate, echoing through the
forest, urged on her pursuers almost to desperation. Forward they dashed,
for half an hour, on a circuitous route, when the horse of Moody, being
of exceedingly good bottom, began to distance his rivals, and gradually
gain upon the pony of Kate. This Kate perceived with any thing but
satisfaction, and urged Marston to do his best. In vain, however, did her
noble animal renew all his powers of velocity; in vain fell the whip upon
his flanks; he had met with more than his equal; and steadily the beast
of Moody came bounding forward, every step shortening the distance
between them. At last, Kate, who saw she must soon be overtaken, sought,
by a manoeuver, to turn, pretend to yield, and then suddenly pass Moody,
and by a straight course, gain her home in advance of him, and thus clear
herself; but the design was anticipated&mdash; the effort
failed&mdash;and two minutes after, the hand of Moody was laid upon her
bridlerein.</p>

<p>"I have won!" he said, his black eyes sparkling, and a rather
malicious smile of triumph hovering around his almost white and closely
compressed lips. "I have won, Miss Clarendon&mdash;fairly won."</p>

<p>"You have won, that is certain, whether fairly or not," replied Kate,
pettishly, with a vexed expression on her usually laughing
countenance.</p>

<p>"I have won, by your own proposal, at all events," he repled, rather
coolly, "and of course I shall claim my reward."</p>

<p>"Of course you will <i>claim</i> it," rejoined Kate, pointedly, "and
of course you will <i>get</i> it."</p>

<p>"You seem displeased, Miss Clarendon."</p>

<p>"Hamlet says, `I know not seems,' " answered Kate, drily. "Let us
return."</p>

<p>"Perhaps if one of my rivals had won, you would have been better
suited," observed Moody, fastening his eyes keenly upon his fair
companion.</p>

<p>Kate made no reply; but jerking the rein of her beast rather hastily,
started him into a gallop.</p>

<p>A cloud suddenly came over the face of Moody, and he placed his hands
to his temples, as if in pain. Then dark thoughts could he traced in the
gleam of his eyes, and a cold, sinister smile played around his mouth.
Then muttering&mdash;"If you tread upon a serpent, beware of his fangs!"
He tightened his rein, and, spurring forward, soon overtook Kate, who was
riding in advance. When he reached her side, his countenance had resumed
its usual expression. On their way to the residence of our heroine, they
were joined by the others, who, after passing some few dry
congratulations on the termination of the chase, and perceiving all was
not right, relapsed into silence. The remainder of the way was passed
without a word from either party. At the door of the cottage, each took
leave of Kate, rather ceremoniously, and then departed&mdash; Moody by
himself&mdash;not one of the four pleased with the morning's work.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_6">CHAPTER V.</a></h3>

<br>
 The bright and youthful dancers meet, <br>
With laughing lips and winged feet; <br>
And golden looks come flashing by, <br>
Like sudden sunshine through the sky.

<p>&mdash;Mrs. C. H. W. Esling.<br>
 Do I not in plainest truth tell you,<br>
I do not, nor I cannot love you?</p>

<p>&mdash;Shakspeare<br>
 Repulse upon repulse met ever&mdash;<br>
Yet gives not o'er, though desperate of success.</p>

<p>&mdash;Milton.</p>

<p>At an early hour, on the evening of the ball alluded to in the
preeeding chapter, Rashton Moody, finely mounted, rode up to the door of
the Clarendons. Kate had previously completed her preparations, and in a
few minutes she was mounted on her beast, and bearing him company to the
place appointed. But although she strictly complied with her agreement,
in accompanying him to the ball, yet it was clearly evident to Moody, by
her manner, that his company was not so agreeable to her as he could have
wished. All his efforts to draw her into conversation, only resulted, on
her part, in the utterance of monosyllables; so that, in a short time, he
gave up the attempt in despair; and the remainder of the ride over the
plain was passed in silence&mdash;both occupied with thoughts of their
own&mdash;those of Moody, we fear, not being of the most harmless nature
imaginable.</p>

<p>The ball turned out to be a fine affair&mdash;at least for those
days&mdash; and great hilarity prevailed. Kate, on the present occasion,
however, seemed not herself. She danced, it is true; was lively and even
gay; but those who observed her narrowly&mdash; and there were many who
did, among whom were Danvers and Danbury&mdash;perceived that the
<i>feeling</i> of joyousness, usually so apparent on such occasions, was
sadly wanting. Some, who noticed it, even went so far as to question her
on the subject; but she even replied, with a forced laugh, that her looks
must belie her, as she never felt more cheerful in her life.</p>

<p>Moody, too, was more cold and distant than usual; rarely spoke to any,
and then very briefly; seldom smiled, and altogether seemed in an
ill-humor. But the dance, notwithstanding, went gaily on; the fiddler, to
the best of his ability, "discoursed his eloquent music," and a stranger,
to have seen the sparkling eyes, the rosy cheeks radiant with smiles, and
the bounding forms, as they whirled over the floor, and heard the jests,
and the laugh, and peradventure the gay song, from such as chose not to
be occupied with the "fantastic toe," would have pronounced it a happy
assemblage, without one present who did not <i>feel</i> what all seemed
to enjoy.</p>

<p>Between ten and eleven o'clock the company was invited to partake of
refreshments, and all crowded to the adjoining apartment, where ample
justice was done to the viands before them, and where the same hilarious
feelings continued to prevail. As soon as this was over, Kate announced
her intention of returning immediately. On hearing this, every one looked
surprised, and a dozen crowded around her at once.</p>

<p>"Are you ill?" inquired one.</p>

<p>"Or displeased with the ball?" said another.</p>

<p>"Or grown exceedingly sober of late, and wish to keep good hours?"
added a third.</p>

<p>"None of these, I assure you," answered Kate.</p>

<p>"What is it then?" asked a fourth.</p>

<p>"O, I see through it," cried a fifth, a young man, rubbing his hands
together, in a manner expressive of mirth about to be enjoyed: "I see
through it. She's not been herself the whole evening, and I can guess the
cause."</p>

<p>"Out with it, then," cried one.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell, Kate?" asked the young man, with a leer, and smiling
mischievously.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied our heroine, a little sarcastically; "if you know
anything, tell it, and put these anxious friends out of suspense. Don't
you see they are <i>dying</i> for your knowledge?"</p>

<p>"Yes, let us have it, Charley, do!" put in a merry girl of
sixteen.</p>

<p>"Why, then," said Charley, maling his face long and serious, "you must
know my most worthy friends, that Miss Kate Clarendon, the beautiful
being here before you, has had a quarred with her lover, Mr. Rashton
Moody, and is anxious to make an escape early, in order she may have time
and opportunity to put all to rights again before she sleeps."</p>

<p>A hearty laugh followed this speech, with cries of "Good! good!" "That
is it, for the world!" "Stupid we did not see it before."</p>

<p>The features of Kate flushed, an angry frown came on her brow, her
eyes flashed, and she bit her lips in sheer vexation.</p>

<p>"The gentleman informant," she said, with a touch of severity, "always
was remarkable for his penetration; and I have no doubt he could see
completely through a mill-stone, as we say in the East&mdash; provided,
that is, there were a hole through it eight inches in diameter. For once,
however, allow me, who ought to know, to say, with all deference to his
superior judgment, that he is most decidedly mistaken. Ladies and
gentlemen, I wish you all a happy evening!" and turning upon her heel
abruptly, Kate, with a dignified, but graceful step, moved away, and
disappeared from the apartment. Each of the group looked at each other in
surprise and with a crest-fallen countenance; for not one, by his or her
innocent jest and laugh, had dreamed of giving offense.</p>

<p>Moody, who a little apart had watched the whole proceedings, at once
took an abrupt leave, and hastened after Kate; and presently both were
mounted, and riding over the plain toward the house of the latter.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was very clear, and the bright moon, which had risen an
hour before their departure, shed a soft luster over all, and bathed the
deep forest of the plain in a flood of mellow light&mdash;which, as it
came crinkling through the slightly rustling leaflets overhead, and fell
upon the soft earth like quivering beads of quicksilver, made the scene
superbly enchanting. For some distance nothing was said; and the hollow
trampling of the horses' feet, the snapping of some dry twig, the sighing
of the forest, and the chirp and hum of the thousand night-watchers, were
the only sounds that broke the otherwise death-like stillness. At length
Moody, desirous of starting a conversation, said:</p>

<p>"Somehow, Miss Clarendon, you seem low-spirited to-night, and have
left the party earlier than is your wont. Has anything of importance
transpired to mar your happiness?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say there has," replied Kate, briefly.</p>

<p>"Then why not be gay, as usual?"</p>

<p>"People do not feel at all times alike, and I suppose I have a right
to be serious occasionally."</p>

<p>"O, certainly, Miss Clarendon; no one has a better right. I merely
spoke, because I take a deep interest in your happiness."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir! O, I was not aware of that," answered Kate, in a tone of
provoking coolness.</p>

<p>Moody bit his lips, and moved nervously on his saddle, for he felt
severely the sting of her words. "I am sorry," he said, at length, that
you have not ere this discovered the motive I had in addressing you; and
that, of all others, it should surprise you that I sought your
happiness."</p>

<p>Kate made no reply; and after waiting for one a few moments, Moody
resumed:</p>

<p>"You must have perceived, Miss Clarendon, or at least you should have
been aware, that my attentions to you thus long, have not been attentions
of mere gallantry, but have sprung from deeper and I trust more sacred
feelings."</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth," replied Kate, in the same indifferent tone
she had hitherto used, "I have never troubled myself enough about the
matter to perceive anything the kind."</p>

<p>"What am I to understand from this?"</p>

<p>"Whatever you choose."</p>

<p>Again Moody bit his lips, and remained for a short time silent; during
which he passed an openspot in the forest, where the moon shone full upon
his face, and exhibited features now grown dark and fearful with a
thousand angry thoughts, over which played a bitter, sinister smile.</p>

<p>"If I conjecture rightly," he said at length, "my company must be most
disagreeable to you."</p>

<p>"You might be more in error," was the consoling reply.</p>

<p>"Then wherefore have you silently encouraged me so long? why have you
not made this manifest before?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps there has been no occasion for my doing so."</p>

<p>"I see how it is: you have coquetted me, and led me to make a fool of
myself."</p>

<p>"You are quick-sighted."</p>

<p>"Not uncommonly so, or I should have seen through your base artifice
ere this."</p>

<p>"Sir!" said Kate, angrily, "your language is unbecoming a gentleman;
and if you cannot carry a more civil tongue in your head, I pray you
leave me, and I will find my way home by myself."</p>

<p>"Not so fast, my lady, for I design doing no such thing; and moreover,
my language, which you are pleased to think uncivil, is only in keeping
with your own."</p>

<p>"You wish to quarrel with me, sir!"</p>

<p>"Not at all; I wish to treat you as a lady, if you will allow me to do
so."</p>

<p>"Then why not cease your conversation, and continue silent?"</p>

<p>"Because I do not choose to do so."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Ay, Miss Clarendon, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Then," rejoined Kate, pettishly, "I will allow you the estimable
privilege of conversing with yourself, while <i>I</i> remain a listener
only."</p>

<p>"Nay, but you must talk also," returned Rashton, riding up close to
her side, and laying his hand upon her bridle-rein.</p>

<p>"How, sir! what means this?" cried Kate, indignantly, not without some
alarm, however.</p>

<p>"I said you must talk, also," replied Moody, coolly.</p>

<p>"Ha! you would force me to talk, eh?"</p>

<p>"I simply said you <i>must</i>," answered the young man, with a strong
emphasis on the last word.</p>

<p>"What would you have?" asked Kate, her heart now fluttering with a
strange, undefinable fear.</p>

<p>"I would hold a conversation on what has now become, to me at least, a
grave subject."</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Love."</p>

<p>"I am not in the humor to talk now, on what I do not understand."</p>

<p>"For the matter of that, it is easily comprehended."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, what would you say?"</p>

<p>"That I love you."</p>

<p>"Umph! your actions show it."</p>

<p>"Ay, I agree with you, they do show it, in everything I do. Think you,
if I did not love you, Miss Clarendon, I would have sought your company,
to the exclusion of all other?"</p>

<p>"May be so&mdash;like things are often done."</p>

<p>"Not by one of my nature and temperament."</p>

<p>"As to that, I cannot say; but before the matter goes any further,
allow me to observe, that if you love me, I am sorry for it; as there is
no reciprocity of feeling, and consequently can be no encouragement on my
part given."</p>

<p>"Is this really so?" rejoined Moody, with something like a sigh.</p>

<p>"Really so, I assure you."</p>

<p>"It pains me to hear it, for I had hoped it were otherwise. But tell
me candidly&mdash;do you love another?"</p>

<p>"That I suppose I have a right to keep secret."</p>

<p>"And that, on the same principle, I feel I have a right to know."</p>

<p>"I am not aware, sir, what constitutes your right to any such
knowledge," answered Kate, drily.</p>

<p>"That matters not; but again to the question: Do you, or do you not
love another?"</p>

<p>"I decline answering, sir," replied Kate, haughtily; "but whether I do
or not, understand one thing, I do not, and never can love you."</p>

<p>Again Moody bit his lips, until the blood almost sprang through; and
could Kate have seen the dark, devilish expression on his features then,
she would have trembled with very fear. At length he spoke, but in a
voice so altered and husky, that she started, thinking it was another who
addressed her.</p>

<p>"Weigh well your words, girl," he said, "and beware of their import,
for I am one that cannot be trifled with. If you have trifled with me
thus far&mdash;if you have led me on to hope, without a cause, save to
make an idle jest&mdash;then the consequences rest with yourself."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," said Kate, in some trepidation.</p>

<p>"I am fully aware of that&mdash; neither do you know me. I am not a
foot-ball, maiden, to take quietly the kicks of the world, merely for the
amusement of others. I am&mdash; but I will not say what; you may some
day learn to your sorrow."</p>

<p>"This is strange speech, sir!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is to you&mdash;to me it is simply natural."</p>

<p>"But at what do you aim, Mr. Moody? Am I to understand that you
threaten me?"</p>

<p>"You have said that you do not, and never can, love me."</p>

<p>"I repeat it."</p>

<p>"Then wherefore did you lead me to suppose otherwise?&mdash;wherefore
did you encourage my addresses?"</p>

<p>"I deny that I did. You called upon me at different times&mdash;others
did the same&mdash;and I treated you as I did them, civilly, and nothing
more. You never asked me for my company, my hand, nor my love; and if you
chose to call, it was not my place to tell you to desist, so long as you
behaved yourself as a gentleman. I have yet to be informed, sir, that the
calls of a gentleman upon a lady, are tacit acknowledgements, on her
part, that she desires him above all others, and that, as a matter of
course, she must love him, and yield him a right to inquire into all her
thoughts and actions. You should be aware, sir, that it is the duty of a
<i>lady</i>, to treat with respect those who call upon her, provided they
move in society her equals and behave themselves properly, whether she
secretly admires them or not."</p>

<p>"And to this duty, then, as you call it, I suppose I am indebted for
all the favors I have received at your hands?"</p>

<p>"To nothing else, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Had I known this in time, before my mind was fully set upon
you&mdash;before I had received what I considered secret encouragement
from yourself, that my passion was returned&mdash;it might perhaps have
saved us both a world of trouble. But it is too late now; and, as I said
before, the consequences must rest with yourself. To be plain, Kate
Clarendon, I love you&mdash;love you with a wild, burning, consuming
passion, that, unless I can attain my object, will destroy me."</p>

<p>"But I do not love you, and that should be sufficient to destroy that
passion."</p>

<p>"It is not, though. You may be as cold as marble, and yet my passion
for you will be unabated; in sooth, if anything, methinks its fire would
burn more fiercely, or be smothered for a time, only to burst out in a
terrible, devouring, destructive flame. No, Kate, the die is cast; there
is no alternative&mdash; you must be mine!"</p>

<p>"Never!" cried Kate, energetically.</p>

<p>"Nay, be not too sure of that. I have staked my all upon it, and it is
life or death. You little know the nature of him now by your side, girl.
Sooner than you should escape me, and be another's, I would bury a knife
in your heart, draw it forth, and with the blood still warm upon the
blade, plunge it into my own, and thus perish with you."</p>

<p>"Oh God!" cried Kate, covering her face with her hands; "you chill my
blood with horror."</p>

<p>"I cannot help it. I must let you know the consequences of a refusal.
Be mine, or die!"</p>

<p>"Let us talk no more of this, now," said Kate, shuddering.</p>

<p>"Ay, but now is the time; an opportunity for such conversation may not
soon present itself again, and the moments must be improved as they
pass."</p>

<p>While conversing thus, the two had been riding steadily forward, and,
just at this moment, a glimpse of Kate's residence could be seen through
the trees. Never, to her eyes, had it looked so enchanting as now; so
eager was she to escape from her companion, whose strange, wild language
was well calculated to alarm her. A moving light, flashing through a
window of the cottage, assured Kate that some one was astir; and
instantly she felt her spirits rise, and her courage revive.</p>

<p>"See!" she cried, in something resembling her usually light, silvery
tone; "we are almost back to the race-ground. Yonder light must be
carried by Icha. Poor soul! he always waits up for his little pet, as he
calls me."</p>

<p>"The more reason, then, that we should not be in a hurry," returned
Moody, taking hold of Kate's rein, and stopping both horses.</p>

<p>"How, sir! what means this?" cried Kate, angrily, and in some
alarm.</p>

<p>"It means, girl, that I am determined to improve the present
opportunity, to bind you by solemn oath, to myself."</p>

<p>"Are you mad, sir, to talk thus? Do you think that I am the person to
tamely submit to your insults in this manner? Unhand that rein, sir, or I
will raise an alarm that will bring to me such aid as will chastise you
for your presumption."</p>

<p>"Nay, speak not so haughtily; you are not yet out of my power,"
returned Moody, in a low, determined tone. "If you wish to behold your
friends again, with honor, swear you will be mine, and your road is
free&mdash;otherwise (and he grasped her rein more tightly), you shall
know what a bold man may dare."</p>

<p>"Swear to be yours, I never will," answered Kate, "let the result be
what it may."</p>

<p>"By heavens! then," said Moody, "you see not the inside of yon cottage
again."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he struck both horses with his riding-whip, and, as the
fiery beasts reared under the smart, and attempted to rush forward, he
suddenly wheeled their heads in a direction opposite the cottage, and
would have dashed into the mazes of the great forest, had not Kate
suddenly uttered a prolonged and piercing shriek, and, with the agility
of an accomplished equestrienne, disengaged herself from the saddle, slid
to the ground, and darted away toward the cottage. Perceiving that she
had escaped him, Moody reined in his horse, leaped to the ground himself,
and instantly gave chase. Kate now uttered shriek upon shriek, and sped
forward with all her might; but her dress soon became entangled with the
shrubbery, and in another moment an arm of Moody was thrown around her,
and a hand placed upon her mouth.</p>

<p>"Fiends seize me!" he cried, "if yon escape me now, though all hell
were in pursuit!" and lifting her as though she were an infant, he
instantly sprang back to his horse, and attempted to remount; but the
struggles of Kate, and the uneasiness of his beast, prevented him. By
this time, lights were seen flashing near the cottage, and distant voices
were heard, lending hope to the one and despair to the other.</p>

<p>"Too late, I see," growled Moody; "then there is no alternative;" and
instantly a long, bright blade flashed in the moonlight, above the head
of our heroine.</p>

<p>Kate saw and shrank away from it, with an agonizing shriek; but this
could not save her; she still saw it gleaming&mdash;already was it on its
descent&mdash;and she shut her eyes in horror, and tho't her fate was
sealed. Already was it near her heart&mdash;a second more, and her spirit
would be flown&mdash;when suddenly it was checked by some obstruction,
and the next moment Kate found herself released, and the villain who had
sought her life stretched upon the ground.</p>

<p>She looked up, and, in the dim light which the moon made among the
trees, saw the tall, shadowy form of the Necromancer standing over
her.</p>

<p>"Girl," said the strange being, "thy destiny is not thus to die.
Arise!"</p>

<p>"God bless you, sir!" cried Kate, springing to her feet, and grasping
his rough hand with a warm pressure, while tears of joy started to her
eyes. "God bless you, Luther."</p>

<p>"I did not save thee, girl; it was a Higher Power," said the other,
solemnly; and he raised his bare arm majestically in the moonlight, and
his fore-finger pointed upward.</p>

<p>At this moment Moody gave a groan, and rose into a sitting
posture.</p>

<p>"Villain!" cried Luther, seizing him by the collar, and jerking him to
his feet: "Villain! did I not know that thou wert sent here as a
messenger of evil, to fulfill the decrees of fate, I would crush thee as
a worthless worm!"</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Moody, starting back, and gazing upon the other, for a
moment, while his whole frame shook with fear: "Blind Luther! you here? I
thought you far away."</p>

<p>"I told thee," rejoined the Necromancer, almost fiercely, "it was my
unenviable destiny to be near thy evil deeds&mdash;to follow thee, as the
carrion-eater the wounded wolf."</p>

<p>"This way," said a voice, which Kate instantly recognized to be her
father's; and with a cry of joy, she sprang toward him, and the next
moment was clasped in his arms, while Ichabod, his companion, exclaimed
in alarm:</p>

<p>"Why, darling pet, what's happened?"</p>

<p>"Ay, what means this? and who are those I hear yonder?" inquired her
father, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Kate instantly proceeded to detail what had occurred, in as few words
as possible; but ere she had concluded, her father sprang forward,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Where is the villain?"</p>

<p>Moody would have fled, but for the iron grasp which Luther laid upon
his shoulder, and the imperative command:</p>

<p>"Stay! and behold your victim."</p>

<p>As Clarendon caught sight of Moody, he strode up to him like a madman,
and, seizing him by the collar, smote him on his face several times, with
the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>"Now go, disgraced and worthless dog!" he said, releasing him, "and
tell your friends, if you have any, that you are as far beneath them, as
Hell is beneath Heaven!"</p>

<p>For something like a minute, Moody stood over-powered with rage; his
dark eyes darting forth fiery gleams, like those of an enraged wild
beast; his hands clenched, his teeth grinding together, and white foam
issuing from his lips. Then he started, with a howl of fury, and felt for
his knife, which, fortunately, was not about him. Finding he was foiled
in every way, he turned upon his heel, and shouting hoarsely, "I will be
revenged!" darted out of sight.</p>

<p>"He prophesies and speaks the truth!" said the Necromancer,
solemnly.</p>

<p>"Strange man, I thank you with my whole soul!" said Clarendon,
advancing to Luther and grasping his hand. "You have saved the idol of my
heart&mdash;my more than life."</p>

<p>"Would I could the latter, as the former," replied the Necromancer,
mysteriously.</p>

<p>"What mean you?"</p>

<p>"Full of life and hope thou must, Early seek thy native dust,"</p>

was the no less mysterious answer of Luther.

<p>"I pray you be more lucid in your explanation, if, as I doubt not,
your words hold a meaning," said Clarendon.</p>

<p>"O yes, do, now," said Ichabod, coaxingly, approaching the
fortuneteller; "do, now, tell us what you mean, good Mr. Luther, and I'll
see that you get good fare, as long as you've a mind to stay with us, if
it's to next January."</p>

<p>Luther drew up his form erect, and waving his hand with dignity,
replied:</p>

<br>
 "For whom the scroll is filled and sealed, <br>
The future may not be revealed&mdash; <br>
 Other than that which now you hear: <br>
When the new moon shall be near, <br>
One, whose blood now warmly flows, <br>
Shall in death find stern repose: <br>
When the earth drinks blood and rain, <br>
Some shall see this form again; <br>
Then a child can tell the tale, <br>
Over which now hangs a vail.

<p>"What light is that yonder?" added Luther, pointing toward the
dwelling of Clarendon, as he concluded his mysterious rhymes.</p>

<p>Each looked in the direction indicated, but saw nothing; and turning
round, Clarendon was about to ask the Necromancer what he meant, when, to
his astonishment, he found the latter had disappeared. He called his name
several times, in a loud voice, but no answer was returned. Ichabod,
determined that the Necromancer should not escape without his full quota
of thanks, at once darted into the surrounding bushes, and sought him in
every direction, but in vain.</p>

<p>"I am half inclined to be superstitious myself," said Clarendon. "But
come, darling Kate, let us return on foot by ourselves, while Ichabod
looks after Marston;" and taking the hand of his daughter in his own,
both set off toward the cottage, pondering upon the villainous conduct of
Moody, and the strange appearance, disappearance, and language of the
Necromancer.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_7">CHAPTER VI.</a></h3>

<br>
 The sky grew darker. Soon came booming on <br>
 The deep-voiced thunder, whilst at distance rolled <br>
The wild winds' dirge-like, and yet tempest tone; <br>
 And lightning's evanescent sheets of gold <br>
Burst, in their anger, from the clouds' huge fold.

<p>&mdash;T. D. English.<br>
 Is there a crime<br>
Beneath the roof of Heaven, that stains the soul<br>
Of men with more infernal hue, than damn'd<br>
Assassination?</p>

<p>&mdash;Cibber.</p>

<p>Dead! dead! ay, dead!&mdash;forever dead to those That loved him!</p>

<p>At an early hour on the morning succeeding the night of events just
detailed, Ichabod Longtree, who being in his way something of a gossip,
was stirring betimes, that he might be first with his wonderful news
among the villagers. With a mysterious air, and sundry additions and
embellishments, where he thought them necessary, he told his tale to a
gaping crowd, who, with feelings of indignation too deep for words, at
once proceeeded to the residence of Moody, with the intention of
punishing him according to his deserts. Had they found him, under the
excitement they were then laboring, it is more than propable the affair
would have had a tragical termination; but he was gone, and no one knew
whither, so that pursuit was out of the question. The whole affair
created a great sensation, and was a common topic for several days. As a
story looses nothing by being repeated, particularly when it borders on
the marvelous, so the tale in question, as it went from one to another,
became distorted to a wonderful degree&mdash; until at last an old lady,
in telling it for the twentieth time, ac tually vouched for the truth of
the assertion, that Moody had placed the knife against the heart of Kate,
and was pressing with all his strength upon the handle, without making
the least impression, when a dark cloud suddenly enveloped him, and
Luther appeared in a flame of fire, and seized and bore him off, amid
terrible thunderings, and the most awful shrieks of woe that mortal ear
ever heard.</p>

<p>As for Kate herself, her gay spirits seemed suddenly to have left her.
She grew reserved and silent, and withal, not a little melancholy. In
vain her friends&mdash;who after the events we have detailed, flocked to
see her in numbers&mdash;tried to enliven her by their conversation, and
frequent sallies of wit. She said little to any, and if she smiled at
all, it was one of those wan smiles, which, contrasting as it did so
forcibly with her former ringing laugh, was really painful to observe.
From a laughing, frolicsome, light-hearted girl, she seemed changed to a
serious, thoughtful woman; and all so suddenly, as to make it rather
marvelous. It was evident that something preyed upon her mind, and
depressed her spirits, and many were the conjectures concerning it. Some
hinted that she loved Moody, and that his base actions had destroyed her
confidence in him; and though she had torn him forever from her heart,
yet there had been left an aching void, from which time alone could
relieve her. Others said it was owing to the fright she had received, and
that in a few days she would be herself again. But these were conjectures
only, for Kate kept her secret close locked in her own breast; and when
questioned on the matter, she ever managed to answer in such a way that
none were made the wiser for it.</p>

<p>Thus matters ran along for several weeks, and flowery spring was just
taking leave of the year, to give bright summer her accustomed place and
reign over the advancing golden harvest. Since that eventful night,
Rashton Moody had never been seen nor heard of by any of the villagers;
and the circumstances connected with his disappearance, having been
discussed time and again, were now becoming worn out topics, of but
little interest to any. Luther, too, had not since made his appearance,
and it was doubted by some that he ever would. Danvers and Danbury had
both called upon Kate, separately, some two or three times; but finding
their reception very cold, had at last given up their visits, in despair
of ever being able to win her affections.</p>

<p>It was about this time, say some six weeks from the night of the ball,
that Kate Clarendon and her mother were seated a little apart, in their
own dwelling, engaged upon some coarse sewing. The night&mdash;for it was
an early hour in the evening&mdash; was very dark, and now and then a
flash of lightning, followed by the rumbling sound of distant thunder,
together with a cool damp breeze, which blew steadily from the west,
announced that a shower was fast approaching. For some time mother and
daughter kept silence&mdash;both intently occupied with the work in their
hands&mdash;when a vivid flash of lightning, that seemed to crinkle and
play upon their needles, made them involuntarily start together and utter
exclamations of surprise.</p>

<p>"How near, and how loud!" cried Mrs. Clarendon, alluding to the
lighting, and the thunder which followed with a crashing report
immediately after. "I was not aware that the shower was so near us."</p>

<p>"O, I wish father would come," said Kate; "I always feel so gloomy in
a thunder-storm, and so frightened, too."</p>

<p>"You have no cause for being frightened now, Kate," replied Mrs.
Clarendon, "more than at any other time. We are all in the hands of God,
at all times, and are just as safe, if he so wills it, when the elements
are in dire commotion, as when every thing is clear and tranquil."</p>

<p>"I know it, mother; but at the same time, I cannot avoid feeling more
timid, when I behold dark clouds lowering around me, darting forth their
angry lightnings, and hear the mighty thunders that seem to shake the
earth beneath them, than when all is bright and clear."</p>

<p>"It is natural, my child, that we should feel our danger more
sensibly, when we can see it; but, nevertheless, it is no nearer us at
such times than at others."</p>

<p>"But I wish father would come!" rejoined Kate, rising, and advancing
to the door. "How dark!" she continued, as she gazed forth; "and see yon
cloud! how angry it looks! and how full it is of electricity! Hark!
mother, do you not hear a roaring sound?"</p>

<p>"I do," answered Mrs. Clarendon, approaching the door herself and
listening. "It is the wind and rain coming through the forest.</p>

<p>"How mournfully it wails," sighed Kate, shuddering. "Oh, my blood
feels chilly in my veins. It seems as if somebody were dying, and this
were the funeral dirge. Ha! the lightning again!&mdash;how fearful!"
exclaimed she, starting back, as at the moment a bright flash almost
blinded her, and a crash of thunder, following close, made the cabin
tremble to its center.</p>

<p>"Better stand away from the door, Kate," said the dame, anxiously,
retreating herself.</p>

<p>"I thought," replied Kate, "you just now implied that all times and
places were alike as to danger?"</p>

<p>"I said we should not fear, child, at one time more than another; that
we were all in the hands of a just God, who watches over us; but I did
not say it would be right to needlessly expose ourselves; and it is
dangerous standing in a door, during a severe thunder-storm, from the
tendency of the lightning to follow a current of air. But see&mdash;
yonder!" added Mrs. Clarendon, pointing toward the forest; "methought I
just now saw the figure of a man; perhaps we had better shut and bolt the
door."</p>

<p>"O, it is Icha ' exclaimed Kate, joyfully, as at the moment another
flash revealed to her the tall, ungainly form of the gardener, hurrying
forward with immensely long strides. "Poor Icha is afraid of a drenching,
judging by his movements; but is it not singular that I did not see
father with him!"</p>

<p>"He must be near, though, I think," returned the mother of Kate,
rather uneasily, moving toward the door again herself.</p>

<p>A few large drops of rain now began to patter on the leaves of the
trees, and on the roof of the cabin, while a loud roaring, like that of a
near water-fall, announced the body of the shower to be near at hand. The
next moment Ichabod Longtree came bounding into the room, nearly out of
breath, bearing a rifle on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well, Icha," exclaimed Kate, hurriedly, "where is father?"</p>

<p>"Why, isn't he here?" asked Ichabod, in reply, looking round the
apartment, as if he expected to behold the object of inquiry.</p>

<p>"Did he not go with you?" inquired Mrs. Clarendon, quickly, slightly
turning pale.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," replied the gardener, "we went together, and kept together
till near dark, when he said as how he'd take a deer I'd just then shot,
and start for home. I 'spected to find him here when I come."</p>

<p>"Strange," said Mrs. Clarendon, "that he has not made his appearance.
How long since you parted with him?"</p>

<p>"It's more'n two hours."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed the dame, in alarm; "so long ago, and he not here
yet! How far off was he then?"</p>

<p>"Not more'n half a mile&mdash;jest on t'other side of the Miami."</p>

<p>"I fear something has happened him," said Kate.</p>

<p>"Maybe he gin chase arter another deer, like I did," replied Ichabod,
consolingly." "'Tisn't best to be alarmed, I reckon."</p>

<p>"He would not be likely to do that, I think, so near night," observed
Mrs. Clarendon, in some trepidation. "I fear, with Kate, that something
has happened of a serious nature. Perhaps he has been killed, or captured
by the savages; for I understand one or two have lately been seen
prowling about the vicinity."</p>

<p>"God forbid!" cried Kate, covering her face with her hands; and at the
moment the words of the Necromancer seemed ringing in her ears.</p>

<p>"But where have you been, Ichabod, since you separated from him?"
inquired Mrs. Clarendon.</p>

<p>"Why, ye see, we both on us started out for to hunt some deer,"
answered the gardener, "and a long, dry chase we had on't; for some how
the pesky critters seemed to know we were arter 'em, and so kept out o'
the way. I reckon we went much as five miles up the Miami, and didn't see
one&mdash;though we seed some fresh tracks occasionally&mdash; and so we
concluded we'd give in and come home. When we got most home, say half a
mile off, we somehow stumbled on to one that hadn't kept quite so good
look-out as the rest, and him I shot straightway. This started up
another, that looked liked he might be shot, if a body could get near
enough; and so I told Mr. Clarendon, that if he'd see that home, I'd try
my legs and ammunition for another. He said he would, and off I sot, and
a confounded long chase I had, and didn't catch it at last&mdash;the
scamp of a critter that it was! and when I got started coming home, I
found it gitting right dark. I 'spected he'd be here, and have some on't
cooked when I got here sartin."</p>

<p>By this time the rain was pouring down in torrents, the wind blew a
hurricane, the lightning flashed almost incessantly, and the thunder came
peal upon peal, with terrific and deafening sound.</p>

<p>"Merciful Heaven! he could not live in such a storm as this!"
exclaimed Kate. "Hark! that crash! it was like a falling tree."</p>

<p>"Possibly his burthen may have delayed him, and finding the shower
upon him, he has taken shelter in the hollow of some old sycamore,"
suggested Mrs. Clarendon.</p>

<p>"But you forget, mother," rejoined Kate, "that two long hours have
elapsed since Icha left him; and surely he would have reached home before
this, unless something had happened of a serious nature."</p>

<p>"Soon's this storm's over, I'll start off in sarch," said Ichabod.</p>

<p>"Where is Bowler?" asked Kate, quickly.</p>

<p>"He went with him," replied the gardener.</p>

<p>"Ha! a happy thought strikes me!" exclaimed Kate, with animation. "The
noble brute will obey me above all others; and if he hears my voice, he
will come hither immediately."</p>

<p>Saying this, she stepped to the door and opened it; but the storm was
raging so fiercely, that it was found impossible to make the proposed
trial. For half an hour the wind and rain continued unabated, when the
former gradually began to die away, and the latter to slacken, while the
lightning less vivid, and the thunder more distant, told that the main
force of the shower had passed. It was now that Kate made the trial, by
elevating her voice, and uttering a clear, musical call, that could be
heard echoing far away through the forest. All listened, but heard no
answer. Again she called, but still deep silence followed. The third and
last trial was made, when, to the gratification of each, the well known
yelp of Bowler was heard far away.</p>

<p>"He comes! he comes!" cried Kate and her mother joyfully, in the same
breath.</p>

<p>Another call, and another yelp succeeded&mdash;but much nearer,
showing that the brute was making rapid progress toward them. Presently a
rattling was heard among the bushes near by, and the next moment the
noble animal came bounding forward, shaking the wet from his shaggy hair,
and uttering a mournful howl.</p>

<p>"Where is your master, Bowler?" asked Kate, stooping down to pat his
head.</p>

<p>The dog looked up in her face, as if conscious of what she said, and
then gave vent to a low, mournful whine, that ended at last in a loud,
dismal howl, which made the hearts of each tremble with a strange,
undefinable fear; then springing away, he took the backward track and
disappeared, in spite of the calls of Kate to the contrary.</p>

<p>"Oh, God! I fear the worst," she exclaimed, bursting into tears.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, my little pet&mdash;don't!" began Ichabod, consolingly.
"It al'ays makes me feel age rish to hear you. I'll go straightway and
hunt up your father, for he can't be far off."</p>

<p>"And I will accompany you," cried Kate, seizing her hood and placing
it on her head. "Come, quick, get the lantern, Icha, and let us be
moving!"</p>

<p>"Don't go, Kate," said her mother, uneasily; for it is certainly
imprudent to venture forth in such a night, and after so severe a storm.
Don't go, for it can do no good, and will only delay Ichabod."</p>

<p>"O yes, Katy, pet, don't go now!" added Ichabod, coaxingly, "and as
your mother says, 'tisn't prudent."</p>

<p>Kate, however, was used to hav ing her own way, whenever she insisted
on it; and as, in the present instance, she had resolved on going, so all
that was said to the contrary was said in vain.</p>

<p>"Come, Icha, quick now, and get ready!" was her only reply; and in a
few minutes she was gliding through the wood, close upon the heels of her
serving man, who bore in one hand a rifle, and in the other a lighted
lantern.</p>

<p>The course of our friends from the cottage was nearly due east; and
after continuing for some time without speaking, through thick tangles of
brush, that saturated them as they passed, and over large fallen trees,
that had been uprooted, or broken and cast down by the storm&mdash;they
reached the Miami, whose now dark, swollen and turbulent waters came
rushing past with a cheerless, gloomy sound, which struck upon the ear
like the hollow rattling of earth upon a coffin. Luckily a small canoe,
kept here for fording the stream when the water was high, was found hid
among the bushes on the western bank. Placing this upon the stream,
Ichabod, after vainly trying to persuade Kate to remain or return, as
sisted her into it, and shoved across&mdash; not, however, without some
risk, as the current, being strong, rapidly bore them down several yards,
before they were able to effect a landing. Reaching the other bank at
length in safety, Kate gave another call to Bowler, which, to her
gratification, was almost immediately answered. A minute after, the dog
came bounding up to her, whining piteously, and then immediately darted
away, and up the hill, which here rose somewhat steep above her.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" exclaimed Kate, clasping her hands in an agony of mind
almost unbearable, "I know the worst has happened! God give me strength
to go through with it!"</p>

<p>"Let us forward," returned her companion, in a voice slightly
faltering; and taking Kate by the hand, he began to ascend the hill at a
fast gait.</p>

<p>They had proceeded about a hundred yards further, when they heard a
deep groan, which made the blood of both run coldly through their veins;
and Kate placing her hands upon her heart, to still its wild throbbings,
felt a sickening dizziness come over her, that almost took away the power
of motion.</p>

<p>"I can go no further," she gasped, faintly; "I can scarcely
stand."</p>

<p>"Courage, darling," whispered Ichabod.</p>

<p>"Help!" cried a voice just above them; "for the love of mercy, if you
are friends, hurry forward!"</p>

<p>"Who be you, and what's the matter?" exclaimed Ichabod, springing up
the steep, and dragging Kate after him, more dead than alive.</p>

<p>"Who I am, matters not, save that I am friendly to the right,"
answered the strange voice; and the next moment, the light carried by
Ichabod flashed upon the comely form and face of a young man of
twenty-three, who was standing alone, rifle in hand, upon a huge rock,
not ten feet above their heads, his handsome figure clearly set off
against the dark background beyond. "There has been foul play here," he
added, solemnly.</p>

<p>"Where? where?" cried Ichabod.</p>

<p>"Just above me," answered the stranger, springing into a thicket of
bushes close behind him.</p>

<p>Ichabod quickly gained the thicket, entered it with Kate, and the next
moment he stood beside a tall, old oak, and saw the stranger upon his
knees, bending over some dark object on the ground, and the dog running
to and fro, and whining mournfully. Approaching with the light, Ichabod
placed it in a position to reveal a horrid spectacle. As he did so, Kate
uttered a loud shriek, and sank down insensible.</p>

<p>"A woman!" exclaimed the stranger, springing to his feet, with a look
of surprise; for Kate had kept so much in the shade, that, until now, he
had not been aware of the presence of one of the opposite sex. "God of
Heaven! what a shock for a woman!" he added, stooping down and raising
her in his arms&mdash;for under the excitement of the moment, Ichabod
thought of nothing, saw nothing, but the object before him.</p>

<p>A sight for a woman indeed! and more, a sight for an affectionate
daughter! Upon the ground, his back partly supported by the tree before
mentioned, lay the father of Kate, his features pale and ghastly, save
where they were rendered more frightful by being spotted with blood. In
his breast was a deep wound, and another in his abdomen, from both of
which the red current of life was flowing freely, and his vestments were
already stained to a frightful extent. Either wound was mortal, and yet
Clarendon still survived; though a few gasps, a groan now and then, and a
rattling, choking sound in his throat, betokened the rapid approach of
death.</p>

<p>"May perdition seize the fiend that's done this!" cried Ichabod,
bending over the prostrate form of Clarendon, and bursting into tears.
"Speak to me, Mr. Clarendon, my good old friend&mdash;speak to me, and
tell me who did it!"</p>

<p>A groan was the only answer.</p>

<p>"It might ha' been you, sir," for all I know, cried Ichabod, abruptly,
starting up and turning to the stranger, who was now engaged in restoring
Kate to consciousness.</p>

<p>"Had I done it, think you I would be here now?" returned the other,
sharply, an angry flush mantling his fine, noble countenance.</p>

<p>"How comes ye here at all, then?" asked Ichabod, not well pleased with
the other's answer.</p>

<p>"That I will explain to your satisfaction some other time," was the
reply. "Look you, now, and see if it be possible to save the wounded
man!"</p>

<p>There was a certain lofty superiority in the tone and manner of the
speaker, a something which spoke one accustomed to command and be obeyed,
that completely over-awed Ichabod, and dispelled his doubts regarding
him; and he turned at once to Clarendon, to see if it were possible to
save him. As he bent down to examine his wounds and staunch the blood,
his eye fell upon a piece of white paper, pinned upon his body, on which
was writing in a legible hand; at the same moment the wounded man gave a
groan, a gasp, and all was over. Tearing the paper from his body,
Ichabod, unable to read, handed it to the stranger, saying:</p>

<p>"Here's something, that maybe you can tell what it means."</p>

<p>"By heavens! it is a clue to the mystery!" exclaimed the other, as his
eye fell upon the letters; and he read:</p>

<p>"`<i>So shall perish all my enemies! Wo to them that bear the name of
the dead!</i></p>

Rashton Moody.' "

<p>"The damnable villain!" ejaculated Ichabod, catching up his rifle,
which was leaning against the oak. "I'm his sowrn foe, straightway, to
death; and if we ever do meet, which Heaven grant, by all my hopes of
justice, I'll kill him if I can!"</p>

<p>"Rightly spoken, sir, for a bold man. Henceforth I am your friend.
Give me your hand!" and the next moment the hand of Ichabod was clasped
in that of the stranger.</p>

<p>During this time, the stranger hadbeen supporting Kate with his left
arm, and chafing her temples with his right hand; and he now had the
satisfaction of seeing her gradually revive. At length she opened her
eyes, gazed around her with a bewildered air, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Where am I? and who are you, sir?"</p>

<p>"You are safe, fair lady," answered the stranger, in a mild, soothing
tone, very different from the one in which he had addressed Ichabod. "You
are safe, maiden, and in the hands of one who would suffer death sooner
than see harm befall you."</p>

<p>"I do believe he says true, darling," observed the gardener.</p>

<p>"Ha! Icha!" cried Kate, wildly, her conciousness fairly regained; "I
remember now&mdash;my father&mdash; where&mdash;what&mdash;oh, God!" and
she buried her face in her hands, and her form shook convulsively.</p>

<p>"Be calm, fair maiden," said the stranger, tenderly; "be tranquil I
pray you."</p>

<p>Kate made a sudden bound, sprang from his arms, and, ere she could be
prevented, threw herself upon the corpse of her father.</p>

<p>"Oh, father," she exclaimed, in tones of anguish, "father&mdash;speak
to your Kate!&mdash;speak to me!&mdash; What! no answer!&mdash;he never
refused to answer me before. Great God! I have it now!&mdash;he is dead!
Yes, dead! dead! dead!" she shrieked, wildly. Then she burst into tears
and lamentations, while Ichabod stood and gazed upon her like one
stultified, and the stranger, placing his hands to his eyes, brushed away
a tear.</p>

<p>"I have seen some hard scenes," he said, "but none that moved me like
this. She must be removed," he added, touching Ichabod on the shoulder.
"Gently, my worthy friend, let us remove her."</p>

<p>Ichabod drew a long sigh, that seemed like a gasp, and signified his
assent to the stranger's proposition by simply nodding his head.</p>

<p>"Come, Kate, my darling pet," he said, stooping down to her, "let's
return, and I'll see to having your father taken care on."</p>

<p>"Yes, lady, do!" urged the stranger; "and I pledge you my honor, as a
gentleman, that whatever can be done, shall be done, to your
satisfaction, in all that pertains to this unfortunate affair."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, sir," answered Kate, rising slowly to her feet,
and, by a master effort, commanding her feelings so as to speak somewhat
calmly; "and I feel confident, from your look and voice, that you can be
trusted fully. You will pardon me, I trust, for my wild manner. The loss
of a father, and one so affectionate (here the voice of Kate died away to
a whisper, and she placed her hand to her throat as if to prevent
strangulation), and&mdash;and&mdash;by foul means too&mdash;is no light
affair."</p>

<p>"It is terrible!" rejoined the stranger, with emotion; "and God, who
sees the hearts of all, knows that I sympathize with you and yours most
deeply; and could I, by any sacrifice, ease you, fair lady, of a single
pang, that sacrifice should be freely made."</p>

<p>"Tell&mdash;me&mdash;truly;&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;is dead&mdash;is
he&mdash;he not?" gasped Kate.</p>

<p>The stranger bent over, felt of the corpse in several places, and
answered sadly:</p>

<p>"I fear he is."</p>

<p>For a moment Kate stood with her hands to her eyes, while her whole
form shook fearfully; then withdrawing them, she said:</p>

<p>"I will endeavor to be more calm. If you will bear the body of my
father to the cottage, I will go before with the light."</p>

<p>A look of surprise and admiration lighted up the countenance of the
stranger, and he said, as if to himself:</p>

<p>"She who can so command herself on an occasion like this&mdash;show so
much nerve&mdash;can be no ordinary being. Lady," he added to Kate,
respectfully, "your request shall be obeyed. Come, my friend," he
continued, touching Ichabod, who was now standing with his hands locked
behind him, his chin dropped upon his bosom, his eyes fastened upon the
dead, and apparently heeding nothing that had been spoken since his own
remarks to Kate: "Come, my friend, let us tarry here no longer. I will
assist you in carrying the corpse down to the dwelling of this fair
lady."</p>

<p>In a few minutes a rough kind of litter was prepared, on which having
laid the mortal remains of George Clarendon, Ichabod and the stranger,
preceded by Kate, bore it slowly forward down the descent. Reaching the
Miami, the party entered the canoe, and paddled across in safety. As they
were about raising the litter to proceed again, the dog, which had kept
them company, uttered a low growl, and, at the same moment, a deep voice
was heard chanting:<br>
 "Where the parent stem is broken,<br>
'Neath the tree that's old and oaken&mdash;<br>
When the night-wind cool is blowing,<br>
O'er the life-blood warmly flowing&mdash;<br>
 By unchanging Fate's decree,<br>
And Almighty Destiny,<br>
One shall stand thou sawest never,<br>
Yet shalt see and love forever."</p>

<p>"Who speaks thus?" inquired the stranger, drawing a pistol, and
preparing to rush into the thicket.</p>

<p>"One who knows both thee and the future," answered Blind Luther the
Necromancer, stepping forth from his covert.</p>

<p>"I know not you," returned the other, haughtily, "nor why you appear
here at such a time, chanting such mystic words. A foul murder has just
been done, and I feel myself called upon to arrest all suspicious persons
found in the vicinity. Pardon me, sir, if I now arrest you, in the name
of the general commonwealth of these United States." As he spoke, the
stranger threw off an oil-skin coat, and displayed the uniform of a
military officer. Then drawing a sword from his side, he laid the blade
upon the shoulder of Luther, and added: "You are my prisoner."</p>

<p>So sudden and singular was this last proceeding, that Kate and Ichabod
remained for a moment silent, when the former found her voice and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Harm him not, sir, I pray you! We know him, and that he is as
innocent as ourselves. Luther," she added to him, "I fear thou art a bird
of evil omen. Behold!" and she pointed to the dead.</p>

<p>"I am a messenger of truth," replied Luther; "and yet I deeply
sympathize with you, and regret the decrees of fate. I saved your life,
and might his, had it been so ordained." Then turning to the young
officer, who, meantime, had sheathed his sword, he continued, in a tone
of superiority: "Boy, you might as well arrest the wind! Think you I
would go with you against my will? No, Ernest Clifton, you have mistaken
him who addresses you."</p>

<p>"Ha!" ejaculated the officer "you know me then?"</p>

<p>"You! ay&mdash;and your parents before you."</p>

<p>"My parents? heavens! Who are you, pray?"</p>

<p>"Ask your friends."</p>

<p>Clifton turned inquiringly to Kate.</p>

<p>"We know him as Blind Luther, the Necromancer," she answered.</p>

<p>"I know no such person," rejoined Ernest.</p>

<p>"Do you know yourself?" asked Luther.</p>

<p>A flush mantled the cheeks of the young officer as he replied:</p>

<p>"You ask a strange question, sir."</p>

<p>"Which I will answer for you in the negative," said Luther. "You know
neither yourself nor your parents."</p>

<p>"Do you wish to insult me?" cried the other, reddening and somewhat
confused.</p>

<p>"I wish to insult no man. But enough! you shall know more in time."
Then turning to Kate, he continued: "As I told thee before, fair
damsel,</p>

<p>"When sorrows dark do weigh thee down, Thou shalt behold this mystic
crown;</p>

<p>[Here he touched the band around his head.]</p>

<br>
 "And in the depths of deepest woe, <br>
The mysteries I have told thee, know; <br>
Whate'er thy fortune, nobly bear, <br>
And yield thee never to despair.

<p>"Again I told thee," continued the Necromancer,</p>

<p>"When the new moon shall be near, One whose blood now warmly flows,
Shall in death find stern repose&mdash;</p>

<p>[Here he pointed to the corpse.]</p>

<p>When the earth drinks blood and rain, Some shall see this form
again&mdash;</p>

<p>[Here he smote his breast.]</p>

<p>Then a child can tell the tale, Over which now hangs a vail.</p>

<p>"Behold so much of my prophesy, and await the revealings of the great
future. We shall all meet again,</p>

<p>"When dark storms around us lower, Or bright sunshine rules the
hour.</p>

<p>"Farewell!" and as he concluded speaking, Luther sprang into the
thicket and disappeared.</p>

<p>"A strange, eccentric being," observed young Clifton, as if to
himself. Then motioning Ichabod to assist him, he bent down to raise the
corpse. The rest of the way to the cottage of the deceased was passed in
silence.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_8">CHAPTER VII.</a></h3>

<br>
 The blight of hope and happiness <br>
 Is felt when fond ones part, <br>
And the bitter tear that follows, is <br>
 The life-blood of the heart.

<p>&mdash;Fitz-Green Halleok.</p>

<p>We thank you, friends, that you have buried our dead forever from our
sight.</p>

 <i>&mdash;The Buria</i>

<p>It is needless for us to describe, or even attempt to describe, the
scene which followed the awful announcement to Mrs. Clarendon, that her
well-beloved partner for life was no more&mdash;or when, too, nearly
frantic with the news, she rushed to him and beheld him all gory with the
generous blood that had so lately warmed his veins. And even did we
describe it, what benefit would accrue to the reader? Who could realize
the heart-rending agony, but such as have been placed in similar
circumstances; and for such, no description is needed; for all potent and
poignant memory will too forcibly recall the eventful past. Suffice, that
she was nigh distracted with grief, and, for several hours, manifested
strong symptoms of confirmed insanity.</p>

<p>The day following, nearly all the villagers, who received the news at
an early hour in the morning, flocked to the house of mourning, to behold
the deceased, and condole with the living.</p>

<p>As Clarendon came to his death in a manner so singular, it was judged
expedient to hold an inquest over the body. For this purpose, a jury was
speedily collected, consisting of twelve persons, among whom were two
physicians, who at once proceeded to examine the body minutely, and who
gave it as their opinion, that the deceased came to his death by reason
of gashes made by a knife upon his breast and abdomen. Ernest Clifton,
the young officer, who had remained over night at the cottage, was next
called upon to state what he knew in regard to the affair, and how he
came to be found with the deceased, so far from any habitation, alone, at
such a time of night, and under circumstances so calculated to render him
an object of suspicion.</p>

<p>The jury had now formed a circle around the deceased, in the adjoining
apartment or cabin, and as the spokesman concluded, each turned his face
toward Ernest, who, with some five or six other spectators, was standing
just without the ring. On hearing the question put, he started, a deep
flush mantled his features, and without ado, he stepped boldly within the
circle, and with one hand gently touched the dead. He was a noble-looking
young man, nearly six feet in height, with handsome proportions, that
lost nothing of their beauty in being set off by his close-fitting
uniform. His features were comely and very expressive; and there was a
nobility in his high, broad forehead, surmounted by dark brown curls, and
in his full black eyes, which forbade the idea that he could be guilty of
a mean or base action.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said, calmly, and with dignity, moving his eyes slowly
around the circle, and resting them for a moment on each member:
"Gentlemen, you have heard me called upon to state what I know in regard
to this unfortunate affair, in a manner calculated to leave upon your
minds the impression that my knowledge was not honestly and honorably
gained. What object the speaker had in addressing me in the way he did, I
know not, but shall call upon him to explain hereafter; and I trust his
answer will be satisfactory: otherwise (here he gracefully and lightly
touched the hilt of his sword with his right hand, and fixed his eyes
steadily upon the one alluded to, who quailed before his glance), there
is, thank fortune! an honorable way of settling all matters of a similar
nature.</p>

<p>"I shall now proceed," he continued, "to state the facts, briefly as
possible. In the first place, as you will perceive by my uniform, I am in
the service of the Government. I hold a lieutenant's commission, and am
quartered at Cincinnati. Some few nights since, word was brought to my
commanding officer, that a body of Indians was prowling about the
vicinity, and that, unless they were seen to in time, serious results
would be likely to follow. Upon this, I was immediately ordered to head a
detachment of ten picked men, and scour the surrounding country, and if I
found no Indians, to divide and send my men out separately as scouts. To
make a long story short, my men were sent out in every direction, one
after another, until I was left entirely alone. Yesterday, while scouting
myself, I reached and crossed the Little Miami, and was on my return last
evening to the garrison, when, finding myself belated, and that a severe
storm was approaching, I ascended a tree to await the appearance of a
clear sky. While in the tree, I several times fancied I heard a groan,
but thought I had most probably mistaken the wailings of the storm, which
was then raging with fury, for a human voice. When the storm began to die
away, I descended to the ground, for the purpose of resuming my journey.
Scarcely had I done so, when I heard the mournful howl of a dog near by.
Thinking there must be something wrong, I hastened in the direction
whence the noise proceeded. I had not gone far, when I heard a distant
call. Immediately after, the dog, with a yelp, bounded away. At the same
moment, a deep groan sounded in my ear; and pressing forward, I was not
long in finding the cause in the person of the deceased, who was lying
upon his side, under a large tree, and bleeding profusely from a couple
of wounds, located as you perceive. I questioned him as to what had
occurred, but he was too far gone to answer. I endeavored to staunch the
blood, but did not succeed in doing much good. In a few minutes the dog
returned; and shortly after, I saw a light in the distance, apparently
moving toward me. Steadily the light approached, and at length I espied a
couple of figures with it. From my position, I was afterward enabled to
keep them in view, until near enough to make them hear my voice, when I
urged them to hasten forward, while I at once sprang back to the
deceased. While bending over the wounded man, I heard a shriek, and
looking around, was surprised to find a beautiful female near me, on the
ground, in a swooning state. I hastened to raise her in my arms, and
while engaged in restoring her to consciousness, the unfortunate man
breathed his last. On his breast was found this paper, which having
perused, and taken the testimony of Miss Clarendon and her serving-man, I
trust, gentlemen, you will fully exonerate me from even a suspicion of
being in any manner concerned in the death of him now lying before
you."</p>

<p>As Clifton concluded, he presented to the foreman of the jury the
paper alluded to, which the reader will recollect as the one bearing the
signature of Rashton Moody. No little excitement was created on reading
this, for all knew Moody well, and also the cause of quarrel between him
and Clarendon. Kate and Ichabod were called and examined separately; but
as their testimony only corroborated Clifton's, the matter was soon
decided, and the verdict rendered&mdash;That George Clarendon came to his
death by means of a knife, or some other sharp instrument, in the hands
of Rashton Moody, whom the jury in consequence considers guilty of murder
in the first degree.</p>

<p>The funeral of Clarendon took place on the following day, and was
attended by a large concourse of citizens, of both sexes, all of whom
appeared to sympathize deeply with the afflicted family. The funeral
service was uncommonly solemn and impressive, and when the speaker
concluded, scarcely a dry eye could be found in the whole assemblage. A
long procession attended the corpse to its last earthly resting place,
which was the quiet little graveyard covering the knoll, where stood the
sanctuary, of which mention was made in the opening chapter of this
history.</p>

<p>As the soft earth fell with a hollow, rattling sound upon the coffin,
assuring the living that the last parting between them and the dead had
really taken place, not a dry eye could be found among the group that now
stood around the open grave. As for Kate and her mother, their sobs and
lamentations were truly heart-rending; and it almost required force to
remove them from the "narrow house appointed for all living."</p>

<p>Ernest Clifton, from one cause or another, had not yet taken his
departure; and a stranger to have seen him at the funeral, and at the
grave of Clarendon, would have pronounced him one of the chief
mourners&mdash;so pale were his features, and so sad in expression. As
Kate and her mother quitted the grave, he held their horses, assisted
them to mount, and then, with Ichabod, kept them company on foot, as they
slowly took their way to their now desolate home. Here, after partaking
some refreshment, he said:</p>

<p>"Friends&mdash;for I claim the privilege of calling you by that
endearing term&mdash;our first meeting and acquaintance has been made
under strange and heart-rending circumstances&mdash; such as I trust it
may never be our lot to witness again. To say that I deeply, from my
heart, sympathize with you in your affliction, would be to repeat in
words what my actions have already spoken. Duty now calls me away; and I
fear I have intruded too long already; for whatever might have been my
feelings, I should have remembered that I was a stranger, and therefore
had no right to press my sympathies upon your notice. And if in doing so
I have, in your view of the matter, overstepped the bounds of propriety,
I trust you will fully acquit me, on the ground that all was meant for
the best."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you think it necessary to make apologies, Mr. Clifton,"
answered Mrs. Clarendon, while Kate looked up at the young officer with
tearful eyes; "for I assure you, we feel deeply our obligations to you,
for the kindness manifested in this awful, soul-rending calamity, and
sincerely regret that the time has come for you to leave us. It is true
we have known you only a short period; but there are times when the
friendship of an hour bears with it the weight of a lifetime; and such, I
assure you, is yours. That you are a stranger, comparatively speaking, I
know; and yet, somehow, it seems as if I had known you for years; and I
hope, sincerely, that though duty now calls you away, you will not
altogether neglect the house of the widow and orphan."</p>

<p>"I shall be too happy in the privilege of calling upon you whenever
circumstances will permit," answered Ernest, glancing toward Kate, whose
eyes modestly sought the ground.</p>

<p>"Any thing that a poor body like me can do to sarve ye, Mr. Clifton,"
rejoined Ichabod, "shall ever be done straightway, if you'll only mention
it."</p>

<p>"Thank you," returned Clifton. "And now, Miss Kate," he continued,
advancing and taking her hand, which, in spite of her efforts to the
contrary, trembled not a little, "I must say farewell&mdash;may I hope it
is not forever?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not forever," said Kate, looking up with a start; and then,
as she saw the dark eyes of the other beaming tenderly upon her, she
became embarrassed, and stammered; "That is, I&mdash;I&mdash;trust you
will call again to see us&mdash;for&mdash; for&mdash;friendship sake, Mr.
Clifton."</p>

<p>"I shall call again," returned Clifton, pointedly; and shaking the
hand of each, he quitted the cottage and set out upon his return to the
garrison.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mrs. Norton.<br>
 A prophecy he spake, yet so mysterions,<br>
None knew in full its dire import.</p>

<p>&mdash;Old Play.</p>

<p>It is one of the blessings of Divine Providence that the mind can be
healed as well as the body&mdash;otherwise what wretched creatures should
we be indeed!&mdash;for who, among the most heaven favored of us all,
hath not lost a friend&mdash;a near and dear relative&mdash;and felt his
soul oppressed by a weight of woe, that then seemed destined never to be
removed; but which time has gradually lightened, until the heart has
leaped as free and joyous as in the noon-tide of its prosperity. It is
hard to part from those we love&mdash;even when we expect to behold them
again in life&mdash;for the separation leaves an aching void, that
nothing for the time can fill&mdash; and of course it must be
proportionately hard to part from those we love, knowing that we shall
behold them no more, until we ourselves shall have put off the mortal and
put on immortality. But, notwithstanding this, we should ever strive to
avoid being too much cast down; should buoy ourselves up with the
reflection, that all are born to die; and that they who have passed the
fatal barrier have already done with a world of trouble, and entered upon
a new, and, we trust, more happy existence&mdash; where we, when we have
played our parts on the stage of life, shall join them to separate no
more forever. Let us philosophize that death is but a sleep, and eternity
a delightful dream, and that the sooner our spirits leave this
troublesome tenement, fitly prepared for the change, the sooner we shall
be in Heaven.</p>

<p>Some minds are so constituted, that the least trouble seems sufficient
to overthrow them, and great troubles drive them nearly distracted; and
yet after a little, they gradually become tranquil, sorrow passes away,
and they appear as gay and light-hearted as before: while, on the other
hand, we find others, who appear calm amid the lesser ills, and amid the
greater make little or no complaint, and yet are secretly borne down to
the grave by the afflictions they scarce seem to lament. Something of
both these natures could be found in Kate and her mother. As time wore
on, the former gradually became more and more herself; while the latter
appeared to pine away in secret, as though some inward disease were
preying upon her vitals. From the moment she received the news of her
husband's death, Mrs. Clarendon was never known to smile; and though at
first she made great lamentation over him, yet this soon settled into a
quiet, silent melancholy, that foreboded, ere long, either death or
insanity.</p>

<p>Three months rolled away, and the mother of Kate was found to be in a
decline of health. A cold that she had caught some two months before, had
settled on her lungs, which, together with grief for the loss of her
husband, was now making those rapid strides with her constitution, that
always awaken fears of the most painful nature. She coughed a good
deal&mdash; her voice became changed&mdash;more hoarse and
hollow&mdash;and there was, at times, a wax-like transparency about her
skin, and a hectic flush on her cheek, that told, with unmistakable
certainty, of the silent work of death going on within.</p>

<p>Kate noticed the progress of the fell destroyer with less alarm than
might have been supposed. Doubtless she did not realize how much had
already been done, and looked forward to years of companionship with her
mother. But not so Mrs. Clarendon herself. Unlike many who have that
flattering disease, consumption, fastened upon them, she saw and felt her
danger; and, like the wise ones of old, deemed it expedient to have her
lamps trimmed and burning, ready for the coming of the bridegroom.
Accordingly, one bright summer's day toward the latter part of August,
she bade Kate seat herself by her side, that they might converse on a
subject of no little moment to both.</p>

<p>"It has now," observed Mrs. Clarendon, laying her thin, transparent
hand on the white and plump one of Kate, thereby displaying a painful
contrast between sickness and health: "It has now, daughter, been three
months, since that terrible night when your father was brought home a
corpse, and your acquaintance began with Ernest Clifton; and as I know I
am not long destined to remain and watch over you, I wish you to tell me,
truly, how you stand affected toward each other."</p>

<p>"Ah! mother," exclaimed Kate, turning her eyes tenderly and earnestly
upon the other, "what mean you, by using such gloomy words?"</p>

<p>"Look here," replied Mrs. Clarendon, touching her face with her
finger, "do you not behold here the effects of inward disease and certain
decay?"</p>

<p>"But death may not come for years, yet, mother," rejoined Kate,
anxiously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clarendon shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>"You mistake, daughter," she said. "Put weeks in place of years, and
perhaps you will have hit it. No, Kate, my darling, I know, by an inward
monitor&mdash;by this dry, hollow cough&mdash;that I am not long for this
world; and I am anxious to know what will become of you, when you find
yourself alone, with no father nor mother to turn to for protection and
advice."</p>

<p>"Mother, dear mother, do'nt talk so" cried Kate, bursting into tears,
and burying her head upon the lap of her parent. "Oh! mother, you will,
you must live years yet. I cannot, cannot part with you so soon."</p>

<p>"For your sake, child, I would to God I could!&mdash;but He who sees
the sparrow fall, has ordered otherwise."</p>

<p>"Oh! do not talk so, mother! You are ill now I know&mdash;but you may
yet be well again."</p>

<p>"Child," continued Mrs. Clarendon, bending over her daughter
affectionately, her now somewhat sunken eyes moist with tears: "Child, do
not delude yourself with any false hope. The grass that comes upward
beneath the fairy-like tread of the foot of Spring, may rise, perchance,
from the soil resting on the body of your mother; and that, too, ere
another year has joined the great unapproachable Past. But tell me when
last you saw Ernest Clifton, and how matters stand between you! I ask
with no idle curiosity; I ask only as a mother; so tell me truly."</p>

<p>"It is a week, dearest mother, since we last met," answered Kate,
looking up through her tears, a slight flush giving her comely features a
beautiful glow; "but as to the matters you allude to, I scarcely know how
to answer."</p>

<p>"Has he ever offered you his hand?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," answered Kate, hesitatingly; "though perhaps he would
have done so, had I always remained silent at the proper time."</p>

<p>"And why did you not, my daughter? Do you not love him?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know what love is," answered Kate, dropping her eyes to the
ground; "but I certainly admire him more than any other I have ever
seen."</p>

<p>"Do you admire him sufficiently, to desire him for a life-companion?"
asked Mrs. Clarendon.</p>

<p>"I think I could be happy with him, mother."</p>

<p>"Then, daughter, understand me! From what I have seen, I think him a
brave, noble, and generous young man, and worthy of you; and it is my
desire to see you united before I die."</p>

<p>"Ah! mother, you are talking of death again," said Kate, her tears
starting afresh.</p>

<p>"We know not, daughter, when we may be called away; and should my
death be sudden, it would be a bitter pang to know I was leaving you
behind without a protector, in this cold, calculating world. But of
course I leave the matter with yourself, to do as you think proper.
Marriage is a solemn undertaking, and should not be lightly entered into.
Unless you can place your full, undivided affections upon one individual,
do not marry at all; for there are, necessarily, trials in married life,
that none but such as truly love can surmount with any thing like harmony
of feeling. I say nothing would delight me more than to see you happily
wedded; yet, understand, I do not wish to influence you against your
choice, and your own sober reason; for, as I said before, marriage is a
most solemn undertaking. And now that we are on the subject, pray tell me
how it stands with your former suitors?"</p>

<p>"Why, Danvers and Danbury, I believe, have suited themselves
elsewhere; and as for that villain, Moody&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Name him not, Kate&mdash;name him not!" exclaimed Mrs. Clarendon,
covering her eyes, and shuddering at the images of horror which his name
called up. "May he meet his deserts, is all I ask. Yet one question: Has
he been found?"</p>

<p>"He has not, although Governor St. Clair has offered the reward of a
hundred dollars for his apprehension. It is supposed, by some, that he
has joined the Indians."</p>

<p>"Then we may fear the worst," rejoined the mother of our heroine,
sadly.</p>

<p>"Why so, mother?"</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten the awful threat contained on that paper,
Kate&mdash;`<i>Wo to them that bear the name of the dead?</i>' "</p>

<p>"O, that might have been done to intimidate us, you know, mother. Do
not let it trouble you. I feel not the least apprehension; for
Ern&mdash;a&mdash;Mr. Clifton assured me, that scouts were continually
out in all directions, so that at present it would be impossible for a
body of Indians to reach either this place or Cincinnati, before alarm of
their approach would be given."</p>

<p>"Yet do not rely too much upon your safety, Kate," pursued Mrs.
Clarendon; "for I have been informed, that the force at Fort Washington
is not large, so that from there not many soldiers could be spared for
scouting purposes. Now I think of it seriously, perhaps we had better
give up our premises here and take up our quarters nearer some
block-house!"</p>

<p>"But why so, mother? Has any thing new and startling transpired to
alarin you?"</p>

<p>"Why, I had a very singular dream last night, which, I confess,
troubles me not a little on your account. I thought I was standing in a
beantiful arbor, surrounded by flowers of all colors and varieties&mdash;
from the modest pink and violet, to the large and luxuriant
rose&mdash;and that you and many others were seated around, arrayed in
white. I thought it was some solemn occasion of rejoicing&mdash;something
like a wedding, and yet not a wedding either. In the center of the group
stood an old, grey-headed man, that methought was our pastor; and yet,
the resemblance to him was not perfect, but confused. Methought he raised
his trembling hands above his venerable head, to pronounce a benediction,
when suddenly, and while every eye was upon him, a dark cloud enveloped
us, and forth with resounded shrieks and groans, the most awful I ever
heard. Suddenly I felt my self growing dizzy&mdash;indistinct objects
whirled past me&mdash;and I felt myself to be
falling&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash; into a horrible lake of
blood&mdash;when your father, pale as marble, sprang forward, clasped me
in his arms, and, hurrying me away to some quiet spot, whispered in my
ear, `We have met to part no more.' With a cry of joy, tinged with the
horror of the scene I had just witnessed, I awoke, and found myself lying
on the floor. What augur you from the dream, my daughter?"</p>

<p>"Why, I do not think it best to give ourselves any uneasiness about
it; people often dream as strangely, without any serious results."</p>

<p>"But somehow," pursued Mrs. Clarendon, "I cannot shake off the
impression, that this portends evil to somebody&mdash;perhaps
myself."</p>

<p>"God forbid!" exclaimed Kate, fervently, throwing her arms around her
mother's neck, and pressing a kiss upon her fading lips. "God forbid that
any thing should happen you, dearest mother! But let us hope our
afflictions are over&mdash;at least for the present."</p>

<p>"It is always proper to hope, child; and God in his goodness has so
ordained it, that there are but few situations, in all the changes of
human life, where hope becomes extinct. By the way, have you seen any
thing of Luther of late?"</p>

<p>"No, I have not seen him since the night of father's death, though I
have heard of his being in the vicinity. He passed through the village a
few days since, and I believe uttered some of his prophesies; one of
which was to the effect, that Columbia would never be a city; and
another, that treasures had been concealed on the banks of the Little
Miami. Some have put faith in his words, and been and dug for gold; but I
believe nothing unusual has been the result."</p>

<p>"Strange being he!" observed Mrs. Clarendon, musingly. "Can it be
possible that he is gifted with what is called second sight?"</p>

<p>"I know not, mother, what are his gifts in that respect; but I do
know, that he foretold some things which have come true; and that over me
exercised a strange kind of power, beyond my comprehension. Never did I
put faith in him till then. But, Heaven preserve him! for he saved my
life from a villian."</p>

<p>"And will again," said a deep voice."</p>

<p>Kate and her mother turned quickly round, and, to their astonishment,
beheld the tall, rough form of Luther, standing in the doorway, calmly
leaning upon his long stick of witch-hazel.</p>

<p>"Art thou mortal?" asked Mrs. Clarendon, vainly endeavoring to shake
off a superstitions feeling that came creeping over her, with a chilly
sensation. "Art thou mortal, Luther?"</p>

<p>"I am what I am," replied the Necromancer, solemnly. "This much know:
I was born of woman, and am bound to die. God save all here! for already
the second trump of woe is being blown&mdash; the second vial of wrath
being emptied. Maiden, listen!</p>

<br>
 "To him who holds thy heart in bond, <br>
Freely may'st thou now respond; <br>
Yet guard thy every word and sigh, <br>
For trysting hour with thee is nigh.

<p>"He whom you love will soon be with you."</p>

<p>"Whom I love," repeated Kate, a deep flush mantling her face and neck.
"And whom do I love?"</p>

<p>"Whom the fates decreed you should&mdash;Ernest Clifton."</p>

<p>"Nay, I know not that I love him," responded Kate, turning away her
head.</p>

<p>"Tell that to the winds&mdash;peradventure they will believe you; but
think not to deceive me, nor thyself, fair maiden. Thou knowest, Kate
Clarendon, that Ernest Clifton holds thy heart&mdash;else why that
averted head and tell-tale blood. And, maiden, fear not that he is
unworthy thee. The diamond, fresh raised from the bedded mine, is not
more pure than the blood leaping with the impetuosity of youth through
his veins. Sometime I will tell thee more. Adieu! and remember&mdash;
trysting time is near."</p>

<p>"Stay, Luther, and partake of some refreshment," said Mrs. Clarendon,
as the Necromancer turned to depart.</p>

<p>"Would to God," returned Luther, solemnly, "I could bid thee stay! But
I go now, and you go soon; and yet you will not follow me, for we journey
different ways. Your path lies there;" and Luther pointed upward. "You
ask me to take refreshment. This is kind of you, and I thank you; but I
have it here;" and he pointed over his shoulder, with his thumb, to the
knapsack on his back. "Thank God! it costs little to keep me; for I live
plain, as becometh one of my calling. Jerk, roots and berries are my
food; and my drink, the silver waters spouting from the cool,
forest-shaded earth. And now, adieu! Pray often, and fast often&mdash;for
if the stars do not lie, you will both soon feel the need of Divine
aid."</p>

<p>As Luther said this, he turned and disappeared. The eyes of Kate and
her mother met, with expressions of superstitious bewilderment.</p>

<p>"It can do us no harm to pray, at all events," said Mrs. Clarendon;
and suiting the action to the word, she knelt upon the ground&mdash; Kate
knelt beside her&mdash;and the hearts of both were poured out in
supplications to the God of that Tribunal before which all nations must
be judged.</p>

<p>&mdash;****</p>

<p>With thee conversing I forget all time.</p>

<p>&mdash;Milton.</p>

<p>It was a bewitching night. The moon rode high in the heavens, and
poured her soft, silvery flood over the luxuriant and apparently sleeping
earth. No breeze rustled a leaflet&mdash;no sounds were heard, save those
soft, dreamy ones which are made by the night-watehers. Not a cloud
marred the broad, blue canopy overhead, through which could here and
there be seen the rich, golden light, shot from some bright star, itself
away in the incomprehensible and boundless realms of space. The mighty
forest seemed sleeping, and one could almost fancy nodding, too, in its
sleep. It was a night for love. Just sufficiently calm and holy to a
waken all those fine poetic chords of nature, whose gentle, musical tones
are drowned and lost amid the harsher sounds of every day, active life. A
night for communing with some bright being, who has gone from this vale
of tears to a happier and holier sphere&mdash;or with one who still
lingers here, pluming her wings for an immortal and eternal flight. A
night, indeed, for lovers and love.</p>

<p>On the banks of the Little Miami, stood an old sycamore, whose white
and aged arms, thrown abroad over the murmuring stream, seemed no bad
type of a prophet about to utter oracles for coming ages to define, or
pronounce a benediction over the gurgling waters that rolled beneath.</p>

<p>In keeping with the hour and the scene, there glided beneath this old
sycamore, in the checkered light which the moon made by stealing among
the leaflets, two figures&mdash;a youth and a maiden. At the base of the
old tree they paused, and seated themselves on a crooked trunk of a
smaller one, which, projecting over the waters, shot upward a growing
rival to its patriarchal neighbor. They seated themselves upon the trunk
of this tree in silence, and looked downward for a few moments, and
listened to the song of the streamlet, as it mingled harmoniously with
the quiet hum of forest life. Beautiful and sacred thoughts were in the
breasts of both; for they thought of each other and of love; and who will
deny that true love is a sacred theme, and has more of Heaven in it than
earth!</p>

<p>"This," said the young man, in a low, musical voice, that accorded
well with every thing around: "This is a night, and a scene that I
love."</p>

<p>"And I," was the response of the gentle maiden by his side, in a tone
that lost itself in harmony with the murmuring river at her feet. "What,"
she continued, "is more enchanting than Nature, when displayed in her
mildest and loveliest form, to the soul that views it in a corresponding
mood of quietude?"</p>

<p>"Ay! and to behold its beauties," answered her companion, "the soul
must be in harmony with it; and what will so soon harmonize the soul to a
scene like this, as love?"</p>

<p>The maiden drooped her head, and tapped the earth lightly with her
delicate little foot, but did not answer. A moment the young man paused,
and then gently stealing the hand of the maiden, and pressing it in his
own, he went on.</p>

<p>"What feeling is there, dear Kate, more subdued and holy than the
yearning of a soul toward a kindred spirit? and the intoxicating
response&mdash;the harmonious blending together of both? Harmony is the
main spring of creation, on which depends alike the existence of a world,
and the happiness of a human being. He whose soul is not in unison with
nature and the things around him, must of necessity be unhappy. I did not
come hither, however, to philosophize, but to speak of matters which lie
nearer my heart. Months, dearest Kate, have intervened, since that
never-to-be-forgotten night, when we met for the first time, under
circumstances the most painful to both; and often since then have we been
together, walked together, and conversed together on various
subjects&mdash;may I inquire if these meetings have in any wise been
disagreeable to you?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," answered Kate, "I will be frank to own, they have
proved the happiest periods of my life."</p>

<p>"On this point, then, our feelings harmenize; for the only real
pleasure I have myself enjoyed, has been in your sweet company. But to
change the subject, somewhat&mdash;let me inquire regarding your
mother?"</p>

<p>"She does not seem so well tonight," answered Kate, sadly.</p>

<p>"So I fancied, from what I saw," rejoined Clifton. "Have you tho't
seriously upon her illness, Kate?"</p>

<p>"I do not know as I understand you."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to alarm you, Kate, but only to prepare your mind for a
grave subject. Perhaps you are ignorant of her complaint?"</p>

<p>"Ha! then you think it dangerous, Ernest?" exclaimed the fair girl,
grasping his arm, with a nervous motion, and endeavoring to catch the
expression of his features in the darkness.</p>

<p>"You must prepare yourself to part with her ere long," said Ernest,
solemnly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven! you alarm me, Ernest!&mdash;and yet you but repeat what
she told me herself to-day. Oh, God! if she be taken from me, I shall be
alone, indeed, without a protector, perhaps a friend!"</p>

<p>"Nay, Kate, dearest," rejoined Ernest, encircling her waist with his
arm; "it is of that I wish to speak. There are none, I know, that can
supply the place of a mother; and could my earnest prayers avail aught,
you should never feel the want of one; but it would be little less than
criminal, methinks, to disguise from you the fact, that, as regards your
mother, the fatal work of death has already begun."</p>

<p>"Great God!" cried Kate, wildly, placing her hands to her temples;
"you do not mean this! Oh! say you are jesting!&mdash;say you did it to
frighten me!&mdash;say anything!&mdash; but, for God's sake! do not tell
me my dear mother is dying!"</p>

<p>"In this world," replied the young officer, in a tone slightly
tremulous, "we must look for nothing hut crosses, disappointments, and
partings from those we love. That your mother is dying, in the literal
sense of the term, I would not imply; she may hold out for weeks, and
even months; but, painful as is the task, I cannot conscientiously
conceal from you the truth, that she is in deep consumption, and that
there is no hope of seeing her restored to health."</p>

<p>Kate bowed her head upon her hands, sobbed aloud, and groaned like one
in pain.</p>

<p>"Yet, dearest girl, take it not so hard! Remember, we are in a world
where death is ever parting friends; and that, sooner or later, we must
all separate, according to the will of Him who shapes our destinies. You
said, but now, that if your mother were called away, you would be without
a protector, perchance a friend. It grieved me, dear girl, to hear you
say thus. No, Kate Clarendon, while Ernest Clifton lives, you shall never
want a friend; and&mdash;and (his voice trembled and sank to a
whisper)&mdash;it rests with you to say, whether the friend and protector
shall be one."</p>

<p>Kate still sat with her head bowed down, trembling and silent; and
pausing for a moment, Clifton again proceeded in a low, earnest
voice.</p>

<p>"It has been but three months, since accident first threw us together,
dear Kate; and yet to me our acquaintance seems that of years. From what
I have seen of you, I am perfectly confident you hold the power to make
me happy or miserable; in other words, dearest Kate, I must own I love
you, and did from the moment I saw displayed those heroic qualities at
the death of your father."</p>

<p>"Let us not talk of this now," said Kate, hurriedly.</p>

<p>"And why not now?" rejoined the other, with some uneasiness; "there
may never be a better time and place, and we know not what may
happen."</p>

<p>"But somehow," sighed Kate, "I feel strangely&mdash;as if danger were
lurking nigh."</p>

<p>"I see how it is," returned Clifton, in a tone of sadness; "you do not
love me, and seek to avoid, as you have done on all previous occasions,
any mention of a subject which I must own lies nearest my heart. Be it
so, then; you will doubtless find another more worthy, and more to your
liking."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Kate, startled at the turn matters had taken: "Nay,
Ernest, I meant not that."</p>

<p>"And now I think of it, I know no reason why you should love me,"
continued Clifton, pursuing his own train of reflections. "I am only a
poor officer in the army, whose duty is where danger lies, and know not
at what moment I may be ealled away to another station or another world.
'Tis better, now I think seriously on the subject, that you do not love
me, Kate; I might only be an instrument in the hands of Providence, for
making your sorrows heavier."</p>

<p>Kate turned her eyes toward her companion for a moment&mdash;with a
look, which, could Ernest have seen, his heart would have smote
him&mdash; and then burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Ah! why do you weep dear Kate?" asked the other, tenderly. "Have I
mistaken your meaning?"</p>

<p>Kate answered not; but her head gradually sunk against his breast, and
her tears burst forth afresh.</p>

<p>"Ah! Kate," cried the other, rapturously, throwing both arms around
and straining her to his heart, "what a fool have I been to mistake you!
You love me, Kate&mdash; you love me?"</p>

<p>Kate replied not, save by pressing closer to his breast.</p>

<p>"And you will be mine, dearest?"</p>

<p>A pressure of the hand was the only answer.</p>

<p>"Heaven bless you, mine own dear angel!" exclaimed Clifton, stealing
his first kiss from the trembling lips of the lovely being reclining in
his arms.</p>

<p>Two hours rolled away, and still the lovers were seated beneath that
same old sycamore, and lost to the outer world in a sweet communion with
each other.</p>

<p>"And when shall it be?" asked Clifton, at length, in reference to
something which had gone before.</p>

<p>"That I shall leave to you," replied Kate.</p>

<p>"Then the sooner the better," rejoined the other. "Yet, stay! I have
forgotten one question: Your mother, Kate&mdash;will she give her
consent?&mdash;for I will do nothing against her will."</p>

<p>"It is already given," replied Kate. "It is her own desire, dear
Ernest, to see us united before she dies."</p>

<p>"Heaven bless her! When said she this?"</p>

<p>"To day. She called me to her, questioned me of you, spoke of you in
the highest terms of praise, and said, if it accorded with the feelings
of both, nothing would please her better than to see us duly united."</p>

<p>"I shall go wild with joy. A week from to-night, then, Kate&mdash;
will that suit you?"</p>

<p>"I said I should leave it to you," returned Kate, averting her
face.</p>

<p>"Then the bond is settled, and so let us seal it," rejoined Clifton,
gaily; and the next moment the lips of the lovers met in a long and
rapturous kiss of love.</p>

<p>"There is one thing more," said Ernest again, after a pause of a few
moments. "I have told you nothing of my history, Kate. Perhaps, when you
come to hear that, you will change your mind in regard to this
matter?"</p>

<p>"Then keep it ever a secret, Ernest," answered Kate, frankly. "If I
wed you, it will be for your noble self alone. So that your own conduct
has been upright through life, I care for nothing more."</p>

<p>"Noble, generous girl!" cried the other, in a transport of joy, "now I
love thee more than ever, for thy unwavering confidence in me. May Heaven
watch over us both, and allow me to strew thy path with flowers even to
the verge of the grave!"</p>

<p>"Hist!" said Kate, laying her hand upon the arm of her companion. "Did
you not hear a noise?"</p>

<p>"What was it like?"</p>

<p>"The cracking of some dry twig or bush."</p>

<p>Both now listened attentively for some moments; but all was silent,
save the rippling of the stream, the chirping of the insects, and the low
sighing of the forest, as a light breeze swept through it.</p>

<p>"I think you must have been mistaken, dear Kate," said Ernest, "for
all seems still."</p>

<p>"Then fancy has made me timid," returned Kate, pressing closer to the
other; "and so I think we had better return. Ha! what was that?"</p>

<p>"I hear nothing but the hooting of an owl."</p>

<p>"What a gloomy sound! Strange it is, dear Ernest, but I feel so
nervous&mdash; so much as I did on that terrible night when father died.
My God! I hope I am not to pass such a night again. Come, come, let us
return, quick as possible! for I cannot divest myself of the idea that we
are surrounded by danger."</p>

<p>"O, it is nothing; you are needlessly alarmed, dear Kate, I am sure,"
replied Ernest, consolingly. "But we will return, at all events, for I
fear it is getting late."</p>

<p>"Late!" echoed Kate, as they commenced retracing their steps to the
cottage. "Why how long have we been away I pray you?"</p>

<p>"Guess."</p>

<p>"Half an hour, perhaps."</p>

<p>"You are more complimentary than correct," returned Clifton, with a
light laugh, as, by the glimmer of the moon through the trees, he was
enabled to make the time from his watch. "Add two hours to the half and
you will hit it exactly."</p>

<p>Kate was about to utter an exclamation of surprise, and insist that
her lover was mistaken, when the stirring of a bush just ahead of her,
caused her to start back with a suppressed cry of fear. Clifton saw the
bush move also, and throwing his left arm around the waist of his fair
companion, with his right he drew his sword, and put himself in an
attitude of defense. For a few moments he stood, awaiting the appearance
of his foe, if such the unknown should prove, while Kate clung to him
with a maidenly fear, that made his arm feel strong, and raised within
him a desire to meet danger for her sake.</p>

<p>"All is quiet there again," he said, at length, in a low tone. "Could
our eyes have possibly deceived us? I will go and probe the bush with my
good sword and ascertain."</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" rejoined Kate, clasping him more tightly; "you shall not
stir a step toward it, Ernest! Here&mdash;this way&mdash;quick&mdash;let
us hurry back!" and taking an opposite direction to the bush, Kate almost
dragged Ernest after her.</p>

<p>For a few paces Clifton hung back, as if reluctant to leave the
mysterious bush: then, as if actuated by another thought, he suddenly
threw an arm around the maiden's waist, and, partly raising her from the
ground, hurried her forward at a fast run, and in a few minutes reached
the cottage in safety. Bidding her go in and bolt the door, Ernest was
about to turn back, when Kate prevented him, by declaring that if he did
she would follow. After much entreaty, he abandoned the idea, and
accepted her invitation to spend the night under her mother's roof.</p>

<p>For a few minutes after Ernest and Kate had departed, everything
remained quiet; then the bush, whose movement had so startled the latter,
became slightly agitated again, and at the same moment a head was thrust
through, and turned from side to side, as if to ascertain that the coast
was clear. Then a figure emerged from the thicket, and, as it came into
the broad light of the moon, displayed the tall, but slender form of a
white man, metamorphosed into an Indian. Portions of his body were bare,
after the Indian fashion. He wore moccasins on his feet, had paint on his
face, and his head was shaved, all but a single tuft of hair on the
crown, which was ornamanted with feathers. A belt around his waist
contained a brace of pistols, a scalping-knife and tomahawk, and in his
right hand he carried a rifle.</p>

<p>"'Tis well for you," he muttered, in English, through his close shut
teeth, shaking his fist in the direction whence he saw the lovers
disappear: "'Tis well for you, you did not probe the bush, as you were
about to do, young man&mdash;or you might have found a few inches of cold
steel probing you. A week from to night, eh! is to consummate your
desire? Ha, ha, ha! I am glad you mentioned it; for now I shall be there,
though an uninvited guest; and I will invite a few of my dusky brethren
to be there also. Peradventure if I cannot give the bride away, I can
take her to myself.&mdash; Once in my power&mdash;once mine (and his
features assumed a hellish look of satisfaction, and his black eyes
fairly shone in the darkness)&mdash; and if yon proud youth will accept
her then&mdash;why&mdash;ha, ha! let him have her&mdash;a ruined, cast
off toy. Then, and not till then, will Rashton Moody think his insult
canceled by a sweet revenge."</p>

<p>As he said this, the figure turned, plunged into the thicket and
disappeared&mdash; an evil spirit, bent on a devilish mission.</p>

 Death and destruction, and the shrieks of woe,<br>
Were seen and heard on every hand. <i>&mdash;The Siege.</i></p>

<p>Time, with his scythe and hourglass, strode steadily onward, and soon
bro't about the eventful night, which had been set apart for the
consummation of the rite indissoluble between Ernest Clifton and Kate
Clarendon. Throughout the week intervening, since we last beheld the
lovers, every preparation had been made for solemnizing the nuptials of
two beings whose souls beat in unison. Invitations had been sent to
nearly all the young people of Columbia; and at an early hour on the
evening in question, they might have been seen in pairs, riding gaily up
to the door of the bride. Ichabod Longtree, arrayed in his best, busied
himself in welcoming them to the wedding of his pet, and taking charge of
their horses, which he led around the house and secured to the trees in
the rear. Kate and her mother had robed themselves in garments of white,
being relics of those days when they were rolling in luxury. What added
additional joy to both, the health and spirits of Mrs. Clarendon, since
the announcement to her that Ernest Clifton was soon to become her
son-in-law, had revived to a wonderful degree, and she now appeared
before her guests with something of the look and manner of former days.
The excitement of the occasion had tinged her cheek with a flush
resembling health, and added additional luster to her eyes, which now
beamed with animation and joy. Kate, as might be supposed, looked
paler&mdash;more sad and thoughtful&mdash;but, at the same time, none the
less lovely. She received the greetings of her friends with an air of
grace and cordiality, and sometimes, though but seldom, smiled, at their
frequent sallies of wit. To her it seemed a grave, rather than light
occasion, and one little suited, on her part, to hilarity. However much
she might have jested on the matter once, she now felt in all its force
the responsibility of the step she was about to take. She was about to
give her hand, for good or ill, to one she loved, and that for life. She
was about to bid adieu to the romantic visions of girlhood, and enter
upon the responsible realities of a wife and womanhood. She was, in
short, about to give herself away, to become another's, to be bound to
him by solemn ties, that could not be broken without offense against the
laws of God and man. It was a great and grave undertaking&mdash;a new
epoch in her life&mdash;and though she wavered not, flinched not, yet she
trembled and felt sad at the thought.</p>

<p>Among the invited guests, came two of the former suitors of
Kate&mdash; Danvers and Danbury&mdash;each accompanied by a lass, who now
had the honor of holding a place in his heart, which was once partially
occupied by our fair heroine. They met her frankly, and cordially, with
no show of pique or resentment, and as friends who took a deep interest
in her welfare.</p>

<p>"I once flattered myself," said Danvers to Kate, smiling pleasantly,
"that I should be a prominent actor at the wedding of Kate Clarendon,
instead of a spectator; but matters have turned out otherwise."</p>

<p>"And none the worse for you," returned Kate, inclining her head to the
maiden who now held the arm and heart of her former suitor.</p>

<p>"We will hope all has been for the best," was the reply of Danvers,
looking fondly toward her whose arm he held.</p>

<p>"We lost the race, and should fain be content," put in Danbury, with a
smile, coming up at the moment, with a pretty maiden also hanging on his
arm.</p>

<p>"And in losing you <i>won,</i>" returned Kate, pointedly, punning upon
the word, and pointing to his fair companion.</p>

<p>"Why as to winning," rejoined Danbury, laughing, "that will depend
much upon a certain monosyllable from Emma here."</p>

<p>"Fie! Orville," said Emma, blush ing, and dragging him away, in the
utmost good humor.</p>

<p>An hour from the setting in of night, saw all the guests assembled at
the cottage, with the exception of the groom and clergyman, who were
momentarily expected. As was customary at that day, each of the young men
had brought with him his rifle, more from the force of habit and
precaution, than from any supposed use he would have for it. It was also,
as a matter of form, thought advisable to station a sentinel without,
that, in case anything unusual should happen, alarm might be given. This
last precaution would doubtless have been neglected, but for the report
abroad, that a small body of Indians had been seen, not long since,
within a few miles of the village. In conse-of this rumor, some of the
more timid had repaired to the block-house; but the majority of the
citizens of Columbia thought lightly of the news, and turned not aside
from their usual routine of business.</p>

<p>The guests had now all taken their seats upon rude benches, ranged
around the walls of the cabin, which had been prepared expressly for the
occasion by the gardener. A rough chandelier, constructed of wood, in
feeble imitation of some of a more solid material in the older
settlements, and which also owed its existence to the genius and labor of
Ichabod, was suspended from the ceiling by a small iron chain, near the
center of the apartment, and supported several candles, whose combined
gleams served to render every object distinct to the eye and display the
youthful and healthy looking faces of the surrounding party, the
expressions of which had grown very grave, preparatory to the coming
solemn ceremony. Beneath this chandelier stood a table, on which were a
Bible, a hymn-book, a vase of flowers, and two brass candlesticks
supporting tapers. Beside the table was a stool, to be occupied by the
clergyman on his arrival, and during the service he was expected to
perform. Flowers, too, of all hues, had been liberally scattered over the
white and sanded floor, whose fragrance was not the less sweet and
abundant, from being crushed, occasionally, beneath the passing foot of
some bright-eyed maiden or her gay gallant. Boquets and festoons
decorated the walls, and added a rosy and beautiful back-ground to the
picture.</p>

<p>At weddings of this period, a supper and dance generally succeeded;
but on the present occasion, the declining health of her mother, together
with the late loss of her father, had been a sufficient reason to induce
Kate to dispense with the latter. The supper, however, had not been
omitted. It was already laid on tables in the adjoining apartment, and
was, like almost everything else about the premises, under the careful
supervision of Ichabod Longtree&mdash;who, in addition to the qualities
of gardener and hostler, could, when occasion required, fulfill the
duties of chief cook and butler.</p>

<p>All was ready, and waited only the coming of the groom and the
clergyman, to begin the solemn and sacred rite. A deep and profound
silence reigned in the apartment, where the wedding guests were seated,
in stern repose, like so many wax figures.</p>

<p>As the first sensation to the touch of fire and ice is the same&mdash;
so, as a general thing, the feelings immediately preceding a wedding and
a funeral are strangely alike. There steals over the spectator, on both
occasions, a secret awe, an unaccountable solemnity, that he finds
impossible to shake off. Such was the feeling pervading the assemblage on
the occasion here described. From a lively and even gay conversation, the
voices of the different speakers had gradually died away to whispers, and
finally had ceased altogether. As minute after minute rolled by, and no
sounds were heard indicating the approach of the expected parties, the
guests began to look at each other inquiringly, with faces expressive of
surprise at the delay; and then low whispers stole around the circle, of
strange conjectures, giving a more gloomy turn to the whole affair.</p>

<p>As for Kate, her features had become as white, and almost as rigid, as
marble; and as she sat in full light, robed in her wedding garments,
clasping the thin, transparent hand of her mother, and gazing at vacancy,
one could easily have fancied her a beautiful conception, chiseled from
the cold, inanimate stone. The flush mentioned as surmounting the
features of Mrs. Clarendon, had rather suddenly given place to a pallor
almost frightful; and her now deeply sunked eyes roved around the
apartment, nervously, over the whispering group, as if in quest of some
object not there.</p>

<p>"It is strange they do not come!" she said, at last, in a grave
voice.</p>

<p>"Hark!" exclaimed Kate, in reply, starting to her feet, and bending
forward in a listening attitude. "My ears deceive me, or I hear the tramp
of horses' feet;" and as she concluded, she sprang to the door, followed
by most of the others.</p>

<p>It was a calm, beautiful night, and every thing without seemed wrapped
in sweet repose. The moon, already at her full, large and bright, was
just struggling over the eastern hill, and pouring her gray light down
into the forest of the plain, and giving every object a twilight
indistinctness. Wherever her rays fell upon the Miami and Ohio, their
waters shone like burnished silver. Along the base of the eastern ridge,
mentioned previously, lay a deep shadow, gradually disappearing as the
moon rose on high; while across the plain, BaldHill could be distinctly
seen, looming up in the broad light not unlike some beacon of warning. A
few white scuds were sailing overhead, and a mist, gradually ascending
here and there, defined the course of the rivers, and gave indication of
a foggy night.</p>

<p>As Kate and her companions turned their faces toward the west and
listened, the tramp of horses became more audible, until at last the
shadowy outline of two figures could be seen gliding among the trees, and
nearing the spectators at a fast amble. As they drew close upon the
cottage, Kate Clarendon was observed to tremble quite violently. She had
recognised in them two important characters&mdash; her affianced lover,
and the venerable pastor that was to bind her to him by ties the most
strong and holy; and the thought of this all important, irrevocable step,
was sufficient to unstring her nerves, and produce the effect described.
She did not wait to greet either of the new comers, but turned abruptly
and entered the dwelling, at the moment when Ernest Clifton and the
divine rode up to the door.</p>

<p>"I fear I have kept you waiting, friends," said the former, as he
dismounted, and gave his horse in charge of Ichabod; "but my venerable
companion here, met with a slight accident on the way, which detained me
not a little."</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked half-a-dozen voices at once.</p>

<p>"He was thrown from his horse and his horse thrown down, by a rope
being stretched across his path, and nearly stunned by the fall,"
answered Clifton.</p>

<p>"Foul! foul!" cried several voices, angrily.</p>

<p>"I am poor," said Clifton, "but I would give fifty dollars to know the
author of this piece of villiany, if only to chastise him for the insult
offered me and my friends."</p>

<p>"Never mind, my youthful friend," said the divine, in a mild, soothing
tone of voice; "the accident was only trifling, I feel quite well again,
and so let us trouble ourselves no more about the matter. If another
wrong me, I never retaliate, save in supplicating for him at the throne
of mercy. 'Tis a sweet and satisfactory revenge, and fulfills the command
of Scripture, which says, `Forgive thine enemies, and pray for them that
despitefully use you.' Let us in, my young friends, and return thanks to
God that the affair turned out no worse."</p>

<p>There was a sweetness, earnestness and dignity, in the voice and
manner of the speaker, that was not without its effect upon his youthful
hearers, not one of whom ventured a reply, but turned, entered the
cottage, and silently resumed their places. As the venerable pastor took
his seat at the table before described, a deep silence reigned around.
Every lip was motionless&mdash; every eye was fixed upon him.</p>

<p>"Is all ready?" he asked, in a low, tremulous, solemn voice, speaking
to Clifton, who had taken his place on the right of the trembling Kate.
Clifton whispered to Mrs. Clarendon, then to Kate, and nodded in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>"Then let us pray," said the pious pastor; and forthwith he knelt upon
the ground, and poured forth the dictates of his heart, in a strain of
eloquence seldom surpassed. He prayed for the beings before him, who were
about to become one flesh, by the sacred rite of marriage, that they
might always live happily together in this world, and meet in holy unison
to part nevermore in the world to come. He prayed for the only parent of
the bride, whom it had pleased God to afflict with disease and pain, that
she might be spared many years yet, to bless and comfort those who would
otherwise mourn her with tears of anguish. He prayed for the youth of
both sexes here present, that they might so conduct themselves as to be
ornaments to the age in which they lived, and that the generations,
which, in the order of events would soon follow them, might be strict
imitators of their noble examples. He prayed for those
absent&mdash;enemies as well as friends&mdash;and, lastly, that God would
prosper and preserve, spotless and pure, the liberties of the great
Commonwealth, to gain which had cost the blood of thousands.</p>

<p>As he ended, he rose from his knees, and, opening the Bible on the
stand before him, selected and read a passage applicable to the occasion.
He then bade Ernest and Kate stand upon their feet, and commenced the
solemn ceremony, amid a breathless silence. Every eye was fixed upon the
youthful pair&mdash;upon the pale, sweet features of Kate, as she stood
downcast and trembling&mdash;upon the noble, commanding form and face of
Ernest, as he stood erect in his close-fitting uniform, the perfect
picture of youthful pride. Every head was inclined forward, to catch the
slightest tones of the speaker. Never did a pair look more noble and
lovely; never was an occasion more solemn; never was a silence, whenever
the speaker paused, more deep. Not a breath, even, could be heard, and
the fall of a pin would have been audible. All felt a strange sensation
of awe and fear, as if some calamity were about to befall them, yet none
could give a reason for it. Even the venerable pastor himself seemed to
be uncommonly affected; for once or twice he paused and glanced around
the apartment, as if expecting to behold some unwelcome object.</p>

<p>Already had he asked the necessary questions, received the affirmative
answers, and raising his eyes above, as if appealing to Heaven, the
solemn words, "I pronounce you man and wife," were almost trembling on
his lips, when, suddenly, the sharp report of a rifle without, succeeded
immediately by a shout, a groan, and then by the most horrible yells
imaginable, caused every face to blanch with terror. The next moment
there arose the alarming cry of "Indians! Indians!" accompanied with
appalling shricks and the utmost confusion. Maidens threw their frail
arms around their lovers for protection, and the latter strove to
disengage themselves and rush to their rifles, which, unfortunately, had
been left in the adjoining cabin. In the midst of this alarming state of
affairs, Clifton drew his sword, sprang upon the table, and shouted,
"Order! Silence!" just as some half-a-dozen hideous looking savages burst
into the apartment, uttering terrific yells of fury.</p>

<p>Kate, surprised to bewilderment, had thrown her arms around her
mother, who, completely overcome by the excitement, had sunk to the floor
in a state of insensibility.</p>

<p>For a moment the foremost savage, who appeared to be chief of the
party, looked hurriedly around him, as if in search of some victim, when
his eyes falling upon Kate, he shouted, in English, "She's here," and
sprang at once to her side.</p>

<p>Clifton saw the movement, and in his haste to punish the bold
intruder, and save her he loved, he made an attempt to leap forward, when
the table tilted, upset, and he was thrown heavily to the ground. Before
he could recover his feet, the hellish work of the savage was completed.
Tearing Kate rudely from the embrace of her mother, he drew his knife and
plunged it into the heart of the latter; then raising the former in his
arms, he rushed to the door, with a laugh so fiendish it made the blood
of all who heard it curdle, and, bounding into the open air, darted into
a neighboring thicket with his prize.</p>

<p>As the captor of Kate sprang through the door, Clifton regained his
feet, in time to see her disappear. With a cry of vengeance and dispair,
he leaped forward to her rescue, when a blow on the head, from one of the
Indians, intercepted his progress, and laid him senseless on the
ground.</p>

<p>Meantime, the onset of the savages had been terrific. With horrible
yells, tomahawk in hand, they rushed upon the unarmed whites, and dealt
their blows on every side Two young men were tomahawked immediately, and
their scalps torn reeking from their bleeding heads. Two others had been
severely wounded, and two females made prisoners, when Ichabod, who on
the first alarm had escaped into the adjoining cabin, returned with his
arms loaded with rifles. With a presence of mind and dexterity worthy a
hero, he managed to distribute some five or six of these weapons among
his friends, ere the Indians became aware of what was taking place. In
fact, the first intimation they had of the matter, was from the discharge
of one which the gardener had reserved for himself, whereby a powerful
savage, who was darting forward to seize upon a terrified female, was
shot through the body. With a yell of rage and pain, he bounded up from
the ground and fell back a corpse. This astonished the dusky warriors
pressing on his rear, and they paused in their work of carnage.
Perceiving at a glance that several of the whites had suddenly become
armed, and were preparing to deal death among them, they gave vent to
yells of fury and alarm, and simultaneously rushed out of the cottage,
bearing their dead comrade with them, but leaving their prisoners behind.
With yells little less frightful than their own, those of the whites who
were armed, now sallied forth to give chase. As they reached the door,
they saw the savages already dodging among the trees, and speeding
forward with a velocity that destroyed all hope of overtaking them.
Besides, should they pursue, it was more than probable they would be
drawn into an ambuscade and all cut off; and acting with more wisdom and
caution than is usual on such occasions, they discharged their pieces at
random after the foe, and retreating into the house, instantly closed and
bolted the door.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_12">CHAPTER XI.</a></h3>

<br>
 Onward! let us pursue, with feet that tire <br>
Not, never, while we justice seek on them <br>
That have done this. It is a deed to damn <br>
The doers&mdash;a deed that Heaven scorns&mdash;and while <br>
The life-blood warms our hearts, we'll falter not, <br>
Nor pause; and peradventure Heaven will send <br>
Us aid; if not, our lives shall perish in <br>
A just and worthy cause. So onward! onward! <br>
To the rescue, on!

<p>&mdash;Brinley's Rescue.</p>

<p>Short but bloody had been the work of that enemy whose heart is ever
shut to mercy in war. When Ernest regained his senses, which happened at
the moment we have chosen to close the preceeding chapter, a scene was
presented to his vision, well calculated to make the stoutest heart grow
sick and faint. On the ground, by his side, lay the mangled remains of
Danbury, and another youth&mdash;who had come hither, but an hour before,
full of life, and hope, and buoyant feelings&mdash; now fast growing cold
in the embrace of death&mdash;their once handsome features distorted and
bloody, and their scalps already dangling at the girdle of some inhuman
monster of the forest. A little further on, half hid in the shadow of the
dim light of the apartment, he saw the form of her who had given birth to
the idol of his affections, now lying at full length upon the
ground&mdash;her white dress frightfully stained with the red current of
life, which had spouted from her breast&mdash; her features pale, and,
save a slight contraction, caused by the deathspasm, looking as calm and
sweet as if she had just sunk into a gentle sleep. Above and around him,
all was noise and confusion. Several females were huddling together in
one corner, as if striving to shrink from the foe, still shrieking for
aid, and apparently not aware that the enemy had vanished. Some were
groaning with pain, some were running to and fro completely bewildered,
and some were shouting for silence; but all was yet Babel-like
commotion.</p>

<p>Ernest felt a slight dizziness in his head, and the blood trickling
over his face. Raising his hand to the wound, he comprehended all at
once. The savage had struck him with a tomahawk, which, instead of
splitting open his skull, as intended, had glanced along the bone, and
made a frightful incision. The blow had stunned and felled him, and thus
his life had been preserved. Notwithstanding his wound, he instantly
sprang to his feet, as though it were a mere scratch, and in a voice of
authority, whose tones were distinctly audible above all the tumult,
commanded silence. As if each acknowledged his right to command, all at
once became still, and every eye was turned inquiringly upon him. His
features were pale with excitement, down which the blood was trickling in
long, red streaks, and dropping upon and soiling his splendid uniform,
rendering him an object painful to behold&mdash;so that many gazed upon
him with awe, not unlike what they would have felt on beholding one rise
from the dead.</p>

<p>"Friends," he said, "this is a terrible scene, and must be avenged.
She who was so late among you, almost a bride, has been torn away, and is
now a captive to a merciless foe&mdash;if, in fact, the thirsty tomahawk
of her captor has not already drank of her innocent blood. Yonder, behold
the gory corpse of her mother! Shall these inhuman monsters go
unpunished? Shall we not start upon her trail, swearing to rescue her if
living, if dead to avenge, or leave our bones to whiten the soil of the
red man?"</p>

<p>Cries of "Yes! yes!" resounded on all sides, while those who had
weapons grasped them tightly, and their eyes flashed, and their features
wore expressions of the most resolute determination.</p>

<p>"My poor body's devoted to the rescue of my last and only
friend&mdash; my poor, sweet mistress," rejoined Ichabod, with a strong
burst of emotion, that brought the tear to many an eye.</p>

<p>"I knew you were <i>men</i>!" said Ernest, in a tone of decision. "Let
us do, rather than say! Prepare, those of you who are disposed to follow
me, and let us depart forthwith!"</p>

<p>"But the women, the wounded and dead&mdash;what of them?" asked
one.</p>

<p>"Let some two or three remain here, while one mounts the fleetest
horse and bears tidings of the dire calamity to the village. There is no
danger here at present; for the savages, having accomplished their
hellish work, are already on their homeward retreat. We must strive to
overtake them on the way."</p>

<p>"But how shall we follow, not knowing whither they went?" asked the
same voice which had spoken before, and which Clifton now became aware
proceeded from the lips of Danvers.</p>

<p>"I know by their war-paint," answered the young officer, "that they
are a detachment of Piquas, and, if my eyes did not deceive me, were led
by a white man."</p>

<p>"By heavens! I see it all!" said Danvers, in reply. "It is that
inhuman wretch, Moody."</p>

<p>A mingled expression of horror and loathing, with a determination to
be revenged, was now visible on nearly every face.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you are right," rejoined Clifton; "for the size of
his person, and the shape of his features, as described to me, correspond
exactly to the monster I beheld."</p>

<p>"He shall die a dog's death!" shouted one.</p>

<p>"Hung and quartered without judge or jury!" said another.</p>

<p>"Roasted over a slow fire!" responded a third.</p>

<p>"He shall chew his own heart!" added a fourth.</p>

<p>"Ay, but let us catch him first," timed in Clifton. "While we tarry,
he is fleeing. Let us act at once."</p>

<p>"Ay! ay!" shouted half-a-dozen voices.</p>

<p>"Before you go, my friends, upon a journey that may be your last, let
us unite in prayer, to that God who does all things for the best, and for
our good, even when visiting us with sore afflictions," said the
venerable and pious clergyman&mdash; who, throughout the affray, had been
left unharmed, and had remained, so far, a quiet and seemingly unmoved
spectator, with his arms meekly folded on his breast, the picture of
humility and resignation. "Let us call upon our Maker for aid, in this
our sorest need!" and kneeling upon the ground, he extended his arms
aloft, and made a most fervent and eloquent prayer, which was rendered
doubly solemn by the mournfulness of the occasion.</p>

<p>When this was over, Clifton gave orders for those who were to
accompany him, to prepare themselves and set forth immediately. Some six
or eight of the party, among whom were Danvers and Ichabod, volunteered
their services at once, and in a few minutes all were ready for the
perilous journey. The pastor, and one or two others, remained to take
charge of the nearly distracted females, until aid should arrive from the
village&mdash;when the wounded would be better cared for, and the dead
consigned to dust, with all due ceremony.</p>

<p>Collecting what weapons they could, together with a good supply of
ammunition, the party in a few minutes formed around Clifton as their
leader, who announced to the rest, that the solemn moment of separation
had arrived.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe the scene which ensued. Each seemed
for a time to give himself up to his strongest feelings. Lovers rushed to
each other with a freedom and wildness which nothing but a similar
occasion could justify, threw themselves into each other's arms, and
clung around each other's necks, as if they felt the separation to be
eternal; while groans, cries and sobs of anguish resounded on all sides.
For some moments all was great commotion; but gradually the tumult
ceased, until nothing could be heard but a low murmur, in a choked voice,
or a deep drawn sigh, or a half stifled burst of grief.</p>

<p>"We waste time," said Clifton, at length.</p>

<p>"Go, my friends, and God be with you," said the preacher, solemnly;
"and Heaven send you may return with the maiden you seek&mdash;the flower
of the forest!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" responded Clifton, and two or three others; and throwing open
the door, the bereaved lover rushed out, followed immediately by his
companions.</p>

<p>"I must detain you one moment more," he added, as he felt a sharp pain
in his head; and springing back into the house, he called for a bandage.
This was quickly supplied and bound around his wound; then hastily
washing the blood from his face, he rejoined his party.</p>

<p>"Let us follow the Miami," he continued, "for I know of no better
plan, and it is possible that in the morning we may strike upon their
trail."</p>

<p>"Is there none of our party that understand trailing the savage?"
asked one.</p>

<p>"I fear not," replied Clifton. "I know of an experienced scout, but he
is far away now, in another part of the country. I would to Heaven he
were here!"</p>

<p>"And what may be his name?" inquired a strange voice, which all
immediately became aware proceeded from a figure, a few paces distant,
that was nearing them with long and steady strides. "What may be the
scout's name you've just alluded to, lieutenant?" he asked again, as he
came up, addressing himself to Clifton.</p>

<p>"David Grant," answered the young officer, endeavoring to make out the
features of the new comer, as he paused in the shadow cast by the
moon.</p>

<p>"I'm David Grant," was the laconic response.</p>

<p>"Great Heaven! David, what sent you here so opportune?" cried Clifton,
grasping the hard, weather-beaten hand of the other, with a pressure of
unmistakeable joy.</p>

<p>"May be Heaven did," was the quiet answer.</p>

<p>"It would seem so," rejoined Ernest; "for of all men, you are the one
I most desired to see, at this momentous crisis."</p>

<p>"Something's gone wrong, I reckon?" said David, in reply.</p>

<p>Clifton now hurriedly narrated the leading features of the events we
have so feebly described.</p>

<p>"I'spected as much," rejoined the scout, when he had concluded. "He
told me I'd be wanted."</p>

<p>"He! whom!" cried several of the party, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Don't know who," replied the other, "for he was a stranger to me. He
spoke like a man, but looked like the devil."</p>

<p>"Was he tall, ill-dressed, rawboned and ugly?" inquired Ernest,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Well he was all that."</p>

<p>"Had a long, flowing beard?"</p>

<p>"Powerful long beard he had."</p>

<p>"And seemed partly blind?"</p>

<p>"For the matter o' that, he looked like he might be blind altogether,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"It was the Necromancer," returned Ernest, gravely.</p>

<p>"Ay! that mysterious Blind Luther, and none other," said Danvers,
shaking his head with a superstitious air.</p>

<p>"Where did you see him, and what did he say to you?" asked the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I was scouting in the forest, more'n forty miles distant," answered
Grant, "when's I passed around a tree, my hair riz right up, on hearing a
voice say:</p>

<p>"`Hold, David!'</p>

<p>"I tried to tree, but could'nt, for a big hand on my shoulder, that
would'nt let me go.</p>

<p>"`Who are you?' says I.</p>

<p>"`A messenger of fate,' says he.</p>

<p>"`What d'ye want with me?'</p>

<p>"`Hie thee to Columbia,' he says, `and inquire for Lieutenant
Clifton's wedding.'</p>

<p>"`I did'nt know he was going to be married,' says I.</p>

<p>"`Do as I bid thee, and ask no questions!' says he; `and be sure you
reach there at an early hour, on such a night (this is the night), when
you'll find yourself wanted, and orders will be given you what to
do.'</p>

<p>"Short on't is, gentlemen, I'm here; though sometimes I did quarrel
with David Grant&mdash;thinking as how I was going on a fool's errand, or
at a madman's beck."</p>

<p>"You could never have come at a better time, unless it had been to
warn us of danger," said Clifton, solemnly. "Now, David, I have told you
the circumstances, and wait your advice on the matter."</p>

<p>"You say you think they're Piquas?"</p>

<p>"I am almost sure of it."</p>

<p>"And what object had they in doing's they did, 'spect you?"</p>

<p>"Their leader, I think, is a white man disguised, whose sole object
was to get possession of the girl. Some months ago, he was a suitor to
her hand, and she rejected him, and he swore revenge. Shortly after, her
father was murdered by his hand. To-night he has butchered her mother in
cold blood, and made her captive for some hellish end, of which I groan
to think."</p>

<p>For a moment the scout mused, as one in deep thought, and then
said:</p>

<p>"I'spect you're right, lieutenant, and that I know the party with him.
How'd they number?"</p>

<p>"Not more than ten or twelve, as near as I can judge."</p>

<p>"It's them for a wager. I've been on their trail, not a week ago; and
now I comprehend the spread moccason."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," said Clifton.</p>

<p>"Why, there was one moccason among 'em, that toed out'ard like a white
man's; and I says to myself then, `David Grant, that's ayther a pris'ner
or a renegade.' I'm glad you've told me of this, for now I reckon to find
'em. Nigh's I can come to it, they don't belong to the regular tribe o'
Piquas, but are a kinder o' outlawry vagabonds, that skulk about on their
own hook, and are most powerful mean cowards."</p>

<p>As David delivered himself of this, he strode forward into the
moonlight, and displayed the lineaments of a being well calculated for a
life in the woods. He was about thirty-five years of age, and above the
ordinary stature. His form was shriveled and sinewy, as if dried and
contracted by long exposure to the weather. His features were long, thin
and bony; and his small black eyes were continually rolling about, with a
nervous motion, as if eternally on the look out for danger. His long,
shaggy hair was surmounted with a roughly formed cap, made from the
untanned skin of some wild animal. He wore a hunting-shirt of
linsey-woolsey, to which was attached a large cape, fringed with red.
Around his waist was a belt, in which were a scalping-knife and tomahawk.
He wore moccasons on his feet, and around his neck was suspended a large
powder-horn and bullet-pouch, and in his hand he held a long rifle.</p>

<p>As David stepped forth, he immediately began a survey of the heavens
above, and the earth beneath, with the air of one long practiced in the
art of reading the sings of the forest, so necessary in determining the
movements of the woodman.</p>

<p>"It's a going to be a foggy night," he said; "that a child could tell;
for already now the clouds of mist are lifting their heads along the
trail o' the rivers, and rolling out ayther way, while a thick haze's
beginning to darken the moon. I see, by the ground signs, the varmints
have took up the river; and so I reckon our best course is to follow
that, and git as far's we can afore daylight; and it's not impossible
we'll head 'em off, or come upon their camp."</p>

<p>"Then let us go at once," said Clifton, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Don't hurry, lieutenant," returned David, respectfully, bending down
to examine the ground at his feet; "there's nothing made by
hurrying&mdash; 'specially when you've got to go by signs. Here's the
trail, sure enough," he continued, "and a bloody one 'tis, too. Ha!
there's been a scuffle here, I know by the ground being trod a few. Any
o' your party fight outside?"</p>

<p>"Heavens! it is the sentinel!" exclaimed Danvers; "for it was here he
was stationed."</p>

<p>The sentinel it proved to be; for the next moment the poor fellow was
discovered, a few paces distant, lying on his breast, and his head bloody
from the recent removal of his scalp. His rifle was found near him,
discharged, and the breach broken, showing that he had done his best for
himself and friends.</p>

<p>Examining the body, and finding that life was extinct, our party, with
a few words of eulogy and regret, passed on, leaving his remains to be
taken care of by those who remained behind. In a few minutes they were
swallowed up in the great forest; and silence, deep and gloomy, reigned
over the scene so lately rife with tumult and blood-shed.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_13">CHAPTER XII.</a></h3>

<br>
 A sounding cavern, large and dark, and full <br>
Of terror to the shrinking, trembling captive.

<p>&mdash;Anon.<br>
 A strong adversary, an inhuman wretch,<br>
Incapable of pity, void and empty<br>
From every drachm of mercy.</p>

<p>&mdash;Shakspeare<br>
 Thy suing to this man were as the bleating<br>
Of the lamb to the butcher, or the cry<br>
Of seamen to the surge.</p>

<p>&mdash;Byron.</p>

<p>Some twenty-five or thirty miles above the mouth of the Little Miami,
and forming the eastern boundary of a plain not unlike the one described
in the opening pages of this story, is a stony ridge, to which we must
now invite the readers attention. In one place, this ridge leaves the
plain abruptly, by an acelivity so steep as to make ascension a matter of
difficulty. Huge rocks, whose fronts are neither more nor less than
precipices, here rise one above the other, to a height of many feet, and
altogether present a very formidable and imposing appearance. Between
these rocks, which appear to have been thrown together by some great
convulsions of nature, are many deep fissures, through which has
struggled upward a growth of small, craggy trees and shrubbery, that,
instead of beautifying, only tend to increase the wildness and gloominess
of the scene.</p>

<p>By a circuitous route, and careful footsteps, you can gain a point on
one of these rocks, which, to the eye unaccustomed to the spot, seems one
of imminent peril. The point alluded to, is elevated above the plain a
hundred and fifty feet, and forms an area of not more than fifty square
yards. Immediately in your front, as you face the west, the rock is
perpendicular for a distance of thirty feet. Behind you rises another
perpendicular rock, and on either side is a deep and gloomy chasm.
Through one of these&mdash;that at your right hand&mdash; flows a rapid
streamlet, whose waters, unseen from where you stand, gurgling over the
rocks below, send upward a hollow, dismal sound, that invariably causes
the spectator, who visits it for the first time, to wish himself once
more safe on the plain below.</p>

<p>Gloomy as is the place in question, it is not without its attractions.
The eye here embraces an extensive scope of country, spread before it
like a map. A large and well cultivated plain, of two or three miles in
breadth&mdash;through the center of which winds the glassy stream so
often mentioned, interspersed with here and there a tidy farm house, or a
cluster of white dwellings, forming a village, with the steeple of its
church overlooking it with an air of guardianship&mdash; stretches away
to the north and south, and contrasts delightfully with the rougher and
wilder scenery at hand.</p>

<p>At the time of which we write, however, the plain had none of the
attractions of civilization it now presents; but a mighty, unbroken
forest, instead, lay on its bosom, in whose dark recesses danger
everywhere lurked, and man and beast warred with themselves and each
other continually.</p>

<p>It was late on the day succeeding the capture of Kate Clarendon, that
a tall, slim figure, in the costume of an Indian, leaped, with a light
bound, across the chasm on the left, and paused, for a moment, upon the
platform of the rock we have described. The sun was already sinking in
the west, and his rays streamed softly along the tops of the trees,
tipping them with gold, throwing the figure into bold relief, and
burnishing the huge erections of nature, until one could, with but little
stretch of the imagination, fancy them colossal images of brass.</p>

<p>We have said the figure was costumed like an Indian; but that he was
not of this race, was evident from the whiteness of his skin, wherever
the removal of the paint, by perspiration or otherwise, permitted it to
be seen. There were other signs going to prove him not a native warrior.
His arms seemed tender, as if not accustomed to exposure, and were
scratched in several places, by brambles and thorns, so as to render them
swollen and sore. The feathers, intended as ornaments to his scalp-lock,
had also become disarranged, in a manner that the pride of a native
Indian would never have permitted. Around his waist he wore a wampun
belt, supporting a brace of pistols, a tomahawk and scalping-knife. As he
paused upon the rock, he ran his black, fiery eye over the plain, for a
moment, as if to be certain no one was approaching. Then he glanced
cautiously around him, and a malignant expression of triumph lighted up
and gradually settled over his features.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! I have her safe now!" he exclaimed, with an oath; and
running to the side of the rock overhanging the stream, he began to let
himself down its jaggy sides, and presently disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>There was, on this side, a rough kind of staircase, overhanging the
foaming flood; and down this the figure descended rapidly, taking hold of
the bushes and projections, to prevent himself from falling, until he
came to a spot where the rock jutted completely over the stream, and
formed a sure foundation to his feet. Halting here for a moment, and
listening the while, he turned to the right, and passing under the rocky
bank, entered the mouth of a cavern, which extended back into the hill a
considerable distance. Hurrying rapidly forward, through a narrow
passage, he at last came to a stone, which he with difficulty removed,
and emerged into a compartment of great breadth and size, dimly lighted
by a small opening or fissure in the rock above, whence trickled down, or
rather filtered through, just sufficient water to render the rock beneath
wet and slippery.</p>

<p>Here the figure paused again, and endeavored to peer into the further
recesses of the cave; but it was evident from his manner, and the fact
that he had so recently come from the broad light of day into a place
never at any time more than twilight, that he could not discern a single
object. Stepping aside somewhat, to avoid the dripping water, he at once
proceeded to strike a light. A half-burnt torch lay on the floor of the
cavern, which re-lighting, he proceeded to search the place, holding this
in his hand, elevated above his head, so as to enable him to discern each
thing distinctly.</p>

<p>For some time it was evident by his lowering brow, angry visage and
keen searching eyes, that he was unable to find the object sought. But at
length he paused, uttered a wild yell, not unlike an Indian, and then
sprang forward to a dark corner of the cavern, where another figure,
arrayed in white, was crouched, and trembling with terror.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! I have thee now!" he cried, with a hoarse burst of
passion, and a laugh like a fiend; and the next moment he stood over the
crouching object, waving his torch from side to side, and resembling, as
the ruddy light flashed upon his dark, malignant face, some infernal
spirit, about to seize upon an innocent victim.</p>

<p>"Oh, God! to what am I destined!" exclaimed in silvery, but
heart-touching tones, the voice of the unhappy object at the monster's
feet. At the same moment, the ruddy, gloomy light fell upon the pale,
sweet features of a terrified female, as she attempted to rise and
confront her foe.</p>

<p>"Destined to perdition with me!" returned the savage, with another
fiendish laugh, roughly grasping an arm of the maiden, and raising her to
an upright posture. "Now I have thee, Kate Clarendon, and thou shalt this
time feel the vengeance of Rashton Moody."</p>

<p>"Unhand and let me go, if thou art a man!" screamed Kate, in
terror.</p>

<p>Moody uttered a mocking laugh.</p>

<p>"Talk to the wind!" he cried, furiously, "not to me! If I am a man!
ha, ha! I like that! <i>If</i> I am a man! But I am not a man, sweet
beauty. I <i>was</i> a man, but you, <i>you</i> made a demon of me; and
now my hour has come&mdash;my time of vengeance is at hand!"</p>

<p>"But what have I done to merit this?" said the other, in a pleading
tone.</p>

<p>"Done?&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;come, I like that. Done all that a
woman could, to make him hate who once loved her. Done, foolish girl! why
did you not coquette with me, and lead me to believe I was loved, that I
might be a laughing stock among my fellows?"</p>

<p>"As God is my judge, Rashton Moody, I did not."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"I explained the matter to you once&mdash;have you forgotten it?"</p>

<p>"And are too proud or haughty, I suppose, to do so again. Well, well,
it matters not; for <i>now</i> you are in my power, indeed; and I will
teach you a lesson of humility, ere you depart, that you will remember to
the latest moment of your life."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he grasped her arm tightly, and peered into her sweet
countenance, with a look of diabolical triumph, that caused Kate to
shudder and feel sick to her very soul.</p>

<p>"What mean you by such language?" she faintly asked.</p>

<p>"Hark you, Kate Clarendon! I told you once I loved you, did I
not?"</p>

<p>"Foolish words upon a foul tongue," replied Kate, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" sneered Moody. Never mind; it is of little
importance now, whether I told you true or not. I would have wedded you,
but you refused me, did you not?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, proud beauty! I'll soon teach you well!&mdash;but to my story.
You refused me; you trifled first, led me to hope, and then refused me. I
was wild with passion; and in an evil moment, I sought to bear you away.
Had you left me to do as I pleased, no wrong would have followed; but you
attempted to escape, and then I swore you should be mine, living or dead,
I little cared which. I caught you, and would have executed my design
upon you then&mdash;would have sent your soul, unpolluted, into the
presence of your Maker&mdash;had I not been struck to the ground by the
only being on earth I fear. Who he is, or what he is, I know not; but
over me he exercises an influence beyond my skill to shake off or
explain. Then came your father, and struck me&mdash;(here Moody paused
for some moments, during which his features worked convulsively, his
hands clenched and unclenched, his teeth grated against each other, and
his breath came hard thro' his expanded nostrils); he struck me!&mdash;
mark that!&mdash;disgraced me&mdash;but he&mdash;he paid for
it!&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash; the blow was returned with interest,
by&mdash;!" and he closed with an oath, while Kate covered her eyes with
her hands and groaned aloud.</p>

<p>"Come, look up!" resumed Moody, forcing her hands from before her
eyes: "Look up, now, and hear me out! That night I returned to the
village, took what things I most valued, and fled; fled for my own
safety&mdash;fled to lay my plan of revenge. I had been struck&mdash;a
blow!&mdash;heavens!&mdash;a blow!&mdash;by him&mdash;your
father&mdash;and I wanted revenge. Whither should I seek safety but among
the Indians&mdash; among the foes of my race! I knew if I came peaceably
among them, and offered to join them, I should be accepted. Two years
before I had been a captive among the Shawanoes, long enough to
understand in part their language, and got my liberty through the
influence of the Necromancer, who told me then, unless I were careful, I
should come to some base end. But he's a fool! What does he know about me
or my destiny?</p>

<p>"I fled, I say, toward an Indian settlement; but ere I reached one, I
fell in with a scouting party of Piquas. I showed them the open hand,
told them my story, and they adopted me. I was taken home to their
village&mdash;went through the Indian ceremony&mdash;was shaved, painted,
and dressed in skins&mdash;and was, in short, made one of them.</p>

<p>"Then I told them I wanted one trusty warrior, and only one, to go
with me on the war path&mdash;that I had a chief to kill among the pale
faces, to prove my courage and fealty. They consented that I should go,
but said I must go alone.</p>

<p>"But why am I detailing? Enough! I went.&mdash;I soon reached your
dwelling, and prowled about the vicinity for several days before the
opportunity I sought presented itself. It came at last. I saw your father
and his serving man set out upon a hunt. I laughed, and dogged their
footsteps. They killed a deer, and your father thought to bear it home,
while the other set off for another. I laughed again, for I saw my hour
of vengeance was at hand. He put the deer on his back, but soon grew
weary with his burthen, and paused under a tree to rest. I crept up
behind him&mdash; and&mdash;Fool! why do you tremble so? You have seen it
all once, and now you are only hearing of it."</p>

<p>"For God's sake! do not, do not tell me more!" cried Kate,
imploringly.</p>

<p>"O, hear it out, my dear; it will do you good, and prepare you for
what is to come," sneered Moody. "I crept up behind him, I say&mdash;and
he was sitting so cozily, too, under that tree, wiping the perspiration
from his face, and murmuring something about his wife and daughter&mdash;
and plunged my knife into his breast, and&mdash;'Pon my word, I believe
she has fainted," added Moody, changing suddenly from his narrative to a
soliloquy, as he perceived Kate sink down upon the rock at his feet.</p>

<p>Hastily raising her in his arms, he now bore her to the water. There
was a slight hollow in the rock here, and scooping the water up in his
hand, he dashed it in her face until she revived, when, like the
inquisitors of old, he again proceeded with the torture.</p>

<p>"I knew the wounds were mortal; and so, after affixing my mark, I left
him, and, climbing a tree, stationed myself where I could see the result.
The result of course you know, and so I shall not detail it."</p>

<p>"Well, I returned to my dusky brethren and told my tale. They listened
gravely, and asked me for the scalp of my white foe. This I had
forgotten; and they laughed at me, and told me I had killed a deer, and
thought it a warrior in disguise. I felt chagrined, and told them I would
prove myself what I pretended to be. I went forth again alone, and
returned with two white scalps. Then they seemed greatly pleased, and
made me a sort of chief, and gave me command of a scouting party.</p>

<p>"Now it was, I felt my design would at last be gained, and you be in
my power. To this end all my thoughts were bent; and this your presence
here tells I have accomplished.</p>

<p>"One night, while stealing round your dwelling, I saw you and your
lover issue forth together, and I kept you both in sight. You paused on
the river's bank, and sighed to each other your love-sick tales. Heavens!
how my blood boiled to crush you both together; but prudence restrained
me. I listened to your soft words until I became tired and disgusted.</p>

<p>"At last they came to an end, and I heard the day set for your
marriage. Then my plan was laid; I would be there with my painted
friends; and in the height of your enjoyment, would make the scene a
scene of wailing and woe. You I sought for my victim, and you I found in
your mother's arms. It was your last embrace&mdash;for she is
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where you will never be," interrupted Kate, impressively&mdash;"in
Heaven!" Then clasping her hands together, she looked upward, and
bursting into tears, cried: "Alas! my poor, dear mother! thou art indeed
gone! God rest thy soul! But thou art in Heaven; and, oh! that I were
with thee&mdash;dear, dear, sainted mother!"</p>

<p>"I seized and bore you hence," continued Moody, without appearing to
heed the interruption of the other; "and as the first ray of light
streaked the eastern heavens this morning, I placed you here, whence you
cannot depart until I will you so to do. Nay, do not shrink away! for now
I tell you plainly, you are in my power, and beyond the reach of aid.
Save my warriors, there is not a living soul, besides ourselves, that
knows there is such a place in existence; and they have yielded you up to
me, and will not betray my secret. I have just returned from their
council fires, with their full consent to do with you whatsoever I
please. Now you know the story."</p>

<p>"And what do you propose to do?" asked Kate, in trembling tones.</p>

<p>"Do!&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;why, marry you without a priest," rejoined
Moody, tauntingly. "I would not kill you, for that would be but slight
revenge."</p>

<p>"Great God! you do not, cannot mean this!" almost shrieked Kate,
endeavoring to rush past him to the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>"Nay," cried Moody, seizing hold of her roughly, "not so fast."</p>

<p>"Oh! let me go!&mdash;for God's sake, let me go! and I will forgive
you all that is past."</p>

<p>"Forgive!&mdash;ha, ha, ha! What think you I care for your
forgiveness? Let you go, indeed! after plunging my soul into crime to get
you here! Why, girl, are you mad, to talk thus?"</p>

<p>"Then kill me!" cried Kate, wildly. "Murder me, as you have murdered
my parents! I would rather die than be dishonored."</p>

<p>"And that is the very reason why I let you live," returned Moody, with
a dark smile of peculiar meaning. "No, no, Kate Clarendon,&mdash;
haughty, coquetting Kate&mdash;live to return to your lover."</p>

<p>"No! if I am disgraced, I never will return alive!" rejoined the fair
girl solemnly and firmly.</p>

<p>"Settle that matter with yourself, then," said Moody, coldly. "Mine
you shall be, living or dead!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the villain threw his arms boldly around the other, and,
in spite of her struggles, pressed her to his loathsome breast; while the
torch slipped from his hand, fell to the ground, and nearly became
extinguished by the fall&mdash;casting dark, flitting shadows over the
gloomy cavern.</p>

<p>For some time Kate struggled violently, and uttered one or two
piercing screams; then she suddenly became still, as though she thought
it were vain to longer contend with her evident destiny. Moody, surprised
at her sudden quietude, drew back to learn the cause, when the click of a
pistol, with the muzzle pointed at his heart, warned him, too late, of
his own imprudence. Kate had disengaged it from his belt during the
souffle, and now stood before him, erect, with flashing eyes and
dishevelled hair, which came streaming down around her pale features,
whereon was an expression of deep resolve, not to be mistaken.</p>

<p>As Moody's dark, malignant eye met hers, it involuntarily quailed
before that sublime gaze of wronged innocence.</p>

<p>"Villain, beware!" cried Kate, in a lofty tone. "Move but a single
step toward me, and your soul is with its God."</p>

<p>"Forbear!" cried the cowardly wretch, in a deprecating tone, fearful
that she might be tempted to pull the trigger, on which her delicate
finger seemed to rest heavily. "Forbear, Miss Clarendon, and you shall go
free."</p>

<p>"Swear it!" said Kate, solemnly and loftily.</p>

<p>"By every thing that yields me an existence, by my hopes of salvation,
I swear it!" returned Moody.</p>

<p>"See that you break not your oath!" rejoined Kate, retreating
backward, and still keeping the pistol elevated in the same position.
"Stand where you are, Rashton Moody! advance a single step, and I
fire."</p>

<p>Whether it was that Moody was afraid of being deprived of his own
worthless life&mdash;or whether, as is more probable, he thought by
remaining stationary something might chance to his advantage in disarming
his fair foe&mdash;we do not pretend to say; but certain it is, he
remained fixed as a pillar, while Kate retreated, until some fifteen
yards divided them, when, unguarded as to her course, with her eyes fixed
upon the other, she stepped upon a spot made slippery by the dripping
water, and the next moment fell heavily upon the ground. As she went
down, the pistol flew from her hand several feet, struck upon the rock,
and discharged itself, with a sound that ran bellowing to the remotest
corner of the cavern, and seemed the death-knell of her hopes. The sound
of the pistol was succeeded by a laugh that seemed not earthly, and
bounding forward, Moody stood erect over his prostrate and forlorn
captive.</p>

<p>"So, then, I have you again, eh?" he cried, exultingly. "This time I
will be more careful."</p>

<p>"Remember your oath," said Kate, timidly, attempting to regain her
feet.</p>

<p>"Oath he d&mdash;d!" shouted Moody, with another frightful laugh; and
again his hateful arms were thrown around the half-raised and trembling
form of the lovely but helpless Kate Clarendon. "Down!" he cried,
hoarsely; and at the word he forced her with violence back upon the
rock.</p>

<p>"God save me!" screamed Kate, terrified nearly out of her senses.</p>

<p>"He can't do it!" rejoined Moody, blasphemously, with a hellish grin
of savage joy.</p>

<p>"Liar!" shouted a strange voice, that made him start in terror, and
Kate scream with joy, as a bright light flashed in his face and revealed
to his astonished eyes the ungainly, and to him terrible, form of the
Necromancer, standing by his side, torch in hand, and looking downward
upon him with an awful scowl, his jaws working almost convulsively, and
his eyelid quivering like the leaf of the aspen; while several dim forms
were seen hurrying toward him from the mouth of the cave, and voices,
portending summary punishment, came to his frightened ears through the
arches of the great cavern in hollow and unearthly tones, making his
polluted soul almost shrink from its frail and much abused tenement of
clay.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_14">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h3>

<br>
 And when they talk of him, they shake their heads, <br>
And whisper one another in the ear; <br>
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist, <br>
And he that hears makes fearful action, <br>
With wrinkled brow, with nods, with rolling eyes.

<p>&mdash;Shakspeare.</p>

<p>We left Ernest Clifton and his companions, headed, or rather led, by
David Grant, in pursuit of the Indians&mdash;and to them we must now
return. For some eight or ten miles, they pursued their course up the
Miami in silence, with no event occurring worth being recorded. By this
time the mist, which we saw rising on their departure, had rolled itself
across the plain, and enveloped them in a cloud so dense, that not a
single object about them was visible. Still the scout, who had traveled
the ground frequently, moved onward, and the others, as best they could,
followed the sound of his footsteps.</p>

<p>At length Ernest, who was next to David, struck his foot against the
half-decayed trunk of a fallen tree, and fell over it&mdash;whereupon the
whole party came to a halt.</p>

<p>"It is useless to attempt further progress to night," said the young
officer, as he rose to his feet; "for nothing can be seen, and danger may
be in every step we take."</p>

<p>"As you like, lieutenant," returned the scout. "Foolisher advice might
be spoke; though I'm not afeard to lead, if you arn't to follow."</p>

<p>"But what good can come of it?" asked Clifton. "We might come upon the
camp of the enemy before we were aware of it."</p>

<p>"Nothing truer&mdash;though I reckon we'd stand as good a chance as
they," rejoined David.</p>

<p>"What say you, Danvers?" inquired Ernest. "Shall we go further or
not?"</p>

<p>"I would rather see the path I am following," answered the one
addressed.</p>

<p>"So would I. Let us camp, then, where we are, and take daylight for
it."</p>

<p>"Any body see a light?" inquired David, suddenly.</p>

<p>Each looked about him, and several answered. "No!"</p>

<p>"There's a sort o' dim spot away to the right, or my eyes make it,"
said the gardener.</p>

<p>"Your eyes don't make it, and that spot's fire," returned the scout,
laconically.</p>

<p>"Ha! now I see it!" exclaimed Clifton while his heart beat quickly,
with the hope that his beloved was near him. "It must be the camp-fire of
the savages."</p>

<p>"May be," returned the scout, "though I reckons not. But silence, and
let us diskiver."</p>

<p>Saying this, he moved slowly and softly forward, carefully feeling his
way as he went, followed by the others in the same manner. In a few
minutes they reached the Miami, and, as its water was now in a moderate
stage, crossed it without difficulty. As they neared the spot which had
attracted their attention, the pale, faint hue, as first seen, assumed a
deeper and redder tinge, and convinced all that the remark of the scout
was correct. Ascending the opposite bank of the Miami, they kept on their
course some dozen or so of yards, when they came to a steep ascent, and
saw the light but a short distance above them.</p>

<p>"Stand here, with rifles ready, and move not hand nor foot, while I go
for'ard first to make it out," whispered David; and without more ado, and
not even waiting a reply, he turned aside from the straight line, and
glided away, noiselessly as a spirit or an Indian.</p>

<p>Some ten minutes of breathless suspense elapsed, during which each of
the party behind grasped his rifle tightly, and listened eagerly for the
slightest sound to decide his next movement. All was fearfully silent;
for silence is fearful, when we look for the first sound to be one of
danger, calculated to drive the blood back to the heart&mdash; as when
two armies, facing each other, are quietly preparing the first terrible
volley of death&mdash;and each stood fast, motionless as marble, and
seemed to feel his hair fairly rising with excitement.</p>

<p>At length each started, on hearing the voice of David close at hand;
for not a sound of his approach had been audible.</p>

<p>"Follow," he said, in a whisper, "and I'll show you a curious
sight."</p>

<p>Obeying him in silence, each set forward up the ascent, and presently
gained the spot whence the light proceeded. Upon a broad, flatrock,
scarcely elevated above the ground, was a small, bright fire, made of dry
sticks, by the side of which, with his feet partly drawn under him, a
bible in his hand, on which his eyes were intently fixed, his long hair,
unrestrained, flowing freely down the sides of his coarse, rough
features, and over his shoulders, and swaying backward, and forward as
one engaged in profound study&mdash;sat Blind Luther, the Necromancer, on
whom each of the party gazed, if not with a feeling of superstition, at
least with something very much akin to it. And indeed the picture,
considering the principal figure and the mystery connected with him, was
well calculated to produce this effect. The light of the flame, as it
flashed and crackled, formed a bright circle in the dense fog, threw the
dark form of Luther into bold relief, and lent a ruddy tinge to his
harsh, but benevolent features&mdash; giving them, at the same time, an
appearance of rapid change in expression, by its flickering shadows.</p>

<p>For a moment or two, Luther sat in silence&mdash;while silently our
party gazed upon him&mdash;and then his voice was heard reading from the
book in his hand:</p>

<p>"`Wo unto the wicked!&mdash;it shall be ill with him; for the reward
of his hands shall be given him.'</p>

<p>"Even so," he continued, closing the book: "Even so shall it be:
therefore let them that are evil doers take heed unto their ways."</p>

<p>He ceased, and bowed his head upon his hands.</p>

<p>"We meet strangely again," said Clifton, stepping forward into the
circle of light, and tapping the shoulder of Luther with his hand.</p>

<p>Luther raised his head, without any apparent surprise, and frankly
extending his large, dark hand to the other, replied:</p>

<p>"I am glad to behold thee, young man, safe where thou art; for a
narrow chance hast thou had, in thy morning of life, of escaping that
yawning gulf which awaits us all. I said, you remember, we should meet
again,</p>

<p>"When dark storms should round us lower, Or bright sunshine puled the
hour.</p>

We meet, however, in the former&mdash; in the stormy hour of
fate&mdash;though I trust thy sun of life may not set behind a cloud."

<p>"God send it may not!" rejoined Clifton, earnestly.</p>

<p>"I perceive you are wounded," pursued Luther, pointing to the head of
the other: "I hope not severely."</p>

<p>"Nothing alarming, I think&mdash; though it does pain me a little,"
answered Clifton.</p>

<p>"A narrow escape, indeed," rejoined Luther. "It was a moment on which
your life hung suspended by a thread. It is over, and yet your life is
still in danger."</p>

<p>"What mean you?" asked our hero, in some surprise.</p>

<p>"God is great," replied the Necromaneer, solemnly, "and orders all
things for the best. When He made the stupendous work of creation, and
set the great wheels in motion, He made laws to govern each and every
part; and into man's hand gave the power of reading those laws to the
benefit of himself and the glorification of his Maker. Wherefore, man
telleth the time of the seasons, and looketh for heat and for cold, and
knoweth the motion of the planets, the moments of their revolving, and
the years of their cycle; and the laws which extend to them, do also unto
all created things; so that the pebble which rolls on the beach by the
wash of the tide, and the volcano which belcheth fire and causeth earth
to groan in her bowels, are alike governed by the fixed and eternal laws
of the universe; therefore, let not thy too hastily formed prejudice
condemn the truth, that the being and deeds of man are overruled by the
same laws, which by knowledge he may read and understand, but not
alter."</p>

<p>"If I comprehend you rightly, you are alluding to astrology?" observed
Clifton, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Call it by what name you will, it is the tongue of Heaven, whereby is
spoken the destiny of nations and individuals. Here," and the
Necromancer, thrusting his hand into his knapsack, drew forth a roll of
parchment: "Here is thy past and future course, signed and sealed; and
that of her thou lovest best, and that of him thou hatest most."</p>

<p>"Oh, speak, for God's sake! if you know aught, and tell me what of
her!" cried Ernest vehemently.</p>

<p>"She is safe for the present."</p>

<p>"Heaven be praised! Can you lead me to her?"</p>

<p>"I can, but not to-night."</p>

<p>"O, yes&mdash;to-night&mdash;delay not a moment!"</p>

<p>By this time the party without, eager to catch every look and tone,
had leaned their heads forward into the circle of light, while their
bodies remaining concealed entirely, or showing only a faint outline,
gave them the supernatural appearance of specters, or spirits, peering
through a cloud, as we sometimes see them represented on canvass. Without
making a direct reply, Luther pointed around the circle, and
observed:</p>

<p>"We are not alone."</p>

<p>"Do not fear," said Ernest; "they are all friends."</p>

<p>"Fear, Ernest Clifton? Nay," and he raised his hand majestically above
his head, and with his fore-finger pointed upward, while he paused a
moment, and then said, in a voice of great and impressive solemnity,
"there is but One to fear&mdash;fear Him always, and Him only! But see!"
he added; "I told thee thy destiny was written here;" and he pointed to
the scroll in his hand, which was covered with figures, letters and
characters. "This is thy horoscope&mdash;cast many years ago."</p>

<p>"But did you know me then?"</p>

<p>"Ay, before your knew yourself."</p>

<p>Heavens! explain!"</p>

<p>"Not now; another time and place must serve me. But you spoke of her
you love."</p>

<p>"I did. O, tell me where to find her, and if she be living and
safe!"</p>

<p>"For to-night she is safe&mdash;tomorrow I will lead thee to her."</p>

<p>"Is she a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"She is; but ask me no more, for I am done. To camp! to camp, all! and
be ready for the morrow. I will stand sentinel. Yet stay, Ernest," added
the Necromancer, as the latter turned away; "I must look to your wound.
You will find a suitable spot close at hand, in this direction," he said
to the others, pointing with his finger; and as they departed, he rose,
and removing the bandage from the head of Clifton, proceeded to examine
his wound attentively. Then taking a vial from his knapsack, he wet the
cloth with the liquid contained therein, and rubbed the wound with
it.</p>

<p>"It will trouble you but very little after this," he said, as he
carefully replaced the bandage." "And now, my young friend, join your
companions and get what rest you may."</p>

<p>Ernest would fain have questioned further, relative to her he loved;
but waving his hand peremptorily, Blind Luther turned his back upon him,
in a manner to cut off all conversation; and thinking it prudent not to
press the matter too much, he moved away and joined his com panions, who
had already selected their place of encampment, and started a fire in its
center.</p>

<p>Casting himself upon the earth, in a fit of gloomy abstraction, our
hero sat some two or three hours, watching the bright flame as it eagerly
devoured the dry fuel which fed it. During this time, one after another
of the party gradually fell into slumber, until he alone remained awake.
Turning his eyes toward the fire of Luther, he could just perceive the
dim outline of that mysterious being, seated upon the rock, his elbows
resting upon his nether limbs, his face upon his hands, and apparently
asleep. Gazing upon him for a while, during which a thousand vague
thoughts and conjectures passed through his mind, as to who or what he
was, what he knew of his own history, how he knew, and what he knew
regarding her he loved&mdash;he at last felt his eyes grow
heavy&mdash;strange objects, of which he was in chase, flitted before his
mind's vision&mdash;he swayed from side to side&mdash;nodded and partly
awoke&mdash;saw the light of the fire dimly&mdash;nodded a few times
more&mdash;and then all became dark, indistinct and confused, and he
rolled over upon the earth and slept.</p>

<p>"Up, and to thy journey!" said a deep voice that started Clifton from
his slumbers; and springing to his feet, he found Blind Luther and the
rest of his companions ready to depart.</p>

<p>It was already broad daylight, though the sun had not yet made his
appearance, owing to the dense fog which still clouded the earth. There
was, however, a brighter spot in the east than elsewhere, from which the
mist seemed hurrying rapidly, and rolling and tumbling from side to side,
as if eager to escape from the god of day, whose sharp, hot rays were
troubling severely its outer borders.</p>

<p>"Eat!" said Luther, emphatieally, to Ernest, proffering him some jerk,
roots and fruit, his own humble fare.</p>

<p>Ernest partook lightly of the first, but declined the others; and the
rest having eaten previously, the party prepared to set forward under the
guidance of Luther.</p>

<p>"'Spect I'm no more needed?" said David Grant, in a dissatisfied tone;
for he was anxious to make a display of his powers as a scout in trailing
the foe.</p>

<p>"You may as well keep us company, at all events," said Clifton.</p>

<p>"Your services may be needed," observed Luther.</p>

<p>David made no reply, and the party set forward.</p>

<p>Instead of descending to the valley, the Necromancer shaped his course
to the top of the ridge, along which he moved in silence with rapid
strides, followed by the others in the same manner. Here the fog had
already begun to disappear, and presently the sun broke through, bright
and glorious. Then, like some mighty avalanche, the mist was seen rolling
down toward the plain, over which it lay like a white shroud,
occasionally diversified and rendered doubly interesting by a beautiful
rainbow set on its brow, as it were a beacon of hope. Gradually it began
to drive and writhe and scatter, under the influence of the sun and the
morning breeze, and then first one tree and another began to show its
leafy top, as if rising from a beautiful lake, until at last the whole
vapor was swept away, and a scene resplendant in beauty broke upon the
eye.</p>

<p>Clifton, who had watched it intently as he proceeded on his jour ney,
felt his spirits revive to a wonderful degree, while something within
seemed to say:</p>

<p>"Behold in this a happy angury! As the night and the morning, so has
thy soul been shrouded in a vapor of gloom, through which no eye could
penetrate to see what lay beyond. As the mist has vanished before the god
of day, so shall thy troubles vanish before the bright star of thy
destiny; and thy path shall lead down to the grave, smooth, bright and
unclouded."</p>

<p>For a time Clifton was buoyed up with this feeling, and then he became
dejected and sad; for he remembered that she he loved was yet a
prisoner.</p>

<p>Throughout the day, Blind Luther said little to any&mdash;his mind
seemingly absorbed by some gloomy meditation. When questioned as to his
course, he ever replied that all was right. About noon, a fine buck was
killed, and the party halted for refreshment. After a delay of some two
hours, they resumed their journey, much invigorated.</p>

<p>Now whether it was that Luther had made a mistake in regard to the
exact location of the cave where Kate Clarendon was confined&mdash;or
whether he desired, for somereasons of his own, to delay their arrival to
a given time&mdash;does not appear; but certain it is, that though the
cave did not exceed a distance of twenty miles from where the party set
out in the morning, and though all traveled hard throughout the day, with
the exception of the delay spoken of&mdash;yet, from one reason or
another, they did not reach their journey's end till the last rays of the
setting sun had disappeared from the highest peak of the eastern
ridge.</p>

<p>"We are here at last," said Luther, leaping across the chasm to the
platform, over which, Moody had passed but a short time before. "Follow
me," he continued, "and carefully descend, or you will descend to rise no
more forever."</p>

<p>Saying this, he approached the side next the stream, when two or three
prolonged screams, seemingly issuing from the bowels of the earth,
greatly accelerated his movements, and nearly cost some of his followers
their lives. Hurrying down the rugged and perilous path before him,
Luther soon reached the mouth of the cavern, where he halted a moment to
guide Clifton, who came next, in the proper direction, and caution him to
look to his weapons. He then set forward again rapidly, and, just as he
reached the termination of the passage, heard the discharge of a pistol,
and saw a dark object flit before his eyes, and pause over something
white lying on the rock. The torch he perceived but a few paces distant,
and aware of the value of light in a case of such emergency he instantly
sprang to this, and thence to the rescue of Kate Clarendon, at a point of
time so all important to her as we have shown in the preceding
chapter.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_15">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h3>

<p>Thank God! we meet again.</p>

<br>
 What mystery is this, that makes mine eyes <br>
Grow full and large with wonderment? In truth <br>
Am I in deep amaze. <i>&mdash;Old Play.</i> <br>
 Go! go! and be a curse!&mdash;earth needs must bring <br>
Forth some; and none in damning deeds of villainy <br>
Can riper get than thou. Go! go! I loathe <br>
Thy sight, and feel a nervous itching <br>
In my fingers' ends to bid the stay forever. <i>&mdash;Ibid.</i>

<p>"Liar!" again shouted Luther, raising his tremendous frame to its full
height, and looking ferociously down upon Moody, who stood trembling like
a timid culprit before his august judge: "Liar and coward! how durst thou
so blaspheme, as to say the Almighty could not save yonder dove from thy
buzzard claws? Down with ye to repentance!" and with the back of his
hand, Luther struck Moody a blow in the face, that started forth a stream
of blood, and sent him reeling backward upon the rock.</p>

<p>"Is she alive&mdash;is she safe?&mdash;great God! is she safe?" cried
the voice of Clifton at this moment coming up, followed closely by his
companions.</p>

<p>"Ernest," screamed Kate, wildly, and she attempted to rise; but
overcome with emotions of joy, she failed, and sank back upon the
ground.</p>

<p>"Ha! that voice&mdash;that voice!" almost shrieked Clifton. "My God, I
thank thee! Kate, Kate!&mdash;my dearest, darling Kate!" and the next
moment he was by her side, and his lips were glued to hers, in the holy
kiss of love. "Kate," he continued, raising her up to a sitting posture
"Kate, are you safe and well?"</p>

<p>Kate could not speak for joy; but she nodded in the affirmative, and
then her head sunk against his breast, and she wept freely.</p>

<p>"The happiest moment of my life," marmured Clifton, pressing her close
to his heart&mdash;a noble and true heart, that beat only for her, and
would do so until it ceased to beat forever.</p>

<p>The balance of the party had by this time come up and gathered around
the lovers in joyful silence, their faces expressive of the satisfaction
they felt on seeing them meet again so happily. Luther stood a little
apart, with folded arms and stern countenance, apparently engaged in deep
thought of a nature not pleasing.</p>

<p>"Let me thank my deliverers, as well as you, dear Ernest," whispered
Kate, at length.</p>

<p>"Ay, do, dearest; and first, here," and Ernest pointed to the tall,
athletic form of the Necromancer, who&mdash;standing, as we have said,
with folded arms, from one hand of which projected the burning torch, its
flickering light casting a ruddy glow upon his harsh
features&mdash;seemed the personification of some prophet of old, about
to utter words that should cause a world to tremble.</p>

<p>As Kate advanced toward him, he suddenly turned in an opposite
direction, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Beware, villain&mdash;you have done enough!"</p>

<p>This was addressed to Moody, who, having been left unnoticed by all
save Luther, had regained his feet, and drawn his knife, preparatory to
executing some diabolical act; but the words and manner of Luther
arrested and caused him to shrink back in dismay.</p>

<p>"By heavens!" cried Ernest, springing forward, "in the excess of my
joy I had forgotten there was a renegade villain to punish;" and drawing
his sword, he was rushing upon his antagonist, when Luther grasped him by
the arm, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Hold, Ernest, it is not for thee&mdash; `Vengeance is mine, saith the
Lord, and I will repay.' "</p>

<p>"It's for me, then," cried Ichabod, who had been waiting an
opportunity to greet his pet, and who now remembered his words to
Clifton, on the death of Clarendon: "It's for me, for I've sworn to kill
him whenever I found him;" and before any one could interfere, he bounded
toward Moody, who, sullen and ferocious as a wild beast at bay, now
turned upon him a look of scorn, as if he considered him beneath his
notice. He had, however, mistaken the character of Ichabod entirely, as
he soon found to his cost; for the next moment a bright light flashed in
his eyes, and the crack of a pistol was heard echoing through the
cavern.</p>

<p>"Ah! I am shot," exclaimed Moody, gnashing his teeth in fury, and
placing his hand to his shoulder, from which a stream of blood could now
be seen trickling down over his garments. "But I yet live to be
revenged," he cried; and at the same moment he made a step forward, and
drew from his belt his undischarged pistol. Before he could use it,
however, the hand of Luther was upon his throat, and the pistol wrenched
from his hand and sent bounding upon the rock to the furthermost part of
the cave. His knife and tomahawk shared the same fate, and Moody stood
trembling and unarmed, while the rest looked on in silence.</p>

<p>"Wretch!" cried Luther, raising himself to his full height, and
casting upon Moody a look of scorn: "Wretch! I am tempted to crush thee
where thou standest, for thy villiany and blasphemy; but I spare thee
now, and now only. Remember&mdash; remember!"</p>

<p>"Nay," interposed Clifton, "why spare him for other deeds of villiany?
Is not his base life already forfeited!"</p>

<p>"Ernest Clifton, methinks I have rendered thee and thine some
service," answered Luther.</p>

<p>"You have&mdash;you have, sir&mdash;beyond our power to repay!"
returned Clifton, vehemently.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps I am not wrong in asking a boon?"</p>

<p>"Anything in my power to grant, or that of my comrades, I pledge you
my honor you shall have."</p>

<p>"Enough! 'tis here;" and Luther tapped Moody on the shoulder. "I ask
his life, to do with him as I may see proper."</p>

<p>"What say you, comrades?" asked Clifton, appealing to the others.</p>

<p>There was some demurring, but all at length consented to the request
of Luther. Then turning to Moody, the latter said:<br>
 "Villian, beware, nor further go,<br>
Or thine shall be a doom of woe!<br>
From all thy former thoughts relent,<br>
For all thy deeds how down, repent,<br>
And show all here a contrite heart,<br>
Or thou and I must ever part:<br>
And should I leave thee, thou shalt feel<br>
Death and the Fates have set their seal.</p>

<p>"I await thy answer," added Luther, in conclusion.</p>

<p>"Set me free, is all I ask," growled Moody.</p>

<p>"And thou wilt seek my aid no more!" returned Luther.</p>

<p>"I never did seek it," grumbled Moody; "and once free again, I will
ask no odds of any."</p>

<p>"Be it so!" rejoined Luther, musingly. "Yet stay," he added, laying
hold of Moody as he turned to depart. "I am ever loth to yield up human
nature to the foul fiend&mdash; the arch-enemy of mankind. One trial
more, and perhaps thou wilt repent and be reclaimed&mdash;if not,
farewell forever!</p>

<p>Then pausing for a few moments, as if to collect his thoughts, he
resumed, in a grave voice:<br>
 "A stream there was, which long had rolled<br>
Its waters over sands of gold,<br>
And in the sportive sunbeams played,<br>
And wantoned in the pleasant shade&mdash;<br>
As full of active life and glee,<br>
It bent its course toward the sea.<br>
At length the stream received a shock,<br>
Its waters parted on a rock,<br>
And so divided there by force,<br>
Each arm sought out another course;<br>
And miles they ran o'er sterile ground,<br>
Ere either branch the other found;<br>
At last they met, yet little knew<br>
That from the self-same source they grew.</p>

<p>"The stream," continued the Necromancer, looking alternately at Moody
and Clifton, and addressing himself to both, "is typical of your
ancestors; the rock is a quarrel, by which they became estranged&mdash;
the meeting of the waters, the meeting of the brothers, the last of a
noble line."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" exclaimed Clifton, as some strange thoughts flashed
through his mind; "what do these words import?"</p>

<p>"That Ernest Clifton and Rashton Moody are twin brothers."</p>

<p>"'Tis false!" cried Moody. "This is some trick&mdash;some device!"</p>

<p>"The proof is under the left arm of each," returned Luther, quietly.
"Look there, and you will find my words have not been lies."</p>

<p>An examination was instantly made, and the result verified the words
of Luther; for under the left arm of each was found, faintly traced in
blue lines, a coat of arms, which being compared one with the other,
proved to be exactly alike. A murmur of surprise and astonishment now ran
around the excited group, while Kate elasped her hands together in a kind
of dreamy bewilderment.</p>

<p>"This is very strange&mdash;very strange!" said Clifton, fixing his
eyes steadily upon Luther. "And pray, sir, who are you?"</p>

<p>"A man that is born of woman, whose days are short and full of
trouble," answered Luther, waving his hand in his usually majestic
manner, and turning his eyes from Clifton to Moody, who stood grating his
teeth, with an angry frown upon his brow.</p>

<p>"And so he is my brother, then?" pursued Clifton, musingly, turning
also toward Moody.</p>

<p>"Brother be d&mdash;d!" roared Moody. "If I am, I'll live to triumph
over you yet, Mr. Clifton."</p>

<p>"Nay," interposed Luther, sternly, approaching and laying his hand
upon Moody: "Nay, be not too fast! I was wrong to think that he who could
so act the villian and miscreant, had any right to the ties of kindred
and home. His sentence rests with me, does it not?" he added, appealing
to the rest.</p>

<p>"It does&mdash;it does," cried all.</p>

<p>"Hear me then," rejoined Luther, raising his hands in a menacing
attitude. " `As ye sow, so shall ye reap.' I banish thee, Albert Bel
lington&mdash;alias, Rashton Moody&mdash; forever from among the race of
civilized men. I curse and send thee forth, a murderer upon the face of
the earth&mdash;a companion for the savage and wild beast&mdash;never to
hear the sweet voice of sympathy more! All trace that thou wert nobly
born is hereby removed."</p>

<p>As Luther spoke, he took from his knapsack some thongs of deerskin,
and, in spite of the resistance of Moody, bound him fast, hand and foot.
Then casting him upon his side, he drew his knife, and deliberately cut
the tattooed skin from under his arm.</p>

<p>"Now go!" he cried, releasing him: "Go! be a murderer and mendicant
upon the face of the earth, and let the knowledge of thy crimes, of what
thou hast lost, and thy guilty conscience be thy punishment! Cross never
my path again&mdash;or I will deliver thee up to justice. Farewell!
Farewell!&mdash; Henceforth I know thee no more&mdash; no more!" and
waving his hand, he turned away his face, as if to shut the other from
his sight.</p>

<p>For a moment Moody stood like a goaded tiger, gnashing his teeth in
fury; then muttering, "I will yet be revenged!" he darted swiftly
away.</p>

<p>"He will trouble us again, I fear," said Danvers.</p>

<p>"Then the consequences rest with himself," rejoined Luther. "I have
done, and shall not interfere again between him and justice."</p>

<p>"Who are you, mysterious being?" exclaimed Ernest, approaching Luther;
"and whence come you? I am all amazement."</p>

<p>Luther drew his tall, ungainly person up to its full height, and
quietly folding his arms upon his breast, replied:<br>
 "Go and ask the stars above,<br>
Why their hours are meet for love&mdash;<br>
Go and ask the moon so bright,<br>
Why she silvers o'er the night&mdash;<br>
Go and ask the sun on high,<br>
Why his glories fill the sky&mdash;<br>
If they answer, so will I.</p>

<p>"Like vain, presumptious mortals," continued Luther, you seek to know
too much.</p>

<br>
 "Who I am, or whence I came, <br>
What my purpose, or my name, <br>
 Matters are which Fates have sealed, <br>
Not by me to be revealed. <br>
When the eighth moon is in wane, <br>
And the earth is green again, <br>
If among the living then, <br>
Thou shalt happiest be of men&mdash; <br>
Thou shalt clasp her by thy side, <br>
Truly thine, thy wedded bride; <br>
Then, I charge thee, not before, <br>
Open this, thou shalt know more!"

<p>As he concluded, Luther placed in the hands of Ernest a small silver
box, on which were wrought some strange characters.</p>

<p>"This is all very mysterious," said Clifton, gazing first at the box,
and then at the donor. "I cannot comprehend it."</p>

<p>"It is like a beautiful dream," whispered Kate, stealing up to the
side of Ernest, and laying her soft, white hand on his arm, with a look
of affection. "It is&mdash;" She was about to continue her remarks, but
stopped suddenly, uttered a frightful scream, and threw herself in front
of Ernest, as if to shield him from danger.</p>

<p>Each started, and looked for the cause of her alarm, when crack went a
pistol just in front of Clifton, the ball of which slightly grazed his
cheek.</p>

<p>"Perdition seize ye!" cried the voice of Moody, hoarse with passion;
and at the same moment his form was seen disappearing thro' the narrow
passage leading out of the cave. On his former retreat, he had found the
pistol discharged by Kate, had loaded it, and returned to take his last
revenge.</p>

<p>"I 'spected as much," said Ichabod, snatching up a rifle. "If I failed
afore, it's no sign I will this time;" and he darted away in pursuit of
Moody, followed by most of the others, Clifton himself remaining by the
side of Kate.</p>

<p>A short silence succeeded the tramping of feet on the floor of the
cavern, and then came the report of a rifle. Presently Danvers joined the
party in the cave.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Clifton, addressing him as he entered.</p>

<p>"He will never trouble us again, I think," answered Danvers.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" asked Ernest, gravely.</p>

<p>"It is hard to say; but hear and judge for yourself. He had just
reached the rock arching the stream, and was turning to ascend the rocky
bank, when Ichabod, with a hasty aim, fired. For a moment Moody paused,
balanced in the air, and then, with a horrible yell, disappeared over the
verge of the abyss. A dull, hollow sound came up from below, and then all
was still."</p>

<p>A brief silence succeeded this announcement, when Ernest said,
solemnly:</p>

<p>"So perish the wicked."</p>

<p>"Amen!" responded a deep, heavy voice, that seemed to descend from the
ceiling of the cave.</p>

<p>Clifton and his companions started, and looked upward, but saw nothing
save the bare rock.</p>

<p>"Why, where is Luther?" exclaimed Kate, at this moment, looking round
her in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Heavens! he has disappeared again!" rejoined Clifton, pointing to the
burning torch, one end of which was sticking fast in a crevice of the
rock: "I could have sworn he was standing here when I spoke."</p>

<p>"And so could I," returned Kate, shuddering, and pressing closer to
the side of Clifton, who threw his arms around her slender form, and drew
her to his heart, with all the fond affection of an ardent lover.</p>

<p>"Never fear, sweet one," he whispered, bending down and stealing a
kiss: "whatever he may be in reality, he seems a being ordained by Heaven
to stand between thee and harm; and for that I bless him now and ever
will hereafter."</p>

<p>Great was the wonder and excitement of the rest of the party, when,
returning into the cave, they were informed of the sudden and mysterious
disappearance of Luther; for none had seen him, and all were willing to
swear he had not passed out the way he entered. Ichabod declared,
however, that the smoke of his rifle, when he fired at Moody, had assumed
a terrible shape; and now he remembered it strangely resembled the
Necromancer; though how the smoke and that singular personage could be in
any wise alike, or connected, exceeded his comprehension.</p>

<p>The mystery now became a matter of grave discussion; some declaring
that Luther was an evil spirit, whose term on earth expired with the
death of Moody; and others, among whom were Clifton and Kate, contending
that both were bona fide beings of flesh and blood, though the former was
a very strange character, whom they could not comprehend. One observation
brought another, and the discussion seemed likely to be protracted all
night, when Clifton ordered a sentinel to be stationed in the passage
before spoken of, and the rest to retire to rest, that they might be
prepared for their return on the following day.</p>

<p>What took place during the night we shall now proceed to relate.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_16">CHAPTER XV.</a></h3>

<p>A fearful, gloomy place.</p>

<p>&mdash;****</p>

<p>The hell of waters.</p>

<p>&mdash;Byron.</p>

<p>When sorrows come, they come not single spies, But in battalions.</p>

<p>&mdash;Shakspeare,<br>
 Thereat he smitten was with great affright,<br>
 And trembling terror did his heart appall,<br>
Nor wist he what to think of that same sight,<br>
 Nor what to say, nor what to do at all.</p>

<p>&mdash;Spenser.</p>

<p>Aghast he stood, Stiffened with fear.</p>

<p>&mdash;Somerville.</p>

<p>The account given by Danvers, of the disappearance of Moody, was
correct; but his conjecture that he had been wounded by the last fire of
Ichabod was not. At the time when Moody rushed out of the cave, followed
by those who sought his life, objects at a short distance had become
indistinct, in the dark grey twilight which had already settled over the
earth. In consequence of this, the gardener missed his mark; but the
report of the rifle, and the whizzing of its ball within an inch of his
head, caused Moody to start suddenly, when his foot slipped, his balance
was lost, and he plunged down the chasm, with a horrible yell, expecting
of course to be dashed to pieces on the rocks below. A deep pool of
water, which had been hollowed out by the fall of a cascade, saved him.
Into this he fell with a force that for a moment stunned and confused
him; but quickly regaining his senses, he struck out boldly, and
succeeded in crawling upon a rock, that formed a partial barrier to the
outlet of the pool. This, however, was not affected without difficulty
and repeated trials; for the spray from the cascade, that tumbled over a
precipice a short distance behind him, had coated the rock with a slimy
substance, and made it slippery as an iceberg.</p>

<p>Seating himself at last upon the rock, with as much composure as he
could assume, after having been so signally thwarted in his dark schme,
he instantly set his head to plotting the best means by which he could
yet retrieve what he had lost, and revenge himself for the new
indignities that had been heaped upon him.</p>

<p>"They think me dead of course," he muttered to himself; "and well they
may, after pitching me into such a dark, dungeon-like thundering hole as
this; but I'll show them I am not thus easily put out of the way. It is
well as it is, for now they will think themselves safe, and thus give me
the better chance to make sure plans and take them unawares. A curse on
that old juggler, who has thwarted my designs so often! By &mdash;! I'll
soon have his old scalp where it will not trouble <i>me</i>
again&mdash;that is if he is mortal," he added, in an under tone,
endeavoring to peer around him into the darkness, as if fearful that he
of whom he spoke might somehow mysteriously make his appearance, as he
had more than once done before.</p>

<p>"Who and what can he be any how?" he continued, after a moment's
pause. "There is something wonderful about him, I must own; and even the
savages fear, and respect him, and call him Great Medicine. And what does
he know of me, and how did he obtain his knowledge? By heavens! the more
I think and see of him, the more mysterious he seems. Can it be that what
he said was true? I would not believe it, but that I saw, with my own
eyes, the mark under my left arm. There can be no denying that, at all
events&mdash;unless (and Moody paused and mused, as one who doubts and
yet is inclined to believe)&mdash;unless he by some strange magic power
made it to appear there for the time. At all events," he added, fiercely,
"it is gone now, and the flesh with it, as I can sorely feel; and man or
devil, by&mdash;! I'll have my revenge on him yet, or die in the
attempt.</p>

<p>"He says I am brother to Clifton&mdash; twin brother," resumed the
outcast, after another short pause. "May be I am, or <i>was</i>&mdash;(on
the last word he laid particular emphasis)&mdash; or was, I say&mdash;for
now that the totem is removed, we are brothers no longer. Besides, he has
done enough to alienate me from him without this. A curse on him," he
fairly shouted, "brother or no brother, for crossing me in my love! For
this&mdash;for <i>this</i> I would have revenge, though his claim to the
fraternal tie were never so well proven, and though I had called him
brother all my life. Ah! my shoulder&mdash; a curse too, on that
gardener!&mdash; but I'll have all settled ere long. Now to get out of
this infernal place; for infernal it seems, and dark as the regions of
the damned. I am wet and chilly, and my wound feels painful. Let me once
get out of this place, and I trust my dusky brethren may be easily found,
even if they have moved their camp."</p>

<p>Saying this, he slid down from the rock into the water, on the side
opposite that which he had ascended on emerging from the pool. It was not
deep&mdash;not more than five inches at the most&mdash;but a rather
abrupt declivity gave it an impetus that sent it foaming and roaring over
the rocks in its course to the plain below, and rendered it highly
dangerous footing, even in daylight; for a slip, or on unguarded step,
would in all probability plunge the adventurer down its jagged path, and
dash him to pieces; and consequently it was none the less perilons now,
when night and the overhanging cliffs had shrouded it in darkness, where
nothing could be seen save an occasional fire-like flash from the angry,
hissing, boiling, frothy surges.</p>

<p>Moody at once comprehended his danger, and his heart beat fast and
hard against his breast, and sometimes seemed to rise in his very throat;
so much was he, who under ordinary circumstances feared not death, awed
by the gloom and peril of his present situation.</p>

<p>"I should not boast of my escape yet," he said to himself; "for death
assuredly stares me in the face, and presents his most unwelcome
aspect."</p>

<p>Carefully feeling his way, he now moved to one side of the narrow
channel, and laid his hand upon the rock, in hopes of finding some means
of ascending the cliff, or keeping along upon its bank. None was found.
The cliff, as high as he could reach, was perpendicular, and slippery as
glass. He crossed the channel, and found the opposite cliff the same.
There was nothing left for him but to go down the bed of the stream, and
accordingly he began to do so, keeping hold of the rock, to steady
himself as best he could over the slimy stones and treacherous ground
beneath his feet.</p>

<p>For some time he continued his descent slowly, without meeting any
difficulty worthy of notice. He had already advanced a hundred yards, and
was beginning to congratulate himself on his second escape, when his ears
were saluted with a faint, dull, roaring sound, like the fall of a heavy
body of water. He paused in dismay, and listened. He could hear it
distinctly, above the more shallow roaring, if we may so express it, of
the torrent rushing past. He comprehended the fearful truth, and again
his heart died within him, and he would have sunk down in despair, had he
not feared the awful denouement would be hastened by quitting his hold of
the rock. Ahead of him was certainly another cascade, the the brow of
which he was nearing at every step, and down which he must assuredly
plunge&mdash;or, what was equally as terrifying, remain imprisoned where
he was.</p>

<p>For some moments he stood irresolute what to do, during which his
extreme agony of mind caused a cold perspiration to ooze from every pore
of his skin. For almost the first time in his life of guilt he tried to
pray; but the words stuck in his throat, and seemed to choke him. Death,
now that he had felt so confident of escape, rose up before him in all
its terrors. Despair at last took the place of hope and foar, and he was
on the point of throwing himself flat-wise on the current, and trusting
the rest to chance, when a new idea struck him, and he suddenly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What a fool I am to get frightened at imaginary terrors! How do I
know there is not a way to pass these falls without going down with the
water?"</p>

<p>Saying this, his courage revived, and he again moved forward with
renewed hope. Nearer and nearer he drew to the falls, and louder and
louder came up the sullen roar of the waters. At last he stood upon the
verge of the precipice, and, with the utmost difficulty, prevented his
feet from being drawn down into the unknown chasm, by the force of the
rapids. He carefully felt of the rock to which he clung, but, to his
disappointment, could find no broken or craggy places to aid him in his
descent. All, as before, was upright, smooth and solid, save occasionally
a little crag that made a hold for his fingers. Again hope died, and he
secretly wished for that great change which his guilty soul shrunk to
encounter. What was to be done? He could not long remain where he was,
for his efforts to keep himself there had already tired his arms, and
weakened him not a little. At last he decided to retrace his steps, until
he should come to an easier footing, and there, if possible, hold out
till daylight should enable him to devise some means of escape.</p>

<p>Accordingly, with great caution, and at the risk of his life, he moved
up the stream some fifty yards, when he came to a place where the rock
slightly jutted out, so that he could place his body against it, and rest
somewhat comfortably. Here he determined on remaining till
morning&mdash;or, at all events, until the moon, which was a little past
her full, had arisen sufficiently to light up his gloomy abode.</p>

<p>Terrible were the thoughts that now crowded the mind of this dark man.
Alone, as it were in the bowels of the earth, with dangers on every hand,
he was thus forced to think and feel as he had never done before; and as,
unless under similar circumstances, he might never do again. It is one
thing to face death in the heat of strife, when all the faculties of the
mind are turned into the channel of self-defense, ambition, glory or
revenge&mdash; when thoughts of the great hereafter are lost in the wild,
frenzied passions of the moment&mdash;and another to contemplate it in
silence, alone, away from aught that can distract the mind. Men talk of
heroes&mdash; of courage on the field of battle&mdash;where everything is
calculated to excite, intoxicate, bewilder, and draw them forward to they
know not what, nor have time nor power to know; but this is no more to be
compared to that moral courage which can meet death calmly in solitude,
than is the wild blustering of a drunken man to what one coolly and
firmly asserts in sober reason. The one is the bravery of the animal
merely, without the action of the mind; the other, the courage of the
mind, without the action of the body.</p>

<p>In proof of this, how often do we hear of men, who, amid the carnage
of the ensanguined field, have rushed up reckless, fearless of all
danger, to the belching cannon's mouth, placing their lives as if by
choice in the greatest jeopardry, and thus winning laurels of courage to
bind their brows forever, and make them model heroes for future
ages&mdash; shrinking back in their calm, sober moments, like some timid
boy, from the near approach of death.</p>

<p>Of this last class was Moody. Under the influence of excitement and
passion, he was brave, so far as animal courage goes, as the bravest; but
take these away, as in the present instance, and he became at once the
veriest coward on earth.</p>

<p>There is ever something awful in contemplating death, when all the
energies and reasoning powers of the mind are in full blast; when we see
and feel that we are slowly, but surely, hastening to that dread change
which all must undergo, but of which no one knoweth that hath a being in
the mortal state; when we are throwing off this earthly coil, bidding a
last farewell to scenes and friends of which we have a knowledge, and, it
may be, "flying to other ills that we know not of."</p>

<p>Moody now had time for grave contemplation; and, moreover, was forced
to it by surrounding circumstances. Cold and wet, he leaned against the
rock and thought of the past&mdash;of his life of sin and crime&mdash;
and something like remorse harrowed up his guilty soul. How much better,
he felt, it would have been, had his course been upright and honest; had
he lived a life of virtue, and, with the talents he possessed, and the
advantages which had been given him, been a shining ornament to society,
instead of a disgrace and curse. He thought of the awful fate which
seemed to be hanging over him, and the little chance he had of escaping
it; and his soul fairly shrunk at the possibility of what he might meet
in the dread Beyond. He had been taught pious words in his youth&mdash;
he had read the Bible&mdash;and, in spite of his reckless, awful career,
he believed there was a Heaven for the good, and a Hell for the wicked;
and it needed no argument, he felt, to prove to which he belonged. Death
now had terrors, that death seemed never to have had before; and he
quaked and trembled where he stood like the guilty thing he was.</p>

<p>Minute succeeded minute, and hours had already elapsed, ere the moon
had sufficiently risen to throw her silvery rays down the steep rocks on
to the foaming flood in which Moody still remained. As soon as her bright
light fell upon the waters, the outeast thought best to make another
trial for his life. Accordingly, he changed his position, and again
descended toward the cascade. When within ten feet of the precipice, over
which the water tumbled, he fancied he saw a ruggedness in the opposite
rock that might enable him to climb to the summit, and thus avoid the
falls altogether. His heart bounded at the thought; and, regardless of
the risk he ran, he at once set out to ford the stream. When about half
way across, his feet struck against a rock&mdash;he
stumbled&mdash;fell&mdash;and the next moment the boiling surge had borne
him to the brow of the awful precipice. There was no help now; all hope
of escape was cut off; and throwing himself as much as possible into an
upright position, as he passed the verge, he uttered one prayer, "God
save me!" and disappeared&mdash; down&mdash;down&mdash;into the hell of
waters below.</p>

<p>That man has an appointed time to die, might be strongly argued from
the fact, that we every day witness, in a greater or less degree, what
men undergo and live; and yet how little it requires, when their time has
come, to cut the brittle thread of life, and launch them into the
incomprehensible eternity. Had we time and space, we might cite numerous
instances that have come to our own knowledge, where men have undergone
tenfold the agonies of death have been given over by skillful
physicians&mdash;have been wept as dead&mdash;who have recovered and
lived, as it were to show a miracle to the world&mdash;and yet have died
at last, by the simplest of all ailments, a cold, or a scratch of the
finger. That such cases are of common occurrence, we all know; but
wherefore, is one of those great mysteries by which the Creator designs
to work out his own ends; and the best lesson we can draw from them is,
that we should at all times be ready for the uncertainty of life.</p>

<p>By the common phrase, that "his time had not come," we must account
for the wonderful preservation of Moody in the present instance. His
chance of escape, unharmed, was in the ratio of one to a
million&mdash;and yet he escaped. In the exact spot where he went down,
was an immense depth of water&mdash;a pool, not unlike the one above,
though much smaller; which, like that, too, had been hollowed out by the
eternal wear of the cascade. It was small, as we have said, and on every
side surrounded by rocks. The falls were some thirty feet in height; and
there was only one spot which presented the possibility of escape, and
but one means of reaching it. This spot, by means of which he was at the
time unconscious, Moody gained. It will be recollected, as he went over
the verge of the precipice, he managed to take an upright position. As
luck would have it, the exertion which he made in doing so, sent him
clear of the main body of the stream, and he went down just outside of
the falling sheet. Standing perpendicular, his feet struck square upon
the surface of the pool, while the force with which he descendod
instantly buried him far below. A re-action took place, and his head soon
rose far above the water. With great presence of mind he grappled a rock,
and the next moment was safe, and had an opportunity of perceiving how
near he had been to the jaws of death.</p>

<p>Had he gone down <i>in</i> the cur rent instead of <i>out</i> of
it&mdash;had he fallen flatwise&mdash;had he varied a foot&mdash;or, in
fact, had he not passed over the falls exactly in the place and manner he
did, he must assuredly have been dashed to pieces upon the surrounding
rocks. A direct Providence, it seemed, alone save him; and, for a time,
something like a feeling of gratitude to the Guardian of his destiny,
held a place in his breast; and he gazed around him in silent awe. But,
as generally happens with those whose hearts are hardened past
redemption, no sooner did he realize that he was actually safe, than his
wild, vindictive feelings gained the ascendancy, and he was fain to
attribute to his own presence of mind, what should have been yielded to a
Higher Power.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" he laughed, at length, rather impiously; "why should I
fear death? Do I not always escape, even where escape seems impossible? I
have nothing to fear&mdash;my good fortune will carry me though all
extremes."</p>

<p>With this he rose, and, ascending the bank, which was here not
difficult to climb, descended to the plain. Pausing a moment in an open
spot, where the moon shone full upon his dark countenance, displaying
there a grim smile, he turned, and was quickly buried in the surrounding
forest.</p>

<p>Presumptuous fool! How little did he know of what the future had in
store for him!</p>

<p>To council now, and vengeance then?</p>

<p>&mdash;Anos.</p>

<p>Some five miles higher up the Miami, and within a few yards of the
stream itself, was encamped, on the night of the events detailed, a band
of warriors. Their camp, however, was very simple. A small fire was
burning on a smooth plat, around which, with their feet centering toward
the flame, lay extended some eight or ten dark figures,
asleep&mdash;apparently so, at least&mdash;over which the flickering and
sombre light cast wild, fantastic shadows. The party had not even taken
the precaution to station sentinels&mdash; a proof that they felt
themselves perfectly secure. They were in the Indian country, where all
the tribes were friendly to each other, and afar, as they imagined, from
the whites, their only enemies. 'Tis, true, they had been on the war-path
against the latter, and some of their garments were yet stained with the
blood of recent victims; while, at the girdles of two, hung fresh scalps.
It was natural to suppose they would be followed, yet they seemed to have
no fears&mdash;fancying doubtless, that they were now either too far
distant to be overtaken immediately, or that their foes were too
unskillful on the trail to find them; and the more so, that they had
broken it for miles by passing up the bed of the river. Thus they slept
in security&mdash; not as soundly, perhaps, as they would have done in
their own cabins, but sufficiently sound to answer all the purposes of
nature, in refreshing their wearied bodies&mdash; while the waning moon,
riding high in the heavens, poured down over all her flood of mellow
light,and partially dimmed the glare of the fire of their camp.</p>

<p>It was not far from the meridian of night when a tall figure glided
among the trees, and stealthily approached them. When within ten yards,
he halted, examined them at tentively, and then, as if satisfied all was
right, advanced boldly toward the circle. Even this last movement seemed
unheeded, tho' one or two turned and moved their limbs, as if troubled by
some unpleasant dream; and one actually went through the motions of
taking the scalp.</p>

<p>"Warriors on the war-path," said the voice of the figure, speaking in
the Shawance dialect, "I am surprised to find you sleeping without a
sentinel!"</p>

<p>At the first sound of the speaker's voice, each Indian sprang to his
feet in surp rise, and laid his hand upon the rifle by his side, ready
for defense.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" ejaculated most of the warriors, as their eyes fell upon the
speaker, while the grasp upon their weapons gradually relaxed, and they
stood still, as if waiting to hear further.</p>

<p>"Brothers," continued Moody, for he it was, "you sleep too soundly on
the war-path, and might have been surprised by the pale-faces."</p>

<p>"Does my brother know of danger, that he thus chides us?" asked a
tall, fierce looking savage, who appeared to be one possessed of
authority.</p>

<p>"There is always danger when foes are in pursuit," replied Moody.</p>

<p>"Are the pale-faces then on our trail?" inquired the other, a fierce
gleam of satisfaction shooting athwart his dark visage.</p>

<p>"They are within five miles of us?" answered Moody, "and have
possessed themselves of the bird which I caught in my snare."</p>

<p>The hand of each was again placed upon a weapon, and each turned to
the other a startled look of inquiry, but no one replied. After a silence
of perhaps a minute, the one who had first addressed Moody, rejoined:</p>

<p>"Will my brother explain? or does danger press?"</p>

<p>As Moody apprehended no danger himself, he briefly narrated such of
the events already known to the reader as he thought most likely to rouse
the ire of his swarthy companions, and induce them to enter into his
plans&mdash;carefully avoiding, however, any mention of Luther, who was
known personally, or by report, to all present, and feared as a Great
Medicine, to contend with whom would be useless&mdash;their superstitious
fears magnifying him into a supernatural being, directly under the
influence and guidance of the Great Spirit.</p>

<p>"You have heard," said Moody, in conclusion, glancing round upon his
auditors, and noting with satisfaction, the involuntary tightening of
their hands upon their rifles, the gleaming of their eyes, and the
dilating of their mostrils, the only signs, indicative of their intense
interest in his recital. No one replied; and after a silence of some
moments, Moody resumed, in a rather impatient tone:</p>

<p>"I trust, my brothers, you are not turning squaws. That you
<i>have</i> been brave, these eyes have seen, and this tongue can bear
witness. Are you ready for the war-path again?&mdash;or are your knives
and hatchets dull, and your powder wet? Speak! for Posetha would
know."</p>

<p>"My brother," replied Mugwa, the spokesman on the part of the Indians,
"is hasty. Posetha should remember an Indian must always take time to
consider before he adopts a new plan. We have been on the war-path toward
the south, and our faces are now set to the north. Before we change our
course, we must hold council."</p>

<p>"Then, by&mdash;! let it be speedily!" growled Moody, in English,
making use of an oath. "If you don't choose to accompany me soon, I shall
go alone; for be revenged I will, though it cost me my life."</p>

<p>As this was said in a low tone, and in a language which the best among
them but imperfectly understood, it of course elicited no remark. Each,
however, noted the manner of Moody, and saw that he was dissatisfied; but
even this failed to bring out a single comment, so accustomed were the
Indians to silence, when any important question was pending. Having
seated themselves around the fire, Mugwa now slowly produced a pipe,
which he filled, and lighted, smoked a short time in silence, and passed
to his neighbor; who, imitating his example, smoked and passed it to the
next; and thus it went around the circle, Moody merely drawing a few
whiffs, to comply as briefly as possible with the Indian council
custom.</p>

<p>When the last smoker had done, and a sufficient pause had succeeded,
Mugwa rose and said:</p>

<p>"The ears of the Piquas are now open to the words of the pale-face
chief. Let my brother lay before them his plans, that they may consider
if they be wise."</p>

<p>"Brothers," rejoined Moody, rising as the other sat down, "my words
shall be few, and to the point; for my tongue is parched and thirsty for
blood, and my limbs are weary and stiff with long watching in the bowels
of the earth. Brothers, I was made your chief, and we have been upon the
war-path together&mdash; not unsuccessfully, as yonder trophies bear
witness." Here he pointed to the two scalps before mentioned, one of
which was dangling from the belt of Mugwa. "Brothers," he continued, "on
that war-path all were brave, and fought as became warriors, until
prudence, the gift of the wise, bade them retire. On that war-path
Posetha caught a dove, and had her caged, and then went and consulted his
brothers, and asked, and they generously gave him, permission to do with
her as he might see proper. Brothers, Posetha returned to the cage where
he had left his dove, and there he found her, and was happy, until the
vultures of pale-faces came and snatched her away, and set upon him, and
nearly picked out his eyes. Brothers, Posetha would have
revenge!&mdash;he would have the bones of the pale-faces whiten in the
open air, while their scalps dry in the cabins of his red friends!
Brothers, if you are ambitious, now is the time to distinguish
yourselves, and carry home trophies that shall please the Great Spirit,
and send your names down by tradition to far posterity. The pale-faces
will be unguarded; they think the "Cat" is dead; and they can be taken
unawares, and conquered without a blow. Brothers, if you are willing,
Posetha will lead you to a cover, where your enemies will pass unguarded,
and can all be made your prisoners for the torture, or their scalps can
be taken on the spot. Brothers, I have only one reserve to make: the dove
must not be harmed; she is mine, and I must have her to coo in my wigwam.
Brothers, I am done, and wait your answers."</p>

<p>Moody sat down, and a deep silence succeeded. Each savage remained as
stern and motionless as marble, with his eyes fixed upon the fire,
apparently in a dreamy, con templative mood. At length Mugwa motioned for
the pipe; and on its being handed him, he refilled it, smoked a little,
and passed it to his neighbor; and thus it went around the circle again,
in silence, not a single warrior having opened his lips. After another
brief pause, whereby each seemed determined to give his neighbor a
chance, Mugwa, chief of the Indians, arose. We say chief, for although
Moody was nominally so, yet Mugwa had more direct command over the
savages than the other.</p>

<p>For a moment or two, Mugwa ran his eyes over the group before him, as
we sometimes see an orator, when he desires to make an impression, and
draw exclusive attention to himself. He was a tall, powerful warrior, and
in his paint looked sufficiently ferocious to entitle him to his
appellation of the "Bear," or please the vanity of a savage. His eyes
were black and fiery, and a look of cunning and brutality formed the
prevailing expression of his features.</p>

<p>"Brothers," he said at length, "you have heard the words of Posetha;
to Mugwa they seem wise and good. There seems a chance for more trophies.
A chance to take new vengeance on this hated race, that are fast usurping
our own and the hunting grounds of our fathers. Soon shall we be forced
toward the setting sun, unless our hands are continually died in their
blood. They will over-run and cover the land we tread on as the leaves in
the autumn. If a viper creep into our wigwam, do we not crush it, lest it
do us harm?&mdash;and yet were the ground thick with vipers, instead of
pale-faces, we should have reason to rejoice. Brothers, on this war-path
we have done well&mdash;shall we not do better? Shall we not please our
squaws and young men, by bringing them prisoners to torture? When we take
the scalps of our enemies, the Great Spirit is pleased&mdash;shall we
not, then, please the Great Spirit? The voice of Mugwa says `Yes!' Who
says `No?' Let me hear?"</p>

<p>Here Mugwa sat down, amid grunts of approbation from his savage
auditors. Another profound silence of some minutes succeeded, when a
warrior rose.</p>

<p>"Unkee," he said, "has heard the words of the great chiefs, and he
thinks them wise. In the lodge of Unkee are a squaw and three pappooses.
When he returns, they will ask to see his trophies. Unkee has nothing to
show. Their faces will be sad. Unkee would have them glad. The great
chiefs have pointed out a way. Unkee is pleased, and he thinks the chiefs
wise. He is done."</p>

<p>Saying this, the last speaker quietly resumed his seat. But enough had
been said. There was no further need of grave deliberation. The minds of
all had become fully settled. Their passions had been wrought upon, and
they were ready for deeds of blood. Suddenly some two or three warriors
sprang to their feet, and uttered the scalp halloo. Others followed their
example. The matter was soon decided, and the council over. Water was now
brought and thrown upon the fire; belts were tightened; weapons put in
their proper places; and the announcement was made that all was
ready.</p>

<p>"Follow!" said Moody; and taking his way across a small open plat, he
was soon buried in a dense thicket. One after another, to the number of
ten dark warriors, trod in his steps, and, disappearing, left the scene
of the late council silent and deserted.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_19">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h3>

<p>Still in doubt, and still perplexed, The more we search, the more
we're vexed.</p>

 <i>Brinley's Rescue.</i>

<p>"Daylight!" exclaimed the voice of the sentinel, who had been
stationed to keep watch in the cave; and the word was heard echoing far
away to the most distant recesses.</p>

<p>This was the signal for the party to be astir; and Clifton, who was
encamped upon the ground nearest the speaker, instantly sprang to his
feet, and, without communicating with any, at once took his way to the
mouth of the cave. It was a beautiful morning, and, unlike the one
preceding it, the atmosphere was clear and without mist. A few crimson
streaks in the east, and a dull, leaden gray color that had settled over
the earth, announced that day was already dawning. In the west, the
waning moon could still be seen; but its light appeared pale and sickly,
as it mingled with that of the coming day, which was soon to supersede it
altogether. All was pleasant and serene, with no cloud to mar the broad,
blue canopy above. A heavy dew had fallen during the night, and was now
reposing, in silvery drops, upon the rocks, and the leaves of a few
bushes which grew around the entrance of the cave, and overhung the
stream that roared and foamed far below. The air was cool and bracing,
and a light breeze hore to the ear of our hero the songs of several
warblers, which had commenced their morning's roundelay.</p>

<p>As Clifton stood and gazed around him in the pale light, and saw the
beauties of the morning, he could not shake off a feeling of sadness that
had taken possession of his soul. The events of the already departing
night, now came up before him like a dream. His mind instantly reverted
to the strange revelations of Luther, and he thought how mysterious were
the ways of Providence. Could it be that Moody was his brother?&mdash;and
if so, how wonderful that they should meet as foes in the great
wilderness! Could it be, too, that both were nobly born!&mdash;and if so,
how singular that he should be thus left to grow up in ignorance of a
fact so important. It might be true, he felt for he had never known
father nor mother. He had been reared and educated by a New England
family, until the age of eighteen, when he had been told it rested with
him to choose his occupation for life. He had chosen the army, and had
been placed in a military school; since when, by the aid of some unknown
friend, he had been advanced to the rank and station he now held. He had
often made inquiries concerning his parents, but could never learn
further, than that they were supposed to be dead, and that he was
indebted for all his favors to a strange benefactor, whom he had never
seen, and perhaps never would. Might not this benefactor be Luther? He
had let fall words to such an effect, by stating that he knew him before
he knew himself. The secret was doubtless contained in the silver box
which that wonderful being had placed in his hands, and he was sorely
tempted to break it open and know at once; but the request to the
contrary, until Kate should have become his wife, restrained him.</p>

<p>Who was Luther? and how did he manage to make all fear him, and bring
about his purposes so mysteriously? What did his last strange words
portend? And Moo dy, too&mdash;if he was indeed his brother, although he
amply merited death, how much rather he would have had him live, perhaps
to repent and reform. But it was too late now. He was gone. He had
perished by the hand of another; and even now his mutilated remains
might, perchance, be laying on the rocks below.</p>

<p>As these thoughts passed rapidly through the mind of Clifton, he
approached the spot where Moody was last seen by the party at the cave,
and, taking hold of some stunted bushes that grew upon the verge of the
chasm, endeavored to peer down into the gloomy abyss. It was still too
dark to see aught, save here and there a fire-flash of the water, as it
dashed over the rocks, and sent up its hollow roar; and Clifton quickly
drew back, with a shudder. As he did so, a soft hand was laid upon his
arm. He turned, and beheld the idol of his heart, the lovely Kate
Clarendon, standing by his side, her features pale and sad, and her eyes
slightly dimmed by a pearly tear.</p>

<p>"Ah! dearest," exclaimed Ernest, throwing an arm around, and drawing
her to his beating heart; "you are troubled; I can see it in your sweet
countenance."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of my dear, dear mother," returned Kate, simply; and
unable to control her emotion longer, she buried her head upon the breast
of him she loved and wept freely.</p>

<p>Clifton was moved, and it was sometime ere he could command his own
feelings so as to answer calmly.</p>

<p>"Do not weep, dearest," he said, at length; "your mother is now an
angel in Heaven."</p>

<p>"I know it," rejoined Kate, with a fresh burst of grief. "She is
better off now, than when in this cold world of sorrow; but then it is so
hard to part from those we love."</p>

<p>"It is, indeed," returned Clifton, sadly, gazing upon her with a look
of affection, and thinking of the moment when he might be called to part
from her, or she from him, by the same woful messenger, death. "It is
indeed hard to part from those we love, dear Kate; and God send the time
be far distant, ere it be the trial of either of us again! But, dearest
Kate," he pursued, consolingly, "even had nature taken its course, you
would soon have been an orphan; and you should try to be resigned, that
your mother has escaped all the anguish of a lingering death of pain.
Though horrible, her death was easy; and her sweet spirit winged its
flight, without knowing the cause that separated it from its clayey
tenement."</p>

<p>"I do try to be resigned," Kate replied; "but still, dear Ernest, I
must grieve, and weep, for I am only a poor human being after all."</p>

<p>"In that, of course, you do but what is right," said Ernest, tenderly;
"and tears are a great relief to the overcharged spirit." Then, musing
for a moment, he resumed: "I, too, feel somewhat sad. I have been
pondering over various matters, and at the moment when you touched my
arm, I was peering down the chasm, expecting to behold my brother's
remains&mdash;but it was too dark."</p>

<p>"O, do not call him brother," said Kate, earnestly; do not, dear
Ernest! for he was everything that is wicked and base; while you, on the
contrary, are everything that is noble and good. I am sure you cannot be
brothers; I will not have you so."</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Clifton, musingly,; "it is all very
mysterious. He was a dark man, it is true&mdash;a terrible man&mdash;a
man, in fact, of crime and blood; but, whatever his crimes, he is now
most probably before that Great Tribunal, where he will have to answer
for himself, and be judged accordingly. I ought not to forgive him, and
yet my heart rather yearns to do so. I saw him last night in my dreams,
and methought he had repented and called me brother. I awoke feeling sad,
and without saying a word to any, I arose and came hither."</p>

<p>"I saw you," replied Kate; "for when the sentinel spoke, I had been
long awake; and I rose and followed you."</p>

<p>"You did not rest well, then, my dearest Kate?"</p>

<p>"But indifferently," replied the other; "for, between my hard bed and
ten thousand thoughts that came crowding one after another upon me, I was
not long in the arms of Morpheus."</p>

<p>"I fear you will not be able to endure the journey, after such a
feverish rest."</p>

<p>"O, I think I shall, for I am strong and well."</p>

<p>"By the way, dearest, tell me how you came here, what became of the
savages, and what happened after I saw you?"</p>

<p>"I was conducted here by Moody; what became of the Indians, I do not
know; and what happened, I will tell you some other time; for I see our
friends are coming this way."</p>

<p>As she spoke, Kate pointed toward the mouth of the cave; and turning,
Clifton perceived Danvers, David and Ichabod issuing therefrom</p>

<p>"A beautiful day, for our homeward journey," remarked Danvers,
approaching the lovers.</p>

<p>"It is indeed," answered Clifton; `and I trust, ere night, we shall
once more be safe among our friends."</p>

<p>"Had we not better partake of some refreshment, and set out as soon as
possible?" asked Danvers, in reply.</p>

<p>"There is a very heavy dew," answered the young officer, "and the
bushes are very wet; so that perhaps we had better wait until the sun has
well risen. I think we shall then have sufficient time; for although
Luther led us a long way, I do not think we are more than twenty-five, or
at most thirty, miles from the settlement, by the course of the
river."</p>

<p>"Well, as you like," rejoined Danvers; "though, for one, I am anxious
to be moving; for we do not know what may happen if we stay here."</p>

<p>"Have you any reason to think the place unsafe?" inquired Kate, rather
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know," replied Danvers. "It is most probably known to
the Indians, and they may come hither in search of Moody&mdash; which
result, to say the least, would be unpleasant."</p>

<p>"True," answered Clifton, musingly: "You are right, Danvers; I did not
think of that. Upon second thoughts, perhaps we had better leave at
once."</p>

<p>"Second thoughts is generally the wisest," put in David, coming up to
the party, in company with Ichabod.</p>

<p>"Then you, too, think it not safe here?" said Kate, addressing the
scout.</p>

<p>"Don't know, o' course," replied David; "but some how I can't git it
out o' my head, that Moody arn't dead."</p>

<p>Each started, and turned to ward the speaker a look of inquiry.</p>

<p>"Fact!" returned David, quietly.</p>

<p>"What reason have you for so thinking?" queried Clifton, in a manner
that showed he, too, might think it possible.</p>

<p>"Can't give no reason," answered David; "unless it's cause he seemed
to have as many lives as a cat, and that I dreampt about 'im last
night."</p>

<p>"And pray what did you dream?"</p>

<p>"That he'd got away, and had all the Injins arter us."</p>

<p>"I do not think that can be," rejoined Danvers; "for if not mortally
wounded by the fire of Ichabod, I think his fall must have done the
rest."</p>

<p>"May be you forgit how he's mixed up with the Necromancer," observed
the scout, glancing round him cautiously, in a way to show that he at
least was not devoid of a feeling of superstition common to most,
particularly the uneducated, of that day. "Blind Luther, you know, wanted
to save him; and I 'spect, from what I seed of him, that he could do it
easy enough."</p>

<p>Clifton smiled.</p>

<p>"Do not give him more power than he would claim for himself," he said,
in a tone calculated to dispel all fears on that point. "Luther has said
he was nothing more than mortal, and I believe him; though I own some of
his doings look a little mysterious; but doubtless they could all be
accounted for very simply."</p>

<p>"May be you can account for 'em, then," rejoined David, somewhat
testily: "I can't."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said the gardener.</p>

<p>By this time the rest of the party had joined the speakers, and
learning the subject of their conversation, most of them took sides with
the scout.</p>

<p>"At all events," said Danvers, who seemed a little staggered, and
hardly knowing which side to join, though rather inclined to take part
with Clifton: "At all events, if we can see his body lying on the rocks
below, we may believe our eyes."</p>

<p>"Yes, if you can find 'im there, I'll gin in," returned David; "but
take my word for't, you won't."</p>

<p>"I looked down a short time since," observed Clifton, "but it was then
too dark&mdash;it is lighter now."</p>

<p>In fact day had been steadily advancing, and the dull gray of morning
had already given place to a clear, sober light, by which each object
could be distinctly seen. The crimson of the east had gradually changed
to a more bright and yellow hue, and there was conclusive evidence that
the great luminary of the day would soon show his welcome visage above
the eastern horizon. Each of the party, Kate excepted, now approached the
verge of the abyss, and cautiously peered down into the chasm. The light
here was dim, but still sufficient for the purpose required. A small pool
was immediately under them, into one part of which fell the cascade
before mentioned, with a sort of gloomy roar. The outlines of the rock,
on which Moody had held his soliloquy, could also be
traced&mdash;appearing in the meagre light, to the excited imaginations
of most, as the demon or evil genii of the place&mdash;beyond which the
water foamed, and rushed, and roared continually. Besides these nothing
of importance could be noted, save that the rocks on either side were
almost smooth, perpendicular, and slimy.</p>

<p>"He is not there, at all events," said Danvers, as, after gazing down
some five minutes, he, with most of the party, drew back.</p>

<p>"I told ye so," returned David, triumphautly. "He's gone, and afore
you know it, will have the Injins upon us, sure as cats jump for
game."</p>

<p>"I do not think so," said Clifton. "That we cannot see his body, is no
evidence he is not dead."</p>

<p>"But 'sposing we could see his body there, it'd be the best evidence
that he arn't no where else," rejoined David&mdash;who, having got the
notion in his head, and being of a rather dogged disposition, was now
fully determined that Moody should be alive, that he might prove himself
correct in his surmises. We see a great many David Grants every day.</p>

<p>"You say true, David," answered Clifton, smiling, "that if the body of
my brother, as Luther called him, was there, it would not be elsewhere;
but I am astonished, David, that a man of your reputation as a scout,
should resort to a logic so shallow, to conceal what your good sense
tells you is the true state of the matter. That Moody is not there, every
one can see; and that he could not be there, you know as well as I; for
no dead body could long remain stationary in that rushing current. If you
follow down the stream, you will doubtless find his remains somewhere,
and dead enough in all conscience."</p>

<p>David hung his head, a little ashamed; for he saw at once that his
shallow reasoning was not likely to give him any extra reputation for
wisdom; yet determined not to yield the point too easy, or, in sooth,
until forced from it by stubborn fact, he replied, a little sullenly:</p>

<p>"As I'd like to be sure he's dead, may be it 'd be no harm in looking
along further down."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Clifton; who, for two reasons, wished to find the body
of his brother. First, to destroy that superstitious fear, which he now,
to his regret, perceived was fast getting a hold on the minds of all,
Danvers not excepted; and secondly, that he might, in a rude way, give
him Christian burial.</p>

<p>"Kate," he continued, turning to her, "you had better go into the cave
and take some refreshment."</p>

<p>"But, dear Ernest&mdash;" began Kate, timidly.</p>

<p>"Have no fears, sweet one; we are only going a short distance, to
search for the body of Moody, and will soon return. Besides, Ichabod,
here, will stay and keep you company."</p>

<p>"O, most sartinly," answered the gardener, his small eyes brightening
with delight; "nothing couldn't suit me better; and I'll go with my litle
pet straightway."</p>

<p>As no further objection was preferred by Kate, Clifton now ascended
the difficult path, which led up the brow of the cliff, followed by
David, Danvers, and the others, in silence. Reaching the platform before
noticed, the party at once leaped across the narrowchasm on the opposite
side, and kept along the hill for some two hundred yards, when they came
to a spot sufficiently shelving to enable them to descend to the plain
below. This, however, was not their immediate design&mdash;that being to
approach the stream at the foot of the precipice, and continue, if
possible, along its margin, so as to note distinctly every object in its
bed. In a few minutes the brink of the stream was gained, at the point
where the second cascade was formed, and where, it will be remembered,
Moody had such a narrow escape. A large rock, which here jutted in toward
the opposite bank, almost over the falls, allowed such as chose to
venture out upon it, a complete view of the current from the lower to the
upper cascade, and also the whole extent of the stream below the falls to
the plain, where it again became lost in its serpentine course toward the
Little Miami.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think now?" asked Clifton of the scout, as with the
latter he ventured upon the rock, and made an examination with his eyes
in both directions.</p>

<p>"Why, I think we han't found the body yet," replied David,
laconically.</p>

<p>"True; but don't you see there was no chance for Moody to escape with
life. The rocks above here are precipitious and slippery, so that it is
impossible he should have ascended them, even if he escaped with life in
the first instance; and certainly no sensible man would contend that he
could go over this fall and not be dashed to pieces on those frowning
rocks."</p>

<p>It did in truth appear, viewing the spot from where our party stood,
as if no being could pass the cascade and survive the fall; for the pool,
into which it will be remembered Moody descended, was very
small&mdash;the depth they could not know&mdash;and entirely surrounded
by black rocks, on which much of the water fell with a force sufficient
to throw a fine spray to the distance of several feet. We can only
account for this small, deep pool, by supposing that, at one time, the
water fell directly into it; and the earth just at that spot, not being
protected by rocks, as was the case elsewhere, had gradually been
hollowed out, and so remained; while the running water, wearing away the
precipice over which it tumbled, had thus caused it to recede several
inches.</p>

<p>"Don't know about passing the falls," said David, rather doggedly, in
reply to Clifton, after having gazed upon the spot until he felt
satisfied himself that the young officer was right: "Don't know about the
falls, one way or t'other; but all I've got to say is, I'd just like to
see the body."</p>

<p>"Do you know, David," said Clifton, smiling, "that I think you would
make a good preacher."</p>

<p>"How so, lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"Because you would be bound to stick to your text. Why, man, if you
had never shown any more sense in the forest, than you have in this
matter, instead of being called a great scout, you would have been
devoured by wolves."</p>

<p>Several of the party laughed, at David's expense, who merely shrugged
his shoulders, as much as to say, "You will see in time who is
right."</p>

<p>"Well," answered Clifton, "as the body is not hereabouts, we will
search for it below, on the plain; and speedily, too&mdash;for I see the
sun is peeping over the hill yonder, and we must soon be on our journey
homeward."</p>

<p>The party now descended to the plain, and in a few minutes were deeply
engaged in searching along the banks of the stream, for the body of one,
who, even at that moment, was plotting their own destruction. They had
entered a swampy thicket, where the water moved sluggishly, and each was
engaged with a pole in raking the bottom for the body, which they
supposed must have sunk there&mdash; when suddenly a faint scream was
heard in the distance, and, at the same moment, ere any one had time for
thought or action, fierce yells resounded on all sides, and each found
himself in the grasp of a powerful savage.</p>

 <i>[Old Play.</i>

<p>We left the Indians, on their return to harrass, murder, or capture
the whites, under the guidance of Moody. As it was impossible to know
what course the latter party would take, on leaving the cave&mdash;
though in all probability they would forthwith seek the plain&mdash;Moody
at once led his warriors to a dense thicket, where they might be able to
watch the movements of their foes, and shape their proceedings
accordingly. As chance would have it, he had selected the very thicket
where we have seen our friends venture to search for his
body&mdash;little dreaming, at the time, that they were entering an
ambuscade. This thicket, Moody and his party had reached, stealthily,
some two hours before day-break, when, in company with Unkee, a renowned
scout or runner, he had left the main body there, and set off to
reconnoiter, and gain intelligence that should determine his future
movements. Fearfullest his intended victims might have already escaped,
he had, at some risk, approached the cave, and even ventured into it far
enough to hear the tread of the sentinel, as he paced to to and fro on
his patrol of duty. Satisfied that all was working to his desire, he had
then noiselessly glided away, and, with his Indian companion, had sought
out a convenient cover to await daylight, and take advantage of
circumstances.</p>

<p>Unlike the Indians, who in general have little to say, Moody knew that
the whites, feeling perfectly secure, would naturally talk over their
plans, before proceeding to put them in execution. Nor had he been
mistaken. From his place of concealment, on the brow of the upper
precipice, which the reader will remember walled the platform on the
east, he had been enabled, by being exactly over the mouth of the cave,
not only to see every one that came out, but also to understand every
word that had been spoken outside. With infinite delight he had heard the
remarks of David, and watched the party searching for his remains in the
chasm below; and when the proposition had been made to continue down the
stream until his body should be found, his exultation knew no bounds.</p>

<p>"They shall find my body," he said to himself; "but in a different
form and place from what they expect."</p>

<p>Then turning to Unkee, he briefly recounted, in a whisper; the
substance of what he had overheard, and dispatched him to inform the
Indians, and caution them to remain concealed where they were, until the
whites, as he foresaw they would, should have put themselves in their
power.</p>

<p>Just as Unkee was on the point of leaving, Moody heard Clifton request
Kate to enter the cave, with only Ichabod for her companion; and turning
once more to the savage, while his eyes gleamed like two balls of fire at
his anticipated feast of vengeance, he gave him orders to avoid the
whites, and return to the mouth of the cave, there to await a signal from
him, or be guided by circumstances&mdash;but do what he might, in no case
to harm the pale-face maiden.</p>

<p>Had Moody been granted the privilege and power of arranging every
thing for his premeditated vengeance to suit himself, he felt confident
he would have failed in fixing matters as satisfactorily as a simple
train of circumstances had now done for him. Not the least important of
all, was the absence of Luther, which he had learned from the
conversation, and which otherwise must have disconcerted his plans
materially.</p>

<p>As soon as Unkee was gone, and he had seen the party of Clifton on the
point of starting, he withdrew from his place of concealment, and moving
along the ridge of the hill a short distance, descended on the eastern
side, some seventy-five or a hundred yards, or until he came to a small
cluster of bushes. Here he paused for a moment, while a grim smile played
over his features&mdash; and then parting the bushes with his hands, he
exposed to view a hole of some two feet in diameter, that apparently led
deep into the earth. Without stopping to examine this, Moody threw
himself flatwise upon the ground, and soon disappeared into the aperture.
The descent of the hole was just sufficient to render his movements easy,
and in less than two minutes, he had penetrated the hill some fifty feet.
Here the aperture gradually enlarged, and he was shortly enabled to crawl
along upon his hands and knees. This he did, some ten feet further, when
he came to a sort of window, that looked directly into the cavern so
lately occupied by our friends.</p>

<p>Here, then, was an access to the cave, of which Clifton and his party
knew nothing&mdash;otherwise, the disappearance of Luther might have been
accounted for without setting the natural laws of reason at defiance.
Luther, who took advantage of every circumstance calculated to heighten
the superstitious feeling which he was aware pervaded the minds of most,
had doubtless visited this place before, and knowing of this outlet, had
taken this means, when the attention of each was drawn in another
direction, to leave his friends in his usually abrupt and mysterious
manner. Had he <i>not</i> known of this outlet, it is hardly probable he
would have found it so opportunely; for being in a distant and dark
corner of the cave, ten chances to one but it had been completely
overlooked by any one on the search for it&mdash;so nicely did the
aperture, which was some four feet above the floor of the cave, blend in
color and appearance with the solid rocks surrounding it. How this became
known to both Luther and Moody, will perhaps forever remain a
mystery.</p>

<p>Stopping at this aperture or window&mdash;as, from its shape, we have
perhaps more appropriately named it&mdash;the keen eyes of Moody roved
around the dark vault, in search of Kate and the gardener, neither of
whom had as yet made their appearance. From his position, Moody could now
see everything in the cave, and yet himself remain unseen. This was owing
to the feeble light, which, coming through the fissure of the cave, was
sufficient to illume somewhat its immediate vicinity, but insufficient to
remove the dense vail of darkness behind which he was concealed.</p>

<p>Nearly half an hour elapsed, and Moody was becoming impatient, when
voices were heard, and presently Kate and Ichabod appeared, entering the
cave from the larger and more usual outlet.</p>

<p>"O, the torch is out," exclaimed Kate, as she came in view of the
interior; "and it seems so dark and gloomy here&mdash;let us go back,
Icha."</p>

<p>"Better stay here, my little pet, until they comes back," answered the
gardener; "'cause he said so, and I know as how you'd like to mind him;
and besides, I reckon 't an't burnt out, and I can light it agin in a
minute."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Icha; I can soon get used to the darkness; in fact, I can
see a little now; and it is better, perhaps, that we remain concealed, in
case anything should happen."</p>

<p>"Why, I hope you don't think there's any danger, my little pet?"
rejoined Ichabod.</p>

<p>"Why, no, I hope there is none&mdash; but then you heard what David
said."</p>

<p>"True, replied Ichabod, who was strongly inclined to believe in the
marvelous: "True, Miss Kate, I heerd what he said, and it made me feel
queer at the time&mdash;'cause I remembered as how, when I fired, the
smoke took the shape of Luther, and I thought maybe he was a spirit, and
got away in that way, and had something to do with Moody. But since I've
thought it all over, I know it could'nt ha' been so; for if ever I shot
any body in my life, it was that same infernal scoundrel Moody."</p>

<p>"I am not superstitious, Icha," answered Kate, "and consequently do
not fear the interference of Luther in any unnatural manner; though, I
must own, he did leave here mysteriously; but then, in all probability,
there was a way for him to get out in a very simple manner; and when dear
Ernest returns (Kate did not fear to apply endearing epithets before the
simple-minded gardener), I intend he shall search the cave for another
outlet. All I fear is, that Moody might, somehow, have managed to escape
alone and unaided, and that he will return with the Indians to murder or
make us prisoners."</p>

<p>"I don't generally miss my mark," said Ichabod, in reply; "and if that
Necromancer didn't interfere, I'm sartain I killed him&mdash;just as
sartain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hark!" interrupted Kate, holding up her plump, snowy hand, and
bending her head forward in a listening attitude; "methought I heard a
noise."</p>

<p>"It wasn't nothing, I reckons," returned the gardener, after a short
pause, during which he had listened and peered cautiously about him. "It
wasn't nothing, I reckons, but your fears. I've often got skeered the
same way, when I've been alone, and a thinking about danger&mdash;though
I never knowed anything to come on't. Well, as I's a saying 'bout that
villain Moody, I know I killed him, just as sartain as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I kill you now," said a deep voice in his ear; and at the same moment
a tremendous blow on the head laid the gardener senseless on the
ground.</p>

<p>Kate uttered a terrible scream, and sprang back in real terror.</p>

<p>"Moody!" she shrieked, "can the grave give up its dead? are you really
flesh and blood? or do you hold a charmed life?"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Moody, triumphantly; "and so, my pretty bird, I
have caught you again, have I? Well, `every dog must have his day,' you
know."</p>

<p>As Moody said this, he walked forward, as if to take hold of Kate, who
retreated, screaming, "Help! help!" in the most piteous tones
imaginable.</p>

<p>"Spare your lungs, my pretty dove," said Moody, with a coarse laugh;
"for you will need them to plead for your friends; besides, screaming is
hard work, and can do you no good." Saying which, he darted quickly
forward and grasped her by the arm.</p>

<p>"Villain! unhand me!" cried Kate, terrified and indignant. "Unhand me,
and begone! or there will soon be those here to make you tremble."</p>

<p>"Never you fear for me, my pretty one; I am perfectly aware of what I
am doing," replied Moody, with another coarse laugh; "and as for your
friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well&mdash;what of them?" cried Kate, breathlessly, as the
other paused.</p>

<p>"They are by this time all dead, or prisoners," concluded Moody, with
another laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" exclaimed poor Kate, burying her face in her hands, while
her whole frame shook convulsively.</p>

<p>Moody now released his hold, and folding his arms upon his breast,
stood, for some moments, regarding his terrified captive in stern
silence&mdash; during which time, many wild, dark thoughts, concerning
the punishment of her and her lover, passed through his mind. These
moments had nigh proved his last; for, regaining his senses, and
perceiving how matters were, Ichabod had drawn his knife from its sheath,
and creeping up stealthily behind Moody, was just in the act of plunging
it into his back, when his arms were suddenly grasped from behind, the
knife was wrenched from his hands, and he found himself the prisoner of a
fierce savage.</p>

<p>Moody started, turned, and comprehending all at a glance, said,
quietly, in Shawanoe:</p>

<p>"Unkee, you have saved my life, and I shall not soon forget it."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" returned the Indian. "Unkee always thought great chief more
guarded."</p>

<p>"He's only a squaw," returned Moody, contemptuously, pointing to
Ichabod. "I knocked him down first and then forgot him. True, he might
have taken my life; and so might a squaw, with the same opportunity. I
must deal with him, nevertheless; for twice has he shot at me before
this, and wounded me once in the shoulder. Bind him, Unkee!"</p>

<p>The Indian proceeded to obey his superior, with that sort of dogged
coolness, if we may so express it, which one might be supposed to
exercise in fastening a rope to a log. Once, and once only, when Ichabod
had nearly effected his escape, the eyes of the Indian brightened with a
fierce gleam, and his hand, involuntarily as it were, sought his
tomahawk; but the next moment his countenance assumed its wonted, stolid
expression, and he continued his occupation as coolly as ever.</p>

<p>Since quitting Moody, Unkee had obeyed his orders, and returned some
minutes before. On cautiously making his appearance in the vicinity of
the cave, he had discovered Kate and Ichabod conversing together
outside&mdash;for, as the reader is aware, they did not immediately enter
the cave on the departure of Clifton&mdash;and as he knew that to be seen
was to give the alarm, he instantly concealed himself where he could
secretly watch their movements. He had seen them enter at last, and,
after waiting what he conceived to be a sufficient length of time, had
stealthily approached. At the moment when he gained the mouth of the
cave, the scream of Kate reached his ears. The rest the reader knows.</p>

<p>Having crossed the arms of Ichahod on his back, secured them there
with strong ligatures of deerskin, and disarmed him altogether, Unkee
turned to Moody, with a grunt, as much as to say, "What next?"</p>

<p>So at least the latter interpreted it, and answered:</p>

<p>"Keep him a close prisoner, Unkee, and we will presently join our
companions."</p>

<p>Then turning to Kate, who still stood with her face buried in her
hands, regardless of what was taking place around her, he added, in
English, somewhat sternly:</p>

<p>"Come, my fair beauty, and I will conduct you to your friends, and
then I will tell you more."</p>

<p>Kate, who knew that resistance would be of no avail, as would neither
sighs, tears nor prayers, raised her face, and exhibited features as
calm, and apparently as rigid, as marble. As her eye for the first time
fell upon the savage, there was a slight start, and look of alarm; but
this quickly passed; and she again appeared as cold and indifferent as a
bronze statue.</p>

<p>Moody gazed upon her with surprise, for he had expected to hear her
shriek in terror; and from that moment, all his former plans of vengeance
were changed to others, that would, perhaps, prove none the less
agreeable to the fair being before him. Her beauty, heightened as it was
by the excitement under which she was inwardly laboring, and her strong
mind, as shown in her manner of concealing her feelings, revived his old
passion, and he had already determined that she should grace his wigwam
in the capacity of a wife or squaw. There is something in real beauty,
that rarely fails to appeal to the passions, if not to the heart, of
those who oppress it; and to this it is more than probable that Kate
Clarendon owed her honor, if not her life.</p>

<p>Nothing of this, however, was told to Kate, who, in consequence,
remained in terrible suspense as to what would be her doom. Turning to
the Indian, Moody motioned him to follow with his prisoner; and then
taking Kate by the hand, with something of more respect than he had
formerly displayed, he quietly led her out of the cave&mdash;she making
not the least resistance. When the captors and their captives had gained
the clear sunlight&mdash;which now fell warmly over the earth, drying up
the dew, and silvering the streams, kissing the flowers, and making the
earth appear beautiful&mdash; Moody motioned with one hand for Kate to
ascend the rude staircase to the platform above; and still keeping his
hold with the other, he assisted her up the difficult acclivity. Unkee
and his prisoner followed, and in a few minutes both parties stood upon
the point whence they could command a view of all below.</p>

<p>Gazing around him, and settling his eye at last upon a particular
spot, Moody stood for a moment, and then pointing forward with his
finger, as if to indicate the way, he led Kate across the chasm,
accompanied by the other two, and all together descended the ridge in
silence.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_21">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h3>

<p>In struggling with misfortune lies the proof Of Virtue.</p>

[Shakspeare. <br>
 Thou shalt behold him stretch'd in all the agomes <br>
Of a tormenting and a shameful death. <br>
His bleeding bowels, and his broken limbs, <br>
Insulted o'er by a vile, butchering villain. [Otway.

<p>We left Clifton and his friends in a rather serious predicament, and
to them we must now return. The attention of the whites, as the reader is
aware, was solely directed to finding the body of Moody; and this will
account for their being taken so wholly unguarded; though it may be
questioned if they would not have been taken equally by surprise, had
they been keenly on the look-out for savages&mdash;so effectually had the
latter secreted themselves in the thicket. Had they suspected an
ambuscade, however, their hands and weapons would have been ready for the
conflict, and the result would have been widely different from what it
was in the present case. There were nine savages in all, Unkee being
away, and seven whites&mdash;every one of whom was engaged with a pole in
raking the river at the moment when he was captured. This the Indians,
from the information given by Unkee, had anticipated, and had laid their
plans accordingly. As the whites approached, each Indian singled out his
man, leaving two of their party in readiness to close in, in case any one
should meet with more than his match&mdash;or fire upon and follow the
fugitive, in case one of the other party made his escape. At a
preconcerted signal, each sprang forward, and throwing his arms around
his antagonist, secured him, with but one exception, without a single
blow being struck in defense, and at the precise moment, too, when the
scream of Kate announced her, as was afterward ascertained, a prisoner
also.</p>

<p>The exception alluded to, was Clifton. Quick witted, and possessed of
great presence of mind, no sooner did he hear the yells, and feel his
arms grasped from behind, than, comprehending how matters were, he made a
feint to yield, which threw the Indian somewhat off his guard, and then
suddenly bounding forward, cleared himself of his captor. In an instant
the tomahawk of the savage was gleaming before his eyes, and the next
moment it would have been buried in his skull, had not his great
dexterity again saved him. Drawing his knife, bending his head forward,
and springing to the Indian all at the same time, he avoided the weapon
of the latter, which struck beyond him, and buried his own in the heart
of his foe. The Indian uttered a groan, and sunk down a corpse. Turning
as quick as lightning, our hero saw the two others rushing toward him,
weapons in hand. The foremost was two paces in advance of his companion;
and hastily drawing his pistol, he shot him through the breast. There was
only one left to contend with&mdash;for the rest were engaged in
mastering the whites, who, perceiving his successful resistance, had
become very refractory&mdash;and taking a hasty aim with his other
pistol, the young officer pulled the trigger. A flash in the pan saved
the life of his adversary; and the next moment the long war-club carried
by Mugwa laid him prostrate on the earth.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" grunted the chief, as he bent over Clifton to secure his hands,
speaking in tolerable English; "great warrior&mdash;make good Indian;"
and instead of a cloud of anger, the face of this savage dis played an
expression of admiration, at the successful daring and firmness of his
captive.</p>

<p>For a minute or two, Clifton lay stunned by the blow; and then
regained his senses, only to find himself and friends disarmed and bound,
with their hideous captors standing around, and gazing upon them with
looks of savage exultation. At this moment he thought of Kate, and his
anguish may be better imagined than described.</p>

<p>The Indians now conducted their prisoners out of the thicket, and
selecting a spot in the woods, a few yards distant, where there chanced
to be but little underbush, made them fast, each to a separate tree, and
then collected together by themselves, apparently to take council
regarding their next proceedings. Presently four of the party repaired to
the thicket, and returned with the two dead bodies&mdash;the Indian shot
by Clifton having just breathed his last.</p>

<p>Placing the dead upon the ground, side by side, the whole company
formed a circle round them, and taking hold of hands, commenced chanting
words wholly unintelligible to our friends, who gazed upon them with a
sort of painful curiosity.</p>

<p>In this manner some five minutes passed, without a word being spoken
on the part of the whites, when suddenly David called out:</p>

<p>"I say, Lieutenant!"</p>

<p>"Well?" answered Clifton.</p>

<p>"What d' ye think 'bout the business now?"</p>

<p>"Why, what should I think?"</p>

<p>"Do n't know&mdash;know best yourself; but have ye concluded that
Moody's living yet?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. It is impossible he should have escaped the peril I
pointed out to you."</p>

<p>"Well, then, all I've got to say is, that his ghost's got a powerful
flesh and blood look."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! what do you mean, David?" cried Clifton, quickly, while
every one turned his head&mdash;the only part of his person now at
liberty&mdash;toward the scout, anxious for an explanation of his
startling words.</p>

<p>David replied only by nodding his head mysteriously, in a certain
direction; and following that direction with their eyes, the faces of all
suddenly blanched, and each tongue uttered an exclamation of surprise and
alarm.</p>

<p>Within full view appeared Moody, approaching the Indians, leading Kate
by the hand, and followed by Unkee and the gardener.</p>

<p>"Good God!" groaned Clifton, "can it be possible that my eyes do not
deceive me&mdash;that Moody is still living&mdash;and Kate, sweet Kate,
again in his power!"</p>

<p>"'Spect if you don't believe your eyes, you'll soon have some other
sense that'll give you a powerful inclination that way," remarked David,
rather drily.</p>

<p>"I do not understand the affair," said Danvers. "There is something
very mysterious in his escape."</p>

<p>"I jest believe it's the devil's work," observed another; "and that's
the reason Icha's balls wouldn't kill. If ever I git a chance at him,
I'll put in some silver slugs, and try the virtue of them."</p>

<p>While such and similar remarks were passing among the whites, Moody
and his party approached the Indians. As he came up, they made a halt in
their ceremony, and uttering grunts of approbation at his success, opened
the ring for him to enter. As Kate, whom he still held by the hand, came
suddenly upon the dead and bloody bodies of the Indians, slain by the
hand of her lover, she gave an involuntary start, and uttered a slight
exclamation of horror. Moody seemed taken equally by surprise, for his
features slightly paled, and he turned his face quickly toward the chief
with a look of inquiry.</p>

<p>With Unkee, however, it was different. He was an Indian out and out,
and had been taught to school his feelings and passions, so as not to
betray surprise at any thing&mdash;a custom which is held by the savages
to be a great virtue. As he came up to his dead companions, therefore, he
looked down upon them calmly, without changing a muscle, as though it
were the most common-place sight in the world, and one he had expected to
behold.</p>

<p>"Who has done this?" asked Moody, in the Indian dialect, after waiting
a sufficient time for Mugwa to make an opening remark.</p>

<p>"The chief of the pale-faces," replied the latter.</p>

<p>A sudden gleam of ferocity now shot athwart the dark features of the
questioner, and laying his hand upon a weapon in his belt, he rejoined,
quickly:</p>

<p>"Then he must die."</p>

<p>"Let my brother be not hasty," returned Mugwa; "for the fates of all
must be decided by council. If the pale-face chief be doomed to die, it
must not be by the tomahawk."</p>

<p>"True, chief," answered Moody, with a grim smile, "I had nigh
forgotten your pleasant Indian customs of the stake and torture."</p>

<p>"Mugwa deems him worthy of them all," pursued the chief; "for he is a
great brave, and no Indian warrior could have done more. The chief of the
Piquas could almost call him brother, too."</p>

<p>This was alluding in a rather obscure manner to the design which had
previously entered the head of the "Bear," of making an Indian of
Clifton, and was thus thrown out as a sort of feeler, to learn the
impression it would produce upon Moody. As he heard it, the outcast
started, and exclaimed vehemently:</p>

<p>"No, Mugwa, he must die!" The next moment a new idea took possession
of his brain, and he added, immediately,in a lower tone&mdash;"That is,
perhaps; I will see; I will consider, Mugwa. But go on with your
ceremony. I would join you, only that I have important matters to which I
must attend; and turning away abruptly, he led Kate out of the circle,
and some distance apart from all.</p>

<p>"You have seen," he began, addressing himself to our heroine, and
nodding his head in the direction of the circle of savages.</p>

<p>"I have," answered Kate calmly.</p>

<p>"And you still see," pursued Moody, pointing his finger in the
opposite direction, and toward the captives.</p>

<p>Kate followed the motion with her eyes, and, for the first time,
became aware of the capture of her friends&mdash;of the complete triumph
of her foes&mdash;and in a moment her heart sunk, her features grew
deadly pale, a sudden nervous weakness seized her, and, but for the
support of Moody, she would have fallen to the earth.</p>

<p>Finding the Indians by themselves, around the dead bodies of their
late comrades, and no new scalps at their belts, Kate had believed that a
skirmish had ensued in which her friends had been victorious, and that
she might look for a rescue at any moment. But now the case was
different; the horrible reality had broken upon her like a thunder-bolt;
they were all prisoners&mdash;reserved perhaps for the torture&mdash;and
all in the power of the archdemon by her side, from whom she could hope
for no mercy. Moody watched the painful expression of her lovely
countenance with a grim smile of satisfaction; and after waiting till she
had somewhat recovered her composure, he resumed:</p>

<p>"You see I am now master of all. Were you in the infernal regions of
the damned, you would not be more fully in the power of the arch-fiend,
than you and your friends are now in mine."</p>

<p>"I am aware of that," replied Kate. "and more&mdash;I think the
comparison aptly made."</p>

<p>"That may or may not be, as matters turn out," rejoined Moody, drily.
"I have led you hither, away from the others, to tell you something of
importance, regarding yourself and friends, and from your replies to take
my cue of conduct."</p>

<p>"Say on," returned Kate.</p>

<p>"You noticed those dead bodies?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"They were slain by the hand of your lover, Lieutenant Clifton, and,
according to old Luther's story, my once brother."</p>

<p>Again Kate trembled, her features grew deadly pale, and she fairly
gasped for breath.</p>

<p>"Well, I see you comprehend," resumed Moody, after another short
pause; "and I am glad you do, as it will save me much circumlocution in
my remarks. Now mark my words. As soon as you ceremony of the Indians is
over and their dead are buried from their sight, they will proceed to
hold council, regarding the disposal of their prisoners. Now you know
something of Indian nature&mdash;or ought to, at least&mdash;and are
doubtless well aware that, when they are angry, they are not altogether
the most mild and placid creatures which the world has ever produced. On
the contrary, their customs are somewhat rough&mdash;particularly when
they decide on putting a captive through the interesting ceremony of
being roasted alive by a slow fire, with various little et ceteras, in
the way of amusement&mdash;such as shooting powder into his naked
body&mdash; filling the flesh with resinous splinters and setting fire to
them&mdash;cutting off his ears and tongue&mdash;punching out his eyes,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, hold!" cried Kate, covering her face, and shuddering
with horror, at the terrible picture of torture drawn by the outcast.</p>

<p>"I merely wished you to comprehend the matter in full force," pursued
Moody; "and as I perceive you do&mdash;why, I will sketch no further.
Now, as your lover has been guilty of a certain breach of etiquette
(Moody spoke in an ironical tone), namely, killing two Indians, after
being seized as a prisoner himself, it is more than probable that they,
on trial, will sentence him to the interesting little proceeding I just
mentioned, and at which you thought proper to turn away your face in holy
horror."</p>

<p>"In the name of that God before whom you must soon be judged! tell me
what you ask&mdash;what you seek&mdash;that you thus mentally torture
me?" cried Kate.</p>

<p>"Ah! now you speak to the point," replied Moody, with a grim smile;
"and I will answer you. In the first place, know that your lover will
assuredly be condemned to the torture; and that I, and I alone can save
him."</p>

<p>"Well?" ejaculated Kate, breathlessly, fixing her eyes intently upon
the other.</p>

<p>"I say," pursued Moody, "I can save him, and, on one condition, I
will."</p>

<p>"Name it!" gasped the maiden.</p>

<p>"That you will swear to become my wife. Remember, now, I make a
distinction: <i>wife</i>, not <i>mistress</i>, I ask. Remember, too,
before you decide, that not only Clifton, but all your friends here are
in my power as well as yourself; and that if I choose, I can have them
put to the torture before your eyes, and you dishonored before theirs.
Remember, the alternative before you is terrible. I will say further. If
you become my wife, by your own free consent, you shall always be treated
with respect, and shall be provided for comfortably during my life, and
at my death shall have the privilege to go whither, and marry whom, you
please. To-day I make you this proposal, which yesterday I would have
scorned; and the whole secret lies in the revival of my love, or my
passion (call it which you will), for you. Do not decide hastily. I will
give you a few minutes, alone, to think upon it; but if you decide in my
favor, one thing you must bear in mind: You will have to swear, by all
your hopes of salvation hereafter&mdash;by all you love and hold
sacred&mdash;by everything, in fact, that can make your oath
binding&mdash;that you will be mine, rescue or no rescue; that, in short,
come what will, you will follow me and my fortunes through life, and
that, in the event of your breaking this oath, you solemnly pray the
Ruler of the universe to condemn you to eternal torments in the world to
come."</p>

<p>Saying this, Moody turned abruptly away, leaving Kate standing alone,
stupified with horror at the words she had just heard him utter.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_22">CHAPTER XX.</a></h3>

<p>Sneer on, and show your scorn! for any fool May sneer, that is withal
a coward.</p>

<p>&mdash;****</p>

<p>By heavens! the die is east; I will no more&mdash;but to the torture
Instantly.</p>

<p>&mdash;Purcell</p>

<p>"I give you a most hearty welcome. my old comrades, to your new abode
in the forest of my red brethren," said Moody, with mock cordiality, as
he approached the captives, waving his hand in a salutary manner, and
smiling hypocritically.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear brother, how fare you?" he continued, coming up to
Clifton, and extending his hand, apparently unmindful that the other
could not return the compliment. "I am so delighted to see you&mdash;
upon my word I am. What! won't you shake hands with your brother?" he
added, in pretended reproach, stepping back a pace, and sighing
sorrowfully. "Well, well, such is the way of the world&mdash;this wicked
world. Ah, me! ah, me!" and he shook his head, and sighed again.</p>

<p>"Taunt on&mdash;taunt on!" replied Clifton. "I know I am in your
power, and of course I expect no mercy at the hands of so base a
coward."</p>

<p>"Now you wrong me, dear brother&mdash; upon my word you do," rejoined
Moody, laying his hand in mock humility upon his heart. "I mean you well,
I assure you."</p>

<p>"Cut these cords, then, and let me go," said the other.</p>

<p>"Ah! now you touch a tender point. Really, nothing would delight me
more&mdash; but, pardon me, you see I have to consult my friends yonder
(here he pointed toward the Indians), whom I am sorry to say you have
injured&mdash;doubtless unintentionally&mdash; to quite an alarming
extent."</p>

<p>"Two of them. I doubt not, have been <i>slightly</i> injured by my
hand," returned Clifton, pointedly, with a curl of his lip.</p>

<p>"Ah! yes&mdash;true. Really, I am delighted to perceive you comprehend
my meaning&mdash;indeed I am," pursued Moody, with the gravity of a
parson.</p>

<p>"You're a devil in human shape, if ever there was one," called out
David, from a neighboring tree, where he had overheard the taunts of
Moody.</p>

<p>"Better keep us safe while you've got us," put in another: "for if
ever we get clear agin, with you in <i>our</i> power, I swear to you the
nearest tree shall serve you for a gallows."</p>

<p>"Really, gentleman," replied the outcast, turning to them, smiling
maliciously, but continuing his hypocritical cant; "you do me too much
honor&mdash;indeed you do. All I fear is, that you will not beable to
carry your sage plans into execution. It is true, I will assist you all I
can; but then, you know, I am only a poor, weak, human being after all,
and am liable to fail."</p>

<p>A few muttered maledictions was the only response to these taunting
gibes; and turning again to Clifton, Moody resumed:</p>

<p>"Time wears, my dear brother, and I have come to speak with you on
matters of the most grave importance, touching your welfare."</p>

<p>"Say on," replied Clifton.</p>

<p>"There stands one yonder," continued Moody, pointing to Kate, who
still remained where he had left her, motionless as if rooted to the
spot; "whom, I doubt not, you highly esteem. There, there, dear brother,
do n't contradict me&mdash;I may say, I know you prize her highly. Well,
in that you are certainly right, for she is worthy of much esteem, and I
assure you she has mine to the full. Now life, I have been led to
believe, is sweet to every one; and I venture to say you are not an
exception to this rule. In consideration of this, I have been making some
proposals to yonder fair maiden, which, if she accept, I trust, by my
influence, to save yours&mdash;although, as you are well aware, it has
been forfeited by your imprudent conduct, in killing two of my
friends."</p>

<p>"Ha! well, what did you propose?" asked Clifton, quickly.</p>

<p>"Why, dear brother&mdash;and in consideration that you are my
brother&mdash;which I verily believe, otherwise you could not be so good
and amiable&mdash;as I wish to have no secrets that you cannot share with
me, I will tell you. Know then, and therefore, that my former passion for
yonder fair maiden&mdash;which I believe is antecedent to yours, and
consequently righteous by priority&mdash;has again revived in a wonderful
degree, and I am extremely anxious to call her mine by marriage. Now as
an inducement for her to take this step&mdash;to yield her consent
freely, and espouse me through life as her lawful husband&mdash;I have
promised to save your life, and set you free."</p>

<p>"Villain!" cried Clifton, his features glowing with proud indignation;
"base, cowardly, doubly damned villain! Sooner would I suffer death a
thousand times, than have her united, or even <i>think</i> of uniting
herself with such as you!"</p>

<p>As Clifton uttered these words, in a fierce, loud tone&mdash;which
distinctly reached Kate, roused her from her revery, and decided her
course of action&mdash;Moody started, a terrible expression passed over
his countenance, his eyes gleamed like an angry serpent's, and
instinctively his hand sought a weapon in his belt. The next moment, by a
sudden and powerful effort, he partially succeeded in suppressing this
show of passion, and resuming his former hypocritical look and cant. We
say partially; for so much of passion was mingled with the effort to
appear perfectly serene and unmoved, as to render his appearance somewhat
ridiculous.</p>

<p>"You forget, dear brother," he said, with something between a sneer
and a smile, "that the death you so nobly speak of suffering, will be
attended with considerable inconvenience, not to say pain; for the death
at the stake, which I assure you will be yours, is not the easiest
imaginable, as doubtless you are well aware. Besides, it is a dreadful
thing to die so young, and with such brilliant prospects before you; for
I see, by your glittering uniform, you are already on the road to fame.
If the words of Blind Luther be true, fortune, and some great name, are
perhaps within your grasp also; and is it not a pity to exchange all
these for the burning stake&mdash;to have your ashes scattered to the
winds&mdash;simply for a trifling matter of will, or because you cannot
deny yourself the charms of one simple maiden? as though the world could
not substitute thousands more fair and lovely."</p>

<p>"What is it you aim at? what would you have?" asked Clifton, angrily.
"Have you not the girl, as well as myself, in your power?"</p>

<p>"True, but I wish your consent. I know, by force, I can do with you
both whatsoever I please; but I do not wish to resort to compulsion. A
few words from you can persuade Kate to become my wife; and I swear to
you the marriage shall be solemnized by a priest."</p>

<p>"I thought," said Clifton, fastening his eye sternly upon Moody, "I
thought, at first, that you were simply trying to taunt me with the words
you have uttered; but I feel convinced now, that you are in earnest.
Therefore, listen! I have weighed the matter fully, while you have been
speaking, and this is my decision: Sooner than ask, or allow Kate
Clarendon to become your wife, I would suffer patiently all the tortures
you, or the red heathen yonder, can inflict&mdash;so help and support me
God! Go! you are answered, and your presence offends my sight."</p>

<p>"Ernest, dear Ernest," now cried the sweet voice of Kate, who had
silently approached the party, unseen by either Moody or Clifton; and
rushing forward as she spoke, she threw her arms around the neck of her
lover, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"God bless you, dearest!" said the young officer, with emotion,
pressing his lips to her brow, and making a bold but vain attempt to free
his arms. "God bless you, dear Kate, for this! though I am pained to meet
you here."</p>

<p>The face of Moody, who now stood glaring upon the two, grew black with
passion. At length he spoke, in a husky voice.</p>

<p>"I have yet to hear your decision," he said, striding up to the
grief-stricken maiden, and laying his hand somewhat roughly upon her
shoulder.</p>

<p>Kate started, looked around, trembled, grew deadly pale, and then
turned her eyes inquiringly upon Clifton.</p>

<p>"You will not yield to his base proposal?" said the latter,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"It is to save your life, dear Ernest."</p>

<p>"Not if I had ten thousand lives to lay down in such a cause,"
exclaimed Clifton, vehemently. "I should hold life as utterly worthless,
gained at such a sacrifice, dear Kate. For God's sake! do not yield to
such a monster!"</p>

<p>"But the torture, dear, dearest Ernest?"</p>

<p>"The torture&mdash;the rack&mdash;any thing&mdash; every thing&mdash;I
would bear all a thousand times, rather than hear you answer so base a
villain in the affirmative."</p>

<p>"Then my decision is made."</p>

<p>"Your answer!" cried Moody, almost fiercely.</p>

<p>"I refuse, sir! I never will be yours! God shield the right, and help
me through!"</p>

<p>"God bless you for those cheering words, Kate!" exclaimed Clifton,
joyfully. "Now let the monsters do their worst; I can die content."</p>

<p>The countenance of Moody now assumed the look of a foiled demon. No
hypocritical smile was there now&mdash;no cant upon his lips.</p>

<p>"Away!" he shouted, fiercely, his eyes gleaming with rage, stamping
his foot upon the ground, and fairly foaming at the mouth. "Away! and
meet the doom you seek!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he rudely tore the arms of Kate from around the neck of
Clifton, and half dragged her to a neighboring tree, to which he
hurriedly bound her delicate limbs&mdash;she uttering no scream, nor a
single word of complaint. When done, Moody turned abruptly around, and
strode directly toward the Indians, who, their ceremony being over, were
now engaged in the solemn rite of burying their dead forever from their
sight.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_23">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h3>

<p>Berrango.&mdash;I tell thee, Vernardi, I am for death. He must not
live! Death and hell's tortures Must he his doom. Vernardi.&mdash;Then he
it so! I yield reluctantly.</p>

 <i>Old Play.</i>

<p>Fetch hither cords, and knives, and sulphurous flames! He shall be
bound, and gashed, his skin fleeced, burnt alive; He shall be hours, days
years, a-dying.</p>

<p>&mdash;Nat Lee.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour elapsed, and still the captives, each to his
tree, stood fast bound, in awful suspense regarding their fate,
undergoing a mental torture second only to that of the stake&mdash;when
the whole party of savages, Moody on the lead, was seen approaching
them.</p>

<p>As the Indians neared the prisoners, the latter could
discover&mdash;by the dark, angry, sinister looks of all&mdash;that
mercy, that diviner attribute of the brave and good, formed no part of
their rude and barbarous creed. When they had attained a close vicinity
to their captives, they came to a halt, and for a moment gazed around
with savage ferocity. Without going nearer, or saying a word to any of
the whites, who stood regarding them in gloomy silence, they began to
collect some dry sticks, which they threw into a pile and set on fire.
Then seating themselves around it, the pipe, the unfailing accompaniment
of an Indian council, was produced and lighted, and passed around the
circle as on the occasion previously described.</p>

<p>When this part of the ceremony was over, Moody arose and said:</p>

<p>"Brothers, when last we met in council, it was at the request of him
who now addresses you. He then told you a good tale, which you yourselves
have proved to be true. He told you, that many scalps or many prisoners
were on the southern path. You believed him, and you turned back; for the
rest, look around you."</p>

<p>Here he paused, and slowly pointed to each of the prisoners,
individually, beginning with Clifton, and ending with the gardener, who
now stood bound to a tree, some distance from the others, his Indian
captor having joined the council. When done, Moody resumed:</p>

<p>"Brothers, behold your triumph! There they stand, bound captives. In
all, Posetha counts nine heads, or nine scalps. He looks around this
circle, and, including himself, can only count nine warriors. There were
two more when his red brothers turned back. Where are they now? In the
Indian's Heaven. Who sent them there before their time? Yonder pale-face
chief. Posetha thinks this enough. He should die. He has been long enough
upon the war-path, and he should die. The shoulder of Posetha pains him.
He has been wounded. Who did it? Yonder miscreant (pointing to the
gardener). Three times has yonder wretch sought Posetha's life. He still
lives to boast it. Posetha thinks he should die also. This will make his
party the strongest. Otherwise, there will be a pale-face to every
red-man. There will still be left enough to amuse the young men, the
squaws and papposes of the Indians. Posetha gives his voice for the
speedy torture of the two he has named. His ears are open to hear their
cries for mercy. His heart is shut to that mercy. It will please him. It
will please the Great Spirit. Brothers, Posetha has spoken."</p>

<p>By a ready tact, peculiar to his nature Moody had learned to adapt
himself to the manners and mode of speaking of the Indians. When
harranguing in council unlike his usual method in English, he made his
sentences simple and short, and spoke directly to the point. His Indian
dialect was not spoken with ease, nor very fluently; but, with short
sentences, he always managed to make himself distinctly understood.</p>

<p>As he took his seat upon the ground he ran his eye around the circle,
and perceived, by their looks of ferocity, their flashing eyes, that his
sentiments were echoed in the breasts of nearly every savage. We say
nearly&mdash;we might say all with the exception of Mugwa, the chief. It
will be recollected, that the bravery of Clifton, even in slaying a part
of his band, had won his admiration; and a design of saving his life, of
transforming him into an Indian, had then entered his head, and had not
yet been eradicated. With regard to the others, he was ready to give his
voice for death; but Clifton, from some strange fancy, he wished
spared.</p>

<p>Moody saw at a glance, that on this point he would meet with decided
opposition; but he trusted to a majority in his favor to carry the
day.</p>

<p>Mugwa was the next to speak. Slowly, with dignity, he rose, and gazing
round upon the circle of warriors, whom he saw were all attention, at
length began.</p>

<p>"Brothers," he said, "you have heard the words of Posetha. To Mugwa
they seem wise, and not wise. Wise, when they tell us we must make our
party the strongest&mdash;not wise when they bid us sacrifice the
pale-face chief."</p>

<p>Here Mugwa, although no one interrupted him, saw by the change in the
countenances of his hearers, that he had touched upon an unpopular theme;
but nothing daunted, he went on.</p>

<p>"True, he continued, "he has slain two of my braves, and menaced the
life of Mugwa himself&mdash;But was not this done in his own defense? Who
can blame him? What warrior among you does not admire bravery? It is a
great virtue. It comes directly from the Great Spirit. Had he turned like
a coward to fly, Mugwa would have sent a ball to bid him tarry. Mugwa
would ere this have had his scalp drying on his belt and the wolves
should have fattened on his carcass. He did not do this, though
surrounded by enemies he knew he could not conquer. He acted the hero and
the man. Mugwa admires heroism. He has been a great many moons upon the
war-path. His own hand has slain a great many pale-faces. He is brave. He
is their enemy. The proof of both is in his lodge. Who thinks Mugwa
boasts without cause&mdash; that his tongue is forked&mdash;can go there
and see. Mugwa loves a hero, be he redman or pale-face. It is a great
thing to be brave. Yonder pale-face chief is brave. Mugwa would not see
him bound to the stake, and die like a dog. There is no squaw in. There
is squaw in his follower. Take them. There are enough and to spare. Mugwa
is willing. But why select the bravest? Why select him who fears not
death? Mugwa does not ask to set him free. He would take him home to his
nation, and let them decide. He would in short make him an Indian. <i>He
is worthy to be an Indian</i>. He would teach our young men
courage&mdash;our warriors wisdom. Spare him, and Mugwa sanctions all the
rest. He has spoken."</p>

<p>Here the chief gravely took his seat, amid a profound silence. It was
evident to Moody, who watched the faces of all attentively, that the
arguments of the Bear had made a deep impression upon their minds, and
that the scale would assuredly turn against him, unless the weight of the
next speaker's argument was thrown in his favor. With some anxiety,
therefore, he waited the rising of the next orator. On him, doubtless,
would depend the triumph of himself or Mugwa. At length Unkee started to
his feet, and Moody at once felt satisfied by the gleam of his eye, that
he would side with him, and thus his triumph would be complete. Nor was
he mistaken.</p>

<p>"Brothers," began Unkee, "you have heard. The words of the great
chiefs have found your ears open. They have entered your brains, and, not
being alike, have become confused. You do not know which has spoken most
wise. You wish to hear the opinion of another before you decide. Unkee
will give you his. Unkee is not an orator. He is not of many words. He is
more for action. Hear his counsel. The pale-face is many&mdash;the
red-man is few. Unless the red-man destroy the pale-face, he will
over-run him. All should die. The voice of Unkee joins Posetha's. The
pale-face chief should die now. First, because he is brave, and the more
to be feared. Secondly, because the spirits of our friends call for his
blood. <i>They cannot rest in peace, knowing their murderer fills their
wigwam</i>."</p>

<p>This last was an argument so forcible, so conclusive to an Indian
mind, that nothing but the mighty force of habit, restrained the dark
warriors from interrupting the speaker with fierce yells of coin ciding
opinions. As it was, their faces instantly grew savagely ferocious; their
eyes gleamed like balls of fire; their nostrils expanded, and their hands
nervously clutched their weapons.</p>

<p>It was a complete triumph. A thousand words could not add to or
destroy the force of that single, simple sentence. Even Mugwa seemed
astonished and taken aback, as though the idea were new, and had struck
him, too, with force. Moody, with a thrill of savage joy, now saw that
his end was gained. A direct Providence could alone save the victims of
his hate from their impending doom. Unkee, too, saw that the effect he
sought was wrought, and he was cunning enough to pause and give it full
sway.</p>

<p>Simply adding, "Unkee has spoken," he resumed his seat.</p>

<p>No sooner did the savages perceive that he was done, than springing to
their feet, they uttered the most terrific yells imaginable&mdash; yells
which went to the hearts of the prisoners, and told them, alas! to fear
the worst. As for Moody, he fairly shouted with ferocious delight, and
danced around in a wild ecstasy of joy. Revenge he felt was in his
grasp.</p>

<p>At length the yells and rapid gesticulations of the savages subsided,
after which several minutes were occupied in settling the time and place
where the horrid rite should come off, and the manner in which it should
be conducted. After some discussion in the Indian fashion, it was finally
agreed that Clifton and Ichabod should be put to the tortures on the very
ground where the council had been held which had decreed them to death,
and in full view of all the prisoners, who would thereby be witnesses of
what, sooner or later, they would have to undergo themselves.</p>

<p>This suited the purpose of Moody exactly; and while the Indians set
about preparing for the work of death, he repaired to Clifton, to let him
know the result, taunt him all he could, and, in fact, enjoy to the full
his own hellish triumph.</p>

<p>"I have come, my dear brother," he said, ironically, "to inform you
what my friends propose to do for your benefit. Perhaps, however, you can
judge for yourself, by simply watching their motions."</p>

<p>"I suppose I am to be tortured," an swered Clifton, compressing his
lips, and slightly turning pale.</p>

<p>"Well, you have made a very good guess, for the first one," replied
Moody, with a laugh. "You are about to reap the benefit of your
obstinacy, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Do your worst," rejoined Clifton; "for sooner would I die, than
sacrifice the happiness of yonder maiden."</p>

<p>"And what, think you, you save her by this? Strange fancy you have got
in your head, and one which I will now remove, for your especial benefit.
In the first place, is not the girl in my power?"</p>

<p>"I suppose she is."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what think you it will matter with me, or with her,
whether she refuse to be my lawful wife or not? I cannot compel her to
marry me, it is true; but I <i>can</i> compel her to do worse."</p>

<p>"Good God! Moody, what do you mean?" cried Clifton, as a vague
suspicion of something terrible crossed his mind.</p>

<p>"I leave you to judge what I mean, for the present, as I see a warrior
coming to prepare you for the trial that awaits you," answered Moody.
"When you are burning at the stake, and your flesh cracking with the
heat, I will come, and hiss my meaning in your ear, that your spirit may
have a knowledge in the world beyond, of what she you love is bound to
suffer in this."</p>

<p>Saying this Moody turned upon his heel and strode away toward Kate,
while the savage approached, and simply giving a grunt, drew his knife
and cut the thongs which bound Ernest to the tree, but without cutting
those which bound his hands. He then took hold of his arm, and pointing
in a significant manner toward the main body of his companions, conducted
him away. All this was noted by the friends of Clifton, with feelings
peculiar to each, but which it would be impossible for us to
describe.</p>

<p>Meantime Moody approached Kate, who stood bound to the tree, her
features pale as death, and a look of alarmed inquiry upon her sweet
countenance.</p>

<p>"Well," said the outcast, coming up, a dark smile playing over his
sinister features, "you are now about to experience the result of your
decision. Look yonder, and yon," and he pointed first toward Clifton, and
then toward the savages, who were in the act of driving a large stake
deep into the earth.</p>

<p>"What mean these fearful signs?" asked Kate, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Their meaning, methinks, is very apparent," answered Moody. "Your
lover is about to pass the ordeal of fire, on a journey from which he
will never return."</p>

<p>"Oh, God! Moody, you cannot be so base&mdash;so cruel!" cried Kate, in
terrible agony, little heeding that she might as well have attempted to
move a savage to tears, as him she addressed to mercy.&mdash; "Oh, save
him! save him!&mdash;he is your brother!"</p>

<p>"Not if he were ten times my brother, and it were in my power,"
returned Moody, fiercely. "You plead too late, Kate Clarendon. Once I
sought to save him, on the easy condition that you became my wife. I told
you of the consequences, if you refused, and yet refuse you did. His doom
is now past recall. He must die. And you," added Moody, tauntingly, "And
you, pretty Miss Kate&mdash;do not think by this that <i>you</i> will
escape me! No! I swear to you your doom shall be no better than his!"</p>

<p>Kate shut her eyes and groaned.</p>

<p>"One thing," she cried, suddenly, "do me one favor, and I will ask no
more! Do not let him writhe at the stake! In mercy take your rifle,
and&mdash;and&mdash;(she paused, and shuddered, and her voice sunk to an
almost inaudible whisper)&mdash; and&mdash;end&mdash;his&mdash;misery,"
she gasped, at last with a groan.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Moody, "you must have a very poor opinion of me,
to think I would condescend to save him from his red friends yonder;" and
again he pointed toward the savages.</p>

<p>"Farewell, dearest!" said a deep, solemn voice at this moment, that
made the blood retreat to the heart of Kate, leaving her pale, agonized
features bloodless; and looking round, she saw her lover being led to his
place of torture. "Farewell, dearest!" again spoke Ernest, in solemn
tones. "On earth we may never meet again; but in God put your trust, and
meet me soon in the land of spirits!"</p>

<p>Kate could hear no more, but uttered one fearful scream of anguish,
that penetrated the hearts of all her friends, and made the brave young
officer tremble as a child.</p>

<p>"You see!" said Moody, coolly, pointing toward the already retreating
form of Clifton, as his Indian conductor hurried him forward: "You
see!"</p>

<p>But he was mistaken; Kate did not see; she had fainted; and with a
deep malediction on her tender heart, Moody turned away, and strode on
after his intended victim.</p>

<p>By the time that he had come up to the Indians, the driving of the
stake was completed, and the savages were already placing sticks around
it.&mdash;These were put end-wise to the stake, some three feet distant,
so as to form a complete circle, and give the condemned the benefit of a
slow fire. To the stake the prisoner was to be bound, so as to leave him
a little freedom, and then the sticks were to be fired.</p>

<p>Clifton, as he neared the spot, noticed all these preparations with a
shudder, and with a sinking spirit; but nerving himself with as much
stoicism as he could assume, he in wardly called upon his Maker to aid
him, and prepared himself to undergo the trial before him with manly
fortitude.</p>

<p>And a terrible trial it was to one like him, in the very prime of
life, with every inducement to live&mdash;just, too, on the verge of
happiness&mdash;to be thus snatched away from all he loved and held dear,
and slowly tortured out of existence into the dread, unknown Beyond. But
most terrible of all, was the maddening thought of the dear one he loved,
who would be left behind in the power of the most inhuman monster on
earth. Were Kate at liberty and safe, he felt he could die comparatively
happy. The suffering of the body alone, he fancied, could be borne; but
the suffering of body and mind together, was a something to sap his
courage, and make the man a child. Nor was his feeling of despair
lessened, as he turned his gaze upward toward the glorious sun, (that now
ascending the heavens, poured his light and warmth upon the great earth)
then around upon the beauties of nature everywhere displayed before
him&mdash;felt the soft, balmy breeze upon his cheek, and remembered that
he was about to bid adieu to all these bright things forever.</p>

<p>It had been decided by the Indians, that Clifton should suffer first,
and therefore only one place of torture had been prepared, which was
afterward to serve for the gardener, who, in consequence, still remained
bound to his tree. The spot chosen for the horrid rite, was a little open
patch of ground, near which grew a cluster of bushes, forming part of a
thicket that stretched away to the Little Miami, but not so as to
obstruct the view of the other prisoners&mdash;it being the policy of the
Indians to have them spectators of the awful spectacle.</p>

<p>The appearance of Clifton upon the ground, was the signal for the
savages to set up a series of horrid yells, to dance around him in brutal
triumph, and pinch, beat and otherwise maltreat him with their hands and
fists. This lasted some ten or fifteen minutes, and was borne by the
prisoner without a word of complaint. In this savage custom, in justice
be it said, Moody did not join; but folding his arms upon his breast, he
stood a little apart, regarding his brother in stern silence.</p>

<p>When they had amused themselves sufficiently in this way, the Indians
began stripping their victim of his apparel, preparatory to binding him
to the stake. First his coat, then his vest, and then piece after piece
of his other garments, theytore rudely from him, and with some of them
decorated their own hideous persons. As they rent the bosom of his shirt,
the silver box presented him by Luther, which had been placed there for
safe keeping, rolled out and fell to the ground. In an instant, Moody,
who had so far been only a spectator, sprang forward, and seized it with
avidity.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he asked, turning it over and over, and noting with
wonder the strange characters upon it. "Speak, sirrah! what is this?" he
pursued, addressing himself to Clifton. But the lat ter deigned him no
answer; and muttering, "Take that for your silence," Moody struck him
with his fist a violent blow upon the side of his head, and coolly hid
the box under his vestments to be examined at some future time.</p>

<p>Having at length stripped Clifton entirely, the Indians proceeded to
attach him to the stake, by means of a rope made of deer-skin, and in
such a manner as to leave him a little play round the circle, but not
enough to reach the fire. They then had another dance around him,
accompanied with horrible yells, when a warrior suddenly appeared with a
burning brand, and applied it to the combustible pile. The sticks, many
of them being small and dry, were very ignitable, and in a moment the red
flames shot upward, and flashed, and crackled and crept around the
circle, until the prisoner, to those at a little distance, appeared
enveloped in fire and smoke. Gradually the heat became more and more
intense, untill the position of Clifton, who kept himself close to the
stake, was rendered not a little painful, and already a few blisters
began to make their appearance on his tender skin.</p>

<p>"Now for the burnt powder," cried Moody, with a horrid laugh; and
pointing his rifle toward the naked body of Clifton, he was already in
the act of pullinh the trigger, when suddenly the muzzle dropped to the
ground, and its owner, turning ghastly pale, stood, with mouth distended,
and eyes half starting from their sockets, gazing in the direction of the
thicket, and trembling with very fear. The Indians, too, suddenly halted
in their savage rite, and uttering the single word "Kitcho-chobeka,"
shrank cowering back, with looks expressive of surprise and dismay.</p>

<p>The next moment a powerful figure rushed through the flames, and
cutting the bonds of the prisoner, raised and bore him to a safe distance
beyond the fatal circle. Turning with a look of unspeakable grattitude to
his deliverer, Clifton, to his amazement and joy, beheld in him the tall,
ungainly, but commanding form of Blind Luther, the Necromancer.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_25">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h3>

<p>They spake not a word, But like dumb statues, or breathless stones,
Stared on each other, and looked deadly pale.</p>

[Shakspeare. <br>
 His hand did quake, <br>
And tremble like a leaf of aspen green, <br>
And troubled blood through his pale face was seen <br>
To come and go, with tidings from the heart, <br>
As it a running messenger had been. [Shakspeare.

<p>O! how glorious 't is To right the oppressed, and bring the feton vile
To just disgrace!</p>

[Somerville.

<p>Yes, let the traitor die, For sparing justice feeds iniquity.</p>

[Shakspeare.

<p>Without waiting to receive his thanks, and in fact scarcely noticing
Clifton at all, Luther made a single bound forward, and seizing the
trembling Moody by the throat, bore him violently to the earth. Then
hastily disarming him, he set his foot upon his heaving breast and
shouted:</p>

<p>"Villain, thy hour has come!"</p>

<p>By this time the Indians had recovered somewhat from their
astonishment, and seeing their victim at liberty, and one of their own
party in such imminent danger, began to rally and collect around the
Necromancer, with menacing gestures.</p>

<p>"Sons of the forest," cried Luther, addressing them in their own
dialect, "away, and leave the misereant to his fate!"</p>

<p>"Kitcho-chobeka is great," answered Mugwa; "but why does he interfere
here?"</p>

<p>"The Great Spirit is offended," rejoined Luther solemnly, pointing
upward.</p>

<p>"You have aided Watchemenetoc in his hellish work," and he pointed
downward to Moody. "Begone! ere you behold the Great Spirit's anger!"</p>

<p>The Indians, judging by their looks, were now evidently alarmed, but
not satisfied, and loth to depart without further proof of the Great
Spirit's anger, through His instrument, as they superstitiously believed
Luther to be.</p>

<p>"Let us have our prisoner and our chief," grumbled Mugwa, "and we will
go."</p>

<p>"Touch one of them," replied Luther, fiercely, straightening his ugly
form to its full height, and rolling his restless eye from one to the
other with an angry expression: "Touch one of them again, and perdition
go with you! Watchemenetoc is not your chief; he is a devil in human
form. Away! begone!" and he waved his hand majestically.</p>

<p>But still the Indians lingered; and fearful they might, in spite, of
their fears, veriture upon a rescue, Luther suddenly thrust his hand into
his bosom, and drew forth a ball, some three inches in diameter, which he
had previously prepared for such an emergency.</p>

<p>This proceeding was noted by the savages with deep interest, and they
would instantly have crowded around him, had not their fours restrained
them. As it was, however, they approached within a few feet, and got
between Luther and the fire, their eyes the while fixed intently on the
ball, which the Necromancer, to puzzle them, now commenced turning
rapidly over and over in his hands. This was exactly what he desired; and
muttering some unintelligible words, and looking upward, as if appealing
to Heaven, he suddenly, and by a dexterous movement, cast it beyond them,
into the flames, at the same time shouting:</p>

<p>"Behold and tremble, ye sons of the forest, and revere the tongue of
the Great Spirit!"</p>

<p>The Indians, all amazement, followed the ball with their eyes, and, as
it touched the fire, beheld first a red and then a blue flame shoot
upward with a hissing sound. The words of the Necromancer now fell with
startling effect upon their ears, and were scarcely concluded, ere a
tremend explosion took place, which shook the ground beneath their feet,
and scattered the burning brands in every direction, leaving the space
lately occupied by the fire black and smoking. The brands, too, many of
them, striking against the almost naked bodies of the Indians, increased
their terror and confusion. Mugwa and another savage were knocked down,
and all were more or less bruised and injured by the explosion. Springing
to his feet, the chief of the Piquas uttered a frightful yell of terror,
and darted toward the thicket, followed closely by his yelling and no
less terrified companions, leaving the Necromancer master of the
ground.</p>

<p>Clifton, who had been an inactive spectator of the whole, now sprang
to Luther, and grasping him by the hand, while tears of joy filled his
eyes, said, with emotion:</p>

<p>"My more than friend, my kind benefactor, how can I ever sufficiently
thank you for this timely interference and preservation of my life?"</p>

<p>"Ernest Bellington," answered Luther, warmly pressing the hand of the
young officer, "you owe me no thanks, nor do I need them. When I do a
good deed, I know it is registered there," and he slowly and impressively
pointed upward; "there&mdash;there&mdash;beyond that sky of blue, where I
humbly hope and pray my spirit will one day wing its flight, and find
more good than evil recorded of my doings while a tenant here below.
Here," added Luther, pointing downward to Moody, who as yet had made no
effort to rise; "Here is a painful task for me to perform. I must yield
him up to justice. I have said, and I will do it, for I always keep my
word."</p>

<p>"And he deserves it," returned Clifton; "for if ever there was a
black-hearted villain on earth, he is one. But Kate, and my
friends&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he was interrupted by the report of firearms; and wheeling
suddenly in the direction of his fettered comrades, whom he expected to
behold sinking under the weapons of the savages, judge of his
astonishment, on seeing <i>them</i> already in pursuit of the latter,
armed to the teeth.</p>

<p>"Good Heaven! what magic is this?" he cried, turning to Luther, all
amazement.</p>

<p>"Simply that before I liberated you, I took all means of precaution to
render my work sure," replied the other modestly.</p>

<p>Such was the fact; and an unusual negligence on the part of the
Indians, had aided him most essentially. Feeling perfectly secure, and
not wishing uselessly to encumber themselves, they had placed most of the
weapons taken from the whites in a pile by themselves, near the thicket.
While they were intently occupied in council, Luther had managed to get
possession of these, and afterward distribute them among their owners,
cautioning them, ere he cut their cords, not to stir, unless they were
attacked, or heard a signal from him. Then approaching Kate in a
noiseless manner, just as she, regaining consciousness, was looking about
her in alarm, he whispered a few words of hope and consolation in her
ear, and freed her also, with the same injunction as to remaining
stationary. This done, he had regained the thicket, and appeared before
the savages in the manner already shown.</p>

<p>Terrified at the feats of the Necromancer, but maddened at the release
of their prisoner, no sooner had the Indians fairly hid themselves in the
thicket, than thoughts of vengeance took possession of their half crazy
brains, and they paused for consultation. Under the excitement they were
laboring, this was very short, and resulted in their decision to steal
upon the bound prisoners, tomahawk and scalp them, and return to their
homes. Led by the now infuriated Mugwa, they made a sally for the
purpose, and were bearing kown upon their supposed victims, when,
suddenly, to their unbounded astonishment, dismay, and terror, each
captive sprang behind his tree, and sent the contents of his rifle among
them. This, to the Indians, was a work of magic indeed; and overpowered
by amazement and terror, they paused for a moment irresolute. The next
they turned and darted away, uttering horrible yells, followed by the
whites. Three of their number had been wounded, but not so as to prevent
their flight, and in a few seconds all had gained the cover of the
thicket. Into this the whites were prudent enough not to venture, but
turned back, congratulating themselves upon their fortunate and timely
escape. Their first move was to reload their rifles, and thus be prepared
for a second attack, in case the savages should desire to renew the
contest&mdash;a proceeding, however, which was looked upon as highly
improbable. They then repaired to where Kate was standing, and all in a
body proceeded toward the Necromancer.</p>

<p>In their flight, the Indians had thrown away most of the garments
taken from Clifton, who hastily recovering these meantime, was now
enabled to appear before his friends, decently clad. Seeing Kate
approaching, he made one bound forward, caught her in his arms, and
pressed her to his heart in silence. The emotion of both was too deep for
words. His friends now crowded around him, and seizing his hand, one
after another, they allowed their tearful eyes to say what their tongues
had not power to utter. It was a solemn, but joyful meeting.</p>

<p>"Now," exclaimed Danvers, who was the first to break the silence, "let
us attempt to express our gratitude to this noble being;" and he pointed
toward Luther, who was quietly standing a few paces distant, holding the
outcast Moody by a firm grasp upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Ay, a thousand times bless him!" cried Kate, rushing forward and
kneeling at the feet of the Necromancer.</p>

<p>"Up, girl!" said Luther, solemnly. "Kneel to thy God, and not to frail
mortality like me."</p>

<p>"But we must bless you, nevertheless," returned Danvers, grasping the
hand unoccupied, "as the instrument of the Almighty, used in the
preservation of our lives."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay!" cried several voices; and each proceeded to express his
thanks in his own peculiar way.</p>

<p>"God bless you!" said one.</p>

<p>"May you live a thousand years!" said another.</p>

<p>"Forever!" put in a third.</p>

<p>"May flowers ever lie in your path, and the hand of innocence and
virtue, and the blessings of all who know you, smooth the passage of your
noble spirit to the vale of eternal Eden!" added Kate,
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Enough! enough!" rejoined Luther, waving his hand and turning away
his head:</p>

<p>As he did this, his eye fell upon Moody, who, pale as a corpse, stood
trembling and abashed, although not one of the party had as yet appeared
to notice his pres ence. "Here," he added, quickly, "take him, or
peradventure I repent and set him free."</p>

<p>A howl of indignation escaped two or three of the party, as they
sprang forward and seized him roughly.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" cried the now terrified outcast, who, since the appearance of
Luther, seemed to have become changed entirely, from a reckless, boasting
bully, to the veriest poltroon on earth. "Mercy! I will repent."</p>

<p>"Yes, such mercy's you gave, you'll git," replied one.</p>

<p>"And that'll be a high tree and short prayers," said another.</p>

<p>"Hist! d'ye see anything?" whispered David, at this moment, pointing
toward Ichabod, who, from some oversight, had been neglected, and was
still bound to his tree, patiently waiting to be set at liberty.</p>

<p>"Why, good heavens! there is the gardener, quite forgotten," rejoined
Clifton, taking a step forward to release him.</p>

<p>"Hist!" said David again, detaining Clifton with his hand.</p>

<p>The next instant his rifle was to his eye, and before any one could
comprehend what it meant, the piece belched forth its deadly contents. A
cry of mortal agony now rang upon the air, proceeding from a cluster of
bushes near which Ichabod stood bound.</p>

<p>"You'll find him there all right," said David, coolly, as some two or
three of the party set off to learn the result of his shot.</p>

<p>On coming up to the place, they were astonished at seeing an Indian
lying life-less upon his face. Turning him over, they recognised the grim
features of Unkee. More blood-thirsty and daring than his companions, he
had stealthily ventured hither to take the scalp of his prisoner; but the
quick ears and keen eyes of David had been too much for him, and he had
met his fate in the manner shown.</p>

<p>Releasing Ichabod, the party now returned, leaving the dead Indian to
be devoured by the beasts of the wilderness. The manner of Luther, as
they came up to the others, arrested the attention of all. He had turned
his face toward the west, placed his hands over his eyes, and now stood
swaying to and fro like some strong oak shaken by the blast&mdash;or,
like one whose mind is racked by some powerful thought. No one ventured
to address him, and all stood regarding him with awe and silence. At
length he removed his hands slowly, and turned his face toward the group.
Each started as they saw that countenance, over which, in so short a
time, had come a fearful change. His dark features were pale, and seemed
bloodless; his eye rolled more rapidly than usual in its socket; the lid
quivered more nervously, and the whole face was uncommonly agitated, as
if by some inward struggle.</p>

<p>"It is over," he said, at length, in a deep, guttural voice,
recovering himself, and assuming his wonted composure. "I see you are
surprised, my friends, to behold me thus. There is a cause for it&mdash;
but that cause you will never know. My time has now come to bid you
farewell. Many of you&mdash;perhaps all&mdash;will never behold me
more."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," cried Ernest and Kate, both in a breath, springing
forward, and each grasping a hand of the Necromancer. "Nay, do not leave
us!&mdash;why should you not go with us, and be provided for the
remainder of your days?"</p>

<p>"Ay, do accept their offer," added Danvers.</p>

<p>Luther shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"My friends," he said, "it cannot be. I thank you none the less,
however, for your kind offer&mdash;but it cannot be. My road lies
yonder;" and he waved his hand toward the west, as if to comprehend the
whole great forest, which then stretched over a vast and unexplored
territory. "My task here, peradventure, is ended. A restless something
within, tells me I must go&mdash;go&mdash;go&mdash;till I come to my last
haven of rest&mdash;the grave. Will you forget me when I am gone?" he
asked, with some emotion.</p>

<p>"Never! never!" cried all together.</p>

<p>Luther remained mute a moment, and then turning to Clifton,
resumed:</p>

<p>"Remember what I told you concerning the box! It is all important.
When she is thy wife (motioning his hand toward Kate), then, and not
before, know its contents."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Clifton, "I had forgotten; it is in the possession of
Moody;" and advancing at once to the outcast, who was still held by the
three young men, he took it from him, adding, as he returned to the side
of Luther, "I shall remember."</p>

<p>"Let it not pass from you again with life," said the Necromancer.
"Now, my friends, let me bid you a long adieu;" and beginning with
Danvers, he shook each warmly by the hand&mdash;leaving Ernest and Kate
to the last&mdash;giving each a warm "God bless you!" and receiving a
similar blesisng from lips that trembled, and eyes that grew moist, in
return.</p>

<p>When he had done, he strode up to Moody, and said, in a deep, solemn
voice:</p>

<p>" `The way of the transgressor is hard.' I had hoped this to be
otherwise&mdash;but a Higher Power has willed it so, and overruled me. It
is enough. With a sad heart I consign thee to the fate thou deservest. I
have warned thee, and spared thee, and given thee chances to
repent&mdash; but all in vain. Farewell! we may never meet
again&mdash;neither in this world, nor that which lies beyond the
tomb."</p>

<p>"Oh! save me this time&mdash;this once," cried the cowardly villian,
imploringly, "and, by all I hold sacred, I swear to you I will repent and
reform."</p>

<p>"Too late," returned Luther, sternly. "When last I saved thy life, I
said I would never interfere again. My word I never break. Farewell,
forever!" and he turned away abruptly.</p>

<p>Approaching Ernest and Kate, he once more grasped them by the hand,
and said:</p>

<p>" 'T is hard to leave you, but I must do it.</p>

<br>
 "The sun of hope Is In the sky, <br>
The angry clouds have floated by; <br>
Whate'er the past, remember this, <br>
The future has its store of bliss.

<p>"Farewell, till you behold me again, either in time, or (he paused,
and concluded impressively) eternity."</p>

<p>Without looking round, or saying more, he now strode steadily to the
thicket, paused a moment, and then parting the bushes with his hands,
disappeared, from many there present for the last time.</p>

<p>For something like a minute, the silence was unbroken. All were mute
and sad, and stood like statues, with their eyes fixed upon the spot
where the Necromancer was last seen.</p>

<p>"Come," said Clifton, "time wears, and we have a long journey before
us. We must, God willing, reach the settlement to-night."</p>

<p>"D'ye hear?" said one addressing Moody. "We've got a short job with
you first."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Clifton.</p>

<p>"Keep our oath," replied one. "We've sworn to hang this villian, if
ever we got him in our power agin. We've got him now, and won't be apt to
forget it."</p>

<p>"Had you not better take him to some settlement&mdash;to
Cincinnati&mdash;and have him tried legally? I cannot favor the movement
of taking vengeance into our own hands."</p>

<p>"It's no use for you to trouble yourself 'bout the matter, lieutenant,
axing your pardon!" replied David. "He's got to die, that's the short
on't; and sooner nor he 'scapes agin, I'll give him the contents o this;"
and he held up his long rifle.</p>

<p>"Come, dearest," said Clifton, who saw it would be useless to parley
louger with men who had been so deeply wronged: "Come, Kate, let us away;
we must leave him to his fate;" and taking her hand, he set forward,
followed by Danvers only, the others remaining with Moody.</p>

<p>As soon as the young officer and his party were fairly out of sight,
Grant turned to Moody and said:</p>

<p>"Come, wretch, down and say your prayers&mdash;if you've got any to
say&mdash;and make 'em short; for the rope's ready, and the tree's
waiting to blossom with your carcass. We'll see you dead this time,
anyhow, whether you come to life agin or not."</p>

<p>Moody, instead of complying, began to remonstrate and beg for his
life, which so enraged the party, that without waiting to listen, they
began to drag him for ward to the thicket, where lay his dead Indian
companion.</p>

<p>"Here's company for you," said Ichabod; "and as you plotted together
in this world, it'll be as well for ye to jine him straightway, and keep
him company in the next."</p>

<p>It so chanced that a strong sapling was growing exactly over the body
of the savage; and laying hold of this, three of of the party without
ceremony pulled the top down to the ground, while the rest employed
themselves in putting one end of a rope round the neck of the outcast,
and fastening the other to it. Then seeing that all was fast and ready,
one of the party said to Moody, whose very teeth were chattering with
terror:</p>

<p>"Now you're about to reap the reward of your crimes."</p>

<p>"Mercy!" gasped the guilty one.</p>

<p>"Git it after death, then," was the bitter reply.</p>

<p>"Ready all! Let her go!"</p>

<p>At the word, the sapling sprang upward nearly to its former place,
jerking Moody up with it by the neck, and there holding him, choking and
struggling in mid air. For a few minutes the party remained, watching the
struggles and awful contortions of visage of the victim to Lynch law,
until they gradually subsided, and one long, violent spasm, succeeded by
a straightening of the limbs, and perfect quiet&mdash;announced that the
erring and criminal Moody was still in death.</p>

<p>"Let's go!" said David, briefly, turning away with a shudder of
disgust.</p>

<p>No answer was returned; but as he left the thicket, he found each of
his companions at his heels, eager to quit the place of a sight so
horrible.</p>

<p>In a short time the party overtook the one in advance, when all pushed
forward in a body together. No questions were asked concerning the fate
of Moody, and no remarks made&mdash;each satisfied, apparently, to leave
the outcast to his fate.</p>

<p>Without incident worthy of note, the whole company reached the
settlement that night, and joined their anxious friends.</p>

<h3 align="CENTER"><a name="1_0_27">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h3>

<br>
 Mount on contemplation's wings, <br>
And mark the causes and the ends of things; <br>
Learn what we are, and for what purpose born. <br>
What station here 'tis given us to adorn.

<p>&mdash;Gifford.<br>
 Within the deep,<br>
Still chambers of the heart, a specter dim,<br>
Whose tones are like the wizzard voice of Time,<br>
Heard from the tombs of ages, points its cold<br>
And solemn finger to the beautiful<br>
And holy visions that have passed away,<br>
And left no shadow of their loveliness. Geo. D. Prentice.</p>

<p>How still the morning of the hallowed day&mdash; Mute is the voice of
rural labor.</p>

<p>&mdash;Graham.<br>
 To love, to bliss, their blended souls were given,<br>
And each, too happy, asked no other heaven, Dr. Dwight.</p>

<p>What a mighty contrast a few years presents, in a country just merging
from a state of barbarism to one of civilization and refinement! What a
vast change from the old primeval forest, where the native hunters of the
wood roamed unmolested by civilized man, to the busy city with its
thousand workshops, or the quiet hamlet of peace and plenty, or the well
cultivated, open farm of the industrious denizen of agriculture! What
wonderful change, by the mighty wand of the wizzard of Oriental tales,
could be more grand and imposing than the change which here, in this
bright land of the West, has been effected by the arch-enchanter Time, in
his steady progress of eternal revolution! Where is now the
Indian&mdash;with his terrible war-cry, his deadly rifle, his murderous
tomahawk, and his mutilating scalping-knife&mdash; which so troubled the
peace of our fathers, and made wailing, and wo, and terror among the
pale-faces of the frontiers? Where are now those tenants of the
wood&mdash;the panther, the bear, the catamount, the buffalo, the deer,
the copper-head and rattlesnake&mdash;which held their lairs in the great
forest at the opening of our story? Where, too, are those great forests
themselves, which stretched far away, from east to west, from north to
south? Gone&mdash;all gone; vanished as a dream; fled from before the
steps of the white man, as mists flee from the strides of the great
luminary of day.</p>

<p>Who that now sits in the heart of this great city, where thousands are
passing to and fro&mdash;hears the rumbling sound of many wheels as they
roll over the stony pavements, the voices of the venders, the noise of
industry, and beholds the display of fashion from all quarters of the
habitable globe&mdash;can realize that barely sixty years ago&mdash;only
sixty years&mdash;in the memory of many now living&mdash;on this very
ground swayed the inter locking branches of a great forest, unseen by the
eye, untouched by the hand of an Anglo Saxon? Who that now sees the
bright river winding like a belt of silver around our pleasant banks,
mirroring hundreds of houses in its tranquil bosom, and parting its
waters to the gliding motion of hundreds of magnificent steamers, and a
thousand smaller craft of all descriptions&mdash;can realize that sixty
years ago, the tall old trees of the wilderness threw their cool shadows
far over its glassy tide, then disturbed only by the fairy-like movements
of the Indian canoe? Who, say we, living here now, can realize all
this?&mdash;and yet it is but the letter of truth itself.</p>

<p>Strangely have the predictions of Blind Luther, the Necromancer, been
verified. The fifty years opening of the nineteenth century have been
pregnant with events that have caused a world to wonder, until wonder has
ceased altogether, and man now looks upon things beyond his first
comprehension as things which are to be. The city which Luther beheld in
his vision, with the eye of the mind, we behold with the naked eye of
corporeal substance. The great beast that was to be formed from the dust
of the earth, by the mechanism of man, with rolling legs, with speed
beyond the speed of the deer, and with strength exceeding an hundred
horse&mdash;we now behold daily. The great leviathans that were to plow
foaming channels in the mighty deep, rush against wind and tide, and
carry the sons of earth in their great bosoms&mdash;are already upon our
waters. The red lightning from the thunder-car of heaven has already been
drawn and sent courier throughout the civilized earth; and tho' ships do
not yet sail in the blue ether above us, and though tyranny still exists,
and liberty is not every where triumphant&mdash; yet we must remember the
prediction was made for the nineteenth century, of which more than half
is yet to appear, and we little know what is written in the yet unopened
book of time. Well may we of the present day exclaim, in the language of
Scripture: "What shall be the end of these things, and what the sign of
their coming."</p>

<p>In the opening chapter of this history, we presented a contrast
between the ancient and modern appearance of Columbia&mdash; which, in
itself, has altered less, perhaps, than in the improvements that environ
it. In place of the rough and serpentine horse-path, that connected it
with its sister village, Cincinnati, with here and there a solitary
traveler upon it&mdash;we have now a broad, smooth and beautiful
turnpike, shooting away from a thronged city, through the pleasant hamlet
of Fulton&mdash; since sprung into existence&mdash;and winding round the
base of Bald-Hill, at a height sufficient to overlook the quiet dwellings
reposing below, as also the broad plain so often mentioned&mdash;over
which roll teams of burden, stages and omnibuses for travelers and
citizens, and carriages for pleasure; while along its side can be traced
the dark lines of a railway, on which to and fro rush the "iron horses"
with great velocity, dragging their weighty burdens over three hundred
miles of territory, and connecting this point with the great lakes of the
north by a journey of only a few hours.</p>

<p>At the precise spot where the turnpike, winding around the base of
Bald-Hill, takes a more northern course, you have a delightful view of
the little knoll so frequently mentioned in these pages, as the ground on
which stood the first building erected solely to the worship of God by
the pioneers of the Miami Valley.</p>

<p>This knoll is only a few yards from the base of the hill on which you
stand, and is a spot well calculated to arrest the gaze of the observant
traveler. In appearance, it much resembles an Indian mound, being
somewhat oval and smooth. No building now adorns its summit; but the
ruins of one can there be seen, around which, covered with green sward,
are scattered the graves of many who worshiped within its walls in times
gone by, whose names, half obliterated from the crumbling stones above
them, speak the vanity and decay of earthly things, and the dirge to
whose memories is now only sung by the wailing wind, as it sighs through
the branches of the willow, the beach and the locust, waving above and
shadowing their last remains.</p>

<p>To this knoll, then&mdash;not as it appears now, but as it appeared at
the time of which we write, with its neat, but humble, building of
worship peeping through the grove that covered it&mdash;we must once more
call the readers attention; and if he like, he may stand and view it from
the self-same spot where but now he viewed the tombs of many who were
then in their rosy prime of life.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful Sabbath morning in the spring of 1792. All nature
seemed rejoicing and full of happiness. The icy hand of winter had been
lifted from the seemingly desolate earth, and everything appeared as
joyous as on the departure of a tyrannical ruler. The trees had put, or
were putting, forth their buds, their blossoms and leaves, and checkering
the forest with that beautiful variety of color, which renders it so
enchanting; while the earth had sent up her blade and her flowers of all
hues, until her surface seemed a carpet too rich almost to be pressed by
the foot of man. The warblers of the forest had already returned from
their journey to the sunny south, and now thronged the trees, and made
"earth vocal with their melody." Already had the husbandman put his seed
into the teeming earth, and the result was now visible in broad, green
squares of corn and wheat, destined, by the process of a few short
months, to be greeted as the golden harvest of plenty.</p>

<p>We have said it was a beautiful Sabbath morning. The sun, slowly
ascending to the zenith of his glory, rolled over an ocean of ethereal
blue, wherein not a cloud floated to mar its beauty, or check for an
instant his warmth, or cast a single shadow over the scene before us. A
gentle southern breeze swept down the hills of old Kentucky, rippled the
bosom of the Ohio, and came up the valley, freighted with the sweets of a
thousand flowers bearing to the ear the hum of ten thousand insects, and
the songs of a thousand warblers. Save these, all sounds were hushed.</p>

<p>It was Sabbath&mdash;the day set apart by Him who made the world, for
rest&mdash;and the weekly toil of the husbandman had ceased. Toward the
little sanctuary so often mentioned, a long line of villagers, male and
female, were taking their way, dressed in the simple costume of the time,
with no ostentatious display of fashion to rank one superior in point of
wealth to another. No solemn bell was sending its vibrations upon the
balmy air, to call them to the church of God. They knew it was the hour
bordering upon worship, and they set forth from their peaceful dwelling
places accordingly. Among them were all classes&mdash;from the youth to
the grey-beard&mdash;from the maidon of a few summers, to the hoary
matron whose feet already pressed the verge of the grave. Some were
grave, and some were gay&mdash; for all of course did not feel the
solemnity of the day&mdash;yet none behaved with indecorum.</p>

<p>In the front and rear of the church were stationed sentinels, with
their rifles upon their shoulders, past which the male portion of the
villagers bore their own arms, and, ascending the little knoll,
disappeared one after another, within the rude walls consecrated to the
worship of the Most High.</p>

<p>Around the door of the church, however, a small group of youths and
maidens lingered, with their eyes mostly bent in one direction, as if
expecting some person or persons from that quarter. At length one
exclaimed, "They come;" and the speaker pointed with his finger to a man
of venerable appearance, some fifty rods distant, who was seen coming up
the valley, accompanied by two couple of both sexes. As this party
ascended the knoll, the sentinels they passed, paused, touched their hats
respectfully, and resumed their patrol, while the group at the door
disappeared within.</p>

<p>In a short time, the last party crossed the threshold of the church,
amid a profound silence, and were met on all sides by an artillery of
eager eyes, from those already there assembled. A rude altar at the
farther end of the church, overlooked the rough benches in front, on
which the congregation was seated&mdash;and toward this the venerable
pastor and his young companions directed their steps. At the place
mentioned, the man of God paused, and facing the assemblage, raised his
hands aloft. Simultaneously all rose to their feet, and, after a short
silence, his tremulous voice was heard in solemn prayer. This ended, the
assemblage, with the exception of the pious pastor and the group which
had accompanied him to the altar, resumed their seats. Glancing round him
for a moment, the divine said:</p>

<p>"Friends, it now becomes my pleasant but solemn duty, to unite in the
holy rite of marriage, Ernest Clifton and Kate Clarendon, Albert Danvers
and Mary Argate."</p>

<p>Saying this, he addressed himsef to the party before him, and in a few
minutes the hands which were clasped together, clasped those of partners
for life. The ceremony over, the newly married took seats arranged behind
them, while the pastor, ascending the pulpit, read a text suitable to the
occasion, from which he delivered a most eloquent and able discourse.</p>

<p>On the return of Kate from captivity, she, at the earnest solicitation
of young Danvers and his sister, had taken up her abode in their father's
dwelling, where for many weeks she labored under a strong nervous
affection, caused by the many exciting events which we have chronicled,
among the most prominent of which was the horrible death of her mother.
Grief, violent, and some feared fatal, for a long time rankled deeply in
her affectionate breast, and hours, and days, and weeks of anguish had
been apportioned her. But Time, the great healer or destroyer of hearts
diseased, had gradually softened and soothed her feelings, and taught her
the vanity of mourning so severely an earthly loss, which a few short
years, at the most, would repay in the gain of a never ending eternity,
and a meeting with those she loved, to part no more forever.</p>

<p>Moreover, <i>all</i> she loved were not gone Around, on every side,
she felt she had kind, sympathizing friends, for whose sakes it was her
duty to appear somewhat resigned and cheerful; but, above all others, for
the sake of one, dear and beloved, whose happiness depended upon her own,
and to whom she now felt her own, drawn with a peculiar, sublime and
almost idolatrous affection, which she had never before known for earthly
being. She still had something to live for; an object to love, and feel
that in turn she was loved; and the thought of the living gradually took
the place of the dead. Spring came, and she was happy in the embrace of
one she could call her own forever.</p>

<p>Throughout the winter, Ernest had remained in the fort at Cincinnati,
though his visits to Columbia, on one pretense or another, had not been
like angels' visits, "few and far between;" but, on the contrary, had
been almost of daily occurrence. The many mysterious words of Luther had
made a deep impression upon his mind. He had thought of them by day, and
dreamed of them by night. Could they have any meaning? were they true? A
thousand times had he been tempted to open the mysterious box in his
possession, and know for a certainty; but as often a moral sense of
obligation to the commands of one who had so befriended, restrained
him.</p>

<p>"I will not," he said to himself, "until the time set for the purpose
has expired, and then I will know all."</p>

<p>It was late on the evening succeeding the marriage of Clifton, and in
a rude apartment of a dwelling, in the village so often named, sat the
young officer, by the side of a table on which stood a light, throwing
its gleams upon his noble and manly countenance, as, with the chin
resting on his hand, he contemplated in silence several manuscript papers
lying before him. The door opened, and a bright, fairy-like being glided
up to his side, and a soft, white hand was laid upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>Ernest started, and looking up, exclaimed, in rapture:</p>

<p>"Bless you, my own, dearest Kate&mdash; my wife!&mdash;<i>now</i> I
can make you happy;" and as he pressed his lips to hers, a tear of joy
stood in his eye.</p>

<p>"Ah! dear Ernest," answered Kate in a silvery voice, gazing tenderly
upon him, and parting the hair from his forehead; "why do you say
<i>now?</i> Could you not always make me happy? Could I be otherwise with
you?"</p>

<p>"But now more than ever! You remember the words and the gift of
Luther, dearest?"</p>

<p>"I do: the latter a silver box."</p>

<p>"Aye, and the contents of that box are now before you. First, here,"
continued Ernest, taking up a scroll; "on this are my horoscope and
destiny written. It looks old, and bears date 1770. In it I am styled
Ernest Bellington, son of Arthur Lord Bellington, twin brother of Albert
Bellington, and grandson of Edgar, Earl of Killingworth. The next, in
like manner, is the horoscope of my brother, since my foe, in the person
of Rashton Moody. The third is your own, and your destiny is marked to
run parallel to mine. But most important of all," pursued Ernest, with
sparkling eyes, "is this;" and he held aloft a parchment; "this, which
proves to my satisfaction my birthright."</p>

<p>"O, read it!" exclaimed Kate, with interest, seating herself by his
side, and looking fondly upon him.</p>

<p>"A kiss first, my little wife. There, now listen!" and Ernest began
the unraveling of a tale of mystery.</p>

<p>The story purported to be written by Luther Boreancy, othewise Blind
Luther. It was long, sometimes so metaphorical as to render the sense
almost obscure, and was altogether a remarkable document. We shall not
follow it in detail, but will give the contents in brief, in our own
language.</p>

<p>It stated that Arthur Lord Bellington, son of Edgar Earl of
Killingworth, being an only son, married, contrary to his father's
desire, an accomplished lady of small fortune and inferior birth. A
quarrel ensued, father and son became estranged, and finally, after the
birth of twin sons, the latter determined to embark for America. Before
he quitted the country, however, he took his infants to a magistrate, and
had tattooed in his presence, and in the presence of many witnesses,
under the left arm of each, the armorial bearings of his house, and the
initial letters of their names. Papers, stating the whole affair, were
then drawn up, and signed by all present, of which a copy was taken and
deposited in the archives of the capital. This accomplished, he embarked
for America with his family. On board the same vessel which carried him
out, was one who had made the tour of the world, and learned astrology
and the occult sciences of the Egyptions. He was consulted, and he in
turn consulted the stars, and predicted the sudden death of the young
lord and his lady. It came. Ship fever broke out, and Lady Bellington
sickened and died. Lord Bellington was attacked, and on his death-bed he
called the astrologer to him, and gave his infants into his charge, with
all the proofs concerning them, together with a large purse of money, and
begged that he would have them educated and brought up separately,
neither to know of his birthright until the Earl of Killingworth should
be no more. The astrologer promised, Lord Bellington died, and the former
kept his word. By a train of circumstances useless for us to mention, all
came to the West, and the rest the reader knows.</p>

<p>Such, in short, was the substance of the document which Ernest now
read to his bride; and accompanying it were all the proofs, and a
statement that the old peer was now deceased.</p>

<p>"And so, I suppose, the astrologer here mentioned is none other than
our Necromancer?" said Kate inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I infer, from what I have read," answered Ernest, "they are one and
the same; but further than that, the mystery seems as dark as ever. God
bless him, though, whoever he is! I should like to behold him once again,
whether mortal or spirit!"</p>

<p>"Behold, then! for he is mortal and here," said a deep voice, close at
hand.</p>

<p>Ernest sprang to his feet, with an exclamation of surprise, while Kate
uttered a cry of terror. Behind them stood Luther, quietly leaning on his
stick of witchhazel, and the door, through which he had softly entered,
was partly ajar.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" ejaculated Ernest, fastening his eyes steadily upon
Luther, with an expression of awe, "are you really flesh and blood?"</p>

<p>"Feel and have faith!" said Luther, advancing and extending his dark
hand to the young officer.</p>

<p>Ernest touched, pressed it in his own, and replied:</p>

<p>"There is no doubting that. But tell me, mysterious being, who art
thou?"</p>

<p>"All thou knowest is thine," replied Luther, gravely. "What thou
knowest not, is shut from thee forever. Question no further. I perceive
thou didst obey my request;" and he pointed to the papers on the table.
"How like you your destiny?"</p>

<p>"It is better than I ever hoped for in my dreams," replied Clifton
rapturouslv.</p>

<p>"Wear well thy honors, and when thou art rich, forget not the poor.
Whatever the past may have been, the future promises everything. With thy
new fortunes and bride, thou must become the envied of mortals. Farewell!
I bid thee farewell, and go forever from thy sight. Sweet lady (turning
to Kate), we shall meet no more on earth. I need not tell thee to be true
and loyal to thy husband, nor him to do the like by thee. I make one
prediction more. The world shall yet praise the wealth, the bounty, the
beauty and virtue of the Earl and the Countess of Killingworth.
Farewell!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he turned and strode out of the apartment.</p>

<p>"Stay!" cried Clifton, who had yet many questions to ask&mdash;but
Luther paused not.</p>

<p>Ernest and Kate sprang to the door. The moon, already on the wane,
faintly traced the outline of a tall figure, gliding toward the wood. One
moment, and it disappeared, and blind Luther was seen nevermore by those
who looked upon him as a guardian angel and benefactor.</p>

<p>Many long years after these events, however, a strange figure,
answering his description, was discovered in the wood by an old hunter.
He was lying on his side, his head resting upon an old knapsack. On
examination, it was found that he had been a long time dead. On the spot
where he ceased to breathe, a little rise of earth, and two rough stones
at his head and feet, mark out the last earthly resting place of a once
mysterious being. About his person were found some old papers, so worn
and soiled by time, that the writing thereof was mostly illegible. From
what little could be deciphered, it was conjectured by some that he was
once a nobleman of distinction, whom one cause or another had driven to
this country, and that, becoming partially deranged, he had conducted
himself in the manner we have shown. Others believed him possessed of
supernatural powers, and there were various opinions and conjectures; but
all amounted to surmises only; for none ever knew who he was, or whence
he came.</p>

<p>Soon after his marriage, Ernest threw up his commission in the army,
and, with his lovely wife, and her faithful serving man, Ichabod
Longtree, set out for Ireland, his ancestral home. The old peer was dead,
and the young lord had but little difficulty in proving his identity, and
taking his place among the proudest of the realm. A long rent-roll
secured him a vast income, and he lived in lordly splendor, the happiest
of mortals. The Countess of Killingsworth proved a dutiful and loving
wife; and the old Earl was heard in after years to tell his
grandchildren, he blessed the hour when first his eyes beheld the
fainting form of the lovely Kate Clarendon.</p>
