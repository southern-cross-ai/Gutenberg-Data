<h2><a name="s1"></a>MISS MARY PASK</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>It was not till the following spring that I plucked up courage to
tell Mrs. Bridgeworth what had happened to me that night at
Morgat.</p>

<p>In the first place, Mrs. Bridgeworth was in America; and after the
night in question I lingered on abroad for several months&mdash;not for
pleasure, God knows, but because of a nervous collapse supposed to be
the result of having taken up my work again too soon after my touch
of fever in Egypt. But, in any case, if I had been door to door with
Grace Bridgeworth I could not have spoken of the affair before, to
her or to any one else; not till I had been rest-cured and built up
again at one of those wonderful Swiss sanatoria where they clean the
cobwebs out of you. I could not even have written to her&mdash;not to save
my life. The happenings of that night had to be overlaid with layer
upon layer of time and forgetfulness before I could tolerate any
return to them.</p>

<p>The beginning was idiotically simple; just the sudden reflex of a
New England conscience acting on an enfeebled constitution. I had
been painting in Brittany, in lovely but uncertain autumn weather,
one day all blue and silver, the next shrieking gales or driving fog.
There is a rough little white-washed inn out on the Pointe du Raz,
swarmed over by tourists in summer but a sea-washed solitude in
autumn; and there I was staying and trying to do waves, when some one
said: "You ought to go over to Cape something else, beyond
Morgat."</p>

<p>I went, and had a silver-and-blue day there; and on the way back
the name of Morgat set up an unexpected association of ideas:
Morgat&mdash;Grace Bridgeworth&mdash;Grace's sister, Mary Pask&mdash;"You know my
darling Mary has a little place now near Morgat; if you ever go to
Brittany do go to see her. She lives such a lonely life&mdash;it makes me
so unhappy."</p>

<p>That was the way it came about. I had known Mrs. Bridgeworth well
for years, but had only a hazy intermittent acquaintance with Mary
Pask, her older and unmarried sister. Grace and she were greatly
attached to each other, I knew; it had been Grace's chief sorrow,
when she married my old friend Horace Bridgeworth, and went to live
in New York, that Mary, from whom she had never before been
separated, obstinately lingered on in Europe, where the two sisters
had been travelling since their mother's death. I never quite
understood why Mary Pask refused to join Grace in America. Grace said
it was because she was "too artistic"&mdash;but, knowing the elder Miss
Pask, and the extremely elementary nature of her interest in art, I
wondered whether it were not rather because she disliked Horace
Bridgeworth. There was a third alternative&mdash;more conceivable if one
knew Horace&mdash;and that was that she may have liked him too much. But
that again became untenable (at least I supposed it did) when one
knew Miss Pask: Miss Pask with her round flushed face, her innocent
bulging eyes, her old-maidish flat decorated with art-tidies, and her
vague and timid philanthropy. Aspire to Horace&mdash;!</p>

<p>Well, it was all rather puzzling, or would have been if it had
been interesting enough to be worth puzzling over. But it was not.
Mary Pask was like hundreds of other dowdy old maids, cheerful
derelicts content with their innumerable little substitutes for
living. Even Grace would not have interested me particularly if she
hadn't happened to marry one of my oldest friends, and to be kind to
his friends. She was a handsome capable and rather dull woman,
absorbed in her husband and children, and without an ounce of
imagination; and between her attachment to her sister and Mary Pask's
worship of her there lay the inevitable gulf between the feelings of
the sentimentally unemployed and those whose affections are
satisfied. But a close intimacy had linked the two sisters before
Grace's marriage, and Grace was one of the sweet conscientious women
who go on using the language of devotion about people whom they live
happily without seeing; so that when she said: "You know it's years
since Mary and I have been together&mdash;not since little Molly was born.
If only she'd come to America! Just think...Molly is six, and has
never seen her darling auntie..." when she said this, and added: "If
you go to Brittany promise me you'll look up my Mary," I was moved in
that dim depth of one where unnecessary obligations are
contracted.</p>

<p>And so it came about that, on that silver-and-blue afternoon, the
idea "Morgat&mdash;Mary Pask&mdash;to please Grace" suddenly unlocked the sense
of duty in me. Very well: I would chuck a few things into my bag, do
my day's painting, go to see Miss Pask when the light faded, and
spend the night at the inn at Morgat. To this end I ordered a rickety
one-horse vehicle to await me at the inn when I got back from my
painting, and in it I started out toward sunset to hunt for Mary
Pask...</p>

<p>As suddenly as a pair of hands clapped over one's eyes, the
sea-fog shut down on us. A minute before we had been driving over a
wide bare upland, our backs turned to a sunset that crimsoned the
road ahead; now the densest night enveloped us. No one had been able
to tell me exactly where Miss Pask lived; but I thought it likely
that I should find out at the fishers' hamlet toward which we were
trying to make our way. And I was right...an old man in a doorway
said: Yes&mdash;over the next rise, and then down a lane to the left that
led to the sea; the American lady who always used to dress in white.
Oh, <i>he</i> knew...near the <i>Baie des
Tr&eacute;pass&eacute;s</i>.</p>

<p>"Yes; but how can we see to find it? I don't know the place,"
grumbled the reluctant boy who was driving me.</p>

<p>"You will when we get there," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and the horse foundered meantime! I can't risk it, sir; I'll
get into trouble with the <i>patron</i>."</p>

<p>Finally an opportune argument induced him to get out and lead the
stumbling horse, and we continued on our way. We seemed to crawl on
for a long time through a wet blackness impenetrable to the glimmer
of our only lamp. But now and then the ball lifted or its folds
divided; and then our feeble light would drag out of the night some
perfectly commonplace object&mdash;a white gate, a cow's staring face, a
heap of roadside stones&mdash;made portentous and incredible by being thus
detached from its setting, capriciously thrust at us, and as suddenly
withdrawn. After each of these projections the darkness grew three
times as thick; and the sense I had had for some time of descending a
gradual slope now became that of scrambling down a precipice. I
jumped out hurriedly and joined my young driver at the horse's
head.</p>

<p>"I can't go on&mdash;I won't, sir!" he whimpered.</p>

<p>"Why, see, there's a light over there&mdash;just ahead!"</p>

<p>The veil swayed aside, and we beheld two faintly illuminated
squares in a low mass that was surely the front of a house.</p>

<p>"Get me as far as that&mdash;then you can go back if you like."</p>

<p>The veil dropped again; but the boy had seen the lights and took
heart. Certainly there was a house ahead of us; and certainly it must
be Miss Pask's, since there could hardly be two in such a desert.
Besides, the old man in the hamlet had said: "Near the sea"; and
those endless modulations of the ocean's voice, so familiar in every
corner of the Breton land that one gets to measure distances by them
rather than by visual means, had told me for some time past that we
must be making for the shore. The boy continued to lead the horse on
without making any answer. The fog had shut in more closely than
ever, and our lamp merely showed us the big round drops of wet on the
horse's shaggy quarters.</p>

<p>The boy stopped with a jerk. "There's no house&mdash;we're going
straight down to the sea."</p>

<p>"But you saw those lights, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I thought I did. But where are they now? The fog's thinner again.
Look&mdash;I can make out trees ahead. But there are no lights any
more."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the people have gone to bed," I suggested jocosely.</p>

<p>"Then hadn't we better turn back, sir?"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;two yards from the gate?"</p>

<p>The boy was silent: certainly there was a gate ahead, and
presumably, behind the dripping trees, some sort of dwelling. Unless
there was just a field and the sea...the sea whose hungry voice I
heard asking and asking, close below us. No wonder the place was
called the Bay of the Dead! But what could have induced the rosy
benevolent Mary Pask to come and bury herself there? Of course the
boy wouldn't wait for me...I knew that...the <i>Baie des
Tr&eacute;pass&eacute;s</i> indeed! The sea whined down there as if
it were feeding-time, and the Furies, its keepers, had forgotten
it...</p>

<p>There <i>was</i> the gate! My hand had struck against it. I felt
along to the latch, undid it, and brushed between wet bushes to the
house-front. Not a candle-glint anywhere. If the house were indeed
Miss Pask's, she certainly kept early hours...</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Night and fog were now one, and the darkness as thick as a
blanket. I felt vainly about for a bell. At last my hand came in
contact with a knocker and I lifted it. The clatter with which it
fell sent a prolonged echo through the silence; but for a minute or
two nothing else happened.</p>

<p>"There's no one there, I tell you!" the boy called impatiently
from the gate.</p>

<p>But there was. I had heard no steps inside, but presently a bolt
shot back, and an old woman in a peasant's cap pushed her head out.
She had set her candle down on a table behind her, so that her face,
aureoled with lacy wings, was in obscurity; but I knew she was old by
the stoop of her shoulders and her fumbling movements. The
candle-light, which made her invisible, fell full on my face, and she
looked at me.</p>

<p>"This is Miss Mary Pask's house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Her voice&mdash;a very old voice&mdash;was pleasant enough,
unsurprised and even friendly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell her," she added, shuffling off. "Do you think she'll
see me?" I threw after her.</p>

<p>"Oh, why not? The idea!" she almost chuckled. As she retreated I
saw that she was wrapped in a shawl and had a cotton umbrella under
her arm. Obviously she was going out&mdash;perhaps going home for the
night. I wondered if Mary Pask lived all alone in her hermitage.</p>

<p>The old woman disappeared with the candle and I was left in total
darkness. After an interval I heard a door shut at the back of the
house and then a slow clumping of aged <i>sabots</i> along the flags
outside. The old woman had evidently picked up her <i>sabots</i> in
the kitchen and left the house. I wondered if she had told Miss Pask
of my presence before going, or whether she had just left me there,
the butt of some grim practical joke of her own. Certainly there was
no sound within doors. The footsteps died out, I heard a gate
click&mdash;then complete silence closed in again like the fog.</p>

<p>"I wonder&mdash;" I began within myself; and at that moment a smothered
memory struggled abruptly to the surface of my languid mind.</p>

<p>"But she's <i>dead</i>&mdash;Mary Pask is <i>dead</i>!"</p>

<p>I almost screamed it aloud in my amazement. It was incredible, the
tricks my memory had played on me since my fever! I had known for
nearly a year that Mary Pask was dead&mdash;had died suddenly the previous
autumn&mdash;and though I had been thinking of her almost continuously for
the last two or three days it was only now that the forgotten fact of
her death suddenly burst up again to consciousness.</p>

<p>Dead! But hadn't I found Grace Bridge-worth in tears and crape the
very day I had gone to bid her good-bye before sailing for Egypt?
Hadn't she laid the cable before my eyes, her own streaming with
tears while I read: "Sister died suddenly this morning requested
burial in garden of house particulars by letter"&mdash;with the signature
of the American Consul at Brest, a friend of Bridgeworth's I seemed
to recall? I could see the very words of the message printed on the
darkness before me.</p>

<p>As I stood there I was a good deal more disturbed by the discovery
of the gap in my memory than by the fact of being alone in a
pitch-dark house, either empty or else inhabited by strangers. Once
before of late I had noted this queer temporary blotting-out of some
well-known fact; and here was a second instance of it. Decidedly, I
wasn't as well over my illness as the doctors had told me...Well, I
would get back to Morgat and lie up there for a day or two, doing
nothing, just eating and sleeping...</p>

<p>In my self-absorption I had lost my bearings, and no longer
remembered where the door was. I felt in every pocket in turn for a
match&mdash;but since the doctors had made me give up smoking, why should
I have found one?</p>

<p>The failure to find a match increased my sense of irritated
helplessness, and I was groping clumsily about the hall among the
angles of unseen furniture when a light slanted along the rough-cast
wall of the stairs. I followed its direction, and on the landing
above me I saw a figure in white shading a candle with one hand and
looking down. A chill ran along my spine, for the figure bore a
strange resemblance to that of Mary Pask as I used to know her.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's <i>you</i>!" she exclaimed in the cracked twittering
voice which was at one moment like an old woman's quaver, at another
like a boy's falsetto. She came shuffling down in her baggy white
garments, with her usual clumsy swaying movements; but I noticed that
her steps on the wooden stairs were soundless. Well&mdash;they would be,
naturally!</p>

<p>I stood without a word, gazing up at the strange vision above me,
and saying to myself: "There's nothing there, nothing whatever. It's
your digestion, or your eyes, or some damned thing wrong with you
somewhere&mdash;"</p>

<p>But there was the candle, at any rate; and as it drew nearer, and
lit up the place about me, I turned and caught hold of the
door-latch. For, remember, I had seen the cable, and Grace in
crape...</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter? I assure you, you don't disturb me!" the
white figure twittered; adding, with a faint laugh: "I don't have so
many visitors nowadays&mdash;"</p>

<p>She had reached the hall, and stood before me, lifting her candle
shakily and peering up into my face. "You haven't changed&mdash;not as
much as I should have thought. But I have, haven't I?" she appealed
to me with another laugh; and abruptly she laid her hand on my arm. I
looked down at the hand, and thought to myself: "<i>That</i> can't
deceive me."</p>

<p>I have always been a noticer of hands. The key to character that
other people seek in the eyes, the mouth, the modelling of the skull,
I find in the curve of the nails, the cut of the finger-tips, the way
the palm, rosy or sallow, smooth or seamed, swells up from its base.
I remembered Mary Pask's hand vividly because it was so like a
caricature of herself; round, puffy, pink, yet prematurely old and
useless. And there, unmistakably, it lay on my sleeve: but changed
and shrivelled&mdash;somehow like one of those pale freckled toadstools
that the least touch resolves to dust...Well&mdash;to dust? Of
course...</p>

<p>I looked at the soft wrinkled fingers, with their foolish little
oval finger-tips that used to be so innocently and naturally pink,
and now were blue under the yellowing nails&mdash;and my flesh rose in
ridges of fear.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in," she fluted, cocking her white untidy head on
one side and rolling her bulging blue eyes at me. The horrible thing
was that she still practised the same arts, all the childish wiles of
a clumsy capering coquetry. I felt her pull on my sleeve and it drew
me in her wake like a steel cable.</p>

<p>The room she led me into was&mdash;well, "unchanged" is the term
generally used in such cases. For as a rule, after people die, things
are tidied up, furniture is sold, remembrances are despatched to the
family. But some morbid piety (or Grace's instructions, perhaps) had
kept this room looking exactly as I supposed it had in Miss Pask's
lifetime. I wasn't in the mood for noting details; but in the faint
dabble of moving candle-light I was half aware of bedraggled
cushions, odds and ends of copper pots, and a jar holding a faded
branch of some late-flowering shrub. A real Mary Pask "interior"!</p>

<p>The white figure flitted spectrally to the chimney-piece, lit two
more candles, and set down the third on a table. I hadn't supposed I
was superstitious&mdash;but those three candles! Hardly knowing what I
did, I hurriedly bent and blew one out. Her laugh sounded behind
me.</p>

<p>"Three candles&mdash;you still mind that sort of thing? I've got beyond
all that, you know," she chuckled. "Such a comfort...such a sense of
freedom..." A fresh shiver joined the others already coursing over
me.</p>

<p>"Come and sit down by me," she entreated, sinking to a sofa. "It's
such an age since I've seen a living being!"</p>

<p>Her choice of terms was certainly strange, and as she leaned back
on the white slippery sofa and beckoned me with one of those unburied
hands my impulse was to turn and run. But her old face, hovering
there in the candle-light, with the unnaturally red cheeks like
varnished apples and the blue eyes swimming in vague kindliness,
seemed to appeal to me against my cowardice, to remind me that, dead
or alive, Mary Pask would never harm a fly.</p>

<p>"Do sit down!" she repeated, and I took the other corner of the
sofa.</p>

<p>"It's so wonderfully good of you&mdash;I suppose Grace asked you to
come?" She laughed again&mdash;her conversation had always been punctuated
by rambling laughter. "It's an event&mdash;quite an event! I've had so few
visitors since my death, you see."</p>

<p>Another bucketful of cold water ran over me; but I looked at her
resolutely, and again the innocence of her face disarmed me.</p>

<p>I cleared my throat and spoke&mdash;with a huge panting effort, as if I
had been heaving up a grave-stone. "You live here alone?" I brought
out.</p>

<p>"Ah, I'm glad to hear your voice&mdash;I still remember voices, though
I hear so few," she murmured dreamily. "Yes&mdash;I live here alone. The
old woman you saw goes away at night. She won't stay after dark...she
says she can't. Isn't it funny? But it doesn't matter; I like the
darkness." She leaned to me with one of her irrelevant smiles. "The
dead," she said, "naturally get used to it."</p>

<p>Once more I cleared my throat; but nothing followed.</p>

<p>She continued to gaze at me with confidential blinks. "And Grace?
Tell me all about my darling. I wish I could have seen her
again...just once." Her laugh came out grotesquely. "When she got the
news of my death&mdash;were you with her? Was she terribly upset?"</p>

<p>I stumbled to my feet with a meaningless stammer. I couldn't
answer&mdash;I couldn't go on looking at her.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see...it's too painful," she acquiesced, her eyes brimming,
and she turned her shaking head away.</p>

<p>"But after all...I'm glad she was so sorry...It's what I've been
longing to be told, and hardly hoped for. Grace forgets..." She stood
up too and flitted across the room, wavering nearer and nearer to the
door.</p>

<p>"Thank God," I thought, "she's going."</p>

<p>"Do you know this place by daylight?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"It's very beautiful. But you wouldn't have seen <i>me</i> then.
You'd have had to take your choice between me and the landscape. I
hate the light&mdash;it makes my head ache. And so I sleep all day. I was
just waking up when you came." She smiled at me with an increasing
air of confidence. "Do you know where I usually sleep? Down below
there&mdash;in the garden!" Her laugh shrilled out again. "There's a shady
corner down at the bottom where the sun never bothers one. Sometimes
I sleep there till the stars come out."</p>

<p>The phrase about the garden, in the consul's cable, came back to
me and I thought: "After all, it's not such an unhappy state. I
wonder if she isn't better off than when she was alive?"</p>

<p>Perhaps she was&mdash;but I was sure I wasn't, in her company. And her
way of sidling nearer to the door made me distinctly want to reach it
before she did. In a rush of cowardice I strode ahead of her&mdash;but a
second later she had the latch in her hand and was leaning against
the panels, her long white raiment hanging about her like
grave-clothes. She drooped her head a little sideways and peered at
me under her lashless lids.</p>

<p>"You're not going?" she reproached me.</p>

<p>I dived down in vain for my missing voice, and silently signed
that I was.</p>

<p>"Going going away? Altogether?" Her eyes were still fixed on me,
and I saw two tears gather in their corners and run down over the red
glistening circles on her cheeks. "Oh, but you mustn't," she said
gently. "I'm too lonely..."</p>

<p>I stammered something inarticulate, my eyes on the blue-nailed
hand that grasped the latch. Suddenly the window behind us crashed
open, and a gust of wind, surging in out of the blackness,
extinguished the candle on the nearest chimney-corner. I glanced back
nervously to see if the other candle were going out too.</p>

<p>"You don't like the noise of the wind? I do. It's all I have to
talk to...People don't like me much since I've been dead. Queer,
isn't it? The peasants are so superstitious. At times I'm really
lonely..." Her voice cracked in a last effort at laughter, and she
swayed toward me, one hand still on the latch.</p>

<p>"Lonely, lonely! If you knew how <i>lonely</i>! It was a lie when
I told you I wasn't! And now you come, and your face looks
friendly...and you say you're going to leave me! No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;you
shan't! Or else, why did you come? It's cruel...I used to think I
knew what loneliness was...after Grace married, you know. Grace
thought she was always thinking of me, but she wasn't. She called me
'darling,' but she was thinking of her husband and children. I said
to myself then: 'You couldn't be lonelier if you were dead.' But I
know better now...There's been no loneliness like this last
year's...none! And sometimes I sit here and think: 'If a man came
along some day and took a fancy to you?'" She gave another wavering
cackle. "Well, such things <i>have</i> happened, you know, even after
youth's gone...a man who'd had his troubles too. But no one came till
to-night...and now you say you're going!" Suddenly she flung herself
toward me. "Oh, stay with me, stay with me...just tonight...It's so
sweet and quiet here...No one need know...no one will ever come and
trouble us."</p>

<p>I ought to have shut the window when the first gust came. I might
have known there would soon be another, fiercer one. It came now,
slamming back the loose-hinged lattice, filling the room with the
noise of the sea and with wet swirls of fog, and dashing the other
candle to the floor. The light went out, and I stood there&mdash;we stood
there&mdash;lost to each other in the roaring coiling darkness. My heart
seemed to stop beating; I had to fetch up my breath with great heaves
that covered me with sweat. The door&mdash;the door&mdash;well, I knew I had
been facing it when the candle went. Something white and wraithlike
seemed to melt and crumple up before me in the night, and avoiding
the spot where it had sunk away I stumbled around it in a wide
circle, got the latch in my hand, caught my foot in a scarf or
sleeve, trailing loose and invisible, and freed myself with a jerk
from this last obstacle. I had the door open now. As I got into the
hall I heard a whimper from the blackness behind me; but I scrambled
on to the hall door, dragged it open and bolted out into the night. I
slammed the door on that pitiful low whimper, and the fog and wind
enveloped me in healing arms.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>When I was well enough to trust myself to think about it all again
I found that a very little thinking got my temperature up, and my
heart hammering in my throat. No use...I simply couldn't stand
it...for I'd seen Grace Bridgeworth in crape, weeping over the cable,
and yet I'd sat and talked with her sister, on the same sofa&mdash;her
sister who'd been dead a year!</p>

<p>The circle was a vicious one; I couldn't break through it. The
fact that I was down with fever the next morning might have explained
it; yet I couldn't get away from the clinging reality of the vision.
Supposing it <i>was</i> a ghost I had been talking to, and not a mere
projection of my fever? Supposing something survived of Mary
Pask&mdash;enough to cry out to me the unuttered loneliness of a lifetime,
to express at last what the living woman had always had to keep dumb
and hidden? The thought moved me curiously&mdash;in my weakness I lay and
wept over it. No end of women were like that, I supposed, and
perhaps, after death, if they got their chance they tried to use
it...Old tales and legends floated through my mind; the bride of
Corinth, the mediaeval vampire&mdash;but what names to attach to the
plaintive image of Mary Pask!</p>

<p>My weak mind wandered in and out among these visions and
conjectures, and the longer I lived with them the more convinced I
became that something <i>which had been Mary Pask</i> had talked with
me that night...I made up my mind, when I was up again, to drive back
to the place (in broad daylight, this time), to hunt out the grave in
the garden&mdash;that "shady corner where the sun never bothers one"&mdash;and
appease the poor ghost with a few flowers. But the doctors decided
otherwise; and perhaps my weak will unknowingly abetted them. At any
rate, I yielded to their insistence that I should be driven straight
from my hotel to the train for Paris, and thence transshipped, like a
piece of luggage, to the Swiss sanatorium they had in view for me. Of
course I meant to come back when I was patched up again...and
meanwhile, more and more tenderly, but more intermittently, my
thoughts went back from my snow-mountain to that wailing autumn night
above the <i>Baie des Tr&eacute;pass&eacute;s</i>, and the revelation
of the dead Mary Pask who was so much more real to me than ever the
living one had been.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>After all, why should I tell Grace Bridgeworth&mdash;ever? I had had a
glimpse of things that were really no business of hers. If the
revelation had been vouchsafed to me, ought I not to bury it in those
deepest depths where the inexplicable and the unforgettable sleep
together? And besides, what interest could there be to a woman like
Grace in a tale she could neither understand nor believe in? She
would just set me down as "queer"&mdash;and enough people had done that
already. My first object, when I finally did get back to New York,
was to convince everybody of my complete return to mental and
physical soundness; and into this scheme of evidence my experience
with Mary Pask did not seem to fit. All things considered, I would
hold my tongue.</p>

<p>But after a while the thought of the grave began to trouble me. I
wondered if Grace had ever had a proper grave-stone put on it. The
queer neglected look of the house gave me the idea that perhaps she
had done nothing&mdash;had brushed the whole matter aside, to be attended
to when she next went abroad. "Grace forgets," I heard the poor ghost
quaver...No, decidedly, there could be no harm in putting (tactfully)
just that one question about the care of the grave; the more so as I
was beginning to reproach myself for not having gone back to see with
my own eyes how it was kept...</p>

<p>Grace and Horace welcomed me with all their old friendliness, and
I soon slipped into the habit of dropping in on them for a meal when
I thought they were likely to be alone. Nevertheless my opportunity
didn't come at once&mdash;I had to wait for some weeks. And then one
evening, when Horace was dining out and I sat alone with Grace, my
glance lit on a photograph of her sister&mdash;an old faded photograph
which seemed to meet my eyes reproachfully.</p>

<p>"By the way, Grace," I began with a jerk, "I don't believe I ever
told you: I went down to that little place of...of your sister's the
day before I had that bad relapse."</p>

<p>At once her face lit up emotionally. "No, you never told me. How
sweet of you to go!" The ready tears overbrimmed her eyes. "I'm so
glad you did." She lowered her voice and added softly: "And did you
see her?"</p>

<p>The question sent one of my old shudders over me. I looked with
amazement at Mrs. Bridgeworth's plump face, smiling at me through a
veil of painless tears. "I do reproach myself more and more about
darling Mary," she added tremulously. "But tell me&mdash;tell me
everything."</p>

<p>There was a knot in my throat; I felt almost as uncomfortable as I
had in Mary Pask's own presence. Yet I had never before noticed
anything uncanny about Grace Bridgeworth. I forced my voice up to my
lips.</p>

<p>"Everything? Oh, I can't&mdash;." I tried to smile.</p>

<p>"But you did see her?"</p>

<p>I managed to nod, still smiling.</p>

<p>Her face grew suddenly haggard&mdash;yes, haggard! "And the change was
so dreadful that you can't speak of it? Tell me&mdash;was that it?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. After all, what had shocked me was that the
change was so slight&mdash;that between being dead and alive there seemed
after all to be so little difference, except that of a mysterious
increase in reality. But Grace's eyes were still searching me
insistently. "You must tell me," she reiterated. "I know I ought to
have gone there long ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; perhaps you ought." I hesitated. "To see about the grave, at
least..."</p>

<p>She sat silent, her eyes still on my face. Her tears had stopped,
but her look of solicitude slowly grew into a stare of something like
terror. Hesitatingly, almost reluctantly, she stretched out her hand
and laid it on mine for an instant. "Dear old friend&mdash;" she
began.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," I interrupted, "I couldn't get back myself to see
the grave...because I was taken ill the next day..."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; of course. I know." She paused. "Are you <i>sure</i>
you went there at all?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Sure? Good Lord&mdash;" It was my turn to stare. "Do you suspect me of
not being quite right yet?" I suggested with an uneasy laugh.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no...of course not...but I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Understand what? I went into the house...I saw everything, in
fact, but her grave..."</p>

<p>"Her grave?" Grace jumped up, clasping her hands on her breast and
darting away from me. At the other end of the room she stood and
gazed, and then moved slowly back.</p>

<p>"Then, after all&mdash;I wonder?" She held her eyes on me, half fearful
and half reassured. "Could it be simply that you never heard?"</p>

<p>"Never heard?"</p>

<p>"But it was in all the papers! Don't you ever read them? I meant
to write...I thought I <i>had</i> written...but I said: 'At any rate
he'll see it in the papers'...You know I'm always lazy about
letters..."</p>

<p>"See what in the papers?"</p>

<p>"Why, that she <i>didn't</i> die...She isn't dead! There isn't any
grave, my dear man! It was only a cataleptic trance...An
extraordinary case, the doctors say...But didn't she tell you all
about it&mdash;if you say you saw her?" She burst into half-hysterical
laughter: "Surely she must have told you that she wasn't dead?"</p>

<p>"No," I said slowly, "she didn't tell me that."</p>

<p>We talked about it together for a long time after that&mdash;talked on
till Horace came back from his men's dinner, after midnight. Grace
insisted on going in and out of the whole subject, over and over
again. As she kept repeating, it was certainly the only time that
poor Mary had ever been in the papers. But though I sat and listened
patiently I couldn't get up any real interest in what she said. I
felt I should never again be interested in Mary Pask, or in anything
concerning her.</p>

<h2><a name="s2"></a>THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The uniform newness of a new country gives peculiar relief to its
few relics of antiquity&mdash;a term which, in America, may fairly enough
be applied to any building already above ground when the colony
became a republic.</p>

<p>Groups of such buildings, little settlements almost unmarred by
later accretions, are still to be found here and there in the Eastern
states; and they are always productive of inordinate pride in those
who discover and live in them. A place of the sort, twenty years ago,
was Harpledon, on the New England coast, somewhere between Salem and
Newburyport. How intolerantly proud we all were of inhabiting it! How
we resisted modern improvements, ridiculed fashionable "summer
resorts," fought trolley-lines, overhead wires and telephones, wrote
to the papers denouncing municipal vandalism, and bought up (those of
us who could afford it) one little heavy-roofed house after another,
as the land-speculator threatened them! All this, of course, was on a
very small scale: Harpledon was, and is still, the smallest of towns,
hardly more than a village, happily unmenaced by industry, and almost
too remote for the week-end "flivver." And now that civic pride has
taught Americans to preserve and adorn their modest monuments,
setting them in smooth stretches of turf and nursing the elms of the
village green, the place has become far more attractive, and far
worthier of its romantic reputation, than when we artists and writers
first knew it. Nevertheless, I hope I shall never see it again;
certainly I shall not if I can help it...</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The elders of the tribe of summer visitors nearly all professed to
have "discovered" Harpledon. The only one of the number who never, to
my knowledge, put forth this claim was Waldo Cranch; and he had lived
there longer than any of us.</p>

<p>The one person in the village who could remember his coming to
Harpledon, and opening and repairing the old Cranch house (for his
family had been India merchants when Harpledon was a thriving
sea-port)&mdash;the only person who went back far enough to antedate Waldo
Cranch was an aunt of mine, old Miss Lucilla Selwick, who lived in
the Selwick house, itself a stout relic of India merchant days, and
who had been sitting at the same window, watching the main street of
Harpledon, for seventy years and more to my knowledge. But
unfortunately the long range of Aunt Lucilla's memory often made it
hit rather wide of the mark. She remembered heaps and heaps of
far-off things; but she almost always remembered them wrongly. For
instance, she used to say: "Poor Polly Everitt! How well I remember
her, coming up from the beach one day screaming, and saying she'd
seen her husband drowning before her eyes"&mdash;whereas every one knew
that Mrs. Everitt was on a picnic when her husband was drowned at the
other end of the world, and that no ghostly premonition of her loss
had reached her. And whenever Aunt Lucilla mentioned Mr. Cranch's
coming to live at Harpledon she used to say: "Dear me, I can see him
now, driving by on that rainy afternoon in Denny Brine's old
carry-all, with a great pile of bags and bundles, and on top of them
a black and white hobby-horse with a real mane&mdash;the very handsomest
hobby-horse I ever saw." No persuasion could induce her to dissociate
the image of this prodigious toy from her first sight of Waldo
Cranch, most incurable of bachelors, and least concerned with the
amusing of other people's children, even those of his best friends.
In this case, to be sure, her power of evocation had a certain
success. Some one told Cranch&mdash;Mrs. Durant I think it must have
been&mdash;and I can still hear his hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"What could it have been that she saw?" Mrs. Durant questioned;
and he responded gaily: "Why not simply the symbol of my numerous
tastes?" Which&mdash;as Cranch painted and gardened and made music (even
composed it)&mdash;seemed so happy an explanation that for long afterward
the Cranch house was known to us as Hobby-Horse Hall.</p>

<p>It will be seen that Aunt Lucilla's reminiscences, though they
sometimes provoked a passing amusement, were neither accurate nor
illuminating. Naturally, nobody paid much attention to them, and we
had to content ourselves with regarding Waldo Cranch, hale and hearty
and social as he still was, as an Institution already venerable when
the rest of us had first apprehended Harpledon. We knew, of course,
the chief points in the family history: that the Cranches had been
prosperous merchants for three centuries, and had intermarried with
other prosperous families; that one of them, serving his business
apprenticeship at Malaga in colonial days, had brought back a Spanish
bride, to the bewilderment of Harpledon; and that Waldo Cranch
himself had spent a studious and wandering youth in Europe. His
Spanish great-grandmother's portrait still hung in the old house; and
it was a long-standing joke at Harpledon that the young Cranch who
went to Malaga, where he presumably had his pick of Spanish beauties,
should have chosen so dour a specimen. The lady was a forbidding
character on the canvas: very short and thickset, with a huge wig of
black ringlets, a long harsh nose, and one shoulder perceptibly above
the other. It was characteristic of Aunt Lucilla Selwick that in
mentioning this swart virago she always took the tone of elegy. "Ah,
poor thing, they say she never forgot the sunshine and orange
blossoms, and pined off early, when her queer son Calvert was hardly
out of petticoats. A strange man Calvert Cranch was; but he married
Euphemia Waldo of Wood's Hole, the beauty, and had two sons, one
exactly like Euphemia, the other made in his own image. And they do
say that one was so afraid of his own face that he went back to Spain
and died a monk&mdash;if you'll believe it," she always concluded with a
Puritan shudder.</p>

<p>This was all we knew of Waldo Cranch's past; and he had been so
long a part of Harpledon that our curiosity seldom ranged beyond his
coming there. He was our local ancestor; but it was a mark of his
studied cordiality and his native tact that he never made us feel his
priority. It was never he who embittered us with allusions to the
picturesqueness of the old light-house before it was rebuilt, or the
paintability of the vanished water-mill; he carried his distinction
so far as to take Harpledon itself for granted, carelessly, almost
condescendingly&mdash;as if there had been rows and rows of them strung
along the Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>Yet the Cranch house was really something to brag about.
Architects and photographers had come in pursuit of it long before
the diffused quaintness of Harpledon made it the prey of the magazine
illustrator. The Cranch house was not quaint; it owed little to the
happy irregularities of later additions, and needed no such help.
Foursquare and stern, built of a dark mountain granite (though all
the other old houses in the place were of brick or wood), it stood at
the far end of the green, where the elms were densest and the village
street faded away between blueberry pastures and oakwoods.</p>

<p>A door with a white classical portico was the only eighteenth
century addition. The house kept untouched its heavy slate roof, its
low windows, its sober cornice and plain interior panelling&mdash;even the
old box garden at the back, and the pagoda-roofed summer house, could
not have been much later than the house. I have said that the latter
owed little to later additions; yet some people thought the wing on
the garden side was of more recent construction. If it was, its
architect had respected the dimensions and detail of the original
house, simply giving the wing one less story, and covering it with a
lower-pitched roof. The learned thought that the kitchen and offices,
and perhaps the slaves' quarters, had originally been in this wing;
they based their argument on the fact of there being no windows, but
only blind arches, on the side toward the garden, Waldo Cranch said
he didn't know; he had found the wing just as it was now, with a big
empty room on the ground floor, that he used for storing things, and
a few low-studded bedchambers above. The house was so big that he
didn't need any of these rooms, and had never bothered about them.
Once, I remember, I thought him a little short with a fashionable
Boston architect who had insisted on Mrs. Durant's bringing him to
see the house, and who wanted to examine the windows on the farther,
the invisible, side of the wing.</p>

<p>"Certainly," Cranch had agreed. "But you see those windows look on
the kitchen-court and the drying-ground. My old housekeeper and the
faithful retainers generally sit there in the afternoons in hot
weather, when their work is done, and they've been with me so long
that I respect their habits. At some other hour, if you'll come
again&mdash;. You're going back to Boston tomorrow? So sorry! Yes, of
course, you can photograph the front as much as you like. It's used
to it." And he showed out Mrs. Durant and her protege.</p>

<p>When he came back a frown still lingered on his handsome brows.
"I'm getting sick of having this poor old house lionized. No one
bothered about it or me when I first came back to live here," he
said. But a moment later he added, in his usual kindly tone: "After
all, I suppose I ought to be pleased."</p>

<p>If anyone could have soothed his annoyance, and even made it
appear unreasonable, it was Mrs. Durant. The fact that it was to her
he had betrayed his impatience struck us all, and caused me to
remark, for the first time, that she was the only person at Harpledon
who was not afraid of him. Yes; we all were, though he came and went
among us with such a show of good-fellowship that it took this
trifling incident to remind me of his real aloofness. Not one of us
but would have felt a slight chill at his tone to the Boston
architect; but then I doubt if any of us but Mrs. Durant would have
dared to bring a stranger to the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Durant was a widow who combined gray hair with a
still-youthful face at a time when this happy union was less
generally fashionable than now. She had come to Harpledon among the
earliest summer colonists, and had soon struck up a friendship with
Waldo Cranch. At first Harpledon was sure they would marry; then it
became sure they wouldn't; for a number of years now it had wondered
why they hadn't. These conjectures, of which the two themselves could
hardly have been unaware, did not seem to trouble the even tenor of
their friendship. They continued to meet as often as before, and Mrs.
Durant continued to be the channel for transmitting any request or
inquiry that the rest of us hesitated to put to Cranch. "We know he
won't refuse you," I once said to her; and I recall the half-lift of
her dark brows above a pinched little smile. "Perhaps," I thought,
"he <i>has</i> refused her&mdash;once." If so, she had taken her failure
gallantly, and Cranch appeared to find an undiminished pleasure in
her company. Indeed, as the years went on their friendship grew
closer; one would have said he was dependent on her if one could have
pictured Cranch as dependent on anybody. But whenever I tried to do
this I was driven back to the fundamental fact of his isolation.</p>

<p>"He could get on well enough without any of us," I thought to
myself, wondering if this remoteness were inherited from the homesick
Spanish ancestress. Yet I have seldom known a more superficially
sociable man than Cranch. He had many talents, none of which perhaps
went as far as he had once confidently hoped; but at least he used
them as links with his kind instead of letting them seclude him in
their jealous hold. He was always eager to show his sketches, to read
aloud his occasional articles in the lesser literary reviews, and
above all to play his new compositions to the musically-minded among
us; or rather, since "eager" is hardly the term to apply to his calm
balanced manner, I should say that he was affably ready to show off
his accomplishments. But then he may have regarded doing so as one of
the social obligations: I had felt from the first that, whatever
Cranch did, he was always living up to some self-imposed and
complicated standard. Even his way of taking off his hat struck me as
the result of more thought than most people give to the act; his very
absence of flourish lent it an odd importance.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It was the year of Harpledon's first "jumble sale" that all these
odds and ends of observation first began to connect themselves in my
mind.</p>

<p>Harpledon had decided that it ought to have a village hospital and
dispensary, and Cranch was among the first to promise a subscription
and to join the committee. A meeting was called at Mrs. Durant's and
after much deliberation it was decided to hold a village fair and
jumble sale in somebody's grounds; but whose? We all hoped Cranch
would lend his garden; but no one dared to ask him. We sounded each
other cautiously, before he arrived, and each tried to shift the
enterprise to his neighbour; till at last Homer Davids, our chief
celebrity as a painter, and one of the shrewdest heads in the
community, said drily: "Oh, Cranch wouldn't care about it."</p>

<p>"How do you know he wouldn't?" some one queried.</p>

<p>"Just as you all do; if not, why is it that you all want some one
else to ask him?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Durant hesitated. "I'm sure&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, all right, then! <i>You</i> ask him," rejoined Davids
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I can't always be the one&mdash;"</p>

<p>I saw her embarrassment, and volunteered: "If you think there's
enough shade in my garden..."</p>

<p>By the way their faces lit up I saw the relief it was to them all
not to have to tackle Cranch. Yet why, having a garden he was proud
of, need he have been displeased at the request?</p>

<p>"Men don't like the bother," said one of our married ladies; which
occasioned the proper outburst of praise for my unselfishness, and
the observation that Cranch's maids, who had all been for years in
his service, were probably set in their ways, and wouldn't care for
the confusion and extra work. "Yes, old Catherine especially; she
guards the place like a dragon," one of the ladies remarked; and at
that moment Cranch appeared. Having been told what had been settled
he joined with the others in complimenting me; and we began to plan
for the jumble sale.</p>

<p>The men needed enlightenment on this point, I as much as the rest,
but the prime mover immediately explained: "Oh, you just send any old
rubbish you've got in the house."</p>

<p>We all welcomed this novel way of clearing out our cupboards,
except Cranch who, after a moment, and with a whimsical wrinkling of
his brows, said: "But I haven't got any old rubbish."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, children's cast-off toys for instance," a newcomer
threw out at random.</p>

<p>There was a general smile, to which Cranch responded with one of
his rare expressive gestures, as who should say: "<i>Toys</i>&mdash;in my
house? But whose?"</p>

<p>I laughed, and one of the ladies, remembering our old joke, cried
out: "Why, but the hobby-horse!"</p>

<p>Cranch's face became a well-bred blank. Long-suffering courtesy
was the note of the voice in which he echoed: "Hobbyhorse&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Don't you remember?" It was Mrs. Durant who prompted him. "Our
old joke? The wonderful black-and-white hobby-horse that Miss Lucilla
Selwick said she saw you driving home with when you first arrived
here? It had a real mane." Her colour rose a little as she spoke.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause, while Cranch's brow remained puzzled;
then a smile slowly cleared his face. "Of course!" he said. "I'd
forgotten. Well, I feel now that I <i>was</i> young enough for toys
thirty years ago; but I didn't feel so then. And we should have to
apply to Miss Selwick to know what became of that hobby-horse.
Meanwhile," he added, putting his hand in his pocket, "here's a small
offering to supply some new ones for the fair."</p>

<p>The offering was not small: Cranch always gave liberally, yet
always produced the impression of giving indifferently. Well, one
couldn't have it both ways; some of our most gushing givers were the
least lavish. The committee was delighted...</p>

<p>"It was queer," I said afterward to Mrs. Durant. "Why did the
hobby-horse joke annoy Cranch? He used to like it."</p>

<p>She smiled. "He may think it's lasted long enough. Harpledon jokes
<i>do</i> last, you know."</p>

<p>Yes; perhaps they did, though I had never thought of it
before.</p>

<p>"There's one thing that puzzles me," I went on; "I never know
beforehand what is going to annoy him."</p>

<p>She pondered. "I'll tell you, then," she said suddenly. "It has
annoyed him that no one thought of asking him to give one of his
water-colours to the sale."</p>

<p>"Didn't we?"</p>

<p>"No. Homer Davids was asked, and that made it...rather more
marked..."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course! I suppose we all forgot&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked away. "Well," she said, "I don't suppose he likes to be
forgotten."</p>

<p>"You mean: to have his accomplishments forgotten?"</p>

<p>"Isn't that a little condescending? I should say, his
<i>gifts</i>," she corrected a trifle sharply. Sharpness was so
unusual in her that she may have seen my surprise, for she added, in
her usual tone: "After all, I suppose he's our most brilliant man,
isn't he?" She smiled a little, as if to take the sting from my doing
so.</p>

<p>"Of course he is," I rejoined. "But all the more reason&mdash;how could
a man of his kind resent such a trifling oversight? I'll write at
once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>don't!</i>" she cut me short, almost pleadingly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Durant's word was law: Cranch was not asked for a
water-colour. Homer Davids's, I may add, sold for two thousand
dollars, and paid for a heating-system for our hospital. A Boston
millionaire came down on purpose to buy the picture. It was a great
day for Harpledon.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>About a week after the fair I went one afternoon to call on Mrs.
Durant, and found Cranch just leaving. His greeting, as he hurried
by, was curt and almost hostile, and his handsome countenance so
disturbed and pale that I hardly recognized him. I was sure there
could be nothing personal in his manner; we had always been on good
terms, and, next to Mrs. Durant, I suppose I was his nearest friend
at Harpledon&mdash;if ever one could be said to get near Waldo Cranch!
After he had passed me I stood hesitating at Mrs. Durant's open
door&mdash;front doors at Harpledon were always open in those friendly
days, except, by the way, Cranch's own, which the stern Catherine
kept chained and bolted. Since meeting me could not have been the
cause of his anger, it might have been excited by something which had
passed between Mrs. Durant and himself; and if that were so, my call
was probably inopportune. I decided not to go in, and was turning
away when I heard hurried steps, and Mrs. Durant's voice. "Waldo!"
she said.</p>

<p>I suppose I had always assumed that she called him so; yet the
familiar appellation startled me, and made me feel more than ever in
the way. None of us had ever given Cranch his Christian name.</p>

<p>Mrs. Durant checked her steps, perceiving that the back in the
doorway was not Cranch's but mine. "Oh, do come in," she murmured,
with an attempt at ease.</p>

<p>In the little drawing-room I turned and looked at her. She, too,
was visibly disturbed; not angry, as he had been, but showing, on her
white face and reddened lids, the pained reflection of his anger. Was
it against her, then, that he had manifested it? Probably she guessed
my thought, or felt her appearance needed to be explained, for she
added quickly: "Mr. Cranch has just gone. Did he speak to you?"</p>

<p>"No. He seemed in a great hurry."</p>

<p>"Yes...I wanted to beg him to come back...to try to quiet
him..."</p>

<p>She saw my bewilderment, and picked up a copy of an illustrated
magazine which had been tossed on the sofa. "It's that&mdash;" she
said.</p>

<p>The pages fell apart at an article entitled: "Colonial Harpledon,"
the greater part of which was taken up by a series of clever sketches
signed by the Boston architect whom she had brought to Cranch's a few
months earlier.</p>

<p>Of the six or seven drawings, four were devoted to the Cranch
house. One represented the facade and its pillared gates, a second
the garden front with the windowless side of the wing, the third a
corner of the box garden surrounding the Chinese summer-house; while
the fourth, a full-page drawing, was entitled: "The back of the
slaves' quarters and service-court: quaint window-grouping."</p>

<p>On that picture the magazine had opened; it was evidently the one
which had been the subject of discussion between my hostess and her
visitor.</p>

<p>"You see...you see..." she cried.</p>

<p>"This picture? Well, what of it? I suppose it's the far side of
the wing&mdash;the side we've never any of us seen."</p>

<p>"Yes; that's just it. He's horribly upset..."</p>

<p>"Upset about what? I heard him tell the architect he could come
back some other day and see the wing...some day when the maids were
not sitting in the court; wasn't that it?"</p>

<p>She shook her head tragically. "He didn't mean it. Couldn't you
tell by the sound of his voice that he didn't?"</p>

<p>Her tragedy airs were beginning to irritate me. "I don't know that
I pay as much attention as all that to the sound of his voice."</p>

<p>She coloured, and choked back her tears. "I know him so well; I'm
always sorry to see him lose his self-control. And then he considers
me responsible."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"It was I who took the wretched man there. And of course it was an
indiscretion to do that drawing; he was never really authorized to
come back. In fact, Mr. Cranch gave orders to Catherine and all the
other servants not to let him in if he did."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"One of the maids seems to have disobeyed the order; Mr. Cranch
imagines she was bribed. He has been staying in Boston, and this
morning, on the way back, he saw this magazine at the book-stall at
the station. He was so horrified that he brought it to me. He came
straight from the train without going home, so he doesn't yet know
how the thing happened."</p>

<p>"It doesn't take much to horrify him," I said, again unable to
restrain a faint sneer.</p>

<p>"What's the harm in the man's having made that sketch?"</p>

<p>"Harm?" She looked surprised at my lack of insight. "No actual
harm, I suppose; but it was very impertinent; and Mr. Cranch resents
such liberties intensely. He's so punctilious."</p>

<p>"Well, we Americans are not punctilious, and being one himself, he
ought to know it by this time."</p>

<p>She pondered again. "It's his Spanish blood, I suppose...he's
frightfully proud." As if this were a misfortune, she added: "I'm
very sorry for him."</p>

<p>"So am I, if such trifles upset him."</p>

<p>Her brows lightened. "Ah, that's what I tell him&mdash;such things
<i>are</i> trifles, aren't they? As I said just now: 'Your life's
been too fortunate, too prosperous. That's why you're so easily put
out.'"</p>

<p>"And what did he answer?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it only made him angrier. He said: 'I never expected that
from <i>you</i>'&mdash;that was when he rushed out of the house." Her
tears flowed over, and seeing her so genuinely perturbed I restrained
my impatience, and took leave after a few words of sympathy.</p>

<p>Never had Harpledon seemed to me more like a tea-cup than with
that silly tempest convulsing it. That there should be grownup men
who could lose their self-command over such rubbish, and women to
tremble and weep with them! For a moment I felt the instinctive
irritation of normal man at such foolishness; yet before I reached my
own door I was as mysteriously perturbed as Mrs. Durant.</p>

<p>The truth was, I had never thought of Cranch as likely to lose his
balance over trifles. He had never struck me as unmanly; his quiet
manner, his even temper, showed a sound sense of the relative
importance of things. How then could so petty an annoyance have
thrown him into such disorder?</p>

<p>I stopped short on my threshold, remembering his face as he
brushed past me. "Something <i>is</i> wrong; really wrong," I
thought. But what? Could it be jealousy of Mrs. Durant and the Boston
architect? The idea would not bear a moment's consideration, for I
remembered <i>her</i> face too.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if it's his silly punctilio," I grumbled, trying to
reassure myself, and remaining, after all, as much perplexed as
before.</p>

<p>All the next day it poured, and I sat at home among my books. It
must have been after ten in the evening when I was startled by a
ring. The maids had gone to bed, and I went to the door, and opened
it to Mrs. Durant. Surprised at the lateness of her visit, I drew her
in out of the storm. She had flung a cloak over her light dress, and
the lace scarf on her head dripped with rain. Our houses were only a
few hundred yards apart, and she had brought no umbrella, nor even
exchanged her evening slippers for heavier shoes.</p>

<p>I took her wet cloak and scarf and led her into the library. She
stood trembling and staring at me, her face like a marble mask in
which the lips were too rigid for speech; then she laid a sheet of
note-paper on the table between us. On it was written, in Waldo
Cranch's beautiful hand: "My dear friend, I am going away on a
journey. You will hear from me," with his initials beneath. Nothing
more. The letter bore no date.</p>

<p>I looked at her, waiting for an explanation. None came. The first
word she said was: "Will you come with me&mdash;now, at once?"</p>

<p>"Come with you&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>"To his house&mdash;before he leaves. I've only just got the letter,
and I daren't go alone..."</p>

<p>"Go to Cranch's house? But I...at this hour...What is it you are
afraid of?" I broke out, suddenly looking into her eyes.</p>

<p>She gave me back my look, and her rigid face melted. "I don't
know&mdash;any more than you do&mdash;That's why I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"But I know nothing. What on earth has happened since I saw you
yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Nothing till I got this letter."</p>

<p>"You haven't seen him?"</p>

<p>"Not since you saw him leave my house yesterday."</p>

<p>"Or had any message&mdash;any news of him?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely nothing. I've just sat and remembered his face."</p>

<p>My perplexity grew. "But surely you can't imagine...If you're as
frightened as that you must have some other reason for it," I
insisted.</p>

<p>She shook her head wearily. "It's the having none that frightens
me. Oh, do come!"</p>

<p>"You think his leaving in this way means that he's in some kind of
trouble?"</p>

<p>"In dreadful trouble."</p>

<p>"And you don't know why?"</p>

<p>"No more than you do!" she repeated.</p>

<p>I pondered, trying to avoid her entreating eyes. "But at this
hour&mdash;come, do consider! I don't know Cranch so awfully well. How
will he take it? You say he made a scene yesterday about that silly
business of the architect's going to his house without leave..."</p>

<p>"That's just it. I feel as if his going away might be connected
with that."</p>

<p>"But then he's mad!" I exclaimed. "No; not mad.
Only&mdash;desperate."</p>

<p>I stood irresolute. It was evident that I had to do with a woman
whose nerves were in fiddle-strings. What had reduced them to that
state I could not conjecture, unless, indeed, she were keeping back
the vital part of her confession. But that, queerly enough, was not
what I suspected. For some reason I felt her to be as much in the
dark over the whole business as I was; and that added to the
strangeness of my dilemma.</p>

<p>"Do you know in the least what you're going for?" I asked at
length.</p>

<p>"No, no, no&mdash;but come!"</p>

<p>"If he's there, he'll kick us out, most likely; kick <i>me</i>
out, at any rate."</p>

<p>She did not answer; I saw that in her anguish she was past
speaking. "Wait till I get my coat," I said.</p>

<p>She took my arm, and side by side we hurried in the rain through
the shuttered village. As we passed the Selwick house I saw a light
burning in old Miss Selwick's bedroom window. It was on the tip of my
tongue to say: "Hadn't we better stop and ask Aunt Lucilla what's
wrong? She knows more about Cranch than any of us!"</p>

<p>Then I remembered Cranch's expression the last time Aunt Lucilla's
legend of the hobby-horse had been mentioned before him&mdash;the day we
were planning the jumble sale&mdash;and a sudden shiver checked my
pleasantry. "He looked then as he did when he passed me in the
doorway yesterday," I thought; and I had a vision of my ancient
relative, sitting there propped up in her bed and looking quietly
into the unknown while all the village slept. Was she aware, I
wondered, that we were passing under her window at that moment, and
did she know what would await us when we reached our destination?</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Mrs. Durant, in her thin slippers, splashed on beside me through
the mud.</p>

<p>"Oh," she exclaimed, stopping short with a gasp, "look at the
lights!"</p>

<p>We had crossed the green, and were groping our way under the dense
elm-shadows, and there before us stood the Cranch house, all its
windows illuminated. It was the only house in the village except Miss
Selwick's that was not darkened and shuttered.</p>

<p>"Well, he can't be gone; he's giving a party, you see," I said
derisively.</p>

<p>My companion made no answer. She only pulled me forward, and
yielding once more I pushed open the tall entrance gates. In the
brick path I paused. "Do you still want to go in?" I asked.</p>

<p>"More than ever!" She kept her tight clutch on my arm, and I
walked up the path at her side and rang the bell.</p>

<p>The sound went on jangling for a long time through the stillness;
but no one came to the door. At length Mrs. Durant laid an impatient
hand on the door-panel. "But it's open!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>It was probably the first time since Waldo Cranch had come back to
live in the house that unbidden visitors had been free to enter it.
We looked at each other in surprise and I followed Mrs. Durant into
the lamplit hall. It was empty.</p>

<p>With a common accord we stood for a moment listening; but not a
sound came to us, though the doors of library and drawing-room stood
open, and there were lighted lamps in both rooms.</p>

<p>"It's queer," I said, "all these lights, and no one about."</p>

<p>My companion had walked impulsively into the drawing-room and
stood looking about at its familiar furniture. From the panelled
wall, distorted by the wavering lamp-light, the old Spanish
ancestress glared down duskily at us out of the shadows. Mrs. Durant
had stopped short&mdash;a sound of voices, agitated, discordant, a strange
man's voice among them, came to us from across the hall. Silently we
retraced our steps, opened the dining-room door, and went in. But
here also we found emptiness; the talking came from beyond, came, as
we now perceived, from the wing which none of us had ever entered.
Again we hesitated and looked at each other. Then "Come!" said Mrs.
Durant in a resolute tone; and again I followed her.</p>

<p>She led the way into a large pantry, airy, orderly, well-stocked
with china and glass. That too was empty; and two doors opened from
it. Mrs. Durant passed through the one on the right, and we found
ourselves, not, as I had expected, in the kitchen, but in a kind of
vague unfurnished anteroom. The quarrelling voices had meanwhile died
out; we seemed once more to have the mysterious place to ourselves.
Suddenly, beyond another closed door, we heard a shrill crowing
laugh. Mrs. Durant dashed at this last door and it let us into a
large high-studded room. We paused and looked about us. Evidently we
were in what Cranch had always described as the lumber-room on the
ground floor of the wing. But there was no lumber in it now. It was
scrupulously neat, and fitted up like a big and rather bare nursery;
and in the middle of the floor, on a square of drugget, stood a great
rearing black and white animal: my Aunt Lucilla's hobby-horse...</p>

<p>I gasped at the sight; but in spite of its strangeness it did not
detain me long, for at the farther end of the room, before a fire
protected by a tall nursery fender, I had seen something stranger
still. Two little boys in old-fashioned round jackets and
knickerbockers knelt by the hearth, absorbed in the building of a
house of blocks. Mrs. Durant saw them at the same moment. She caught
my arm as if she were about to fall, and uttered a faint cry.</p>

<p>The sound, low as it was, produced a terrifying effect on the two
children. Both of them dropped their blocks, turned around as if to
dart at us, and then stopped short, holding each other by the hand,
and staring and trembling as if we had been ghosts.</p>

<p>At the opposite end of the room, we stood staring and trembling
also; for it was they who were the ghosts to our terrified eyes. It
must have been Mrs. Durant who spoke first.</p>

<p>"Oh...the poor things..." she said in a low choking voice.</p>

<p>The little boys stood there, motionless and far off, among the
ruins of their house of blocks. But, as my eyes grew used to the
faint light&mdash;there was only one lamp in the big room&mdash;and as my
shaken nerves adjusted themselves to the strangeness of the scene, I
perceived the meaning of Mrs. Durant's cry.</p>

<p>The children before us were not children; they were two tiny
withered men, with frowning foreheads under their baby curls, and
heavy-shouldered middle-aged bodies. The sight was horrible, and
rendered more so by the sameness of their size and by their
old-fashioned childish dress. I recoiled; but Mrs. Durant had let my
arm go, and was moving softly forward. Her own arms outstretched, she
advanced toward the two strange beings. "You poor poor things, you,"
she repeated, the tears running down her face.</p>

<p>I thought her tender tone must have drawn the little creatures;
but as she advanced they continued to stand motionless, and then
suddenly&mdash;each with the same small falsetto scream&mdash;turned and dashed
toward the door. As they reached it, old Catherine appeared and held
out her arms to them.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God&mdash;how dare you, madam? My young gentlemen!" she
cried.</p>

<p>They hid their dreadful little faces in the folds of her skirt,
and kneeling down she put her arms about them and received them on
her bosom. Then, slowly, she lifted up her head and looked at us.</p>

<p>I had always, like the rest of Harpledon, thought of Catherine as
a morose old Englishwoman, civil enough in her cold way, but yet
forbidding. Now it seemed to me that her worn brown face, in its
harsh folds of gray hair, was the saddest I had ever looked upon.</p>

<p>"How could you, madam; oh, how could you? Haven't we got enough
else to bear?" she asked, speaking low above the cowering heads on
her breast. Her eyes were on Mrs. Durant.</p>

<p>The latter, white and trembling, gave back the look. "Enough else?
Is there <i>more</i>, then?"</p>

<p>"There's everything&mdash;." The old servant got to her feet, keeping
her two charges by the hand. She put her finger to her lips, and
stooped again to the dwarfs. "Master Waldo, Master Donald, you'll
come away now with your old Catherine. No one's going to harm us, my
dears; you'll just go upstairs and let Janey Sampson put you to bed,
for it's very late; and presently Catherine'll come up and hear your
prayers like every night." She moved to the door; but one of the
dwarfs hung back, his forehead puckering, his eyes still fixed on
Mrs. Durant in indescribable horror.</p>

<p>"Good Dobbin," cried he abruptly, in a piercing pipe.</p>

<p>"No, dear, no; the lady won't touch good Dobbin," said Catherine.
"It's the young gentlemen's great pet," she added, glancing at the
Roman steed in the middle of the floor. She led the changelings away,
and a moment later returned. Her face was ashen-white under its
swarthiness, and she stood looking at us like a figure of doom.</p>

<p>"And now, perhaps," she said, "you'll be good enough to go away
too."</p>

<p>"Go away?" Mrs. Durant, instead, came closer to her. "How can
I&mdash;when I've just had this from your master?" She held out the letter
she had brought to my house.</p>

<p>Catherine glanced coldly at the page and returned it to her.</p>

<p>"He says he's going on a journey. Well, he's been, madam; been and
come back," she said.</p>

<p>"Come back? Already? He's in the house, then? Oh, do let me&mdash;"
Mrs. Durant dropped back before the old woman's frozen gaze.</p>

<p>"He's lying overhead, dead on his bed, madam&mdash;just as they carried
him up from the beach. Do you suppose, else, you'd have ever got in
here and seen the young gentlemen? He rushed out and died sooner than
have them seen, the poor lambs; him that was their father, madam. And
here you and this gentleman come thrusting yourselves in..."</p>

<p>I thought Mrs. Durant would reel under the shock; but she stood
quiet, very quiet&mdash;it was almost as if the blow had mysteriously
strengthened her.</p>

<p>"He's dead? He's killed himself?" She looked slowly about the
trivial tragic room. "Oh, now I understand," she said.</p>

<p>Old Catherine faced her with grim lips. "It's a pity you didn't
understand sooner, then; you and the others, whoever they was,
forever poking and prying; till at last that miserable girl brought
in the police on us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The police?"</p>

<p>"They was here, madam, in this house, not an hour ago, frightening
my young gentlemen out of their senses. When word came that my master
had been found on the beach they went down there to bring him back.
Now they've gone to Hingham to report his death to the coroner. But
there's one of them in the kitchen, mounting guard. Over what, I
wonder? As if my young gentlemen could run away! Where in God's pity
would they go? Wherever it is, I'll go with them; I'll never leave
them...And here we were at peace for thirty years, till you brought
that man to draw the pictures of the house..."</p>

<p>For the first time Mrs. Durant's strength seemed to fail her; her
body drooped, and she leaned her weight against the door. She and the
housekeeper stood confronted, two stricken old women staring at each
other; then Mrs. Durant's agony broke from her. "Don't say I did
it&mdash;don't say that!"</p>

<p>But the other was relentless. As she faced us, her arms
outstretched, she seemed still to be defending her two charges. "What
else would you have me say, madam? You brought that man here, didn't
you? And he was determined to see the other side of the wing, and my
poor master was determined he shouldn't." She turned to me for the
first time. "It was plain enough to you, sir, wasn't it? To me it
was, just coming and going with the tea-things. And the minute your
backs was turned, Mr. Cranch rang, and gave me the order: 'That man's
never to set foot here again, you understand.' And I went out and
told the other three; the cook, and Janey, and Hannah Oast, the
parlour-maid. I was as sure of the cook and Janey as I was of myself;
but Hannah was new, she hadn't been with us not above a year, and
though I knew all about her, and had made sure before she came that
she was a decent close-mouthed girl, and one that would respect
our...our misfortune...yet I couldn't feel as safe about her as the
others, and of her temper I wasn't sure from the first. I told Mr.
Cranch so, often enough; I said: 'Remember, now, sir, not to put her
pride up, won't you?' For she was jealous, and angry, I think, at
never being allowed to see the young gentlemen, yet knowing they were
there, as she had to know. But their father would never have any but
me and Janey Sampson about them.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and then, in he came yesterday with those accursed
pictures. And however had the man got in? And where was Hannah? And
it must have been her doing...and swearing and cursing at her...and
me crying to him and saying: 'For God's sake, sir, let be, let
be...don't stir the matter up...just let me talk to her...And I went
in to my little boys, to see about their supper; and before I was
back, I heard a trunk bumping down the stairs, and the gardener's lad
outside with a wheel-barrow, and Hannah Oast walking away out of the
gate like a ramrod. 'Oh, sir, what have you done? Let me go after
her!' I begged and besought him; but my master, very pale, but as
calm as possible, held me back by the arm, and said: 'Don't you
worry, Catherine. It passed off very quietly. We'll have no trouble
from her.' 'No trouble, sir, from Hannah Oast? Oh, for pity's sake,
call her back and let me smooth it over, sir!' But the girl was gone,
and he wouldn't leave go of my arm nor yet listen to me, but stood
there like a marble stone and saw her drive away, and wouldn't stop
her. 'I'd die first, Catherine,' he said, his kind face all changed
to me, and looking like that old Spanish she-devil on the parlour
wall, that brought the curse on us...And this morning the police
came. The gardener got wind of it, and let us know they was on the
way; and my master sat and wrote a long time in his room, and then
walked out, looking very quiet, and saying to me he was going to the
post office, and would be back before they got here. And the next we
knew of him was when they carried him up to his bed just now...And
perhaps we'd best give thanks that he's at rest in it. But, oh, my
young gentlemen...my young gentlemen!"</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>I never saw the "young gentlemen" again. I suppose most men are
cowards about calamities of that sort, the irremediable kind that
have to be faced anew every morning. It takes a woman to shoulder
such a lasting tragedy, and hug it to her...as I had seen Catherine
doing; as I saw Mrs. Durant yearning to do...</p>

<p>It was about that very matter that I interviewed the old
housekeeper the day after the funeral. Among the papers which the
police found on poor Cranch's desk was a letter addressed to me. Like
his message to Mrs. Durant it was of the briefest. "I have appointed
no one to care for my sons; I expected to outlive them. Their mother
would have wished Catherine to stay with them. Will you try to settle
all this mercifully? There is plenty of money, but my brain won't
work. Good-bye."</p>

<p>It was a matter, first of all, for the law; but before we entered
on that phase I wanted to have a talk with old Catherine. She came to
me, very decent in her new black; I hadn't the heart to go to that
dreadful house again, and I think perhaps it was easier for her to
speak out under another roof. At any rate, I soon saw that, after all
the years of silence, speech was a relief; as it might have been to
him too, poor fellow, if only he had dared! But he couldn't; there
was that pride of his, his "Spanish pride" as she called it.</p>

<p>"Not but what he would have hated me to say so, sir; for the
Spanish blood in him, and all that went with it, was what he most
abominated...But there it was, closer to him than his marrow...Oh,
what that old woman done to us! He told me why, once, long ago&mdash;it
was about the time when he began to understand that our little boys
were never going to grow up like other young gentlemen. 'It's her
doing, the devil,' he said to me; and then he told me how she'd been
a great Spanish heiress, a rich merchant's daughter, and had been
promised, in that foreign way they have, to a young nobleman who'd
never set eyes on her; and when the bridegroom came to the city where
she lived, and saw her sitting in her father's box across the
theatre, he turned about and mounted his horse and rode off the same
night; and never a word came from him&mdash;the shame of it! It nigh
killed her, I believe, and she swore then and there she'd marry a
foreigner and leave Spain; and that was how she took up with young
Mr. Cranch that was in her father's bank; and the old gentleman put a
big sum into the Cranch shipping business, and packed off the young
couple to Harpledon...But the poor misbuilt thing, it seems, couldn't
ever rightly get over the hurt to her pride, nor get used to the cold
climate, and the snow and the strange faces; she would go about
pining for the orange-flowers and the sunshine; and though she
brought her husband a son, I do believe she hated him, and was glad
to die and get out of Harpledon...That was my Mr. Cranch's
story...</p>

<p>"Well, sir, he despised his great-grandfather more than he hated
the Spanish woman. 'Marry that twisted stick for her money, and put
her poisoned blood in us I' He used to put it that way, sir, in his
bad moments. And when he was twenty-one, and travelling abroad, he
met the young English lady I was maid to, the loveliest soundest
young creature you ever set eyes on. They loved and married, and the
next year&mdash;oh, the pity&mdash;the next year she brought him our young
gentlemen...twins, they were...When she died, a few weeks after, he
was desperate...more desperate than I've ever seen him till the other
day. But as the years passed, and he began to understand about our
little boys&mdash;well, then he was thankful she was gone. And that
thankfulness was the bitterest part of his grief.</p>

<p>"It was when they was about nine or ten that <i>he</i> first saw
it; though I'd been certain long before that. We were living in Italy
then. And one day&mdash;oh, what a day, sir!&mdash;he got a letter, Mr. Cranch
did, from a circus-man who'd heard somehow of our poor little
children...Oh, sir!...Then it was that he decided to leave Europe,
and come back to Harpledon to live. It was a lonely lost place at
that time; and there was all the big wing for our little gentlemen.
We were happy in the old house, in our way; but it was a solitary
life for so young a man as Mr. Cranch was then, and when the summer
folk began to settle here I was glad of it, and I said to him: 'You
go out, sir, now, and make friends, and invite your friends here.
I'll see to it that our secret is kept.' And so I did, sir, so I
did...and he always trusted me. He needed life and company himself;
but he would never separate himself from the little boys. He was so
proud&mdash;and yet so soft-hearted! And where could he have put the
little things? They never grew past their toys&mdash;there's the worst of
it. Heaps and heaps of them he brought home to them, year after year.
Pets he tried too...but animals were afraid of them&mdash;just as I expect
you were, sir, when you saw them," she added suddenly, "but with no
reason; there were never gentler beings. Little Waldo
especially&mdash;it's as if they were trying to make up for being a
burden...Oh, for pity's sake, let them stay on in their father's
house, and me with them, won't you, sir?"</p>

<p>As she wished it, so it was. The legal side of the matter did not
take long to settle, for the Cranches were almost extinct; there were
only some distant cousins, long since gone from Harpledon. Old
Catherine was suffered to remain on with her charges in the Cranch
house, and one of the guardians appointed by the courts was Mrs.
Durant.</p>

<p>Would you have believed it? She wanted it&mdash;the horror, the
responsibility and all. After that she lived all the year round at
Harpledon; I believe she saw Cranch's sons every day. I never went
back there; but she used sometimes to come up and see me in Boston.
The first time she appeared&mdash;it must have been about a year after the
events I have related&mdash;I scarcely knew her when she walked into my
library. She was an old bent woman; her white hair now seemed an
attribute of age, not a form of coquetry. After that, each time I saw
her she seemed older and more bowed. But she told me once she was not
unhappy&mdash;"not as unhappy as I used to be," she added, qualifying the
phrase.</p>

<p>On the same occasion&mdash;it was only a few months ago&mdash;she also told
me that one of the twins was ill. She did not think he would last
long, she said; and old Catherine did not think so either. "It's
little Waldo; he was the one who felt his father's death the most;
the dark one; I really think he understands. And when he goes, Donald
won't last long either." Her eyes filled with tears. "Presently I
shall be alone again," she added.</p>

<p>I asked her then how old they were; and she thought for a moment,
murmuring the years over slowly under her breath. "Only forty-one,"
she said at length&mdash;as if she had said "Only four."</p>

<p>Women are strange. I am their other guardian; and I have never yet
had the courage to go down to Harpledon and see them.</p>

<h2><a name="s3"></a>BEWITCHED</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The snow was still falling thickly when Orrin Bosworth, who farmed
the land south of Lonetop, drove up in his cutter to Saul Rutledge's
gate. He was surprised to see two other cutters ahead of him. From
them descended two muffled figures. Bosworth, with increasing
surprise, recognized Deacon Hibben, from North Ashmore, and Sylvester
Brand, the widower, from the old Bearcliff farm on the way to
Lonetop.</p>

<p>It was not often that anybody in Hemlock County entered Saul
Rutledge's gate; least of all in the dead of winter, and summoned (as
Bosworth, at any rate, had been) by Mrs. Rutledge, who passed, even
in that unsocial region, for a woman of cold manners and solitary
character. The situation was enough to excite the curiosity of a less
imaginative man than Orrin Bosworth.</p>

<p>As he drove in between the broken-down white gate-posts topped by
fluted urns the two men ahead of him were leading their horses to the
adjoining shed. Bosworth followed, and hitched his horse to a post.
Then the three tossed off the snow from their shoulders, clapped
their numb hands together, and greeted each other.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Deacon."</p>

<p>"Well, well, Orrin&mdash;." They shook hands.</p>

<p>"'Day, Bosworth," said Sylvester Brand, with a brief nod. He
seldom put any cordiality into his manner, and on this occasion he
was still busy about his horse's bridle and blanket.</p>

<p>Orrin Bosworth, the youngest and most communicative of the three,
turned back to Deacon Hibben, whose long face, queerly blotched and
mouldy-looking, with blinking peering eyes, was yet less forbidding
than Brand's heavily-hewn countenance.</p>

<p>"Queer, our all meeting here this way. Mrs. Rutledge sent me a
message to come," Bosworth volunteered.</p>

<p>The Deacon nodded. "I got a word from her too&mdash;Andy Pond come with
it yesterday noon. I hope there's no trouble here&mdash;"</p>

<p>He glanced through the thickening fall of snow at the desolate
front of the Rutledge house, the more melancholy in its present
neglected state because, like the gate-posts, it kept traces of
former elegance. Bosworth had often wondered how such a house had
come to be built in that lonely stretch between North Ashmore and
Cold Corners. People said there had once been other houses like it,
forming a little township called Ashmore, a sort of mountain colony
created by the caprice of an English Royalist officer, one Colonel
Ashmore, who had been murdered by the Indians, with all his family,
long before the Revolution. This tale was confirmed by the fact that
the ruined cellars of several smaller houses were still to be
discovered under the wild growth of the adjoining slopes, and that
the Communion plate of the moribund Episcopal church of Cold Corners
was engraved with the name of Colonel Ashmore, who had given it to
the church of Ashmore in the year 1723. Of the church itself no
traces remained. Doubtless it had been a modest wooden edifice, built
on piles, and the conflagration which had burnt the other houses to
the ground's edge had reduced it utterly to ashes. The whole place,
even in summer, wore a mournful solitary air, and people wondered why
Saul Rutledge's father had gone there to settle.</p>

<p>"I never knew a place," Deacon Hibben said, "as seemed as far away
from humanity. And yet it ain't so in miles."</p>

<p>"Miles ain't the only distance," Orrin Bosworth answered; and the
two men, followed by Sylvester Brand, walked across the drive to the
front door. People in Hemlock County did not usually come and go by
their front doors, but all three men seemed to feel that, on an
occasion which appeared to be so exceptional, the usual and more
familiar approach by the kitchen would not be suitable.</p>

<p>They had judged rightly; the Deacon had hardly lifted the knocker
when the door opened and Mrs. Rutledge stood before them.</p>

<p>"Walk right in," she said in her usual dead-level tone; and
Bosworth, as he followed the others, thought to himself; "Whatever's
happened, she's not going to let it show in her face."</p>

<p>It was doubtful, indeed, if anything unwonted could be made to
show in Prudence Rutledge's face, so limited was its scope, so fixed
were its features. She was dressed for the occasion in a black calico
with white spots, a collar of crochet-lace fastened by a gold brooch,
and a gray woollen shawl crossed under her arms and tied at the back.
In her small narrow head the only marked prominence was that of the
brow projecting roundly over pale spectacled eyes. Her dark hair,
parted above this prominence, passed tight and fiat over the tips of
her ears into a small braided coil at the nape; and her contracted
head looked still narrower from being perched on a long hollow neck
with cord-like throat-muscles. Her eyes were of a pale cold gray, her
complexion was an even white. Her age might have been anywhere from
thirty-five to sixty.</p>

<p>The room into which she led the three men had probably been the
dining-room of the Ashmore house. It was now used as a front parlour,
and a black stove planted on a sheet of zinc stuck out from the
delicately fluted panels of an old wooden mantel. A newly-lit fire
smouldered reluctantly, and the room was at once close and bitterly
cold.</p>

<p>"Andy Pond," Mrs. Rutledge cried to some one at the back of the
house, "step out and call Mr. Rutledge. You'll likely find him in the
wood-shed, or round the barn somewheres." She rejoined her visitors.
"Please suit yourselves to seats," she said.</p>

<p>The three men, with an increasing air of constraint, took the
chairs she pointed out, and Mrs. Rutledge sat stiffly down upon a
fourth, behind a rickety bead-work table. She glanced from one to the
other of her visitors.</p>

<p>"I presume you folks are wondering what it is I asked you to come
here for," she said in her dead-level voice. Orrin Bosworth and
Deacon Hibben murmured an assent; Sylvester Brand sat silent, his
eyes, under their great thicket of eyebrows, fixed on the huge
boot-tip swinging before him.</p>

<p>"Well, I allow you didn't expect it was for a party," continued
Mrs. Rutledge.</p>

<p>No one ventured to respond to this chill pleasantry, and she
continued: "We're in trouble here, and that's the fact. And we need
advice&mdash;Mr. Rutledge and myself do." She cleared her throat, and
added in a lower tone, her pitilessly clear eyes looking straight
before her: "There's a spell been cast over Mr. Rutledge."</p>

<p>The Deacon looked up sharply, an incredulous smile pinching his
thin lips. "A spell?"</p>

<p>"That's what I said: he's bewitched."</p>

<p>Again the three visitors were silent; then Bosworth, more at ease
or less tongue-tied than the others, asked with an attempt at humour:
"Do you use the word in the strict Scripture sense, Mrs.
Rutledge?"</p>

<p>She glanced at him before replying: "That's how <i>he</i> uses
it."</p>

<p>The Deacon coughed and cleared his long rattling throat. "Do you
care to give us more particulars before your husband joins us?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Rutledge looked down at her clasped hands, as if considering
the question. Bosworth noticed that the inner fold of her lids was of
the same uniform white as the rest of her skin, so that when she
dropped them her rather prominent eyes looked like the sightless orbs
of a marble statue. The impression was unpleasing, and he glanced
away at the text over the mantelpiece, which read:</p>

<p><i>The Soul That Sinneth It Shall Die.</i></p>

<p>"No," she said at length, "I'll wait."</p>

<p>At this moment Sylvester Brand suddenly stood up and pushed back
his chair. "I don't know," he said, in his rough bass voice, "as I've
got any particular lights on Bible mysteries; and this happens to be
the day I was to go down to Starkfield to close a deal with a
man."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rutledge lifted one of her long thin hands. Withered and
wrinkled by hard work and cold, it was nevertheless of the same
leaden white as her face. "You won't be kept long," she said. "Won't
you be seated?"</p>

<p>Farmer Brand stood irresolute, his purplish underlip twitching.
"The Deacon here&mdash;-such things is more in his line..."</p>

<p>"I want you should stay," said Mrs. Rutledge quietly; and Brand
sat down again.</p>

<p>A silence fell, during which the four persons present seemed all
to be listening for the sound of a step; but none was heard, and
after a minute or two Mrs. Rutledge began to speak again.</p>

<p>"It's down by that old shack on Lamer's pond; that's where they
meet," she said suddenly.</p>

<p>Bosworth, whose eyes were on Sylvester Brand's face, fancied he
saw a sort of inner flush darken the farmer's heavy leathern skin.
Deacon Hibben leaned forward, a glitter of curiosity in his eyes.</p>

<p>"They&mdash;<i>who</i>, Mrs. Rutledge?"</p>

<p>"My husband, Saul Rutledge...and her..."</p>

<p>Sylvester Brand again stirred in his seat. "Who do you mean by
<i>her?</i>" he asked abruptly, as if roused out of some far-off
musing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rutledge's body did not move; she simply revolved her head on
her long neck and looked at him.</p>

<p>"Your daughter, Sylvester Brand."</p>

<p>The man staggered to his feet with an explosion of inarticulate
sounds. "My&mdash;my daughter? What the hell are you talking about? My
daughter? It's a damned lie...it's...it's..."</p>

<p>"Your daughter <i>Ora</i>, Mr. Brand," said Mrs. Rutledge
slowly.</p>

<p>Bosworth felt an icy chill down his spine. Instinctively he turned
his eyes away from Brand, and, they rested on the mildewed
countenance of Deacon Hibben. Between the blotches it had become as
white as Mrs. Rutledge's, and the Deacon's eyes burned in the
whiteness like live embers among ashes.</p>

<p>Brand gave a laugh: the rusty creaking laugh of one whose springs
of mirth are never moved by gaiety. "My daughter <i>Ora?</i>" he
repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"My <i>dead</i> daughter?"</p>

<p>"That's what he says."</p>

<p>"Your husband?"</p>

<p>"That's what Mr. Rutledge says."</p>

<p>Orrin Bosworth listened with a sense of suffocation; he felt as if
he were wrestling with long-armed horrors in a dream. He could no
longer resist letting his eyes return to Sylvester Brand's face. To
his surprise it had resumed a natural imperturbable expression. Brand
rose to his feet. "Is that all?" he queried contemptuously.</p>

<p>"All? Ain't it enough? How long is it since you folks seen Saul
Rutledge, any of you?" Mrs. Rutledge flew out at them.</p>

<p>Bosworth, it appeared, had not seen him for nearly a year; the
Deacon had only run across him once, for a minute, at the North
Ashmore post office, the previous autumn, and acknowledged that he
wasn't looking any too good then. Brand said nothing, but stood
irresolute.</p>

<p>"Well, if you wait a minute you'll see with your own eyes; and
he'll tell you with his own words. That's what I've got you here
for&mdash;to see for yourselves what's come over him. Then you'll talk
different," she added, twisting her head abruptly toward Sylvester
Brand.</p>

<p>The Deacon raised a lean hand of interrogation.</p>

<p>"Does your husband know we've been sent for on this business, Mrs.
Rutledge?" Mrs. Rutledge signed assent.</p>

<p>"It was with his consent, then&mdash;?"</p>

<p>She looked coldly at her questioner. "I guess it had to be," she
said. Again Bosworth felt the chill down his spine. He tried to
dissipate the sensation by speaking with an affectation of
energy.</p>

<p>"Can you tell us, Mrs. Rutledge, how this trouble you speak of
shows itself...what makes you think...?"</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment; then she leaned forward across the
rickety bead-work table. A thin smile of disdain narrowed her
colourless lips. "I don't think&mdash;I know."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;but how?"</p>

<p>She leaned closer, both elbows on the table, her voice dropping.
"I seen 'em."</p>

<p>In the ashen light from the veiling of snow beyond the windows the
Deacon's little screwed-up eyes seemed to give out red sparks. "Him
and the dead?"</p>

<p>"Him and the dead."</p>

<p>"Saul Rutledge and&mdash;and Ora Brand?"</p>

<p>"That's so."</p>

<p>Sylvester Brand's chair fell backward with a crash. He was on his
feet again, crimson and cursing. "It's a God-damned fiend-begotten
lie..."</p>

<p>"Friend Brand...friend Brand..." the Deacon protested.</p>

<p>"Here, let me get out of this. I want to see Saul Rutledge
himself, and tell him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, here he is," said Mrs. Rutledge.</p>

<p>The outer door had opened; they heard the familiar stamping and
shaking of a man who rids his garments of their last snowflakes
before penetrating to the sacred precincts of the best parlour. Then
Saul Rutledge entered.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>As he came in he faced the light from the north window, and
Bosworth's first thought was that he looked like a drowned man fished
out from under the ice&mdash;"self-drowned," he added. But the snow-light
plays cruel tricks with a man's colour, and even with the shape of
his features; it must have been partly that, Bosworth reflected,
which transformed Saul Rutledge from the straight muscular fellow he
had been a year before into the haggard wretch now before them.</p>

<p>The Deacon sought for a word to ease the horror. "Well, now,
Saul&mdash;you look's if you'd ought to set right up to the stove. Had a
touch of ague, maybe?"</p>

<p>The feeble attempt was unavailing. Rutledge neither moved nor
answered. He stood among them silent, incommunicable, like one risen
from the dead.</p>

<p>Brand grasped him roughly by the shoulder. "See here, Saul
Rutledge, what's this dirty lie your wife tells us you've been
putting about?"</p>

<p>Still Rutledge did not move. "It's no lie," he said.</p>

<p>Brand's hand dropped from his shoulder. In spite of the man's
rough bullying power he seemed to be undefinably awed by Rutledge's
look and tone.</p>

<p>"No lie? You've gone plumb crazy, then, have you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Rutledge spoke. "My husband's not lying, nor he ain't gone
crazy. Don't I tell you I seen 'em?"</p>

<p>Brand laughed again. "Him and the dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Down by the Lamer pond, you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And when was that, if I might ask?"</p>

<p>"Day before yesterday."</p>

<p>A silence fell on the strangely assembled group. The Deacon at
length broke it to say to Mr. Brand: "Brand, in my opinion we've got
to see this thing through."</p>

<p>Brand stood for a moment in speechless contemplation: there was
something animal and primitive about him, Bosworth thought, as he
hung thus, lowering and dumb, a little foam beading the corners of
that heavy purplish underlip. He let himself slowly down into his
chair. "I'll see it through."</p>

<p>The two other men and Mrs. Rutledge had remained seated. Saul
Rutledge stood before them, like a prisoner at the bar, or rather
like a sick man before the physicians who were to heal him. As
Bosworth scrutinized that hollow face, so wan under the dark sunburn,
so sucked inward and consumed by some hidden fever, there stole over
the sound healthy man the thought that perhaps, after all, husband
and wife spoke the truth, and that they were all at that moment
really standing on the edge of some forbidden mystery. Things that
the rational mind would reject without a thought seemed no longer so
easy to dispose of as one looked at the actual Saul Rutledge and
remembered the man he had been a year before. Yes; as the Deacon
said, they would have to see it through...</p>

<p>"Sit down then, Saul; draw up to us, won't you?" the Deacon
suggested, trying again for a natural tone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rutledge pushed a chair forward, and her husband sat down on
it. He stretched out his arms and grasped his knees in his brown bony
fingers; in that attitude he remained, turning neither his head nor
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, Saul," the Deacon continued, "your wife says you thought
mebbe we could do something to help you through this trouble,
whatever it is."</p>

<p>Rutledge's gray eyes widened a little. "No; I didn't think that.
It was her idea to try what could be done."</p>

<p>"I presume, though, since you've agreed to our coming, that you
don't object to our putting a few questions?"</p>

<p>Rutledge was silent for a moment; then he said with a visible
effort: "No; I don't object."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you've heard what your wife says?"</p>

<p>Rutledge made a slight motion of assent. "And&mdash;what have you got
to answer? How do you explain...?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Rutledge intervened. "How can he explain? I seen 'em."</p>

<p>There was a silence; then Bosworth, trying to speak in an easy
reassuring tone, queried: "That so, Saul?"</p>

<p>"That's so."</p>

<p>Brand lifted up his brooding head. "You mean to say you...you sit
here before us all and say..."</p>

<p>The Deacon's hand again checked him. "Hold on, friend Brand. We're
all of us trying for the facts, ain't we?" He turned to Rutledge.
"We've heard what Mrs. Rutledge says. What's your answer?"</p>

<p>"I don't know as there's any answer. She found us."</p>

<p>"And you mean to tell me the person with you was...was what you
took to be..." the Deacon's thin voice grew thinner: "Ora Brand?"</p>

<p>Saul Rutledge nodded.</p>

<p>"You knew...or thought you knew...you were meeting with the
dead?"</p>

<p>Rutledge bent his head again. The snow continued to fall in a
steady unwavering sheet against the window, and Bosworth felt as if a
winding-sheet were descending from the sky to envelop them all in a
common grave.</p>

<p>"Think what you're saying! It's against our religion! Ora...poor
child!...died over a year ago. I saw you at her funeral, Saul. How
can you make such a statement?"</p>

<p>"What else can he do?" thrust in Mrs. Rutledge.</p>

<p>There was another pause. Bosworth's resources had failed him, and
Brand once more sat plunged in dark meditation. The Deacon laid his
quivering finger-tips together, and moistened his lips.</p>

<p>"Was the day before yesterday the first time?" he asked.</p>

<p>The movement of Rutledge's head was negative.</p>

<p>"Not the first? Then when..."</p>

<p>"Nigh on a year ago, I reckon."</p>

<p>"God! And you mean to tell us that ever since&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Well...look at him," said his wife. The three men lowered their
eyes.</p>

<p>After a moment Bosworth, trying to collect himself, glanced at the
Deacon. "Why not ask Saul to make his own statement, if that's what
we're here for?"</p>

<p>"That's so," the Deacon assented. He turned to Rutledge. "Will you
try and give us your idea...of...of how it began?"</p>

<p>There was another silence. Then Rutledge tightened his grasp on
his gaunt knees, and still looking straight ahead, with his curiously
clear unseeing gaze: "Well," he said, "I guess it begun away back,
afore even I was married to Mrs. Rutledge..." He spoke in a low
automatic tone, as if some invisible agent were dictating his words,
or even uttering them for him. "You know," he added, "Ora and me was
to have been married."</p>

<p>Sylvester Brand lifted his, head. "Straighten that statement out
first, please," he interjected.</p>

<p>"What I mean is, we kept company. But Ora she was very young. Mr.
Brand here he sent her away. She was gone nigh to three years, I
guess. When she come back I was married."</p>

<p>"That's right," Brand said, relapsing once more into his sunken
attitude.</p>

<p>"And after she came back did you meet her again?" the Deacon
continued.</p>

<p>"Alive?" Rutledge questioned.</p>

<p>A perceptible shudder ran through the room.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;of course," said the Deacon nervously.</p>

<p>Rutledge seemed to consider. "Once I did&mdash;only once. There was a
lot of other people round. At Cold Corners fair it was." "Did you
talk with her then?"</p>

<p>"Only a minute."</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>His voice dropped. "She said she was sick and knew she was going
to die, and when she was dead she'd come back to me."</p>

<p>"And what did you answer?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Did you think anything of it at the time?"</p>

<p>"Well, no. Not till I heard she was dead I didn't. After that I
thought of it&mdash;and I guess she drew me." He moistened his lips.</p>

<p>"Drew you down to that abandoned house by the pond?"</p>

<p>Rutledge made a faint motion of assent, and the Deacon added: "How
did you know it was there she wanted you to come?"</p>

<p>"She...just drew me..."</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Bosworth felt, on himself and the other
two men, the oppressive weight of the next question to be asked. Mrs.
Rutledge opened and closed her narrow lips once or twice, like some
beached shell-fish gasping for the tide. Rutledge waited.</p>

<p>"Well, now, Saul, won't you go on with what you was telling us?"
the Deacon at length suggested.</p>

<p>"That's all. There's nothing else."</p>

<p>The Deacon lowered his voice. "She just draws you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Often?"</p>

<p>"That's as it happens..."</p>

<p>"But if it's always there she draws you, man, haven't you the
strength to keep away from the place?"</p>

<p>For the first time, Rutledge wearily turned his head toward his
questioner. A spectral smile narrowed his colourless lips. "Ain't any
use. She follers after me..."</p>

<p>There was another silence. What more could they ask, then and
there? Mrs. Rutledge's presence checked the next question. The
Deacon seemed hopelessly to revolve the matter. At length he spoke in
a more authoritative tone. "These are forbidden things. You know
that, Saul. Have you tried prayer?"</p>

<p>Rutledge shook his head.</p>

<p>"Will you pray with us now?"</p>

<p>Rutledge cast a glance of freezing indifference on his spiritual
adviser. "If you folks want to pray, I'm agreeable," he said. But
Mrs. Rutledge intervened.</p>

<p>"Prayer ain't any good. In this kind of thing it ain't no manner
of use; you know it ain't. I called you here, Deacon, because you
remember the last case in this parish. Thirty years ago it was, I
guess; but you remember. Lefferts Nash&mdash;did praying help him? I was a
little girl then, but I used to hear my folks talk of it winter
nights. Lefferts Nash and Hannah Cory. They drove a stake through her
breast. That's what cured him."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;" Orrin Bosworth exclaimed.</p>

<p>Sylvester Brand raised his head. "You're speaking of that old
story as if this was the same sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"Ain't it? Ain't my husband pining away the same as Lefferts Nash
did? The Deacon here knows&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Deacon stirred anxiously in his chair. "These are forbidden
things," he repeated. "Supposing your husband is quite sincere in
thinking himself haunted, as you might say. Well, even then, what
proof have we that the...the dead woman...is the spectre of that poor
girl?"</p>

<p>"Proof? Don't he say so? Didn't she tell him? Ain't I seen 'em?"
Mrs. Rutledge almost screamed.</p>

<p>The three men sat silent, and suddenly the wife burst out: "A
stake through the breast That's the old way; and it's the only way.
The Deacon knows it!"</p>

<p>"It's against our religion to disturb the dead."</p>

<p>"Ain't it against your religion to let the living perish as my
husband is perishing?" She sprang up with one of her abrupt movements
and took the family Bible from the what-not in a corner of die
parlour. Putting the book on the table, and moistening a livid
finger-tip, she turned the pages rapidly, till she came to one on
which she laid her hand like a stony paper-weight. "See here," she
said, and read out in her level chanting voice:</p>

<p>"'<i>Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.</i>'</p>

<p>"That's in Exodus, that's where it is," she added, leaving the
book open as if to confirm the statement.</p>

<p>Bosworth continued to glance anxiously from one to the other of
the four people about the table. He was younger than any of them, and
had had more contact with the modern world; down in Starkfield, in
the bar of the Fielding House, he could hear himself laughing with
the rest of the men at such old wives' tales. But it was not for
nothing that he had been born under the icy shadow of Lonetop, and
had shivered and hungered as a lad through the bitter Hemlock County
winters. After his parents died, and he had taken hold of the farm
himself, he had got more out of it by using improved methods, and by
supplying the increasing throng of summer-boarders over Stotesbury
way with milk and vegetables. He had been made a selectman of North
Ashmore; for so young a man he had a standing in the county. But the
roots of the old life were still in him. He could remember, as a
little boy, going twice a year with his mother to that bleak
hill-farm out beyond Sylvester Brand's, where Mrs. Bosworth's aunt,
Cressidora Cheney, had been shut up for years in a cold clean room
with iron bars in the windows. When little Orrin first saw Aunt
Cressidora she was a small white old woman, whom her sisters used to
"make decent" for visitors the day that Orrin and his mother were
expected. The child wondered why there were bars to the window. "Like
a canary-bird," he said to his mother. The phrase made Mrs. Bosworth
reflect. "I do believe they keep Aunt Cressidora too lonesome," she
said; and the next time she went up the mountain with the little boy
he carried to his great-aunt a canary in a little wooden cage. It was
a great excitement; he knew it would make her happy.</p>

<p>The old woman's motionless face lit up when she saw the bird, and
her eyes began to glitter. "It belongs to me," she said instantly,
stretching her soft bony hand over the cage.</p>

<p>"Of course it does, Aunt Cressy," said Mrs. Bosworth, her eyes
filling.</p>

<p>But the bird, startled by the shadow of the old woman's hand,
began to flutter and beat its wings distractedly. At the sight, Aunt
Cressidora's calm face suddenly became a coil of twitching features.
"You she-devil, you!" she cried in a high squealing voice; and
thrusting her hand into the cage she dragged out the terrified bird
and wrung its neck. She was plucking the hot body, and squealing
"she-devil, she-devil!" as they drew little Orrin from the room. On
the way down the mountain his mother wept a great deal, and said:
"You must never tell anybody that poor Auntie's crazy, or the men
would come and take her down to the asylum at Starkfield, and the
shame of it would kill us all. Now promise." The child promised.</p>

<p>He remembered the scene now, with its deep fringe of mystery,
secrecy and rumour. It seemed related to a great many other things
below the surface of his thoughts, things which stole up anew, making
him feel that all the old people he had known, and who "believed in
these things," might after all be right. Hadn't a witch been burned
at North Ashmore? Didn't the summer folk still drive over in jolly
buckboard loads to see the meeting-house where the trial had been
held, the pond where they had ducked her and she had
floated?...Deacon Hibben believed; Bosworth was sure of it. If he
didn't, why did people from all over the place come to him when their
animals had queer sicknesses, or when there was a child in the family
that had to be kept shut up because it fell down flat and foamed?
Yes, in spite of his religion, Deacon Hibben <i>knew</i>...</p>

<p>And Brand? Well, it came to Bosworth in a flash: that North
Ashmore woman who was burned had the name of Brand. The same stock,
no doubt; there had been Brands in Hemlock County ever since the
white men had come there. And Orrin, when he was a child, remembered
hearing his parents say that Sylvester Brand hadn't ever oughter
married his own cousin, because of the blood. Yet the couple had had
two healthy girls, and when Mrs. Brand pined away and died nobody
suggested that anything had been wrong with her mind. And Vanessa and
Ora were the handsomest girls anywhere round. Brand knew it, and
scrimped and saved all he could to send Ora, the eldest, down to
Starkfield to learn book-keeping. "When she's married I'll send you,"
he used to say to little Venny, who was his favourite. But Ora never
married. She was away three years, during which Venny ran wild on the
slopes of Lonetop; and when Ora came back she sickened and died&mdash;poor
girl! Since then Brand had grown more savage and morose. He was a
hard-working farmer, but there wasn't much to be got out of those
barren Bearcliff acres. He was said to have taken to drink since his
wife's death; now and then men ran across him in the "dives" of
Stotesbury. But not often. And between times he laboured hard on his
stony acres and did his best for his daughters. In the neglected
grave-yard of Cold Corners there was a slanting head-stone marked
with his wife's name; near it, a year since, he had laid his eldest
daughter. And sometimes, at dusk, in the autumn, the village people
saw him walk slowly by, turn in between the graves, and stand looking
down on the two stones. But he never brought a flower there, or
planted a bush; nor Venny either. She was too wild and
ignorant...</p>

<p>Mrs. Rutledge repeated: "That's in Exodus."</p>

<p>The three visitors remained silent, turning about their hats in
reluctant hands. Rutledge faced them, still with that empty pellucid
gaze which frightened Bosworth. What was he seeing?</p>

<p>"Ain't any of you folks got the grit&mdash;?" his wife burst out again,
half hysterically.</p>

<p>Deacon Hibben held up his hand. "That's no way, Mrs. Rutledge.
This ain't a question of having grit. What we want first of all
is...proof..."</p>

<p>"That's so," said Bosworth, with an explosion of relief, as if the
words had lifted something black and crouching from his breast.
Involuntarily the eyes of both men had turned to Brand. He stood
there smiling grimly, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"Ain't it so, Brand?" the Deacon prompted him.</p>

<p>"Proof that spooks walk?" the other sneered.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I presume you want this business settled too?"</p>

<p>The old farmer squared his shoulders. "Yes&mdash;I do. But I ain't a
sperritualist. How the hell are you going to settle it?"</p>

<p>Deacon Hibben hesitated; then he said, in a low incisive tone: "I
don't see but one way&mdash;Mrs. Rutledge's."</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>"What?" Brand sneered again. "Spying?"</p>

<p>The Deacon's voice sank lower. "If the poor girl <i>does</i>
walk...her that's your child...wouldn't you be the first to want her
laid quiet? We all know there've been such cases...mysterious
visitations...Can any one of us here deny it?"</p>

<p>"I seen 'em," Mrs. Rutledge interjected.</p>

<p>There was another heavy pause. Suddenly Brand fixed his gaze on
Rutledge. "See here, Saul Rutledge, you've got to clear up this
damned calumny, or I'll know why. You say my dead girl comes to you."
He laboured with his breath, and then jerked out: "When? You tell me
that, and I'll be there."</p>

<p>Rutledge's head drooped a little, and his eyes wandered to the
window. "Round about sunset, mostly."</p>

<p>"You know beforehand?"</p>

<p>Rutledge made a sign of assent.</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;tomorrow, will it be?" Rutledge made the same
sign.</p>

<p>Brand turned to the door. "I'll be there." That was all he said.
He strode out between them without another glance or word. Deacon
Hibben looked at Mrs. Rutledge. "We'll be there too," he said, as if
she had asked him; but she had not spoken, and Bosworth saw that her
thin body was trembling all over. He was glad when he and Hibben were
out again in the snow.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>They thought that Brand wanted to be left to himself, and to give
him time to unhitch his horse they made a pretense of hanging about
in the doorway while Bosworth searched his pockets for a pipe he had
no mind to light.</p>

<p>But Brand turned back to them as they lingered. "You'll meet me
down by Lamer's pond tomorrow?" he suggested. "I want witnesses.
Round about sunset."</p>

<p>They nodded their acquiescence, and he got into his sleigh, gave
the horse a cut across the flanks, and drove off under the
snow-smothered hemlocks. The other two men went to the shed.</p>

<p>"What do you make of this business, Deacon?" Bosworth asked, to
break the silence.</p>

<p>The Deacon shook his head. "The man's a sick man&mdash;that's sure.
Something's sucking the life clean out of him."</p>

<p>But already, in the biting outer air, Bosworth was getting himself
under better control. "Looks to me like a bad case of the ague, as
you said."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;ague of the mind, then. It's his brain that's sick."</p>

<p>Bosworth shrugged. "He ain't the first in Hemlock County."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>"That's so," the Deacon agreed. "It's a worm in the brain,
solitude is."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll know this time tomorrow, maybe," said Bosworth. He
scrambled into his sleigh, and was driving off in his turn when he
heard his companion calling after him. The Deacon explained that his
horse had cast a shoe; would Bosworth drive him down to the forge
near North Ashmore, if it wasn't too much out of his way? He didn't
want the mare slipping about on the freezing snow, and he could
probably get the blacksmith to drive him back and shoe her in
Rutledge's shed. Bosworth made room for him under the bearskin, and
the two men drove off, pursued by a puzzled whinny from the Deacon's
old mare.</p>

<p>The road they took was not the one that Bosworth would have
followed to reach his own home. But he did not mind that. The
shortest way to the forge passed close by Lamer's pond, and Bosworth,
since he was in for the business, was not sorry to look the ground
over. They drove on in silence.</p>

<p>The snow had ceased, and a green sunset was spreading upward into
the crystal sky. A stinging wind barbed with ice-flakes caught them
in the face on the open ridges, but when they dropped down into the
hollow by Lamer's pond the air was as soundless and empty as an
unswung bell. They jogged along slowly, each thinking his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>"That's the house...that tumble-down shack over there, I suppose?"
the Deacon said, as the road drew near the edge of the frozen
pond.</p>

<p>"Yes: that's the house. A queer hermit-fellow built it years ago,
my father used to tell me. Since then I don't believe it's ever been
used but by the gipsies."</p>

<p>Bosworth had reined in his horse, and sat looking through
pine-trunks purpled by the sunset at the crumbling structure.
Twilight already lay under the trees, though day lingered in the
open. Between two sharply-patterned pine-boughs he saw the evening
star, like a white boat in a sea of green.</p>

<p>His gaze dropped from that fathomless sky and followed the
blue-white undulations of the snow. It gave him a curious agitated
feeling to think that here, in this icy solitude, in the tumble-down
house he had so often passed without heeding it, a dark mystery, too
deep for thought, was being enacted. Down that very slope, coming
from the grave-yard at Cold Corners, the being they called "Ora" must
pass toward the pond. His heart began to beat stiflingly. Suddenly he
gave an exclamation: "Look!"</p>

<p>He had jumped out of the cutter and was stumbling up the bank
toward the slope of snow. On it, turned in the direction of the house
by the pond, he had detected a woman's foot-prints; two; then three;
then more. The Deacon scrambled out after him, and they stood and
stared.</p>

<p>"God&mdash;barefoot!" Hibben gasped. "Then it <i>is</i>...the
dead..."</p>

<p>Bosworth said nothing. But he knew that no live woman would travel
with naked feet across that freezing wilderness. Here, then, was the
proof the Deacon had asked for&mdash;they held it. What should they do
with it?</p>

<p>"Supposing we was to drive up nearer&mdash;round the turn of the pond,
till we get close to the house," the Deacon proposed in a colourless
voice. "Mebbe then..."</p>

<p>Postponement was a relief. They got into the sleigh and drove on.
Two or three hundred yards farther the road, a mere lane under steep
bushy banks, turned sharply to the right, following the bend of the
pond. As they rounded the turn they saw Brand's cutter ahead of them.
It was empty, the horse tied to a tree-trunk. The two men looked at
each other again. This was not Brand's nearest way home.</p>

<p>Evidently he had been actuated by the same impulse which had made
them rein in their horse by the pond-side, and then hasten on to the
deserted hovel. Had he too discovered those spectral foot-prints?
Perhaps it was for that very reason that he had left his cutter and
vanished in the direction of the house. Bosworth found himself
shivering all over under his bearskin. "I wish to God the dark wasn't
coming on," he muttered. He tethered his own horse near Brand's, and
without a word he and the Deacon ploughed through the snow, in the
track of Brand's huge feet. They had only a few yards to walk to
overtake him. He did not hear them following him, and when Bosworth
spoke his name, and he stopped short and turned, his heavy face was
dim and confused, like a darker blot on the dusk. He looked at them
dully, but without surprise.</p>

<p>"I wanted to see the place," he merely said.</p>

<p>The Deacon cleared his throat. "Just take a look...yes...We
thought so...But I guess there won't be anything to <i>see</i>..." He
attempted a chuckle.</p>

<p>The other did not seem to hear him, but laboured on ahead through
the pines. The three men came out together in the cleared space
before the house. As they emerged from beneath the trees they seemed
to have left night behind. The evening star shed a lustre on the
speckless snow, and Brand, in that lucid circle, stopped with a jerk,
and pointed to the same light foot-prints turned toward the
house&mdash;the track of a woman in the snow. He stood still, his face
working. "Bare feet..." he said.</p>

<p>The Deacon piped up in a quavering voice: "The feet of the
dead."</p>

<p>Brand remained motionless. "The feet of the dead," he echoed.</p>

<p>Deacon Hibben laid a frightened hand on his arm. "Come away now,
Brand; for the love of God come away."</p>

<p>The father hung there, gazing down at those light tracks on the
snow&mdash;light as fox or squirrel trails they seemed, on the white
immensity. Bosworth thought to himself "The living couldn't walk so
light&mdash;not even Ora Brand couldn't have, when she lived..." The cold
seemed to have entered into his very marrow. His teeth were
chattering.</p>

<p>Brand swung about on them abruptly. "<i>Now!</i>" he said, moving
on as if to an assault, his head bowed forward on his bull neck.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;now? Not in there?" gasped the Deacon. "What's the use? It
was tomorrow he said&mdash;." He shook like a leaf.</p>

<p>"It's now," said Brand. He went up to the door of the crazy house,
pushed it inward, and meeting with an unexpected resistance, thrust
his heavy shoulder against the panel. The door collapsed like a
playing-card, and Brand stumbled after it into the darkness of the
hut. The others, after a moment's hesitation, followed.</p>

<p>Bosworth was never quite sure in what order the events that
succeeded took place. Coming in out of the snow-dazzle, he seemed to
be plunging into total blackness. He groped his way across the
threshold, caught a sharp splinter of the fallen door in his palm,
seemed to see something white and wraithlike surge up out of the
darkest corner of the hut, and then heard a revolver shot at his
elbow, and a cry&mdash;</p>

<p>Brand had turned back, and was staggering past him out into the
lingering daylight. The sunset, suddenly flushing through the trees,
crimsoned his face like blood. He held a revolver in his hand and
looked about him in his stupid way.</p>

<p>"They <i>do</i> walk, then," he said and began to laugh. He bent
his head to examine his weapon. "Better here than in the churchyard.
They shan't dig her up <i>now</i>," he shouted out. The two men
caught him by the arms, and Bosworth got the revolver away from
him.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The next day Bosworth's sister Loretta, who kept house for him,
asked him, when he came in for his midday dinner, if he had heard the
news.</p>

<p>Bosworth had been sawing wood all the morning, and in spite of the
cold and the driving snow, which had begun again in the night, he was
covered with an icy sweat, like a man getting over a fever.</p>

<p>"What news?"</p>

<p>"Venny Brand's down sick with pneumonia. The Deacon's been there.
I guess she's dying."</p>

<p>Bosworth looked at her with listless eyes. She seemed far off from
him, miles away. "Venny Brand?" he echoed.</p>

<p>"You never liked her, Orrin."</p>

<p>"She's a child. I never knew much about her."</p>

<p>"Well," repeated his sister, with the guileless relish of the
unimaginative for bad news, "I guess she's dying." After a pause she
added: "It'll kill Sylvester Brand, all alone up there."</p>

<p>Bosworth got up and said: "I've got to see to poulticing the
gray's fetlock." He walked out into the steadily falling snow.</p>

<p>Venny Brand was buried three days later. The Deacon read the
service; Bosworth was one of the pall-bearers. The whole countryside
turned out, for the snow had stopped falling, and at any season a
funeral offered an opportunity for an outing that was not to be
missed. Besides, Venny Brand was young and handsome&mdash;at least some
people thought her handsome, though she was so swarthy&mdash;and her dying
like that, so suddenly, had the fascination of tragedy.</p>

<p>"They say her lungs filled right up...Seems she'd had bronchial
troubles before...I always said both them girls was frail...Look at
Ora, how she took and wasted away I And it's colder'n all outdoors up
there to Brand's...Their mother, too, <i>she</i> pined away just the
same. They don't ever make old bones on the mother's side of the
family...There's that young Bedlow over there; they say Venny was
engaged to him...Oh, Mrs. Rutledge, excuse <i>me</i>...Step right
into the pew; there's a seat for you alongside of grandma..."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rutledge was advancing with deliberate step down the narrow
aisle of the bleak wooden church. She had on her best bonnet, a
monumental structure which no one had seen out of her trunk since old
Mrs. Silsee's funeral, three years before. All the women remembered
it. Under its perpendicular pile her narrow face, swaying on the long
thin neck, seemed whiter than ever; but her air of fretfulness had
been composed into a suitable expression of mournful immobility.</p>

<p>"Looks as if the stone-mason had carved her to put atop of Venny's
grave," Bosworth thought as she glided past him; and then shivered at
his own sepulchral fancy. When she bent over her hymn book her
lowered lids reminded him again of marble eye-balls; the bony hands
clasping the book were bloodless. Bosworth had never seen such hands
since he had seen old Aunt Cressidora Cheney strangle the canary-bird
because it fluttered.</p>

<p>The service was over, the coffin of Venny Brand had been lowered
into her sister's grave, and the neighbours were slowly dispersing.
Bosworth, as pall-bearer, felt obliged to linger and say a word to
the stricken father. He waited till Brand had turned from the grave
with the Deacon at his side. The three men stood together for a
moment; but not one of them spoke. Brand's face was the closed door
of a vault, barred with wrinkles like bands of iron.</p>

<p>Finally the Deacon took his hand and said: "The Lord gave&mdash;"</p>

<p>Brand nodded and turned away toward the shed where the horses were
hitched. Bosworth followed him. "Let me drive along home with you,"
he suggested.</p>

<p>Brand did not so much as turn his head. "Home? What home?" he
said; and the other fell back.</p>

<p>Loretta Bosworth was talking with the other women while the men
unblanketed their horses and backed the cutters out into the heavy
snow. As Bosworth waited for her, a few feet off, he saw Mrs.
Rutledge's tall bonnet lording it above the group. Andy Pond, the
Rutledge farm-hand, was backing out the sleigh.</p>

<p>"Saul ain't here today, Mrs. Rutledge, is he?" one of the village
elders piped, turning a benevolent old tortoise-head about on a loose
neck, and blinking up into Mrs. Rutledge's marble face.</p>

<p>Bosworth heard her measure out her answer in slow incisive words.
"No. Mr. Rutledge he ain't here. He would 'a' come for certain, but
his aunt Minorca Cummins is being buried down to Stotesbury this very
day and he had to go down there. Don't it sometimes seem zif we was
all walking right in the Shadow of Death?"</p>

<p>As she walked toward the cutter, in which Andy Pond was already
seated, the Deacon went up to her with visible hesitation.
Involuntarily Bosworth also moved nearer. He heard the Deacon say:
"I'm glad to hear that Saul is able to be up and around."</p>

<p>She turned her small head on her rigid neck, and lifted the lids
of marble.</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess he'll sleep quieter now.&mdash;And her too, maybe, now
she don't lay there alone any longer," she added in a low voice, with
a sudden twist of her chin toward the fresh black stain in the
grave-yard snow. She got into the cutter, and said in a clear tone to
Andy Pond: "'S long as we're down here I don't know but what I'll
just call round and get a box of soap at Hiram Pringle's."</p>

<h2><a name="s4"></a>THE SEED OF THE FAITH</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The blinding June sky of Africa hung over the town. In the doorway
of an Arab coffee-house a young man stood listening to the remarks
exchanged by the patrons of the establishment, who lay in torpid
heaps on the low shelf bordering the room.</p>

<p>The young man's caftan was faded to a dingy brown, but the muslin
garment covering it was clean, and so was the turban wound about his
shabby fez.</p>

<p>Cleanliness was not the most marked characteristic of the
conversation to which he lent a listless ear. It was no prurient
curiosity that fixed his attention on this placid exchange of
obscenities: he had lived too long in Morocco for obscenities not to
have lost their savour. But he had never quite overcome the
fascinated disgust with which he listened, nor the hope that one
among the talkers would suddenly reveal some sense of a higher ideal,
of what, at home, the earnest women he knew used solemnly to call a
Purpose. He was sure that, some day, such a sign would come, and
then&mdash;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at that hour, there was nothing on earth to do in
Eloued but to stand and listen&mdash;</p>

<p>The bazaar was beginning to fill up. Looking down the vaulted
tunnel which led to the coffee-house the young man watched the
thickening throng of shoppers and idlers. The fat merchant whose shop
faced the end of the tunnel had just ridden up and rolled off his
mule, while his black boy unbarred the door of the niche hung with
embroidered slippers where the master throned. The young man in the
faded caftan, watching the merchant scramble up and sink into his
cushions, wondered for the thousandth time what he thought about all
day in his dim stifling kennel, and what he did when he was away from
it...for no length of residence in that dark land seemed to bring one
nearer to finding out what the heathen thought and did when the eye
of the Christian was off him.</p>

<p>Suddenly a wave of excitement ran through the crowd. Every head
turned in the same direction, and even the camels bent their frowning
faces and stretched their necks all one way, as animals do before a
storm. A wild hoot had penetrated the bazaar, howling through the
long white tunnels and under the reed-woven roofs like a Djinn among
dishonoured graves. The heart of the young man began to beat.</p>

<p>"It sounds," he thought, "like a motor..."</p>

<p>But a motor at Eloued! There was one, every one knew, in the
Sultan's Palace. It had been brought there years ago by a foreign
Ambassador, as a gift from his sovereign, and was variously reported
to be made entirely of aluminium, platinum or silver. But the parts
had never been put together, the body had long been used for breeding
silk-worms in&mdash;a not wholly successful experiment&mdash;and the acetylene
lamps adorned the Pasha's gardens on state occasions. As for the
horn, it had been sent as a gift, with a choice panoply of arms, to
the Ca&iuml;d of the Red Mountain; but as the india-rubber bulb had
accidentally been left behind, it was certainly not the Ca&iuml;d's
visit which the present discordant cries announced...</p>

<p>"Hullo, you old dromedary! How's the folks up state?" cried a
ringing voice. The awestruck populace gave way, and a young man in
linen duster and motor cap, slipping under the interwoven necks of
the astonished camels, strode down the tunnel with an air of
authority and clapped a hand on the dreamer in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Harry Spink!" the latter gasped in a startled whisper, and with
an intonation as un-African as his friend's. At the same instant he
glanced over his shoulder, and his mild lips formed a cautious:
"'sh."</p>

<p>"Who'd you take me for&mdash;Gabby Deslys?" asked the newcomer gaily;
then, seeing that this topical allusion hung fire: "And what the
dickens are you 'hushing' for, anyhow? You don't suppose, do you,
that anybody in the bazaar thinks you're a <i>native?</i> D'y' ever
look at your chin? Or that Adam's apple running up and down you like
a bead on a billiard marker's wire? See here, Willard Bent..."</p>

<p>The young man in the caftan blushed distressfully, not so much at
the graphic reference to his looks as at the doubt cast on his
disguise.</p>

<p>"I do assure you, Harry, I pick up a great deal of...of useful
information...in this way..."</p>

<p>"Oh, get out," said Harry Spink cheerfully. "You believe all that
still, do you? What's the good of it all, anyway?"</p>

<p>Willard Bent passed a hand under the other's arm and led him
through the coffee-house into an empty room at the back. They sat down
on a shelf covered with matting and looked at each other
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Don't <i>you</i> believe any longer, Harry Spink?" asked Willard
Bent.</p>

<p>"Don't have to. I'm travelling for rubber now."</p>

<p>"Oh, merciful heaven! Was that your automobile?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>There was a long silence, during which</p>

<p>Bent sat with bowed head gazing on the earthen floor, while the
bead in his throat performed its most active gymnastics. At last he
lifted his eyes and fixed them on the tight red face of his
companion.</p>

<p>"When did your faith fail you?" he asked.</p>

<p>The other considered him humorously. "Why&mdash;when I got onto this
job, I guess."</p>

<p>Willard Bent rose and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye...I must go...If I can be of any use...you know where to
find me..."</p>

<p>"Any use? Say, old man, what's wrong? Are you trying to shake me?"
Bent was silent, and Harry Spink continued insidiously: "Ain't you a
mite hard on me? I thought the heathen was just what you was laying
for."</p>

<p>Bent smiled mournfully. "There's no use trying to convert a
renegade."</p>

<p>"That what I am? Well&mdash;all right. But how about the others?
Say&mdash;let's order a lap of tea and have it out right here."</p>

<p>Bent seemed to hesitate; but at length he rose, put back the
matting that screened the inner room, and said a word to the
proprietor. Presently a scrofulous boy with gazelle eyes brought a
brass tray bearing glasses and pipes of <i>kif</i>, gazed earnestly
at the stranger in the linen duster, and slid back behind the
matting.</p>

<p>"Of course," Bent began, "a good many people know I am a Baptist
missionary"&mdash;("<i>No?</i>" from Spink, incredulously)&mdash;"but in the
crowd of the bazaar they don't notice me, and I hear things..."</p>

<p>"Golly! I should suppose you did."</p>

<p>"I mean, things that may be useful. You know Mr. Blandhorn's
idea..."</p>

<p>A tinge of respectful commiseration veiled the easy impudence of
the drummer's look. "The old man still here, is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; of course. He will never leave Eloued."</p>

<p>"And the missus&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Bent again lowered his naturally low voice. "She died&mdash;a year
ago&mdash;of the climate. The doctor had warned her; but Mr. Blandhorn
felt a call to remain here."</p>

<p>"And she wouldn't leave without him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>she</i> felt a call too...among the women..."</p>

<p>Spink pondered. "How many years you been here, Willard?"</p>

<p>"Ten next July," the other responded, as if he had added up the
weeks and months so often that the reply was always on his lips.</p>

<p>"And the old man?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five last April. We had planned a celebration...before
Mrs. Blandhorn died. There was to have been a testimonial
offered...but, owing to her death, Mr. Blandhorn preferred to devote
the sum to our dispensary."</p>

<p>"I see. How much?" said Spink sharply.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't seem much to you. I believe about fifty
pesetas...</p>

<p>"Two pesetas a year? Lucky the Society looks after you, ain't
it?"</p>

<p>Willard Bent met his ironic glance steadily. "We're not here to
trade," he said with dignity.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;that's right too&mdash;" Spink reddened slightly. "Well, all I
meant was&mdash;look at here, Willard, we're old friends, even if I did go
wrong, as I suppose you'd call it. I was in this thing near on a year
myself, and what always tormented me was this: <i>What does it all
amount to?</i>"</p>

<p>"Amount to?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I mean, what's the results? Supposing you was a fisherman.
Well, if you fished a bit of river year after year, and never had a
nibble, you'd do one of two things, wouldn't you? Move away&mdash;or lie
about it. See?"</p>

<p>Bent nodded without speaking. Spink set down his glass and busied
himself with the lighting of his long slender pipe. "Say, this
mint-julep feels like old times," he remarked.</p>

<p>Bent continued to gaze frowningly into his untouched glass. At
length he swallowed the sweet decoction at a gulp, and turned to his
companion.</p>

<p>"I'd never lie..." he murmured. "Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm still&mdash;waiting..."</p>

<p>"Waiting&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The wind bloweth where it listeth. If St. Paul had stopped
to count...in Corinth, say. As I take it&mdash;" he looked long and
passionately at the drummer&mdash;"as I take it, the thing is to <i>be</i>
St. Paul."</p>

<p>Harry Spink remained unimpressed. "That's all talk&mdash;I heard all
that when I was here before. What I want to know is: What's your bag?
How many?"</p>

<p>"It's difficult&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see: like the pigs. They run around so!"</p>

<p>Both the young men were silent, Spink pulling at his pipe, the
other sitting with bent head, his eyes obstinately fixed on the
beaten floor. At length Spink rose and tapped the missionary on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;s'posin' we take a look around Corinth? I got to get onto my
job tomorrow, but I'd like to take a turn round the old place
first."</p>

<p>Willard Bent rose also. He felt singularly old and tired, and his
mind was full of doubt as to what he ought to do. If he refused to
accompany Harry Spink, a former friend and fellow-worker, it might
look like running away from his questions...</p>

<p>They went out together.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The bazaar was seething. It seemed impossible that two more people
should penetrate the throng of beggars, pilgrims, traders,
slave-women, water-sellers, hawkers of dates and sweetmeats,
leather-gaitered country-people carrying bunches of hens
head-downward, jugglers' touts from the market-place, Jews in black
caftans and greasy turbans, and scrofulous children reaching up to
the high counters to fill their jars and baskets. But every now and
then the Arab "Look out!" made the crowd divide and flatten itself
against the stalls, and a long line of donkeys loaded with
water-barrels or bundles of reeds, a string of musk-scented camels
swaying their necks like horizontal question marks, or a great man
perched on a pink-saddled mule and followed by slaves and clients,
swept through the narrow passage without other peril to the
pedestrians than that of a fresh exchange of vermin.</p>

<p>As the two young men drew back to make way for one of these
processions, Willard Bent lifted his head and looked at his friend
with a smile. "That's what Mr. Blandhorn says we ought to
remember&mdash;it's one of his favourite images."</p>

<p>"What is?" asked Harry Spink, following with attentive gaze the
movements of a young Jewess whose uncovered face and bright
head-dress stood out against a group of muffled Arab women.</p>

<p>Instinctively Willard's voice took on a hortatory roll.</p>

<p>"Why, the way this dense mass of people, so heedless, so
preoccupied, is imperceptibly penetrated&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By a handful of asses? That's so. But the asses have got some
kick in 'em, remember!"</p>

<p>The missionary flushed to the edge of his fez, and his mild eyes
grew dim. It was the old story: Harry Spink invariably got the better
of him in bandying words&mdash;and the interpretation of allegories had
never been his strong point. Mr. Blandhorn always managed to make
them sound unanswerable, whereas on his disciple's lips they fell to
pieces at a touch. What <i>was</i> it that Willard always left
out?</p>

<p>A mournful sense of his unworthiness overcame him, and with it the
discouraged vision of all the long months and years spent in the
struggle with heat and dust and flies and filth and wickedness, the
long lonely years of his youth that would never come back to him. It
was the vision he most dreaded, and turning from it he tried to
forget himself in watching his friend.</p>

<p>"Golly! The vacuum-cleaner ain't been round since my last visit,"
Mr. Spink observed, as they slipped in a mass of offal beneath a
butcher's stall. "Let's get into another soukh&mdash;the flies here beat
me."</p>

<p>They turned into another long lane chequered with a criss-cross of
black reed-shadows. It was the saddlers' quarter, and here an even
thicker crowd wriggled and swayed between the cramped stalls hung
with bright leather and spangled ornaments.</p>

<p>"Say! It might be a good idea to import some of this stuff for
Fourth of July processions&mdash;Knights of Pythias and Secret Societies'
kinder thing," Spink mused, pausing before the brilliant spectacle.
At the same moment a lad in an almond-green caftan sidled up and
touched his arm.</p>

<p>Willard's face brightened. "Ah, that's little Ahmed&mdash;you don't
remember him? Surely&mdash;the water-carrier's boy. Mrs. Blandhorn saved
his mother's life when he was born, and he still comes to prayers.
Yes, Ahmed, this is your old friend Mr. Spink."</p>

<p>Ahmed raised prodigious lashes from seraphic eyes and reverently
surveyed the face of his old friend. "Me 'member."</p>

<p>"Hullo, old chap...why, of course...so do I," the drummer beamed.
The missionary laid a brotherly hand on the boy's shoulder. It was
really providential that Ahmed&mdash;whom they hadn't seen at the Mission
for more weeks than Willard cared to count&mdash;should have "happened by"
at that moment: Willard took it as a rebuke to his own doubts.</p>

<p>"You'll be in this evening for prayers, won't you, Ahmed?" he
said, as if Ahmed never failed them. "Mr. Spink will be with us."</p>

<p>"Yessir," said Ahmed with unction. He slipped from under Willard's
hand, and outflanking the drummer approached him from the farther
side.</p>

<p>"Show you Souss boys dance? Down to old Jewess's, Bab-el-Soukh,"
he breathed angelically.</p>

<p>Willard saw his companion turn from red to a wrathful purple.</p>

<p>"Get out, you young swine, you&mdash;do you hear me?"</p>

<p>Ahmed grinned, wavered and vanished, engulfed in the careless
crowd. The young men walked on without speaking.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>In the market-place they parted. Willard Bent, after some
hesitation, had asked Harry Spink to come to the Mission that
evening. "You'd better come to supper&mdash;then we can talk quietly
afterward. Mr. Blandhorn will want to see you," he suggested; and Mr.
Spink had affably acquiesced.</p>

<p>The prayer-meeting was before supper, and Willard would have liked
to propose that his friend should come to that also; but he did not
dare. He said to himself that Harry Spink, who had been merely a lay
assistant, might have lost the habit of reverence, and that it would
be too painful to risk his scandalizing Mr. Blandhorn. But that was
only a sham reason; and Willard, with his incorrigible habit of
self-exploration, fished up the real one from a lower depth. What he
had most feared was that there would be no one at the meeting.</p>

<p>During Mrs. Blandhorn's lifetime there had been no reason for such
apprehension: they could always count on a few people. Mrs.
Blandhorn, who had studied medicine at Ann Arbor, Michigan, had early
gained renown in Eloued by her miraculous healing powers. The
dispensary, in those days, had been beset by anxious-eyed women who
unwound skinny fig-coloured children from their dirty draperies; and
there had even been a time when Mr. Blandhorn had appealed to the
Society for a young lady missionary to assist his wife. But, for
reasons not quite clear to Willard Bent, Mrs. Blandhorn, a
thin-lipped determined little woman, had energetically opposed the
coming of this youthful "Sister," and had declared that their Jewish
maid-servant, old Myriem, could give her all the aid she needed.</p>

<p>Mr. Blandhorn yielded, as he usually did&mdash;as he had yielded, for
instance, when one day, in a white inarticulate fury, his wife had
banished her godson, little Ahmed (whose life she had saved), and
issued orders that he should never show himself again except at
prayer-meeting, and accompanied by his father. Mrs. Blandhorn, small,
silent and passionate, had always&mdash;as Bent made out in his long
retrospective musings&mdash;ended by having her way in the conflicts that
occasionally shook the monotony of life at the Mission. After her
death the young man had even suspected, beneath his superior's
sincere and vehement sorrow, a lurking sense of relief. Mr. Blandhorn
had snuffed the air of freedom, and had been, for the moment,
slightly intoxicated by it. But not for long. Very soon his wife's
loss made itself felt as a lasting void.</p>

<p>She had been (as Spink would have put it) "the whole show"; had
led, inspired, organized her husband's work, held it together, and
given it the brave front it presented to the unheeding heathen. Now
the heathen had almost entirely fallen away, and the too evident
inference was that they had come rather for Mrs. Blandhorn's pills
than for her husband's preaching. Neither of the missionaries had
avowed this discovery to the other, but to Willard at least it was
implied in all the circumlocutions and evasions of their endless
talks.</p>

<p>The young man's situation had been greatly changed by Mrs.
Blandhorn's death. His superior had grown touchingly dependent on
him. Their conversation, formerly confined to parochial matters, now
ranged from abstruse doctrinal problems to the question of how to
induce Myriem, who had deplorably "relapsed," to keep the kitchen
cleaner and spend less time on the roofs. Bent felt that Mr.
Blandhorn needed him at every moment, and that, during any prolonged
absence, something vaguely "unfortunate" might happen at the
Mission.</p>

<p>"I'm glad Spink has come; it will do him good to see somebody from
outside," Willard thought, nervously hoping that Spink (a good fellow
at bottom) would not trouble Mr. Blandhorn by any of his "unsettling"
questions.</p>

<p>At the end of a labyrinth of lanes, on the farther side of the
Jewish quarter, a wall of heat-cracked clay bore the inscription:
"American Evangelical Mission." Underneath it a door opened into a
court where an old woman in a bright head-dress sat under a fig-tree
pounding something in a mortar.</p>

<p>She looked up, and, rising, touched Bent's draperies with her
lips. Her small face, withered as a dry medlar, was full of an
ancient wisdom: Mrs. Blandhorn had certainly been right in trusting
Myriem.</p>

<p>A narrow house-front looked upon the court. Bent climbed the
stairs to Mr. Blandhorn's study. It was a small room with a few
dog-eared books on a set of rough shelves, the table at which Mr.
Blandhorn wrote his reports for the Society, and a mattress covered
with a bit of faded carpet, on which he slept. Near the window stood
Mrs. Blandhorn's sewing-machine; it had never been moved since her
death.</p>

<p>The missionary was sitting in the middle of the room, in the
rocking chair which had also been his wife's. His large veined hands
were clasped about its arms and his head rested against a patch-work
cushion tied to the back by a shoe-lace. His mouth was slightly open,
and a deep breath, occasionally rising to a whistle, proceeded with
rhythmic regularity from his delicately-cut nostrils. Even surprised
in sleep he was a fine man to look upon; and when, at the sound of
Bent's approach, he opened his eyes and pulled himself out of his
chair, he became magnificent. He had taken off his turban, and thrown
a handkerchief over his head, which was shaved like an Arab's for
coolness. His long beard was white, with the smoker's yellow tinge
about the lips; but his eyebrows were jet-black, arched and restless.
The gray eyes beneath them shed a mild benedictory beam, confirmed by
the smile of a mouth which might have seemed weak if the beard had
not so nearly concealed it. But the forehead menaced, fulminated or
awed with the ever-varying play of the eyebrows. Willard Bent never
beheld that forehead without thinking of Sinai.</p>

<p>Mr. Blandhorn brushed some shreds of tobacco from his white
djellabah and looked impressively at his assistant.</p>

<p>"The heat is really overwhelming," he said, as if excusing
himself. He readjusted his turban, and then asked: "Is everything
ready downstairs?"</p>

<p>Bent assented, and they went down to the long bare room where the
prayer-meetings were held. In Mrs. Blandhorn's day it had also served
as the dispensary, and a cupboard containing drugs and bandages stood
against the wall under the text: "<i>Come unto me, all ye that labour
and are heavy laden.</i>"</p>

<p>Myriem, abandoning her mortar, was vaguely tidying the Arab tracts
and leaflets that lay on the divan against the wall. At one end of
the room stood a table covered with a white cloth, with a Bible lying
on it; and to the left a sort of pulpit-lectern, from which Mr.
Blandhorn addressed his flock. In the doorway squatted Ayoub, a
silent gray-headed negro; Bent, on his own arrival at Eloued, ten
years earlier, had found him there in the same place and the same
attitude. Ayoub was supposed to be a rescued slave from the Soudan,
and was shown to visitors as "our first convert." He manifested no
interest at the approach of the missionaries, but continued to gaze
out into the sun-baked court cut in half by the shadow of the
fig-tree.</p>

<p>Mr. Blandhorn, after looking about the empty room as if he were
surveying the upturned faces of an attentive congregation, placed
himself at the lectern, put on his spectacles, and turned over the
pages of his prayer-book. Then he knelt and bowed his head in prayer.
His devotions ended, he rose and seated himself in the cane arm-chair
that faced the lectern. Willard Bent sat opposite in another
arm-chair. Mr. Blandhorn leaned back, breathing heavily, and passing
his handkerchief over his face and brow. Now and then he drew out his
watch, now and then he said: "The heat is really overwhelming."</p>

<p>Myriem had drifted back to her fig-tree, and the sound of the
pestle mingled with the drone of flies on the window-pane.
Occasionally the curses of a muleteer or the rhythmic chant of a
water-carrier broke the silence; once there came from a neighbouring
roof the noise of a short cat-like squabble ending in female howls;
then the afternoon heat laid its leaden hush on all things.</p>

<p>Mr. Blandhorn opened his mouth and slept.</p>

<p>Willard Bent, watching him, thought with wonder and admiration of
his past. What had he not seen, what secrets were not hidden in his
bosom? By dint of sheer "sticking it out" he had acquired to the
younger man a sort of visible sanctity. Twenty-five years of Eloued!
He had known the old mad torturing Sultan, he had seen, after the
defeat of the rebels, the long line of prisoners staggering in under
a torrid sky, chained wrist to wrist, and dragging between them the
putrefying bodies of those who had died on the march. He had seen the
Great Massacre, when the rivers were red with French blood, and the
Blandhorns had hidden an officer's wife and children in the
rat-haunted drain under the court; he had known robbery and murder
and intrigue, and all the dark maleficence of Africa; and he remained
as serene, as confident and guileless, as on the day when he had
first set foot on that evil soil, saying to himself (as he had told
Willard): "<i>I will tread upon the lion and the adder, the young
lion and the dragon will I tread under foot.</i>"</p>

<p>Willard Bent hated Africa; but it awed and fascinated him. And as
he contemplated the splendid old man sleeping opposite him, so
mysterious, so childlike and so weak (Mrs. Blandhorn had left him no
doubts on that point), the disciple marvelled at the power of the
faith which had armed his master with a sort of infantile strength
against such dark and manifold perils.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shadow fell in the doorway, and Bent, roused from his
dream, saw Harry Spink tiptoeing past the unmoved Ayoub. The drummer
paused and looked with astonishment from one of the missionaries to
the other. "Say," he asked, "is prayer-meeting over? I thought I'd be
round in time."</p>

<p>He spoke seriously, even respectfully; it was plain that he felt
flippancy to be out of place. But Bent suspected a lurking malice
under his astonishment: he was sure Harry Spink had come to "count
heads."</p>

<p>Mr. Blandhorn, wakened by the voice, stood up heavily.</p>

<p>"Harry Spink! Is it possible you are amongst us?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir&mdash;I'm amongst. Didn't Willard tell you? I guess
Willard Bent's ashamed of me."</p>

<p>Spink, with a laugh, shook Mr. Blandhorn's hand, and glanced
about the empty room.</p>

<p>"I'm only here for a day or so&mdash;on business. Willard'll explain.
But I wanted to come round to meeting&mdash;like old times. Sorry it's
over."</p>

<p>The missionary looked at him with a grave candour. "It's not
over&mdash;it has not begun. The overwhelming heat has probably kept away
our little flock."</p>

<p>"I see," interpolated Spink.</p>

<p>"But now," continued Mr. Blandhorn with majesty, "that two or
three are gathered together in His name, there is no reason why we
should wait.&mdash;Myriem! Ayoub!"</p>

<p>He took his place behind the lectern and began: "Almighty and
merciful Father&mdash;"</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The night was exceedingly close. Willard Bent, after Spink's
departure, had undressed and stretched himself on his camp bed; but
the mosquitoes roared like lions, and lying down made him more
wakeful.</p>

<p>"In any Christian country," he mused, "this would mean a
thunderstorm and a cool-off. Here it just means months and months
more of the same thing." And he thought enviously of Spink, who, in
two or three days, his "deal" concluded, would be at sea again,
heading for the north.</p>

<p>Bent was honestly distressed at his own state of mind: he had
feared that Harry Spink would "unsettle" Mr. Blandhorn, and, instead,
it was he himself who had been unsettled. Old slumbering distrusts
and doubts, bursting through his surface-apathy, had shot up under
the drummer's ironic eye. It was not so much Spink, individually, who
had loosened the crust of Bent's indifference; it was the fact of
feeling his whole problem suddenly viewed and judged from the
outside. At Eloued, he was aware, nobody, for a long time, had
thought much about the missionaries. The French authorities were
friendly, the Pacha was tolerant, the American Consul at Mogador had
always stood by them in any small difficulties. But beyond that they
were virtually non-existent. Nobody's view of life was really
affected by their presence in the great swarming mysterious city: if
they should pack up and leave that night, the story-tellers of the
market would not interrupt their tales, or one less bargain be struck
in the bazaar. Ayoub would still doze in the door, and old Myriem
continue her secret life on the roofs...</p>

<p>The roofs were of course forbidden to the missionaries, as they
are to men in all Moslem cities. But the Mission-house stood close to
the walls, and Mr. Blandhorn's room, across the passage, gave on a
small terrace overhanging the court of a caravansary upon which it
was no sin to look. Willard wondered if it were any cooler on the
terrace.</p>

<p>Some one tapped on his open door, and Mr. Blandhorn, in turban and
caftan, entered the room, shading a small lamp.</p>

<p>"My dear Willard&mdash;can you sleep?"</p>

<p>"No, sir." The young man stumbled to his feet.</p>

<p>"Nor I. The heat is really...Shall we seek relief on the
terrace?"</p>

<p>Bent followed him, and having extinguished the lamp Mr. Blandhorn
led the way out. He dragged a strip of matting to the edge of the
parapet, and the two men sat down on it side by side.</p>

<p>There was no moon, but a sky so full of stars that the city was
outlined beneath it in great blue-gray masses. The air was
motionless, but every now and then a wandering tremor stirred it and
died out. Close under the parapet lay the bales and saddle-packs of
the caravansary, between vaguer heaps, presumably of sleeping camels.
In one corner, the star-glitter picked out the shape of a trough
brimming with water, and stabbed it with long silver beams. Beyond
the court rose the crenellations of the city walls, and above them
one palm stood up like a tree of bronze.</p>

<p>"Africa&mdash;" sighed Mr. Blandhorn.</p>

<p>Willard Bent started at the secret echo of his own thoughts.</p>

<p>"Yes. Never anything else, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;" said the old man.</p>

<p>A tang-tang of stringed instruments, accompanied by the lowing of
an earthenware drum, rose exasperatingly through the night. It was
the kind of noise that, one knew, had been going on for hours before
one began to notice it, and would go on, unchecked and unchanging,
for endless hours more: like the heat, like the drought&mdash;like
Africa.</p>

<p>Willard slapped at a mosquito.</p>

<p>"It's a party at the wool-merchant's, Myriem tells me," Mr.
Blandhorn remarked. It really seemed as if, that night, the thoughts
of the two men met without the need of words. Willard Bent was aware
that, for both, the casual phrase had called up all the details of
the scene: fat merchants in white bunches on their cushions,
negresses coming and going with trays of sweets, champagne
clandestinely poured, ugly singing-girls yowling, slim boys in
petticoats dancing&mdash;perhaps little Ahmed among them.</p>

<p>"I went down to the court just now. Ayoub has disappeared," Mr.
Blandhorn continued. "Of course. When I heard in the bazaar that a
black caravan was in from the south I knew he'd be off..."</p>

<p>Mr. Blandhorn lowered his voice. "Willard&mdash;have you reason to
think...that Ayoub joins in their rites?"</p>

<p>"Myriem has always said he was a Hamatcha, sir. Look at those
queer cuts and scars on him...It's a much bloodier sect than the
Aissaouas."</p>

<p>Through the nagging throb of the instruments came a sound of human
wailing, cadenced, terrible, relentless, carried from a long way off
on a lift of the air. Then the air died, and the wailing with it.</p>

<p>"From somewhere near the Potter's Field...there's where the
caravan is camping," Willard murmured.</p>

<p>The old man made no answer. He sat with his head bowed, his veined
hands grasping his knees; he seemed to his disciple to be whispering
fragments of Scripture.</p>

<p>"Willard, my son, this is our fault," he said at length.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;? Ayoub?"</p>

<p>"Ayoub is a poor ignorant creature, hardly more than an animal.
Even when he witnessed for Jesus I was not very sure the Word reached
him. I refer to&mdash;to what Harry Spink said this evening...It has kept
me from sleeping, Willard Bent."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know, sir."</p>

<p>"Harry Spink is a worldly-minded man. But he is not a bad man. He
did a manly thing when he left us, since he did not feel the call.
But we have felt the call, Willard, you and I&mdash;and when a man like
Spink puts us a question such as he put this evening we ought to be
able to answer it. And we ought not to want to avoid answering
it."</p>

<p>"You mean when he said: '<i>What is there in it for
Jesus?</i>'"</p>

<p>"The phrase was irreverent, but the meaning reached me. He meant,
I take it: 'What have your long years here profited to Christ?' You
understood it so&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He said to me in the bazaar: 'What's your bag?'"</p>

<p>Mr. Blandhorn sighed heavily. For a few minutes Willard fancied he
had fallen asleep; but he lifted his head and, stretching his hand
out, laid it on his disciple's arm.</p>

<p>"The Lord chooses His messengers as it pleaseth Him: I have been
awaiting this for a long time." The young man felt his arm strongly
grasped. "Willard, you have been much to me all these years; but that
is nothing. All that matters is what you are to Christ...and the test
of that, at this moment, is your willingness to tell me the exact
truth, as you see it."</p>

<p>Willard Bent felt as if he were a very tall building, and his
heart a lift suddenly dropping down from the roof to the cellar. He
stirred nervously, releasing his arm, and cleared his throat; but he
made no answer. Mr. Blandhorn went on.</p>

<p>"Willard, this is the day of our accounting&mdash;of <i>my</i>
accounting. What have I done with my twenty-five years in Africa? I
might deceive myself as long as my wife lived&mdash;I cannot now." He
added, after a pause: "Thank heaven <i>she</i> never doubted..."</p>

<p>The younger man, with an inward shiver, remembered some of Mrs.
Blandhorn's confidences. "I suppose that's what marriage is," he
mused&mdash;"just a fog, like everything else."</p>

<p>Aloud he asked: "Then why should you doubt, sir?"</p>

<p>"Because my eyes have been opened&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By Harry Spink?" the disciple sneered.</p>

<p>The old man raised his hand. "'<i>Out of the mouths of
babes</i>&mdash;' But it is not Harry Spink who first set me thinking. He
has merely loosened my tongue. He has been the humble instrument
compelling me to exact the truth of you."</p>

<p>Again Bent felt his heart dropping down a long dark shaft. He
found no words at the bottom of it, and Mr. Blandhorn continued: "The
truth and the whole truth, Willard Bent. We have failed&mdash;<i>I</i>
have failed. We have not reached the souls of these people. Those who
still come to us do so from interested motives&mdash;or, even if I do some
few of them an injustice, if there is in some a blind yearning for
the light, is there one among them whose eyes we have really
opened?"</p>

<p>Willard Bent sat silent, looking up and down the long years, as if
to summon from the depths of memory some single incident that should
permit him to say there was.</p>

<p>"You don't answer, my poor young friend. Perhaps you have been
clearer-sighted; perhaps you saw long ago that we were not worthy of
our hire."</p>

<p>"I never thought that of you, sir!"</p>

<p>"Nor of yourself? For we have been one&mdash;or so I have believed&mdash;in
all our hopes and efforts. Have you been satisfied with <i>your</i>
results?"</p>

<p>Willard saw the dialectical trap, but some roused force in him
refused to evade it. "No, sir&mdash;God knows."</p>

<p>"Then I am answered. We have failed: Africa has beaten us. It has
always been my way, as you know, Willard, to face the truth
squarely," added the old man who had lived so long in dreams; "and
now that <i>this</i> truth has been borne in on me, painful as it is,
I must act on it...act in accordance with its discovery."</p>

<p>He drew a long breath, as if oppressed by the weight of his
resolution, and sat silent for a moment, fanning his face with a
corner of his white draperies.</p>

<p>"And here too&mdash;here too I must have your help, Willard," he began
presently, his hand again weighing on the young man's arm. "I will
tell you the conclusions I have reached; and you must answer me&mdash;as
you would answer your Maker."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The old man lowered his voice. "It is our lukewarmness,
Willard&mdash;it is nothing else. We have not witnessed for Christ as His
saints and martyrs witnessed for Him. What have we done to fix the
attention of these people, to convince them of our zeal, to overwhelm
them with the irresistibleness of the Truth? Answer me on your
word&mdash;what have we done?"</p>

<p>Willard pondered. "But the saints and martyrs...were persecuted,
sir."</p>

<p>"<i>Persecuted!</i> You have spoken the word I wanted."</p>

<p>"But the people here," Willard argued, "don't <i>want</i> to
persecute anybody. They're not fanatical unless you insult their
religion."</p>

<p>Mr. Blandhorn's grasp grew tighter. "Insult their religion! That's
it...tonight you find just the words..."</p>

<p>Willard felt his arm shake with the tremor that passed through the
other's body. "The saints and martyrs insulted the religion of the
heathen&mdash;they spat on it, Willard&mdash;they rushed into the temples and
knocked down the idols. They said to the heathen: 'Turn away your
faces from all your abominations'; and after the manner of men they
fought with beasts at Ephesus. What is the Church on earth called?
The Church Militant! You and I are soldiers of the Cross."</p>

<p>The missionary had risen and stood leaning against the parapet,
his right arm lifted as if he spoke from a pulpit. The music at the
wool-merchant's had ceased, but now and then, through the midnight
silence, there came an echo of ritual howls from the Potters'
Field.</p>

<p>Willard was still seated, his head thrown back against the
parapet, his eyes raised to Mr. Blandhorn. Following the gesture of
the missionary's lifted hand, from which the muslin fell back like
the sleeve of a surplice, the young man's gaze was led upward to
another white figure, hovering small and remote above their heads. It
was a muezzin leaning from his airy balcony to drop on the blue-gray
masses of the starlit city the cry: "Only Allah is great."</p>

<p>Mr. Blandhorn saw the white figure too, and stood facing it with
motionless raised arm.</p>

<p>"Only Christ is great, only Christ crucified!" he suddenly shouted
in Arabic with all the strength of his broad lungs.</p>

<p>The figure paused, and seemed to Willard to bend over, as if
peering down in their direction; but a moment later it had moved to
the other corner of the balcony, and the cry fell again on the
sleeping roofs:</p>

<p>"Allah&mdash;Allah&mdash;only Allah!"</p>

<p>"Christ&mdash;Christ&mdash;only Christ crucified!" roared Mr. Blandhorn,
exalted with wrath and shaking his fist at the aerial puppet.</p>

<p>The puppet once more paused and peered; then it moved on and
vanished behind the flank of the minaret.</p>

<p>The missionary, still towering with lifted arm, dusky-faced in the
starlight, seemed to Willard to have grown in majesty and stature.
But presently his arm fell and his head sank into his hands. The
young man knelt down, hiding his face also, and they prayed in
silence, side by side, while from the farther corners of the minaret,
less audibly, fell the infidel call.</p>

<p>Willard, his prayer ended, looked up, and saw that the old man's
garments were stirred as if by a ripple of air. But the air was quite
still, and the disciple perceived that the tremor of the muslin was
communicated to it by Mr. Blandhorn's body.</p>

<p>"He's trembling&mdash;trembling all over. He's afraid of something.
What's he afraid of?" And in the same breath Willard had answered his
own question: "He's afraid of what he's made up his mind to do."</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Two days later Willard Bent sat in the shade of a ruined tomb
outside the Gate of the Graves, and watched the people streaming in
to Eloued. It was the eve of the feast of the local saint, Sidi Oman,
who slept in a corner of the Great Mosque, under a segment of
green-tiled cupola, and was held in deep reverence by the country
people, many of whom belonged to the powerful fraternity founded in
his name.</p>

<p>The ruin stood on a hillock beyond the outer wall. From where the
missionary sat he overlooked the fortified gate and the irregular
expanse of the Potters' Field, with its primitive furnaces built into
hollows of the ground, between ridges shaded by stunted olive-trees.
On the farther side of the trail which the pilgrims followed on
entering the gate lay a sun-blistered expanse dotted with crooked
grave-stones, where hucksters traded, and the humblest caravans
camped in a waste of refuse, offal and stripped date-branches. A
cloud of dust, perpetually subsiding and gathering again, hid these
sordid details from Bent's eyes, but not from his imagination.</p>

<p>"Nowhere in Eloued," he thought with a shudder, "are the flies as
fat and blue as they are inside that gate."</p>

<p>But this was a fugitive reflection: his mind was wholly absorbed
in what had happened in the last forty-eight hours, and what was
likely to happen in the next.</p>

<p>"To think," he mused, "that after ten years I don't really know
him...A labourer in the Lord's vineyard&mdash;shows how much good I
am!"</p>

<p>His thoughts were moody and oppressed with fear. Never, since his
first meeting with Mr. Blandhorn, had he pondered so deeply the
problem of his superior's character. He tried to deduce from the past
some inference as to what Mr. Blandhorn was likely to do next; but,
as far as he knew, there was nothing in the old man's previous
history resembling the midnight scene on the Mission terrace.</p>

<p>That scene had already had its repercussion.</p>

<p>On the following morning, Willard, drifting as usual about the
bazaar, had met a friendly French official, who, taking him aside,
had told him there were strange reports abroad&mdash;which he hoped Mr.
Bent would be able to deny...In short, as it had never been Mr.
Blandhorn's policy to offend the native population, or insult their
religion, the Administration was confident that...</p>

<p>Surprised by Willard's silence, and visibly annoyed at being
obliged to pursue the subject, the friendly official, growing graver,
had then asked what had really occurred; and, on Willard's replying,
had charged him with an earnest recommendation to his superior&mdash;a
warning, if necessary&mdash;that the government would not, under any
circumstances, tolerate a repetition..."But I daresay it was the
heat?" he concluded; and Willard weakly acquiesced.</p>

<p>He was ashamed now of having done so; yet, after all, how did he
know it was not the heat? A heavy sanguine man like Mr. Blandhorn
would probably never quite accustom himself to the long strain of the
African summer. "Or his wife's death&mdash;" he had murmured to the
sympathetic official, who smiled with relief at the suggestion.</p>

<p>And now he sat overlooking the enigmatic city, and asking himself
again what he really knew of his superior. Mr. Blandhorn had come to
Eloued as a young man, extremely poor, and dependent on the pittance
which the Missionary Society at that time gave to its
representatives. To ingratiate himself among the people (the
expression was his own), and also to earn a few pesetas, he had
worked as a carpenter in the bazaar, first in the soukh of the
ploughshares and then in that of the cabinet-makers. His skill in
carpentry had not been great, for his large eloquent hands were meant
to wave from a pulpit, and not to use the adze or the chisel; but he
had picked up a little Arabic (Willard always marvelled that it
remained so little), and had made many acquaintances&mdash;and, as he
thought, some converts. At any rate, no one, either then or later,
appeared to wish him ill, and during the massacre his house had been
respected, and the insurgents had even winked at the aid he had
courageously given to the French.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;he had certainly been courageous. There was in him, in spite
of his weaknesses and his vacillations, a streak of moral heroism
that perhaps only waited its hour...But hitherto his principle had
always been that the missionary must win converts by kindness, by
tolerance, and by the example of a blameless life.</p>

<p>Could it really be Harry Spink's question that had shaken him in
this belief? Or was it the long-accumulated sense of inefficiency
that so often weighed on his disciple? Or was it simply the call&mdash;did
it just mean that their hour had come?</p>

<p>Shivering a little in spite of the heat, Willard pulled himself
together and descended into the city. He had been seized with a
sudden desire to know what Mr. Blandhorn was about, and avoiding the
crowd he hurried back by circuitous lanes to the Mission. On the way
he paused at a certain corner and looked into a court full of the
murmur of water. Beyond it was an arcade detached against depths of
shadow, in which a few lights glimmered. White figures, all facing
one way, crouched and touched their foreheads to the tiles, the soles
of their bare feet, wet with recent ablutions, turning up as their
bodies swayed forward. Willard caught the scowl of a beggar on the
threshold, and hurried past the forbidden scene.</p>

<p>He found Mr. Blandhorn in the meeting-room, tying up Ayoub's
head.</p>

<p>"I do it awkwardly," the missionary mumbled, a safety-pin between
his teeth. "Alas, my hands are not <i>hers</i>."</p>

<p>"What's he done to himself?" Willard growled; and above the
bandaged head Mr. Blandhorn's expressive eyebrows answered.</p>

<p>There was a dark stain on the back of Ayoub's faded shirt, and
another on the blue scarf he wore about his head.</p>

<p>"Ugh&mdash;it's like cats slinking back after a gutter-fight," the
young man muttered.</p>

<p>Ayoub wound his scarf over the bandages, shambled back to the
doorway, and squatted down to watch the fig-tree.</p>

<p>The missionaries looked at each other across the empty room.</p>

<p>"What's the use, sir?" was on Willard's lips; but instead of
speaking he threw himself down on the divan. There was to be no
prayer-meeting that afternoon, and the two men sat silent, gazing at
the back of Ayoub's head. A smell of disinfectants hung in the heavy
air...</p>

<p>"Where's Myriem?" Willard asked, to say something.</p>

<p>"I believe she had a ceremony of some sort...a family
affair..."</p>

<p>"A circumcision, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Mr. Blandhorn did not answer, and Willard was sorry he had made
the suggestion. It would simply serve as another reminder of their
failure...</p>

<p>He stole a furtive glance at Mr. Blandhorn, nervously wondering
if the time had come to speak of the French official's warning. He
had put off doing so, half-hoping it would not be necessary. The old
man seemed so calm, so like his usual self, that it might be wiser to
let the matter drop. Perhaps he had already forgotten the scene on
the terrace; or perhaps he thought he had sufficiently witnessed for
the Lord in shouting his insult to the muezzin. But Willard did not
really believe this: he remembered the tremor which had shaken Mr.
Blandhorn after the challenge, and he felt sure it was not a
retrospective fear.</p>

<p>"Our friend Spink has been with me," said Mr. Blandhorn suddenly.
"He came in soon after you left."</p>

<p>"Ah? I'm sorry I missed him. I thought he'd gone, from his not
coming in yesterday."</p>

<p>"No; he leaves tomorrow morning for Mogador." Mr Blandhorn paused,
still absently staring at the back of Ayoub's neck; then he added: "I
have asked him to take you with him."</p>

<p>"To take me&mdash;Harry Spink? In his automobile?" Willard gasped. His
heart began to beat excitedly.</p>

<p>"Yes. You'll enjoy the ride. It's a long time since you've been
away, and you're looking a little pulled down."</p>

<p>"You're very kind, sir: so is Harry." He paused. "But I'd rather
not."</p>

<p>Mr. Blandhorn, turning slightly, examined him between half-dropped
lids.</p>

<p>"I have business for you&mdash;with the Consul," he said with a certain
sternness. "I don't suppose you will object&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not." There was another pause. "Could you tell
me&mdash;give me an idea&mdash;of what the business is, sir?"</p>

<p>It was Mr. Blandhorn's turn to appear perturbed. He coughed,
passed his hand once or twice over his beard, and again fixed his
gaze on Ayoub's inscrutable nape.</p>

<p>"I wish to send a letter to the Consul."</p>

<p>"A letter? If it's only a letter, couldn't Spink take it?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. I might also send it by post&mdash;if I cared to transmit
it in that manner. I presumed," added Mr. Blandhorn with threatening
brows, "that you would understand I had my reasons&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, in that case, of course, sir&mdash;" Willard hesitated, and then
spoke with a rush. "I saw Lieutenant Lourdenay in the bazaar
yesterday&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>When he had finished his tale Mr. Blandhorn meditated for a long
time in silence. At length he spoke in a calm voice. "And what did
you answer, Willard?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I said I'd tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing more?"</p>

<p>"No. Nothing."</p>

<p>"Very well. We'll talk of all this more fully...when you get back
from Mogador. Remember that Mr. Spink will be here before sunrise. I
advised him to get away as early as possible on account of the Feast
of Sidi Oman. It's always a poor day for foreigners to be seen about
the streets."</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>At a quarter before four on the morning of the Feast of Sidi Oman,
Willard Bent stood waiting at the door of the Mission.</p>

<p>He had taken leave of Mr. Blandhorn the previous night, and
stumbled down the dark stairs on bare feet, his bundle under his arm,
just as the sky began to whiten around the morning star.</p>

<p>The air was full of a mocking coolness which the first ray of the
sun would burn up; and a hush as deceptive lay on the city that was
so soon to blaze with religious frenzy. Ayoub lay curled up on his
doorstep like a dog, and old Myriem, presumably, was still stretched
on her mattress on the roof.</p>

<p>What a day for a flight across the desert in Harry's tough little
car! And after the hours of heat and dust and glare, how good, at
twilight, to see the cool welter of the Atlantic, a spent sun
dropping into it, and the rush of the stars...Dizzy with the vision,
Willard leaned against the door-post with closed eyes.</p>

<p>A subdued hoot aroused him, and he hurried out to the car, which
was quivering and growling at the nearest corner. The drummer nodded
a welcome, and they began to wind cautiously between sleeping animals
and huddled heaps of humanity till they reached the nearest gate.</p>

<p>On the waste land beyond the walls the people of the caravans were
already stirring, and pilgrims from the hills streaming across the
palmetto scrub under emblazoned banners. As the sun rose the air took
on a bright transparency in which distant objects became unnaturally
near and vivid, like pebbles seen through clear water: a little
turban-shaped tomb far off in the waste looked as lustrous as ivory,
and a tiled minaret in an angle of the walls seemed to be carved out
of turquoise. How Eloued lied to eyes looking back on it at
sunrise!</p>

<p>"Something wrong," said Harry Spink, putting on the brake and
stopping in the thin shade of a cork-tree. They got out and Willard
leaned against the tree and gazed at the red walls of Eloued. They
were already about two miles from the town, and all around them was
the wilderness. Spink shoved his head into the bonnet, screwed and
greased and hammered, and finally wiped his hands on a black rag and
called out: "I thought so&mdash;. Jump in!"</p>

<p>Willard did not move.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, old man. She's all right, I tell you. It was just the
carburettor."</p>

<p>The missionary fumbled under his draperies and pulled out Mr.
Blandhorn's letter.</p>

<p>"Will you see that the Consul gets this tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Will I&mdash;what the hell's the matter, Willard?" Spink dropped his
rag and stared.</p>

<p>"I'm not coming. I never meant to."</p>

<p>The young men exchanged a long look.</p>

<p>"It's no time to leave Mr. Blandhorn&mdash;a day like this," Willard
continued, moistening his dry lips.</p>

<p>Spink shrugged, and sounded a faint whistle. "Queer&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"What's queer?"</p>

<p>"He said just the same thing to me about <i>you</i>&mdash;wanted to get
you out of Eloued on account of the goings on today. He said you'd
been rather worked up lately about religious matters, and might do
something rash that would get you both into trouble."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;" Willard murmured.</p>

<p>"And I believe you might, you know&mdash;you look sorter funny."
Willard laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, come along," his friend urged, disappointed.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry&mdash;I can't. I had to come this far so that he wouldn't
know. But now I've got to go back. Of course what he told you was
just a joke&mdash;but I must be there today to see that nobody bothers
him."</p>

<p>Spink scanned his companion's face with friendly flippant eyes.
"Well, I give up&mdash;. What's the <i>use</i>, when he don't want
you?&mdash;Say," he broke off, "what's the truth of that story about the
old man's having insulted a marabout in a mosque night before last?
It was all over the bazaar&mdash;"</p>

<p>Willard felt himself turn pale. "Not a marabout. It was&mdash;where did
you hear it?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"All over&mdash;the way you hear stories in these places."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it's not true." Willard lifted his bundle from the motor
and tucked it under his arm. "I'm sorry, Harry&mdash;I've got to go back,"
he repeated.</p>

<p>"What? The Call, eh?" The sneer died on Spink's lips, and he held
out his hand. "Well, I'm sorry too. So long." He turned the crank,
scrambled into his seat, and cried back over his shoulder: "What's
the <i>use</i>, when he don't want you?"</p>

<p>Willard was already labouring home across the plain.</p>

<hr align="center" width="15%">
<p>After struggling along for half an hour in the sand he crawled
under the shade of an abandoned well and sat down to ponder. Two
courses were open to him, and he had not yet been able to decide
between them. His first impulse was to go straight to the Mission,
and present himself to Mr. Blandhorn. He felt sure, from what Spink
had told him, that the old missionary had sent him away purposely,
and the fact seemed to confirm his apprehensions. If Mr. Blandhorn
wanted him away, it was not through any fear of his imprudence, but
to be free from his restraining influence. But what act did the old
man contemplate, in which he feared to involve his disciple? And if
he were really resolved on some rash measure, might not Willard's
unauthorized return merely serve to exasperate this resolve, and
hasten whatever action he had planned?</p>

<p>The other step the young man had in mind was to go secretly to the
French Administration, and there drop a hint of what he feared. It
was the course his sober judgment commended. The echo of Spink's
"What's the use?" was in his ears: it was the expression of his own
secret doubt. What <i>was</i> the use? If dying could bring any of
these darkened souls to the light...well, that would have been
different. But what least sign was there that it would do anything
but rouse their sleeping blood-lust?</p>

<p>Willard was oppressed by the thought that had always lurked
beneath his other doubts. They talked, he and Mr. Blandhorn, of the
poor ignorant heathen&mdash;but were not they themselves equally ignorant
in everything that concerned the heathen? What did they know of these
people, of their antecedents, the origin of their beliefs and
superstitions, the meaning of their habits and passions and
precautions? Mr. Blandhorn seemed never to have been troubled by this
question, but it had weighed on Willard ever since he had come across
a quiet French ethnologist who was studying the tribes of the Middle
Atlas. Two or three talks with this traveller&mdash;or listenings to
him&mdash;had shown Willard the extent of his own ignorance. He would have
liked to borrow books, to read, to study; but he knew little French
and no German, and he felt confusedly that there was in him no soil
sufficiently prepared for facts so overwhelmingly new to root in
it...And the heat lay on him, and the little semblance of his
missionary duties deluded him...and he drifted...</p>

<p>As for Mr. Blandhorn, he never read anything but the Scriptures, a
volume of his own sermons (printed by subscription, to commemorate
his departure for Morocco), and&mdash;occasionally&mdash;a back number of the
missionary journal that arrived at Eloued at long intervals, in thick
mouldy batches, Consequently no doubts disturbed him, and Willard
felt the hopelessness of grappling with an ignorance so much deeper
and denser than his own. Whichever way his mind turned, it seemed to
bring up against the blank wall of Harry Spink's; "What's the
use?"</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>He slipped through the crowds in the congested gateway, and made
straight for the Mission. He had decided to go to the French
Administration, but he wanted first to find out from the servants
what Mr. Blandhorn was doing, and what his state of mind appeared to
be.</p>

<p>The Mission door was locked, but Willard was not surprised; he
knew the precaution was sometimes taken on feast days, though seldom
so early. He rang, and waited impatiently for Myriem's old face in
the crack; but no one came, and below his breath he cursed her with
expurgated curses.</p>

<p>"Ayoub&mdash;<i>Ayoub!</i>" he cried, rattling at the door; but still
no answer. Ayoub, apparently, was off too. Willard rang the bell
again, giving the three long pulls of the "emergency call"; it was
the summons which always roused Mr. Blandhorn. But no one came.</p>

<p>Willard shook and pounded, and hung on the bell till it tinkled
its life out in a squeak...but all in vain. The house was empty: Mr.
Blandhorn was evidently out with the others.</p>

<p>Disconcerted, the young man turned, and plunged into the red clay
purlieus behind the Mission. He entered a mud-hut where an emaciated
dog, dozing on the threshold, lifted a recognizing lid, and let him
by. It was the house of Ahmed's father, the water-carrier, and
Willard knew it would be empty at that hour.</p>

<p>A few minutes later there emerged into the crowded streets a young
American dressed in a black coat of vaguely clerical cut, with a soft
felt hat shading his flushed cheek-bones, and a bead running up and
down his nervous throat.</p>

<p>The bazaar was already full of a deep holiday rumour, like the
rattle of wind in the palm-tops. The young man in the clerical coat,
sharply examined as he passed by hundreds of long Arab eyes, slipped
into the lanes behind the soukhs, and by circuitous passages gained
the neighbourhood of the Great Mosque. His heart was hammering
against his black coat, and under the buzz in his brain there boomed
out insistently the old question: "What's the use?"</p>

<p>Suddenly, near the fountain that faced one of the doors of the
Great Mosque, he saw the figure of a man dressed like himself. The
eyes of the two men met across the crowd, and Willard pushed his way
to Mr. Blandhorn's side.</p>

<p>"Sir, why did you&mdash;why are you&mdash;? I'm back&mdash;I couldn't help it,"
he gasped out disconnectedly.</p>

<p>He had expected a vehement rebuke; but the old missionary only
smiled on him sadly. "It was noble of you, Willard...I understand..."
He looked at the young man's coat. "We had the same
thought&mdash;again&mdash;at the same hour." He paused, and drew Willard into
the empty passage of a ruined building behind the fountain. "But
what's the use,&mdash;what's the use?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The blood rushed to the young man's forehead. "Ah&mdash;then you feel
it too?"</p>

<p>Mr. Blandhorn continued, grasping his arm: "I've been out&mdash;in this
dress&mdash;ever since you left; I've hung about the doors of the
Medersas, I've walked up to the very threshold of the Mosque, I've
leaned against the wall of Sidi Oman's shrine; once the police warned
me, and I pretended to go away...but I came back...I pushed up
closer...I stood in the doorway of the Mosque, and they saw me...the
people inside saw me...and no one touched me...I'm too
harmless...<i>they don't believe in me!</i>"</p>

<p>He broke off, and under his struggling eyebrows Willard saw the
tears on his old lids.</p>

<p>The young man gathered courage. "But don't you see, sir, that
that's the reason it's no use? We don't understand them any more than
they do us; they know it, and all our witnessing for Christ will make
no difference."</p>

<p>Mr. Blandhorn looked at him sternly. "Young man, no Christian has
the right to say that."</p>

<p>Willard ignored the rebuke. "Come home, sir, come home...it's no
use..."</p>

<p>"It was because I foresaw you would take this view that I sent you
to Mogador. Since I was right," exclaimed Mr. Blandhorn, facing round
on him fiercely, "how is it you have disobeyed me and come back?"</p>

<p>Willard was looking at him with new eyes. All his majesty seemed
to have fallen from him with his Arab draperies. How short and heavy
and weak he looked in his scant European clothes! The coat, tightly
strained across the stomach, hung above it in loose wrinkles, and the
ill-fitting trousers revealed their wearer's impressive legs as
slightly bowed at the knees. This diminution in his physical prestige
was strangely moving to his disciple. What was there left, with that
gone&mdash;?</p>

<p>"Oh, do come home, sir," the young man groaned. "Of course they
don't care what we do&mdash;of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;" cried Mr. Blandhorn, suddenly dashing past him into the
open.</p>

<p>The rumour of the crowd had become a sort of roaring chant. Over
the thousands of bobbing heads that packed every cranny of the
streets leading to the space before the Mosque there ran the
mysterious sense of something new, invisible, but already imminent.
Then, with the strange Oriental elasticity, the immense throng
divided, and a new throng poured through it, headed by riders
ritually draped, and overhung with banners which seemed to be lifted
and floated aloft on the shouts of innumerable throats. It was the
Pasha of Eloued coming to pray at the tomb of Sidi Oman.</p>

<p>Into this mass Mr. Blandhorn plunged and disappeared, while
Willard Bent, for an endless minute, hung back in the shelter of the
passage, the old "What's the use?" in his ears.</p>

<p>A hand touched his sleeve, and a cracked voice echoed the
words.</p>

<p>"What's the use, master?" It was old Myriem, clutching him with
scared face and pulling out a limp djellabah from under her holiday
shawl.</p>

<p>"I saw you...Ahmed's father told me..." (How everything was known
in the bazaars!) "Here, put this on quick, and slip away. They won't
trouble you..."</p>

<p>"Oh, but they will&mdash;they <i>shall!</i>" roared Willard, in a voice
unknown to his own ears, as he flung off the old woman's hand and,
trampling on the djellabah in his flight, dashed into the crowd at
the spot where it had swallowed up his master.</p>

<p>They would&mdash;they <i>should!</i> No more doubting and weighing and
conjecturing! The sight of the weak unwieldy old man, so ignorant, so
defenceless and so convinced, disappearing alone into that red
furnace of fanaticism, swept from the disciple's mind every thought
but the single passion of devotion.</p>

<p><i>That he lay down his life for his friend</i>&mdash;If he couldn't
bring himself to believe in any other reason for what he was doing,
that one seemed suddenly to be enough...</p>

<p>The crowd let him through, still apparently indifferent to his
advance. Closer, closer he pushed to the doors of the Mosque,
struggling and elbowing through a mass of people so densely jammed
that the heat of their breathing was in his face, the rank taste of
their bodies on his parched lips&mdash;closer, closer, till a last effort
of his own thin body, which seemed a mere cage of ribs with a wild
heart dashing against it, brought him to the doorway of the Mosque,
where Mr. Blandhorn, his head thrown back, his arms crossed on his
chest, stood steadily facing the heathen multitude.</p>

<p>As Willard reached his side their glances met, and the old man,
glaring out under prophetic brows, whispered without moving his lips:
"Now&mdash;<i>now!</i>"</p>

<p>Willard took it as a signal to follow, he knew not where or why:
at that moment he had no wish to know.</p>

<p>Mr. Blandhorn, without waiting for an answer, had turned, and,
doubling on himself, sprung into the great court of the Mosque.
Willard breathlessly followed, the glitter of tiles and the blinding
sparkle of fountains in his dazzled eyes...</p>

<p>The court was almost empty, the few who had been praying having
shortened their devotions and joined the Pasha's train, which was
skirting the outer walls of the Mosque to reach the shrine of Sidi
Oman. Willard was conscious of a moment of detached reconnoitring:
once or twice, from the roof of a deserted college to which the
government architect had taken him, he had looked down furtively on
the forbidden scene, and his sense of direction told him that the
black figure speeding across the blazing mirror of wet tiles was
making for the hall where the Koran was expounded to students.</p>

<p>Even now, as he followed, through the impending sense of something
dangerous and tremendous he had the feeling that after all perhaps no
one would bother them, that all the effort of will pumped up by his
storming heart to his lucid brain might conceivably end in some
pitiful anti-climax in the French Administration offices.</p>

<p>"They'll treat us like whipped puppies&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mr. Blandhorn had reached the school, had disappeared under
its shadowy arcade, and emerged again into the blaze of sunlight,
clutching a great parchment Koran.</p>

<p>"Ah," thought Willard, "<i>now&mdash;!</i>"</p>

<p>He found himself standing at the missionary's side, so close that
they must have made one black blot against the white-hot quiver of
tiles. Mr. Blandhorn lifted up the Book and spoke.</p>

<p>"The God whom ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you," he
cried in halting Arabic.</p>

<p>A deep murmur came from the turbaned figures gathered under the
arcade of the Mosque. Swarthy faces lowered, eyes gleamed like agate,
teeth blazed under snarling lips; but the group stood motionless,
holding back, visibly restrained by the menace of the long arm of the
Administration.</p>

<p>"Him declare I unto you&mdash;Christ crucified!" cried Mr.
Blandhorn.</p>

<p>An old man, detaching himself from the group, advanced across the
tiles and laid his hand on the missionary's arm. Willard recognized
the Cadi of the Mosque.</p>

<p>"You must restore the Book," the Cadi said gravely to Mr.
Blandhorn, "and leave this court immediately; if not&mdash;"</p>

<p>He held out his hand to take the Koran. Mr. Blandhorn, in a flash,
dodged the restraining arm, and, with a strange new elasticity of his
cumbrous body, rolling and bouncing across the court between the
dazed spectators, gained the gateway opening on the market-place
behind the Mosque. The centre of the great dusty space was at the
moment almost deserted. Mr. Blandhorn sprang forward, the Koran
clutched to him, Willard panting at his heels, and the turbaned crowd
after them, menacing but still visibly restrained.</p>

<p>In the middle of the square Mr. Blandhorn halted, faced about and
lifted the Koran high above his head. Willard, rigid at his side, was
obliquely conscious of the gesture, and at the same time aware that
the free space about them was rapidly diminishing under the mounting
tide of people swarming in from every quarter. The faces closest were
no longer the gravely wrathful countenances of the Mosque, but lean
fanatical masks of pilgrims, beggars, wandering "saints" and
miracle-makers, and dark tribesmen of the hills careless of their
creed but hot to join in the halloo against the hated stranger. Far
off in the throng, bobbing like a float on the fierce sea of turbans,
Willard saw the round brown face of a native officer frantically
fighting his way through. Now and then the face bobbed nearer, and
now and then a tug of the tide rolled it back.</p>

<p>Willard felt Mr. Blandhorn's touch on his arm.</p>

<p>"You're with me&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>The old man's voice sank and broke. "Say a word to...strengthen
me...I can't find any...Willard," he whispered.</p>

<p>Willard's brain was a blank. But against the blank a phrase
suddenly flashed out in letters of fire, and he turned and spoke it
to his master. "<i>Say among the heathen that the Lord
reigneth.</i>"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;-." Mr. Blandhorn, with a gasp, drew himself to his full
height and hurled the Koran down at his feet in the dung-strown
dust.</p>

<p>"Him, Him declare I unto you&mdash;Christ crucified!" he thundered: and
to Willard, in a fierce aside: "Now spit!"</p>

<p>Dazed a moment, the young man stood uncertain; then he saw the old
missionary draw back a step, bend forward, and deliberately spit upon
the sacred pages.</p>

<p>"This...is abominable..." the disciple thought; and, sucking up
the last drop of saliva from his dry throat, he also bent and
spat.</p>

<p>"Now trample&mdash;<i>trample!</i>" commanded Mr. Blandhorn, his arms
stretched out, towering black and immense, as if crucified against
the flaming sky; and his foot came down on the polluted Book.</p>

<p>Willard, seized with the communicative frenzy, fell on his knees,
tearing at the pages, and scattering them about him, smirched and
defiled in the dust.</p>

<p>"Spit&mdash;spit! Trample&mdash;trample!...Christ! I see the heavens
opened!" shrieked the old missionary, covering his eyes with his
hands. But what he said next was lost to his disciple in the rising
roar of the mob which had closed in on them. Far off, Willard caught
a glimpse of the native officer's bobbing head, and then of
Lieutenant Lourdenay's scared face. But a moment later he had veiled
his own face from the sight of the struggle at his side. Mr.
Blandhorn had fallen on his knees, and Willard heard him cry out
once: "Sadie&mdash;<i>Sadie!</i>" It was Mrs. Blandhorn's name.</p>

<p>Then the young man was himself borne down, and darkness descended
on him. Through it he felt the sting of separate pangs indescribable,
melting at last into a general mist of pain. He remembered Stephen,
and thought: "Now they're stoning me&mdash;" and tried to struggle up and
reach out to Mr. Blandhorn...</p>

<p>But the market-place seemed suddenly empty, as though the throng
of their assailants had been demons of the desert, the thin spirits
of evil that dance on the noonday heat. Now the dusk seemed to have
dispersed them, and Willard looked up and saw a quiet star above a
wall, and heard the cry of the muezzin dropping down from a near-by
minaret: "Allah&mdash;Allah&mdash;only Allah is great!"</p>

<p>Willard closed his eyes, and in his great weakness felt the tears
run down between his lids. A hand wiped them away, and he looked
again, and saw the face of Harry Spink stooping over him.</p>

<p>He supposed it was a dream-Spink, and smiled a little, and the
dream smiled back.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" Willard wondered to himself; and the dream-Spink
answered: "In the hospital, you infernal fool. I got back too
late&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You came back&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Lucky I did&mdash;I I saw this morning you were off your
base."</p>

<p>Willard, for a long time, lay still. Impressions reached him
slowly, and he had to deal with them one by one, like a puzzled
child.</p>

<p>At length he said: "Mr. Blandhorn&mdash;?" Spink bent his head, and his
voice was grave in the twilight.</p>

<p>"They did for him in no time; I guess his heart was weak. I don't
think he suffered. Anyhow, if he did he wasn't sorry; I know, because
I saw his face before they buried him...Now you lie still, and I'll
get you out of this tomorrow," he commanded, waving a fly-cloth above
Willard's sunken head.</p>

<h2><a name="s5"></a>THE TEMPERATE ZONE</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>"Travelling, sir," a curt parlour-maid announced from Mrs. Donald
Paul's threshold in Kensington; adding, as young Willis French's
glance slipped over her shoulder down a narrow and somewhat
conventional perspective of white panelling and black prints: "If
there's any message you'd like to write"&mdash;</p>

<p>He did not know if there were or not; but he instantly saw that
his hesitation would hold the house-door open a minute longer, and
thus give him more time to stamp on his memory the details of the
cramped London hall, beyond which there seemed no present hope of
penetrating.</p>

<p>"Could you tell me where?" he asked, in a tone implying that the
question of his having something to write might be determined by the
nature of the answer.</p>

<p>The parlour-maid scrutinized him more carefully. "Not exactly,
sir: Mr. and Mrs. Paul are away motoring, and I believe they're to
cross over to the continent in a day or two." She seemed to have
gathered confidence from another look at him, and he was glad he had
waited to unpack his town clothes, instead of rushing, as he had
first thought of doing, straight from the steamer train to the house.
"If it's for something important, I could give you the address," she
finally condescended, apparently reassured by her inspection.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> important," said the young man almost solemnly; and
she handed him a sheet of gold-monogrammed note-paper across which
was tumbled, in large loose characters: "Hotel Nouveau Luxe,
Paris."</p>

<p>The unexpectedness of the address left Willis French staring.
There was nothing to excite surprise in the fact of the Donald Pauls
having gone to Paris; or even in their having gone there in their
motor; but that they should be lodged at the Nouveau Luxe seemed to
sap the very base of probability.</p>

<p>"Are you sure they're staying there?"</p>

<p>To the parlour-maid, at this point, it evidently began to look as
if, in spite of his reassuring clothes, the caller might have designs
on the umbrellas.</p>

<p>"I couldn't say, sir. It's the address, sir," she returned,
adroitly taking her precautions about the door.</p>

<p>These were not lost on the visitor, who, both to tranquillize her
and to gain time, turned back toward the quiet Kensington street and
stood gazing doubtfully up and down its uneventful length.</p>

<p>All things considered, he had no cause to regret the turn the
affair had taken; the only regret he allowed himself was that of not
being able instantly to cross the threshold hallowed by his young
enthusiasm. But even that privilege might soon be his; and meanwhile
he was to have the unforeseen good luck of following Mrs. Donald Paul
to Paris. His business in coming to Europe had been simply and solely
to see the Donald Pauls; and had they been in London he would have
been obliged, their conference over, to return at once to New York,
whence he had been sent, at his publisher's expense, to obtain from
Mrs. Paul certain details necessary for the completion of his book:
<i>The Art of Horace Fingall</i>. And now, by a turn of what he
fondly called his luck&mdash;as if no one else's had ever been quite as
rare&mdash;he found his vacation prolonged, and his prospect of enjoyment
increased, by the failure to meet the lady in London.</p>

<p>Willis French had more than once had occasion to remark that he
owed some of his luckiest moments to his failures. He had tried his
hand at several of the arts, only to find, in each case, the same
impassable gulf between vision and execution; but his ill-success,
which he always promptly recognized, had left him leisure to note and
enjoy all the incidental compensations of the attempt. And how great
some of these compensations were, he had never more keenly felt than
on the day when two of the greatest came back to him merged in one
glorious opportunity.</p>

<p>It was probable, for example, that if he had drawn a directer
profit from his months of study in a certain famous Parisian
<i>atelier</i>, his labours would have left him less time in which to
observe and study Horace Fingall, on the days when the great painter
made his round among the students; just as, if he had written better
poetry, Mrs. Morland, with whom his old friend Lady Brankhurst had
once contrived to have him spend a Sunday in the country, might have
given him, during their long confidential talk, less of her sweet
compassion and her bracing wisdom. Both Horace Fingall and Emily
Morland had, professionally speaking, discouraged their young
disciple; the one had said "don't write" as decidedly as the other
had said "don't paint"; but both had let him feel that interesting
failures may be worth more in the end than dull successes, and that
there is range enough for the artistic sensibilities outside the
region of production. The fact of the young man's taking their
criticism without flinching (as he himself had been thankfully aware
of doing) no doubt increased their liking, and thus let him farther
into their intimacy. The insight into two such natures seemed, even
at the moment, to outweigh any personal success within his reach; and
as time removed him from the experience he had less and less occasion
to question the completeness of the compensation.</p>

<p>Since then, as it happened, his two great initiators had died
within a few months of each other, Emily Morland prematurely, and at
the moment when her exquisite art was gaining new warmth from the
personal happiness at last opening to her, and Horace Fingall in his
late golden prime, when his genius also seemed to be winged for new
flights. Except for the nearness of the two death dates, there was
nothing to bring together in the public mind the figures of the
painter and the poet, and Willis French's two experiences remained
associated in his thoughts only because they had been the greatest
revelations of temperament he had ever known. No one but Emily
Morland had ever renewed in him that sense of being in the presence
of greatness that he had first felt on meeting Horace Fingall. He had
often wondered if the only two beings to whom he owed this emotion
had ever known each other, and he had concluded that, even in this
day of universal meetings, it was unlikely. Fingall, after leaving
the United States for Paris toward his fortieth year, had never
absented himself from France except on short occasional visits to his
native country; and Mrs. Morland, when she at last broke away from
her depressing isolation in a Staffordshire parsonage, and set up her
own house in London, had been drawn from there only by one or two
holiday journeys in Italy. Nothing, moreover, could have been more
unlike than the mental quality and the general attitude of the two
artists. The only point of resemblance between them lay in the effect
they produced of the divine emanation of genius. Willis French's
speculations as to the result of a meeting between them had always
resulted in the belief that they would not have got on. The two
emanations would have neutralized each other, and he suspected that
both natures lacked the complementary qualities which might have
bridged the gulf between them. And now chance had after all linked
their names before posterity, through the fact that the widow of the
one had married the man who had been betrothed to the other!...</p>

<p>French's brief glimpses of Fingall and Mrs. Morland had left in
him an intense curiosity to know something more of their personal
history, and when his publisher had suggested his writing a book on
the painter his first thought had been that here was an occasion to
obtain the desired light, and to obtain it, at one stroke, through
the woman who had been the preponderating influence in Fingall's art,
and the man for whom Emily Morland had written her greatest
poems.</p>

<p>That Donald Paul should have met and married the widow of Horace
Fingall was one of the facts on which young French's imagination had
always most appreciatively dwelt. It was strange indeed that these
two custodians of great memories, for both of whom any other marriage
would have been a derogation, should have found the one way of
remaining on the heights; and it was almost equally strange that
their inspiration should turn out to be Willis French's
opportunity!</p>

<p>At the very outset, the wonder of it was brought home to him by
his having to ask for Mrs. Paul at what had once been Mrs. Morland's
house. Mrs. Morland had of course bequeathed the house to Donald
Paul; and equally of course it was there that, on his marriage to
Mrs. Fingall, Donald Paul had taken his wife. If that wife had been
any other, the thought would have been one to shrink from; but to
French's mind no threshold was too sacred for the feet of Horace
Fingall's widow.</p>

<p>Musing on these things as he glanced up and down the quiet street,
the young man, with his sharp professional instinct for missing no
chance that delay might cancel, wondered how, before turning from the
door, he might get a glimpse of the house which was still&mdash;which, in
spite of everything, would always be&mdash;Emily Morland's.</p>

<p>"You were not thinking of looking at the house, sir?"</p>

<p>French turned back with a start of joy. "Why, yes&mdash;I was!" he said
instantly.</p>

<p>The parlour-maid opened the door a little wider. "Of course,
properly speaking, you should have a card from the agent; but Mrs.
Paul <i>did</i> say, if anyone was <i>very</i> anxious&mdash;May I ask,
sir, if you know Mrs. Paul?"</p>

<p>The young man lowered his voice reverentially to answer: "No; but
I knew Mrs. Morland."</p>

<p>The parlour-maid looked as if he had misunderstood her question.
After a moment's thought she replied: "I don't think I recall the
name."</p>

<p>They gazed at each other across incalculable distances, and Willis
French found no reply. "What on earth can she suppose I want to see
the house for?" he could only wonder.</p>

<p>Her next question told him. "If it's very urgent, sir&mdash;" another
glance at the cut of his coat seemed to strengthen her, and she moved
back far enough to let him get a foot across the threshold. "Would it
be to hire or to buy?"</p>

<p>Again they stared at each other till French saw his own wonder
reflected in the servant's doubtful face; then the truth came to him
in a rush. The house was not being shown to him because it had once
been Emily Morland's and he had been recognized as a pilgrim to the
shrine of genius, but because it was Mrs. Donald Paul's and he had
been taken for a possible purchaser!</p>

<p>All his disenchantment rose to his lips; but it was checked there
by the leap of prudence. He saw that if he showed his wonder he might
lose his chance.</p>

<p>"Oh, it would be to buy!" he said; for, though the mere thought of
hiring was a desecration, few things would have seemed more possible
to him, had his fortune been on the scale of his enthusiasm, than to
become the permanent custodian of the house.</p>

<p>The feeling threw such conviction into his words that the
parlour-maid yielded another step.</p>

<p>"The drawing-room is this way," she said as he bared his head.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>It was odd how, as he paced up and down the Embankment late that
evening, musing over the vision vouchsafed him, one detail continued
to detach itself with discordant sharpness from the harmonious
blur.</p>

<p>The parlour-maid who had never heard of Mrs. Morland, and who
consequently could not know that the house had ever been hers, had
naturally enough explained it to him in terms of its new owners'
habits. French's imagination had so promptly anticipated this that he
had, almost without a shock, heard Mrs. Morland's library described
as "the gentleman's study," and marked how an upstairs sitting-room
with faded Venetian furniture and rows of old books in golden-brown
calf had been turned, by the intrusion of a large pink toilet-table,
into "the lady's dressing-room, sir." It did not offend him that the
dwelling should he used as suited the convenience of the persons who
lived in it; he was never for expecting life to stop, and the
Historic House which has been turned into a show had always seemed to
him as dead as a blown egg. He had small patience with the kind of
reverence which treats fine things as if their fineness made them
useless. Nothing, he thought, was too fine for natural uses, nothing
in life too good for life; he liked the absent and unknown Donald
Pauls the better for living naturally in this house which had come to
them naturally, and not shrinking into the mere keepers of a shrine.
But he had winced at just one thing: at seeing there, on the
writing-table which had once been Emily Morland's, and must still, he
quickly noted, be much as she had left it&mdash;at seeing there, among
pens and pencils and ink-stained paper-cutters, halfway between a
lacquer cup full of elastic bands and a blotting-book with her
initials on it, one solitary object of irrelevant newness: an immense
expensively framed photograph of Fingall's picture of his wife.</p>

<p>The portrait&mdash;the famous first one, now in the Luxembourg&mdash;was so
beautiful, and so expressive of what lovers of Fingall's art most
loved in it, that Willis French was grieved to see it so indelicately
and almost insolently out of place. If ever a thing of beauty can
give offence, Mrs. Fingall's portrait on Emily Morland's
writing-table gave offence. Its presence there shook down all manner
of French's faiths. There was something shockingly crude in the way
it made the woman in possession triumph over the woman who was
gone.</p>

<p>It would have been different, he felt at once, if Mrs. Morland had
lived long enough to marry the man she loved; then the dead and the
living woman would have faced each other on an equality. But Mrs.
Morland, to secure her two brief years of happiness, had had to defy
conventions and endure affronts. When, breaking away from the unhappy
conditions of her married life, she had at last won London and
freedom, it was only to learn that the Reverend Ambrose Morland,
informed of her desire to remarry, and of his indisputable right to
divorce her, found himself, on religious grounds, unable to set her
free. From this situation she sought no sensational escape. Perhaps
because the man she loved was younger than herself, she chose to make
no open claim on him, to place no lien on his future; she simply let
it be known to their few nearest friends that he and she belonged to
each other as completely as a man and woman of active minds and
complex interests can ever belong to each other when such life as
they live together must be lived in secret. To a woman like Mrs.
Morland the situation could not be other than difficult and
unsatisfying. If her personal distinction saved her from social
slights it could not save her from social subserviences. Never once,
in the short course of her love-history, had she been able to declare
her happiness openly, or to let it reveal itself in her conduct; and
it seemed, as one considered her case, small solace to remember that
some of her most moving verse was the expression of that very
privation.</p>

<p>At last her husband's death had freed her, and her coming marriage
to Donald Paul been announced; but her own health had already failed,
and a few weeks later she too was dead, and Donald Paul lost in the
crowd about her grave, behind the Morland relations who, rather
generously as people thought, came up from Staffordshire for the
funeral of the woman who had brought scandal and glory to their
name.</p>

<p>So, tragically and inarticulately, Emily Morland's life had gone
out; and now, in the house where she and her lover had spent their
short secret hours, on the very table at which she had sat and
imperishably written down her love, he had put the portrait of the
other woman, her successor; the woman to whom had been given the one
great thing she had lacked...</p>

<p>Well, that was life too, French supposed: the ceaseless ruthless
turning of the wheel! If only&mdash;yes, here was where the real pang
lay&mdash;if only the supplanting face had not been so different from the
face supplanted! Standing there before Mrs. Fingall's image, how
could he not recall his first sight of Emily Morland, how not feel
again the sudden drop of all his expectations when the one woman he
had not noticed on entering Lady Brankhurst's drawing-room, the
sallow woman with dull hair and a dowdy dress, had turned out to be
his immortal? Afterward, of course, when she began to talk, and he
was let into the deep world of her eyes, her face became as
satisfying as some grave early sculpture which, the imagination once
touched by it, makes more finished graces trivial. But there remained
the fact that she was what is called plain, and that her successor
was beautiful; and it hurt him to see that perfect face, so
all-expressive and all-satisfying, in the very spot where Emily
Morland, to make her beauty visible, had had to clothe it in poetry.
What would she not have given, French wondered, just once to let her
face speak for her instead?</p>

<p>The sense of injustice was so strong in him that when he returned
to his hotel he went at once to his portmanteau and, pulling out Mrs.
Morland's last volume, sat down to reread the famous love-sonnets. It
was as if he wanted to make up to her for the slight of which he had
been the unwilling witness...</p>

<p>The next day, when he set out for France, his mood had changed.
After all, Mrs. Morland had had her compensations. She had been
inspired, which, on the whole, is more worth while than to inspire.
And then his own adventure was almost in his grasp; and he was at the
age when each moment seems to stretch out to the horizon.</p>

<p>The day was fine, and as he sat on the deck of the steamer
watching the white cliffs fade, the thought of Mrs. Morland was
displaced by the vision of her successor. He recalled the day when
Mrs. Fingall had first looked out at him from her husband's famous
portrait of her, so frail, so pale under the gloom and glory of her
hair, and he had been told how the sight of her had suddenly drawn
the painter's genius from its long eclipse. Fingall had found her
among the art students of one of the Parisian studios which he
fitfully inspected, had rescued her from financial difficulties and
married her within a few weeks of their meeting: French had had the
tale from Lady Brankhurst, who was an encyclopaedia of illustrious
biographies.</p>

<p>"Poor little Bessy Reck&mdash;a little American waif sent out from some
prairie burrow to 'learn art'&mdash;that was literally how she expressed
it! She hadn't a relation of her own, I believe: the people of the
place she came from had taken pity on her and scraped together enough
money for her passage and for two years of the Latin Quarter. After
that she was to live on the sale of her pictures! And suddenly she
met Fingall, and found out what she was really made for."</p>

<p>So far Lady Brankhurst had been satisfying, as she always was when
she trod on solid fact. But she never knew anything about her friends
except what had happened to them, and when questioned as to what Mrs.
Fingall was really like she became vague and slightly irritable.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, he transformed her, of course: for one thing he made
her do her hair differently. Imagine; she used to puff it out over
her forehead! And when we went to the studio she was always dressed
in the most marvellous Eastern things. Fingall drank cups and cups of
Turkish coffee, and she learned to make it herself&mdash;it <i>is</i>
better, of course, but so messy to make. The studio was full of
Siamese cats. It was somewhere over near the Luxembourg&mdash;very
picturesque, but one <i>did</i> smell the drains. I used always to
take my salts with me; and the stairs were pitch-black." That was
all.</p>

<p>But from her very omissions French had constructed the vision of
something too fine and imponderable not to escape Lady Brankhurst,
and had rejoiced in the thought that, of what must have been the most
complete of blisses, hardly anything was exposed to crude comment but
the stairs which led to it.</p>

<p>Of Donald Paul he had been able to learn even less, though Lady
Brankhurst had so many more facts to give. Donald Paul's life lay
open for everybody in London to read. He had been first a "dear boy,"
with a large and eminently respectable family connection, and then a
not especially rising young barrister, who occupied his briefless
leisure by occasionally writing things for the reviews. He had
written an article about Mrs. Morland, and when, soon afterward, he
happened to meet her, he had suddenly realized that he hadn't
understood her poetry in the least, and had told her so and written
another article&mdash;under her guidance, the malicious whispered, and
boundlessly enthusiastic, of course; people said it was that which
had made her fall in love with him. But Lady Brankhurst thought it
was more likely to have been his looks&mdash;with which French, on general
principles, was inclined to agree. "What sort of looks?" he asked.
"Oh, like an old picture, you know"; and at that shadowy stage of
development the image of Donald Paul had hung. French, in spite of an
extensive search, had not even been able to find out where the
fateful articles on Mrs. Morland's verse had been published; and
light on that point was one of the many lesser results he now hoped
for.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, settled in his chair on deck, he was so busy
elaborating his own picture of the couple he was hastening to that he
hardly noticed the slim figure of a traveller with a sallow keen face
and small dark beard who hovered near, as if for recognition.</p>

<p>"Andr Jolyesse&mdash;you don't remember me?" the gentleman at length
reminded him in beautifully correct English; and French woke to the
fact that it was of course Jolyesse, the eminent international
portrait painter, whose expensively gloved hand he was shaking.</p>

<p>"We crossed together on the <i>Gothic</i> the last time I went to
the States," Monsieur Jolyesse reminded him, "and you were so amiable
as to introduce me to several charming persons who added greatly to
the enjoyment of my visit."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," French assented; and seeing that the
painter was in need of a listener, the young man reluctantly lifted
his rugs from the next chair.</p>

<p>It was because Jolyesse, on the steamer, had been so shamelessly
in quest of an article that French, to escape his importunities, had
passed him on to the charming persons referred to; and if he again
hung about in this way, and recalled himself, it was doubtless for a
similarly shameless purpose. But French was more than ever steeled
against the celebrating of such art as that of Jolyesse; and, to cut
off a possible renewal of the request, he managed&mdash;in answer to a
question as to what he was doing with himself&mdash;to mention casually
that he had abandoned art criticism for the writing of books.</p>

<p>The portrait painter was far too polite to let his attention
visibly drop at this announcement; too polite, even, not to ask with
a show of interest if he might know the subject of the work Mr.
French was at the moment engaged on.</p>

<p>"Horace Fingall&mdash;<i>bigre!</i>" he murmured, as if the aridity of
the task impressed him while it provoked his pity.
"Fingall&mdash;Fingall&mdash;" he repeated, his incredulous face smilingly
turned to French, while he drew a cigarette from a gold case as flat
as an envelope.</p>

<p>French gave back the smile. It delighted him, it gave him a new
sense of the importance of his task, to know that Jolyesse, in spite
of Fingall's posthumous leap to fame, still took that view of him.
And then, with a start of wonder, the young man remembered that the
two men must have known each other, that they must have had at least
casual encounters in the crowded promiscuous life of the painters'
Paris. The possibility was so rich in humour that he was moved to
question his companion.</p>

<p>"You must have come across Fingall now and then, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Jolyesse shrugged his shoulders. "Not for years. He was a
savage&mdash;he had no sense of solidarity. And envious&mdash;!" The artist
waved the ringed hand that held his cigarette. "Could one help it if
one sold more pictures than he did? But it was gall and worm-wood to
him, poor devil. Of course he sells <i>now</i>&mdash;tremendously high, I
believe. But that's what happens: when an unsuccessful man dies, the
dealers seize on him and make him, a factitious reputation. Only it
doesn't last. You'd better make haste to finish your book; that sort
of celebrity collapses like a soap-bubble. Forgive me," he added,
with a touch of studied compunction, "for speaking in this way of
your compatriot. Fingall had aptitudes&mdash;immense, no doubt&mdash;but no
technique, and no sense of beauty; none whatever."</p>

<p>French, rejoicing, let the commentary flow on; he even felt the
need to stimulate its flow.</p>

<p>"But how about his portrait of his wife&mdash;you must know it?"</p>

<p>Jolyesse flung away his cigarette to lift his hands in protest.
"That consumptive witch in the Luxembourg? Ah, <i>mais non!</i> She
looks like a vegetarian vampire. <i>Voyez vous, si l'on a beaucoup
aim&eacute; les femmes</i>&mdash;" the painter's smile was evidently
intended to justify his championship of female loveliness. He puffed
away the subject with his cigarette smoke, and turned to glance down
the deck. "There&mdash;by Jove, that's what I call a handsome woman! Over
there, with the sable cloak and the brand new travelling-bags. A
honeymoon outfit, <i>hein?</i> If your poor Fingall had had the luck
to do <i>that</i> kind&mdash;! I'd like the chance myself."</p>

<p>French, following his glance, saw that it rested on a tall and
extremely elegant young woman who was just settling herself in a
deck-chair with the assistance of an attentive maid and a hovering
steward: A young man, of equal height and almost superior elegance,
strolled up to tuck a rug over her shining boot-tips before seating
himself at her side; and French had to own that, at least as a
moment's ornament, the lady was worth all the trouble spent on her.
She seemed, in truth, framed by nature to bloom from one of Monsieur
Jolyesse's canvases, so completely did she embody the kind of beauty
it was his mission to immortalize. It was annoying that eyes like
forest-pools and a mouth like a tropical flower should so fit into
that particular type; but then the object of Monsieur Jolyesse's
admiration had the air of wearing her features, like her clothes,
simply because they were the latest fashion, and not because they
were a part of her being. Her inner state was probably a much less
complicated affair than her lovely exterior: it was a state, French
guessed, of easy apathetic good-humour, galvanized by the occasional
need of a cigarette, and by a gentle enjoyment of her companion's
conversation. French had wondered, since his childhood, what the
Olympian lovers in fashion-plates found to say to each other. Now he
knew. They said (he strolled nearer to the couple to catch it): "Did
you wire about reserving a compartment?"; and "I haven't seen my
golf-clubs since we came on board": and "I do hope Marshall's brought
enough of that new stuff for my face,"&mdash;and lastly, after a dreamy
pause: "I <i>know</i> Gwen gave me a book to read when we started,
but I can't think where on earth I've put it."</p>

<p>It was odd too that, handsome and young as they still were (both
well on the warm side of forty), this striking couple were curiously
undefinably old-fashioned&mdash;in just the same way as Jolyesse's art.
They belonged, for all their up-to-date attire, to a period before
the triumph of the slack and the slouching: it was as if their
elegance had pined too long in the bud, and its belated flowering had
a tinge of staleness.</p>

<p>French mused on these things while he listened to Jolyesse's
guesses as to the class and nationality of the couple, and finally,
in answer to the insistent question: "But where do you think they
come from?" replied a little impatiently: "Oh, from the rue de la
Paix, of course!" He was tired of the subject, and of his companion,
and wanted to get back to his thoughts of Horace Fingall.</p>

<p>"Ah, I hope so&mdash;then I may run across them yet!" Jolyesse, as he
gathered up his bags, shot a last glance at the beauty. "I'll haunt
the dressmakers till I find her&mdash;she looks as if she spent most of
her time with them. And the young man evidently refuses her nothing.
You'll see, I'll have her in the next Salon!" He turned back to add:
"She might be a compatriot of yours. Women who look as if they came
out of the depths of history usually turn out to be from your newest
Territory. If you run across her, do say a good word for me. My full
lengths are fifty thousand francs now&mdash;to Americans."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>All that first evening in Paris the vision of his book grew and
grew in French's mind. Much as he loved the great city, nothing it
could give him was comparable, at that particular hour, to the
rapture of his complete withdrawal from it into the sanctuary of his
own thoughts. The very next day he was to see Horace Fingall's widow,
and perhaps to put his finger on the clue to the labyrinth: that
mysterious tormenting question of the relation between the creative
artist's personal experience and its ideal expression. He was to try
to guess how much of Mrs. Fingall, beside her features, had passed
into her husband's painting; and merely to ponder on that opportunity
was to plunge himself into the heart of his subject. Fingall's art
had at last received recognition, genuine from the few, but mainly,
no doubt, inspired by the motives to which Jolyesse had sneeringly
alluded; and, intolerable as it was to French to think that
snobbishness and cupidity were the chief elements in the general
acclamation of his idol, he could not forget that he owed to these
baser ingredients the chance to utter his own panegyric. It was
because the vulgar herd at last wanted to know what to say when it
heard Fingall mentioned that Willis French was to be allowed to tell
them; such was the base rubble the Temple of Fame was built of! Yes,
but future generations would enrich its face with lasting marbles;
and it was to be French's privilege to put the first slab in
place.</p>

<p>The young man, thus brooding, lost himself in the alluring and
perplexing alternatives of his plan. The particular way of dealing
with a man's art depended, of course, so much on its relation to his
private life, and on the chance of a real insight into that.
Fingall's life had been obdurately closed and aloof; would it be his
widow's, wish that it should remain so? Or would she understand that
any serious attempt to analyse so complex and individual an art must
be preceded by a reverent scrutiny of the artist's personality? Would
she, above all, understand how reverent French's scrutiny would be,
and consent, for the sake of her husband's glory, to guide and
enlighten it? Her attitude, of course, as he was nervously aware,
would greatly depend on his: on his finding the right words and the
convincing tone. He could almost have prayed for guidance, for some
supernatural light on what to say to her! It was late that night
when, turning from his open window above the throbbing city, he
murmured to himself: "I wonder what on earth we shall begin by saying
to each other?"</p>

<p>Her sitting-room at the Nouveau Luxe was empty when he was shown
into it the next day, though a friendly note had assured him that she
would be in by five. But he was not sorry she was late, for the room
had its secrets to reveal. The most conspicuous of these was a large
photograph of a handsome young man, in a frame which French instantly
recognized as the mate of the one he had noticed on Mrs. Morland's
writing-table. Well&mdash;it was natural, and rather charming, that the
happy couple should choose the same frame for each other's portraits,
and there was nothing offensive to Fingall's memory in the fact of
Donald Paul's picture being the most prominent object in his wife's
drawing-room.</p>

<p>Only&mdash;if this were indeed Donald Paul, where had French seen him
already? He was still questioning the lines of the pleasant
oft-repeated face when his answer entered the room in the shape of a
splendidly draped and feathered lady.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry! The dressmakers are such beasts&mdash;they've been
sticking pins in me ever since two o'clock." She held out her hand
with a click of bracelets slipping down to the slim wrist. "Donald!
Do come&mdash;it's Mr. French," she called back over her shoulder; and the
gentleman of the photograph came in after her.</p>

<p>The three stood looking at each other for an interval deeply
momentous to French, obviously less stirring to his hosts; then
Donald Paul said, in a fresh voice a good deal younger than his
ingenuous middle-aged face: "We've met somewhere before, surely.
Wasn't it the other day at Brighton&mdash;at the Metropole?"</p>

<p>His wife looked at him and smiled, wrinkling her perfect brows a
little in the effort to help his memory. "We go to so many hotels! I
think it was at the Regina at Harrogate." She appealed to their
visitor for corroboration.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it simply yesterday, on the Channel?" French suggested,
the words buzzing a little in his own ears; and Mrs. Paul instantly
remembered.</p>

<p>"Of course! How stupid of me!" Her random sweetness grew more
concentrated. "You were talking to a dark man with a beard&mdash;Andr
Jolyesse, wasn't it? I told my husband it was Jolyesse. How awfully
interesting that you should know him! Do sit down and let me give you
some tea while you tell us all about him."</p>

<p>French, as he took the cup from her hand, remembered that, a few
hours earlier, he had been wondering what he and she would first say
to each other.</p>

<hr align="center" width="15%">
<p>It was dark when he walked away from the blazing front of the
Nouveau Luxe. Mrs. Donald Paul had given him two generous hours, and
had filled them with talk of her first husband; yet as French turned
from the hotel he had the feeling that what he brought away with him
had hardly added a grain to his previous, knowledge of Horace
Fingall. It was perhaps because he was still too blankly
bewildered&mdash;or because he had not yet found the link between what had
been and what was&mdash;that he had been able to sift only so
infinitesimal a residue out of Mrs. Paul's abundance. And his first
duty, plainly, if he were ever to thread a way through the tangle,
was to readjust himself and try to see things from a different point
of view.</p>

<p>His one definite impression was that Mrs. Paul was very much
pleased that he should have come to Paris to see her, and acutely,
though artlessly, aware of the importance of his mission.
Artlessness, in fact, seemed her salient quality: there looked out of
her great Sphinx-eyes a consciousness as cloudless as a child's. But
one thing he speedily discovered: she was keenly alive to her first
husband's greatness. On that point French saw that she needed no
enlightenment. He was even surprised, sitting opposite to her in all
the blatancy of hotel mirrors and gilding, to catch on her lips the
echoes of so different a setting. But he gradually perceived that the
words she used had no meaning for her save, as it were, a symbolic
one: they were like the mysterious price-marks with which dealers
label their treasures. She knew that her husband had been proud and
isolated, that he had "painted only for himself" and had "simply
despised popularity"; but she rejoiced that he was now at last
receiving "the kind of recognition even he would have cared for"; and
when French, at this point, interposed, with an impulse of
self-vindication: "I didn't know that, as yet, much had been written
about him that he would have liked," she opened her fathomless eyes a
little wider, and answered: "Oh, but the dealers are simply fighting
for his things."</p>

<p>The shock was severe; but presently French rallied enough to
understand that she was not moved by a spirit of cupidity, but was
simply applying the only measure of greatness she knew. In Fingall's
lifetime she had learned her lesson, and no doubt repeated it
correctly&mdash;her conscientious desire for correctness was
disarming&mdash;but now that he was gone his teaching had got mixed with
other formulas, and she was serenely persuaded that, in any art, the
proof and corollary of greatness was to become a best seller. "Of
course he was his own worst enemy," she sighed. "Even when people
<i>came</i> to buy he managed to send them away discouraged. Whereas
now&mdash;!"</p>

<p>In the first chill of his disillusionment French thought for a
moment of flight. Mrs. Paul had promised him all the documentation he
required: she had met him more than half-way in her lavish fixing of
hours and offering of material. But everything in him shrank from
repeating the experience he had just been subjected to. What was the
use of seeing her again, even though her plans included a visit to
Fingall's former studio? She had told him nothing whatever about
Fingall, and she had told him only too much about herself. To do
that, she had not even had to open her beautiful lips. On his way to
her hotel he had stopped in at the Luxembourg, and filled his eyes
again with her famous image. Everything she was said to have done for
Fingall's genius seemed to burn in the depths of that quiet face. It
was like an inexhaustible reservoir of beauty, a still pool into
which the imagination could perpetually dip and draw up new treasure.
And now, side by side with the painter's vision of her, hung French's
own: the vision of the too-smiling beauty set in glasses and glitter,
preoccupied with dressmakers and theatre-stalls, and affirming her
husband's genius in terms of the auction room and the stock
exchange!</p>

<p>"Oh, hang it&mdash;what can she give me? I'll go straight back to New
York," the young man suddenly resolved. The resolve even carried him
precipitately back to his hotel; but on its threshold another thought
arrested him. Horace Fingall had not been the only object of his
pilgrimage: he had come to Paris to learn what he could of Emily
Morland too. That purpose he had naturally not avowed at the Nouveau
Luxe: it was hardly the moment to confess his double quest. But the
manifest friendliness of Donald Paul convinced him that there would
be no difficulty in obtaining whatever enlightenment it was in the
young man's power to give. Donald Paul, at first sight, seemed hardly
more expressive than his wife; but though his last avatar was one so
remote from literature, at least he had once touched its borders and
even worn its livery. His great romance had originated in the
accident of his having written an article about its heroine; and
transient and unproductive as that phase of his experience had
probably been, it must have given him a sense of values more
applicable than Mrs. Paul's to French's purpose.</p>

<hr align="center" width="15%">
<p>Luck continued to favour him; for the next morning, as he went
down the stairs of his hotel, he met Donald Paul coming up.</p>

<p>His visitor, fresh and handsome as his photograph, and dressed in
exactly the right clothes for the hour and the occasion, held out an
eager hand.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad&mdash;I hoped I'd catch you," he smiled up at the
descending French; and then, as if to tone down what might seem an
excess of warmth, or at least make it appear the mere overflow of his
natural spirits, he added: "My wife rushed me off to say how sorry
she is that she can't take you to the studio this morning. She'd
quite forgotten an appointment with her dressmaker&mdash;one of her
dressmakers!" Donald Paul stressed it with a frank laugh; his desire,
evidently, was to forestall French's surprise. "You see," he
explained, perhaps guessing that a sense of values was expected of
him, "it's rather more of a business for her than for&mdash;well, the
average woman. These people&mdash;the big ones&mdash;are really artists
themselves nowadays, aren't they? And they all regard her as a sort
of Inspiration; she really tries out the coming fashions for
them&mdash;lots of things succeed or fail as they happen to look on
<i>her.</i>" Here he seemed to think another laugh necessary. "She's
always been an Inspiration; it's come to be a sort of obligation to
her. You see, I'm sure?"</p>

<p>French protested that he saw&mdash;and that any other day was as
convenient&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, but that's the deuce of it! The fact is, we're off for
Biarritz the day after to-morrow; and St. Moritz later. We shan't be
back here, I suppose, till the early spring. And of course <i>you</i>
have your plans; ah, going back to America next week? Jove, that is
bad." He frowned over it with an artless boyish anxiety. "And
tomorrow&mdash;well, you know what a woman's last day in Paris is likely
to be, when she's had only three of them! Should you mind most
awfully&mdash;think it hopelessly inadequate, I mean&mdash;if I offered to take
you to the studio instead?" He reddened a little, evidently not so
much at the intrusion of his own person into the setting of his
predecessor's life, as at his conscious inability to talk about
Horace Fingall in any way that could possibly interest Willis
French.</p>

<p>"Of course," he went on, "I shall be a wretched substitute...I
know so little...so little in any sense...I never met him," he
avowed, as if excusing an unaccountable negligence. "You know how
savagely he kept to himself...Poor Bessy&mdash;<i>she</i> could tell you
something about that!" But he pulled up sharp at this involuntary
lapse into the personal, and let his smile of interrogation and
readiness say the rest for him.</p>

<p>"Go with you? But of course&mdash;I shall be delighted," French
responded; and a light of relief shone in Mr. Paul's transparent
eyes.</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you; and of course she can tell you all about
it later&mdash;add the details. She told me to say that if you didn't mind
turning up again this afternoon late, she'll be ready to answer any
questions. Naturally, she's used to that too!"</p>

<p>This sent a slight shiver through French, with its hint of glib
replies insensibly shaped by repeated questionings. He knew, of
course, that after Fingall's death there had been an outpouring of
articles on him in the journals and the art-reviews of every country:
to correct their mistakes and fill up their omissions was the
particular purpose of his book. But it took the bloom&mdash;another layer
of bloom&mdash;from his enthusiasm to feel that Mrs. Paul's information,
meagre as it was, had already been robbed of its spontaneity, that
she had only been reciting to him what previous interrogators had
been capable of suggesting, and had themselves expected to hear.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Paul read the disappointment in his looks, and
misinterpreted it, for he added: "You can't think how I feel the
absurdity of trying to talk to <i>you</i> about Fingall!"</p>

<p>His modesty was disarming. French answered with sincerity: "I
assure you I shall like nothing better than going there with you,"
and Donald Paul, who was evidently used to assuming that the
sentiments of others were as genuine as his own, at once brightened
into recovered boyishness.</p>

<p>"That's jolly.&mdash;Taxi!" he cried, and they were off.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Almost as soon as they entered the flat, French had again to hail
the reappearance of his "luck." Better, a thousand times better, to
stand in this place with Donald Paul than with Horace Fingall's
widow!</p>

<p>Donald Paul, slipping the key into the rusty lock, had opened the
door and drawn back to let the visitor pass. The studio was cold and
empty&mdash;how empty and how cold! No one had lived in the flat since
Fingall's death: during the first months following it the widow had
used the studio to store his pictures, and only now that the last
were sold, or distributed for sale among the dealers, had the place
been put in the hands of the agents&mdash;like Mrs. Morland's house in
Kensington.</p>

<p>In the wintry overhead light the dust showed thick on the rough
paint-stained floor, on the few canvases leaning against the walls,
and the painter's inconceivably meagre "properties." French had known
that Fingall's studio would not be the upholstered setting for
afternoon teas of Lady Brankhurst's vision, but he had not dared to
expect such a scornful bareness. He looked about him reverently.</p>

<p>Donald Paul remained silent; then he gave one of his shy laughs.
"Not much in the way of cosy corners, eh? Looks rather as if it had
been cleared for a prize fight."</p>

<p>French turned to him. "Well, it <i>was</i>. When he wrestled with
the Angel until dawn."</p>

<p>Mr. Paul's open gaze was shadowed by a faint perplexity, and for
half a second French wondered if his metaphor had been taken as
referring to the former Mrs. Fingall. But in another moment his
companion's eyes cleared. "Of course&mdash;I see! Like What's-his-name: in
the Bible, wasn't he?" He stopped, and began again impulsively: "I
like that idea, you know; he <i>did</i> wrestle with his work! Bessy
says he used to paint a thing over twenty times&mdash;or thirty, if
necessary. It drove his sitters nearly mad. That's why he had to wait
so long for success, I suppose." His glance seemed to appeal to
French to corroborate this rather adventurous view.</p>

<p>"One of the reasons," French assented.</p>

<p>His eyes were travelling slowly and greedily about the vast cold
room. He had instantly noted that, in Lady Brankhurst's description
of the place, nothing was exact but the blackness of the stairs that
led there. The rest she must have got up from muddled memories of
other studios&mdash;that of Jolyesse, no doubt, among the number. French
could see Jolyesse, in a setting of <i>bibelots</i>, dispensing
Turkish coffee to fashionable sitters. But the nakedness of Fingall's
studio had assuredly never been draped: as they beheld it now, so it
must have been when the great man painted there&mdash;save, indeed, for
the pictures once so closely covering the walls (as French saw from
the number of empty nails) that to enter it must have been like
walking into the heart of a sunset.</p>

<p>None were left. Paul had moved away and stood looking out of the
window, and timidly, tentatively, French turned around, one after
another, the canvases against the wall. All were as bare as the room,
though already prepared for future splendours by the hand from which
the brush had dropped so abruptly. On one only a few charcoal strokes
hinted at a head&mdash;unless indeed it were a landscape? The more French
looked the less intelligible it became&mdash;the mere first stammer of an
unuttered message. The young man put it back with a sigh. He would
have liked, beyond almost everything, here under Fingall's roof to
discover just one of his pictures.</p>

<p>"If you'd care to see the other rooms? You know he and Bessy lived
here," he heard his companion suggest.</p>

<p>"Oh, immensely!"</p>

<p>Donald Paul opened a door, struck a match in a dark passage, and
preceded him. "Nothing's changed."</p>

<p>The rooms, which were few and small, were still furnished; and
this gave French the measure of their humbleness&mdash;for they were
almost as devoid of comfort as the studio. Fingall must have lived so
intensely and constantly in his own inner vision that nothing
external mattered. He must have been almost as detached from the
visible world as a great musician or a great ascetic; at least till
one sat him down before a face or a landscape&mdash;and then what he
looked at became the whole of the visible world to him.</p>

<p>"Rather doleful diggings for a young woman," Donald Paul commented
with a half-apologetic smile, as if to say: "Can you wonder that she
likes the Nouveau Luxe?"</p>

<p>French acquiesced. "I suppose, like all the very greatest of them,
he was indifferent to lots of things we think important."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and then..." Paul hesitated. "Then they were so frightfully
poor. He didn't know how to manage&mdash;how to get on with people, either
sitters or dealers. For years he sold nothing, literally nothing. It
<i>was</i> hard on her. She saw so well what he ought to have done;
but he wouldn't listen to her!"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;" French stammered; and saw the other faintly redden.</p>

<p>"I don't mean, of course, that an artist, a great creative artist,
isn't always different...on the contrary..." Paul hesitated again. "I
understand all that...I've experienced it..." His handsome face
softened, and French, mollified, murmured to himself; "He was awfully
kind to Emily Morland&mdash;I'm sure he was."</p>

<p>"Only," Mrs. Paul's husband continued with a deepening
earnestness, as if he were trying to explain to French something not
quite clear to himself, "only, if you're not a great creative artist
yourself, it is hard sometimes, sitting by and looking on and feeling
that if you were just allowed to say a word&mdash;. Of course," he added
abruptly, "he was very good to her in other ways; very grateful. She
was his Inspiration."</p>

<p>"It's something to have been that," French said; and at the words
his companion's colour deepened to a flush which took in his neck and
ears, and spread up to his white forehead.</p>

<p>"It's everything," he agreed, almost solemnly.</p>

<p>French had wandered up to a book-shelf in what had apparently been
Fingall's dressing-room. He had seen no other books about, and was
curious to learn what these had to tell him. They were chiefly old
Tauchnitz novels&mdash;mild mid-Victorian fiction rubbing elbows with a
few odd volumes of Dumas, Maupassant and Zola. But under a loose pile
the critic, with beating heart, had detected a shabby sketch-book.
His hand shook as he opened it; but its pages were blank, and he
reflected ironically that had they not been the dealers would never
have left it there.</p>

<p>"They've been over the place with a fine-toothcomb," he muttered
to himself.</p>

<p>"What have you got hold of?" Donald Paul asked, coming up.</p>

<p>French continued mechanically to flutter the blank pages; then his
hand paused at one which was scribbled over with dots and diagrams,
and marginal notes in Fingall's small cramped writing.</p>

<p>"Tea-party," it was cryptically entitled, with a date beneath; and
on the next page, under the beading: "For tea-party," a single figure
stood out&mdash;the figure of a dowdily-dressed woman seated in a low
chair, a cup in her hand, and looking up as if to speak to some one
who was not yet sketched in. The drawing, in three chalks on a gray
ground, was rapidly but carefully executed: one of those light and
perfect things which used to fall from Fingall like stray petals from
a great tree in bloom. The woman's attitude was full of an ardent
interest; from the forward thrust of her clumsily-shod foot to the
tilt of her head and the high light on her eye-glasses, everything
about her seemed electrified by some eager shock of ideas.</p>

<p>"Who was talking to her&mdash;and what could he have been saying?" was
the first thought the little drawing suggested. But it merely flashed
through French's mind, for he had almost instantly recognized the
portrait&mdash;just touched with caricature, yet living, human, even
tender&mdash;of the woman he least expected to see there.</p>

<p>"Then she <i>did</i> know him!" he triumphed out aloud, forgetting
who was at his elbow. He flushed up at his blunder and put the book
in his companion's hand.</p>

<p>Donald Paul stared at the page.</p>

<p>"She&mdash;who?"</p>

<p>French stood confounded. There she sat&mdash;Emily Morland&mdash;aquiver in
every line with life and sound and colour: French could hear her very
voice running up and down its happy scales! And beside him stood her
lover, and did not recognize her...</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;" Paul stammered at length. "It's&mdash;you mean?" He looked
again. "You think he meant it for Mrs. Morland?" Without waiting for
an answer he fixed French with his large boyish gaze, and exclaimed
abruptly: "Then you knew her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I saw her only once&mdash;just once." French couldn't resist
laying a little stress on the <i>once</i>.</p>

<p>But Donald Paul took the answer unresentfully. "And yet you
recognized her. I suppose you're more used than I am to Fingall's way
of drawing. Do you think he was ever very good at likenesses? I
<i>do</i> see now, of course...but, come, I call it a caricature,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what does that matter?"</p>

<p>"You mean, you think it's so clever?"</p>

<p>"I think it's magnificent!" said French with emotion.</p>

<p>The other still looked at him ingenuously, but with a dawning
light of eagerness. It recalled to French the suppressed, the
exaggerated warmth of his greeting on the hotel stairs. "What is it
he wants of me? For he wants something."</p>

<p>"I never knew, either," Paul continued, "that she and Fingall had
met. Some one must have brought her here, I suppose. It's curious."
He pondered, still holding the book. "And I didn't know you knew
her," he concluded.</p>

<p>"Oh, how should you? She was probably unconscious of the fact
herself. I spent a day with her once in the country, years ago.
Naturally, I've never forgotten it."</p>

<p>Donald Paul's eyes continued obscurely to entreat him. "That's
wonderful!"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;that one should never forget having once met Emily
Morland?" French rejoined, with a smile he could not repress.</p>

<p>"No," said Emily Morland's lover with simplicity. "But the
coincidence. You see, I'd made up my mind to ask you&mdash;." He broke
off, and looked down at the sketch, as if seeking guidance where
doubtless he had so often found it. "The fact is," he began again,
"I'm going to write her Life. She left me all her papers&mdash;I daresay
you know about all that. It's a trust&mdash;a sacred trust; but it's also
a most tremendous undertaking! And yesterday, after hearing something
of what you're planning about Fingall, I realized how little I'd
really thought the book out, how unprepared I was&mdash;what a lot more
there was in that sort of thing than I'd at first imagined. I used to
write&mdash;a little; just short reviews, and that kind of thing. But my
hand's out nowadays; and besides, this is so different. And then, my
time's not quite my own any longer...So I made up my mind that I'd
consult you, ask you if you'd help me...oh, as much as ever you're
willing..." His smile was irresistible. "I asked Bessy. And she
thought you'd understand."</p>

<p>"Understand?" gasped French. "Understand?"</p>

<p>"You see," Paul hurried on, "there are heaps and heaps of
letters&mdash;her beautiful letters! I don't mean&mdash;" his voice trembled
slightly&mdash;"only the ones to me; though some of those...well, I'll
leave it to you to judge...But lots of others too, that all sorts of
people have sent me. Apparently everybody kept her letters. And I'm
simply swamped in them," he ended helplessly, "unless you will."</p>

<p>French's voice was as unsteady as his. "Unless I will? There's
nothing on earth I'd have asked...if I could have imagined it..."</p>

<p>"Oh, really?" Paul's voice dropped back with relief to its
everyday tone. He was clearly unprepared for exaltation. "It's
amazingly kind of you&mdash;so kind that I don't in the least know how to
thank you."</p>

<p>He paused, his hand still between the pages of the sketch-book.
Suddenly he opened it and glanced down again at the drawing, and then
at French.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile&mdash;if you really like this thing; you <i>do?</i>" He
smiled a little incredulously and bent his handsome head to give the
leaf a closer look. "Yes, there are his initials; well, that makes it
all the more..." He tore out the page and handed it to French. "Do
take it," he said. "I wish I had something better of her to give
you&mdash;but there's literally nothing else; nothing except the beautiful
enlarged photograph she had done for me the year we met; and that, of
course&mdash;"</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Mrs. Paul, as French had foreseen she would be, was late at their
second appointment; later even than at the first. But what did French
care? He could have waited contentedly for a week in that blatant
drawing-room, with such hopes in his bosom and such a treasure
already locked up in his portmanteau. And when at last she came she
was just as cordial, as voluble and as unhelpful as ever.</p>

<p>The great difficulty, of course, was that she and her husband were
leaving Paris so soon, and that French, for his part, was under
orders to return at once to America. "The things I could tell you if
we only had the time!" she sighed regretfully. But this left French
unmoved, for he knew by now how little she really had to tell. Still,
he had a good many more questions to ask, a good many more dates and
facts to get at, than could be crowded into their confused hour over
a laden tea-table, with belated parcels perpetually arriving, the
telephone ringing, and the maid putting in her head to ask if the
orange and silver brocade was to go to Biarritz, or to be sent
straight on with the furs and the sports clothes to St. Moritz.</p>

<p>Finally, in the hurried parenthesis between these weightier
matters, he extracted from her the promise to meet him in Paris in
March&mdash;March at the latest&mdash;and give him a week, a whole week. "It
will be so much easier, then, of course," she agreed. "It's the
deadest season of the year in Paris. There'll be nobody to bother us,
and we can really settle down to work&mdash;" her lovely eyes kindled at
the thought&mdash;"and I can give you all the papers you need, and tell
you everything you want to know."</p>

<p>With that he had to be content, and he could afford to be&mdash;now. He
rose to take leave; but suddenly she rose also, a new eagerness in
her eyes. She moved toward the door with him, and there her look
detained him.</p>

<p>"And Donald's book too; you can get to work with Donald at the
same time, can't you?" She smiled on him confidentially. "He's told
me that you've promised to help him out&mdash;it's so angelically good of
you! I do assure you he appreciates it immensely. Perhaps he's a
little too modest about his own ability; but it is a terrible burden
to have had imposed on him, isn't it, just as he and I were having
our first real holiday! It's been a nightmare to him all these
months. Reading all those letters and manuscripts, and deciding&mdash;.
Why don't authors do those things for themselves?" She appealed to
French, half indignantly. "But after all," she concluded, her smile
deepening, "I understand that you should be willing to take the
trouble, in return for the precious thing he's given you."</p>

<p>French's heart gave a frightened thump: her smile had suddenly
become too significant.</p>

<p>"The precious thing?"</p>

<p>She laughed. "Do you mean to say you've forgotten it already?
Well, if you have, I don't think you deserve it. The portrait of Mrs.
Morland&mdash;the <i>only</i> one, apparently A signed drawing of
Horace's; it's something of a prize, you'll admit. Donald tells me
that you and he made the discovery of the sketch-book together. I
can't for the life of me imagine how it ever escaped those harpies of
dealers. You can fancy how they went through everything...like
detectives after finger-prints, I used to say! Poor me&mdash;they used to
have me out of bed every day at daylight! How furious they'd be if
they knew what they've missed!" She paused and laughed again, leaning
in the doorway in one of her long Artemis-attitudes.</p>

<p>French felt his head spinning. He dared not meet her eyes, for
fear of discovering in them the unmasked cupidity he fancied he had
once before detected there. He felt too sick for any thought but
flight; but every nerve in him cried out: "Whatever she says or does,
she shall never never have that drawing back!"</p>

<p>She said and did nothing; which made it even more difficult for
him. It gave him the feeling that if he moved she would move
too&mdash;with a spring, as if she herself were a detective, and suspected
him of having the treasure in his pocket ("Thank God I haven't!" he
thought). And she had him so entirely at her mercy, with all the
Fingall dates and documents still in her hold; there was nothing he
could do but go&mdash;pick up the portmanteau with the drawing in it, and
fly by the next train, if need be!</p>

<p>The idea traversed him in a flash, and then gave way again to the
desolating sense of who she was, and what it was that they were
manoeuvring and watching each other about. That was the worst of
all&mdash;worse even than giving up the drawing, or renouncing the book on
Fingall. He felt that he must get away at any cost, rather than
prolong their silent duel; and, sick at heart, he reached out for the
door-knob.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she exclaimed, her hand coming down on his wrist.</p>

<p>He forced an answering smile. "No?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, her eyes still on his. "You're not going like
that." Though she held him playfully her long fine fingers seemed as
strong as steel. "After all, business is business, isn't it? We
ordinary mortals, who don't live in the clouds among the gods, can't
afford to give nothing for nothing...<i>You</i> don't&mdash;so why should
I?"</p>

<p>He had never seen her so close before, and as her face hovered
over him, so warm, persuasive, confident, he noted in it, with a kind
of savage satisfaction, the first faint lines of age.</p>

<p>"So why should I?" she repeated gaily. He stood silent,
imprisoned; and she went on, throwing her head back a little, and
letting her gaze filter down on him through her rich lowered lashes:
"But I know you'll agree with me that it's only fair. After all,
Donald has set you the example. He's given you something awfully
valuable in return for the favour you're going to do him&mdash;the immense
favour. Poor darling&mdash;there never was anybody as generous as Donald!
Don't be alarmed; I'm not going to ask you to give me a present on
<i>that</i> scale." She drew herself up and threw back her lids, as
if challenging him. "You'd have difficulty in finding one&mdash;anybody
would!"</p>

<p>French was still speechless, bewildered, not daring to think
ahead, and all the while confusedly aware that his misery was feeding
some obscure springs of amusement in her.</p>

<p>"In return for the equally immense favour I'm going to do
you&mdash;coming back to Paris in March, and giving you a whole week&mdash;what
are you going to give <i>me?</i> Have you ever thought about
<i>that?</i>" she flung out at him; and then, before he could answer:
"Oh, don't look so miserable&mdash;don't rack your brains over it! I told
you I wasn't grasping&mdash;I'm not going to ask for anything
unattainable. Only, you see&mdash;" she paused, her face grown suddenly
tender and young again&mdash;"you see, Donald wants so dreadfully to have
a portrait of me, one for his very own, by a painter he really
admires; a <i>likeness</i>, simply, you see, not one of those wild
things poor Horace used to do of me&mdash;and what I want is to beg and
implore you to ask Jolyesse if he'll do me. I can't ask him myself:
Horace despised his things, and was always ridiculing him, and
Jolyesse knew it. It's all very well&mdash;but, as I used to tell Horace,
success does mean something after all, doesn't it? And no one has
been more of a success than Jolyesse&mdash;I hear his prices have doubled
again. Well, that's a proof, in a way...what's the use of denying it?
Only it makes it more difficult for poor me, who can't afford him,
even if I dared to ask!" She wrinkled her perfect brows in mock
distress. "But if <i>you</i> would&mdash;an old friend like you&mdash;if you'd
ask it as a personal favour, and make him see that for the widow of a
colleague he ought to make a reduction in his price&mdash;really a
<i>big</i> reduction!&mdash;I'm sure he'd do it. After all, it's not my
fault if my husband didn't like his pictures. And I should be so
grateful to you, and so would Donald."</p>

<p>She dropped French's arm and held out both her shining hands to
him. "You <i>will</i>&mdash;you really will? Oh, you dear good man, you!"
He had slipped his hands out of hers, but she caught him again, this
time not menacingly but exuberantly.</p>

<p>"If you could arrange it for when I'm here in March, that would be
simply perfect, wouldn't it? You can, you think? Oh, bless you! And
mind, he's got to make it a full-length!" she called after him
joyfully across the threshold.</p>

<h2><a name="s6"></a>VELVET EAR-PADS</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Professor Loring G. Hibbart, of Purewater University, Clio, N. Y.,
settled himself in the corner of his compartment in the
Marseilles-Ventimiglia express, drew his velvet ear-pads from his
pocket, slipped them over his ears, and began to think.</p>

<p>It was nearly three weeks since he had been able to indulge
undisturbed in this enchanting operation. On the steamer which had
brought him from Boston to Marseilles considerable opportunity had in
truth been afforded him, for though he had instantly discovered his
fellow-passengers to be insinuating and pervasive, an extremely rough
passage had soon reduced them to inoffensiveness. Unluckily the same
cause had in like manner affected the Professor; and when the ship
approached calmer waters, and he began to revive, the others revived
also, and proceeded to pervade, to insinuate and even to
multiply&mdash;since a lady gave birth to twins as they entered the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>As for the tumultuous twenty-four hours since his landing, the
Professor preferred not to include them in his retrospect. It was
enough that they were over. "All I want is <i>quiet</i>," he had said
to the doctors who, after his alarming attack of influenza, followed
by bronchial pneumonia, had ordered an immediate departure for warmer
climes; and they had thrust him onto an excursion-steamer jammed with
noisy sight-seers, and shipped him to a port whither all the rest of
the world appeared to be bound at the same moment! His own fault,
perhaps? Well&mdash;he never could plan or decide in a hurry, and when,
still shaken by illness, he had suddenly been told that he must spend
six months in a mild climate, and been faced with the alternatives of
southern California or southern France, he had chosen the latter
because it meant a more complete escape from professional
associations and the terror of meeting people one knew. As far as
climate went, he understood the chances to be equal; and all he
wanted was to recover from his pulmonary trouble and employ his
enforced leisure in writing a refutation of Einstein's newly
published book on Relativity.</p>

<p>Once the Professor had decided on the south of France, there
remained the difficulty of finding, in that populous region, a spot
quiet enough to suit him; but after much anxious consultation with
colleagues who shared his dread of noise and of promiscuous human
intercourse, he had decided on a secluded <i>pension</i> high up in
the hills, between Monte Carlo and Mentone. In this favoured spot, he
was told, no dogs barked, cocks crew or cats courted. There were no
waterfalls, or other sonorous natural phenomena, and it was utterly
impossible for a motor (even with its muffler knocked off) to ascend
the precipitous lane which led to the <i>pension</i>. If, in short,
it were possible to refute Einstein's theory, it was in just such a
place, and there only, that the feat might be accomplished.</p>

<p>Once settled in the train, the Professor breathed more freely.
Most of his fellow-passengers had stayed on the ship, which was
carrying them on to swarm over a succession of other places as he had
just left them swarming over Marseilles. The train he got into was
not very crowded, and should other travellers enter the compartment,
his ear-pads would secure him from interruption. At last he could
revert to the absorbing thought of the book he was planning; could
plunge into it like a diver into the ocean. He drew a deep breath and
plunged...</p>

<p>Certainly the compartment had been empty when the train left
Marseilles&mdash;he was sure of that; but he seemed to remember now that a
man had got in at a later station, though he couldn't have said where
or when; for once he began to think, time vanished from him as
utterly as space.</p>

<p>He became conscious of the intruding presence only from the smell
of tobacco gradually insinuating itself into his nostrils. Very
gradually; for when the Professor had withdrawn into his inner
stronghold of Pure Reason, and pulled up the ladder, it was not easy
for any appeal to reach him through the channel of the senses. Not
that these were defective in him. Far from it: he could smell and
see, taste and hear, with any man alive; but for many years past he
had refrained from exercising these faculties except in so far as
they conduced to the maintenance of life and security. He would have
preferred that the world should contain nothing to see, nothing to
smell, nothing to hear; and by negativing persistently every
superfluous hint of his visual, auditive or olfactory organs he had
sheathed himself in a general impenetrability of which the ear-pads
were merely a restricted symbol.</p>

<p>His noticing the whiff of tobacco was an accident, a symptom of
his still disorganized state; he put the smell resolutely from him,
registered "A Man Opposite," and plunged again into the Abstract.</p>

<p>Once&mdash;about an hour later, he fancied&mdash;the train stopped with a
jerk which flung him abruptly out of his corner. His mental balance
was disturbed, and for one irritating instant his gaze unwillingly
rested on silver groves, purple promontories and a blue sea.
"Ugh&mdash;<i>scenery!</i>" he muttered; and with a renewed effort of the
will he dropped his mental curtain between that inconsequent jumble
of phenomena and the absolutely featureless area in which the pure
intellect thrones. The incident had brought back the smell of his
neighbour's cigarette; but the Professor sternly excluded that also,
and the train moved on...</p>

<p>Professor Hibbart was in truth a man of passionately excitable
nature: no one was ever, by temperament, less adapted to the lofty
intellectual labours in which his mind delighted. He asked only to
live in the empyrean; but he was perpetually being dragged back to
earth by the pity, wrath or contempt excited in him by the slipshod
course of human affairs. There were only two objects on which he
flattered himself he could always look with a perfectly unseeing eye;
and these were a romantic landscape and a pretty woman. And he was
not absolutely sure about the landscape.</p>

<p>Suddenly a touch, soft yet peremptory, was laid on his arm.
Looking down, he beheld a gloved hand; looking up he saw that the man
opposite him was a woman.</p>

<p>To this awkward discovery he was still prepared to oppose the
blank wall of the most complete imperception. But a sharp pinch
proved that the lady who had taken hold of his arm had done so with
the fixed determination to attract his attention, at the cost of
whatever pain or inconvenience to himself. As she appeared also to be
saying something&mdash;probably asking if the next station were the one at
which she ought to get out&mdash;he formed with soundless lips the word
"Deaf," and pointed to his ears. The lady's reply was to release his
wrist, and with her free hand flick off an ear-pad.</p>

<p>"Deaf? Oh, no," she said briskly, in fluent but exotic English.
"You wouldn't need ear-pads if you were. You don't want to be
bothered&mdash;that's all. I know the trick; you got it out of Herbert
Spencer!"</p>

<p>The assault had nearly disabled the Professor for farther
resistance; but he rallied his wits and answered stonily: "I have no
time-table. You'd better consult the guard."</p>

<p>The lady threw her spent cigarette out of the window. As the smoke
drifted away from her features he became uneasily aware that they
were youthful, and that the muscles about her lips and eyes were
contracted into what is currently known as a smile. In another
moment, he realized with dismay, he was going to know what she looked
like. He averted his eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't want to consult the guard&mdash;I want to consult <i>you</i>,"
said the lady.</p>

<p>His ears took reluctant note of an intonation at once gay and
appealing, which caressed the "You" as if it were a new pronoun rich
in vowels, and the only one of its kind in the world.</p>

<p>"Eeee-you," she repeated.</p>

<p>He shook his averted head. "I don't know the name of a single
station on this line."</p>

<p>"Dear me, don't you?" The idea seemed to shock her, to make a
peculiar appeal to her sympathy. "But I do&mdash;every one of them! With
my eyes shut. Listen: I'll begin at the beginning. Paris&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I don't <i>want</i> to know them!" he almost screamed.</p>

<p>"Well, neither do I. What I want is to ask you a favour&mdash;just one
tiny little enormous favour."</p>

<p>The Professor still looked away. "I have been in very bad health
until recently," he volunteered.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad&mdash;glad, I mean," she corrected herself hastily,
"that you're all right again now! And glad too that you've been ill,
since that just confirms it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the Professor fell. "Confirms what?" he snapped, and saw too
late the trap into which he had plunged.</p>

<p>"My belief that you are predestined to help me," replied his
neighbour with joyful conviction.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's quite a mistake&mdash;a complete mistake. I never in my
life helped anybody, in any way. I've always made it a rule not
to."</p>

<p>"Not even a Russian refugee?"</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you have. You've helped <i>me!</i>"</p>

<p>The Professor turned an ireful glance upon her, and she nodded. "I
am a Russian refugee."</p>

<p>"You?" he exclaimed. His eyes, by this time, had definitely
escaped from his control, and were recording with an irrepressible
activity and an exasperating precision the details of her appearance
and her dress. Both were harmonious and opulent. He laughed
incredulously.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh? Can't you see that I'm a refugee; by my
clothes, I mean? Who has such pearls but Russian refugees? Or such
sables? We have to have them&mdash;to sell, of course. You don't care to
buy my sables, do you? For you they would be only six thousand pounds
cash. No, I thought not. It's my duty to ask&mdash;but I didn't suppose
they would interest you. The Paris and London jewellers farm out the
pearls to us; the big dressmakers supply the furs. For of course
we've all sold the originals long ago. And really I've been rather
successful. I placed two sets of silver fox and a rope of pearls last
week at Monte Carlo. Ah, that fatal place! I gambled away the whole
of my commission the same night...But I'm forgetting to tell you how
you've already helped me..."</p>

<p>She paused to draw breath, and in the pause the Professor, who had
kept his hand on his loosened ear-pad, slipped it back over his
ear.</p>

<p>"I wear these," he said coldly, "to avoid argument."</p>

<p>With a flick she had it off again. "I wasn't going to argue&mdash;I was
only going to thank you."</p>

<p>"I can't conceive for what. In any case, I don't want to be
thanked."</p>

<p>Her brows gathered resentfully. "Why did you <i>ask</i> to be,
then?" she snapped; and opening a bejewelled wrist-bag she drew forth
from a smother of cigarette-papers and pawn-tickets a slip of paper
on which her astonished companion read a phrase written in a pointed
feminine hand, but signed with his own name.</p>

<p>"<i>There!</i>"</p>

<p>The Professor took the paper and scanned it indignantly. "This
copy of 'The Elimination of Phenomena' was presented by Professor
Loring G. Hibbart of Purewater University, Clio, N. Y., to the
library of the American Y. M. C. A. Refugee Centre at Odessa.</p>

<p>"A word of appreciation, sent by any reader to the above address,
would greatly gratify Loring G. Hibbart."</p>

<p>"<i>There!</i>" she repeated. "Why did you ask to be thanked if
you didn't want to be? What else does 'greatly gratify' mean? I
couldn't write to you from Odessa because I hadn't the money to buy a
stamp; but I've longed ever since to tell you what your book did for
me. It simply changed my whole life&mdash;books do sometimes, you know. I
saw everything differently&mdash;even our Refugee Centre! I decided at
once to give up my lover and divorce my husband. Those were my two
first Eliminations." She smiled retrospectively. "But you mustn't
think I'm a frivolous person. I have my degree as a Doctor of
Philosophy&mdash;I took it at sixteen, at the University of Moscow. I gave
up philosophy the year after for sculpture; the next year I gave up
sculpture for mathematics and love. For a year I loved. After that I
married Prince Balalatinsky. He was my cousin, and enormously
wealthy. I need not have divorced him, as it turned out, for he was
soon afterward buried alive by the Bolsheviks. But how could I have
foreseen it? And your book had made me feel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" the author of the book interrupted desperately.
"You don't suppose <i>I</i> wrote that rubbish about wanting to be
thanked, do you?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you? How could I tell? Almost all the things sent from
America to the refugee camp came with little labels like that. You
all seemed to think we were sitting before perfectly appointed desks,
with fountain pens and stamp-cases from Bond Street in our pockets. I
remember once getting a lip-stick and a Bernard Shaw calendar
labelled: 'If the refugee who receives these would write a line of
thanks to little Sadie Burt of Meropee Junction, Ga., who bought them
out of her own savings by giving up chewing-gum for a whole month, it
would make a little American girl very happy.' Of course I was sorry
not to be able to write to little Sadie." She broke off, and then
added: "Do you know, I was sure you were my Professor as soon as I
saw your name on your suit-case?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" groaned the Professor.</p>

<p>He had forgotten to remove the obligatory steamer-labels!
Instinctively he reached out a hand to tear off the offending member;
but again a gesture of the Princess's arrested him. "It's too late
now. And you can't surely grudge me the pleasure of thanking you for
your book?"</p>

<p>"But I <i>didn't</i> ask&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; but I wanted to. You see, at that time I had quite discarded
philosophy. I was living in the Actual&mdash;with a young officer of
Preobrajensky&mdash;when the war broke out. And of course in our camp at
Odessa the Actual was the very thing one wanted to get away from. And
your book took me straight back into that other world where I had
known my only pure happiness. Purity&mdash;what a wonderful thing it is!
What a pity it is so hard to keep; like money, and everything else
really valuable! But I'm thankful for any little morsel of it that
I've had. When I was only ten years old&mdash;"</p>

<p>But suddenly she drew back and nestled down into her lustrous
furs. "You thought I was going to tell you the story of my life? No.
Put your ear-pads on again. I know now why you wear them&mdash;because
you're planning a new book. Is it not so? You see I can read your
thoughts. Go on&mdash;do! I would rather assist at the birth of a
masterpiece than chatter about my own insignificant affairs."</p>

<p>The Professor smiled. If she thought masterpieces were born in
that way&mdash;between railway stations, and in a whirl of prattle I Yet
he was not wholly angry. Either because it had been unexpectedly
agreeable to hear his book praised, or because of that harmonious
impression which, now that he actually saw her, a protracted scrutiny
confirmed, he began to feel more tolerantly toward his neighbour.
Deliberately, his eyes still on hers, he pushed the other ear-pad
away.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;" she said with a little gasp. "Does that mean I may go on
talking?" But before he could answer, her face clouded. "I know&mdash;it
only means that I might as well, now that I've broken in on your
meditations. I'm dreadfully penitent; but luckily you won't have me
for long, for I'm getting out at Cannes, and Cannes is the next
station. And that reminds me of the enormous little favour I have to
ask."</p>

<p>The Professor's face clouded also: he had a nervous apprehension
of being asked favours. "My fountain pen," he said, regaining
firmness of tone, "is broken."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;you thought I meant to ask for your autograph? Or perhaps for
a cheque?" (Lord, how quick she was!) She shook her head. "No, I
don't care for compulsory autographs. And I'm not going to ask for
money&mdash;I'm going to give you some."</p>

<p>He faced her with renewed dismay. Could it be&mdash;? After all, he was
not more than fifty-seven; and the blameless life he had led had
perhaps helped to preserve a certain...at least that was <i>one</i>
theory...In these corrupt European societies what might a man not
find himself exposed to? With some difficulty he executed a pinched
smile.</p>

<p>"<i>Money?</i>"</p>

<p>She nodded again. "Oh, don't laugh! Don't think I'm joking. It's
your ear-pads," she disconcertingly added.</p>

<p>"Yes. If you hadn't put them on I should never have spoken to you;
for it wasn't till afterward that I saw your name on the suitcase.
And after that I should have been too shy to break in on the
meditations of a Great Philosopher. But you see I have been
watching&mdash;oh, for years!&mdash;for your ear-pads."</p>

<p>He stared at her helplessly. "You want to buy them from me?" he
asked in terror, wondering how on earth he would be able to get
others in a country of which he did not speak the language.</p>

<p>She burst into a laugh that ran up and down the whole scale of
friendly derision and tender mockery.</p>

<p>"Buy them? Gracious, no! I could make myself a better pair in five
minutes." She smiled at his visible relief. "But you see I'm
ruined&mdash;stony broke; isn't that what they call it? I have a young
American friend who is always saying that about himself. And once in
the Caucasus, years ago, a gipsy told me that if ever I had gambled
away my last penny (and I nearly <i>have</i>) it would all be won
back by a pale intellectual looking man in velvet ear-pads, if only I
could induce him to put a stake on the tables for me." She leaned
forward and scrutinized him. "You are very pale, you know," she said,
"and very intellectual looking. I was sure it was you when you told
me you'd been ill."</p>

<p>Professor Loring D. Hibbart looked about him desperately. He knew
now that he was shut up with a madwoman. A harmless one, probably;
but what if, in the depths of that jewelled bag, a toy revolver
lurked under the pawn-tickets and the cigarette papers? The
Professor's life had been so guarded from what are known as "exciting
situations" that he was not sure of his ability to meet one with
becoming tact and energy.</p>

<p>"I suppose I'm a physical coward," he reflected bitterly, an
uncomfortable dampness breaking out all over him. "And I
<i>know</i>," he added in self-extenuation, "that I'm in no condition
yet for any sort of a struggle..."</p>

<p>But what did one do with lunatics? If only he could remember! And
suddenly he did: one humoured them!</p>

<p>Fortified by the thought, he made shift to glance more kindly
toward the Princess Balalatinsky. "So you want me to gamble for you?"
he said, in the playful tone he might have adopted in addressing
little Sadie Burt of Meropee.</p>

<p>"Oh, how glorious of you! You will? I <i>knew</i> you would! But
first," she broke off, "you must let me explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, do explain, of course," he agreed, rapidly calculating that
her volubility might make the explanation last until they reached the
next station, where, as she had declared, she was to leave the
train.</p>

<p>Already her eye was less wild; and he drew an inward breath of
relief.</p>

<p>"You angel, you! I <i>do</i>," she confessed, "simply love to talk
about myself. And I'm sure you'll be interested when I tell you that,
if you'll only do as I ask, I shall be able to marry one of your own
compatriots&mdash;such a beautiful heroic youth! It is for him, for him
only, that I long to be wealthy again. If you loved, could you bear
to see your beloved threatened with starvation?"</p>

<p>"But I thought," he gently reminded her, "that it was you who were
threatened with starvation?"</p>

<p>"We <i>both</i> are. Isn't it terrible? You see, when we met and
loved, we each had the same thought&mdash;to make the other wealthy! It
was not possible, at the moment, for either of us to attain our end
by the natural expedient of a rich marriage with reasonable prospect
of a quick divorce&mdash;so we staked our all at those accursed tables,
and we both lost! My poor betrothed has only a few hundred francs
left, and as for me, I have had to take a miserably paid job as a
dressmaker's <i>mannequin</i> at Cannes. But I see you are going on
to Monte Carlo (yes, that's on your luggage too); and as I don't
suppose you will spend a night there without visiting the rooms, I&mdash;"
She was pulling forth the hundred francs from her inexhaustible bag
when the Professor checked her with dismay. Mad though she might be,
he could not even make believe to take her money.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>not</i> spending a night at Monte Carlo," he protested.
"I'm only getting out there to take a motorbus for a quiet place up
in the hills; I've the name written down somewhere; my room is
engaged, so I couldn't possibly wait over," he argued gently.</p>

<p>She looked at him with what seemed to his inflamed imagination the
craftiness of a maniac. "Don't you know that our train is nearly two
hours late? I don't suppose you noticed that we ran over a crowded
excursion charabanc near Toulon? Didn't you even hear the ambulances
rushing up? Your motorbus will certainly have left Monte Carlo when
you arrive, so you'll <i>have</i> to spend the night there! And even
if you don't," she added persuasively, "the station's only two steps
from the Casino, and you surely can't refuse just to nip in for half
an hour." She clasped her hands in entreaty. "You wouldn't refuse if
you knew my betrothed&mdash;your young compatriot! If only we had a few
thousands all would go smoothly. We should be married at once and go
to live on his ancestral estate of Kansas. It appears the climate is
that of Africa in summer and of the Government of Omsk in winter; so
our plan is to grow oranges and breed sables. You see, we can hardly
fail to succeed with two such crops. All we ask is enough money to
make a start. And that you will get for me tonight. You have only to
stake this hundred franc note; you'll win on the first turn, and
you'll go on winning. You'll see!"</p>

<p>With one of her sudden plunges she pried open his contracted fist
and pressed into it a banknote wrapped in a torn envelope. "Now
listen; this is my address at Cannes. Princess Balala&mdash;oh, here's the
station. Goodbye, guardian angel. No, "au revoir"; I shall see you
soon. They call me Betsy at the dressmaker's..."</p>

<p>Before he could open his convulsed fingers, or dash out after her,
she had vanished, bag and baggage, in the crowd and confusion of the
platform; other people, pushing and chattering and tearing themselves
from the embrace of friends, had piled into her place, and were
waving from the window, and blocking the way out; and now the train
was moving on, and there he sat in his corner, aghast, clutching the
banknote...</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>At Monte Carlo the Professor captured a porter and rescued his
luggage. Exhausted by this effort, and by the attempt to communicate
with the porter, first in Latin and then in French as practised at
Purewater, he withdrew to a corner of the waiting-room and fished in
his pockets for the address of the quiet <i>pension</i> in the hills.
He found it at last, and handed it wearily to the porter. The latter
threw up his hands. "<i>Parti! Parti! Autobus</i> gone." That devil
of a woman had been right!</p>

<p>When would there be another, the Professor asked.</p>

<p>Not till tomorrow morning at 8:30. To confirm his statement the
porter pointed to a large time-table on the wall of the waiting-room.
The Professor scanned it and sat down again with a groan. He was
about to consult his companion as to the possibility of finding a
night's lodging in a respectable <i>pension</i> (fantastic as the
idea seemed in such a place); but hardly had he begun: "Can you tell
me where&mdash;" when, with a nod of comprehension and a wink of
complicity, the porter returned in fluent English: "Pretty ladies?
Turkish bath? Fottographs?"</p>

<p>The Professor repudiated these suggestions with a shudder, and
leaving his bags in the cloak-room set forth on his quest. He had
hardly taken two steps when another stranger of obviously doubtful
morality offered him a pamphlet which he was indignantly rejecting
when he noticed its title: "The Theory of Chance in Roulette." The
theory of chance was deeply interesting to the Professor, and the
idea of its application to roulette not without an abstract
attraction. He bought the pamphlet and sat down on the nearest
bench.</p>

<p>His study was so absorbing that he was roused only by the fall of
twilight, and the scattered twinkle of many lamps all radiating up to
the central focus of the Casino. The Professor started to his feet,
remembering that he had still to find a lodging. "And I must be up
early to catch the bus," he reminded himself. He took his way down a
wide empty street apparently leading to a quieter and less
illuminated quarter. This street he followed for some distance,
vainly scrutinizing the houses, which seemed all to be private
dwellings, till at length he ran against a slim well-set-up young
fellow in tennis flannels, with a bright conversational eye, who was
strolling along from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," said the Professor.</p>

<p>"What for?" rejoined the other, in a pleasant tone made doubly
pleasant by the familiar burr of the last word, which he pronounced
like <i>fur</i>.</p>

<p>"Why, you're an American!" exclaimed the Professor.</p>

<p>"Sher<i>lock!</i>" exulted the young man, extending his hand. "I
diagnose the same complaint in yourself."</p>

<p>The Professor sighed pleasurably. "Oh, yes. What I want," he
added, "is to find a plain quiet boarding-house or family hotel."</p>

<p>"Same as mother used to make 'em?" The young man reflected. "Well,
it's a queer place in which to prosecute your search; but there is
one at Monte, and I'm about the only person that knows it. My name's
Taber Tring. Come along."</p>

<p>For a second the Professor's eye rested doubtfully on Mr. Tring.
He knew, of course&mdash;even at Purewater it was known&mdash;that in the
corrupt capitals of Europe one could not always rely implicitly on
the information given by strangers casually encountered; no, not even
when it was offered with affability, and in the reassuring twang of
the Western States. But after all Monte Carlo was not a capital; it
was just an absurd little joke of a town crammed on a ledge between
sea and mountain; and a second glance at the young man convinced the
Professor that he was as harmless as the town.</p>

<p>Mr. Tring, who seemed quick at thought-reading, returned his look
with an amused glance.</p>

<p>"Not much like our big and breezy land, is it? These Riviera
resorts always remind me of the subway at rush hours; everybody
strap-hanging. But my landlady is an old friend, and I know one of
her boarders left this morning, because I heard her trying to seize
his luggage. He got away; so I don't see why you shouldn't have his
room. See?"</p>

<p>The Professor saw. But he became immediately apprehensive of
having his own luggage seized, an experience unprecedented in his
history.</p>

<p>"Are such things liable to occur in this place?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"What? A scrap with your landlady? Not if you pay up regularly; or
if she likes you. I guess she didn't like that other fellow; and I
know he was always on the wrong side of the tables."</p>

<p>"The tables&mdash;do you refer to the gambling tables?" The Professor
stopped short to put the question.</p>

<p>"That's it," said the other.</p>

<p>"And do you yourself sometimes visit the gambling-rooms?" the
Professor next enquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," said Taber Tring expressively.</p>

<p>The Professor scrutinized him with growing interest. "And have you
a theory of chance?"</p>

<p>The young man met his gaze squarely. "I have; but it can't be put
into language that would pass the censor."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;you refer, no doubt, to your personal experience. But, as
regards the theory&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, the theory has let me down to bedrock; and I came down on
it devilish hard." His expression turned from apathy to animation.
"I'm stony broke; but if you'd like to lend me a hundred francs to
have another try&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the Professor hastily; "I don't possess it." And
his doubts began to stir again.</p>

<p>Taber Tring laughed. "Of course you don't; not for lending
purposes. I was only joking; everybody makes that joke here. Well,
here's the house; I'll go ahead and rout out our hostess."</p>

<p>They stopped before a pleasant-looking little house at the end of
the street. A palm-tree, a couple of rose-bushes and a gateway
surmounted by the word <i>Arcadie</i> divided it from the pavement;
the Professor drew a breath of relief as a stout lady in an orange
wig bustled out to receive him.</p>

<p>In spite of the orange wig her face was so full of a shrewd
benevolence that the Professor felt sure he had reached a haven of
rest. She welcomed him affably, informed him that she had a room, and
offered to lead him up to it. "Only for tonight, though? For it is
promised to a Siamese nobleman for tomorrow."</p>

<p>This, the Professor assured her, made no difference, as he would
be leaving at daylight. But on the lowest step of the stair he turned
and addressed himself to Mr. Tring.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the lady would be good enough to have my bags brought up
from the station? If you would kindly explain that I'm going out now
to take a little stroll. As I'm leaving so early tomorrow it's my
only chance to have a look around."</p>

<p>"That's so; I'll tell her," the young man rejoined
sympathetically; and as the Professor's hand was on the gate, he
heard Mr. Tring call out, mimicking the stentorian tones of a
megaphone man on a sight-seeing motorbus: "Third street to the left,
then first right to the tables"; after which he added, in his natural
tone: "Say, Arcadia locks up at midnight."</p>

<p>The Professor smiled at the superfluous hint.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Having satisfied a polyglot door-keeper as to his nationality, and
the fact that he was not a minor, the Professor found himself in the
gambling-rooms. They were not particularly crowded for people were
beginning to go out for dinner, and he was able to draw fairly near
to the first roulette table he encountered.</p>

<p>As he stood looking over the shoulders of the players he
understood that no study of abstract theories could be worth the
experience acquired by thus observing the humours of the goddess in
her very temple. Her caprices, so ably seconded by the inconceivable
stupidity, timidity or rashness of her votaries, first amused and
finally exasperated the Professor; he began to feel toward her
something of the annoyance excited in him by the sight of a pretty
woman, or any other vain superfluity, combined with the secret sense
that if he chose he could make her dance to his tune, and that it
might be mildly amusing to do so. He had felt the same once or
twice&mdash;but only for a fugitive instant&mdash;about pretty women.</p>

<p>None, however, had ever attracted him as strongly as this veiled
divinity. The longing to twitch the veil from her cryptic features
became violent, irresistible. "Not one of these fools has any idea of
the theory of chance," he muttered to himself, elbowing his way to a
seat near one of the croupiers. As he did so, he put his hand into
his pocket, and found to his disgust that it contained only a single
five franc piece and a few <i>sous</i>. All the rest of his money&mdash;a
matter of four or five hundred francs&mdash;lay locked up in his suit-case
at <i>Arcadie</i>. He anathematized his luck in expurgated language,
and was about to rise from the table when the croupier called out:
"<i>Faites vos jeux, Messieurs</i>."</p>

<p>The Professor, with a murmured expletive which was to a real oath
what Postum is to coffee, dropped back into his place and flung his
five franc piece on the last three numbers. He lost.</p>

<p>Of course&mdash;in his excitement he had gone exactly contrary to his
own theory! It was on the first three that he had meant to stake his
paltry bet. Well; now it was too late. But stay&mdash;</p>

<p>Diving into another pocket, he came with surprise on a hundred
franc note. Could it really be his? But no; he had an exact
memorandum of his funds, and he knew this banknote was not to be thus
accounted for. He made a violent effort to shake off his abstraction,
and finally recalled that the note in question had been pressed into
his hand that very afternoon as he left the train. But by whom&mdash;?</p>

<p>"<i>Messieurs, faites vos jeux! Faites vos jeux! Le jeu est fait.
Rien ne va plus</i>."</p>

<p>The hundred francs, escaping from his hand, had fluttered of
themselves to a number in the middle of the table. That number came
up. Across the green board thirty-six other hundred franc notes flew
swiftly back in the direction of the Professor. Should he put them
all back on the same number? "Yes," he nodded calmly to the
croupier's question; and the three-thousand seven hundred francs were
guided to their place by the croupier's rake.</p>

<p>The number came up again, and another argosy of notes sailed into
the haven of the happy gambler's pocket. This time he knew he ought
to settle down quietly to his theory; and he did so. He staked a
thousand and tripled it, then let the three thousand lie, and won
again. He doubled that stake, and began to feel his neighbours
watching him with mingled interest and envy as the winnings once more
flowed his way. But to whom did this mounting pile really belong?</p>

<p>No time to think of that now; he was fast in the clutches of his
theory. It seemed to guide him like some superior being seated at the
helm of his intelligence: his private daemon pitted against the
veiled goddess! It was exciting, undoubtedly; considerably more so,
for example, than taking tea with the President's wife at Purewater.
He was beginning to feel like Napoleon, disposing his battalions to
right and left, advancing, retreating, reinforcing or redistributing
his troops. Ah, the veiled goddess was getting what she deserved for
once!</p>

<p>At a late hour of the evening, when the Professor had become the
centre of an ever-thickening crowd of fascinated observers, it
suddenly came back to him that a woman had given him that original
hundred franc note. A woman in the train that afternoon...But what
did he care for that? He was playing the limit at every stake; and
his mind had never worked more clearly and with a more exquisite
sense of complete detachment. He was in his own particular seventh
heaven of lucidity. He even recalled, at the precise moment when
cognizance of the fact became useful, that the doors of
<i>Arcadie</i> closed at midnight, and that he had only just time to
get back if he wished to sleep with a roof over his head.</p>

<p>As he did wish to, he pocketed his gains quietly and composedly,
rose from the table and walked out of the rooms. He felt hungry,
cheerful and alert. Perhaps, after all, excitement had been what he
needed&mdash;pleasurable excitement, that is, not the kind occasioned by
the small daily irritations of life, such as the presence of that
woman in the train whose name he was still unable to remember. What
he would have liked best of all would have been to sit down in one of
the brightly lit caf&eacute;s he was passing, before a bottle of beer
and a ham sandwich; or perhaps what he had heard spoken of as a Welsh
rabbit. But he did not want to sleep on a bench, for the night air
was sharp; so he continued self-denyingly on his way to
<i>Arcadie</i>.</p>

<p>A sleepy boy in a dirty apron let him in, locked up after him, and
led him to a small bare room on the second floor. The stairs creaked
and rattled as they mounted, and the rumblings of sleep sounded
through the doors of the rooms they passed. <i>Arcadie</i> was a
cramped and ramshackle construction, and the Professor hoped to
heaven that his <i>pension</i> in the hills would be more solidly
built and less densely inhabited. However, for one night it didn't
matter&mdash;or so he imagined.</p>

<p>His guide left him, and he turned on the electric light, threw
down on the table the notes with which all his pockets were bulging,
and began to unstrap his portmanteaux.</p>

<p>Though he had so little luggage he always found the process of
unpacking a long and laborious one; for he never could remember where
he had put anything, and invariably passed through all the successive
phases of apprehension and despair before he finally discovered his
bedroom slippers in his spongebag, and the sponge itself (still
dripping) rolled up inside his pyjamas.</p>

<p>But tonight he sought for neither sponge not pyjamas, for as he
opened his first suitcase his hand lit on a ream of spotless
foolscap&mdash;the kind he always used for his literary work. The table on
which he had tossed his winnings held a crusty hotel inkstand, and
was directly overhung by a vacillating electric bulb. Before it was a
chair; through the open window flowed the silence of the night,
interwoven with the murmurs of a sleeping sea and hardly disturbed by
the occasional far-off hoot of a motor horn. In his own brain was the
same nocturnal quiet and serenity. A curious thing had happened to
him. His bout with the veiled goddess had sharpened his wits and
dragged him suddenly and completely out of the intellectual apathy
into which he had been gradually immersed by his illness and the
harassing discomforts of the last few weeks. He was no longer
thinking now about the gambling tables or the theory of chance; but
with all the strength of his freshly stimulated faculties was
grappling the mighty monster with whom he meant to try a fall.</p>

<p>"<i>Einstein!</i>" he cried, as a Crusader might have shouted his
battle-cry. He sat down at the table, shoved aside the banknotes,
plunged his pen into the blue mud of the inkstand, and began.</p>

<p>The silence was delicious, mysterious. Link by link the chain of
his argument unrolled itself, travelling across his pages with the
unending flow of a trail of migratory caterpillars. Not a break; not
a hesitation. It was years since his mental machinery had worked with
that smooth consecutiveness. He began to wonder whether, after all,
it might not be better to give up the idea of a remote and doubtful
<i>pension</i> in the hills, and settle himself for the winter in a
place apparently so propitious to his intellectual activities.</p>

<p>It was then that the noises in the next room suddenly began. First
there was the brutal slam of the door, followed by a silly
bad-tempered struggle with a reluctant lock. Then a pair of shoes
were flung down on the tiled floor. Water was next poured into an
unsteady basin, and a water-jug set down with a hideous clatter on a
rickety washstand which seemed to be placed against the communicating
door between the two rooms. Turbulent ablutions ensued. These over,
there succeeded a moment of deceptive calm, almost immediately
succeeded by a series of whistled scales, emitted just above the
whistler's breath, and merging into the exact though subdued
reproduction of various barn-yard gutturals, ending up with the
raucous yelp of a parrot proclaiming again and again: "I'm stony
broke, I am!"</p>

<p>All the while Professor Hibbart's brain continued to marshal its
arguments, and try to press them into the hard mould of words. But
the struggle became more and more unequal as the repressed cacophony
next door increased. At last he jumped up, rummaged in every pocket
for his ear-pads and snapped them furiously over his ears. But this
measure, instead of silencing the tenuous insistent noises from the
next room, only made him strain for them more attentively through the
protecting pads, giving them the supernatural shrillness of sounds
heard at midnight in a sleeping house, the secret crackings and
creakings against which heaped-up pillows and drawn-up bedclothes are
a vain defence.</p>

<p>Finally the Professor noticed that there was a wide crack under
the communicating door. Not till that crack was filled would work be
possible. He jumped up again and dived at the washstand for towels.
But he found that in the hasty preparation of the room the towels had
been forgotten. A newspaper, then&mdash;but no; he cast about him in vain
for a newspaper...</p>

<p>The noises had now sunk to a whisper, broken by irritating
intervals of silence; but in the exasperated state of the Professor's
nerves these irregular lulls, and the tension of watching for the
sounds that broke them, were more trying than what had gone before.
He sent a despairing glance about him, and his eye lit on the pile of
banknotes on the table. He sprang up again, seized the notes, and
crammed them into the crack.</p>

<p>After that the silence became suddenly and almost miraculously
complete, and he went on with his writing.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>After his first twenty-four hours in the hills the Professor was
ready to swear that this final refuge was all he had hoped for. The
situation (though he had hardly looked out on it) seemed high yet
sheltered; he had a vague impression of sunshine in his room; and
when he went down on the first morning, after a deep and curative
sleep, he at once found himself in a congenial atmosphere. No
effusive compatriots; no bowing and scraping French; only four or
five English people, as much in dread of being spoken to as he was of
their speaking to him. He consumed the necessary number of square
inches of proteins and carbohydrates and withdrew to his room, as
stubbornly ignored as if the other guests had all thought he was
trying to catch their eyes. An hour later he was lost in his
work.</p>

<p>If only life could ever remain on an even keel! But something had
made him suspect it from the first: <i>there was a baby in the
house</i>. Of course everybody denied it: the cook said the bowl of
pap left by accident on the stairs was for the cat; the landlady said
she had been a widow twenty years, and did he suppose&mdash;? And the
<i>bonne</i> denied that there was a smell of paregoric on the
landing, and said that was the way the scent of mimosa sometimes
affected people.</p>

<p>That night, after a constitutional in the garden (ear-pads on),
the Professor went up to his room to resume his writing. For two
hours he wrote uninterruptedly; then he was disturbed by a faint
wail. He clapped on the pads, and continued; but the wail, low as it
was, pierced them like a corkscrew. Finally he laid down his pen and
listened, furiously. Every five minutes the sound came again. "I
suppose they'll say it's a kitten!" he growled. No such pretence
could deceive him for a moment; he remembered now that at the moment
of entering the house he had noticed a smell of nursery. If only he
had turned straight around and gone elsewhere! But where?</p>

<p>The idea of a fresh plunge into the unknown made him feel as weak
as in the first stages of convalescence. And then his book had
already sunk such talons into him; he could feel it sucking at his
brain like some hungry animal. And all those people downstairs had
been as cold and stony at dinner as they had at lunch. After two such
encounters he was sure they would never bother him. A Paradise
indeed, but for that serpent!</p>

<p>The wail continued, and he turned in his chair and looked slowly
and desperately about him. The room was small and bare, and had only
one door, the one leading into the passage. He vaguely recalled that,
two nights before, at Monte Carlo, he had been disturbed in much the
same way, and had found means to end the disturbance. What had he
done? If only he could remember!</p>

<p>His eye went back to the door. There was a light under it now; no
doubt someone was up with the child. Slowly his mind dropped from the
empyrean to the level of the crack under the door.</p>

<p>"A couple of towels...Ah, but, there are no towels!" Almost as the
words formed themselves, his glance lit on a well-garnished rack.
What had made him think there were no towels? Why, he had been
reliving the night at Monte Carlo, where in fact, he now remembered,
he could find none, and to protect himself from the noise next door
had had to...</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" shouted the Professor. His pen clattered to the
floor. He jumped up, and his chair crashed after it. The baby,
terror-struck, ceased to cry. There was an awful silence.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" shouted the Professor.</p>

<p>Slowly the vision of that other room came back: he saw himself
jumping up just as wildly, dashing for towels and finding none, and
then seizing a pile of papers and cramming them into the crack under
the door. Papers, indeed! "Oh, my God..."</p>

<p>It was money that he had seized that other night: hundreds of
hundred franc bills; or hundreds of thousands, were they? How
furiously he had crushed and crumpled them in his haste to cram
enough stuffing into the crack! Money&mdash;an unbelievable amount of it.
But how in the world had it got there, to whom on earth did it
belong?</p>

<p>The Professor sat down on the edge of the bed and took his
bursting head between his hands.</p>

<p>Daylight found him still labouring to reconstitute the succession
of incredible episodes leading up to his mad act. Of all the piles of
notes he had stuffed under the door not one franc had belonged to
him. Of that he was now sure. He recalled also, but less clearly,
that some one had given him a banknote&mdash;a hundred francs, he thought;
was it on the steamer at Marseilles, or in the train?&mdash;given it with
some mysterious injunction about gambling...that was as far as he
could go at present...His mind had come down from the empyrean with a
crash, and was still dazed from its abrupt contact with reality. At
any rate, not a penny of the money was his, and he had left it all
under the door in his hotel bedroom at Monte Carlo. And that was two
days ago...</p>

<p>The baby was again crying, but the rest of the house still slept
when, unkempt, unshorn, and with as many loose ends to his raiment as
Hamlet, Professor Hibbart dashed out past an affrighted <i>bonne</i>,
who cried after him that he might still catch the autobus if he took
the short cut to the village.</p>

<p>To the Professor any abrupt emergence from his work was like
coming to after a severe operation. He floated in a world as empty of
ideas as of facts, and hemmed with slippery perpendicular walls. All
the way to Monte Carlo those walls were made of the faces in the
motorbus, blank inscrutable faces, smooth secret surfaces up which
his mind struggled to clamber back to the actual. Only one definite
emotion survived: hatred of the being&mdash;a woman, was it?&mdash;who had
given him that fatal hundred franc note. He clung to that feeling as
to a life-belt, waiting doggedly till it should lift him back to
reality. If only he could have recalled his enemy's name!</p>

<p>Arrived at Monte Carlo he hailed a taxi and pronounced the one
name he did recall: <i>Arcadie!</i> But what chance was there that
the first chauffeur he met would know the title, or remember the
site, of that undistinguished family hotel?</p>

<p>"<i>Arcadie?</i> But, of course! It's the place they're all asking
for!" cried the chauffeur, turning without a moment's hesitation in
what seemed to his fare to be the right direction. Yet how could that
obscure pension be the place "they" were all asking for, and who in
the name of madness were "they"?</p>

<p>"Are you sure&mdash;?" the Professor faltered.</p>

<p>"Of finding the way? <i>Allons donc</i>; we have only to follow
the crowd!"</p>

<p>This was a slight exaggeration, for at that early hour the
residential quarter of Monte Carlo was hardly more populous than when
the Professor had last seen it; but if he had doubted being on the
right road his doubt was presently dispelled by the sight of a
well-set-up young man in tennis flannels, with a bright
conversational eye, who came swinging along from the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>"Taber Tring!" cried a voice from the depths of the Professor's
sub-consciousness; and the Professor nearly flung himself over the
side of the taxi in the effort to attract his friend's notice.</p>

<p>Apparently he had been mistaken; for the young man, arrested by
his signals, gave back a blank stare from eyes grown suddenly
speechless, and then, turning on his heels, disappeared double-quick
down a side-street. The Professor, thrown back into his habitual
uncertainty, wavered over the question of pursuit; but the taxi was
still moving forward, and before he could decide what to do it had
worked its way through a throng of gaping people and drawn up before
a gate surmounted by the well-remembered <i>Arcadie</i>.</p>

<p>"There you are!" the chauffeur gestured, with the air of a parent
humouring a spoilt child.</p>

<p><i>There he was!</i> The Professor started to jump out, and
pushing through the crowd was confronted with a smoking ruin. The
garden gate, under its lying inscription, led straight into chaos;
and behind where <i>Arcadie</i> had stood, other houses, blank
unknown houses, were also shouldering up to gape at the disaster.</p>

<p>"But this is not the place!" remonstrated the Professor. "This is
a house that has burnt down!"</p>

<p>"<i>Parbleu</i>," replied the chauffeur, still humouring him.</p>

<p>The Professor's temples were bursting.</p>

<p>"But was it&mdash;<i>was</i> it&mdash;was <i>this</i> the Hotel
<i>Arcadie?</i>"</p>

<p>The chauffeur shrugged again and pointed to the name.</p>

<p>"When&mdash;did it burn?"</p>

<p>"Early yesterday."</p>

<p>"And the landlady&mdash;the person who kept it?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, &ccedil;a</i>..."</p>

<p>"But how, in the name of pity, can I find out?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur seemed moved by his distress. "Let Monsieur reassure
himself. There was no loss of life. If Monsieur had friends or
relations..."</p>

<p>The Professor waved away the suggestion.</p>

<p>"We could, of course, address ourselves to the police," the
chauffeur continued.</p>

<p>The police! The mere sound of the word filled his hearer with
dismay. Explain to the police about that money? How could he&mdash;and in
his French? He turned cold at the idea, and in his dread of seeing
himself transported to the <i>commissariat</i> by the too-sympathetic
driver, he hurriedly paid the latter off, and remained alone gazing
through the gate at the drenched and smoking monument of his
folly.</p>

<p>The money&mdash;try to get back the money? It had seemed almost
hopeless before; now the attempt could only expose him to all the
mysterious perils of an alien law. He saw himself interrogated,
investigated, his passport seized, his manuscript confiscated, and
every hope of rational repose and work annihilated for months to
come. He felt himself curiously eyed by the policeman who was
guarding the ruins, and turned from the scene of the disaster almost
as hurriedly as the young man whom he had taken&mdash;no doubt
erroneously&mdash;for Taber Tring.</p>

<p>Having reached another quarter of the town, he sat down on a bench
to take stock of his situation.</p>

<p>It was exactly what he had done two days before when, on arriving
at Monte Carlo, he had found that he had missed the motorbus; and the
associations of ideas once more came to his rescue.</p>

<p>Gradually there arose in his mind a faint wavering vision of a
young woman, pearled and furred and scented, precipitately descending
from his compartment, and, as she did so, cramming a banknote into
his hand.</p>

<p>"The Princess...the Princess...<i>they call me Betsy at the
dressmaker's</i>..." That was as far as the clue went; but presently
the Professor remembered that his companion had got out of the train
at Cannes, and it became certain to him that his only hope of
clearing his overburdened conscience would be to take the train to
that place, and there prosecute his almost hopeless search.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Not until he found himself seated in the train, and on the point
of starting for Cannes, did the full horror of his situation break on
the Professor. Then, for an hour, he contemplated it in all its
intricate enormity, saw himself as a man dishonoured, ruined (for he
now remembered the full amount of the sum he had to account for),
and, worse still, severed from his best-loved work for a period
incalculably long. For after he had struggled through the preliminary
difficulties he would have to settle down to the slow task of
reimbursement, and he knew that, to earn enough money to repay what
he had lost, he must abandon serious scientific work such as he was
now engaged in, and probably stoop&mdash;abominable thought!&mdash;to writing
popular "science" articles in one of the illustrated magazines. Such
a job had once been offered him on very handsome terms, and
contemptuously rejected; and the best he could now hope was that
there was still an opening for him somewhere between the Etiquette
Column and the notes on Rachel powder and bathing tights.</p>

<p>Arrived at Cannes, he found his way to what appeared to be the
fashionable shopping-street, and exteriorising his attention by an
extreme effort of the will he began to go the rounds of the
dressmaking establishments.</p>

<p>At every one he was received with distinguished politeness, and
every one, by some curious coincidence, had a Betsy to offer him. As
the Betsies were all young, fluffy and rosy, considerable offence was
caused by his rapid rejection of them, and it was in vain that he
tried to close his ears to the crude and disobliging comments which
on each occasion attended his retreat. But he had by this time
regained a sufficiently clear vision of the Princess to be sure that
she was not concealed behind any of the youthful substitutes proposed
to him. In despair he issued from the last shop, and again sat
himself down to consider.</p>

<p>As he did so, his mind gave a queer click, and the doors of his
inner consciousness again swung open. But this time it was only to
draw him back into the creative world from which he had been so
violently ejected. He had suddenly seen a point to be made in the
Einstein controversy, and he began to fumble for a paper on which to
jot it down. He found only one, the closely-scribbled flap of a torn
envelope on which, during the journey to Cannes, he had calculated
and re-calculated the extent of the sum he would have to raise to
reimburse the Princess; but possibly there might be a clear space on
the other side. He turned it over, and there read, in a tall slanting
hand:</p>

<p>Princesse Balalatinsky,<br>
<i>Villa Mon Caprice</i>, Route de Californie.</p>

<p>He started to his feet, and glanced about him frantically for a
taxi. He had no idea where the Route de Californie was, but in his
desperate circumstances, it seemed as easy to hire a taxi for a five
minutes' transit as for a long expedition. Besides, it was the only
way he knew of being sure of reaching his destination; and to do so
as soon as possible was now a fixed idea.</p>

<p>The taxi carried him a long way; back through the whole length of
the town, out on a flat white dusty road, and then up and up between
walls overhung with luxuriant verdure till, at a turn, it stood still
with a violent jerk.</p>

<p>The Professor looked out, and saw himself confronted by the
expressive countenance of Mr. Taber Tring.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God&mdash;you again!" shrieked the young man, turning suddenly
white with fury&mdash;or was it rather with fear?</p>

<p>"Why do you say <i>again?</i>" questioned the Professor; but his
interlocutor, taking to his heels with unaccountable velocity, had
already disappeared down a verdant by-way.</p>

<p>The Professor leaned back in the taxi in speechless amazement. He
was sure now that the "again" referred to their previous encounter
that morning at Monte Carlo, and he could only conclude that it had
become a fixed habit of Taber Tring's to run away whenever they met,
and that he ran a great deal too fast for the Professor ever to hope
to overtake him.</p>

<p>"Well," said the driver, "there's a gentleman who isn't pleased.
He thought I had no fare, and expected to get a lift up to the top of
this mountain."</p>

<p>"I should have been happy to give him a lift," said the Professor
rather wistfully; to which the driver replied: "He must be a mile off
by this time. He didn't seem to fancy your looks."</p>

<p>There was no controverting this statement, mortifying as it was,
and they continued their ascent till a gateway impressively crowned
by heraldic lions admitted them to terraced gardens above which a
villa of ample proportions looked forth upon the landscape.</p>

<p>The Professor was by this time so steeled to the unexpected that
he hardly paused to consider the strange incongruity between the
Princess's account of her fortunes and the setting in which she
lived. He had read <i>Mon Caprice</i> on the gate, and that was the
name on the envelope he had found in his pocket. With a resolute hand
he rang the bell and asked a resplendent footman if the Princess
Balalatinsky were at home.</p>

<p>He was shown through a long succession of drawing-rooms, in the
last of which the Princess rose from the depths of a broad divan. She
was dressed in black draperies, half-transparent&mdash;no,
half-translucent; and she stood before the Professor in all the
formidable completeness of her beauty.</p>

<p>Instantly his mind clicked again, and a voice shrilled up at him
from the depths: "You always knew you could still recognize a
beautiful woman when you saw one"; but he closed his ears to the
suggestion and advanced toward the lady.</p>

<p>Before he could take more than three steps she was at his side,
almost at his feet; her burning clasp was on his wrists, and her eyes
were consuming him like coals of fire.</p>

<p>"Master! <i>Maestro!</i> Disguise is useless! You choose to come
to me unannounced; but I was sure you would answer my appeal, and I
should have recognized you anywhere, and among any number of people."
She lifted his astonished hand to her lips. "It is the penalty of
genius," she breathed.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" gasped the Professor.</p>

<p>A scented finger was laid across his lips. "Hush: not yet. Let me
tell you first why I ventured to write to you." She drew him gently
down to an arm-chair beside the divan, and herself sank orientally
into its pillows. "I thought I had exhausted all the emotions of
life. At <i>my</i> age&mdash;is it not a tragedy? But I was mistaken. It
is true that I had tried philosophy, marriage, mathematics, divorce,
sculpture and love; but I had never attempted the stage. How long it
sometimes takes to discover one's real vocation! No doubt you may
have gone through the same uncertainties yourself. At any rate, my
gift for the drama did not reveal itself till three months ago, and I
have only just completed my play, The Scarlet Cataract,' a picture of
my life, as the title suggests&mdash;and which, my friends tell me, is not
without dramatic merit. In fact, if I were to listen to them..."</p>

<p>The Professor struggled from his seat. His old fear of her madness
had returned. He began very mildly: "It is quite natural that you
should mistake me for some one else&mdash;"</p>

<p>With an inimitable gesture she waved the interruption aside. "But
what I want to explain is that, of course, the leading role can have
but one interpreter&mdash;Myself. The things happened to <i>Me</i>: who
else could possibly know how to act them? Therefore, if I appeal to
you&mdash;on my knees, Illustrious Impresario!&mdash;it is in my double
character as dramatist and trag&eacute;dienne; for in spite of
appearances my life <i>has</i> been a tragedy, as you will
acknowledge if you will let me outline its principal events in a few
words..."</p>

<p>But here she had to pause a second for breath, and the Professor,
on his feet, actually shouted his protest. "Madam, I cannot let you
go on another moment, first because I've heard the story of your life
already, and secondly because I'm not the man you suppose."</p>

<p>The Princess turned deadly pale. "Impostor!" she hissed, and
reached for an embroidered bell-rope.</p>

<p>Her agitation had the curious effect of calming the Professor.
"You had better not send me away," he said, "till you learn why I am
here. I am the unhappy man to whom, the day before yesterday, you
entrusted a hundred franc note which you asked him to stake for you
at Monte Carlo. Unfortunately I could not recall your name or
address, and I have been hunting for you through all the dressmakers'
establishments in Cannes."</p>

<p>The instant lighting-up of her face was a sight so lovely that he
almost forgot his apprehensions and his shame.</p>

<p>"The dressmakers' shops? Ah&mdash;in search of 'Betsy'! It is true, I
was obliged to act as a <i>mannequin</i> for one day; but since then
my fortunes have miraculously changed&mdash;changed thanks to you; for
now," the Princess continued with enthusiasm, "I do at last recognise
my good angel, my benefactor of the other day, and ask myself how I
could have failed to know you again, how I could have taken you for a
vulgar theatrical manager, you, a man of genius and a Philosopher.
Can you ever forgive me? For I owe you
everything&mdash;everything&mdash;everything!" she sobbed out, again almost at
his knees.</p>

<p>His self-possession continued to increase in proportion to her
agitation. He actually risked laying a hand on her arm and pressing
her mildly back among her cushions.</p>

<p>"Only a change of pronouns," he said sighing, "is necessary to the
complete accuracy of your last statement."</p>

<p>But she was off again on a new tack. "That blessed hundred franc
note! From the moment when you took it from me, as I got out of the
train, my luck miraculously and completely changed. I knew you were
going to win some money for me; but how could I have imagined the
extent of the fortune you were to heap at my feet?"</p>

<p>A cold sweat broke out over the Professor. She knew, then&mdash;once
again her infernal intuition had pierced his secret! In the train had
she not discovered his name, identified him as the author of "The
Elimination of Phenomena," and guessed that he was actually engaged
in the composition of another work? At the moment he had fancied that
there was a plausible explanation for each of these discoveries; but
he now felt that her powers of divination were in need of no outward
aid. She had risen from her seat and was once more in possession of
his hands.</p>

<p>"You have come to be thanked&mdash;and I do thank you!" Her heavy
lashes glittered with tears which threatened to merge with the drops
of moisture rolling down the Professor's agonized brow.</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;don't, I beg!" He freed himself and shrank back. "If
you'll only let me speak...let me explain..."</p>

<p>She raised a reproachful finger. "Let you belittle yourself? Let
you reject my gratitude? No&mdash;no! Nothing that you can say can make
any difference. The gipsy in the Caucasus told me long ago what you
were going to do for me. And now that you have done it you want to
stifle the thanks on my lips!"</p>

<p>"But you have nothing to thank me for. I have made no money for
you&mdash;on the contrary, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush! Such words are blasphemy. Look about you at all this
luxury, this beauty. I expected to have to leave it tomorrow. And
thanks to you, wealth has poured in on me at the moment when I
thought I was face to face with ruin."</p>

<p>"Madam, you must let me undeceive you. I don't know who can have
brought you such an erroneous report." The Professor glanced about
him in acute distress, seeking to escape from her devouring scrutiny.
"It is true that I did make a considerable sum for you, but I&mdash;I
afterward lost it. To my shame be it said."</p>

<p>The Princess hardly appeared to hear him. Tears of gratitude still
rained down her face. "Lost it? A little more, a little less&mdash;what
does it matter? In my present pecuniary situation nothing of that
sort counts. I am rich&mdash;rich for life! I should, in fact," she
continued with a gush of candour, "be an absolutely happy woman if I
could only find an impresario who would stage my play." She lifted
her enchanting eyes to his. "I wonder, by the way, dear friend," she
proposed, "if you would let me read it to you now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," the Professor protested; and then, becoming aware of
the offence his words were likely to give, he added precipitately:
"Before we turn to any other subject you must really let me tell you
just how much money I owe you, and what were the unfortunate
circumstances in which..."</p>

<p>But he was conscious that the Princess was no longer listening to
him. A new light had dawned in her face, and the glow of it was
already drying her tears. Slim, palpitating and girlish, she turned
toward one of the tall French windows opening upon the terrace.</p>

<p>"My fiance&mdash;your young compatriot! Here he is! Oh, how happy I am
to bring you together!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>The Professor followed her glance with a stare of fresh amazement.
Through the half-open window a young man in tennis flannels had
strolled into the room.</p>

<p>"My Taber," the Princess breathed, "this is my
benefactor&mdash;<i>our</i> benefactor&mdash;this is..."</p>

<p>Taber Tring gently removed the perfect arms which were already
tightening about his neck. "I know who he is," he said in a hard high
tone. "That's why I've been running away from him ever since early
this morning."</p>

<p>His good-humoured boyish face was absolutely decomposed by
distress. Without vouchsafing the least attention to the Princess he
stood pallidly but resolutely facing her visitor.</p>

<p>"I've been running for all I was worth; at least till a quarter of
an hour ago. Then I suddenly pulled up short and said to myself:
'Taber Tring, this won't do. You were born in the Middle West, but
your parents came from New England, and now's the time to prove it if
you're ever going to. Stern and rockbound coast, and <i>Mayflower</i>
and all the rest of it. If there's anything in it, it ought to come
out now.' And, by George it <i>did</i>; and here I am, ready to make
a clean breast of it."</p>

<p>He drew a silk handkerchief from his pocket, and wiped his brow,
which was as damp with agony as the Professor's. But the Professor's
patience had reached its final limit, and he was determined, whatever
happened, to hold all interrupters at bay till he had made a clean
breast of his own.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir," he said, "why you avoided my presence this
morning nor why you now seek it; but since you are connected with
this lady by so close a tie, there is no reason why I should not
continue in your presence what I had begun to tell her. I repeat
then, Madam, that with your hundred franc note in my hand, I
approached a table and staked the sum with results so unexpectedly
and incredibly favourable that I left the gaming-rooms just before
midnight in possession of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ninety-nine thousand seven hundred francs and no centimes," Taber
Tring interposed.</p>

<p>The Professor received this with a gasp of astonishment; but
everything which was happening was so foreign to all the laws of
probability as experienced at Purewater that it did not long arrest
his attention.</p>

<p>"You have stated the sum accurately," he said; "but you do not
know that I am no longer in possession of a penny of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't I?" groaned Taber Tring, wiping a fresh outbreak of
moisture from his forehead.</p>

<p>The Professor stopped short. "You do know? Ah, but to be sure. You
were yourself a fellow-boarder at <i>Arcadie</i>. You were perhaps
under its roof when that disastrous fire broke out and destroyed the
whole of the large sum of money I had so negligently left&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Under the door!" shrieked Taber Tring. "Under the door of your
room, which happened to be the one next to mine."</p>

<p>A light began to dawn on the Professor. "Is it possible that you
were the neighbour whose unseasonable agitation during the small
hours of the night caused me, in the total absence of towels or other
available material, to stuff the money in question under the crack of
the door in order to continue my intellectual labours
undisturbed?"</p>

<p>"That's me," said Taber Tring sullenly.</p>

<p>But the Princess, who had been listening to the Professor's
disquisition with a look of lovely bewilderment gradually verging on
boredom, here intervened with a sudden flash of attention.</p>

<p>"What sort of noises proceeded from my Taber's room at that
advanced hour of the night?" she inquisitorially demanded of the
Professor.</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks," said her betrothed in a weary tone. "Aren't they all
alike, every one of 'em?" He turned to the Professor. "I daresay I
<i>was</i> making a noise. I was about desperate. Stony broke, and
didn't know which way to turn next. I guess <i>you'd</i> have made a
noise in my place."</p>

<p>The Professor felt a stirring of sympathy for the stricken youth.
"I'm sorry for you&mdash;very sorry," he said. "If I had known your
situation I should have tried to master my impatience, and should
probably not have crammed the money under the door; in which case it
would not have been destroyed in the fire..."</p>

<p>("How like the reflexions of a Chinese sage!" the Princess
admiringly murmured.)</p>

<p>"Destroyed in the fire? It wasn't," said Taber Tring.</p>

<p>The Professor reeled back and was obliged to support himself upon
the nearest chair. "It wasn't?"</p>

<p>"Trust me," said the young man. "I was there, and I stole it."</p>

<p>"You stole it&mdash;his money?" The Princess instantly flung herself on
his bosom. "To save your beloved from ruin? Oh, how Christlike&mdash;how
Dostoyevskian!" She addressed herself with streaming eyes to the
Professor. "Oh, spare him, sir, for heaven's sake spare him! What
shall I do to avert your vengeance? Shall I prostitute myself in the
streets of Cannes? I will do anything to atone to you for his heroic
gesture in stealing your money&mdash;"</p>

<p>Taber Tring again put her gently aside. "Do drop it, Betsy. This
is not a woman's job. I stole that money in order to gamble with it,
and I've got to pay it back, and all that I won with it too." He
paused and faced about on the Professor. "Isn't that so, sir?" he
questioned. "I've been puzzling over it day and night for the last
two days, and I can't figure it out any other way. Hard on you,
Betsy, just as we thought our fortune was made; but my firm
conviction, Professor Hibbart, as a man of New England stock, is that
at this moment I owe you the sum of one million seven hundred and
fifty thousand francs."</p>

<p>"My God," screamed the Professor, "what system did you play?"</p>

<p>Mr. Tring's open countenance snapped shut like a steel trap.
"That's my secret," he said politely; and the Professor had to
acknowledge that it was.</p>

<p>"I must ask you," the young man pursued, "to be good enough either
to disprove or to confirm my estimate of my indebtedness to you. How
much should you consider that you owed if you had stolen anybody's
money and made a lot more with it? Only the sum stolen or the whole
amount? There's my point."</p>

<p>"But I did! I have!" cried the Professor. "Did what?"</p>

<p>"Exactly what you have done. Stole&mdash;that is, gambled with a sum of
money entrusted to me for the purpose, and won the large amount you
have correctly stated. It is true," the Professor continued, "that I
had no intention of appropriating a penny of it; but, believing that
my culpable negligence had caused the whole sum to be destroyed by
fire, I considered myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" panted Taber Tring.</p>

<p>"As indebted for the entire amount to this lady here&mdash;"</p>

<p>Taber Tring's face became illuminated with sudden
comprehension.</p>

<p>"Holy Moses I You don't mean to say all that money under the door
belonged to Betsy?"</p>

<p>"Every cent of it, in my opinion," said the Professor firmly; and
the two men stood and stared at each other.</p>

<p>"But, good gracious," the Princess intervened, "then nobody has
stolen anything!"</p>

<p>The load which had crushed the Professor to earth rolled from his
shoulders, and he lifted the head of a free man. "So it would
seem."</p>

<p>But Taber Tring could only ejaculate once again: "Holy Moses!"</p>

<p>"Then we are rich once more&mdash;is it not so, my Taber?" The Princess
leaned a thoughtful head upon her hand. "Do you know, I could almost
regret it? Yes, I regret, dear friends, that you are both blameless,
and that no sacrifice will be demanded of me. It would have been so
beautiful if you had both sinned, and I had also had to sin to save
you. But, on the other hand," she reflected, with lifted eyes and a
smile like heaven, "I shall now be able to have my play brought out
at my own expense. And for that," she cried, again possessing herself
of Professor Hibbart's hands, "for that too I have to thank you! And
this is the only way I know of doing it."</p>

<p>She flung her arms around his neck and lifted her lips to his; and
the exonerated and emancipated Professor took what she offered like a
man.</p>

<p>"And now," she cried, "for my other hero!" and caught her
betrothed to her heart. These effusions were interrupted by the
entrance of the resplendent footman, who surveyed them without
surprise or disapproval.</p>

<p>"There is at the door," he announced, "a young lady of the name of
Betsy who is asking for Monsieur." He indicated the Professor. "She
would give no other name; she said that was enough. She knows
Monsieur has been seeking her everywhere in Cannes, and she is in
despair at having missed him; but at the time she was engaged with
another client."</p>

<p>The Professor turned pale, and Taber Tring's left lid sketched a
tentative wink.</p>

<p>But the Princess intervened in her most princely manner. "Of
course! My name is Betsy, and you were seeking for <i>me</i> at all
the dressmakers'!" She turned to the footman with her smile of
benediction. "Tell the young lady," she said, "that Monsieur in his
turn is engaged with another client, who begs her to accept this
slight compensation for her trouble." She slipped from her wrist a
hoop of jade and brilliants, and the footman withdrew with the
token.</p>

<p>"And now," said the Princess, "as it is past three o'clock, we
ought really to be thinking of <i>zakouska</i>."</p>
