<h2><a name="chap1" id="chap1">I. &mdash; STORM</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE girl turned uneasily upon her cot. The fly,
bellying in the rising wind, beat noisily against the roof of the
tent. The guy ropes creaked as they tugged against their stakes.
The unfastened flaps of the tent whipped angrily. Yet in the midst
of this growing pandemonium, the sleeper did not fully awaken. The
day had been a trying one. The long, monotonous march through the
sweltering jungle had left her exhausted, as had each of the weary
marches that had preceded it through the terrible, grueling days
since she had left rail-head in that dim past that seemed now a
dull eternity of suffering.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was less exhausted physically than before, as she
was gradually becoming inured to the hardships; but the nervous
strain of the past few days had taken its toll of energy since she
had become aware of the growing insubordination of the black men
who were her only companions on this rashly conceived and illy
ordered safari.</p>

<p>Young, slight of build, accustomed to no sustained physical
effort more gruelling than a round of golf, a few sets of tennis,
or a morning canter on the back of a well-mannered mount, she had
embarked upon this mad adventure without the slightest conception
of the hardships and dangers that it would impose. Convinced almost
from the first day that her endurance might not be equal to the
heavy tax placed upon it, urged by her better judgment to turn back
before it became too late, she had sturdily, and perhaps
stubbornly, pushed on deeper and deeper into the grim jungle from
which she had long since practically given up hope of extricating
herself. Physically frail she might be for such an adventure, but
no paladin of the Round Table could have boasted a sturdier
will.</p>

<p>How compelling must be the exigency that urged her on! What
necessity strove her from the paths of luxury and ease into the
primeval forest and this unaccustomed life of danger, exposure, and
fatigue? What ungovernable urge denied her the right of self-
preservation now that she was convinced that her only chance of
survival lay in turning back? Why had she come? Not to hunt; she
had killed only under the pressure of necessity for food. Not to
photograph the wild life of the African hinterland; she possessed
no camera. Not in the interests of scientific research; if she had
ever had any scientific interest it had been directed principally
upon the field of cosmetics, but even that had languished and
expired in the face of the fierce equatorial sun and before an
audience consisting exclusively of low browed, West Africans. The
riddle, then, remains a riddle as unfathomable and inscrutable as
the level gaze of her brave grey eyes.</p>

<p>The forest bent beneath the heavy hand of Usha, the wind. Dark
clouds obscured the heavens. The voices of the jungle were
silenced. Not even the greatest of the savage beasts risked calling
the attention of the mighty forces of Nature to their presence.
Only the sudden flares of the windswept beast-fires illumined the
camp in fitful bursts that wrought grotesquely dancing
shadow-shapes from the prosaic impedimenta of the safari, scattered
upon the ground.</p>

<p>A lone and sleepy askari, bracing his back against the growing
gale, stood careless guard. The camp slept, except for him and one
other&mdash;a great hulking black, who crept stealthily toward the
tent of the sleeping girl.</p>

<p>Then the fury of the storm broke upon the crouching forest.
Lightning flashed. Thunder boomed, and rolled, and boomed again.
Rain fell. At first in great drops and then in solid, wind-sped
sheets it enveloped the camp.</p>

<p>Even the sleep of utter exhaustion could not withstand this
final assault of Nature. The girl awoke. In the vivid and almost
incessant flashes of lightning she saw a man entering the tent.
Instantly she recognized him. The great, hulking figure of Golato
the headman might not easily be mistaken for another. The girl
raised herself upon an elbow.</p>

<p>"Is there something wrong, Golato?" she asked. "What do you
want?"</p>

<p>"You, Kali Bwana," answered the man huskily.</p>

<p>So it had come at last! For two days she had been dreading it,
her fears aroused by the changed attitude of the man toward her; a
change that was reflected in the thinly veiled contempt of the
other members of her party for her orders, in the growing
familiarities of their speech and actions. She had seen it in the
man's eyes.</p>

<p>From a holster at the side of her cot she drew a revolver. "Get
out of here," she said, "or I'll kill you."</p>

<p>For answer the man leaped toward her. Then she fired.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Moving from west to east, the storm cut a swath
through the forest. In its wake lay a trail of torn and twisted
branches, here and there an uprooted tree. It sped on, leaving the
camp of the girl far behind.</p>

<p>In the dark a man crouched in the shelter of a great tree,
protected from the full fury of the wind by its hoary bole. In the
hollow of one of his arms something cuddled close to his naked hide
for warmth. Occasionally he spoke to it and caressed it with his
free hand. His gentle solicitude for it suggested that it might be
a child, but it was not. It was a small, terrified, wholly
miserable little monkey. Born into a world peopled by large, savage
creatures with a predilection for tender monkey meat he had early
developed, perhaps inherited, an inferiority feeling that had
reduced his activities to a series of screaming flights from
dangers either real or imaginary.</p>

<p>His agility, however, often imparted a certain appearance of
reckless bravado in the presence of corporeal enemies from whom
experience had taught him he could easily escape; but in the face
of Usha, the wind, Ara, the lightning, and Pand, the thunder, from
whom none might escape, he was reduced to the nadir of trembling
hopelessness. Not even the sanctuary of the mighty arms of his
master from whose safe embrace he had often thrown insults into the
face of Numa, the lion, could impart more than a fleeting sense of
security.</p>

<p>He cowered and whimpered to each new gust of wind, each flash of
lightning, each stunning burst of thunder. Suddenly the fury of the
storm rose to the pinnacle of its Titanic might; there was the
sound of rending wood from the ancient fibers of the jungle
patriarch at whose foot the two had sought shelter. Catlike, from
his squatting position, the man leaped to one side even as the
great tree crashed to earth, carrying a half dozen of its neighbors
with it. As he jumped he tossed the monkey from him, free of the
branches of the fallen monarch. He, himself, was less fortunate. A
far-spreading limb struck him heavily upon the head and, as he
fell, pinned him to the ground.</p>

<p>Whimpering, the little monkey crouched in an agony of terror
while the tornado, seemingly having wrought its worst, trailed off
toward the east and new conquests. Presently, sensing the departure
of the storm, he crept fearfully in search of his master, calling
to him plaintively from time to time. It was dark. He could see
nothing beyond a few feet from the end of his generous, sensitive
nose. His master did not answer and that filled the little monkey
with dire forebodings; but presently he found him beneath the
fallen tree, silent and lifeless.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Nyamwegi had been the life of the party in the
little thatched village of Kibbu, where he had gone from his own
village of Tumbai to court a dusky belle. His vanity flattered by
the apparent progress of his suit and by the very evident
impression that his wit and personality had made upon the company
of young people before whom he had capered and boasted, he had
ignored the passage of time until the sudden fall of the equatorial
night had warned him that he had long overstayed the time allowed
him by considerations of personal safety.</p>

<p>Several miles of grim and forbidding forest separated the
villages of Kibbu and Tumbai. They were miles fraught by night with
many dangers, not the least of which to Nyamwegi were the most
unreal, including, as they did, the ghosts of departed enemies and
the countless demons that direct the destinies of human life,
usually with malign intent.</p>

<p>He would have preferred to remain the night in Kibbu as had been
suggested by his inamorata; but there was a most excellent reason
why he could not, a reason that transcended in potency even the
soft blandishments of a sweetheart or the terrors of the jungle
night. It was a tabu that had been placed upon him by the
witch-doctor of Tumbai for some slight transgression when the
latter had discovered that, above all things, Nyamwegi would
doubtless wish to spend many nights in Kibbu village. For a price
the tabu might be lifted, a fact which doubtless had more to do
with its imposition than the sin it purported to punish; but then,
of course, the church must live&mdash;in Africa as elsewhere. The
tragedy lay in the fact that Nyamwegi did not have the price; and
tragedy indeed it proved for poor Nyamwegi.</p>

<p>On silent feet the young warrior followed the familiar trail
toward Tumbai. Lightly he carried his spear and shield, at his hip
swung a heavy knife; but of what potency were such weapons against
the demons of the night? Much more efficacious was the amulet
suspended about his neck, which he fingered often as he mumbled
prayers to his <i>muzimo</i>, the protecting spirit of the ancestor
for whom he had been named.</p>

<p>He wondered if the girl were worth the risk, and decided that
she was not.</p>

<p>Kibbu village lay a mile behind when the storm overtook
Nyamwegi. At first his anxiety to reach Tumbai and his fear of the
night urged him on despite the buffetings of the gale; but at last
he was forced to seek what shelter he could beneath a giant tree,
where he remained until the greatest fury of the elements had
subsided, though the lightning was still illuminating the forest as
he pushed on. Thus the storm became his undoing, for where he might
have passed unnoticed in the darkness the lightning revealed his
presence to whatever enemy might be lurking along the trail.</p>

<p>He was already congratulating himself that half the journey had
been accomplished when, without warning, he was seized from behind.
He felt sharp talons sink into his flesh. With a scream of pain and
terror he wheeled to extricate himself from the clutches of the
thing that had seized him, the terrifying, voiceless thing that
made no sound. For an instant he succeeded in breaking the hold
upon his shoulders and as he turned, reaching for his knife, the
lightning flashed, revealing to his horrified eyes a hideous human
face surmounted by the head of a leopard.</p>

<p>Nyamwegi struck out blindly with his knife in the ensuing
darkness, and simultaneously he was seized again from behind by
rending talons that sank into his chest and abdomen as the creature
encircled him with hairy arms. Again vivid lightning brought into
high relief the tragic scene. Nyamwegi could not see the creature
that gripped him from behind; but he saw three others menacing him
in front and on either side, and he abandoned hope as he recognized
his assailants, from their leopard skins and masks, as members of
the feared secret order of Leopard Men.</p>

<p>Thus died Nyamwegi the Utengan.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">II. &mdash; THE HUNTER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE dawn-light danced among the tree tops above
the grass-thatched huts of the village of Tumbai as the chief's
son, Orando, arose from his crude pallet of straw and stepped out
into the village street to make an offering to his <i>muzimo</i>,
the spirit of the long dead ancestor for whom he had been named,
preparatory to setting out upon a day of hunting. In his
outstretched palm he held an offering of fine meal as he stood like
an ebony statue, his face upturned toward the heavens.</p>

<p>"My namesake, let us go to the hunt together." He spoke as one
might who addresses a familiar but highly revered friend. "Bring
the animals near to me and ward off from me all danger. Give me
meat today, oh, hunter!"</p>

<p>The trail that Orando followed as he set forth alone to hunt was
for a couple of miles the same that led to Kibbu village. It was an
old, familiar trail; but the storm of the preceding night had
wrought such havoc with it that in many places it was as
unrecognizable as it was impassable. Several times fallen trees
forced him to make detours into the heavy underbrush that often
bordered the trail upon each side. It was upon such an occasion
that his attention was caught by the sight of a human leg
protruding from beneath the foliage of a newly uprooted tree.</p>

<p>Orando halted in his tracks and drew back. There was a movement
of the foliage where the man lay. The warrior poised his light
hunting spear, yet at the same time he was ready for instant
flight. He had recognized the bronzed flesh as that of a white man,
and Orando, the son of Lobongo, the chief, knew no white man as
friend. Again the foliage moved, and the head of a diminutive
monkey was thrust through the tangled verdure.</p>

<p>As its frightened eyes discovered the man the little creature
voiced a scream of fright and disappeared beneath the foliage of
the fallen tree, only to reappear again a moment later upon the
opposite side where it climbed up into the branches of a jungle
giant that had successfully withstood the onslaughts of the storm.
Here, far above the ground, in fancied security, the small one
perched upon a swaying limb and loosed the vilest of its wrath upon
Orando.</p>

<p>But the hunter accorded it no further attention. Today he was
not hunting little monkeys, and for the moment his interest was
focused upon the suggestion of tragedy contained in that single,
bronzed leg. Creeping cautiously forward, Orando stooped to look
beneath the great mass of limbs and leaves that concealed the rest
of the body from his view, for he must satisfy his curiosity.</p>

<p>He saw a giant white man, naked but for a loin cloth of leopard
skin, pinned to the ground by one of the branches of the fallen
tree. From the face turned toward him two grey eyes surveyed him;
the man was not dead.</p>

<p>Orando had seen but few white men; and those that he had seen
had worn strange, distinctive apparel. They had carried weapons
that vomited smoke, and flame, and metal. This one was clothed as
any native warrior might have been, nor was there visible any of
those weapons that Orando hated and feared.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the stranger was white and, therefore, an enemy. It
was possible that he might extricate himself from his predicament
and, if he did, become a menace to the village of Tumbai.
Naturally, therefore, there was but one thing for a warrior and the
son of a chief to do. Orando fitted an arrow to his bow. The
killing of this man meant no more to him than would have the
killing of the little monkey.</p>

<p>"Come around to the other side," said the stranger; "your arrow
cannot reach my heart from that position."</p>

<p>Orando dropped the point of his missile and surveyed the speaker
in surprise, which was engendered, not so much by the nature of his
command, as by the fact that he had spoken in the dialect of
Orando's own people.</p>

<p>"You need not fear me," continued the man, noticing Orando's
hesitation; "I am held fast by this branch and cannot harm
you."</p>

<p>What sort of man was this? Had he no fear of death? Most men
would have begged for their lives. Perhaps this one sought
death.</p>

<p>"Are you badly injured?" demanded Orando.</p>

<p>"I think not. I feel no pain."</p>

<p>"Then why do you wish to die?"</p>

<p>"I do not wish to die."</p>

<p>"But you told me to come around and shoot you in the heart. Why
did you say that if you do not wish to die?"</p>

<p>"I know that you are going to kill me. I asked you, to make sure
that your first arrow enters my heart. Why should I suffer pain
needlessly?"</p>

<p>"And you are not afraid to die?"</p>

<p>"I do not know what you mean."</p>

<p>"You do not know what fear is?"</p>

<p>"I know the word, but what has it to do with death? All things
die. Were you to tell me that I must live forever, then I might
feel fear."</p>

<p>"How is it that you speak the language of the Utengas?" demanded
Orando.</p>

<p>The man shook his head. "I do not know."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Orando's perplexity was gradually becoming tinged
with awe.</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied the stranger.</p>

<p>"From what country do you come?"</p>

<p>Again the man shook his head. "I do not know."</p>

<p>"What will you do if I release you?"</p>

<p>"And do not kill me?" queried the white.</p>

<p>"No, not kill you."</p>

<p>The man shrugged. "What is there to do? I shall hunt for food
because I am hungry. Then I shall find a place to lie up and
sleep."</p>

<p>"You will not kill me?"</p>

<p>"Why should I? If you do not try to kill me I shall not try to
kill you."</p>

<p>The warrior wormed his way through the tangled branches of the
fallen tree to the side of the pinioned white man, where he found
that a single branch resting across the latter's body prevented the
prisoner from getting his arms, equipped with giant muscles, into
any position where he might use them effectively for his release.
It proved, however, a comparatively easy matter for Orando to raise
the limb the few inches necessary to permit the stranger to worm
his body from beneath it, and a moment later the two men faced one
another beside the fallen tree while a little monkey chattered and
grimaced from the safety of the foliage above them.</p>

<p>Orando felt some doubt as to the wisdom of his rash act. He
could not satisfactorily explain what had prompted him to such
humane treatment of a stranger, yet despite his doubts something
seemed to assure him that he had acted wisely. However, he held his
spear in readiness and watched the white giant before him with a
cautious eye.</p>

<p>From beneath the tree that had held him prisoner the man
recovered his weapons, a bow and spear. Over one shoulder hung a
quiver of arrows; across the other was coiled a long, fiber rope. A
knife swung in a sheath at his hip. His belongings recovered, he
turned to Orando.</p>

<p>"Now, we hunt," agreed Orando.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"I know where the pigs feed in the morning and where they lie up
in the heat of the day," said Orando.</p>

<p>As they spoke Orando had been appraising the stranger. He noted
the clean-cut features, the magnificent physique. The flowing
muscles that rolled beneath a skin sun-tanned almost to the hue of
his own impressed him by their suggestion of agility and speed
combined with great strength. A shock of black hair partially
framed a face of rugged, masculine beauty from which two steady,
grey eyes surveyed the world fearlessly. Over the left temple was a
raw gash (legacy of the storm's fury) from which blood had flowed,
and dried in the man's hair and upon his cheek. In moments of
silence his brows were often drawn together in thought, and there
was a puzzled expression in his eyes. At such times he impressed
Orando as one who sought to recall something he had forgotten; but
what it was, the man did not divulge.</p>

<p>Orando led the way along the trail that still ran in the
direction of Kibbu village. Behind him came his strange companion
upon feet so silent that the black occasionally cast a backward
glance to assure himself that the white man had not deserted him.
Close above them the little monkey swung through the trees,
chattering and jabbering.</p>

<p>Presently Orando heard another voice directly behind him that
sounded like another monkey speaking in lower tones than those of
the little fellow above them. He turned his head to see where the
other monkey, sounding so close, could be. To his astonishment he
saw that the sounds issued from the throat of the man behind him.
Orando laughed aloud. Never before had he seen a man who could
mimic the chattering of monkeys so perfectly. Here, indeed, was an
accomplished entertainer.</p>

<p>But Orando's hilarity was short-lived. It died when he saw the
little monkey leap nimbly from an over-hanging branch to the
shoulder of the white man and heard the two chattering to one
another, obviously carrying on a conversation.</p>

<p>What sort of man was this, who knew no fear, who could speak the
language of the monkeys, who did not know who he was, nor where he
came from? This question, which he could not answer, suggested
another equally unanswerable, the mere consideration of which
induced within Orando qualms of uneasiness. <i>Was this creature a
mortal man at all?</i></p>

<p>This world into which Orando had been born was peopled by many
creatures, not the least important and powerful of which were those
that no man ever saw, but which exercised the greatest influence
upon those one might see. There were demons so numerous that one
might not count them all, and the spirits of the dead who more
often than not were directed by demons whose purposes, always
malign, they carried out. These demons and sometimes the spirits of
the dead occasionally took possession of the body of a living
creature, controlling its thoughts, its actions and its speech.
Why, right in the river that flowed past the village of Tumbai
dwelt a demon to which the villagers had made offerings of food for
many years. It had assumed the likeness of a crocodile, but it had
deceived no one; least of all the old witch-doctor who had
recognized it immediately for what it was after the chief had
threatened him with death when his charms had failed to frighten it
away or his amulets to save villagers from its voracious jaws. It
was easy, therefore, for Orando to harbor suspicions concerning the
creature moving noiselessly at his heels.</p>

<p>A feeling of uneasiness pervaded the son of the chief. This was
somewhat mitigated by the consciousness that he had treated the
creature in a friendly way and, perhaps, earned its approbation.
How fortunate it was that he had reconsidered his first intention
of loosing an arrow into its body! That would have been fatal; not
for the creature but for Orando. It was quite obvious now why the
stranger had not feared death, knowing that, being a demon, it
could not die. Slowly it was all becoming quite clear to the black
hunter, but he did not know whether to be elated or terrified. To
be the associate of a demon might be a distinction, but it also had
its distressing aspects. One never knew what a demon might be
contemplating, though it was reasonably certain to be nothing
good.</p>

<p>Orando's further speculations along this line were rudely
interrupted by a sight that met his horrified gaze at a turning of
the trail. Before his eyes lay the dead and mutilated body of a
warrior. The hunter required no second glance to recognize in the
upturned face the features of his friend and comrade, Nyamwegi. But
how had he come to his death?</p>

<p>The stranger came and stood at Orando's side, the little monkey
perched upon his shoulder. He stooped and examined the body of
Nyamwegi, turning the corpse over upon its face, revealing the
cruel marks of steel claws.</p>

<p>"The Leopard Men," he remarked briefly and without emotion, as
one might utter the most ordinary commonplace.</p>

<p>But Orando was bursting with emotion. Immediately when he had
seen the body of his friend he had thought of the Leopard Men,
though he had scarcely dared to acknowledge his own thought, so
fraught with terror was the very suggestion. Deeply implanted in
his mind was fear of this dread secret society, the weird
cannibalistic rites of which seemed doubly horrible because they
could only be guessed at, no man outside their order ever having
witnessed them and lived.</p>

<p>He saw the characteristic mutilation of the corpse, the parts
cut away for the cannibalistic orgy, of which they would be the
<i>pièce de résistance</i>. Orando saw and shuddered; but, though
he shuddered, in his heart was more of rage than of fear. Nyamwegi
had been his friend. From infancy they had grown to manhood
together. Orando's soul cried out for vengeance against the fiends
who had perpetrated this vile outrage, but what could one man do
alone against many? The maze of footsteps in the soft earth about
the corpse indicated that Nyamwegi had been overcome by
numbers.</p>

<p>The stranger, leaning on his spear, had been silently watching
the warrior, noting the signs of grief and rage reflected in the
mobile features.</p>

<p class="caption">The stranger, leaning on his spear, had been
silently watching the warrior.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"You knew him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He was my friend."</p>

<p>The stranger made no comment, but turned and followed a trail
that ran toward the south. Orando hesitated. Perhaps the demon was
leaving him. Well, in a way that would be a relief; but, after all,
he had not been a bad demon, and certainly there was something
about him that inspired confidence and a sense of security. Then,
too, it was something to be able to fraternize with a demon and,
perhaps, to show him off in the village. Orando followed.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" he called after the retreating figure of
the giant white.</p>

<p>"To punish those who killed your friend."</p>

<p>"But they are many," remonstrated Orando. "They will kill
us."</p>

<p>"They are four," replied the stranger. "<i>I</i> kill."</p>

<p>"How do you know there are but four?" demanded the black.</p>

<p>The other pointed to the trail at his feet. "One is old and
limps," he said; "one is tall and thin; the other two are young
warriors. They step lightly, although one of them is a large
man.</p>

<p>"You have seen them?"</p>

<p>"I have seen their spoor; that is enough."</p>

<p>Orando was impressed. Here, indeed, was a tracker of the first
order; but perhaps he possessed something of a higher order than
human skill. The thought thrilled Orando; but if it caused him a
little fear, too, he no longer hesitated. He had cast his lot, and
he would not turn back now.</p>

<p>"At least we can see where they go," he said. "We can follow
them to their village, and afterward we can return to Tumbai, where
my father, the chief, lives. He will send runners through the
Watenga country; and the war drums will boom, summoning the Utenga
warriors. Then will we go and make war upon the village of the
Leopard Men, that Nyamwegi may be avenged in blood."</p>

<p>The stranger only grunted and trotted on. Sometimes Orando, who
was rated a good tracker by his fellows, saw no spoor at all; but
the white demon never paused, never hesitated. The warrior
marvelled and his admiration grew; likewise his awe. He had leisure
to think now, and the more he thought the more convinced he was
that this was no mortal who guided him through the jungle upon the
trail of the Leopard Men. If it were, indeed, a demon, then it was
a most remarkable demon, for by no word or sign had it indicated
any malign purpose. It was then, engendered by this line of
reasoning, that a new and brilliant thought illuminated the mind of
Orando like a bright light bursting suddenly through darkness. This
creature, being nothing mortal, must be the protecting spirit of
that departed ancestor for whom Orando had been named&mdash;his
<i>muzimo!</i></p>

<p>Instantly all fear left the warrior. Here was a friend and a
protector. Here was the very <i>namesake</i> whose aid he had
invoked before setting out upon the hunt, he whom he had
propitiated with a handful of meal. Suddenly Orando regretted that
the offering had not been larger. A handful of meal seemed quite
inadequate to appease the hunger of the powerful creature trotting
tirelessly ahead of him, but perhaps <i>muzimos</i> required less
food than mortals. That seemed quite reasonable, since they were
but spirits. Yet Orando distinctly recalled that before he had
released the creature from beneath the tree it had stated that it
wished to hunt for food as it was hungry. Oh, well, perhaps there
were many things concerning <i>muzimos</i> that Orando did not
know; so why trouble his head about details? It was enough that
this must be his <i>muzimo.</i> He wondered if the little monkey
perched upon his <i>muzimo's</i> shoulder was also a spirit.
Perhaps it was Nyamwegi's ghost. Were not the two very friendly, as
he and Nyamwegi had been throughout their lives? The thought
appealed to Orando, and henceforth he thought of the little monkey
as Nyamwegi. Now it occurred to him to test his theory concerning
the white giant.</p>

<p>"Muzimo!" he called.</p>

<p>The stranger turned his head and looked about. "Why did you call
<i>'muzimo'?"</i> he demanded.</p>

<p>"I was calling you, Muzimo," replied Orando.</p>

<p>"Is that what you call me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>Now Orando was convinced that he had made no mistake. What a
fortunate man he was! How his fellows would envy him!</p>

<p>"Why did you call to me?" insisted the other.</p>

<p>"Do you think we are close to the Leopard Men, Muzimo?" inquired
Orando, for want of any better question to ask.</p>

<p>"We are gaining on them, but the wind is in the wrong direction.
I do not like to track with the wind at my back, for then Usha can
run ahead and tell those I am tracking that I am on their
trail."</p>

<p>"What can we do about it?" demanded Orando. "The wind will not
change for me, but perhaps you can make it blow in a different
direction."</p>

<p>"No," replied the other, "but I can fool Usha, the wind. That I
often do. When I am hunting up wind I can remain on the ground in
safety, for then Usha can only carry tales to those behind me, for
whom I care nothing; but when I hunt down wind I travel through the
trees, and Usha carries my scent spoor above the head of my quarry.
Or sometimes I move swiftly and circle the hunted one, and then
Usha comes down to my nostrils and tells me where it is. Come!" The
stranger swung lightly to the low-hanging branch of a great
tree.</p>

<p>"Wait!" cried Orando. "I cannot travel through the trees."</p>

<p>"Go upon the ground, then. I will go ahead through the trees and
find the Leopard Men."</p>

<p>Orando would have argued the wisdom of this plan; but the white
disappeared amidst the foliage, the little monkey clinging tightly
to its perch upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"That," thought Orando, "is the last that I shall see of my
<i>muzimo.</i> When I tell this in the village they will not
believe me. They will say that Orando is a great liar."</p>

<p>Plain before him now lay the trail of the Leopard Men. It would
be easy to follow; but, again, what could one man hope to
accomplish against four, other than his own death? Yet Orando did
not think of turning back. Perhaps he could not, alone, wreak his
vengeance upon the slayers of Nyamwegi; but he could, at least,
track them to their village, and later lead the warriors of
Lobongo, the chief, his father, in battle against it.</p>

<p>The black warrior moved tirelessly in a rhythmic trot that
consumed the miles with stubborn certainty, relieving the monotony
by reviewing the adventures of the morning. Thoughts of his
<i>muzimo</i> occupied his mind almost to the exclusion of other
subjects. Such an adventure was without parallel in the experience
of Orando, and he enjoyed dwelling upon every phase of it. He
recalled, almost with the pride of personal possession, the prowess
of this other self of his from the spirit world. Its every
mannerism and expression was photographed indelibly upon his
memory; but that which impressed him most was an indefinable
something in the steel-grey eyes, a haunting yearning that
suggested a constant effort to recall an illusive memory.</p>

<p>What was his <i>muzimo</i> trying to recall? Perhaps it was the
details of his earthly existence. Perchance he sought to conjure
once again the reactions of the flesh to worldly stimuli. Doubtless
he regretted his spirit state and longed to live again&mdash;to
live and fight and love.</p>

<p>With such thoughts as their accompaniment the miles retreated
beneath his pounding feet. With such thoughts his mind was occupied
to the exclusion of matters which should have concerned him more.
For instance, he did not note how fresh the spoor of his quarry had
become. In puddles left by the rain of the previous night and
roiled by the passage of feet the mud had not yet settled when
Orando passed; in places the earth at the edges of footprints was
still falling back into the depressions; but these things Orando
failed to note, though he was accounted a good tracker. It is well
that a man should keep his mind concentrated upon a single thing at
a time unless he has a far more elastic mind than Orando. One may
not dream too long in the savage jungle.</p>

<p>When Orando came suddenly into a small, natural clearing he
failed to notice a slight movement of the surrounding jungle
foliage. Had he, he would have gone more cautiously; and doubtless
his jungle-craft would have suggested the truth, even though he
could not have seen the four pairs of greedy, malevolent eyes that
watched him from behind the concealing verdure; but when he reached
the center of the clearing he saw all that he should have guessed
before, as, with savage cries, four hideously caparisoned warriors
leaped into the open and sprang toward him.</p>

<p>Never before had Orando, the son of Lobongo, seen one of the
feared and hated members of the dread society of Leopard Men; but
as his eyes fell upon these four there was no room for doubt as to
their identity. And then they closed upon him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">III. &mdash; DEAD MEN WHO SPOKE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS the girl fired, Golato voiced a cry of pain,
wheeled and dashed from the tent, his left hand grasping his right
arm above the elbow. Then Kali Bwana arose and dressed, strapping a
cartridge belt, with its holster and gun, about her hips. There
could be no more thought of sleep that night, for even though
Golato might be <i>hors de combat</i> there were others to be
feared almost as much as he.</p>

<p>She lighted a lantern and, seated in a camp-chair with her rifle
across her knees, prepared to spend the remainder of the night in
wakeful watching; but if she anticipated any further molestation
she was agreeably disappointed. The night dragged its interminable
length until outraged Nature could be no longer denied, and
presently the girl dozed in her chair.</p>

<p>When she awoke the new sun was an hour old. The storm had passed
leaving only mud and soggy canvas in its wake to mark its passage
across the camp. The girl stepped to the flap of her tent and
called to her boy to prepare her bath and her breakfast. She saw
the porters preparing the loads. She saw Golato, his arm roughly
bandaged and supported in a crude sling. She saw her boy and called
to him again, this time peremptorily; but he ignored her summons
and went on with the roping of a pack. Then she crossed over to
him, her eyes flashing.</p>

<p>"You heard me call you, Imba," she said. "Why did you not come
and prepare my bath and my breakfast?"</p>

<p>The fellow, a middle-aged man of sullen demeanor, scowled and
hung his head. Golato, surly and glowering, looked on. The other
members of the safari had stopped their work and were watching, and
among them all there was not a friendly eye.</p>

<p>"Answer me, Imba," commanded the girl. "Why do you refuse to
obey me?"</p>

<p>"Golato is headman," was the surly rejoinder. "He gives orders.
Imba obey Golato."</p>

<p>"Imba obeys me," snapped Kali Bwana. "Golato is no longer
headman." She drew her gun from its holster and let the muzzle drop
on Imba. "Get my bath ready. Last night it was dark. I could not
see well, so I only shot Golato in the arm. This morning I can see
to shoot straighter. Now move!"</p>

<p>Imba cast an imploring glance in the direction of Golato, but
the ex-headman gave him no encouragement. Here was a new Kali
Bwana, bringing new conditions, to which Golato's slow mind had not
yet adapted itself. Imba moved sheepishly toward the tent of his
mistress. The other blacks muttered in low tones among
themselves.</p>

<p>Kali Bwana had found herself, but it was too late. The seeds of
discontent and mutiny were too deeply sown; they had already
germinated, and although she might wrest a fleeting victory the end
could bring only defeat. She had the satisfaction, however, of
seeing Imba prepare her bath and, later, her breakfast; but while
she was eating the latter she saw her porters up-loading,
preparatory to departure, although her own tent had not been
struck, nor had she given any orders for marching.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" she demanded, walking quickly to
where the men were gathered. She did not address Golato, but
another who had been his lieutenant and whom she had intended
appointing headman in his place.</p>

<p>"We are going back," replied the man.</p>

<p>"You cannot go back and leave me alone," she insisted.</p>

<p>"You may come with us," said the black. "But you will have to
look after yourself," he added.</p>

<p>"You shall not do anything of the sort," cried the girl,
thoroughly exasperated. "You agreed to accompany me wherever I
went. Put down your loads, and wait until you get marching orders
from me."</p>

<p>As the men hesitated she drew her revolver. It was then that
Golato interfered. He approached her with the askaris, their rifles
ready. "Shut up, woman," he snarled, "and get back to your tent. We
are going back to our own country. If you had been good to Golato
this would not have happened; but you were not, and this is your
punishment. If you try to stop us these men will kill you. You may
come with us, but you will give no orders. Golato is master
now."</p>

<p>"I shall not go with you, and if you desert me here you know
what your punishment will be when I get back to rail-head and
report the matter to the commissioner."</p>

<p>"You will never get back," replied Golato sullenly. Then he
turned to the waiting porters and gave the command to march.</p>

<p>It was with sinking heart that the girl saw the party file from
camp and disappear in the forest. She might have followed, but
pride had a great deal to do with crystallizing her decision not
to. Likewise, her judgment assured her that she would be far from
safe with this sullen, mutinous band at whose head was as great a
menace to her personal safety as she might find in all Africa.
Again, there was the pertinacity of purpose that had kept her
forging ahead upon her hopeless mission long after mature judgment
had convinced her of its futility. Perhaps it was no more than
ordinary stubbornness; but whatever it was it held her to what she
conceived to be her duty, even though it led to what she now knew
must be almost certain death.</p>

<p>Wearily she turned back toward her tent and the single load of
provisions they had left behind for her sustenance. What was she to
do? She could not go on, and she would not go back. There was but a
single alternative. She must remain here, establishing a permanent
camp as best she could, and await the remotely possible relief
party that might come after long, long months.</p>

<p>She was confident that her safari could not return to
civilization without her and not arouse comment and investigation;
and when investigation was made some one at least among all those
ignorant porters would divulge the truth. Then there would be a
searching party organized unless Golato succeeded with his lying
tongue in convincing them that she was already dead. There was a
faint hope, however, and to that she would cling. If, perchance,
she could cling to life also during the long wait she might be
saved at the last.</p>

<p>Taking stock of the provisions that the men had left behind for
her, she found that she had enough upon which to subsist for a
month, provided that she exercised scrupulous economy in their use.
If game proved plentiful and her hunting was successful, this time
might be indefinitely prolonged. Starvation, however, was not the
only menace that she apprehended nor the most dreaded. There were
prowling carnivores against which she had little defense to offer.
There was the possibility of discovery by unfriendly blacks. There
was always the danger (and this she dreaded most) of being stricken
by one of the deadly jungle fevers.</p>

<p>She tried to put such thoughts from her mind, and to do so she
occupied herself putting her camp in order, dragging everything
perishable into her tent and, finally, commencing the construction
of a crude boma as a protection against the prowlers of the night.
The work was fatiguing, necessitating frequent rests, during which
she wrote in her diary, to which she confided nothing of the fears
that assailed her, fears that she dreaded admitting, even to
herself. Instead, she confined herself to a narration of the events
of the past few days since she had written. Thus she occupied her
time as Fate marshalled the forces that were presently to drag her
into a situation more horrible than any that she could possibly
have conceived.</p>

<p><br>
As the four, clothed in the leopard skins of their order, closed
upon Orando there flashed to the mind of the son of the chief a
vision of the mutilated corpse of his murdered friend; and in that
mental picture he saw a prophecy of his own fate; but he did not
flinch. He was a warrior, with a duty to perform. These were the
murderers of his comrade, the enemies of his people. He would die,
of that he was certain; but first he would avenge Nyamwegi. The
enemy should feel the weight of the wrath of a Utenga
fighting-man.</p>

<p>The four Leopard Men were almost upon him as he launched his
spear. With a scream one of the foemen dropped, pierced by the
sharp tip of the Utenga's weapon. Fortunate it was for Orando that
the methods of the Leopard Men prescribed the use of their
improvised steel claws as weapons in preference to spears or
arrows, which they resorted to only in extremities or when faced by
superior numbers. The flesh for their unholy rites must die beneath
their leopard claws, or it was useless for religious purposes.
Maddened by fanaticism, they risked death to secure the coveted
trophies. To this Orando owed the slender chance he had to overcome
his antagonists. But at best the respite from death could be but
brief.</p>

<p>The remaining three pressed closer, preparing for the lethal
charge in simulation of the carnivore they personified. Silence
enveloped the jungle, as though Nature awaited with bated breath
the consummation of this savage tragedy. Suddenly the quiet was
shattered by the scream of a monkey in a tree overhanging the
clearing. The sound came from behind Orando. He saw two opponents
who were facing him dart startled glances beyond him. He heard a
scream that forced his attention rearward in a brief glance, and
what he saw brought the sudden joy of an unexpected reprieve from
death. In the grasp of his <i>muzimo,</i> the third of the
surviving Leopard Men was struggling impotently against death.</p>

<p>Then Orando wheeled again to face his remaining enemies, while,
from behind him, came savage growls that stiffened the hairs upon
his scalp. What new force had been thus suddenly injected into the
grim scene? He could not guess, nor could he again risk even a
brief backward glance. His whole attention was now required by the
hideous creatures sneaking toward him, their curved, steel talons
opened, claw-like, to seize him.</p>

<p>The action that is so long in the telling occupied but a few
seconds of actual time. A shriek mingled with the growls that
Orando had heard. The Leopard Men leaped swiftly toward him. A
figure brushed past him from the rear and, with a savage growl,
leaped upon the foremost Leopard Man. It was Orando's
<i>muzimo.</i> The heart of the warrior missed a beat as he
realized that those beast-like sounds had issued from the throat of
his <i>namesake.</i> But if the fact perturbed Orando it utterly
demoralized the fourth antagonist who had been advancing upon him,
with the result that the fellow wheeled and bolted for the jungle,
leaving the sole survivor of his companions to his fate.</p>

<p>Orando was free now to come to the aid of his <i>muzimo</i>, who
was engaged with the larger of the two younger Leopard Men; but he
quickly realized that his <i>muzimo</i> required no aid. In a grip
of steel he held the two clawed hands, while his free hand grasped
the throat of his antagonist. Slowly but as inexorably as Fate he
was choking the life from the struggling black-man. Gradually his
victim's efforts grew weaker, until suddenly, with a convulsive
shudder, the body went limp. Then he cast it aside. For a moment he
stood gazing at it, a puzzled expression upon his face; and then,
apparently mechanically, he advanced slowly to its side and placed
a foot upon it. The reaction was instantaneous and remarkable.
Doubt and hesitation were suddenly swept from the noble features of
the giant to be replaced by an expression of savage exultation as
he lifted his face to the heavens and gave voice to a cry so
awesome that Orando felt his knees tremble beneath him.</p>

<p>The Utenga had heard that cry before, far in the depths of the
forest, and knew it for what it was; the victory cry of the bull
ape. But why was his <i>muzimo</i> voicing the cry of a beast? Here
was something that puzzled Orando quite as much as had the
materialization of this ancestral spirit. There had never been any
doubt in his mind as to the existence of <i>muzimos.</i> Everyone
possessed a <i>muzimo</i>; but there were certain attributes that
all men attributed to <i>muzimos,</i> and all these were human
attributes. Never in his life had Orando heard it even vaguely
hinted that <i>muzimos</i> growled like Simba, the lion, or
screamed as the bull apes scream when they have made a kill. He was
troubled and puzzled. Could it be that his <i>muzimo</i> was also
the <i>muzimo</i> of some dead lion and departed ape? And if such
were the case might it not be possible that, when actuated by the
spirit of the lion or the ape, instead of by that of Orando's
ancestor, he would become a menace instead of a blessing?</p>

<p>Suspiciously, now, Orando watched his companion, noting with
relief the transition of the savage facial expression to that of
quiet dignity that normally marked his mien. He saw the little
monkey that had fled to the trees during the battle return to the
shoulder of the <i>muzimo,</i> and considering this an accurate
gauge of the latter's temper he approached, though with some
trepidation.</p>

<p>"Muzimo," he ventured timidly, "you came in time and saved the
life of Orando. It is yours."</p>

<p>The white was silent. He seemed to be considering this
statement. The strange, half bewildered expression returned to his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Now I remember," he said presently. "You saved my life. That
was a long time ago."</p>

<p>"It was this morning, Muzimo."</p>

<p>The white man shook his head and passed a palm across his
brow.</p>

<p>"This morning," he repeated thoughtfully. "Yes, and we were
going to hunt. I am hungry. Let us hunt."</p>

<p>"Shall we not follow the one who escaped?" demanded Orando. "We
were going to track the Leopard Men to their village, that my
father, the chief, might lead the Utengas against it."</p>

<p>"First let us speak with the dead men," said Muzimo. "We shall
see what they have to tell us."</p>

<p>"You can speak with the dead?" Orando's voice trembled at the
suggestion.</p>

<p>"The dead do not speak with words," explained Muzimo; "but
nevertheless they often have stories to tell. We shall see. This
one," he continued, after a brief inspection of the corpse of the
man he had killed last, "is the larger of the two young men. There
lies the tall thin man, and yonder, with your spear through his
heart, is he who limped, an old man with a crippled leg. These
three, then, have told us that he who escaped is the smaller of the
two young men."</p>

<p>Now, more carefully, he examined each of the corpses, noting
their weapons and their ornaments, dumping the contents of their
pouches upon the ground. These he scanned carefully, paying
particular attention to the amulets, of the dead men. In a large
package carried by the crippled old man, he found parts of a human
body.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt now but that these were the killers of
Nyamwegi," said Orando; "for these are the same parts that were
removed from his body."</p>

<p>"There was never any doubt," asserted Muzimo confidently. "The
dead men did not have to tell me that."</p>

<p>"What have they told you, Muzimo?"</p>

<p>"Their filed teeth have told me that they are eaters of men;
their amulets and the contents of their pouches have told me that
their village lies upon the banks of a large river. They are
fishermen; and they fear Gimla, the crocodile, more than they fear
aught else. The hooks in their pouches tell me the one and their
amulets the other. From their ornaments and weapons, by the
cicatrices upon their foreheads and chins I know their tribe and
the country it inhabits. I do not need to follow the young warrior;
his friends have told me where he is going. Now we may hunt. Later
we can go to the village of the Leopard Men."</p>

<p>"Even as I prayed today before setting out from the village, you
have protected me from danger," observed Orando, "and now, if you
bring the animals near to me and give me meat, all of my prayer
will have been fulfilled."</p>

<p>"The animals go where they will," responded Muzimo. "I cannot
lead them to you, but I can lead you to them; and when you are
near, then, perhaps, I can frighten them toward you. Come."</p>

<p>He turned backward along the trail down which they had followed
the Leopard Men and fell into an easy trot, while Orando followed,
his eyes upon the broad shoulders of his <i>muzimo</i> and the
spirit of Nyamwegi, perched upon one of them. Thus they continued
silently for a half hour, when Muzimo halted.</p>

<p>"Move forward slowly and cautiously," he directed. "The scent
spoor of Wappi, the antelope, has grown strong in my nostrils. I go
ahead through the trees to get upon the other side of him. When he
catches my scent he will move away from me toward you. Be
ready."</p>

<p>Scarcely had Muzimo ceased speaking before he disappeared amidst
the overhanging foliage of the forest, leaving Orando filled with
wonder and admiration, with which was combined overweening pride in
his possession of a <i>muzimo</i> such as no other man might boast.
He hoped that the hunting would be quickly concluded that he might
return to the village of Tumbai and bask in the admiration and envy
of his fellows as he nonchalantly paraded his new and wondrous
acquisition before their eyes. It was something, of course, to be a
chief's son, just as it was something to be a chief or a
witch-doctor; but to possess a <i>muzimo</i> that one might see and
talk to and hunt with&mdash;ah, that was glory transcending any
that might befall mortal man.</p>

<p>Suddenly Orando's gloating thoughts were interrupted by a slight
sound of something approaching along the trail from the direction
in which he was moving. Just the suggestion of a sound it was, but
to the ears of the jungle hunter it was sufficient. You or I could
not have heard it; nor, hearing it, could we have interpreted it;
but to Orando it bore a message as clear to his ears as is the
message of a printed page to our eyes. It told him that a hoofed
animal was approaching him, walking quickly, though not yet in full
flight. A turn in the trail just ahead of him concealed him from
the view of the approaching animal. Orando grasped his spear more
firmly, and stepped behind the bole of a small tree that partially
hid him from the sight of any creature coming toward him. There he
stood, motionless as a bronze statue, knowing that motion and scent
are the two most potent stimuli to fear in the lower orders. What
wind there was moved from the unseen animal toward the man,
precluding the possibility of his scent reaching the nostrils of
the hunted; and as long as Orando did not move, the animal, he
knew, would come fearlessly until it was close enough to catch his
scent, which would be well within spear range.</p>

<p>A moment later there came into view one of those rarest of
African animals, an okapi. Orando had never before seen one of
them, for they ranged much farther to the west than the Watenga
country. He noted the giraffe-like markings on the hind quarters
and forelegs; but the short neck deceived him, and he still thought
that it was an antelope. He was all excitement now, for here was
real meat and plenty of it, the animal being larger than an
ordinary cow. The blood raced through the hunter's veins, but
outwardly he was calm. There must be no bungling now; every
movement must be perfectly timed&mdash;a step out into the trail
and, simultaneously, the casting of the spear, the two motions
blending into each other as though there was but one.</p>

<p>At that instant the okapi wheeled to flee. Orando had not moved,
there had been no disturbing sound audible to the ears of the man;
yet something had frightened the quarry just a fraction of a second
too soon. Orando was disgusted. He leaped into the trail to cast
his spear, in the futile hope that it might yet bring down his
prey; and as he raised his arm he witnessed a scene that left him
gaping in astonishment.</p>

<p>From the trees above the okapi, a creature launched itself onto
the back of the terrified animal. It was Muzimo. From his throat
rumbled a low growl. Orando stood spellbound. He saw the okapi
stumble and falter beneath the weight of the savage man- beast.
Before it could recover itself a hand shot out and grasped it by
the muzzle. Then steel thews wrenched the head suddenly about, so
that the vertebrae of the neck snapped. An instant later a keen
knife had severed the jugular, and as the blood gushed from the
carcass Orando heard again the victory cry of the bull-ape.
Faintly, from afar, came the answering challenge of a lion.</p>

<p>"Let us eat," said Muzimo, as he carved generous portions from
the quivering carcass of his kill.</p>

<p>"Yes, let us eat," agreed Orando.</p>

<p>Muzimo grunted as he tossed a piece of the meat to the black.
Then he squatted on his haunches and tore at his portion with his
strong, white teeth. Cooking fires were for the effete, not for
this savage jungle god whose <i>mores</i> harked back through the
ages to the days before men had mastered the art of making
fire.</p>

<p>Orando hesitated. He preferred his meat cooked, but he dreaded
losing face in the presence of his <i>muzimo.</i> He deliberated
for but a second; then he approached Muzimo with the intention of
squatting down beside him to eat. The forest god looked up, his
teeth buried in the flesh from which he was tearing a piece. A
sudden, savage light blazed in his eyes. A low growl rumbled
warningly in his throat. Orando had seen lions disturbed at their
kills. The analogy was perfect. The warrior withdrew and squatted
at a distance. Thus the two finished their meal in a silence broken
only by the occasional low growls of the white.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4">IV. &mdash; SOBITO, THE WITCH-
DOCTOR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TWO white men sat before a much patched,
weatherworn tent. They sat upon the ground, for they had no chairs.
Their clothing was, if possible, more patched and weatherworn than
their tent. Five blacks squatted about a cook- fire at a little
distance from them. Another black was preparing food for the white
men at a small fire near the tent.</p>

<p>"I'm sure fed up on this," remarked the older man.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you beat it?" demanded the other, a young man of
twenty-one or twenty-two.</p>

<p>His companion shrugged. "Where? I'd be just another dirty bum,
back in the States. Here, I at least have the satisfaction of
servants, even though I know damn well they don't respect me. It
gives me a certain sense of <i>class</i> to be waited upon. There,
I'd have to wait on somebody else. But you&mdash;I can't see why
you want to hang around this lousy God-forsaken country, fighting
bugs and fever. You're young. You've got your whole life ahead of
you and the whole world to carve it out of any way you want."</p>

<p>"Hell!" exclaimed the younger man. "You talk as though you were
a hundred. You aren't thirty yet. You told me your age, you know,
right after we threw in together."</p>

<p>"Thirty's old," observed the other. "A guy's got to get a start
long before thirty. Why, I know fellows who made theirs and retired
by the time they were thirty. Take my dad for instance&mdash;" He
went silent then, quite suddenly. The other urged no
confidences.</p>

<p>"I guess we'd be a couple of bums back there," he remarked
laughing.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be a bum anywhere, Kid," remonstrated his
companion. He broke into sudden laughter.</p>

<p>"What you laughing about?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking about the time we met; it's just about a year
now. You tried to make me think you were a tough guy from the
slums. You were a pretty good actor&mdash;while you were thinking
about it."</p>

<p>The Kid grinned. "It was a hell of a strain on my histrionic
abilities," he admitted; "but, say, Old Timer, you didn't fool
anybody much, yourself. To listen to you talk one would have
imagined that you were born in the jungle and brought up by apes,
but I tumbled to you in a hurry. I said to myself, 'Kid, it's
either Yale or Princeton; more likely Yale.'"</p>

<p>"But you didn't ask any questions. That's what I liked about
you."</p>

<p>"And you didn't ask any. Perhaps that's why we've gotten along
together so well. People who ask questions should be taken gently,
but firmly, by the hand, led out behind the barn and shot. It would
be a better world to live in."</p>

<p>"Oke, Kid; but still it's rather odd, at that, that two fellows
should pal together for a year, as we have, and not know the first
damn thing about one another&mdash;as though neither trusted the
other."</p>

<p>"It isn't that with me," said the Kid; "but there are some
things that a fellow just can't talk about&mdash;to any one."</p>

<p>"I know," agreed Old Timer. "The thing each of us can't talk
about probably explains why he is here. It was a woman with me;
that's why I hate 'em."</p>

<p>"Hooey!" scoffed the younger man. "I'd bet you fall for the
first skirt you see&mdash;if I had anything to bet."</p>

<p>"We won't have anything to eat or any one to cook it for us if
we don't have a little luck pronto," observed the other. "It
commences to look as though all the elephants in Africa had beat it
for parts unknown."</p>

<p>"Old Bobolo swore we'd find 'em here, but I think old Bobolo is
a liar."</p>

<p>"I have suspected that for some time," admitted Old Timer.</p>

<p>The Kid rolled a cigarette. "All he wanted was to get rid of us,
or, to state the matter more accurately, to get rid of you."</p>

<p>"Why me?"</p>

<p>"He didn't like the goo-goo eyes his lovely daughter was making
at you. You've sure got a way with the women, Old Timer."</p>

<p>"It's because I haven't that I'm here," the older man assured
him.</p>

<p>"Says you."</p>

<p>"Kid, I think you are the one who is girl-crazy. You can't get
your mind off the subject. Forget 'em for a while, and let's get
down to business. I tell you we've got to do something and do it
damn sudden. If these loyal retainers of ours don't see a little
ivory around the diggings pretty soon they'll quit us. They know as
well as we do that it's a case of no ivory, no pay."</p>

<p>"Well, what are we going to do about it; manufacture
elephants?"</p>

<p>"Go out and find 'em. Thar's elephants in them thar hills, men;
but they aren't going to come trotting into camp to be shot. The
natives won't help us; so we've got to get out and scout for them
ourselves. We'll each take a couple of men and a few days' rations;
then we'll head in different directions, and if one of us doesn't
find elephant tracks I'm a zebra."</p>

<p>"How much longer do you suppose we'll be able to work this
racket without getting caught?" demanded The Kid.</p>

<p>"I've been working it for two years, and I haven't been nabbed
yet," replied Old Timer; "and, believe me, I don't want to be
nabbed. Have you ever seen their lousy jail?"</p>

<p>"They wouldn't put white men in that, would they?" The Kid
looked worried.</p>

<p>"They might. Ivory poachin' makes 'em sorer than Billy
Hell."</p>

<p>"I don't blame 'em," said The Kid. "It's a lousy racket."</p>

<p>"Don't I know it?" Old Timer spat vehemently. "But a man's got
to eat, hasn't he? If I knew a better way to eat I wouldn't be an
ivory poacher. Don't think for a minute that I'm stuck on the job
or proud of myself. I'm not. I just try not to think of the ethics
of the thing, just like I try to forget that I was ever decent. I'm
a bum, I tell you, a dirty, low down bum; but even bums cling to
life&mdash;though God only knows why. I've never dodged the chance
of kicking off, but somehow I always manage to wiggle through. If
I'd been any good on earth; or if any one had cared whether I
croaked or not, I'd have been dead long ago. It seems as though the
Devil watches over things like me and protects them, so that they
can suffer as long as possible in this life before he forks them
into eternal hell-fire and brimstone in the next."</p>

<p>"Don't brag," advised The Kid. "I'm just as big a bum as you.
Likewise, I have to eat. Let's forget ethics and get busy."</p>

<p>"We'll start tomorrow," agreed Old Timer.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Muzimo stood silent with folded arms, the center
of a chattering horde of natives in the village of Tumbai. Upon his
shoulders squatted The Spirit of Nyamwegi. He, too, chattered. It
was fortunate, perhaps, that the villagers of Tumbai could not
understand what The Spirit of Nyamwegi said. He was hurling the
vilest of jungle invective at them, nor was there in all the jungle
another such master of diatribe. Also, from the safety of Muzimo's
shoulder, he challenged them to battle, telling them what he would
do to them if he ever got hold of them. He challenged them single
and <i>en masse.</i> It made no difference to The Spirit of
Nyamwegi how they came, just so they came.</p>

<p>If the villagers were not impressed by The Spirit of Nyamwegi,
the same is not true of the effect that the presence of Muzimo had
upon them after they had heard Orando's story, even after the first
telling. By the seventh or eighth telling their awe was prodigious.
It kept them at a safe distance from this mysterious creature of
another world.</p>

<p>There was one skeptic, however. It was the village witch-
doctor, who doubtless felt that it was not good business to admit
too much credence in a miracle not of his own making. Whatever he
felt, and it is quite possible that he was as much in awe as the
others, he hid it under a mask of indifference, for he must always
impress the laity with his own importance.</p>

<p>The attention bestowed upon this stranger irked him; it also
pushed him entirely out of the limelight. This nettled him greatly.
Therefore, to call attention to himself, as well as to reestablish
his importance, he strode boldly up to Muzimo. Whereupon The Spirit
of Nyamwegi screamed shrilly and took refuge behind the back of his
patron. The attention of the villagers was now attracted to the
witch-doctor, which was precisely what he desired. The chattering
ceased. All eyes were on the two. This was the moment the
witch-doctor had awaited. He puffed himself to his full height and
girth. He swaggered before the spirit of Orando's ancestor. Then he
addressed him in a loud tone.</p>

<p>"You say that you are the <i>muzimo</i> of Orando, the son of
Lobongo; but how do we know that your words are true words? You say
that the little monkey is the ghost of Nyamwegi. How do we know
that, either?"</p>

<p>"Who are you, old man, who asks me these questions?" demanded
Muzimo.</p>

<p>"I am Sobito, the witch-doctor."</p>

<p>"You say that you are Sobito, the witch-doctor; but how do I
know that your words are true words?"</p>

<p>"Every one knows that I am Sobito, the witch-doctor." The old
man was becoming excited. He discovered that he had been suddenly
put upon the defensive, which was not at all what he had intended.
"Ask any one. They all know me."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Muzimo; "ask Orando who I am. He, alone,
knows me. I have not said that I am his <i>muzimo.</i> I have not
said that the little monkey is the ghost of Nyamwegi. I have not
said who I am. I have not said anything. It does not make any
difference to me who you think I am; but if it makes a difference
to you, ask Orando," whereupon he turned about and walked away,
leaving Sobito to feel that he had been made to appear ridiculous
in the eyes of his clansmen.</p>

<p>Fanatical, egotistical, and unscrupulous, the old witch-doctor
was a power in the village of Tumbai. For years he had exercised
his influence, sometimes for good and sometimes for evil, upon the
villagers. Even Lobongo, the chief, was not as powerful as Sobito,
who played upon the superstitions and fears of his ignorant
followers until they dared not disobey his slightest wish.</p>

<p>Tradition and affection bound them to Lobongo, their hereditary
chief; fear held them in the power of Sobito, whom they hated.
Inwardly they were pleased that Orando's <i>muzimo</i> had flaunted
him; but when the witch-doctor came among them and spoke
disparagingly of the <i>muzimo</i> they only listened in sullen
silence, daring not to express their belief in him.</p>

<p>Later, the warriors gathered before the hut of Lobono to listen
to the formal telling of the story of Orando. It was immaterial
that they had heard it several times already. It must be told again
in elaborate detail before a council of the chief and his warriors;
and so once more Orando retold the oft-told tale, nor did it lose
anything in the telling. More and more courageous became the deeds
of Orando, more and more miraculous those of Muzimo; and when he
closed his oration it was with an appeal to the chief and his
warriors to gather the Utengas from all the villages of the tribe
and go forth to avenge Nyamwegi. Muzimo, he told them, would lead
them to the village of the Leopard Men.</p>

<p>There were shouts of approval from the younger men, but the
majority of the older men sat in silence. It is always thus; the
younger men for war, the older for peace. Lobongo was an old man.
He was proud that his son should be warlike. That was the reaction
of the father, but the reaction of age was all against war. So he,
too, remained silent. Not so, Sobito. To his personal grievance
against Muzimo were added other considerations that inclined him
against this contemplated foray; at least one of which (and the
most potent) was a secret he might not divulge with impunity.
Scowling forbiddingly he leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Who makes this foolish talk of war?" he demanded. "Young men.
What do young men know of war? They think only of victory. They
forget defeat. They forget that if they make war upon a village the
warriors of that village will come some day and make war upon us.
What is to be gained by making war upon the Leopard Men? Who knows
where their village lies? It must be very far away. Why should our
warriors go far from their own country to make war upon the Leopard
Men? Because Nyamwegi has been killed? Nyamwegi has already been
avenged. This is foolish talk, this war-talk. Who started it?
Perhaps it is a stranger among us who wishes to make trouble for
us." He looked at Muzimo. "Who knows why? Perhaps the Leopard Men
have sent one of their own people to lure us into making war upon
them. Then all our warriors will be ambushed and killed. That is
what will happen. Make no more foolish talk about war."</p>

<p>As Sobito concluded his harangue and again squatted upon his
heels Orando arose. He was disturbed by what the old witch-doctor
had said; and he was angry, too; and he was angry, too; angry
because Sobito had impugned the integrity of his <i>muzimo.</i> But
his anger was leashed by his fear of the powerful old man; for who
dares openly oppose one in league with the forces of darkness, one
whose enmity can spell disaster and death? Yet Orando was a brave
warrior and a loyal friend, as befitted one in whose veins flowed
the blood of hereditary chieftainship; and so he could not permit
the innuendoes of Sobito to go entirely unchallenged.</p>

<p>"Sobito has spoken against war," he began. "Old men always speak
against war, which is right if one is an old man. Orando is a young
man yet he, too, would speak against war if it were only the
foolish talk of young men who wished to appear brave in the eyes of
women; but now there is a reason for war. Nyamwegi has been killed.
He was a brave warrior. He was a good friend. Because we have
killed three of those who killed Nyamwegi we cannot say that he is
avenged. We must go and make war upon the chief who sent these
murderers into the Watenga country, or he will think that the
Utengas are all old women. He will think that whenever his people
wish to eat the flesh of man they have only to come to the Watenga
country to get it.</p>

<p>"Sobito has said that perhaps the Leopard Men sent a stranger
among us to lure us into ambush. There is only one stranger among
us&mdash;Muzimo. But Muzimo cannot be a friend of the Leopard Men.
With his own eyes Orando saw him kill two of the Leopard Men; he
saw the fourth run away very fast when his eyes discovered the
might of Muzimo. Had Muzimo been his friend he would not have run
away.</p>

<p>"I am Orando, the son of Lobongo. Some day I shall be chief. I
would not lead the warriors of Lobongo into a foolish war. I am
going to the village of the Leopard Men and make war upon them,
that they may know that not all the Utenga warriors are old women.
Muzimo is going with me. Perhaps there are a few brave men who will
accompany us. I have spoken."</p>

<p>Several of the younger warriors leaped from their haunches and
stamped their feet in approval. They raised their voices in the
war-cry of their clan and brandished their spears. One of them
danced in a circle, leaping high and jabbing with his spear.</p>

<p>"Thus will I kill the Leopard Men!" he cried.</p>

<p>Another leaped about, slashing with his knife. "I cut the heart
from the chief of the Leopard Men!" He pretended to tear at
something with his teeth, while he held it tightly in his hands. "I
eat the heart of the chief of the Leopard Men!"</p>

<p>"War! War!" cried others, until there were a dozen howling
savages dancing in the sunlight, their sleek hides glistening with
sweat, their features contorted by hideous grimaces.</p>

<p>Then Lobongo arose. His deep voice boomed above the howling of
the dancers as he commanded them to silence. One by one they ceased
their howling, but they gathered together in a little knot behind
Orando.</p>

<p>"A few of the young men have spoken for war," he announced, "but
we do not make war lightly because a few young men wish to fight.
There are times for war and times for peace. We must find out if
this is the time for war; otherwise we shall find only defeat and
death at the end of the war-trail. Before undertaking war we must
consult the ghosts of our dead chiefs."</p>

<p>"They are waiting to speak to us," cried Sobito. "Let there be
silence while I speak with the spirits of the chiefs who are
gone."</p>

<p>As he spoke there was the gradual beginning of a movement among
the tribesmen that presently formed a circle in the center of which
squatted the witch-doctor. From a pouch he withdrew a number of
articles which he spread upon the ground before him. Then he called
for some dry twigs and fresh leaves, and when these were brought he
built a tiny fire. With the fresh leaves he partially smothered it,
so that it threw off a quantity of smoke. Stooping, half doubled,
the witch-doctor moved cautiously around the fire, describing a
small circle, his eyes constantly fixed upon the thin column of
smoke spiraling upward in the quiet air of the drowsy afternoon. In
one hand Sobito held a small pouch made of the skin of a rodent, in
the other the tail of a hyaena, the root bound with copper wire to
form a handle.</p>

<p>Gradually the old man increased his pace until at last, he was
circling the fire rapidly in prodigious leaps and bounds; but
always his eyes remained fixed upon the spiraling smoke column. As
he danced he intoned a weird jargon, a combination of meaningless
syllables interspersed with an occasional shrill scream that
brought terror to the eyes of his spell-bound audience.</p>

<p>Suddenly he halted, and stooping low tossed some powder from his
pouch upon the fire; then with the root of the hyaena tail he drew
a rude geometric figure in the dust before the blaze. Stiffening,
he closed his eyes and appeared to be listening intently, his face
turned partially upward.</p>

<p>In awestruck silence the warriors leaned forward, waiting. It
was a tense moment and quite effective. Sobito prolonged it to the
utmost. At last he opened his eyes and let them move solemnly about
the circle of expectant faces, waiting again before he spoke.</p>

<p>"There are many ghosts about us," he announced. "They all speak
against war. Those who go to battle with the Leopard Men will die.
None will return. The ghosts are angry with Orando. The true
<i>muzimo</i> of Orando spoke to me; it is very angry with Orando.
Let Orando beware. That is all; the young men will not go to war
against the Leopard Men."</p>

<p>The warriors gathered behind Orando looked questioningly at him
and at Muzimo. Doubt was written plainly upon every face. Gradually
they began to move, drifting imperceptibly away from Orando. Then
the son of the chief looked at Muzimo questioningly. "If Sobito has
spoken true words," he said, "you are not my <i>muzimo."</i> The
words seemed a challenge.</p>

<p>"What does Sobito know about it?" demanded Muzimo. "I could
build a fire and wave the tail of Dango. I could make marks in the
dirt and throw powders on the fire. Then I could tell you whatever
I wanted to tell you, just as Sobito has told you what he wanted
you to believe; but such things prove nothing. The only way you can
know if a war against the Leopard Men will succeed is to send
warriors to fight them. Sobito knows nothing about it."</p>

<p>The witch-doctor trembled from anger. Never before had a
creature dared voice a doubt as to his powers. So abjectly had the
members of his clan acknowledged his infallibility that he had
almost come to believe in it himself. He shook a withered finger at
Muzimo.</p>

<p>"You speak with a lying tongue," he cried. "You have angered my
fetish. Nothing can save you. You are lost. You will die." He
paused as a new idea was born in his cunning brain. "Unless," he
added, "you go away, and do not come back."</p>
<a id="pic4" name="pic4"></a><br>

</div>
<br>

<p>Having no idea as to his true identity, Muzimo had had to accept
Orando's word that he was the ancestral spirit of the chief's son;
and having heard himself described as such innumerable times he had
come to accept it as fact. He felt no fear of Sobito, the man, and
when Sobito, the witch-doctor, threatened him he recalled that he
was a <i>muzimo</i> and, as such, immortal. How, therefore, he
reasoned, could the fetish of Sobito kill him? Nothing could kill a
spirit.</p>

<p>"I shall not go away," he announced. "I am not afraid of
Sobito."</p>

<p>The villagers were aghast. Never had they heard a witch-doctor
flouted and defied as Muzimo had flouted and defied Sobito. They
expected to see the rash creature destroyed before their eyes, but
nothing happened. They looked at Sobito, questioningly, and that
wily old fraud, sensing the critical turn of the event and fearing
for his prestige, overcame his physical fear of the strange, white
giant in the hope of regaining his dignity by a single bold
stroke.</p>

<p>Brandishing his hyaena tail, he leaped toward Muzimo. "Die!" he
screamed. "Nothing can save you now. Before the moon has risen the
third time you will be dead. My fetish has spoken!" He waved the
hyaena tail in the face of Muzimo.</p>

<p>The white man stood with folded arms, a sneer upon his lips. "I
am Muzimo," he said; "I am the spirit of the ancestor of Orando.
Sobito is only a man; his fetish is only the tail of Dango." As he
ceased speaking his hand shot out and snatched the fetish from the
grasp of the witch-doctor. "Thus does Muzimo with the fetish of
Sobito!" he cried, tossing the tail into the fire to the
consternation of the astonished villagers.</p>

<p>Seized by the unreasoning rage of fanaticism Sobito threw
caution to the winds and leaped for Muzimo, a naked blade in his
upraised hand. There was the froth of madness upon his bared lips.
His yellow fangs gleamed in a hideous snarl. He was the
personification of hatred and maniacal fury. But swift and vicious
as was his attack it did not find Muzimo unprepared. A bronzed hand
seized the wrist of the witch-doctor in a grip of steel; another
tore the knife from his grasp. Then Muzimo picked him up and held
him high above his head as though Sobito were some incorporeal
thing without substance or weight.</p>

<p>Terror was writ large upon the countenances of the astounded
onlookers; an idol was in the clutches of an iconoclast. The
situation had passed beyond the scope of their simple minds,
leaving them dazed. Perhaps it was well for Muzimo that Sobito was
far from being a beloved idol.</p>

<p>Muzimo looked at Orando. "Shall I kill him?" he asked, almost
casually.</p>

<p>Orando was as shocked and terrified as his fellows. A lifetime
of unquestioning belief in the supernatural powers of witch-
doctors could not be overcome in an instant. Yet there was another
force working upon the son of the chief. He was only human. Muzimo
was his <i>muzimo,</i> and being very human he could not but feel a
certain justifiable pride in the fearlessness and prowess of this
splendid enigma whom he had enthusiastically accepted as the spirit
of his dead ancestor. However, witch-doctors were witch-doctors.
Their powers were well known to all men. There was, therefore, no
wisdom in tempting fate too far.</p>

<p>Orando ran forward. "No!" he cried. "Do not kill him."</p>
<a id="pic5" name="pic5"></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src=
"0500201h-images/TarzanAndTheLeopardMen-Hoban-03.gif" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>Upon the branch of a tree a little monkey danced, screaming and
scolding. "Kill him!" he shrieked. "Kill him!" He was a very
blood-thirsty little monkey, was The Spirit of Nyamwegi. Muzimo
tossed Sobito to the ground in an ignominious heap.</p>

<p>"He is no good," he announced. "No witch-doctor is any good. His
fetish was not good. If it had been, why did it not protect Sobito?
Sobito did not know what he was talking about. If there are any
brave warriors among the Utengas they will come with Orando and
Muzimo and make war on the Leopard Men."</p>

<p>A low cry, growing in volume, rose among the younger warriors;
and in the momentary confusion Sobito crawled to his feet and
sneaked away toward his hut. When he was safely out of reach of
Muzimo he halted and faced about. "I go," he called back, "to make
powerful medicine. To-night the white man who calls himself Muzimo
dies."</p>

<p>The white giant took a few steps in the direction of Sobito, and
the witch-doctor turned and fled. The young men, seeing the waning
of Sobito's power, talked loudly now of war. The older men talked
no more of peace. One and all, they feared and hated Sobito. They
were relieved to see his power broken. Tomorrow they might be
afraid again, but today they were free from the domination of a
witch-doctor for the first time in their lives.</p>

<p>Lobongo, the chief, would not sanction war; but, influenced by
the demands of Orando and other young men, he at last grudgingly
gave his approval to the formation of a small raiding party.
Immediately runners were dispatched to other villages to seek
recruits, and preparations were begun for a dance to be held that
night.</p>

<p>Because of Lobongo's refusal to make general war against the
Leopard Men there was no booming of war-drums; but news travels
fast in the jungle; and night had scarcely closed down upon the
village of Tumbai before warriors from the nearer villages
commenced coming in to Tumbai by ones and twos to join the twenty
volunteers from Lobongo's village, who swaggered and strutted
before the admiring eyes of the dusky belles preparing the food and
native beer that would form an important part of the night's
festivities.</p>

<p>From Kibbu came ten young warriors, among them the brother of
the girl Nyamwegi had been courting and one Lupingu, from whom the
murdered warrior had stolen her heart. That Lupingu should
volunteer to risk his life for the purpose of avenging Nyamwegi
passed unnoticed, since already thoughts of vengeance had been
submerged by lust for glory and poor Nyamwegi practically forgotten
by all but Orando.</p>

<p>There was much talk of war and of brave deeds that would be
accomplished; but the discomfiture of Sobito, being still fresh in
every mind, also had an important part in the conversations. The
village gossips found it a choice morsel with which to regale the
warriors from other villages, with the result that Muzimo became an
outstanding figure that reflected more glory upon the village of
Tumbai than ever Sobito had. The visiting warriors regarded him
with awe and some misgivings. They were accustomed to spirits that
no one ever saw; the air was full of them. It was quite another
matter to behold one standing in their midst.</p>

<p>Lupingu, especially, was perturbed. Recently he had purchased a
love charm from Sobito. He was wondering now if he had thrown away,
uselessly, the little treasure he had paid for it. He decided to
seek out the witch-doctor and make inquiries; perhaps there was not
so much truth in what he had heard. There was also another reason
why he wished to consult Sobito, a reason of far greater importance
than a love charm.</p>

<p>When he could do so unnoticed, Lupingu withdrew from the crowd
milling in the village street and sneaked away to Sobito's hut.
Here he found the old witch-doctor squatting upon the floor
surrounded by charms and fetishes. A small fire burning beneath a
pot fitfully lighted his sinister features, which were contorted by
so hideous a scowl that Lupingu almost turned and fled before the
old man looked up and recognized him.</p>

<p>For a long time Lupingu sat in the hut of the witch-doctor. They
spoke in whispers, their heads close together. When Lupingu left he
carried with him an amulet of such prodigious potency that no enemy
could inflict injury upon him, and in his head he carried a plan
that caused him both elation and terror.</p>

<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5">V. &mdash; "UNSPEAKABLE BOOR!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">LONG days of loneliness. Long nights of terror.
Hopelessness and vain regrets so keen that they pained as might
physical hurts. Only a brave heart had kept the girl from going mad
since her men had deserted her. That seemed an eternity ago; days
were ages.</p>

<p>Today she had hunted. A small boar had fallen to her rifle. At
the sound of the shot, coming faintly to his ears, a white man had
halted, scowling. His three companions jabbered excitedly.</p>
<a id="pic6" name="pic6"></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src=
"0500201h-images/TarzanAndTheLeopardMen-Hoban-04.gif" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<p>With difficulty the girl had removed the viscera of the boar,
thus reducing its weight sufficiently so that she could drag it to
her camp; but it had been an ordeal that had taxed her strength and
endurance to their limits. The meat was too precious, however, to
be wasted; and she had struggled for hours, stopping often to rest,
until at last, exhausted, she had sunk beside her prize before the
entrance to her tent.</p>

<p>It was not encouraging to consider the vast amount of labor that
still confronted her before the meat would be safe for future use.
There was the butchering. The mere thought of it appalled her. She
had never seen an animal butchered until after she had set out upon
this disastrous safari. In all her life she had never even so much
as cut a piece of raw meat. Her preparation, therefore, was most
inadequate; but necessity overcomes obstacles, as it mothers
inventions. She knew that the boar must be butchered, and the flesh
cut into strips and that these strips must be smoked. Even then
they would not keep long, but she knew no better way.</p>

<p>With her limited knowledge of practical matters, with the means
at hand, she must put up the best fight for life of which she was
capable. She was weak and inexperienced and afraid; but none the
less it was a courageous heart that beat beneath her once chic but
now soiled and disreputable flannel shirt. She was without hope,
yet she would not give up.</p>

<p>Wearily, she had commenced to skin the boar, when a movement at
the edge of the clearing in which her camp had been pitched
attracted her attention. As she looked up she saw four men standing
silently, regarding her. One was a white man. The other three were
blacks. As she sprang to her feet hope welled so strongly within
her that she reeled slightly with dizziness; but instantly she
regained control of herself and surveyed the four, who were now
advancing, the white man in the lead, then, when closer scrutiny
was possible, hope waned. Never in her life had she seen so
disreputable appearing a white man. His filthy clothing was a
motley of rags and patches; his face was unshaven; his hat was a
nondescript wreck that might only be distinguished as a hat by the
fact that it surmounted his head; his face was stern and
forbidding. His eyes wandered suspiciously about her camp; and when
he halted a few paces from her, scowling, there was no greeting on
his lips.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded. "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>His tone and words antagonized her. Never before had any white
man addressed her in so cavalier a manner. In a proud and spirited
girl the reaction was inevitable. Her chin went up; she eyed him
coldly; the suggestion of a supercilious sneer curved her short
upper lip; her eyes evaluated him disdainfully from his run-down
boots to the battered thing that covered his dishevelled hair. Had
his manner and address been different she might have been afraid of
him, but now for the moment at least she was too angry to be
afraid.</p>

<p>"I cannot conceive that either matter concerns you," she said,
and turned her back on him.</p>

<p>The scowl deepened on the man's face, and angry words leaped to
his tongue; but he controlled himself, regarding her silently. Had
he not already seen her face he would have guessed from the lines
of her haughty little back that she was young. Having seen her face
he knew that she was beautiful. She was dirty, hot, perspiring, and
covered with blood; but she was still beautiful. How beautiful she
must be when properly garbed and groomed he dared not even imagine.
He had noticed her blue-grey eyes and long lashes; they alone would
have made any face beautiful. Now he was appraising her hair,
confined in a loose knot at the nape of her neck; it had that
peculiar quality of blondness that is described, today, as
platinum.</p>

<p>It had been two years since Old Timer had seen a white woman.
Perhaps if this one had been old and scrawny, or had buckteeth and
a squint, he might have regarded her with less disapprobation and
addressed her more courteously. But the moment that his eyes had
beheld her, her beauty had recalled all the anguish and misery that
another beautiful girl had caused him, arousing within him the
hatred of women that he had nursed and cherished for two long
years.</p>

<p>He stood in silence for a moment; and he was glad that he had;
for it permitted him to quell the angry, bitter words that he might
otherwise have spoken. It was not that he liked women any better,
but that he realized and admired the courageousness of her
reply.</p>

<p>"It may not be any of my business," he said presently, "but
perhaps I shall have to make it so. It is rather unusual to see a
white woman alone in this country. You <i>are</i> alone?" There was
a faint note of concern in the tone of his question.</p>

<p>"I was quite alone," she snapped, "and I should prefer being so
again."</p>

<p>"You mean that you are without porters or white companions?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>As her back was toward him she did not see the expression of
relief that crossed his face at her admission. Had she, she might
have felt greater concern for her safety, though his relief had no
bearing upon her welfare; his anxiety as to the presence of white
men was simply that of the elephant poacher.</p>

<p>"And you have no means of transportation?" he queried.</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"You certainly did not come this far into the interior alone.
What became of the other members of your party?"</p>

<p>"They deserted me."</p>

<p>"But your white companions&mdash;what of them?"</p>

<p>"I had none." She had faced him by now, but her attitude was
still unfriendly.</p>

<p>"You came into the interior without any white men?" There was
skepticism in his tone.</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"When did your men desert you?"</p>

<p>"Three days ago."</p>

<p>"What do you intend doing? You can't stay here alone, and I
don't see how you can expect to go on without porters."</p>

<p>"I have stayed here three days alone; I can continue to do so
until&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Until what?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Look here," he demanded; "what in the world are you doing here,
anyway?"</p>

<p>A sudden hope seemed to flash to her brain. "I am looking for a
man," she said. "Perhaps you have heard of him; perhaps you know
where he is." Her voice was vibrant with eagerness.</p>

<p>"What's his name?" asked Old Timer.</p>

<p>"Jerry Jerome." She looked up into his face hopefully.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Never heard of him."</p>

<p>The hope in her eyes died out, suffused by the faintest
suggestion of tears. Old Timer saw the moisture in her eyes, and it
annoyed him. Why did women always have to cry? He steeled his heart
against the weakness that was sympathy and spoke brusquely. "What
do you think you're going to do with that meat?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Her eyes widened in surprise. There were no tears in them now,
but a glint of anger. "You are impossible. I wish you would get out
of my camp and leave me alone."</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the kind," he replied. Then he spoke
rapidly to his three followers in their native dialect, whereupon
the three advanced and took possession of the carcass of the
boar.</p>

<p>The girl looked on in angry surprise. She recalled the
heartbreaking labor of dragging the carcass to camp. Now it was
being taken from her. The thought enraged her. She drew her
revolver from its holster. "Tell them to leave that alone," she
cried, "or I'll shoot them. It's mine."</p>

<p>"They're only going to butcher it for you," explained Old Timer.
"That's what you wanted, isn't it? Or were you going to frame
it?"</p>

<p>His sarcasm nettled her, but she realized that she had
misunderstood their purpose. "Why didn't you say so?" she demanded.
"I was going to smoke it. I may not always be able to get food
easily."</p>

<p>"You won't have to," he told her; "we'll look after that."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that as soon as I'm through here you're going back to my
camp with me. It ain't my fault that you're here; and you're a damn
useless nuisance, like all other women; but I couldn't leave a
white rat here alone in the jungle, much less a white woman."</p>

<p>"What if I don't care to go with you?" she inquired
haughtily.</p>

<p>"I don't give a damn what you think about it," he snapped;
"you're going with me. If you had any brains you'd be grateful.
It's too much to expect you to have a heart. You're like all the
rest&mdash;selfish, inconsiderate, ungrateful."</p>

<p>"Anything else?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes. Cold, calculating, hard."</p>

<p>"You do not think much of women, do you?"</p>

<p>"You are quite discerning."</p>

<p>"And just what do you propose doing with me when we get to your
camp?" she asked.</p>

<p>"If we can scrape up a new safari for you I'll get you out of
Africa as quickly as I can," he replied.</p>

<p>"But I do not wish to get out of Africa. You have no right to
dictate to me. I came here for a purpose, and I shall not leave
until that purpose is fulfilled."</p>

<p>"If you came here to find that Jerome fellow it is my duty to a
fellow man to chase you out before you can find him."</p>

<p>Her level gaze rested upon him for several moments before she
replied. She had never before seen a man like this. Such candor was
unnatural. She decided that he was mentally unbalanced; and having
heard that the insane should be humored, lest they become violent,
she determined to alter her attitude toward him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," she admitted. "I will go with you."</p>

<p>"That's better," he commented. "Now that that's settled let's
have everything else clear. We're starting back to my camp as soon
as I get through with my business here. That may be tomorrow or
next day. You're coming along. One of my boys will look after
you&mdash;cooking and all that sort of stuff. But I don't want to
be bothered with any women. You leave me alone, and I'll leave you
alone. I don't even want to talk to you."</p>

<p>"That will be mutually agreeable," she assured him, not without
some asperity. Since she was a woman and had been for as long as
she could recall the object of masculine adulation, such a speech,
even from the lips of a disreputable ragamuffin whose sanity she
questioned, could not but induce a certain pique.</p>

<p>"One more thing," he added. "My camp is in Chief Bobolo's
country. If anything happens to me have my boys take you back there
to my camp. My partner will look after you. Just tell him that I
promised to get you back to the coast." He left her then, and
busied himself with the simple preparation of his modest camp,
calling one of the men from the butchering to pitch his small tent
and prepare his evening meal, for it was late in the afternoon.
Another of the boys was detailed to serve the girl.</p>

<p>From her tent that evening she could see him sprawled before a
fire, smoking his pipe. From a distance she gazed at him
contemptuously, convinced that he was the most disagreeable person
she had ever encountered, yet forced to admit that his presence
gave her a feeling of security she had not enjoyed since she had
entered Africa. She concluded that even a crazy white man was
better than none. But was he crazy? He seemed quite normal and sane
in all respects other than his churlish attitude toward her.
Perhaps he was just an ill-bred boor with some fancied grievance
against women. Be that as it might he was an enigma, and unsolved
enigmas have a way of occupying one's thoughts. So, notwithstanding
her contempt for him, he filled her reveries quite to the exclusion
of all else until sleep claimed her.</p>

<p>Doubtless she would have been surprised to know that similarly
the man's mind was occupied with thoughts of her, thoughts that
hung on with bulldog tenacity despite his every effort to shake
them loose. In the smoke of his pipe he saw her, unquestionably
beautiful beyond comparison. He saw the long lashes shading the
depths of her blue-grey eyes; her lips, curved deliciously; the
alluring sheen of her wavy blond hair; the perfection of her
girlish figure.</p>

<p>"Damn!" muttered Old Timer. "Why in hell did I have to run into
her?"</p>

<p>The following morning he left camp early, taking two of the boys
with him; leaving the third, armed with an old rifle, to protect
the girl and attend to her wants. She was already up when he
departed, but he did not look in her direction as he strode out of
camp, though she furtively watched him go, feeding her contempt on
a final disparaging appraisement of his rags and tatters.</p>

<p>"Unspeakable boor!" she whispered venomously as a partial outlet
for her pent up hatred of the man.</p>

<p>Old Timer had a long, hard day. No sign of elephant rewarded his
search, nor did he contact a single native from whom he might
obtain information as to the whereabouts of the great herd that
rumor and hope had located in this vicinity.</p>

<p>Not only was the day one of physical hardship, but it had been
mentally trying as well. He had been disappointed in not locating
the ivory they needed so sorely, but this had been the least of his
mental perturbation. He had been haunted by thoughts of the girl.
All day he had tried to rid his mind of recollection of that lovely
face and the contours of her perfect body, but they persisted in
haunting him. At first they had aroused other memories, painful
memories of another girl. But gradually the vision of that other
girl had faded until only the blue-grey eyes and blond hair of the
girl in the lonely camp persisted in his thoughts.</p>

<p>When he turned back toward camp at the end of his fruitless
search for elephant signs a new determination filled him with
disquieting thoughts and spurred him rapidly upon the back-trail.
It had been two years since he had seen a white woman, and then
Fate had thrown this lovely creature across his path. What had
women ever done for him? "Made a bum of me," he soliloquized;
"ruined my life. This girl would have been lost but for me. She
owes me something. All women owe me something for what one woman
did to me. This girl is going to pay the debt.</p>

<p>"God, but she's beautiful! And she belongs to me. I found her,
and I am going to keep her until I am tired of her. Then I'll throw
her over the way I was thrown over. See how the woman will like it!
Gad, what lips! Tonight they will be mine. She'll be all mine, and
I'll make her like it. It's only fair. I've got something coming to
me in this world. I'm entitled to a little happiness; and, by God,
I'm going to have it."</p>

<p>The great sun hung low in the west as the man came in sight of
the clearing. The tent of the girl was the first thing that greeted
his eyes. The soiled canvas suggested an intimacy that was
provocative; it had sheltered and protected her; it had shared the
most intimate secrets of her alluring charm. Like all inanimate
objects that have been closely associated with an individual the
tent reflected something of the personality of the girl. The mere
sight of it stirred the man deeply. His passions, aroused by hours
of anticipation, surged through his head like wine. He quickened
his pace in his eagerness to take the girl in his arms.</p>

<p>Then he saw an object lying just beyond her tent that turned him
cold with apprehension. Springing forward at a run, closely
followed by his two retainers, he came to a halt beside the grisly
thing that had attracted his horrified attention and turned the hot
wave of his desire to cold dread. It was the dead and horribly
mutilated body of the black he had left to guard the girl. Cruel
talons had lacerated the flesh with deep wounds that might have
been inflicted by one of the great carnivores, but the further
mutilation of the corpse had been the work of man.</p>

<p>Stooping over the body of their fellow the two Negroes muttered
angrily in their native tongue; then one of them turned to Old
Timer. "The Leopard Men, Bwana," he said.</p>

<p>Fearfully, the white man approached the tent of the girl,
dreading what he might find there, dreading even more that he might
find nothing. As he threw aside the flap and looked in, his worst
fears were realized; the girl was not there. His first impulse was
to call aloud to her as though she might be somewhere near in the
forest; but as he turned to do so he suddenly realized that he did
not know her name, and in the brief pause that this realization
gave him the futility of the act was borne in upon him. If she
still lived she was far away by now in the clutches of the fiends
who had slain her protector.</p>

<p>A sudden wave of rage overwhelmed the white man, his hot desire
for the girl transmuted to almost maniacal anger toward her
abductors. He forgot that he himself would have wronged her.
Perhaps he thought only of his own frustrated hopes; but he
believed that he was thinking only of the girl's helplessness, of
the hideousness of her situation. Ideas of rescue and vengeance
filled his whole being, banishing the fatigue of the long, arduous
day.</p>

<p>It was already late in the afternoon, but he determined upon
immediate pursuit. Following his orders the two hastily buried
their dead comrade, made up two packs with such provisions and camp
necessities as the marauders had not filched, and with the sun but
an hour high followed their mad master upon the fresh trail of the
Leopard Men.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap6" id="chap6">VI. &mdash; THE TRAITOR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE warriors of Watenga had not responded with
great enthusiasm to the call to arms borne by the messengers of
Orando. There were wars, and wars. One directed against the feared
secret order of the Leopard Men did not appear to be highly
popular. There were excellent reasons for this. In the first place
the very name of Leopard Man was sufficient to arouse terror in the
breast of the bravest, the gruesome methods of the Leopard Men
being what they were. There was also the well known fact that,
being a secret order recruited among unrelated clans, some of one's
own friends might be members, in which event an active enemy of the
order could easily be marked for death. And such a death!</p>

<p>It is little wonder, then, that from thousands of potential
crusaders Orando discovered but a scant hundred awaiting the call
to arms the morning following the celebration and war dance at
Tumbai. Even among the hundred there were several whose martial
spirit had suffered eclipse over night. Perhaps this was largely
due to the after effects of an over-dose of native beer. It is not
pleasant to set out for war with a headache.</p>

<p>Orando was moving about among the warriors squatting near the
numerous cooking fires. There was not much talk this morning and
less laughter; the boasting of yestereve was stilled. Today war
seemed a serious business; yet, their bellies once filled with warm
food, they would go forth presently with loud yells, with laughter,
and with song.</p>

<p>Orando made inquiries. "Where is Muzimo?" he asked, but no one
had seen Muzimo. He and The Spirit of Nyamwegi had disappeared.
This seemed an ill omen. Some one suggested that possibly Sobito
had been right; Muzimo might be in league with the Leopard Men.
This aroused inquiry as to the whereabouts of Sobito. No one had
seen him either; which was strange, since Sobito was an early riser
and not one to be missing when the cook-pots were a-boil. An old
man went to his hut and questioned one of the witch- doctor's
wives. Sobito was gone! When this fact was reported conversation
waxed. The enmity between Muzimo and Sobito was recalled, as was
the latter's threat that Muzimo would die before morning. There
were those who suggested that perhaps it was Sobito who was dead,
while others recalled the fact that there was nothing unusual in
his disappearance. He had disappeared before. In fact, it was
nothing unusual for him to absent himself mysteriously from the
village for days at a time. Upon his return after such absences he
had darkly hinted that he had been sitting in council with the
spirits and demons of another world, from whom he derived his
supernatural powers.</p>

<p>Lupingu of Kibbu thought that they should not set out upon the
war trail in the face of such dire omens. He went quietly among the
warriors seeking adherents to his suggestion that they disband and
return to their own villages, but Orando shamed them out of
desertion. The old men and the women would laugh at them, he told
them. They had made too much talk about war; they had boasted too
much. They would lose face forever if they failed to go through
with it now.</p>

<p>"But who will guide us to the village of the Leopard Men now
that your <i>muzimo</i> has deserted you?" demanded Lupingu.</p>

<p>"I do not believe that he has deserted me," maintained Orando
stoutly. "Doubtless he, too, has gone to take council with the
spirits. He will return and lead us."</p>

<p>As though in answer to his statement, which was also a prayer, a
giant figure dropped lightly from the branches of a nearby tree and
strode toward him. It was Muzimo. Across one of his broad shoulders
rested the carcass of a buck. On top of the buck sat The Spirit of
Nyamwegi, screaming shrilly to attract attention to his prowess.
"We are mighty hunters," he cried. "See what we have killed." No
one but Muzimo understood him, but that made no difference to The
Spirit of Nyamwegi because he did not know that they could not
understand him. He thought that he was making a fine impression,
and he was quite proud of himself.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, Muzimo?" asked Orando. "Some said that
Sobito had slain you."</p>

<p>Muzimo shrugged. "Words do not kill. Sobito is full of
words."</p>

<p>"Have you killed Sobito?" demanded an old man.</p>

<p>"I have not seen Sobito since before Kudu, the sun, went to his
lair last night," replied Muzimo.</p>

<p>"He is gone from the village," explained Orando. "It was thought
that maybe<sup><b>____</b></sup>"</p>

<p>"I went to hunt. Your food is no good; you spoil it with fire."
He squatted down at the bole of a tree and cut meat from his kill,
which he ate, growling. The warriors looked on terrified, giving
him a wide berth.</p>

<p>When he had finished his meal he arose and stretched his great
frame, and the action reminded them of Simba, the lion. "Muzimo is
ready," he announced. "If the Utengas are ready let us go."</p>

<p>Orando gathered his warriors. He selected his captains and gave
the necessary orders for the conduct of the march. This all
required time, as no point could be decided without a general
argument in which all participated whether the matter concerned
them or not.</p>

<p>Muzimo stood silently aside. He was wondering about these
people. He was wondering about himself. Physically he and they were
much alike; yet in addition to the difference in coloration there
were other differences, those he could see and those he could not
see but sensed. The Spirit of Nyamwegi was like them and like him,
too; yet here again was a vast difference. Muzimo knit his brows in
perplexity. Vaguely, he almost recalled a fleeting memory that
seemed the key to the riddle; but it eluded him. He felt dimly that
he had had a past, but he could not recall it. He recalled only the
things that he had seen and the experiences that had come to him
since Orando had freed him from the great tree that had fallen on
him; yet he appreciated the fact that when he had seen each
seemingly new thing he had instantly recognized it for what it
was&mdash;man, the okapi, the buck, each and every animal and bird
that had come within the range of his vision or his sensitive ears
or nostrils. Nor had he been at a loss to meet each new emergency
of life as it confronted him.</p>

<p>He had thought much upon this subject (so much that at times the
effort of sustained thought tired him), and he had come to the
conclusion that somewhere, sometime he must have experienced many
things. He had questioned Orando casually as to the young man's
past, and learned that he could recall events in clear detail as
far back as his early childhood. Muzimo could recall but a couple
of yesterdays. Finally he came to the conclusion that his mental
state must be the natural state of spirits, and because it was so
different from that of man he found in it almost irrefutable proof
of his spirithood. With a feeling of detachment he viewed the
antics of man, viewed them contemptuously. With folded arms he
stood apart in silence, apparently as oblivious to the noisy
bickerings as to the chattering and scolding of The Spirit of
Nyamwegi perched upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>But at last the noisy horde was herded into something
approximating order; and, followed by laughing, screaming women and
children, started upon its march toward high adventure. Not,
however, until the latter turned back did the men settle down to
serious marching, though Lupingu's croakings of eventual disaster
had never permitted them to forget the seriousness of their
undertaking.</p>

<p>For three days they marched, led by Orando and guided by Muzimo.
The spirits of the warriors were high as they approached their
goal. Lupingu had been silenced by ridicule. All seemed well.
Muzimo had told them that the village of the Leopard Men lay near
at hand and that upon the following morning he would go ahead alone
and reconnoiter.</p>

<p>With the dawning of the fourth day all were eager, for Orando
had never ceased to incite them to anger against the murderers of
Nyamwegi. Constantly he had impressed them with the fact that The
Spirit of Nyamwegi was with them to watch over and protect them,
that his own <i>muzimo</i> was there to insure them victory.</p>

<p>It was while they were squatting about their breakfast fires
that some one discovered that Lupingu was missing. A careful search
of the camp failed to locate him; and it was at once assumed that,
nearing the enemy, he had deserted through fear. Loud was the
condemnation, bitter the scorn that this cowardly defection
aroused. It was still the topic of angry discussion as Muzimo and
The Spirit of Nyamwegi slipped silently away through the trees
toward the village of the Leopard Men.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">A fiber rope about her neck, the girl was being
half led, half dragged through the jungle. A powerful young black
walking ahead of her held the free end of the rope; ahead of him an
old man led the way; behind her was a second young man. All three
were strangely garbed in leopard skins. The heads of leopards,
cunningly mounted, fitted snugly over their woolly pates. Curved
steel talons were fitted to their fingers. Their teeth were filed,
their faces hideously painted. Of the three, the old man was the
most terrifying. He was the leader. The other cringed servilely
when he gave commands.</p>

<br>

<p>The girl could understand little that they said. She had no idea
as to the fate that was destined for her. As yet they had not
injured her, but she could anticipate nothing other than a horrible
termination of this hideous adventure. The young man who led her
was occasionally rough when she stumbled or faltered, but he had
not been actually brutal. Their appearance, however, was sufficient
to arouse the direst forebodings in her mind; and she had always
the recollection of the horrid butchery of the faithful Negro who
had been left to guard her.</p>

<p>Thoughts of him reminded her of the white man who had left him
to protect her. She had feared and mistrusted him; she had wanted
to be rid of him. Now she wished that she were back in his camp.
She did not admire him any more than she had. It was merely that
she considered him the lesser of two evils. As she recalled him she
thought of him only as an ill-mannered boor, as quite the most
disagreeable person she had ever seen. Yet there was that about him
which aroused her curiosity. His English suggested anything other
than illiteracy. His clothes and his attitude toward her placed him
upon the lowest rung of the social scale. He occupied her thoughts
to a considerable extent, but he still remained an inexplicable
enigma.</p>

<p>For two days her captors followed obscure trails. They passed no
villages, saw no other human beings than themselves. Then, toward
the close of the second day they came suddenly upon a large,
palisaded village beside a river. The heavy gates that barred the
entrance were closed, although the sun had not yet set; but when
they had approached closely enough to be recognized they were
admitted following a short parlay between the old man and the
keepers of the gate.</p>

<p>The stronghold of the Leopard Men was the village of Gato
Mgungu, chief of a once powerful tribe that had dwindled in numbers
until now it boasted but this single village. But Gato Mgungu was
also chief of the Leopard Men, a position which carried with it a
sinister power far above that of many a chief whose villages were
more numerous and whose tribes were numerically far stronger. This
was true largely because of the fact that the secret order whose
affairs he administered was recruited from unrelated clans and
villages; and, because of the allegiance enforced by its strict and
merciless code, Gato Mgungu demanded the first loyalty of its
members, even above their loyalty to their own tribes or families.
Thus, in nearly every village within a radius of a hundred miles
Gato Mgungu had followers who kept him informed as to the plans of
other chiefs, followers who must even slay their own kin if the
chief of the Leopard Men so decreed.</p>

<p>In the village of Gato Mgungu alone were all the inhabitants
members of the secret order; in the other villages his adherents
were unknown, or, at most, only suspected of membership in the
feared and hated order. To be positively identified as a Leopard
Man, in most villages, would have been to meet sudden, mysterious
death; for so loathed were they a son would kill his own father if
he knew that he was a member of the sect, and so feared that no man
dared destroy one except in secret lest the wrath and terrible
vengeance of the order fall upon him.</p>

<p>In secret places, deeply hidden in impenetrable jungle, the
Leopard Men of outlying districts performed the abhorrent rites of
the order except upon those occasions when they gathered at the
village of Gato Mgungu, near which was located their temple. Such
was the reason for the gathering that now filled the village with
warriors and for the relatively small number of women and children
that the girl noticed as she was dragged through the gateway into
the main street.</p>

<p>Here the women, degraded, hideous, filed-toothed harpies, would
have set upon her and torn her to pieces but for the interference
of her captors, who laid about them with the hafts of their spears,
driving the creatures off until the old man could make himself
heard. He spoke angrily with a voice of authority; and immediately
the women withdrew, though they cast angry, venomous glances at the
captive that boded no good for her should she fall into their
hands.</p>

<p>Guarding her closely, her three captors led her through a horde
of milling warriors to a large hut before which was seated an old,
wrinkled Negro, with a huge belly. This was Gato Mgungu, chief of
the Leopard Men. As the four approached he looked up, and at sight
of the white girl a sudden interest momentarily lighted his
blood-shot eyes that ordinarily gazed dully from between red and
swollen lids. Then he recognized the old man and addressed him.</p>

<p>"You have brought me a present, Lulimi?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Lulimi has brought a present," replied the old man, "but not
for Gato Mgungu alone."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" The chief scowled now.</p>

<p>"I have brought a present for the whole clan and for the Leopard
God."</p>

<p>"Gato Mgungu does not share his slaves with others," the chief
growled.</p>

<p>"I have brought no slave," snapped Lulimi. It was evident that
he did not greatly fear Gato Mgungu. And why should he, who was
high in the priesthood of the Leopard Clan?</p>

<p>"Then why have you brought this white woman to my village?"</p>

<p>By now there was a dense half-circle of interested auditors
craning their necks to view the prisoner and straining their ears
to catch all that was passing between these two great men of their
little world. For this audience Lulimi was grateful, for he was
never so happy as when he held the center of the stage, surrounded
by credulous and ignorant listeners. Lulimi was a priest.</p>

<p>"Three nights ago we lay in the forest far from the village of
Gato Mgungu, far from the temple of the Leopard God." Already he
could see his auditors pricking up their ears. "It was a dark
night. The lion was abroad, and the leopard. We kept a large fire
burning to frighten them away. It was my turn to watch. The others
slept. Suddenly I saw two green eyes shining just beyond the fire.
They blazed like living coals. They came closer, and I was afraid;
but I could not move. I could not call out. My tongue stuck to the
roof of my mouth. My jaws would not open. Closer and closer they
came, those terrible eyes, until, just beyond the fire, I saw a
great leopard, the largest leopard that I have ever seen. I thought
that the end of my days had come and that I was about to die.</p>

<p>"I waited for him to spring upon me, but he did not spring.
Instead he opened his mouth and spoke to me." Gasps of astonishment
greeted this statement while Lulimi paused for effect.</p>

<p>"What did he say to you?" demanded Gato Mgungu.</p>

<p>"He said, 'I am the brother of the Leopard God. He sent me to
find Lulimi, because he trusts Lulimi. Lulimi is a great man. He is
very brave and wise. There is no one knows as much as Lulimi.'"</p>
<a id="pic8" name="pic8"></a><br>

</div>
<br>

<p>Gato Mgungu looked bored. "Did the Leopard God send his brother
three marches to tell you that?"</p>

<p>"He told me other things, many things. Some of them I can
repeat, but others I may never speak of. Only the Leopard God, and
his brother, and Lulimi know these things."</p>

<p>"What has all this to do with the white woman?" demanded Gato
Mgungu.</p>

<p>"I am getting to that," replied Lulimi sourly. He did not relish
these interruptions. "Then, when the brother of the Leopard God had
asked after my health, he told me that I was to go to a certain
place the next day and that there I should find a white woman. She
would be alone in the jungle with one man. He commanded me to kill
the black man and bring the woman to his temple to be high
priestess of the Leopard Clan. This Lulimi will do. Tonight Lulimi
takes the white high priestess to the great temple. I have
spoken."</p>
<a id="pic9" name="pic9"></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src=

<br>

<p>For a moment there was awed silence. Gato Mgungu did not seem
pleased; but Lulimi was a powerful priest to whom the rank and file
looked up, and he had greatly increased his prestige by this weird
tale. Gato Mgungu was sufficiently a judge of men to know that.
Furthermore, he was an astute old politician with an eye to the
future. He knew that Imigeg, the high priest, was a very old man
who could not live much longer and that Lulimi, who had been laying
his plans to that end for years, would doubtless succeed him.</p>

<p>Now a high priest friendly to Gato Mgungu could do much to
increase the power and prestige of the chief and, incidentally, his
revenues; while one who was inimical might threaten his ascendancy.
Therefore, reading thus plainly the handwriting on the wall, Gato
Mgungu seized this opportunity to lay the foundations of future
friendship and understanding between them though he knew that
Lulimi was an old fraud and his story doubtless a canard.</p>

<p>Many of the warriors, having sensed in the chief's former
attitude a certain antagonism to Lulimi, were evidently waiting a
cue from their leader. As Gato Mgungu jumped, so would the majority
of the fighting men; but when the day came that a successor to
Imigeg must be chosen it would be the priests who would make the
selection, and Gato Mgungu knew that Lulimi had a long memory.</p>

<p>All eyes were upon the chief as he cleared his royal throat. "We
have heard the story of Lulimi," he said. "We all know Lulimi. In
his own village he is a great witch-doctor. In the temple of the
Leopard God there is no greater priest after Imigeg. It is not
strange that the brother of the Leopard God should speak to
Lulimi&mdash;Gato Mgungu is only a fighting man. He does not talk
with gods and demons. This is not a matter for warriors. It is a
matter for priests. All that Lulimi has said we believe, but let us
take the white woman to the temple. The Leopard God and Imigeg will
know whether the jungle leopard spoke true words to Lulimi or not.
Has not my tongue spoken wise words, Lulimi?"</p>

<p>"The tongue of Gato Mgungu, the chief, always speaks wise
words," replied the priest, who was inwardly delighted that the
chief's attitude had not been, as he had feared, antagonistic. And
thus the girl's fate was decided by the greed of corrupt
politicians, temporal and ecclesiastical, suggesting that the
benighted of central Africa are in some respects quite as civilized
as we.</p>

<p>As preparations were being made to conduct the girl to the
temple, a lone warrior, sweat-streaked and breathless, approached
the gates of the village. Here he was halted, but when he had given
the secret sign of the Leopard Clan he was admitted. There was much
excited jabbering at the gateway; but to all questions the newcomer
insisted that he must speak to Gato Mgungu immediately upon a
matter of urgent importance, and presently he was brought before
the chief.</p>

<p>Again he gave the secret sign of the Leopard Clan as he faced
Gato Mgungu.</p>

<p>"What message do you bring?" demanded the chief.</p>

<p>"A few hours' march from here a hundred Utenga warriors led by
Orando, the son of Lobongo, the chief, are waiting to attack your
village. They come to avenge Nyamwegi of Kibbu, who was killed by
members of the clan. If you send warriors at once to hide beside
the trail they can ambush the Utengas and kill them all."</p>

<p>"Where lies their camp?"</p>

<p>The messenger described the location minutely; and when he had
finished, Gato Mgungu ordered a sub-chief to gather three hundred
warriors and march against the invaders; then he turned to the
messenger. "We shall feast tonight upon our enemies," he growled,
"and you shall sit beside Gato Mgungu and have the choicest
morsels."</p>

<p>"I may not remain," replied the messenger. "I must return from
whence I came lest I be suspected of carrying word to you."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Gato Mgungu.</p>

<p>"I am Lupingu of Kibbu, in the Watenga country," replied the
messenger.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap7" id="chap7">VII. &mdash; THE CAPTIVE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">KNOWING nothing of the meaning of what was
transpiring around her, the girl sensed in the excitement and
activity following the coming of the messenger something of the
cause that underlay them. She saw fighting men hurriedly arming
themselves; she saw them depart from the village. In her heart was
a hope that perhaps the enemy they went to meet might be a
succoring party in search of her. Reason argued to the contrary;
but hope catches at straws, unreasoning.</p>

<p>When the war party had departed, attention was again focused
upon the girl. Lulimi waxed important. He ordered people about
right and left. Twenty men armed with spears and shields and
carrying paddles formed about her as an escort. Led by Lulimi, they
marched through the gateway of the village down to the river. Here
they placed her in a large canoe which they launched in silence,
knowing that enemies were not far distant. There was no singing or
shouting as there would have been upon a similar occasion under
ordinary circumstances. In silence they dipped their paddles into
the swift stream; silently they sped with the current down the
broad river, keeping close to the river bank upon the same side as
that upon which they had launched the craft by the village of Gato
Mgungu.</p>

<p>Poor little Kali Bwana! They had taken the rope from about her
neck; they treated her now with a certain respect, tinged with awe,
for was she not to be the high priestess of the Leopard God? But of
that she knew nothing. She could only wonder, as numb with
hopelessness she watched the green verdure of the river bank move
swiftly past. Where were they taking her? To what horrid fate? She
noted the silence and the haste of her escort; she recalled the
excitement following the coming of the messenger to the village and
the hasty exodus of the war party.</p>

<p>All these facts combined to suggest that her captors were
hurrying her away from a rescuing party. But who could have
organized such an expedition? Who knew of her plight? Only the
bitter man of rags and patches. But what could he do to effect her
rescue, even if he cared to do so? It had been evident to her that
he was a poor and worthless vagabond. His force consisted now of
but two natives. His camp, he had told her, was several marches
from where he had found her. He could not possibly have obtained
reinforcements from that source in the time that had elapsed since
her capture, even if they existed, which she doubted. She could not
imagine that such a sorry specimen of poverty commanded any
resources whatever. Thus she was compelled to abandon hope of
succor from this source; yet hope did not die. In the last
extremity one may always expect a miracle.</p>

<p>For a mile or two the canoe sped down the river, the paddles
rising and falling with clock-like regularity and almost in
silence; then suddenly the speed of the craft was checked, and its
nose turned toward the bank. Ahead of them the girl saw the mouth
of a small affluent of the main river, and presently the canoe slid
into its sluggish waters.</p>

<p>Great trees arched above the narrow, winding stream; dense
underbrush choked the ground between their boles; matted vines and
creepers clung to their mossy branches, or hung motionless in the
breathless air, trailing almost to the surface of the water;
gorgeous blooms shot the green with vivid color. It was a scene of
beauty, yet there hung about it an air of mystery and death like a
noxious miasma. It reminded the girl of the face of a lovely woman
behind whose mask of beauty hid a vicious soul. The silence, the
scent of rotting things in the heavy air oppressed her.</p>

<p>Just ahead a great, slimy body slid from a rotting log into the
slow moving waters. It was a crocodile. As the canoe glided
silently through the semi-darkness the girl saw that the river was
fairly alive with these hideous reptiles whose presence served but
to add to the depression that already weighed so heavily upon
her.</p>

<p>She sought to arouse her drooping spirits by recalling the faint
hope of rescue that she had entertained and clung to ever since she
had been so hurriedly removed from the village. Fortunately for her
peace of mind she did not know her destination, nor that the only
avenue to it lay along this crocodile-infested stream. No other
path led through the matted jungle to the cleverly hidden temple of
the Leopard God. No other avenue than this fetid river gave ingress
to it, and this was known to no human being who was not a Leopard
Man.</p>

<p>The canoe had proceeded up the stream for a couple of miles when
the girl saw upon the right bank just ahead of them a large,
grass-thatched building. Unaccustomed as she had been during the
past few months to seeing any structure larger than the ordinary
native huts, the size of this building filled her with
astonishment. It was quite two hundred long and fifty wide, nor
less than fifty feet in height. It lay parallel to the river, its
main entrance being in the end they were approaching. A wide
verandah extended across the front of the building and along the
side facing the river. The entire structure was elevated on piles
to a height of about ten feet above the ground. She did not know
it, but this was the temple of the Leopard God, whose high
priestess she was destined to be.</p>

<p>As the canoe drew closer to the building a number of men emerged
from its interior. Lulimi rose from the bottom of the craft where
he had been squatting and shouted a few words to the men on the
temple porch. They were the secret passwords of the order, to which
one of the guardians of the temple replied, whereupon the canoe
drew in to the shore.</p>

<p>A few curious priests surrounded Lulimi and the girl as the old
man escorted her up the temple steps to the great entrance flanked
by grotesquely carved images and into the half-light of the
interior. Here she found herself in an enormous room open to the
rafters far above her head. Hideous masks hung upon the supporting
columns with shields, and spears, and knives, and human skulls.
Idols, crudely carved, stood about the floor. Many of these
represented a human body with the head of an animal, though so rude
was the craftsmanship that the girl could not be certain what
animal they were intended to represent. It might be a leopard, she
thought.</p>

<p>At the far end of the room, which they were approaching, she
discerned a raised dais. It was, in reality, a large platform paved
with clay. Upon it, elevated a couple of feet, was a smaller dais
about five feet wide and twice as long, which was covered with the
skins of animals. A heavy post supporting a human skull was set in
the center of the long dimension of the smaller dais close to its
rear edge. These details she noted only casually at the time. She
was to have reason to remember them vividly later.</p>

<p>As Lulimi led her toward the dais a very old man emerged from an
opening in the wall at its back and came toward them. He had a
particularly repellant visage, the ugliness of which was
accentuated by the glowering scowl with which he regarded her.</p>

<p>As his old eyes fell upon Lulimi they were lighted dimly by a
feeble ray of recognition. "It is you?" he mumbled. "But why do you
bring this white woman? Who is she? A sacrifice?"</p>

<p>"Listen, Imigeg," whispered Lulimi, "and think well. Remember
your prophecy."</p>

<p>"What prophecy?" demanded the high priest querulously. He was
very old; and his memory sometimes played him tricks, though he did
not like to admit it.</p>

<p>"Long ago you said that some day a white priestess would sit
with you and the Leopard God, here on the great throne of the
temple. Now your prophecy shall be fulfilled. Here is the white
priestess, brought by Lulimi, just as you prophesied."</p>

<p>Now Imigeg did not recall having made any such prophecy, for the
very excellent reason that he never had done so; but Lulimi was a
wily old person who knew Imigeg better than Imigeg knew himself. He
knew that the old high priest was rapidly losing his memory; and he
knew, too, that he was very sensitive on the subject, so sensitive
that he would not dare deny having made such a prophecy as Lulimi
imputed to him.</p>

<p>For reasons of his own Lulimi desired a white priestess. Just
how it might redound to his benefit is not entirely clear, but the
mental processes of priests are often beyond the ken of lay minds.
Perhaps his reasons might have been obvious to a Hollywood
publicity agent; but however that may be, the method he had adopted
to insure the acceptance of his priestess was entirely
successful.</p>

<p>Imigeg swallowed the bait, hook, line, and sinker. He swelled
with importance. "Imigeg talks with the demons and the spirits," he
said; "they tell him everything. When we have human flesh for the
Leopard God and his priests, the white woman shall be made high
priestess of the order."</p>

<p>"That should be soon then," announced Lulimi.</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" demanded Imigeg.</p>

<p>"My <i>muzimo</i> came to me and told me that the warriors now
in the village of Gato Mgungu would march forth today, returning
with food enough for all."</p>

<p>"Good," exclaimed Imigeg quickly; "it is just as I prophesied
yesterday to the lesser priests."</p>

<p>"Tonight then," said Lulimi. "Now you will want to have the
white woman prepared."</p>

<p>At the suggestion Imigeg clapped his hands, whereupon several of
the lesser priests advanced. "Take the woman," he instructed one of
them, "to the quarters of the priestesses. She is to be high
priestess of the order. Tell them this and that they shall prepare
her. Tell them, also, that Imigeg holds them responsible for her
safety."</p>

<p>The lesser priest led the girl through the opening at the rear
of the dais, where she discovered herself in a corridor flanked on
either side by rooms. To the door of one of these the man conducted
her and, pushing her ahead, entered. It was a large room in which
were a dozen women, naked but for tiny G strings. Nearly all of
them were young; but there was one toothless old hag, and it was
she whom the man addressed.</p>

<p>The angry and resentful movement of the women toward the white
girl at the instant that she entered the room was halted at the
first words of her escort. "This is the new high priestess of the
Leopard God," he announced. "Imigeg sends orders that you are to
prepare her for the rites to be held tonight. If any harm befalls
her you will be held accountable, and you all know the anger of
Imigeg."</p>

<p>"Leave her with me," mumbled the old woman. "I have served in
the temple through many rains, but I have not filled the belly of
the Leopard God yet."</p>

<p>"You are too old and tough," snarled one of the younger
women.</p>

<p>"You are not," snapped the old hag. "All the more reason that
you should be careful not to make Imigeg angry, or Mumga, either.
Go," she directed the priest. "The white woman will be safe with
old Mumga."</p>

<p>As the man left the room the women gathered about the girl.
Hatred distorted their features. The younger women tore at her
clothing. They pushed and pulled her about, all the while jabbering
excitedly; but they did not injure her aside from a few scratches
from claw-like nails.</p>

<p>The reason for bringing her here at all was unknown to Kali
Bwana; the intentions of the women were, similarly, a mystery.
Their demeanor boded her no good, and she believed that eventually
they would kill her. Their degraded faces, their sharp-filed,
yellow fangs, their angry voices and glances left no doubt in her
mind as to the seriousness of her situation or the desires of the
harpies. That a power which they feared restrained them she did not
know. She saw only the menace of their attitude toward her and
their rough and brutal handling of her.</p>

<p>One by one they stripped her garments from her until she stood
even more naked than they, and then she was accorded a respite as
they fell to fighting among themselves for her clothing. For the
first time she had an opportunity to note her surroundings. She saw
that the room was the common sleeping and eating apartment of the
women. Straw mats were stretched across one of its sides. There was
a clay hearth at one end directly below a hole in the roof, through
which some of the smoke from a still smoldering fire was finding
its way into the open air, though most of it hung among the rafters
of the high ceiling, from whence it settled down to fill the
apartment with acrid fumes. A few cooking pots stood on or beside
the hearth. There were earthen jars and wooden boxes, fiber baskets
and pouches of skin strewn upon the floor along the walls, many
near the sleeping mats. From pegs stuck in the walls depended an
array of ornaments and finery: strings of beads, necklaces of human
teeth and of the teeth of leopards, bracelets of copper and iron
and anklets of the same metals, feather head-dresses and
breastplates of metal and of hide, and innumerable garments
fashioned from the black-spotted, yellow skins of leopards.
Everything in the apartment bespoke primitive savagery in keeping
with its wild and savage inmates.</p>

<p>When the final battle for the last vestige of her apparel had
terminated, the women again turned their attention to the girl. Old
Mumga addressed her at considerable length, but Kali Bwana only
shook her head to indicate that she could understand nothing that
was said to her. Then at a word from the old woman they laid hold
of her again, none too gently. She was thrown upon one of the
filthy sleeping mats, an earthen jar was dragged to the side of the
mat, and two young women proceeded to anoint her with a vile
smelling oil, the base of which might have been rancid butter. This
was rubbed in by rough hands until her flesh was almost raw; then a
greenish liquid, which smelled of bay leaves and stung like fire,
was poured over her; and again she was rubbed until the liquid had
evaporated.</p>

<p>When this ordeal had been concluded, leaving her weak and sick
from its effects, she was clothed. Much discussion accompanied this
ceremony, and several times women were sent to consult Imigeg and
to fetch apparel from other parts of the temple. Finally they
seemed satisfied with their handiwork, and Kali Bwana, who had worn
some of the most ridiculous creations of the most famous couturiers
of Paris, stood clothed as she had never been clothed before.</p>

<br>

<p>First they had adjusted about her slim, fair waist a loin cloth
made from the skins of unborn leopard cubs; and then, over one
shoulder, had been draped a gorgeous hide of vivid yellow, spotted
with glossy black. This garment hung in graceful folds almost to
her knee on one side, being shorter on the other. A rope of leopard
tails gathered it loosely about her hips. About her throat was a
necklace of human teeth; upon her wrists and arms were heavy
bracelets, at least two of which she recognized as a gold. In
similar fashion were her ankles adorned, and then more necklaces
were hung about her neck. Her head-dress consisted of a diadem of
leopard skin supporting a variety of plumes and feathers which
entirely encircled her head. But the finishing touch brought a
chill of horror to her; long, curved talons of gold were affixed to
her fingers and thumbs, recalling the cruel death of the black who
had striven so bravely and so futilely to protect her.</p>

<p>Thus was Kali Bwana prepared for the hideous rites of the
Leopard Men that would make her high priestess of their savage
god.</p>

<h2><a name="chap8" id="chap8">VIII. &mdash; TREASON UNMASKED</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">MUZIMO loafed through the forest. He was glad to
be alone, away from the noisy, boasting creatures that were men.
True, The Spirit of Nyamwegi was given to boasting; but Muzimo
never paid much attention to him. Sometimes he chided him for
behaving so much like men; and as long as The Spirit of Nyamwegi
could remember, he was quiet; but his memory was short. Only when a
certain stern expression entered the eyes of Muzimo and he spoke in
a low voice that was half growl, was The Spirit of Nyamwegi quiet
for long; but that occurred only when there was important need for
silence.</p>

<p>Muzimo and The Spirit of Nyamwegi had departed early from the
camp of the Utengas for the purpose of locating and spying upon the
village of the Leopard Men, but time meant nothing to Muzimo. This
thing that he had set out to do, he would do when he was ready. So
it was that the morning was all but spent before Muzimo caught
sight of the village.</p>

<p>The warriors had already departed in search of the enemies from
Watenga, and Muzimo had not seen them because he had taken a
circuitous route from the camp to the village. The girl had also
been taken away to the temple, though even had she still been there
her presence would have meant nothing to the ancestral spirit of
Orando, who was no more concerned with the fate of whites than he
was with the fate of Negroes.</p>

<p>The village upon which he looked from the concealing verdure of
a nearby tree differed little from the quiet native village of
Tumbai except that its palisade was taller and stronger. There were
a few men and women in its single main street, the former lolling
in the shade of trees, the latter busy with the endless duties of
their sex, which they lightened by the world-wide medium of
gossip.</p>

<p>Muzimo was not much interested in what he saw, at least at
first. There was no great concourse of warriors. A hundred Utengas,
if they could surprise the village, could wreak vengeance upon it
easily. He noted, however, that the gates were thick and high, that
they were closed, and that a guard of warriors squatted near them
in the shade of the palisade. Perhaps, he thought, it would be
better to take the place by night when a few agile men might scale
the palisade undetected and open the gates for their fellows. He
finally decided that he would do that himself without assistance.
For Muzimo it would be a simple matter to enter the village
undetected.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes were arrested by a group before a large hut.
There was a large man, whom he intuitively knew to be the chief,
and there were several others with whom he was conversing; but it
was not the chief who arrested his attention. It was one of the
others. Instantly Muzimo recognized him, and his grey eyes
narrowed. What was Lupingu doing in the village of the Leopard Men?
It was evident that he was not a prisoner, for it was plainly to be
seen that the conversation between the men was amicable.</p>

<p>Muzimo waited. Presently he saw Lupingu leave the party before
the chief's hut and approach the gates. He saw the warriors on
guard open them, and he saw Lupingu pass through them and disappear
into the forest in the direction of the camp of the Utengas. Muzimo
was puzzled. What was Lupingu going to do? What had he already
done? Perhaps he had gone to spy upon the Leopard Men and was
returning with information for Orando.</p>

<p>Silently Muzimo slipped from the tree in which he had been
hiding, and swung through the trees upon the trail of Lupingu, who,
ignorant of the presence of the Nemesis hovering above him, trotted
briskly in the direction of the camp of the tribesmen he had
betrayed.</p>

<p>Presently from a distance, far ahead, Muzimo heard sounds,
sounds that the ears of Lupingu could not hear. They told him that
many people were coming through the forest in his direction. Later
he interpreted them as the sounds made by warriors marching
hurriedly. They were almost upon him before Lupingu heard them.
When he did he went off from the trail a short distance and hid in
the underbrush.</p>

<p>Muzimo waited among the foliage above the trees. He had caught
the scent of the oncoming men and had recognized none that was
familiar to him. It was the scent of warriors, and mixed with it
was the scent of fresh blood. Some of them were wounded. They had
been in battle.</p>

<p>Presently they came in sight; and he saw that they were not the
Utengas, as his nostrils had already told him. He guessed that they
were from the village of the Leopard Men, and that they were
returning to it. This accounted for the small number of warriors
that he had seen in the village. Where had they been? Had they been
in battle with Orando's little force?</p>

<p>He counted them, roughly, as they passed below him. There were
nearly three hundred of them, and Orando had but a hundred
warriors. Yet he was sure that Orando had not been badly defeated,
for he saw no prisoners nor were they bringing any dead warriors
with them, not even their own dead, as they would have, if they
were Leopard Men and had been victorious.</p>

<p>Evidently, whoever they had fought, and it must have been
Orando, had repulsed them; but how had the Utengas fared? Their
losses must have been great in battle with a force that so greatly
outnumbered them. But all this was only surmise. Presently he would
find the Utengas and learn the truth. In the meantime he must keep
an eye on Lupingu who was still hiding at one side of the
trail.</p>

<p>When the Leopard Men had passed, Lupingu came from his
concealment, and continued on in the direction he had been going,
while above him and a little in his rear swung Muzimo and The
Spirit of Nyamwegi.</p>

<p>When they came at last to the place where the Utengas had
camped, they found only grim reminders of the recent battle; the
Utengas were not there. Lupingu looked about him, a pleased smile
on his crafty face. His efforts had not been in vain; the Leopard
Men had at least driven the Utengas away, even though it had been
as evident to him as it had been to Muzimo that their victory had
been far from decisive.</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated, of two minds as to whether to follow
his former companions, or return to the village and take part in
the ceremonies at the temple at the installation of the white
priestess; but at last he decided that the safer plan was to rejoin
the Utengas, lest a prolonged absence should arouse their
suspicions as to his loyalty. He did not know that the matter was
not in his hands at all, or that a power far greater than his own
lurked above him, all but reading his mind, a power that would have
frustrated an attempt to return to the village of Gato Mgungu and
carried him by force to the new camp of Orando.</p>

<p>Lupingu had jogged on along the plain trail of the retreating
Utengas for a couple of miles when he was halted by a sentry whom
he recognized at once as the brother of the girl whose affections
Nyamwegi had stolen from him. When the sentry saw that it was
Lupingu, the traitor was permitted to pass; and a moment later he
entered the camp, which he found bristling with spears, the
nerve-shaken warriors having leaped to arms at the challenge of the
sentry.</p>

<p>There were wounded men groaning upon the ground, and ten of the
Utenga dead were stretched out at one side of the camp, where a
burial party was digging a shallow trench in which to inter
them.</p>

<p>A volley of questions was hurled at Lupingu as he sought out
Orando, and the angry or suspicious looks that accompanied them
warned him that his story must be a most convincing one if it were
to avail him.</p>

<p>Orando greeted him with a questioning scowl. "Where have you
been, Lupingu, while we were fighting?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I, too, have been fighting," replied Lupingu glibly.</p>

<p>"I did not see you," countered Orando. "You were not there. You
were not in camp this morning. Where were you? See that your tongue
speaks no lies."</p>

<p>"My tongue speaks only true words," insisted Lupingu. "Last
night I said to myself: 'Orando does not like Lupingu. There are
many who do not like Lupingu. Because he advised them not to make
war against the Leopard Men they do not like him. Now he must do
something to show them that he is a brave warrior. He must do
something to save them from the Leopard Men.'</p>

<p>"And so I went out from camp while it was still dark to search
for the village of the Leopard Men, that I might spy upon them and
bring word to Orando. But I did not find the village. I became
lost, and while I was searching for it I met many warriors. I did
not run. I stood and fought with them until I had killed three.
Then some came from behind and seized me. They made me prisoner,
and I learned that I was in the hands of the Leopard Men.</p>

<p>"Later they fought with you. I could not see the battle, as
their guards held me far behind the fighting men; but after a while
the Leopard Men ran away, and I knew that the Utengas had been
victorious. In the excitement I escaped and hid. When they had all
gone I came at once to the camp of Orando."</p>

<p>The son of Lobongo, the chief, was no fool. He did not believe
Lupingu's story, but he did not guess the truth. The worst
interpretation that he put on Lupingu's desertion was cowardice in
the face of an impending battle; but that was something to be
punished by the contempt of his fellow warriors and the ridicule of
the women of his village when he returned to Kibbu.</p>

<p>Orando shrugged. He had other, more important matters to occupy
his thoughts. "If you want to win the praise of warriors," he
advised, "remain and fight beside them." Then he turned away.</p>

<p>With startling suddenness that shocked the frayed nerves of the
Utengas, Muzimo and The Spirit of Nyamwegi dropped unexpectedly
into their midst from the overhanging branches of a tree. Once
again three score spears danced nervously, their owners ready to
fight or fly as the first man set the example; but when they saw
who it was their fears were calmed; and perhaps they felt a little
more confidence, for the presence of two friendly spirits is most
reassuring to a body of half defeated warriors fearful of the
return of the enemy.</p>

<p>"You have had a battle," said Muzimo to Orando. "I saw the
Leopard Men running away; but your men act as though they, too, had
been defeated. I do not understand."</p>

<p>"They came to our camp and fell upon us while we were
unprepared," explained Orando. "Many of our men were killed or
wounded in their first charge, but the Utengas were brave. They
rallied and fought the Leopard Men off, killing many, wounding
many; then the Leopard Men ran away, for we were fighting more
bravely than they.</p>

<p>"We did not pursue them, because they greatly outnumbered us.
After the battle my men were afraid they might return in still
greater numbers. They did not wish to fight any more. They said
that we had won, and that now Nyamwegi was fully avenged. They want
to go home. Therefore we fell back to this new camp. Here we bury
our dead. Tomorrow we do what the gods decide. I do not know.</p>

<p>"What I <i>should</i> like to know, though, is how the Leopard
Men knew we were here. They shouted at us and told us that the god
of the Leopard Men had sent them to our camp to get much flesh for
a great feast. They said that tonight they would eat us all. It was
those words that frightened the Utengas and made them want to go
home."</p>

<p>"Would you like to know who told the Leopard Men that you were
coming and where your camp was?" asked Muzimo.</p>

<p>Lupingu's eyes reflected a sudden fear. He edged off toward the
jungle. "Watch Lupingu," directed Muzimo, "lest he go again to 'spy
upon the Leopard Men.'" The words were scarcely uttered before
Lupingu bolted; but a dozen warriors blocked his way; and presently
he was dragged back, struggling and protesting. "It was not a god
that told the Leopard Men that the Utengas were coming," continued
Muzimo. "I crouched in a tree above their village, and saw the one
who told them talking to their chief. Very friendly were they, as
though both were Leopard Men. I followed him when he left the
village. I saw him hide when the retreating warriors passed in the
jungle. I followed him to the camp of the Utengas. I heard his
tongue speak lies to Orando. I am Muzimo. I have spoken."</p>

<p>Instantly hoarse cries for vengeance arose. Men fell upon
Lupingu and knocked him about. He would have been killed at once
had not Muzimo interfered. He seized the wretched man and shielded
him with his great body, while The Spirit of Nyamwegi fled to the
branches of a tree and screamed excitedly as he danced up and down
in a perfect frenzy of rage, though what it was all about he did
not know.</p>

<p>"Do not kill him," commanded Muzimo, sternly. "Leave him to
me."</p>

<p>"The traitor must die," shouted a warrior.</p>

<p>"Leave him to me," reiterated Muzimo.</p>

<p>"Leave him to Muzimo," commanded Orando; and at last,
disgruntled, the warriors desisted from their attempts to lay hands
upon the wretch.</p>

<p>"Bring ropes," directed Muzimo, "and bind his wrists and his
ankles."</p>

<p>When eager hands had done as Muzimo bid, the warriors formed a
half circle before him and Lupingu, waiting expectantly to witness
the death of the prisoner, which they believed would take the form
of some supernatural and particularly atrocious manifestation.</p>

<p>They saw Muzimo lift the man to one broad shoulder. They saw him
take a few running steps, leap as lightly into the air as though he
bore no burden whatsoever, seize a low-hanging limb as he swung
himself upward, and disappear amidst the foliage above, melting
into the shadows of the coming dusk.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap9" id="chap9">IX. &mdash; THE LEOPARD GOD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">NIGHT was approaching. The sun, half hidden by the
tops of forest trees, swung downward into the west. Its departing
rays turned the muddy waters of a broad river into the semblance of
molten gold. A ragged white man emerged from a forest trail upon
the outskirts of a broad field of manioc, at the far side of which
a palisaded village cast long shadows back to meet the shadows of
the forest where he stood with his two black companions. To his
right the forest hemmed the field and came down to overhang the
palisade at the rear of the village.</p>

<p>"Do not go on, Bwana," urged one of the blacks. "It is the
village of the Leopard Men."</p>

<p>"It is the village of old Gato Mgungu," retorted Old Timer. "I
have traded with him in the past."</p>

<p>"Then you came with many followers and with guns; then Gato
Mgungu was a trader. Today you come with only two <i>boys;</i>
today you will find that old Gato Mgungu is a Leopard Man."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" exclaimed the white man. "He would not dare harm a
white."</p>

<p>"You do not know them," insisted the black. "They would kill
their own mothers for flesh if there was no one to see them do
it."</p>

<p>"Every sign that we have seen indicates that the girl was
brought here," argued Old Timer. "Leopard Men or no Leopard Men, I
am going into the village."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to die," said the Negro.</p>

<p>"Nor do I," agreed his fellow.</p>

<p>"Then wait for me in the forest. Wait until the shadow of the
forest has left the palisade in the morning. If I have not returned
then, go back to the camp where the young bwana waits and tell him
that I am dead."</p>

<p>The blacks shook their heads. "Do not go, Bwana. The white woman
was not your wife, neither was she your mother nor your sister. Why
should you die for a woman who was nothing to you?"</p>

<p>Old Timer shook his head. "You would not understand." He
wondered if he himself understood. Vaguely he realized that the
force that was driving him on was not governed by reason; back of
it was something inherent, bred into his fiber through countless
generations of his kind. Its name was duty. If there was another
more powerful force actuating him he was not conscious of it.
Perhaps there was no other. There were lesser forces, though, and
one of them was anger and another, desire for revenge. But two days
of tracking through the jungle had cooled these to the point where
he would no longer have risked his life to gratify them. It was the
less obvious but more powerful urge that drove him on.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall return in a few minutes," he said, "but if not,
then until tomorrow morning!" He shook their hands in parting.</p>

<p>"Good luck, Bwana!"</p>

<p>"May the good spirits watch over you, Bwana!"</p>

<p>He strode confidently along the path that skirted the manioc
field toward the gates set in the palisade. Savage eyes watched his
approach. Behind him the eyes of his servitors filled with tears.
Inside the palisade a warrior ran to the hut of Gato Mgungu.</p>

<p>"A white man is coming," he reported. "He is alone."</p>

<p>"Let him enter, and bring him to me," ordered the chief.</p>

<p>As Old Timer came close to the gates one of them swung open. He
saw a few warriors surveying him more or less apathetically. There
was nothing in their demeanor to suggest antagonism, neither was
their greeting in any way friendly. Their manner was wholly
perfunctory. He made the sign of peace, which they ignored; but
that did not trouble him. He was not concerned with the attitude of
warriors, only with that of Gato Mgungu, the chief. As he was, so
would they be.</p>

<p>"I have come to visit my friend, Gato Mgungu," he announced.</p>

<p>"He is waiting for you," replied the warrior who had taken word
of his coming to the chief. "Come with me."</p>

<p>Old Timer noted the great number of warriors in the village.
Among them he saw wounded men and knew that there had been a
battle. He hoped that they had been victorious. Gato Mgungu would
be in better humor were such the case. The scowling, unfriendly
glances of the villagers did not escape him as he followed his
guide toward the hut of the chief. On the whole, the atmosphere of
the village was far from reassuring; but he had gone too far to
turn back, even had he been of a mind to do so.</p>

<p>Gato Mgungu received him with a surly nod. He was sitting on a
stool in front of his hut surrounded by a number of his principal
followers. There was no answering smile or pleasant word to Old
Timer's friendly greeting. The aspect of the situation appeared far
from roseate.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" demanded Gato Mgungu.</p>

<p>The smile had faded from the white man's face. He knew that this
was no time for soft words. There was danger in the very air. He
sensed it without knowing the reason for it; and he knew that a
bold front, alone, might release him from a serious situation.</p>

<p>"I have come for the white girl," he said.</p>

<p>Gato Mgungu's eyes shifted. "What white girl?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Do not lie to me with questions,"' snapped Old Timer. "The
white girl is here. For two days I have followed those who stole
her from my camp. Give her to me. I wish to return to my people who
wait for me in the forest."</p>

<p>"There is no white girl in my village," growled Gato Mgungu,
"nor do I take orders from white men. I am Gato Mgungu, the chief.
I give orders."</p>

<p>"You'll take orders from me, you old scoundrel," threatened the
other, "or I'll have a force down on your village that'll wipe it
off the map."</p>

<p>Gato Mgungu sneered. "I know you, white man. There are two of
you and six black men in your safari. You have few guns. You are
poor. You steal ivory. You do not dare go where the white rulers
are. They would put you in jail. You come with big words, but big
words do not frighten Gato Mgungu; and now you are my
prisoner."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" demanded Old Timer. "What do you think
you're going to do with me?"</p>

<p>"Kill you," replied Gato Mgungu.</p>

<p>The white man laughed. "No you won't; not if you know what's
good for you. The government would burn your village and hang you
when they found it out."</p>

<p>"They will not find it out," retorted the chief. "Take him away.
See that he does not escape."</p>

<p>Old Timer looked quickly around at the evil, scowling faces
surrounding him. It was then that he recognized the chief, Bobolo,
with whom he had long been upon good terms. Two warriors laid heavy
hands upon him to drag him away. "Wait!" he exclaimed, thrusting
them aside. "Let me speak to Bobolo. He certainly has sense enough
to stop this foolishness."</p>

<p>"Take him away!" shouted Gato Mgungu.</p>

<p>Again the warriors seized him, and as Bobolo made no move to
intercede in his behalf the white man accompanied his guard without
further remonstration. After disarming him they took him to a small
hut, filthy beyond description, and, tying him securely, left him
under guard of a single sentry who squatted on the ground outside
the low doorway; but they neglected to remove the pocket knife from
a pocket in his breeches.</p>

<p>Old Timer was very uncomfortable. His bonds hurt his wrists and
ankles. The dirt floor of the hut was uneven and hard. The place
was alive with crawling, biting things. It was putrid with foul
stenches. In addition to these physical discomforts the outlook was
mentally distressing. He began to question the wisdom of his
quixotic venture and to upbraid himself for not listening to the
counsel of his two followers.</p>

<p>But presently thoughts of the girl and the horrid situation in
which she must be, if she still lived, convinced him that even
though he had failed he could not have done otherwise than he had.
He recalled to his mind a vivid picture of her as he had last seen
her, he recounted her perfections of face and figure, and he knew
that if chance permitted him to escape from the village of Gato
Mgungu he would face even greater perils to effect her rescue.</p>

<p>His mind was still occupied with thoughts of her when he heard
someone in conversation with his guard, and a moment later a figure
entered the hut. It was now night; the only light was that
reflected from the cooking fires burning about the village and a
few torches set in the ground before the hut of the chief. The
interior of his prison was in almost total darkness. The features
of his visitor were quite invisible. He wondered if he might be the
executioner, come to inflict the death penalty pronounced by the
chief; but at the first words he recognized the voice of
Bobolo.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can help you," said his visitor. "You would like to
get out of here?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Old Mgungu must have gone crazy. What's the matter
with the old fool, anyway?"</p>

<p>"He does not like white men. I am their friend. I will help
you."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Bobolo," exclaimed Old Timer. "You'll never
regret it."</p>

<p>"It cannot be done for nothing," suggested Bobolo.</p>

<p>"Name your price."</p>

<p>"It is not my price," the black hastened to assure him; "it is
what I shall have to pay to others."</p>

<p>"Well, how much?"</p>

<p>"Ten tusks of ivory."</p>

<p>Old Timer whistled. "Wouldn't you like a steam yacht and a Rolls
Royce, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Bobolo, willing to accept anything whether or not
he knew what it was.</p>

<p>"Well, you don't get them; and, furthermore, ten tusks are too
many."</p>

<p>Bobolo shrugged. "You know best, white man, what your life is
worth." He arose to go.</p>

<p>"Wait!" exclaimed Old Timer. "You know it is hard to get any
ivory these days."</p>

<p>"I should have asked for a hundred tusks; but you are a friend,
and so I asked only ten."</p>

<p>"Get me out of here and I will bring the tusks to you when I get
them. It may take time, but I will bring them."</p>

<p>Bobolo shook his head. "I must have the tusks first. Send word
to your white friend to send me the tusks; then you will be
freed."</p>

<p>"How can I send word to him? My men are not here."</p>

<p>"I will send a messenger."</p>

<p>"All right, you old horse-thief," consented the white. "Untie my
wrists and I'll write a note to him."</p>

<p>"That will not do. I would not know what the paper that talks
said. It might say things that would bring trouble to Bobolo."</p>

<p>"You're darn right it would," soliloquized Old Timer. "If I
could get the notebook and pencil out of my pocket The Kid would
get a message that would land you in jail and hang Gato Mgungu into
the bargain." But aloud he said, "How will he know that the message
is from me?"</p>

<p>"Send something by the messenger that he will know is yours. You
are wearing a ring. I saw it today."</p>

<p>"How do I know you will send the right message?" demurred Old
Timer. "You might demand a hundred tusks."</p>

<p>"I am your friend. I am very honest. Also, there is no other
way. Shall I take the ring?"</p>

<p>"Very well; take it."</p>

<p>The Negro stepped behind Old Timer and removed the ring from his
finger. "When the ivory comes you will be set free," he said as he
stooped, and passed out of the hut.</p>

<p>"I don't take any stock in the old fraud," thought the white
man, "but a drowning man clutches at a straw."</p>

<p>Bobolo grinned as he examined the ring by the light of a fire.
"I am a bright man," he muttered to himself. "I shall have a ring
as well as the ivory." As for freeing Old Timer, that was beyond
his power; nor had he any intention of even attempting it. He was
well contented with himself when he joined the other chiefs who
were sitting in council with Gato Mgungu.</p>

<p>They were discussing, among other things, the method of
dispatching the white prisoner. Some wished to have him slain and
butchered in the village that they might not have to divide the
flesh with the priests and the Leopard God at the temple. Others
insisted that he be taken forthwith to the high priest that his
flesh might be utilized in the ceremonies accompanying the
induction of the new white high priestess. There was a great deal
of oratory, most of which was in apropos; but that is ever the way
of men in conferences. Black or white they like to hear their own
voices.</p>

<p>Gato Mgungu was in the midst of a description of heroic acts
that he had performed in a battle that had been fought twenty years
previously when he was silenced by a terrifying interruption. There
was a rustling of the leaves in the tree that overhung his hut; a
heavy object hurtled down into the center of the circle formed by
the squatting councilors, and as one man they leaped to their feet
in consternation. Expressions of surprise, awe, or terror were
registered upon every countenance. They turned affrighted glances
upward into the tree, but nothing was visible there among the dark
shadows; then they looked down at the thing lying at their feet. It
was the corpse of a man, its wrists and ankles bound, its throat
cut from ear to ear.</p>

<p>"It is Lupingu, the Utenga," whispered Gato Mgungu. "He brought
me word of the coming of the son of Lobongo and his warriors."</p>

<p>"It is an ill omen," whispered one.</p>

<p>"They have punished the traitor," said another.</p>

<p>"But who could have carried him into the tree and thrown him
down upon us?" demanded Bobolo.</p>

<p>"He spoke today of one who claimed to be the <i>muzimo</i> of
Orando," explained Gato Mgungu, "a huge white man whose powers were
greater than the powers of Sobito, the witch-doctor of Tumbai."</p>

<p>"We have heard of him from another," interjected a chief.</p>

<p>"And he spoke of another," continued Gato Mgungu, "that is the
spirit of Nyamwegi of Kibbu, who was killed by children of the
Leopard God. This one has taken the form of a little monkey."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was the <i>muzimo</i> that brought Lupingu here,"
suggested Bobolo. "It is a warning. Let us take the white man to
the high priest to do with as he sees fit. If he kills him the
fault will not be ours."</p>

<p>"Those are the words of a wise man." The speaker was one who
owed a debt to Bobolo.</p>

<p>"It is dark," another reminded them; "perhaps we had better wait
until morning."</p>

<p>"Now is the time," said Gato Mgungu. "If the <i>muzimo</i> is
white and is angry because we have made this white man prisoner, he
will hang around the village as long as we keep the other here. We
will take him to the temple. The high priest and the Leopard God
are stronger than any <i>muzimo."</i></p>

<p>Hidden amidst the foliage of a tree Muzimo watched the blacks in
the palisaded village below. The Spirit of Nyamwegi, bored by the
sight, disgusted with all this wandering about by night, had fallen
asleep in his arms. Muzimo saw the warriors arming and forming
under the commands of their chiefs. The white prisoner was dragged
from the hut in which he had been imprisoned, the bonds were
removed from his ankles, and he was hustled under guard toward the
gateway through which the warriors were now debouching upon the
river front. Here they launched a flotilla of small canoes (some
thirty of them) each with a capacity of about ten men, for there
were almost three hundred warriors of the Leopard God in the party,
only a few having been left in the village to act as a guard. The
large war canoes, seating fifty men, were left behind, bottom up,
upon the shore.</p>

<p>As the last canoe with its load of painted savages drifted down
the dark current, Muzimo and The Spirit of Nyamwegi dropped from
the tree that had concealed them and followed along the shore. An
excellent trail paralleled the river; and along this Muzimo
trotted, keeping the canoes always within hearing.</p>

<p>The Spirit of Nyamwegi, aroused from sound sleep to follow many
more of the hated Gomangani than he could count, was frightened and
excited. "Let us turn back," he begged. "Why must we follow all
these Gomangani who will kill us if they catch us, when we might be
sleeping safely far away in a nice large tree?"</p>

<p>"They are the enemies of Orando," explained Muzimo. "We follow
to see where they are going and what they are going to do."</p>

<p>"I do not care where they are going or what they are going to
do," whimpered The Spirit of Nyamwegi; "I am sleepy. If we go on,
Sheeta will get us or Sabor or Numa; if not they, then the
Gomangani. Let us go back."</p>

<p>"No," replied the white giant. "I am a <i>muzimo. Muzimos</i>
must know everything. Therefore I must go about by night as well as
by day watching the enemies of Orando. If you do not wish to come
with me climb a tree and sleep."</p>

<p>The Spirit of Nyamwegi was afraid to go on with Muzimo, but he
was more afraid to remain alone in this strange forest; so he said
nothing more about the matter as Muzimo trotted along the dark
trail beside the dark, mysterious river.</p>

<p>They had covered about two miles when Muzimo became aware that
the canoes had stopped, and a moment later he came to the bank of a
small affluent of the larger stream. Into this the canoes were
moving slowly in single file. He watched them, counting, until the
last had entered the sluggish stream and disappeared in the
darkness of the overhanging verdure; then, finding no trail, he
took to the trees, following the canoes by the sound of the dipping
paddles beneath him.</p>

<p>It chanced that Old Timer was in a canoe commanded by Bobolo,
and he took advantage of the opportunity to ask the chief whither
they were taking him and why; but Bobolo cautioned him to silence,
whispering that at present no one must know of his friendship for
the prisoner. "Where you are going you will be safer; your enemies
will not be able to find you," was the most that he would say.</p>

<p>"Nor my friends either," suggested Old Timer; but to that Bobolo
made no answer.</p>

<p>The surface of the stream beneath the trees, which prevented
even the faint light of a moonless sky from reaching it, was
shrouded in utter darkness. Old Timer could not see the man next to
him, nor his hand before his face. How the paddlers guided their
craft along this narrow, tortuous river appeared little less than a
miracle to him, yet they moved steadily and surely toward their
destination. He wondered what that destination might be. There
seemed something mysterious and uncanny in the whole affair. The
river itself was mysterious. The unwonted silence of the warriors
accentuated the uncanniness of the situation. Everything combined
to suggest to his imagination a company of dead men paddling up a
river of death, three hundred Charons escorting his dead soul to
Hell. It was not a pleasant thought; he sought to thrust it from
his mind, but there was none more pleasant to replace it. It seemed
to Old Timer that his fortunes never before had been at such low
ebb.</p>

<p>"At least," he soliloquized, "I have the satisfaction of knowing
that things could get no worse."</p>

<p>One thought which recurred persistently caused him the most
concern. It was of the girl and her fate. While he was not
convinced that she had not been in the village while he was captive
there, he felt that such had not been the case. He realized that
his judgment was based more upon intuition than reason, but the
presentiment was so strong that it verged upon conviction. Being
positive that she had been brought to the village only a short time
before his arrival, he sought to formulate some reasonable
conjecture as to the disposition the savages had made of her. He
doubted that they had killed her as yet. Knowing, as he did, that
they were cannibals, he was positive that the killing of the girl,
if they intended to kill her, would be reserved for a spectacular
ceremony and followed by a dance and an orgy. There had not been
time for such a celebration since she had been brought to the
village; therefore it seemed probable that she had preceded him up
this mysterious river of darkness.</p>

<p>He hoped that this last conjecture might prove correct, not only
because of the opportunity it would afford to rescue her from her
predicament (provided that lay within his power) but because it
would bring him near her once more where, perchance, he might see
or even touch her. Absence had but resulted in stimulating his mad
infatuation for her. Mere contemplation of her charms aroused to
fever heat his longing for her, redoubled his anger against the
savages who had abducted her.</p>

<p>His mind was thus occupied by these complex emotions when his
attention was attracted by a light just ahead upon the right bank
of the stream. At first he saw only the light, but presently he
perceived human figures dimly illuminated by its rays and behind it
the outlines of a large structure. The number of the figures
increased rapidly and more lights appeared. He saw that the former
were the crews of the canoes which had preceded his and the latter
torches borne by people coming from the structure, which he now saw
was a large building.</p>

<p>Presently his own canoe pulled in to the bank, and he was
hustled ashore. Here, among the warriors who had come from the
village, were savages clothed in the distinctive apparel of the
Leopard Men. It was these who had emerged from the building,
carrying torches. A few of them wore hideous masks. They were the
priests of the Leopard God.</p>

<p>Slowly there was dawning upon the consciousness of the white man
the realization that he had been brought to that mysterious temple
of the Leopard Men of which he had heard frightened, whispered
stories from the lips of terrified blacks upon more than a single
occasion, and which he had come to consider more fabulous than
real. The reality of it, however, was impressed upon him with
overpowering certainty when he was dragged through the portals of
the building into its barbaric interior.</p>

<p>Lighted by many torches, the scene was one to be indelibly
impressed upon the memory of a beholder. Already the great chamber
was nearly filled with the warriors from the village of Gato
Mgungu. They were milling about several large piles of leopard
skins presided over by masked priests who were issuing these
ceremonial costumes to them. Gradually the picture changed as the
warriors donned the garb of their savage order, until the white man
saw about him only the black and yellow hides of the carnivores;
the curved, cruel, steel talons; and the black faces, hideously
painted, partially hidden by the leopard head helmets.</p>

<p>The wavering torchlight played upon carved and painted idols; it
glanced from naked human skulls, from gaudy shields and grotesque
masks hung upon the huge pillars that supported the roof of the
building. It lighted, more brilliantly than elsewhere, a raised
dais at the far end of the chamber, where stood the high priest
upon a smaller platform at the back of the dais. Below and around
him were grouped a number of lesser priests; while chained to a
heavy post near him was a large leopard, bristling and growling at
the massed humanity beneath him, a devil-faced leopard that seemed
to the imagination of the white man to personify the savage
bestiality of the cult it symbolized.</p>

<p>The man's eyes ranged the room in search of the girl, but she
was nowhere to be seen. He shuddered at the thought that she might
be hidden somewhere in this frightful place, and would have risked
everything to learn, had his guards given him the slightest
opportunity. If she were here her case was hopeless, as hopeless as
he now realized his own to be; for since he had become convinced
that he had been brought to the temple of the Leopard Men, allowed
to look upon their holy of holies, to view their most secret rites,
he had known that no power on earth could save him; and that the
protestations and promises of Bobolo had been false, for no one
other than a Leopard Man could look upon these things and live.</p>

<p>Gato Mgungu, Bobolo, and the other chiefs had taken their places
in front of the common warriors at the foot of the dais. Gato
Mgungu had spoken to the high priest, and now at a word from the
latter his guards dragged Old Timer forward and stood with him at
the right of the dais. Three hundred pairs of evil eyes, filled
with hatred, glared at him&mdash;savage eyes, hungry eyes.</p>

<p>The high priest turned toward the snarling, mouthing leopard.
"Leopard God," he cried in a high, shrill voice, "the children of
the Leopard God have captured an enemy of his people. They have
brought him here to the great temple. What is the will of the
Leopard God?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence during which all eyes were fixed
upon the high priest and the leopard. Then a weird thing happened,
a thing that turned the skin of the white man cold and stiffened
the hairs upon his scalp. From the snarling mouth of the leopard
came human speech. It was incredible, yet with his own ears he
heard it.</p>

<p>"Let him die that the children of the Leopard God may be fed!"
The voice was low and husky and merged with bestial growls. "But
first bring forth the new high priestess of the temple that my
children may look upon her whom my brother commanded Lulimi to
bring from a far country."</p>

<p>Lulimi, who by virtue of his high priestly rank stood nearest to
the throne of the high priest, swelled visibly with pride. This was
the big moment for which he had waited. All eyes were upon him. He
trod a few steps of a savage dance, leaped high into the air, and
voiced a hideous cry that echoed through the lofty rafters far
above. The lay brothers were impressed; they would not soon forget
Lulimi. But instantly their attention was distracted from Lulimi to
the doorway at the rear of the dais. In it stood a girl, naked but
for a few ornaments. She stepped out upon the dais, to be followed
immediately by eleven similarly garbed priestesses. Then there was
a pause.</p>

<p>Old Timer wondered which of these was the new high priestess.
There was little difference between them other than varying degrees
of age and ugliness. Their yellow teeth were filed to sharp points;
the septa of their noses were pierced, and through these holes were
inserted ivory skewers; the lobes of their ears were stretched to
their shoulders by heavy ornaments of copper, iron, brass, and
ivory; their faces were painted a ghoulish blue and white.</p>

<p>Now the Leopard God spoke again. "Fetch the high priestess!" he
commanded, and with three hundred others Old Timer centered his
gaze again upon the aperture at the back of the dais. A figure,
dimly seen, approached out of the darkness of the chamber beyond
until it stood in the doorway, the flare of the torches playing
upon it.</p>

<p>The white man stifled a cry of astonishment and horror. The
figure was that of the girl whom he sought.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10">X. &mdash; WHILE THE PRIESTS
SLEPT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS Kali Bwana was pushed into the doorway at the
rear of the dais by the old hag who was her chief guardian, she
paused in consternation and horror at the sight which met her eyes.
Directly before her stood the high priest, terrifying in his weird
costume and horrid mask, and near him a great leopard, nervous and
restless on its chain. Beyond these was a sea of savage, painted
faces and grotesque masks, discernible vaguely in the light of
torches against a background of leopard skins.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the room was heavy with the acrid stench of
bodies. A wave of nausea surged over the girl; she reeled slightly
and placed the back of one hand across her eyes to shut out the
terrifying sight.</p>

<p>The old woman behind her whispered angrily and shoved her
forward. A moment later Imigeg, the high priest, seized her hand
and drew her to the center of the smaller, higher dais beside the
growling leopard. The beast snarled and sprang at her; but Imigeg
had anticipated such an emergency, and the leopard was brought to a
sudden stop by its chain before its raking talons touched the soft
flesh of the shrinking girl.</p>

<p class="caption">The high priest seized her.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Old Timer shuddered as the horror of her position impressed
itself more deeply upon his consciousness. His rage against the men
and his own futility left him weak and trembling. His utter
helplessness to aid her was maddening, as the sight of her
redoubled the strength of his infatuation. He recalled the harsh
and bitter things he had said to her, and he flushed with shame at
the recollection. Then the eyes of the girl, now taking in the
details of the scene before her, met his. For a moment she regarded
him blankly; then she recognized him. Surprise and incredulity were
written upon her countenance. At first she did not realize that he,
too, was a prisoner. His presence recalled his boorish and
ungallant attitude toward her at their first meeting. She saw in
him only another enemy; yet the fact that he was a white man
imparted a new confidence. It did not seem possible that even he
would stand idly by and permit a white woman to be imprisoned and
maltreated by Negroes. Slowly, then, it dawned upon her that he was
a prisoner as well as she; and though the new hope waned, there
still remained a greater degree of confidence than she had felt
before.</p>

<p>She wondered what queer trick of fate had brought them together
again thus. She could not know, nor even dream, that he had been
captured in an effort to succor her. Perhaps had she known and
known, too, the impulse that had actuated him, even the slight
confidence that his presence imparted to her would have been
dissipated; but she did not know. She only realized that he was a
man of her own race, and that because he was there she felt a
little braver.</p>

<p>As Old Timer watched the slender, graceful figure and beautiful
face of the new high priestess of the Leopard God, other eyes
surveyed and appraised her. Among these were the eyes of
Bobolo&mdash;savage, bloodshot eyes; greedy, lustful eyes. Bobolo
licked his lips hungrily. The savage chief was hungry, but not for
food.</p>

<p>The rites of installation were proceeding. Imigeg held the
center of the stage. He jabbered incessantly. Sometimes he
addressed an underpriest or a priestess, again the Leopard God; and
when the beast answered, it never failed to elicit a subdued gasp
of awe from the assembled warriors, though the white girl and Old
Timer were less mystified or impressed after their first brief
surprise.</p>

<p>There was another listener who also was mystified by the talking
leopard, but who, though he had never heard of a ventriloquist,
pierced the deception with his uncanny perceptive faculties as,
perched upon a tie-beam of the roof that projected beyond the front
wall of the building, he looked through an opening below the
ridgepole at the barbaric scene being enacted beneath him.</p>

<p>It was Muzimo; and beside him, trembling at the sight of so many
leopards, perched The Spirit of Nyamwegi. "I am afraid," he said;
"Nkima is afraid. Let us go back to the land that is Tarzan's.
Tarzan is king there; here no one knows him, and he is no better
than a Gomangani."</p>

<p>"Always you speak of Nkima and Tarzan," complained Muzimo. "I
have never heard of them. You are The Spirit of Nyamwegi and I am
Muzimo. How many times must I tell you these things?"</p>

<p>"You are Tarzan, and I am Nkima," insisted the little monkey.
"You are a Tarmangani."</p>

<p>"I am the spirit of Orando's ancestor," insisted the other. "Did
not Orando say so?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," sighed The Spirit of Nyamwegi wearily; "I do
not understand the language of the Gomangani. All I know is that I
am Nkima, and that Tarzan has changed. He is not the same since the
tree fell upon him. I also know that I am afraid. I want to go away
from here."</p>

<p>"Presently," promised Muzimo. He was watching the scene below
him intently. He saw the white man and the white girl, and he
guessed the fate that awaited them, but it did not move him to
compassion, nor arouse within him any sense of blood-
responsibility. He was the ancestral spirit of Orando, the son of a
chief; the fate of a couple of strange Tarmangani meant nothing to
him. Presently, however, his observing eyes discovered something
which did arouse his keen interest. Beneath one of the hideous
priest-masks he caught a glimpse of familiar features. He was not
surprised, for he had been watching this particular priest intently
for some time, his attention having been attracted to him by
something familiar in his carriage and conformation. The shadow of
a smile touched the lips of Muzimo. "Come!" he whispered to The
Spirit of Nyamwegi, as he clambered to the roof of the temple.</p>

<p>Sure-footed as a cat he ran along the ridgepole, the little
monkey at his heels. Midway of the building he sprang lightly down
the sloping roof and launched himself into the foliage of a nearby
tree, and as The Spirit of Nyamwegi followed him the two were
engulfed in the Erebusan darkness of the forest.</p>

<p>Inside the temple the priestesses had lighted many fires upon
the large clay dais and swung cooking pots above them on crude
tripods, while from a rear room of the temple the lesser priests
had brought many cuts of meat, wrapped in plantain leaves. These
the priestesses placed in the cooking pots, while the priests
returned for gourds and jugs of native beer, which were passed
among the warriors.</p>

<p>As the men drank they commenced to dance. Slowly at first, their
bodies bent forward from the hips, their elbows raised, they
stepped gingerly, lifting their feet high. In their hands they
grasped their spears and shields, holding them awkwardly because of
the great, curved steel talons affixed to their fingers. Restricted
by lack of space upon the crowded floor, each warrior pivoted upon
the same spot, pausing only to take long drinks from the beer jugs
as they were passed to him. A low, rhythmic chant accompanied the
dance, rising in volume and increasing in tempo as the tempo of the
dance steps increased, until the temple floor was a mass of
howling, leaping savages.</p>

<p>Upon the upper dais the Leopard God, aroused to fury by the din
and movement about him and the scent of the flesh that was cooking
in the pots, strained at his chain, snarling and growling in rage.
The high priest, stimulated by the contents of a beer pot, danced
madly before the frenzied carnivore, leaping almost within reach of
its raking talons, then springing away again as the infuriated
beast struck at him. The white girl shrank to the far side of the
dais, her brain reeling to the hideous pandemonium surrounding her,
half numb from fear and apprehension. She had seen the meat brought
to the cooking pots but had only vaguely guessed the nature of it
until a human hand had fallen from its wrappings of plantain
leaves. The significance of the grisly object terrified and
sickened her.</p>

<p>The white man watching the scene about him looked most often in
her direction. Once he had tried to speak to her; but one of his
guards had struck him heavily across the mouth, silencing him. As
the drinking and the dancing worked the savages into augmented
fury, his concern for the safety of the girl increased. He saw that
religious and alcoholic drunkenness were rapidly robbing them of
what few brains and little self-control Nature had vouchsafed them,
and he trembled to think of what excesses they might commit when
they had passed beyond even the restraint of their leaders; nor did
the fact that the chiefs, the priests, and the priestesses were
becoming as drunk as their followers tend but to aggravate his
fears.</p>

<p>Bobolo, too, was watching the white girl. In his drunken brain
wild schemes were forming. He saw her danger, and he wished to save
her for himself. Just how he was going to possess her was not
entirely clear to his muddled mind, yet it clung stubbornly to the
idea. Then his eyes changed to alight on Old Timer, and a scheme
evolved hazily through the beer fumes.</p>

<p>The white man wished to save the white woman. This fact Bobolo
knew and recalled. If he wished to save her he would protect her.
The white man also wished to escape. He thought Bobolo was his
friend. Thus the premises formed slowly in his addled brain. So
far, so good! The white man would help him abduct the high
priestess, but that could not be effected until practically
everyone was too drunk to prevent the accomplishment of his plan or
remember it afterward. He would have to wait for the proper moment
to arrive, but in the meantime he must get the girl out of this
chamber and hide her in one of the other rooms of the temple.
Already the priestesses were mingling freely with the excited,
drunken warriors; presently the orgy would be in full swing. After
that it was possible that no one might save her; not even the high
priest, who was now quite as drunk as any of them.</p>

<p>Bobolo approached Old Timer and spoke to his guards. "Go and
join the others," he told them. "I will watch the prisoner."</p>

<p>The men, already half drunk, needed no second invitation. The
word of a chief was enough; it released them from all
responsibility. In a moment they were gone. "Quick!" urged Bobolo,
grasping Old Timer by the arm. "Come with me."</p>

<p>The white man drew back. "Where?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am going to help you to escape," whispered Bobolo.</p>

<p>"Not without the white woman," insisted the other.</p>

<p>This reply fitted so perfectly with Bobolo's plans that he was
delighted. "I will arrange that, too; but I must get you out of
here into one of the back rooms of the temple. Then I shall come
back for her. I could not take you both at the same time. It is
very dangerous. Imigeg would have me killed if he discovered it.
You must do just as I say."</p>

<p>"Why do you take this sudden interest in our welfare?" demanded
the white, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Because you are both in danger here," replied Bobolo. "Everyone
is very drunk, even the high priest. Soon there would be no one to
protect either of you, and you would be lost. I am your friend. It
is well for you that Bobolo is your friend and that he is not
drunk."</p>

<p>"Not very!" thought Old Timer as the man staggered at his side
toward a doorway in the rear partition of the chamber.</p>

<p>Bobolo conducted him to a room at the far end of the temple.
"Wait here," he said. "I shall go back and fetch the girl."</p>

<p>"Cut these cords at my wrists," demanded the white. "They
hurt."</p>

<p>Bobolo hesitated, but only for a moment. "Why not?" he asked.
"You do not have to try to escape, because I am going to take you
away myself; furthermore you could not escape alone. The temple
stands upon an island surrounded by the river and swamp land alive
with crocodiles. No trails lead from it other than the river.
Ordinarily there are no canoes here, lest some of the priests or
priestesses might escape. They, too, are prisoners. You will wait
until I am ready to take you away from here."</p>

<p>"Of course I shall. Hurry, now, and bring the white woman."</p>

<p>Bobolo returned to the main chamber of the temple, but this time
he approached it by way of the door that let upon the upper dais at
its rear. Here he paused to reconnoiter. The meat from the cooking
pots was being passed among the warriors, but the beer jugs were
still circulating freely. The high priest lay in a stupor at the
far side of the upper dais. The Leopard God crouched, growling,
over the thigh bone of a man. The high priestess leaned against the
partition close to the doorway where Bobolo stood. The chief
touched her upon the arm. With startled eyes she turned toward
him.</p>

<p>"Come," he whispered and beckoned her to follow.</p>

<p>The girl understood only the gesture, but she had seen this same
man lead her fellow prisoner away from the foot of the dais but a
moment before; and instantly she concluded that by some queer freak
of fate this man might be friendly. Certainly there had been
nothing threatening or unfriendly in his facial expressions as he
had talked to the white man. Reasoning thus, she followed Bobolo
into the gloomy chambers in the rear of the temple. She was afraid,
and how close to harm she was only Bobolo knew. Excited to desire
by propinquity and impelled to rashness by drink, he suddenly
thought to drag her into one of the dark chambers that lined the
corridor along which he was conducting her; but as he turned to
seize her a voice spoke at his elbow.</p>

<p>"You got her more easily than I thought possible." Bobolo
wheeled. "I followed you," continued Old Timer, "thinking you might
need help."</p>

<p>The black chief grunted angrily, but the surprise had brought
him to his senses. A scream or the noise of a scuffle might have
brought a guardian of the temple to investigate, which would have
meant death for Bobolo. He made no reply, but led them back to the
room in which he had left Old Timer.</p>

<p>"Wait here for me," he cautioned them. "If you are discovered do
not say that I brought you here. If you do I shall not be able to
save you. Say that you were afraid and came here to hide." He
turned to go.</p>

<p>"Wait," said Old Timer. "Suppose we are unable to get this girl
away from here; what will become of her?"</p>

<p>Bobolo shrugged. "We have never before had a white priestess.
Perhaps she is for the Leopard God, perhaps for the high priest,
who knows?" Then he left them.</p>

<p>"'Perhaps for the Leopard God, perhaps for the high priest,'"
repeated Kali Bwana when the man had translated the words. "Oh, how
horrible!"</p>

<p>The girl was standing very close to the white man. He could feel
the warmth of her almost naked body. He trembled, and when he tried
to speak his voice was husky with emotion. He wanted to seize her
and crush her to him. He wanted to cover her soft, warm lips with
kisses. What stayed him he did not know. They were alone at the far
extremity of the temple, the noises of the savage orgy in the main
chamber of the building would have drowned any outcry that she
might make; she was absolutely at his mercy, yet he did not touch
her.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall escape soon," he said. "Bobolo has promised to
take us away."</p>

<p>"You know him and can trust him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I have known him for a couple of years," he replied, "but I do
not trust him. I do not trust any of them. Bobolo is doing this for
a price. He is an avaricious old scoundrel."</p>

<p>"What is the price?"</p>

<p>"Ivory."</p>

<p>"But I have none."</p>

<p>"Neither have I," he admitted, "but I'll get it."</p>

<p>"I will pay you for my share," she offered. "I have money with
an agent at the railhead."</p>

<p>He laughed. "Let's cross that bridge when we get to it, if we
ever do."</p>

<p>"That doesn't sound very reassuring."</p>

<p>"We are in a bad hole," he explained. "We mustn't raise our
hopes too high. Right now our only hope seems to lie in Bobolo. He
is a Leopard Man and a scoundrel, in addition to which he is
drunk&mdash;a slender hope at best."</p>

<p>Bobolo, returning slightly sobered to the orgy, found himself
suddenly frightened by what he had done. To bolster his waning
courage he seized upon a large jug of beer and drained it. The
contents exercised a magical effect upon Bobolo, for when presently
his eyes fell upon a drunken priestess reeling in a corner she was
transformed into a much-to-be-desired houri. An hour later Bobolo
was fast asleep in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>The effects of the native beer wore off almost as rapidly as
they manifested themselves in its devotees, with the result that in
a few hours the warriors commenced to bestir themselves. They were
sick and their heads ached. They wished more beer; but when they
demanded it they learned that there was no more, nor was there any
food. They had consumed all the refreshments, liquid and solid.</p>

<p>Gato Mgungu had never had any of the advantages of civilization
(He had never been to Hollywood); but he knew what to do under the
circumstances, for the psychology of celebrators is doubtless the
same in Africa as elsewhere. When there is nothing more to eat or
drink, it must be time to go home. Gato Mgungu gathered the other
chiefs and transmitted this philosophical reflection to them. They
agreed, Bobolo included. His brain was slightly befogged. He had
already forgotten several events of the past evening, including the
houri-like priestess. He knew that there was something important on
his mind, but he could not recall just what it was; therefore he
herded his men to their canoes just as the other chiefs and headmen
were doing.</p>

<p>Presently he was headed down river, part of a long procession of
war canoes filled with headaches. Back in the temple lay a few
warriors who had still been too drunk to stand. For these they had
left a single canoe. These men were strewn about the floor of the
temple, asleep. Among them were all of the lesser priests and the
priestesses. Imigeg was curled up on one corner of the dais fast
asleep. The Leopard God, his belly filled, slept also.</p>

<p>Kali Bwana and Old Timer, waiting impatiently in the dark room
at the rear of the temple for the return of Bobolo, had noted the
increasing quiet in the front chamber of the building; then they
had heard the preparations for departure as all but a few made
ready to leave. They heard the shuffling of feet as the warriors
passed out of the building; they heard the shouts and commands at
the river bank that told the white man that the natives were
launching their canoes. After that there had been silence.</p>

<p>"Bobolo ought to be coming along," remarked the man.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has gone away and left us," suggested Kali
Bwana.</p>

<p>They waited a little longer. Not a sound came from any part of
the temple nor from the grounds outside. The silence of death
reigned over the holy of holies of the Leopard God. Old Timer
stirred uneasily. "I am going to have a look out there," he said.
"Perhaps Bobolo has gone, and if he has we want to know it." He
moved toward the doorway. "I shall not be gone long," he whispered.
"Do not be afraid."</p>

<p>As the girl waited in the darkness her mind dwelt upon the man
who had just left her. He seemed changed since the time of their
first meeting. He appeared more solicitous as to her welfare and
much less brusque and churlish. Yet she could not forget the harsh
things he had said to her upon that other occasion. She could never
forgive him, and in her heart she still half feared and mistrusted
him. It galled her to reflect that in the event of their escape she
would be under obligation to him, and as these thoughts occupied
her mind Old Timer crept stealthily along the dark corridor toward
the small doorway that opened upon the upper dais.</p>

<p>Only a suggestion of light came through it now to guide his
footsteps, and when he reached it he looked out into an almost
deserted room. The embers of the cooking fires were hidden by white
ashes; only a single torch remained that had not burned out. Its
smoky flame burned steadily in the quiet air, and in its feeble
light he saw the sleepers sprawled upon the floor. In the dim light
he could not distinguish the features of any; so he could not know
if Bobolo were among them. One long searching look he gave that
took in the whole interior of the chamber, a look that assured him
that no single conscious person remained in the temple; then he
turned and hastened back to the girl.</p>

<p>"Did you find him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No. I doubt that he is here. Nearly all of them have left,
except just a few who were too drunk to leave. I think it is our
chance."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"There is no one to prevent our escaping. There may be no canoe.
Bobolo told me that no canoe was ever left here, for fear that the
priests or priestesses might escape. He may have been lying, but
whether he was or not we may as well take the chance. There is no
hope for either of us if we remain here. Even the crocodiles would
be kinder to you than these fiends."</p>

<p>"I will do whatever you say," she replied, "but if at any time I
am a burden, if my presence might hinder your escape, do not
consider me. Go on without me. Remember that you are under no
obligation to me, nor&mdash;" She hesitated and stopped.</p>

<p>"Nor what?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nor do I wish to be under obligation to you. I have not
forgotten the things that you said to me when you came to my
camp."</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment before replying; then he ignored what she
had said. "Come!" he commanded brusquely. "We have no time to
waste."</p>

<p>He walked to a window in the rear wall of the room and looked
out. It was very dark. He could see nothing. He knew that the
building was raised on piles and that the drop to the ground might
prove dangerous; but he also knew that a verandah stretched along
one side of the structure. Whether it continued around to the rear
of the building where this room was located he could not know. To
go out through the main room among all those savages was too
fraught with risk. An alternative was to find their way to one of
the rooms overlooking the verandah that he knew was there on the
river side of the building.</p>

<p>"I think we'll try another room," he whispered. "Give me your
hand, so that we shall not become separated."</p>

<p>She slipped her hand into his. It was tender and warm. Once
again the mad urge of his infatuation rose like a great tide within
him, so that it was with difficulty that he controlled himself, yet
by no sign did he betray his passion to the girl. Quietly they
tiptoed into the dark corridor, the man groping with his free hand
until he found a doorway. Gingerly they crossed the room beyond in
search of a window.</p>

<p>What if this were the apartment of some temple inmate who had
left the orgy to come here and sleep! The thought brought cold
sweat to the man's brow, and he swore in his heart that he would
slay any creature that put itself in the way of the rescue of the
girl; but fortunately the apartment was uninhabited, and the two
came to the window unchallenged. The man threw a leg over the sill,
and a moment later stood upon the verandah beyond; then he reached
in and assisted the girl to his side.</p>

<p>They were near the rear of the building. He dared not chance
detection by going to the stairway that led to the ground from the
front entrance to the temple. "We shall have to climb down one of
the piles that support the building," he explained. "It is possible
that there may be a guard at the front entrance. Do you think that
you can do it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," she replied.</p>

<p>"I'll go first," he said. "If you slip I'll try to hold
you."</p>

<p>"I shall not slip; go ahead."</p>

<p>The verandah had no railing. He lay down and felt beneath its
edge until he found the top of a pile. "Here," he whispered, and
lowered himself over the edge.</p>

<p>The girl followed. He dropped a little lower and guided her legs
until they had found a hold upon the pile, which was the bole of a
young tree about eight inches in diameter. Without difficulty they
reached the ground, and again he took her hand and led her to the
bank of the river. As they moved down stream parallel with the
temple he sought for a canoe, and when they had come opposite the
front of the building he could scarce restrain an exclamation of
relief and delight when they came suddenly upon one drawn up on the
shore, partially out of the water.</p>

<p>Silently they strained to push the heavy craft into the river.
At first it seemed that their efforts would prove of no avail; but
at last it started to slip gently downward, and once it was
loosened from the sticky mud of the bank that same medium became a
slippery slide down which it coasted easily.</p>

<p>He helped her in, shoved the canoe out into the sluggish stream,
and jumped in after her; then with a silent prayer of thanksgiving
they drifted silently down toward the great river.</p>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11">XI. &mdash; BATTLE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">INTO the camp of the sleeping Utengas dropped
Muzimo and The Spirit of Nyamwegi an hour after midnight. No sentry
had seen them pass, a fact which did not at all surprise the
sentries, who knew that spirits pass through the forest unseen at
all times if they choose to do so.</p>

<p>Orando, being a good soldier, had just made the rounds of his
sentry posts and was still awake when Muzimo located him. "What
news have you brought me, O Muzimo?" demanded the son of Lobongo.
"What word of the enemy?"</p>

<p>"We have been to his village," replied Muzimo, "The Spirit of
Nyamwegi, Lupingu, and I."</p>

<p>"And where is Lupingu?"</p>

<p>"He remained there after carrying a message to Gato Mgungu."</p>

<p>"You gave the traitor his liberty!" exclaimed Orando.</p>

<p>"It will do him little good. He was dead when he entered the
village of Gato Mgungu."</p>

<p>"How then could he carry a message to the chief?"</p>

<p>"He carried a message of terror that the Leopard Men understood.
He told them that traitors do not go unpunished. He told them that
the power of Orando is great."</p>

<p>"And what did the Leopard Men do?"</p>

<p>"They fled to their temple to consult the high priest and the
Leopard God. We followed them there; but they did not learn much
from the high priest or the Leopard God, for they all got very
drunk upon beer&mdash;all except the Leopard, and he cannot talk
when the high priest cannot talk. I came to tell you that their
village is now almost deserted except for the women, the children,
and a few warriors. This would be a good time to attack it, or to
lie in ambush near it awaiting the return of the warriors from the
temple. They will be sick, and men do not fight so well when they
are sick."</p>

<p>"Now is a good time," agreed Orando, clapping his palms together
to awaken the sleepers near him.</p>

<p>"In the temple of the Leopard God I saw one whom you know well,"
remarked Muzimo as the sleepy headmen aroused their warriors. "He
is a priest of the Leopard God."</p>

<p>"I know no Leopard Men," replied Orando.</p>

<p>"You knew Lupingu, although you did not know that he was a
Leopard Man," Muzimo reminded him; "and you know Sobito. It was he
whom I saw behind the mask of a priest. He is a Leopard Man."</p>

<p>Orando was silent for a moment. "You are sure?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"When he went to consult the spirits and the demons, and was
gone from the village of Tumbai for many days, he was with the
Leopard Men instead," said Orando. "Sobito is a traitor. He shall
die."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Muzimo, "Sobito shall die. He should have been
killed long ago."</p>

<p>Along the winding forest trail Muzimo guided the warriors of
Orando toward the village of Gato Mgungu. They moved as rapidly as
the darkness and the narrow trail would permit, and at length he
halted them at the edge of the field of manioc that lies between
the forest and the village. After that they crept silently down
toward the river when Muzimo had ascertained that the Leopard Men
had not returned from the temple. There they waited, hiding among
the bushes that grew on either side of the landing place, while
Muzimo departed to scout down the river.</p>

<p>He was gone but a short time when he returned with word that he
had counted twenty-nine canoes paddling up stream toward the
village. "Though thirty canoes went down river to the temple," he
explained to Orando, "these must be the Leopard Men returning."</p>

<p>Orando crept silently among his warriors, issuing instructions,
exhorting them to bravery. The canoes were approaching. They could
hear the paddles now, dipping, dipping, dipping. The Utengas
waited&mdash;tensed, eager. The first canoe touched the bank and
its warriors leaped out. Before they had drawn their heavy craft
out on the shore the second canoe shot in. Still the Utengas
awaited the sign of their leader. Now the canoes were grounding in
rapid succession. A line of warriors was stringing out toward the
village gate. Twenty canoes had been drawn up on the shore when
Orando gave the signal, a savage battle cry that was taken up by
ninety howling warriors as spears and arrows showered into the
ranks of the Leopard Men.</p>

<p>The charging Utengas broke through the straggling line of the
enemy. The Leopard Men, taken wholly by surprise, thought only of
flight. Those who had been cut off at the river sought to launch
their canoes and escape; those who had not yet landed turned their
craft down stream. The remainder tried toward the village, closely
pursued by the Utengas. At the closed gates, which the defenders
feared to open, the fighting was fierce; at the river it was little
better than a slaughter as the warriors of Orando cut down the
terrified Leopard Men struggling to launch their canoes.</p>

<p>When it was too late the warriors left to guard the village
opened the gates with the intention of making a sortie against the
Utengas. Already the last of their companions had been killed or
had fled, and when the gates swung open a howling band of Utengas
swarmed through.</p>

<p>The victory was complete. No living soul was left within the
palisaded village of Gato Mgungu when the blood-spattered warriors
of Orando put the torch to its thatched huts.</p>

<p>From down the river the escaping Leopard Men saw the light of
the flames billowing upward above the trees that lined the bank,
saw their reflection on the surface of the broad river behind them,
and knew the proportions of the defeat that had overwhelmed them.
Gato Mgungu, squatting in the bottom of his canoe, saw the flames
from his burning village, saw in them, perhaps the waning of his
savage, ruthless power. Bobolo saw them and, reading the same
story, knew that Gato Mgungu need no longer be feared. Of all that
band of fleeing warriors Bobolo was the least depressed.</p>

<p>By the light of the burning village Orando took stock of his
losses, mustering his men and searching out the dead and wounded.
From a tree beyond the manioc field a little monkey screamed and
chattered. It was The Spirit of Nyamwegi calling to Muzimo, but
Muzimo did not answer. Among the dead and wounded Orando found him
like mortal clay stretched out upon his back from a blow upon the
head.</p>

<p>The son of the chief was surprised and grieved; his followers
were shocked. They had been certain that Muzimo was of the spirit
world and therefore immune from death. Suddenly they realized that
they had won the battle without his aid. He was a fraud. Filled
with blood lust, they would have vented their chagrin through spear
thrusts into his lifeless body; but Orando stopped them.</p>

<p>"Spirits do not always remain in the same form," he reminded
them. "Perhaps he has entered another body or, unseen, is watching
us from above. If that is so he will avenge any harm that you do
this body he has quitted." In the light of their knowledge this
seemed quite possible to the Utengas; so they desisted from their
proposed mutilation and viewed the body with renewed awe.
"Furthermore," continued Orando, "man or ghost, he was loyal to me;
and those of you who saw him fight know that he fought bravely and
well."</p>

<p>"That is so," agreed a warrior.</p>

<p>"Tarzan! Tarzan!" shrieked The Spirit of Nyamwegi from the tree
at the edge of the manioc field. "Tarzan of the Apes, Nkima is
afraid!"</p>

<p>The white man paddled the stolen canoe down the sluggish stream
toward the great river depending upon the strong current for aid to
carry him and the girl to safety. Kali Bwana sat silent in the
bottom of the craft. She had torn the barbaric headdress from her
brow and the horrid necklace of human teeth from her throat, but
she retained the bracelets and anklets, although why it might have
been difficult for her to explain. Perhaps it was because,
regardless of her plight and all that she had passed through, she
was still a woman&mdash;a beautiful woman. That is something which
one does not easily forget.</p>

<p>Old Timer felt almost certain of success. The Leopard Men who
had preceded him down the stream must have been returning to their
village; there was no reason to expect that they would return
immediately. There was no canoe at the temple; therefore there
could be no pursuit, for Bobolo had assured him that there were no
trails through the forest leading to the temple of the Leopard Men.
He was almost jubilant as the canoe moved slowly into the mouth of
the stream and he saw the dark current of the river stretching
before him.</p>

<p>Then he heard the splash of paddles, and his heart seemed to
leap into his throat. Throwing every ounce of his muscle and weight
into the effort, he turned the prow of the canoe toward the right
bank, hoping to hide in the dense shadows, undiscovered, until the
other craft had passed. It was very dark, so dark that he had
reason to believe that his plan would succeed.</p>

<p>Suddenly the oncoming canoe loomed out of the darkness. It was
only a darker blur against the darkness of the night. Old Timer
held his breath. The girl crouched low behind a gunwale lest her
blonde hair and white skin might be visible to the occupants of the
other boat even in the darkness that engulfed all other objects.
The canoe passed on up the stream.</p>

<p>The broad river lay just ahead now; there, there would be less
danger of detection. Old Timer dipped his paddle and started the
canoe again upon its interrupted voyage. As the current caught it,
it moved more rapidly. They were out upon the river! A dark object
loomed ahead of them. It seemed to rise up out of the water
directly in front of their craft. Old Timer plied his paddle in an
effort to alter the course of the canoe, but too late. There was a
jarring thud as it struck the object in its path, which the man had
already recognized as a canoe filled with warriors.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously another canoe pulled up beside him. There
was a babel of angry questions and commands. Old Timer recognized
the voice of Bobolo. Warriors leaped into the canoe and seized him,
fists struck him, powerful fingers dragged him down. He was
overpowered and bound.</p>

<p>Again he heard the voice of Bobolo. "Hurry! We are being
pursued. The Utengas are coming!"</p>

<p>Brawny hands grasped the paddles. Old Timer felt the canoe shoot
forward, and a moment later it was being driven frantically up the
smaller river toward the temple. The heart of the white man went
cold with dread. He had had the girl upon the threshold of escape.
Such an opportunity would never come again. Now she was doomed. He
did not think of his own fate. He thought only of the girl. He
searched through the darkness with his eyes, but he could not find
her; then he spoke to her. He wanted to comfort her. A new emotion
had suddenly taken possession of him. He thought only of her safety
and comfort. He did not think of himself at all.</p>

<p>He called again, but she did not answer. "Be quiet!" growled a
warrior near him.</p>

<p>"Where is the girl?" demanded the white man.</p>

<p>"Be quiet," insisted the warrior. "There is no girl here."</p>

<p>As the canoe in which Bobolo rode swung alongside that in which
the girl and the white man were attempting to escape, it had
brought the chief close to the former, so close that even in the
darkness of the night he had seen her white skin and her blonde
hair. Instantly he had recognized his opportunity and seized it.
Reaching over the gunwales of the two canoes he had dragged her
into his own; then he had voiced the false alarm that he knew would
send the other canoes off in a panic.</p>

<p>The warriors with him were all his own men. His village lay on
the left bank of the river farther down. A low-voiced command sent
the canoe out into the main current of the river, and willing hands
sped it upon its course.</p>

<p>The girl, who had passed through so much, who had seen escape
almost assured, was stunned by the sudden turn of events that had
robbed her of the only creature to whom she might look for aid and
crushed hope from her breast.</p>

<p>To Old Timer, bound and helpless, the return journey to the
temple was only a dull agony of vain regrets. It made little
difference to him now what they did to him. He knew that they would
kill him. He hoped that the end would come speedily, but he knew
enough about the methods of cannibals to be almost certain that
death would be slow and horrible.</p>

<p>As they dragged him into the temple he saw the floor strewn with
the bodies of the drunken priests and priestesses. The noise of the
entrance aroused Imigeg, the high priest. He rubbed his eyes
sleepily and then rose unsteadily to his feet.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Gato Mgungu strode into the room at the moment, his canoe having
followed closely upon that in which Old Timer had been brought
back. "Enough has happened," he snapped. "While you were all drunk
this white man escaped. The Utengas have killed my warriors and
burned my village. What is the matter with your medicine, Imigeg?
It is no good."</p>

<p>The high priest looked about him, a dazed expression in his
watery eyes. "Where is the white priestess?" he cried. "Did she
escape?"</p>

<p>"I saw only the white man," replied Gato Mgungu.</p>

<p>"The white priestess was there, too," volunteered a warrior.
"Bobolo took her into his canoe."</p>

<p>"Then she should be along soon," offered Gato Mgungu. "Bobolo's
canoe cannot have been far behind mine."</p>

<p>"She shall not escape again," said Imigeg, "nor shall the man.
Bind him well, and put him in the small room at the rear of the
temple."</p>

<p>"Kill him!" cried Gato Mgungu. "Then he cannot run away
again."</p>

<p>"We shall kill him later," replied Imigeg, who had not relished
Gato Mgungu's irreverent tone or his carping criticism and desired
to reassert his authority.</p>

<p>"Kill him now," insisted the chief, "or he will get away from
you again; and if he does, the white men will come with their
soldiers and kill you and burn the temple."</p>

<p>"I am high priest," replied Imigeg haughtily. "I take orders
from no one but the Leopard God. I shall question him. What he says
I shall do." He turned toward the sleeping leopard and prodded it
with a sharp-pointed pole. The great cat leaped to its feet, its
face convulsed by a horrid snarl. "The white man escaped,"
explained Imigeg to the leopard. "He has been captured again. Shall
he die tonight?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the leopard. "Tie him securely and place him in
the small room at the rear of the temple; I am not hungry."</p>

<p>"Gato Mgungu says to kill him now," continued Imigeg.</p>

<p>"Tell Gato Mgungu that I speak only through Imigeg, the high
priest. I do not speak through Gato Mgungu. Because Gato Mgungu had
evil in his mind I have caused his warriors to be slain and his
village to be destroyed. If he thinks evil again he shall be
destroyed that the children of the Leopard God may eat. I have
spoken."</p>

<p>"The Leopard God has spoken," said Imigeg.</p>

<p>Gato Mgungu was deeply impressed and thoroughly frightened.
"Shall I take the prisoner to the back of the temple and see that
he is safely bound?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Imigeg, "take him, and see to it that you bind
him so that he cannot escape."</p>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12">XII. &mdash; THE SACRIFICE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">"TARZAN! Tarzan!" shrieked The Spirit of Nyamwegi
from the tree at the edge of the manioc field. "Tarzan of the Apes,
Nkima is afraid!"</p>

<p>The white giant lying upon the ground opened his eyes and looked
about him. He saw Orando and many warriors gathered about. A
puzzled expression overspread his countenance. Suddenly he leaped
to his feet.</p>

<p>"Nkima! Nkima!" he called in the language of the great apes.
"Where are you, Nkima? Tarzan is here!"</p>

<p>The little monkey leaped from the tree and came bounding across
the field of manioc. With a glad cry he leaped to the shoulder of
the white man and throwing his arms about the bronzed neck pressed
his cheek close to that of his master; and there he clung,
whimpering with joy.</p>

<p>"You see," announced Orando to his fellows, "Muzimo is not
dead."</p>

<p>The white man turned to Orando. "I am not Muzimo," he said; "I
am Tarzan of the Apes." He touched the monkey. "This is not The
Spirit of Nyamwegi; it is Nkima. Now I remember everything. For a
long time I have been trying to remember but until now I could
not&mdash;not since the tree fell upon me."</p>

<p>There was none among them who had not heard of Tarzan of the
Apes. He was a legend of the forest and the jungle that had reached
to their far country. Like the spirits and the demons which they
never saw, they had never expected to see him. Perhaps Orando was a
little disappointed, yet, on the whole, it was a relief to all of
them to discover that this was a man of flesh and blood, motivated
by the same forces that actuated them, subject to the same laws of
Nature that controlled them. It had always been a bit disconcerting
never to be sure in what strange form the ancestral spirit of
Orando might choose to appear, nor to know of a certainty that he
would turn suddenly from a benign to a malign force; and so they
accepted him in his new role, but with this difference: where
formerly he had seemed the creature of Orando, doing his bidding as
a servant does the bidding of his master, now he seemed suddenly
clothed in the dignity of power and authority. The change was so
subtly wrought that it was scarcely apparent and was due,
doubtless, to the psychological effect of the reawakened mentality
of the white man over that of his black companions.</p>

<p>They made camp beside the river near the ruins of Gato Mgungu's
village, for there were fields of manioc and plantain that, with
the captured goats and chickens of the Leopard Men, insured full
bellies after the lean fare of the days of marching and
fighting.</p>

<p>During the long day Tarzan's mind was occupied with many
thoughts. He had recalled now why he had come into this country,
and he marvelled at the coincidence of later events that had guided
his footsteps along the very paths that he had intended treading
before accident had robbed him of the memory of his purpose. He
knew now that depredations by Leopard Men from a far country had
caused him to set forth upon a lonely reconnaissance with only the
thought of locating their more or less fabled stronghold and
temple. That he should be successful in both finding these and
reducing one of them was gratifying in the extreme, and he felt
thankful now for the accident that had been responsible for the
results.</p>

<p>His mind was still not entirely clear on certain details; but
these were returning gradually, and as evening fell and the evening
meal was under way he suddenly recalled the white man and the white
girl whom he had seen in the temple of the Leopard God. He spoke to
Orando about them, but the black knew nothing of them.</p>

<p>"If they were in the temple they probably have been killed."</p>

<p>Tarzan sat immersed in thought for a long time. He did not know
these people, yet he felt a certain obligation to them because they
were of his race. Finally he arose and called Nkima, who was
munching on a plantain that a warrior was sharing with him.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Orando.</p>

<p>"To the temple of the Leopard God," replied Tarzan.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Old Timer had lain all day securely bound and
without food or water. Occasionally a priest or a priestess had
looked in to see that he had not escaped or loosened his bonds, but
otherwise he had been left alone. The inmates of the temple had
stirred but little during the day, most of them being engaged in
sleeping off the effects of the previous night's debauch; but with
the coming of night the prisoner heard increased evidence of
activity. There were sounds of chanting from the temple chamber,
and above the other noises the shrill voice of the high priest and
the growls of the leopard. His thoughts during those long hours
were often of the girl. He had heard the warrior tell Imigeg that
Bobolo had captured her, and supposed that she was again being
forced to play her part on the dais with the Leopard God. At least
he might see her again (that would be something), but hope that he
might rescue her had ebbed so low that it might no longer be called
hope.</p>

<p>He was trying to reason against his better judgment that having
once escaped from the temple they could do so again, when a priest
entered the room, bearing a torch. He was an evil- appearing old
fellow, whose painted face accentuated the savagery of the visage.
He was Sobito, the witch-doctor of Tumbai. Stooping, he commenced
to untie the cords that secured the white man's ankles.</p>
<a id="pic12" name="pic12"></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src=
"0500201h-images/TarzanAndTheLeopardMen-04.jpg" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">A priest entered the room, bearing a torch.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"What are they going to do to me?" demanded Old Timer.</p>

<p>A malevolent grin bared Sobito's yellow fangs. "What do you
suppose, white man?"</p>

<p>Old Timer shrugged. "Kill me, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Not too quickly," explained Sobito. "The flesh of those who die
slowly and in pain is tender."</p>

<p>"You old devil!" exclaimed the prisoner.</p>

<p>Sobito licked his lips. He delighted in inflicting torture
either physical or mental. Here was an opportunity he could not
forego. "First your arms and legs will be broken," he explained;
"then you will be placed upright in a hole in the swamp and
fastened so that you cannot get your mouth or nose beneath the
surface and drown yourself. You will be left there three days, by
which time your flesh will be tender." He paused.</p>

<p>"And then?" asked the white. His voice was steady. He had
determined that he would not give them the added satisfaction of
witnessing his mental anguish, and when the time came that he must
suffer physically he prayed that he might have the strength to
endure the ordeal in a manner that would reflect credit upon his
race. Three days! God, what a fate to anticipate!</p>

<p>"And then?" repeated Sobito. "Then you will be carried into the
temple, and the children of the Leopard God will tear you to pieces
with their steel claws. Look!" He exhibited the long, curved
weapons which dangled from the ends of the loose leopard skin
sleeves of his garment.</p>

<p>"After which you will eat me, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I hope you choke."</p>

<p>Sobito had at last untied the knots that had secured the bonds
about the white man's ankles. He gave him a kick and told him to
rise.</p>

<p>"Are you going to kill and eat the white girl, too?" demanded
Old Timer.</p>

<p>"She is not here. Bobolo has stolen her. Because you helped her
to escape, your suffering shall be greater. I have already
suggested to Imigeg that he remove your eyeballs after your arms
and legs are broken. I forgot to tell you that we shall break each
of them in three or four places."</p>

<p>"Your memory is failing," commented Old Timer, "but I hope that
you have not forgotten anything else."</p>

<p>Sobito grunted. "Come with me," he commanded, and led the white
man through the dark corridor to the great chamber where the
Leopard Men were gathered.</p>

<p>At sight of the prisoner a savage cry broke from a hundred and
fifty throats, the leopard growled, the high priest danced upon the
upper dais, the hideous priestesses screamed and leaped forward as
though bent upon tearing the white man to pieces. Sobito pushed the
prisoner to the summit of the lower dais and dragged him before the
high priest. "Here is the sacrifice!" he screamed.</p>

<p>"Here is the sacrifice!" cried Imigeg, addressing the Leopard
God. "What are your commands, O father of the leopard
children?"</p>

<p>The bristling muzzle of the great beast wrinkled into a snarl as
Imigeg prodded him with his sharp pole, and from the growling
throat the answer seemed to come. "Let him be broken, and on the
third night let there be a feast!"</p>

<p>"And what of Bobolo and the white priestess?" demanded
Imigeg.</p>

<p>"Send warriors to fetch them to the temple that Bobolo may be
broken for another feast. The white girl I give to Imigeg, the high
priest. When he tires of her we shall feast again."</p>

<p>"It is the word of the Leopard God," cried Imigeg. "As he
commands, it shall be done."</p>

<p>"Let the white man be broken," growled the leopard, "and on the
third night let my children return that each may be made wise by
eating the flesh of a white man. When you have eaten of it the
white man's weapons can no longer harm you. Let the white man be
broken!"</p>

<p>"Let the white man be broken!" shrieked Imigeg.</p>

<p>Instantly a half dozen priests leaped forward and seized the
prisoner, throwing him heavily to the clay floor of the dais, and
here they pinioned him, stretching his arms and legs far apart,
while four priestesses armed with heavy clubs rushed forward. A
drum commenced to boom somewhere in the temple, weirdly, beating a
cadence to which the priestesses danced about the prostrate form of
their victim.</p>

<p>Now one rushed in and flourished her club above the prisoner;
but a priest pretended to protect him, and the woman danced out
again to join her companions in the mad whirl of the dance. Again
and again was this repeated, but each succeeding time the priests
seemed to have greater difficulty in repulsing the maddened
women.</p>

<p>That it was all acting (part of a savage ceremony) the white man
realized almost from the first, but what it was supposed to portray
he could not imagine. If they had hoped to wring some evidence of
fear from him, they failed. Lying upon his back, he watched them
with no more apparent concern than an ordinary dance might have
elicited.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because of his seeming indifference that they
dragged the dance out to great lengths, that they howled the
louder, and that the savagery of their gestures and their screams
beggared description; but the end, he knew, was inevitable. The
fate that Sobito had pictured had been no mere idle threat. Old
Timer had long since heard that among some cannibal tribes this
method of preparing human flesh was the rule rather than the
exception. The horror of it, like a loathsome rat, gnawed at the
foundations of the citadel of his reason. He sought to keep his
mind from contemplation of it, lest he go mad.</p>

<p>The warriors, aroused to frenzy by the dancing and the drum,
urged the priestesses on. They were impatient for the climax of the
cruel spectacle. The high priest, master showman, sensed the temper
of his audience. He made a signal, and the drumming ceased. The
dancing stopped. The audience went suddenly quiet. Silence even
more terrifying than the din which had preceded it enveloped the
chamber. It was then that the priestesses, with raised clubs, crept
stealthily toward their helpless victim.</p>

<p class="first">KALI BWANA crouched in the bottom of the canoe;
she heard the rhythmic dip of the paddles as powerful arms sent the
craft swiftly down stream with the current. She knew that they were
out on the bosom of the large river, that they were not returning
to the temple nor up stream to the village of Gato Mgungu. Where,
then, to what new trials was fate consigning her?</p>

<p>Bobolo leaned toward her and whispered, "Do not be afraid. I am
taking you away from the Leopard Men."</p>

<p>She understood just enough of the tribal dialect that he
employed to catch the sense of what he had said. "Who are you?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I am Bobolo, the chief," he replied.</p>

<p>Instantly she recalled that the white man had hoped for aid from
this man, for which he was to pay him in ivory. Her hopes rose. Now
she could purchase safety for both of them. "Is the white man in
the canoe?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied Bobolo.</p>

<p>"You promised to save him," she reminded him.</p>

<p>"I could save but one," replied Bobolo.</p>

<p>"Where are you taking me?"</p>

<p>"To my village. There you will be safe. Nothing can harm
you."</p>

<p>"Then you will take me on down river to my own people?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Maybe so after a while," he answered. "There is no hurry. You
stay with Bobolo. He will be good to you, for Bobolo is a very big
chief with many huts and many warriors. You shall have lots of
food; lots of slaves; no work."</p>

<p>The girl shuddered, for she knew the import of his words. "No!"
she cried. "Oh, please let me go. The white man said that you were
his friend. He will pay you; I will pay you."</p>

<p>"He will never pay," replied Bobolo. "If he is not already dead,
he will be in a few days."</p>

<p>"But I can pay," she pleaded. "Whatever you ask I will pay you
if you will deliver me safely to my own people."</p>

<p>"I do not want pay," growled Bobolo; "I want you."</p>

<p>She saw that her situation was without hope. In all this hideous
land the only person who knew of her danger and might have helped
her was either dead or about to die, and she could not help
herself. But there was a way out! The idea flashed suddenly to her
mind. The river!</p>

<p>She must not permit herself to dwell too long upon the
idea&mdash;upon the cold, dark waters, upon the crocodiles, lest
her strength fail her. She must act instantly, without thought. She
leaped to her feet, but Bobolo was too close. Upon the instant he
guessed her intention and seized her, throwing her roughly to the
bottom of the canoe. He was very angry and struck her heavily
across the face; then he bound her, securing her wrists and her
ankles.</p>

<p>"You will not try that again," he growled at her.</p>

<p>"I shall find some other way then," she replied defiantly. "You
shall not have me. It will be better for you to accept my offer, as
otherwise you shall have neither me nor the pay."</p>

<p>"Be quiet, woman," commanded Bobolo; "I have heard enough," and
he struck her again.</p>

<p>For four hours the canoe sped swiftly onward; the ebon paddlers,
moving in perfect rhythm, seemed tireless. The sun had risen, but
from her prone position in the bottom of the craft the girl saw
nothing but the swaying bodies of the paddlers nearest her, the
degraded face of Bobolo, and the brazen sky above.</p>

<p>At last she heard the sound of voices shouting from the shore.
There were answering shouts from the crew of the canoe, and a
moment later she felt its prow touch the bank. Then Bobolo removed
the bonds from her wrists and ankles and helped her to her feet.
Before her, on the river bank, were hundreds of savages: men,
women, and children. Beyond them was a village of grass-thatched,
beehive huts, surrounded by a palisade of poles bound together with
lianas.</p>

<p>When the eyes of the villagers alighted upon the white prisoner
there was a volley of shouts and questions; and as she stepped
ashore she was surrounded by a score of curious savages, among whom
the women were the most unfriendly. She was struck and spat upon by
them; and more serious harm would have been done her had not Bobolo
stalked among them, striking right and left with the shaft of his
spear.</p>

<p>Trailed by half the village, she was led into the compound to
the hut of the chief, a much larger structure than any of the
others, flanked by several two-room huts, all of which were
enclosed by a low palisade. Here dwelt the chief and his harem with
their slaves. At the entrance to the chief's compound the rabble
halted, and Kali Bwana and Bobolo entered alone. Instantly the girl
was surrounded again by angry women, the wives of Bobolo. There
were fully a dozen of them; and they ranged in age from a child of
fourteen to an ancient, toothless hag, who, despite the infirmities
of age, appeared to dominate the others.</p>

<p>Again Bobolo had recourse to his spear to save his captive from
serious harm. He belabored the most persistent of them unmercifully
until they fell back out of reach of his weapon, and then he turned
to the old woman.</p>

<p>"Ubooga," he said, addressing her, "this is my new wife. I place
her in your care. See that no harm comes to her. Give her two
women-slaves. I shall send men-slaves to build a hut for her close
to mine."</p>

<p>"You are a fool," cried Ubooga. "'She is white. The women will
not let her live in peace, if they let her live at all, nor will
they let you live in peace until she is dead or you get rid of her.
You were a fool to bring her, but then you were always a fool."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, old woman!" cried Bobolo. "I am chief. If the
women molest her I will kill them&mdash;and you, too," he
added.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will kill the others," screamed the old hag, "but
you will not kill me. I will scratch out your eyes and eat your
heart. You are the son of a pig. Your mother was a jackal. You, a
chief! You would have been the slave of a slave had it not been for
me. Who are you! Your own mother did not know who your father was.
You&mdash;" But Bobolo had fled.</p>

<p>With her hands on her hips the old termagant turned toward Kali
Bwana and surveyed her, appraising her from head to feet. She noted
the fine leopard skin garment and the wealth of bracelets and
anklets. "Come, you!" she screamed and seized the girl by the
hair.</p>

<p>It was the last straw. Far better to die now than to prolong the
agony through brutal abuse and bitter insult. Kali Bwana swung a
blow to the side of Ubooga's head that sent her reeling. The other
women broke into loud laughter. The girl expected that the old
woman would fall upon her and kill her, but she did nothing of the
kind. Instead she stood looking at her; her lower jaw dropped, her
eyes wide in astonishment. For a moment she stood thus, and then
she appeared to notice the laughter and taunts of the other women
for the first time. With a maniacal scream she seized a stick and
charged them. They scattered like frightened rabbits seeking their
burrows, but not before the stick had fallen heavily upon a couple
of them as Ubooga, screaming curses, threatened them with the anger
of Bobolo.</p>

<p>When she returned to the white girl she merely nodded her head
in the direction of one of the huts and said "Come" again, but this
time in a less peremptory tone; in other ways, too, her attitude
seemed changed and far less unfriendly, or perhaps it would be
better to say less threatening. That the terrible old woman could
be friendly to any one seemed wholly beyond the range of
possibility.</p>

<p>Having installed the girl in her own hut, under the protection
of two women slaves, Ubooga hobbled to the main entrance of the
chief's compound, possibly in the hope of catching a glimpse of
Bobolo, concerning whom she had left a number of things unsaid; but
Bobolo was nowhere to be seen. There was, however, a warrior who
had returned with the chief from up river squatting before a nearby
hut while his wife prepared food for him.</p>

<p>Ubooga, being a privileged character and thus permitted to leave
the sacred precincts of the harem, crossed over and squatted down
near the warrior.</p>

<p>"Who is the white girl?" demanded the old woman.</p>

<p>The warrior was a very stupid fellow, and the fact that he had
recently been very drunk and had had no sleep for two nights lent
him no greater acumen. Furthermore, he was terribly afraid of
Ubooga, as who was not? He looked up dully out of red-rimmed,
bloodshot eyes.</p>

<p>"She is the new white priestess of the Leopard God," he
said.</p>

<p>"Where did Bobolo get her?" persisted Ubooga.</p>

<p>"We had come from the battle at Gato Mgungu's village, where we
were defeated, and were on our way with Gato Mgungu back to the
temp&mdash;" He stopped suddenly. "I don't know where Bobolo got
her," he ended sullenly.</p>

<p>A wicked, toothless grin wrinkled Ubooga's unlovely features. "I
thought so," she cackled enigmatically and, rising, hobbled back to
the chief's compound.</p>

<p>The wife of the warrior looked at him with disgust. "So you are
a Leopard Man!" she whispered accusingly.</p>

<p>"It is a lie," he cried; "I said nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"You did," contradicted his wife, "and you told Ubooga that
Bobolo is a Leopard Man. This will not be well for Bobolo or for
you."</p>

<p>"Women who talk too much sometimes have their tongues cut out,"
he reminded her.</p>

<p>"It is you who have talked too much," she retorted. "I have said
nothing. I shall say nothing. Do you think that I want the village
to know that my man is a Leopard Man?" There was deep disgust in
her tone.</p>

<p>The order of Leopard Men is a secret order. There are few
villages and no entire tribes composed wholly of Leopard Men, who
are looked upon with disgust and horror by all who are not members
of the feared order. Their rites and practices are viewed with
contempt by even the most degraded of tribes, and to be proved a
Leopard Man is equivalent to the passing of a sentence of exile or
death in practically any community.</p>

<p>Ubooga nursed the knowledge she had gained, metaphorically
cuddling it to her breast. Squatting down before her hut, she
mumbled to herself; and the other women of the harem who saw her
were frightened, for they saw that Ubooga smiled, and when Ubooga
smiled they knew that something unpleasant was going to happen to
someone. When Bobolo entered the compound they saw that she smiled
more broadly, and they were relieved, knowing that it was Bobolo
and not they who was to be the victim.</p>

<p>"Where is the white girl?" demanded Bobolo as he halted before
Ubooga. "Has any harm befallen her?"</p>

<p>"Your priestess is quite safe, Leopard Man," hissed Ubooga, but
in a voice so low that only Bobolo might hear.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you old she-devil?" Bobolo's face turned a
livid blue from rage.</p>

<p>"For a long time I have suspected it," cackled Ubooga. "Now I
know it."</p>

<p>Bobolo seized his knife and grasped the woman by the hair,
dragging her across one knee. "You said I did not dare to kill
you," he growled.</p>

<p>"Nor do you. Listen. I have told another, who will say nothing
unless I command it, or unless I die. If I die the whole village
will know it, and you will be torn to pieces. Now kill me, if you
dare!"</p>

<p>Bobolo let her fall to the ground. He did not know that Ubooga
had lied to him, that she had told no one. He may have surmised as
much; but he dared not take the chance, for he knew that Ubooga was
right. His people would tear him to pieces should they discover he
was a Leopard Man, nor would the other culprits in the tribe dare
come to his defense. To divert suspicion from themselves they would
join his executioners. Bobolo was very much worried.</p>

<p>"Who told you?" he demanded. "It is a lie, whoever told
you."</p>

<p>"The girl is high priestess of the Leopard God," taunted Ubooga.
"After you left the village of Gato Mgungu, following the fight in
which you were defeated, you returned to the temple with Gato
Mgungu who all men know is the chief of the Leopard Men. There you
got the girl."</p>

<p>"It is a lie. I stole her from the Leopard Men. I am no Leopard
Man."</p>

<p>"Then return her to the Leopard Men, and I will say nothing
about the matter. I will tell no one that you are such a good
friend of Gato Mgungu that you fight with him against his enemies,
for then everyone will know that you must be a Leopard Man."</p>

<p>"It is a lie," repeated Bobolo, who could think of nothing else
to say.</p>

<p>"Lie or no lie, will you get rid of her?"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Bobolo; "in a few days."</p>

<p>"Today," demanded Ubooga. "Today, or I will kill her
tonight."</p>

<p>"Today," assented Bobolo. He turned away.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To get someone to take her back where the Leopard Men can find
her."</p>

<p>"Why don't you kill her?"</p>

<p>"The Leopard Men would kill me if I did. They would kill many of
my people. First of all they would kill my women if I killed
theirs."</p>

<p>"Go and get someone to take her away," said Ubooga, "but see
that there is no trickery, you son of a wart hog, you pig,
you<sup><b>____</b></sup>"</p>

<p>Bobolo heard no more. He had fled into the village. He was very
angry, but he was more afraid. He knew that what Ubooga had said
was true; but, on the other hand, his passion still ran high for
the white girl. He must try to find some means to preserve her for
himself; in case he failed, however, there were other uses to which
she could be put. Such were the thoughts which occupied his mind as
he walked the length of the village street toward the hut of his
old crony Kapopa, the witch-doctor, upon more than one occasion a
valuable ally.</p>

<p>He found the old man engaged with a customer who desired a charm
that would kill the mother of one of his wives, for which Kapopa
had demanded three goats&mdash;in advance. There was considerable
haggling, the customer insisting that his mother-in- law was not
worth one goat, alive, which, he argued, would reduce her value
when dead to not more than a single chicken; but Kapopa was
obdurate, and finally the man departed to give the matter further
thought.</p>

<p>Bobolo plunged immediately into the matter that had brought him
to the witch-doctor. "Kapopa knows," he commenced, "that when I
returned from up the river I brought a white wife with me."</p>

<p>Kapopa nodded. "Who in the village does not?"</p>

<p>"Already she has brought me much trouble," continued Bobolo.</p>

<p>"And you wish to be rid of her."</p>

<p>"I do not. It is Ubooga who wishes to rid me of her."</p>

<p>"You wish a charm to kill Ubooga?"</p>

<p>"I have already paid you for three such charms," Bobolo reminded
him, "and Ubooga still lives. I do not wish another. Your medicine
is not so strong as Ubooga."</p>

<p>"What do you wish?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you. Because the white girl is a priestess of the
Leopard God, Ubooga says that I must be a Leopard Man, but that is
a lie. I stole her from the Leopard Men. Everyone knows that I am
not a Leopard Man."</p>

<p>"Of course," assented Kapopa.</p>

<p>"But Ubooga says that she will tell everyone that I am a Leopard
Man if I do not kill the girl or send her away. What can I do?"</p>

<p>Kapopa sat in silence for a moment; then he rummaged in a bag
that lay beside him. Bobolo fidgeted. He knew that when Kapopa
rummaged in that bag it was always expensive. Finally the witch-
doctor drew forth a little bundle wrapped in dirty cloth. Very
carefully he untied the strings and spread the cloth upon the
ground, revealing its contents, a few short twigs and a figurine
carved from bone. Kapopa set the figurine in an upright position
facing him, shook the twigs between his two palms, and cast them
before the idol. He examined the position of the twigs carefully,
scratched his head for a moment, then gathered them up, cast them
again. Once more he studied the situation in silence. Presently he
looked up.</p>

<p>"I now have a plan," he announced.</p>

<p>"How much will it cost?" demanded Bobolo. "Tell me that
first."</p>

<p>"You have a daughter," said Kapopa.</p>

<p>"I have many of them," rejoined Bobolo.</p>

<p>"I do not want them all."</p>

<p>"You may have your choice if you will tell me how I may keep the
white girl without Ubooga knowing it."</p>

<p>"It can be done," announced Kapopa. "In the village of the
little men there is no witch-doctor. For a long time they have been
coming to Kapopa for their medicine. They will do whatever Kapopa
asks."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Bobolo.</p>

<p>"The village of the little men is not far from the village of
Bobolo. We shall take the white girl there. For a small payment of
meal and a few fish at times they will keep her there for Bobolo
until Ubooga dies. Some day she must die. Already she has lived far
too long. In the meantime Bobolo can visit his wife in the village
of the little men."</p>

<p>"You can arrange this with the little men?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I shall go with you and the white girl, and I will arrange
everything."</p>

<p>"Good," exclaimed Bobolo. "We will start now; when we return you
may go to the harem of Bobolo and select any of his daughters that
you choose."</p>

<p>Kapopa wrapped up the twigs and the idol and replaced them in
his pouch; then he got his spear and shield. "Fetch the white
girl," he said.</p>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14">XIV. &mdash; THE RETURN OF
SOBITO</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE wavering light of the smoky torches
illuminated the interior of the temple of the Leopard God,
revealing the barbaric, savage drama being enacted there; but
outside it was very dark, so dark that the figure of a man moving
swiftly along the river bank might scarcely have been seen at a
distance of fifty feet. He stepped quickly and silently among the
canoes of the Leopard Men, pushing them out into the current of the
stream. When all had been turned adrift save one, he dragged that
up the river and partially beached it opposite the rear of the
temple; then he ran toward the building, scaled one of the piles to
the verandah, and a moment later paused upon the tiebeam just
beneath the overhanging roof at the front of the building, where,
through an opening, he could look down upon the tragic scene
within.</p>

<p>He had been there a few moments before, just long enough to see
and realize the precarious position of the white prisoner.
Instantly his plan had been formed, and he had dropped swiftly to
the river bank to put a part of it into immediate execution. Now
that he was back he realized that a few seconds later he would have
been too late. A sudden silence had fallen upon the chamber below.
The priestesses of the Leopard God were sneaking stealthily toward
their prostrate victim. No longer did the lesser priests make the
purely histrionic pretense of protection. The end had come.</p>

<p>Through the aperture and into the interior of the temple swung
Tarzan of the Apes. From tiebeam to tiebeam he leaped, silent as
the smoke rising from the torches below. He saw that the
priestesses were almost upon the white prisoner, that, swift as he
was, he might not be able to reach the man's side in time. It was a
bold, mad scheme that had formed in the active brain of the
ape-man, and one that depended for success largely upon its
boldness. Now it seemed that it was foredoomed to failure even
before it could be put into execution.</p>

<p>The sudden silence, following the din of drums and yells and
dancing feet, startled the tense nerves of the pinioned prisoner.
He turned his eyes from side to side and saw the priestesses
creeping toward him. Something told him that the final, hideous
horror was upon him now. He steeled himself to meet the agony of
it, lest his tormentors should have the added gratification of
witnessing the visible effects of his suffering. Something
inherent, something racial rebelled at the thought of showing fear
or agony before these creatures of an inferior race.</p>

<p>The priestesses were almost upon him when a voice high above
them broke the deathly silence. "Sobito! Sobito! Sobito!" it boomed
in hollow accents from the rafters of the temple. "I am the
<i>muzimo</i> of Orando, the friend of Nyamwegi. I have come for
you. With The Spirit of Nyamwegi, I have come for you!"</p>

<p>Simultaneously a giant white man, naked but for a loin cloth,
ran down one of the temple pillars like an agile monkey and leaped
to the lower dais. The startling interruption momentarily paralyzed
the blacks, partially from astonishment and partially from fear.
Sobito was speechless. His knees trembled beneath him; then,
recovering himself, he fled screaming from the dais to the
protection of the concourse of warriors on the temple floor.</p>

<p>Old Timer, no less astonished than the Negroes, looked with
amazement upon the scene. He expected to see the strange white man
pursue Sobito, but he did nothing of the sort. Instead, he turned
directly toward the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Be ready to follow me," commanded the stranger. "I shall go out
through the rear of the temple." He spoke in low tones and in
English; then, as swiftly, he changed to the dialect of the
district. "Capture Sobito and bring him to me," he shouted to the
warriors below the dais. "Until you fetch him I shall hold this
white man as hostage."</p>

<p>Before there could be either reply or opposition, he leaped to
the side of Old Timer, hurled the terrified priests from him, and
seizing him by the hand jerked him to his feet. He spoke no further
word but turned and ran swiftly across the lower dais, leaped to
the higher one where Imigeg shrank aside as they passed, and
disappeared from the sight of the Leopard Men through the doorway
at its rear. There he paused for a moment and stopped Old
Timer.</p>

<p>"Where is the white girl?" he demanded. "We must take her with
us."</p>

<p>"She is not here," replied old Timer; "a chief stole her and, I
imagine, took her down river to his village."</p>

<p>"This way, then," directed Tarzan, darting into a doorway on
their left.</p>

<p>A moment later they were on the verandah, from which they gained
the ground by way of one of the piles that supported the building;
then the ape-man ran quickly toward the river, followed closely by
Old Timer. At the edge of the river Tarzan stopped beside a
canoe.</p>

<p>"Get into this," he directed; "it is the only one left here.
They cannot follow you. When you reach the main river you will have
such a start that they cannot overtake you."</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming with me?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied and started to shove the craft out into the
stream. "Do you know the name of the chief who stole the girl?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"It was Bobolo."</p>

<p>Tarzan pushed the canoe away from the bank.</p>

<p>"I can't thank you, old man," said Old Timer; "there just aren't
the right words in the English language."</p>

<p>The silent figure on the river bank made no reply, and a moment
later, as the current caught the canoe, it was swallowed up in the
darkness. Then Old Timer seized a paddle and sought to accelerate
the speed of the craft, that he might escape as quickly as possible
from this silent river of mystery and death.</p>

<p>The canoe had scarcely disappeared in the darkness when Tarzan
of the Apes turned back toward the temple. Once again he scaled a
pile to the verandah and reentered the rear of the building. He
heard screaming and scuffling in the fore part of the temple, and a
grim smile touched his lips as he recognized the origin of the
sounds. Advancing quickly to the doorway that opened upon the upper
dais he saw several warriors dragging the kicking, screaming Sobito
toward him; then he stepped out upon the dais beside the Leopard
God. Instantly all eyes were upon him, and fear was in every eye.
The boldness of his entrance into their holy of holies, his
effrontery, the ease with which he had taken their prisoner from
them had impressed them, while the fact that Sobito, a
witch-doctor, had fled from him in terror had assured them of his
supernatural origin.</p>

<p>"Bind his hands and feet," commanded Tarzan, "and deliver him to
me. The Spirit of Nyamwegi watches, waiting whom he shall kill; so
delay not."</p>

<p>Hastily the warriors dragging Sobito secured his wrists and
ankles; then they lifted him to their shoulders and carried him
through the doorway at the side of the dais to the rear chambers of
the temple. Here Tarzan met them.</p>

<p>"Leave Sobito with me," he directed.</p>

<p>"Where is the white prisoner you seized as hostage?" demanded
one more courageous than his fellows.</p>

<p>"Search for him in the last room at the far end of the temple,"
said the ape-man; but he did not say that they would find him
there. Then he lifted Sobito to his shoulder and stepped into the
room through which he had led Old Timer to freedom, and as the
warriors groped through the darkness in search of their victim the
ape-man carried Sobito, screaming from fright, out into the
forest.</p>

<p>For a long time the silent, terrified listeners in the temple of
the Leopard God heard the eerie wails of the witch-doctor of Tumbai
growing fainter in the distance; then the warriors returned from
their search of the temple to report that the prisoner was not
there.</p>

<p>"We have been tricked!" cried Imigeg. "The <i>muzimo</i> of
Orando, the Utenga, has stolen our prisoner."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he escaped while the <i>muzimo</i> was taking Sobito,"
suggested Gato Mgungu.</p>

<p>"Search the island," cried another chief.</p>

<p>"The canoes!" exclaimed a third.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a rush for the river, and then the Leopard
Men realized the enormity of the disaster that had befallen them,
for not a canoe was left of all those that had brought them to the
temple. Their situation was worse than it might appear at first
glance. Their village had been burned and those of their fellows
who had not accompanied them to the temple were either dead or
scattered; there was no path through the tangled mazes of the
jungle; but worse still was the fact that religious superstition
forbade them from entering the dismal stretch of forest that
extended from the island to the nearest trail that they might
utilize. The swamps about them and the river below them were
infested with crocodiles. The supply of food at the temple was not
sufficient to support them for more than a few days. They were
cannibals, and the weaker among them were the first to appreciate
the significance of that fact.</p>

<p>The warriors of Orando squatted about their fires in their camp
beside the manioc field of Gato Mgungu. Their bellies were full,
and they were happy. Tomorrow they would start upon the return
march to their own country. Already they were anticipating the
reception that awaited victorious warriors. Again and again each,
when he could make himself heard, recounted his own heroic
exploits, none of which lost dramatic value in the retelling. A
statistician overhearing them might have computed the enemy dead at
fully two thousand.</p>

<p>Their reminiscences were interrupted by the appearance of a
giant figure among them. It appeared to have materialized from thin
air. It had not been there one moment; the next it had. It was he
whom they had known as Muzimo; it was Tarzan of the Apes. Upon his
shoulder he bore the bound figure of a man.</p>

<p>"Tarzan of the Apes!" cried some.</p>

<p>"Muzimo!" cried others.</p>

<p>"What have you brought us?" demanded Orando.</p>

<p>Tarzan threw the bound figure to the ground. "I have brought
back your witch-doctor," he replied. "I have brought back Sobito,
who is also a priest of the Leopard God."</p>

<p>"It is a lie!" screamed Sobito.</p>

<p>"See the leopard skin upon him," exclaimed a warrior.</p>

<p>"And the curved claws of the Leopard Men!" cried another.</p>

<p>"No, Sobito is not a Leopard Man!" jeered a third.</p>

<p>"I found him in the temple of the Leopard Men," explained
Tarzan. "I thought you would like to have your witch-doctor back to
make strong medicine for you that would preserve you from the
Leopard Men."</p>

<p>"Kill him!" screamed a warrior.</p>

<p>"Kill Sobito! Kill Sobito!" was taken up by four score
throats.</p>

<p>Angry men advanced upon the witch-doctor.</p>

<p>"Wait!" commanded Orando. "It will be better to take Sobito back
to Tumbai, for there are many there who would like to see him die.
It will give him time to think about the bad things he has done; it
will make him suffer longer, as he has made others suffer; and I am
sure that the parents of Nyamwegi would like to see Sobito
die."</p>

<p>"Kill me now," begged Sobito. "I do not wish to go back to
Tumbai."</p>

<p>"Tarzan of the Apes captured him," suggested a warrior. "Let him
tell us what to do with Sobito."</p>

<p>"Do as you please with him," replied the apeman; "he is not my
witch-doctor. I have other business to attend to. I go now.
Remember Tarzan of the Apes, if you do not see him again, and
because of him treat white men kindly, for Tarzan is your friend
and you are his."</p>

<p>As silently as he had come, he disappeared; and with him went
little Nkima, whom the warriors of the Watenga country knew as The
Spirit of Nyamwegi.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15">XV. &mdash; THE LITTLE MEN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BOBOLO and Kapopa dragged Kali Bwana along the
narrow forest trails away from the great river that was life artery
of the district, back into the dense, dismal depth of the jungle,
where great beasts prowled and the little men lived. Here there
were no clearings nor open fields; they passed no villages.</p>

<p>The trails were narrow and little used and in places very low,
for the little men do not have to clear their trails to the same
height that others must.</p>

<p>Kapopa went ahead, for he knew the little men better than Bobolo
knew them; though both knew their methods, knew how they hid in the
underbrush and speared unwary passersby or sped poisoned arrows
from the trees above. They would recognize Kapopa and not molest
them. Behind Kapopa came Kali Bwana. There was a fiber rope around
her fair neck. Behind her was Bobolo, holding the rope's end.</p>

<p>The girl was in total ignorance of their destination or of what
fate awaited her there. She moved in a dumb lethargy of despair.
She was without hope, and her only regret was that she was also
without the means of ending her tragic sufferings. She saw the
knife at the hip of Kapopa as he walked ahead of her and coveted
it. She thought of the dark river and the crocodiles and regretted
them. In all respects her situation appeared to her worse than it
had ever been before. Perhaps it was the depressing influence of
the somber forest or the mystery of the unknown into which she was
being led like some dumb beast to the slaughter. Slaughter! The
word fascinated her. She knew that Bobolo was a cannibal. Perhaps
they were taking her somewhere into the depths of the grim wood to
slaughter and devour her. She wondered why the idea no longer
revolted her, and then she guessed the truth&mdash;it postulated
death. Death! Above all things now she craved death.</p>

<p>How long they plodded that seemingly endless trail she did not
know, but after an eternity of dull misery a voice hailed them.
Kapopa halted.</p>

<p>"What do you want in the country of Rebega?" demanded the
voice.</p>

<p>"I am Kapopa, the witch-doctor," replied Kapopa. "With me are
Bobolo, the chief, and his wife. We come to visit Rebega."</p>

<p>"I know you, Kapopa," replied the voice, and a second later a
diminutive warrior stepped into the trail ahead of them from the
underbrush at its side. He was about four feet tall and stark naked
except for a necklace and some anklets and arm bands of copper and
iron.</p>

<p>His eyes were small and close set, giving his unpleasant
countenance a crafty appearance. His expression denoted surprise
and curiosity as he regarded the white girl, but he asked no
questions. Motioning them to follow him, he continued along the
crooked trail. Almost immediately two other warriors, apparently
materializing from thin air, fell in behind them; and thus they
were escorted to the village of Rebega, the chief.</p>

<p>It was a squalid village of low huts, bisected ovals with a door
two or three feet in height at each end. The huts were arranged
about the periphery of an ellipse, in the center of which was the
chief's hut. Surrounding the village was a crude boma of pointed
sticks and felled timber with an opening at either end to give
ingress and egress.</p>

<p>Rebega was an old, wrinkled man. He squatted on his haunches
just outside one of the entrances to his hut, surrounded by his
women and children. As the visitors approached him he gave no sign
of recognition, his small, beady eyes regarding them with apparent
suspicion and malice. His was indeed a most repellent visage.</p>

<p>Kapopa and Bobolo greeted him, but he only nodded once and
grunted. To the girl his whole attitude appeared antagonistic, and
when she saw the little warriors closing in about them from every
hut she believed that Kapopa and Bobolo had placed themselves in a
trap from which they might have difficulty in escaping. The thought
rather pleased her. What the result would be for her was
immaterial; nothing could be worse than the fate that Bobolo had
intended for her. She had never seen pygmies before; and,
notwithstanding her mental perturbation, her normally active mind
found interest in observing them. The women were smaller than the
men, few of them being over three feet in height; while the
children seemed incredibly tiny. Among them all, however, there was
not a prepossessing countenance nor a stitch of clothing, and they
were obviously filthy and degraded.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence as they halted before Rebega, and
then Kapopa addressed him. "You know us, Rebega&mdash;Kapopa, the
witch-doctor, and Bobolo, the chief!"</p>

<p>Rebega nodded. "What do you want here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"We are friends of Rebega," continued Kapopa,
ingratiatingly.</p>

<p>"Your hands are empty," observed the pygmy; "I see no presents
for Rebega."</p>

<p>"You shall have presents if you will do what we ask," promised
Bobolo.</p>

<p>"What do you want Rebega to do?"</p>

<p>"Bobolo has brought his white wife to you," explained Kapopa.
"Keep her here in your village for him in safety; let no one see
her; let no one know that she is here."</p>

<p>"What are the presents?"</p>

<p>"Meal, plantain, fish; every moon enough for a feast for all in
your village," replied Bobolo.</p>

<p>"It is not enough," grunted Rebega. "We do not want a white
woman in our village. Our own women make us enough trouble."</p>

<p>Kapopa stepped close to the chief and whispered rapidly into his
ear. The sullen expression on Rebega's countenance deepened, but he
appeared suddenly nervous and fearful. Perhaps Kapopa, the
witch-doctor, had threatened him with the malign attentions of
ghosts and demons if he did not accede to their request. At last he
capitulated.</p>

<p>"Send the food at once," he said. "Even now we have not enough
for ourselves, and this woman will need as much food as two of
us."</p>

<p>"It shall be sent tomorrow," promised Bobolo. "I shall come with
it myself and remain over night. Now I must return to my village.
It is getting late, and it is not well to be out after night has
fallen. The Leopard Men are everywhere."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Rebega, "the Leopard Men are everywhere. I shall
keep your white woman for you if you bring food. If you do not I
shall send her back to your village."</p>

<p>"Do not do that!" exclaimed Bobolo. "The food shall be sent
you."</p>

<p>It was with a feeling of relief that Kali Bwana saw Bobolo and
Kapopa depart. During the interview with Rebega no one had once
addressed her, just as no one would have addressed a cow he was
arranging to stable. She recalled the plaints of American Negroes
that they were not treated with equality by the whites. Now that
conditions were reversed, she could not see that the Negroes were
more magnanimous than the whites. Evidently it all depended upon
which was the more powerful and had nothing whatsoever to do with
innate gentleness of spirit or charity.</p>

<p>When Bobolo and Kapopa had disappeared in the forest, Rebega
called to a woman who had been among the interested spectators
during the brief interview between him and his visitors. "Take the
white woman to your hut," he commanded. "See that no harm befalls
her. Let no stranger see her. I have spoken."</p>

<p>"What shall I feed her?" demanded the woman. "My man was killed
by a buffalo while hunting, and I have not enough food for
myself."</p>

<p>"Let her go hungry, then, until Bobolo brings the food he has
promised. Take her away."</p>

<p>The woman seized Kali Bwana by the wrist and led her toward a
miserable hut at the far end of the village. It seemed to the girl
to be the meanest hut of all the squalid village. Filth and refuse
were piled and strewn about the doorway through which she was
conducted into its gloomy, windowless interior.</p>

<p>A number of other women had followed her guardian, and now all
these crowded into the hut after them. They jabbered excitedly and
pawed her roughly in their efforts to examine and finger her
garments and her ornaments. She could understand a little of their
language, for she had been long enough now with the natives to have
picked up many words, and the pygmies of this district used a
dialect similar to that spoken in the villages of Gato Mgungu and
Bobolo. One of them, feeling of her body, remarked that she was
tender and that her flesh should be good to eat, at which they all
laughed, exposing their sharp-filed, yellow teeth.</p>

<p>"If Bobolo does not bring food for her, she will be too thin,"
observed Wlala, the woman who was her guardian.</p>

<p>"If he does not bring food, we should eat her before she becomes
too thin," advised another. "Our men hunt, but they bring little
meat. They say the game has gone away. We must have meat."</p>

<p>They remained in the small, ill-smelling hut until it was time
to go and prepare the evening meal for their men. The girl,
exhausted by physical exertion and nervous strain, sickened by the
close air and the stench of the hut's interior, had lain down in an
effort to secure the peace of oblivion in sleep; but they had
prodded her with sticks, and some of them had struck her in mere
wanton cruelty. When they had gone she lay down again, but
immediately Wlala struck her a sharp blow.</p>

<p>"You cannot sleep while I work, white woman," she cried. "Get to
work!" She pressed a stone pestle into the girl's hand and
indicated a large stone at one side of the hut. In a hollow worn in
the stone was some corn. Kali Bwana could not understand all that
the woman said, but enough to know that she was to grind the corn.
Wearily she commenced the work, while Wlala, just outside the hut,
built her cooking fire and prepared her supper. When it was ready
the woman gobbled it hungrily, offering none to the girl. Then she
came back into the hut.</p>

<p>"I am hungry," said Kali Bwana. "Will you not give me food?"</p>

<p>Wlala flew into a frenzy of rage. "Give you food!" she screamed.
"I have not enough food for myself. You are the wife of Bobolo; let
him bring you food."</p>

<p>"I am not his wife," replied the girl. "I am his prisoner. When
my friends discover how you have treated me, you will all be
punished."</p>

<p>Wlala laughed. "Your friends will never know," she taunted. "No
one comes to the country of the Betetes. In my life I have seen
only two other white-skinned people; those two we ate. No one came
and punished us. No one will punish us after we have eaten you. Why
did Bobolo not keep you in his own village? Were his women angry?
Did they drive you out?"</p>

<p>"I guess so," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"Then he will never take you back. It is a long way from the
village of Bobolo to the village of Rebega. Bobolo will soon tire
of coming so far to see you while he has plenty of wives in his own
village; then he will give you to us." Wlala licked her thick
lips.</p>

<p>The girl sat dejectedly before the stone mortar. She was very
tired. Her hands had dropped to her sides. "Get to work, you lazy
sow!" cried Wlala and struck her across the head with the stick she
kept ever ready at hand. Wearily, Kali Bwana resumed her monotonous
chore. "And see that you grind it fine," added Wlala; then she went
out to gossip with the other women of the village.</p>

<p>As soon as she was gone the girl stopped working. She was so
tired that she could scarcely raise the stone pestle, and she was
very hungry. Glancing fearfully through the doorway of the hut, she
saw that no one was near enough to see her, and then, quickly, she
gathered a handful of the raw meal and ate it. She dared not eat
too much, lest Wlala discover the theft; but even that little was
better than nothing. Then she added some fresh corn to the meal in
the mortar and ground that to the same consistency as the
other.</p>

<p>When Wlala returned to the hut, the girl was fast asleep beside
the mortar. The woman kicked her into wakefulness; but as by now it
was too dark to work and the woman herself lay down to sleep, Kali
Bwana was at last permitted undisturbed slumber.</p>

<p>Bobolo did not return the following day, nor the second day, nor
the third; neither did he send food. The pygmies were very angry.
They had been anticipating a feast. Perhaps Wlala was the angriest,
for she was the hungriest; also, she had commenced to suspect the
theft of her meal. Not being positive, but to be on the safe side,
she had beaten Kali Bwana unmercifully while she accused her of it.
At least she started to beat her; then suddenly something quite
unexpected had happened. The white girl, leaping to her feet, had
seized the pygmy, torn the stick from her hand, and struck her
repeatedly with it before Wlala could run from the hut. After that
Wlala did not again strike Kali Bwana. In fact, she treated her
with something approximating respect, but her voice was raised
loudly in the village against the hated alien and against
Bobolo.</p>

<p>In front of Rebega's hut was a concourse of women and warriors.
They were all angry and hungry. "Bobolo has not brought the food,"
cried one, repeating for the hundredth time what had been said by
each.</p>

<p>"What do we want of meal, or plantain, or fish when we have
flesh here for all?" The speaker jerked a thumb meaningly in the
direction of Wlala's hut.</p>

<p>"Bobolo would bring warriors and kill us if we harmed his white
wife," cautioned another.</p>

<p>"Kapopa would cast a spell upon us, and many of us would
die."</p>

<p>"He said he would come back with food the next day."</p>

<p>"Now it has been three days, and he has not returned."</p>

<p>"The flesh of the white girl is good now," argued Wlala. "She
has been eating my meal, but I have stopped that. I have taken the
meal from the hut and hidden it. If she does not have food soon,
her flesh will not be so good as now. Let us eat her."</p>

<p>"I am afraid of Kapopa and Bobolo," admitted Rebega.</p>

<p>"We do not have to tell them that we ate her," urged Wlala.</p>

<p>"They will guess it," insisted Rebega.</p>

<p>"We can tell them that the Leopard Men came and took her away,"
suggested a rat-faced little fighting man; "and if they do not
believe us we can go away. The hunting is not good here, anyway. We
should go elsewhere and hunt."</p>

<p>For a long time Rebega's fears outweighed his natural
inclination for human flesh, but at last he told them that if the
food Bobolo had promised did not arrive before dark they would have
a dance and a feast that night.</p>

<p>In the hut of Wlala, Kali Bwana heard the loud shouts of
approval that greeted Rebega's announcement and thought that the
food Bobolo had promised had arrived. She hoped that they would
give her some of it, for she was weak from hunger. When Wlala came
she asked her if the food had arrived.</p>

<p>"Bobolo has sent no food, but we shall eat tonight," replied the
woman, grinning. "We shall eat all that we wish; but it will not be
meal, nor plantain, nor fish." She came over to the girl then and
felt of her body, pinching the flesh slightly between her fingers.
"Yes, we shall eat," she concluded.</p>

<p>To Kali Bwana the inference was obvious, but the strange
chemistry of emotion had fortunately robbed her of the power to
feel repugnance for the idea that would have so horribly revolted
her a few short weeks ago. She did not think of the grisly
aftermath; she thought only of death, and welcomed it.</p>

<p>The food from Bobolo did not come, and that night the Betetes
gathered in the compound before Rebega's hut. The women dragged
cooking pots to the scene and built many fires. The men danced a
little; but only for a short time, for they had been too long on
short rations. Their energy was at low ebb.</p>

<p>At last a few of them went to the hut of Wlala and dragged Kali
Bwana to the scene of the festivities. There was some dispute as to
who was to kill her. Rebega was frankly afraid of the wrath of
Kapopa, though he was not so much concerned about Bobolo. Bobolo
could only follow them with warriors whom they could see and kill;
but Kapopa could remain in his village and send demons and ghosts
after them. At last it was decided that the women should kill her;
and Wlala, remembering the blows that the white girl had struck
her, volunteered to do the work herself.</p>

<p>"Tie her hands and feet," she said, "and I will kill her." She
did not care to risk a repetition of the scene in her hut at the
time she had attempted to beat the girl.</p>

<p>Kali Bwana understood, and as the warriors prepared to bind her
she crossed her hands to facilitate their work. They threw her to
the ground and secured her feet; then she closed her eyes and
breathed a prayer. It was for those she had left behind in that
far-away country and for "Jerry."</p>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16">XVI. &mdash; A CLUE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE night that Tarzan had brought Sobito to their
camp the Utengas had celebrated the event in beer salvaged from the
loot of Gato Mgungu's village before they had burned it. They had
celebrated late into the night, stopping only when the last of the
beer had been consumed; then they had slept heavily and well. Even
the sentries had dozed at their posts, for much beer poured into
stomachs already filled with food induces a lethargy difficult to
combat.</p>

<p>And while the Utenga warriors slept, Sobito was not idle. He
pulled and tugged at the bonds that held his wrists, with little
fear that his rather violent efforts would attract attention. At
last he felt them gradually stretching. Sweat poured from his tough
old hide; beads of it stood out upon his wrinkled forehead. He was
panting from the violence of his exertions. Slowly he dragged one
hand farther and farther through the loop; just a hair's breadth at
a time it moved, but eventually it slipped out&mdash;free!</p>

<p>For a moment the old witch-doctor lay still, recouping the
energy that he had expended in his efforts to escape his bonds.
Slowly his eyes ranged the camp. No one stirred. Only the heavy,
stertorous breathing of the half-drunk warriors disturbed the
silence of the night. Sobito drew his feet up within reach of his
hands and untied the knots of the cords that confined them; then
very quietly and slowly he arose and slipped, bent half-doubled,
down toward the river. In a moment the darkness had swallowed him,
and the sleeping camp slept on.</p>

<p>On the shore he found the canoes that the Utengas had captured
from the forces of Gato Mgungu; with considerable difficulty he
pushed one of the smaller of them into the river, after satisfying
himself that there was at least one paddle in it. As he leaped into
it and felt it glide out into the current, he felt like one
snatched from the jaws of death by some unexpected miracle.</p>

<p>His plans were already made. He had had plenty of time while he
was lying working with his bonds to formulate them. He might not
with safety return to the temple of the Leopard God, that he knew
full well; but down the river lay the village of his old friend
Bobolo, who by the theft of the white priestess was doubtless as
much anathema in the eyes of the Leopard Men as he. To Bobolo's
village, therefore, he would go. What he would do afterward was in
the laps of the gods.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Another lone boatman drifted down the broad river
toward the village of Bobolo. It was Old Timer. He, too, had
determined to pay a visit to the citadel of his old friend; but it
would be no friendly visit. In fact, if Old Timer's plans were
successful, Bobolo would not be aware that a visit was being paid
him, lest his hospitality wax so mightily that the guest might
never be permitted to depart. It was the white girl, not Bobolo,
who lured Old Timer to this rash venture. Something within him more
powerful than reason told him that he must save her, and he knew
that if any succor was to avail it must come to her at once. As to
how he was to accomplish it he had not the most remote conception;
all that must depend upon his reconnaissance and his
resourcefulness.</p>

<p>As he drifted downward, paddling gently, his mind was filled
with visions of the girl. He saw her as he had first seen her in
her camp: her blood-smeared clothing, the dirt and perspiration,
but, over all, the radiance of her fair face, the haunting allure
of her blond hair, dishevelled and falling in wavy ringlets across
her forehead and about her ears. He saw her as he had seen her in
the temple of the Leopard God, garbed in savage, barbaric splendor,
more beautiful than ever. It thrilled him to live again the moments
during which he had talked to her, touched her.</p>

<p>Forgotten was the girl whose callous selfishness had made him a
wanderer and an outcast. The picture of her that he had carried
constantly upon the screen of memory for two long years had faded.
When he thought of her now he laughed; and instead of cursing her,
as he had so often done before, he blessed her for having sent him
here to meet and know this glorious creature who now filled his
dreams.</p>

<p>Old Timer was familiar with this stretch of the river. He knew
the exact location of Bobolo's village, and he knew that day would
break before he came within sight of it. To come boldly to it would
be suicidal; now that Bobolo was aware that the white man knew of
his connection with the Leopard Men, his life would not be safe if
he fell into the hands of the crafty old chief.</p>

<p>For a short time after the sun rose he drifted on down stream,
keeping close to the left bank; and shortly before he reached the
village, he turned the prow of his craft in to shore. He did not
know that he would ever need the canoe again but, on the chance
that he might, he secured it to the branch of a tree, and then
clambered up into the leafy shelter of the forest giant.</p>

<p>He planned to make his way through the forest toward the village
in the hope of finding some vantage point from which he might spy
upon it; but he was confident that he would have to wait until
after darkness had fallen before he could venture close, when it
was in his plan to scale the palisade and search the village for
the girl while the natives slept. A mad scheme&mdash;but men have
essayed even madder when spurred on by infatuation for a woman.</p>

<p>As Old Timer was about to leave the tree and start toward the
village of Bobolo, his attention was attracted toward the river by
a canoe which had just come into sight around a bend a short
distance up stream. In it was a single native. Apprehending that
any movement on his part might attract the attention of the lone
paddler and wishing above all things to make his way to the village
unseen, he remained motionless. Closer and closer came the canoe,
but it was not until it was directly opposite him that the white
man recognized its occupant as that priest of the Leopard God whom
his rescuer had demanded should be delivered into his hands.</p>

<p>Yes, it was Sobito; but how had Sobito come here? What was the
meaning of it? Old Timer was confident that the strange white giant
who had rescued him had not demanded Sobito for the purpose of
setting him free. Here was a mystery. Its solution was beyond him,
but he could not see that it materially concerned him in any way;
so he gave it no further thought after Sobito had drifted out of
sight beyond the next turning of the river below.</p>

<p>Moving cautiously through the jungle the white man came at last
within sight of the village of Bobolo. Here he climbed a tree well
off the trail where he could overlook the village without being
observed. He was not surprised that he did not see the girl who he
was confident was there, knowing that she was doubtless a prisoner
in one of the huts of the chief's compound. All that he could do
was wait until darkness had fallen&mdash;wait and hope.</p>

<p>Two days' march on the opposite side of the river lay his own
camp. He had thought of going there first and enlisting the aid of
his partner, but he dared not risk the four days' delay. He
wondered what The Kid was doing; he had not had much time to think
about him of late, but he hoped he had been more successful in his
search for ivory than he had.</p>

<p>The tree in which Old Timer had stationed himself was at the
edge of a clearing. Below him and at a little distance women were
working, hoeing with sharpened sticks. They were chattering like a
band of monkeys. He saw a few warriors set out to inspect their
traps and snares. The scene was peacefully pastoral. He had
recognized most of the warriors and some of the women, for Old
Timer was well acquainted in the village of Bobolo. The villagers
had been friendly, but he knew that he dared no longer approach the
village openly because of his knowledge of Bobolo's connection with
the Leopard Men. Because of that fact and his theft of the white
girl the chief could not afford to let him live; he knew too
much.</p>

<p>He had seen the village many times before, but now it had taken
on a new aspect. Before, it had been only another native village
inhabited by savage blacks; today it was glorified in his eyes by
the presence of a girl. Thus does imagination color our
perceptions. How different would the village of Bobolo have
appeared in the eyes of the watcher had he known the truth, had he
known that the girl he thought so near him was far away in the hut
of Wlala, the Betete pygmy, grinding corn beneath the hate- filled
eyes of a cruel taskmaster, suffering from hunger!</p>

<p>In the village Bobolo was having troubles of his own. Sobito had
come! The chief knew nothing of what had befallen the priest of the
Leopard God. He did not know that he had been discredited in the
eyes of the order; nor did Sobito plan to enlighten him. The wily
old witch-doctor was not sure that he had any plans at all. He
could not return to Tumbai, but he had to live somewhere. At least
he thought so; and he needed, if not friends, allies. He saw in
Bobolo a possible ally. He knew that the chief had stolen the white
priestess, and he hoped that this knowledge might prove of
advantage to him; but he said nothing about the white girl. He
believed that she was in the village and that sooner or later he
would see her. They had talked of many things since his arrival,
but they had not spoken of the Leopard Men nor of the white girl.
Sobito was waiting for any turn of events that would give him a cue
to his advantage.</p>

<p>Bobolo was nervous. He had been planning to take food to Rebega
this day and visit his white wife. Sobito had upset his plans. He
tried to think of some way by which he could rid himself of his
unwelcome guest. Poison occurred to him; but he had already gone
too far in arousing the antagonism of the Leopard Men, and knowing
that there were loyal members of the clan in his village, he feared
to add the poisoning of a priest to his other crime against the
Leopard God.</p>

<p>The day dragged on. Bobolo had not yet discovered why Sobito had
come to his village; Sobito had not yet seen the white girl. Old
Timer was still perched in the tree overlooking the village. He was
hungry and thirsty, but he did not dare desert his post lest
something might occur in the village that it would be to his
advantage to see. Off and on all day he had seen Bobolo and Sobito.
They were always talking. He wondered if they were discussing the
fate of the girl. He wished that night would come. He would like to
get down and stretch his legs and get a drink. His thirst annoyed
him more than his hunger; but even if he had contemplated deserting
his post to obtain water, it could not be done now. The women in
the field had worked closer to his tree. Two of them were just
beneath its overhanging branches. They paused in the shade to rest,
their tongues rattling ceaselessly.</p>

<p>Old Timer had overheard a number of extremely intimate anecdotes
relating to members of the tribe. He learned that if a certain lady
were not careful her husband was going to catch her in an
embarrassing situation, that certain charms are more efficacious
when mixed with nail parings, that the young son of another lady
had a demon in his belly that caused him intense suffering when he
overate. These things did not interest Old Timer greatly, but
presently one of the women asked a question that brought him to
alert attention.</p>

<p>"What do you think Bobolo did with his white wife?"</p>

<p>"He told Ubooga that he had sent her back to the Leopard Men
from whom he says that he stole her," replied the other.</p>

<p>"Bobolo has a lying tongue in his head," rejoined the first
woman; "it does not know the truth."</p>

<p>"I know what he did with her," volunteered the other. "I
overheard Kapopa telling his wife."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He said that they took her to the village of the little
men."</p>

<p>"They will eat her."</p>

<p>"No, Bobolo has promised to give them food every moon if they
keep her for him."</p>

<p>"I would not like to be in the village of the little men no
matter what they promised. They are eaters of men, they are always
hungry, and they are great liars." Then the women's work carried
them away from the tree, and Old Timer heard no more; but that
which he had heard had changed all his plans.</p>

<p>No longer was he interested in the village of Bobolo; once again
it was only another native village.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17">XVII. &mdash; CHARGING LIONS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Tarzan of the Apes left the camp of the
Utengas, he appropriated one of the canoes of the defeated Leopard
Men, as Sobito was to do several hours later, and paddled across
the broad river to its opposite shore. His destination was the
village of Bobolo; his mission, to question the chief relative to
the white girl. He felt no keen personal interest in her and was
concerned only because of racial ties, which, after all, are not
very binding. She was a white woman and he was a white man, a fact
that he sometimes forgot, since, after all, he was a wild beast
before everything else.</p>

<p>He had been very active for several days and nights, and he was
tired. Little Nkima also was tired, nor did he let Tarzan forget it
for long; so when the ape-man leaped ashore from the canoe he
sought a comfortable place among the branches of a tree where they
might lie up for a few hours.</p>

<p>The sun was high in the heavens when Tarzan awoke. Little Nkima,
snuggling close to him, would have slept longer; but the ape-man
caught him by the scruff of the neck and shook him into
wakefulness. "I am hungry," said Tarzan; "let us find food and
eat."</p>

<p>"There is plenty to eat in the forest," replied Nkima; "let us
sleep a little longer."</p>

<p>"I do not want fruit or nuts," said the ape-man. "I want meat.
Nkima may remain here and sleep, but Tarzan goes to kill."</p>

<p>"I shall go with you," announced Nkima. "Strong in this forest
is the scent of Sheeta, the leopard. I am afraid to remain alone.
Sheeta is hunting, too; he is hunting for little Nkima."</p>

<p>The shadow of a smile touched the lips of the ape-man, one of
those rare smiles that it was vouchsafed but few to see. "Come," he
said, "and while Tarzan hunts for meat Nkima can rob birds'
nests."</p>

<p>The hunting was not good, for though the apeman ranged far
through the forest his searching nostrils were not rewarded with
the scent of flesh that he liked. Always strong was the scent of
Sheeta, but Tarzan liked not the flesh of the carnivores. Driven to
it by the extremity of hunger, he had eaten more than once of
Sheeta and Numa and Sabor; but it was the flesh of the herbivores
that he preferred.</p>

<p>Knowing that the hunting was better farther from the river,
where there were fewer men, he swung deeper and deeper into the
primeval forest until be was many miles from the river. This
country was new to Tarzan, and he did not like it; there was too
little game. This thought was in his mind when there came to his
nostrils the scent of Wappi, the antelope. It was very faint, but
it was enough. Straight into the wind swung Tarzan of the Apes, and
steadily the scent of Wappi grew stronger in his nostrils. Mingling
with it were other scents: the scent of Pacco, the zebra, and of
Numa, the lion; the fresh scent of open grassland.</p>

<p>On swung Tarzan of the Apes and little Nkima. Stronger grew the
scent spoor of the quarry in the nostrils of the hunter, stronger
the hunger-craving growing in his belly. His keen nostrils told him
that there was not one antelope ahead but many. This must be a good
hunting ground that he was approaching! Then the forest ended; and
a rolling, grassy plain, tree-dotted, stretched before him to blue
mountains in the distance.</p>

<p>Before him, as he halted at the forest's edge, the plain was
rich with lush grasses; a mile away a herd of antelope grazed, and
beyond them the plain was dotted with zebra. An almost inaudible
growl rumbled from his deep chest; it was the anticipatory growl of
the hunting beast that is about to feed.</p>

<p>Strong in his nostrils was the scent of Numa, the lion. In those
deep grasses were lions; but in such rich hunting ground, they must
be well fed, he knew, and so he could ignore them. They would not
bother him, if he did not bother them, which he had no intention of
doing.</p>

<p>To stalk the antelope amid the concealment of this tall grass
was no difficult matter for the apeman. He did not have to see
them; his nose would guide him to them. First he noted carefully
the terrain, the location of each tree, an outcropping of rock that
rose above the grasses. It was likely that the lions would be lying
up there in the shadow of the rocks. He beckoned to Nkima, but
Nkima held back. "Numa is there," complained the monkey, "with all
his brothers and sisters. They are waiting there to eat little
Nkima. Nkima is afraid."</p>

<p>"Stay where you are, then; and when I have made my kill I will
return."</p>

<p>"Nkima is afraid to remain."</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head. "Nkima is a great coward," he said. "He
may do what he pleases. Tarzan goes to make his kill."</p>

<p>Silently he slid into the tall grasses, while Nkima crouched
high in a great tree, choosing the lesser of two evils. The little
monkey watched him go out into the great plain where the lions
were; and he shivered, though it was very warm.</p>

<p>Tarzan made a detour to avoid the rocks; but even where he was,
the lion scent was so strong that he almost lost the scent of
Wappi. Yet he felt no apprehension. Fear he did not know. By now he
had covered half the distance to the quarry, which was still
feeding quietly, unmindful of danger.</p>

<p>Suddenly to his left he heard the angry coughing growl of a
lion. It was a warning growl that the ape-man knew might presage a
charge. Tarzan sought no encounter with Numa. All that he wished
was to make his kill and depart. He moved away to the right. Fifty
feet ahead of him was a tree. If the lion charged, it might be
necessary to seek sanctuary there, but he did not believe that Numa
would charge. He had given him no reason to do so; then a cross
current of wind brought to his nostrils a scent that warned him of
his peril. It was the scent of Sabor, the lioness. Now Tarzan
understood; he had nearly stumbled upon a mating lion, which meant
that a charge was almost inevitable, for a mating lion will charge
anything without provocation.</p>

<p>Now the tree was but twenty-five feet away. A roar thundered
from the grasses behind him. A quick backward glance, showing the
grass tops waving tumultuously, revealed the imminence of his
danger; Numa was charging!</p>

<p>Up to that time he had seen no lion, but now a massive head
framed by a dark brown mane burst into view. Tarzan of the Apes was
angry. It galled him to flee. A dignified retreat prompted by
caution was one thing; abject flight, another. Few creatures can
move with the swiftness of Tarzan, and he had a start of twenty-
five feet. He could have reached the tree ahead of the lion, but he
did not attempt to do so&mdash;not at once. Instead he wheeled and
faced the roaring, green-eyed monster. Back went his spear arm, his
muscles rolling like molten steel beneath his bronzed skin, then
forward with all the weight of his powerful frame backed by those
mighty thews. The heavy Utenga war spear shot from his hand. Not
until then did Tarzan of the Apes turn and fly; but he did not run
from the lion that was pursuing him. Behind Numa he had seen Sabor
coming, and behind her the grasses waved in many places above the
rushing bodies of charging lions. Tarzan of the Apes fled from
certain and sudden death.</p>

<p>The spear momentarily checked the charge of the nearest lion
and, in that fraction of a split second that spelled the difference
between life and death the ape-man swarmed up the tree that had
been his goal, while the raking talons of Numa all but grazed his
heel.</p>

<p>Safe out of reach Tarzan turned and looked down. Below him a
great lion in his death throes was clawing at the haft of the spear
that was buried in his heart. Behind the first lion a lioness and
six more males had burst into view. Far out across the plain the
antelopes and the zebras were disappearing in the distance,
startled into flight by the roars of the charging lion.</p>

<p>The lioness, never pausing in her charge, ran far up the bole of
the tree in her effort to drag down the man-thing. She had
succeeded in getting one forearm across a lower branch, and she
hung there a moment in an effort to scramble farther upward; but
she could not get sufficient footing for her hind feet to force her
heavy weight higher, and presently she slipped back to the ground.
She sniffed at her dead mate and then circled the tree, growling.
The six males paced to and fro, adding their angry roars to the
protest of Sabor, while from above them the ape-man looked down and
through snarling lips growled out his own disappointment and
displeasure. In a tree top half a mile away a little monkey
screamed and scolded.</p>

<p>For half an hour the lioness circled the tree, looking up at
Tarzan, her yellow-green eyes blazing with rage and hatred; then
she lay down beside the body of her fallen mate, while the six
males squatted upon their haunches and watched now Sabor, now
Tarzan, and now one another.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes gazed ruefully after his departed quarry and
back toward the forest. He was hungrier now than ever. Even if the
lions went away and permitted him to descend, he was still as far
from a meal as he had been when he awoke in the morning. He broke
twigs and branches from the tree and hurled them at Sabor in an
attempt to drive her away, knowing that wherever she went the males
would follow; but she only growled the more ferociously and
remained in her place beside the dead lion.</p>

<p>Thus passed the remainder of the day. Night came, and still the
lioness remained beside her dead mate. Tarzan upbraided himself for
leaving his bow and arrows behind in the forest. With them he could
have killed the lioness and the lions and escaped. Without them he
could do nothing but throw futile twigs at them and wait. He
wondered how long he would have to wait. When the lioness waxed
hungry enough she would go away; but when would that be? From the
size of her belly and the smell of her breath the man-beast
squatting above her knew that she had eaten recently and well.</p>

<p>Tarzan had long since resigned himself to his fate. When he had
found that hurling things at Sabor would not drive her away, he had
desisted. Unlike man he did not continue to annoy her merely for
the purpose of venting his displeasure. Instead he curled himself
in a crotch of the tree and slept.</p>

<p>In the forest, at the edge of the plain, a terrified little
monkey rolled himself into the tiniest ball that he could achieve
and suffered in silence. If he were too large or too noisy, he
feared that he might sooner attract the attention of Sheeta, the
leopard. That Sheeta would come eventually and eat him he was
certain. But why hasten the evil moment?</p>

<p>When the sun rose and he was still alive, Nkima was surprised
but not wholly convinced. Sheeta might have overlooked him in the
dark, but in the daylight he would be sure to see him; however,
there was some consolation in knowing that he could see Sheeta
sooner and doubtless escape him. With the rising sun his spirits
rose, but he was still unhappy because Tarzan had not returned. Out
on the plain he could see him in the tree, and he wondered why he
did not come down and return to little Nkima. He saw the lions,
too; but it did not occur to him that it was they who prevented
Tarzan returning. He could not conceive that there might be any
creature or any number of creatures which his mighty master could
not overcome.</p>

<p>Tarzan was irked. The lioness gave no sign that she was ever
going away. Several of the males had departed to hunt during the
night, and one that had made a kill nearby lay on it not far from
the tree. Tarzan hoped that Sabor would be attracted by it; but
though the odor of the kill was strong in the ape-man's nostrils,
the lioness was not tempted away by it.</p>

<p>Noon came. Tarzan was famished and his throat was dry. He was
tempted to cut a club from a tree branch and attempt to battle his
way to liberty; but he knew only too well what the outcome would
be. Not even he, Tarzan of the Apes, could hope to survive the
onslaught of all those lions, which was certain to follow
immediately he descended from the tree if the lioness attacked him.
That she would attack him if he approached that close to her dead
mate was a foregone conclusion. There was nothing to do but wait.
Eventually she would go away; she could not remain there
forever.</p>

<p>Nor did she. Shortly after noon she arose and slunk toward the
kill that one of the males had made. As she disappeared in the tall
grass, the other males followed her. It was fortunate for the
ape-man that the kill lay beyond the tree in which he had taken
refuge, away from the forest. He did not wait after the last male
disappeared among the waving grasses, but dropped from the tree,
recovered his spear from the carcass of Numa, and started at a
brisk walk toward the forest. His keen ears took note of every
sound. Not even soft-padded Numa could have stalked him without his
being aware of it, but no lion followed him.</p>

<p>Nkima was frantic with joy. Tarzan was only hungry and thirsty.
He was not long in finding the means for quenching his thirst, but
it was late before he made a kill and satisfied his hunger; then
his thoughts returned to the object of his excursion. He would go
to the village of Bobolo and reconnoiter.</p>

<p>He had gone far inland from the river, and his hunting had taken
him down the valley to a point which he guessed was about opposite
the village where he hoped to find the girl. He had passed a band
of great apes led by Zu-tho, whom he had thought far away in his
own country; and he had stopped to talk with them for a moment; but
neither the great apes nor Tarzan, who was reared among them, are
loquacious, so that he soon left them to pursue the purpose he had
undertaken. Now he swung through the trees directly toward the
river, where he knew that he could find landmarks to assure him of
his position.</p>

<p>It was already dark; so Nkima clung to the back of his master,
his little arms about the bronzed neck. By day he swung through the
trees with Tarzan; but at night he clung tightly to him, for by
night there are terrible creatures abroad in the jungle; and they
are all hunting for little Nkima.</p>

<p>The scent spoor of man was growing stronger in the nostrils of
Tarzan, so that he knew that he was approaching a village of the
Gomangani. He was certain that it could not be the village of
Bobolo; it was too far from the river. Furthermore, there was an
indication in the odors wafted to his nostrils that the people who
inhabited it were not of the same tribe as Bobolo. The mere
presence of Gomangani would have been sufficient to have caused
Tarzan to investigate, for it was the business of the Lord of the
Jungle to have knowledge of all things in his vast domain; but
there was another scent spoor faintly appreciable among the varied
stenches emanating from the village that in itself would have been
sufficient to turn him from his direct path to the river. It was
but the faintest suggestion of a scent, yet the ape-man recognized
it for what it was; and it told him that the girl he sought was
close at hand.</p>

<p>Silently he approached the village, until from the outspreading
branches of a great tree he looked down upon the compound before
the hut of Rebega, the chief.</p>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; ARROWS OUT OF THE
NIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE KID had returned to his camp after a fruitless
search for elephants. He hoped that Old Timer had been more
successful. At first he thought that the other's protracted absence
indicated this, but as the days passed and his friend did not
return he became anxious. His position was not an enviable one. The
faith and loyalty of his three retainers had been sorely shaken.
Only a genuine attachment for the two white men had kept them with
them during the recent months of disappointment and ill fortune.
How much longer he could expect to hold them he did not know. He
was equally at a loss to imagine what he would do if they deserted
him, yet his chief concern was not for himself but for his
friend.</p>

<p>Fortunately he had been able to keep the camp well supplied with
fresh meat, and the natives, therefore, reasonably contented; but
he knew that they longed to return to their own village now that
they could not see any likelihood of profiting by their connection
with these two poverty-stricken white men.</p>

<p>Such thoughts were occupying his mind late one afternoon upon
his return from a successful hunt for meat when his reveries were
interrupted by the shouts of his boys. Glancing up, he saw two of
the men who had accompanied Old Timer entering the camp. Leaping to
his feet, he went forward to meet them, expecting to see his friend
and the third following closely behind them; but when he was close
enough to see the expressions upon their faces he realized that
something was amiss.</p>

<p>"Where are your bwana and Andereya?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"They are both dead," replied one of the returning blackes.</p>

<p>"Dead!" ejaculated The Kid. It seemed to him that the bottom had
suddenly dropped from his world. Old Timer dead! It was
unthinkable. Until now he had scarcely realized how much he had
depended upon the older man for guidance and support, nor to what
extent this friendship had become a part of him. "How did it
happen?" he inquired dully. "Was it an elephant?"</p>

<p>"The Leopard men, Bwana," explained the black who had made the
announcement.</p>

<p>"The Leopard Men! Tell me how it happened."</p>

<p>With attention to minute details and with much circumlocution
the two boys told all they knew; and when at last they had
finished, The Kid saw a suggestion of a ray of hope. They had not
actually seen Old Timer killed. He might still be a prisoner in the
village of Gato Mgungu.</p>

<p>"He said that if he had not returned to us by the time the
shadow of the forest had left the palisade in the morning we should
know that he was dead," insisted a black.</p>

<p>The youth mentally surveyed his resources: five discontented
blacks and himself&mdash;six men to march upon the stronghold of
the Leopard Men and demand an accounting of them. And five of these
men held the Leopard Men in such awe that he knew that they would
not accompany him. He raised his eyes suddenly to the waiting
blacks. "Be ready to march when the sun rises tomorrow," he
snapped.</p>

<p>There was a moment's hesitation. "Where do we march?" demanded
one, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Where I lead you," he replied, shortly; then he returned to his
tent, his mind occupied with plans for the future and with the
tragic story that the two <i>boys</i> had narrated.</p>

<p>He wondered who the girl might be. What was Old Timer doing
pursuing a white woman? Had he gone crazy, or had he forgotten that
he hated all white women? Of course, he reflected, there was
nothing else that his friend might have done. The girl had been in
danger, and that of course would have been enough to have sent Old
Timer on the trail of her abductors; but how had he become involved
with her in the first place? The boys had not been explicit upon
this point. He saw them now, talking with their fellows. All of
them appeared excited. Presently they started across the camp
toward his tent.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it now?" he asked as they stopped before him.</p>

<p>"If you are going to the village of the Leopard Men, Bwana,"
announced the spokesman, "we will not follow you. We are few, and
they would kill us all and eat us."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed The Kid. "They will do nothing of the
sort. They would not dare."</p>

<p>"That is what the old bwana said," replied the spokesman, "but
he did not return to us. He is dead."</p>

<p>"I do not believe that he is dead," retorted The Kid. "We are
going to find out."</p>

<p>"You, perhaps, but not we," rejoined the man.</p>

<p>The Kid saw that he could not shake them in their decision. The
outlook appeared gloomy, but he was determined to go if he had to
go alone. Yet what could he accomplish without them? A plan
occurred to him.</p>

<p>"Will you go part way with me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"How far?"</p>

<p>"To the village of Bobolo. I may be able to get help from
him."</p>

<p>For a moment the blacks argued among themselves in low voices;
then their spokesman turned again to the white man. "We will go as
far as the village of Bobolo," he said.</p>

<p>"But no farther," added another.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Old Timer waited until the women hoeing in the
field had departed a little distance from the tree in which he was
hiding; then he slipped cautiously to the ground on the side
opposite them. He had never been to the village of the little men.
He had often heard the natives of Bobolo's village speak of them
and knew in a general way the direction in which the pygmy village
lay, but there were many trails in this part of the forest. It
would be easy to take the wrong one.</p>

<p>He knew enough of the Betetes to know that he might have
difficulty in entering their village. They were a savage, warlike
race of Pygmies and even reputed to be cannibals. The trails to
their village were well guarded, and the first challenge might be a
poisoned spear. Yet, though he knew these things to be true, the
idea of abandoning his search for the girl because of them did not
occur to him. He did not hesitate in reaching a decision, but the
very fact that she was there hastened it instead.</p>

<p>Dark soon overtook him, but he stopped only because he could not
see to go on. At the first break of dawn he was away again. The
forest was dense and gloomy. He could not see the sun, and he was
haunted by the conviction that he was on the wrong trail. It must
have been about mid-afternoon when he came to a sudden halt,
baffled. He had recognized his own footprints in the trail ahead of
him; he had walked in a great circle.</p>

<p>Absolutely at a loss as to which direction to take, he struck
out blindly along a narrow, winding trail that intercepted the one
he had been traversing at the point at which he had made his
harrowing discovery. Where the trail led or in what direction he
could not know, nor even whether it led back toward the river or
farther inland: but he must be moving, he must go on.</p>

<p>Now he examined carefully every trail that crossed or branched
from the one he was following. The trails, some of them at least,
were well-worn; the ground was damp; the spoor of animals was often
plain before his eyes. But he saw nothing that might afford him a
clue until shortly before dark; then careful scrutiny of an
intersecting trail revealed the tiny footprint of a pygmy. Old
Timer was elated. It was the first sense of elation that he had
experienced during all that long, dreary day. He had come to hate
the forest. Its sunless gloom oppressed him. It had assumed for him
the menacing personality of a powerful, remorseless enemy that
sought not only to thwart his plans but to lure him to his death.
He longed to defeat it&mdash;to show it that he was more cunning,
if less powerful than it.</p>

<p>He hastened along the new trail, but darkness overtook him
before he learned whether or not it led to his goal. Yet now he did
not stop as he had the previous night. So long had the forest
defeated and mocked him that perhaps he was a little mad. Something
seemed to be calling to him out of the blackness ahead. Was it a
woman's voice? He knew better, yet he listened intently as he
groped his way through the darkness.</p>

<p>Presently his tensely listening ears were rewarded by a sound.
It was not the voice of a woman calling to him, but it was still
the sound of human voices. Muffled and indistinct, it came to him
out of that black void ahead. His heart beat a little faster; he
moved more cautiously.</p>

<p>When he came at last within sight of a village he could see
nothing beyond the palisade other than the firelight playing upon
the foliage of overspreading trees and upon the thatched roofs of
huts, but he knew that it was the village of the little men. There,
behind that palisade, was the girl he sought. He wanted to cry
aloud, shouting words of encouragement to her. He wanted her to
know that he was near her, that he had come to save her; but he
made no sound.</p>

<p>Cautiously he crept nearer. There was no sign of a sentry. The
little men do not need sentries in the dark forest at night, for
few are the human enemies that dare invite the dangers of the
nocturnal jungle. The forest was their protection by night.</p>

<p>The poles that had been stuck in the ground to form the palisade
were loosely bound together by lianas; there were spaces between
them through which he glimpsed the firelight. Old Timer moved
cautiously forward until he stood close against the palisade beside
a gate and, placing an eye to one of the apertures, looked into the
village of Rebega. What he saw was not particularly interesting: a
group of natives gathered before a central hut which he assumed to
be the hut of the chief. They appeared to be arguing about
something, and some of the men were dancing. He could see their
heads bobbing above those of the natives who shut off his view.</p>

<p>Old Timer was not interested in what the little men were doing.
At least he thought he was not. He was interested only in the girl,
and he searched the village for some evidence of her presence
there, though he was not surprised that he did not see her.
Undoubtedly she was a prisoner in one of the huts. Had he known the
truth he would have been far more interested in the activities of
that little group of pygmies, the bodies of some of which hid from
his sight the bound girl at its center.</p>

<p>Old Timer examined the gate and discovered that it was crudely
secured with a fiber rope. From his breeches' pocket he took the
pocket knife that the Leopard Men had overlooked and began cutting
the fastening, congratulating himself upon the fact that the
villagers were occupied to such an extent with something over by
the chief's hut that he could complete his work without fear of
detection.</p>

<p>He planned only to prepare a way into the village, when he
undertook his search for the girl after the natives had retired to
their huts for the night, and a way out when he had found her. For
some unaccountable reason his spirits were high; success seemed
assured. Already he was anticipating his reunion with the girl;
then there was a little break in the circle of natives standing
between him and the center of the group, and through that break he
saw a sight that turned him suddenly cold with dread.</p>

<p>It was the girl, bound hand and foot, and a savage-faced
devil-woman wielding a large knife. As Old Timer saw the hideous
tableau revealed for a moment to his horrified gaze, the woman
seized the girl by the hair and forced her head back, the knife
flashed in the light of the cooking fires that had been prepared
against the coming feast, and Old Timer, unarmed save for a small
knife, burst through the gates and ran toward the scene of
impending murder.</p>

<p>A cry of remonstrance burst from his lips that sounded in the
ears of the astonished pygmies like the war cry of attacking
natives, and at the same instant an arrow passed through the body
of Wlala from behind, transfixing her heart. Old Timer's eyes were
on the executioner at the moment, and he saw the arrow, as did many
of the pygmies; but like them he had no idea from whence it had
come&mdash;whether from friend or foe.</p>

<p>For a moment the little men stood in stupid astonishment, but
the white man realized that their inactivity would be brief when
they discovered that they had only a lone and unarmed man to deal
with; it was then that there flashed to his fertile brain a forlorn
hope.</p>

<p>Half turning, he shouted back toward the open gate, "Surround
the village! Let no one escape, but do not kill unless they kill
me." He spoke in a dialect that he knew they would understand, the
language of the people of Bobolo's tribe; and then to the
villagers, "Stand aside! Let me take the white woman, and you will
not be harmed." But he did not wait for permission.</p>

<p>Leaping to the girl's side, he raised her in his arms; and then
it was that Rebega seemed to awaken from his stupor. He saw only
one man. Perhaps there were others outside his village, but did he
not have warriors who could fight? "Kill the white man!" he
shouted, leaping forward.</p>

<p>A second arrow passed through the body of Rebega; and as he sank
to the ground, three more, shot in rapid succession, brought down
three warriors who had sprung forward to do his bidding. Instantly
terror filled the breasts of the remaining pygmies, sending them
scurrying to the greater security of their huts.</p>

<p>Throwing the girl across his shoulder, Old Timer bolted for the
open gate and disappeared in the forest. He heard a rending and a
crash behind him, but he did not know what had happened, nor did he
seek to ascertain.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19">XIX. &mdash; "THE DEMONS ARE
COMING!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE sight that met the eyes of Tarzan of the Apes
as he looked down into the compound of the village of Rebega, the
Betete chief, gave him cause for astonishment. He saw a white girl
being bound. He saw the cooking pots and the fires, and he guessed
what was about to transpire. He was on his way to the village of
Bobolo in search of a white girl imprisoned there. Could there be
two white girls captives of natives in this same district? It
scarcely seemed probable. This, therefore, must be the white girl
whom he had supposed in the village of Bobolo; but how had she come
here?</p>

<p>The question was of less importance than the fact that she was
here or the other still more important fact that he must save her.
Dropping to the ground, he scaled the palisade and crept through
the village from the rear, keeping well in the shadow of the huts;
while little Nkima remained behind in the tree that the ape-man had
quitted, his courage having carried him as far as it could.</p>

<p>When the pygmies had cleared a space for their village they had
left a few trees within the enclosure to afford them shade, and one
of these grew in front of the hut of Rebega. To this tree Tarzan
made his way, keeping the bole of it between him and the natives
assembled about the fires; and into its branches he swung just in
time to see Wlala seize the girl by the hair and lift her blade to
slash the fair throat.</p>

<p>There was no time for thought, barely time for action. The
muscles of the ape-man responded almost automatically to the
stimulus of necessity. To fit an arrow to his bow and to loose the
shaft required but the fraction of a split second. Simultaneously
he heard the noise at the gate, saw the white man running forward,
heard him yell. Even had he not recognized him, he would have known
instinctively that he was here for but one purpose&mdash;the rescue
of the girl. And when he heard Rebega's command, knowing the danger
that the white man faced, he shot the additional arrows that
brought down those most closely menacing him and frightened the
rest of the pygmies away for the short time that was necessary to
permit the removal of the captive from the village.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes had no quarrel with the little men. He had
accomplished that for which he had come and was ready to depart,
but as he turned to descend from the tree there was a rending of
wood, and the limb upon which he was standing broke suddenly from
the stem of the tree and crashed to the ground beneath, carrying
the ape-man with it.</p>

<p>The fall stunned him momentarily, and when he regained
consciousness he found his body overrun by pygmy warriors who were
just completing the act of trussing his arms and legs securely. Not
knowing that they had completed their job, nor how well they had
done it, the ape-man surged heavily upon his bonds, the effort
sending the pygmies in all directions; but the cords held and the
Lord of the Jungle knew that he was the captive of as cruel and
merciless a people as the forests of the great river basin
concealed.</p>

<p>The Betetes were still nervous and fearful. They had refastened
the gates that Old Timer had opened, and a force of warriors was
guarding this entrance as well as the one at the opposite end of
the village. Poison-tipped spears and arrows were in readiness for
any enemy who might approach, but the whole village was in a state
of nervous terror bordering upon panic. Their chief was dead; the
white girl whom they had been about to devour was gone; a gigantic
white man had dropped from the heavens into their village and was
now their prisoner. All these things had happened within a few
seconds; it was little wonder that they were nervous.</p>

<p>As to their new captive there was a difference of opinion. Some
thought that he should be slain at once, lest he escape. Others,
impressed by the mysterious manner of his entrance into the
village, were inclined to wait, being fearful because of their
ignorance of his origin, which might easily be supernatural.</p>

<p>The possible danger of an attack by an enemy beyond their gates
finally was a reprieve for the ape-man, for the simple reason that
they dared not distract their attention from the defense of the
village to indulge in an orgy of eating. Tomorrow night would
answer even better, their leaders argued; and so a score of them
half carried, half dragged the great body of their prisoner into an
unoccupied hut, two of their number remaining outside the entrance
on guard.</p>

<p>Swaying upon the topmost branch of a tree, Nkima hugged himself
in grief and terror, but principally terror; for in many respects
he was not greatly unlike the rest of us who, with Nkima, have
descended from a common ancestor. His own troubles affected him
more than the troubles of another, even though that other was a
loved one.</p>

<p>This seemed a cruel world indeed to little Nkima. He was never
long out of one trouble before another had him in its grip, though
more often than not the troubles were of his own making. This time,
however, he had been behaving perfectly (largely through the fact
that he was terror-stricken in this strange forest); he had not
insulted a single creature all day nor thrown missiles at one; yet
here he was alone in the dark, the scent of Sheeta strong in his
nostrils, and Tarzan a prisoner in the hands of the little
Gomangani.</p>

<p>He wished that Muviro and the other Waziri were here, or Jad-
bal-ja, the Golden Lion. Either of these would come to the rescue
of Tarzan and save him, too; but they were far away. So far away
were they that Nkima had long since given up hope of seeing any of
them again. He wanted to go into the village of the little
Gomangani that he might be near his master, but he dared not. He
could only crouch in the tree and wait for Sheeta or Kudu. If
Sheeta came first, as he fully expected him to do, that would be
the last of little Nkima. But perhaps Kudu, the sun, would come
first, in which event there would be another day of comparative
safety before hideous night settled down again upon an unhappy
world.</p>

<p>As his thoughts dwelt upon such lugubrious prophecies, there
rose from the village below him the uncanny notes of a weird cry.
The natives in the village were startled and terrified, because
they only half guessed what it was. They had heard it before
occasionally all during their lives, sounding mysterious and awe-
inspiring from the dark distances of the jungle; but they had never
heard it so close to them before. It sounded almost in the village.
They had scarcely had time to think these thoughts when they
learned that the terrible cry had been voiced from one of their own
huts.</p>

<p>Two terrified warriors apprised them of this, the two warriors
who had been placed on guard over their giant captive. Wide-eyed
and breathless, they fled from their post of duty. "It is no man
that we have captured," cried one of them, "but a demon. He has
changed himself into a great ape. Did you not hear him?"</p>

<p>The other natives were equally frightened. They had no chief, no
one to give orders, no one to whom they might look for advice and
protection in an emergency of this nature. "Did you see him?"
inquired one of the sentries. "What does he look like?"</p>

<p>"We did not see him, but we heard him."</p>

<p>"If you did not see him, how do you know that he has changed
himself into a great ape?"</p>

<p>"Did I not say that I heard him?" demanded a sentry. "When the
lion roars, do you have to go out into the forest to look at him to
know that he is a lion?"</p>

<p>The skeptic scratched his head. Here was logic irrefutable.
However, he felt that he must have the last word. "If you had
looked, you would have known for sure," he said. "Had I been on
guard I should have looked in the hut. I should not have run away
like an old woman."</p>

<p>"Go and look, then," cried one of the sentries. The skeptic was
silenced.</p>

<p>Nkima heard the weird cry from the village of the little men. It
thrilled him, too, but it did not frighten him. He listened
intently, but no sound broke the silence of the great forest. He
became uneasy. He wished to raise his voice, too, but he dared not,
knowing that Sheeta would hear. He wished to go to the side of his
master, but fear was stronger than love. All he could do was wait
and shiver; he did not dare whimper for fear of Sheeta.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed&mdash;five minutes during which the Betetes
did a maximum of talking and a minimum of thinking. However, a few
of them had almost succeeded in screwing up their courage to a
point that would permit them to investigate the hut in which the
captive was immured, when again the weird cry shattered the silence
of the night; whereupon the investigation was delayed by common
consent.</p>

<p>Now, faintly from afar sounded the roar of a lion; and a moment
later out of the dim distance came an eerie cry that seemed a
counterpart of that which had issued from the hut. After that,
silence fell again upon the forest, but only for a short time. Now
the wives of Rebega and the wives of the warriors who had been
killed commenced their lamentations. They moaned and howled and
smeared themselves with ashes.</p>

<p>An hour passed, during which the warriors held a council and
chose a temporary chief. It was Nyalwa, who was known as a brave
warrior. The little men felt better now; there was a recrudescence
of courage. Nyalwa perceived this and realized that he should take
advantage of it while it was hot. He also felt that, being chief,
he should do something important.</p>

<p>"Let us go and kill the white man," he said. "We shall be safer
when he is dead."</p>

<p>"And our bellies will be fuller," remarked a warrior. "Mine is
very empty now."</p>

<p>"But what if he is not a man but a demon?" demanded another.</p>

<p>This started a controversy that lasted another hour, but at last
it was decided that several of them should go to the hut and kill
the prisoner; then more time was consumed deciding who should go.
And during this time little Nkima had experienced an accession of
courage. He had been watching the village all the time; and he had
seen that no one approached the hut in which Tarzan was confined
and that none of the natives were in that part of the village, all
of them being congregated in the open space before the hut of the
dead Rebega.</p>

<p>Fearfully Nkima descended from the tree and scampered to the
palisade, which he scaled at the far end of the village where there
were no little men, even those who had been guarding the rear gate
having deserted it at the first cry of the prisoner. It took him
but a moment to reach the hut in which Tarzan lay. At the entrance
he stopped and peered into the dark interior, but he could see
nothing. Again he grew very much afraid.</p>

<p>"It is little Nkima," he said. "Sheeta was there in the forest
waiting for me. He tried to stop me, but I was not afraid. I have
come to help Tarzan."</p>

<p>The darkness hid the smile that curved the lips of the apeman.
He knew his Nkima&mdash;knew that if Sheeta had been within a mile
of him he would not have moved from the safety of the slenderest
high-flung branch to which no Sheeta could pursue him. But he
merely said, "Nkima is very brave."</p>

<p>The little monkey entered the hut and leaped to the broad chest
of the ape-man. "I have come to gnaw the cords that hold you," he
announced.</p>

<p>"That you cannot do," replied Tarzan; "otherwise I should have
called you long ago."</p>

<p>"Why can I not?" demanded Nkima. "My teeth are very sharp."</p>

<p>"After the little men bound me with rope," explained Tarzan,
"they twisted copper wire about my wrists and ankles. Nkima cannot
gnaw through copper wire."</p>

<p>"I can gnaw through the cords," insisted Nkima, "and then I can
take the wire off with my fingers."</p>

<p>"You can try," replied Tarzan, "but I think that you cannot do
it."</p>

<p>Nyalwa had at last succeeded in finding five warriors who would
accompany him to the hut and kill the prisoner. He regretted that
he had suggested the plan, for he had found it necessary, as
candidate for permanent chieftainship, to volunteer to head the
party.</p>

<p>As they crept slowly toward the hut, Tarzan raised his head.
"They come!" he whispered to Nkima. "Go out and meet them.
Hurry!"</p>

<p>Nkima crept cautiously through the doorway. The sight that first
met his eyes was of six warriors creeping stealthily toward him.
"They come!" he screamed to Tarzan. "The little Gomangani come!"
And then he fled precipitately.</p>

<p>The Betetes saw him and were astonished. They were also not a
little fearful. "The demon has changed himself into a little monkey
and escaped," cried a warrior.</p>

<p>Nyalwa hoped so, but it seemed almost too good to be true;
however, he grasped at the suggestion. "Then we may go back," he
said. "If he has gone we cannot kill him."</p>

<p>"We should look into the hut," urged a warrior who had hoped to
be chief and who would have been glad to demonstrate that he was
braver than Nyalwa.</p>

<p>"We can look into it in the morning when it is light," argued
Nyalwa; "it is very dark now. We could see nothing."</p>

<p>"I will go and get a brand from the fire," said the warrior,
"and then if Nyalwa is afraid I will go into the hut. I am not
afraid."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," cried Nyalwa. "I will go in without any
light." But he had no more than said it than he regretted it. Why
was he always saying things first and thinking afterward?</p>

<p>"Then why do you stand still?" demanded the warrior. "You cannot
get into the hut by standing still."</p>

<p>"I am not standing still," remonstrated Nyalwa, creeping forward
very slowly.</p>

<p>While they argued, Nkima scaled the palisade and fled into the
dark forest. He was very much afraid, but he felt better when he
had reached the smaller branches of the trees, far above the
ground. He did not pause there, however, but swung on through the
darkness, for there was a fixed purpose in the mind of little
Nkima. Even his fear of Sheeta was submerged in the excitation of
his mission.</p>

<p>Nyalwa crept to the doorway of the hut and peered in. He could
see nothing. Prodding ahead of him with his spear he stepped
inside. The five warriors crowded to the entrance behind him.
Suddenly there burst upon Nyalwa's startled ears the same weird cry
that had so terrified them all before. Nyalwa wheeled and bolted
for the open air, but the five barred his exit. He collided with
them and tried to claw his way over or through them. He was
terrified, but it was a question as to whether he was any more
terrified than the five. They had not barred his way intentionally,
but only because they had not moved as quickly as he. Now they
rolled out upon the ground and, scrambling to their feet, bolted
for the opposite end of the village.</p>

<p>"He is still there," announced Nyalwa after he had regained his
breath. "That was what I went into the hut to learn. I have done
what I said I would."</p>

<p>"We were going to kill him," said the warrior who would be
chief. "Why did you not kill him? You were in there with him and
you had your spear. He was bound and helpless. If you had let me go
in, I would have killed him."</p>

<p>"Go in and kill him then," growled Nyalwa, disgusted.</p>

<p>"I have a better way," announced another warrior.</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded Nyalwa, ready to jump at any
suggestion.</p>

<p>"Let us all go and surround the hut; then when you give the word
we will hurl our spears through the walls. In this way we shall be
sure to kill the white man."</p>

<p>"That is just what I was going to suggest," stated Nyalwa. "We
will all go; follow me!"</p>

<p>The little men crept again stealthily toward the hut. Their
numbers gave them courage. At last they had surrounded it and were
waiting the signal from Nyalwa. The spears with their poisoned tips
were poised. The life of the apeman hung in the balance, when a
chorus of angry growls just beyond the palisade stilled the word of
command on the lips of Nyalwa.</p>

<p>"What is that?" he cried.</p>

<p>The little men glanced toward the palisade and saw dark forms
surmounting it. "The demons are coming!" shrieked one.</p>

<p>"It is the hairy men of the forest," cried another.</p>

<p>Huge, dark forms scaled the palisade and dropped into the
village. The Betetes dropped back, hurling their spears. A little
monkey perched upon the roof of a hut screamed and chattered. "This
way!" he cried. "This way, Zu-tho! Here is Tarzan of the Apes in
this nest of the Gomangani."</p>

<p>A huge, hulking form with great shoulders and long arms rolled
toward the hut. Behind him were half a dozen enormous bulls. The
Betetes had fallen back to the front of Rebega's hut.</p>

<p>"Here!" called Tarzan. "Tarzan is here, Zu-tho!"</p>

<p>The great ape stooped and peered into the dark interior of the
hut. His enormous frame was too large for the small doorway. With
his great hands he seized the hut by its door posts and tore it
from the ground, tipping it over upon its back, as little Nkima
leaped, screaming, to the roof of an adjacent hut.</p>

<p>"Carry me out into the forest," directed the ape-man.</p>

<p>Zu-tho lifted the white man in his arms and carried him to the
palisade, while the pygmies huddled behind the hut of Rebega, not
knowing what was transpiring in that other part of their village.
The other bulls followed, growling angrily. They did not like the
scent of the man-things. They wished to get away. As they had come,
they departed; and a moment later the dark shadows of the jungle
engulfed them.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap20" id="chap20">XX. &mdash; "I HATE YOU!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS Old Timer carried the girl out of the village
of the Betetes into the forest, every fiber of his being thrilled
to the contact of her soft, warm body. At last he held her in his
arms. Even the danger of their situation was forgotten for the
moment in the ecstasy of his gladness. He had found her! He had
saved her! Even in the excitement of the moment he realized that no
other woman had ever aroused within him such an overpowering tide
of emotion.</p>

<p>She had not spoken; she had not cried out. As a matter of fact
she did not know into whose hands she had now fallen. Her reaction
to her rescue had been anything but a happy one, for she felt that
she had been snatched from merciful death to face some new horror
of life. The most reasonable explanation was that Bobolo had
arrived in time to snatch her from the hands of the pygmies, and
she preferred death to Bobolo.</p>

<p>A short distance from the village Old Timer lowered her to the
ground and commenced to cut away her bonds. He had not spoken
either. He had not dared trust his voice to speak, so loudly was
his heart pounding in his throat. When the last bond was cut he
helped her to her feet. He wanted to take her in his arms and crush
her to him, but something stayed him. Suddenly he felt almost
afraid of her. Then he found his voice.</p>

<p>"Thank God that I came in time," he said.</p>

<p>The girl voiced a startled exclamation of surprise. "You are a
white man!" she cried. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Who did you think I was?"</p>

<p>"Bobolo."</p>

<p>He laughed. "I am the man you don't like," he explained.</p>

<p>"Oh! And you risked your life to save me. Why did you do it? It
was obvious that you did not like me; perhaps that was the reason I
did not like you."</p>

<p>"Let's forget all that and start over."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," she agreed; "but you must have come a long way
and faced many dangers to save me. Why did you do it?"</p>

<p>"Because I&mdash;" He hesitated. "Because I couldn't see a white
woman fall into the hands of these devils."</p>

<p>"What are we going to do now? Where can we go?"</p>

<p>"We can't do much of anything before morning," he replied. "I'd
like to get a little farther away from that village; then we must
rest until morning. After that we'll try to reach my camp. It's two
days' march on the opposite side of the river&mdash;if I can find
the river. I got lost today trying to locate Rebega's village."</p>

<p>They moved on slowly through the darkness. He knew that they
were starting in the right direction, for when he had come to the
clearing where the village stood he had noted the constellations in
the sky; but how long they could continue to hold their course in
the blackness of the forest night where the stars were hidden from
their view, he did not know.</p>

<p>"What happened to you after Bobolo dragged me from the canoe at
the mouth of that frightful river?" she asked.</p>

<p>"They took me back to the temple."</p>

<p>The girl shuddered. "That terrible place!"</p>

<p>"They were going to&mdash;to prepare me for one of their
feasts," he continued. "I imagine I'll never be so close to death
as that again without dying. The priestesses were just about to
mess me up with their clubs."</p>

<p>"How did you escape?"</p>

<p>"It was nothing short of a miracle," he replied. "Even now I
cannot explain it. A voice called down from the rafters of the
temple, claiming to be the <i>muzimo</i> of some native. A
<i>muzimo,</i> you know, is some kind of ghost; I think each one of
them is supposed to have a <i>muzimo</i> that looks after him. Then
the finest looking white man I ever saw shinned down one of the
pillars, grabbed me right out from under the noses of the priests
and priestesses, and escorted me to the river where he had a canoe
waiting for me."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you ever seen him before?"</p>

<p>"No. I tell you it was a modern miracle, not unlike one that
happened in the pygmy village just as I had busted in to head off
that bloodthirsty, old she-devil who was going to knife you."</p>

<p>"The only miracle that I am aware of was your coming just when
you did; if there was another I didn't witness it. You see I had my
eyes closed, waiting for Wlala to use her knife, when you stopped
her."</p>

<p>"I didn't stop her."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That was the miracle."</p>

<p>"I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Just as the woman grabbed you by the hair and raised her knife
to kill you, an arrow passed completely through her body, and she
fell dead. Then as I rushed in and the warriors started to
interfere with me, three or four of them fell with arrows through
them, but where the arrows came from I haven't the slightest idea.
I didn't see anyone who might have shot them. I don't know whether
it was someone trying to aid us, or some natives attacking the
Betete village."</p>

<p>"Or some one else trying to steal me," suggested the girl. "I
have been stolen so many times recently that I have come to expect
it; but I hope it wasn't that, for they might be following us."</p>

<p>"Happy thought," commented Old Timer; "but I hope you're wrong.
I think you are, too, for if they had been following us to get you,
they would have been on us before. There is no reason why they
should have waited."</p>

<p>They moved on slowly through the darkness for about half an hour
longer; then the man stopped. "I think we had better rest until
morning," he said, "though I don't know just how we are going to
accomplish it. There is no place to lie down but the trail, and as
that is used by the leopards at night it isn't exactly a safe
couch."</p>

<p>"We might try the trees," she suggested.</p>

<p>"It is the only alternative. The underbrush is too thick
here&mdash;we couldn't find a place large enough to lie down. Can
you climb?"</p>

<p>"I may need a little help."</p>

<p>"I'll go up first and reach down and help you up," he
suggested.</p>

<p>A moment later he had found a low branch and clambered onto it.
"Here," he said, reaching down, "give me your hand." Without
difficulty he swung her to his side. "Stay here until I find a more
comfortable place."</p>

<p>She heard him climbing about in the tree for a few minutes, and
then he returned to her. "I found just the place," he announced.
"It couldn't have been better if it had been made to order." He
helped her to her feet, and then he put an arm about her and
assisted her from branch to branch as they climbed upward toward
the retreat he had located.</p>

<p>It was a great crotch where three branches forked, two of them
laterally and almost parallel. "I can fix this up like a Pullman,"
he observed. "Just wait a minute until I cut some small branches.
How I ever stumbled on it in the dark gets me."</p>

<p>"Another miracle, perhaps," she suggested.</p>

<p>Growing all about them were small branches, and it did not take
Old Timer long to cut as many as he needed. These he laid close
together across the two parallel branches. Over them he placed a
covering of leaves.</p>

<p>"Try that," he directed. "It may not be a feather bed, but it's
better than none."</p>

<p>"It's wonderful." She had stretched out on it in the first utter
relaxation she had experienced for days&mdash;relaxation of the
mind and nerves even more than of the body. For the first time in
days she did not lie with terror at her side.</p>

<p>He could see her only dimly in the darkness; but in his mind's
eyes he visualized the contours of that perfect form, the firm
bosom, the slender waist, the rounded thigh; and again passion
swept through him like a racing torrent of molten gold.</p>

<p>"Where are you going to sleep?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'll find a place," he replied huskily. He was edging closer to
her. His desire to take her in his arms was almost maniacal.</p>

<p>"I am so happy," she whispered sleepily. "I didn't expect ever
to be happy again. It must be because I feel so safe with you."</p>

<p>The man made no reply. Suddenly he felt very cold, as though his
blood had turned to water; then a hot flush suffused him. "What the
devil did she say that for?" he soliloquized. It angered him. He
felt that it was not fair. What right had she to say it? She was
not safe with him. It only made the thing that he contemplated that
much harder to do&mdash;took some of the pleasure from it. Had he
not saved her life at the risk of his own? Did she not owe him
something? Did not all women owe him a debt for what one woman had
done to him?</p>

<p>"It seems so strange," she said drowsily.</p>

<p>"What?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I was so afraid of you after you came to my camp, and now I
should be afraid if you were not here. It just goes to show that I
am not a very good judge of character, but really you were not very
nice then. You seem to have changed."</p>

<p>He made no comment, but he groped about in the darkness until he
had found a place where he could settle himself, not comfortably,
but with a minimum of discomfort. He felt that he was weak from
hunger and exhaustion. He would wait until tomorrow. He thought
that it might be easier then when her confidence in him was not so
fresh in his mind, but he did not give up his intention.</p>

<p>He wedged himself into a crotch where a great limb branched from
the main bole of the tree. He was very uncomfortable there, but at
least there was less danger that he might fall should he doze. The
girl was a short distance above him. She seemed to radiate an
influence that enveloped him in an aura at once delicious and
painful. He was too far from her to touch her, yet always he felt
her. Presently he heard the regular breathing that denoted that she
slept. Somehow it reminded him of a baby&mdash;innocent, trusting,
confident. He wished that it did not. Why was she so lovely? Why
did she have hair like that? Why had God given her such eyes and
lips? Why&mdash;Tired nature would be denied no longer. He
slept.</p>

<p>Old Timer was very stiff and sore when he awoke. It was
daylight. He glanced up toward the girl. She was sitting up looking
at him. When their eyes met she smiled. Little things, trivial
things often have a tremendous effect upon our lives. Had Kali
Bwana not smiled then in just the way that she did, the lives of
two people might have been very different.</p>

<p>"Good morning," she called, as Old Timer smiled back at her.
"Did you sleep in that awful position all night?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't so bad," he assured her; "at least I slept."</p>

<p>"You fixed such a nice place for me; why didn't you do the same
for yourself?"</p>

<p>"You slept well?" he asked.</p>

<p>"All night. I must have been dead tired; but perhaps what
counted most was the relief from apprehension. It is the first
night since before my men deserted me that I have felt free to
sleep."</p>

<p>"I am glad," he said; "and now we must be on the move; we must
get out of this district."</p>

<p>"Where can we go?"</p>

<p>"I want to go west first until we are below Bobolo's stamping
grounds and then cut across in a northerly direction toward the
river. We may have a little difficulty crossing it, but we shall
find a way. At present I am more concerned about the Betetes than
about Bobolo. His is a river tribe. They hunt and trap only a short
distance in from the river, but the Betetes range pretty well
through the forest. Fortunately for us they do not go very far to
the west."</p>

<p>He helped her to the ground, and presently they found a trail
that seemed to run in a westerly direction. Occasionally he saw
fruits that he knew to be edible and gathered them; thus they ate
as they moved slowly through the forest. They could not make rapid
progress because both were physically weak from abstinence from
sufficient food; but necessity drove them, and though they were
forced to frequent rests they kept going.</p>

<p>Thirst had been troubling them to a considerable extent when
they came upon a small stream, and here they drank and rested. Old
Timer had been carefully scrutinizing the trail that they had been
following for signs of the pygmies; but he had discovered no spoor
of human foot and was convinced that this trail was seldom used by
the Betetes.</p>

<p>The girl sat with her back against the stem of a small tree,
while Old Timer lay where he could gaze at her profile
surreptitiously. Since that morning smile he looked upon her out of
new eyes from which the scales of selfishness and lust had fallen.
He saw now beyond the glittering barrier of her physical charms a
beauty of character that far transcended the former. Now he could
appreciate the loyalty and the courage that had given her the
strength to face the dangers of this savage world
for&mdash;what?</p>

<p>The question brought his pleasant reveries to an abrupt
conclusion with a shock. For what? Why, for Jerry Jerome, of
course. Old Timer had never seen Jerry Jerome. All that he knew
about him was his name, yet he disliked the man with all the fervor
of blind jealousy. Suddenly he sat up.</p>

<p>"Are you married?" He shot the words as though from a
pistol.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him in surprise. "'Why, no," she replied.</p>

<p>"Are you engaged?"</p>

<p>"Aren't your questions a little personal?" There was just a
suggestion of the total frigidity that had marked her intercourse
with him that day that he had come upon her in her camp.</p>

<p>Why shouldn't he be personal, he thought. Had he not saved her
life; did she not owe him everything? Then came a realization of
the caddishness of his attitude. "I am sorry," he said.</p>

<p>For a long time he sat gazing at the ground, his arms folded
across his knees, his chin resting on them. The girl watched him
intently; those level, grey eyes seemed to be evaluating him. For
the first time since she had met him she was examining his face
carefully. Through the unkempt beard she saw strong, regular
features, saw that the man was handsome in spite of the dirt and
the haggard look caused by deprivation and anxiety. Neither was he
as old as she had thought him. She judged that he must still be in
his twenties.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she remarked presently, "that I do not even know
your name?"</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment before replying and then said, "The Kid
calls me Old Timer."</p>

<p>"That is not a name," she remonstrated, "and you are not
old."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he acknowledged, "but if a man is as old as he
feels I am the oldest living man."</p>

<p>"You are tired," she said soothingly, her voice like the caress
of a mother's hand; "you have been through so much, and all for
me." Perhaps she recalled the manner in which she had replied to
his recent question, and regretted it. "I think you should rest
here as long as you can."</p>

<p>"I am all right," he told her; "it is you who should rest, but
it is not safe here. We must go on, no matter how tired we are,
until we are farther away from the Betete country." He rose slowly
to his feet and offered her his hand.</p>

<p>Across the stream, through which he carried her despite her
objections that he must not overtax his strength, they came upon a
wider trail along which they could walk abreast. Here he stopped
again to cut two staffs. "They will help us limp along," he
remarked with a smile; "we are getting rather old, you know." But
the one that he cut for himself was heavy and knotted at one end.
It had more the appearance of a weapon than a walking stick.</p>

<p>Again they took up their weary flight, elbow to elbow. The feel
of her arm touching his occasionally sent thrills through every
fiber of his body; but recollection of Jerry Jerome dampened them.
For some time they did not speak, each occupied with his own
thoughts. It was the girl who broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Old Timer is not a name," she said; "I cannot call you
that&mdash;it's silly."</p>

<p>"It is not much worse than my real name," he assured her. "I was
named for my grandfather, and grandfathers so often have peculiar
names."</p>

<p>"I know it," she agreed, "but yet they were good old substantial
names. Mine was Abner."</p>

<p>"Did you have only one?" he bantered.</p>

<p>"Only one named Abner. What was yours, the one you were named
for?"</p>

<p>"Hiram; but my friends call me Hi," he added hastily.</p>

<p>"But your last name? I can't call you Hi."</p>

<p>"Why not? We are friends, I hope."</p>

<p>"All right," she agreed; "but you haven't told me your last
name."</p>

<p>"Just call me Hi," he said a little shortly.</p>

<p>"But suppose I have to introduce you to some one?"</p>

<p>"To whom, for instance?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Bobolo," she suggested, laughingly.</p>

<p>"I have already met the gentleman; but speaking about names," he
added, "I don't know yours."</p>

<p>"The natives called me Kali Bwana."</p>

<p>"But I am not a native," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"I like Kali," she said; "call me Kali."</p>

<p>"It means woman. All right, Woman."</p>

<p>"If you call me that, I shan't answer you."</p>

<p>"Just as you say, Kali." Then after a moment, "I rather like it
myself; it makes a cute name for a girl."</p>

<p>As they trudged wearily along, the forest became more open, the
underbrush was not so dense, and the trees were farther apart. In
an open space Old Timer halted and looked up at the sun; then he
shook his head.</p>

<p>"We've been going east instead of south," he announced.</p>

<p>"How hopeless!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry; it was stupid of me, but I couldn't see the sun
because of the damned trees. Oftentimes inanimate objects seem to
assume malign personalities that try to thwart one at every turn
and then gloat over his misfortunes."</p>

<p>"Oh, it wasn't your fault," she cried quickly. "I didn't intend
to imply that. You've done all that anyone could have."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we can do," he announced.</p>

<p>"Yes, what?"</p>

<p>"We can go on to the next stream and follow that to the river;
it's bound to run into the river somewhere. It's too dangerous to
go back to the one we crossed back there. In the meantime we might
as well make up our minds that we're in for a long, hard trek and
prepare for it."</p>

<p>"How? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"We must eat; and we have no means of obtaining food other than
the occasional fruits and tubers that we may find, which are not
very strengthening food to trek on. We must have meat, but we have
no means for obtaining it. We need weapons."</p>

<p>"And there is no sporting goods house near, not even a hardware
store." Her occasional, unexpected gaieties heartened him. She
never sighed or complained. She was often serious, as became their
situation; but even disaster, added to all the trials she had
endured for weeks, could not dampen her spirits entirely nor
destroy her sense of humor.</p>

<p>"We shall have to be our own armorers," he explained. "We shall
have to make our own weapons."</p>

<p>"Let's start on a couple of Thompson machine guns," she
suggested. "I should feel much safer if we had them."</p>

<p>"Bows and arrows and a couple of spears are about all we rate,"
he assured her.</p>

<p>"I imagine I could make a machine gun as readily," she admitted.
"What useless things modern women are!"</p>

<p>"I should scarcely say that. I don't know what I should do
without you." The involuntary admission slipped out so suddenly
that he scarcely realized what he had said&mdash;he, the woman-
hater. But the girl did, and she smiled.</p>

<p>"I thought you didn't like women," she remarked, quite
seriously. "It seems to me that I recall quite distinctly that you
gave me that impression the afternoon that you came to my
camp."</p>

<p>"Please don't," he begged. "I did not know you then."</p>

<p>"What a pretty speech! It doesn't sound at all like the old bear
I first met."</p>

<p>"I am not the same man, Kali." He spoke the words in a low voice
seriously.</p>

<p>To the girl it sounded like a confession and a plea for
forgiveness. Impulsively she placed a hand on his arm. The soft,
warm touch was like a spark to powder. He wheeled and seized her,
pressing her close to him, crushing her body to his as though he
would make them one; and in the same instant, before she could
prevent it, his lips covered hers in a brief, hot kiss of
passion.</p>

<p>She struck at him and tried to push him away. "How&mdash;how
dare you!" she cried. "I hate you!"</p>

<p>He let her go and they stood looking at one another, panting a
little from exertion and excitement.</p>

<p>"I hate you!" she repeated.</p>

<p>He looked into her blazing eyes steadily for a long moment. "I
love you, Kali," he said, "my Kali!"</p>

<h2><a name="chap21" id="chap21">XXI. &mdash; BECAUSE NSENENE
LOVED</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">ZU-THO, the great ape, had quarrelled with To-
yat, the king. Each had coveted a young she just come into
maturity. To-yat was a mighty bull, the mightiest of the tribe, for
which excellent reason he was king; therefore Zu-tho hesitated to
engage him in mortal combat. However, that did not lessen his
desire for the fair one; so he ran away with her, coaxing some of
the younger bulls who were dissatisfied with the rule of To-yat to
accompany them. They came and brought their mates. Thus are new
tribes formed. There is always a woman at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>Desiring peace, Zu-tho had moved to new hunting grounds far
removed from danger of a chance meeting with To-yat. Ga-yat, his
life-long friend, was among those who had accompanied him. Ga-yat
was a mighty bull, perhaps mightier than To-yat himself; but Ga-
yat was of an easy-going disposition. He did not care who was king
as long as he had plenty to eat and was not disturbed in the
possession of his mates, a contingency that his enormous size and
his great strength rendered remote.</p>

<p>Ga-yat and Zu-tho were good friends of Tarzan, perhaps Ga-yat
even more than the latter, for Ga-yat was more inclined to be
friendly; so when they saw Tarzan in the new jungle they had chosen
for their home they were glad, and when they heard his cry for help
they hastened to him, taking all but the two that Zu-tho left to
guard the shes and the balus.</p>

<p>They had carried Tarzan far away from the village of the
Gomangani to a little open glade beside a stream. Here they laid
him on soft grasses beneath the shade of a tree, but they could not
remove the wires that held his wrists and ankles. They tried and
Nkima tried; but all to no avail, though the little monkey finally
succeeded in gnawing the ropes which had also been placed around
both his wrists and his ankles.</p>

<p>Nkima and Ga-yat brought food and water to Tarzan, and the great
apes were a protection to him against the prowling carnivores; but
the ape-man knew that this could not last for long. Soon they would
move on to some other part of the forest, as was their way, nor
would any considerations of sympathy or friendship hold them. Of
the former they knew little or nothing, and of the latter not
sufficient to make them self- sacrificing.</p>

<p>Nkima would remain with him; he would bring him food and water,
but he would be no protection. At the first glimpse of Dango, the
hyaena, or Sheeta, the leopard, little Nkima would flee, screaming,
to the trees. Tarzan racked his fertile brain for a solution to his
problem. He thought of his great and good friend, Tantor, the
elephant, but was forced to discard him as a possibility for escape
as Tantor could no more remove his bonds than the apes. He could
carry him, but where? There was no friend within reach to untwist
the confining wire. Tantor would protect him, but of what use would
protection be if he must lie here bound and helpless. Better death
than that.</p>

<p>Presently, however, a solution suggested itself; and he called
Ga-yat to him. The great bull came lumbering to his side. "I am
Ga-yat," he announced, after the manner of the great apes. It was a
much shorter way of saying, "You called me, and I am here. What do
you want?"</p>

<p>"Ga-yat is not afraid of anything," was Tarzan's manner of
approaching the subject he had in mind.</p>

<p>"Ga-yat is not afraid," growled the bull. "Ga-yat kills."</p>

<p>"Ga-yat is not afraid of the Gomangani," continued the ape-
man.</p>

<p>"Ga-yat is not afraid," which was a much longer way of saying
no.</p>

<p>"Only the Tarmangani or the Gomangani can remove the bonds that
keep Tarzan a prisoner."</p>

<p>"Ga-yat kills the Tarmangani and the Gomangani."</p>

<p>"No," objected Tarzan. "Ga-yat will go and fetch one to take the
wires from Tarzan. Do not kill. Bring him here."</p>

<p>"Ga-yat understands," said the bull after a moment's
thought.</p>

<p>"Go now," directed the ape-man, and with no further words Ga-
yat lumbered away and a moment later had disappeared into the
forest.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">The Kid and his five followers arrived at the
north bank of the river opposite the village of Bobolo, where they
had no difficulty in attracting the attention of the natives upon
the opposite side and by means of signs appraising them that they
wished to cross.</p>

<p>Presently several canoes put out from the village and paddled up
stream to make the crossing. They were filled with warriors, for as
yet Bobolo did not know either the identity or numbers of his
visitors and was taking no chances. Sobito was still with him and
had given no intimation that the Leopard Men suspected that he had
stolen the white priestess, yet there was always danger that Gato
Mgungu might lead an expedition against him.</p>

<p>When the leading canoe came close to where The Kid stood,
several of the warriors in it recognized him, for he had been often
at the village of Bobolo; and soon he and his men were taken aboard
and paddled across to the opposite bank.</p>

<p>There was little ceremony shown him, for he was only a poor
elephant poacher with a miserable following of five Negroes; but
eventually Bobolo condescended to receive him; and he was led to
the chief's hut, where Bobolo and Sobito, with several of the
village elders, were seated in the shade.</p>

<p>The Kid's friendly greeting was answered with a surly nod. "What
does the white man want?" demanded Bobolo.</p>

<p>The youth was quick to discern the altered attitude of the
chief; before, he had always been friendly. He did not relish the
implied discourtesy of the chief's salutation, the omission of the
deferential bwana; but what was he to do? He fully realized his own
impotency, and though it galled him to do so he was forced to
overlook the insulting inflection that Bobolo had given the words
"white man."</p>

<p>"I have come to get you to help me find my friend, the old
bwana," he said. "My boys say that he went into the village of Gato
Mgungu, but that he never came out."</p>

<p>"Why do you come to me, then," demanded Bobolo; "why do you not
go to Gato Mgungu?"</p>

<p>"Because you are our friend," replied The Kid; "I believed that
you would help me."</p>

<p>"How can I help you? I know nothing about your friend."</p>

<p>"You can send men with me to the village of Gato Mgungu,"
replied The Kid, "while I demand the release of the old bwana."</p>

<p>"What will you pay me?" asked Bobolo.</p>

<p>"I can pay you nothing now. When we get ivory I will pay."</p>

<p>Bobolo sneered. "I have no men to send with you," he said. "You
come to a great chief and bring no presents; you ask him to give
you warriors and you have nothing to pay for them."</p>

<p>The Kid lost his temper. "You lousy old scoundrel!" he
exclaimed. "You can't talk that way to me and get away with it.
I'll give you until tomorrow morning to come to your senses." He
turned on his heel and walked down the village street, followed by
his five retainers; then he heard Bobolo yelling excitedly to his
men to seize him. Instantly the youth realized the predicament in
which his hot temper had placed him. He thought quickly, and before
the warriors had an opportunity to arrest him he turned back toward
Bobolo's hut.</p>

<p>"And another thing," he said as he stood again before the chief;
"I have already dispatched a messenger down river to the station
telling them about this affair and my suspicions. I told them that
I would be here waiting for them when they came with soldiers. If
you are thinking of harming me, Bobolo, be sure that you have a
good story ready, for I told them that I was particularly
suspicious of you."</p>

<p>He waited for no reply, but turned again and walked toward the
village gate, nor was any hand raised to stay him. He grinned to
himself as he passed out of the village, for he had sent no
messenger, and no soldiers were coming.</p>

<p>As a gesture of contempt for the threats of Bobolo, The Kid made
camp close to the village; but his men were not a little perturbed.
Some of the villagers came out with food, and from his almost
exhausted stores the white extracted enough cloth to purchase a
day's rations for himself and his men. Among his callers was a girl
whom he had known for some time. She was a happy, good-natured
creature; and The Kid had found amusement in talking to her. In the
past he had given her little presents, which pleased her simple
heart, as did the extravagant compliments that The Kid amused
himself by paying her.</p>

<p>Bring a girl presents often and tell her that she is the most
beautiful girl in the village, and you may be laying the foundation
for something unpleasant in the future. You may be joking, but the
girl may be in earnest. This one was. That she had fallen in love
with The Kid should have worked to his detriment as a punishment
for his thoughtlessness, but it did not.</p>

<p>At dusk the girl returned, sneaking stealthily through the
shadows. The Kid was startled by her abrupt appearance before his
tent, where he sat smoking.</p>

<p>"Hello there, Nsenene!" he exclaimed. "What brings you here?" He
was suddenly impressed by the usually grave demeanor of the girl
and her evident excitement.</p>

<p>"Hush!" cautioned the girl. "Do not speak my name. They would
kill me if they knew I had come here."</p>

<p>"What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Much is wrong. Bobolo is going to send men with you tomorrow.
He will tell you that they are going to the village of Gato Mgungu
with you, but they will not. When they get you out in the river,
out of sight of the village, they will kill you and all your men
and throw you to the crocodiles. Then when the white men come, they
will tell them that they left you at the village of Gato Mgungu;
and the white men will go and they will find no village, because it
has been burned by the Utengas. There will be no one there to tell
them that Bobolo lied."</p>

<p>"Gato Mgungu's village burned! What became of the old
bwana?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about him, but he is not at the village of Gato
Mgungu, because there is no village there. I think he is dead. I
heard it said that the Leopard Men killed him. Bobolo is afraid of
the Leopard Men because he stole their white priestess from
them."</p>

<p>"White priestess! What do you mean?" demanded The Kid.</p>

<p>"They had a white priestess. I saw her here when Bobolo brought
her to be his wife, but Ubooga would not have her around and made
Bobolo send her away. She was a white woman, very white, with hair
the color of the moon."</p>

<p>"When was this?" demanded the astonished youth.</p>

<p>"Three days ago, maybe four days. I do not remember."</p>

<p>"Where is she now? I should like to see her."</p>

<p>"You will never see her," replied Nsenene; "no one will ever see
her."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because they sent her to the village of the little men."</p>

<p>"You mean the Betetes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the Betetes. They are eaters of men."</p>

<p>"Where is their village?" asked The Kid.</p>

<p>"You want to go there and get the white woman?" demanded Nsenene
suspiciously.</p>

<p>There was something in the way the girl asked the question that
gave The Kid his first intimation that her interest was prompted by
more than friendship for him, for there was an unquestionable tinge
of jealous suspicion in her tone. He leaned forward with a finger
on his lips. "Don't tell anybody, Nsenene," he cautioned in a
whisper; "but the white woman is my sister. I must go to her
rescue. Now tell me where the village is, and next time I come I'll
bring you a fine present." If he had felt any compunction about
lying to the girl, which he did not, he could easily have salved
his conscience with the knowledge that he had done it in a good
cause; for if there was any truth in the story of the white
priestess, captive of the Betetes, then there was but one course of
procedure possible for him, the only white man in the district who
had knowledge of her predicament. He had thought of saying that the
woman was his mother or daughter, but had compromised on sister as
appearing more reasonable.</p>

<p>"Your sister!" exclaimed Nsenene. "Yes, now that I remember, she
looked like you. Her eyes and her nose were like yours."</p>

<p>The Kid suppressed a smile. Suggestion and imagination were
potent powers. "We do look alike," he admitted; "but tell me, where
is the village?"</p>

<p>As well as she could Nsenene described the location of the
village of Rebega. "I will go with you, if you will take me," she
suggested. "I do not wish to stay here any longer. My father is
going to sell me to an old man whom I do not like. I will go with
you and cook for you. I will cook for you until I die."</p>

<p>"I cannot take you now," replied The Kid. "Maybe some other
time, but this time there may be fighting."</p>

<p>"Some other time then," said the girl. "Now I must go back to
the village before they close the gates."</p>

<p>At the first break of dawn, The Kid set out in search of the
village of Rebega. He told his men that he had given up the idea of
going to the village of Gato Mgungu, but that while they were here
he was going to look for ivory on this side of the river. If he had
told them the truth, they would not have accompanied him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22">XXII. &mdash; IN THE CRUCIBLE OF
DANGER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">FOR a long time Old Timer and the girl walked on
in silence. There were no more interchanges of friendly
conversation. The atmosphere was frigid. Kali Bwana walked a little
behind the man. Often her eyes were upon him. She was thinking
seriously, but what her thoughts were she did not reveal.</p>

<p>When they came to a pleasant open stretch through which a small
stream wound, Old Timer stopped beneath a great tree that grew upon
the bank of the stream. "We shall remain here for a while," he
said.</p>

<p>The girl made no comment, and he did not look at her but started
at once to make camp. First he gathered dead branches of suitable
size, for a shelter, cutting a few green ones to give it greater
strength. These he formed into a frame-work resembling that of an
Indian wickiup, covering the whole with leafy branches and
grasses.</p>

<p>While he worked, the girl assisted him, following his example
without asking for directions. Thus they worked in silence. When
the shelter was finished he gathered wood for a fire. In this work
she helped him, too.</p>

<p>"We shall be on short rations," he said, "until I can make a bow
and some arrows."</p>

<p>This elicited no response from the girl; and he went his way,
searching for suitable material for his weapon. He never went far,
never out of sight of the camp; and presently he was back again
with the best that he could find. With his knife he shaped a bow,
rough but practical; and then he strung it with the pliable stem of
a slender creeper that he had seen natives use for the same purpose
in an emergency. This done, he commenced to make arrows. He worked
rapidly, and the girl noticed the deftness of his strong fingers.
Sometimes she watched his face, but on the few occasions that he
chanced to look up she had quickly turned her eyes away before he
could catch them upon him.</p>

<p>There were other eyes watching them from the edge of a bit of
jungle farther up the stream, close-set, red-rimmed, savage eyes
beneath beetling brows; but neither of them was aware of this; and
the man continued his work, and the girl continued to study his
face contemplatively. She still felt his arms about her; his lips
were still hot upon hers. How strong he was! She had felt in that
brief moment that he could have crushed her like an egg shell, and
yet in spite of his savage impulsiveness he had been tender and
gentle.</p>

<p>But these thoughts she tried to put from her and remember only
that he was a boor and a cad. She scanned his clothing that now no
longer bore even a resemblance to clothing, being nothing but a
series of rags held together by a few shreds and the hand of
Providence. What a creature to dare take her in his arms! What a
thing to dare kiss her! She flushed anew at the recollection. Then
she let her eyes wander again to his face. She tried to see only
the unkempt beard, but through it her eyes persisted in seeing the
contours of his fine features. She became almost angry with herself
and turned her eyes away that she might not longer entertain this
line of thought; and as she did so she stifled a scream and leaped
to her feet.</p>

<p>"God!" she cried; "look!"</p>

<p>At her first cry the man raised his eyes. Then he, too, leaped
to his feet. "Run!" he cried to the girl. "For God's sake, Kali,
run!"</p>

<p>But she did not run. She stood there waiting, in her hand the
futile staff he had cut for her that she had seized as she leaped
to her feet; and the man waited, his heavier cudgel ready in his
hand.</p>

<p>Almost upon them, rolling toward them in his awkward gait, was
an enormous bull ape, the largest that Old Timer had ever seen. The
man glanced quickly sideways and was horrified to see the girl
still standing there near him.</p>

<p>"Please run away, Kali," he implored. "I cannot stop him; but I
can delay him, and you must get away before he can get you. Don't
you understand, Kali? It is you he wants." But the girl did not
move, and the great beast was advancing steadily. "Please!" begged
the man.</p>

<p>"You did not run away when I was in danger," she reminded
him.</p>

<p>He started to reply; but the words were never spoken, for it was
then that the ape charged. Old Timer struck with his club, and the
girl rushed in and struck with hers. Utter futility! The beast
grasped the man's weapon, tore it from his hand, and flung it
aside. With his other hand he sent Kali Bwana spinning with a blow
that might have felled an ox had not the man broken its force by
seizing the shaggy arm; then he picked Old Timer up as one might a
rag doll and rolled off toward the jungle.</p>

<p>When the girl, still half dazed from the effect of the blow,
staggered to her feet she was alone; the man and the beast had
disappeared. She called aloud, but there was no reply. She thought
that she had been unconscious, but she did not know; so she could
not know how long it had been since the beast had carried the man
away. She tried to follow, but she did not know in which direction
they had gone; she would have followed and fought for the
man&mdash;her man. The words formed in her mind and brought no
revulsion of feeling. Had he not called her "my Kali"&mdash;my
woman?</p>

<p>What a change this brief episode had wrought in her!</p>

<p>A moment before, she had been trying to hate him, trying to seek
out everything disgusting about him&mdash;his rags, his beard, the
dirt upon him. Now she would have given a world to have him back,
nor was it alone because she craved protection. This she realized.
Perhaps she realized the truth, too; but if she did she was not
ashamed. She loved him, loved this nameless man of rags and
tatters.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Tarzan of the Apes stoically awaited his fate,
whatever it might be. He neither wasted his strength in useless
efforts to break bonds that he had found unbreakable, nor
dissipated his nervous energy in futile repining. He merely lay
still. Nkima squatted dejectedly beside him. There was always
something wrong with the world; so Nkima should have been
accustomed to that, but he liked to feel sorry for himself. Today
he was in his prime; he could scarcely have been more miserable if
Sheeta had been pursuing him.</p>

<p>The afternoon was waning as Tarzan's keen ears caught the sound
of approaching footsteps. He heard them before either Nkima or the
great apes heard them, and he voiced a low growl that apprised the
others. Instantly the great, shaggy beasts were alert. The shes and
the balus gathered nearer the bulls; all listened in absolute
silence. They sniffed the air; but the wind blew from them toward
whatever was approaching, so that they could detect no revealing
spoor. The bulls were nervous; they were prepared either for
instant battle or for flight.</p>

<p>Silently, notwithstanding its great weight, a mighty figure
emerged from the forest. It was Ga-yat. Under one arm he carried a
man-thing. Zu-tho growled. He could see Ga-yat; but he could not
smell him, and one knows that one's eyes and ears may deceive one,
but never one's nose. "I am Zu-tho," he growled, baring his great
fighting fangs. "I kill!"</p>
<a id="pic13" name="pic13"></a><br>

<div align="center"><img src=
"0500201h-images/TarzanAndTheLeopardMen-05.jpg" alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Ga-yat emerged from the forest.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"I am Ga-yat," answered the other, as he lumbered toward
Tarzan.</p>

<p>Presently the others caught his scent spoor and were satisfied,
but the scent of the man-thing annoyed and angered them. They came
forward, growling. "Kill the Tarmangani!" was on the lips of
many.</p>

<p>Ga-yat carried Old Timer to where Tarzan lay and threw him
unceremoniously to the ground. "I am Ga-yat," he said; "here is a
Tarmangani. Ga-yat saw no Gomangani."</p>

<p>The other bulls were crowding close, anxious to fall upon the
man-thing. Old Timer had never seen such a concourse of great apes,
had never known that they grew so large. It was evident that they
were not gorillas, and they were more man-like than any apes he had
seen. He recalled the stories that natives had told of these hairy
men of the forest, stories that he had not believed. He saw the
white man lying bound and helpless among them, but at first he did
not recognize him. He thought that he, too, was a prisoner of these
man-like brutes. What terrible creatures they were! He was thankful
that his captor had taken him rather than Kali. Poor Kali! What
would become of her now?</p>

<p>The bulls were pressing closer. Their intentions were evident
even to the man. He thought the end was near. Then, to his
astonishment, he heard savage growls burst from the lips of the man
near him, saw his lip curl upward, revealing strong, white
teeth.</p>

<p>"The Tarmangani belongs to Tarzan," growled the apeman. "Do not
harm that which is Tarzan's."</p>

<p>Ga-yat and Zu-tho turned upon the other bulls and drove them
back, while Old Timer looked on in wide-eyed astonishment. He had
not understood what Tarzan said; he could scarcely believe that he
had communicated with the apes, yet the evidence was such that he
was convinced of it against his better judgment. He lay staring at
the huge, hairy creatures moving slowly away from him; even they
seemed unreal.</p>

<p>"You are no sooner out of one difficulty than you find yourself
in another," said a deep, low voice in English.</p>

<p>Old Timer turned his eyes toward the speaker. The voice was
familiar. Now he recognized him. "You are the man who got me out of
that mess in the temple!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"And now I am in a mess," said the other.</p>

<p>"Both of us," added Old Timer. "What do you suppose they will do
with us?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied the ape-man.</p>

<p>"Then why did they bring me here?"</p>

<p>"I told one of them to go and get me a man," replied Tarzan.
"Evidently you chanced to be the first man he came upon. I did not
expect a white man."</p>

<p>"You sent that big brute that got me? They do what you ask? Who
are you, and why did you send for a man?"</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan of the Apes, and I wanted someone who could untwist
these wires that are around my wrists; neither the apes nor Nkima
could do it."</p>

<p>"Tarzan of the Apes!" exclaimed Old Timer. "I thought you were
only a part of the folklore of the natives." As he spoke he started
to work on the wires that confined the apeman's wrists&mdash;copper
wires that untwisted easily.</p>

<p>"What became of the white girl?" asked the latter. "You got her
out of the Betete village, but I couldn't follow you because the
little devils got me."</p>

<p>"You were there! Ah, now I see; it was you who shot the
arrows."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How did they get you, and how did you get away from them?"</p>

<p>"I was in a tree above them. The branch broke. I was stunned for
a moment. Then they bound me."</p>

<p>"That was the crash I heard as I was leaving the village."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," agreed the ape-man. "I called the great apes," he
continued, "and they came and carried me here. Where is the white
girl?"</p>

<p>"She and I were on our way toward my camp when the ape got me,"
explained Old Timer. "She is alone back there now. When I get these
wires off, may I go back to her?"</p>

<p>"I shall go with you. Where was the place? Do you think you can
find it?"</p>

<p>"It cannot be far, not more than a few miles, yet I may not be
able to find it."</p>

<p>"I can," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"How?" inquired Old Timer.</p>

<p>"By Ga-yat's spoor. It is still fresh."</p>

<p>The white man nodded, but he was not convinced. He thought it
would be a slow procedure picking out the footprints of the beast
all the way back to the spot at which he had been seized. He had
removed the wires from Tarzan's wrists and was working upon those
of his ankles; a moment later the ape-man was free. He leaped to
his feet.</p>

<p>"Come!" he directed and started at a trot toward the spot at
which Ga-yat had emerged from the jungle.</p>

<p>Old Timer tried to keep up with him, but discovered that he was
weak from hunger and exhaustion. "You go ahead," he called to the
ape-man. "I cannot keep up with you, and we can't waste any time.
She is there alone."</p>

<p>"If I leave you, you will get lost," objected Tarzan. "Wait, I
have it!" He called to Nkima, who was swinging through the trees
above them, and the monkey dropped to his shoulder. "Stay near the
Tarmangani," he directed, "and show him the trail that Tarzan
follows."</p>

<p>Nkima objected; he was not interested in the Tarmangani, but at
last he understood that he must do as Tarzan wished. Old Timer
watched them chattering to one another. It seemed incredible that
they were conversing, yet the illusion was perfect.</p>

<p>"Follow Nkima," said Tarzan; "he will guide you in the right
direction." Then he was off at a swinging trot along a track that
Old Timer could not see.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Kali Bwana was stunned by the hopelessness of her
position. After the brief sense of security she had enjoyed since
the man had taken her from the village of the pygmies her present
situation seemed unbearable by contrast, and in addition she had
suffered a personal loss. To the burden of her danger was added
grief.</p>

<p>She gazed at the crude shelter he had built for her, and two
tears rolled down her cheeks. She picked up the bow he had made and
pressed her lips against the insensate wood. She knew that she
would never see him again, and the thought brought a choking sob to
her throat. It had been long since Kali Bwana had wept. In the face
of privation, adversity, and danger she had been brave; but now she
crept into the shelter and gave herself over to uncontrolled
grief.</p>

<p>What a mess she had made of everything! Thus ran her thoughts.
Her ill-conceived search for Jerry had ended in failure; but worse,
it had embroiled a total stranger and led him to his death, nor was
he the first to die because of her. There had been the faithful
Andereya, whom the Leopard Men had killed when they captured her;
and there had been Wlala, and Rebega, and his three
warriors&mdash;all these lives snuffed out because of her stubborn
refusal to understand her own limitations. The white officers and
civilians along the lower stretch of the river had tried to
convince her, but she had refused to listen. She had had her own
way, but at what price! She was paying now in misery and
remorse.</p>

<p>For some time she lay there, a victim of vain regrets; and then
she realized the futility of repining, and by an effort of the will
seized control of her shaken nerves. She told herself that she must
not give up, that even this last, terrible blow must not stop her.
She still lived, and she had not found Jerry. She would go on. She
would try to reach the river; she would try in some way to cross
it, and she would find Old Timer's camp and enlist the aid of his
partner. But she must have food, strength- giving flesh. She could
not carry on in her weakened condition. The bow that he had made,
and that she had hugged to her breast as she lay in the shelter,
would furnish her the means to secure meat; and with this thought
in mind she arose and went out to gather up the arrows. It was
still not too late to hunt.</p>

<p>As she emerged from the frail hut she saw one of the creatures
that she had long feared inwardly, knowing that this forest
abounded in them&mdash;a leopard. The beast was standing at the
edge of the jungle looking toward her. As its yellow eyes
discovered her, it dropped to its belly, its face grimacing in a
horrid snarl. Then it started to creep cautiously toward her, its
tail weaving sinuously. It could have charged and destroyed her
without these preliminaries; but it seemed to be playing with her,
as a cat plays with a mouse.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer it came. The girl fitted an arrow to the bow.
She knew how futile a gesture it would be to launch that tiny
missile at this great engine of destruction; but she was
courageous, and she would not give up her life without defending it
to the last.</p>

<p>The beast was coming closer. She wondered when it would charge.
Many things passed through her mind, but clear and outstanding
above all the rest was the image of a man in rags and tatters.
Then, beyond the leopard, she saw a figure emerge from the
jungle&mdash;a giant white man, naked but for a loin cloth.</p>

<p>He did not hesitate. She saw him running quickly forward toward
the leopard; and she saw that the beast did not see him, for its
eyes were upon her. The man made no sound as he sprang lightly
across the soft turf. Suddenly, to her horror, she saw that he was
unarmed.</p>

<p>The leopard raised its body a little from the ground. It
gathered its hind feet beneath it. It was about to start the swift
rush that would end in death for her. Then she saw the running man
launch himself through the air straight for the back of the grim
beast. She wanted to close her eyes to shut out the horrid scene
that she knew must ensue as the leopard turned and tore his rash
antagonist to ribbons.</p>

<p>What followed after the bronzed body of the white man closed
with that of the great cat defied her astonished eyes to follow.
There was a swift intermingling of spotted hide and bronzed skin,
of arms and legs, of talons and teeth; and above all rose the
hideous growls of two blood-mad beasts. To her horror she realized
that not the cat alone was the author of them; the growls of the
man were as savage as those of the beast.</p>

<p>From the midst of the whirling mass she saw the man suddenly
rise to his feet, dragging the leopard with him. His powerful
fingers encircled the throat of the carnivore from behind. The
beast struck and struggled to free itself from that grip of death,
but no longer did it growl. Slowly its struggles lessened in
violence, and at last it went limp; then the man released one hand
and twisted its neck until the vertebrae snapped, after which he
cast the carcass to the ground. For a moment he stood over it. He
seemed to have forgotten the girl; then he placed a foot upon it,
and the forest reechoed to the victory cry of the bull ape.</p>

<p>Kali Bwana shuddered. She felt her flesh turn cold. She thought
to flee from this terrible wild man of the forest; then he turned
toward her, and she knew that it was too late. She still held the
bow and arrow ready in her hands. She wondered if she could hold
him off with these. He did not appear an easy man to frighten.</p>

<p>Then he spoke to her. "I seem to have arrived just in time," he
said quietly. "Your friend will be here presently," he added, for
he saw that she was afraid of him. That one should fear him was no
new thing to Tarzan of the Apes. There were many who had feared
him, and perhaps for this reason he had come to expect it from
every stranger. "You may put down your bow. I shall not harm
you."</p>

<p>She lowered the weapon to her side. "My friend!" she repeated.
"Who? Whom do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I do not know his name. Have you many friends here?"</p>

<p>"Only one, but I thought him dead. A huge ape carried him
away."</p>

<p>"He is safe," the ape-man assured her. "He is following behind
me."</p>

<p>Kali Bwana sank limply to the ground. "Thank God!" she
murmured.</p>

<p>Tarzan stood with folded arms watching her. How small and
delicate she looked! He wondered that she had been able to survive
all that she had passed through. The Lord of the Jungle admired
courage, and he knew what courage this slender girl must possess to
have undergone what she had undergone and still be able to face a
charging leopard with that puny weapon lying on the grass beside
her.</p>

<p>Presently he heard some one approaching and knew it was the man.
When he appeared he was breathing hard from his exertion, but at
sight of the girl he ran forward. "You are all right?" he cried. He
had seen the dead leopard lying near her.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>To Tarzan, her manner seemed constrained, and so did that of the
man. He did not know what had passed between them just before they
had been separated. He could not guess what was in the heart of
each, nor could Old Timer guess what was in the heart of the girl.
Being a girl, now that the man was safe, she sought to hide her
true emotions from him. And Old Timer was ill at ease. Fresh in his
mind were the events of the afternoon; ringing in his ears her
bitter cry, "I hate you!"</p>

<p>Briefly he told her all that had occurred since the ape had
carried him away, and then they planned with Tarzan for the future.
He told them that he would remain with them until they had reached
the man's camp, or that he would accompany them down river to the
first station; but to Old Timer's surprise the girl said that she
would go to his camp and there attempt to organize a new safari,
either to accompany her down river or in the further prosecution of
her search for Jerry Jerome.</p>

<p>Before night fell Tarzan had brought meat to the camp, using the
bow and arrows that Old Timer had made, and the man and the girl
cooked theirs over a fire while the apeman sat apart tearing at the
raw flesh with his strong, white teeth. Little Nkima, perched upon
his shoulder, nodded sleepily.</p>

<h2><a name="chap23" id="chap23">XXIII. &mdash; CONVERGING
TRAILS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">EARLY the next morning they started for the river,
but they had not gone far when the wind veered into the north, and
Tarzan halted. His delicate nostrils questioned the tell-tale
breeze.</p>

<p>"There is a camp just ahead of us," he announced. "There are
white men in it."</p>

<p>Old Timer strained his eyes into the forest. "I can see
nothing," he said.</p>

<p>"Neither can I," admitted Tarzan; "but I have a nose."</p>

<p>"You can smell them?" asked Kali.</p>

<p>"Certainly, and because my nose tells me that there are white
men there I assume that it is a friendly camp; but we will have a
look at it before we go too close. Wait here."</p>

<p>He swung into the trees and was gone, leaving the man and the
girl alone together; yet neither spoke what was in their heart. The
constraint of yesterday still lay heavily upon him. He wanted to
ask her forgiveness for having taken her into his arms, for having
dared to kiss her. She wanted him to take her into his arms again
and kiss her. But they stood there in silence like two strangers
until Tarzan returned.</p>

<p>"They are all right," announced the ape-man. "It is a company of
soldiers with their white officers and one civilian. Come! They may
prove the solution of all your difficulties."</p>

<p>The soldiers were breaking camp as Tarzan and his companions
arrived. The surprised shouts of the black soldiers attracted the
attention of the white men&mdash;two officers and a
civilian&mdash;who came forward to meet them. As his eyes fell upon
the civilian, Old Timer voiced an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>"The Kid!" he exclaimed, and the girl brushed past him and ran
forward, a glad cry upon her lips.</p>

<p>"Jerry! Jerry!" she cried as she threw herself into The Kid's
arms.</p>

<p>Old Timer's heart sank. Jerry! Jerry Jerome, his best friend!
What cruel tricks fate can play.</p>

<p>When the greetings and the introductions were over, the strange
combination of circumstances that had brought them together thus
unexpectedly were explained as the story of each was unfolded.</p>

<p>"Not long ago," the lieutenant in command of the expedition
explained to Kali, "we heard rumors of the desertion of your men.
We arrested some of them in their villages and got the whole story.
Then I was ordered out to search for you. We had come as far as
Bobolo's yesterday when we got an inkling of your whereabouts from
a girl named Nsenene. We started for the Betete village at once and
met this young man wandering about, lost, just as we were going
into camp here. Now you have assured the success of my mission by
walking in on me this morning. There remains nothing now but to
take you back to civilization."</p>

<p>"There is one other thing that you can do while you are here,"
said Old Timer.</p>

<p>"'And that?" inquired the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"There are two known Leopard Men in the village of Bobolo. Three
of us have seen them in the temple of the Leopard God taking active
parts in the rites. If you wish to arrest them it will be
easy."</p>

<p>"I certainly do," replied the officer. "Do you know them by
sight?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely," stated Old Timer. "One of them is an old witch-
doctor named Sobito, and the other is Bobolo himself."</p>

<p>"Sobito!" exclaimed Tarzan. "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"He is the same man you carried away from the temple, the man
you called Sobito. I saw him drifting down the river in a canoe the
morning after I escaped."</p>

<p>"We shall arrest them both," said the officer, "and now as the
men are ready to march, we will be off."</p>

<p>"I shall leave you here," said the ape-man. "You are safe now,"
he added, turning to the girl. "Go out of the jungle with these men
and do not come back; it is no place for a white girl alone."</p>

<p>"Do not go yet," exclaimed the officer. "I shall need you to
identify Sobito."</p>

<p>"You will need no one to identify Sobito," replied the ape- man,
and swinging into a tree, he vanished from their sight.</p>

<p>"And that is that," commented The Kid.</p>

<p>On the march toward Bobolo's village the girl and The Kid walked
close together, while Old Timer followed dejectedly behind. Finally
The Kid turned and addressed him. "Come on up here, old man, and
join us; I was just telling Jessie about a strange coincidence in
something I said in Bobolo's village last night. There is a girl
there named Nsenene. You probably remember her, Old Timer. Well,
she told me about this white girl who was a captive in the pygmy
village; and when I showed interest in her and wanted to know where
the village was so that I could try to get the girl away from them,
the little rascal got jealous. I discovered that she had a crush on
me; so I had to think quickly to explain my interest in the white
girl, and the first thing that entered my head was to tell her that
the girl was my sister. Wasn't that a mighty strange
coincidence?"</p>

<p>"Where's the coincidence?" demanded Old Timer.</p>

<p>The Kid looked at him blankly. "Why, didn't you know," he
exclaimed. "Jessie is my sister."</p>

<p>Old Timer's jaw dropped. "Your sister!" Once again the sun shone
and the birds sang. "Why didn't you tell me you were looking for
your brother?" he demanded of Kali.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me that you knew Jerry Jerome?" she
countered.</p>

<p>"I didn't know that I knew him," he explained. "I never knew The
Kid's name. He didn't tell me and I never asked."</p>

<p>"There was a reason why I couldn't tell you," said The Kid; "but
it's all right now. Jessie just told me."</p>

<p>"You see,&mdash;" she hesitated.</p>

<p>"Hi," prompted Old Timer.</p>

<p>The girl smiled and flushed slightly. "You see, Hi," she
commenced again, "Jerry thought that he had killed a man. I am
going to tell you the whole story because you and he have been such
close friends.</p>

<p>"Jerry was in love with a girl in our town. He learned one night
that an older man, a man with a vile reputation, had enticed her to
his apartment. Jerry went there and broke in. The man was furious,
and in the fight that followed Jerry shot him. Then he took the
girl home, swearing her to secrecy about her part in the affair.
That same night he ran away, leaving a note saying that he had shot
Sam Berger, but giving no reason.</p>

<p>"Berger did not die and refused to prosecute; so the case was
dropped. We knew that Jerry had run away to save the girl from
notoriety, more than from fear of punishment; but we did not know
where he had gone. I didn't know where to look for him for a long
time.</p>

<p>"Then Berger was shot and killed by another girl, and in the
meantime I got a clue from an old school friend of Jerry's and knew
that he had come to Africa. Now there was absolutely no reason why
he should not return home; and I started out to look for him."</p>

<p>"And you found him," said Old Timer.</p>

<p>"I found something else," said the girl, but he did not catch
her meaning.</p>

<p>It was late when they arrived at the village of Bobolo, which
they found in a state of excitement. The officer marched his men
directly into the village and formed them so that they could
command any situation that might arise.</p>

<p>At sight of The Kid and Old Timer and the girl Bobolo appeared
frightened. He sought to escape from the village, but the soldiers
stopped him, and then the officer informed him that he was under
arrest. Bobolo did not ask why. He knew.</p>

<p>"Where is the witch-doctor called Sobito?" demanded the
officer.</p>

<p>Bobolo trembled. "He is gone," he said.</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded the officer.</p>

<p>"To Tumbai," replied Bobolo. "A little while ago a demon came
and carried him away. He dropped into the village from the sky and
took Sobito up in his arms as though he had no weight at all. Then
he cried, 'Sobito is going back to the village of Tumbai!', and he
ran through the gateway and was gone into the forest before anyone
could stop him."</p>

<p>"Did anyone try?" inquired Old Timer with a grin.</p>

<p>"No," admitted Bobolo. "Who could stop a spirit?"</p>

<p>The sun was sinking behind the western forest, its light playing
upon the surging current of the great river that rolled past the
village of Bobolo. A man and a woman stood looking out across the
water that was plunging westward in its long journey to the sea
down to the trading posts and the towns and the ships, which are
the frail links that connect the dark forest with civilization.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow you will start," said the man. "In six or eight weeks
you will be home. Home!" There was a world of wistfulness in the
simple, homely word. He sighed. "I am so glad for both of you."</p>

<p>She came closer to him and stood directly in front of him,
looking straight into his eyes. "You are coming with us," she
said.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because I love you, you will come."</p>
