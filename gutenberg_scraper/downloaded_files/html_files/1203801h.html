<p><br><br><b>Though</b> talk is a common habit and much enjoyed, those who try
to record it are aware that it runs hither and thither, seldom
sticks to the point, abounds in exaggeration and inaccuracy, and
has frequent stretches of extreme dullness. Thus when seven or
eight people dined together the other night the first ten minutes
went in saying how very difficult it is to get about London
nowadays; was it quicker to walk or to drive; did the new system
of coloured lights help or hinder? Just as dinner was announced,
somebody asked: "But when were picture galleries invented?", a
question naturally arising, for the discussion about the value of
coloured lights had led somebody to say that in the eyes of a
motorist red is not a colour but simply a danger signal. We shall
very soon lose our sense of colour, another added, exaggerating,
of course. Colours are used so much as signals now that they will
very soon suggest action merely&mdash;that is
the worst of living in a highly organized community. Other
instances of the change wrought upon our senses by modern
conditions were then cited; how buildings are changing their
character because no one can stand still to look at them; how
statues and mosaics removed from their old stations and confined
to the insides of churches and private houses lose the qualities
proper to them in the open air. This naturally led to the
question when picture galleries were first opened, and as no
precise answer was forthcoming the speaker went on to sketch a
fancy picture of an inventive youth having to wait his turn to
cross Ludgate Circus in the reign of Queen Anne. "Look," he said
to himself, "how the coaches cut across the corners! That poor
old boy," he said, "positively had to put his hand to his
pig-tail. Nobody any longer stops to look at St. Paul's. Soon all
these swinging signboards will be dismantled. Let me take time by
the forelock," he said, and, going to his bank, which was near at
hand, drew out what remained of his patrimony, and invested it in
a neat set of rooms in Bond Street, where he hung the first show
of pictures ever to be displayed to the public. Perhaps that
is the origin of the House of Agnews; perhaps their gallery
stands on the site of the house that was leased, so foreseeingly,
by the young man over two hundred years ago. Perhaps, said the
others; but nobody troubled to verify the statement, for it was a
bitter cold night in December and the soup stood upon the
table.</p>
<p>In course of time the talk turned, as talk has a way of
turning, back on itself&mdash;to colour; how different people see
colour differently; how painters are affected by their place of
birth, whether in the blue South or the grey North; how colour
blazes, unrelated to any object, in the eyes of children; how
politicians and business men are blind, days spent in an office
leading to atrophy of the eye; and so, by contrast, to those
insects, said still to be found in the primeval forests of South
America, in whom the eye is so developed that they are all eye,
the body a tuft of feather, serving merely to connect the two
great chambers of vision. Somebody had met a man whose business
it was to explore the wilder parts of the world in search of
cactuses, and from him had heard of these insects who are born
with the flowers and die when the flowers fade. A hard-headed
man, used to roughing it in all parts of the world, yet there was
something moving to him in the sight of these little creatures
drinking crimson until they became crimson; then flitting on to
violet; then to a vivid green, and becoming for the moment the
thing they saw&mdash;red, green, blue, whatever the colour of the
flower might be. At the first breath of winter, he said, when the
flowers died, the life went out of them, and you might mistake
them as they lay on the grass for shrivelled air-balls. Were we
once insects like that, too, one of the diners asked; all eye? Do
we still preserve the capacity for drinking, eating, indeed
becoming colour furled up in us, waiting proper conditions to
develop? For as the rocks hide fossils, so we hide tigers,
baboons, and perhaps insects, under our coats and hats. On first
entering a picture gallery, whose stillness, warmth and seclusion
from the perils of the street reproduce the conditions of the
primeval forest, it often seems as if we reverted to the insect
stage of our long life.</p>
<p>"On first entering a picture gallery"&mdash;there was silence
for a moment. Many pictures were being shown in London at that
time. There was the famous Holbein; there were
pictures by Picasso and Matisse; young English painters were
holding an exhibition in Burlington Gardens, and there was a show
of Sickert's pictures at Agnews. When I first went into Sickert's
show, said one of the diners, I became completely and solely an
insect&mdash;all eye. I flew from colour to colour, from red to
blue, from yellow to green. Colours went spirally through my body
lighting a flare as if a rocket fell through the night and lit up
greens and browns, grass and trees, and there in the grass a
white bird. Colour warmed, thrilled, chafed, burnt, soothed, fed
and finally exhausted me. For though the life of colour is a
glorious life it is a short one. Soon the eye can hold no more;
it shuts itself in sleep, and if the man who looks for cactuses
had come by he would only have seen a shrivelled air-ball on a
red plush chair.</p>
<p>That is an exaggeration, a dramatization, the others said.
Nobody, who can walk down Bond Street in the year 1933, without
exciting suspicion in the heart of the policeman, can simplify
sufficiently to see colour only. One must be a fly in order to
die in aromatic pain. And it is many ages now since we lost
"the microscopic eye." Ages ago we left the forest and went into
the world, and the eye shrivelled and the heart grew, and the
liver and the intestines and the tongue and the hands and the
feet. Sickert's show proves the truth of that soon enough. Look
at his portraits: Charles Bradlaugh at the Bar of the House of
Commons; the Right Honourable Winston Churchill, M.P.;
Rear-Admiral Lumsden, C.I.E., C.V.O.; and Dr. Cobbledick. These
gentlemen are by no means simple flowers. In front of Sickert's
portraits of them we are reminded of all that we have done with
all our organs since we left the jungle. The face of a civilized
human being is a summing-up, an epitome of a million acts,
thoughts, statements and concealments. Yes, Sickert is a great
biographer, said one of them; when he paints a portrait I read a
life. Think of his picture of the disillusioned lady in full
evening-dress sitting on a balcony in Venice. She has seen every
sort of sunrise and sunset whether dressed in diamonds or white
night-gown; now all is ruin and shipwreck; and yet the tattered
ship in the background still floats. For though Sickert
is a realist he is by no means a pessimist ... Laughter drowned
the last words. The portrait of the lady on the balcony had
suggested nothing of the kind to most of the others. Had she
lovers or not&mdash;it did not matter; did the ship sail or did
it sink&mdash;they did not care. And they fetched a book of
photographs from Sickert's paintings and began cutting off a hand
or a head, and made them connect or separate, not as a hand or a
head but as if they had some quite different relationship.</p>
<p>Now they are going into the silent land; soon they will be out
of reach of the human voice, two of the diners said, watching
them. They are seeing things that we cannot see, just as a dog
bristles and whines in a dark lane when nothing is visible to
human eyes. They are making passes with their hands, to express
what they cannot say; what excites them in those photographs is
something so deeply sunk that they cannot put words to it. But
we, like most English people, have been trained not to see but to
talk. Yet it may be, they went on, that there is a zone of
silence in the middle of every art. The artists themselves live
in it. Coleridge could not explain <i>Kubla
Khan</i>&mdash;that he left to the critics. And those who are
almost on a par with the artists, like our friends who are
looking at the pictures, cannot impart what they feel when they
go beyond the outskirts. They can only open and shut their
fingers. We must resign ourselves to the fact that we are
outsiders, condemned for ever to haunt the borders and margins of
this great art. Nevertheless that is a region of very strong
sensations. First, on entering a picture gallery, the violent
rapture of colour; then, when we have soused our eyes
sufficiently in that, there is the complexity and intrigue of
character. I repeat, said one of them, that Sickert is among the
best of biographers. When he sits a man or woman down in front of
him he sees the whole of the life that has been lived to make
that face. There it is&mdash;stated. None of our biographers make
such complete and flawless statements. They are tripped up by
those miserable impediments called facts; was he born on such a
day; was his mother's name Jane or Mary; then the affair with the
barmaid has to be suppressed out of deference to family feeling;
and there is always, brooding over him with its dark
wings and hooked beak, the Law of Libel.
Hence the three or four hundred pages of compromise, evasion,
understatement, overstatement, irrelevance and downright
falsehood which we call biography. But Sickert takes his brush,
squeezes his tube, looks at the face; and then, cloaked in the
divine gift of silence, he paints&mdash;lies, paltriness,
splendour, depravity, endurance, beauty&mdash;it is all there and
nobody can say, But his mother's name was Jane not Mary. Not in
our time will anyone write a life as Sickert paints it. Words are
an impure medium; better far to have been born into the silent
kingdom of paint.</p>
<p>But to me Sickert always seems more of a novelist than a
biographer, said the other. He likes to set his characters in
motion, to watch them in action. As I remember it, his show was
full of pictures that might be stories, as indeed their names
suggest&mdash;<i>Rose et Marie</i>; <i>Christine buys a
house</i>; <i>A difficult moment</i>. The figures are motionless,
of course, but each has been seized in a moment of crisis; it is
difficult to look at them and not to invent a plot, to hear what
they are saying. You remember the picture of the old publican,
with his glass on the table before him and a cigar gone cold
at his lips, looking out of his shrewd little pig's eyes at the
intolerable wastes of desolation in front of him? A fat woman
lounges, her arm on a cheap yellow chest of drawers, behind him.
It is all over with them, one feels. The accumulated weariness of
innumerable days has discharged its burden on them. They are
buried under an avalanche of rubbish. In the street beneath, the
trams are squeaking, children are shrieking. Even now somebody is
tapping his glass impatiently on the bar counter. She will have
to bestir herself; to pull her heavy, indolent body together and
go and serve him. The grimness of that situation lies in the fact
that there is no crisis; dull minutes are mounting, old matches
are accumulating and dirty glasses and dead cigars; still on they
must go, up they must get.</p>
<p>And yet it is beautiful, said the other; satisfactory;
complete in some way. Perhaps it is the flash of the stuffed
birds in the glass case, or the relation of the chest of drawers
to the woman's body; anyhow, there is a quality in that picture
which makes me feel that though the publican is done for, and his
disillusion complete, still in the other world, of
which he is mysteriously a part without knowing it, beauty and
order prevail; all is right there&mdash;or does that convey
nothing to you? Perhaps that is one of the things that is better
said with a flick of the fingers, said the other. But let us go
on living in the world of words a little longer. Do you remember
the picture of the girl sitting on the edge of her bed half
naked? Perhaps it is called <i>Nuit d'Amour</i>. Anyhow, the
night is over. The bed, a cheap iron bed, is tousled and tumbled;
she has to face the day, to get her breakfast, to see about the
rent. As she sits there with her night-gown slipping from her
shoulders, just for a moment the truth of her life comes over
her; she sees in a flash the little garden in Wales and the
dripping tunnel in the Adelphi where she began, where she will
end, her days. So be it, she says, and yawns and shrugs and
stretches a hand for her stockings and chemise. Fate has willed
it so. Now a novelist who told that story would plunge&mdash;how
obviously&mdash;into the depths of sentimentality. How is he to
convey in words the mixture of innocence and sordidity, pity and
squalor? Sickert merely takes his brush and paints a
tender green light on the faded wallpaper. Light is beautiful
falling through green leaves. He has no need of explanation;
green is enough. Then again there is the story of Marie and
Rose&mdash;a grim, a complex, a moving and at the same time a
heartening and rousing story. Marie on the chair has been sobbing
out some piteous plaint of vows betrayed and hearts broken to the
woman in the crimson petticoat. "Don't be a damned fool, my
dear," says Rose, standing before her with her arms akimbo. "I
know all about it," she says, standing there in the intimacy of
undress, experienced, seasoned, a woman of the world. And Marie
looks up at her with all her illusions tearfully exposed and
receives the full impact of the other's knowledge, which,
however, perhaps because of the glow of the crimson petticoat,
does not altogether wither her. There is too much salt and savour
in it. She takes heart again. Down she trips past the one-eyed
char with a pail, out into the street, a wiser woman than she
went in. "So that's what life is," she says, brushing the tear
from her eye and hailing the omnibus. There are any number of
stories and three-volume novels in Sickert's exhibition.</p>

<p>But to what school of novelists does he belong? He is a
realist, of course, nearer to Dickens than to Meredith. He has
something in common with Balzac, Gissing and the earlier Arnold
Bennett. The life of the lower middle class interests him
most&mdash;of innkeepers, shopkeepers, music-hall actors and
actresses. He seems to care little for the life of the
aristocracy whether of birth or of intellect. The reason may be
that people who inherit beautiful things sit much more loosely to
their possessions than those who have bought them off barrows in
the street with money earned by their own hands. There is a gusto
in the spending of the poor; they are very close to what they
possess. Hence the intimacy that seems to exist in Sickert's
pictures between his people and their rooms. The bed, the chest
of drawers, the one picture and the vase on the mantelpiece are
all expressive of the owner. Merely by process of use and fitness
the cheap furniture has rubbed its varnish off; the grain shows
through; it has the expressive quality that expensive furniture
always lacks; one must call it beautiful, though outside the room
in which it plays its part it would be hideous in the extreme.
Diamonds and Sheraton tables never submit to use
like that. But whatever Sickert paints has to submit; it has to
lose its separateness; it has to compose part of his scene. He
chooses, therefore, the casual clothes of daily life that have
taken the shape of the body; the felt hat with one feather that a
girl has bought with sixpence off a barrow in Berwick Market. He
likes bodies that work, hands that work, faces that have been
lined and suppled and seamed by work, because, in working, people
take unconscious gestures, and their faces have the
expressiveness of unconsciousness&mdash;a look that the very
rich, the very beautiful and the very sophisticated seldom
possess. And of course Sickert composes his picture down to the
very castors on the chairs and the fire-irons in the grate just
as carefully as Turgenev, of whom he sometimes reminds me,
composes his scene.</p>
<p>There are many points one could argue in that statement, said
the other. But certainly it would seem to be true that Sickert is
the novelist of the middle class. At the same time, though he
prefers to paint people who use their hands rather than the
leisured, he never sinks below a certain level in the social
scale. Like most painters, he has a profound love
of the good things of life; well-cooked food, good wine, fine
cigars. His world abounds in richness and succulence and humour.
He could not draw breath in a starved, a stunted or a puritanical
universe. His people are always well fed in body and mind; they
excel in mother wit and shrewd knowledge of the world. Some of
their sayings are really a little broad; I have always wondered
that the censor has let them pass. There is always good company
in his pictures. Nothing could be more enjoyable than to sit
behind the shop with the French innkeeper&mdash;that formidable
man in the frock-coat whose name I forget. He would offer us a
very fine cigar; uncork a bottle kept for his private use; and
Madame would join us from the glass-case where she keeps
accounts, and we should sit and talk and sing songs and crack
jokes.</p>
<p>Yes, and in the middle of our songs we should look up and see
red-gold light dripping down into the green waters of the canal.
We should suddenly become aware of a grey church looming over us
and one pink cloud riding down the bosom of the west. We should
see it suddenly over the shoulders of the
innkeeper; and then we should go on talking. That is how Sickert
makes us aware of beauty&mdash;over the shoulders of the
innkeeper; for he is a true poet, of course, one in the long line
of English poets, and not the least. Think of his Venice, of his
landscapes; or of those pictures of music-halls, of circuses, of
street markets, where the acute drama of human character is cut
off; and we no longer make up stories but behold&mdash;is it too
much to say a vision? But it would be absurd to class Sickert
among the visionaries; he is not a rhapsodist; he does not gaze
into the sunset; he does not lead us down glorious vistas to blue
horizons and remote ecstasies. He is not a Shelley or a Blake. We
see his Venice from a little table on the Piazza, just as we are
lifting a glass to our lips. Then we go on talking. His paint has
a tangible quality; it is made not of air and star-dust but of
oil and earth. We long to lay hands on his clouds and his
pinnacles; to feel his columns round and his pillars hard beneath
our touch. One can almost hear his gold and red dripping with a
little splash into the waters of the canal. Moreover, human
nature is never exiled from his canvas&mdash;there is always a
woman with a parasol in the foreground, or a man selling cabbages
in the shadow of the arch. Even when he paints a formal
eighteenth-century town like Bath, he puts a great cart-wheel in
the middle of the road. And those long French streets of pale
pink and yellow stucco are all patched and peeled; a child's pink
frock hangs out to dry; there are marble-topped tables at the
corner. He never goes far from the sound of the human voice, from
the mobility and idiosyncrasy of the human figure. As a poet,
then, we must liken him to the poets who haunt taverns and sea
beaches where the fishermen are tumbling their silver catch into
wicker baskets. Crabbe, Wordsworth, Cowper are the names that
come to mind, the poets who have kept close to the earth, to the
house, to the sound of the natural human voice.</p>
<p>But here the speakers fell silent. Perhaps they were thinking
that there is a vast distance between any poem and any picture;
and that to compare them stretches words too far. At last, said
one of them, we have reached the edge where painting breaks off
and takes her way into the silent land. We shall have to set
foot there soon, and all our words will fold
their wings and sit huddled like rooks on the tops of the trees
in winter. But since we love words let us dally for a little on
the verge, said the other. Let us hold painting by the hand a
moment longer, for though they must part in the end, painting and
writing have much to tell each other; they have much in common.
The novelist after all wants to make us see. Gardens, rivers,
skies, clouds changing, the colour of a woman's dress, landscapes
that bask beneath lovers, twisted woods that people walk in when
they quarrel&mdash;novels are full of pictures like these. The
novelist is always saying to himself how can I bring the sun on
to my page? How can I show the night and the moon rising? And he
must often think that to describe a scene is the worst way to
show it. It must be done with one word, or with one word in
skilful contrast with another. For example, there is
Shakespeare's "Dear as the ruddy drops that visit this sad
heart." Does not "ruddy" shine out partly because "sad" comes
after it; does not "sad" convey to us a double sense of the gloom
of the mind and the dullness of colour? They both speak at once,
striking two notes to make one chord, stimulating the eye
of the mind and of the body. Then again there is Herrick's</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"More white than are the whitest creams,<br>
Or moonlight tinselling the streams."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where the word "tinselling" adds to the simplicity of "white"
the glittering, sequined, fluid look of moonlit water. It is a
very complex business, the mixing and marrying of words that goes
on, probably unconsciously, in the poet's mind to feed the
reader's eye. All great writers are great colourists, just as
they are musicians into the bargain; they always contrive to make
their scenes glow and darken and change to the eye. Each of
Shakespeare's plays has its dominant colour. And each writer
differs of course as a colourist. Pope has no great range of
colour; he is more draughtsman than colourist; clear washes of
indigo, discreet blacks and violets best suit his exquisite sharp
outlines&mdash;save that in the <i>Elegy to an Unfortunate
Lady</i> there is a mass of funeral black; and the great image of
the Eastern King glows, fantastically, if you like, dark crimson.
Keats uses colour lavishly, lusciously, like a Venetian. In
the <i>Eve of St. Agnes</i> he paints for
lines at a time, dipping his pen in mounds of pure reds and
blues. Tennyson on the other hand is never luscious; he uses the
hard brush and the pure bright tints of a miniature painter.
<i>The Princess</i> is illuminated like a monk's manuscript;
there are whole landscapes in the curves of the capital letters.
You almost need a magnifying glass to see the minuteness of the
detail.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, they agreed, the arts are closely united. What
poet sets pen to paper without first hearing a tune in his head?
And the prose-writer, though he makes believe to walk soberly, in
obedience to the voice of reason, excites us by perpetual changes
of rhythm following the emotions with which he deals. The best
critics, Dryden, Lamb, Hazlitt, were acutely aware of the mixture
of elements, and wrote of literature with music and painting in
their minds. Nowadays we are all so specialized that critics keep
their brains fixed to the print, which accounts for the starved
condition of criticism in our time, and the attenuated and
partial manner in which it deals with its subject.</p>
<p>But we have gossiped long enough, they said; it is
time to make an end. The silent land lies before us. We have come
within sight of it many times while we were talking; when, for
example, we said that Rose's red petticoat satisfied us; when we
said that the chest of drawers and the arm convinced us that all
was well with the world as a whole. Why did the red petticoat,
the yellow chest of drawers, make us feel something that had
nothing to do with the story? We could not say; we could not
express in words the effect of those combinations of line and
colour. And, thinking back over the show, we have to admit that
there is a great stretch of silent territory in Sickert's
pictures. Consider once more the picture of the music-hall. At
first it suggests the husky voice of Marie Lloyd singing a song
about the ruins that Cromwell knocked about a bit; then the song
dies away, and we see a scooped-out space filled curiously with
the curves of fiddles, bowler hats, and shirt fronts converging
into a pattern with a lemon-coloured splash in the centre. It is
extraordinarily satisfying. Yet the description is so formal, so
superficial, that we can hardly force our lips to frame it; while
the emotion is distinct, powerful and satisfactory.</p>

<p>Yes, said the other, it is not a description at all; it leaves
out the meaning. But what sort of meaning is that which cannot be
expressed in words? What is a picture when it has rid itself of
the companionship of language and of music? Let us ask the
critics.</p>
<p>But the critics were still talking with their fingers. They
were still bristling and shivering like dogs in dark lanes when
something passes that we cannot see.</p>
<p>They have gone much farther into the forest than we shall ever
go, said one of the talkers, sadly. We only catch a glimpse now
and then of what lives there; we try to describe it and we
cannot; and then it vanishes, and having seen it and lost it,
exhaustion and depression overcome us; we recognize the
limitations which Nature has put upon us, and so turn back to the
sunny margin where the arts flirt and joke and pay each other
compliments.</p>
<p>But do not let us fall into despair, said the other. I once
read a letter from Walter Sickert in which he said, "I have
always been a literary painter, thank goodness, like all the
decent painters." Perhaps then he would not altogether despise
us. When we talk of his biographies, his
novels, and his poems we may not be so foolish as it seems. Among
the many kinds of artists, it may be that there are some who are
hybrid. Some, that is to say, bore deeper and deeper into the
stuff of their own art; others are always making raids into the
lands of others. Sickert it may be is among the hybrids, the
raiders. His name itself suggests that he is of mixed birth. I
have read that he is part German, part English, part Scandinavian
perhaps; he was born in Munich, was educated at Reading, and
lived in France. What more likely than that his mind is also
cosmopolitan; that he sings a good song, writes a fine style, and
reads enormously in four or five different languages? All this
filters down into his brush. That is why he draws so many
different people to look at his pictures. From his photograph you
might take him for a highly distinguished lawyer with a nautical
bent; the sort of man who settles a complicated case at the Law
Courts, then changes into an old serge suit, pulls a yachting-cap
with a green peak over his eyes and buffets about the North Sea
with a volume of &AElig;schylus in his pocket. In the intervals
of hauling up and down the mainsail he wipes the salt
from his eyes, whips out a canvas and paints a divinely lovely
picture of Dieppe, Harwich, or the cliffs of Dover. That is the
sort of man I take Walter Sickert to be. You should call him
Richard Sickert, said the other&mdash;Richard Sickert, R.A. But
since he is probably the best painter now living in England,
whether he is called Richard or Walter, whether he has all the
letters in the alphabet after his name or none, scarcely matters.
