<h2><a id="daughter1" name="daughter1">CHAPTER I</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE tall Englishman, Pembroke, was scratching
lines on the earth with his hunting knife, talking in a jerky tone
that indicated suppressed excitement: "I tell you, Ormond, that
peak to the west is the one we were to look for. Here, I've marked
a map in the dirt. This mark here represents our camp, and this one
is the peak. We've marched north far enough. At this spot we should
turn westward&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" muttered Ormond. "Rub out that map. Here comes
Gordon."</p>

<p>Pembroke obliterated the faint lines with a quick sweep of his
open hand, and as he scrambled up he managed to shuffle his feet
across the spot. He and Ormond were laughing and talking easily as
the third man of the expedition came up.</p>

<p>Gordon was shorter than his companions, but his physique did not
suffer by comparison with either the rangy Pembroke or the more
closely knit Ormond. He was one of those rare individuals at once
lithe and compact. His strength did not give the impression of
being locked up within himself as is the case with so many strong
men. He moved with a flowing ease that advertised power more subtly
than does mere beefy bulk.</p>

<p>Though he was clad much like the two Englishmen except for an
Arab headdress, he fitted into the scene as they did not. He, an
American, seemed almost as much a part of these rugged uplands as
the wild nomads which pasture their sheep along the slopes of the
Hindu Kush. There was a certitude in his level gaze, and economy of
motion in his movements, that reflected kinship with the
wilderness.</p>

<p>"Pembroke and I were discussing that peak, Gordon," said Ormond,
indicating the mountain under discussion, which reared a snow cap
in the clear afternoon sky beyond a range of blue hills, hazy with
distance. "We were wondering if it had a name."</p>

<p>"Everything in these hills has a name," Gordon answered. "Some
of them don't appear on the maps, though. That peak is called Mount
Erlik Khan. Less than a dozen white men have seen it."</p>

<p>"Never heard of it," was Pembroke's comment. "If we weren't in
such a hurry to find poor old Reynolds, it might be fun having a
closer look at it, what?"</p>

<p>"If getting your belly ripped open can be called fun," returned
Gordon. "Erlik Khan's in Black Kirghiz country."</p>

<p>"Kirghiz? Heathens and devil worshipers? Sacred city of Yolgan
and all that rot."</p>

<p>"No rot about the devil worship," Gordon returned. "We're almost
on the borders of their country now. This is a sort of no man's
land here, squabbled over by the Kirghiz and Moslem nomads from
farther east. We've been lucky not to have met any of the former.
They're an isolated branch off the main stalk which centers about
Issik-kul, and they hate white men like poison.</p>

<p>"This is the closest point we approach their country. From now
on, as we travel north, we'll be swinging away from it. In another
week, at most, we ought to be in the territory of the Uzbek tribe
who you think captured your friend."</p>

<p>"I hope the old boy is still alive." Pembroke sighed.</p>

<p>"When you engaged me as Peshawar I told you I feared it was a
futile quest," said Gordon. "If that tribe did capture your friend,
the chances are all against his being still alive. I'm just warning
you, so you won't be too disappointed if we don't find him."</p>

<p>"We appreciate that, old man," returned Ormond. "We knew no one
but you could get us there with our heads still on our bally
shoulders."</p>

<p>"We're not there yet," remarked Gordon cryptically, shifting his
rifle under his arm. "I saw hangel sign before we went into camp,
and I'm going to see if I can bag one. I may not be back before
dark."</p>

<p>"Going afoot?" inquired Pembroke.</p>

<p>"Yes; if I get one I'll bring back a haunch for supper."</p>

<p>And with no further comment Gordon strode off down the rolling
slope, while the other men stared silently after him.</p>

<p>He seemed to melt rather than stride into the broad copse at the
foot of the slope. The men turned, still unspeaking, and glanced at
the servants going about their duties in the camp&mdash;four stolid
Pathans and a slender Punjabi Moslem who was Gordon's personal
servant.</p>

<p>The camp with its faded tents and tethered horses was the one
spot of sentient life in a scene so vast and broodingly silent that
it was almost daunting. To the south, stretched an unbroken rampart
of hills climbing up to snowy peaks. Far to the north rose another
more broken range.</p>

<p>Between those barriers lay a great expanse of rolling
table-land, broken by solitary peaks and lesser hill ranges, and
dotted thickly with copses of ash, birch, and larch. Now, in the
beginning of the short summer, the slopes were covered with tall
lush grass. But here no herds were watched by turbaned nomads and
that giant peak far to the southwest seemed somehow aware of that
fact. It brooded like a somber sentinel of the unknown.</p>

<p>"Come into my tent!"</p>

<p>Pembroke turned away quickly, motioning Ormond to follow.
Neither of them noticed the burning intensity with which the
Punjabi Ahmed stared after them. In the tent, the men sitting
facing each other across a small folding table, Pembroke took
pencil and paper and began tracing a duplicate of the map he had
scratched in the dirt.</p>

<p>"Reynolds has served his purpose, and so has Gordon," he said.
"It was a big risk bringing him, but he was the only man who could
get us safely through Afghanistan. The weight that American carries
with the Mohammedans is amazing. But it doesn't carry with the
Kirghiz, and beyond this point we don't need him.</p>

<p>"That's the peak the Tajik described, right enough, and he gave
it the same name Gordon called it. Using it as a guide, we can't
miss Yolgan. We head due west, bearing a little to the north of
Mount Erlik Khan. We don't need Gordon's guidance from now on, and
we won't need him going back, because we're returning by the way of
Kashmir, and we'll have a better safe-conduct even than he.
Question now is, how are we going to get rid of him?"</p>

<p>"That's easy," snapped Ormond; he was the harder-framed, the
more decisive, of the two. "We'll simply pick a quarrel with him
and refuse to continue in his company. He'll tell us to go to the
devil, take his confounded Punjabi, and head back for
Kabul&mdash;or maybe some other wilderness. He spends most of his
time wandering around countries that are taboo to most white
men."</p>

<p>"Good enough!" approved Pembroke. "We don't want to fight him.
He's too infernally quick with a gun. The Afghans call him 'El
Borak,' the Swift. I had something of the sort in mind when I
cooked up an excuse to halt here in the middle of the afternoon. I
recognized that peak, you see. We'll let him think we're going on
to the Uzbeks, alone, because, naturally, we don't want him to know
we're going to Yolgan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's that?" snapped Ormond suddenly, his hand closing on his
pistol butt.</p>

<p>In that instant, when his eyes narrowed and his nostrils
expanded, he looked almost like another man, as if suspicion
disclosed his true&mdash;and sinister&mdash;nature.</p>

<p>"Go on talking," he muttered. "Somebody's listening outside the
tent."</p>

<p>Pembroke obeyed, and Ormond, noiselessly pushing back his camp
chair, plunged suddenly out of the tent and fell on some one with a
snarl of gratification. An instant later he reentered, dragging the
Punjabi, Ahmed, with him. The slender Indian writhed vainly in the
Englishman's iron grip.</p>

<p>"This rat was eavesdropping," Ormond snarled.</p>

<p>"Now he'll spill everything to Gordon and there'll be a fight,
sure!" The prospect seemed to agitate Pembroke considerably.
"What'll we do now? What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>Ormond laughed savagely. "I haven't come this far to risk
getting a bullet in my guts and losing everything. I've killed men
for less than this."</p>

<p>Pembroke cried out an involuntary protest as Ormond's hand
dipped and the blue-gleaming gun came up. Ahmed screamed, and his
cry was drowned in the roar of the shot.</p>

<p>"Now we'll <i>have</i> to kill Gordon!"</p>

<p>Pembroke wiped his brow with a hand that shook a trifle. Outside
rose a sudden mutter of Pashto as the Pathan servants crowded
toward the tent.</p>

<p>"He's played into our hands!" rapped Ormond, shoving the still
smoking gun back into his holster. With his booted toe he stirred
the motionless body at his feet as casually as if it had been that
of a snake. "He's out on foot, with only a handful of cartridges.
It's just as well this turned out as it did."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Pembroke's wits seemed momentarily
muddled.</p>

<p>"We'll simply pack up and clear out. Let him try to follow us on
foot, if he wants to. There are limits to the abilities of every
man. Left in these mountains on foot, without food, blankets, or
ammunition, I don't think any white man will ever see Francis
Xavier Gordon alive again."</p>
<br>

<h2><a id="daughter2" name="daughter2">CHAPTER II</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Gordon left the camp he did not look behind
him. Any thoughts of treachery on the part of his companions was
furthest from his mind. He had no reason to suppose that they were
anything except what they had represented themselves to
be&mdash;white men taking a long chance to find a comrade the
unmapped solitudes had swallowed up.</p>

<p>It was an hour or so after leaving the camp when, skirting the
end of a grassy ridge, he sighted an antelope moving along the
fringe of a thicket. The wind, such as there was, was blowing
toward him, away from the animal. He began stalking it through the
thicket, when a movement in the bushes behind him brought him
around to the realization that he himself was being stalked.</p>

<p>He had a glimpse of a figure behind a clump of scrub, and then a
bullet fanned his ear, and he fired at the flash and the puff of
smoke. There was a thrashing among the foliage and then stillness.
A moment later he was bending over a picturesquely clad form on the
ground.</p>

<p>It was a lean, wiry man, young, with an ermine-edged
<i>khilat</i>, a fur <i>calpack</i>, and silver-heeled boots.
Sheathed knives were in his girdle, and a modern repeating rifle
lay near his hand. He had been shot through the heart.</p>

<p>"Turkoman," muttered Gordon. "Bandit, from his looks, out on a
lone scout. I wonder how far he's been trailing me."</p>

<p>He knew the presence of the man implied two things: somewhere in
the vicinity there was a band of Turkomans; and somewhere, probably
close by, there was a horse. A nomad never walked far, even when
stalking a victim. He glanced up at the rise which rolled up from
the copse. It was logical to believe that the Moslem had sighted
him from the crest of the low ridge, had tied his horse on the
other side, and glided down into the thicket to waylay him while he
stalked the antelope.</p>

<p>Gordon went up the slope warily, though he did not believe there
were any other tribesmen within earshot&mdash;else the reports of
the rifles would have brought them to the spot&mdash;and found the
horse without trouble. It was a Turkish stallion with a red leather
saddle with wide silver stirrups and a bridle heavy with goldwork.
A scimitar hung from the saddle peak in an ornamented leather
scabbard.</p>

<p>Swinging into the saddle, Gordon studied all quarters of the
compass from the summit of the ridge. In the south a faint ribbon
of smoke stood against the evening. His black eyes were keen as a
hawk's; not many could have distinguished that filmy blue feather
against the cerulean of the sky.</p>

<p>"Turkoman means bandits," he muttered. "Smoke means camp.
They're trailing us, sure as fate."</p>

<p>Reining about, he headed for the camp. His hunt had carried him
some miles east of the site, but he rode at a pace that ate up the
distance. It was not yet twilight when he halted in the fringe of
the larches and sat silently scanning the slope on which the camp
had stood. It was bare. There was no sign of tents, men, or
beasts.</p>

<p>His gaze sifted the surrounding ridges and clumps, but found
nothing to rouse his alert suspicion. At last he walked his steed
up the acclivity, carrying his rifle at the ready. He saw a smear
of blood on the ground where he knew Pembroke's tent had stood, but
there was no other sign of violence, and the grass was not trampled
as it would have been by a charge of wild horsemen.</p>

<p>He read the evidence of a swift but orderly exodus. His
companions had simply struck their tents, loaded the pack animals,
and departed. But why? Sight of distant horsemen might have
stampeded the white men, though neither had shown any sign of the
white feather before; but certainly Ahmed would not have deserted
his master and friend.</p>

<p>As he traced the course of the horses through the grass, his
puzzlement increased; they had gone westward.</p>

<p>Their avowed destination lay beyond those mountains in the
north. They knew that, as well as he. But there was no mistake
about it. For some reason, shortly after he had left camp, as he
read the signs, they had packed hurriedly and set off westward,
toward the forbidden country identified by Mount Erlik.</p>

<p>Thinking that possibly they had a logical reason for shifting
camp and had left him a note of some kind which he had failed to
find, Gordon rode back to the camp site and began casting about it
in an ever- widening circle, studying the ground. And presently he
saw sure signs that a heavy body had been dragged through the
grass.</p>

<p>Men and horses had almost obliterated the dim track, but for
years Gordon's life had depended upon the keenness of his
faculties. He remembered the smear of blood on the ground where
Pembroke's tent had stood.</p>

<p>He followed the crushed grass down the south slope and into a
thicket, and an instant later he was kneeling beside the body of a
man. It was Ahmed, and at first glance Gordon thought he was dead.
Then he saw that the Punjabi, though shot through the body and
undoubtedly dying, still had a faint spark of life in him.</p>

<p>He lifted the turbaned head and set his canteen to the blue
lips. Ahmed groaned, and into his glazed eyes came intelligence and
recognition.</p>

<p>"Who did this, Ahmed?" Gordon's voice grated with the
suppression of his emotions.</p>

<p>"Ormond Sahib," gasped the Punjabi. "I listened outside their
tent, because I feared they planned treachery to you. I never
trusted them. So they shot me and have gone away, leaving you to
die alone in the hills."</p>

<p>"But why?" Gordon was more mystified than ever.</p>

<p>"They go to Yolgan," panted Ahmed. "The Reynolds Sahib we sought
never existed. He was a lie they created to hoodwink you."</p>

<p>"Why to Yolgan?" asked Gordon.</p>

<p>But Ahmed's eyes dilated with the imminence of death; in a
racking convulsion he heaved up in Gordon's arms; then blood gushed
from his lips and he died.</p>

<p>Gordon rose, mechanically dusting his hands. Immobile as the
deserts he haunted, he was not prone to display his emotions. Now
he merely went about heaping stones over the body to make a cairn
that wolves and jackals could not tear into. Ahmed had been his
companion on many a dim road; less servant than friend.</p>

<p>But when he had lifted the last stone, Gordon climbed into the
saddle, and without a backward glance he rode westward. He was
alone in a savage country, without food or proper equipage. Chance
had given him a horse, and years of wandering on the raw edges of
the world had given him experience and a greater familiarity with
this unknown land than any other white man he knew. It was
conceivable that he might live to win his way through to some
civilized outpost.</p>

<p>But he did not even give that possibility a thought. Gordon's
ideas of obligation, of debt and payment, were as direct and
primitive as those of the barbarians among whom his lot had been
cast for so many years. Ahmed had been his friend and had died in
his service. Blood must pay for blood.</p>

<p>That was as certain in Gordon's mind as hunger is certain in the
mind of a gray timber wolf. He did not know why the killers were
going toward forbidden Yolgan, and he did not greatly care. His
task was to follow them to hell if necessary and exact full payment
for spilled blood. No other course suggested itself.</p>

<p>Darkness fell and the stars came out, but he did not slacken his
pace. Even by starlight it was not hard to follow the trail of the
caravan through the high grass. The Turkish horse proved a good one
and fairly fresh. He felt certain of overtaking the laden pack
ponies, in spite of their long start.</p>

<p>As the hours passed, however, he decided that the Englishmen
were determined to push on all night. They evidently meant to put
so much distance between them and himself that he could never catch
them, following on foot as they thought him to be. But why were
they so anxious to keep from him the truth of their
destination?</p>

<p>A sudden thought made his face grim, and after that he pushed
his mount a bit harder. His hand instinctively sought the hilt of
the broad scimitar slung from the high-peaked horn.</p>

<p>His gaze sought the white cap of Mount Erlik, ghostly in the
starlight, then swung to the point where he knew Yolgan lay. He had
been there before, himself, had heard the deep roar of the long
bronze trumpets that shaven-headed priests blow from the mountains
at sunrise.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when he sighted fires near the
willow-massed banks of a stream. At first glance he knew it was not
the camp of the men he followed. The fires were too many. It was an
<i>ordu</i> of the nomadic Kirghiz who roam the country between
Mount Erlik Khan and the loose boundaries of the Mohammedan tribes.
This camp lay full in the path of Yolgan and he wondered if the
Englishmen had known enough to avoid it. These fierce people hated
strangers. He himself, when he visited Yolgan, had accomplished the
feat disguised as a native.</p>

<p>Gaining the stream above the camp he moved closer, in the
shelter of the willows, until he could make out the dim shapes of
sentries on horseback in the light of the small fires. And he saw
something else&mdash;three white European tents inside the ring of
round, gray felt <i>kibitkas</i>. He swore silently; if the Black
Kirghiz had killed the white men, appropriating their belongings,
it meant the end of his vengeance. He moved nearer.</p>

<p>It was a suspicious, slinking, wolf-like dog that betrayed him.
Its frenzied clamor brought men swarming out of the felt tents, and
a swarm of mounted sentinels raced toward the spot, stringing bows
as they came.</p>

<p>Gordon had no wish to be filled with arrows as he ran. He
spurred out of the willows and was among the horsemen before they
were aware of him, slashing silently right and left with the
Turkish scimitar. Blades swung around him, but the men were more
confused than he. He felt his edge grate against steel and glance
down to split a broad skull; then he was through the cordon and
racing into deeper darkness while the demoralized pack howled
behind him.</p>

<p>A familiar voice shouting above the clamor told him that Ormond,
at least, was not dead. He glanced back to see a tall figure cross
the firelight and recognized Pembroke's rangy frame. The fire
gleamed on steel in his hands. That they were armed showed they
were not prisoners, though this forbearance on the part of the
fierce nomads was more than his store of Eastern lore could
explain.</p>

<p>The pursuers did not follow him far; drawing in under the
shadows of a thicket he heard them shouting gutturally to each
other as they rode back to the tent. There would be no more sleep
in that <i>ordu</i> that night. Men with naked steel in their hands
would pace their horses about the encampment until dawn. It would
be difficult to steal back for a long shot at his enemies. But now,
before he slew them, he wished to learn what took them to
Yolgan.</p>

<p>Absently his hand caressed the hawk-headed pommel of the
Turkoman scimitar. Then he turned again eastward and rode back
along the route he had come, as fast as he could push the wearying
horse. It was not yet dawn when he came upon what he had hoped to
find&mdash;a second camp, some ten miles west of the spot where
Ahmed had been killed; dying fires reflected on one small tent and
on the forms of men wrapped in cloaks on the ground.</p>

<p>He did not approach too near; when he could make out the lines
of slowly moving shapes that were picketed horses and could see
other shapes that were riders pacing about the camp, he drew back
behind a thicketed ridge, dismounted and unsaddled his horse.</p>

<p>While it eagerly cropped the fresh grass, he sat cross-legged
with his back to a tree trunk, his rifle across his knees, as
motionless as an image and as imbued with the vast patience of the
East as the eternal hills themselves.</p>
<br>

<h2><a id="daughter3" name="daughter3">CHAPTER III</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DAWN was little more than a hint of grayness in
the sky when the camp that Gordon watched was astir. Smoldering
coals leaped up into flames again, and the scent of mutton stew
filled the air. Wiry men in caps of Astrakhan fur and girdled
<i>caftans</i> swaggered among the horse lines or squatted beside
the cooking pots, questing after savory morsels with unwashed
fingers. There were no women among them and scant luggage. The
lightness with which they traveled could mean only one thing.</p>

<p>The sun was not yet up when they began saddling horses and
belting on weapons. Gordon chose that moment to appear, riding
leisurely down the ridge toward them.</p>

<p>A yell went up, and instantly a score of rifles covered him. The
very boldness of his action stayed their fingers on the triggers.
Gordon wasted no time, though he did not appear hurried. Their
chief had already mounted, and Gordon reined up almost beside him.
The Turkoman glared&mdash;a hawk-nosed, evil-eyed ruffian with a
henna-stained beard. Recognition grew like a red flame in his eyes,
and, seeing this, his warriors made no move.</p>

<p>"Yusef Khan," said Gordon, "you Sunnite dog, have I found you at
last?"</p>

<p>Yusef Khan plucked his red beard and snarled like a wolf. "Are
you mad, El Borak?"</p>

<p>"It is El Borak!" rose an excited murmur from the warriors, and
that gained Gordon another respite.</p>

<p>They crowded closer, their blood lust for the instant conquered
by their curiosity. El Borak was a name known from Istanbul to
Bhutan and repeated in a hundred wild tales wherever the wolves of
the desert gathered.</p>

<p>As for Yusef Khan, he was puzzled, and furtively eyed the slope
down which Gordon had ridden. He feared the white man's cunning
almost as much as he hated him, and in his suspicion, hate and fear
that he was in a trap, the Turkoman was as dangerous and uncertain
as a wounded cobra.</p>

<p>"What do you here?" he demanded. "Speak quickly, before my
warriors strip the skin from you a little at a time."</p>

<p>"I came following an old feud." Gordon had come down the ridge
with no set plan, but he was not surprised to find a personal enemy
leading the Turkomans. It was no unusual coincidence. Gordon had
blood-foes scattered all over Central Asia.</p>

<p>"You are a fool&mdash;"</p>

<p>In the midst of the chief's sentence Gordon leaned from his
saddle and struck Yusef Khan across the face with his open hand.
The blow cracked like a bull whip and Yusef reeled, almost losing
his seat. He howled like a wolf and clawed at his girdle, so
muddled with fury that he hesitated between knife and pistol.
Gordon could have shot him down while he fumbled, but that was not
the American's plan.</p>

<p>"Keep off!" he warned the warriors, yet not reaching for a
weapon. "I have no quarrel with you. This concerns only your chief
and me."</p>

<p>With another man that would have had no effect; but another man
would have been dead already. Even the wildest tribesman had a
vague feeling that the rules governing action against ordinary
<i>feringhi</i> did not apply to El Borak.</p>

<p>"Take him!" howled Yusef Khan. "He shall be flayed alive!"</p>

<p>They moved forward at that, and Gordon laughed unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"Torture will not wipe out the shame I have put upon your
chief," he taunted. "Men will say ye are led by a khan who bears
the mark of El Borak's hand in his beard. How is such shame to be
wiped out? Lo, he calls on his warriors to avenge him! Is Yusef
Khan a coward?"</p>

<p>They hesitated again and looked at their chief whose beard was
clotted with foam. They all knew that to wipe out such an insult
the aggressor must be slain by the victim in single combat. In that
wolf pack even a suspicion of cowardice was tantamount to a death
sentence.</p>

<p>If Yusef Khan failed to accept Gordon's challenge, his men might
obey him and torture the American to death at his pleasure, but
they would not forget, and from that moment he was doomed.</p>

<p>Yusef Khan knew this; knew that Gordon had tricked him into a
personal duel, but he was too drunk with fury to care. His eyes
were red as those of a rabid wolf, and he had forgotten his
suspicions that Gordon had riflemen hidden up on the ridge. He had
forgotten everything except his frenzied passion to wipe out
forever the glitter in those savage black eyes that mocked him.</p>

<p>"Dog!" he screamed, ripping out his broad scimitar. "Die at the
hands of a chief!"</p>

<p>He came like a typhoon, his cloak whipping out in the wind
behind him, his scimitar flaming above his head. Gordon met him in
the center of the space the warriors left suddenly clear.</p>

<p>Yusef Khan rode a magnificent horse as if it were part of him,
and it was fresh. But Gordon's mount had rested, and it was
well-trained in the game of war. Both horses responded instantly to
the will of their riders.</p>

<p>The fighters revolved about each other in swift curvets and
gambados, their blades flashing and grating without the slightest
pause, turned red by the rising sun. It was less like two men
fighting on horseback than like a pair of centaurs, half man and
half beast, striking for one another's life.</p>

<p>"Dog!" panted Yusef Khan, hacking and hewing like a man
possessed of devils. "I'll nail your head to my tent
pole&mdash;ahhhh!"</p>

<p>Not a dozen of the hundred men watching saw the stroke, except
as a dazzling flash of steel before their eyes, but all heard its
crunching impact. Yusef Khan's charger screamed and reared,
throwing a dead man from the saddle with a split skull.</p>

<p>A wordless wolfish yell that was neither anger nor applause went
up, and Gordon wheeled, whirling his scimitar about his head so
that the red drops flew in a shower.</p>

<p>"Yusef Khan is dead!" he roared. "Is there one to take up his
quarrel?"</p>

<p>They gaped at him, not sure of his intention, and before they
could recover from the surprise of seeing their invincible chief
fall, Gordon thrust his scimitar back in its sheath with a certain
air of finality and said:</p>

<p>"And now who will follow me to plunder greater than any of ye
ever dreamed?"</p>

<p>That struck an instant spark, but their eagerness was qualified
by suspicion.</p>

<p>"Show us!" demanded one. "Show us the plunder before we slay
thee."</p>

<p>Without answering, Gordon swung off his horse and cast the reins
to a mustached rider to hold, who was so astonished that he
accepted the indignity without protest. Gordon strode over to a
cooking pot, squatted beside it and began to eat ravenously. He had
not tasted food in many hours.</p>

<p>"Shall I show you the stars by daylight?" he demanded, scooping
out handfuls of stewed mutton, "Yet the stars are there, and men
see them in the proper time. If I had the loot would I come asking
you to share it? Neither of us can win it without the other's
aid."</p>

<p>"He lies," said one whom his comrades addressed as Uzun Beg.
"Let us slay him and continue to follow the caravan we have been
tracking."</p>

<p>"Who will lead you?" asked Gordon pointedly.</p>

<p>They scowled at him, and various ruffians who considered
themselves logical candidates glanced furtively at one another.
Then all looked back at Gordon, unconcernedly wolfing down mutton
stew five minutes after having slain the most dangerous swordsman
of the black tents.</p>

<p>His attitude of indifference deceived nobody. They knew he was
dangerous as a cobra that could strike like lightning in any
direction. They knew they could not kill him so quickly that he
would not kill some of them, and naturally none wanted to be first
to die.</p>

<p>That alone would not have stopped them. But that was combined
with curiosity, avarice roused by his mention of plunder, vague
suspicion that he would not have put himself in a trap unless he
held some sort of a winning hand, and jealousy of the leaders of
each other.</p>

<p>Uzun Beg, who had been examining Gordon's mount, exclaimed
angrily: "He rides Ali Khan's steed!"</p>

<p>"Aye," Gordon assented tranquilly. "Moreover this is Ali Khan's
sword. He fired at me from ambush, so he lies dead."</p>

<p>There was no answer. There was no feeling in that wolf pack
except fear and hate, and respect for courage, craft, and
ferocity.</p>

<p>"Where would you lead us?" demanded one named Orkhan Shan,
tacitly recognizing Gordon's dominance. "We be all free men and
sons of the sword."</p>

<p>"Ye be all sons of dogs," answered Gordon. "Men without grazing
lands or wives, outcasts, denied by thine own people&mdash;outlaws
whose lives are forfeit, and who must roam in the naked mountains.
You followed that dead dog without question. Now ye demand this and
that of me!"</p>

<p>Then ensued a medley of argument among themselves, in which
Gordon seemed to take no interest. All his attention was devoted to
the cooking pot. His attitude was no pose; without swagger or
conceit the man was so sure of himself that his bearing was no more
self-conscious among a hundred cutthroats hovering on the hair line
of murder than it would have been among friends.</p>

<p>Many eyes sought the gun butt at his hip. Men said his skill
with the weapon was sorcery; an ordinary revolver became in his
hand a living engine of destruction that was drawn and roaring
death before a man could realize that Gordon's hand had moved.</p>

<p>"Men say thou hast never broken thy word," suggested Orkhan.
"Swear to lead us to this plunder, and it may be we shall see."</p>

<p>"I swear no oaths," answered Gordon, rising and wiping his hands
on a saddle cloth. "I have spoken. It is enough. Follow me, and
many of you will die. Aye, the jackals will feed full. You will go
up to the paradise of the prophet and your brothers will forget
your names. But to those that live, wealth like the rain of Allah
will fall upon them."</p>

<p>"Enough of words!" exclaimed one greedily. "Lead us to this rare
loot."</p>

<p>"You dare not follow where I would lead," he answered. "It lies
in the land of the Kara Kirghiz."</p>

<p>"We dare, by Allah!" they barked angrily. "We are already in the
land of the Black Kirghiz, and we follow the caravan of some
infidels, whom, <i>inshallah</i>, we shall send to hell before
another sunrise."</p>

<p>"<i>Bismillah</i>," said Gordon. "Many of you shall eat arrows
and edged steel before our quest is over. But if you dare stake
your lives against plunder richer than the treasures of Hind, come
with me. We have far to ride."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the whole band was trotting westward. Gordon
led, with lean riders on either hand; their attitude suggested that
he was more prisoner than guide, but he was not perturbed. His
confidence in his destiny had again been justified, and the fact
that he had not the slightest idea of how to redeem his pledge
concerning treasure disturbed him not at all. A way would be opened
to him, somehow, and at present he did not even bother to consider
it.</p>
<br>

<h2><a id="daughter4" name="daughter4">CHAPTER IV</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE fact that Gordon knew the country better than
the Turkomans did aided him in his subtle policy to gain ascendency
over them. From giving suggestions to giving orders and being
obeyed is a short step, when delicately taken.</p>

<p>He took care that they kept below the sky lines as much as
possible. It was not easy to hide the progress of a hundred men
from the alert nomads; but these roamed far and there was a chance
that only the band he had seen were between him and Yolgan.</p>

<p>But Gordon doubted this when they crossed a track that had been
made since he rode eastward the night before. Many riders had
passed that point, and Gordon urged greater speed, knowing that if
they were spied by the Kirghiz instant pursuit was inevitable.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon they came in sight of the <i>ordu</i>
beside the willow-lined stream. Horses tended by youngsters grazed
near the camp, and farther away the riders watched the sheep which
browsed through the tall grass.</p>

<p>Gordon had left all his men except half a dozen in a
thicket-massed hollow behind the next ridge, and he now lay among a
cluster of boulders on a slope overlooking the valley. The
encampment was beneath him, distinct in every detail, and he
frowned. There was no sign of the white tents. The Englishmen had
been there. They were not there now. Had their hosts turned on them
at last, or had they continued alone toward Yolgan?</p>

<p>The Turkomans, who did not doubt that they were to attack and
loot their hereditary enemies, began to grow impatient.</p>

<p>"Their fighting men are less than ours," suggested Uzun Beg,
"and they are scattered, suspecting nothing. It is long since an
enemy invaded the land of the Black Kirghiz. Send back for the
others, and let us attack. You promised us plunder."</p>

<p>"Flat-faced women and fat-tailed sheep?" Gordon jeered.</p>

<p>"Some of the women are fair to look at," the Turkoman
maintained. "And we could feast full on the sheep. But these dogs
carry gold in their wagons to trade to merchants from Kashmir. It
comes from Mount Erlik Khan."</p>

<p>Gordon remembered that he had heard tales of a gold mine in
Mount Erlik before, and he had seen some crudely cast ingots the
owners of which swore they had them from the Black Kirghiz. But
gold did not interest him just then.</p>

<p>"That is a child's tale," he said, at least half believing what
he said. "The plunder I will lead you to is real, would you throw
it away for a dream? Go back to the others and bid them stay
hidden. Presently I will return."</p>

<p>They were instantly suspicious, and he saw it.</p>

<p>"Return thou, Uzun Beg," he said, "and give the others my
message. The rest of you come with me."</p>

<p>That quieted the hair-trigger suspicions of the five, but Uzun
Beg grumbled in his beard as he strode back down the slope, mounted
and rode eastward. Gordon and his companions likewise mounted
behind the crest and, keeping below the sky line, they followed the
ridge around as it slanted toward the southwest.</p>

<p>It ended in sheer cliffs, as if it had been sliced off with a
knife, but dense thickets hid them from the sight of the camp as
they crossed the space that lay between the cliffs and the next
ridge, which ran to a bend in the stream, a mile below the
<i>ordu</i>.</p>

<p>This ridge was considerably higher than the one they had left,
and before they reached the point where it began to slope downward
toward the river, Gordon crawled to the crest and scanned the camp
again with a pair of binoculars that had once been the property of
Yusef Khan.</p>

<p>The nomads showed no sign that they suspected the presence of
enemies, and Gordon turned his glasses farther eastward, located
the ridge beyond which his men were concealed, but saw no sign of
them. But he did see something else.</p>

<p>Miles to the east a knife-edge ridge cut the sky, notched with a
shallow pass. As he looked he saw a string of black dots moving
through that notch. It was so far away that even the powerful
glasses did not identify them, but he knew what the dots
were&mdash;mounted men, many of them.</p>

<p>Hurrying back to his five Turkomans, he said nothing, but
pressed on, and presently they emerged from behind the ridge and
came upon the stream where it wound out of sight of the encampment.
Here was the logical crossing for any road leading to Yolgan, and
it was not long before he found what he sought.</p>

<p>In the mud at the edges of the stream were the prints of shod
hoofs and at one spot the mark of a European boot. The Englishmen
had crossed here; beyond the ford their trail lay west, across the
rolling table-land.</p>

<p>Gordon was puzzled anew. He had supposed that there was some
particular reason why this clan had received the Englishmen in
peace. He had reasoned that Ormond would persuade them to escort
him to Yolgan. Though the clans made common cause against invaders,
there were feuds among themselves, and the fact that one tribe
received a man in peace did not mean that another tribe would not
cut his throat.</p>

<p>Gordon had never heard of the nomads of this region showing
friendship to any white man. Yet the Englishmen had passed the
night in that <i>ordu</i> and now plunged boldly on as if confident
of their reception. It looked like utter madness.</p>

<p>As he meditated, a distant sputter of rifle fire jerked his head
up. He splashed across the stream and raced up the slope that hid
them from the valley, with the Turkomans at his heels working the
levers of their rifles. As he topped the slope he saw the scene
below him crystal-etched in the blue evening.</p>

<p>The Turkomans were attacking the Kirghiz camp. They had crept up
the ridge overlooking the valley, and then swept down like a
whirlwind. The surprise had been almost, but not quite, complete.
Outriding shepherds had been shot down and the flocks scattered,
but the surviving nomads had made a stand within the ring of their
tents and wagons.</p>

<p>Ancient matchlocks, bows, and a few modern rifles answered the
fire of the Turkomans. These came on swiftly, shooting from the
saddle, only to wheel and swerve out of close range again.</p>

<p>The Kirghiz were protected by their cover, but even so the hail
of lead took toll. A few saddles were emptied, but the Turkomans
were hard hit on their prancing horses, as the riders swung their
bodies from side to side.</p>

<p>Gordon gave his horse the rein and came galloping across the
valley, his scimitar glittering in his hand. With his enemies gone
from the camp, there was no reason for attacking the Kirghiz now as
he had planned. But the distance was too great for shouted orders
to be heard.</p>

<p>The Turkomans saw him coming, sword in hand, and mistook his
meaning. They thought he meant to lead a charge, and in their zeal
they anticipated him. They were aided by the panic which struck the
Kirghiz as they saw Gordon and his five Turkomans sweep down the
slope and construed it as an attack in force on their flank.</p>

<p>Instantly they directed all their fire at the newcomers,
emptying the clumsy matchlocks long before Gordon was even within
good rifle range. And as they did, the Turkomans charged home with
a yell that shook the valley, preceded by a withering fire as they
blazed away over their horses' ears.</p>

<p>This time no ragged volleys could stop them. In their panic the
tribesmen had loosed all their firearms at once, and the charge
caught them with matchlocks and muskets empty. A straggling rifle
fire met the oncoming raiders and knocked a few out of their
saddles, and a flight of arrows accounted for a few more, but then
the charge burst on the makeshift barricade and crumpled it. The
howling Turkomans rode their horses in among the tents, flailing
right and left with scimitars already crimson.</p>

<p>For an instant hell raged in the <i>ordu</i>, then the
demoralized nomads broke and fled as best they could, being cut
down and trampled by the conquerors. Neither women nor children
were spared by the blood-mad Turks. Such as could slipped out of
the ring and ran wailing for the river. An instant later the riders
were after them like wolves.</p>

<p>Yet, winged by the fear of death, a disorderly mob reached the
shore first, broke through the willows and plunged screaming over
the low bank, trampling each other in the water. Before the
Turkomans could rein their horses over the bank, Gordon arrived,
with his horse plastered with sweat and snorting foam.</p>

<p>Enraged at the wanton slaughter, Gordon was an incarnation of
berserk fury. He caught the first man's bridle and threw his horse
back on its haunches with such violence that the beast lost its
footing and fell, sprawling, throwing its rider. The next man
sought to crowd past, giving tongue like a wolf, and him Gordon
smote with the flat of his scimitar. Only the heavy fur cap saved
the skull beneath, and the man pitched, senseless, from his saddle.
The others yelled and reined back suddenly.</p>

<p>Gordon's wrath was like a dash of ice-cold water in their faces,
shocking their blood-mad nerves into stinging sensibility. From
among the tents cries still affronted the twilight, with the
butcherlike chopping of merciless sword blows, but Gordon gave no
heed. He could save no one in the plundered camp, where the howling
warriors were ripping the tents to pieces, overturning the wagons
and setting the torch in a hundred places.</p>

<p>More and more men with burning eyes and dripping blades were
streaming toward the river, halting as they saw El Borak barring
their way. There was not a ruffian there who looked half as
formidable as Gordon did in that instant. His lips snarled and his
eyes were black coals of hell's fire.</p>

<p>There was no play acting about it. His mask of immobility had
fallen, revealing the sheer primordial ferocity of the soul
beneath. The dazed Turkomans, still dizzy from the glutting of
their blood lust, weary from striking great blows, and puzzled by
his attitude, shrank back from him.</p>

<p>"Who gave the order to attack?" he yelled, and his voice was
like the slash of a saber.</p>

<p>He trembled in the intensity of his passion. He was a blazing
flame of fury and death, without control or repression. He was as
wild and brute-savage in that moment as the wildest barbarian in
that raw land.</p>

<p>"Uzun Beg!" cried a score of voices, and men pointed at the
scowling warrior. "He said that you had stolen away to betray us to
the Kirghiz, and that we should attack before they had time to come
upon us and surround us. We believed him until we saw you riding
over the slope."</p>

<p>With a wordless fierce yell like the scream of a striking
panther, Gordon hurled his horse like a typhoon on Uzun Beg,
smiting with his scimitar. Uzun Beg catapulted from his saddle with
his skull crushed, dead before he actually realized that he was
menaced.</p>

<p>El Borak wheeled on the others and they reined back from him,
scrambling in terror.</p>

<p>"Dogs! Jackals! Noseless apes! Forgotten of God!" he lashed them
with words that burned like scorpions. "Sons of nameless curs! Did
I not bid you keep hidden? Is my word wind&mdash;a leaf to be blown
away by the breath of a dog like Uzun Beg? Now you have lapped up
needless blood, and the whole countryside will be riding us down
like jackals. Where is your loot? Where is the gold with which the
wagons were laden?"</p>

<p>"There was no gold," muttered a tribesman, mopping blood from a
sword cut.</p>

<p>They flinched from the savage scorn and anger in Gordon's baying
laughter.</p>

<p>"Dogs that nuzzle in the dung heaps of hell! I should leave you
to die."</p>

<p>"Slay him!" mouthed a tribesman. "Shall we eat of an infidel?
Slay him and let us go back whence we came. There is no loot in
this naked land."</p>

<p>The proposal was not greeted with enthusiasm. Their rifles were
all empty, some even discarded in the fury of sword strokes. They
knew the rifle under El Borak's knee was loaded and the pistol at
his hip. Nor did any of them care to ride into the teeth of that
reddened scimitar that swung like a live thing in his right
hand.</p>

<p>Gordon saw their indecision and mocked them. He did not argue or
reason as another man might have done. And if he had, they would
have killed him. He beat down opposition with curses, abuses, and
threats that were convincing because he meant every word he spat at
them. They submitted because they were a wolf pack, and he was the
grimmest wolf of them all.</p>

<p>Not one man in a thousand could have bearded them as he did and
lived. But there was a driving elemental power about him that shook
resolution and daunted anger&mdash;something of the fury of an
unleashed torrent or a roaring wind that hammered down will power
by sheer ferocity.</p>

<p>"We will have no more of thee," the boldest voiced the last
spark of rebellion. "Go thy ways, and we will go ours."</p>

<p>Gordon barked a bitter laugh. "Thy ways lead to the fires of
Jehannum!" he taunted bitterly. "Ye have spilled blood, and blood
will be demanded in payment. Do you dream that those who have
escaped will not flee to the nearest tribes and raise the
countryside? You will have a thousand riders about your ears before
dawn."</p>

<p>"Let us ride eastward," one said nervously. "We will be out of
this land of devils before the alarm is raised."</p>

<p>Again Gordon laughed and men shivered. "Fools! You cannot
return. With the glasses I have seen a body of horsemen following
our trail. Ye are caught in the fangs of the vise. Without me you
cannot go onward; if you stand still or go back, none of you will
see another sun set."</p>

<p>Panic followed instantly which was more difficult to fight down
than rebellion.</p>

<p>"Slay him!" howled one. "He has led us into a trap!"</p>

<p>"Fools!" cried Orkhan Shah, who was one of the five Gordon had
led to the ford. "It was not he who tricked you into charging the
Kirghiz. <i>He</i> would have led us on to the loot he promised. He
knows this land and we do not. If ye slay him now, ye slay the only
man who may save us!"</p>

<p>That spark caught instantly, and they clamored about Gordon.</p>

<p>"The wisdom of the sahibs is thine! We be dogs who eat dirt!
Save us from our folly! Lo, we obey thee! Lead us out of this land
of death, and show us the gold whereof thou spokest!"</p>

<p>Gordon sheathed his scimitar and took command without comment.
He gave orders and they were obeyed. Once these wild men, in their
fear, turned to him, they trusted him implicitly. They knew he was
somehow using them ruthlessly in his own plans, but that was
nothing more than any one of them would have done had he been able.
In that wild land only the ways of the wolf pack prevailed.</p>

<p>As many Kirghiz horses as could be quickly caught were rounded
up. On some of them food and articles of clothing from the looted
camp were hastily tied. Half a dozen Turkomans had been killed,
nearly a dozen wounded. The dead were left where they had fallen.
The most badly wounded were tied to their saddles, and their groans
made the night hideous. Darkness had fallen as the desperate band
rode over the slope and plunged across the river. The wailing of
the Kirghiz women, hidden in the thickets, was like the dirging of
lost souls.</p>
<br>

<h2><a id="daughter5" name="daughter5">CHAPTER V</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">GORDON did not attempt to follow the trail of the
Englishman over the comparatively level table-land. Yolgan was his
destination and he believed he would find them there, but there was
desperate need to escape the tribesmen who he was certain were
following them, and who would be lashed to fiercer determination by
what they would find in the camp by the river.</p>

<p>Instead of heading straight across the table-land, Gordon swung
into the hills that bordered it on the south and began following
them westward. Before midnight one of the wounded men died in his
saddle, and some of the others were semidelirious. They hid the
body in a crevice and went on. They moved through the darkness of
the hills like ghosts; the only sounds were the clink of hoofs on
stone and the groans of the wounded.</p>

<p>An hour before dawn they came to a stream which wound between
limestone ledges, a broad shallow stream with a solid rock bottom.
They waded their horses along it for three miles, then climbed out
again on the same side.</p>

<p>Gordon knew that the Kirghiz, smelling out their trail like
wolves, would follow them to the bank and expect some such ruse as
an effort to hide their tracks. But he hoped that the nomads would
be expecting them to cross the stream and plunge into the mountains
on the other side and would therefore waste time looking for tracks
along the south bank.</p>

<p>He now headed westward in a more direct route. He did not expect
to throw the Kirghiz entirely off the scent. He was only playing
for time. If they lost his trail, they would search in any
direction first except toward Yolgan, and to Yolgan he must go,
since there was now no chance of catching his enemies on the
road.</p>

<p>Dawn found them in the hills, a haggard, weary band. Gordon bade
them halt and rest and, while they did so, he climbed the highest
crag he could find and patiently scanned the surrounding cliffs and
ravines with his binoculars, while he chewed tough strips of dried
mutton which the tribesmen carried between saddle and saddlecloth
to keep warm and soft. He alternated with cat naps of ten or
fifteen minutes' duration, storing up concentrated energy as men of
the outlands learn to do, and between times watching the ridges for
signs of pursuit.</p>

<p>He let the men rest as long as he dared, and the sun was high
when he descended the rock and stirred them into wakefulness. Their
steel- spring bodies had recovered some of their resilience, and
they rose and saddled with alacrity, all except one of the wounded
men, who had died in his sleep. They lowered his body into a deep
fissure in the rocks and went on, more slowly, for the horses felt
the grind more than the men.</p>

<p>All day they threaded their way through wild gorges overhung by
gloomy crags. The Turkomans were crowded by the grim desolation and
the knowledge that a horde of bloodthirsty barbarians were on their
trail. They followed Gordon without question as he led them,
turning and twisting, along dizzy heights and down into the abysmal
gloom of savage gorges, then up turreted ridges again and around
windswept shoulders.</p>

<p>He had used every artifice known to him to shake off pursuit and
was making for his set goal as fast as possible. He did not fear
encountering any clans in these bare hills; they grazed their
flocks on the lower levels. But he was not as familiar with the
route he was following as his men thought.</p>

<p>He was feeling his way, mostly by the instinct for direction
that men who live in the open possess, but he would have been lost
a dozen times but for glimpses of Mount Erlik Khan shouldering up
above the surrounding hills in the distance.</p>

<p>As they progressed westward he recognized other landmarks, seen
from new angles, and just before sunset he glimpsed a broad shallow
valley, across the pine-grown slopes of which he saw the walls of
Yolgan looming against the crags behind it.</p>

<p>Yolgan was built at the foot of a mountain, overlooking the
valley through which a stream wandered among masses of reeds and
willows. Timber was unusually dense. Rugged mountains, dominated by
Erlik's peak to the south, swept around the valley to the south and
west, and in the north it was blocked by a chain of hills. To the
east it was open, sloping down from a succession of uneven ridges.
Gordon and his men had followed the ranges in their flight, and now
they looked down on the valley from the south.</p>

<p>El Borak led the warriors down from the higher crags and hid
them on one of the many gorges debouching on the lower slopes, not
more than a mile and a half from the city itself. It ended in a
cul-de-sac and suggested a trap, but the horses were ready to fall
from exhaustion, the men's canteens were empty, and a spring
gurgling out of the solid rock decided Gordon.</p>

<p>He found a ravine leading out of the gorge and placed men on
guard there, as well as at the gorge mouth. It would serve as an
avenue of escape if need be. The men gnawed the scraps of food that
remained, and dressed their wounds as best they could. When he told
them he was going on a solitary scout they looked at him with
lack-luster eyes, in the grip of the fatalism that is the heritage
of the Turkish races.</p>

<p>They did not mistrust him, but they felt like dead men already.
They looked like ghouls, with their dusty, torn garments, clotted
with dried blood, and sunken eyes of hunger and weariness. They
squatted or lay about, wrapped in their tattered cloaks,
unspeaking.</p>

<p>Gordon was more optimistic than they. Perhaps they had not
completely eluded the Kirghiz, but he believed it would take some
time for even those human bloodhounds to ferret them out, and he
did not fear discovery by the inhabitants of Yolgan. He knew they
seldom wandered into the hills.</p>

<p>Gordon had neither slept nor eaten as much as his men, but his
steely frame was more enduring than theirs, and he was animated by
a terrific vitality that would keep his brain clear and his body
vibrant long after another man had dropped in his tracks.</p>

<p>It was dark when Gordon strode on foot out of the gorge, the
stars hanging over the peaks like points of chilled silver. He did
not strike straight across the valley, but kept to the line of
marching hills. So it was no great coincidence that he discovered
the cave where men were hidden.</p>

<p>It was situated in a rocky shoulder that ran out into the
valley, and which he skirted rather than clamber over. Tamarisk
grew thickly about it, masking the mouth so effectually that it was
only by chance that he glimpsed the reflection of a fire against a
smooth inner wall.</p>

<p>Gordon crept through the thickets and peered in. It was a bigger
cave than the mouth indicated. A small fire was going, and three
men squatted by it, eating and conversing in guttural Pashto.
Gordon recognized three of the camp servants of the Englishmen.
Farther back in the cave he saw the horses and heaps of camp
equipment. The mutter of conversation was unintelligible where he
crouched, and even as he wondered where the white men and the
fourth servant were, he heard someone approaching.</p>

<p>He drew back farther into the shadows and waited, and presently
a tall figure loomed in the starlight. It was the other Pathan, his
arms full of firewood.</p>

<p>As he strode toward the natural camp which led up the cave
mouth, he passed so close to Gordon's hiding place that the
American could have touched him with an extended arm. But he did
not extend an arm; he sprang on the man's back like a panther on a
buck.</p>

<p>The firewood was knocked in all directions and the two men
rolled together down a short grassy slope, but Gordon's fingers
were digging into the Pathan's bull throat, strangling his efforts
to cry out, and the struggle made no noise that could have been
heard inside the cave above the crackle of the tamarisk chunks.</p>

<p>The Pathan's superior height and weight were futile against the
corded sinews and wrestling skills of his opponent. Heaving the man
under him, Gordon crouched on his breast and throttled him dizzy
before he relaxed his grasp and let life and intelligence flow back
into his victim's dazed brain.</p>

<p>The Pathan recognized his captor and his fear was the greater,
because he thought he was in the hands of a ghost. His eyes
glimmered in the gloom and his teeth shone in the black tangle of
his beard.</p>

<p>"Where are the Englishmen?" demanded Gordon softly. "Speak, you
dog, before I break your neck!"</p>

<p>"They went at dusk toward the city of devils!" gasped the
Pathan.</p>

<p>"Prisoners?"</p>

<p>"Nay; one with a shaven head guided them. They bore their
weapons and were not afraid."</p>

<p>"What are they doing here?"</p>

<p>"By Allah, I do not know!"</p>

<p>"Tell me all you do know," commanded Gordon. "But speak softly.
If your mates hear and come forth, you will suddenly cease to be.
Begin where I went forth to shoot the stag. After that, Ormond
killed Ahmed. That I know."</p>

<p>"Aye; it was the Englishman. I had naught to do with it. I saw
Ahmed lurking outside Pembroke Sahib's tent. Presently Ormond Sahib
came forth and dragged him in the tent. A gun spoke, and when we
went to look, the Punjabi lay dead on the floor of the tent.</p>

<p>"Then the sahibs bade us strike the tents and load the pack
horses, and we did so without question. We went westward in great
haste. When the night was not yet half over, we sighted a camp of
pagans, and my brothers and I were much afraid. But the sahibs went
forward, and when the accursed ones came forth with arrows on
string, Ormond Sahib held up a strange emblem which glowed in the
light of the torches, whereupon the heathens dismounted and bowed
to the earth.</p>

<p>"We abode in their camp that night. In the darkness someone came
to the camp and there was fighting and a man slain, and Ormond
Sahib said it was a spying Turkoman, and that there would be
fighting, so at dawn we left the pagans and went westward in haste,
across the ford. When we met other heathen, Ormond showed them the
talisman, and they did us honor. All day we hastened, driving the
beasts hard, and when night fell we did not halt, for Ormond Sahib
was like one mad. So before the night was half gone, we came into
this valley, and the sahibs hid us in this cave.</p>

<p>"Here we abode until a pagan passed near the cavern this
morning, driving sheep. Then Ormond Sahib called to him and showed
him the talisman and made it known that he wished speech with the
priest of the city. So the man went, and presently he returned with
the priest who could speak Kashmiri. He and the sahibs talked long
together, but what they said I know not. But Ormond Sahib killed
the man who had gone to fetch the priest, and he and the priest hid
the body with stones.</p>

<p>"Then after more talk, the priest went away, and the sahibs
abode in the cave all day. But at dusk another man came to them, a
man with a shaven head and camel's hair robes, and they went with
him toward the city. They bade us eat and then saddle and pack the
animals, and be ready to move with great haste between midnight and
dawn. That is all I know, as Allah is my witness."</p>

<p>Gordon made no reply. He believed the man was telling the truth,
and his bewilderment grew. As he meditated on the tangle, he
unconsciously relaxed his grip, and the Pathan chose that instant
to make his break for freedom. With a convulsive heave he tore
himself partly free of Gordon's grasp, whipped from his garments a
knife he had been unable to reach before, and yelled loudly as he
stabbed.</p>

<p>Gordon avoided the thrust by a quick twist of his body; the edge
slit his shirt and the skin beneath, and stung by its bite and his
peril, he caught the Pathan's bull neck in both hands and put all
his strength into a savage wrench. The man's spinal column snapped
like a rotten branch, and Gordon flung himself over backward into
the thicker shadows as a man bulked black in the mouth of the
cavern. The fellow called a cautious query, but Gordon waited for
no more. He was already gone like a phantom into the gloom.</p>

<p>The Pathan repeated his call and then, getting no response,
summoned his mates in some trepidation. With weapons in their hands
they stole down the ramp, and presently one of them stumbled over
the body of their companion. They bent over it, muttering
affrightedly.</p>

<p>"This is a place of devils," said one. "The devils have slain
Akbar."</p>

<p>"Nay," said another. "It is the people of this valley. They mean
to slay us one by one." He grasped his rifle and stared fearsomely
into the shadows that hemmed them in. "They have bewitched the
sahibs and led them away to be slain," he muttered.</p>

<p>"We will be next," said the third. "The sahibs are dead. Let us
load the animals and go away quickly. Better die in the hills than
wait like sheep for our throats to be cut."</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were hurrying eastward through the
pines as fast as they could urge the beasts.</p>

<p>Of this Gordon knew nothing. When he left the slope below the
cave he did not follow the trend of the hills as before, but headed
straight through the pines toward the lights of Yolgan. He had not
gone far when he struck a road from the east leading toward the
city. It wound among the pines, a slightly less dark thread in a
bulwark of blackness.</p>

<p>He followed it to within easy sight of the great gate which
stood open in the dark and massive walls of the town. Guards leaned
carelessly on their matchlocks. Yolgan feared no attack. Why should
it? The wildest of the Mohammedan tribes shunned the land of the
devil worshipers. Sounds of barter and dispute were wafted by the
night wind through the gate.</p>

<p>Somewhere in Yolgan, Gordon was sure, were the men he was
seeking. That they intended returning to the cave he had been
assured. But there was a reason why he wished to enter Yolgan, a
reason not altogether tied up with vengeance. As he pondered,
hidden in the deep shadow, he heard the soft <i>clop</i> of hoofs
on the dusty road behind him. He slid farther back among the pines;
then with a sudden thought he turned and made his way beyond the
first turn, where he crouched in the blackness beside the road.</p>

<p>Presently a train of laden pack mules came along, with men
before and behind and at either side. They bore no torches, moving
like men who knew their path. Gordon's eyes had so adjusted
themselves to the faint starlight of the road that he was able to
recognize them as Kirghiz herdsmen in their long cloaks and round
caps. They passed so close to him that their body-scent filled his
nostrils.</p>

<p>He crouched lower in the blackness, and as the last man moved
past him, a steely arm hooked fiercely about the Kirghiz's throat,
choking his cry. An iron fist crunched against his jaw and he
sagged senseless in Gordon's arms. The others were already out of
sight around the bend of the trail, and the scrape of the mules'
bulging packs against the branches along the road was enough to
drown the slight noises of the struggle.</p>

<p>Gordon dragged his victim in under the black branches and
swiftly stripped him, discarding his own boots and kaffiyeh and
donning the native's garments, with pistol and scimitar buckled on
under the long cloak. A few minutes later he was moving along after
the receding column, leaning on his staff as with the weariness of
long travel. He knew the man behind him would not regain
consciousness for hours.</p>

<p>He came up with the tail of the train, but lagged behind as a
straggler might. He kept close enough to the caravan to be
identified with it, but not so close as to tempt conversation or
recognition by the other members of the train. When they passed
through the gate none challenged him. Even in the flare of the
torches under the great gloomy arch he looked like a native, with
his dark features fitting in with his garments and the lambskin
cap.</p>

<p>As he went down the torch-lighted street, passing unnoticed
among the people who chattered and argued in the markets and
stalls, he might have been one of the many Kirghiz shepherds who
wandered about, gaping at the sights of the city which to them
represented the last word in the metropolitan.</p>

<p>Yolgan was not like any other city in Asia. Legend said it was
built long ago by a cult of devil worshipers who, driven from their
distant homeland, had found sanctuary in this unmapped country,
where an isolated branch of the Black Kirghiz, wilder than their
kinsmen, roamed as masters. The people of the city were a mixed
breed, descendants of these original founders and the Kirghiz.</p>

<p>Gordon saw the monks who were the ruling caste in Yolgan
striding through the bazaars&mdash;tall, shaven-headed men with
Mongolian features. He wondered anew as to their exact origin. They
were not Tibetans. Their religion was not a depraved Buddhism. It
was unadulterated devil worship. The architecture of their shrines
and temples differed from any he had ever encountered anywhere.</p>

<p>But he wasted no time in conjecture, nor in aimless wandering.
He went straight to the great stone building squatted against the
side of the mountain at the foot of which Yolgan was built. Its
great blank curtains of stone seemed almost like part of the
mountain itself.</p>

<p>No one hindered him. He mounted a long flight of steps that were
at least a hundred feet wide, bending over his staff as with the
weariness of a long pilgrimage. Great bronze doors stood open,
unguarded, and he kicked off his sandals and came into a huge hall
the inner gloom of which was barely lighted by dim brazen lamps in
which melted butter was burned.</p>

<p>Shaven-headed monks moved through the shadows like dusky ghosts,
but they gave him no heed, thinking him merely a rustic worshiper
come to leave some humble offering at the shrine of Erlik, Lord of
the Seventh Hell.</p>

<p>At the other end of the hall, view was cut off by a great
divided curtain of gilded leather that hung from the lofty roof to
the floor. Half a dozen steps that crossed the hall led up to the
foot of the curtain, and before it a monk sat cross-legged and
motionless as a statue, arms folded and head bent as if in
communion with unguessed spirits.</p>

<p>Gordon halted at the foot of the steps, made as if to prostrate
himself, then retreated as if in sudden panic. The monk showed no
interest. He had seen too many nomads from the outer world overcome
by superstitious awe before the curtain that hid the dread effigy
of Erlik Khan. The timid Kirghiz might skulk about the temple for
hours before working up nerve enough to make his devotions to the
deity. None of the priests paid any attention to the man in the
caftan of a shepherd who slunk away as if abashed.</p>

<p>As soon as he was confident that he was not being watched,
Gordon slipped through a dark doorway some distance from the gilded
curtain and groped his way down a broad unlighted hallway until he
came to a flight of stairs. Up this he went with both haste and
caution and came presently into a long corridor along which winked
sparks of light, like fireflies in a tunnel.</p>

<p>He knew these lights were tiny lamps in the small cells that
lined the passage, where the monks spent long hours in
contemplation of dark mysteries, or pored over forbidden volumes,
the very existence of which is not suspected by the outer world.
There was a stair at the nearer end of the corridor, and up this he
went, without being discovered by the monks in their cells. The pin
points of light in the chambers did not serve to illuminate the
darkness of the corridor to any extent.</p>

<p>As Gordon approached a crook in the stair he renewed his
caution, for he knew there would be a man on guard at the head of
the steps. He knew also that he would be likely to be asleep. The
man was there&mdash;a half-naked giant with the wizened features of
a deaf mute. A broad- tipped tulwar lay across his knees and his
head rested on it as he slept.</p>

<p>Gordon stole noiselessly past him and came into an upper
corridor which was dimly lighted by brass lamps hung at intervals.
There were no doorless cells here, but heavy bronze-bound teak
portals flanked the passage. Gordon went straight to one which was
particularly ornately carved and furnished with an unusual fretted
arch by way of ornament. He crouched there listening intently, then
took a chance and rapped softly on the door. He rapped nine times,
with an interval between each three raps.</p>

<p>There was an instant's tense silence, then an impulsive rush of
feet across a carpeted floor, and the door was jerked open. A
magnificent figure stood framed in the soft light. It was a woman,
a lithe, splendid creature whose vibrant figure exuded magnetic
vitality. The jewels that sparkled in the girdle about her supple
hips were no more scintillant than her eyes.</p>

<p>Instant recognition blazed in those eyes, despite his native
garments. She caught him in a fierce grasp. Her slender arms were
strong as pliant steel.</p>

<p>"El Borak! I knew you would come!"</p>

<p>Gordon stepped into the chamber and closed the door behind him.
A quick glance showed him there was no one there but themselves.
Its thick Persian rugs, silk divans, velvet hangings, and
gold-chased lamps struck a vivid contrast with the grim plainness
of the rest of the temple. Then he turned his full attention again
to the woman who stood before him, her white hands clenched in a
sort of passionate triumph.</p>

<p>"How did you know I would come, Yasmeena?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You never failed a friend in need," she answered.</p>

<p>"Who is in need?"</p>

<p>"I!"</p>

<p>"But you are a goddess!"</p>

<p>"I explained it all in my letter!" she exclaimed
bewilderedly.</p>

<p>Gordon shook his head. "I have received no letter."</p>

<p>"Then why are you here?" she demanded in evident puzzlement.</p>

<p>"It's a long story," he answered. "Tell me first why Yasmeena,
who had the world at her feet and threw it away for weariness to
become a goddess in a strange land, should speak of herself as one
in need."</p>

<p>"In desperate need, El Borak." She raked back her dark locks
with a nervously quick hand. Her eyes were shadowed with weariness
and something more, something which Gordon had never seen there
before&mdash;the shadow of fear.</p>

<p>"Here is food you need more than I," she said as she sank down
on a divan and with a dainty foot pushed toward him a small gold
table on which were chupaties, curried rice, and broiled mutton,
all in gold vessels, and a gold jug of kumiss.</p>

<p>He sat down without comment and began to eat with unfeigned
gusto. In his drab camel's-hair caftan, with the wide sleeves drawn
back from his corded brown arms, he looked out of place in that
exotic chamber.</p>

<p>Yasmeena watched him broodingly, her chin resting on her hand,
her somber eyes enigmatic.</p>

<p>"I did not have the world at my feet, El Borak," she said
presently. "But I had enough of it to sicken me. It became a wine
which had lost its savor. Flattery became like an insult; the
adulation of men became an empty repetition without meaning. I grew
maddeningly weary of the flat fool faces that smirked eternally up
at me, all wearing the same sheep expressions and animated by the
same sheep thoughts. All except a few men like you, El Borak, and
you were wolves in the flock. I might have loved you, El Borak, but
there is something too fierce about you; your soul is a whetted
blade on which I feared I might cut myself."</p>

<p>He made no reply, but tilted the golden jug and gulped down
enough stinging kumiss to have made an ordinary man's head swim at
once. He had lived the life of the nomads so long that their tastes
had become his.</p>

<p>"So I became a princess, wife of a prince of Kashmir," she went
on, her eyes smoldering with a marvelous shifting of clouds and
colors. "I thought I knew the depths of men's swinishness. I found
I had much to learn. He was a beast. I fled from him into India,
and the British protected me when his ruffians would have dragged
me back to him. He still offers many thousand rupees to anyone who
will bring me alive to him, so that he may soothe his vanity by
having me tortured to death."</p>

<p>"I have heard a rumor to that effect," answered Gordon.</p>

<p>A recurrent thought caused his face to darken. He did not frown,
but the effect was subtly sinister.</p>

<p>"That experience completed my distaste for the life I knew," she
said, her dark eyes vividly introspective. "I remembered that my
father was a priest of Yolgan who fled away for love of a stranger
woman. I had emptied the cup and the bowl was dry. I remembered
Yolgan through the tales my father told me when I was a babe, and a
great yearning rose in me to lose the world and find my soul. All
the gods I knew had proved false to me. The mark of Erlik was upon
me&mdash;" she parted her pearl-sewn vest and displayed a curious
starlike mark between her firm breasts.</p>

<p>"I came to Yolgan as well you know, because you brought me, in
the guise of a Kirghiz from Issik-kul. As you know, the people
remembered my father, and though they looked on him as a traitor,
they accepted me as one of them, and because of an old legend which
spoke of the star on a woman's bosom, they hailed me as a goddess,
the incarnation of the daughter of Erlik Khan.</p>

<p>"For a while after you went away I was content. The people
worshipped me with more sincerity than I had ever seen displayed by
the masses of civilization. Their curious rituals were strange and
fascinating. Then I began to go further into their mysteries; I
began to sense the essence of the formula&mdash;" She paused, and
Gordon saw the fear grow in her eyes again.</p>

<p>"I had dreamed of a calm retreat of mystics, inhabited by
philosophers. I found a haunt of bestial devils, ignorant of all
but evil. Mysticism? It is black shamanism, foul as the tundras
which bred it. I have seen things that made me afraid. Yes, I,
Yasmeena, who never knew the meaning of the word, I have learned
fear. Yogok, the high priest, taught me. You warned me against
Yogok before you left Yolgan. Well had I heeded you. He hates me.
He knows I am not divine, but he fears my power over the people. He
would have slain me long ago had he dared.</p>

<p>"I am wearied to death of Yolgan. Erlik Khan and his devils have
proved no less an illusion than the gods of India and the West. I
have not found the perfect way. I have found only awakened desire
to return to the world I cast away.</p>

<p>"I want to go back to Delhi. At night I dream of the noise and
smells of the streets and bazaars. I am half Indian, and all the
blood of India is calling me. I was a fool. I had life in my hands
and did not recognize it."</p>

<p>"Why not go back, then?" asked Gordon.</p>

<p>She shuddered. "I cannot. The gods of Yolgan must remain in
Yolgan forever. Should one depart, the people believe the city
would perish. Yogok would be glad to see me go, but he fears the
fury of the people too much either to slay me or aid me to escape.
I knew there was but one man who might help me. I wrote a letter to
you and smuggled it out by a Tajik trader. With it I sent my sacred
emblem&mdash;a jeweled gold star&mdash;which would pass you safely
through the country of the nomads. They would not harm a man
bearing it. He would be safe from all but the priests of the city.
I explained that in my letter."</p>

<p>"I never got it," Gordon answered. "I'm here after a couple of
scoundrels whom I was guiding into the Uzbek country, and who for
no apparent reason murdered my servant Ahmed and deserted me in the
hills. They're in Yolgan now, somewhere."</p>

<p>"White men?" she exclaimed. "That is impossible! They could
never have got through the tribes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's only one key to the puzzle," he interrupted. "Somehow
your letter fell into their hands. They used your star to let them
through. They don't mean to rescue you, because they got in touch
with Yogok as soon as they reached the valley. There's only one
thing I can think of&mdash;they intend kidnapping you to sell to
your former husband."</p>

<p>She sat up straight; her white hands clenched on the edge of the
divan and her eyes flashed. In that instant she looked as splendid
and as dangerous as a cobra when it rears up to strike.</p>

<p>"Back to that pig? Where are these dogs? I will speak a word to
the people and they shall cease to be!"</p>

<p>"That would betray yourself," returned Gordon. "The people would
kill the stranger, and Yogok, too, maybe, but they'd learn that
you'd been trying to escape from Yolgan. They allow you the freedom
of the temple, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes; with shaven-headed skulkers spying on my every move,
except when I am on this floor, from which only a single stair
leads down. That stair is always guarded."</p>

<p>"By a guard who sleeps," said Gordon. "That's bad enough, but if
the people found you were trying to escape, they might shut you up
in a little cell for the rest of your life. People are particularly
careful of their deities."</p>

<p>She shuddered, and her fine eyes flashed the fear an eagle feels
for a cage. "Then what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;yet. I have nearly a hundred Turkoman
ruffians hidden up in the hills, but just now they're more
hindrance than help. There's not enough of them to do much good in
a pitched battle, and they're almost sure to be discovered
tomorrow, if not before. I brought them into this mess, and it's up
to me to get them out&mdash;or as many as I can. I came here to
kill these Englishmen, Ormond and Pembroke. But that can wait now.
I'm going to get you out of here, but I don't dare move until I
know where Yogok and the Englishmen are. Is there anyone in Yolgan
you can trust?"</p>

<p>"Any of the people would die for me, but they won't let me go.
Only actual harm done me by the monks would stir them up against
Yogok. No; I dare trust none of them."</p>

<p>"You say that stair is the only way up onto this floor?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The temple is built against the mountain, and galleries
and corridors on the lower floors go back far into the mountain
itself. But this is the highest floor, and is reserved entirely for
me. There's no escape from it except down through the temple,
swarming with monks. I keep only one servant here at night, and she
is at present sleeping in a chamber some distance from this and is
senseless with bhang as usual."</p>

<p>"Good enough!" grunted Gordon. "Here, take this pistol. Lock the
door after I go through and admit no one but myself. You'll
recognize me by the nine raps, as usual."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she demanded, staring up and mechanically
taking the weapon he tendered her, butt first.</p>

<p>"To do a little spying," he answered. "I've got to know what
Yogok and the others are doing. If I tried to smuggle you out now,
we might run square into them. I can't make plans until I know some
of theirs. If they intend sneaking you out tonight, as I think they
do, it might be a good idea to let them do it, and then swoop down
with the Turkomans and take you away from them, when they've got
well away from the city. But I don't want to do that unless I have
to. Bound to be shooting and a chance of your getting hit by a
stray bullet. I'm going now; listen for my rap."</p>
<br>

<h2><a id="daughter6" name="daughter6">CHAPTER VI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE mute guard still slumbered on the stair as
Gordon glided past him. No lights glinted now as he descended into
the lower corridor. He knew the cells were all empty, for the monks
slept in chambers on a lower level. As he hesitated, he heard
sandals shuffling down the passage in the pitch blackness.</p>

<p>Stepping into one of the cells he waited until the unseen
traveler was opposite him, then he hissed softly. The tread halted
and a voice muttered a query.</p>

<p>"Art thou Yatub?" asked Gordon in the gutturals of the Kirghiz.
Many of the lower monks were pure Kirghiz in blood and speech.</p>

<p>"Nay," came the answer. "I am Ojuh. Who art thou?"</p>

<p>"No matter; call me Yogok's dog if thou wilt. I am a watcher.
Have the white men come into the temple yet?"</p>

<p>"Aye. Yogok brought them by the secret way, lest the people
suspect their presence. If thou art close to Yogok, tell
me&mdash;what is his plan?"</p>

<p>"What is thine own opinion?" asked Gordon.</p>

<p>An evil laugh answered him, and he could feel the monk leaning
closer in the darkness to rest an elbow on the jamb.</p>

<p>"Yogok is crafty," he murmured. "When the Tajik whom Yasmeena
bribed to bear her letter showed it to Yogok, our master bade him
do as she had instructed him. When the man for whom she sent came
for her, Yogok planned to slay both him and her, making it seem to
the people that the white man had slain their goddess."</p>

<p>"Yogok is not forgiving," said Gordon at a venture.</p>

<p>"A cobra is more so." The monk laughed. "Yasmeena has thwarted
him too often in the matter of sacrifices for him to allow her to
depart in peace."</p>

<p>"Yet such is now his plan!" asserted Gordon.</p>

<p>"Nay; thou art a simple man, for one who calls himself a
watcher. The letter was meant for El Borak. But the Tajik was
greedy and sold it to these sahibs and told them of Yogok. They
will not take her to India. They will sell her to a prince in
Kashmir who will have her beaten to death with a slipper. Yogok
himself will guide them through the hills by the secret route. He
is in terror of the people, but his hate for Yasmeena overcomes
him."</p>

<p>Gordon had heard all he wished to know, and he was in a sudden
rush to be gone. He had abandoned his tentative plan of letting
Ormond get the girl outside the city before rescuing her. With
Yogok guiding the Englishmen through hidden passes, he might find
it impossible to overtake them.</p>

<p>The monk, however, was in no hurry to conclude the conversation.
He began speaking again, and then Gordon saw a light moving like a
glowworm in the blackness, and he heart a swift patter of bare feet
and a man breathing heavily. He drew farther back into the
cell.</p>

<p>It was another monk who came up the corridor, carrying a small
brass lamp that lighted his broad, thin-lipped face and made him
look something like a Mongolian devil.</p>

<p>As he saw the monk outside the cell, he began hastily: "Yogok
and the white men have gone to Yasmeena's chamber. The girl, her
servant who spied upon her, has told us that the white devil El
Borak is in Yolgan. He talked with Yasmeena less than half an hour
agone. The girl sped to Yogok as swiftly as she dared, but she
dared not stir until he had left Yasmeena's chamber. He is
somewhere in the temple. I gather men to search. Come with me,
thou, and thou also&mdash;"</p>

<p>He swung the lamp about so that it shone full on Gordon,
crouching in the cell. As the man blinked to see the garments of a
shepherd instead of the familiar robes of a monk, Gordon lashed out
for his jaw, quick and silent as the stroke of a python. The monk
went down like a man shot in the head, and even as the lamp smashed
on the floor, Gordon had leaped and grappled with the other man in
the sudden darkness.</p>

<p>A single cry rang to the vaulted roof before it was strangled in
the corded throat. The monk was hard to hold as a snake, and he
kept groping for a knife, but as they crashed into the stone wall,
Gordon smashed his opponent's head savagely against it. The man
went limp and Gordon flung him down beside the other senseless
shape.</p>

<p>The next instant Gordon was racing up the stairway. It was only
a few steps from the cell where he had hidden, its upper portion
dim in the subdued light of the upper corridor. He knew no one had
gone up or down while he talked with the monk. Yet the man with the
lamp had said that Yogok and the others had gone to Yasmeena's
chamber, and that her treacherous servant girl had come to
them.</p>

<p>He rounded the crook with reckless haste, his scimitar ready,
but the slumping figure at the stairhead did not rise to oppose
him. There was a new sag in the mute's shoulders as he huddled on
the steps. He had been stabbed in the back, so fiercely that the
spinal column had been severed with one stroke.</p>

<p>Gordon wondered why the priest should kill one of his own
servants, but he did not pause; premonition gripping his heart, he
hurled himself down the corridor and in through the arched doorway,
which was unbolted. The chamber was empty. Cushions from the divan
were strewn on the floor. Yasmeena was not to be seen.</p>

<p>Gordon stood like a statue in the center of the room, his
scimitar in his hand. The blue sheen of the light on steel was no
more deadly than the glitter on his black eyes. His gaze swept the
room, lingering no longer on a slight bulge in the hangings on the
rear wall than anywhere else.</p>

<p>He turned toward the door, took a step&mdash;then wheeled and
raced across the chamber like a gust of wind, slashing and hacking
at the tapestry before the man hiding there realized he was
discovered. The keen edge ribboned the velvet arras and blood
spurted; out of the tatters a figure toppled to the floor&mdash;a
shaven monk, literally cut to pieces. He had dropped his knife and
could only grovel and moan, clutching at his spurting arteries.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" snarled Gordon, panting with passion as he
crouched over his hideous handiwork. "Where is she?"</p>

<p>But the man only whimpered and yammered and died without
speaking.</p>

<p>Gordon ran to the walls and began ripping the hangings away.
Somewhere he knew there must be a secret door. But the walls showed
blank, resisting his most violent efforts. He could not follow
Yasmeena by the route her abductors had obviously carried her. He
must escape the city and hasten to the cave, where the servants
were hidden, and to which the Englishmen would undoubtedly return.
He was sweating with the violence of his rage, which almost
submerged caution. He ripped off the camel's hair robe, feeling in
his frenzy that it cramped and hampered him.</p>

<p>But the action brought a thought born of cold reason. The
garments of the senseless monks in the corridor below would furnish
him with a disguise which would aid him to pass unhindered through
the temple, where he knew scores of shaven-headed murderers were
hunting him.</p>

<p>He ran silently from the chamber, passed the sprawling corpse,
rounded the turn of the stair&mdash;then he stopped short. The
lower corridor was a blaze of light, and at the foot of the stairs
stood a mass of monks, holding torches and swords. He saw rifles in
the hands of a dozen.</p>

<p>Details sprang out in startling clarity in the instant that the
monks yelled and raised their rifles. Beyond them he saw a
round-faced slant-eyed girl crouching by the wall. She grasped a
rope which hung down the wall and jerked, and Gordon felt the
stairs give way beneath him. The rifles roared in a ragged volley
as he shot down the black opening which gaped beneath his feet, and
the bullets whined over his head. A fierce cry of triumph rose from
the monks.<br></p>

<h2><a id="daughter7" name="daughter7">CHAPTER VII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER Gordon left her, Yasmeena made fast the door
and returned to her divan. She idly studied the big pistol he had
left with her, fascinated by the blue gleam of the light on its
dully polished steel.</p>

<p>Then she tossed it aside and lay back with her eyes closed.
There was a certain sophistication or innate mysticism in her which
refused to let her put much faith in material weapons. Hers was
that overrefinement of civilization which instinctively belittles
physical action. With all her admiration for Gordon, he was, after
all, to her, a barbarian who put his trust in lead and steel.</p>

<p>She undervalued the weapon he had left with her, and so it was
out of her reach when the noise of a swishing tapestry roused her.
She turned and stared at the rear wall with eyes suddenly dilated.
Behind the hanging she knew&mdash;or thought she knew&mdash;was
solid stone wall, built hard against the sheer mountainside.</p>

<p>But now that hanging lifted, grasped in a yellow clawlike hand.
The hand was followed by a face&mdash;an evil, leering, grayish
face, with slanted eyes and lank hair falling over a narrow
forehead. A thin gash of a mouth gaped, revealing pointed
teeth.</p>

<p>She was so astounded that she sat frozen, unable to supply the
simple explanation of the phenomenon, until the man entered the
room with a slithering silence repulsively suggestive of a snake.
Then she saw that a black opening gaped in the wall behind the
lifted arras, and two faces were framed in it&mdash;white men's
faces, hard and inexorable as stone.</p>

<p>She sprang up then and snatched for the revolver, but it was at
the other end of the divan. She ran around for it, but the
slant-eyed man, with a motion incredibly quick, was before her and
crushed her cruelly in his lean arms, clapping a hand over her
mouth. He heeded the twisting and writhing of her supple body no
more than the struggles of a child.</p>

<p>"Swift!" he ordered in harsh gutturals. "Bind her!"</p>

<p>The white men had followed him into the chamber, but it was a
monk who obeyed, adding a velvet gag. One of the white men picked
up the pistol.</p>

<p>"See to the mute who slumbers on the stairs," her captor
ordered. "He is not our man, but a creature set by the people to
guard her. Even a mute can speak by gestures sometimes."</p>

<p>The evil-faced monk bowed deeply and, unbolting the door, went
out, thumbing a long knife. Another monk stood in the secret
entrance.</p>

<p>"You did not know of the hidden door," jeered the slant-eyed
man. "You fool! The mountain below this temple is honeycombed with
tunnels. You have been spied on constantly. The girl whom you
thought drunk on bhang watched tonight while you talked with El
Borak. That will not alter my plans any, though, except that I have
set my monks to slay El Borak.</p>

<p>"Then we will show the people his body and tell them that you
have returned to your father in the Seventh Hell because Yolgan has
been polluted by the presence of a <i>feringhi</i>. In the meantime
these sahibs will be well on their way to Kashmir with you, my
lovely goddess! Daughter of Erlik! Bah!"</p>

<p>"We're wasting time, Yogok," broke in Ormond roughly. "Once in
the hills, you say, we won't meet any of the Kirghiz, but I want to
be far from Yolgan by daylight."</p>

<p>The priest nodded and motioned to the monk who came forward and
lifted Yasmeena onto a litter he carried. Pembroke took the other
end. At that moment the other monk glided back into the chamber,
wiping blood from his curved blade.</p>

<p>Yogok directed him to hide behind the hangings. "El Borak might
return before the others find him."</p>

<p>Then they passed through the hidden door into darkness lighted
by a butter lamp in Yogok's hand. The priest slid to the heavy
section of stone that formed part of the wall and made it fast with
a bronze bar. Yasmeena saw by the small light of the lamp that they
were in a narrow corridor which slanted downward at a pitch which
grew steeper until it ended in a long narrow stair cut out of solid
rock.</p>

<p>At the bottom of this stair they struck a level tunnel which
they followed for some time, the Englishmen and the monk
alternating with the litter. It ended at last in a wall of rock, in
the center of which was a stone block which worked on a pivot. This
turned, they emerged into a cave, at the mouth of which stars were
visible through a tangle of branches.</p>

<p>When Yogok pushed the block back in place its rough exterior
looked like part of a solid wall. He extinguished the lamp and a
moment later was pushing aside the massed willows which masked the
cave mouth. As they emerged into the starlight, Yasmeena saw that
these willows stood on the bank of a stream.</p>

<p>When her captors had pushed through the trees, waded the shallow
channel, and ascended the farther bank, she saw a cluster of lights
off to her right. Those lights were Yolgan. They had followed
tunnels out into the solid rock of the mountain and had come out at
its foot less than half a mile from the city. Directly ahead of her
the forest lifted in rows of black ramparts, and off to the left
the hills climbed in marching lines.</p>

<p>Her captors set off through the starlight, their apparent
objective a jutting shoulder less than half a mile to the east. The
distance was covered in silence. The nervousness of the white men
was no more evident than that of Yogok. Each man was thinking what
his fate would be if the common people of Yolgan discovered them
kidnapping their goddess.</p>

<p>Yogok's fear was greater than that of the Englishmen. He had
covered his tracks with corpses&mdash;the shepherd who had brought
him Ormond's message, the mute guardian of the stairs; his teeth
chattered as he conjured up possibilities. El Borak must die
without speaking, also; that, he had drilled into the monks.</p>

<p>"Faster! Faster!" he urged, a note of panic in his voice as he
glared at the black forest walls about him. In the moan of the
night wind he seemed to hear the stealthy tread of pursuers.</p>

<p>"Here's the cave," grunted Ormond. "Set her down; no use lugging
her up that slope. I'll go get the servants and the horses. We'll
mount her on one of the pack animals. Have to leave some of our
stuff behind, anyhow. Ohai, Akbar!" he called softly.</p>

<p>There was no answer. The fire had gone out in the cave and the
mouth gaped black and silent.</p>

<p>"Have they gone to sleep?" Ormond swore irritably. "I'll jolly
well wake 'em. Wait!"</p>

<p>He ran lightly up the rough camp and vanished in the cave. A
moment later his voice reached them, echoing hollowly between the
rocky walls. The echoes did not disguise the sudden fear in his
voice.</p>
<br>

<h2><a id="daughter8" name="daughter8">CHAPTER VIII</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Gordon fell through the treacherous stairs,
he shot downward in utter blackness to land on solid stone. Not one
man in a hundred could have survived the fall with unsmashed bones,
but El Borak was all knit wires and steel springs. He landed on all
fours, catlike, with bent joints absorbing the shock. Even so his
whole body was numbed, and his limbs crumpled under him, letting
his frame dash violently against the stone.</p>

<p>He lay there half stunned for a space, then pulled himself
together, cursing the stinging and tingling of his hands and feet,
and felt himself for broken bones.</p>

<p>Thankful to find himself intact, he groped for and found the
scimitar which he had cast from him as he fell. Above him the trap
had closed. Where he was he had no idea, but it was dark as a
Stygian vault. He wondered how far he had fallen, and felt that it
was farther than anyone would ever believe, supposing he escaped to
tell of it. He felt about in the darkness and found that he was in
a square cell of no great dimensions. The one door was locked on
the outside.</p>

<p>His investigations took him only a matter of seconds, and it was
while he was feeling the door that he heard someone fumbling at it
on the other side. He drew back, believing that those who dropped
him into the cell would scarcely have had time to reach it by a
safer way. He believed it was someone who had heard the sound of
his fall and was coming to investigate, doubtless expecting to find
a corpse on the floor.</p>

<p>The door was cast open and light blinded him, but he cut at the
vague figure which loomed in the open door. Then his eyes could see
and they saw a monk lying on the floor of a narrow lamp-lighted
corridor with his shaven head split to the temples. The passage was
empty except for the dead man.</p>

<p>The floor of the corridor sloped slightly, and Gordon went down
it, because to go up it would obviously be returning toward his
enemies. He momentarily expected to hear them howling on his heels,
but evidently they considered that his fall through the trap,
riddled, as they thought, with bullets, was sufficient and were in
no hurry to verify their belief. Doubtless it was the duty of the
monk he had killed to finish off victims dropped through the trap
on the stairs.</p>

<p>The corridor made a sharp turn to the right and the lamps no
longer burned along the walls. Gordon took one of them and went on,
finding that the pitch of the slope grew steeper until he was
forced to check his descent with a hand braced against the wall.
These walls were solid rock, and he knew he was in the mountain on
which the temple was built.</p>

<p>He did not believe any of the inhabitants of Yolgan knew of
these tunnels except the monks; certainly Yasmeena was ignorant of
them. Thought of the girl made him wince. Heaven alone knew where
she was, just then, but he could not aid her until he had escaped
himself from these rat-runs.</p>

<p>Presently the passage turned at right angles into a broader
tunnel which ran level, and he followed it hastily but cautiously,
holding his lamp high. Ahead of him he saw the tunnel end at last
against a rough stone wall in which a door was set in the shape of
a ponderous square block. This, he discovered, was hung on a pivot,
and it revolved with ease, letting him through into a cave
beyond.</p>

<p>As Yasmeena had seen the stars among the branches not long
before, Gordon now discovered them. He put out his lamp, halted an
instant to let his eyes get used to the sudden darkness, and then
started toward the cavern mouth.</p>

<p>Just as he reached it, he crouched back. Somebody was splashing
through the water outside, thrashing through the willows. The man
came panting up the short steep slope, and Gordon saw the evil face
of Yogok in the starlight before the man became a shapeless blob of
blackness as he plunged into the cavern.</p>

<p>The next instant El Borak sprang, bearing his man to the floor.
Yogok let out one hair-raising yell, and then Gordon found his
throat and crouched over him, savagely digging and twisting his
fingers in the priest's neck.</p>

<p>"Where is Yasmeena?" he demanded.</p>

<p>A gurgle answered him. He relaxed his grip a trifle and repeated
the question. Yogok was mad with fear of his attack in the dark,
but somehow&mdash;probably by the body-scent or the lack of
it&mdash;he divined that his captor was a white man.</p>

<p>"Are you El Borak?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Who else? Where is Yasmeena?" Gordon emphasized his demand by a
wrench which brought a gurgle of pain from Yogok's thin lips.</p>

<p>"The Englishmen have her!" he panted.</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Nay; I know not! Ahhh! Mercy, sahib! I will tell!"</p>

<p>Yogok's eyes glimmered white with fear in the darkness. His lean
body was shaking as with an ague.</p>

<p>"We took her to a cave where the sahibs' servants were hidden.
They were gone, with the horses. The Englishmen accused me of
treachery. They said I had made away with their servants and meant
to murder them. They lied. By Erlik, I know not what became of
their cursed Pathans! The Englishmen attacked me, but I fled while
a servant of mine fought with them."</p>

<p>Gordon hauled him to his feet, faced him toward the cave mouth
and bound his hands behind him with his own girdle.</p>

<p>"We're going back," he said grimly. "One yelp out of you and
I'll let out your snake's soul. Guide me as straight to Ormond's
cave as you know."</p>

<p>"Nay; the dogs will slay me!"</p>

<p>"I'll kill you if you don't," Gordon assured him, pushing Yogok
stumbling before him.</p>

<p>The priest was not a back-to-the-wall fighter. Confronted by two
perils he chose the more remote. They waded the stream and on the
other side Yogok turned to the right. Gordon jerked him back.</p>

<p>"I know where I am now," he growled. "And I know where the cave
is. It's in that jut of land to the left. If there's a path through
the pines, show it to me."</p>

<p>Yogok surrendered and hurried through the shadows, conscious of
Gordon's grasp on his collar and the broad edge of Gordon's
scimitar glimmering near. It was growing toward the darkness that
precedes dawn as they came to the cave which loomed dark and silent
among the trees.</p>

<p>"They are gone!" Yogok shivered.</p>

<p>"I didn't expect to find them here," muttered Gordon. "I came
here to pick up their trail. If they thought you'd set the natives
on them, they'd pull out on foot. What worries me is what they did
with Yasmeena."</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>Yogok started convulsively as a low moan smote the air.</p>

<p>Gordon threw him and lashed together his hands and feet. "Not a
sound out of you!" he warned, and then stole up the ramp, sword
ready.</p>

<p>At the mouth he hesitated unwilling to show himself against the
dim starlight behind him. Then he heard the moan again and knew it
was not feigned. It was a human being in mortal agony.</p>

<p>He felt his way into the darkness and presently stumbled over
something yielding, which evoked another moan. His hands told him
it was a man in European clothing. Something warm and oozy smeared
his hands as he groped. Feeling in the man's pockets he found a box
of matches and struck one, cupping it in his hands.</p>

<p>A livid face with glassy eyes stared up at him.</p>

<p>"Pembroke!" muttered Gordon.</p>

<p>The sound of his name seemed to rouse the dying man. He half
rose on an elbow, blood trickling from his mouth with the
effort.</p>

<p>"Ormond!" he whispered ghastily. "Have you come back? Damn you,
I'll do for you yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not Ormond," growled the American. "I'm Gordon. It seems
somebody has saved me the trouble of killing you. Where's
Yasmeena?"</p>

<p>"He took her away." The Englishman's voice was scarcely
intelligible, choked by the flow of blood. "Ormond, the dirty
swine! We found the cave empty&mdash;knew old Yogok had betrayed
us. We jumped him. He ran away. His damned monk stabbed me. Ormond
took Yasmeena and the monk and went away. He's mad. He's going to
try to cross the mountains on foot, with the girl, and the monk to
guide him. And he left me to die, the swine, the filthy swine!"</p>

<p>The dying man's voice rose to a hysterical shriek; he heaved
himself up, his eyes glaring; then a terrible shudder ran through
his body and he was dead.</p>

<p>Gordon rose, struck another match and swept a glance over the
cave. It was utterly bare. Not a firearm in sight. Ormond had
evidently robbed his dying partner. Ormond, starting through the
mountains with a captive woman, and a treacherous monk for a guide,
on foot and with no provisions&mdash;surely the man must be
mad.</p>

<p>Returning to Yogok he unbound his legs, repeating Pembroke's
tale in a few words. He saw the priest's eyes gleam in the
starlight.</p>

<p>"Good! They will all die in the mountains! Let them go!"</p>

<p>"We're following them," Gordon answered. "You know the way the
monk will lead Ormond. Show it to me."</p>

<p>A restoration of confidence had wakened insolence and
defiance.</p>

<p>"No! Let them die!"</p>

<p>With a searing curse Gordon caught the priest's throat and
jammed his head back between his shoulders, until his eyes were
glaring at the stars.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" he ground between his teeth, shaking the man as a
dog shakes a rat. "If you try to balk me now I'll kill you the
slowest way I know. Do you want me to drag you back to Yolgan and
tell the people what you plotted against the daughter of Erlik
Khan? They'll kill me, but they'll flay you alive!"</p>

<p>Yogok knew Gordon would not do that, not because the American
feared death, but because to sacrifice himself would be to remove
Yasmeena's last hope. But Gordon's glaring eyes made him cold with
fear; he sensed the abysmal rage that gripped the white man and
knew that El Borak was on the point of tearing him limb from limb.
In that moment there was no bloody deed of which Gordon was not
capable.</p>

<p>"Stay, sahib!" Yogok gasped. "I will guide you."</p>

<p>"And guide me right!" Gordon jerked him savagely to his feet.
"They have been gone less than an hour. If we don't overtake them
by sunrise, I'll know you've led me astray, and I'll tie you head
down to a cliff for the vultures to eat alive."</p>
<br>

<h2><a id="daughter9" name="daughter9">CHAPTER IX</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN the darkness before dawn Yogok led Gordon up
into the hills by a narrow trail that wound among ravines and windy
crags, climbing ever southward. The eternal lights of Yolgan fell
away behind them, growing smaller and smaller with distance.</p>

<p>They left half a mile to the east of the gorge where the
Turkomans were concealed. Gordon ardently wished to get his men out
of that ravine before dawn, but he dared not take the time now. His
eyes burned from lack of sleep and moments of giddiness assailed
him, but the fire of his driving energy burned fiercer than ever.
He urged the priest to greater and greater speed until sweat
dripped like water from the man's trembling limbs.</p>

<p>"He'll practically have to drag the girl. She'll fight him every
step of the way. And he'll have to beat the monk every now and then
to make him point out the right path. We ought to be gaining on
them at every step."</p>

<p>Full dawn found them climbing a ledge that pitched up around a
gigantic shoulder where the wind staggered them. Then, off to the
left, sounded a sudden rattle of rifle fire. The wind brought it in
snatches. Gordon turned, loosing his binoculars. They were high
above the ridges and hills that rimmed the valley.</p>

<p>He could see Yolgan in the distance, like a huddle of toy
blocks. He could see the gorges that debouched into the valley
spread out like the fingers of a hand. He saw the gorge in which
his Turkomans had taken refuge. Black dots which he knew were men
were scattered among the boulders at the canyon mouth and up on the
rims of the walls; tiny white puffs spurted.</p>

<p>Even before he brought his glasses into play he knew that the
pursuing Kirghiz had at last smelled his men out. The Turkomans
were bottled in the gorge. He saw puffs of smoke jetting from the
rocks that from the mountainside overhung the ravine leading out of
the canyon. Strings of dots moved out of the gates of Yolgan, which
were men coming to investigate the shooting. Doubtless the Kirghiz
had sent riders to bring the men of the city.</p>

<p>Yogok shrieked and fell down flat on the ledge. Gordon felt his
cap tugged from his head as if by an invisible hand, and there came
to him the flat sharp crack of a rifle.</p>

<p>He dropped behind a boulder and began scanning the narrow,
sheer- walled plateau upon which the ledge debouched. Presently a
head and part of a shoulder rose above a shelf of rock, and then a
rifle came up and spoke flatly. The bullet knocked a chip out of
the boulder near Gordon's elbow.</p>

<p>Ormond had been making even poorer time than Gordon hoped, and
seeing his pursuers gaining, had turned to make a fight of it. That
he recognized Gordon was evident from his mocking shouts. There was
a hint of hysteria in them.</p>

<p>Yogok was too helpless with terror to do anything but hug the
ledge and moan. Gordon began working his way toward the Englishman.
Evidently Ormond did not know that he had no firearm. The sun was
not yet above the peaks when it turned to fire, and the light and
atmosphere of those altitudes make for uncertain shooting.</p>

<p>Ormond blazed away as Gordon flitted from ridge to boulder and
from rock to ledge, and sometimes his lead whispered perilously
close. But Gordon was gliding ever nearer, working his way so that
the sun would be behind him when it rose. Something about that
silent shadowy figure that he could not hit began to shake Ormond's
nerve; it was more like being stalked by a leopard than by a human
being.</p>

<p>Gordon could not see Yasmeena, but presently he saw the monk.
The man took advantage of a moment when Ormond was loading his
rifle. He sprang up from behind the ledge with his hands tied
behind his back, and scudded across the rock like a rabbit. Ormond,
like a man gone mad, jerked a pistol and put a bullet between his
shoulders, and he stumbled and slid screaming over the
thousand-foot edge.</p>

<p>Gordon broke cover, too, and came ripping across the treacherous
rock like a gust of hill wind. As he came the sun burst up over a
ridge behind him, full in Ormond's eyes. The Englishman yelled
incoherently, trying to shade his eyes with his left arm, and began
firing half blindly. The bullets ripped past Gordon's head or
knocked up splinters of stone at his speeding feet. Panic had
Ormond, and he was firing without proper aim.</p>

<p>Then the hammer clicked on an empty chamber. Another stride and
Gordon would reach him with that hovering arc of steel that the sun
turned crimson. Ormond hurled the pistol blindly, yelling "You
damned werewolf! I'll cheat you yet!" and bounded far out, arms
outspread.</p>

<p>His feet struck the sloping lip of a fissure and he shot down
and vanished so suddenly it was like the unreality of a dream.</p>

<p>Gordon reached the crevice and glared down into echoing
darkness. He could see nothing, but the chasm seemed bottomless.
With an angry shrug he turned away, disappointed.</p>

<p>Behind the stony shelf Gordon found Yasmeena lying with her arms
bound, where Ormond had flung her down. Her soft slippers hung in
tatters, and the bruises and abrasions on her tender flesh told of
Ormond's brutal attempts to force her at top speed along the rocky
path.</p>

<p>Gordon cut her cords and she caught his arms with all her old
fierceness of passion. There was no fear in her eyes now, only wild
excitement.</p>

<p>"They said you were dead!" she cried. "I knew they lied! They
cannot kill you any more than they can kill the mountains or the
wind that blows across them. You have Yogok. I saw him. He knows
the secret paths better than the monk Ormond killed. Let us go,
while the Kirghiz are killing the Turkomans! What if we have no
supplies? It is summer. We shall not freeze. We can starve for a
while if need be. Let us go!"</p>

<p>"I brought those men to Yolgan with me for my own purposes,
Yasmeena," he replied. "Even for you I can't desert them."</p>

<p>She nodded her splendid head. "I expected that from you, El
Borak."</p>

<p>Ormond's rifle lay nearby but there were no cartridges for it.
He cast it over the precipice and, taking Yasmeena's hand, led her
back to the ledge where Yogok lay yammering.</p>

<p>Gordon hauled him erect and pointed to the gorge where the white
puffs spurted.</p>

<p>"Is there a way to reach that gorge without returning to the
valley? Your life depends on it."</p>

<p>"Half these gorges have hidden exits," answered Yogok,
shivering. "That one has. But I cannot guide you along that route
with my arms tied."</p>

<p>Gordon unbound his hands, but tied the girdle about the priest's
waist and retained the other end in his hand. "Lead on," he
ordered.</p>

<p>Yogok led them back along the ledge they had just traversed to a
point where, halfway along it, it was cut by a great natural
causeway of solid stone. They made their way along it, with dizzy
depths echoing on either hand, to a broad ledge which skirted a
deep canyon. They followed this ledge around a colossal crag and
after a while Yogok plunged into a cave which opened upon the
narrow path.</p>

<p>This they traversed in semidarkness relieved by light which
filtered in from a ragged crevice in the roof. The cave wound
steeply downward, following a fault in the rock, and they came out
at last in a triangular cleft between towering walls. The narrow
slit which was the cave mouth opened in a side of the cleft and was
masked from outer view by a spur of rock that looked like part of a
solid wall. Gordon had looked into that cleft the day before and
failed to discover the cave.</p>

<p>The sound of firing had grown louder as they advanced along the
twisting cave, and now it filled the defile with thundering echoes.
They were in the gorge of the Turkomans. Gordon saw the wiry
warriors crouching among the boulders at the mouth, firing at the
fur-capped heads which appeared among the rocks of the outer
slopes.</p>

<p>He shouted before they saw him, and they nearly shot him before
they recognized him. He went toward them, dragging Yogok with him,
and the warriors stared in silent amazement at the shivering priest
and the girl in her tattered finery. She scarcely noticed them;
they were wolves whose fangs she did not fear; all her attention
was centered on Gordon. When a bullet whined near her she did not
flinch.</p>

<p>Men crouched at the mouth of the ravine, firing into it. Bullets
hummed back up the gut.</p>

<p>"They stole up in the darkness," grunted Orkhan, binding up a
bleeding bullet hole in his forearm. "They had the gorge mouth
surrounded before our sentries saw them. They cut the throat of the
sentry we had stationed down the ravine and came stealing up it.
Had not others in the gorge seen them and opened fire, they would
have cut all our throats while we slept. Aye, they were like cats
that see in the dark. What shall we do, El Borak? We are trapped.
We cannot climb these walls. There is the spring, and grass for the
horses and we have slept, but we have no food left and our
ammunition will not last forever."</p>

<p>Gordon took a yataghan from one of the men and handed it to
Yasmeena.</p>

<p>"Watch Yogok," he directed. "Stab him if he seeks to
escape."</p>

<p>And from the flash of her eyes he knew that she at last realized
the value of direct action in its proper place, and that she would
not hesitate to carry out his order. Yogok looked like a singed
serpent in his fury, but he feared Yasmeena as much as he did
Gordon.</p>

<p>El Borak collected a rifle and a handful of cartridges on his
way to the boulder-strewn gorge mouth. Three Turkomans lay dead
among the rocks and others were wounded. The Kirghiz were working
their way up the outer slope on foot from rock to rock, trying to
get in to close quarters where their superior numbers would count,
but not willing to sacrifice too many lives to get there. Up from
the city a ragged line of men was streaming through the pines.</p>

<p>"We've got to get out of this trap before the monks come up with
the Kirghiz and lead them up in the hills and down through that
cave," Gordon muttered.</p>

<p>He could see them already toiling up the first ridges of the
hills, shouting frantically to the tribesmen as they came. Working
in fierce haste he told off half a dozen men on the best horses,
and mounting Yogok and Yasmeena on spare steeds, he ordered the
priest to lead the Turkomans back through the cave. To Orkhan Shah
he gave instructions to follow Yasmeena's orders, and so imbued
with trust was the Turkoman that he made no objections to obeying a
woman.</p>

<p>Three of the men remaining with him Gordon stationed at the
ravine, and with the other three he held the mouth of the canyon.
They began firing as the others urged their horses down the defile.
The men on the lower slopes sensed that the volleys were
diminishing and came storming up the acclivities, only to take
cover again as they were swept by a hail of lead, the deadly
accuracy of which made up for its lack of volume. Gordon's presence
heartened his men and they put new spirit in their rifle work.</p>

<p>When the last rider had disappeared into the cleft, Gordon
waited until he thought the fugitives had time enough to traverse
the winding cave, and then he fell back swiftly, picked up the men
at the ravine, and raced for the hidden exit. The men outside
suspected a trap in the sudden cessation of the firing, and they
held back for long minutes, during which time Gordon and his men
were galloping through the twisting cavern, their hoofs filling the
narrow gut with thunder.</p>

<p>The others awaited them on the ledge skirting the ravine and
Gordon sent them hurrying on. He cursed because he could not be at
two places at once&mdash;at the head of the column bullying Yogok,
and at the rear watching for the first of the pursuers to ride out
on the ledge. But Yasmeena, flourishing the knife at the priest's
throat, was guarantee against treachery at the front. She had sworn
to sink the blade in his breast if the Kirghiz came within rifle
range, and Yogok sweated with fear and himself urged the band
onward.</p>

<p>They moved around the corner of the crag and out across the
ridge, a knife-edged causeway half a mile in length, with a sheet
of rock slanting steeply down for a thousand feet on either
hand.</p>

<p>Gordon waited alone at the angle of the ledge. When his party
was moving like insects along the crest of the ridge, the first of
the Kirghiz came racing out on the ledge. Sitting his horse behind
a jutting spur of rock, Gordon lined his sights carefully and
fired. It was a long range, even for him; so long that he missed
the first rider and hit the horse instead.</p>

<p>The stricken beast reared high, screaming, and plunged backward.
The screams and plunges of the maddened animal, before it toppled
over the edge, put the horses in confusion behind it. Three more
got out of control and were carried over the cliff with their
riders, and the other Kirghiz retreated into the cave. After a
while they tried again, but a bullet spattering on the rock sent
them scurrying back.</p>

<p>A glance over his shoulder showed Gordon his horsemen just
dropping off the ridge onto the farther ledge. He reined about and
sent his horse flying along the path. If he loitered, the Kirghiz
might venture out again, find no one opposing them, and reach the
bend of the trail in time to pick him off the causeway.</p>

<p>Most of his hardened band had dismounted, leading their horses
at a walk. Gordon rode at a gallop with death yawning on either
hand if the horse slipped or put a single foot wrong. But the beast
was sure- footed as a mountain sheep.</p>

<p>Gordon's head swam from lack of sleep as he glanced down into
the blue haze of the abyss, but he did not slacken his pace. When
he dropped down the slope onto the ledge where Yasmeena stood,
white-faced and her nails biting into her pink palms, the Kirghiz
had not yet appeared.</p>

<p>Gordon pushed his riders as hard as he dared, making them from
time to time change to the spare horses, to save the animals as
much as possible. Nearly a dozen of these still remained. Many of
the men were giddy with dizziness caused by hunger and the
altitude. He himself was mad for sleep and kept himself awake only
by an effort of will that made the hills reel to his gaze.</p>

<p>He kept his grip on clarity of purpose as only a man toughened
by a savagely hard life can do, and led them on, following the
paths Yogok pointed out. They skirted ledges that hovered over
ravines the bottoms of which were lost in shadowy gloom. They
plunged through defiles like a knife cut where sheer walls rose up
to the skies on either hand.</p>

<p>Behind them from time to time they heard faint yells, and once,
when they toiled up over the shoulder of a breathtaking crag on a
path where the horses fought for footing, they saw their pursuers
far below and behind them. The Kirghiz and monks were not
maintaining such a suicidal pace; hate is seldom as desperate as
the will to live.</p>

<p>The snowy crest of Mount Erlik loomed higher and higher before
them, and Yogok, when questioned, swore that the way to safety lay
through the mountain. More he would not say; he was green with
fear, and his mind held to but one thought&mdash;to keep the trail
that would buy his life. He feared his captors no more than he
feared that his pursuing subjects would overtake them and learn of
his duplicity in regard to their goddess.</p>

<p>They pushed on like men already dead, beginning to stagger with
weakness and exhaustion. The horses drooped and stumbled. The wind
was like whetted steel. Darkness was gathering when they followed
the backbone of a giant ridge which ran like a natural causeway to
the sheer slope of Mount Erlik Khan.</p>

<p>The mountain towered gigantically above them, a brutish mass of
crags and dizzy escarpments and colossal steeps, with the snow-clad
pinnacle, glimpsed between the great spurs, dominating all. The
ridge ended at a ledge high up among the cliffs, and in the sheer
rock there stood a bronze door, thickly carved with inscriptions
that Gordon could not decipher. It was heavy enough to have
resisted an attack of artillery.</p>

<p>"This is sacred to Erlik," said Yogok, but he showed about as
much reverence as one of the Mohammedans. "Push against the door.
Nay; fear not. On my life, there is no trap."</p>

<p>"On your life it is," Gordon assured him grimly, and himself set
a shoulder to the door, almost falling as he dismounted.</p>
<br>

<h2><a id="daughter10" name="daughter10">CHAPTER 10</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE ponderous portal swung inward with a
smoothness that showed the antique hinges had recently been oiled.
A makeshift torch revealed the entrance to a tunnel, cut in solid
rock. A few feet from the door the tunnel opened out like the neck
of a bottle, and the flickering torch, held at the entrance, only
hinted at the vastness of its dimensions.</p>

<p>"This tunnel runs clear through the mountain," said Yogok. "By
dawn we can be out of reach of those who follow, because even if
they climb over the mountain by the most direct route, they must go
by foot and it will take them all the rest of the night and all of
another day. If they skirt the mountain and work their way through
the passes of the surrounding hills, it will take them even longer;
and their horses are weary, too.</p>

<p>"That is the way I was going to guide Ormond. I was not going to
take him through the mountain. But it is the only way of escape for
you. There is food here. At certain seasons of the year the monks
work here. In that cell there are lamps."</p>

<p>He pointed to a small chamber cut in the rock just inside the
doorway. Gordon lighted several of the butter lamps, and gave them
to the Turkomans to carry. He dared not follow the course which
caution suggested and ride ahead to investigate before he led his
men into the tunnel. The pursuers were too close behind them. He
must bar the big door and plunge on, trusting the priest's desire
to save his own skin.</p>

<p>When the men were all in the tunnel, Yogok directed the barring
of the door&mdash;giant bronze bars, thick as a man's leg. It took
half a dozen of the weakened Turkomans to lift one, but once they
were in place, Gordon was certain that nothing short of siege guns
could force the ton-heavy door, with its massive bronze sills and
jambs set deep in the living rock.</p>

<p>He made Yogok ride between him and Orkhan, the Turkoman holding
a lamp. There was no use trusting Yogok, even though the priest was
getting some satisfaction out of the thought that he was at least
ridding himself of the 'goddess' he feared and hated, although it
meant foregoing his vengeance on her.</p>

<p>Even with all his faculties occupied in a savage battle to keep
from falling senseless with exhaustion, Gordon found space to be
amazed at what the light showed him. He had never dreamed of the
existence of such a place. Thirty men could have ridden abreast in
the cavernlike passage, and the roof soared out of sight in some
places; in others stalactites reflected the light in a thousand
scintillant colors.</p>

<p>The floors and walls were as even as man-shaped marble, and
Gordon wondered how many centuries had been required for the
hand-cutting and smoothing of them. Cells appeared at irregular
intervals, cut in the rock at the sides, and presently he saw marks
of pick work, and then caught glints of dull yellow.</p>

<p>The light showed him the incredible truth. The tales of Mount
Erlik Khan were true. The walls were patterned with veins of gold
that could be dug out of the rock with a knife point.</p>

<p>The Turkomans, who smelled loot as vultures smell carrion, woke
suddenly out of their daze of fatigue and began to take an almost
painfully intense interest.</p>

<p>"This is where the monks get their gold, sahib," said Orkhan,
his eyes blazing in the lamplight. "Let me twist the old one's toe
for a space, and he will tell us where they have hidden that which
they have dug out of the walls."</p>

<p>But 'the old one' did not need persuasion. He pointed out a
square- hewn chamber in which stood stacks of peculiarly shaped
objects that were ingots of virgin gold. In other, larger cells
were the primitive contrivances with which they smelted the ore and
cast the metal.</p>

<p>"Take what ye will," said Yogok indifferently. "A thousand
horses could not carry away the gold we have cast and stored, and
we have scarcely dipped into the richness of the veins."</p>

<p>Thin lips were licked greedily, drooping mustaches twisted in
emotion, and eyes that burned like hawks' were turned questioningly
on Gordon.</p>

<p>"Ye have spare horses," he suggested, and that was enough for
them.</p>

<p>After that nothing could have convinced them that everything
which had passed had not been planned by Gordon in order to lead
them to the gold which was the plunder he had promised them. They
loaded the extra ponies until he interfered, to save the animals'
strength. Then they hacked off chunks of the soft gold and stuffed
their pouches and belts and girdles, and even so they had scarcely
diminished the stacks. Some of the raiders lifted up their voices
and wept when they saw how much they must leave behind.</p>

<p>"Assuredly," they promised each other, "we shall return with
wagons and many horses and secure every crumb of it,
<i>inshallah</i>!"</p>

<p>"Dogs!" swore Gordon. "Ye have each man a fortune beyond your
dreams. Are ye jackals to feast on carrion until your bellies
burst? Will ye loiter here until the Kirghiz cross the mountain and
cut us off? What of the gold then, you crop-eared rogues?"</p>

<p>Of more interest to the American was a cell where barley was
stored in leather sacks, and he made the tribesmen load some of the
horses with food instead of gold. They grumbled, but they obeyed
him. They would obey him now, if he ordered them to ride with him
into Jehannum.</p>

<p>Every nerve in his body shrieked for sleep, submerging hunger;
but he gnawed a handful of raw barley and flogged his failing
powers with the lash of his driving will. Yasmeena drooped in her
saddle wearily, but her eyes shone unclouded in the lamplight, and
Gordon was dully aware of a deep respect for her that dwarfed even
his former admiration.</p>

<p>They rode on through that glittering, dream-palace cavern, the
tribesmen munching barley and babbling ecstatically of the joys
their gold would buy, and at last they came to a bronze door which
was a counterpart of the one at the other end of the tunnel. It was
not barred. Yogok maintained that none but the monks had visited
Mount Erlik in centuries. The door swung inward at their efforts
and they blinked in the glow of a white dawn.</p>

<p>They were looking out on a small ledge from which a narrow trail
wound along the edge of a giant escarpment. On one side the land
fell away sheer for thousands of feet, so that a stream at the
bottom looked like a thread of silver, and on the other a sheer
cliff rose for some five hundred feet.</p>

<p>The cliff limited the view to the left, but to the right Gordon
could see some of the mountains which flanked Mount Erlik Khan, and
the valley far below them wandered southward away to a pass in the
distance, a notch in the savage rampart of the hills.</p>

<p>"This is life for you, El Borak," said Yogok, pointing to the
pass. "Three miles from the spot where we now stand this trail
leads down into the valley where there is water and game and rich
grass for the horses. You can follow it southward beyond the pass
for three days' journey when you will come into country you know
well. It is inhabited by marauding tribes, but they will not attack
a party as large as yours. You can be through the pass before the
Kirghiz round the mountain, and they will not follow you through
it. That is the limit of their country. Now let me go."</p>

<p>"Not yet; I'll release you at the pass. You can make your way
back here easily and wait for the Kirghiz, and tell them any lie
you want to about the goddess."</p>

<p>Yogok glared angrily at Gordon. The American's eyes were
bloodshot, the skin stretched taut over the bones of his face. He
looked like a man who had been sweated in hell's fires, and he felt
the same way. There was no reason for Yogok's strident objections,
except a desire to get out of the company of those he hated as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>In Gordon's state a man reverts to primitive instincts, and the
American held his thrumming nerves in an iron grip to keep from
braining the priest with his gun butt. Dispute and importunities
were like screaming insults to his struggling brain.</p>

<p>While the priest squawked, and Gordon hesitated between
reasoning with him or knocking him down, the Turkomans, inspired by
the gold and food, and eager for the trail, began to crowd past
him. Half a dozen had emerged on the ledge when Gordon noticed
them, and ordering Orkhan to bring Yogok along, he rode past those
on the ledge, intending to take the lead as usual. But one of the
men was already out to the path, and could neither turn back nor
hug the wall close enough to let Gordon by.</p>

<p>The American, perforce, called to him to go ahead, and he would
follow, and even as Gordon set his horse to the trail a volley of
boulders came thundering down from above. They hit the wretched
Turkoman and swept him and his horse off the trail as a broom
sweeps a spider from a wall. One of the stones, bouncing from the
ledge, hit Gordon's horse and broke its leg, and the beast screamed
and toppled over the side after the other.</p>

<p>Gordon threw himself clear as it fell, landed half over the
edge, and clawed a desperate way to safety with Yasmeena's screams
and the yells of the Turkomans ringing in his ears. There was
nothing seen to shoot at, but some of them loosed their rifles
anyway, and the volley was greeted by a wild peal of mocking
laughter from the cliffs above.</p>

<p>In no way unnerved by his narrow escape, Gordon drove his men
back into the shelter of the cave. They were like wolves in a trap,
ready to strike blind right and left, and a dozen tulwars hovered
over Yogok's head.</p>

<p>"Slay him! He has led us into a trap! Allah!"</p>

<p>Yogok's face was a green, convulsed mask of fear. He squalled
like a tortured cat.</p>

<p>"Nay! I led you swift and sure! The Kirghiz could not have
reached this side of the mountain by this time!"</p>

<p>"Were there monks hiding in these cells?" asked Gordon. "They
could have sneaked out when they saw us coming in. Is that a monk
up there?"</p>

<p>"Nay; as Erlik is my witness! We work the gold three moons a
year; at other times it is death to go near Mount Erlik. I know not
who it is."</p>

<p>Gordon ventured out on the path again and was greeted by another
shower of stones, which he barely avoided, and a voice yelled high
above him:</p>

<p>"You Yankee dog, how do you like that? I've got you now, damn
you! Thought I was done for when I fell into that fissure, didn't
you? Well, there was a ledge a few feet down that I landed on. You
couldn't see it because the sun wasn't high enough to shine down
into it. If I'd had a gun I'd have killed you when you looked down.
I climbed out after you left."</p>

<p>"Ormond!" snarled Gordon.</p>

<p>"Did you think I hadn't wormed anything out of that monk?" the
Englishman yelled. "He told me all about the paths and Mount Erlik
after I'd caved in some of his teeth with a gun barrel. I saw old
Yogok with you and knew he'd lead you to Erlik. I got here first.
I'd have barred the door and locked you out to be butchered by the
fellows who're chasing you, but I couldn't lift the bars. But
anyway, I've got you trapped. You can't leave the cave; if you do
I'll mash you like insects on the path. I can see you on it, and
you can't see me. I'm going to keep you here until the Kirghiz come
up. I've still got Yasmeena's symbol. They'll listen to me.</p>

<p>"I'll tell them Yogok is helping you to kidnap her; they'll kill
you all except her. They'll take her back, but I don't care now. I
don't need that Kashmiri's money. I've got the secret of Mount
Erlik Khan!"</p>

<p>Gordon fell back into the doorway and repeated what the
Englishman had said. Yogok turned a shade greener in his fear, and
all stared silently at El Borak. His bloodshot gaze traveled over
them as they stood blinking, disheveled, and haggard, with lamps
paled by the dawn, like ghouls caught above earth by daybreak.
Grimly he marshaled his straying wits. Gordon had never reached the
ultimate limits of his endurance; always he had plumbed a deeper,
hidden reservoir of vitality below what seemed the last.</p>

<p>"Is there another way out of here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Yogok shook his head, chattering again with terror. "No way that
men and horses can go."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>The priest moved back into the darkness and held a lamp close to
the flank of the wall where the tunnel narrowed for the entrance.
Rusty bits of metal jutted from the rock.</p>

<p>"Here was once a ladder," he said. "It led far up to a crevice
in the wall where long ago one sat to watch the southern pass for
invaders. But none has climbed it for many years, and the handholds
are rusty and rotten. The crevice opens on the sheer of the outer
cliffs, and even if a man reached it, he could scarcely climb down
the outside."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe I can pick Ormond off from the crevice," muttered
Gordon, his head swimming with the effort of thinking.</p>

<p>Standing still was making infinitely harder his fight to keep
awake. The muttering of the Turkomans was a meaningless tangle of
sound, and Yasmeena's dark anxious eyes seemed to be looking at him
from a vast distance. He thought he felt her arms cling to him
briefly, but could not be sure. The lights were beginning to swim
in a thick mist.</p>

<p>Beating himself into wakefulness by striking his own face with
his open hand, he began to climb, a rifle slung to his back. Orkhan
was plucking at him, begging to be allowed to make the attempt in
his stead, but Gordon shook him off. In his dazed brain was a
conviction that the responsibility was his own. He went up like an
automaton, slowly, all his muddled faculties concentrating grimly
on the task.</p>

<p>Fifty feet up, the light of the lamps ceased to aid him, and he
groped upward in the gloom, feeling for the rusty bolts set in the
wall. They were so rotten that he dared not put his full weight on
any one of them. In some places they were missing and he clung with
his fingers in the niches where they had been. Only the slant of
the rock enabled him to accomplish the climb at all, and it seemed
endless, a hell-born eternity of torture.</p>

<p>The lamps below him were like fireflies in the darkness, and the
roof with its clustering stalactites was only a few yards above his
head. Then he saw a gleam of light, and an instant later he was
crouching in a cleft that opened on the outer air. It was only a
couple of yards wide, and not tall enough for a man to stand
upright.</p>

<p>He crawled along it for some thirty feet and then looked out on
a rugged slant that pitched down to a crest of cliffs, a hundred
feet below. He could not see the ledge where the door opened, nor
the path that led from it, but he saw a figure crouching among the
boulders along the lip of the cliff, and he unslung his rifle.</p>

<p>Ordinarily he could not have missed at that range. But his
bloodshot eyes refused to line the sights. Slumber never assails a
weary man so fiercely as in the growing light of dawn. The figure
among the rocks below merged and blended fantastically with the
scenery, and the sights of the rifle were mere blurs.</p>

<p>Setting his teeth, Gordon pulled the trigger, and the bullet
smashed on the rock a foot from Ormond's head. The Englishman dived
out of sight among the boulders.</p>

<p>In desperation Gordon slung his rifle and threw a leg over the
lip of the cleft. He was certain that Ormond had no firearm. Down
below the Turkomans were clamoring like a wolf pack, but his numbed
faculties were fully occupied with the task of climbing down the
ribbed pitch. He stumbled and fumbled and nearly fell, and at last
he did slip and came sliding and tumbling down until his rifle
caught on a projection and held him dangling by the strap.</p>

<p>In a red mist he saw Ormond break cover, with a tulwar that he
must have found in the cavern, and in a panic lest the Englishman
climb up and kill him as he hung helplessly, Gordon braced his feet
and elbows against the rock and wrenched savagely, breaking the
rifle strap. He plunged down like a plummet, hit the slope, clawed
at rocks and knobs, and brought up on shelving stone a dozen feet
from the cliff edge, while his rifle, tumbling before him, slid
over and was gone.</p>

<p>The fall jolted his numbed nerves back into life again, knocked
some of the cobwebs out of his dizzy brain. Ormond was within a few
steps of him when he scrambled up, drawing his scimitar. The
Englishman was as savage and haggard in appearance as was Gordon,
and his eyes blazed with a frenzy that almost amounted to
madness.</p>

<p>"Steel to steel now, El Borak!" Ormond gritted. "We'll see if
you're the swordsman they say you are!"</p>

<p>Ormond came with a rush and Gordon met him, fired above his
exhaustion by his hate and the stinging frenzy of battle. They
fought back and forth along the cliff edge, with a foot to spare
between them and eternity sometimes, until the clangor of the
swords wakened the eagles to shrill hysteria.</p>

<p>Ormond fought like a wild man, yet with all the craft the sword
masters of his native England had taught him. Gordon fought as he
had learned to fight in grim and merciless battles in the hills and
the steppes and the deserts. He fought as an Afghan fights, with
the furious intensity of onslaught that gathers force like a rising
hurricane as it progresses.</p>

<p>Beating on his blade like a smith on an anvil, Gordon drove the
Englishman staggering before him, until the man swayed dizzily with
his heels over the edge of the cliff.</p>

<p>"Swine!" gasped Ormond with his last breath, and spat in his
enemy's face and slashed madly at his head.</p>

<p>"This for Ahmed!" roared Gordon, and his scimitar whirled past
Ormond's blade and crunched home.</p>

<p>The Englishman reeled outward, his features suddenly blotted out
by blood and brains, and pitched backward into the gulf without a
sound.</p>

<p>Gordon sat down on a boulder, suddenly aware of the quivering of
his leg muscles. He sat there, his gory blade across his knees and
his head sunk in his hands, his brain a black blank, until shouts
welling up from below roused him to consciousness.</p>

<p>"Ohai, El Borak! A man with a cleft head has fallen past us into
the valley! Art thou safe? We await orders!"</p>

<p>He lifted his head and glanced at the sun which was just rising
over the eastern peaks, turning to crimson flame the snow of Mount
Erlik Khan. He would have traded all the gold of the monks of
Yolgan to be allowed to lie down and sleep for an hour, and
climbing up on his stiffened legs that trembled with his weight was
a task of appalling magnitude. But his labor was not yet done;
there was no rest for him this side of the pass.</p>

<p>Summoning the shreds of strength, he shouted down to the
raiders.</p>

<p>"Get upon the horses and ride, sons of nameless dogs! Follow the
trail and I will come along the cliff. I see a place beyond the
next bend where I can climb down to the trail. Bring Yogok with
you; he has earned his release, but the time is not yet."</p>

<p>"Hurry, El Borak," floated up Yasmeena's golden call. "It is far
to Delhi, and many mountains lie between!"</p>

<p>Gordon laughed and sheathed his scimitar, and his laugh sounded
like the ghastly mirth of a hyena; below him the Turkomans had
taken the road and were already singing a chant improvised in his
honor, naming 'Son of the Sword' the man who staggered along the
cliffs above them, with a face like a grinning skull and feet that
left smears of blood on the rock.<br></p>
