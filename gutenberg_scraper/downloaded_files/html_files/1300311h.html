<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<br>
<p>Living as we do in the age of democracies with their
institutions ever growing and undergoing modification, but withal
rooted in the past, it seems essential that the schools&mdash;the
training ground of our future citizens&mdash;should realise to
the full their responsibility to the society in whose midst they
flourish, and should anticipate the day when their present
scholars will receive the full rights and obligations of
citizenship. This relation of the school to society has been
largely recognised of late years, and school curricula have been
accordingly modified in both the primary and secondary
departments. Not only have the industrial and commercial
requirements of the community been kept in view, but definite
instruction has been given in subjects of a more directly civic
significance. Lessons in history and lessons on the public
institutions of our own country have been given largely in
relation to one another. In this way a dynamic as well as a
static view of society is being developed. A democratic people
cannot afford to disregard the study of the foundations and
erection of its institutions if it hopes to comprehend them in
their present form. A desire to assist towards a more intelligent
and potent citizenship&mdash;the outcome of more thoroughly
organised knowledge&mdash;leads me to otter this account of the
origins, growth and present characteristics of Australian
political institutions.</p>
<p>It is not expected that the younger pupils of our schools
should read this book. It suffices that they are enjoying some
form or other of concrete civic instruction in reproducing public
institutions in their own school and class organisations, and in
listening to stories about Englishmen who struggled and died in
the cause of freedom, and Australians who worked zealously for
the constitutional emancipation and dignity of their country.
This is an admirable preparation for a more formal study of
constitutional machinery. It is as a first course in such a
formal study that this work is intended. The youth of the upper
secondary school, about to launch out from the shelter of the
school into the broad open sea of life, has developed a fund of
historical knowledge sufficient to engender a keen interest in
public institutions and political questions. Experience leads one
to believe that youths of from sixteen to eighteen years of age
have as intelligent a grasp of such subjects as the average
adult, particularly as they have the advantage of the guiding
hand of a specially equipped teacher. Probably too, teachers and
more advanced students, as well as the general reader, may find
some attraction and value in the book. But no attempt is made to
meet the requirements of those whose interest and business it is
to examine with any thoroughness the nature and details of our
federal constitution. This class of student must have recourse to
more complete and formal treatises such as Quick and Garran's
<i>Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth</i>.</p>
<p>In order to encourage comparative methods of study and give a
more thorough grasp of the principles underlying our own
constitution and a greater appreciation of the statesmanship at
work in its drafting, the general features of other federal
constitutions have been outlined. A study of ancient and
mediaeval federations may serve to emphasise the greater
elaboration and finer workmanship of modern federal machinery.
The appendices will allow direct reference to original authority
and practically indicate some of the sources of the historian's
information. They may be passed over by those who desire an
uninterrupted account of constitutional progress. Chapter X.,
though political rather than constitutional, will yet serve to
show the constitutional machinery at work, and perhaps give
fuller meaning to the preceding chapters on Australia.</p>
<p>It gives me much pleasure to acknowledge my great indebtedness
to Professor Wood, M.A., of the University of Sydney, who read
through the manuscript and has honoured my work by contributing
the introductory chapter. I am also under obligation to Mr. J. D.
St. Clair Maclardy, M.A., Chief Examiner, Department of Public
Instruction, Mr. W. J. Elliott, M.A., Inspector of Secondary
Schools, and Mr. A. W. Jose, for their careful perusal of the
manuscript; to Mr. J. Garlick, Officer-in-charge, Local
Government Department, who read the section on Local Government;
to Mr. H. Wright, Curator of the Mitchell Library, who smoothed
my way in the matter of illustrations; to Mr. F. Walsh,
Parliamentary Librarian, for help in sundry ways, and especially
to my wife, whose assistance, criticisms and reading of the
proofs have been a material factor in the production of this
little work.</p>
<p>In conclusion, may I express the hope that the book will
assist towards the development of a well-informed and intelligent
Australian sentiment, not antagonistic to, but rather enriching,
an equally well-informed and rational Imperialism.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<br>
<p>The political story of Australia is not an obviously
interesting story. Great things have happened, but they have
happened gradually, and without observation. There have been no
wars of conquest, for a handful of people were dowered with a
continent; no wars of defence, for the continent was protected by
the fleet of Nelson; no racial conflict, for the people were as
entirely British as the people of the British Isles. The great
battles of freedom had been already fought and won before
Australia came of age. The principles of Democracy and Liberty,
of Colonial Home Rule and Responsible Government, had been
recognised as essential principles of British civilisation.
Australians had not to fight; they had only to ask, and to argue.
There were mistakes and delays and friction; but in general,
Australia got the full privileges of British citizenship as soon
as Australia was ready to use them with advantage to herself. Our
story has not been the story of a people striving to be free. It
has been the story of an infant society gradually growing into
the freedom that was recognised to be its natural birthright.</p>
<p>The interest of a story of this sort does not lie on the
surface. We miss the great battles for great causes; the heroisms
and the martyrdoms; the inspiration of the lives of famous men.
And yet the interest of human things is in our story of the
gradual evolution of a little British society learning at the
ends of the earth to live the British life in the midst of
unprecedented difficulties. The story begins in the depths of the
Nether World. It is as if a deliberate experiment was being tried
to test the quality of the British race in the most unfavourable
circumstances that could be invented. We have the careful
selection of the unfit, a society of criminals and the government
of a prison. Then, very gradually, change and progress begin.
Free colonists arrive. Criminals become emancipists. The first
generation passes and gradually a homogenous British society is
formed. British ideas find political expression. Despotism
becomes limited and tempered by growing respect to Public
Opinion. Martial Law gives way to the Jury. The Press becomes
free. The Governor is instructed to act with a Council of
Notables. To these, at a later date, are added a majority of
elected representatives of the people, and at last a constitution
is established by which the colonists obtained full rights of
self-government.</p>
<p>And meanwhile great things have happened. The huge unknown
continent of the South has been conquered by the explorer and the
pioneer. War has been waged, not with men but with nature: and no
war ever waged has made more demand on human courage, endurance,
self-reliance, sagacity. One by one new colonies have been
founded, at points so far distant that they have been virtually
islands in the midst of the sea of bushland, each with its
distinct interests, customs and institutions.</p>
<p>Then these colonies are drawn together. They are conscious of
common origin and race, of common ideas and institutions, of
common interests and aims. They realise that they are tiny
garrisons holding the immense frontier of the white world in face
of Asia. They wish to preserve the individuality of each colony.
But they wish to become united for those purposes which are
common to all. Their statesmen prove of calibre to solve one of
the most difficult and complex problems of practical politics.
And the Federal Constitution places a nation in possession of a
continent.</p>
<p>Such are the outlines of our political story. We miss in it
the fascination of great personal characters, the romance and
excitement of great personal exploits, the "crowded hour of
glorious life." It is the story, not of Individuals, but of the
Race: the story of the slow, patient, strenuous, enduring work of
generations of average British men and British women, intent on
doing the next thing, and on doing it well. No individual stands
distinct and conspicuous above the crowd. But the result of the
long day's work, when we survey it at the close and as a whole,
is one of the great exploits of the British Race.</p>
<p>In this little book, Mr. Cramp has essayed to draw the
outlines of this story in its constitutional aspect. In a study
of this aspect in isolation, much is of necessity sacrificed: for
the evolution of constitutional machinery is of little meaning
apart from a knowledge of the men who made the machinery and who
used it. But to one who has, by previous study, acquired some
good knowledge of general Australian history, there is great
interest and use in a renewed survey of the ground from the
constitutional point of view. To him each change in institutions
will be the expression of a change in the character and ideals of
the people; and in the story of the making of the Australian
Constitution he will read the story of the making of the
Australian Nation.</p>

<h3>Chapter I.<br>
<br>
CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN NEW SOUTH WALES.<br>
<br>
1788-1842.</h3>
<p>The story of the growth of self-government in the Australian
Colonies should be of considerable interest to all present and
prospective citizens of Australia. It affords instances of the
main types of British dependencies from the Crown Colony governed
more or less completely by the British Government, to the adult
and autonomous State connected with the Mother Country on terms
of almost complete equality. It also affords a valuable study of
the attempts to effect a reconciliation between the forces
signified in the phrase <i>Imperium et Libertas</i>. The problem
exercising the minds of British and colonial statesmen during the
nineteenth century, and still awaiting its ultimate solution, is
how to preserve the Imperial connection (<i>Imperium</i>) and at
the same time give the greatest possible measure of political
freedom (<i>Libertas</i>) to the colonies. The theory that
colonies drop away from the parent country like ripe fruit from a
tree upon reaching maturity made <i>Imperium</i> and
<i>Libertas</i> appear irreconcilable. On the whole, however,
British statesmen were convinced that such was not the case, and
the completeness of their convictions is reflected in the large
degree of liberty which the English Parliament has granted to her
colonies, within the last century. "Whilst continuing", said Lord
John Russell, in a despatch referring to the granting of
self-government to the Australian Colonies in 1855, "to pursue
their present independent course of progress and prosperity I
have the fullest confidence that they (<i>i.e.</i>, the Colonies)
will combine with it the jealous maintenance of ties thus
cemented alike by principle and feeling." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Parliamentary Papers 1855. <i>Cf</i>. Durham,
Report on Canada, pp. 229, 243, and Egerton Brit. Col. Policy,
pp. 4, 300-1; <i>Vide infra</i>, Chapter III. p. 54. Contrast the
views of another section who regarded the granting of political
freedom to the Colonies as a smoothing of the way to a separation
which, in their opinion, was in any case inevitable.]</p>
<p>In the development of full governmental powers in the
Australian Colonies there are, speaking generally, five main
stages. These stand out most clearly in the case of New South
Wales. We will therefore examine this development in the mother
colony in some detail, and content ourselves with a more general
survey of the modifications in the other States.</p>
<p>(I.) During the first period, extending from 1788 to 1823, New
South Wales was a Crown Colony of the extreme military type. It
was under the jurisdiction of a Governor who exercised
practically absolute powers. He was assisted by naval and
military officers.</p>
<p>(II.) From 1823 to 1842 the colony remained under Crown rule,
but this control was relaxed to the extent of allowing the
Governor a nominated Legislative Council with advisory
powers.</p>
<p>(III.) Between 1842 and 1856 partially Representative
Institutions were established, and the Legislative Council, which
had previously consisted entirely of nominees, now had a
proportion of its members elected by an enfranchised section of
the community.</p>
<p>(IV.) Since 1856 the people of the colony have exercised
control not only over the Legislature, but also through the
Legislature over the Executive. In other words. Responsible
Government has obtained since that year.</p>
<p>(V.) In 1901 New South Wales entered into a federal union with
the other States of Australia, and a further extension of the
privileges of self-government was granted to the central
authority.</p>
<p>We will now discuss these stages in detail.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b><small>THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE
COLONIES.</small></b></p>
<p>In 1784 the Imperial Parliament passed an New South Wales Act
"for the effectual transportation of felons and other offenders."
The Act authorised the Privy Council to appoint places for this
purpose, and accordingly two years later New South Wales was
designated such a place. New South Wales was defined to include
all Australia east of the 135th meridian of east longitude, Van
Diemen's Land, and the adjacent Pacific Islands. The Governor's
Commission did not grant him jurisdiction over the islands of New
Zealand; but as soon as British subjects settled there, a more or
less vague understanding arose that, if any authority was to be
exercised over the settlers, it should be exercised by the
Governor of New South Wales. In 1817 he was given jurisdiction
which allowed him to interfere when necessary between the British
settlers and the Maoris. But it was not till 1840 that New
Zealand became definitely a dependency of New South Wales, and
then for a few months only. Including New Zealand, the area ruled
over by the Governors of New South Wales exceeded one and a half
million square miles.</p>
<p>The western part of Australia remained unannexed for forty
years. In 1826 a small settlement was effected at King George's
Sound. In 1825 the western boundary of New South Wales was
shifted west to the 129th meridian. Four years later (1829) a
settlement was planted on the Swan River, and to this young
colony the control of the King George's Sound settlement was soon
transferred. Van Diemen's Land had by this time been proclaimed a
separate colony (1825). South Australia was carved out of New
South Wales territory in 1836, which was still further reduced by
the separation of New Zealand in 1841. This left New South Wales
with a peculiar territorial formation. To ascertain this, draw a
map of Australia and divide it into two parts at the 129th
meridian. Then insert the 132nd meridian from the Great
Australian Bight till it reaches the 26th parallel, proceed along
this parallel to the 141st meridian and then turn southwards till
the sea is reached. It will thus be seen that South Australia was
bordered on three sides&mdash;east, north and west&mdash;by New
South Wales, and that the latter colony then consisted of what
now constitutes the three eastern States, the Northern Territory
and a slice south of the 26th parallel wedged between South
Australia and Western Australia (<i>i.e.</i>, between the 129th
and 132nd meridians). This latter narrow and unpopulated slice
was so far removed from Sydney, the seat of Government, that it
was generally called "No Man's Land".</p>
<p>By the separation of Victoria in 1851 and Queensland in 1859,
the area of New South Wales was still further reduced. That part
which now constitutes the State was geographically cut off from
"No Man's Land" and the Northern Territory, which, however, still
retained their political connection with the parent colony.
Consequently a readjustment of boundaries was necessary, and
between the years 1861 and 1863 the two latter territories were
transferred to South Australia, and the western boundary of
Queensland was formed by the 141st meridian as far north as the
26th parallel, and thence by the 138th meridian. Previously it
had been the 141st meridian throughout.</p>
<p>Since 1863 no new colonies have been formed, but Papua became
a protectorate of Great Britain in 1884 and a Crown Colony
associated with Queensland in 1888. It was subsequently handed
over to the Commonwealth Government (1906) which has also more
recently (1911) secured from South Australia the control of the
Northern Territory. The boundary between South Australia and the
Northern Territory runs along the 26th parallel of south
latitude.</p>

<p>"The legislature makes, the executive executes and the
judiciary construes the law." * In the early years of the colony
all three functions were monopolised by the Governor. The
administrative powers were in his hands, though a few officials,
such as the Lieutenant-Governor and the Judge-Advocate, were
appointed and remunerated by the Home Government. These officials
were often consulted by the Governor, but apart from him had no
authority. They received their instructions from him, and were
subject to dismissal at his hands. The Governor also controlled
the finances and was thus virtually the Colonial Treasurer. It
was his duty to make the best use of the funds provided by the
British Government, for at this time the colony was financed by
England, and it was not till 1819 that limited powers to impose
local taxation in the shape of customs duties on spirit, tobacco,
and certain other imports were conferred on the Governor. The
Governors, however, had been accustomed to exercise a
questionable right to impose such duties, and an Act was passed
in that year to indemnify them for the illegality and to allow
the duties to be continued or discontinued at the Governor's
discretion. **</p>
<p class="foot">[* W. H. Moore. "The Commonwealth of Australia",
p. 25.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** 59 Geo. III., 114, July, 1819.]</p>
<p>To return to 1788, the Governor could issue ordinance's for
the good government of the colony, order summary punishment for
offenders, and even modify English law when necessary. His duties
indeed were various and manifold. "He was not only vice-regent
charged with the awful power of life and death; on him fell also
the care of the infant settlement in its most trivial affairs.
For him it would be to negotiate bills in England, to influence
shipments of foods and necessaries, to distribute land, to foster
agriculture, to settle disputes. He was himself the local Court
of Appeal. From no petty trifle could he escape; from no high
duty could he shrink." *** Jenks attributes to this absolute
dependence of the community on the Governor for everything from
justice to rations, the later impulse to State Socialism.

<p class="foot">[**** <i>Vide</i> Jenks, "History of the
Australasian Colonies", p. 149. Cf. Wise, "The Commonwealth of
Australia".]</p>
<p>The Governor's power was thus in effect absolute. True, he was
responsible to the Imperial Government, and received instructions
to observe certain laws: but distance from England practically
gave him carte blanche. The force of public opinion as a
restraining influence was almost entirely absent, as is evident
the moment we take into account the character of the population.
The presence of convicts necessitated that New South Wales should
remain for many years a Crown Colony of the military type. A
civilian Governor was not appointed until the second half of the
nineteenth century. The earlier Governors, Phillip, Hunter, King
and Bligh, were connected with the navy, whilst Macquarie,
Brisbane, Darling, Bourke and Gipps were military officers.</p>
<p>The military character of the settlement determined the system
of law. A Court of Criminal Jurisdiction was established. It
consisted of the Judge-Advocate and six naval or military
officers selected by the Governor. Offences against the English
criminal law were taken cognisance of. In effect it was a court
martial that dispensed justice. A Civil Court was also created,
consisting of the Judge-Advocate and two inhabitants. In all
cases of appeal the Governor, assisted by the Judge-Advocate, was
the final authority.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b><small>JUDICIAL CHANGES IN
1814.</small></b></p>
<p>About a quarter of a century after the founding of the colony
(<i>i.e.</i>, 1814), the Civil and Criminal Courts, both of which
had hitherto been under the Judge-Advocate, were put under
separate control and made independent of one another. Two classes
of civil courts were established, the <i>Supreme Court</i> and
the <i>Governor's Court</i>. The former (consisting of a judge
appointed by the Crown and two magistrates appointed by the
Governor) heard cases in which a sum of money greater than
&pound;50 was involved. When the amount exceeded &pound;300,
appeal to the Court of Appeal, consisting of the Governor and the
Judge-Advocate was allowed; if the amount exceeded &pound;3,000,
appeal could be made to the Privy Council in England. The
<i>Governor's Court</i> consisted of the Judge-Advocate and two
inhabitants appointed by the Governor (in Van Diemen's Land a
Deputy-Judge-Advocate and two inhabitants). In constitution,
therefore, it was a continuation of the original Civil Court, but
its jurisdiction was limited to cases concerning amounts less
than &pound;50. The jury system, as we understand it, was
non-existent in both civil and criminal cases, whilst the
Judge-Advocate's position was such as to leave the absolute
purity of justice open to question. It was his duty as Advocate
to initiate Crown prosecutions, and then as Judge to decide the
cases. To acquit (or non-suit) was virtually to decide against
his own prosecution.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b><small>NEW SOUTH WALES JUDICATURE ACT
(1823).</small></b></p>
<p>Towards the end of Governor Macquarie's term of office, the
dissatisfaction expressed against the Governor's autocratic
administration led to the appointment of Commissioner Bigge to
enquire into the question. One outcome of Bigge's report was the
first constitutional charter for New South Wales, whereby "law
was substituted for caprice". * By the "New South Wales
Judicature Act" ** passed by the Imperial Parliament in July,
1823, and the "Charter of Justice" issued in accordance with it,
the initial steps towards the attainment by the colonies of the
right to govern themselves was taken. The new Constitution, it is
well to observe, was in conformity with the spirit embodied in
the Quebec Act of 1774, which had granted to the Canadians (who
were then mostly of French nationality) the privilege of a
nominated Council. The declared purpose of the Act of 1823 was to
provide for the effectual government and administration of
justice. It authorised the Governor to form a Council to assist
him, which should have "power and authority to make laws and
ordinances for the peace, welfare and good government" of the
colony. It also provided for the erection of Van Diemen's Land
into a separate colony (which was effected in 1825), and for the
administration of the two colonies on practically similar lines.
A Legislative Council was to be created for each colony, to
consist of five, six or seven persons appointed by the Crown. But
as the Colonial Office in England usually depended upon the
Governor's advice, the power of appointment was practically
vested in him. It was thus essentially a nominee Council. The
powers of this Legislative Council were not, of course, by any
means so extensive as the corresponding body exercises at the
present time. In fact, it had no independent right to legislate.
Its powers were little more than advisory. In the first place,
the initiation of legislation rested still with the Governor, who
also presided over the Council. Secondly, he practically retained
an independent power to legislate, inasmuch as, if he deemed it
necessary, and was supported by at least one Councillor, he could
issue an ordinance directly contrary to the will of the majority
of the Councillors. In case of rebellion or apprehended rebellion
he could act even against a unanimous Council. True, no ordinance
could be published until it had first been submitted to them, and
they, if they wished, could record their dissent. But the dissent
had little or nothing behind it to render it effective. Thirdly,
no proposal could even be submitted until the Chief Justice first
declared it consistent with English law. Consequently, both the
Governor and the Chief Justice dealt with proposed legislation
before the Council discussed it at all. Finally, the British
Parliament had the right to revise all laws and ordinances
approved of by the Council, and the veto still remained with the
Crown. Thus, the Legislative Council was far from enjoying
anything like legislative independence.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Rusden, "History of Australia", I., 564.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** 4 Geo. IV., cap. 96. <i>Vide</i> Appendix to
Chapter I.]</p>
<p>But despite all these restrictions the establishment of the
Council is a prominent landmark in the history of the colony's
constitutional progress. It meant that military authority was
about to give place to that of civilians. *** The Council could
freely criticise proposed ordinances and money bills. It could
levy taxes, though it had no control over the customs or land
revenue. Indeed, after 1827 it fell to the lot of the Council to
finance the civil administration, since the British Government
declined to shoulder the whole financial burden of a colony in
which the proportion of free settlers to the convicts was
continually on the increase. It is well to observe, however, that
all returns from taxes imposed on the colonists were to be used
purely for the benefit of the colony, and the Governor was
directly forbidden by Clause 27 of the Act to levy any tax or
duty except for local purposes. The Imperial Parliament had thus
extended to New South Wales the privileges of an Act passed in
1778 and popularly termed "the Magna Charta of the British
Colonies", by which she had surrendered her right to secure an
Imperial revenue from her colonies or to tax them at all except
for the purpose of regulating commerce.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Vide</i> Rusden, "History of Australia",
I., 364.]</p>
<p>The Legislative Council must be distinguished from the
Executive Council. The latter body was appointed to assist the
Governor in the general administration of the Colony, and may be
regarded as the predecessor of the Cabinet. It came into
existence on the 20th December, 1825, when Governor Darling
issued a proclamation appointing the Lieutenant-Governor, the
Chief Justice, the Archdeacon, and the Colonial Secretary as
members of such a body. As a matter of fact, a body with many of
the functions of an Executive Council had for long assisted the
Governor in his public duties, though it did not enjoy the title
or prestige of such a Council. Henceforth it was to consist of a
number of men whose advice the Governor sought on occasions,
though he left himself free to accept or reject it at his own
discretion. Yet the existence of this body made the
responsibility of the Governor greater, especially on those
occasions when he ignored its advice. For, if subsequent issues
did not justify his neglect of its suggestions, he was liable to
greater censure from the Colonial Office. The establishment of
the Executive Council was a step of considerable importance. "By
affording the principal officials a constitutional opportunity of
discussing together the general affairs of the colony, and of
tendering independent and collective advice, the institution of
the Executive Council gave a powerful impulse to the spread of a
wholesome public opinion, which is one of the essential
prerequisites of self-government." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Jenks, "History of Australasian Colonies", p.
155.]</p>
<p>Public interest and public opinion would be still further
stimulated by the formation of the Legislative Council. Free
criticism develops civic intelligence, and paves the way for the
granting of the coveted self-government. It is for this reason
that we must regard the change of 1823 as a distinct step towards
responsible government. Of course, it was only a single step, and
from one point of view, a small step too, for though the members
of the Executive Council were in 1825 also members of the
Legislative Council, ** there was no constitutional connection
between the two bodies. The former was not answerable in any way
to the latter. Yet it was this little step that provoked public
opinion into vigorous agitation for further endowments of
political freedom, and thereby hastened the day when the right of
the inhabitants to influence the constitution of the Legislative
Council should be recognised.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The Legislative Council in December, 1825,
consisted of the Lieutenant-Governor, the Chief Justice, the
Archdeacon, and the Colonial Secretary, together with John
McArthur, Robert Campbell and Charles Throsby.]</p>
<p>In the same year (1823) further reform was effected in the
judicial administration. Empowered by the Imperial Act of that
year, the Crown issued its "Charter of Justice". Forbes was
appointed as the colony's first Chief Justice, and the offices of
Judge and Advocate ceased to be occupied by the one individual.
Greater purity in the administration of justice was thus ensured.
As a natural corollary, the Chief Justice took the place of the
Judge-Advocate as the Governor's colleague in the Court of
Appeal. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (to consist in
future of two or three Judges) was made to extend over civil and
criminal cases in New Zealand and the Pacific islands. Civil
actions were heard by one or more judges and two magistrates. An
advance towards the jury system was made in that, if the parties
concerned in a civil case so desired, they could be heard before
a jury of twelve freeholders. The chief qualification of a juror
was the possession of fifty acres or of a dwelling worth
&pound;300. Criminal trials were conducted before a judge and
seven military officers. It is interesting to notice here that
Forbes, vindicating the cause of the Emancipists and taking
advantage of a verbal defect in the Act of 1823, held that jurors
could be empanelled at Courts of Quarter Sessions. The fear that
ex-convicts would preponderate among such jurors, led to the
vetoing of Forbes' decision by the Imperial Parliament.</p>
<p>The privilege of a civilian jury in criminal cases was thus
still denied the colony. Yet a forward step had been taken in
that both magistrates (in civil cases) and military officers (in
criminal cases) were subject to challenge, whilst the judges were
themselves of civilian rank. The right of challenge constitutes
one of the essential features of the jury system, for it is by
the exercise of such right that a defendant can protect himself
from a biassed jury.</p>
<p>In addition to the Quarter Sessions which were at this time
constituted, the Governor was empowered to establish local courts
known as "Courts of Requests" to consider claims up to &pound;10.
Appeals to the Supreme Court were limited to cases involving at
least &pound;500.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b><small>MODIFICATIONS IN
1828.</small></b></p>
<p>The Act of 1823 remained in force until 1828. Then, owing
largely to colonial agitation, in which young Wentworth figured
prominently, certain modifications were introduced into the
Constitution. The Legislative Council was numerically
strengthened. In future it was to consist of from ten to fifteen
members, thus admitting an increased proportion of the unofficial
class. Macarthur, Blaxland and Captain Phillip P. King, R.N. (son
of Governor King) were amongst the unofficial members. But the
members were still nominated by the King. The initiation of
legislation still remained with the Governor, as no law could be
made unless it had first been laid before the Council by His
Excellency. The members held their seats at his pleasure, and the
administration was still completely independent of the Council.
At first sight, little advance seemed to have been made. But the
increased numerical strength of the body ensured a greater
respect for its opinions, and thus the Governor's power to act in
defiance of the expressed will of the majority of the Council was
indirectly restricted. The Chief Justice's power of veto was also
reduced. In 1823 he had to decide the validity of a proposed law
<i>before</i> it was presented to the Council. The test of
validity was now to be applied at a later stage, and by the
judges as a whole. The power of the Supreme Court was thus
restricted to a mere protest against the validity of a measure
<i>after</i> it had been passed, while the disputed law could be
enforced even against the judge's protest until the Imperial
Government had had time for a final decision.</p>
<p>A further advance was also made in the administration of
justice. The judicial clauses of 1823 were amended so as to clear
the way for the extension of the regular jury system to criminal
cases. The colonial legislatures could adopt it whenever the
Crown (advised by the Privy Council, and without further
reference to the Imperial Parliament), saw fit to grant them the
power to legislate on the subject. But meanwhile, as the parties
interested in civil cases had lost the right of claiming a jury
of freeholders * unless the Court itself sanctioned it, and all
criminal cases were still tried before military juries in both
the Supreme and the Quarter Sessions Courts, the establishment of
a genuine civilian jury system seemed further away than in 1823.
The fear that ex-convicts might be chosen as jurymen led the
"Exclusives" to oppose the establishment of juries, and the
Emancipists were compelled to submit for a while longer. However,
progress was made in 1832, when trial by jury was applied to
certain crimes and misdemeanours. In cases wherein the interest
or reputation of any military or naval officer, or of the
military or naval bodies generally was concerned, it was
incumbent on the Court to direct that the accused should be tried
before a jury of twelve civil inhabitants. ** Emancipists were
qualified to serve on criminal juries, provided they possessed
freehold property to the value of &pound;300, or had an annual
income of &pound;30. *** Seven years later it was felt that as
the colony "hath greatly increased in population, and a
sufficient number of respectable persons qualified to act as
jurors is to be found in all parts of the said colony", it was in
a position to dispense with military juries altogether (1839.)
Consequently, "all crimes, misdemeanours and offences" were to be
"tried by a jury of twelve of the inhabitants of the colony
<i>only</i> . . . and the trial of offences by seven commissioned
officers" was to "cease and determine". ****</p>
<p class="foot">[* This backward step was probably due to Chief
Justice Forbes' action in attempting to force on the development
of the jury system. <i>Vide</i> pp. 16-17.]</p>

9th Oct., 1829.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** 3 Vic, No. 11, 20th Sept., 1839.]</p>
<p>Five years later (1844) a slight modification was made in the
conduct of civil cases in that the system of magisterial
assessors was dispensed with altogether, in favour of a jury of
four, or, if required by either party, of twelve civilians.</p>
<p>One or two other reforms, effected in 1828, remain to be
noticed. The intermediate Courts of Appeal (consisting of the
Governor and the Chief Justice) were abolished, so that appeals
could now be made direct from the Supreme Courts to the English
Privy Council. Circuit Courts were provided where needed. The
English law was still recognised in the administration of justice
in the colonial courts, as far as it could be applied in the
colonies.</p>

<h3>Chapter II.<br>
<br>
CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN NEW SOUTH
WALES&mdash;(Continued).<br>
1842-1850.</h3>
<h4>REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT, 1842.</h4>
<p>The Act of 1828 remained in operation for fourteen years, when
the third stage in the Constitutional development of the colony
was reached with the passing of an Imperial Act * establishing a
partially representative system. Transportation of convicts had
ceased, after considerable agitation on the part of Wentworth and
the Patriotic Association; and it was now felt that another
endowment of political power might well be bestowed on the
colonists. The Bill passed the Imperial Parliament in 1842
without a single dissentient vote, though this unanimity
betokened indifference rather than whole-hearted approval of its
clauses.</p>
<p class="foot">[* 5 and 6 Vic. cap. 76.]</p>
<p>According to the new Act the legislature was not to be
entirely purged of its nominee element; yet it would consist
mainly of popularly elected representatives. The newly
constituted Council was to consist of thirty-six members;
twenty-four were to be chosen by the enfranchised section of the
people, the other twelve to be nominated as hitherto. This dual
system of membership was probably regarded as a more or less
satisfactory substitute for a bicameral or double-chambered
Parliament. Of the twenty-four representatives, live were to be
elected as representatives of the district of Port Phillip
generally, and one in particular for the town of Melbourne. Of
the twelve nominees, not more than one-half were to be of the
official class; the Governor had therefore to nominate at least
six civilians. The franchise was limited to owners of freehold
worth &pound;200 and householders paying &pound;20 rent per year
(lowered in 1850 to &pound;10). The qualification for an elective
seat on the Council was the possession of freehold worth
&pound;2,000 or returning an annual income of &pound;100. The
Council was empowered within certain limits to modify its own
constitution. It could, for instance, effect a change in its own
numerical strength; but it was especially provided that the ratio
of two to one existing between elected and nominated members
should be left undisturbed.</p>
<p>The powers of the re-constituted Council were considerably
increased, and for this reason, and because two-thirds of its
members obtained their seats independently of the Governor, it
was less under the influence of that official. He ceased, for
example, to preside over the Council, ** for it now had the right
to elect its own Speaker. Naturally, therefore, it secured also
the right to initiate legislation, though the Governor might
still require the discussion of any proposals. It was also
incumbent upon the Government to call the legislature together
for at least one session every year, and the maximum life of a
Council was fixed at five years, subject to earlier dissolution
by the Governor. The nominees held their seats, not for life, but
for the term of the particular legislature to which they had been
nominated.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Contrast Clause XXIII. of the Act of
1828.]</p>
<p>The new body was granted the power to make laws for the peace,
welfare and good government of the colony, though all laws
repugnant to British law were invalid. This legislative right
included the power to impose customs duties, though no country
was to be more favourably treated than any other. Its control
over colonial revenues was extended, but was by no means
complete. In the first place, it was laid down that the colony
must provide a civil list of &pound;80,000 for the remuneration
of the Governor and other officials; secondly, the Colonial
Office in England would not surrender its control of the sale of
Crown lands or of the revenue therefrom; and thirdly, the
Governor introduced measures concerning public expenditure.</p>
<p>A prominent feature of the Act of 1842 is its silence on
judicial matters. It is concerned only with the administrative
and legislative machinery of the colony. The earlier Acts of 1823
and 1828 had provided for all three departments. The explanation
is, of course, that the administration of justice had become a
matter for the local Council to control, and consequently the
necessity for Imperial provision had disappeared.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature of the same Act is the attempt to
establish some form of local government. By virtue of some of the
clauses the Governor was empowered to establish District
Councils, nominated by himself in the first instance, and elected
on subsequent occasions. The number of Councillors varied from
eight to twenty-one according to the population of the
districts.</p>
<p>Although it was very desirable that some system of local
government should develop sooner or later, it was unfortunate
that the Home Government attempted to force a system prematurely
on the colony. The effect was to provoke opposition on the part
of the colonists. The rural districts were reluctant to form
councils, and eventually the attempt lamentably failed. It is
thought by some that the adoption of local government schemes
were retarded as a consequence, and the population taught to
depend too greatly on its central government. The break-down of
the scheme was due largely to some objectionable clauses as to
the duties to be thrust upon the local councils. In addition to
requiring them to attend to such matters as the construction of
bridges, roads, and public buildings, education, rates, tolls,
and control of all public property within their spheres of
operation, they were also rendered liable for one-half of the
expenses incurred in the maintenance of the police force, though
no control whatever over the police was allowed them. The
Governor could issue warrants requiring district treasurers to
pay the sum assessed for this purpose, and failing payment, he
could order the sale of the treasurer's private goods and even
those of the councillors or inhabitants. Little wonder that the
colonists developed an antagonism to such arbitrary arrangements,
especially when they were imposed on them by external authority,
and not by their own legislature.</p>
<p>The first Council under the revised Constitution met on the
1st August. 1843. Amongst the elected members were William
Charles Wentworth and William Bland, representing Sydney, and Dr.
Lang, Dr. (afterwards Sir Charles) Nicholson and Thomas Walker
for the Port Phillip district; whilst Charles Cowper, Richard
Windeyer, Major d'Arcy Wentworth and G. R. Nichols figured as
country members. The Colonial Secretary, Deas Thomson, was
amongst the official nominees. The leading spirit among these
legislators was Wentworth, who, having been largely instrumental
in securing for his colony trial by jury, cessation of convict
transportation, a free press and a representative system, was now
bent on placing on the parliamentary system the coping stone of
Responsible Government. The interest of the next decade consists,
therefore, in watching this steady march towards the attainment
of self-government.</p>
<p>The Council in 1842 was still unable to control the
administration. Representative, but not Responsible, Government
had been established. The Governor was still his own Prime
Minister, and the heads of departments retained office during his
pleasure. Salaried officers, including these heads, were debarred
from accepting elective seats in the Council, and one-half of the
nominees were non-officials. The severance of the executive and
legislative bodies was thus ensured, and the former's
independence of the latter safe-guarded. As virtual Prime
Minister, the Governor had, in Wentworth's opinion, far too much
power. He still retained the right (1) to dispose of the Crown
lands and the proceeds therefrom, (2) to introduce financial
measures into the Legislative Council, (3) to exercise
independent control over finance in that he could, and did, order
the District Councils to increase squatters' rents and (4) to
annul or veto bills that had been accepted by the Council. This
last-mentioned power he would feel less compunction in exercising
than would a constitutional ruler of the present day. He could
also influence the deliberations of the Council through his
twelve nominees. And, though the local legislature might agree
upon certain customs rates, they could not be imposed until the
Home Government had approved of them. Even when imposed, these
duties were collected by officers responsible to the Home Office.
Naturally the Council was but little satisfied with its partial
control of the public purse, and with British interference in the
colony's foreign trade.</p>
<p>Equally distasteful was Earl Grey's well-intentioned but
tactless attempt in 1847 to impose a revised constitution on the
colony without the slightest reference to the inhabitants
themselves. He proposed to institute the bicameral system of a
nominated Upper House and a lower Chamber to be elected by the
members of Municipal Councils, who in their turn would be
popularly chosen. Public resentment ran high, and it was but
adding fuel to the fire when the British Government attempted in
1848 to revive the practice of transporting convicts to the
colonies.</p>
<p>It was just at this time that the people of the Port Phillip
district were agitating for political separation from New South
Wales. Although, as already noticed, they were entitled to send
six representatives to the New South Wales Legislative Council,
yet distance from Sydney and the consequent expense and loss of
time in attending the Council meetings discouraged the
inhabitants of the district from offering their services as
Councillors. The electors were consequently compelled to choose
Sydney residents. This naturally created profound dissatisfaction
with the Constitution, and developed a spirit of rivalry and
antagonism between the two centres which affected their relations
with one another for long afterwards.</p>
<p>The outcome of these two agitations was an enquiry by a
specially reconstituted Committee of the Privy Council on Trade
and Plantations. *</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Vide</i> Report of the Committee printed in
Egerton's "Federations and Unions in the British Empire".]</p>
<p>The Committee recommended&mdash;</p>
<p class="negindent">(I.) The political separation of New South
Wales and Port Phillip.</p>
<p class="negindent">(II.) The establishment in each of the three
other colonies (Victoria. Tasmania, and South Australia) of a
single House of Legislature similar in composition to that
already in existence in New South Wales&mdash;one-third of its
members to be nominees and the remaining two-thirds elected
representatives.</p>
<p class="negindent">(III.) The entrusting of these Legislatures
with the power of converting their single House system into the
bicameral system.</p>
<p class="negindent">(IV.) The further empowering of the
Legislatures to make "any other amendments to their own
Constitution which time and experience may show to be
requisite."</p>
<p class="negindent">(V.) The reservation of all amendments for
royal approval.</p>
<p class="negindent">(VI.) Free scope for the influence of public
opinion.</p>
<p class="negindent">(VII.) Increased control for these
Legislatures over public expenditure.</p>
<p>Recommendations of a federal character were also offered, but
these will be more fully discussed at a later stage. *</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Vide</i> Chapter VI.]</p>
<p>In accordance with the report of this committee, the Imperial
Parliament passed an Act in 1850 for the better government of the
Australian Colonies. The Act was proclaimed in January, 185l. **
It provided that the Port Phillip district, with the Murray River
as its northern boundary, *** should constitute a separate colony
under the name of Victoria. The separation took effect with the
issue of the writs for the election of the Victorian Legislative
Council on the 1st July, 1851.</p>
<p class="foot">[** 13 and 14 Vic., ch. 59. Aug., 1850.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** It is well to observe here that when the
measure of 1855, effecting still further constitutional changes
in the Colonies, was being passed by the Imperial Parliament, a
clause was inserted fixing more definitely the boundary. It
declared that "the whole water-course of the river Murray from
its source to the eastern boundary of South Australia shall be
deemed to be within the territory of New South Wales."]</p>
<p>Compensation to New South Wales for the loss of the Port
Phillip district was forthcoming in the shape of further
political privileges. The powers of the Legislative Council were
extended, and the franchise was substantially liberalised. As
regards the first of these privileges&mdash;the increase of
legislative powers&mdash;customs duties could now be levied
without awaiting the Queen's assent, though this freedom was
limited by three conditions:&mdash;(1) the stores for English
troops in the colonies were to be exempt from taxation; (2) the
treaty obligations of Great Britain could not be contravened; and
(3) differential duties could not be allowed,&mdash;in other
words, imports from all other countries were to be taxed equally,
no preference being shown even to British goods or to those from
neighbouring colonies. There could be no "most favoured nation"
policy. The actual collection of the customs still remained the
function of officers responsible to the Home Government, until
Earl Grey made arrangements in 1851 for the complete transference
of all machinery for collection to the Colonial Parliament. On
the second point&mdash;the liberalising of the
franchise&mdash;the qualification for electors was reduced in the
case of property owners to the possession of property to the
extent of &pound;100, and in the case of householders to the
renting of houses worth at least &pound;10 per annum. Holders of
leases with three years to run and worth &pound;10 a year, and
holders of pasture licenses, were also enfranchised. No
alteration was made in the qualification for members, and the
ratio between nominees and elected representatives was also
undisturbed. Consequently, when in 1851 the Council increased its
numerical strength from 36 to 54, not more than 36 of these were
elected members. But the Council itself was empowered to control
in future the qualification of both members and voters, and to
amend the Constitution of the legislature so as to provide
themselves with two Houses if it was considered desirable. The
colonists, in other words, were at liberty to establish, through
their representatives, the bicameral system whether nominee or
elective, though any such bill would have to receive royal
approval before being valid. The colonists had thus an assurance
that they would receive a Constitution of such a character as
they themselves desired.</p>
<p>In accordance with the federal suggestions of the Committee on
Trade and Plantations, Governor Fitzroy of New South Wales
received commissions as Captain-General and Governor-General of
all the Australian possessions, besides further commissions as
Governor of each of the colonies&mdash;New South Wales, Van
Diemen's Land, Victoria and South Australia. The chief official
in each State, though in effect the Governor, was nominally only
Lieutenant-Governor. Any communications destined for the Colonial
Office in England went through the Governor-General, who also
could supersede the Lieutenant-Governor's authority whenever he
visited any of the colonies. It was hoped that such an
arrangement would prove the preliminary step towards a thorough
system of federation, and would reconcile the people of New South
Wales to the loss of the Port Phillip district. The other
colonies, however, resented the subordination of their Governors,
and the Victorian device of giving theirs a greater salary than
was received by his nominal superior in New South Wales went far
to prove the artificiality of the federal scheme. "Instead of
serving as an efficient instrument for bringing about a helpful
co-operation of the colonies, as had been intended, it (the
federal device) had become a bone of contention and an occasion
of discord between the two rival provinces." * Consequently, in
1855 all the Lieutenant-Governors received the full gubernatorial
title and prestige, and six years later the empty title of
Governor-General was relinquished.</p>

<h3>Chapter III.<br>
<br>
CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN NEW SOUTH
WALES&mdash;(Continued).<br>
<br>
Since 1850.<br>
<br>
RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT.</h3>
<p>Despite the concessions (referred to in the previous chapter)
made by the British Parliament in 1850, most of the clauses of
the 1842 Constitution to which exception had been taken remained
still in force. Wentworth was bent on Securing their removal. He
therefore prevailed upon the Council in 1851 to pass the
"Declaration and Remonstrance" against the new Constitutional
arrangements on the following grounds:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) The Council was still debarred from the full control of
all revenue and taxation. Proposals for expenditure came still
directly from the Governor, and the land proceeds were still
beyond the Council's control.</p>
<p>(2) The British Government was wont to interfere, by
instructions to the Governor, with appointments to colonial
positions, and</p>
<p>(3) The Legislature had neither full legislative powers, nor
any effective control over the administration. The right to
criticise without the power to remove officials did not satisfy
them.</p>
<p>The Council in its Remonstrance declared: "We owe it to
ourselves and our constituents to denounce to your Majesty, as
the chief grievance to which the people of this colony are
subjected, the systematic and mischievous interference which is
exercised by the Colonial Minister even in matters of purely
local government." Whilst professing to be "most anxious to
strengthen and perpetuate the connection happily subsisting with
the fatherland", the Council proceeded to declare that it would
"be impossible to maintain much longer the authority of a local
executive compelled to refer all measures of importance . . . for
the decision of an inexperienced, remote, and irresponsible
department." * The demand for responsible government was becoming
more incessant, and the Council resolved that it was "prepared
upon the surrender to the Colonial Legislature of the entire
management of all our revenues, territorial as well as general,
and upon the establishment of a Constitution similar in outline
to that of Canada, to assume and provide for the whole cost of
our internal government whether civil or military." ** The
despatch drawn up by Sir John Pakington, the new Secretary for
the Colonies, was the British Government's response to the
"Remonstrance". The Minister declared his willingness to extend
further Constitutional liberties to the colonies. He was
convinced the time was opportune, as on account of the gold
discoveries there had been an accession to the population of
Australia. Moreover, Australian statesmen had, in his opinion,
given satisfactory evidence of their ability to control the
destinies of a State. Pakington suggested that each colony should
draft and submit for approval a revised Constitution. He stated
that the British Government was prepared to surrender its control
of Crown lands to the Colonial Councils as soon as the changes
were effected. He concluded by expressing in prophetic language
the hope that the contemplated changes "will not only tend to
promote the welfare and prosperity of the great colony . . . but
also to cement and perpetuate the ties of kindred affection and
mutual confidence which connect its people with that of the
United Kingdom."</p>
<p class="foot">[* Rusden, "History of Australia", II., 499.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Quick and Garran, "Annotated Constitution",
p. 41.]</p>
<p>A select committee with Wentworth at its head, and Deas
Thomson, Cowper, Martin and James Macarthur amongst its members,
proceeded without delay to draft a Constitution for New South
Wales. The changes they suggested went further than the provision
in the Act of 1850 allowed for. A bicameral Parliament was agreed
upon. Wentworth's original suggestion with respect to the
Legislative Council was that it should consist either of members
with hereditary claims of membership so as to give "incentive to
a laudable ambition", or of members elected like the Scottish
representatives in the House of Lords by an hereditary nobility
such as Wentworth desired to see created. Such a suggestion was
too severe a strain on the democratic temper of the colony.
Indignation meetings were the order of the day. Vigorous protests
were forthcoming from all directions. Amongst the prominent
opponents of the Wentworthian scheme was one destined in later
years to figure still more largely in the public life of the
colony&mdash;Mr. (afterwards Sir) Henry Parkes. The opposition
convinced Wentworth of the unpopularity of his scheme for the
founding of an hereditary nobility. He consequently contented
himself with the milder, and from a democratic standpoint, less
objectionable, nominee chamber.</p>
<p>The Council was to consist of not less than twenty-one members
nominated by the Governor with the advice of the Executive
Council. At least four-fifths of its members were to be from the
non-official class. The nominations were in the first instance
for five years only; at the expiration of the first quinquennial
period, all nominees were to be appointed for life. A property
qualification was not demanded.</p>
<p>The Legislative Assembly was to consist of 54 members (raised
to 72 in 1858) chosen by the electors. Electors had to be
residents of six months' standing who owned freehold of the value
of &pound;100, occupied a building, lodging or land for which
they paid an annual rent of &pound;10, held a pasture license, or
paid &pound;40 per year for board and lodging. An elector was
allowed a vote in every constituency in which he had the
necessary qualification. No additional qualification was insisted
on for membership, but no official under the Crown and no
minister of religion could be elected to the Assembly.</p>
<p>Increased powers were to be given to the Legislature. All
revenues&mdash;including returns from Crown lands&mdash;which, to
the disgust of the colonists, had for so long been controlled by
the Imperial Authorities&mdash;was to form a Consolidated Revenue
Fund. Its appropriation or disposal could be determined by none
other than the Colonial Legislature. Bills for appropriation, as
well as those for taxation, were to originate in the Lower House
after recommendation by the Governor in a message to the House.
This procedure ensured that the Governor's advisers, the
Ministers, would control the supply and expenditure subject to
the approval of the popular House. Largely increased powers of
legislation were also conferred on Parliament. They included the
right to frame laws relative to the waste lands of the Crown,
and, on certain conditions, to amend its own Constitution. The
chief restrictions were, as under the old Act, that (1) No duties
could be levied on the Queen's forces; (2) fiscal and commercial
laws inconsistent with treaties made by Great Britain would be
held invalid; and (3) differential customs duties were forbidden.
The last of these means, as already explained, that all countries
were to be treated alike in the matter of import and export
duties. The independence of judges and the consequent purity of
justice was safeguarded in the usual way&mdash;by the appointment
of judges for life, and their non-removal except by the will of
both Houses of Parliament, expressed in an address to the
Governor, on the grounds of bad conduct. Parliament was to
assemble at least once every year, and its life was limited to
five years.</p>
<p>The draft Bill was accepted by the Colonial Legislature.
Wentworth and Deas Thomson were commissioned to proceed to
England, to explain its provisions and to ensure its passage
through the Imperial Parliament. After slight modifications by
the British Minister it was presented to Parliament
which&mdash;after vigorous opposition to some of the clauses on
the part of Mr. Robert Lowe, formerly of New South Wales, but
then a member of the House of Commons&mdash;approved of it and
forwarded it for the Royal assent. This was given on the 16th
July, 1855, and the Act proclaimed in the colony four months
later (November). ***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** 18 and 19 Vic, c. 54.]</p>
<p>The New South Wales Constitution Act does not expressly State
that Parliament is to control the Executive; neither does it
anywhere employ the term "responsible government". Yet it was
distinctly understood that the passing of the Act would involve
the establishment of such a system. In future, the Executive
would be accountable for all its administrative acts to the
Legislature, and especially to the House representing the people.
Such a responsibility is certainly, implied, as it is expressly
stated (1) that certain powers are vested in the Governor "with
the advice of the Executive Council", and (2) that the
Legislature controls all the consolidated revenue, including the
proceeds from Crown lands. It invariably happens that the body
which controls the public purse controls the administration. The
Executive cannot carry on without supplies, and these are not
forthcoming except through the goodwill of the people's
representatives. Any doubt as to the relations of the Executive
and Legislature, however, was set at rest by a despatch forwarded
by the Secretary for the Colonies to the Governor, advising him
of the introduction of the system of responsible government, and
thus explicitly stating what the Act merely implied. As a
consequence, the Governor's position henceforth carried less
political power. Whilst he remained the official head of the
Government, all real authority rested with the Ministers, who
exercised it as long as they could retain the confidence of the
Legislative Assembly. The <i>personnel</i> of the Assembly, in
its turn, depended on the political opinions of the enfranchised
community. Thus the democrats had at last come to realise their
greatest aspiration. Popular control over the Legislature
directly, and over the Executive through the Legislature, had
become an accomplished fact.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="image6" id="image6"></a><img alt=""
src="1300311h-images/image6.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>SIR F. DEAS THOMSON;           WILLIAM CHARLES
WENTWORTH</small></p>
<br>
<p>The first wholly elected Parliament was opened on the 22nd
May, 1856, by Governor Denison. Within a month the first Ministry
responsible to Parliament was formed with Stuart Alexander
Donaldson as Premier; Thomas Holt, Treasurer, and Sir William
Manning, Attorney General.</p>
<p>The Constitution of 1856 is in its general character the
present Constitution of the State. But important alterations and
modifications, in respect of both the composition of the Houses
and the extent of the franchise, have since been made, whilst
since 1901 certain functions have been transferred to the care of
the Federal Government and Parliament. The most important
modifications are the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) In 1857 it was resolved that simple, instead of two-thirds
majorities as agreed upon when drawing up the Constitution, could
effect alterations of electoral divisions and the distribution of
representatives.</p>
<p>(2) In the following year (1858) secret voting by means of the
ballot-box was introduced, and the franchise was further
liberalised, though it was not until 1893 that "manhood suffrage"
and the principle of "one man one vote" were adopted. At the
present day it is illegal for an elector to vote for a candidate
for any electorate other than the one in which he resides.
Residence, not possession of property, is the determining factor
in the matter of the franchise. Since 1902 women have been
allowed to vote, though it was at the same time emphatically laid
down that no woman could be nominated as a candidate or be
elected as a member of Parliament. * Thus "Universal" or "Adult"
Suffrage is now in full operation. Every adult resident, man or
woman, provided he or she is a natural-born or naturalised
subject of the Crown, and is not a lunatic or criminal, is
entitled to vote; and every man who is not disqualified by reason
of lunacy, bankruptcy, crime, business contract with the
Government or allegiance to a foreign power, is eligible for
Parliamentary membership.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Act 54, 1902 (27th Aug.).]</p>
<p>In 1911 the residential qualifications were reduced to the
lowest practicable. A new arrival may claim the vote after six
months' residence in the Commonwealth, provided he has at the
same time lived for the last three months within the State, and
at least one month in the electorate. In the previous year a
system of "second ballot" was introduced to ensure that no
candidate should be returned until he had received the support of
an "absolute" majority (<i>i.e.</i>, more than one-half) of the
voters polling in the electorate. If more than two candidates are
nominated for an electorate, and the first ballot does not result
in an absolute majority for any one of them, the names of the two
most favoured candidates are re-submitted to the electors and a
second poll is taken. The contest is in this way reduced to a
clear-cut issue between two aspirants, and the system is supposed
to avoid the evils of vote-splitting. It seems, however, an
unsatisfactory substitute for the more perfect system of
"preferential voting", such as is in operation in Tasmania.</p>
<p>(3) The number of members elected to the of the Assembly.
Legislative Assembly has varied from time to time. Before the
colonies federated, the tendency was for the number to grow
larger. Thus it rose from 54 in 1856 to 72 two years later, and
to 108 in 1880, with provision for its automatic increase along
with that of the population. Consequently, in 1891, 141 members
were returned by 74 electorates. Two years later, however, the
colony was cut up into 125 single-member electorates; and after
the establishment of the Federal Commonwealth, as the State found
it could manage with a reduced House, the number was fixed at 90,
and stands at that level at the present day.</p>
<p>(4) Payment of members was introduced in 1889, and is
considered a democratic necessity, so that no one, not even the
poorest, may be prevented from offering his services as a
legislator. From 1889 to 1912 the members of the Assembly were
remunerated at the rate of &pound;300 per year, but in September,
1912, the remuneration was increased to &pound;500.</p>
<p>(5) In 1873 the Imperial Government removed its embargo on
differential rates, thus giving the colony unrestricted control
over its tariff arrangements. This right it retained (but did not
use) until the control of customs was handed over to the
Commonwealth Government.</p>
<p>(6) A Triennial Act was passed in 1874, limiting the duration
of any single Parliament to three years. Before that date a
quinquennial system was in operation. This change is still
further evidence of the democratic spirit of the people, for
under the triennial system our legislators are more frequently
answerable to their constituents, and therefore, are less likely
to disregard public opinion.</p>
<p>(7) The qualifications for membership of the Council were
reduced to a minimum in 1890. Any male of the age of 21 years or
more, provided he is a natural-born or naturalised subject, and
is not debarred by certain disqualifications such as lunacy,
etc., is eligible for appointment.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b><small>THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION
SUMMARISED.</small></b></p>
<p>It would be well at this stage to pause and sum up the
outstanding characteristics of the State Constitution as it
exists to-day. We must observe in the first place that New South
Wales has a Legislature more nearly on the British pattern than
is the case in any other of the Australian States (Queensland
excepted). It has an Upper Nominated House&mdash;the Legislative
Council&mdash;corresponding in a sense to the English House of
Lords, the members being nominated by the Governor at the
instance of his Ministers, and holding their seats for life,
though without the power to hand on the privilege to their heirs.
Absence from two consecutive sessions without permission deprives
a Councillor of his seat, as does also membership in some other
Legislature, bankruptcy, crime or allegiance to a foreign power.
The Legislative Assembly is composed of ninety members, each of
whom is elected by a separate constituency or electorate. The
Assembly is elected for three years, but is subject to earlier
dissolution if circumstances require it. The electorates contain
about the same number of voters. The Assembly therefore rests on
an extremely democratic basis. The principles of adult franchise,
one adult one vote, and one vote one value, dominate the
elections. On the day of election a man may record his vote at
any time between the hours of eight in the morning and seven in
the evening; if he happens to be away from his electorate on the
auspicious day, he is entitled to record his vote for that
electorate at any polling-booth in the State. Polling day is a
public holiday; but any employee who must work can demand time
sufficient to attend the polling-booth, and the employer who
refuses the demand is subject to a heavy penalty (&pound;50).</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that the extension of such privileges will
result in a decided increase in the general interest in
elections. In the past it has been difficult to induce more than
sixty-five per cent, of the electors&mdash;often considerably
less&mdash;to exercise this right.</p>
<p>The members of the Legislative Assembly usually belong to one
or other political party with a more or less definite programme
of proposed legislation. The leader of the strongest party is
generally selected by the Governor as his Chief Adviser or
Premier. The Premier in his turn selects as his colleagues the
most suitable members of his party. It is not necessary that his
colleagues should be chosen exclusively from the Assembly. At
least one, sometimes more, are members of the Legislative
Council. These members are called separately "Ministers of the
Crown", and collectively "the Cabinet" or "Ministry".</p>
<p>Since 1856 the following principles of responsible government
have been almost invariably recognised:&mdash;</p>
<p>(A) The members of the Cabinet must also be members of
Parliament. The greater number of them should come from the
Legislative Assembly.</p>
<p>(B) The Cabinet must enjoy the confidence of a majority of
members of the Assembly. It resigns when either it, its Premier,
or often any member of it, ceases to command that confidence. As
a rule the Ministry stands or falls together. This is a
recognition of the principle of "Collective Responsibility".</p>
<p>(C) Each member of a Cabinet is placed in charge of a separate
Department of State, and is assisted by a permanent and
experienced official known generally as the Under-Secretary. It
is not unusual, however, for one or more Honorary Ministers (that
is. Ministers without a portfolio or care of a Department) to be
included in the Cabinet.</p>
<p>The State Cabinet underwent considerable changes at the
inauguration of the Commonwealth, as several of its Departments
were transferred to the Federal Cabinet. At the present time
(1913) it consists of the following Ministers: (1) The Chief
Secretary; (2) Attorney General; (3) Treasurer; (4) Minister for
Justice; (5) Secretary for Lands; (6) Minister for Agriculture;
(7) Minister for Public Instruction; (8) Secretary for Public
Works; (9) Secretary for Mines (10) Minister for Labour and
Industry, and (11) Vice-President of the Executive Council, who,
as a member of the Legislative Council, conducts the Government's
business through that House. The Premier may take charge of
whichever Department he pleases, or even content himself with a
general supervision without constituting himself Ministerial head
of any Department. It is also not unusual for a single Minister
to be given control of more than one of the portfolios. Thus in
1913 the Minister for Public Instruction was also Minister for
Labour and Industry, whilst the Department of Lands was
administered by the Minister for Agriculture.</p>
<p>(D) The Cabinet members are the Governor's advisers. The maxim
"the King can do no wrong" applies with almost equal force to the
King's representatives in the Australian States. It involves that
the advisers should be held responsible for the administration of
the State. Consequently, the Governor is bound to accept the
advice of his Ministers in almost every administrative act.</p>
<p>The Governor acts with the Executive in appointing judges,
nominating members to the Legislative Council and pardoning
offenders. He summons, prorogues and dissolves * Parliament,
issues the writs for a general election, appoints the President
of the Legislative Council and the Ministers of the Crown,
though, as already pointed out, he generally selects as Premier
the leader of the strongest parliamentary party, and leaves the
choice of other Ministers to him. According to Imperial
instructions, however, the Governor must refuse the Royal assent
to Bills (1) divorcing particular individuals; (2) making grants
to the Governor himself; (3) affecting the currency; (4)
affecting the Royal prerogative, or the rights and property of
His Majesty's subjects; (5) prejudicing the trade and shipping of
the United Kingdom; (6) running contrary to Imperial treaty
obligations, or (7) having already been refused the Royal
sanction. The State Governor is still appointed by the Crown. It
has frequently been urged that the choice of a Governor should be
confined to citizens of the State; but an argument against this
lies in the fact that the Home Government would then be dependent
on the recommendation of the State Ministry which might be
strongly tempted to recommend someone so far immersed in politics
as to be practically incapacitated for want of "impartiality and
aloofness from local political strife." ** A more vital objection
is the contention that the Throne must not limit itself in
selecting its representatives.</p>
<p class="foot">[* He acts on his own responsibility in
dissolving Parliament.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Vide</i> W. Harrison Moore, "Commonwealth
of Australia", pp. 164-5.]</p>
<p>It requires but little consideration or imagination on our
part to realise what a decided political contrast is offered to
us in the New South Wales of 1788 and the same State of the
present day. The successors of Governor Phillip have long ceased
to exercise his authority. They have surrendered their sceptre
into the hands of the people. In common with the rest of the
Australian States, and, in fact, of the civilised world, our
State has sought, and is still seeking to give the most thorough
and effective expression to the sentiment contained in the phrase
"Vox populi vox dei." With the maintenance of a progressive
system of education, a high moral tone and a sensitive social
conscience, we need not fear the result.</p>
<p align="center"><b>*         *         *         *</b></p>
<h4>LOCAL GOVERNMENT.</h4>
<p>In the previous chapter attempts by Earl Grey to develop a
system of local government in the State were referred to. It is
advisable to note the developments in that direction since his
time. The colony of South Australia anticipated New South Wales
in the establishment of a system of municipal government by about
three years, as the younger colony passed a municipal law in
1839, and had a mayor and council of Adelaide in 1840, whereas it
was not till 1842 that Sydney could boast of a City Incorporation
Act. Melbourne was incorporated as a town in the same year. In
that year also, a statute of the Imperial Parliament empowered
the Governor to establish district councils in other localities.
The effect has already been noticed. The attempt to impose a
local government system and to enforce certain obnoxious clauses
without first referring the question to the colonists themselves
retarded the development of local government generally, and the
objectionable clauses were eventually repealed.</p>
<p>It was not till 1858 that legislation provided for the
establishment of a municipality upon petition of the prospective
ratepayers. By this Act&mdash;Municipalities Act of
1858&mdash;the rate-payers elected the aldermen, who in their
turn selected their chairman or mayor. The Council could make
by-laws for the government of the town, and control roads,
bridges, ferries, wharves, establish asylums, hospitals,
libraries, impose tolls and rents in connection with bridges,
wharves, etc.</p>
<p>In 1867 all local divisions were classified into (1) Boroughs,
containing at least 1,000 inhabitants and an area of not more
than nine square miles, and (2) Municipal districts with at least
500 people in an area of not more than 50 square miles.
Nevertheless, until 1905, only about one per cent, of the State
was not directly governed by the Government in municipal matters.
Since then, however, shire government has been established, and
country areas of the eastern and central divisions of the State
have been constituted as shires, each governed by a "Shire
Council". Town areas are constituted as municipalities with
powers of rating and borrowing on a higher scale than are allowed
to the shires, because of their denser population. These Councils
attend to such matters as the control of traffic, the
construction and maintenance of roads, lighting, prevention of
fire and flood, and administering the Acts dealing with public
watering places, impounding, cattle slaughtering, public health
and police offences. They may also acquire the right on petition
to control or maintain the water, gas and electric supplies,
ferries, fire brigades, abattoirs, parks, theatres and public
halls, art galleries, libraries, museums, sale of fish, meat,
etc. At present there are 190 municipalities and 134 shires in
existence in New South Wales. The shires vary in area from 36 to
nearly 6,000 square miles.</p>
<p>The expense of local government is borne by a revenue derived
in shires from rates on the unimproved capital value of from 1d.
to 2d. in the &pound;; in municipalities, from rates which must
be partly or wholly levied on the unimproved capital value, and
may be partly levied on the improved capital value, and which may
range from 1d. in the &pound; up to, in some cases, as high as
1s. or even more. The Government distributes a sum of not less
than &pound;150,000 per annum among shires as endowment on rates
collected; and it may grant endowment to municipalities when
necessary. Municipal councils and shire councils, when acting on
behalf of "urban areas" within their shires&mdash;for with
respect to these the shire councils have the powers of municipal
councils&mdash;may borrow up to ten per cent, of the unimproved
capital value of ratable land within the municipality or "urban
area", provided that (1) the ratepayers express approval by means
of a poll; (2) the Governor approves; and (3) a loan rate is
levied to provide the interest on the loan and a sinking fund. As
a general rule (aside from the "urban area" loans) shire councils
are allowed to borrow only "temporary loans" not exceeding
one-third of the estimated revenue from the rates, or loans to
repay old loans of municipalities that have been dissolved and
added to the shire.</p>
<p>The most important of the municipalities is, of course, the
City of Sydney. The City Council consists of twenty-six aldermen,
representing thirteen wards (two to each ward) elected
simultaneously every three years by three classes of
electors:&mdash;(1) property owners; (2) leaseholders, and (3)
tenants and lodgers after six months' residence paying at least
&pound;10 annual rent. The Lord Mayor is chosen by the aldermen
from amongst themselves.</p>

<h3>Chapter IV.<br>
<br>
THE OTHER COLONIES.</h3>
<p>The progress from the Crown Colony stage to that of
responsible government has now been traced in the case of New
South Wales. In no other instance do the five stages stand out so
distinctly as in the Mother State. Tasmania, Victoria, and
Queensland had no existence apart from New South Wales until
sufficient progress had been made to dispense with purely
autocratic rule. South Australia commenced its career, as we
shall see, with an advisory Council. Until the enactment of the
Australian Colonies' Government Act of 1850, the existing
colonies, New South Wales, Van Diemen's Land, South Australia,
and Western Australia, were in various stages of constitutional
progress. The effect of this measure was to bring all of them
(with the exception of Western Australia) more or less into line
within the next few years. By the year 1856 New South Wales,
Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania (as well as New Zealand)
were enjoying the privileges and advantages of a system of
responsible government. In every instance the bicameral system of
Legislature was adopted; in every colony also the Assembly, or
Lower House, as it is rather inappropriately termed, was based on
popular election, and in the majority of cases electoral
qualification depended in the first instance on possession of
property. Manhood suffrage was a later development, and adult
suffrage still more recent. South Australia alone commenced with
the more thoroughly democratic system of manhood suffrage. In
every case, again, the Assembly guarded jealously its right to
initiate money bills, enforcing the principle that had been
recognised in England for over two centuries, "that all aid and
supplies and aids to His Majesty in Parliament are the sole gift
of the Commons; and it is the undoubted right of the Commons to
direct, limit, and appoint in such Bills the ends, purposes,
considerations, conditions, limitations and qualifications of
such grants, which ought not to be changed or altered by the
House of Lords." The various colonies retained the right to amend
their own Constitutions, though such measures as well as those
affecting the salaries of Governors are still reserved for Royal
sanction.</p>
<p>But while the Colonial Constitutions resemble one another in
their general features, there are considerable differences of
detail, especially as regards the Legislative Council.
Consequently a brief glance at each State seems
indispensable.</p>

<small>A POLITICAL SKETCH</small></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>
<h3>VICTORIA.</h3>
<p>Port Phillip had been discovered in 1802, but it was more than
three decades later before a successful settlement was effected,
Collins' attempt to establish a penal settlement in 1803 having
failed. As the result of the enterprise of the Henty Brothers,
Batman and Fawkner, settlements were made at Portland in 1834,
and at Port Phillip in 1835, and in 1837 Lonsdale was sent as
Resident Magistrate, and Latrobe, two years later, as
Superintendent.</p>
<p>Between 1842 and 1851 the Port Phillip district elected six
representatives to the Legislative Council of New South Wales,
five members representing the district and one the town of
Melbourne. Distance from Sydney, as has already been stated, and
the consequent inconvenience and loss of time occasioned through
attendance at the Council, resulted in the electors of Port
Phillip choosing Sydney inhabitants to represent them. This was
manifestly a disadvantage, and it was but natural that an
agitation for political separation from New South Wales should
quickly develop. Their dissatisfaction with the constitutional
conditions was made dramatically prominent by the election of
Earl Grey, Secretary of State for the Colonies, as the Melbourne
representative. This farcical election had the effect of
focussing attention on the agitation for separation, and the
Committee on Trade and Plantations made a report favourable to
the proposal. The main purpose of the Imperial Act of 1850 was to
effect the separation, and with the issue of the writs for its
own Legislative Council. Victoria commenced its existence
independent of New South Wales on the 1st July, 1851, with a
partially representative Council of 30 members. Ten of the
members were nominated by the Lieutenant-Governor and twenty
elected by persons owning freehold to the value of &pound;100,
occupying a house at an annual rent of &pound;10, or holding a
lease or pasture license. The powers of the new Council were
similar to those exercised by the corresponding body in New South
Wales. They were empowered to make laws for the good of the
colony, to impose customs duties and other taxes, and to
appropriate the public revenue to the public service, though the
Governor's prior recommendation was necessary in the latter case.
The sale of Crown lands remained with the Crown, as was the case
in New South Wales.</p>
<p>The rapid increase of population consequent upon the discovery
of gold cleared the way for the introduction of responsible
government, and in 1853 the infant colony was busy drafting
another Constitution for itself. The bicameral system of
Legislature was accordingly introduced in 1856. Parliament
consisted of two elected chambers&mdash;a Legislative Council and
a Legislative Assembly. It was granted amongst other powers, the
control of the sale and appropriation of Crown lands and power to
amend still further its own Constitution. The Councillors,
originally thirty in number, and holding their positions for ten
years, were owners of freehold worth at least &pound;5,000 or
returning &pound;500 per annum. The minimum age for Councillors
was fixed at thirty years. They were elected by owners of
&pound;1,000 worth of freehold, graduates, members of the legal
and medical professions, ministers of religion, and, naval and
military officers. Five members retired every two years. The
Assembly was numerically twice as strong as the Council, and was
elected for five years, though subject to earlier dissolution.
Membership here too was fenced in by a solid property
qualification, being open to owners of freehold valued at
&pound;2,000, or returning &pound;200 per annum. A slight
property qualification also restricted the number of electors;
but after one year's experience this qualification was entirely
abolished as regards Assembly elections, and manhood suffrage
instituted. The qualifications affecting the Council were
subsequently reduced, and at present possession of freehold worth
&pound;50 is sufficient qualification for membership, whilst
small freeholders, tenants and, lessees paying an annual rent of
&pound;15, graduates, matriculated students, legal and medical
gentlemen, ministers of religion, and naval and military officers
are included amongst Council electors. Secret ballot was
established from the very outset (1856). Plural voting in the
case of Assembly elections was abolished in 1899, and, though it
is still allowed in the Upper House elections, in that an elector
may vote once in every province in which he possesses the
necessary property, the large size of the electoral districts
practically prevents the plural voter from exercising more than
one vote. Voting by post was established in 1900. This, however,
is of little advantage to the electors of the Councillors, since
at a general election for the Council, an elector by virtue of a
property qualification in two or more provinces may vote in every
province for which he is enrolled, only if he votes personally;
but if he votes by post for any one province, he is precluded on
that polling day from voting for any other.</p>
<p>At present the Council consists of thirty-four members,
returned by seventeen districts, and holding their seats for six
years, one-half (that is to say, one member for each district)
retiring triennially. The Assembly contains sixty-five members,
returned by the same number of electorates, under the system of
adult suffrage. In 1911 an Act was passed for compulsory
preferential voting at elections for the Assembly, the voter
placing a number (1, 2 or 3, etc.) in order of his preference,
opposite the names of all the candidates. *</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Vide</i> Section on Tasmania, for
explanation of preferential voting.]</p>
<p>Two interesting constitutional experiments have been tried in
Victoria. The first was the election in 1903 of representatives
of a special class in the community. To the Council the State
railway and public servants elected one representative, whilst
for the Assembly two members were chosen by the railway employees
and one by the public service. The provision was the outcome of a
fear that under ordinary conditions this class of elector might,
by reason of its numerical strength, unduly control the general
elections. However, the experiment was abandoned in 1906. The
second experiment had to do with deadlocks, Victoria having had a
few bitter experiences of controversy between the two Houses. The
clause, which is still in force, provides that a simultaneous
dissolution of the two Houses shall take place if the Council
twice reject a measure passed by the Assembly, provided that one
rejection has occurred before, and the second after, a
dissolution of the Assembly. The Council's power respecting
appropriation bills is limited to accepting or rejecting them
<i>in toto</i>; it may not amend them, though it may suggest
alterations once at each of three stages of the bill, viz. (a)
when in committees (b) on the report of the committee, and (c) on
the third reading. The Constitution also limits the Ministry to
eight members, not more than two to be chosen from the Council
and six from the Assembly. But a Minister from the Assembly has
the right to sit in the Council in order to explain Government
measures, though he is not entitled to vote except in the House
to which he belongs.</p>

<h3>QUEENSLAND.</h3>
<p>Moreton Bay was first used by white people as a penal
settlement in 1824, persons convicted of offences in New South
Wales being sent thither. The discovery of the rich pastoral land
of the Darling Downs soon led to the migration of free settlers
northwards, and as the population increased, the "Northern
District of New South Wales" was constituted a distinct electoral
division in 1843. The inhabitants immediately around Moreton Bay,
however, benefited little from this political distinction, since
the constituency extended as far south as Port Macquarie and the
Upper Hunter Valley, whilst the head polling place was situated
at Raymond Terrace on the Hunter. Their voice in politics was
very aptly described as an "inaudible squeak". But with the next
few years the population of Moreton Bay territory grew steadily,
and by 1851 it was sufficiently important to boast a member of
its own. This representation of one was increased to two in 1853,
four (including the Clarence River district) in 1855, and nine in
1858. Stimulated by Victoria's success, the Northerners started
an agitation for separation. As early as 1846 Lord Stanley
(afterwards the Earl of Derby) had announced the necessity in the
near future of erecting a new colony north of New South Wales,
and the Constitution Act had anticipated this necessity by
empowering the Queen to establish the colony whenever it seemed
desirable so to do. Consequently, in 1859 all the territory north
of the 29th parallel and east of the 141st meridian was cut off
from New South Wales and erected into a separate colony under the
name of Queensland. For some time the fate of the Richmond and
Clarence River districts hung in the balance, as there was a
fierce demand that these, too, should be attached to the new
colony; but eventually it was decided to leave them to the parent
colony. (See also page 6.)</p>

<br>
<p>One of the privileges of Queensland's late birth was that it
enjoyed from the outset full rights of representative and
responsible government. The Constitution of the Queensland
Parliament is in its general features practically a facsimile of
that in operation in New South Wales, even to the extent of
having a purely nominee Legislative Council. It is, therefore,
unnecessary to go into details concerning the minor points of
difference beyond observing that the younger colony still admits
plural voting. Freeholders of property worth &pound;100, and
leaseholders paying &pound;10 per annum may vote in every
district in which their property is situated. A system of
optional preferential voting is employed in the Assembly
elections by which an elector is required to strike out the names
of candidates for whom he does not intend to vote, and he may, if
he so desire, show his preference for candidates by placing the
figure 1, 2, 3, etc.. after their names. When no candidate is
returned by an absolute majority, all but the two highest on the
poll are deemed defeated, and the votes of the supporters of
defeated candidates are, as far as the ballot papers allow,
distributed between the two undefeated candidates in accordance
with the preference shown by the voters. When two candidates are
to be returned, four names are left in for the second count.</p>

<h3>SOUTH AUSTRALIA.</h3>
<p>South Australia came into existence as an experiment. Mr.
Edward Gibbon Wakefield's theory was being put to the test. He
asserted that if land were sold at a sufficiently high figure,
the proceeds could be devoted to bringing from England a
labouring class who would perforce be content to labour for the
upper classes. In this way a leisured and cultured society would
be rendered possible in the southern continent. The first
settlers arrived in 1836 under Captain Hindmarsh, who was
appointed Governor. The control and disposal of land and land
revenues were at first placed in the hands of special
Commissioners. The legislative and administrative functions were
left, however, to the Governor, assisted by the Chief Justice,
the Colonial Secretary and the Advocate-General. Wakefield's
experiment soon proved unsatisfactory, and the colony had to be
remodelled as an ordinary Crown Colony of the advanced type. The
power to dispose of Crown lands was accordingly transferred from
special Commissioners to the Governor in 1842, and the colony was
granted a nominee Legislative Council, consisting of the Governor
and seven others&mdash;three officers of the Government and four
non-officials. The Council met for the first time in October,
1843. At the same time (1842) the Queen was empowered to
establish a partly elective Council whenever the colony seemed
sufficiently developed to justify the change. Nine years passed,
however, before such a body was created. Then, in 1851, the
colony received a Council constituted on similar lines to that
already in existence in New South Wales. One-third of its members
(8) were nominated by the Governor; the remaining two-thirds (16)
were elected by qualified inhabitants. In accordance with powers
granted by the Imperial Act of the previous year. South Australia
proceeded to draft a Constitution for herself, with the result
that in 1836 her Parliament consisted of two Houses, with control
over the Executive. The South Australian Council is elective. In
1856 it consisted of eighteen members elected for 12 years, six
retiring every fourth year; but since 1902 the term of membership
has been reduced to six years, and one-half (that is nine) of the
members retire at the end of every triennial period. For Council
elections the State is divided into four electorates, each
returning four members (two triennially) except the central
division, which returns six (three triennially). Councillors must
be not less than thirty years of age, and resident in the colony
for at least three years. The qualifications of Council electors
are based on property.</p>
<p>As regards the election and composition of the Assembly, South
Australia proved herself far more democratically disposed than
any of her sister colonies. In the first place, the lifetime of
her Assembly was from the outset limited to three years, whereas
all the other colonies originally adopted the quinquennial limit.
Secondly, the colony dispensed with any property qualification
for the Assembly electors. Manhood suffrage was decided upon as
early as 1856, and this was converted into adult suffrage in
1894. That is to say, women were entitled to vote in South
Australia some years before they enjoyed a similar privilege in
the neighbouring colonies, unless we include New Zealand, where
the privilege was extended to women one year earlier. The
Assembly consists of forty members, representing twelve
electorates.</p>
<p>One interesting feature in the South Australian Constitution
is a special provision, adopted in 1881, to overcome deadlocks
between the two Houses. According to this enactment, if the
Assembly passes a measure in two successive
Parliaments&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, once before and once after a
dissolution, and the Council rejects it on both occasions, the
Governor may either dissolve the two Houses simultaneously, or
else provide for the election of additional members to the
Council in order to secure the necessary agreement between the
two Houses.</p>

<h3>WESTERN AUSTRALIA.</h3>
<p>The first English settlement in the western portion of the
continent was founded in 1826, when a small detachment of
soldiers instituted a settlement at King George's Sound, on the
site of Albany. Three years later, Captain Stirling, shortly
afterwards created Lieutenant-Governor, established a colony of
free settlers on the Swan River. Misfortune overtook the small
community through a faulty land settlement scheme, and it
suffered from want of population; consequently, convicts were
willingly received in 1850, as the nucleus of a labouring class.
Transportation continued for eighteen years, and was not finally
discontinued until 1868, by which time the population had
increased nearly fourfold. The colony was at first administered
by the Governor and an Executive Council of four officials,
whilst in 1831 a small Legislative Council consisting of the same
five officials was also established. In 1839 four unofficial
nominees were added to the Legislature, and in 1868 it consisted
of six nominated officials and six non-officials, the latter
appointed on the recommendation of the different districts in the
colony. With the cessation of convict transportation the way was
cleared for a more satisfactory system, and between 1870 and 1889
Western Australia enjoyed partially representative government.
The Legislature consisted of eighteen members, two-thirds of whom
were elected for five years by property owners. Subsequently, the
members were increased to twenty-six, nine being nominated. The
qualification for membership was the possession of &pound;1,000
worth of freehold, and for electors' rights, the possession of
&pound;50 freehold, or occupancy of a house rented at &pound;10
per annum.</p>
<p>The agitation for responsible government commenced as early as
1873, but the smallness of the community caused the English
Government to refuse the petition. The agitation was revived in
1887, and two years later the Council was unanimous on the
question. Thereupon responsible government was inaugurated in
1890; and as in the other colonies Parliament became bicameral.
The Legislative Council was a nominated body until the colony's
population exceeded 60,000, when the local Parliament, exercising
its power of amending the Constitution, decided on a Council
consisting of members elected by free-holders owning &pound;100
freehold, householders paying &pound;25 rent per annum, and lease
and Crown license holders paying &pound;10. The Councillors,
numbering thirty, are returned by ten electorates, and hold their
seats for six years, one-third retiring every two years. The
Assembly consists of fifty representatives returned by as many
electorates. A system of "contingent" or preferential voting was
brought into operation in 1908, and in 1911 it was made
compulsory. It is very similar in its operations to the Victorian
system.</p>

<h3>TASMANIA.</h3>
<p>Van Diemen's Land was, from its settlement in 1803 until 1825,
under the jurisdiction of the Governor of New South Wales. The
Lieutenant-Governor acted in accordance with instructions
received from headquarters, and all cases for the courts of
justice were originally tried in Sydney. A Deputy Judge-Advocate
arrived in the island in 1806; but there were doubts as to
whether courts could be legally set up in Van Diemen's Land, so
that his office was a sinecure, and no cases were tried by him.
It was not till 1816 that the first court was opened, provision
having been made for the establishment of a Lieutenant-Governor's
court, with power to decide case involving sums under &pound;50.
In 1821 a circuit court was created at Hobart, and the Act of
1823 made provision for the political separation of the island,
which was effected two years later (1825). Van Diemen's Land was
given its own supreme court, and its own Executive and
Legislative Councils (the latter consisting of seven persons) all
on the New South Wales pattern. The administrator, though
nominally designated Lieutenant-Governor, had all the powers of a
Governor, inasmuch as the Governor of New South Wales no longer
interfered in the conduct of the island's affairs. The
constitutional changes made by the Act of 1828 took effect in Van
Diemen's Land also; but the little colony was left behind in
1842, when New South Wales was allowed to elect two-thirds of her
Councillors. Not until 1850 did Van Diemen's Land enjoy this
privilege. In common with Victoria and South Australia, the
colony was brought into constitutional line with the Mother State
by the Imperial Act of that year which, as we have already seen,
permitted the various colonial Legislatures to draft
Constitutions for themselves. Tasmania, which in 1836 had adopted
the new name so as to free herself from the stigma attaching to
the old one, elected to have a bicameral system. Unlike the
system in operation in the parent colony, both Council and
Assembly were to be elective Houses, the electoral franchise
being on either a property or an educational basis. At the
present time Councillors are appointed for six years, and are
elected by freeholders, leaseholders, medical and legal
practitioners, clergymen, naval and military officers; whilst
adult suffrage obtains in the election of members to the
Assembly. The Legislative Council at present consists of eighteen
members, and the Assembly of thirty. One effect of an elective
Council has been that this Chamber has claimed equal rights with
the Assembly in all respects except that of originating money
bills, and it even ventures to amend these.</p>
<p>Tasmania was more advanced than the other States in her method
of electing her representatives, in that she was the first to
adopt a modification of the Hare system of election. The State is
divided into five electorates, each returning six candidates.
Electors may vote for any number of candidates, not less than
three, but must signify the order of their preference by placing
the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., after the names of the candidates
they favour. By a system of counting and transferring votes from
rejected candidates and candidates who have surplus support to
those next preferred by the electoral system that appears
intricate to the average elector, but is in reality very simple,
and, with properly prepared tables and an efficient staff, almost
automatic&mdash;the final result corresponds with the relative
strength of the political parties concerned. In 1909, for
example, one political party had, according to the ballot-box
returns, 19,067 supporters, whilst 29,893 voters gave their
support elsewhere. The smaller party was, therefore, entitled to
11.69 representatives or to the nearest integer, 12. This was
precisely the strength of the party in the next Assembly. This
guarantee of the proper representation of minorities, together
with the fact that the electors find no more difficulty in
recording their vote than in the more usual method, has led the
Tasmanians to regard their system as the most advanced and most
satisfactory system of voting employed in any civilised country.
* In the system of representation in operation in New South Wales
it is possible for one political party having large minorities,
say, in any six contiguous electorates to be entirely
unrepresented so far as these particular electorates are
concerned, simply because the opposite party, by commanding
slight majorities in each of the six, can "scoop the pool". In
Tasmania, these six electorates would be welded into one, and the
system of preferential voting would ensure the representation of
the parties in proportion to their relative strength. No party
would be unrepresented, unless by reason of its numerical
weakness it were not entitled to representation. The system of
"preferential" voting is also applied to by-elections when one
candidate only is to be returned, and secures an absolute
majority for the successful candidate, without recourse to a
second ballot.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The elections of 1910 and 1913 seem to suggest
that when the electors throughout the State are nearly equally
divided into two parties, the result does not allow of sufficient
preponderance to either party in the Assembly to carry on the
Government without undue embarrassment. But as a similar result
is possible under other electoral systems, it is scarcely correct
to regard it as a defect peculiar to the preferential
system.]</p>

<h3>NEW ZEALAND.</h3>
<p>New Zealand has interest for us because it is a part of
Australasia, and was for a short time under the administration of
the Governor of New South Wales. Moreover, it still remains, if
not an actual, at least a potential, member of the Australian
Commonwealth.</p>
<p>New Zealand was annexed by Captain Cook, and in 1840 treated
more definitely as a dependency of New South Wales. But on the
3rd May, 1841, it was constituted a separate colony, with
Auckland as its seat of Government. The administration was in the
hands of the Governor and a Council of six, including three
officials&mdash;the Colonial Secretary, Colonial Treasurer and
Attorney-General. In 1852 an Act was passed by which
representative government of a somewhat federal nature was
established. The colony was divided into six provinces
(subsequently increased to nine), each with its elected
Superintendent and elected Provincial Council. These Councils
were elected for four years, though they could be dissolved
earlier by the Governor. They had control of education,
immigration, harbours, construction of roads and bridges, and, a
little later, of the sale of Crown Lands. The Governor could veto
the ordinances of the Council or the election of the
Superintendent. The whole of the provinces were united for
general purposes, the government being vested in the Governor,
Legislative Council and House of Representatives. The Council
consisted of the Governor's nominees, who held their seats for
life, and the House of Representatives of elected members, the
franchise being on a liberal property basis. The first General
Assembly met in 1854. No specific mention of responsible
government had been made in the Act, but attempts to form mixed
Ministries of members and non-members of Parliament failed; and,
when the Secretary for the Colonies had pointed out that an Act
establishing responsible government was unnecessary, responsible
Ministries became the order of the day.</p>
<p>After over two decades of government on the above lines, in
the course of which the capital was shifted to Wellington (1865),
the General Assembly, availing itself of its powers to amend the
Constitution, made a complete sweep of the provincial system, by
abolishing the provinces and subdividing tho colony into counties
(1876). This change established local government. From that date
the Government of New Zealand has been on unitary in place of
federal lines. The members of the Legislative Council arc still
nominated by the Governor, but since 1891 the appointment has
been for seven years, and not for life, though reappointment is
permissible. Two Councillors are Maoris. The House of
Representatives consists of eighty members&mdash;four
representing Maori constituencies. The House is elected for three
years, but according to the usual operation of the British system
of government, it is subject to dissolution earlier. Plurality of
voting, (<i>i.e.</i> the granting of more than one vote to any
one person) was abolished in 1889, and four years later women
were given the right to vote, though not to enter Parliament. A
property qualification was recognised until 1896, when it was
abandoned in favour of universal franchise, one year's residence
in the Dominion, and three months' in an electorate entitling one
to vote. Since September, 1907, New Zealand has been designated
the Dominion of New Zealand.</p>

<h3>Chapter V.<br>
<br>
CONDITIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF FEDERALISM.</h3>
<p>Federation is by no means a purely modern idea, as history
reveals federal systems in operation between two and three
thousand years ago. In ancient Greece, for example, alliances or
leagues of a federal character were formed between one city state
and another for the purpose of protection against their more
powerful enemies. Yet it is only within comparatively recent
times that the theory of federation has been clearly comprehended
in all its fulness, or that the acceptance of certain federal
principles has become consciously regarded as a necessary
fundamental condition of union. Statesmen are now thoroughly
seized with the complex relations of the parts to the whole
within the union. They have learnt how to form a larger entity
out of smaller entities without destroying the latter, or
confusing essentials and accidentals.</p>
<p>And here we have, at the outset, the main characteristic of a
federal system. It differs from other systems of government in
attempting to bring together under a political bond a number of
States without sacrificing their individuality. The States still
retain their separate existence and independence in some
particulars, though they surrender their powers to a central
government in matters that affect the Federated States in common.
Thus we have sovereign powers existing within a sovereign power,
and neither can encroach on the sovereignty of the other. As
Bryce expresses it "The problems which all federated nations have
to solve is how to secure an efficient central government, and
preserve national unity, while allowing free scope for the
diversities, and free play to the authorities, of the members of
the federation."</p>
<p>A federal form of government is possible only under certain
conditions. The fundamental conditions are set out by Dicey.</p>
<p class="negindent">(1) The countries desiring to federate must
have some community of race, language, history or economic
interest.</p>
<p class="negindent">(2) There must be a strong desire to unite
for some purposes, and yet to retain provincial independence in
other matters. The states "must desire union and must not desire
unity". *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Dicey, "The Law of the Constitution", p.
137.]</p>
<p>One writer adds a third condition, which, however, applies to
the successful maintenance of other forms of government as well
as of the federal. It requires "a high degree of political
capacity and a habit of observance of law".</p>
<p>There would also be some justification for considering
geographical adjacency as a fourth condition, ** since no
federation has yet been formed where that condition was absent.
The scattered character of the British Empire is considered by
some to be an unanswerable objection to the establishment of an
Imperial federation.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Dicey includes locality in the first
condition.]</p>
<p>Federal systems may be divided roughly into two classes,
according to the extent of the powers granted to the central
government. In some, the powers of the federal body are
considerably restricted, and the authority and scope of the
provincial bodies remain but little affected. Such a system is
known as a <i>Confederation</i> or <i>Staatenbund</i>. The term
is particularly applicable to a system in which the central body
has nothing or little to do with the people directly, but is
selected by, and communicates with, the governments of the
various provinces. In fact, we have ceased to apply the terms
"federal" and "federation" to such a system. The resolutions of
this central body can scarcely be regarded as legislation,
because it lacks the administrative power to render them
operative. The loose form of union in Germany between the years
1815 and 1870 is an example of the Staatenbund. The Federal Diet
in that instance had little or no authority, apart from that
acquired for it through the personal influence of its most
prominent member&mdash;Metternich. The Confederation of the
United States in its earlier form, and the Australian
pseudo-confederation established under the Federal Council Act of
1885, were of similar nature. The main defect of such a system
is, of course, the utter impotence of the central body to enforce
its decisions, or to prevent the secession of any of its members
who find the acts of the Federal body in any way distasteful. It
was the anticipation of such a disastrous termination to American
Confederation that caused Washington to make an urgent appeal to
the States to amend and strengthen their national Constitution,
and thus preserve the Union intact. *</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Vide</i> Chapter XII.]</p>
<p>In the second class of federal systems, the national
body&mdash;using the term "national" ** to refer to the Federated
States as a whole&mdash;may have very complete and far-reaching
powers, enabling it to legislate and to administer its own laws,
and within certain limits to be independent of State control;
whilst the States, shorn of the powers which are transferred to
"the Federal Government, are to that extent restricted in their
sovereignty. Moreover, the Federal lawmakers and administrators
receive their office, not from the State Governments, but
directly from the people&mdash;though, as will be shown later, a
proportion of the representatives are commissioned to safeguard
State interests. Such a system is called a <i>Federation</i> or
<i>Bundesstaat</i>. The United States, since 1789, Germany since
1871, Switzerland, the Dominion of Canada, and the Commonwealth
of Australia, are examples of this type.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Throughout, the terms "national" and
"central" are used interchangeably with the term "federal".]</p>
<p>It will be noticed that the people of Federated States are in
the peculiar position of owing allegiance to two sovereigns. As
citizens of a State they must submit themselves to the laws of
the State and render the dues demanded by the State; as citizens
of the Federation they are similarly subject to the demands of
the National Government. "Each citizen has a double citizenship
and a double allegiance; his political rights and duties fall
into two bundles, the one referable to his particular State, the
other to a Nation." ***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Garran, "The Coming Commonwealth", p.
18.]</p>
<p>A federation of States differs from a league of independent
States, in that the former necessitates the establishment of a
central government invested with sovereign legislative and
administrative powers, of which the States cannot deprive it;
whilst the latter is impotent to carry out the collective will
against the individual will of any of the States, inasmuch as its
existence is based on a continued mutual sanction of the States,
any of which may secede from it at will. In other words, the
authority of the league exists solely and entirely on the
sufferance of the members constituting it. A federation also
differs from a "unification" of States, since in the latter the
sovereign authority is exercised solely by the central body, the
States having surrendered theirs at the time of union, and
thereby lost their political individuality. As States, they are
extinguished. Any powers exercised by them must be first
delegated to them by the central body, which may also withdraw
those powers at will. The States would thus be very much in the
position of magnified shires with councils, whatever powers or
activities they possessed being due to a higher authority, and
liable to withdrawal or cancellation at any time. The Union of
South Africa is an instance of this type.</p>
<p>As a system of government, federalism carries with it certain
advantages and disadvantages, some of which are peculiar to
itself. Yet, as we have already shown, its suitability or
otherwise for any country depends entirely upon the conditions
prevailing in that country, and the general disposition of the
inhabitants towards it. The general advantages may be directly
summarised as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) For large areas, federalism is preferable to a more highly
centralised form of government; the latter, if not unworkable, is
at least inexpedient. The former is the best means of developing
a new and extensive country with some interests common to all its
parts, yet with local conditions so diverse as to necessitate
separate treatment. "It allows for the adjustment of legislation
to local requirements, where unification might aim at a
disastrous uniformity of legislation for States under vastly
different conditions." "The loose structure of a Federal
Government, and the scope it gives for diversities of legislation
in different parts of a country, may avert sources of discord or
prevent local discord from growing into a content of national
magnitude. *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Bryce, "American Commonwealth", I., p.
349.]</p>
<p>(2) It is also preferable to the existence of independent
States side by side, where this would be a menace to internal
peace and economic progress, and an invitation to foreign attack.
Federation is for such States a possible form of Union. Local
provincial prejudices may render unification an impossible
solution. Common interests and a common danger render complete
separation inconvenient and dangerous. Federation is thus a means
of reconciling the opposing forces of centralisation and
localisation (or provincialism) by leaving room for local
patriotisms whilst satisfying the yearnings for a larger national
life. It remedies the narrowness of outlook of provincialism, yet
avoids the possibility of a despotic central government.</p>
<p>(3) Federalism allows of provincial government, which, being
closer at hand, and perhaps more immediately under the public eye
than the central government, is a greater factor towards the
development of popular interest in civic matters. The political
education of the people is thus more thoroughly effected "Where
other things are equal, the more power given to the units which
compose the nation, be they large or small, and the less to the
nation as a whole, and to its central authority, so much the
fuller will be the liberties and so much greater the energy of
the individuals who compose the people." Each citizen has a
relatively greater stake and share, and consequently a greater
interest in the issues before the country.</p>
<p>(4) The central government in a Federation, as compared with
that where Unification has been effected, is less likely to break
down by reason of the weight of its functions. The provincial
bodies necessarily relieve it of a great deal of the legislative
and administrative burdens. Without the assistance of State
machinery, the central parliament and government would be more
liable to break down by reason of the great mass of questions
demanding attention, and allow the national business to get into
hopeless arrears.</p>
<p>(5) Bryce also suggests that Federalism allows of experiments
in legislation and administration which could not safely be made
in a large unified country. Just as a vessel with a number of
water-tight compartments still remains buoyant after one of the
compartments is injured, so the Federal ship of State remains
afloat even though some political experiment has brought disaster
to one of the States. The risk is confined to one State, and the
damage perhaps more remediable than under a unified system.</p>
<p>On the other hand, federal systems are not without certain
drawbacks. The liability to secession, for instance, would be
greater where a State retained sufficient independence and
individuality to make it resentful as a State. Yet the influence
of the American Civil War must not be overlooked in this
connection. As a result of that struggle it is now almost
universally accepted as a definite federal understanding that a
State is not free to withdraw at will from a Federal Union. The
Commonwealth is constitutionally perpetual and indissoluble.</p>
<p>Further, federalism is likely to result in State "cliquism".
There may be a tendency for States with kindred interests to
combine in order to frustrate the will of the remaining States,
whose interests are opposed to theirs. Should the interests of
the larger States, for example, conflict with those of the
smaller, the latter would probably go to the wall. This defect,
however, may be anticipated by the adoption of the bicameral
system of Legislature, in which one of the Houses may be so
constituted that all the States are equally represented, and so
are on an equal footing.</p>
<p>It is held by some that federalism often prevents a uniformity
among the States in legislation or administration in many matters
where it is urgently required. Perhaps the answer to this
objection would be that such a disadvantage can be obviated by
deciding what powers should be handed over to the central
government and what retained by the States, or by providing means
for constitutional amendment, which may be utilised whenever
necessity demands it.</p>
<p>Federalism, it is contended, involves expense, delay and
trouble, because of the double system of legislation and
administration. This duplication of machinery, however, is
perhaps an advantage in that greater efficiency results.
"Smoothness of working is secured by elaboration of device."
*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Bryce, "The American Commonwealth".]</p>
<p>The objection is raised that federation is an unstable form of
government. The influences at work are either pulling towards
unification or complete separation. This argument, however, is
scarcely supported by facts. The solidarity of the present-day
federal systems suggests that the want of stability is apparent
rather than real; and after the disappearance of the initial
friction and irritation often evident during the early period of
adjustment to new conditions, there is usually every promise of
long continuance of the federal bond. The great Federations of
America and Europe seem more firmly established to-day than at
the time of their inauguration. Yet, of course, even these are
young, and time alone will prove their permanence.</p>
<br>
<p>As already observed, the federal form of government is more
complicated than other systems, as it seeks to retain the
sovereignty for the States in matters of provincial interest, and
establish a national sovereignty in matters of a national
significance. The compromise must be so effected as to avoid a
collision of powers. Friction will result if the balance is not
finely and carefully adjusted. The situation is now generally met
by defining and thus limiting the powers of either the State or
the Federal Government, leaving the powers of the other
indefinite and, except for the reserved powers, unlimited. It may
be that certain powers are definitely assigned to the national
government, and all the undefined questions left to provincial
control or <i>vice versa</i>, the State's powers may be
enumerated and the indefinite residue vested in the central body.
The United States Constitution is an example of the former type,
that of Canada an example of the latter. Australia has in this
particular followed on the lines laid down by the United
States.</p>
<p>Seeing, then, that one of the essential features of a federal
system is the distribution of powers between the provincial and
national bodies, a written Constitution is necessary in order to
indicate in clear and unmistakable terms exactly what division of
powers has been agreed upon. A written document is something
definite to refer to, and a safeguard of the rights of both State
and Commonwealth. Without it there would be constant
encroachments of the activities of the one body on the rights of
the other. Custom and tradition would form a very uncertain and
unsatisfactory arbiter. But with a written law binding both State
and Nation, the risk of friction is minimised. Should the Federal
Parliament legislate on any matter that is a purely State
concern, the Act is constitutionally invalid. And similarly,
State legislation encroaching on the Federal domain does not hold
good. The Constitution therefore is, and must be, supreme, so
that there may be certainty as to where the State and the Nation
stand relatively to one another, and so that the State powers may
be placed beyond the control of or seizure by the Federation, and
the Federal powers protected against resumption by the States. In
other words, the Constitution is above the National and the State
Legislatures.</p>
<p>But if the Constitution is to remain supreme, and the
distribution of powers between Nation and States, is fixed by it,
the logical effect is that an "interpretative" body must be
created to decide whether an Act infringes the Constitution or
not. Without such a body, legislation might be inconsistent with
the Constitution, and yet be operative because no one was
empowered to declare its invalidity. Without it, it is quite
conceivable that the Federal Government may exceed its
Constitutional rights and trespass on State ground. The
sovereignty of the State may be endangered, and both the
"rigidity" of the Constitution and the Federal character of the
union in jeopardy. With an encroaching Federal Parliament, in the
absence of an interpretative body, the Constitution would
practically be rendered "flexible" ** and unification might
easily result. There must be "a guardian of the Constitution"
since "the legal Supremacy of the Constitution is essential to
the existence of the State". The Federal Convention which met at
Philadelphia in 1787, was the first to hit upon the device of
constituting the Federal Supreme Court Judges the "guardian", and
its example has been followed by Canada and Australia. In these
countries the Federal Court can be appealed to as the "final
interpreter of the Constitution", and can decide whether a law
proposed by the Federal Parliament encroaches on the rights of
the State Legislatures and vice versa. This is generally done
indirectly. Bills that have been passed successfully through all
the legislating processes are not necessarily referred to the
judges of the Federal Court, but, as in the United States, if a
case is brought before them, it may be that in arriving at some
decision on that case they may have to express their views on the
validity or otherwise of the Federal Act.</p>
<p class="foot">[** For the use of the terms "flexible" and
"rigid" see pages 119 and 120.]</p>
<p>Again, if the Constitution is supreme, a natural question to
ask is, "How can it be changed whenever it is discovered to be
defective in any particular?" In England, though one speaks of
"the Constitution" and of "fundamental laws", there is neither
one nor the other in the sense in which the people of a
Federation understand the terms. If any of the so-called
fundamental laws of England are distasteful or unsatisfactory,
the British Parliament can remove them by the simple ordinary
legislative process. It would rescind the law or pass another in
the usual way. For example, it may be regarded as a fundamental
law that England should be governed by a King and two Houses of
Parliament. If the Parliament, however, were to agree by the
ordinary methods to abolish one House, the original arrangement
is set aside at once. In other words, Parliament controls the
Constitution. Such a Constitution is said to be "flexible",
because it is alterable without recourse to any extraordinary
procedure. Flexible Constitutions are possible, however, only
where complete political unity or unification exists. But in
Australia, the United States and the other Federal countries, the
Constitution is above simple Parliamentary interference, and
controls the Parliament. Any measure which violates the
Constitution is invalid, even though it has proceeded through all
the stages of an ordinary bill. If it were allowed the Federal
Parliament to amend the Constitution when it so desired, the
States would be at its mercy. On the other hand, it is clearly
inconceivable to allow the State Parliament to amend it, since
the Federal Parliament would be deprived of its sovereignty. The
system would be of the nature of a weak Staatenbund or
Confederation. "A Federal Constitution is in one aspect a compact
between certain high contracting parties in the States and the
Nation; and such a compact would lack stability if one of the
parties could alter it at will."</p>
<p>Yet it is evident that a Constitution cannot remain unaltered
for ever. Unless provision be made for its amendment, the
Constitution may clog the wheels of progress, and result in the
accumulation of a strong force of discontent which, when it does
break out, may carry with it to total destruction the whole
fabric of the Federal system. The difficulty is surmounted by
placing an amending power jointly in the hands of the people and
the Federal Parliament, or by requiring unusual majorities in the
Legislatures, or by the assembling of special constituent
conventions representing both State and National interests, or by
some such extraordinary procedure. This safeguard against
ill-considered amendment renders the Constitution "rigid"&mdash;a
term which signifies that some extraordinary authority, is
required before a change can be effected. Thus, though we have
spoken of a double sovereignty&mdash;that of the States, and that
of the Nation&mdash;yet we can regard neither as sovereign in an
absolute sense. Parliamentary sovereignty is limited by and
subject to the Federal Constitution, and the force or amending
power behind the Constitution is the real sovereign. In the
United States the real sovereign is three-fourths of the
Legislatures of the States; in Australia it is the people taken
collectively and as States, together with the Federal Parliament
acting under special conditions. ****</p>

<h3>Chapter VI.<br>
<br>
THE FEDERAL MOVEMENT IN AUSTRALIA.</h3>
<p>The federal movement in Australia owes its origin in part to a
failure in 1842 to establish reciprocal freetrade conditions
between the colonies of New South Wales, New Zealand and Van
Diemen's Land. The Legislature of the parent colony purposed
admitting the produce and manufactures of the other two colonies
free of duty. The Secretary for the Colonies, however, refused to
allow the proposed Act on the ground that British policy
prohibited the colonies setting up differential duties, as they
led to retaliation and protection. Curiously enough, the effect
of this disallowance seemed to be to render tariff warfare
between the colonies inevitable; the duties already imposed would
tend to become heavier and so revenue tariffs to develop into
protective tariffs. Fear of this led Deas Thomson, Colonial
Secretary in New South Wales, to make the first suggestion of a
federal union of the Australian colonies. Speaking through
Governor Fitzroy, in 1846, he recommended the appointment of
"some superior functionary" to whom could be submitted all
measures passed by the various colonial Legislatures affecting
intercolonial trade or the general interests of either England or
Australia as a whole. To Deas Thomson, therefore, belongs the
honour of having originated the federal movement. "In his fertile
brain the idea first germinated, and to him Australia is indebted
for its first recorded expression. He is <i>par excellence</i>
the Father of Australian Federation." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Allin, "Early Federation Movement of
Australia", p. 55.]</p>
<p>Acting on the suggestion. Earl Grey, Secretary of State for
the Colonies, when foreshadowing the separation of the Port
Phillip district from New South Wales, made out a case for some
sort of union between the colonies. "There are questions," the
Minister affirmed, "which, though local as it respects the
British possessions of Australia collectively, are not merely
local as it respects any one of these possessions. Considered as
members of the same Empire, those colonies have many common
interests, the regulation of which, in some uniform manner and by
some single authority, may be essential to the welfare of them
all. Yet in some cases such interests may be more promptly,
effectively and satisfactorily decided by some authority within
Australia itself, than by the more remote, the less accessive,
and in truth the less competent authority of Parliament." ** It
might be arranged, he added, that the colonies should co-operate
in matters affecting their common interests, such as import and
export duties, conveyance of letters and intercolonial roads and
railways. The colonists, however, not having been consulted,
regarded the Earl's constitutional suggestions as a piece of
unwarranted interference on his part. Indignation meetings were
the order of the day, even though the idea of a common congress
was not unpopular.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Quoted by Egerton, "Federations and Unions in
the British Empire", p. 41.]</p>
<p>The question was next given serious consideration by the
Committee of the Privy Council for Trade and Plantations, to
whose deliberations Australia's constitutional problem had been
submitted. The Committee realised the necessity for uniformity in
the matter of customs duties and for the abolition of border
duties between the colonies, and thought that the danger of
tariff warfare would be obviated by federation. It therefore
recommended that one of the Governors should be constituted the
Governor-General of Australia; that he should have power to
convene a General Assembly (consisting of a single House of
Delegates) but that the first convocation should be postponed
until two or more of the local Legislatures requested him to
summon it; and that the Delegates should be chosen by the various
Legislatures, each colony sending two members at least, with an
additional member for every 15,000 inhabitants. The
last-mentioned arrangement was inserted with a view to giving New
South Wales twelve members, and Victoria. South Australia, and
Van Diemen's Land thirteen between them, whereas strictly
proportional representation would have enabled the Mother Colony
to outvote the other three colonies combined. It was suggested
that the General Assembly should be empowered to impose duties,
to legislate on such matters as letter conveyance, intercolonial
roads and railways, shipping dues, lighthouses, weights and
measures, and any other matter referred to them by the local
Parliaments, and to raise funds by taking a percentage of the
revenues of the various colonies. The question of military and
naval defence was not mentioned. A General Supreme Court was to
have power to hear appeals from the provincial courts.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Vide</i> Egerton's "Federations and Unions
within the British Empire", pp. 169-184.]</p>
<p>As the result of the Committee's report, clauses of a federal
nature were introduced into the Bill of 1850 dealing with
Australian Constitutions. A powerful opposition, however,
effected their removal, and henceforth it was felt "that a
satisfactory scheme of Australian Union must be worked out in
Australia, not in England." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Quick and Garran, "Annotated Constitution of
the Australian Commonwealth", p. 89.]</p>
<p>Earl Grey, however, could not entirely abandon the federal
idea. The Governor of New South Wales (Sir Charles Fitzroy) was
not only appointed Governor-General of the whole of Australia,
but received four separate commissions as Governor of each of the
colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, Van Diemen's Land and
South Australia. The virtual Governors of the latter three
colonies had to content themselves with the nominal title of
Lieutenant-Governor. The Governor-General was instructed not to
interfere with his subordinates' local control, though he might
act in matters of general concern, and even supersede a
Lieutenant-Governor when on a visit to his colony. This system
obtained for about five years, but was abandoned in 1856, when
full gubernatorial rank was given to His Majesty's representative
in each of the colonies. The title of Governor-General was
maintained for another five years, but lapsed at the close of Sir
William Denison's administration in 1861. Earl Grey's attempt to
impose a federal system on the Australian Colonies had failed
mainly because the movement had not emanated from the colonists.
Yet he is to be credited with having for the first time attempted
to lay down the practical details of a federal system.
Henceforth, suggestions of a federal nature were to come from the
colonial statesman, and the British Government was to play the
laggard. In accordance with the Act of 1850 entrusting the
Colonial Legislatures with the power of amending their own
Constitutions, a Committee of the New South Wales Council drew up
a Draft Constitution in 1853, and, on the proposal of Wentworth,
asserted the necessity for a General Assembly to deal with
Intercolonial matters, such as tariffs and postal arrangements,
Wentworth, however, did not go so far as Dr. Lang, whose more
comprehensive and somewhat American scheme he ridiculed, for to
Lang "a Federated Australia and a Republican Australia seemed
practically coincident ideas." Lang's influence was impaired by a
wide-spread suspicion of his leaning towards separation from
England. Wentworth, on the other hand, was an Imperialist, and in
order to dissociate himself from Lang's scheme, advocated a loose
confederate system rather than a thorough federation. *** The
question was kept to the front by Lang, as well as by Deas
Thomson and the Rev. John West, the latter of whom, under the
<i>nom de plume</i> of John Adams, contributed articles to the
<i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, **** in one of which he declared
"centripetal and centrifugal forces are perpetually operating to
prevent the undue separation or mischievous contiguity of its
various parts and powers." Wentworth, too, who had gone to
England in connection with the question of the colony's
Constitution in 1857, presented, with the assistance of the
"General Association for the Australian Colonies", a memorial on
the question to Labouchere, the new Secretary for the Colonies.
The Association even went so far as to draw up a Draft Bill,
suggesting the powers that should be conferred on the Federal
Assembly. One weakness in the scheme was that the Federal
Assembly was to be dependent for its funds on the goodwill of the
Colonial Legislatures. The Minister refused to further its cause
on the ground that there was no general demand amongst the
colonies themselves for federation. Labouchere's attitude was in
direct contrast to that adopted by Earl Grey.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Vide</i> Allin, "Early Federation
Movement of Australia.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** Several Articles between January 30 and
September 1, 1854.]</p>
<p>In view of the plea that is sometimes made for the Unification
of the Australian States, it is of interest to find that the
first suggestion of a Unified Australia dates as early as 1853,
when the residents of the Shoalhaven district presented a
petition for a conference of the Governor-General and the
Lieutenant-Governors, together with other delegates, to prepare a
single Constitution for Australia. Its acceptance, they argued,
would put an end to the incongruity of four Constitutions for
adjacent peoples of the same race and allegiance. However, the
Shoalhaven district was a voice crying in the wilderness, and the
petition was unsupported. Besides, Unification had already proved
to be impracticable, * mainly because of the imperfect
development of the means of communication.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>I.e.</i>, before 1851.]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Victorians had voiced their views through their
Constitutional Committee, of which Charles Gavan Duffy was the
most vigorous member. The Committee declared that "Neighbouring
States invariably become confederates or enemies. By becoming
confederates so early in their career, the Australian colonies
would, we believe, immensely economise their strength and
resources. They would substitute a common national interest for
local and conflicting interests, and waste no time in barren
rivalry. They would enhance the national credit, and attain much
earlier the power of undertaking works of serious cost and
importance. They would not only save time and money, but attain
increased vigour and accuracy by treating the larger questions of
public policy at one time and place." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Sir Henry Parkes, "Fifty Years in the Making
of Australian History", pp. 581-2.]</p>
<p>The Victorian Committee recommended a conference of three
representatives from each Colonial Legislature. The suggestion
was favourably received in New South Wales by Deas Thomson's
Select Committee, which in 1857 asserted that further delay would
increase the danger of antagonism and jealousy. South Australia
and Tasmania even went so far as to appoint delegates ready in
the event of the conference being held. But Ministerial changes
in New South Wales led to the indefinite postponement of the
question. Duffy persevered in Victoria with other Select
Committees, and urged for the first time the necessity of union
for defence purposes. Provincialism, however, seems to have been
the obstacle to federation in the earlier as well as in the later
stages of the movement. New South Wales was evidently jealous of
her prestige, whilst Victoria and, after 1859, Queensland, were
enjoying too keenly the sweets of independence to allow of the
Federal proposal being seriously entertained.</p>
<p>It was now felt that, if complete federation was
impracticable, at least one of the objects of a federal
union&mdash;the adoption of a uniform tariff&mdash;should receive
serious attention. For that purpose several intercolonial
conferences were held between 1855 and 1873. As a result of
these, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia agreed, at
one time, to make the Murray River trade free, at another time
that the Mother Colony should receive from Victoria a fixed money
compensation for revenue lost by this free trade. No permanent
agreement on the rivers question was arrived at. On the whole,
the purpose of the conferences remained unachieved, partly
because the Imperial Government would not hear of differential
rates being established in the colonies, and partly because the
tariff policies of Victoria and the other colonies, more
particularly that of Victoria with that of New South Wales, were
irreconcilable. The objection of the Home Government to
differential rates had, however, the effect of producing a
protest in 1871 from the Colonial Legislatures against further
Imperial interference with their fiscal policies. The protest was
repeated by the Conference of 1873, convened by Sir Henry Parkes,
which also expressed itself in favour of a Customs Union for the
purpose of levying revenue tariffs. These protests led to an
Imperial Act allowing reciprocity between the colonies, a right
that was long clamoured for, and when obtained&mdash;never
used.</p>
<p>Uniform legislation on other subjects, such as defence,
lighthouses and oversea postage, was also aimed at by means of
intercolonial conferences. It was during one such conference that
Mr. (afterwards Sir) Henry Parkes first advocated, in 1867, the
formation of a Federal Council, or, in other words, a loose form
of Confederate Union. In support of his proposal, he argued that
"there are questions projecting themselves upon our attention
which cannot be satisfactorily dealt with by any one of the
individual Governments." A proposal for the establishment of such
a Council immediately afterwards passed the New South Wales
Legislature, but was shelved by the Home Government.</p>
<p>The conferences just referred to did not seriously consider
the question of federation itself&mdash;except for Parkes'
confederate proposal&mdash;and more than a decade had elapsed
when the question was again broached by Duffy in 1870. Stimulated
perhaps by the federal settlement in Canada, a Royal Commission
enquired into the arguments for a similar development in
Australia, but ended in putting forward extravagant claims, such
as Australia's right to remain neutral when Britain was at war
and to conclude treaties with foreign powers. No progress was
made, and another lapse of ten years followed, after which
representatives from New South Wales, Victoria and South
Australia meeting in 1881, first in Melbourne and later in
Sydney, again considered at the instigation of Sir Henry Parkes
the desirability of creating a Federal Council, constituted of an
equal number of representatives from each colony. Sir Henry
addressed a memorandum to the Conference in which he
declared:&mdash;</p>
<p class="negindent">(1) "That the time is not come for the
construction of a Federal Constitution, with an Australian
Federal Parliament.</p>
<p class="negindent">(2 ) "That the time is come when a number of
matters of much concern to all the colonies might be dealt with
more effectively by some federal authority than by the colonies
separately.</p>
<p class="negindent">(3) "That an organisation which would lead
men to think in the direction of federation, and accustom the
public mind to federal ideas, would be the best preparation for
the foundation of Federal Government." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Sir Henry Parkes, "Fifty Years in the Making
of Australian History", p. 584.]</p>
<p>The Federal Council was, according to his scheme, to have
partly administrative and partly legislative functions. As,
however, neither freetrade New South Wales nor protectionist
Victoria could agree to sink their fiscal differences, the
suggestion of a Federal Council once again proved abortive.</p>
<p>External pressure, in the shape of foreign complications, was
now to influence public opinion towards a more favourable view of
Federation. The transportation of French criminals to New
Caledonia, whence migration to Australia was easy, the activity
of Germany in New Guinea, together with the apathy of the British
Government towards the representations of a single
colony&mdash;Queensland&mdash;on the question of annexation in
New Guinea, convinced several that federation was an urgent and
practical question. Accordingly, at a further conference in 1883
the six colonies of Australia, together with New Zealand and
Fiji, were represented. Mr. (afterwards Sir) Samuel Griffith, who
now entered prominently into the movement, submitted a resolution
which, after discussion and modification, resulted in the
establishment of a Federal Council. It met for the first time in
February, 1886, and consisted of two representatives from each of
the three colonies&mdash;Victoria. Queensland and Tasmania, and
one each from Western Australia and Fiji. ** Fiji dropped out
after the first session; South Australia entered temporarily,
between 1888 and 1890; but neither New South Wales nor New
Zealand had any share in it. The aloofness of the mother colony
was due to the opposition of Sir John Robertson, and especially
of Sir Henry Parkes, who had changed his views as to the value of
such a Federal Council. "In one of my tentative endeavours," he
afterwards wrote, "I committed the error of suggesting the scheme
of the Federal Council which is now dragging out a consumptive
existence under an enabling Act of the Imperial Parliament." ***
He had come to realise that such a confederacy was impracticable,
would soon break down, cover Australia with ridicule, and "impede
the way for a sure and solid federation". Moreover, the absence
of executive authority rendered the power to legislate of little
value, even though this power extended to such matters as
Australia's relations with the Pacific Islands, the prevention of
the influx of criminals, quarantine, certain aspects of maritime
defence, and any question referred to it by the local
Legislatures. The Council met periodically for fourteen years,
but made its influence but little felt, and finally its
"consumptive existence" came to an end in 1899 on the eve of the
consummation of the greater and more complete union.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Fiji and Western Australia were entitled, by
the Federal Council of Australasia Act of 1885, to two
representatives each.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Sir Henry Parkes, "Fifty Years it: the
Making of Australian History", p. 583.]</p>
<p>In 1889 the awakening of a widespread interest in the defence
question of Australia led to an increased anxiety for common
action in military and naval matters. The revival was due to a
report on our defence system by Major-General Bevan Edwards, in
which the writer recommended the federation of the forces of the
colonies, a uniform system of organisation and armament, the
establishment of a military college, and a uniform gauge for
railways. Sir Henry Parkes, realising the opportuneness of the
moment for resurrecting the federal question&mdash;for he rightly
opined that it could be borne forward to complete realisation
only on the crest of a wave of popular enthusiasm&mdash;induced
the Governments of every colony to give it their consideration
once again. At a small conference held in Melbourne early in
1890, Mr. James Service, of Victoria, declared the necessity for
slaying "the lion in the path"&mdash;the tariff
problem&mdash;whilst Sir Henry Parkes in an inspired moment gave
utterance to the now historic expression, "The crimson thread of
kinship runs through us all". A general motion favouring an early
union under the Crown was passed, and a recommendation for a more
representative convention agreed upon. Meantime, New South Wales
and New Zealand steadily resisted every invitation to join the
Federal Council already existing.</p>
<p>A Convention of forty-five delegates (seven from each
Australian colony and three from New Zealand) met in Sydney in
1891 under the presidency of Sir Henry Parkes, who was now
rightly regarded as the undoubted leader of the movement. The
Convention proceeded with considerable skill and success to draft
a Constitution. ["]The fundamental principles of union laid down
were&mdash;intercolonial freetrade, a federal tariff, federal
defence, and the reservation of provincial rights in provincial
matters; whilst the essential features of the proposed national
machinery were&mdash;a complete national government with
legislative, judicial and executive departments; a Legislature of
two chambers representing respectively the States and the Nation;
and a system of responsible government." * These principles and
features were adhered to in the draft. The danger of a break-down
on the tariff question was overcome for the time by a general
acceptance of Sir Henry Parkes' view that the fiscal question
must be left absolutely to the federated people of Australia
speaking through their Parliament. The question of representation
caused some discussion, as some of the smaller States claimed
equal representation in both the Senate and the House of
Representatives. However, the usual compromise between the two
principles of State equality and proportional representation was
agreed to, the Senate to be based on the former principle, and
constituted of an equal number of Senators from each State,
whilst the latter principle was to form the foundation of the
House of Representatives, the number of members from the States
varying in proportion to their population.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Quick and Garran, "Annotated Constitution of
the Australian Commonwealth", p. 126.]</p>
<p>The fact that the Draft Bill of 1891 underwent considerable
modifications in the later Conventions of 1897-8 ** must not be
allowed to obscure the fact that our indebtedness to the 1891
Convention is almost immeasurable. Federation ceased to be a
"misty abstraction", and became a definite and practical policy.
"In spite of imperfections, the first draft stands as a
convincing monument of the wisdom, the statesmanlike ability, and
the patriotism of its framers. In those few days they laid down
the main lines from which the movement has never since wavered."

<p class="foot">[** <i>Vide infra</i>, pp. 149-152.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Quick and Garran, "Annotated Constitution of
the Australian Commonwealth", p. 136.]</p>
<p>The Convention recommended the various State Parliaments to
arrange for the submission of the proposed Constitution to a
referendum, and, upon its adoption by three colonies, to request
the Imperial Government to arrange for its establishment.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Parkes duly introduced the question into the New
South Wales Assembly, but no real progress was made. The attack
on the Bill was led by Mr. (afterwards Sir) G. H. Reid, who,
though not opposed to federation as a general policy, was
concerned about the fate of the freetrade system of New South
Wales. He also declared that the power of the Senate was
excessive, and the principles of responsible government were not
sufficiently guaranteed. This attack, together with the
retirement of the Parkes Ministry, the general financial
depression of the early nineties, and the languor with which
Parliament addressed itself to the question, foreshadowed the
defeat of the movement, and the discussion eventually lapsed.
Consequently the other colonies, who were not prepared to move
without New South Wales, also shelved the question.</p>

THE FEDERAL MOVEMENT IN AUSTRALIA (Continued.)<br>
<br>
FEDERATION REALISED.</h3>
<p>The failure of 1891 was to be but the prelude to complete
success. The federal question was fast taking hold of the popular
mind, and Sir Henry Parkes, in 1892, suggested that the most
effective policy would be to let the people themselves elect the
next convention either to revise the old or draft a new Bill.
"Every mind in Australia", wrote the ex-Premier, "has been
familiarised with the idea of a united people". *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Sir Henry Parkes, "Fifty Years in the Making
of Australian History", p. 599.]</p>
<p>With the awakening of popular enthusiasm and the
crystallisation of a definite public opinion on the question, a
successful issue to the movement was inevitable.</p>
<p class="poem">      So flows beneath our good and ill<br>

<p class="foot">[** James Brunton Stephens, <i>The Dominion of
Australia.</i>]</p>
<p>The activity of the Australian Natives' Association in
Victoria, the creation of non-party federation leagues in various
centres, culminating in the establishment of a general
"Australian Federation League" in each colony, and the holding of
a non-parliamentary conference at Corowa in August, 1893, were
the outward manifestations of the growing popularity of the
federal idea. On the motion of Dr. Quick, of Victoria, the Corowa
Conference adopted the very important resolution that the various
local Legislatures should make provision for the election by the
people themselves of representatives to a convention which should
draft a Bill, and that this proposed Constitution should then be
submitted to a referendum. Henceforth the movement was to be
emphatically democratic.</p>
<p>With the Corowa resolution, and the accession of the Reid
Ministry to office in 1894, the last and most important stage of
the struggle was reached. The new Premier adopted a more sanguine
attitude towards the question. He declared his sympathy with the
idea of a popularly elected Convention and a popularly confirmed
Constitution. As a preliminary step he secured a conference of
Premiers at Hobart in January, 1895. It was there resolved that a
convention consisting of ten representatives from each colony
should draft the details of the proposed federal scheme, but that
it should take into consideration amendments suggested by the
local Legislatures; that the proposed Constitution should be
submitted to a referendum, after which, if accepted, it should be
sent to England for enactment by the Imperial Parliament. The New
South Wales Parliament passed the requisite "Enabling Bill",
arranging for both the election of representatives and the
referendum, and the other colonies&mdash;Queensland, for the
time, excepted&mdash;quickly followed her example. *</p>
<p class="foot">[* In Western Australia Parliament elected the
delegates.]</p>
<p>The magic wand had been waved; the people were to be
consulted, and the end was in sight. The public interest in the
question was now most keen, and a "People's Federal Convention",
consisting of invited delegates from various organisations, which
met at Bathurst in November. 1896, served the purpose of
stimulating a wide public discussion and educating the people.
Four months later keenly Contested elections of representatives
to the Statutory Convention took place in four colonies. Nearly
fifty candidates in New South Wales alone submitted themselves to
the popular vote. Mr. (now Sir) Edmund Barton easily headed the
list with the handsome poll of nearly 100,000 votes, and became
the virtual leader of the Convention. The interest in the other
colonies was scarcely less keen; but in Western Australia the
delegates were not chosen by the people, but by a joint sitting
of the two Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p>The Convention had sessions in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne
respectively (1897-8). At the first session the principles of
federation as laid down in 1891 were agreed to, and it was
further declared that another purpose of federation, was "to
enlarge the powers of self-government of the people of
Australia". A draft Bill, resembling the 1891 Bill in its general
features, but with important modifications and additions, was
agreed to. The tariff question caused no trouble, as that "lion
in the path" had been slain by the suggestion of Sir Henry Parkes
in 1891 to the effect that the problem was one for federated
Australia to solve. The following were amongst the most important
determinations: the Senate or States' Assembly was to be elected
directly by the people instead of by the State Legislatures; the
House of Representatives, elected on a population basis, was to
be numerically twice as strong as the Senate; whilst responsible
government was specifically provided for by a clause requiring
that Ministers should not hold office for more than three months
without a seat in Parliament. Proposed amendments of the
Constitution were to be passed by both Houses of Legislature in
the first instance, and then to receive the direct sanction of
the people before they could take effect.</p>
<p>Between the first and second sessions the proposals were
referred to the Colonial Parliaments, and a strong opposition was
at once evident in New South Wales, though all the other colonies
were more favourably disposed towards them. Differences of
opinion between the larger and smaller States on the question of
the representation in the Senate were again prominent, the bone
of contention being the same as in 1891. The large States wanted
Senate representation on a population basis, the smaller States
plumped for State equality, with increased powers for the Senate
in the matter of money bills.</p>
<p>The second session of the Convention commenced in September,
1897, Queensland being still unrepresented. The members were
faced with nearly 300 amendments sent forward by the State
Legislatures, referring to the various clashing interests of the
States. The main problems had to do with&mdash;</p>
<p class="smallindent">1. the system of representation in the
Senate;<br>
2. the Senate's powers over money bills;<br>
3. the financial arrangements between the States and the proposed
Commonwealth;<br>
4. Provisions against deadlocks;<br>
5. the control of navigable rivers.</p>
<p>Eventually it was decided that the principle of State equality
should be adhered to for the Senate; deadlocks should be overcome
by a dissolution of the two Houses, followed, if necessary, by a
joint sitting, at which, however, a three-fifths majority should
be necessary to secure the passage of a measure.</p>
<p>In the final session at Melbourne (January to March, 1898) the
financial problem was thrashed out and Sir Edward Braddon secured
the passage of a clause&mdash;popularly known as the "Braddon
blot"&mdash;providing for the return of three-fourths of the net
revenue from Customs and Excise to the States. It was expected
that this provision would prevent any serious disturbance of the
States' revenues. The question of the control of navigable rivers
gave the Convention considerable difficulty, as South Australia
wanted it handed over to the Federal Parliament, whereas New
South Wales considered that her scheme of irrigation and water
conservation would be endangered if she lost control of her own
rivers. A compromise was eventually effected. Navigation was to
be a matter for federal control, but this control was not to
abridge the rights of a State or its people to "reasonable use"
of river waters for conservation and irrigation. No attempt was
made to define the term "reasonable use".</p>
<p>The recognition of the Deity by the insertion in the
Constitution of the phrase "humbly relying upon the blessing of
Almighty God" having been determined upon, the deliberations of
the Convention were brought to a close. Mr. Kingston of South
Australia, speaking from the chair, voiced the general feeling of
satisfaction and expectation when he declared the Bill to be "the
most magnificent Constitution into which the chosen
representatives of a free and enlightened people have ever
breathed the life of popular sentiment and national hope."</p>
<p>The Constitution had now to be submitted to the vote of the
people in four colonies, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and
South Australia. Western Australia awaited the result in these
colonies before taking any action. New South Wales was the storm
centre. Equal State representation in the Senate was still
objected to, on the ground that the will of the majority would be
overridden; the Labour Party demanded the referendum as a means
of overcoming deadlocks; the provisions in the Braddon clause
were regarded with horror, since they apparently necessitated
immense customs revenue, and therefore involved increased
taxation, especially in the freetrade colony of New South Wales;
whilst there was considerable anxiety as to whether the federal
capital was to be located in the mother colony. Consequently when
Mr. Reid criticised the Bill somewhat adversely and practically
threw his influence on the side of the Anti-Billites, the fate of
the Constitution became extremely problematical, despite the
announcement of his intention to vote for its acceptance.</p>
<p>Victoria, having already adopted a protectionist policy, had
no fear of increased taxation through Federal Customs. This
colony was consequently much more favourably disposed to the
Bill, and this inclination was increased by the influence of the
Australian Natives' Association. The opposition forces were also
weak in South Australia and Tasmania, though the former colony
was dubious as to the cost of federation.</p>
<p>The referendum was taken on the 3rd June, 1898, * and gave a
majority in the four colonies in favour of the Bill, but in New
South Wales the statutory number of votes&mdash;80,000&mdash;had
not been recorded for acceptance, and consequently the measure
was rejected. In the other colonies the declaration for the Bill
was most emphatic. The actual poll was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Opposition in New South Wales was not so much to
federation itself as to the particular Bill before the country,
and as the federalists were not prepared to abandon the movement,
it was clear that concessions must be made to the opponents in
the shape of suitable alterations in the Bill. The chief
amendments sought were (1) the removal of the three-fifths
majority at the joint sitting of the two Houses in cases of
deadlocks; (2) the expunging of the "Braddon blot"; and (3) the
location of the federal capital in New South Wales. Mr. Reid,
having been continued in power as the result of the general
elections of 1898, immediately applied himself once again to the
problem, and the Premiers met in conference in Melbourne in
January, 1899. On this occasion Queensland was represented. The
concessions required by New South Wales were practically granted.
The substitution of an absolute majority for the three-fifths
majority at joint sittings was agreed to. The operation of the
Braddon clause was limited to ten years, and thereafter until
Parliament made other provision. The capital was to be fixed in
New South Wales, but not within a radius of 100 miles from
Sydney, and, until the capital was established Melbourne was to
be the seat of government.</p>
<p>Although the Draft Bill of 1891 is generally regarded as the
basis of the Constitution that was ultimately accepted in 1899,
yet the original had in the meantime undergone very substantial
modifications, and it is well at this stage to summarise the main
points of difference between the two measures.</p>
<p>The following provisions had been made in the Bill of
1891:&mdash;</p>
<p class="negindent">(a) The State Legislatures were to elect the
Senators, eight from each State, who were to be not less than
thirty years of age and resident for at least five years in
Australia.</p>
<p class="negindent">(b) Proposed constitutional amendments were
to be ratified first by the Federal Parliament and then by State
conventions which were to be elected as the Federal Parliament
provided.</p>
<p class="negindent">(c) The suffrage for the election of
Representatives was to be left to the control of the State
Legislatures, which should also determine the electoral
divisions.</p>
<p class="negindent">(d) Surplus federal revenue, after all
federal expenditure had been provided for, was to be returned to
the States in proportion to the amount raised within each.</p>
<p class="indent">No provision had been made in the earlier
measure for deadlocks between the two Federal Houses; insurance,
invalid and old age pensions, the treatment of alien races, and
industrial disputes had been omitted from the enumeration of the
federal powers; and, there was no assurance that the system of
responsible government would obtain, since it would be possible
for the Executive to include Ministers who had no seat in
Parliament. The Bill merely declared that the Executive officers
should be capable of sitting as members in Parliament, the
intention being, according to Sir Samuel Griffith who was
answerable for the clause, that responsible government should be
possible, but not necessary. Moreover, the establishment of a
Federal Supreme Court was to be at the Federal Parliament's
discretion.</p>
<p>It will easily be seen that the first and second of the above
proposals were considerably less democratic than those eventually
adopted. The people were to have a direct voice neither in the
personnel of the Senate nor in the alteration of the
Constitution.</p>
<p>In contrast to these proposals of the 1891 Bill, the
Constitution of 1899 provided:&mdash;</p>
<p class="negindent">(a) That Senators should be elected by the
people, the electors of a State acting as one constituency. The
qualifications of a Senator were to be the same as those for a
Member of the House of Representatives, <i>i.e.</i>, he must be
twenty-one years of age and resident within the Commonwealth for
at least three years.</p>
<p class="negindent">(b) Proposed amendments of the Constitution
were to be submitted to a referendum, and be ratified by a
majority of voters in a majority of States, as well as by a
majority of the aggregate voting.</p>
<p class="negindent">(c) The federal suffrage was to be a matter
of federal control, though uniformity throughout the Commonwealth
was to be observed.</p>
<p class="negindent">(d) The financial relations between the
Commonwealth and the States were determined for ten years by the
Braddon clause&mdash;which has already been explained&mdash;after
which the Federal Parliament could make other arrangements.</p>
<p class="negindent">(e) Deadlocks were provided for by a double
dissolution, and, as a last resort, by a joint sitting of the
Houses.</p>
<p class="negindent">(f) The question of insurance, old age and
invalid pensions, alien races, conciliation and arbitration of
industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of one State, and
railway construction and extension in a State with the consent of
that State, were added to the Federal powers.</p>
<p class="negindent">(g) Responsible government was assured by
requiring all Ministers to hold seats in Parliament.</p>
<p class="negindent">(h) The Federal High Court was established
by the Constitution, and its interpretation of the Constitution
was to be final. *</p>
<p class="foot">[* These details will be referred to again in the
more systematic analysis of the Constitution (vide Chapters VIII.
and IX.), but are mentioned here to indicate the progress made
since 1891.]</p>
<p>The proposed Constitution was once again submitted to the
people, and in New South Wales, by means of new appointments to
the Legislative Council, the Enabling Act was modified in order
to recognise the decision of a simple majority of the electors
voting. When Mr. Reid expressed his adherence to the Bill its
acceptance was assured. The referendum of the 20th June, 1899,
resulted in a heavier poll and a decidedly increased majority in
favour of the measure. South Australia had already given its
decision (April), and Victoria and Tasmania reiterated their
previous acceptance with a most emphatic poll. Three months later
Queensland, largely influenced by the decision in New South
Wales, also gave a respectable majority for the Bill. The actual
polling was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These figures", write Quick and Garran, "are a striking proof
of the extent and sincerity of the national sentiment throughout
the whole of eastern Australia; and they are also a unique
testimony to the high political capacity of the Australian
people. Never before have a group of self-governing, practically
independent communities, without external pressure or foreign
complications of any kind, deliberately chosen of their own free
will to put aside their provincial jealousies and come together
as one people, from a simple intellectual and sentimental
conviction of the folly of disunion and the advantages of
nationhood." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Quick and Garran, "Annotated Constitution of
the Australian Commonwealth", p. 225.]</p>
<p>Western Australia now reconsidered the Bill and asked for four
amendments, the chief being an unrestricted power to impose
inter-colonial customs duties for five years. Sir John Forrest
put his views before the other Premiers, but it was felt that the
acceptance of the Bill by five colonies precluded any further
amendments.</p>
<p>A delegation of one Member from each colony, including Western
Australia, and, at a later stage, New Zealand, proceeded to
England to see the Bill through the Imperial Parliament. Air.
Barton was recognised as the leader of the delegation. The
Secretary of State for the Colonies was anxious to insert several
amendments protecting Imperial interests, but the delegates
insisted that the Bill should be passed in the form already
accepted by the people of Australia. The Minister gave way on all
points but the question of appeal to the Privy Council. He felt
that the right of appeal should not be restricted, but that Her
Majesty's subjects in the colonies should "feel that we offer
them the finest court of ultimate appeal the Empire can produce."
*** It was contended that the bonds uniting the two countries
would thus be strengthened. Eventually the difficulty was
overcome by allowing appeal from the High Court to the Queen in
Council on constitutional questions only when the High Court of
Australia should certify that the question was one which ought to
be carried on to the Queen in Council, and that the Queen's
prerogative to grant special appeal to Herself in Council should
not be otherwise impaired. Any proposed law limiting the matters
in which such leave should be granted was to be reserved for the
Queen's assent. "The result, therefore, was a compromise. The
long-expected general Court of Appeal was established; and the
appeal to the Privy Council was retained under conditions which,
whatever their demerits, respect local and Imperial sentiment,
and in the main preserve the royal prerogative without creating
the evil of a multiplicity of appeals." ****</p>

A PROCLAMATION,</small></p>
<blockquote><small><small>       VICTORIA R.</small></small><br>
<small>WHEREAS by an Act of Parliament passed in the Sixty-third
and Sixty-fourth Years of Our Reign intituled, "An Act to
constitute the Commonwealth of <i>Australia</i>", it is enacted
that it shall be lawful for the Queen, with the advice of the
Privy Council, to declare by Proclamation, that, on and after a
day therein appointed, not being later than One Year after the
passing of this Act, the people of <i>New South Wales, Victoria.
South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania</i>, and also, if Her
Majesty is satisfied that the people of <i>Western Australia</i>
have agreed thereto, of <i>Western Australia</i>, shall be united
in a Federal Commonwealth under the name of the Commonwealth of
Australia.<br>
<br>
And whereas We are satisfied that the people of <i>Western
Australia</i> have agreed thereto accordingly.<br>
<br>
We, therefore, by and with the advice of Our Privy Council, have
thought fit to issue this Our Royal Proclamation, and We do
hereby declare that on and after the First day of <i>January</i>
One thousand nine hundred and one the people of <i>New South
Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania</i>, and
<i>Western Australia</i> shall be united in a Federal
Commonwealth under the name of the Commonwealth of
Australia.</small></blockquote>
<p align="center"><small>Given at Our Court at Balmoral, this
Seventeenth day of <i>September</i>, in the Year of our Lord One
thousand nine hundred, and in the Sixty-fourth Year of Our
Reign.</small><br></p>

<br>
<br>
QUEEN VICTORIA'S PROCLAMATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH.</small><br>
<br>
<i>(Reduced Facsimile)</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>With this modification, the Bill passed the Imperial
Parliament, and was signed by the Queen on the 9th July, 1900.
The attempts of the Western Australian delegate to obtain more
advantageous fiscal concessions for his State, and of the New
Zealand delegate to reserve for the people he represented a right
to come into the Federation at any time with the full rights of
an original State, proved futile. It is interesting to observe
that a duplicate signed copy of the Constitution, together with
the pen, ink-stand and table used by the Queen on the occasion,
now occupy a place in the Federal Parliament buildings.</p>
<p>The colony of Western Australia had as yet remained outside
the pale 01 those who had accepted the Constitution, but on the
last day of July its inhabitants decided by a vote of 44,800 to
19,691 that it would be to their advantage to enter as an
original State. A Royal proclamation was thereupon issued,
declaring that the six colonies should be united on the first day
of the new century (1st January, 1901). The inauguration of the
Commonwealth was celebrated in the Centennial Park, Sydney, the
Earl of Hopetoun, the first Governor-General, being sworn into
his new office on the occasion; and in the following May, the
Duke of York, our present Gracious King George V., opened the
first session of the Federal Parliament in Melbourne.</p>

<h3>Chapter VIII.<br>
<br>
THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION.</h3>
<p>The "Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act" specifies in
detail the powers and functions of the Executive, the Parliament
and the Judiciary of the Federation. It also deals with the
division of powers between the Commonwealth and States, and makes
provision for the admittance of new States and for the alteration
of the Constitution. It devotes one chapter to finance and trade,
and another to miscellaneous matters. In order to facilitate
comparison between the various federal systems, it is proposed to
discuss the Constitution under six headings, and to employ the
same divisions as far as is practicable in subsequent chapters
when discussing the federal constitutions of other countries. The
six headings are:&mdash;<br>
<br>
    (1) The Executive.<br>
    (2) The Legislature.<br>
    (3) The Division of Powers.<br>
    (4) The Judiciary.<br>
    (5) Provision for Constitutional Amendment.<br>
    (6) Relation to the Empire. **</p>
<p class="foot">[** This heading, of course, applies only to
dependencies of the British Crown.]</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a>
<h3>THE EXECUTIVE.</h3>
<p>The Federal Executive power in Australia is vested in the
Sovereign of Great Britain, and is exercised by his
representative, the Governor-General of Australia. His Excellency
is also Commander-in-chief of the naval and military forces of
the Commonwealth. He is paid a salary of ten thousand pounds, an
amount which Parliament cannot alter during the continuance in
office of any individual Governor. It is his function (1) to act
as the representative of the Home Government, and, therefore, to
safeguard Imperial interests, and (2) to act as the head of the
Federal legislative and administrative systems. He is empowered,
like any constitutional head, to summon, prorogue or dissolve
Parliament, though by a special enactment of the Constitution he
must not allow twelve months to intervene between any two
sessions. This has become a permanent feature of all British
Constitutions since the English Revolution of 1688. The
Governor-General exercises his own discretion to a limited
extent, and under special circumstances only. He may assent to,
withhold his assent from, or reserve for the Sovereign's
pleasure, any Bill that has passed through the two Houses of
Parliament. It is improbable, however, that he would exercise his
power of veto unless he were convinced that a proposed measure
was opposed to Imperial interests. He may also suggest amendments
for the Parliament's consideration. Imperial interests are
further safeguarded by the King's power to disallow any law
assented to by the Governor-General provided the Royal veto is
expressed within one year of the Vice-regal assent. "This method
of conserving Imperial interests is more satisfactory and more in
harmony with the larger measure of self-government granted by the
Constitution than the old system of instructing the Governor not
to assent to certain classes of Bills, many of which were quite
within the competence of the Colonial Legislatures and related to
matters of purely local interests." * The Royal veto would not be
exercised in matters of entirely Australian concern, as it is one
of the fundamental features of British colonial policy that the
colonies should be self-governing and free from interference,
except when their legislation involves Imperial and international
relations.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Quick and Garran, "Annotated Constitution of
the Australian Commonwealth", p. 963.]</p>
<p>The Governor-General is also at liberty to exercise his
discretion at times of political crisis, when he may either
select new advisers, or dissolve Parliament and thus allow the
electors to decide the issues. But under all other circumstances
he is expected to act with the advice of the Federal Executive
Council, consisting of the Ministers of the Crown. According to
one of the fictions of "responsible government", the members of
the Executive are appointed by the Governor-General. In reality
they are indirectly chosen by the popularly elected House, in
that the Governor-General accepts as his chief adviser or Prime
Minister only such a one as enjoys the goodwill or confidence of
a majority of the members in that House, and commissions him to
form a Ministry. This he does by selecting certain other
individuals in his party to be his colleagues, though, in the
case of the Labour Ministry, the colleagues are selected at a
caucus meeting of the party in power, and office is then allotted
to them by the leader himself. This executive continues in office
until it has lost the confidence of the Lower House. Want of
confidence may be expressed in several ways, but chiefly through
the defeat of some Government measure or by means of a vote of
censure. It is immaterial whether the vote of censure is directed
against the Cabinet as a whole or against any single member of
it. For in the British Cabinet system, as has already been
stated, ** collective responsibility prevails, and the whole
Cabinet usually stands or falls by the political actions of its
individual members. The Executive's dependence on Parliament is
further secured by its control over the public funds, and by the
clauses which require Parliamentary sanction before the number in
the Executive can be increased beyond seven, or the remuneration
to the Ministers can exceed &pound;12,000. A noteworthy feature
in the Federal Constitution is the clause, to which attention has
already been drawn, requiring every Minister of the Crown to be a
member of either the Senate or the House of Representatives. Such
a course is the rule in all British dependencies where
responsible government obtains, but it is a rule generally
implied rather than explicitly stated.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Vide supra</i>. Chapter III., pp.
65-6.]</p>
<p>The Federal Executive is charged with the administration of
the Federal departments and Federal law. Consequently, our
Federation is a truer and more logical federal system than that
of Germany or Switzerland, where federal legislation is
administered by State or Cantonal Governments. The present
Australian Executive consists of the Treasurer, the
Attorney-General, the Ministers of External Affairs, Home
Affairs, Defence, Trade and Commerce, the Postmaster-General, the
Vice-President of the Executive Council, and perhaps an honorary
Minister or two. The Prime Minister may personally administer any
one of these departments, and in the present Ministry has charge
of the Treasury.</p>
<p>The corporate policy and joint responsibility of the Cabinet,
together with the dependence of the Executive on Parliamentary
goodwill for its continuance in office, render the Federal system
of Australia a complete contrast to that of the United States. In
the latter country, there is a practically independent one-man
Executive, the President, assisted by a number of Secretaries of
Departments honoured with the title, but scarcely with the power,
of Ministers. "The Cabinet system, and the mutual dependence of
Executive and Legislature which it involves, is recognised in the
(Australian) Constitution, and constitutes a vital difference
from that completeness which marks the separation of the
functions in the American system." * This contrast will be more
clearly understood when the chapter dealing with the Ignited
States has been studied.</p>

<h3>THE LEGISLATURE.</h3>
<p>The Parliament of the Commonwealth consists of (a) the King of
Great Britain represented by the Governor-General; (b) a Senate,
and (c) a House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The Senate is the States' Council; in other words, the
distribution of Senators is based on the principle of "Equality
of States". Each State, irrespective of its population, elects
six members, the people of the State voting as one electorate.
Thus Tasmania, with its population of less than 200,000 has the
same numerical strength in the Senate as New South Wales,
although the latter has over eight times the population of
Tasmania. ** Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia and Western
Australia whose Senators represent less than 1,500,000
inhabitants, have in combination twice the voting strength of New
South Wales and Victoria with their 3,000,000 inhabitants. This
distribution seems on the surface to be grossly inequitable and
undemocratic. Yet, on the other hand, had the interests of the
smaller States not been thus safeguarded, nothing would have
induced them to join the federation. Moreover, as the House of
Representatives is elected on a population basis, the claims of
the majority of people are well safeguarded. It is to the credit
of the framers of the United States Constitution that they
invented this ingenious method of reconciling the claims of the
greater number of citizens with the interests of the greater
number of States. The two systems of representation in
combination&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, that employed in electing
Senators, and that employed in electing
Representatives&mdash;guarantee that both a majority of the
people and a majority of the States will be in favour of proposed
measures before they can be accepted. There is no real danger,
therefore, to democracy in giving the States equal
representation, for, as Garran points out, "A majority in the
Senate may conceivably represent a minority of citizens; but such
a majority can never compel legislation&mdash;it can only prevent
legislation. And the legislation which it is likely to prevent is
precisely that which, in a federation, ought to be prevented;
legislation, that is to say, which is offensive to a majority of
the States. ... A combination which enabled a bare majority of
citizens to force new legislation upon an unwilling majority of
States" would never have been acceptable to the smaller States.
State interests are safeguarded in all modern federations. Even
in Germany and Canada, where the States are not equally
represented in Bundesrath and Senate respectively, the system
comes nearer to equality of representation than to representation
according to population.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>I.e.</i>, 1,650,000.]</p>
<p>Parliament may increase or diminish the number of Senators,
but must do so without disturbing the principle of equal
representation of the original States, and without reducing the
number for any of these original States. Senators are chosen for
a term of six years; they retire in rotation, one-half at the end
of one period of three years, and the other half three years
later. This scheme of rotation is an attempt to ensure a certain
amount of continuity of policy. The personnel of the Senate is
not subject to such complete and sudden change as is the case
with the House of Representatives. It was hoped that a check
would thus be provided against sudden radical changes without
unduly delaying legislation upon which the people were intent. It
was also thought to be a safeguard against passing whims, and it
was expected that the system of rotation applied to the Senate
would prevent that Chamber from being in its views a mere
duplicate or reflex of the House of Representatives. But Senators
are elected by the same voters, only differently grouped, as the
Representatives themselves. It is questionable, therefore,
whether the intended check would be sufficiently powerful to be
effective. For this reason one critic has declared that "Whatever
the merits of an Australian Senate in other ways, from the
circumstances of its origin, it can hardly be expected to fulfil
the ordinary purposes of a second chamber." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Egerton. "Federations and Unions in the
British Empire", p. 193.]</p>
<p>The democratic method of electing Senators affords an
interesting point of contrast with the systems in operation in
other federations. In the United States, Senators are elected for
a period of six years by the various State Legislatures; in
Canada they are appointed for life by the Governor-General; in
Germany members of the Upper House (the Bundesrath), are
delegates appointed by and acting under the instructions of the
rulers of the various States; and even in democratic Switzerland
some of the members of the States' Council are elected by State
Legislatures. To be precisely logical, a State should elect its
Senators in the way best suited to itself, as they are State and
not National representatives. But, as the State is sufficiently
identified with all the electors in that State voting as one
electorate, the logic of the situation is immaterial. It is
evidence of considerable weight that Australia is in the vanguard
of democracy when it is remembered, in addition, that the
qualifications for membership in the Senate are practically as
wide as adult suffrage itself. Three years' residence within the
Commonwealth is the only added condition. On the other hand, the
Australian system of electing States' representatives is
defective in at least one respect. Public opinion is not
necessarily correctly represented in the views of the Senate. For
it is possible that without some system of preferential voting
the six Senators chosen to represent a State may belong to one
political party, whilst the electors themselves may be fairly
evenly divided between two opposed parties, one party having just
sufficient preponderance of supporters to secure the return of
all its candidates.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives is the popular chamber in a sense
in which the Senate cannot be; for its members are elected on a
population basis, the numbers allotted to the several States
being proportional to their respective populations.</p>
<p>In order to determine the number of representatives to which
each State is entitled, the quota (<i>i.e.</i>, the number of
people each member should represent) must be first ascertained.
To obtain this, the total population of the
Commonwealth&mdash;which for electoral purposes is calculated
every five years **&mdash;is divided by twice the number of
Senators. This quota is then divided into the population of the
separate States, and the resultant quotients indicate the number
of representatives for each State. Whenever the remainder is
greater than one-half of the quota, the State concerned receives
an additional representative. The number of members in the House
of Representatives is approximately twice the number of Senators,
but the clause fixing the minimum representation for each State
at five disturbs the exactness of this ratio. The details of this
scheme of representation will be more fully grasped by a study of
the following tabulated illustration:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Vide</i> Representation Act, 1905. The day
on which the population is calculated is called by this Act
"Enumeration Day". Before 1905 the representation was based on
the latest statistics of the Commonwealth.]</p>

<p>It will be observed that according to the mathematical
calculation. Western Australia should have but four and Tasmania
but three members, which would then give a total of seventy-two
for the Commonwealth. Rut these two States receive the minimum
representation of five members each, and consequently the number
of representatives is in the aggregate seventy-five. The
membership of the popular Chamber was deliberately made double
that of the Senate so as to assure its overwhelming predominance
in the event of a joint sitting. *</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Vide infra</i>, pp. 170-1.]</p>
<p>The extent of representation for new States admitted into the
Federation is left to the discretion of the Federal Parliament,
which has also the power to grant to territories administered by
it whatever representation it thinks fit. A new State can be
carved out of an old State, or States can be united, only with
the consent of the State Parliaments concerned. Before State
boundaries can be changed, both State Parliaments and State
electors must signify their approval.</p>
<p>Representatives are elected for a period of three years,
though the House is subject to dissolution before the expiration
of that period. Any person over the age of twenty-one, if a
natural born subject, or naturalised for at least five years, who
has resided for three years within the Commonwealth, and is a
properly qualified elector, is constitutionally qualified to be
elected to either House. But he must not be a subject of a
foreign Power, attainted of treason, or under sentence of
imprisonment for more than one year, or a bankrupt. Neither must
he hold an office of profit under the Crown (other than a
Ministerial office) nor have any pecuniary interest in the
undertakings of the Public Service, except under special
conditions. Pensioned soldiers or sailors also are debarred.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives is the dominant House of the
Federal Parliament. In the first place, whilst the powers of the
two are co-ordinate in most matters, the popular Chamber has the
sole right to introduce Bills appropriating revenue or imposing
taxation. The Senate may not even amend such Bills. It must
either accept or reject them in toto, though it has the right to
suggest omissions or amendments for the consideration of the
other House. On the other hand, the Senate's right to amend other
Bills is fully protected by the disallowance of what is termed
"tacking", that is, including other matters in Bills dealing with
revenue or expenditure.</p>
<p>The passage of a bill through the two Houses indicates that
the measure is favoured, not only by the representatives of a
majority of the people, but also by a majority of States. In the
event of a deadlock between the two Houses, the double numerical
strength of the House of Representatives over that of the Senate
** ensures that in the event of a joint sitting the will of the
former, if at all unanimous, will prevail. Should the
Representatives pass a Bill twice, and the Senate fail to pass
it, or insert in it amendments distasteful to the other Chamber,
the Governor-General may dissolve both Houses (provided that a
general election is not due within six months), and require the
people to elect two new Houses. If the two Chambers continue to
differ about the same proposed legislation, a joint sitting is
held. If the proposed law, with or without any of the disputed
amendments, is accepted by an absolute majority of the total
number of the members of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, the law is regarded as duly passed by the two
Houses. As the total voting strength of the two Houses is one
hundred and eleven, of which seventy-five are Representatives, it
requires but a respectable majority of the National House and a
respectable minority of the Senators to be united in their views
in order to win the day. It is then presented to the
Governor-General for his assent.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The maintenance of this ratio of two to one
is also a protection to the Senate, in that it doesn't permit the
number of Representatives to be so increased as to add to the
dignity of the National House, and lead to the impotence of the
Senate.]</p>
<p>This provision for the treatment of deadlocks is quite a novel
piece of legislation. No other federation requires the
dissolution of the Upper House when it is in disagreement with
the Lower House. The nearest approach to it is the provision in
the Swiss Constitution, by which the whole Parliament is
dissolved when the people by a referendum declare in favour of
constitutional amendment which Parliament itself does not
favour.</p>

<h3>Chapter IX.<br>
<br>
THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION&mdash;(Continued.)</h3>
<a name="ch-23" id="ch-23"></a>
<h3>THE DIVISION OF POWERS.</h3>
<p>The Australian Constitution resembles more nearly that of the
United States than that of Canada in one very important respect.
State rights are jealously guarded. The Federal Government,
instead of being invested with the control of all unspecified
matters, as is the case in Canada, is limited in its operations
to the matters actually enumerated in the Constitution, whilst
the residue is controlled by the States. All the possible
subjects of legislation can be grouped into three
classes:&mdash;</p>
<p class="negindent">(1) The subjects&mdash;few in
number&mdash;in which the Commonwealth has exclusive powers of
legislation. In these cases the State laws ceased to operate at
the inauguration of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p class="negindent">(2) The subjects in which the States and the
Commonwealth's powers of legislation are concurrent. On these
questions the State laws hold good only so far as they are not
invalidated by Federal laws.</p>
<p class="negindent">(3) The subjects on which the Commonwealth
has no power to legislate. Naturally these are the subjects in
which the States exercise sovereign powers.</p>
<p>The Federal Parliament has power to make laws with respect to
foreign and interstate trade and commerce (but not intra-State
trade), customs and excise, bounties on exports and goods
produced within the Commonwealth, borrowing on the public credit
of the Commonwealth, postal, telegraphic and telephonic services,
naval and military defence, lighthouses and kindred concerns,
meteorological and astronomical observations, quarantine,
fisheries beyond the territorial limits, census and statistics,
banking and insurance, weights and measures, exchange and
promissory notes, bankruptcy, copyrights, naturalization,
marriage and divorce, foreign corporations, invalid and old age
pensions, civil and criminal processes, immigration and
emigration, external affairs, the Pacific Islands, railways for
military and naval defence, railway construction within a State
with the State's consent, and conciliation and arbitration in
disputes extending beyond the limits of one State. The customs
and excise department was taken over by the Central Government
immediately on the inauguration of the Commonwealth, whilst the
postal department, lighthouses and lightships, beacons and buoys,
the administrations of defence and quarantine were subsequently
transferred when the Federal Parliament was prepared to accept
them. The transfer of the officers and property was effected with
the maintenance of the accrued rights of the former in the matter
of pension, and compensation to the States for the latter.</p>
<p>With the one limitation that States may levy such charges on
imports and exports as will recoup them for executing State
inspection laws, customs and excise are exclusively Federal
concerns. Two conditions, however, must be observed&mdash;one by
the States, the other by the Commonwealth:&mdash;(l) Absolute
free-trade between the various States must prevail, though
Western Australian interests were protected by a special clause
which allowed them to continue for five years the imposition of
duties on goods from other States. These duties were diminished
year by year until they readied vanishing point. (2) Federal
duties must be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. As regards
bounties, the States still retain the right to grant aids or
bounties on mining for any metal, and also, with the Federal
Parliament's assent, to grant bounties on the production or
export of goods.</p>
<p>The States exercise all powers not enumerated in the list of
federal powers. They still control lands and public works, trade
and industries within their own boundaries, justice, the
railways, education and local government. The State Constitutions
and the powers of the State Parliaments, where not vested in the
Commonwealth Parliament, and as they existed previous to the
Federation, are guaranteed. The Governors are appointed directly
by the Home Government without reference to the Governor-General,
* and are entirely independent of Federal control. "In matters
not expressly transferred to the Commonwealth, Australia still
speaks with six voices instead of one." **</p>
<p class="foot">[* Contrast Canada.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Egerton, "Federations and Union in the
British Empire".]</p>
<p>But certain acts are specifically forbidden to the States.
They cannot, for instance, raise naval or military forces, or tax
Federal property unless the National Parliament consents, or coin
money. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, must exempt State
property from Federal taxation, guarantee religious freedom, and
refrain from establishing a national church. It further
undertakes to protect a State from invasion, and at the State's
request even from domestic violence. In return, the State prisons
are at the disposal of the Commonwealth for offenders against
Federal laws. At the time when the Commonwealth was in the
"process of making", there was some thought of handing over the
railways to the Central Parliament. They were, however, left to
the States, probably because railway construction is so closely
associated with the opening up of the land, which is essentially
a State matter, and also because they were a valuable source of
revenue and a good security for the State debts. Moreover, it is
only the long distance interstate lines that have even the
suggestion of Federal significance. Of course, the Federal
Parliament can carry railways through any territories
administered by it or in any State with the consent of that
State. The States may surrender any part of their territory to
the Commonwealth. Accordingly the Northern Territory of South
Australia was transferred to the Commonwealth Government on the
1st January, 1911. British New Guinea has been Federal Territory
since 1906. The Central Parliament is now intent on constructing
a transcontinental railway to connect Darwin with the southern
States and ports. It has also received the necessary
authorisation from South Australia and Western Australia, and
taken the preliminary steps in the construction of railway
connection between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie.</p>
<p>The financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the
States were most difficult of adjustment. Unless satisfactory to
every State, there was a fear that the whole Federal scheme would
be wrecked. The surrender of customs and excise administration to
the Commonwealth seemed inevitable, yet the States would thereby
be deprived of a large source of revenue. After several
suggestions had been discussed, a proposal&mdash;popularly known
as Braddon's blot *&mdash;was made by Sir Edward Braddon of
Tasmania, and eventually accepted by all the other States. It was
arranged that for a period of ten years and thereafter until
other provision had been made by Parliament, the Commonwealth
should expend but one-fourth of the customs and excise returns,
whilst the remaining three-quarters should be returned to the
various States in proportion to the amount received from each,
less the expenditure incurred in its collection. A re-arrangement
was effected in 1910, to hold good for another ten years, whereby
the Commonwealth now pays to each State twenty-five shillings per
annum for every person residing therein.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Vide</i> Chapter VII.]</p>
<p>The Constitution provides for the surrender The State Debts,
of State debts to the Commonwealth, but the latter must be
indemnified by the State. The interest payable must be deducted
from the amount that the Commonwealth has to pay over to the
States. It was thought at the time of the inauguration that, if
the Federation took over those liabilities, it would compensate
the States for the loss of some of the sources of revenue, such
as customs. Secondly, it seemed good economy, as it was
anticipated that the Federal Government, representing a larger
body politic, would be able to borrow on better terms than the
individual States. However, the transfer of the debts has not yet
been effected, though, as the result of a referendum in 1910, the
Commonwealth may take over from the States the debts incurred
since the inauguration of the Commonwealth, as well as those
existing prior to 1901.</p>
<p>In addition to the provisions already indicated, the Federal
Parliament must distribute its surplus revenue among the States,
and may grant financial assistance to any State. But in other
respects no preference must be shown to any State in the laws
concerning trade, commerce or revenue. Nor must such laws
interfere with the rights of a State or its residents to the
reasonable use of the rivers for conservation or irrigation.
Trade and commerce generally are to be placed under the control
of an Interstate Commission. In 1912 a measure was passed through
Parliament defining the powers of such Commission.</p>

<h3>THE JUDICIARY.</h3>
<p>Having dealt with the powers of the Legislature and Executive,
we now come to the Judiciary. As Chief Justice Marshall of the
United States points out, "The difference between the departments
undoubtedly is that the Legislature makes, the Executive
executes, and the judiciary construes, the laws." ** The judicial
power is exercised by a Federal Supreme Court, termed "the High
Court of Australia", and such other federal courts as the
Parliament may create or invest with Federal jurisdiction. The
only other court as yet established by Parliament is the
Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The High
Court consists of a Chief Justice (at present Sir Samuel
Griffith) and six Puisne Judges (Barton, Isaacs, Higgins, Duffy,
Powers and Rich). The judges are appointed by the
Governor-General on the advice of the Executive, and they are
rendered independent of political or external pressure in the
usual way, <i>i.e.</i> (1) by having a salary fixed and
undiminishable during their continuance in office, and (2) by
being irremovable from office except for proven misbehaviour or
incapacity, and then only on an address from the two Houses of
Parliament to the Governor-General. The salary of the Chief
Justice is &pound;3,500 per annum, and of each of the other
judges &pound;3,000.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Vide</i> W. Harrison Moore, "The
Commonwealth of Australia", p. 25.]</p>
<p>The High Court has both appellate and original jurisdiction.
Appellate jurisdiction is exercised when cases are brought before
it on appeal from other courts, either State or Federal. The High
Court hears appeals (1) against the decision of any of its own
Justices exercising original jurisdiction; (2) from other Federal
Courts, the Supreme Courts of the States and certain other State
Courts; (3) from the Interstate Commission (not yet established)
as to questions of law. In these cases, the decision of the High
Court is final, since no appeal is allowed to the King in Council
unless the High Court itself sanctions it, or "the King himself",
<i>i.e.</i>, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,
exercises the Royal prerogative to grant special leave of appeal.
In so far as appeals to the Federal High Court are allowed in
cases in which the citizens and law of a single State are
concerned, the logical application of the strictly federal idea
that matters of concern to one State only should be left to that
State is abandoned. But the allowance of such appeals carries
with it the compensating advantage of securing a more uniform
interpretation of the law throughout Australia.</p>
<p>Original jurisdiction is the treatment of cases brought
directly, and in the first instance to the High Court, and not
referred to it from some lower court. Original jurisdiction is
exercised by the High Court in all matters (1) arising under any
treaty; (2) affecting consuls or foreign representatives; (3) in
which the Commonwealth is suing or being sued; (4) between
States, residents of different States, or a State and a resident
of another State, or (5) in which an injunction is being sought
against a Federal officer. The extent of its original
jurisdiction can be further extended by Parliament, with, of
course, due regard for State rights. For instance, disputed
elections have been referred to the High Court since 1902. The
jury system is recognised in that all offences against Federal
law are tried before juries in the State in which the offence is
committed.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting and prominent function of the
High Court is to act as the "Guardian of the Constitution". In
order to guard against encroachment on State rights and functions
by the Federal Parliament, it is permissible for an individual or
a State to test the validity of a Federal law by an appeal to the
High Court. The Federal functions are similarly protected against
State encroachment. "Every law that comes before them, whether of
the Commonwealth or of a State, they must test by the Federal
Constitution and pronounce it valid or void according as it does
or does not come within the scope of the powers allotted to the
Legislature which enacted it." * When a State law conflicts with
the Federal Constitution, the former is invalid. But if a State
law conflicts with a Federal law, the former is not declared
invalid until it is first determined by the Court whether,
according to the Constitution, the Federal Parliament had power
to pass the law. If the Federal law is constitutional, the State
law is invalid to the extent of its conflict with the Federal law
in matters where concurrent powers are allowed, and altogether
invalid in matters over which the Federal Parliament has
exclusive powers. But if the Federal law is unconstitutional,
then the State law still holds good.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Garran, "The Coming Commonwealth", p.
153.]</p>
<p>By an amending Judiciary Act (1912) the Justices on the High
Court Bench were increased from five to seven, and at the same
time it was laid down that a Full Court consisting of less than
all the Justices cannot decide on a matter in which the
Constitutional powers of the Commonwealth are called in question
unless a majority of all the judges concur in the decision. In
cases of appeal from a High Court Judge or a State Supreme Court,
the decision appealed from holds good when there is an equal
division of opinion, but in other cases where the Court is
equally divided the opinion of the Chief Justice or Senior
Justice present is the deciding factor.<br></p>

<br>
<a name="ch-25" id="ch-25"></a>
<h3>CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.</h3>
<p>The Australian Constitution, like other federal constitutions,
is of the "rigid" type In other words, it cannot be amended by
the ordinary legislative process. As already indicated, this
precaution is intended to prevent the States becoming the prey of
the Commonwealth. When changes are desired, it is necessary to
secure the consent of the people in a majority of the States.
Amendments are thus effected by more democratic means than in the
United States. In the first place, a proposed law has to be
accepted by an absolute majority of each of the Federal chambers.
"In the important matter of the amendment of the Constitution the
power of initiation lies in the Parliament, and is not, as in the
United States, shared with the States' Governments, or, as in
Switzerland, with the people." ** Should, however, one House
propose an alteration twice within the same or consecutive
sessions, and the other House reject it or amend it in a way
unacceptable to the former, the effect is the same. In the second
place it is submitted to the electors&mdash;that is, a referendum
is taken. A referendum may be described as an appeal to the
people through the ballot box on some question other than the
election of representatives. It is a substitute for the "primary
assemblies" or assemblies of the whole people. "The orator is
replaced by the writer, the ecclesia by a few hundred
polling-booths; but the voice of the people cries 'Aye' or 'No'
as clearly as if they were gathered together in a market place or
Senate House." ***</p>
<p class="foot">[** W. Harrison Moore. "Commonwealth of
Australia", p. 32.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Garran, "The Coming Commonwealth", p.
135.]</p>
<p>The referendum is employed for the purpose of ratifying or
vetoing constitutional amendments, or for altering State
boundaries. The people's assent to ordinary legislative measures
is not sought. Two conditions have to be satisfied before the
people can be regarded as having signified their acceptance of
the amendment; (a) it must be assented to by a majority of the
total number of electors voting throughout the Commonwealth; (b)
it must also be accepted in a majority of States by a majority of
electors voting. The second condition safeguards, to some extent,
the interests of the individual States. **** When it is a
question of diminishing the representation of a State, it is
necessary to secure the approval of the people of the State
interested before the change can be effected. On this question we
have followed the example of the United States and again
safeguarded State interests.</p>
<p class="foot">[**** Vide Chapter X, p. 212 Footnote for
Examples of the Referenda.]</p>
<p>Once again the advanced democratic temper of the Australian
people is evident when we compare this method of amendment with
the methods in force in other countries. In the United States
proposed alterations are dealt with by the Legislatures or
Conventions without any direct reference to the people; in Canada
the British Parliament effects the amendment; in Germany it is
dealt with in the Federal Parliament. Switzerland alone, of all
the federations outside Australia, employs the referendum, and
its final stages in the "process of amending" are similar to the
Australian system. But in the allowance of the initiative and the
employment of the referendum for ordinary legislative measures,
that country is even more democratic than we are.</p>

<a name="ch-26" id="ch-26"></a>
<h3>RELATION TO THE EMPIRE.</h3>
<p>In conclusion, some reference to our connection with the
British Empire is necessary. Less than a century ago the colonies
were regarded rather as dependencies established for the
convenience and advantage of the Home Country, than as sister
States peopled by kinsmen entitled to full rights of citizenship
and freedom of trade. Oppression and short-sightedness resulted
in the loss of the United States, and, sixty years later, in
rebellion in Canada. But as a result of Lord Durham's report and
recommendations concerning Britain's colonial policy, the
Imperial Government revised its attitude towards the colonies,
and conceded the full rights of "responsible government" whenever
a colony was sufficiently developed to undertake the
responsibility. The Imperial connection was maintained, but so as
to give fullest freedom of government to the colonial powers.
Thus the reconciliation of <i>Imperium</i> and <i>Libertas</i>
(Imperial connection and colonial freedom), was effected. In
Australia the Imperial link is maintained by the appointment of
the Governor-General by the Home Government, and the grant to
him, as the royal representative, of the power of veto over
legislation. The King has also a direct power of veto, even
though the Governor-General has previously signified his assent.
The States, too, are directly linked to the Home Government by
having their State Governors appointed by the Imperial
authorities instead of by the Governor-General, as is the case in
Canada. In one other respect Australia enjoys greater freedom
than Canada, <i>i.e.</i>, the control of constitutional
amendments is in our own hands. The Home Parliament has but a
normal right, which it is unlikely ever to exercise, to make
paramount laws on all subjects or to amend the Constitution for
us. As already observed, the amending power in connection with
Canada's Constitution lies with the Imperial Parliament.
Moreover, appeals to the Privy Council from the High Court of
Australia are allowed in exceptional cases, though this right of
appeal is little more than nominal and may conceivably fall into
disuse. Great Britain still undertakes to protect us, * to
control for the whole Empire the question of peace or war, and to
arrange all foreign treaties (though in 1911 the views of the
colonial representatives on matters connected with the Empire's
foreign policy were for the first time heard). Moreover, "No
Colonial Legislature can annex territory or cede territory; such
powers can be exercised only by the Crown in its Imperial
capacity or by virtue of an express delegation of that power."

O'CONNOR</small></p>
<br>
<p>The Imperial Parliament also claims the power to make laws
binding on the whole Empire, and laws of Imperial scope have
always been accepted without question by the colonies. To such an
extent have the component parts of the British Empire advanced
beyond the old colonial policy, that the colonies, instead of
being regarded as subordinate dependencies, are now to be
consulted on all matters of Imperial concern, and the Imperial
Conferences at which the various colonies are represented have
become a permanent institution and a feature of increasing
significance in Imperial progress. Whether the scheme will
develop into some form or other of Imperial Federation is for the
future to decide. The twentieth century belongs not to nations
but to Empires, and it is to our interest to remain attached to
the greatest of all Empires. It is, therefore, well for us to
remember the momentous caution of Joseph Chamberlain, "We must
either draw closer together or we shall drift apart".</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.<br>
<br>
THE WORKING OF THE CONSTITUTION.</h3>
<p>It is not within the scope of the present work to give a
detailed account of the history of the early years of the
Commonwealth. But it may not be out of place to refer to a few
developments, with a view of showing how the Constitutional
machinery has been working. On the whole, there has probably been
less friction between the Commonwealth and the States than has
been the fortune of the other great federations. It was certainly
expected that the attempt to frame a Federal tariff would be
fraught with considerable difficulty and even danger, because of
the supposed inevitable clash between New South Wales freetrade
doctrines and Victoria's protectionist interests. The
freetraders, however, clearly recognised the necessity for a
tariff of some sort in order to produce a Federal revenue. They
also realised that, as three-fourths of the customs returns had
to be handed over to the States, the proceeds from that source
would have to be substantial. Their main purpose, therefore, was
to secure a revenue-producing tariff, and act merely as a check
to the extreme protectionists who naturally aimed at a protective
tariff'. The outcome of twenty-one months of deliberation was a
moderate tariff, calculated to give a return of about
&pound;8,000,000. Neither party was satisfied with the
compromise; the protectionists in particular could not content
themselves until the tariff walls had been raised still higher.
Consequently there was a revision of rates in 1907 and 1908 which
resulted in a substantial increase of the duties The return from
customs and excise in 1910-11 was &pound;13,000,000.</p>
<p>At the same time the principle of preference to the United
Kingdom was introduced, and goods produced or manufactured in the
Mother Country and shipped direct to the Common wealth were
admitted at duties ranging from two-and-a-half to ten per cent,
(but generally five per cent.) below those imposed on foreign
goods. In the case of goods partially manufactured in the United
Kingdom, the Act required that the final processes should be
undertaken therein, and the cost of British material and labour
should not fall below one-fourth of the value of the completed
goods. Two years previously (1906), goods from British South
Africa had received somewhat similar favourable treatment, a
reduction of twenty-five per cent, of the rates being allowed on
certain specified articles, including butter, cheese, grains,
hay, fodder, feathers, tobacco, agricultural machinery, preserved
meats, fish, and timber. * The following table of selected items
affords instances of the extent to which the United Kingdom has
been granted a preference since 1911, as well as of the increase
in the protective duties. An attempt to encourage the carrying
out of the final processes of manufacture in the Commonwealth
will also be evident from a study of the rates mentioned.</p>

<p>The Constitution Act placed (with certain restrictions) the
final selection of a site for the Federal Capital in the hands of
the Federal Parliament. But although the question was raised in
the first Speech to Parliament by the Earl of Hopetoun and
discussed from time to time, it was not till 1908 that the final
decision was arrived at. Ballots had been taken in the Federal
Parliament as early as 1903, but the two Chambers had failed to
agree. A compromise was arrived at in the following year which,
however, did not give general satisfaction. Consequently, in
1908, the question was re-opened, and eventually the district of
Yass-Canberra was agreed upon. Nine hundred square miles of
territory and an outlet at Jervis Bay were secured. On the 12th
March, 1913, the foundation ceremony was performed, and the
capital of Australia named Canberra.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the Braddon clause of the Constitution
compelled the Central Government to hand over to the States for
the first ten years three-quarters of the net revenue obtained
from customs and excise. Considerable anxiety was felt by the
State Governments and Parliaments as to what return the States
would get from this source after the expiration of the stated
period. The Commonwealth Parliament came forward with a
double-barrelled proposal on the lines laid down at a Premiers'
Conference to the effect that (1) each State should receive in
perpetuity a sum equivalent to twenty-five shillings per annum
for every inhabitant in the State, and (2) the Central Government
should be empowered to take over at any time the State debts, *
including the amounts incurred subsequent to the inauguration of
the Commonwealth. These proposals required the sanction of the
people, as they involved an amendment of the Constitution. The
two questions were therefore submitted to a referendum in 1910,
the result of which was to give power to the Federal Parliament
to take over the debts as suggested, but to refuse them the right
to fix for all time the allowance to the States at a per capita
rate of twenty-five shillings. ** To overcome the difficulty, the
Commonwealth Government arranged to pay this amount to the States
for the next ten years. The permanent settlement of a much vexed
question has, therefore, again been deferred.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Constitution allowed the Commonwealth to
take over only that portion of the debts incurred prior to the
establishment of Federation.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** This will be better understood from a study
of the actual results of the poll. The Tables will also serve to
make clear the conditions that have to be satisfied in order to
secure a constitutional amendment.]</p>

<p><small>An analysis of these figures shows us that neither of
the two conditions were satisfied in the poll on the first
question; there was neither a majority of the total number of
votes, nor a majority of the States in favour of the proposals.
The States as States were equally divided on the question. On the
other hand, the second table affords us an instance where both
conditions are satisfied as to a majority of States (five to
one), and a majority of voters were in favour of the alteration.
Consequently the Finance proposal was rejected, nut the State
Debts proposal was accepted.</small></p>
<p>The modification of the clause dealing with State debts is the
only amendment that has yet been effected in the Constitution
except for a slight alteration made to synchronise Senatorial
elections with those of the representatives in the other House.
More recently, however, attempts have been made to increase the
Federal powers in industrial matters, but though the two Bills
passed the Federal Houses they were rejected at the referendum in
1911. *</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Vide infra</i>, p. 225.]</p>
<p>Another very important matter placed under Federal control is
that of defence. When Sir John Forrest was sworn in as the first
Minister of Defence in 1901, the military forces of Australia
amounted to less than 29,000 men, and they were still further
reduced to slightly over 20,000 in 1905. The administration,
which had previously been in the hands of a General Commanding
Officer and his staff, was then transferred to a Council of
Defence to deal with questions of policy, and a Military Board to
supervise the administration. In 1911 the voluntary system came
to an end, and universal compulsory training, with certain
specified exemptions, became the order of the day. The system
finally adopted followed in its main features the recommendations
made by Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, who had visited Australia to
report on our defence system. By the Acts of the Deakin and
Fisher Ministries (1909-11) boys of twelve and thirteen years of
age undergo a course of drill and physical training (120 hours
per year) as junior cadets; for the next four years (14-18) they
become senior cadets, and undergo drill equivalent to sixteen
days annually&mdash;eight days being spent in camp for continuous
training. They are then passed on to the citizen forces (the
militia), where, between the ages of 18 and 25, they undergo a
similar amount of drill; and for the last two years (25-6) they
are required to attend one muster parade each year. A day's drill
was defined in 1911 as occupying not less than four hours, whilst
two hours represent a half-day, and one hour satisfies for a
night. All citizens between 18 and 60 are liable to be called
upon to serve in time of war, men without family ties of wife or
children being called into service in the first instance, and
married men later if necessary. At the beginning of 1913 the
Commonwealth forces numbered 34,000 militia and volunteers and
nearly 90,000 senior cadets. In 1920 it is estimated there will
be 128,000 militia and 100,000 senior cadets.</p>
<p>At the same time considerable change has been effected in the
Naval Defence System. The Commonwealth Government has engaged to
construct an Australian Fleet which will constitute a "unit" of
the Imperial Fleet. On the 1st January, 1913, the Imperial
Flagship, H.M.S. Drake, set out on her return voyage to England,
and one of the Commonwealth Fleet, H.M.A.S. Australia will take
her place as the flagship. The first really Australian squadron
is to consist of an armoured cruiser, three unarmoured cruisers,
six destroyers and three submarines, with docks and depot ships
to match; and is to be manned as far as possible by Australians.
The administration is in the hands of a Naval Board. The annual
upkeep is estimated at about &pound;750,000. Military and naval
colleges have also been established&mdash;the former at Duntroon,
and the latter temporarily at Geelong, though a site for the
permanent naval college has been chosen at Jervis Bay&mdash;and
these are to provide the higher training necessary for officers.
In January, 1913, the dock at Cockatoo Island (Sydney) was
formally handed over to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>Amongst other important matters that have received the
attention of the Commonwealth Parliament are the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The enforcement of a "A White Australia"
policy.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The granting of bounties to encourage
certain Australian industries.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The acceptance of the transference to the
Commonwealth of the administration of Papua and the Northern
Territory.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) The imposition of a land tax.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) The issue of Commonwealth Government notes
and the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank.</p>
<p class="indent">6) The establishment of a Federal Industrial
Court of Conciliation and Arbitration.</p>
<p class="indent">(7) The appointment of a High Commissioner to
reside in England, and the establishment of an Interstate
Commission.</p>
<p>(1) In respect to the first of these, the Commonwealth
Government has from the very outset been intent on preserving
Australia for the white races. The policy is based partly on
moral, and partly on economic grounds. In the first Vice-regal
speech to Parliament, reference was made to the necessity for
restricting the immigration of Asiatics, and abolishing South Sea
Islanders' labour. These matters the Parliament could control,
since the Constitution gave them power to legislate in reference
to immigration and emigration. Accordingly, the Immigration
Restriction Bill was introduced by the Prime Minister, Sir Edmund
Barton, in June, 1901, and eventually the law was passed by which
every immigrant should be liable to be called upon to write fifty
words in a European language. The Act was subsequently amended,
and at the present time the dictation test may be in any language
prescribed by Government regulation. As no such regulation has
yet been issued, the test stands as agreed to in 1901. Owners and
masters of vessels are now liable to a fine of &pound;100 if a
prohibited immigrant enters the Commonwealth from off their
vessels. The Act is not enforced against Europeans, or against
Asiatic visitors who do not intend to take up permanent residence
in Australia, nor is it applied whenever the Commonwealth enters
into an understanding with a foreign government for the admission
of its subjects into Australia. In keeping with this restriction
of undesirable immigrants, the Pacific Islands Labourers' Act was
passed in 1901 for the repatriation of the Kanakas who were
employed mainly in the sugar fields of Queensland. Pacific
Islanders could not enter the Commonwealth after March, 1904.
whilst those already in the country might, after 1906, be
deported by order of the Government. New Zealand natives (Maoris)
were exempt from the operations of the Act.</p>
<p>In 1912 a measure, having as its object an Australia healthy
and protected against criminal influx, passed the Federal
Parliament. This immigration Act prohibits the immigration of
persons who cannot obtain a prescribed certificate of health, or
are suffering from dangerous communicable diseases, or are
otherwise physically or mentally feeble or deficient. Any person
who has within the preceding five years been in prison serving a
sentence of one year or more for a criminal offence, is also
forbidden to land.</p>
<p>(2) The granting of bounties on the production or export of
goods is another matter of Federal concern, and the Parliament
has used its power in this direction to ensure still more a
"White Australia". A Bounties Act assisted the growers of sugar
who had dispensed with coloured labour by granting them a rebate
of excise duty. An excise duty equivalent to about sixty
shillings per ton on manufactured sugar was imposed in 1902, and
subsequently raised to eighty shillings (1907), but a rebate
which worked out at about forty shillings per ton (or sixty
shillings in 1910) was allowed on all sugar grown by white men.
This really means that a duty of twenty shillings per ton on
sugar manufactured by white labour was to be paid as against
eighty shillings on the production of the coloured labourer. In
1912 both the bounty and the excise on sugar were abolished. The
effect of the bounty is evident from an examination of the
following statistics:&mdash;</p>

<p>(3) The Constitution empowers the Federal Parliament to make
laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State
and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by
the Sovereign under the authority of, and accepted by the
Commonwealth. In accordance with this, Papua was taken over on
the 1st September, 1906. The communal rights of the natives were
respected. Lands are not to be alienated, but leaseholds at a
nominal rent are allowed. Similarly, upon the acquisition of the
Northern Territory on the 1st January, 1911, it was decreed that
no Crown lands should be sold or disposed of for any estate of
freehold, unless a contract had been entered into prior to the
transfer of the territory. The Central Government has taken over
the loans incurred by South Australia in respect to the
territory, and pays the interest thereon to South Australia. It
has purchased the existing railway, and pledged itself to
complete its construction so as to connect Darwin in the north
with Port Augusta in the south. The Governor-General can issue
ordinances having the force of law, and a Resident Administrator
has been appointed with full powers of internal management. He is
assisted by a Council of Advice of not more than six persons,
meeting monthly. A Supreme Court has been established, and the
South Australian laws, together with certain Commonwealth laws,
have been continued in force.</p>
<p>(4) For the first ten years of Australia's federated existence
it was assumed that the Federal revenue should come from the
returns of its departments and through the channel of indirect
taxation, the customs and excise. As a matter of fact, of the
fifteen and a half million pounds of revenue collected in
1909-10, all but about &pound;200,000&mdash;that is to say, over
&pound;15,300,000&mdash;was acquired from the customs, excise,
and postal departments alone. However, in November, 1910, a fresh
source of revenue was opened up by means of the Land Tax Act. The
object of this Act is to make it "unprofitable to hold big
estates;" in other words, it aims at bringing about closer
settlement. The owners of land worth less than &pound;5,000 (if
not absentees) are exempted from taxation; those owning land
worth between &pound;5,000 and &pound;10,000 are required to pay
an annual tax of about one penny in the pound on the unimproved
capital value; and the tax is so graduated, that those whose
landed property exceeds &pound;80,000 in value must pay as much
as sixpence on every pound in excess of that amount. An extra tax
equivalent to about one penny in the pound is imposed on absentee
owners. As the Act has been in operation for less than three
years, it is not advisable to discuss its effects on the large
estates aimed at.</p>
<p>(5) The Constitution gives to the Federal Parliament the power
to make laws with respect to banking, other than State banking;
also State banking extending beyond the limits of the State
concerned, the incorporation of banks and the issue of paper
money, as well as currency, coinage, and legal tender. The
Parliament has availed itself of this power to pass the
Australian Notes Act (1910) authorising the issue of Australian
notes from ten shillings upwards in value, redeemable in gold at
the Treasury at the seat of Government. For the first
&pound;7,000,000 represented by notes there was to be a gold
reserve of at least twenty-five per cent, of that amount. Beyond
that, the Treasurer was required to hold pound for pound. But by
an amendment in 1911, the gold coin reserve must not be less than
one-quarter the amount represented by the Australian notes, and
this applies to any sum whether less or greater than
&pound;7,000,000. On the 17th March, 1912, the Commonwealth Notes
in circulation represented &pound;9,431,980, and against this the
Treasury held gold to the value of &pound;3,885,044. Another Act
followed which, by placing a ten per cent, tax on all notes
issued by private banks, in effect prohibited their issue.</p>
<p>The Australian Notes Act was regarded as the first step
towards the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank, and this
institution in due time appeared, transacting both ordinary and
savings bank business. It was officially opened in January, 1913,
and has already branches in nearly every business centre
throughout Australia. It is controlled by a Governor who is
assisted by a Deputy-Governor, both being appointed for seven
years.</p>
<p>(6) The Commonwealth Governments have also shown considerable
interest in industrial matters. In 1904 the Federal Conciliation
and Arbitration Act provided for the establishment of a Court of
Conciliation and Arbitration with one of the judges of the High
Court, appointed for seven years, as the President. The expressed
object of the Act was to prevent lockouts and strikes, to provide
for the States a court to which they could refer their industrial
disputes, and to encourage organisation of employers and
employees' associations. Owing to the demands made upon the time
of the President, a Judiciary Act of 1906 increased the number of
judges on the High Court Bench * from three to five, and it was
still further increased to seven in 1912. The Court of
Conciliation and Arbitration attends only to disputes extending
beyond the limits of one State. It can fix minimum rates of wages
and give preference to unionists.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The High Court itself was established by the
Judiciary Act of 1903, and was given, in addition to the powers
conferred in the first instance by the Constitution, original
jurisdiction in all matters arising under the Constitution or
involving its interpretation.]</p>
<p>A desire to protect the wages of workers led to the passage of
the Excise Tariff Act of 1906. The scheme outlined in this Act
was known as "New Protection". It imposed excise on the
manufacture of certain agricultural implements, and at the same
time exempted from payment those employers who gave "fair and
reasonable" remuneration to labour. Soon after its passage, a
successful appeal for higher wages was made by one set of
employees. But the High Court, when referred to, declared the Act
unconstitutional and invalid on the ground that it was not a
taxing Act, but one which, in effect would, interfere with the
internal trade of the States, which was a matter purely for State
administration. Consequently, an attempt was made in 1911 to
increase the powers of the Commonwealth with respect to (1) trade
and commerce within a State, as well as interstate and foreign;
(2) corporations; (3) labour and employment, including (a) the
wages and conditions of labour and employment in any trade,
industry or calling, and (b) the prevention and settlement of
industrial disputes, including disputes in the State railway
services; (4) combinations and monopolies in relation to the
production or supply of goods or services. Furthermore, the
Government sought to gain the power to make laws for carrying on
any industry or business by or under Government control, and for
acquiring just terms any property used in connection with the
industry whenever the Parliament declared it the subject of a
monopoly. The proposals were submitted to a referendum on 26th
April, 1911, but were rejected by both a majority of States and a
majority of the total number of electors voting. Western
Australia was the only State to approve of them. Somewhat similar
proposals were again submitted to the referendum in May, 1913,
and were again negatived.</p>

<blockquote>In August, 1913, the Federal Government decided the

appointed as Chairman, and Mr. George Swinburne, a member of the
Victorian Assembly, and Mr. N. C. Lockyer, I.S.O.,
Comptroller-General of Customs, as the other two Commissioners.
The functions of the Interstate Commission are outlined on pp.
225-6.</blockquote>
<p>(7) In the interests of the Commonwealth's commercial and
financial connection with the United Kingdom, a High Commissioner
Act was passed in 1909. The Act empowered the Governor-General to
appoint a High Commissioner for five years (subject to
re-appointment) to act as representative and resident agent of
the Commonwealth in the United Kingdom, and look after the
commercial, financial and general interests of both the
Commonwealth and the States. Sir George H. Reid received the
distinction of being Australia's first High Commissioner, and his
settlement and work in England have proved of considerable
benefit to the country he represents.</p>
<p>More recently (1912) Parliament passed an Act defining the
powers of the Interstate Commission. The Act provides for three
Commissioners (the chairman to receive &pound;2,500 per annum,
and each of the other two, &pound;2,000). The duties of the
Commission are to investigate matters affecting production and
trade, the encouragement of Australian industries, the opening up
of external trade, the effect of alterations in the tariff,
prices of commodities, wages, profits, labour and unemployment,
foreign bounties on Australian imports, immigration, questions
relating to the navigability of rivers, and the conservation of
river waters for irrigation purposes, and other matters referred
to it by Parliament. The Commission has powers to adjudicate on
disputes relating to inter-state or external commerce, to fix
maximum and minimum rates for services, and to enforce the
attendance of witnesses before it. The same Act forbids State
railway authorities to give any preference or discrimination
which may be considered as unreasonable or unjust to any State in
matters affecting interstate commerce.</p>

<h3>Chapter XI.<br>
<br>
ANCIENT AND MEDIAEVAL SYSTEMS.</h3>
<p>We have now examined the conditions for, and the leading
general characteristics of, federal systems; we have observed the
development of the federal movement in Australia, and discussed
the main features of her Constitution. It remains, as an aid to
the more complete understanding of this Constitution, to proceed
to an examination of other federations that have been established
both during and since ancient times. This we purpose to do,
touching lightly on the earliest systems, and somewhat more fully
on those established within the last century and a quarter, since
it was in the light of the experience of the latter that the
Australian system was framed. The reader will then be in a
position to note interesting resemblances and contrasts between
these systems and that of the Commonwealth. Nor should he fail to
observe how closely the general fundamental principles have been
adhered to in every case.</p>
<p>The most important federal or confederate systems in existence
at various times during the past 2,400 years are the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The leagues of ancient Greece, such as the
Delian, Achaean, and Aetolian. *<br>
(2) Various leagues in ancient Italy, especially the Latin
League.<br>
(3) The mediaeval German Empire, better known as the Holy Roman
Empire.<br>
(4) The Swiss League.<br>
(5) The Seven Provinces of the Netherlands.<br>
(6) The United States of America.<br>
(7) Switzerland since 1848 and 1874.<br>
(8) Canada.<br>
(9) Germany.<br>
10) Australia.<br>
The Union of South Africa also may be regarded as containing
features that approximate to those of a federation.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In addition to those mentioned above, federal
governments of a less developed character were in operation in
Thessaly. B&oelig;otia, Acarnania, Olynthus, Arcadia and Lycia,
<i>vide</i> "Greenidge's Handbook of Greek Constitutional
History", p. 222.]</p>
<p>An early attempt at a union of a more or less federal nature
was the so-called Confederacy of Delos, founded in 477 B.C., just
after the Greeks had emerged triumphant from their struggle
against the Persians. The league was formed for the purpose of
presenting a united front against any further aggression, and
liberating the Greek cities still under the foreign yoke. It
included the cities of Ionia and Aeolis on the western coasts of
Asia Minor, the cities of Chalcidice, the Hellespont, and the
Bosphorus, and almost every island in the Aegean Sea, together
with the city of Athens itself. A representative congress was to
meet annually at Delos, where the common treasury was kept, and
each State was to retain its independence and equality of status.
The Congress acted as a common court of justice, and exacted
obligations from the individual cities. Thus the deliberative and
judicial powers of the Confederacy were exercised by the cities
conjointly, though the chief executive authority was in the hands
of Athenians.</p>
<p>The great preponderance of Athens in the exercise of the
executive functions prevents the Delian Confederacy from being
considered amongst those of true federal type. The league was
shortlived, as, owing to the vastly superior power and prestige
of Athens, the Congress ceased to meet, and the treasury was
removed to Athens, while the islands and cities within the league
gradually lost their freedom and became dependencies of the
sovereign city. The Delian Confederacy was transformed into an
Athenian Empire.</p>
<p>About two centuries later, the nearest approach to a
successful federal union in ancient limes was made, when the
cities of Achaea formed a league (280 B.C.). This federation,
consisting originally of ten cities of Achaea, embraced
ultimately all the cities but three of the Peloponnesus outside
Sparta and Elis. The object of the city States in the league was
to release the Peloponnesus from Macedonian control and recover
their independence. The characteristic Greek primary assembly, or
meeting of all the free citizens over the age of thirty years,
was retained, but the federal magistrates selected by this body
practically governed the country. Just as in England, the moot or
meeting of all the citizens gradually gave place to
representative institutions, so, owing to the inconvenience of
assembling in one central city, the populace left the government
for the greater portion of the year to their representative
magistrates, of whom the chief was the Strategus (a commander in
both military and civil matters). The equality of the States was
maintained by the citizens voting in their assemblies by cities
and not as individuals. The matters to be presented to the
Assembly were selected and prepared beforehand by another body of
representatives known collectively as the Senate. Both the Senate
and the Executive Magistrates had to carry out the will of the
Assembly, and render an account of any acts performed without the
authorisation of the Assembly at its previous meeting. In short,
a system of responsible government, but differing in character
from that with which we are familiar, was in operation. The
league constituted a real federation, in that an actual division
of powers was arranged. A league court was also established, and
its members appointed by the Assembly, for the purpose of
settling internal disputes between the city-States. The local
State bodies retained control of matters of purely local
interest, whilst such matters as coinage, weights and measures,
as well as defence, were left to the central body. It was this
unusual circumstance that caused Polybius to write, "The whole
Peloponnesus differs from a single city only in the fact that its
inhabitants are not included within the same walls." After a
hundred and fifty years of good government, the league was broken
up in 146 B.C., when Achaea became a Roman province.</p>
<p>To the same period also belongs the Aetolian League. This was
a loose confederacy formed of the tribes of Central Greece in
which the supreme federal authority was vested in a Diet (the
Panaetolicum ) consisting of all free-born Aetolians. This body
attended to matters of war and peace, alliance, treaties and the
reception of ambassadors, and met annually at the central city,
Thermon. It elected annually the Strategus and officers, as well
as another body or committee (the Apocleti) which was invested
with supreme judicial authority, and attended to the details of
administration. In all probability the league ultimately embraced
in addition to Aetolia, the territories mastered by the
Aetolians&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Locris, Phocis, Boeotia, Messenia,
and portions of Thessaly, Epirus and Acarnania, * together with a
few cities of the Peloponnesus and a few of the Aegean
Islands.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Polybius referring to the towns over which
Aetolia exercised a protectorate, says: "These cities unwillingly
shared in the Aetolian confederacy." See Greenidge's "Handbook of
Greek Constitutional History", p. 233.]</p>
<p>In ancient Italy federations existed before the days of Rome's
greatness. The most important, perhaps, was the Latin League of
thirty cities or cantons, with Alba at first, and Rome later, as
the leader. The league suffered the same fate as the Delian
League, and became subject to the dominion of Rome.</p>
<p>In mediaeval times, again, cities came together either to
secure commercial privileges or for protection. The most striking
instance was the Hanseatic League, to which at one time the
merchants of nearly one hundred cities belonged. It was formed
purely for mercantile purposes, and in its most rosy days
monopolised almost the whole trade of northern Europe.
Politically, however, the cities in the League remained attached
to the Empire, and formed neither a federation nor a
confederation.</p>
<p>The Holy Roman Empire itself may be regarded as an example of
a Staatenbund or Confederation. Under Charlemagne the government
had become strongly centralised. But, owing to the privileges and
charters granted to various cities, ecclesiasts and turbulent
barons, a number of petty sovereignties subsequently developed
within the Empire. Eventually almost the only indications of any
confederate connection were the nominal acknowledgement of the
existence of a federal Diet representing the governments of the
various States, and the occasional election of a Roman Emperor
whose authority was infinitesimal. So weak indeed did the central
power become, that towns oftentimes formed little confederations
or leagues amongst themselves for protection against the violent
and oppressive princes and barons.</p>
<p>A very interesting instance of the formation of a federal
union is the "Everlasting League" formed in 1291 by the three
Swiss "Forest Cantons" of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden. Their
motive was to present a united opposition to the demands of the
feudal counts of Hapsburg, or to protect themselves against
disturbance within the Empire. The "Everlasting League" was so
called from the agreement between the three members that "These
regulations for the common welfare and safety, shall, with God's
help, endure for ever, and in evidence of this determination,
there has been prepared, at the wish of those hereinafore
mentioned, a document strengthened with the seals of the
communities and valleys herein-named." Between 1332 and 1353,
five other cantons, including Lucerne, Zurich and Berne, were
added. Ultimately (1513), it became a "League of the Thirteen
Places". A peculiar feature was that the new members were leagued
with the three original States, but not necessarily with one
another. The Federal Diet of this League had but consultative
powers and no real authority. It was merely "an assembly of
ambassadors with powers very strictly limited by their
instructions." There was no central executive. The interest in
this Confederation or Staatenbund lies in the fact that it formed
the basis of the more complete system of later Switzerland.</p>
<p>The Confederation of the "Seven United Provinces of the
Netherlands", formed in 1579, is, perhaps, the best instance of a
federal union in the early modern period. Originally possessions
of the Duke of Burgundy, these provinces, together with ten
others, had by reason of royal marriages passed into the hands of
the Spanish Monarchs. The persecution of Protestants, and the
establishment of the Inquisition, developed a spirit of
resistance in the Netherlands, and in 1579, at Utrecht, seven
provinces, of which Holland and Zealand were the chief, drew
together in a Confederation or Staatenbund, known as the Seven
United Provinces of the Netherlands. The union was to be
perpetual, but State rights were protected, it being agreed that
each province should "retain its particular privileges,
liberties, laudable and traditionary customs, and other laws",
and that the ancient constitutions of the cities and provinces
should be preserved. The questions of defence, war and peace,
foreign treaties, and currency were definitely set down as
matters to be controlled by the "generality" of the Union. A
federal revenue was also provided for. An Estates-General was
created, but at first had little power, for the lack of a federal
executive. This was subsequently remedied by the Estates-General
securing the power to elect a small council to exercise executive
authority. The votes in the Estates-General were counted
according to States, and not according to individuals. A simple
majority of State votes was sufficient on ordinary occasions to
carry a proposal, but unanimity was required on questions of
peace or war, the admission of new members, or the amendment of
the Constitution. Consequently the Constitution was of the most
"rigid" type. This was a decided drawback, and often rendered
legislation impossible. Two other defects are also noticeable.
(1) The Assembly consisted virtually of envoys of the Provinces
bound by their instructions, and not of representatives of the
people. Consequently, and as the voting was by States, (2)
provincial feeling or local patriotism remained tense, and
precluded the development of a strong national sense. The
provinces could not sink their differences or forget their
rivalries.</p>
<p>The earlier confederations or federations differ in several
important respects from more modern systems. In the first place,
representative government, where not entirely absent, was but
partially evolved, whilst the problem of reconciling the
conflicting interests of the larger and smaller cities or States
remained unsolved. But, by what we may call a fortunate accident
of evolution, the modern world has been offered the bicameral
system, so excellently adaptable to federal schemes. For, as
frequently pointed out, it allows a most effective and
satisfactory compromise between the conflicting principles of
proportional representation (<i>i.e.</i>, representation in
proportion to population) and equality of States in
representation. Secondly, the earlier federations had to do with
city-States or small territories; whereas to-day immense
territorial States combine, and form more immense nations,
continental in their dimensions. Thirdly, both in purpose and
machinery the systems of the ancient and mediaeval world were
simple. Modern systems are complicated, since provision has to be
made for uniformity in a greater number of matters, sovereign
powers for the central body, preservation of State and Federal
rights, and the direct dealing of the Federal Government with the
people as an entity more or less apart from State boundaries.</p>

<h3>Chapter XII.<br>
<br>
THE UNITED STATES.</h3>
<p>In the year 1775, thirteen British colonies in North America
revolted against the tyrannical colonial system of the mother
country, and in the following year declared themselves
independent. For the next five years the States remained leagued
together with but an apology for national government in the
"Continental Congress". This body, consisting of delegates sent
by the various State Legislatures, had no defined powers; it had
no jurisdiction and no constitutional means of securing a
revenue. It was utterly dependent on the charity of the States. A
slight advance was made when the thirteen States ratified the
"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union". This
Constitution was operative from 1781 to 1787. A few additional
powers were vested in a Congress, the delegates to which were
chosen annually, and voted by States. But even then the position
was unsatisfactory. No powers of taxation were vested in the
Congress, no legislation on questions of importance could be
effected without the consent of at least nine States, and no
amendment of the Constitution without absolute unanimity The
federal body had no direct dealings with the citizens, and no
direct control over them Consequently the first few years of the
Union seemed destined to be its last. Local patriotism or
provincialism asserted itself strongly in a determination to
maintain State sovereignty on all occasions and guard jealously
against any independent act on the part of the Congress. Each
State wished to reserve for itself the right to coin, levy taxes,
control tariffs, raise armies, and maintain authority that would
be better in the hands of a federal executive. An appeal to the
States for 6,000,000 dollars to meet the national debt provoked
the poor response of 1,000,000 dollars. The trend of events
seemed to be towards inevitable dissolution of the Confederation.
Washington complained that "the disinclination of the individual
States to yield competent powers to the Congress for the Federal
Government, their unreasonable jealousy of that body and of one
another, and the disposition which seems to pervade each of being
all wise and all powerful within itself, will, if there is not a
change in the system, be our downfall as a nation." In 1787 the
Philadelphia Convention met to revise the Articles of the
Confederation, but, exceeding its instructions, drafted an
entirely new Constitution, allowing for more complete federal
legislative, administrative and judicial powers, a federal
revenue, and direct dealing of the federal bodies with the
people. It further resolved that the acceptance of the revised
Constitution by nine States should bring the Union into
existence. The new Constitution was finally adopted in 1788, by
the requisite number of States; and in April of the following
year (1789), Washington was unanimously chosen President, with
John Adams as Vice-President.</p>
<p>The Constitution of the United States is especially
interesting as the first of the modern constitutions and the
basis of nearly all subsequent federal drafts. At the time it was
thought to be a copy of the British Constitution, with an elected
President substituted for an hereditary monarch. In accordance
with the resolution of the 1787 Convention that "A National
Government ought to be established, consisting of a supreme
Legislature, Executive and Judiciary", the Constitution allowed
for a President, two Houses of Legislature and a Supreme Court.
The first body was to make the laws, the second to administer
them, whilst the third ultimately tested their validity by the
touchstone of the Constitution.</p>
<p>We will now proceed to a closer inspection of the
Constitution.</p>
<br>
<h4>I.&mdash;THE EXECUTIVE.</h4>
<p>The Executive power is vested in the President, assisted by a
Vice-President. The former must be a native-born American, at
least thirty-five years of age, and must have resided within the
States for fourteen years. * He is elected for a term of four
years and may be re-elected. His position is equivalent neither
to that of a European monarch, nor to that of a Prime Minister,
and yet in some respects he resembles both. He has personal
powers far exceeding those of an English monarch, though he is
restricted by constitutional limitations. These limitations are
as follows:&mdash;(1) He can make treaties only with the
concurrence of a two-thirds majority of the Senate; (2) his
appointments of Ambassadors, Public Ministers, Consuls, Judges
and other public officials are subject to the advice and consent
of the Senate. With the exception of these limitations, and the
possible nullifying of his veto by special majorities in
Congress, the President's personal will prevails. He resembles a
Prime Minister in that he is the head of a Cabinet, but is unlike
him in that he is independent of Parliamentary control or
censure. Responsible government, as we understand it, is
non-existent in the United States. For though there is a Cabinet,
it is rendered cohesive neither by a joint or corporate policy,
nor by collective responsibility. The Ministers are so many
Secretaries selected by the President and dependent on him for
their continuance in office, whilst he is free to accept or
reject their advice as he pleases. He is not even bound by their
unanimity on any question. Moreover, this administrative body is
entirely separated from the Legislature by the clause in the
Constitution which states that "No person holding any office
under the United States shall be a member of either House during
his continuance in office." Even nullification of the President's
veto by the Congress is not regarded as an adverse vote or motion
of censure necessitating his resignation.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The last-mentioned condition was to ensure
that only one who was a citizen at the time of the outbreak of
the Revolution in 1775 should occupy the Presidential Chair. It
is now practically inoperative.]</p>
<p>The President is the Commander-in-Chief of the military and
naval forces, and, as such, has the power to control the
officers, and require their advice when he desires. He is also
empowered to reprieve or pardon in all cases except that of
impeachment. He convenes and adjourns the Congress, but cannot
dissolve either House, since the absence of Presidential or
Ministerial responsibility to the popular representatives in
Parliament does not necessitate an appeal to the country when
differences of view or policy arise. He can be removed from
office only after impeachment for, and conviction of, treason,
bribery, or some other high crime.</p>
<p>That the complete separation of the executive and legislative
bodies was intentional is still more evident on an examination of
the method of electing the President. Neither the House of
Representatives nor the Senate can directly influence the
election in the first instance. The President is chosen by
Electors specially selected for the purpose. Each State appoints
Electors in the manner laid down by the State Legislature. They
equal in number the total number of Representatives and Senators
representing the State in Congress. Care is taken that no Elector
is a Senator or Representative. The Electors of each State then
proceed to vote for President and Vice-President, one of the
citizens proposed by each Elector being a resident of another
State. The results are forwarded by each of these electoral
bodies to the President of the Senate, who counts the votes in
the presence of the assembled Senators and Representatives. The
candidate securing an absolute majority of votes polled is
declared elected; but should no candidate obtain such a majority,
the House of Representatives selects one from the three most
favoured candidates, each State having one vote. Two-thirds of
the States must be represented to constitute a quorum for the
occasion, and a majority of the total number of States is
essential for the return of any candidate.</p>
<p>If the House of Representatives fail to choose a President,
the Vice-President acts as President. The Vice-President is
elected similarly, except that the Senate is substituted for the
House of Representatives when the Electors' vote is indecisive,
and it selects from the two highest candidates on the list. This
indirect method of electing the President has not avoided the
disadvantages of party faction involved in a direct popular vote,
as the founders of the Constitution had intended.</p>
<br>
<h4>II.&mdash;THE LEGISLATURE.</h4>
<p>The Congress or Parliament consists of the Senate and the
House of Representatives. The latter body is composed of members
chosen biennially by the citizens properly qualified as State
electors. The representation is on a population basis, each State
having one representative for every 30,000 inhabitants, with a
minimum representation of one. This House is consequently
regarded as the <i>National House</i>. The Senate consists of two
Senators from each State. They are chosen by the State
Legislatures and hold office for six years, though it is so
arranged that one-third of the members retire every two years. No
State may, without its own consent, be deprived of equal
representation in the Senate. Hence it may be called the States'
House. As it takes six years to alter completely the
<i>personnel</i> of the Senate, some assurance is given of
reasonable continuity of policy, or at least some security
against radical changes. A Representative must be at least
twenty-five years of age, and have resided in the United States
for seven years, whilst a Senator's minimum age is thirty years,
and his length of citizenship nine. Both must be residents of the
State they represent.</p>
<p>The main virtue of these arrangements for representation is
the excellent adaptation of the bicameral system of the
Legislature to federal conditions. Whatever may be said of the
system in unified countries, it is indisputably an admirable
contrivance for federated States. For it provides a means of
reconciliation between two principles which invariably clash
whenever States contemplate federal union. The smaller States
insist on the equality of States, whilst the larger ones declare
in favour of the equality of citizens. The former principle
involves the equal representation of States in the federal
assemblies, whilst the latter requires representation in
proportion to population. The problem is, therefore, "to
reconcile the claims of the larger States to predominance with
the claims of the smaller States to equality." But with two
legislative chambers to fall back upon, neither principle need be
thrown overboard. In America, the Senate is the embodiment of the
principle of State equality, whilst the members of the House of
Representatives are chosen on a population basis. . . . "The
device by which they adapted this system to the federal
idea&mdash;making one representative of the States, the other of
the Nation&mdash;is one of the crowning triumphs of their work."
*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Garran, "The Coming Commonwealth", p. 60.]</p>
<p>It is now clear that a Federal Parliament is not an exact
reproduction of the British Parliament. They are alike in that
the two Chambers in each case act as a check on one another; but,
whereas in Great Britain it is a nobility checking a democracy,
under a federation it is State interests being safeguarded
against the interests of the largest cluster of citizens. The
only occasion on which such a safeguard might reasonably be
protested against would be when the internal policy or interests
of a State were being unduly disturbed by the Federal
Legislature.</p>
<p>Congress assembles at least once every year, and members of
both Houses are paid. As the principles of "Responsible
Government" are inoperative in the United States, the personnel
of the "National House" is changed at regular intervals of two
years, and is not subject to premature or unexpected alteration.
The powers of the two Chambers in respect to the initiation of
legislation are similar, except that revenue bills originate in
the House of Representatives. These bills, however, are subject
to amendment by the Senate. Moreover, the latter body, as a
natural consequence of certain special powers conferred on it, is
in reality the dominant House. The Ministers, for instance,
chosen by the President, must be approved of by the Senate, which
body has also the sole power of ratifying or rejecting treaties
made by the President with other Powers. In other words, certain
administrative rights have been vested in this legislative body.
On the other hand, a legislative right rests with the President
in that a bill ordinarily requires his approval and sanction in
order to become law. But, should he exercise his right of veto,
the Congress can nullify it by repassing the bill with a
two-thirds majority in each Chamber. The House of Representatives
has the sole right of impeachment, and the Senate the sole power
to try all such cases, though its powers of punishment are
restricted to removing the convicted person from office and
disqualifying him from any government office. The two Chambers
select their own officers, except that the Vice-President of the
United States is President of the Senate <i>ex officio</i>. No
provision has been made in the Constitution to overcome
deadlocks.</p>
<p>Ministers, as already pointed out, cannot sit in either
chamber. Consequently, there is no Ministerial leadership of
Congress to conduct legislation or be responsible for it.
Congress flounders through its business by distributing the
various questions demanding attention amongst a number of
Standing Committees. The effect is to destroy the unity of
legislation. One committee, for instance, is concerned with the
raising of revenue; another with the expenditure. As the two
committees do not have joint sittings, and the spending
authority&mdash;the Executive&mdash;is represented on neither,
the results do not always harmonise.</p>
<br>
<h4>III.&mdash;THE DIVISION OF POWERS.</h4>
<p>The Constitution of the United States provides for the
distribution of powers between the National and State bodies in
such a way that the federal powers are defined and limited,
whilst the individual States have jurisdiction over all matters
not specifically mentioned. The sovereignty of each is absolute
within its own sphere, though where they have concurrent powers
the State must give way to the Nation. Both deal directly with
the citizens, except that Senators are chosen by the State
Legislatures. It is this direct commission from the people, and
direct control over them by means of the federal courts, that
differentiates the Federation of 1788 from the Confederation of
1781, and prevents the later one from being a hopeless and
disastrous failure such as the earlier union was. But whilst it
is the larger body that impresses the imagination of the world,
it is the smaller bodies that control nearly all the minutiae of
the citizen's life. In the words of Garran, "the citizen has a
double allegiance&mdash;to his State and to the Nation. It is the
latter allegiance which appeals more strongly to his sentiment,
and which must prevail where the two conflict; it is the former
which comes closer to his everyday life." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Garran, "The Coming Commonwealth", p.
69.]</p>
<p>Amongst the matters controlled by the Federal Government are:
Customs and excise, the army and navy, foreign and interstate
commerce and trade with the Indians, the postal system, coinage,
copyrights, weights and measures. But its powers are specifically
limited in certain respects. The National Government cannot, for
instance, tax exports, or give commercial preference to the ports
of one State over those of another. It cannot grant titles of
nobility or pass a Bill of Attainder or <i>ex post facto</i>
laws, or suspend the right of Habeas Corpus in times of peace, or
expend unappropriated moneys. The States, too, are definitely
prohibited from making treaties or alliances with another State
or a foreign power, or coining money, or engaging in war except
when invaded, or granting titles of nobility or impairing the
obligation of contracts.</p>
<p>As regards finance, the Federation and the States are
absolutely unconnected. The federal revenue is derived chiefly
from customs, excise and postal revenues. There is practically no
direct taxation levied by Congress, for two reasons:&mdash;(1)
Only such capitation and direct taxes are constitutional as are
laid in proportion to the census, and this is difficult; (2 ) the
federal revenue has always exceeded federal requirements, thereby
rendering further sources of revenue unnecessary. The States
unfortunately are not in such a happy position, but there is no
constitutional arrangement by which a federal surplus can be
applied to adjust State deficiencies; and, though on one occasion
the Congress did hand over a large balance, it was purely a
voluntary act by which it relieved itself of an embarrassing
surplus.</p>
<br>
<h4>IV.&mdash;THE JUDICIARY.</h4>
<p>The division of powers between the Nation and the States
involves a device by which conflicts between these powers may be
decided. Such powers of decision rest with the Federal Supreme
Court. In England, a court obeys an Act of Parliament, and when
discrepancies arise between different Acts, it obeys the latest
one to the extent to which it invalidates previous Acts. But in
America, the Constitution is supreme, and the courts obey an Act
of Congress or a piece of State legislation only so far as the
latter is not inconsistent with the former and neither in
conflict with the Constitution. This document does not explicitly
state that the Federal Court is the "Guardian of the
Constitution", yet it gives to it judicial powers extending to
those cases amongst others to which the United States are a
party. This jurisdiction, together with the principle "that any
act done by an agent in excess of his authority is void." is
sufficient for the purpose. In interpreting the law, it does so
in the light of the Constitution, and if there is any antagonism,
the law is invalid to the extent of its conflict with the
Constitution. The Federal Court has jurisdiction in cases
affecting ambassadors, public ministers, and consuls, in cases of
admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and in controversies between
two States or in which the United States are a party. It
originally had control of cases between one State and the
citizens of another or of a foreign State, but by an amendment of
the Constitution, this right was withdrawn from the Federal
Court. Although its jurisdiction is both original and appellate,
it differs from the High Court of Australia or the Supreme Court
of Canada in that it is not a court of appeal in cases where the
citizens of one State only are affected. The judges are rendered
independent of political influence in the customary way,
<i>i.e.</i>, they continue to hold their office during good
behaviour, and the remuneration cannot be diminished during their
term of office.</p>
<br>
<h4>V.&mdash;AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION.</h4>
<p>The Constitution of the United States is emphatically "rigid".
Although provision is made for amendment, yet it is so difficult
to secure the necessary compliance with stated conditions, that
in 120 years the Constitution has been modified on three or four
occasions only. The first ten amendments are known as the Bill of
Rights, and, as they were added immediately after the
Constitution, they may be considered as part of the original
measure. These amendments safeguard the liberty of citizens. They
secure for them religious freedom, freedom of speech and of the
press, freedom to assemble and petition, freedom from having
soldiers forcibly quartered on them in time of peace, trial by
jury, etc. Of the remaining five amendments, three were accepted
in the years immediately following the Civil War, by which
slavery was abolished, and the franchise extended to all,
regardless of race or colour. The difficulty of amendment lies in
the degree of unanimity required. Amendments may be proposed by a
two-thirds majority of both Houses, or by a Convention called
together as the result of an application of the Legislatures of
two-thirds of the States. The proposed alterations must be
ratified by at least three-fourths of the States through their
Legislatures or Conventions. The proposals are not submitted
directly to the people. No amendment infringing the right of a
State to equal representation in the Senate can be passed without
the consent of the State concerned.</p>

<h3>Chapter XIII.<br>
<br>
THE DOMINION OF CANADA.</h3>
<p>Canada was originally a French colony, but as a result of the
Seven Years' War, its administration passed into English hands in
1760. For the first fourteen years it remained under military
rule; then in 1774 the Quebec Act was passed, by which the French
Canadians were allowed to retain their own civil law, Roman
Catholicism became the officially recognised religion of the
land, and the executive power was placed in the hands of a
Governor, assisted by a nominated Assembly. General satisfaction
with this Act accounted for Canadian loyalty during the American
War of Independence, as well as for the great stream of
immigration of the U.E. (United Empire) loyalists from the United
States. These new-comers settled down partly in Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick, * but principally in Ontario. Since they were of
British nationality, their advent disturbed the homogeneous
character of the people of Canada, and necessitated a further
constitutional change. This was effected by the Canada Act of
1791, by which Upper Canada (Ontario) and Lower Canada (Quebec)
were constituted separate colonies.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Nova Scotia had received a bicameral
legislature in 1758, Prince Edward Island in 1773, and New
Brunswick in 1784.]</p>
<p>Increased legislative powers were given to each through the
introduction of elective Assemblies. "England in this way
recognised that Canada contained two nations which could not as
yet amalgamate." ** The administrative powers remained still with
the nominated council; in other words, legislative powers without
responsible government had been granted by this Act. The friction
that arose between the popular assemblies and the
non-representative executives which the former could not in any
way control, together with racial antagonisms and land troubles,
resulted in the rebellions of 1837, and the despatch from England
of Lord Durham as High Commissioner to investigate the trouble.
Acting on his advice, the British Government took two important
steps: (1) the two Canadas were politically re-united by the
Re-union Act of 1840, and given a common Legislature; (2) the
colony was granted within the course of the next few years the
full measure of responsible government. The nominated executive
was transformed into an executive Ministry, dependent on the
Legislative Assembly, and thus arose "that form of complete
self-government under which the unity of the Empire is reconciled
with the practical independence of its daughter communities."

<p class="foot">[** Woodword, "Expansion of the British Empire",
p. 253.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Woodword, "Expansion of the British Empire",
p. 256.]</p>
<p>The recurrence of racial trouble between the settlers of Upper
and Lower Canada, together with the growth of other settlements,
showed clearly that the last word on constitutional arrangements
had not been spoken. Complete unification proved very unsuitable,
and in 1867 the Imperial Parliament, acting on the expressed
desire of the Canadians themselves, passed the British North
America Act. By this, Ontario and Quebec were first separated
into two distinct provinces, and then, together with New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia (which had received responsible
government in 1848), were re-united in federal bonds. "The
Federation of Canada was due . . . to the desire of the people
united in one of the component colonies to separate, or at any
rate to be less closely united." **** The remaining portions of
British North America (with the exception of Newfoundland, which
prefers to remain unattached) have since been admitted into the
Federation&mdash;Manitoba in 1870. British Columbia in 1871, and
Prince Edward Island in 1873; whilst five years later an Imperial
Order-in-Council annexed all British territory (Newfoundland
excepted) in North America to the Dominion. British Columbia was
persuaded to enter the federal union by the undertaking of the
Dominion Government "to secure the commencement, within two years
from the date of the union, of the construction of a railway ...
to connect the seaboard of British Columbia with the railway
system of Canada, and further to secure the completion of such
railway within ten years from the date of such union."</p>
<p class="foot">[**** Teece. A Comparison between the Federal
Constitution of Canada and Australia, p. 5.]</p>
<p>The Provinces under the Dominion at present are Ontario and
British Columbia, with Legislatures of a single chamber; Quebec,
Nova Scotia, with ordinary double-chambered Legislatures;
Manitoba, which had the usual two chambers until 1876, when it
abolished its Legislative Council; New Brunswick, with two
elective chambers until 1891, and Prince Edward Island similarly
constituted prior to 1893, since when both have contented
themselves with the Legislative Assembly. In 1905 two new
provinces&mdash;Saskatchewan and Alberta&mdash;were carved out of
the north-west territories, each with a Lieutenant-Governor and
single-chambered Legislature. The north-west territories are
governed by a Commissioner and a Council of four nominees of the
Governor-General, whilst the Yukon territory has, in addition to
its Commissioner, an Executive Council of ten members elected by
the people.</p>
<p>Proceeding to an examination of the nature of the Canadian
system, and adopting the divisions employed in the survey of the
Australian Constitution, we shall find that the 1867 Act provided
for an Executive, a Legislature, Division of Powers between the
Federal and Provincial Parliaments, and a Federal Judiciary.</p>
<br>
<h4>THE EXECUTIVE.</h4>
<p>The Federal Executive power is vested in the English
Sovereign, and is exercised by the Governor-General, who both
represents the Imperial authorities and plays the part of the
Constitutional Ruler of Canada. As Constitutional Ruler he has
the power to summon, prorogue, or dissolve Parliament; as both
Constitutional Ruler and Imperial Representative he assents to,
vetoes, or reserves for the royal consideration, the various
measures presented to him by the Dominion Parliament. He is
assisted by a Privy Council, which in theory consists of past and
present Ministers; but inasmuch as ex-Ministers' positions are
purely nominal, the only effective part of the Privy Council is
the existing Ministry. In pursuance of the principles of
responsible government the real Executive are the Ministers
themselves, whilst the Governor-General governs in accordance
with the advice they tender him. This advice in turn is
ultimately in accord with the wishes of the nation expressed in
Parliament, since the Ministry itself is merely a committee of
certain members of Parliament who hold office just so long as
they possess the confidence of the majority of members in the
Lower or popular House. The business of administration is divided
amongst departments, each with a Ministerial head, who, of course
relinquishes office along with his colleagues the moment changes
in the Parliament cause them to lose the support of the majority.
In other words, the British system of responsible government is
in full operation in Canada. Consequently, the probability of
conflict between the Executive and Legislative bodies, which is
so real in the United States where the two are practically
independent of one another, is removed by the dependence of the
Ministers on the good-will of Parliament.</p>
<p>The federal sentiment is sufficiently strong to demand
proportional representation of the provinces in the Privy Council
of the Dominion, although the Constitution itself does not
require it.</p>
<br>
<h4>THE LEGISLATURE.</h4>
<p>The Canadian Legislature consists of two Houses&mdash;the
Senate and the House of Commons. The latter may be called the
National House, because it represents the people directly. It
thus corresponds to the House of Representatives in Australia.
Each State in the Union is represented in this House in
proportion to its population. The number of representatives for
Quebec is fixed at sixty-five, and the number of members elected
from each of the other provinces bears the same ratio to that
number as its population bears to the population of Quebec. The
total number of members, therefore, varies slightly from time to
time. There will be a greater number of members when the other
provinces grow more rapidly than Quebec, but a smaller number
when Quebec advances more rapidly than they. In 1867 the
Commoners were 181 in number, of whom 65 came from Quebec. 82
from Ontario, 19 from Nova Scotia, and 15 from New Brunswick.
Since 1902 the strength of the House of Commons has been 221
members. Of these, Quebec is represented by 65, Ontario 86, Nova
Scotia 18. New Brunswick 13, Prince Edward's Island 4, Manitoba
10. Saskatchewan 10. Alberta 7, British Columbia 7, and the Yukon
territory 1. After 1916 the aggregate number will be raised to
231, but it is significant of the westward movement of the
population that the combined representation of the eastern
provinces (Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward
Island) will be reduced by 9, whilst that of the western
provinces (Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan)
will be increased by 19. * Members of the House of Commons are
elected for a term of five years, though, according to British
constitutional practice, the House is liable to dissolution at
any time.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The distribution of representatives in 1916
will be as follows:&mdash; Quebec, 65; Ontario. 82; Nova Scotia,
16; New Brunswick, 11; Manitoba, 15; British Columbia, 11; Prince
Edward Island. 3; Alberta. 12; Saskatchewan, 15; Yukon Territory.
1.]</p>
<p>The Senate is generally regarded as the States' House, as it
is supposed to safeguard the interests of the individual
Provinces. Now, the ideal "States' House" should represent the
various Provinces equally, and should be elected either by the
people themselves, or at any rate by the Legislature of the
Provinces. But it is because neither of these conditions is
satisfied that the Canadian Senate performs the function of a
States' House very imperfectly. In the first place, the members
are chosen neither by the people nor by the Provincial
Legislatures, but by the Governor-General. Moreover, they are
appointed for life; and, even assuming they were representative
of Provincial views at the time of their appointment, they may
cease at any moment to be in that happy position, when any
decided change of opinion takes place within the Province.
Secondly, the principle of State equality, as recognised in the
Senates of Australia and the United States, is not strictly
regarded in Canada. Whilst Ontario and Quebec are each
represented by 24 Senators, the three maritime Provinces have but
24 between them (Nova Scotia 10, New Brunswick 10, Prince Edward
Island 4). The Provinces that joined the Federation at a later
date received even less consideration. Manitoba, Alberta and
Saskatchewan have but 4 Senators each, British Columbia 3. The
departure from the principle of State equality was due to
Canada's horror of an assertion of "State rights"&mdash;a feeling
acquired as a result of the civil war in the United States.</p>
<p>The Senate is in still another respect on a less democratic
basis than is the case in Australia, in that a Canadian Senator
must have a property qualification of &pound;800. He must be at
least thirty years of age, and a resident in the province which
he represents. Absence for the whole of two consecutive sessions
entails the loss of his seat.</p>
<p>The relative powers of the two Houses are those common to most
constitutions of the British people. They have co-ordinate powers
as regards legislation, except that the Senate cannot originate
or amend money bills. This chamber seems to have even lost,
through disuse, the power of rejecting them. In the event of a
deadlock between the two Houses the Governor-General has the
power to increase the number of Senators by three or six. The
additional Senators will be appointed to represent Ontario,
Quebec and the maritime provinces in equal proportions. The
device for dealing with deadlocks will probably prove
ineffective, or, as Egerton describes it, a "Mother Partington's
mop". **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Mrs. Partington, according to an anecdote
related by Sydney Smith in 1831, tried to keep an unusually high
tide of the Atlantic out of her house with a mop.]</p>
<br>
<h4>THE DIVISION OF POWERS.</h4>
<p>In respect to the division of powers between the federal and
provincial bodies, Canada is much more unified than Australia,
and the provincial powers are less. This is due to the
arrangement by which matters to be controlled by the provinces
are definitely stated in the Constitution (the British North
America Act of 1867), whilst, in addition to certain specified
powers, the undefined residuum is placed under the control of the
Central Parliament. The Dominion regulates, amongst other
matters, trade and commerce&mdash;whether foreign, interstate or
intra-state&mdash;railways, canals, fisheries, criminal law,
banking, and even public works within a province if they are for
the general advantage of the nation. A province controls its own
taxation and revenue, its own lands, local works, education and
municipalities; it can also amend its own Constitution, except
that it has no power to interfere with the appointment or office
of the Lieutenant-Governor of the province. This official
receives his appointment from the Governor-General, and is, as a
matter of fact, in much the same relation to him as the latter is
in to the British Sovereign; that is, he is the representative of
the Governor-General, and is under instruction from the Dominion
Government. He can veto provincial bills, or reserve them for the
consideration of the Governor-General, who also may veto them at
any time within twelve months of their enactment. The provinces
are not in direct relation with the Crown, but only through the
Governor-General. This power of veto, together with the fact that
not only the Lieutenant-Governor, but also the Senators
representing the province, and the judges of the provincial
courts, are appointed by the Central Government and are in its
pay, makes the province in a sense a dependency of the Dominion.
It is only because the Governor-General exercises his powers with
discretion, and refrains from annulling bills, except when the
interests of the Dominion as a whole require it, that this
anti-federal dependence is not irksome to the provinces. Their
horror of the cry of "State Rights" made the Canadians quite
willing to entrust unusually large powers to the Federal
Government.</p>
<p>In the matter of finance, the provinces are restricted to
direct taxation as the method of raising revenue, whilst the
Dominion may tax in any way whatever so long as no province is
granted any preference over the others. In the past, however,
customs and excise, with the returns from the public departments,
have proved sufficient for the Dominion without resorting to
direct taxation. The Provinces have direct control of their own
revenue, though a portion of it consists, in accordance with the
British North America Act of 1907, of subsidies from the Federal
Government made up of certain fixed annual amounts varying from
&pound;20,000 to &pound;48,000 according to population, plus
additional <i>per capita</i> allowances of eighty cents for the
provincial population up to 2,500,000, and sixty cents for the
population in excess of that number.</p>
<br>
<h4>THE JUDICIARY.</h4>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada, like the corresponding bodies in
the United States and Australia, serves as the guardian of the
Constitution, and thus practically decides as to the
constitutionality of acts brought before it in the conduct of
cases. But it does not monopolise the role of guardian, since the
Governor-General, without reference to the Court, may disallow
provincial bills, if in his opinion they are unconstitutional.
The Canadian Supreme Court has greater powers than that of the
United States in that it can hear appeals from provincial courts
even though the law of one Province only is involved. By this
means greater uniformity in the interpretation of law throughout
the Dominion is secured. But the powers of the Court are limited
in two respects. (1) Its decisions are not necessarily final,
since appeals are permitted from it to the British Privy Council,
and (2) appeals can be made direct from a provincial court to the
Privy Council, without any cognisance of the Supreme Court.</p>
<br>
<h4>AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION AND RELATION TO THE
EMPIRE.</h4>
<p>The United States Constitution has been described as "rigid"
because it cannot be altered by the ordinary process of
legislation, but requires extraordinary sanctions before changes
can be made. The British Constitution, on the other hand, is
"flexible", because employment of the ordinary process is
sufficient to amend it. The Canadian Constitution may fairly be
said to stand between these two types, though if we allow of but
the two classes, it must be regarded as "rigid". The Dominion
Parliament cannot amend its own Constitution, neither can the
people of Canada. The power of amendment rests entirely with the
Imperial Parliament. By passing a bill through the two Houses in
the ordinary way it can modify the British North America Act as
it likes. But naturally the British Parliament will act only when
it is the Canadians' expressed wish that they should do so. The
one fact, however, that it is the British and not the Dominion
Parliament that makes the alteration, is sufficient ground for
regarding the Constitution as an instance of the "rigid"
type.</p>
<p>Thus the Canadian Federal system is different from the more
normal type of federation as it appears in the United States in
that, whilst the latter is an independent power, the former is a
dependency of the British Crown. A citizen of the Dominion is
under a threefold authority&mdash;the State, the Dominion, and
the Empire&mdash;and the last-named is supreme over the other
two. The Imperial authority is exercised (1) through the
sovereignty which the Imperial Parliament exercises over the
whole of the British Empire either (a) by passing legislation
directly affecting the colonies, or (b) by the power of amending
the colonial Constitution; (2) through the prerogative of the
Crown. This expresses itself in its control of international
relations, the question of peace and war, the control of military
and naval forces, the appointment of the Governor-General, and
its right of veto of colonial legislation&mdash;provided it is
exercised within a limited time&mdash;and the right to hear
appeals from provincial and federal courts.</p>

<br>
<br>
<a name="ch-33" id="ch-33"></a>
<h3>SWITZERLAND.</h3>
<p>The Swiss Confederation is, strictly speaking, misnamed. It
does not at all belong to the Confederate or Staatenbund type. It
is a thorough Bundesstaat or Federation, the Federal Government
having direct control over the citizens. The title
"Confederation" is probably a relic of the earlier Staatenbund
formed in the 14th century. Since that time several leagues have
been formed between the various Swiss cantons, though no real
central government existed before 1798. It was then that the
Helvetic Republic was established under French influence, with a
single National Government substituted for the cantonal
sovereignties, and the cantons reduced to the level of
departments. During the next half-century various forms of union
were tried. But in 1848, as the result of civil war, a loose
confederacy gave place to a strong federal state, a diet of
ambassadors being superseded by a Senate and National Council.
Considerable modifications in and since 1874 have still further
increased the powers of the Central Government, and introduced
interesting experiments in direct legislation by the people
themselves by means of the referendum, and, since 1891, of the
initiative. In fact, this direct rule of the people, as
distinguished from government by elected representatives, is the
distinctive characteristic of the Swiss Constitution. At present
there are 22 cantons, three of which are divided into
half-cantons, making thereby 25 distinct bodies politic. These
cantons have their own forms of provincial government, alike in
the one respect of being republican. Each canton has its
representative institutions, but in one only has this
representative Legislature the sole power of making laws. All the
others are far more advanced democratically than Australia. In
six cantons the representative Council is subordinate to the
Folkmoot or meeting of the entire body of citizens, and merely
exists for the purpose of arranging the business for the
citizens' consideration. These cantons are living instances of
"pure democracies", and in comparison our Australian system of
government is an "elective aristocracy", as Rousseau would have
called it. In the remaining cantons the representatives have
large but by no means complete legislative authority, since the
referendum is employed in all but one of them, being compulsory
in some cases and optional in others. The Federal Constitution is
very similar in many respects to the Constitution of these latter
cantons. Thus, with a liberal use of the referendum, and also of
the initiative (which will be described later) in some cantons,
and government by Folkmoots in others, the Swiss systems are the
most democratic in existence, though the history of the ancient
Greek and Teutonic peoples show that they are by no means
unprecedented.</p>
<br>
<h4>THE EXECUTIVE.</h4>
<p>Another peculiarity of the Swiss system of government is to be
found in their method of selecting the Executive. In some cantons
it is elected by the Legislature, in others directly by the
people. Once elected, the executive remains in office for a fixed
term. So also in the national system, the Federal Executive
(Bundesrat), consisting of a President and six others, is elected
for a period of three years, at a joint sitting of the two
chambers of the Federal assembly. In order to secure as wide a
representation as possible, no two Ministers can come from the
one canton. Generally the members of the Executive are re-elected
at the end of their term of office. It is extremely rare indeed
that such a one is rejected, even though his views be divergent
from those of a majority of the legislators.</p>
<p>The Swiss Executive differs from the Australian Executive in
that, in the former. Ministers must not be members of the Federal
Legislature (if members at the time of their elevation to the
Executive, they resign from the Legislature); whereas in
Australia it is one of the essential features that the Executive
should consist of members of Parliament, so as to secure the
dependence of the former on the latter. In Switzerland, once
selected, the Executive and Legislature are to a large extent
mutually independent. The Executive cannot dissolve the
Legislature, the Legislature cannot control the Executive. True,
the cleavage is less complete than in the United States.
Ministers have power to attend and speak in the Assembly and even
to introduce legislation, whilst, of course, the Legislature's
function of electing the Executive provides an additional link.
But the party system of government is unknown, and the Cabinet
may consist of men of divergent views. Switzerland teaches the
world that "The existence of political parties does not
necessitate the adoption of party-government." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Dicey. "The Law of the Constitution", p.
466.]</p>
<p>The President of the Executive has no power of veto over
legislation, as this right belongs to the people, nor can he or
any other individual control the views of the Executive, as its
policy is corporate.</p>
<br>
<h4>THE LEGISLATURE.</h4>
<p>The National Legislature or Federal Assembly, as it is called,
consists of two Houses, (1) the National Council or Nationalrat,
(2) the States' Council or St&auml;nderat. The National Council
is elected on a population basis, there being one representative
for every 20,000 voters or fraction over 10,000; but each canton
and half-canton must be represented by at least one member. The
Council is elected for a period of three years, and the members
are paid. The franchise has been made uniform by a federal law,
all males over 20 years of age being allowed to vote: but until
this law was passed, the various cantonal franchises obtained.
The present strength of the Nationalrat is 167 members.</p>
<p>The States' Council (St&auml;nderat) as the name suggests, is
constituted on the principle of equality of States. Each canton
is represented by two members, and each half-canton by one. This
gives a total of forty-four members. There is uniformity neither
in the method of selecting the representatives, nor in the
payment granted to them, nor in the terms for which they retain
their seats. Some members are elected directly by the people,
others by the Legislatures; the term of office varies from one to
three years. The explanation of this arrangement is that it
assures to the fullest extent the recognition of State rights in
the States' Council.</p>
<p>The powers of the two Councils are co-ordinate, and on
occasions they have joint sittings. The Federal Cabinet, Judges,
and Military Commander are elected by the two bodies sitting
together, which in the same way also exercise judicial functions
in certain cases, <i>e.g.</i>, when the Federal Executive is
concerned.</p>
<br>
<h4>THE PEOPLE.</h4>
<p>The people of Switzerland hold the power a veto over federal
legislation, and even, in a sense, the right to introduce new
legislation.</p>
<p>(a) When a piece of ordinary legislation is passed by the
Federal Assembly, the referendum is optional. But the people must
be consulted when eight cantons or 30,000 voters demand it,
provided the demand is made within 90 days after the bill is
passed. A simple majority of voters is sufficient to secure its
acceptance or rejection. The optional referendum has a decided
disadvantage, in that the country is subject to agitation in the
effort to secure a sufficiency of signatures for a
referendum.</p>
<p>(b) The referendum is compulsory for Constitutional
amendments. Before the amendment can be accepted there must be,
as in Australia (1) a majority of citizens, and (2) a majority of
cantons in favour of the amendment.</p>
<p>(c) The "Initiative" may be exercised by 50,000 citizens.
These citizens may compel the Assembly to consider any question,
and may even themselves draft a proposed law and submit it to the
whole people, without subjecting it to revision by the Assembly.
The latter body, however, can at the same time submit an
alternative proposal. The great weakness of, and argument
against, the initiative is that a proposed measure put before the
country by its means will probably be marred by serious defects,
because the opportunities for thorough discussion, dissection,
and consequent modification are altogether inadequate. "It is
obviously impossible to take it clause by clause through a
Committee of the whole people." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Garran, "The Coming Commonwealth", p.
139.]</p>
<br>
<h4>THE DIVISION OF POWERS.</h4>
<p>The object of the "Confederation" is to "secure independence
against foreign nations, to maintain peace and order within, to
protect liberty and the rights of the cantons, and to foster
their common welfare." In order to realise this purpose, the
unspecified powers are, as in Australia and the United States,
exercised by the various cantons. At the same time there is a
very lengthy and detailed list of matters reserved to the
National Government, and consequently Switzerland may be regarded
as more unified than Australia. Yet, as Garran points out, "the
wider scope of the Swiss Constitution is rather a matter of
legislation than of administration." As in Germany, the execution
of federal laws is carried out partially or entirely by cantonal
officials. For example, education is a matter for federal
superintendence, and yet is carried on by the cantons. This
peculiar feature affords one of the most striking contrasts
between Anglo-Saxon and European federations. The Confederation
has full control of foreign alliances and treaties, war and
peace, the army, postal and telegraphic matters, trade and
commerce, railways, bank note issue and the currency. It also
controls the customs, except that the Constitution requires
manufacturing and agricultural implements and the necessities of
life to be taxed as low, and luxuries as high, as possible. It
further regulates child labour in factories, hours of labour,
workmen's sickness and accident insurance, the sale of liquor,
the protection of public health and laws concerning gambling.
Finally, it undertakes to protect cantonal Constitutions,
provided (a) they are the result of popular ratification, (b)
they remain republican, and (c) they do not violate the Federal
Constitution. Compliance with, or violation of the Federal
Constitution is, however, decided by the Federal Assembly and not
by the Judiciary, as is the case in other modern Federations.</p>
<p>The financial agreement between the Central and Cantonal
Governments allows direct taxation to the cantons only&mdash;a
confederate idea such as we see in the American Confederation
prior to 1788. The national revenue is obtained from the customs,
post and telegraph returns, proceeds from the powder monopoly,
and federal property. It also receives one-half of the military
exemption tax, the cantons receiving the remainder. It may, if
necessary&mdash;though the necessity has not yet
arisen&mdash;require contributions from the cantons.</p>
<br>
<h4>THE JUDICIARY.</h4>
<p>The Federal Judiciary (Bundesgericht) of Switzerland offers a
decided contrast to the system in operation in Australia. Whilst
the Federal Court has both original and appellate jurisdiction in
either civil or criminal cases, vet it is inferior to the High
Court of Australia in two respects. In the first place, the
judges are not so independent or free from political influence as
in Australia, since they owe their position to election by the
Federal Assembly, and may stand for re-election. The
incorruptibility of the Swiss judge cannot therefore be due to
the absence of external pressure. Secondly, the Federal Court is
not the "Guardian of the Constitution", since the
constitutionality of a federal law is decided by the Federal
Assembly or by the people. The protection of cantonal rights,
therefore, is not guaranteed to the same extent as are State
rights in Australia, since it is the other party to the federal
bargain&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the Central Government&mdash;that has
the deciding voice on the validity of any law called into
question by a canton. The arrangement is altogether unfederal,
and therefore, from the federal point of view, is a serious
defect in the Swiss system.</p>
<br>
<h4>AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION.</h4>
<p>As has been already indicated, an amendment of the
Constitution is effected in much the same way as ordinary
legislation, with the additional requirement that the proposed
alteration must be approved of not only by a majority of voters,
but also by a majority of, cantons. If 50,000 citizens, contrary
to the opinion of the Federal Assembly, consider an alteration
desirable, a referendum is taken to decide between them. If the
question is decided in the affirmative, the two councils are
re-elected; this new Assembly revises the Constitution in the
direction desired, and the proposed alterations are again
submitted to the people. If accepted by them, the amendment is
effected. Since, however, the Federal Assembly is judge of the
validity of laws passed by itself, it seems possible to effect
constitutional changes through the ordinary legislative process.
In other words, the Constitution is theoretically of the "rigid"
type, but in reality may prove to be "flexible".</p>

<h3>THE GERMAN EMPIRE.</h3>
<p>Germany, as a federation, has some peculiar features of its
own to offer the student. It has considerably modified some of
the characteristics common to federal systems, but is
particularly interesting as an instance of the monarchical type
of federalism. Before the union could be consummated, certain
State prejudices and jealousies had to be overcome, and State
rulers had to be persuaded to forego a good deal of their
authority. Indirectly the present German Empire was the outcome
of the re-awakening of a national consciousness due to the
disastrous reverses inflicted on Austria and Prussia at
Austerlitz and Jena by Napoleon. From the middle ages onwards,
the "Holy Roman Empire", including most of the German States, was
nominally in existence and subject to the Archduke of Austria,
who was thus also Roman Emperor. But the Confederation was little
more than a myth, and ceased to exist after 1806. Through the
patriotic efforts of Stein, Hardenberg, and Scharnhorst, the
German people were emancipated from serfdom, and a national
spirit restored. Napoleon was overthrown. Rut owing largely to
the influence of Metternich, the ultra-conservative Austrian
Minister, the proposal for a firm union was defeated, and a loose
confederation, not of the States, but of "the sovereign, princes
and free towns of Germany" was established. The Diet was
consequently not on democratic lines at all, but consisted merely
of delegates appointed by the princes and rulers under whose
instructions they acted and voted. Moreover, owing to the
necessity for unanimity in the Diet and the absence of executive
authority, the union was practically a powerless Staatenbund or
League of States, and served merely as an instrument in
Metternich's hands to repress liberal and progressive movements
in Germany.</p>
<p>The Confederation lasted for almost exactly half a century,
though a serious attempt in 1848 to form a closer union was very
nearly successful, and broke clown only after the Prussian
monarch had declined the Imperial title. Economic influences,
however, were at work as a welding force, and thus prepared the
way for political union. A Zollverein or Customs Union was formed
in 1834, composed of 17 States representing over 23,000,000
people. The tariff walls between these States were knocked down
so that goods could pass freely from one to another, whilst a
uniform tariff was imposed on the frontier. Austria stood out of
this union, and Prussia therefore became the leader.</p>
<p>The next series of events culminating in the Austro-Prussian
war of 1866, resulted in the dissolution of the Confederation,
the expulsion of Austria from Germany, and the creation of the
North German Confederation composed of all the States north of
the river Main. A popular Assembly or Diet gave the people a
voice in the government, though the chief administrative power
was placed in the hands of the Bundesrath or Federal Council,
through which the will of the rulers of the constituent States
could make itself felt. The King of Prussia was made President of
the Federation, but not with sovereign powers. Provision was made
for the subsequent inclusion of the four southern States,
Bavaria. Wurtemberg, Baden and South Hesse. These States came
into line as a result of the Franco-German war of 1870-1. The
"North German Confederation" was thereupon transformed into the
German Empire, when William, King of Prussia, was crowned German
Emperor on the 1st January, 1871. The Staatenbund or League of
States had evolved into a Bundesstaat or Federal State.</p>
<p>The present German Empire consists of the four Kingdoms of
Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Wurtemberg, six grand-duchies, five
duchies, seven principalities and the three free cities of
Lubeck, Bremen and Hamburg. These twenty-five States differ
considerably from one another in area, population, and local
constitutions, as well as in their relation to the Empire. The
largest State is Prussia, with a population of 38,000,000, whilst
the smallest is Schaumburg-Lippe, whose population is less than
50,000.</p>
<br>
<h4>THE EXECUTIVE.</h4>
<p>The head of the State is the German Emperor (Deutscher
Kaiser). He appoints the Chancellor, summons and adjourns the
Parliament, is the Commander-in-Chief of the army, and the most
potent influence in foreign affairs. But as Imperial ruler his
powers are considerably limited.</p>
<p>The Chancellor is the chief and, in a sense, the sole
Minister. He receives his appointment from the Emperor, to whom
alone he is responsible, and may be chosen irrespective of the
strength of parties in the popular Assembly. He presides over the
Bundesrath, and in the name of the Emperor appoints the other
federal officers and heads of departments. The latter are not his
colleagues but subordinates. The British Cabinet system does not
obtain in Germany. The Kaiser and his Chancellor conceive
policies, the departmental heads carry them out, the Reichstag
acts as a more or less ineffective critic. The Executive is, on
the whole, independent of the legislative body, though within
more recent years the Imperial Chancellor has acknowledged his
obligation to recognise the will of the majority in the
Reichstag.</p>
<br>
<h4>THE LEGISLATURE.</h4>
<p>At the same time the Bundesrath or Federal Council has
important administrative and judicial functions, and, as the
chamber representing the princes and rulers of the several
States, has to be reckoned with in many important matters. It
bears in some respects a close resemblance to the Diet of the
earlier Confederation, since its members act under instructions
from the rulers of the State they represent. They do not vote as
individuals, but as States, all the delegates from any one State
voting the same way, and all votes counting irrespective of the
presence or absence of any delegate. The Bundesrath is based
neither on the principle of State equality nor on that of
proportional representation, but on a compromise between the two.
Prussia has but seventeen members out of a total of fifty-eight,
though its population comprises three-fifths of the total
population of the Empire. Yet it is by means of the Bundesrath
that Prussia maintains her predominant position, since but
fourteen votes are necessary to annul any attempt to interfere
with the Constitution, and she has seventeen. Bavaria has six
representatives, Saxony and Wurtemberg four each, and the rest
either three, two or one. In addition to its legislative
function, the Council has certain administrative rights. Its
consent is necessary to the declaration of offensive war, to the
dissolution of the Reichstag, and to certain Imperial
appointments. Every member, as a delegate of a State ruler, has
the peculiar right of appearing and speaking in the Reichstag in
order to represent his government's views. The Bundesrath itself
sits in secret.</p>
<p>The Reichstag, which corresponds to our House of
Representatives, is the popular House, and is elected on a
population basis. Thus in a house of about 400 members, Prussia
with a population of 40,000,000 is represented by 236, and
Bavaria with a population of less than 7,000,000 by 48, whilst
the eleven smallest States have but one member each. The House is
elected for five years by German citizens over 25 years of age,
though the German Emperor, with the consent of the Bundesrath,
may dissolve it earlier. The members of the Federal Council may
appear in the Reichstag and address the Assembly. The Chancellor
himself frequently avails himself of this opportunity to explain
the policy of the Executive, yet the Executive is in no way
responsible to the Reichstag. Since 1906, members of this House
have been paid. Bills may be introduced in either House, and the
Emperor has no power of veto. The popular House interferes but
little in matters of foreign policy.</p>
<br>
<h4>DIVISION OF POWERS.</h4>
<p>A prominent feature of the German Federation is the large
legislative authority of the Central body, and the almost equally
large administrative powders of the different States. Generally
speaking, but with the exceptions referred to below, both foreign
and internal trade (whether interstate or intra-state), coinage,
weights and measures, banking systems, railways, telegraph and
postal matters are regulated by the Imperial Parliament. This
body has the power also of making uniform the civil and criminal
law as well as the judicial procedure. But the States retain
considerable powers in the administration, even where the
Imperial law is recognised. For example, the army, the customs,
and the post office are federal concerns, yet the equipment,
drilling and routine administration of these departments are
controlled by State officials. The Federal Council can require
that these duties be carried out by the States. Again, most of
the laws are made by the Imperial Legislature; but the Judges who
are responsible for its observance receive their appointments
from the States, though uniformity of interpretation of the law
is safeguarded by the existence of a Federal Supreme Court to
which appeal is permitted. It is for these reasons that Bryce
declares, "It is a State centralised in what concerns its foreign
policy, its military and naval organisations, and the larger part
of its legislation, but not centralised as respects its officials
whether executive or judicial." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Bryce. "Holy Roman Empire", p. 483.]</p>
<p>Another noticeable feature in the German Constitution is the
absence of uniformity in regard to the number of powers retained
by the different States. When, for example, the southern States
entered the union in 1870, special concessions were made to them.
Bavaria and Wurtemberg were allowed to maintain their own special
postal systems, whilst the former of these two powers further
insisted on controlling her own army and railways. For these
reasons Bryce declares that "It is a peculiar federation, which
as respects the North German members is a strict one, conceding
to them few and unimportant State rights; but as regards the two
greatest, Bavaria and Wurtemberg, is extremely loose, amounting
to little more than a close defensive and offensive military
alliance, with a joint foreign policy, a common commercial
system, and a common legislation on a few topics." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** Bryce, "Holy Roman Empire", p. 434.]</p>
<p>The financial burden of imperialism is borne by the returns
from customs and excise and the other federal departments.
Deficiencies are made good by proportional contributions levied
on the States.</p>
<br>
<h4>THE JUDICIARY.</h4>
<p>The Federal Judiciary may be here dismissed by briefly
noticing that it does not perform functions corresponding to
those of the Supreme Court of the United States or the High Court
of Australia. True, it is a Court of Appeal from the State
Courts; but it does not act as the guardian of the Constitution,
since it has not been provided with the power to decide on the
constitutionality of a federal law.</p>
<br>
<h4>AMENDMENT.</h4>
<p>The Constitution would be classed as of the "rigid" type; but
it is the least rigid of its class, since amendment is secured
through the ordinary legislative machinery with but slight
restrictions. Fourteen votes in the Bundesrath against a proposed
amendment are sufficient to secure its rejection. Thus Prussia
alone, with its seventeen votes, or the four southern States with
their combined sixteen representatives, or even the seventeen
miniature States alone, though containing but five per cent, of
the total population, would be able to block any suggested
alteration in the Constitution. But, should the opposition amount
to less than fourteen votes, a constitutional amendment can be
effected by passing the proposal through all the stages necessary
for ordinary legislation.</p>

<h3>GENERAL APPENDIX (1.)</h3>
<p>Although South Africa has no proper claim to consideration in
a work on federal governments, yet the country is not without
some interest to the student of the Australian system. South
Africa effected a Constitutional Union in 1909 which, though not
federal in character, has nevertheless a federal suggestion in
respect of some of the provisions governing the relation of the
Union to the provinces. Partly for this reason, and partly
because it affords us an instance of "unification" which, some
prominent Australians assert, is the destined end of our own
Commonwealth, little apology is required for appending a slight
indication of the nature of the Union.</p>
<br>
<h4>SOUTH AFRICA.</h4>
<p>The four British colonies in South Africa&mdash;Cape of Good
Hope, Natal, Transvaal and Orange Free State&mdash;effected a
constitutional Union in 1909. The circumstances leading to this
solution of South African difficulties cannot be treated here.
Suffice it to say that federation had been in the air for over
half a century despite the racial antipathy of Briton and Boer. A
common danger from native risings necessitated a mutual
understanding between the political divisions. Hence Sir George
Grey advocated federal union as early as 1856. The attempt at
realisation, however, proved futile, even though a bill was
actually passed by the Imperial Parliament to that effect in
1877. For the next two decades intense racial antagonism,
culminating in the first and second Boer wars, precluded any
serious consideration of the question, but, after the surrender
of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State to Great Britain, the
necessity for the federal link appealed to both races. It seemed
to be the best means of solving the problems connected with the
native population, the tariff, and the railway rates. A
conference in 1908, discussing the internecine competition of the
railway companies, realised that commercial union was impossible
without political union. The question was taken up generally.
Closer Union Societies were formed. A Convention, meeting at
Durban and Cape Town (1908-9), and numbering amongst the
representatives of the four colonies our erstwhile foes, Botha,
Steyn, De la Rey and De Wet, together with Dr. Jameson and others
of British race, drafted a Constitution which was submitted to
the Legislatures of the respective colonies. The language
difficulty was surmounted by placing English and Dutch on a
footing of equality in all official proceedings, and the
Transvaal accordingly plumped for union. The question of the
native vote proved serious, as hitherto natives had been entitled
to vote in the Cape Colony only; but a compromise was effected,
which the other colonies were prevailed upon to accept. The Act
was signed by the King on the 20th September. 1909.</p>
<p>The four colonies have entered upon a much more unified system
of government than prevails in Australia. But nevertheless, they
retain a good deal of their individuality as provinces. We may
assert that a slight federal element exists in the provisions
which have been made for the maintenance of legislative and
administrative powers by the provinces in local and specially
reserved matters. For instance, there is but one
Governor&mdash;the Governor-General&mdash;for the whole of the
Union; but each province is furnished with a Chief Executive
Officer, with the official designation of Administrator,
appointed by the Governor-General for five years. Again, the
Executive Council of the Union attends to the administration of
such matters as were attended to by the executives of the various
colonies before the Union; still the administrators are assisted
by Provincial Executive Committees to carry on the administration
of provincial affairs. In the case of the Union Executive the
tenets of responsible government are strictly recognised, in that
members of the Executive must also be members of Parliament; but
the members of the Executive Committees of the provinces are not
necessarily members of the provincial Council though they are
elected by the Council. The Administrator may act on behalf of
the Governor-General without reference to the Executive; and both
the Administrator and the four members of the Executive may take
part in the proceedings of the Council, except that they are
debarred from voting unless members of the Council. These
provincial Councils may be regarded as reduced Parliaments. Their
continuance, numerical strength and the exercise of certain
powders, are vouched for in the Constitution. The Council is
elected for three years, and is not subject to dissolution during
that period; it numbers as many members (provided there are not
less than twenty-five) as there are representatives for that
province in the Union House of Assembly; it has power to tax
directly for provincial purposes, to borrow on the credit of the
province, and to pass ordinances on such matters as education
(primary and secondary), agriculture (to a certain extent),
hospitals and charitable institutions, divisional and municipal
institutions, roads, bridges, markets, fish and game
preservation, and local works, excepting those considered as
national in character. The Councillors receive remuneration.</p>
<p>The Union Parliament consists of the King (represented by the
Governor-General), the Senate and the House of Assembly. The two
Houses meet, and are prorogued and dissolved under the usual
conditions of responsible government. The Senate is partly
nominated and partly elected, and consists altogether of 40
members. The Governor-General nominates eight members&mdash;four
of whom are to have special ability to treat the alien race
question&mdash;for ten years. Each original province is also
represented by eight Senators elected for 10 years, in the first
instance by a joint sitting of the two Chambers of the moribund
local Legislatures, and on subsequent occasions by a joint
sitting of the provincial Councillors and the members of the
House of Assembly representing that province. The Union
Parliament, however, is free to provide otherwise for the
constitution of the Senate after the expiration of ten years.
Senators must be thirty years of age, five years resident in
South Africa, and British subjects of European descent. Elected
Senators must possess immovable property within the Union worth
at least &pound;500. The Assembly, consisting of 121 members, and
subject to increase up to 150 with the progress of population, is
chosen directly by the electors on the principle of proportional
representation, though the two smaller States&mdash;Natal and the
Orange Free State&mdash;have a representation slightly above that
warranted by population. The difficulty of the coloured voter
question was overcome by allowing natives already possessed of
the suffrage to vote, and making no change in this respect unless
the two Houses sitting together agree by not less than two-thirds
of the total number of members upon some new departure. Members
receive an allowance of &pound;400 per annum, subject to a
deduction of &pound;3 for every day of absence from the sittings.
Deadlocks between the two Houses are overcome without recourse to
a dissolution by a joint sitting, after one House has twice
rejected a bill of the other House.</p>
<p>The more unified character of the South African Constitution,
as compared with that of Australia, is evident by a clause which
states that "Parliament shall have <i>full</i> power to make laws
for the peace, order and good government of the Union." * Such a
clause dispenses with the necessity for an enumeration of the
powers such as is contained in the thirty-nine articles of clause
51 of the Australian Constitution Act.</p>
<p class="foot">[* South Africa Act, 1909, cl. 59.]</p>
<p>Thus we see that the provincial machinery consists of an
Administrator, an Executive Committee, and a Council; whilst the
Union equipment is a Governor-General, a Responsible Ministry,
and a Parliament of two Houses (Senate and House of Assembly).
The provinces are on a distinctly inferior footing to the States
of Australia.</p>
<p>The Union is provided with a Supreme Court, consisting of a
Chief Justice, judges of appeal and judges of the several
divisions of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Courts of the
provinces were reduced to provincial divisions of the Supreme
Court, whilst District Courts were correspondingly reduced to
local divisions. These provincial and local divisions have
original jurisdiction as exercised by the corresponding courts
before the Union as well as in matters in which the validity of a
provincial ordinance (<i>i.e.</i>, ordinance issued by the
provincial Council) is involved, or in which the Union is a
party. Appeals from the Supreme Court to the King in Council are
not permitted unless the King himself exercises his right to
grant special leave of appeal.</p>
<p>The financial arrangements between the Union and the provinces
are simple and undefined except on one point. Each province is to
receive an amount equal to that provided in the estimates for
education in the year preceding the Union, as well as such other
sums as the Governor-General considers necessary. The Provincial
Executive Committees are to submit estimates of expenditure and
not to exceed the amount provided. The Union assumed all
provincial debts and liabilities existing in 1909, and took over
all harbours and railways. Freetrade was established throughout
the Union.</p>
<p>The Parliament may amend its own Constitution, except that it
cannot change any provision for the operation of which a definite
time limit is prescribed; nor can it disturb the arrangements for
the equal footing of the two languages, or for electoral
qualifications, unless two-thirds of the total number of the
members of the two Chambers acquiesce in such change at a joint
sitting. Parliament sits at Cape Town; the seat of government is
at Pretoria; whilst the principal centre for the Court of Appeal
is Bloemfontein.</p>
