<h3><a name="I">I</a></h3>

<p>Professor Jarvis sat among piles of reference-books, and
stacks of notes and jottings, the silence about him unbroken save
for the ceaseless scratching of his pen.</p>

<p>Professor Jarvis hated bustle and noise of all sorts, for they
destroyed that continuity of thought, that following out of
proved facts to their primary hypotheses, which was to him the
chief end and aim of existence; therefore he inhabited the
thirtieth storey.</p>

<p>He had seen none but John, his valet, for nearly a month,
sitting night after night, perched high above the great city,
busied upon the work of which he had dreamed for years, his
treatise upon "The Higher Ethics of Philosophy," and already it
neared completion. A spirit of work had come upon him these last
few weeks, a spirit that was a devil, cruel, relentless, allowing
of no respite from the strain of intricate thought and
nerve-racking effort; hence the Professor sat writing night after
night, and had of late done with little sleep and much black
coffee.</p>

<p>To-night, however, he felt strangely tired, he laid down his
pen, and, resting his throbbing temples between his hands, stared
down vacantly at the sheets of manuscript before him.</p>

<p>As he leaned thus, striving against a feeling of nausea that
had recurred frequently the last few days, the long,
close-written lines became to him "things" endowed with sinuous
life, that moved, squirming a thousand legs across the white
paper.</p>

<p>Professor Jarvis closed his eyes and sighed wearily. "I really
must get some sleep," he said to himself, "I wonder when it was I
slept last?" As he spoke he tried unsuccessfully to yawn and
stretch himself. His glance, wandering aimlessly, paused at the
lamp upon the desk before him, and as he stared at it, he noticed
that the "things" had got from the paper and were writhing and
creeping up the green shade. He sighed again, and his fingers
fumbled among the papers beside him for the electric bell. Almost
immediately, it seemed to him, he heard John's voice rather faint
and far-away, responding from the shadow that lay beyond the
light of the lamp.</p>

<p>"John, if you are really there, be so good as to switch on the
light," said the Professor. "John," he continued, blinking at his
valet in the sudden glare, "when did I sleep last?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, you haven't rightly slept for a week now, just a
doze now and then on the couch, sir, but that's nothing; if
you'll allow me to advise you, sir, the best thing you could do
would be to go to bed at once."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the Professor. "Thank you, John, but your
advice, though excellent, is impracticable. I am engaged upon my
last chapter, and sleep is impossible until it is finished."</p>

<p>"Begging your pardon, sir," began John, "but if you were to
try undressing and going to bed properly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, John!" cried the Professor, with a sudden
access of anger that was strangely at variance with his usual
placid manner, "do you think I wouldn't sleep if I could? Can't
you see I'm sick for sleep? I tell you I'd sleep if I could, but
I can't&mdash;there can be no rest for me I know now, until I've
finished my book, and that will be somewhere about dawn," and the
Professor glared up at John, his thick brows twitching, and his
eyes glowing within the pale oval of his face with an unpleasant
light.</p>

<p>"If you would only give up drinking so much black coffee, sir;
they do say it's very bad for the nerves&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I think they are right," put in the Professor, and his
voice was as gentle as ever. "Yes, I think they are right. For
instance, John, at this precise moment I have a feeling that
there is a hand groping behind the curtains yonder. Yet this
mental attitude harmonises in a manner with the subject of this
last chapter, which deals with the psychic forces of nature. I
allude, John, more especially to the following passage:</p>

<p>"'That mysterious power which some call the soul, if
sufficiently educated, may cast off for a time this bodily flesh,
and precipitate itself into illimitable spaces, riding upon the
winds, walking upon the beds of seas and rivers, and indeed may
even re-inhabit the bodies of those that have been long dead,
provided they could be kept from corruption.'" The Professor
leaned back in his chair, and continued in the voice of one
thinking aloud:</p>

<p>"All this was known centuries ago, notably to the priests of
Isis and the early Chaldeans, and is practised to-day in some
small part by the fakirs of India and the lamas of Tibet, and yet
is looked upon by the ignorant world as little more than cheap
trickery. By the way," he broke off, becoming suddenly aware of
John's presence, "didn't you ask for leave of absence until
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir, I did," admitted John, "but I thought I'd put
it off, seeing you are so&mdash;so busy, sir."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, John, don't waste the evening, it must be getting
late, just brew some more coffee in the samovar, and then you can
go." John hesitated, but meeting the Professor's eye, obeyed; and
having set the steaming samovar on a small table at his master's
elbow and put the room in order, he turned to the door.</p>

<p>"I shall be back in the morning at eight o'clock, sir."</p>

<p>"Very good, John," said the Professor, sipping his coffee.
"Good-night, John."</p>

<p>"Good-night, sir," returned John, and, closing the door behind
him, stood for a moment to shake his head. "He isn't fit to be
left alone," he muttered, "but I'll get back before eight
to-morrow morning, yes, I'll take good care to be back before
eight." So saying, he turned, and went softly along the
passage.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h3>

<p>For a long time the Professor had sat crouched above his desk,
yet in the last half-hour he had not added a single word to the
page before him, for somewhere beneath his brain a small hammer
seemed tap-tapping, soft and slow and regular, rendering the
stillness about him but the more profound. Slowly and gradually a
feeling of expectation grew upon him, a foolishly persistent
expectation of something that was drawing near and nearer to him
with every stroke of the hammer&mdash;something that he could
neither guess at, nor hope to arrest, only, he knew that it was
coming, coming, and he waited with straining ears, listening for
the unknown.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from somewhere in the world far below, a clock
chimed midnight, and as the last strokes died there was a hurry
of footsteps along the corridor without, a knock, and a fumbling
at the handle. As the Professor rose, the door opened, and a
shortish, stoutish individual, chiefly remarkable for a round,
red face, and a bristle of grey hair, trotted in, and was shaking
him by the hand&mdash;talking meanwhile in that quick jerky style
that was characteristic of Magnus McManus, whose researches in
Lower Egypt and along the Nile during the last ten years had made
his name famous.</p>

<p>"My dear Dick," he began, "good God, how ill you
look!&mdash;frightful&mdash;overwork as usual, eh?"</p>

<p>"Why, Magnus!" exclaimed the Professor, "I thought you were in
Egypt?"</p>

<p>"Exactly&mdash;so I was&mdash;came back last week with a
specimen&mdash;been in New York three days&mdash;must get back to
the Nile at once&mdash;booked passage yesterday&mdash;sail
to-morrow&mdash;noon. You see, Dick," continued Magnus, trotting
up and down the room, "I received a cable from
Tarrant&mdash;overseer of the excavations, you know&mdash;to say
they've come upon a monolith&mdash;Coptic
inscriptions&mdash;curious&mdash;may be
important&mdash;very."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded the Professor.</p>

<p>"So just looked you up, Dick&mdash;to ask you to take charge
of this specimen I brought over&mdash;thought you wouldn't mind
keeping it until I got back."</p>

<p>"Certainly, of course," said the Professor rather
absently.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly the greatest find of the age," pursued Magnus,
"stupendous&mdash;will throw a new light on Egyptian
history&mdash;there is not in the whole world, so far as is
known, such another mummy."</p>

<p>"A what?" exclaimed the Professor, "did you say 'mummy'?"</p>

<p>"To be sure," nodded Magnus, "though the term is
inapt&mdash;this is something more than your ordinary dried-up
mummy."</p>

<p>"And have you&mdash;have you brought it with you, Magnus?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;it's waiting outside in the corridor."</p>

<p>For no apparent reason the Professor shivered violently, and
the nausea came upon him again.</p>

<p>"The deuce of a time getting it here&mdash;awkward to handle,
you know," and as he spoke Magnus turned and trotted from the
room. There came a murmur of voices outside, a shuffle and
stagger of approaching footsteps as of men who bore a heavy
burden, and above all the excited tones of Magnus.</p>

<p>"Easy there&mdash;mind that corner&mdash;steady, steady, don't
jar it; now, gently&mdash;so." And Magnus reappeared, followed by
four men who bent beneath something in shape between a
packing-case and a coffin, which by the direction of Magnus they
sat carefully down in a convenient corner.</p>

<p>"Now," cried he, as soon as they were alone, drawing a small
screwdriver from his pocket, "I'm going to show you something
that will make you doubt the evidence of your eyes&mdash;as I did
myself at first&mdash;a wonder, Dick&mdash;that will set all the
societies gaping&mdash;open-mouthed&mdash;like fools."</p>

<p>One by one Magnus extracted the screws that held down the lid,
while the Professor watched, wide-eyed,
waiting&mdash;waiting.</p>

<p>"This specimen will be a revelation on the art of embalming,"
continued Magnus, busy upon the last screw. "Here is no stuffed
and withered, dried-up wisp of humanity. Whoever did this was a
genius&mdash;positively&mdash;there has been no disembowelling
here&mdash;deuce take this screw&mdash;body is as perfect as when
life first left it&mdash;and mark me, Dick&mdash;it can't be less
than six thousand years old at the very least&mdash;probably
older. I tell you it's beyond all wonder, but there&mdash;judge
for yourself!" and with these words, Magnus laid down the
screwdriver, lifted off the heavy lid and stood aside.</p>

<p>The Professor drew a deep breath, his fingers clutching
convulsively at his chair-arms, as he stared at that which lay,
or rather stood, within the glass-fronted shell or coffin.</p>

<p>And what he saw was an oval face framed in black hair, a face
full and unshrunken, yet of a hideous ashen-grey, a high, thin,
aquiline nose with delicate proud-curving nostrils, and below, a
mouth, blue-lipped, yet in whose full, cruel lines lurked a
ghastly mockery that carried with it a nameless horror.</p>

<p>"Must have been handsome at one time," said Magnus. "Very much
so indeed&mdash;regular features and all that&mdash;pure Egyptian
type, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;the&mdash;the face of a devil," muttered the
Professor thickly. "I wonder what&mdash;what lies behind those
eyelids, they seem as if they might lift at any moment, and if
they did&mdash;&mdash;Oh, I tell you it is horrible."</p>

<p>Magnus laughed. "Thought she'd astonish you&mdash;will knock
science deaf and dumb&mdash;not a doubt. The setting of these
stones," he continued with a complacent air, "round her
neck&mdash;uncut emeralds they are&mdash;dates quite back to the
Fifth Dynasty&mdash;yet that scarab on her breast seems even
earlier still&mdash;the gold embroidery on her gown beats
me&mdash;quite&mdash;and the thumb-ring by its shape would almost
seem to belong to the Fifteenth Dynasty. Altogether she's a
puzzle. Another peculiar thing was that&mdash;mouth and nostrils
had been&mdash;plugged by a kind of cement&mdash;deuce of a time
getting it out.</p>

<p>"The inscription upon her sarcophagus," he ran on, "describes
her as: 'Ahasuera, Princess of the House of Ra, in the reign of
Raman Kau Ra,' possibly another title for Seti The Second. I also
came upon a papyrus&mdash;very important&mdash;and three tablets,
have only had time to dip into them hastily&mdash;but from what I
gather, Ahasuera appears to have been of a very evil
reputation&mdash;combination of Semiramis, Cleopatra, and
Messalina, multiplied by three! One of her lovers was a certain
Ptomes, High Priest of the Temple of Osiris, who is spoken of as
'one greatly versed in the arts and mysteries of Isis and the
high Gods.' When I first opened her sarcophagus, from the strange
disorder of the wrappings&mdash;almost seemed as if she must have
moved&mdash;also the golden death-mask that had covered her face
had fallen off&mdash;which was curious&mdash;very. Upon examining
this mask&mdash;found an inscription across the
forehead&mdash;puzzled me for days&mdash;meaning came to me all
at once&mdash;in bed&mdash;might be translated by a line of
doggerel verse something like this:</p>

<p class="poem">'<i>Isis awhile hath stayed my breath,<br>
Whoso wakes me shall find death</i>.'</p>

<p>which is also curious, eh? Why, Great heavens, man! What ails
you?" Magnus broke off, for he had turned and looked at his
friend for the first time.</p>

<p>"Nothing," returned the Professor in the same thick voice.
"Nothing&mdash;only cover it up&mdash;cover it up in God's
name."</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;to be sure," said Magnus, staring. "Had no
idea it would affect you like that, nerves must be at sixes and
sevens, should take more care of yourself, Dick, and stop that
confounded black coffee."</p>

<p>As the last screw was driven home, the Professor laughed, a
little wildly. "There are eighteen screws, about two and a half
inches long, eh, Magnus?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Magnus and turned to stare again.</p>

<p>"Good," the Professor rejoined with the same strange laugh.
Magnus forced a smile.</p>

<p>"Why, Dick," he began, "you almost talk as though you
imagined&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Those eyes," the Professor broke in, "they haunt me, they are
the eyes of one who waits to take you unawares, they are eyes
that watch and follow you behind your back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh! nonsense, Dick," cried Magnus, rather hastily. "This is
nothing but imagination&mdash;sheer imagination. You ought to
take a holiday or you will be suffering from hallucinations
next."</p>

<p>"Sit still and listen," said the Professor, and he began to
read from the manuscript before him:</p>

<p>"'That mysterious power which some call the soul, if
sufficiently educated, may cast off for a time this bodily flesh
and precipitate itself into illimitable spaces, riding upon the
winds, walking upon the beds of seas and rivers, and indeed may
even re-inhabit the bodies of those that have been long dead,
provided that body could be kept free from corruption.'"</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Magnus, crossing his legs. "Well?"</p>

<p>"'Provided that body could be kept free from corruption,'"
repeated the Professor, then, raising his arm with a sudden
gesture, he pointed at the thing in the corner: "That is not
death," he said.</p>

<p>Magnus leaped to his feet. "Man, are you mad," he cried, "what
do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Suspended animation!" said the Professor.</p>

<p>For a long moment there was silence, during which the two men
stared into each other's eyes; the face of Magnus had lost some
of its colour, and the Professor's fingers moved nervously upon
his chair-arms. Suddenly Magnus laughed, though perhaps a trifle
too boisterously.</p>

<p>"Bosh!" he exclaimed, "what folly are you talking, Dick? What
you require is a good stiff glass of brandy and bed afterwards,"
and with the knowledge and freedom of an old friend, he crossed
to a corner cabinet, and took thence a decanter and glasses,
pouring out a stiff peg into each.</p>

<p>"So you don't agree with me, Magnus?" "Agree, no," said
Magnus, swallowing his brandy at a gulp, "it's all
nerves&mdash;damn 'em."</p>

<p>The Professor shook his head. "There are more things in heaven
and earth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, I know&mdash;I have cursed Shakespeare
frequently for that same quotation."</p>

<p>"But you yourself wrote a paper, Magnus, only a few years ago,
on the hypnotic trances practised by the Egyptians."</p>

<p>"Now, Dick," expostulated Magnus, "be reasonable, for heaven's
sake! Is it possible that any trance could extend into six or
seven thousand years? Preposterous, utterly. Come, get to bed,
man, like a sensible chap&mdash;where's John?"</p>

<p>"I gave him leave of absence until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"The deuce you did?" exclaimed Magnus, glancing round the room
with an uneasy feeling. "Well, I'll take his place&mdash;see you
into bed and all that."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Magnus, but it's no good," returned the Professor,
shaking his head. "I couldn't sleep until I've finished this last
chapter, and it won't take long."</p>

<p>"One o'clock, by Gad!" exclaimed Magnus, glancing at his
watch. "Must hurry off, Dick&mdash;hotel&mdash;sail to-morrow,
you know."</p>

<p>The Professor shivered, and rose to his feet. "Good-bye,
Magnus," he said as they shook hands. "I hope your monolith will
turn out a good find. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"Thanks, old fellow," said Magnus, returning the pressure.
"Now, no more poisonous coffee, mind." So saying he trotted to
the door, nodded, and was gone.</p>

<p>The Professor sat for a moment with puckered brows, then,
rising hastily, crossed to the door, turned the handle, and
peered out into the dim light of the corridor.</p>

<p>"Magnus," he called in a hoarse whisper. "Magnus."</p>

<p>"Well?" came the answer.</p>

<p>"Then you don't think It will open Its eyes, do you,
Magnus?"</p>

<p>"Good God&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Professor, and closed the door.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h3>

<p>"I wish," said the Professor, as he took up his pen, "I wish
that I had not let John go, I feel strangely lonely to-night, and
John is so very matter of fact," so saying he bent to his writing
again. His brain had grown singularly bright and clear, all his
faculties seemed strung to their highest pitch, a feeling of
exaltation had taken possession of him. His ideas grew luminous,
intricate thoughts became coherent, the words shaping themselves
beneath his pen with a subtle power and eloquence.</p>

<p>Yet all at once, and for no apparent reason, in the very
middle of a sentence, a desire seized upon him to turn his head
and look back over his shoulder at that which stood in the
corner. He checked it with an effort, and his pen resumed its
scratching; though all the time he was conscious that the desire
was growing, and that sooner or later it would master him. Not
that he expected to see anything unusual, that was absurd, of
course. He began trying to remember how many screws there were
holding down the lid upon that Thing, whose lips had mocked at
God and man through centuries and whose eyes&mdash;ah, whose
eyes&mdash;&mdash; The Professor turned suddenly, and with his
pen extended before him, began counting the glinting screw-heads
to himself in an undertone.</p>

<p>"One, two three, four, five, six&mdash;six along each side,
and three along the top and bottom&mdash;eighteen in all. And
they were steel screws, too, a quarter of an inch thick, and two
and a half inches in length; they ought to be strong enough, and
yet eighteen after all was not many; why hasn't Magnus used more
of them, it would have been so much&mdash;&mdash;" The Professor
checked himself, and turned back to his work; but he tried vainly
to write, for now the impulse held him without respite, growing
more insistent each moment, an impulse that had fear beneath it,
fear born of things that move behind one. 'Ah, yes, behind
one&mdash;why had he let It be placed in the corner that was
directly behind his chair?' He rose and began pulling and
dragging at his desk, but it was heavy, and defied his efforts;
yet the physical exertion, futile though it was, seemed to calm
him, but though he bent resolutely above his task&mdash;the
finishing of his great book&mdash;his mind was absent, and the
pen between his fingers traced idle patterns and meaningless
scribbles upon the sheet before him, so he tossed it aside, and
buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that in the darkness behind the lid with
the eighteen screws the eyes were still shut, or were
they&mdash;&mdash;? The Professor shivered. Ah, if he could but
know, if he could only be certain&mdash;he wished John was
here&mdash;John was so very matter of fact&mdash;he might have
sat and watched It&mdash;yes, he had been foolish to let John go.
The Professor sighed, and, opening his eyes, remained
motionless&mdash;staring down at the sheet of foolscap before
him&mdash;staring at the two uneven lines scrawled across it in
ragged capitals that were none of his:</p>

<p class="poem">"<i>Isis awhile hath stayed my breath,<br>
Whoso wakes me shall find death</i>."</p>

<p>A sudden piping, high-pitched laugh startled him&mdash;"Could
it really be issuing from his own lips?" he asked himself, and
indeed he knew it must be so. He sat with every nerve
tingling&mdash;hoping, praying for something to break the heavy
silence&mdash;the creak of a footstep&mdash;a shout&mdash;a
scream&mdash;anything rather than that horrible laugh; and as he
waited it came again, louder, wilder than before. And now he felt
it quivering between his teeth, rattling in his throat, shaking
him to and fro in its grip, then, swift as it had come it was
gone, and the Professor was looking down at a litter of torn
paper at his feet. He reached out a trembling hand to the rack
upon his desk and taking down a pipe already filled, lighted it.
The tobacco seemed to soothe him, and he inhaled it deeply,
watching it rise in blue, curling spirals above his head, watched
it roll in thin clouds across the room, until he noticed that it
always drifted in the same direction, to hang like a curtain
above one point, an ever-moving curtain behind which were shadowy
"somethings" that moved and writhed.</p>

<p>The Professor got unsteadily to his legs.</p>

<p>"Magnus was right," he muttered, "I am ill, I must try to
sleep&mdash;I must&mdash;I must." But as he stood there, leaning
his shaking hands upon the table-edge, the blind fear, the
unreasoning dread against which he had battled so vainly all
night swept over him in an irresistible wave; his breath choked,
a loathing horror shook him from head to foot, yet all the time
his gaze never left the great white box, with its narrow
screw-heads that stared at him like little searching eyes.
Something glittered upon the floor beside it, and almost before
he knew he had snatched up the screwdriver. He worked feverishly
until but one screw remained, and as he stopped to wipe the sweat
from his cheek he was surprised to find himself singing a song he
had heard at a music-hall years before, in his college days; then
he held his breath as the last screw gave.</p>

<p>... The oval face framed in a mist of black hair, the long
voluptuous eyes with their heavy lids, the aquiline nose, the
cruel curve of the nostrils, and the full-lipped sensual mouth,
with its everlasting mockery; he had seen it all before, and yet
as he gazed he was conscious of a change, subtle and horrible, a
change that he could not define, yet which held him as one
entranced. With an effort he turned away his eyes, and tried to
replace the lid, but could not; he looked about him wildly, then
snatching up a heavily fringed rug, covered the horror from
sight.</p>

<p>"Magnus was right," he repeated, "I must sleep," and crossing
to the couch, he sank upon it and hid his face among the
cushions.</p>

<p>A long time he lay there, but sleep was impossible, for the
sound of the hammers was in his ears again, but louder now and
seeming to beat upon his very brain. What was that other
sound&mdash;that came to him beneath the
hammer-strokes&mdash;could it be a footstep? He sat up listening,
and then he noticed that the fringe upon the rug was moving. He
rubbed his eyes, disbelieving, until all at once it was shaken by
another movement that ran up it with a strange rippling motion.
He rose, trembling, and creeping forward, tore away the rug. Then
he saw and understood the change that had baffled him before; and
with the knowledge, the might of his learning, the strength of
his manhood, deserted him, and covering his face, Professor
Jarvis rocked his body to and fro making a strange whimpering
noise, like a little child; for the ashen grey was gone from the
face, and the lips which had been black were blood-red. For a
while the Professor continued to rock to and fro, whimpering
behind his hands, till with a sudden gesture, wild and
passionate, he tossed his arms above his head.</p>

<p>"My God!" he cried, "I'm going mad&mdash;I am mad, oh,
anything but that&mdash;not mad, no, not mad&mdash;I am not
mad&mdash;-no." Chancing to catch sight of himself in a mirror,
he shook his head and chuckled. "Not mad," he whispered to his
reflection, "oh, no," then he turned to the case once more, and
began patting and stroking the glass.</p>

<p>"Oh, Eyes of Death, lift thy lashes, for I am fain to know the
mystery beyond. What though I be the Priest Ptomes, even he that
put this magic upon thee, yet am I come back to thee, Beloved,
and my soul calleth unto thine even as in Thebes of old. Oh, Eyes
of Death, lift thy lashes, for I am fain to know the mystery
beyond. While thy soul slept, mine hath hungered for thee through
countless ages, and now is the time of waiting accomplished. Oh,
Eyes of Death, lift thy lashes, for I am fain to know the mystery
beyond. Ah, God," he broke out suddenly, "she will not
wake&mdash;I cannot wake her." And he writhed his fingers
together. All at once his aspect changed, his mouth curved with a
smile of cunning, he crept to where a small mirror hung upon the
wall, and, with a swift movement, hid it beneath his coat, and,
crossing to his desk, propped it up before him.</p>

<p>"They will not open while I look and wait for it," he said,
nodding and smiling to himself. "They are the eyes of one who
waits to take you unawares, that watch and follow you behind your
back, yet I shall see them, yes, I shall see them."</p>

<p>From the world below came the long-drawn tooting of a steamer
on the river, and with the sound, faint and far-away though it
was, reason reasserted itself.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he exclaimed, trying to laugh. "What a fool I
am to let a pitiful bit of dead humanity drive me half-wild with
fear, and in New York too, it seems inconceivable." So saying the
Professor crossed to the brandy, and, with his back turned
resolutely, slowly drained his glass, yet even then he was
vaguely conscious of eyes that watched him, followed his every
movement, and with difficulty he forbore from swinging round on
his heel. With the same iron will crushing down his rebellious
nerves, he arranged his papers and took up his pen.</p>

<p>The human body after all has certain attributes of the cur,
for let that master, the mind, chastise it, and it will cringe,
let him command and it will obey. So the Professor sat, his eye
clear, his hand firm, scarcely noticing the mirror beside him,
even when he paused to take a fresh sheet.</p>

<p>The sickly grey of dawn was at the windows as he paused to
glance at his watch. "Another half-hour," he muttered, "and my
work is done, ended, fin&mdash;&mdash;" The word died upon his
lips, for his glance by accident had fallen upon the mirror, and
the eyes were wide open. For a long moment they looked into his
ere their lids fluttered and fell.</p>

<p>"I am suffering from hallucinations," he groaned. "It is one
of the results of loss of sleep, but I wish John was back, John
is such a matter-of-fact&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a sound behind him, a sound soft and gentle like the
whisper of wind in trees, or the brushing of drapery against a
wall&mdash;and it was moving across the floor behind him. A chill
as of death shuddered through him, and he knew the terror that is
dumb.</p>

<p>Scarcely daring to look, full of a dread of expectation, he
lifted his eyes to the mirror. The case behind him was empty; he
turned swiftly, and there, so close that he might almost touch it
was, the "Thing" he had called a pitiful bit of dead humanity.
Slowly, inch by inch, it moved towards him, with a scrape and
rustle of stiff draperies:</p>

<p class="poem">"<i>Isis awhile hath stayed my breath,<br>
Whoso wakes me, shall find&mdash;death</i>!"</p>

<p>With a cry that was something between a scream and a laugh he
leaped to his feet and hurled himself upon It; there was the
sound of a dull blow, a gasp, and Professor Jarvis was lying upon
the floor, his arms wide-tossed, and his face hidden in the folds
of a rug.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">*   *   *   *   *</p>

<p>Next day there was a paragraph in the papers, which read as
follows:</p>

<p>"<i>STRANGE DEATH</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Yesterday at his chambers in &mdash;&mdash; Street,
Professor Jarvis, the famous Scientist, was found dead,
presumably of heart-failure. A curious feature of the case was
that a mummy which had stood in a rough travelling-case in a
corner on the opposite side of the room was found lying across
the Professor's dead body</i>."</p>
