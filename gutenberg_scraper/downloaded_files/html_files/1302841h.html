  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE MIRACLE MAN</h2>

  <p class="first">From Dawson to the Bering Sea, Cobalt had no other name. The
  flame of his hair never won him the nickname of "Red" or "Brick." He was only
  Cobalt from the beginning to the end, and this name, no doubt, was given to
  him by his eyes, which varied according to his temper from a dull-steel gray
  to an intense blue with fire behind it. Everyone knew Cobalt. He had come
  over the pass three years before, and for every step that he took, rumor took
  ten more. Lightning splashed from the feet of the running gods, and startling
  reports had spread like lightning from the steps of Cobalt. Many of the
  things which were said of him never could have been true, but he gathered
  mystery and an air of enchantment about him. Even what men could not believe,
  they wanted to believe. There is no human being who has not reveled in fairy
  tales, and Cobalt was a fairy tale.</p>

  <p>He was not beautiful, but he was glorious. When one saw him, one believed,
  or hypnotized oneself into believing the tales that were told of him. Cobalt
  never verified or confirmed any of these stories. He never repeated a
  syllable of them, but of course he must have known about them. All of these
  tales were remarkable, and some of them were sheer impossibilities, but it is
  as well to note some of them at the beginning. Men are not what they are, but
  what other people think them to be. So it was with Cobalt and, in order to
  know him, one must know of the opinions of his peers.</p>

  <p>They told of Cobalt that he once ate eleven pounds of beef, slept twenty
  hours, and then did a full man's work in hauling for eight days without any
  sustenance except the bits of snow which he picked up and ate to quench his
  thirst. Four men attested to the truth of this tale. They said that the thing
  was the result of a bet, but I never have heard that they actually weighed
  the meat. Also I have seen eleven pounds of beef and, when cut as steaks, it
  makes an imposing heap. That tale of Cobalt was typical in that it showed a
  superhuman quality and also a half-mad, half-gay willingness to tackle
  anything for a bet, a jest, or a serious purpose.</p>

  <p>It was said that once he jumped from a fifty-foot bridge and spoiled a
  fifty-dollar suit in order to win a one-dollar bet. This tale is among the
  ridiculous and impossible stories which are told of Cobalt, so that one would
  say that the man must have been absolutely mad to inspire such talk. However,
  it just happens that I was present and saw him take the dive.</p>

  <p>It was said of Cobalt that in a traveling circus he saw a strong man lift
  a platform on which there was a piano, a woman playing the piano, and a small
  dog. The man was labeled the strongest in the world as a matter of course.
  Cobalt, on another bet, added to the platform another woman, another dog, and
  the strong man himself and lifted the entire enormous load. Of this story I
  have nothing to say, and I shall make very little comment upon the others.
  The items illustrating his strength were innumerable. It was said that he had
  taken a good-size steel bar and bent it into a horseshoe. This twisted bar
  was kept on the wall of a saloon in Circle City. Men used to look at it,
  shake their heads over it, and try their own petty strength in a vain effort
  to change its shape. They always failed and finally that bar became a rather
  silly legend at which men laughed.</p>

  <p>Then one day Cobalt came back. Someone asked him to unbend the steel bar,
  and it was handed to him. I myself was there, and I saw the purple vein lift
  and swell in a straight, diagonal line in his forehead, as he bent the bar
  into a straight line once more. He threw it to the man who had asked him to
  attempt the feat, and thereafter the bar was reinstalled upon the wall. Long
  after, it still remained there and must have been worth a fortune to the
  saloon keeper, so many people went in to look at the famous bar where the
  metal had failed to straighten correctly. Nearly everyone handled it and
  tried it between his hands, or even across his knee, but no one could alter
  the thing.</p>

  <p>It was said that once he hit a man and killed him with a blow to the body.
  That has been done before, and actually the blow of a gloved hand has killed
  a man in the ring, a trained heavyweight who was struck over the heart. The
  miraculous feature of Cobalt's punch was that it had landed not on the left
  but upon the right side of the body. The blow was said to have broken three
  ribs. This always seemed to me one of the most incredible tales about Cobalt,
  but I have talked with Gene Pelham, now of Portland, Maine, and he declares
  that he was the physician who examined the body. He makes this report: that
  the man was a big Canuck with the build of a heavyweight wrestling champion
  and the bones to go with it. Upon the right side of the man, where the ribs
  spring out most boldly, there was a great purple welt and under this welt
  there actually were three broken ribs.</p>

  <p>I asked the doctor if the breaking of the ribs upon the right side could
  have killed the man, big and strong as he was. He told me that it could
  hardly have been breaking of the ribs, but the effects of shock operate
  strangely. There was a bruise at the base of the Canuck's skull, and the
  doctor felt sure that his death had been due to concussion of the brain,
  owing to the manner in which his head struck the floor in falling.</p>

  <p>Another exhibit for Cobalt was a row of four whiskey bottles in the Circle
  City saloon. Three were empty and one was about a third full. It was solemnly
  declared that he had drunk all of that whiskey during a single long session
  in the saloon. This would have been about two-thirds of a gallon of strong
  whiskey. The exhibit was kept on show partly as a curiosity and partly to
  demonstrate the excellent quality of the red-eye which was sold in the
  saloon. I leave those to judge of this feat who know what a strong head is
  needed to resist the punishment contained in a single bottle of whiskey.</p>

  <p>In Eagle Falls I saw a large axe blade whose head was completely buried in
  hardwood and the handle shattered. This had been accomplished, it was said,
  at a single stroke by Cobalt. I examined the head of the axe carefully, and
  it seemed to me that I could detect the evidences of hammering to force the
  axe deeper into the wood.</p>

  <p>These anecdotes may help to prepare the reader for the state of mind
  through which the men of the arctic looked at Cobalt. In person he was not a
  giant. I never heard his exact height or weight, but he looked not an inch
  over six feet, and his shoulders were by no means as massive as many I have
  seen. In fact, there was nothing remarkable about him except when he got in
  action. To see him sitting, Cobalt was nothing unusual. When he spoke, there
  was an odd quality about his voice that made men turn their heads and women
  also. When he walked, his step had the quality of one about to leap away at
  full speed.</p>

  <p>He came in during the early days, well before the Dawson rush. He was
  twenty-two when he reached Circle City, and he mined there for two years
  before the Bairds arrived. That was the turning point in Cobalt's life. Most
  of the men who have been in Circle City can remember Henry Baird, his rosy
  face, his lack of eyebrows, and his wonderful luck at the mines. And even
  those who never saw her know all about his daughter, Sylvia.</p>

  <p>I suppose she was what a scientist would have called a biological "sport,"
  a freak, a sudden throw forward from her ancestry. Certainly there appeared
  to be nothing of her father about her. Her hair was glistening black and fine
  as a spider's web. She had black eyebrows, beautifully arched, and under the
  brows were blue eyes not gray blue, not sky blue, but the lustrous and
  unfathomable blue of the sea. She was rather small; I don't think that a big
  woman could have been made so exquisitely. It was enough for me to sit at
  Henry Baird's table and look at her hand alone, at the luster of the pink
  nails and the white glow of the skin. She was a radiant creature.</p>

  <p>Nearly everyone in Circle City went mad about her, but I don't think that
  even the most audacious thought of making love to her. She was too beautiful.
  Her beauty set her apart. We looked up to her as to a being of another world.
  We talked to her with an odd respect, as if to some famous sage or reverend
  divine. Then young Cobalt came in and saw her.</p>

  <p>Some people said that he did not need to <i>go</i> mad, because he had
  always been mad. Nobody but a madman would have done the things he had
  accomplished or tried to accomplish. Nobody, for instance, would have driven
  a team of six timber wolves and treated them like dogs. So it followed, as a
  matter of course, when Cobalt saw the girl, he tried to scale heaven and get
  at her. He saw her once and went right down to see Henry Baird. Baird was new
  to the country, but naturally he had heard a great deal about Cobalt.</p>

  <p>He was rather frightened when the famous young man came in, took his hand
  in that terrible grasp of his, and looked him in the face with those
  steel-gray eyes which turned to pale-blue flame when he spoke of Sylvia.
  However, Baird was a sensible man. He said that he had not the slightest
  objection to Cobalt. For his own part he hoped that his daughter would not
  marry a man with less than a hundred thousand and a home to offer her. Of
  course, a hundred thousand meant a great deal more in those days than it does
  now. But everything really depended upon Sylvia herself. Had Cobalt spoken to
  her before on the subject? Did she care for him?</p>

  <p>Cobalt said that he hadn't, but that he would make her care. That was how
  the trouble started. He went to Sylvia and spoke to her. And Sylvia
  laughed!</p>

  <p>"Are you doing this on a bet, Cobalt?" she asked.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; MODERN GAL</h2>

  <p class="first">I can see Sylvia as she must have been that day, muffled in
  that fine suit of brown furs, with her lovely mouth, and her shining eyes
  glowing like heaven's light through a cloud. Cobalt stared at her as no human
  being ever had stared at her before.</p>

  <p>"Do that ag'in," he said.</p>

  <p>"What?" asked Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"Laugh at me!"</p>

  <p>She looked him up and down. No one ever had looked at him in such a manner
  before that moment no one at least in his right mind. A man did not have to
  know about Cobalt beforehand. His strength advertised itself, as fire is
  advertised by its flame. Sylvia was not afraid. Why should she be? Men were
  merely men! Cobalt might bend steel bars, but Sylvia had bent and molded
  whole brigades of young fellows and oldish fellows, too. Millions had been
  offered to her. She had stepped through rivers of gold and diamonds and never
  allowed the stuff to stick to her. She looked at Cobalt with the double
  strength of the proud and the good, with a spice of malice thrown in. How
  could she help being spiteful, when this fellow came along and dared to look
  at her as though she were merely a desirable girl?</p>

  <p>"Will you slap me if I laugh?" asked Sylvia, and with that she let her
  laughter peal.</p>

  <p>She had a way of putting up her chin a little and lowering her eyes when
  she laughed. Cobalt stood there and watched her.</p>

  <p>"It's good," said Cobalt. "It's dog-gone good. It's like medicine to
  me."</p>

  <p>"Is it?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>She must have widened her eyes a trifle when she heard him speak like
  this. If she had any wit at all, she knew that he was out of the common run
  of men.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "it does me good to hear you laugh. You're pert, aren't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Pert?" asked Sylvia, her spirit beginning to rise toward anger.</p>

  <p>"You know," said Cobalt. "You're a little sassy, but I don't mind it. It's
  spice in you."</p>

  <p>"Thank you."</p>

  <p>"You're proud, too," said Cobalt. "You're proud as Lucifer. I can see
  that."</p>

  <p>"Do you always talk to people like this?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Of course, I do. How else should I talk to them?" stated Cobalt.</p>

  <p>He meant that. He always said what he thought, straight out. Often it was
  a shocking thing to hear him, a brutal thing. That was why so many people
  savored respect for Cobalt with a good dash, not of envy, but of hate. Only a
  few of us endured and loved him in spite of the way he trod on our toes.</p>

  <p>"Almost any other way," said the girl. "Almost any other way, I should
  think."</p>

  <p>"You tell me how."</p>

  <p>"Why, make them happy, of course. That's what most people try to do when
  they're talking to others."</p>

  <p>"No," said Cobalt, "that's not right."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think so?" questioned Sylvia, beginning to smile and
  freeze.</p>

  <p>"No," said Cobalt, "because mostly people are lying, and the ones they
  talk to know they're lying."</p>

  <p>"Ah, and you always tell the truth?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody could always tell the truth," he replied, "but I try my best to do
  it."</p>

  <p>"I must have read that somewhere," said Sylvia. "Where did you get it,
  Cobalt?"</p>

  <p>"Out of my heart," he said, as grave as you please, and pointed at his
  breast, as though she could look through bones and flesh if she chose.
  "You'll find a lot more in there."</p>

  <p>"I only see a parka," said Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"There you go again," said Cobalt, "but, when you're sassy like this, you
  ought always to laugh."</p>

  <p>"Ought I?" she asked, lifting her brows to freeze him again.</p>

  <p>But Cobalt didn't freeze. No, no, you might as well have tried to frost
  the equator.</p>

  <p>"You ought to laugh and show that you're joking," Cobalt told her,
  "because, if you're serious, you simply need a spanking."</p>

  <p>"You make me feel very young," said Sylvia, letting the temperature drop
  another hundred degrees toward absolute zero.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't stick up your nose and look down at me. It doesn't amuse me
  when I see you acting like that. You've learned that attitude out of your
  mirror, I suppose, but don't use it on me. Don't talk down to me because,
  after all, you're only a woman."</p>

  <p>"I'm <i>only a what?</i>"</p>

  <p>"You're so mad now that you can hardly hear me," went on Cobalt. "Get the
  cobwebs out of your mind and listen to the truth. I said that you're only a
  woman and, therefore, you've no right to look down your nose at anybody."</p>

  <p>Sylvia must have nearly fainted. I know how other men were in front of her
  like lambs, like poor willing slaves, cluttering up the heavenly ground on
  which she deigned to put her feet.</p>

  <p>"I see that you're a profound fellow," Sylvia said to him. "You can see at
  a glance that I'm only a woman. What did you expect to find me?"</p>

  <p>"I expected to find you a good deal better than you are," he said. "I saw
  only the shine of you from a distance. Now that I get up close, I see that
  the wick needs a lot of trimming."</p>

  <p>"You men," Sylvia said as sardonic as you please, "are such masters. Of
  course, women always look up to such wonderful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't do that," urged Cobalt. "If you talk like that, I'll begin to
  despise you so much that I'll never look at you again. There's not much to
  women, you know. There's almost nothing&mdash;except loving 'em."</p>

  <p>"True," said Sylvia, beginning to shake a little in the fury that was
  gripping her. "Of course, we're just mirrors, and nothing else. Mirrors for
  the parents, then for the great husband, then for the children. Is that
  it?"</p>

  <p>"You mighty well know it's true," said Cobalt, "though, just now, I see
  that you're ready to scratch my eyes out."</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I was only about to remark that my time is not entirely my
  own."</p>

  <p>"No," said Cobalt, "that's true. A good part of it is mine."</p>

  <p>"Ah?" said Sylvia, blinking a little, beginning to think him mad.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is. One of these days, Sylvia, if you turn out to be half
  what I think of you, I'm going to marry you."</p>

  <p>"I'm astonished and delighted," she said, forcing herself to smile at him
  again in such a way that any other man would have backed up as if from a
  tiger's claws. "Are you really going to marry me, Cobalt&mdash;I don't know
  any other name to give you, you know."</p>

  <p>He merely grinned at her. "You handle a whip pretty well, but you can't
  cut me through the skin with your little turns and flips of the tongue. It
  won't do any good to flog me with ironies, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"As if I would attempt such a thing! Of course, I don't know what you
  mean, Cobalt, but then a woman never understands more than a part of what a
  man says. She only sees the feet of the god, I dare say."</p>

  <p>"You've got a lot of stuff in you, but you need to be taken apart and put
  together again."</p>

  <p>"Poor Dad. He'll be terribly upset when he hears that I have to be brought
  up all over again."</p>

  <p>"I like you better and better." Cobalt was grinning again.</p>

  <p>"Oh, how can you!" exclaimed Sylvia, putting her two little hands together
  in admiration.</p>

  <p>"Dog-gone you're a feast for me. I could spend my life eating you, sauce
  and all, and spite, and malice, and thorny ironies, and all of that. Now
  let's get down to brass tacks."</p>

  <p>"You mean, to name the wedding day?"</p>

  <p>"That's the main idea. Your father says that your husband ought to have a
  home for you and a hundred thousand dollars. Now, what do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I only want a great, big, wonderful, masterful man."</p>

  <p>"You're going to be mastered, all right," said Cobalt. "Is that all you
  want?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. Just somebody I can look up to."</p>

  <p>"You can look up to me, Sylvia. You can stand on your tiptoes, and still
  you'll have to look up."</p>

  <p>She teetered up on her toes. "My gracious, you're right. I dare say that
  you're always right!"</p>

  <p>"I'll have a hundred per cent average with you."</p>

  <p>"Then I suppose that we'll have to be married at once. I can hardly wait
  and, of course, you have the lovely home and the hundred thousand waiting for
  us?"</p>

  <p>"You she-wolf!" replied Cobalt, his grin flashing down at her. "I have a
  dog team, some dried fish, and my two hands. I'm going to rip that hundred
  thousand out of the ground this year."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Cobalt," she asked, "do we have to wait a whole year?"</p>

  <p>She made sad eyes at him. Cobalt drank it all in.</p>

  <p>"What kind of a house do you want?" he asked her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, for myself, just anything would do, but I'd never be happy unless I
  knew that my husband had the right surroundings. I wouldn't set a diamond in
  base metal. There'd have to be a night park for him to walk in when he's in
  the garden in the evening with his own thoughts. A good library for his
  study. Or do you need to study any more, Cobalt?"</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Cobalt. "You write down the items, and I'll add up."</p>

  <p>"Then you'd want two or three good servants to look after you properly,
  and a maid to dress me because I'd have to appear as well as possible in the
  eyes of such a husband. We'd need rooms for those servants, of course, and a
  good dining room because a little dining room is so stuffy and lacks
  dignity."</p>

  <p>"Go on."</p>

  <p>"Well, you can fill out the rest a great deal better than I can. The
  stables, the horses and such things&mdash;you would know exactly what to
  have. You'd need more, but three or four good hunters are about all that I
  would have, unless you wished to be too generous. But for myself I wouldn't
  want jewels."</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, nothing to speak of. Just a few nice, big, simple stones. Not
  emeralds. Oh, no! They're too expensive. I like rubies better myself. Just a
  few to help me catch your eye when you're losing yourself in meditations, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Now I begin to see the picture."</p>

  <p>"Of course you do," said Sylvia, giving him a smile of childish adoration.
  "I shouldn't have said a thing. You would have known from the first, ever so
  much better than I do."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Cobalt, "what do you think?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I wouldn't try. I'd just leave all of that to you, dear! I know it
  won't take you long to make enough."</p>

  <p>"Not long at all. Good bye for a little while, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>He held out his arms to her. And she? Why, she stepped right inside them
  and let him kiss her. Then she followed him to the door and told him that she
  could hardly wait. That's the sort of stuff of which she was made.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. THE LIGHTNING WARRIOR</h2>

  <p class="first">Cobalt went down to the saloon and staked his dog team
  against six hundred dollars as a start. Before the next morning, he had won
  forty thousand dollars. He took a week spending that money. None of it went
  in dissipation. Everything was sunk in the preparation to get more gold out
  of the earth. Then he disappeared from Circle City and went to the
  diggings.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew about that conversation he had had with Sylvia Baird. That
  talk was so typical of Cobalt that people could not help repeating the
  details of it and laughing heartily. They even asked Sylvia about it, and
  Sylvia would laugh in turn. But Circle City stopping laughing, and so did
  Sylvia Baird, when it was learned that Cobalt was organizing his expedition
  and hiring many hands. Circle City stopped smiling because it very well knew
  that, when Cobalt bent his energies in any direction, the time for foolish
  comment had ended. I think that Sylvia began to worry almost at once.</p>

  <p>I saw her shortly after Cobalt went into the wilderness, and I chatted
  with her a little about Cobalt. Her way of putting the thing was
  characteristic.</p>

  <p>"I hear that Cobalt is a great friend of yours," I said.</p>

  <p>"Friend?" replied Sylvia. "Oh, not at all. I've only met him once, you
  know. Yet he means a good deal to me."</p>

  <p>"Does he?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Because he's going to marry me it appears."</p>

  <p>"Great Scott! That's exciting!"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it?"</p>

  <p>She joked about it so openly that everyone could speak of it freely, but
  all the while she was uneasy. I could see that because I had come to know her
  very well.</p>

  <p>"Suppose," she said one day, "that Cobalt should come back from the mines
  with a fortune and hold me to my joke?"</p>

  <p>"Then he would have a chance to do the laughing," I said.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious?" I replied.</p>

  <p>"I'm frightened, a little. For once he gets a thing into his
  head&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was one comfort, and that lay in the reports that came back to us.
  Cobalt and his crew were tearing up the ground and getting hardly a taste of
  color. In the meantime Circle City had something that drowned out even Cobalt
  as a topic of interest, and that was the appearance of a white wolf the
  Indians were said to have named the Lightning Warrior for so swiftly did he
  attack and parry. Having seen him, I can give an authentic account of his
  looks. He was closer to a bear in bulk than to a wolf. Those who know wolves
  realize that it is a goodish-size beast that has a footprint four inches
  across. When it is a giant, it has a spread of five inches. There have been
  some half fabulous reports from time to time of wolves with paws of more than
  five inches' measurement; but the Lightning Warrior of Circle City marked out
  a six-inch circle as he put down his paw. This I know because I measured the
  thing myself, not once but twenty times.</p>

  <p>A wolf which makes a four-inch track is big enough to cause plenty of
  trouble. Swell the beast to the dimensions of the Lightning Warrior and the
  dangerous possibilities are multiplied by ten. When I saw that fellow
  standing in front of a wall of brush, with the wind ruffling his mane, he
  looked to me like the god of wolves. His whiteness was the amazing thing, the
  incredible thing. He shone as snow shines. His eyes and his tongue were
  bloodstains in the fluffing radiance. One hears of white wolves very often,
  but usually they are the color of coffee and milk or simply a dirty yellow,
  but this lord of wolves was entirely and purely white.</p>

  <p>He called himself forcibly to the attention of Circle City and, having
  stepped to the center of the stage, he remained there. He turned himself into
  a frightful plague through his appetite which was for dogs. He would eat
  anything with no more conscience than fire, but his regular diet was dogs.
  Even for wolves a diet of Eskimo Huskies seems rather tough, for Huskies are
  themselves nine-tenths wolf. In the dog teams working from Circle City, there
  were more than a few pure-blood wolves pulling at the lines. However, the
  Lightning Warrior did not spare them. Anything which had been tainted by the
  hand of man was especially delightful to him. He cared not so long as the
  animal was large enough to make him a few mouthfuls.</p>

  <p>There were in Circle City some Mackenzie Huskies that were twice the size
  of the average wolf and that were twice as hardy as well, for they were kept
  in the pink of condition by hard labor and spare feeding. A Mackenzie Husky
  will hamstring a horse or a cow as neatly as ever a wolf could do the same
  job. A Mackenzie Husky fights like a wolf, fencing for an opening, cutting
  and slashing as with a saber. Nevertheless, Joe Frazer saw two Huskies of the
  biggest type, weighing well over a hundred and fifty pounds apiece,
  slaughtered by that white plague, the Lightning Warrior.</p>

  <p>At the time, Joe carried no gun. He could merely shout and run toward the
  fight from a distance, but long before he arrived the throats of the two dogs
  were cut. Joe said that the wolf seemed twice the size of the dogs. We knew
  this could not be. I suppose it was action which magnified the apparent size
  of the monster, that and the results of his daring play. He fought right on
  until Joe Frazer was almost on the spot. Then the Lightning Warrior gave the
  <i>coup de grâce</i> to the second of the Huskies, standing with a forepaw on
  each of the dead bodies and defying Joe with a look to come on.</p>

  <p>Joe was not a fool. When he saw the silent snarl of that brute, he started
  backing up, and the infernal creature at once came stalking after him,
  sliding along on its stomach. Joe had only a hunting knife. He drew this out,
  but he said he would just as soon have faced a lion, armed with a stiletto,
  as to face that white beast with a mere hunting knife in his hand. He began
  to shout. Every time he yelled, the wolf paused a little and looked off at
  Joe's house in the distance.</p>

  <p>Finally, the shouts of Joe got to the ear of Jim Bridger, who was Joe's
  partner, and Bridger came running out with a rifle in his hands. When the
  Lightning Warrior saw the rifle, he turned and went for distance and more
  air. Joe Frazer said that the animal started so fast and worked so hard to
  get into the middle of the horizon that he left a moan of effort in the air
  behind him. Certainly he faded out so fast that Bridger could not even
  attempt to shoot. At any rate Bridger was a strange fellow, and he did not
  shoot on principle. I heard him talk the thing over with Joe Frazer.</p>

  <p>"You might have winged him," Frazer insisted.</p>

  <p>Bridger answered: "Nothing told me to shoot at him."</p>

  <p>"Nothing told you?" shouted Frazer. "Wasn't I there howling my head off to
  make you shoot at that white lump of murder?"</p>

  <p>"No voice inside of me told me to shoot," said Bridger. "There's no good
  in taking a crack at any wolf unless you've got guidance."</p>

  <p>"You talk like a crazy man," said Frazer.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Bridger was a little touched on the subject, but he remained as
  sober as you please and swore that nobody in Circle City would get a bullet
  into the Lightning Warrior until it pleased the beast to permit the shooting.
  People laughed at Bridger, and very rightly after he had said this. When
  Bridger saw people laugh, he grew hot with anger. He actually made a standing
  bet that nobody in Circle City would shoot or trap the Lightning Warrior. He
  bet a hundred ounces of gold dust on the proposition.</p>

  <p>A hundred ounces, at seventeen dollars an ounce, made pretty good pay for
  a small job. When people heard that Bridger was in earnest and actually had
  put up the sack at the saloon, they started to work their heads off to get
  that wolf. For a few days they burned up ammunition, but none of the bullets
  grazed the Lightning Warrior. Bridger used to hear the stories with a faint
  sneer.</p>

  <p>"None of you will ever get him," he swore.</p>

  <p>He began to grow complacent. I think that the wolf had been half a joke to
  him at the first, but now it more than justified all that he ever had claimed
  for it. So Bridger erected the thing into a mystery. He no longer smiled when
  the Lightning Warrior was mentioned, but he would put on a profound and
  understanding air and shake his head a few times, and he was apt to leave the
  room if people persisted in the subject. Then came the Morrissey affair, and
  after that the subject of the wolf was taboo with everyone.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; TRAILED BY A GHOST</h2>

  <p class="first">Morrissey, a big, powerful Irishman, had gone out from
  Circle City with a string of eight dogs, practically a double freight team.
  The Lightning Warrior went with him. He ate dogs one by one, killing them in
  the night. At last, Morrissey slept with the remaining in a huddle about him,
  the four wedging closely together. He did not need to tell them why he wanted
  them there. They seemed to know. The dread of the monster was in the air, and
  they had breathed it.</p>

  <p>A dog was killed that very night. Poor Morrissey heard the crunching of
  its neck bones under the teeth of the beast as he awakened from a sound sleep
  and saw the Lightning Warrior go off, bearing the body of the Husky trailing
  from his jaws. After that Morrissey tried to keep awake all the way back to
  Circle City, but he was eight days out and, of course, he failed. He dropped
  all but one sled, and he put out at full speed with his remaining three dogs.
  Two days later, he dropped into a brief slumber after a halt. He was wakened
  by a wild outburst and saw his three dogs banded valiantly together, facing
  the white killer. They might as well have tried to escape from death itself.
  The Lightning Warrior stopped playing when he saw the man waken. He broke the
  neck of the leader and, when the other dogs backed away, the wolf went off
  with its profits. This all had happened far too rapidly for Morrissey to
  intervene.</p>

  <p>A day or two later, the Lightning Warrior no longer kept out of sight. He
  was always to the right and a little ahead of the sled team. He seemed to
  poor Morrissey as big as a lion, and a thousand times more diabolical. As
  Morrissey was staggering along, half dead for the lack of sleep, that
  infernal brute ran in and killed his seventh victim right under the eyes of
  the driver! Then Morrissey had only one dog, and he lightened the sled to
  skeleton proportions and made the burst of the last two days toward Circle
  City.</p>

  <p>The first day the last remaining sled dog was struck down by the white
  lightning. On the final march which he made without a pack of any kind, with
  nothing to eat except a few tea leaves to crumble between his teeth, that
  fiend of a Lightning Warrior followed him closely, followed him with an
  increasing interest, until Morrissey felt sure that the diet list of the
  Lightning Warrior would be soon varied with flesh other than that of dogs. He
  managed to keep his eyes open but, when he pushed open the door of the saloon
  and staggered in among us, I can assure you that Morrissey was a very
  sick-looking man.</p>

  <p>He was white and shaking, and he poured off three shots of that stifling
  whiskey, one after the other. Somebody asked Morrissey why he was so pale,
  and Morrissey asked the other how he would look if he had been jogging across
  country with a demon to dog his steps? Morrissey went quite out of his head
  when he talked about it. It was a month before he was sound mentally, and we
  used to have to sit and listen to him raving in the wildest way.</p>

  <p>Poor Morrissey! He recovered his mental balance, finally, but he had been
  very hard hit. From being the most openhearted, cheerful fellow imaginable,
  he became sullen and morose nor would he have anything to do with his oldest
  friends. After the Morrissey business, the hunting of the white plague became
  a passion with everyone. The town combined. Rifles, poison, traps of all
  kinds, lures and baits of all descriptions were employed. The townsmen worked
  together. I helped during the hunting on many a bitter day and night.</p>

  <p>This whole episode made a terrific impression upon all of us in Circle
  City. Men had carried weapons before in the hope of getting a chance at the
  Lightning Warrior and the hundred ounces. Now, when we went armed, I think
  that none of us really wanted to encounter the brute, no matter how good the
  light for shooting. I won't go so far as to say that a single wolf had
  terrorized the entire community, but it was something very akin to a panic
  that gripped the men of the town. I can look back clearly to my own emotions
  of the moment and remember that the last thing I wanted was an opportunity to
  win the hundred ounces of the reward.</p>

  <p>If it had not been for the Lightning Warrior, we would have talked about
  nothing but Cobalt and Sylvia Baird until the following season, but the
  Lightning Warrior first divided our attention, and then he practically
  monopolized it. We had to rub our eyes when Cobalt suddenly turned up one day
  with five of his crew at his side. He had brought twelve hundred pounds of
  nuggets and dust from the diggings!</p>

  <p>The few of us who were not at the mines at the moment went half mad when
  we heard of this bonanza. Cobalt gave up his claims now that he had his
  money. He said that three mule packs of gold dust were enough for any man,
  and I suppose that he was right. At any rate other people went out to work on
  the very spot where Cobalt had found his fortune, and they collected exactly
  nothing at all. It had been more luck than skill. He had struck some rich
  pockets. When they were emptied, there was little more than a trace of the
  right color remaining.</p>

  <p>One can imagine the excitement in Circle City now. For here was Cobalt
  back among us, his pockets filled with gold. Yonder was lovely Sylvia Baird
  who had told him, in jest or in madness, that she would marry him when he
  could give her certain things. To be sure, he was not rich now, but he had
  enough assured him to make certain of a pleasant home.</p>

  <p>I remember that we looked upon Cobalt with a gasp of new surprise. We
  talked the matter over among us, and we decided that, if the girl had asked
  for a crown of diamonds, Cobalt would have ripped open the earth with his
  bare hands until he found it. We had faith in him before. We had an infinite
  faith in him now.</p>

  <p>He spent two days in resting, that is to say in drinking! The two terms
  were synonymous with Cobalt as with most of the other miners, but he had a
  head of well riveted armor-plate, and there was no addling him with alcohol.
  At the end of the two days he went to call on Sylvia Baird.</p>

  <p>She was ready for him. At least she was as well prepared as a human being
  can be before meeting a giant like Cobalt. She told him how wonderful he was.
  When he named the weight of the dust he had brought in from the mines, she
  considered it and decided that the income from such a sum, well invested,
  would just about do to house her wonderful husband properly.</p>

  <p>On this day snow was falling. The flakes whirled with a stifling thickness
  outside the window, and it seemed that the world had been clapped into a
  flour sack and well shaken with the dust. Sylvia kept poking at the window
  and scratching designs on it. Cobalt sat in the opposite corner of the room
  and watched her like a wolf. He knew perfectly well what she was thinking,
  and she knew that he knew. Their conversations were the oddest games in the
  world.</p>

  <p>For instance, when her father came in, Sylvia said: "Look, look, Father!
  Here's Cobalt back from the mines and quite a rich man now. Have you met my
  father, Cobalt? Oh, yes, on the day you asked him if you could marry me. Sit
  down, Father, and talk to Cobalt a little and feast your eyes on him. He's
  looking a little thinner, don't you think, the poor dear! You've had some
  frostbite in that poor red nose of yours, Cobalt."</p>

  <p>Henry Baird tried to break through the air of banter and mockery between
  that pair. "Look here, Sylvia," he said, "I want to know how seriously you
  are taking this whole affair?"</p>

  <p>"Seriously?" cried Sylvia. "Good heavens, Father, of course I can't be
  anything but serious. Not considering the opportunity that's been cast in my
  path. Father, you don't suppose&mdash;oh, this will amuse Circle City. This
  will fairly dissolve Cobalt with laughter&mdash;to think that any woman could
  even dream for a single moment of refusing to marry him!"</p>

  <p>Cobalt stuck out his jaw more than a trifle, but he did not answer this
  scoffer. Henry Baird looked sharply at the younger man.</p>

  <p>"Cobalt," he said, "is this a game with you, too? Or are you really
  serious?"</p>

  <p>"Mister Baird," Cobalt stated, "I'm going to play it the way she wants. If
  she wants to laugh at me, she can keep right on laughing up the steps to the
  altar because that's where I'll lead her one of these days."</p>

  <p>"Of course you will," said that little imp of a Sylvia. "Of course, you'll
  lead me to the altar, if you want to. Oh, Cobalt, when I think of the number
  of girls whose hearts will break that day. When you think of it, Cobalt, how
  can you be so cruel to them all? Oh, the poor things! They can't help loving
  you, Cobalt. They can't help it any more than I can help it. You ought to
  know that."</p>

  <p>"Go on. Go right on, Sylvia," said Cobalt. "I like the taste of you today
  better than ever. I like to sit down and close my eyes and just listen and
  pretend to myself that you're a man, after all, and big enough for me to put
  my hands on you."</p>

  <p>"That's what I call real love, Father," commented the girl. "He cares for
  me so much that sometimes he thinks I'm as important as a man. Oh, Cobalt,
  what a delightful flatterer you are. Did you ever hear anything like it,
  Father?"</p>

  <p>"I never heard anything like you, Sylvia," replied her father sternly.</p>

  <p>"It's Cobalt who inspires me," said Sylvia. "You can't expect me to remain
  ordinary when such a man as Cobalt has noticed me. You can't expect that, can
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Sylvia," returned her father, "you ought to be whipped and put to bed
  without supper. Cobalt, I don't know exactly your attitude, but I'm ashamed
  of the way Sylvia is acting."</p>

  <p>"Yeah," agreed Cobalt, "she's acting, all right, but one of these days
  she'll find that I'm up there on the stage with her and signed for life in
  the same company. That's what I'm waiting for. Sylvia, what do you want for
  an engagement ring?"</p>

  <p>She held out one of her lovely hands. "I never wear rings, my dear," she
  said, "but I'll tell you what I'd simply adore."</p>

  <p>"Tell me then," said Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"I'd be charmed to have the skin of the Lightning Warrior, Cobalt, without
  the marks of trap teeth, or knife, or bullet on any part of him," stated the
  girl.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; STALKING</h2>

  <p class="first">Some imp must have stolen into the mind of Sylvia.
  Otherwise, she never could have conceived such an idea. To capture the
  Lightning Warrior was almost fabulously difficult. The best hunters and
  trappers of Circle City, where all men could hunt and trap a little, had
  tried in vain, tempted by that offer of the two thousand dollar reward. But,
  to capture him without either traps or bullets or knives, this was
  preposterous!</p>

  <p>Cobalt, as he listened to her, watched her deep blue eyes intently. He
  stood there like a stone, staring, while Baird was saying: "That's a foolish
  remark, Sylvia. As if a man could go out into the wilderness and capture the
  white beast bare-handed!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Father," said Sylvia, clasping her hands together in mock admiration
  of Cobalt, "you don't know what he can do. He himself hardly knows. No other
  man can match the things that he does. Do you think that he will shrink from
  a little thing like this?"</p>

  <p>Cobalt asked: "Is that the price mark on the tag?"</p>

  <p>She half closed her eyes. I imagine she was thinking fast and hard, and
  there was no doubting the direction of his last remark. Everything had been a
  jest. Even the ripping of that fortune out of the earth was a part of the
  joke. This was different. If he went out with his bare hands to do this
  marvel, their mutual jest would have drawn to an end. She did not answer the
  last remark directly, therefore, but merely said: "I've always wanted a big
  white fur."</p>

  <p>So Cobalt said good bye and left her the second time and heard her father
  saying angrily that she should not press a jest as far as this. It was a
  joke, but Cobalt intended to turn it into earnest. That same day he went out
  from Circle City with his dog team, his half-wild string of savage brutes,
  and traveled up the Yukon slowly. His load was chiefly dried fish for his
  team, and the goal of his journey was the Lightning Warrior. The dogs were
  bait. The weapon and the trap consisted merely in a strong rope.</p>

  <p>He was no expert with a lariat, so he practiced on the way, making a
  thousand casts a day to get the hang of the thing. Suppose that he managed to
  get the rope over the head of the brute, how would he proceed? His hands
  would have to be the clubs that beat it senseless. Or did he even think of
  what he would do when the crisis came? Perhaps not. His was a simple plan. To
  the execution of it, he would trust patience and his superhuman power of arm
  and body.</p>

  <p>On the second day he saw the Lightning Warrior, the first time his eyes
  had rested on the beast. He had trusted that his team would be followed as
  Morrissey's was followed. He was right. When he saw the big silhouette of the
  monster, standing on a white hummock against the sky, the old superstition
  thrust into his mind that this might be a man-wolf, a <i>loup-garou</i>.</p>

  <p>The brute seemed to know perfectly that the man carried no gun. He stood
  there on the top of the hummock and allowed the dog team to pass him at a
  distance of fifty feet.</p>

  <p>That savage team should have become wildly excited at the sight of the
  wolf. They should have tried with all their might to get at him. Instead,
  they hung their heads and seemed oppressed with fear. Cobalt stopped them and
  went out with his rope toward the brute that remained on the hummock. When he
  was six strides from him, he yawned at Cobalt like a cat, showing his red
  gullet and the teeth gleaming like pearls. Then he bounded to the side and
  was gone into a thicket.</p>

  <p>Even Cobalt's heart beat fast, and he hesitated before entering the
  underbrush. But enter it he did. He walked cautiously. He was an excellent
  woodsman, and he knew how to step so that his feet made no noise that a human
  ear at least could hear. Before he had gone ten paces, he heard the terrified
  yelling of his team and rushed back to see what had happened. It was the
  Lightning Warrior that had happened. He had come out of the shrubbery and,
  giving his shoulder to the leader, had killed that dog with a single slash
  across its throat. Now the team cowered together. They did not seem to have
  offered the slightest resistance to the white thunderbolt which now sat at a
  little distance and licked the blood from his snowy breast and from his
  forelegs.</p>

  <p>He went on about his toilet with the most perfect care and indifference to
  the man approaching him. This time Cobalt determined to try a long cast. When
  he came within six steps, the beast yawned at him in the same horrible
  manner. That instant Cobalt made his cast. He flung with an underhand motion,
  which is the Mexican way, and the swiftest of all. The coil went out like a
  serpent striking, but it missed the Lightning Warrior. He had not leaped back
  or to the side. He simply jumped in, so that the rope flew over his head. As
  the lariat fell, Cobalt found himself unarmed, empty handed, with that
  massive killer crouching at his feet for the spring. What other man would
  have done what he did? He stepped straight forward, and the Lightning Warrior
  bounded lightly to the side. He approached again, and the snowy murderer
  fairly turned tail and fled across the wastes. The dog team saw him go,
  picked up heart, and sang a chorus of tardy defiance.</p>

  <p>Then Cobalt went back and sat down on his sled for a time. He was not
  feeling well. His hands were a trifle uncertain, and there was a slight sense
  of numbness about his knees. While he sat there, thinking of what he was
  attempting, he told himself that he was a fool. He thought back to Sylvia
  also.</p>

  <p>It was not only her beauty that drove him. It was also the memory of her
  dainty voice and her softly sneering ironies. Perhaps she was back there in
  Circle City, laughing at the idiot who had gone out into the wilderness
  because she chose to make a joke of him! But it was her wickedness which
  flavored her beauty. There was no other person like her. She stood apart from
  all the rest.</p>

  <p>After he had thought of her for a time, his strength and courage revived.
  He stood up, cut the dead leader from the harness, and drove on slowly. He
  knew that he was beginning a long duel. He was not prepared, however, for the
  full weight of the disaster which overtook him. His own relentless
  determination drove him on to court it.</p>

  <p>Two days out from Circle City, he had already lost a dog. Ten days later,
  his last one was gone. He was mushing ahead alone, pulling the sled with
  patient strength. Still the Lightning Warrior was following him! Just as he
  had followed Morrissey and almost destroyed the man on the verge of Circle
  City, so now he followed Cobalt. When his face was toward him, the beast
  dared not attack Cobalt.</p>

  <p>On the first day he had established a moral superiority, and the balance
  never shifted against him. But the danger would not come from the front. He
  would attack him from either side or, most probably, from the rear. If Cobalt
  could defend his back, his face was safe.</p>

  <p>Once, very tired, cold from a ripping wind, he built his fire and had it
  flaming when a sudden cramp of terror gripped the small of his back. He had
  heard, and he had seen, nothing of the Lightning Warrior all that day but,
  twitching around suddenly, he saw the monster in the act of leaping. Cobalt
  side-stepped. The big wolf twisted in the air and, striking the snow well
  beyond the fire, he was instantly gone among the brush again. That was a
  lesson for Cobalt.</p>

  <p>From that moment he lived as though he were surrounded by hostile Indians.
  One instant of lack of precaution and the teeth would be in his throat, and
  the beast would be drinking his blood. He kept to the woods most of the time.
  They were tenfold more perilous, in that they offered a chance for stalking
  to that werewolf. At the same time they might give him more chances to use
  the rope. In fact, in six weeks he cast the rope three times, including the
  first failure. Once the edge of the coil struck the monster between the eyes.
  But that was the closest Cobalt came to success.</p>

  <p>He decided that the rope was too light. It had to be heavier so that it
  could be thrown with speed, like a flexible metal cable. So he worked in
  strips of rawhide until the weight of the noose end of the rope was trebled.
  It was now like handling a mass of chain. The noose was stiffened, more
  likely to hold its form. As he practiced with the rope on stones and stumps,
  he told himself that he now had a half chance to succeed when next an
  opportunity came to him.</p>

  <p>For that opportunity he waited on the bank of a small salmon stream. He
  was glad of the fishing. His own supply of provisions was getting very low,
  but he worked at the fishing patiently, cleaned the big salmon, then cured
  them on racks above a fire. He accumulated far more food than he needed,
  because of the pleasure which he took in being merely occupied. The surplus
  he cached as high as practicable in trees.</p>

  <p>So the winter came, the river freezing to a stone. Still he waited there
  on the bank, and still the Lightning Warrior never left him! Once, before the
  long winter night began, in the dusk of the year, he had a sight of the
  <i>loup-garou</i>hunting. The thing amazed him and filled his mind like a
  nightmare for weeks thereafter. He had heard the long, deep hunting cry of
  the Lightning Warrior not far off, flying through the woods. As the noise
  approached very near, he went to see what he could find.</p>

  <p>There in a clearing he found the white monster, stalking in a swift circle
  around one of the biggest lynxes that Cobalt had ever seen. It did not seem
  possible that a wolf could undertake to make a stand against a full-grown
  lynx, with its equipment of needle fangs and knife-like claws. The wolf was
  attacking, but the manner of the attack was strange. There was no sudden rush
  in. The Lightning Warrior circled and circled, keeping just on the horizon of
  the cat's leaping distance. The lynx turned slowly, by jerks, to face the
  danger, always tensed, always ready for the bound whose striking speed must
  make up for its lack of weight. Still the wolf circled until the lynx,
  turning its head, seemed to look for an opportunity to escape. The Lightning
  Warrior, marking that movement, slid in closer. The lynx bristled with head
  close to the ground, ready to spring, but still the wolf was not ready.</p>

  <p>For twenty minutes Cobalt, frozen with interest, watched the drama and
  gradually understood. The wild cat had the fighting power of an explosive,
  but its prodigious frenzy of strength could not endure with patience under
  any strain. Its moment for battle already was passing. Its nerves were
  crumbling. It was ready to flee. It dipped its head and licked at the snow.
  Its tufted ears flickered. Suddenly the Lightning Warrior struck. He had been
  going on his steady round for so long that even the cat who watched the scene
  was totally unprepared, and the big wild cat seemed hypnotized. It appeared
  to Cobalt that the lynx made not a single effort to save itself. The lobo
  simply caught it by the back of the neck and broke the spine.</p>

  <p>Cobalt could remember, with a bitter spirit, how the great beast had
  stalked him and his dog team, day after day, and reaped a red harvest. The
  creature was made of blood lust. Now he stood above the prey for a moment,
  gazing about it, ready to scent any suspicious smells upon the wind. Failing
  in this, he prepared to eat, and this was the moment when Cobalt gathered his
  rope, prepared his noose, and began to slide out from his place of covert to
  make another effort.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; MAN AND BEAST</h2>

  <p class="first">Beasts of prey, if they are wise, eat with the nose upwind,
  so that the invisible telegraph of the senses will inform them of dangers
  approaching. Their trouble in so doing is that crafty enemies may then stalk
  upwind to approach them. Their rear guard must be simply an occasional glance
  behind them. Beyond this it is their sharp hearing and, beyond all else, the
  aura of nervous apprehension that puts out tentacles to a distance around the
  beasts of prey and the preyed upon.</p>

  <p>Cobalt knew the manners of the wild well enough. He was amazed to see the
  Lightning Warrior reverse the procedure. He actually turned his back upwind,
  letting his nostrils gather their priceless tidings at a distinct
  disadvantage. It seemed that he despised the approach of any open foe. It was
  only the crafty approach from the rear that he wished to guard against.</p>

  <p>The cunning of this procedure was instantly evident to Cobalt. If he came
  out of his covert and went down the wind, the Lightning Warrior was
  reasonably sure to smell him. If he came from the front, the beast was even
  more sure to see him. There was only one course which seemed at all feasible
  to him and that was to come out of covert, as he had done, and stalk toward
  the lobo. The slightest turn of the white brute's head would betray him, of
  course, but Cobalt could not overlook any opportunity, however small. He
  issued from the cover which had shielded him and went up on the quarter of
  the lobo.</p>

  <p>How I wish that I could have been there to see that dead lynx stretched
  out on the snow, still warm and quivering as the wolf devoured the body half
  living and drank the blood, and the man coming from the dark of the trees,
  looking like a hunting animal, also, his eyes burning with the same red
  light. He went with his teeth set and, through them, he breathed out a prayer
  at every step until he found himself within throwing distance. He could not
  believe it. He doubted his luck with a passion of hope. Of what was to come,
  even should he settle the noose on the head of the monster, he did not even
  think, but on he went, a step, another, bringing himself closer to surety in
  the cast, gripping and re-gripping the strands of his rope, wondering if the
  cold would have stuck the noose and kept it from running. Then he saw the
  white killer stiffen suddenly, though its muzzle was still fastened in the
  kill.</p>

  <p>The time had come. Like a flung stone that heavy rope shot straight from
  his hand. The Lightning Warrior, while the flying danger was still in the
  air, was already under way. He would have escaped at the first bound, his
  leap was so sudden and directed so far to the side, but the snow failed to
  hold under him. It had been moistened by the blood of the lynx at this spot.
  It was his own murdering ways that tripped him up, and so the lower rim of
  the noose struck him on the beautiful white fur of his shoulder and the upper
  rim of the noose flicked forward over his head.</p>

  <p>The second bound followed before the man could pull up the rope; but luck
  was against the Lightning Warrior. His second jump merely served to whip the
  noose tight so that it bound his throat with a throttling force. Still in
  mid-air the lunge of his powerful body thrust him against the stiffened rope
  which held him like a rod, the hands of Cobalt holding that rod like iron. I
  wonder what Cobalt felt at that moment when for the first time he achieved,
  not his quest, but an actual contact with the prey for which he had been
  questing so long?</p>

  <p>He shouted, still through his teeth, and the sound of his shout was like
  the whining snarl of the lobo as he tumbled in the snow, snapping at the
  elusive thinness of the rope. Cobalt gave the lariat a little play, enough to
  allow him to throw loops in rapid succession as he ran in, attempting to
  entangle the legs of the brute. But the Lightning Warrior was up in another
  moment and, instead of fleeing, he followed better tactics and drove straight
  at the throat of the man. Cobalt met it as he would have met a charge from
  another man under those circumstances with a hard-driven fist. All that he
  had to aim at was a narrow frame around a vast expanse of red where the teeth
  glistened. He felt them already sinking into the throat at which they were
  aimed. Then he struck, a little to the side of the gaping mouth, a little
  beneath the glimmer of the evil eyes. By the grace of his cool brain and his
  accurate eye, his fist found lodgment at the base of the animal's jaw.</p>

  <p>Even a bull must have gone down when that sledge-hammer stroke fairly met
  the mark. The bull would have gone down stunned. The Lightning Warrior was
  flung backward, head over heels, by the irresistible shock. He tumbled in the
  snow with his four legs, for the moment, thrusting upward.</p>

  <p>Cobalt noosed two of those legs in a flying loop of the rope and, by a
  happy chance, one of them was a foreleg and one a hind leg. Then the
  Lightning Warrior went mad. The two legs which remained untethered were on
  opposite sides of the body and, therefore, the lobo was able at intervals to
  maintain his balance. He began to roll and leap in the snow. He came like an
  otter, wallowing on his stomach like a galloping seal, dashing himself toward
  Cobalt, but the strain of the noose began to choke him. In the wildness of
  the wolf's fury Cobalt heard clearly the snapping of a bone. An instant later
  the Lightning Warrior had partially brained himself against a tree trunk.</p>

  <p>He lay still. A bit of wind got through the trees and fluttered the downy
  white fur, deep and rich, while Cobalt came up slowly and stared down at his
  quarry. He saw the fluff of snow near the nostrils of the brute stirring. By
  that he guessed that the animal still lived. He saw a foreleg crooked in the
  snow. By that he guessed that this was the broken bone. He leaned over and
  laid his hand on the shoulder of the wolf. Under the deep blanket of the fur
  he could feel the muscle, hard as iron and still tensed like strung
  cords.</p>

  <p>Then Cobalt laughed silently. It is a horrible thing to think of that
  silent laughter under the dark of those trees. But he laughed, for in staring
  down at the Lightning Warrior, he had conceived another thought. He started
  to carry out the plan at once. In a sense, I suppose, that a more grotesque
  or brutal plan was never formed. Nevertheless, he went ahead with it. He
  muzzled the beast with a length of the rope. Then he made splints out of
  straight twigs and bound them firmly around the leg, first padding the joints
  with moss as he well knew how to do. The wolf roused up and made one more
  effort to get at Cobalt with his teeth, but found that it was hopeless. So he
  lay with a certain patience. He raised his great, wise head and looked the
  man in the face with an unflinching and deathless hatred and, the man,
  looking up from the splinting of the broken leg, answered that look with a
  sneer.</p>

  <p>When he was ready, he lifted the bulk of the wolf in his arms. He could
  have carried a greater burden, but he was amazed by the bulk of this thing,
  for he knew the limits inside of which a wolf is supposed to range. Then the
  fact that the long-hunted prize was actually in his arms started him laughing
  again. As he laughed, he felt the wolf shuddering with hate against his
  breast, and Cobalt laughed still louder, until the icy corridors of that
  forest rang with his mirth.</p>

  <p>He got the wolf to his camp by the river, and there he nursed him back to
  soundness. He nursed him with the devotion of a priest to a convert or a
  parent to a child. But in all the devotion of Cobalt there was no affection.
  He remembered the dead dogs of his team. They were half-wild beasts, but they
  were his. He had chosen them, trained them. They were his pride, and every
  one of them had come to his hand willingly, without fear.</p>

  <p>When he saw the red eyes of the Lightning Warrior fixed steadily upon him
  with the fire never dying down in them, he would sit for long minutes,
  concentrating his will upon the brute, until at last the animal's eyes could
  endure no longer against that human will, and the lobo would look away. From
  day to day the contest was waged with the same bitterness, until in the end
  the Lightning Warrior knew that he was totally defeated.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE RETURN</h2>

  <p class="first">To describe the hunting of the Lightning Warrior is a simple
  thing, but one has to remember that an entire year was cut out of the life of
  Cobalt. At the end of that time in the warmth of the year, when the sun was
  at its height and the mosquitoes were blackening the flats and the yellow
  Yukon was rolling unbarred by ice toward the sea, Cobalt came back. I had
  come in from the mines on some sort of business, I forget what, and there
  were enough others, what with newcomers and the rest, to fill the saloon when
  Cobalt opened the door and waved to us. He looked about the same, only a
  little blacker of skin from the long, bitter weathering that he had gone
  through. Of course, he was in rags that even an Indian might have scorned,
  but Cobalt often looked like that when he came in from a long trek. He had
  been in our minds for a year and, when he stepped back inside that door, he
  had not been forgotten. It showed the vast force in him that even an arctic
  year of starving, laboring, hoping, groaning had not shut him from our
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>When he opened the door and stepped inside, with the flash of the sun
  behind him, a shout went up. Some people had said that he must be dead, that
  the wolf had got him before this. But to most of us he seemed a deathless
  thing, like a waterfall which may be frozen up for a time but which most of
  the year will be dashing and smashing at the rocks. I remember that there was
  a cheechako at that moment handling the bent iron bar that had been taken
  down from the wall for his curious eyes. In the midst of his futile efforts,
  he saw that ragged man in the door not a very big man, certainly not a
  handsome man yet the cheechako knew when he set eyes upon him.</p>

  <p>"It's Cobalt!" whispered the cheechako, grinning like a happy child and
  straining at the bar.</p>

  <p>Cobalt came with that light step of his, like the step of a man about to
  break into a run, and we surged toward him. But we stopped, like a wave that
  founders on a bar, recoiling suddenly. For behind Cobalt came the Lightning
  Warrior! Yes, striding in like a king, more glorious, more beautiful than
  ever, came the Lightning Warrior, holding his head high as a king ought to
  hold it and making himself blind to the poor, pitiful humans around him whom
  he despised. Mind you, there was no lead rope on him. There was no muzzle on
  him, either. All that he wore in token of being subdued was a pack fitted
  snugly upon his back. The Lightning Warrior was being used as a pack dog! How
  can I put down what I, for one, felt about this thing? It seemed that the
  entire universe had been reversed. For there was the primitive mind of the
  wilderness, the savage hunter, turned into a domestic servant.</p>

  <p>After a moment we began to recover a little at the sight of Cobalt resting
  his heel on the footrail and calling for drinks. He set them up for the
  house, and we took the glasses in forgetful fingers and stared not at the red
  stain in the liquor but at the red stain in the eyes of the wolf. We could
  see him closely enough now to make out the color of the eyes. It was the
  whites of them which were red-stained, but the eyes themselves were blue, a
  pale, clear blue, a strange color to find in the eyes of a wolf, almost as
  strange as the snowy purity of the coat itself.</p>

  <p>"Come up," said Cobalt. "Come up closer, old-timer!"</p>

  <p>He made a quick motion with his hand, and the wolf glided up under it. He
  did not shrink. Neither did he wag his tail nor snarl. Nor did a softer light
  appear in his eyes, but all at once every man in that room knew that the
  beast hated Cobalt with an entire and a deathless hatred. That made the
  miracle complete. There was no muzzle over those teeth which, at a stroke,
  could have cut half through the leg of a man or broken his neck at the nape.
  Yet Cobalt dared to walk freely forward with this menace behind him. Without
  a rope to control him, the Lightning Warrior followed at the heels of his
  master like a dog, though he could have turned and disappeared in a moment in
  the brush, to be free again forever.</p>

  <p>No, it was not the body or the soul of the beast that Cobalt had mastered.
  It was only the brain. He left the body un-crippled and strong. He had not
  overwhelmed the hidden soul of the great animal and won his love. He simply
  had subdued the brain until the monster felt helpless in the grip of his
  master's will.</p>

  <p>How was all this finally accomplished? Cobalt would never say. He could be
  persuaded to say a little about the days when he used to sit and fix his eyes
  upon the wolf, and how they had stared at one another, but there he
  ended.</p>

  <p>I remember how the bartender leaned across the bar, his eyes like two
  moons, and asked: "How did you do it, Cobalt?"</p>

  <p>We all listened, as for the voice of a prophet, but Cobalt simply said:
  "Why, look here, boys, it's not the first time that a man has caught a wild
  wolf and tamed it. And he's tame, isn't he? Look at him. Gentle as a
  lamb."</p>

  <p>Gentle as a chained demon, he should have said. Someone verged too close
  to the brute and got a silent snarl that made him jump ten feet. Yes, the
  Lightning Warrior was gentle to the hand and the will of his master, but in
  reality his very soul was plunged deeper in revolt and rage against all men.
  We thought that we could read one extra page in the story. Beside the right
  eye of Cobalt and running down his cheek, there was a thin red line. It was a
  scar such as a knife stroke might have left. It would whiten in time, but at
  this very moment it looked just like a little stream of fresh blood.</p>

  <p>Yes, other men had caught wild wolves and taken them. They had caught the
  wolves with cunning traps, and they had taken them with a whip. But one
  glance at the face of Cobalt told us other things. We knew, in a flash, that
  his bare hands were the weapons with which he had schooled the beast.</p>

  <p>For my part, as I looked at them, I realized another thing: that there was
  tragedy in the offing. It seemed that Cobalt felt my gaze for presently he
  said to me: "Chalmers, will you walk out with me? I want to talk to you a
  little."</p>

  <p>I went out with him into the arctic sun, which is not like the sun of more
  southerly places. There is always some trace of a dream about it. It is a
  thing seen with the mind rather than something felt by the body, though in
  all conscience I have seen it hot enough even in that Far North.</p>

  <p>We went out, with me stepping rather short and keeping half an eye or more
  upon that white monster. I think he was the most beautiful thing that I had
  ever seen. The whiteness of a polar bear was tawny compared with him, and the
  whiteness of the most brushed and bathed, combed and fluffed lap dog was dull
  compared with the pure brightness of the Lightning Warrior.</p>

  <p>"Now, Chalmers, you're older than I am," said Cobalt, facing about and
  giving me his eye in that direct and almost intolerable fashion of his.</p>

  <p>"I'm a good deal older, as years go, Cobalt," I said.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Cobalt, for he always hated the half
  answers which make up the talk of most of us. "What do you mean by older as
  years go?"</p>

  <p>"I mean," I said, hunting through my mind, "that time is a thin effect
  with a lot of us, thin as arctic sunshine. I've seen men, Cobalt, who can age
  more in a year than others can in ten."</p>

  <p>"Age how?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Ideas, thoughts, accomplishments."</p>

  <p>"And trouble?" he finished off.</p>

  <p>"Yes, trouble," I admitted, uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that I've raised trouble now?" he asked me.</p>

  <p>I hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you know. Everybody knows about it," he said.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that's the chief trouble," I said.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he demanded sharply.</p>

  <p>"Well, you can see for yourself," I responded.</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me what I can see for myself, man," said Cobalt. "Tell me what
  you see."</p>

  <p>I saw that he was under a strain. He was at the breaking point and, if he
  broke, the explosion would shake Circle City.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you something," I parried. "Once when I was a youngster, there
  was a marriage advertised in a side show in a circus. The tallest man in the
  world was to marry the fattest lady in the world. They sold admissions for
  fifty cents. I was only a boy, and I went and saw the marriage."</p>

  <p>"What has that got to do with me?" he asked. "What has that got to do with
  me and&mdash;well, with me and Sylvia Baird?"</p>

  <p>He challenged me with his hard, bright eye, which was turning from gray to
  a pale, luminous blue. I think that the Scandinavian warriors of another age
  must have looked like that when they ran naked into the dance of the swords,
  the banquet of the blades as they used to call it.</p>

  <p>"I mean," I said, "that it was a pretty public thing&mdash;the engagement,
  the marriage, and all in that circus tent."</p>

  <p>He pointed a finger at me like a gun. "You really mean that I've dragged
  Sylvia too much out into the light of publicity."</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "All right! I see what you mean. And what do you
  think? That I'm going to back down?"</p>

  <p>"Back down?" I echoed quite vaguely.</p>

  <p>"You know, throw up the game, just because she's a little sensitive?" He
  tried to smile. It was only a grimace. Then he broke out: "You come along
  with me to the Baird house, will you? I want to talk some more to you."</p>

  <p>I knew that he did not mean that. He wanted me there in the hope that my
  presence would help him to keep from doing some wild, absurd thing. I went,
  unwittingly and very much afraid, at his side up the street.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; STRAIGHT TALK</h2>

  <p class="first">Before we quite came to the Baird house, we could hear
  Sylvia's violin singing and soaring over the voices of a couple of men. When
  she opened the door to us, flushed and happy and smiling, I saw Tom Benton
  and Jay von Acker there in the dimness of the room with her. It was one of
  her favorite amusements. There was mighty little music in Circle City, and
  Sylvia's fiddle accompanied anyone who had enough of a voice to attempt a
  song. She saw me first and gave me her usual smile, behind which I don't
  think there was any real design but which radiated in such a way that,
  wherever she looked, she seemed to have found something that peculiarly and
  particularly pleased her. I was a good deal older than most of the boys who
  flocked around Sylvia, and I should have known better, but now and again she
  pulled at the strings of my heart in such a way that a little pang of
  melancholy pleasure would be stirring within me all the rest of the day.</p>

  <p>That was the smile she gave me and her hand asking me in. Then she saw two
  other things, Cobalt and the Lightning Warrior. She would have fallen, I
  think, or else she would have jumped back into the room. But she got a good
  grip on the edge of the door and held herself in place. I saw the scream come
  into her eyes, swell in her throat, and die out again as she mastered
  herself. All in a moment she was herself again, and actually she went a step
  past the threshold and gave Cobalt her hand. She gave him her smile, too. I
  turned about and saw this. The smile was so perfect that no one except Cobalt
  would have noticed her pallor.</p>

  <p>Then came two yells from inside the house. Benton and von Acker came
  tumbling out to see the great white brute and admire and exclaim over it.
  Cobalt gave them the smallest half of a smile and no answer at all. So they
  pulled in their heads and got themselves off down the street.</p>

  <p>Sylvia gave me an inquiring look, and I saw that she wanted to be alone on
  the field of battle, but Cobalt said: "I asked him to come along because I
  wanted someone to see how you'd get along with the wolf."</p>

  <p>"Why should I get along with the Lightning Warrior?" she asked him. "I
  only wanted his skin."</p>

  <p>"There's his skin on him," said Cobalt, "without the mark of a knife or a
  bullet or the teeth of a trap."</p>

  <p>"Goodness!" Sylvia gasped. "How did you manage to do it? But, of course, I
  knew that you would!"</p>

  <p>"Did you?" answered Cobalt, with a little hard ring in his voice that sent
  tingles up my spine and a weakness down my legs. "Well, there's the skin
  exactly as you asked for it, Sylvia. Chalmers, she wanted the skin of the
  Lightning Warrior instead of an engagement ring&mdash;without a mark or a
  break on it. So you're a witness that she has what she asked for."</p>

  <p>I hated this being used as a witness. He was going to drive her into a
  corner.</p>

  <p>"Do come in, both of you," she said.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't leave the poor old-timer outside, would you?" asked Cobalt,
  patting the head of the wolf.</p>

  <p>She looked at the Lightning Warrior very much as one might look at
  incarnate evil. "Well," she commented, "I suppose you think it's safe to have
  him in the house?"</p>

  <p>"Why isn't it?" asked Cobalt. "Look at this!"</p>

  <p>He spoke and, at his command, that white murderer sat down, lay down, gave
  his paw, fetched the hat which Cobalt threw on the snow, and finally stood up
  on his hind legs, put his forepaws on the shoulders of the man, and looked at
  him with eyes that were on a level. Their faces were not inches apart. I saw
  the Lightning Warrior begin to shake and tremble all over, while his lips
  twitched and blood seemed to flow into his eyes. It was not fear, mind you,
  that made him quiver. It was a frightful desire to have the life blood of the
  man, and that impulse was mastered only by a deep-rooted awe.</p>

  <p>For my own part, I never saw a picture that chilled me more thoroughly.
  Poor Sylvia looked on with a sick face. Cobalt would not say a word about the
  year he had spent in the wilderness, working to get this animal and to subdue
  it so perfectly. Rather he chose this way of giving one an insight into what
  he had accomplished. I stared at the face of the wolf and the face of the
  man, and upon my honor I found them strongly similar, even to the sneering
  expression. The scar stood out on the face of Cobalt like a thin line of
  blood. Sylvia saw all these things with eyes at least as sharp as mine.</p>

  <p>"If he's so gentle as that," she said, "of course he's welcome in the
  house. What a beauty he is!"</p>

  <p>The Lightning Warrior dropped to the ground and followed his master into
  the house. There he backed into a corner of the room where the shadow was
  deepest but through which we still could see the red glint of his eye and the
  strange blue of its iris, like the blue of Cobalt's own eye. We sat down, and
  she offered us tea.</p>

  <p>"I never drink tea when I'm not on the march," said Cobalt.</p>

  <p>We were all silent for a moment. I suppose it was Sylvia's duty to carry
  on the conversation in some way, but she had to pause and gather her strength
  for the trial. Just then Sylvia's father came in. He had already heard about
  the coming of Cobalt, and he was puffing from his rapid walking, returning to
  his home. He gave us both an eager, worried, half-frightened look before he
  shook hands and sat down with us.</p>

  <p>"A marvelous thing, Cobalt," he said. "Extraordinary! I don't see how
  you've accomplished it, and I&mdash;" His voice trailed away. His eyes had
  found the red mark on the face of Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all," said Cobalt. "Sylvia didn't want an engagement ring. She
  wanted the skin of the Lightning Warrior. There it is, you see."</p>

  <p>Baird tried to laugh, but his voice shook a bit. "You have a sense of
  humor, Cobalt," he said.</p>

  <p>"I hope that I have," said Cobalt, "and a memory, too. I try to laugh when
  my turn comes. Did you say there was a joke somewhere in this, Mister
  Baird?"</p>

  <p>"Why, Cobalt," said Baird, "of course you understand, man&mdash;you know
  that a girl&mdash;on one meeting&mdash;you know that a girl couldn't
  possibly&mdash;?" He got altogether stuck.</p>

  <p>Sylvia, leaning a bit forward in her chair, watched the two of them with
  an eager white face. Her hands were clasped hard together in her lap.</p>

  <p>"I see what you mean," said Cobalt, appearing very easy in his manner.
  "Naturally at a first meeting a girl wouldn't send a man off to do a job like
  that unless she was dead serious. No right-minded girl would let him take his
  life in his hands and throw away the best dog team that ever hauled sleds out
  of Circle City and chuck a year of his life into the bargain. Why, Mister
  Baird, you don't suppose that I think Sylvia would take me as lightly as
  that? Or you either, for that matter?"</p>

  <p>Baird got out a handkerchief and mopped his face. "Not lightly, Cobalt,"
  he said with eagerness. "No one would take you lightly. Only, you understand
  that a casual remark in a casual conversation&mdash;you understand that a
  girl might casually say something to which she wouldn't actually wish to
  commit herself."</p>

  <p>"Why, then I'll find out," said Cobalt, cool as could be. "Tell me,
  Sylvia, did you say the thing casually? Did you expect that I would try to do
  what you suggested, or did you not?"</p>

  <p>I never saw grief and ghostly fear more vividly drawn than in the face and
  the staring eyes of poor Sylvia. My heart ached for her, and I wanted to
  break in with a few words, but I could find none. One can't jest with the
  owner about the architecture of his burning house, and one could not be light
  with Cobalt about his year of labor. He had given himself to the utmost.
  Something in the drawn lines of his face showed that. Now what would be his
  reward?</p>

  <p>Perhaps a sheer spirit of perversity had driven him onto the thing, but
  was there some justification, after all? Had he, on the day a year before,
  seen something in the face, heard something serious in the voice of Sylvia
  when she made the proposal about the wolf skin instead of an engagement
  ring?</p>

  <p>"Sylvia!" broke out her father suddenly, "we're waiting for you to speak.
  Were you serious when you spoke to him? Will you answer?"</p>

  <p>She seemed about to speak when her father cut in again:</p>

  <p>"But take your time. Think it over. Remember everything in that
  conversation. I've heard it from you before, but I never guessed that there
  was anything serious in what you and he had said to one another."</p>

  <p>She took a breath, then she said: "You can't help me now, Father. I'm
  thinking back to that day. It was a pretty light conversation, Cobalt, wasn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"As light," said Cobalt, "as eagle feathers. As light as the feathers that
  they put on arrowheads. Isn't that about it?"</p>

  <p>She stared at him. "You mean," she said, "that we both felt seriously
  about what we said?"</p>

  <p>"I mean," he said, "that I asked you to marry me."</p>

  <p>"No," she said, correcting him, "but you did tell me that you were going
  to marry me. There's a difference."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Did you think I was serious?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer for a second or two. My heart counted ten in a roll of
  thunder during the interval.</p>

  <p>Then she replied simply. "Yes, I thought you were serious."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE LOVE COURT</h2>

  <p class="first">Her father got out of his chair with a lurch and a jump,
  like a protesting lawyer at a trial. In a sense, this <i>was</i> a trial,
  with vital issues hanging upon the outcome. "Sylvia," he cried, "think what
  you're saying, will you? Think how you're putting yourself into his
  hands!"</p>

  <p>Then Cobalt said an astounding thing. "No, no, Mister Baird. That's not
  the right angle and that's not the way to look at the thing at all. As a
  matter of fact I don't want to follow my own blind conviction. I want to do
  something with my eyes open and my head up. For my part I'm willing to take
  the opinion of you and Chalmers here to decide the case between me and
  Sylvia."</p>

  <p>I thought Baird would choke, such was the violence of his conflicting
  emotions. He cleared his throat once or twice and then began to blink and
  nod, his colorless brows going up and down, his pink face reddening. "Of
  course, Cobalt," he conceded, "you're a gentleman. Tut, tut, my dear lad, the
  whole north country knows that. There is only one way in which a gentleman
  can act at such a time. Tut, tut, I know all of that beforehand."</p>

  <p>"No, you don't," answered Cobalt, not violently but perfectly matter of
  fact. "You know what I'll do. Nobody else does, because I'm in the dark
  myself."</p>

  <p>This was a considerable conversational snag, and no one could say a thing
  for a moment. It was Sylvia at last who remarked: "Let me try to understand,
  Cobalt. You want to convince yourself that you're right, and then you'll go
  ahead. You want to find out if, in the opinion of Dad and Mister Chalmers, I
  really committed myself. Then, no matter what my own opinion is, you'll go
  ahead?"</p>

  <p>"You can put it that way," said Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to put it that way," she responded. "I want to hear you put
  it in your own words."</p>

  <p>"Words are not what count from my side of the fence. Now then, Chalmers,
  what have you to say about the thing?"</p>

  <p>"How can I say anything, Cobalt?" I asked him. "I don't know what passed
  between you and Sylvia. I only know that of course no man can hold a woman
  against her will to an engagement so&mdash;well, so extraordinary."</p>

  <p>"Do you really think that?" he asked. "Then I've lost before the trial
  begins. Because I want a unanimous vote of yourself and Mister Baird on one
  side or the other as to whether or not you think Sylvia committed
  herself."</p>

  <p>He was wonderfully calm as indeed he remained throughout the interview,
  except for a flush now and again. When I heard these last words of his, you
  may believe that I pricked up my ears again. I saw that this was even a more
  serious matter than it had seemed before far more serious.</p>

  <p>"What happened, exactly, from your own point of view?" asked Baird,
  mopping his face again. For that matter I was getting pretty moist
  myself.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean," said Cobalt, "from the very first?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, tell us that," said the father, nodding and setting his jaw.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I'll tell you&mdash;from my viewpoint," replied Cobalt. "The
  moment I saw her, I wanted her."</p>

  <p>"Say that more clearly," I suggested. "You loved her?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted her," he insisted. "I wanted her the way a boy wants a knife
  that he sees in a window, or a horse in a circus, or an air rifle on a store
  rack. Love her? I don't know. I wanted her. I heard a yegg one day telling
  how he saw an emerald pendant at the throat of a woman. He couldn't get at it
  that night while she was wearing it, but he traced it to the bank vault in
  which it was kept. He blew the vault, sifted through the stuff it contained,
  and got his hands on the emerald. He turned around, and there were five cops
  with a dead bead on him. They sent him up for ten years or so. He got out,
  went back to the same bank, blew another vault, and was caught again. He went
  back to prison a second time for a longer spell. When I saw him, he was a
  gray-headed man. I asked him what had happened to the emerald. He took a
  piece of chamois out of his pocket and unwrapped it, and there was the
  emerald lying in the palm of his hand. He had a peaceful look in spite of his
  years in jail."</p>

  <p>Sylvia, who had been listening with all her heart and soul, asked: "Tell
  me, did you know him well? Or did he just trust you?"</p>

  <p>"He trusted me," said Cobalt. "All men trust me."</p>

  <p>Well, it was rather a grand thing to hear. There was perfect truth in it,
  too. All men trusted Cobalt, even those who wronged him. He might kill them,
  but he never would slander them, try to trick them, or take them from behind.
  He stood up and let the fire shine in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I say that I saw Sylvia, and I wanted her. I tell you just how I wanted
  her. The way that yegg wanted the emerald. The prison meant nothing to him.
  Well, prison would mean nothing to me either, except that there's a slight
  difference. Emeralds don't grow old, women do. I want Sylvia now. I want her
  where I can look at her."</p>

  <p>"When she's happy?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't much care about that," said Cobalt. "Mad or glad or sulking
  or dancing or sorry or jolly, I'd be about equally glad to look at her.
  People spend millions for a picture. Well, there's the picture that I
  want."</p>

  <p>I wondered that he could keep the emotion out of his voice, but he did.
  You might have thought that he was speaking for another person and not
  himself. You may be sure that Sylvia neither smiled nor looked self-conscious
  when she heard those remarks. Rather, she looked as though she were on trial
  for her life. In a sense she was.</p>

  <p>"Then I went to you and told you that I wanted her. I went to her and told
  her I intended to have her," Cobalt went on. "That sounds eccentric. Well, it
  wasn't as eccentric as I may have seemed. I wanted to get her attention from
  the crowd for a minute. So I made a bit of noise and gesticulation&mdash;at
  least I caught her eye. I made her listen. Now, you tell me, Sylvia, when I
  informed you that I intended to marry you, you were angry, weren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was angry," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"But you believed that I seriously intended doing what I said?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she agreed slowly, "I think that I felt that."</p>

  <p>"You only thought so?" he repeated. "You didn't know it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, rather faintly, "I suppose that I knew it."</p>

  <p>"Be honest," he urged.</p>

  <p>"I am honest," she said. She drew back in her chair, seeming to feel that
  the presence of his argument and his questions were hemming her in. Her eyes
  flashed toward her father then toward me.</p>

  <p>"If you're honest," argued Cobalt, "you knew by the way my eyes handled
  your face that I wanted you as desperately as the thief wanted the
  emerald."</p>

  <p>She actually raised her hand and touched her face with a startled and
  pained look. It was a very strange thing to see. "Yes," she said then, "I
  know that you wanted me. No man ever looked at me like that&mdash;as if I
  were not even a human being, not even a dog or a horse, just something to
  look at."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Cobalt, "that's it. Now we're getting along."</p>

  <p>"But what's the direction of all this talk?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said. "I hope that I can give it a direction. Then we
  come to the time when I said good bye to you."</p>

  <p>"You mean that I kissed you good bye?" she said. "That was only a part of
  the ironical game which we were playing. You know that, Cobalt. You wouldn't
  be unfair about that."</p>

  <p>"That kiss? Rot!" he expostulated. "That was nothing. That made no
  difference to me. The touch of the wind would have been as much to me. But it
  gave me a chance to see what your hair was like, and I saw that it was spun
  finer than cobweb. I thought it would be like that, but I couldn't be sure
  until my eyes were close. That finished the picture. I'd seen your hand and
  watched it moving. So that kiss meant a good deal, but not because it was the
  touch of your lips."</p>

  <p>She sighed with relief.</p>

  <p>"Now, man," I said, breaking in because I couldn't stand the tenseness of
  the atmosphere, "tell me what you think, no matter what has gone before, can
  a girl honestly marry a man she doesn't care about? And you don't love him,
  Sylvia?"</p>

  <p>She clasped her hands together and stiffened her arms a little. She closed
  her eyes. "I do not love him," she whispered.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; CAVE MAN STUFF</h2>

  <p class="first">Even as the case stood perhaps Sylvia might have found a
  little less emphatic way of speaking, but I must say that Cobalt did not seem
  in the least shocked. He merely looked at her with greater interest, at the
  repulsion that showed in the faint curl of her lip, at the small hands, the
  loveliest that ever were seen. With an impersonal interest he examined and
  analyzed her.</p>

  <p>"From my point of view, that ends it," I said abruptly.</p>

  <p>"That isn't the point on which I want your view," said Cobalt. "That angle
  doesn't interest me in the least."</p>

  <p>"Great Scott, man," I said, "are you back in the cave age when women were
  chased and captured? Do you mean to say that affection isn't what
  civilization has been built on and&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Civilization! Stuff and nonsense!" replied Cobalt. "I don't give a rap
  about all that rot. Besides, there's the contract marriage of the Greeks and
  Romans. Love had nothing to do with it. They were fairly civilized, I dare
  say. Don't talk rot about civilization to me. Keep to facts. I want her.
  That's the important thing, and I certainly think I have a right to her. I'm
  trying to prove it out of her mouth."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead, then," I said, not at all proud of my last sally.</p>

  <p>The man baffled me. He shamed me a little, too. I had a dawning feeling
  that, perhaps, he might be right a thousand years hence a more cultured race
  might consider women in just such a light.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia," he said, "when I looked at you, you know that you felt no other
  man had looked at you in just the same manner."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said. She was beginning to be frightened. It was
  touching to see her try to stick to the truth in spite of her fear of what
  some admission might do to her.</p>

  <p>"Oh," he said, "other men have looked at you like starved wolves, or like
  sick calves, I dare say. But no man ever looked at you as I did that
  day."</p>

  <p>She nodded, speechless, her eyes haunted. This was not the gay Sylvia,
  bright and impudent as a bird. She raised a hand and pressed a handkerchief
  against her lips. Over this she stared at Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"You felt," he pressed quietly ahead, "that I was in your power?"</p>

  <p>"You?" she exclaimed. "I felt that you were in my power?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;that day," he insisted. Then he raised a finger to caution her.
  "Remember," he said, "the whole truth, and only that."</p>

  <p>"I suppose, in a way&mdash;I suppose that I felt I had some power over
  you."</p>

  <p>"You had a feeling that you could use that power. You thought of the
  Lightning Warrior&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Because of you!" cried the poor girl, and my heart bled for her. "I
  looked at you&mdash;and I don't want to be unkind&mdash;but looking at you
  made me think&mdash;I mean, something about your eyes and your face and the
  wildness of it&mdash;I don't want to say cruel things!" concluded poor
  Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"Come, come," I said, half under my breath. "This is enough, Cobalt?"</p>

  <p>"Enough?" he asked. He turned his head in that quick way of his, and I
  shrank deeper into my chair and wished myself far away. Cobalt then
  proceeded: "When you smiled at my offer of the engagement ring, then the
  thing flashed over you. The sense of your power. The cruel pleasure. You
  thought of the Lightning Warrior, and you asked for his skin."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking!" cried Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"You <i>were</i> thinking," persisted Cobalt gravely. "You thought in this
  manner: this brute of a man with all the strength he seems to have, what
  would become of him, if he were matched with that dog killer, the Lightning
  Warrior? The two pictures jumped into your mind. The thing came out of your
  mouth almost without your thinking. You wanted the fight."</p>

  <p>"No!" cried Sylvia.</p>

  <p>She got up from her chair. So did the three of us.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Cobalt, his voice as always even and quiet, "I can't force
  you to say anything, I can only suggest. When you said it, you had in mind
  storm, wind, starvation, fighting in the wilderness, all that sort of thing.
  Am I wrong?"</p>

  <p>Sylvia looked at her father, then she looked at me hopelessly. Tears began
  to run down her face.</p>

  <p>"That isn't fair," insisted Cobalt. "You've no right to cry to soften
  their hearts. Their hearts are like putty so far as you're concerned."</p>

  <p>"I'm trying not to cry," Sylvia protested. "I don't want to, and I'm
  trying not to." She bit her lip. She dabbed at her eyes. She drew in a
  breath.</p>

  <p>"That's better," said Cobalt in his calm way. "That's more honest. There's
  honesty in you. I'm glad to see that. Now, don't cry any more but tell us the
  truth. When you asked for the skin of the Lightning Warrior, did you or did
  you not think of a long, fierce battle?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," whispered Sylvia, "I did."</p>

  <p>"Sylvia!" interrupted her father, "what are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"And you knew that I would go and do what I could about it?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," she said and halted.</p>

  <p>"Tell us honestly. Did you feel convinced that I would go out and do what
  I could about it?"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't logical," Sylvia confessed with a shaking voice. "I didn't
  follow things to their ultimate conclusion. But&mdash;yes, I thought you
  would do something about it."</p>

  <p>"That meant life or death?" he asked her remorselessly.</p>

  <p>She only stared. He did not insist on the answer.</p>

  <p>"I took it that way," he said. "I jumped into the lion's den, but I'm not
  going to throw the glove into your face now that I'm out again. I'm going to
  hold you to your promise."</p>

  <p>Sylvia, gazing like one enchanted by horror, backed slowly up until her
  shoulders were against the wall.</p>

  <p>"Don't do that, child," cried out Baird. He went over and put an arm
  around her. "I'm going to take care of you," he said. "I won't let anything
  happen to you. Sylvia, look at me. Don't you trust me? I'm not going to let
  anything happen to you!"</p>

  <p>She put a hand up to fend him off. She kept looking in that terrified way
  at Cobalt. "Don't you see it's no good?" she said rapidly to her father. "You
  can't help me. Nobody can help me, only myself. I'm alone with him."</p>

  <p>I tried to help by saying: "There was no <i>real</i> promise, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"Of course, there was no real promise," agreed Baird.</p>

  <p>"Bless you, Chalmers. You help to bring us back to <i>terra
  firma</i>."</p>

  <p>Sylvia shook her head. "Think it over a moment, and then tell me honestly.
  Tell him, and tell me."</p>

  <p>When she said that, I looked toward Cobalt. He did not assume a
  threatening or a blustering attitude. There was no need of that. He had
  folded his arms and leaned a shoulder against the wall. He had finished his
  case, and now he waited for the decision. Realizing that, I cursed the
  unlucky chance that had brought me into the house this day. I cursed Cobalt
  as well in the silence of my mind. Why could not one turn to him and say:
  "Man, you're mad! This thing cannot be!" But there was no use making an
  appeal to him. Public opinion did not matter to Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," said Baird, breaking in. Then he paused, began to shake
  his head, and exclaimed at last: "I don't deny the existence of some
  obligation on your part, some <i>slight</i> obligation."</p>

  <p>"What sort of an obligation?" inquired Sylvia. "That's what I see myself.
  But I'm no good to him in a shop window. Don't you see? He wants me in his
  pocket, as the thief wanted the emerald. Either he takes me as a wife, or
  else I'm no good to him at all. That's the point. If he has a call upon me,
  that's what the call amounts to. I can't be one percent wife or a quarter
  wife, even. I can't be a wife for one day or a week or a month. I've got to
  step over the threshold. That's what I've got to do." Her voice faltered.</p>

  <p>Cobalt said: "You're a good girl, Sylvia. You're such an amazingly good
  girl that I've almost made up my mind to let you get out from the
  contract."</p>

  <p>"There's no contract," cried Baird. "I don't understand what's happened!
  Chalmers, because my girl out of excess of spirits&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>He saw me shaking my head and stopped there. I answered: "Out of excess of
  spirits, or however you want to put it, she challenged Cobalt to do an
  impossible thing. Well, there's the impossible thing accomplished."</p>

  <p>I pointed to the white monster in the corner shadow. Baird, with an
  exclamation, threw up his hands. He was in a state of great excitement.
  Sylvia went to him and put an arm about him and tried to quiet him. It was
  charming to see her forget about her own trouble in her sympathy with
  his.</p>

  <p>"Such a thing would never hold in a court of law! Never in the world"
  insisted Baird. "Any judge or jury would simply laugh at such a claim."</p>

  <p>"Well, Father," said Sylvia, "I suppose that a judge would laugh. But
  we're not judges and juries in a law court, are we?"</p>

  <p>I turned to Cobalt. "Cobalt," I said, "there are a thousand appeals that I
  could make to you. You have some claim, some slight claim on Sylvia. Her
  exquisite sense of honor admits that claim, as you see. But I don't believe
  that you'll take the pound of flesh nearest the heart. I see that you were
  serious, and that you've spent a terrible year in executing your part of the
  bargain. But look at it the other way. If you insist upon the bargain being
  fulfilled, you're wrecking her life. I can't believe that you'll do it. I
  won't believe it. Surrender your claim, Cobalt. You'll have the reward of
  friendship. Out of that friendship something may come&mdash;marriage,
  perhaps, in the end. What would this chains-and-slavery idea of yours amount
  to compared with Sylvia as a wife who loved you and had chosen you?"</p>

  <p>These were not the most eloquent words in the world, but I put a good deal
  of emotion into them because I felt them to the quick. I could see also that
  both Baird and Sylvia thought that this was the final appeal. Baird looked at
  Cobalt with a face of wretched pain and suspense. Sylvia, suddenly weakening,
  was close in her father's arms, her face against his breast.</p>

  <p>How could Cobalt resist the appeal of such a picture? Well, he resisted it
  well enough. In that casual voice which I was beginning to hate he said:
  "Friendship ripening into love, and all that rot, eh? Mutual esteem, followed
  by affection. Is that the new way to sing the old song? Stuff, man, stuff!
  I'm ashamed to hear you say such things. Sylvia, can you turn around and look
  me in the eye?"</p>

  <p>Turn she did and faced him. She rested against Baird for a support. Her
  hands clung to his hands. The unfortunate part of it was that he could not be
  a real help to her.</p>

  <p>"Now you tell me," said Cobalt, "married or unmarried, friends or not
  friends, in a hundred years do you think that you could ever come to love
  me?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him very earnestly. It was a pitiful thing to see her
  honesty and her fear of him fighting in her face. Then she shook her head.
  "No," she said, "I don't think that I could."</p>

  <p>"Well said!" muttered Cobalt. "There's honesty for you. But you see what
  remains? She'd never take me for love, but she's made the bargain, and she'll
  stick to it. Sylvia, when does the wedding take place?"</p>

  <p>I could not speak. I was struck dumb. So was poor Baird. From the rolling
  of his eyes, I thought he was going mad.</p>

  <p>"When do you think?" Sylvia asked. "After we're out of Alaska, of
  course!"</p>

  <p>"No," said Cobalt, "right now is the time! You have the Lightning Warrior,
  haven't you, as sure as cash in the hand?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; WOLF TAMER</h2>

  <p class="first">I had intended to remain in the town for a few days longer,
  but I would not remain there to see Sylvia Baird led to the slaughter. I went
  off to the Birch Creek diggings and arrived there to find that Cobalt had
  arrived before me. When I asked him how the wedding ceremony had gone, he
  told me that he was not yet married to Sylvia. He was going to spend that
  season in the mines and try to make what he could. In the winter he would
  haul Sylvia out overland. That would give her time to adjust her mind to
  him.</p>

  <p>"I hope you're right," I reflected, "and I hope she doesn't run away."</p>

  <p>"No. She won't do that," said Cobalt. "I don't think that she'll do that.
  Do you?"</p>

  <p>"Not if she thinks that it's dishonorable."</p>

  <p>"And what do you think about it?" he asked me, curious.</p>

  <p>It took courage to stand up to Cobalt, but I managed to get my nerve
  together and say: "I think that anything she does to get away is all right.
  You've trapped her, Cobalt. It's always fair for the trapped thing to try to
  get away."</p>

  <p>He was not angry, only thoughtful. He went off hanging his head a little
  on one side, and I saw very little of him during that summer. However, the
  rumors about him were always afloat. He panned hardly a dollar the first four
  weeks, and then he got into good pay dirt and made it by the thousands. Yes,
  I mean by thousands a day. He had nine men working under him. He paid them a
  full ounce a day, every day, and a short working day at that. Then he gave
  them double that rate for overtime, and that gang fairly tore up the tundra
  for their boss. I don't know how much he made altogether, but it was enough,
  with what he had already saved, to make a tidy fortune back in the States. He
  would not be rich, but he would be mighty well off.</p>

  <p>I asked him one day what had given him his leads and where he had learned
  prospecting.</p>

  <p>He replied: "I never learned anything, Chalmers. I'm stupid about it. I
  just throw in where other fellows are digging and trust to luck. Well, just
  now I'm having some luck."</p>

  <p>"You've got your luck, and you're turning it into gold, all right."</p>

  <p>"I've got my luck," he agreed, "but I'll need the hard cash. What does a
  good hunter cost?"</p>

  <p>"A hunter?" I asked, not following him.</p>

  <p>"I mean, a horse, a good hunter. One of the best."</p>

  <p>"Anywhere from five hundred to fifty thousand, I suppose. Well, fifteen
  hundred for a bang-up good horse."</p>

  <p>He whistled. "She's going to be expensive," he said. "She wants to hunt.
  She wants three or four hunters unless I really am generous. Great Scott,
  what would generous be translated into horseflesh?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, some people keep a string of a dozen or more."</p>

  <p>He groaned. "She's expensive, all right. But I don't mind that. I want to
  see her on a horse. She'd look pretty good in the saddle, wouldn't she?"</p>

  <p>"She'd be wonderful on the back of a horse."</p>

  <p>"She'd be something to look at&mdash; ," he observed and fell into a day
  dream about her, so that I forbore talking to him any longer on this
  occasion.</p>

  <p>It was a hard summer for me. The labor was all that I could stand, and the
  bad food and the worse cooking gradually wore me down. I did not wait for the
  winter freeze to come with its full force. I packed up and lugged all the way
  to Circle City a few days before the rush back began.</p>

  <p>I arrived in time to see the beginning of the Yukon freeze. One could hear
  the noise of the ice miles and miles away, like a great and irregular
  cannonade. When I came up, I found the big yellow flood scumming across with
  glass in the shallows, and white piles and ruined marble masonry came
  crashing and heaping upon the sand banks.</p>

  <p>I was glad to see the winter beginning. I did not care how much white iron
  there was on it, for I was tired, very tired. I promised myself, after one
  more year I could get out of the white North and back to my own land. A whole
  winter's rest did not seem sufficient to get the ache out of the small of my
  back. Yet, as a matter of fact, one good sleep was enough to set me up. The
  very next day I ran into Baird. There was a fine, seasonable sharpness in the
  air and a whirl of snowflakes which melted out of sight as they touched the
  ground, but the winter was approaching.</p>

  <p>"Coming up this way, all right," I said to Baird.</p>

  <p>"Is he?" asked Baird, giving me a wild look. "When does he arrive?"</p>

  <p>I examined the man. He was much changed. He had grown thinner during the
  summer, and his eyes had receded into his head. He had the appearance of one
  just risen from a sick bed, in fact.</p>

  <p>"I meant the winter," I said, frowning at him.</p>

  <p>He gasped, only gradually arriving at my meaning. "Yes, yes!" he nodded.
  "The winter, of course, the winter!"</p>

  <p>Off in the distance the ice just then gave a grumble and a grating like a
  thousand carts unloading in a single instant. Baird jerked about and looked
  in the direction of the river. I remember how the snow whirled about his head
  in a sudden flurry just then. He looked as hopeless and desperate as a tame
  beast in a howling wilderness.</p>

  <p>I said: "Look here, Baird, what's the matter with you?"</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with me? Why, nothing's the matter with me," he
  answered.</p>

  <p>He began to look away from me, but I tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"How's Sylvia?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"Well, she's alive," he answered. "Why do you ask about Sylvia? How do you
  expect her to be?"</p>

  <p>I disregarded his testiness. He was sick either in body or mind, perhaps
  in both. Certainly he could not be worried about his business. He had ripped
  a big fortune out of the earth and was still ripping it. Sylvia must be his
  worry, and Sylvia alone.</p>

  <p>At last I said: "Baird, don't talk like a sulky baby. Be a man."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said, "you can talk. You have no children!"</p>

  <p>"You're wrong," I said. "I have two of 'em back home."</p>

  <p>This appeared to be a startling revelation to him. He caught me by the arm
  and looked searchingly at me. "You have two children back home, and yet
  you're up here? You've got a wife and a pair of youngsters, and yet you are
  up here?" He spoke in a most excited tone.</p>

  <p>"In one more season I'll have enough piled up," I answered. "At least,
  that's what I'm betting. Then I go back."</p>

  <p>He paid no attention to this last answer. He exclaimed merely: "If you
  have children, you can understand. You can understand how a man's heart can
  be broken, I mean."</p>

  <p>"Is your heart breaking about Sylvia?" I asked him. Then: "Yes&mdash;I
  suppose it is."</p>

  <p>"Come home with me. I want you to see her. You have to see her in order to
  understand."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to see her," I answered. "I don't want to understand,
  either. I'll tell you what, Baird&mdash;I'm sorry, but I don't want to have
  anything to do with you and Sylvia and Cobalt. I don't want to think about
  it, even. It makes me too sick."</p>

  <p>He looked somberly at me, half occupied with his own misery. "Well, you'll
  come home with me, all right," he persisted. "I want to ask you a
  question."</p>

  <p>"Ask it here in the street. I'm ready."</p>

  <p>"You can't answer it till you've seen Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to see Sylvia. Is she taking it hard?&mdash;don't answer
  that either! Good bye."</p>

  <p>I tried to get away from him, but I could not. He held me as the ancient
  mariner held the wedding guest. He simply took me by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Come along," he said. "We're just wasting time standing around here."</p>

  <p>He must have seen the surrender in my face long before. Now I gave up,
  muttering and mumbling in vain protest, and walked beside him to the house.
  When we were near to the house, I heard Sylvia's violin.</p>

  <p>"That's good," I said. "That shows that she's keeping her spirits up, all
  right."</p>

  <p>"Does it?" asked Baird despondently.</p>

  <p>He knocked at the door. There was a scratching of feet inside, then the
  horrible, throat-tearing snarl of a wolf inside.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" called Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott, man," I said, "don't tell me that Sylvia's in the same room
  with the Lightning Warrior, and the beast on the loose?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders. "You'll see," was all he said. Then: "It's I,
  Sylvia. I've got Chalmers here with me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's good," she returned. "Wait till I get King by the scruff of
  his neck. Now it's all right. Come on in, Dad!"</p>

  <p>He turned around and gave me a good, long look, then he pushed up on
  tiptoes, I stopped so short. There was the Lightning Warrior, do you see,
  looking bigger and fiercer than ever, and the only thing that kept him from
  jumping at my throat was the little, childish hand of Sylvia which held him
  by a bit of the mane. He snarled again.</p>

  <p>"Idiot!" said Sylvia, and with her other hand she aimed to slap him
  lightly between the eyes, just where the brow of a lobo wrinkles with such
  deep wisdom. "Idiot," she repeated once she had struck that terrible
  head.</p>

  <p>The Lightning Warrior stopped growling and licked her hand. He gave her a
  furtive, upward glance of deepest love and then once more turned the full
  weight of his hostile attention toward me.</p>

  <p>"Come in," invited Sylvia. "Come right in and don't worry about him. Only,
  don't touch him. That's all."</p>

  <p>"I won't touch him," I assured her. "I don't need the warning."</p>

  <p>I squeezed against the wall, trying to keep my distance as I edged through
  the door. That wolf looked to me like naked lightning about to strike, and
  there was only the restraining touch of that young woman to keep him
  quiet.</p>

  <p>"That's what I wanted you to see," said Baird. "That's why I wanted you to
  come home with me, old fellow."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. GETTING IN DEEP</h2>

  <p class="first">It was worth a long trip, of course, just to see the way
  that <i>loup-garou</i>had been tamed by the girl. It seemed to me that there
  was no trace of red about the eyes, and that the very iris of the eyes was a
  darker, deeper blue now. He had become the very shadow of Sylvia Baird, so
  moving that his head was always under her hand. Nevertheless, it was not to
  see the wolf that Baird had brought me. He had carried me home so that I
  could see Sylvia herself.</p>

  <p>I've said that Baird was much changed, but his alteration was as nothing
  compared with the new look of his daughter. Poor Sylvia! The joy and the
  sting had gone out of her. She was as white and still as a cut flower, and
  sometimes in talking the blank expression accompanying a far-off vision
  crossed her eyes. Yet her courage kept her head high. As I looked at her, I
  cursed Cobalt, then Baird for persuading me to come to the house, then myself
  for having been such a gull as to be dragged along. I had known that there
  would be nothing but pain inside those walls, and I was right. There was only
  one pleasant subject apparently, and you may be sure that I jumped at that
  and clung to it.</p>

  <p>"How in the world did you do it, Sylvia? It's a miracle. That white fiend!
  I still can't believe it. He's dangerous.</p>

  <p>He'll get you one day when your back is turned."</p>

  <p>"No. He won't attack her," said Baird. "She's turned her back on him a
  thousand times."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Sylvia," I insisted. "Tell me exactly what happened."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she replied. "We had him there in the back yard for a week
  or so, held by a regular horse chain, and he spent half his time trying to
  tear out the staple that held the chain and the other half would be grinding
  away at it until you could hear the sound of his teeth on the steel links all
  through the house. It put my nerves on edge, and so I decided to stop it. I
  went out and took off his collar."</p>

  <p>"Hold on," I said. "Then he must have had a chance to slash you."</p>

  <p>"Well, he had a chance, but he didn't."</p>

  <p>"Go on, Sylvia," urged her father. "You never told me just what you did.
  Go on and tell us exactly."</p>

  <p>"Why, I did nothing. I just unbuckled the collar."</p>

  <p>"Didn't he attempt to tear your throat?" I asked her.</p>

  <p>"He looked as though he would, for a minute."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"When I got my hand on the collar, he seemed to realize in a way that I
  was there to help him and not to make him more miserable."</p>

  <p>I did not need to close my eyes in order to see that picture of the girl
  leaning over the fighting head of the Lightning Warrior. I could hear the
  vibration of his snarling and see the demon in his eyes. What had made her do
  it? And what silken tissue of mental power had kept the big wolf in restraint
  during that instant? No one who loved life would have taken such a chance. In
  fact, she must have hardly cared whether she fell to Cobalt or to the teeth
  of the wolf. So, even by way of the pleasanter topic of the wolf, I was
  forced back again to the thought of Cobalt. He filled the whole mental
  horizon in that house.</p>

  <p>We had some tea with brandy in it, Russian style, and Sylvia sat up as
  hold as you please and told me the town chatter how many log rafts had come
  down the river in the last month, how the Pickering boys had brought down the
  biggest raft ever seen only to have it swept on a swift current past the
  city. It went to pieces, and their summer's work went out to sea to make
  driftwood another day for the fires of the Eskimos. That was the summer when
  Judge Colfax was killed by Sidney Rice, and she told about that, while I
  watched her in pain and admiration, hearing little of her words but seeing
  her effort, most of all when she forced herself to smile.</p>

  <p>When she got up to bring more hot water for the tea, I turned to Baird and
  abused him to his face. "You couldn't keep it to yourself, could you?" I
  said. "You had to invite me in so that I can have bad dreams the rest of my
  life, too. Confound you, Baird, if you want to keep her out of the hands of
  Cobalt, it's your own business. Go ahead with it. But it's rotten to drag me
  in here. Poor Sylvia! What a brick she is!"</p>

  <p>Baird sighed. "She's not a brick. She's an angel. She's all blue and gold
  as a cloud. I love her. You love her. Everybody loves her. But she goes to
  Cobalt!" He bowed his head. There was no doubt that his hair had turned quite
  a bit grayer during the summer. "There'll be children, too," he went on
  bitterly. "More of the wolf breed, the wolf strain. Chalmers, tell me what
  I'm to do about it?"</p>

  <p>"That's enough. Another word, and I leave the house. Don't you try to drag
  me into the business!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, man," said poor Baird, "don't talk to me like that. You know that you
  were in on it the day the hand was dealt all around. You were here. You
  helped to make the decision. Now, you can't dodge that. Dig down into your
  deepest pocket, and for Sylvia's sake tell me what I'm to do!"</p>

  <p>I fell into a perspiration, but just then Sylvia came back, carrying the
  pot of steaming water and with the head of the great wolf just under her
  hand. After she'd refilled our cups, she sat down, with one arm around the
  shoulders of the huge fellow. When she was sitting beside him, his head was
  almost on a level with hers.</p>

  <p>"He's crazy about you, Sylvia," I observed. "I can see that. You make a
  grand picture there, my dear, with that cannibal beside you."</p>

  <p>"Do I?" queried Sylvia, scratching the wisdom wrinkle between his eyes
  until he turned his great head and looked fixedly in adoration at her.</p>

  <p>"Was it this way from the start?" I asked. "From the minute that you
  leaned over him, like a suicide, and took his collar off?"</p>

  <p>When I said that about suicide, I kept a straight eye on her and had my
  reward. For her head tipped up suddenly, and she gave me a frightened glance.
  I had been right in my guess. It was as if she had tried a revolver that day,
  and the gun had misfired. I grew a little sick. I thought of that delicate
  body lying still and the crimson welling at the throat. I had to shrug my
  shoulders and so bring myself back to common sense and the things of the
  day.</p>

  <p>She went on to explain: "He kept slinking away and snarling when I came
  near. But every day I spent a long time in the yard. Perhaps he got used to
  me. Then there was a time when I came up behind him as he was snapping at a
  bone. He whirled about, snapped at me, and got my arm in his mouth. He seemed
  to remember while his teeth were in the air, as it were, and he didn't even
  break the skin. He just held onto my arm, and his eyes were on fire, let me
  tell you. He sort of dared me to budge, and you can bet that I didn't stir. I
  just talked to him until he got quieter. He let go my arm and licked my
  hand."</p>

  <p>"I wish I had seen that," I said. "You're a brave girl, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"Look, look!" scoffed Sylvia. "He's admiring my self portrait. Now, don't
  you be so silly."</p>

  <p>"You <i>are</i> a brave girl," I insisted, "and now, by heaven, something
  is going to be done!"</p>

  <p>She just rubbed the head of the Lightning Warrior and looked thoughtfully
  at me. At last she began to shake her head. "What could be done?"</p>

  <p>"We'll cut and run for it," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"I've thought of the same thing," put in Baird.</p>

  <p>"You bet you've thought of it," I told him bitterly. "You just wanted me
  to bolster up your courage a little. Well, I forgive you. Sylvia, we've got
  enough time. Cobalt won't be in from the creek for a week. We'll make tracks.
  There's going to be snow by tomorrow morning. Listen to that wind! You feel
  the fingertips of it beginning to poke under the door and through the cracks?
  Yes, there'll be plenty of snow in the morning, and we'll get out and travel.
  That's settled."</p>

  <p>The girl only wagged her lovely head at me, without a smile, without a
  gleam. "You know what would happen?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, what would happen?"</p>

  <p>"He'd catch us. He might not hurt Dad very much, but he'd kill you, Tom
  Chalmers. He'd kill you as sure as sin. You know it, too."</p>

  <p>I didn't need to have her say so. Of course, he would kill me, but I said:
  "Oh, don't you be so sure. After all, guns are guns and bullets don't pick
  and choose."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure," she said. "I don't think that a bullet would choose
  Cobalt."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" I asked her. I was curious to hear her explanation for such a
  belief.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you why. I think that a bullet won't stop him until he's done
  some other things that he's meant to do," she said.</p>

  <p>"Oh," I responded, "you're feeling fatalistic about him, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am. Aren't you?" she queried.</p>

  <p>"If I hear his name again, I won't sleep all night," said her father.</p>

  <p>"You bet you won't," I said. "You're going to sit up all night anyway,
  while we plan things and get our outfit together. It won't be the easiest
  thing in the world to get out tomorrow morning, making as late a start as
  this."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that you'd go through with it?" asked Baird.</p>

  <p>"Wait, wait!" cried the girl. "It won't do. You're both quite mad. He'd
  overtake us so easily, and then what would we do? Even if you're mad enough
  to try the thing, I wouldn't go along. Not I! I wouldn't let Tom Chalmers be
  thrown away. Father, what in the world are you thinking of? I'm going to get
  us some more brandy. You wild people really need another drink."</p>

  <p>When she was out of the room, the white ghost stalking beside her, I
  leaned a bit toward her father and the thing I did not want to say but had to
  finally came out: "She won't go peaceably, so we'll kidnap her, man. We'll
  take her along by force!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; A SCREECHER</h2>

  <p class="first">Like some animal that hears the clang of the trap and the
  bite of its teeth at the same instant, I realized that I was caught in the
  thing for good and all. Baird would hold me to it. I could see that by the
  joy in his face, but we could not talk any longer as Sylvia came back at that
  instant. We pretended to have dropped the matter, persuaded by her, but
  afterward, when I left the house, Baird found an excuse for going along with
  me. He was frightened and excited, and the moment we were outside, bending
  our heads against the wind, he shouted to know whether or not I had been in
  earnest. I told him that I was, so we went down to the saloon and found a
  quiet corner for talking.</p>

  <p>It was a dreary day and a dreary place. The bartender kept shrugging his
  shoulders to work his coat collar higher up around his neck. He kept glancing
  up too, as though he feared that the storm would slice off the room all the
  beams were groaning with the weight of the wind. In fact, winter was on top
  of us in a stride, and the windows were plastered white with frost and snow.
  And winter meant the beginning of the long, cold silence in Circle City. The
  howl of the wind and the thunder of the ice jamming in the river simply were
  the last guns of the summer.</p>

  <p>Sitting there in the corner, we made our plans. We were like two helpless,
  hopeless children trying to act in a lost cause. Baird was white and did not
  get his color back. I felt a hollowness in the pit of my stomach and could
  guess that I was as white as my companion. He began on an unexpected key,
  asking me how big a pile I wanted to make before I went back home. I told him
  that I aimed at eighty thousand. It was not a great fortune, but in those
  days it meant a good deal. A man could sit back pretty comfortably. He wanted
  to know how much of it I had stacked up, and I told him that I had raked in
  nearly fifty-five thousand dollars altogether.</p>

  <p>"If you leave now, you cut yourself short," he said.</p>

  <p>"I'll come back in for another season," I told him. "I'll be glad to get
  back to see the family. The kids are growing up. I'm hungry to have a look at
  them."</p>

  <p>Baird was a good fellow. He grinned a little at me and shook his head.
  "Look here, Chalmers, this thing you're going to do for me&mdash;why, money
  wouldn't pay for it. I know that. But you'll let me make up the difference
  between what you have and what you want to have? I'll be glad to give you
  that twenty-five thousand at the end of the trail out."</p>

  <p>I couldn't take his money. He insisted that it was not hire.
  "Compensation" was what he called it. Otherwise, he couldn't let me go along.
  We had quite an argument, but in the end I had it my way. I really felt that
  money did not much matter. To me it appeared that I had about one chance in
  five of getting through alive. As a matter of fact, as it turned out my
  chances were a good deal less than that, and frankly I would never have
  undertaken the job if I had dreamed of what lay before me.</p>

  <p>When the money matter was put aside, we got down to our actual plans. Jack
  Silver had five good dogs for sale, and I would pick up three more. Eight
  made a long string and we would load three sleds with nothing but food and
  the lightest sort of camp equipment. The girl was a good hand on snowshoes,
  he told me, but it probably would be necessary to let her ride a part of
  every day if we wanted to stretch some long marches behind us. I made a list
  of everything. There would be no trouble in getting what we wanted, though
  the prices would be high now that the last steamer had come up the river for
  the season.</p>

  <p>Then Baird stood up, ready to go home, and shook hands with me with tears
  in his eyes. "We'll carry our rifles, at least," he said.</p>

  <p>I looked back at him and understood what he meant.</p>

  <p>"We'll carry one rifle, at least."</p>

  <p>"You'll come at midnight?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come before that a little, if I can. Can you handle Sylvia?"</p>

  <p>"I can handle her. I'll simply pick her up in my arms and carry her out,
  if I have to."</p>

  <p>"Suppose that she squeals?"</p>

  <p>"She won't squeal. Well, she might. I'll keep a hand over her mouth. Don't
  worry about Sylvia. She's only a child. I can handle her all right."</p>

  <p>We had both left out one detail. It wasn't a small thing either, but it
  must appear in its due place. He went home, and I started to collect the
  outfit.</p>

  <p>I shall never forget how my heart failed me when I saw the things gathered
  into a heap on the floor of the store. It was the sight of the snowshoes that
  upset me more than anything else, for I could not look at the infernal things
  without thinking of the hundreds of miles of slogging we would have to cover
  with those clumsy instruments of torture lashed onto our wet, freezing
  feet.</p>

  <p>When everything had been gathered, I left the outfit of eight dogs with
  Jack Silver. It was a good lot of animals. I've seen plenty of Huskies that
  looked heavier and more fit to lug burdens, but these fellows were rangy and
  looked fit for speed dragging a light load. Jack Silver swore that his lot
  were all flyers; and I had selected the other three to suit.</p>

  <p>Then I went to get supper, and I laid in a good meal. It seemed that I
  could never get enough, when I looked forward to the long monotony of bacon
  grease and the flour and tea that lay ahead of us. The wind was still howling
  like an evil spirit, nudging the building with a solid shoulder and seeming
  to shake the ground. I sat in a corner chair, smoked a pipe, and then slept
  soundly in the chair for about an hour.</p>

  <p>When I awoke, it was close to half past eleven. The saloon was empty, and
  the bartender was sitting beside the stove, biting his lips while he read in
  a time-yellowed newspaper the description of a prize fight. He only grunted
  at me when I got up and went out. I looked over his shoulder and saw a
  picture of the two fighters, looking white and naked under the glare of
  electric lights, with the shadowy ropes fencing them into the pen.</p>

  <p>That was the picture that I had in mind as I passed outside, and it seemed
  to me that the thing was appropriate. I was going into a ring against Cobalt.
  I was stepping out of my class. The one comfort was the size of the arena.
  Outside in the dark, I hung onto the wall for a moment and practiced
  breathing. There was so much edge to that wind, and the snow kept flying so
  thick and fast along it that I was half choked, but I got my bearings.</p>

  <p>It's an odd thing that a man will go through almost anything if he's ever
  experienced it before. If I had not marched on worse nights than that one, I
  would have said, offhand, that no human being could face such a wind. Now I
  plowed ahead through snow and wind and got to the loaded sleds and the dog
  team, with Jack Silver sitting on the forward sled, asleep.</p>

  <p>I woke him up. He cursed me for being late, but I gave him a little money
  extra above our agreement, and he counted it and stopped grunting. He helped
  me break out the sleds, one by one. It was a tough job, not that the runners
  had frozen in very solidly, or that the sleds were heavily loaded, but the
  team did not pull together. Even Jack's five dogs did not seem to know what
  it was all about.</p>

  <p>We got them going at last, and I steered for the house of Baird. When I
  drew up in front of it, I whistled twice. Then I waited. I began to hope that
  the screeching of the wind would drown the noise of the signal. I began to
  tell myself that if Baird did not hear that first signal, I would not whistle
  again. Then, like something on the stage, the door of the house opened with a
  bang and out came Baird with the girl in his arms. He had promised to stifle
  her with one hand if she cried out. He had promised to handle her easily,
  because she was still a child to him. Well, she was young enough and slender
  enough but, when I saw her at that moment, she was all arms and legs, kicking
  in every direction and screeching like a Scotch bagpipe with never a stop for
  breathing.</p>

  <p>It shocked me. I thought she must be out of her mind and ran to help
  Baird. He was cursing and groaning, trying to handle her, but she was
  fighting like an eel. So I took a big bandanna out of my pocket and put it
  around her head and over her mouth and gave it a good screw at the back of
  her head. I was rougher than necessary, but I was pretty angry. I had begun
  to think of myself as quite the hero, quite the dauntless and
  self-sacrificing fellow. To have Sylvia spoil my little act with this
  squealing upset me.</p>

  <p>I said at her ear: "Now quit it, Sylvia. Don't be a little fool. Quit it,
  and I'll stop choking you. Nod your head if you'll promise to come along
  peaceably and stop the yipping."</p>

  <p>She nodded. I took the handkerchief away from her mouth. She turned about
  and caught me by the elbows. "Tom!" she said, "if you force the thing
  through, there'll be a frightful tragedy. You don't think about it now, but I
  can see what will happen. I dreamed it this night. I dreamed that we were on
  the march and out of the white behind us a speck loomed, and we tried to go
  faster, but we couldn't. We ran, but it did no good, and the speck got bigger
  and bigger, and it was Cobalt. We knew him in the distance by the way that he
  was running. He came up to you, Tom. Do you hear? He took you with his hands.
  He seemed to break you."</p>

  <p>The storm blew the last words far away and thin.</p>

  <p>"If he kills you, Dad and I will be the murderers!" she shouted through
  the wind.</p>

  <p>"Dreams go by opposites," was all I could think of, like a fool. Then I
  asked her: "Will you go quietly?"</p>

  <p>"I've told you that I will, if you insist, Tom. Dad, it's only fair that
  we should leave Tom out of it. We can leave together, but don't drag poor Tom
  into it."</p>

  <p>"You come back into the house if you're over your screeching fit," said
  her father, "and tie on the snowshoes."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; RULING WOLFISH PASSION</h2>

  <p class="first">How easily a man grows irritated! I loved the girl for
  wanting to leave me out of the dangerous business. I almost hated poor Baird
  for overruling her so abruptly. Together they went back into the house but
  returned after some moments. Baird now carried a considerable bundle of
  additional clothing and odds and ends for Sylvia's comfort. She came along
  without resistance as she had promised to come but, when she came near to me,
  I saw that she was crying. Tears, however, don't mean a great deal at such a
  time. They're only an extra depressant.</p>

  <p>I got the team started after some trouble, and I ran ahead to break trail
  for them through the fluff of the newly fallen snow, while Baird took the gee
  pole. I led straight out from Circle City through a white fog in which no one
  could see us and in which we would have looked like phantoms more than
  realities if we had been seen. So we headed up the country paralleling the
  river at a short distance inland.</p>

  <p>No matter whether a fellow is undertaking a possibility or an
  impossibility, it makes the heart rise to stop struggling with the mind and
  to begin working with the muscles. So I felt a great deal better as we went
  striding along, and I told myself no matter what he might be, Cobalt was not
  a bird. He could not skim the ground. He would have to walk over it, just as
  we were doing.</p>

  <p>I comforted myself in other ways as well, recalling that the greatest
  horse in the world is only a half second faster in the mile perhaps than
  twenty others. The winner of any race, as a rule, is not a great distance
  ahead of the last trailer. We now had a good advantage. It would probably not
  be until after this storm that the miners came in from the creek. Their
  progress would be slow. It would not be until Circle City was reached that
  Cobalt would learn that the three of us were no longer in town. If he could
  overtake us after that, more power to him. Gritting my teeth, I vowed that
  that would never be.</p>

  <p>Progress through the soft snow was not easy. Sometimes we hit bare rocks.
  Sometimes we skittered through feathery drifts. We got on. I remembered, for
  the thousandth time, what an iron-hard, half-breed 'puncher once said to me:
  "The man who makes the long march is the man who keeps his legs moving a long
  time every day." I believe it is true. On the trail across the White Horse
  and up through the lakes, I've seen the splendid athlete beaten and exhausted
  because every day he was aware of his own speed and tried to make the most of
  it, while little, skinny, narrow-chested clerks kept on with the uncaptained
  host because they were accustomed to mental pain, mental plodding and this is
  easily translated into snowshoe work.</p>

  <p>We went on for two hours. I continued to break trail when we had an odd
  interruption. I heard a wolf's howl behind us. It was repeated nearer at
  hand. It came again, close upon us, and suddenly I looked back and saw the
  Lightning Warrior coming through the dimness. When he reached the girl, he
  bounded around her like a playful puppy multiplied by a hundred, and then he
  started forward for the dogs. Sylvia stopped him, just as the whole string of
  the dogs turned about and went for the big brute. They intended to mob him,
  but he had not the slightest intention of budging in spite of their
  numbers.</p>

  <p>He stood with his head high, ready to strike and jump this way and that. I
  never saw anything more splendidly fit and ready for trouble. Then the
  running dogs reached the limit of the traces and the lines and tumbled into a
  twisted, confused mass. They began to fight with one an other, and it was
  half an hour before I could get them straightened out, Baird helping. We both
  were bitten once or twice during the mix-up, but luckily the wounds were only
  surface scratches.</p>

  <p>The Lightning Warrior or King, as Sylvia now preferred to call him had
  been left behind and a note to a neighbor asked him to feed the brute. Some
  instinct must have told King that his mistress was leaving, and in a
  desperate manner he had managed to scale the lofty fence of the yard and get
  away, a thing he had never succeeded in doing when he was first captured,
  even after he had been unchained. He complicated our task. There would be his
  big mouth to feed from the food reserved for the dogs. There would be his
  saber teeth to keep from the throats of the team also. But now that we had
  started, it was impossible to go clear back with him. Sylvia took charge. He
  walked along at her side the rest of that march. When she was fagged and had
  to ride, he went close beside her, snarling at the sled which carried her and
  sniffing at the load on which she was lying.</p>

  <p>Taking turns in breaking trail, an exhausting business on account of the
  snow, Baird and I kept on until we were done in, and the dogs wavered against
  their collars. Then we made camp in the brush, and I was delighted to see
  Sylvia make herself useful. Baird and I put up the tent, which had a small
  partition in it so that he and I could occupy one section and Sylvia the
  other. We unharnessed the dogs. Sylvia in the meantime took the hand axe and
  cut down wood in the most business-like manner and then took the cooking in
  hand. She filled the kettle with snow which would melt into water for the
  tea, and at the same time on top of the little, flimsy stove she started
  bacon frying in the skillet. When it was fried, she took the grease and
  poured it into a hole made in the top of a sack of flour. In the same hole
  salt and baking powder already had been mixed with the flour, and now the
  mass of grease dough was kneaded and divided into three flapjacks. That's
  what the Northerners called them, but there is no real name for their
  indigestibility and toughness. She made two of a size and a smaller one for
  herself. The flapjacks, bacon, and tea made up our meal and, now that the
  frozen fish had been thawed, the dogs ate and watched as they turned about in
  the snow to make themselves beds.</p>

  <p>We consumed every crumb of the food, making an odd picture, crouched there
  like beasts over our provisions. Behind us, right in the entrance to Sylvia's
  section of the tent, was the Lightning Warrior, watching. The fish I had
  thrown to him he left untouched with a regal indifference, but he quickly
  accepted it in one gulp from the hand of the girl.</p>

  <p>And Sylvia herself? She was always a surprise to me. She never ceased
  being a surprise. She looked half child and half angel, but she was always
  turning out a real woman, with tough muscles and plenty of common sense. Now
  that she had been dragged into this flight, she bent every energy toward
  making a success of it. She kept her spirits high. She had a special smile
  for each of us. When at last we turned into our sleeping bags, my mind was
  full of thoughts of her.</p>

  <p>Another thing that occupied my attention was the strangeness of the entire
  business and the singular linking of the parts together until the final
  picture of danger was complete. These parts were Cobalt, first of all, and
  then Sylvia, elements totally without danger if other things had not been
  added. Then came the Lightning Warrior and, by accident or through perverse
  inspiration, this was drawn into the chosen circle. From the Lightning
  Warrior came the real danger, the real climax. Finally, nothing would have
  been done about it except that Baird and I at last tried to change the course
  of probable events and that's why we were upon the march and Cobalt, like an
  invisible thunderstorm, was off there in the far distance.</p>

  <p>Somehow it seemed to me that even Cobalt was not the most significant part
  of the picture. It was upon the Lightning Warrior that my mind rested most as
  the pivotal point of the adventure. Nothing could exceed the unreality of
  having him lying there in the entrance of the little tent on guard. The only
  way to parallel it was to go back to the <i>Arabian Nights</i> in which the
  power of a ring induces an evil spirit to become the slave of a mere weak
  human. But there was magic in the power of Sylvia also. It was in her
  courage, her gentle voice, and the greatness of her love.</p>

  <p>I fell asleep literally I fell, that is to say, into a region of abysmal
  turmoil, strange images, unrest only to find Baird tapping my shoulder in the
  morning and telling me that it was time to get under way. We cooked breakfast
  and started to harness up after eating. Then we found the first real touch of
  tragedy. One of the dogs was missing.</p>

  <p>We kicked around in the snow until Baird uncovered the body. The beast was
  dead. Its throat was cleanly cut, as if by a pair of knives. We turned back.
  King was watching us with an air of splendid detachment, but we well knew
  what had happened. The sight of the dogs had been too much for him, and he
  had tried his old handicraft. Baird, without a word, got the rifle, loaded
  it, and took a bead, but Sylvia knocked up his hand.</p>

  <p>"He's only started," warned Baird. "He'll never rest until he's butchered
  them all. We can get on with one dog the less. But, with two gone, we're
  handicapped, with three gone, we're fairly hamstrung. Stand away, Sylvia. You
  go forward and we'll catch up with you. It's a dirty business, but there's
  one thing certain, that it has to be done for the sake of our hides!"</p>

  <p>She stood squarely in front of him. She called and King came close up
  beside her, so that her hand rested on his head. "You can't do it," said the
  girl. "You don't understand, Father. I don't know how to explain. He gave him
  to me without a mark on him, no wound from a knife, or a bullet, or a trap's
  teeth. You can't touch him. Nobody has a right to touch him, except
  Cobalt."</p>

  <p>"Sylvia," said her father, "I don't like to hear you talk like this. It
  sounds as if you've lost your wits. What sort of a mystery is in your
  head?"</p>

  <p>"Mind you," she said, "there's nothing but the most terrible sort of harm
  would come of it. It's wrong. It's a sin to hurt him. He doesn't know right
  from wrong, except as a wolf. To kill dogs is good in a wolf's consciousness.
  A man conquered him and dragged him back among men. Then he found me and got
  to love me. Now, Dad, you see how it is. Or don't you?"</p>

  <p>"You're talking sentimental rot, Sylvia," said Baird.</p>

  <p>I thought so, too, but she was entirely serious.</p>

  <p>"Let me try to tell you," she went on. "It's a ghostly feeling that I have
  about it. Right or wrong, we all want to get away from Cobalt. It's life or
  death. Well, I have a feeling that King is a sort of talisman for us. Cobalt
  conquered him in one way. We've conquered him in another way. Don't you see
  that? If we can keep King what he's been made, I think somehow that Cobalt
  will never catch us!"</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE ICE TRAIL</h2>

  <p class="first">Now having put down the words just as she spoke them, I am
  rather confused. They seem ridiculous but, as she spoke them with a troubled
  eye and a great deal of conviction, I know that they gave pause to both Baird
  and me. One can't help superstitions in the great Northland. The fear of
  space cuts at one's soul like a wind of ice. God is in the light and Satan is
  in the shadow that walks at one's heels. That's the way one is likely to feel
  up there. Baird and I were helpless the moment she told us that she felt the
  Lightning Warrior was the talisman through which we might beat Cobalt in the
  end. Besides, we could not help feeling some essential mystery in that big
  white killer.</p>

  <p>"He might be some good if he could step into the traces of the dog we've
  lost. Do you realize that he's killed our very best leader?" asked Baird.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll take him up there and try him in the harness," replied
  Sylvia.</p>

  <p>She did it. We started off that morning with me breaking trail, Sylvia
  behind me, stepping in my tracks and improving the trail, too. Behind her
  came the Lightning Warrior. He hated the dog harness that was on him with a
  shuddering hatred. He had even bared his fangs at Sylvia when she put it on
  him, but he made no violent resistance. Once in the harness, he was worth any
  two dogs I have ever seen. There was no fatigue in him. His muscles were
  built up from ranging a hundred miles a day through the snows. His spirit was
  stronger than spring steel and, when Sylvia got a bit ahead of him now and
  then, he seemed to pull all the three sleds with his unaided might in order
  to get to her. I've heard of a dog pulling a thousand pounds. If that is
  possible, then King could have done more, much more. For whatever a dog could
  do, he could do it just that much better.</p>

  <p>We felt the difference when Sylvia was tired out and could not shuffle a
  step forward on her snowshoes. Then King had to be taken from the harness and
  put back with Sylvia on the rear sled, while the second leader took the place
  of the wolf. What a change in our way of going! It seemed as though half of
  our motive power had been snatched away. With that white monster out there in
  front, we were a part of the landscape. When he was gone, we were simply lost
  in it in the most amazingly sudden way. Our team seemed to limp uncertainly
  along. The joy was snatched from our progress.</p>

  <p>Later on, when Sylvia was sufficiently rested, we put King again in the
  lead. I watched the team, and I could see the change. They moved differently.
  Each straightened out head and tail and pulled as though trying to get its
  teeth into the animal just ahead. They seemed to know King. They feared him.
  They acted as though they would have liked to sink their teeth in him while
  his back was turned.</p>

  <p>It was not my idea alone. Baird noticed it also, when he was behind and I
  was breaking trail, and he could not help muttering to me that there seemed
  to be something in what Sylvia said our chances of escape were linked with
  King.</p>

  <p>"As if," concluded Baird, "he knows that Cobalt is behind us, and he
  doesn't want that human wolf to overtake us."</p>

  <p>This was going a bit far. I could not reduce the thing to words as exact
  as these, but I know that from this day we all shared Sylvia's conviction
  that our luck was wrapped up in the wolf. He was our charm, and a dangerous
  charm at that.</p>

  <p>Winter never closed in more rapidly or with a more iron hand. The
  temperature dropped, day and dark, and the snow seemed always falling. That
  was because the wind picked up the dry flakes and whirled them. Then came
  cold so intense that the wind was shut away behind an invisible wall of ice.
  In my beard and in Baird's the moisture of our breathing turned to ice. We
  became like men with faces of stone with our heads always oddly nodding as we
  trudged along. When at last the wind was still, we found ourselves in a white
  world. The trees were piled with it, the branches sagging. The brush along
  the river banks was rimmed with crystal frost until it looked like an
  imitation in glass.</p>

  <p>We were on the river now. It made the better road. Later on the ice would
  be smoother perhaps, but still it was an easier, a more graded way, even
  though we occasionally found the ice blocks scattered in heaps, like the
  ruins of a primitive fortress. We kept to the graded river way, and at night
  we pulled up a bank and camped where there was plenty of wood. Our spirits
  were so relieved in time that we could even talk about Cobalt.</p>

  <p>My idea was that he was a good fellow with wild impulses which were
  stronger than he could handle. "I'll tell you what," I remember saying one
  evening as we drank the third or fourth cup of tea, "Cobalt is like the
  fellows in the circus who span four horses with their spread legs and ride
  them around the race course. All right on a circus race track.</p>

  <p>All right with circus horses on a circus track, but it wouldn't do for
  pitching broncos. Not a bit! The rider would get a tumble, and the mustangs
  would eat him likely, instead of grass. They'd prefer him,
  probably&mdash;some of the mustangs I've seen on the range. Cobalt is like
  that. I mean, he's straddling emotions which the rest of us don't feel. You
  feel kindness and anger and hatred and joy, and all that. So do I. But we're
  not like Cobalt. Everything is multiplied in him."</p>

  <p>"You're wrong," said Baird. "He's simply not a man. He's a wolf. That's
  what he is. When I see a wolf, I think of him. This white
  <i>loup-garou</i>&mdash;I get chills simply looking at him because he reminds
  me of Cobalt."</p>

  <p>I turned to Sylvia. She was sipping her tea with a mild, thoughtful
  look.</p>

  <p>"Tell me your idea, my dear," I said.</p>

  <p>She seemed a bit startled to be drawn into the conversation. As though she
  had heard us only dimly, she recollected for a moment, and then she answered:
  "Well, I don't know exactly. You can't put a whole man into just words, I
  suppose, but I'd say that Cobalt is different because he's natural. He
  doesn't care."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by natural?" asked her father. "And doesn't care?"</p>

  <p>"The way animals are natural. Not even wild Indians are natural the way
  Cobalt is."</p>

  <p>"Go on, explain!" we asked her. "Indians are pretty free."</p>

  <p>We were both interested. She seemed to have the finger of her mind upon
  some real idea, and our curiosity was aroused.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "Indians have taboos. Things they mustn't touch, mustn't
  do. Then again, there are a lot of ceremonials they submit to. Ceremonial
  dances, I mean, before they go to war, magic the medicine men preside over.
  In a way, the Indian's hands are tied almost as badly as a white man's, but
  there's nothing to tie Cobalt. He doesn't believe in anything. He's an
  absolutely free soul."</p>

  <p>"It's true!" cried Baird, thumping his fist on his knee. "He believes in
  nothing. That's why he's strong. He has the strength of the evil one because
  he is a demon. He's free, just as Satan is free. That's your idea, isn't it,
  Sylvia? It's mine, too."</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "did you ever hear of Cobalt cheating, or taking
  advantage of a weaker man, or failing to do his share on a march? Aren't
  there twenty stories of how he's carried the other fellow's pack for days at
  a time?"</p>

  <p>"To show off his strength?" countered Baird, rather weakly I thought.</p>

  <p>"You can't just call it that," said Sylvia.</p>

  <p>I agreed with her.</p>

  <p>"Go on, then," urged her father. "Tell me more about it. I want all of
  your idea."</p>

  <p>"It's simply that he's neither good nor bad. He's not between, either,"
  she said, frowning as she dug further into her own thought. "He has nothing
  to do with good or bad. He does what pleases him. Most of us live almost
  entirely under the thumb of public opinion of one sort or another, but Cobalt
  doesn't. He lives inside his own conceptions. He goes for what he wants. He
  lets the chips fall where they may. Think of murder. It curdles the blood of
  most people but, if Cobalt found a man really in his way, he'd kill that man
  just as quickly as King would kill one of the sled dogs."</p>

  <p>Suddenly she stopped talking and looked across at me. I knew what she was
  thinking, and my blood curdled because I was most certainly in the way of
  that terrible fellow.</p>

  <p>Our conversation ended for the evening abruptly at that point. And I had
  dreams again when I went to sleep.</p>

  <p>The next day we were cheered again by a splendid march. The only
  depressing thing was the howling of wolves in the woods along the banks.
  Sometimes we had glimpses of them big, strapping lobos with high shoulders
  and bellies tucked up with famine, though I don't know why they should have
  been so hunger-ridden at this season of the year. However, there they were,
  following us, winding in and out through the shrubbery.</p>

  <p>Baird was so annoyed by them that he got out the rifle and raised it, but
  the wolves had vanished before he could get in a shot. Five minutes later
  they were once more paralleling our course, and we could hear their
  melancholy howling. Poor Sylvia was in a panic and feared that they would
  rush our camp. We laughed at her for having such thoughts.</p>

  <p>"How many ordinary wolves would King dispose of in five seconds?" I asked
  her.</p>

  <p>We found a good camping place at the end of that march and ate an extra
  lot because the going had been rather rough. On the river ice, the cold was
  bitter beyond belief. The freezing trees kept popping just like cannon in the
  distant woods.</p>

  <p>Then we turned in, and the sweet poison of sleep was getting into my brain
  when all at once I heard wolves yelling, and the next moment there was a
  hurricane of sound right about our ears. Our tent was knocked flat by heavy,
  leaping bodies, and we heard snarlings, yellings, and growlings.</p>

  <p>When I managed to get clear of the tent canvas, the mischief was over.
  Baird, with the rifle, had scattered the wolves with a single shot, but the
  villains got off after doing their work. Every one of the dogs of our fine
  team was dead. In that single moment of attack the work was completed, and
  the only toll the wolves paid was right in front of our tent, where white
  King stood with a crimson front, disdaining the two limp forms in the snow
  before him. He had broken their necks for them.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE NEW TEAM</h2>

  <p class="first">The extent of that disaster was so great that no one of us
  spoke about it as a misfortune. Only to be mutely aware of it was enough. We
  merely ate our breakfast in silence and prepared for the day's march.</p>

  <p>This was our position. We were half way from Circle City to Skagway, our
  destination. We had four hundred miles of bitter weather, ice, and snow
  before us, and we were stripped of our freight team which had hauled our food
  and shelter. Our provisions were laid in with the thought of completing the
  trip by dog team. The added length of time it would take to trudge it on
  foot, dragging the sleds by sheer, wretched man power, appalled us.</p>

  <p>Yet, as I said before, none of us spoke about the calamity. We met the
  disaster by splitting the necessary load of equipment and food into two equal
  portions. These halves we put upon two of the sleds. The third sled we would
  abandon. When we had arranged the burdens, we then wondered how we should
  apportion the tractive power. The Lightning Warrior would have to be used,
  but he would only work under the hand and the voice of the girl. If he and
  she worked together at one sled, then it seemed right that Baird and I should
  take a considerably increased portion upon the sled to which we hitched
  ourselves.</p>

  <p>We were about to remake the loads when the girl suddenly and firmly
  protested. She said that she and the wolf, she thought, could outpull us
  anyway in the course of a day's march and make trail as well! We smiled at
  one another, a little grimly because smiles came hard that day, but we agreed
  to let her try to execute her vain little flourish. Only Baird and I, of
  course, struck out ahead to make trail.</p>

  <p>It was a melancholy day. Under the dim sky the wind was moaning, and it
  came at us aslant, like the line of a swooping hawk, a continual sleet, iron-
  hard when it struck and burning with cold. The dark of the storm clouds
  blackened still further the twilight of that winter sky. They seemed to brush
  just above the touch of our fingertips. We rarely looked up. Luckily the wind
  was not full in our faces and therefore, by putting down our heads and
  covering our faces as completely as possible, we could keep going. Even so,
  every moment there would be a numbness of ears or nose or cheek that warned
  us to rub the spot vigorously in order to prevent frostbite.</p>

  <p>We went for a quarter of a mile, and I suggested that we had better tell
  the girl that she need not keep on with her share of the contract. We would
  remove a portion of the weightiest goods to our man-drawn sled. Baird told me
  that she was a stubborn minx, and that she had better receive a thorough
  lesson while we were about it. So we actually kept going for a full two
  miles, and still she was close up behind us.</p>

  <p>We turned to survey this miracle. For the pulling had been hard, the ice
  gripping at the runners where there was no snow, and where the snow lay it
  meant difficult tramping to break the trail. However, there she was behind
  us, swaying a little at the end of the pull rope, so that it was easy to tell
  that she was giving her strength to the work. I was greatly touched by the
  sight of her laboring in this fashion. She looked like a child in that man's
  costume.</p>

  <p>"Poor girl!" I said to Baird.</p>

  <p>He snapped back at me: "We'll start out with no pity on this journey, or
  else we'll very shortly begin to pity ourselves, and that's ruin."</p>

  <p>There was a deal of obvious truth in this, and I did not answer, for now
  the rear sled came up with us. I expected that poor Sylvia would drop down in
  her sled dead beat, after she had pulled so far, but to my amazement she
  turned out with King and circled around us, taking the lead. As she went by
  she called to us: "Catch me if you can!"</p>

  <p>What a sight that was for us, that lovely face and that good cheer
  breaking through like a brilliant sunshine upon us. She seemed to me a very
  human and delightful little saint.</p>

  <p>"Look," I said, astonished. "The girl's not even panting."</p>

  <p>"The wolf, the wolf!" cried Baird hastily. "Look at that beast and the way
  he pulls. He's got the tractive power of a horse."</p>

  <p>He actually seemed to have three feet pressing ice or snow and thrusting
  back, while the fourth foot, before or behind, shifted quickly forward for a
  fresh grip. A casual glance at him seemed to show him simply leaning forward.
  A dog that can pull in this fashion is worth two of even bigger size and
  power. The steady lugger is what one wants for the wheel or sled dog. It
  appeared to me a miracle that the Lightning Warrior should have been willing
  to cast aside his freedom and toil like one who loves slavery. But some dogs
  love to work for work's sake, and it seemed that this wild-caught peregrine
  of the North had the same spirit at least while his mistress was close to
  him, pulling at the same sled.</p>

  <p>Sylvia took the lead from us, and all through that day's march she
  maintained her place with ease. The trail was broken, and the pace set by
  that child and the Lightning Warrior. The girl had been toughened by the
  first marches, and she had a dancer's talent in learning the proper step and
  cadence for the snowshoe work. It's hardly truthful, I suppose, to say that
  she danced along through the day, but that's the only explanation I can give
  of her power. Many a girl will dance an athlete off his feet. So it seemed
  that Sylvia could do with the snowshoes. I don't imagine that she was pulling
  a very great part of the weight, but she kept her line taut and was always
  contributing something to the total traction. So she set the pace for us, and
  we accomplished a good march, considering the conditions.</p>

  <p>In the end we had our reward. For the wind fell, the air cleared, and in
  comparative brightness we made our camp in a cluster of good-size trees. I
  think that Sylvia was less exhausted than her father and I. At least she was
  able to smile and find some small thing to laugh about, and she taunted us
  too for not having overtaken her. King, she announced, was worth a whole team
  of ordinary dogs, and to this we were both inclined to agree.</p>

  <p>One day after another we slogged along on the trail, and it was Sylvia's
  good spirits more than food that sustained us. She seemed made of iron
  actually. She was throwing herself into that competition against two men with
  all the will in the world. When we camped, her delightful voice scattered the
  blue demons that attend a camp of melancholy silence.</p>

  <p>A storm caught us on the broad breast of Lake Labarge just as we were
  making good progress over the ice and promising ourselves that the end of the
  journey was not far off. The wind came in a hurricane, heavy with snow and
  sleet, and whipped us in a pelting run to find shelter at the margin of the
  ice sheet. Behind the first low promontory we crouched, with the force of the
  wind broken a little and a chance to breathe and rest. Through the brush we
  looked out at the milky exhalations of the snowstorm, whirling into great
  forms, dissolving, reforming again.</p>

  <p>It was bitterly cold. Our feet were wet and threatening to freeze if we
  remained long inactive, and Baird suggested that we work farther back into
  the woods and make a fire in the first shelter so that we could dry out our
  things. A low cry from Sylvia stopped him. She was pointing out into the
  heart of the open storm and, as she pointed, she crouched lower.</p>

  <p>We stared in the direction indicated and, as we stared, we saw a rift in
  the flying sleet and snow and through the rift four dogs hauling head down in
  front of a sled, and at the gee pole of the sled strode the driver. How could
  we recognize a man at a distance and in that dim light? It was a very simple
  matter. People on snowshoes move most variously. I've said that Sylvia seemed
  to be dancing along on them, there was such grace and rhythm in her step.
  This fellow strode like a machine of inexhaustible power. No one whoever had
  seen him on the march could have forgotten that step and that carriage.
  Besides, his whole silhouette differed. Just as one can tell by outline
  whether it is a fox, a coyote, or a wolf that is standing on the rim of the
  distant hill, so we could tell, of all the world of men, this could be no
  other than Cobalt! What other man, in fact, would have been able to make dogs
  face such a wind? What other man would have been willing to put his face
  against such a storm? It was Cobalt, yonder, passing us as if in the dimness
  of a dream.</p>

  <p>We shrank down to the ice and lay still. Only after a long moment did we
  breathe freely again and, when I saw the face of the girl, she looked as
  though she had just awakened from a nightmare. So felt we all, I know, by
  consulting my own heart.</p>

  <p>"By right," said Sylvia slowly, "I should have gone out to him."</p>

  <p>"By right," answered her father savagely, "you shouldn't be a fool, my
  dear."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, this remark of hers gave him something to think about. He
  talked it over with me later on at the end of that day's work when, the storm
  having cleared, we camped. We agreed that Sylvia, if her chance was fair,
  would still feel herself impelled by a sense of duty to go to Cobalt and take
  the consequences. There was only one thing to do, and that was to push ahead
  and trust to the blind luck which had helped us so far on the march. It might
  be that Cobalt had gone for the Chilkoot, to cross down to Dyea. It might be
  that he was to take our way over the longer White Horse. However, both of
  these places were close together. A canoe would fetch him around the point
  that separated them, and he could make inquiries on both sides. Then he would
  wait for us, but where?</p>

  <p>Perhaps he would guess Dyea. Then he might be there as we slipped down
  into Skagway and, getting into Skagway, we might find a ship ready to sail
  and so leave him behind us. But only for the time. We could not really trust
  that such a man as Cobalt would be thrown off the trail so easily. He would
  be certain to follow in the next steamer any ship we departed in, then he
  would pick up our trail from the first port and follow us on land. Well, that
  horror was postponed at least and, once back in the true realm of law and
  order, we could hope that a power even greater than his own would take him in
  hand.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; SHELTER AT LAST</h2>

  <p class="first">When we came through the pass down to Skagway and the gray
  ocean lay level before us, we fell to laughing and shouting and flopping
  about on our snowshoes in a ridiculous way. The very feeling of the air was
  different, and the wind that blew into us from over the inlet and the great
  Pacific beyond was warm to us, so warm in comparison with the freezing
  weather of the great inland plateau that we wanted to get into lighter
  clothing at once. You may believe that we came down the last slopes with a
  will. When we got into the little town, we stared at the buildings as though
  each were the face of a friend. They seemed like flesh and spirit and
  kindliness, though as a matter of fact kindliness was rather at a premium in
  Skagway as we were soon to learn.</p>

  <p>At that time of year it was a fair day in Skagway. The wind had blown warm
  for some time, the snow had grown soft, and the street we went down was a bog
  of mud. We had to abandon the sleds and take what little we needed from the
  loads upon our backs in hastily made packs. But we minded neither the burden
  on our shoulders nor the mud through which we were sloshing. We were near the
  end of the journey, and our spirits were so high that we hardly cared whether
  we met with Cobalt or not. We had pushed through to a decision that only was
  important.</p>

  <p>We got to a hotel. You might rather call it a caravansary, or one-night
  tavern. At any rate there was shelter over our heads, food to be had, food
  cooked by hands other than our own, and no more of the piercing cold blasts
  of the wind. Only a few chill drafts slid under badly fitted doors or through
  cracks in walls and touched us in the feet or the small of the back. I verily
  believe that such drafts cause a thousandfold more deaths than the fierce,
  open attack of the storms upon the vast, frozen tundra. At that moment we saw
  nothing evil. Everything was indeed good to us.</p>

  <p>Our first inquiry was about Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"Has Cobalt come in?" I asked.</p>

  <p>The proprietor of the hotel was one of those men who always seem to be
  dressed in the clothes of five years before, so that they are swelling out of
  the old pattern. He had a double chin, a dark look, and a half-smoked cigar
  stuck in a corner of his mouth. That part of the mouth never stirred when he
  spoke. But he did not need to use it. There was plenty of lip yardage
  remaining. The cigar looked to me as though it might be a relic from the
  party of the night before.</p>

  <p>"Has Cobalt come in?" I said to this red-eyed hulk in his bulging coat and
  collarless shirt.</p>

  <p>He was looking at Sylvia as I spoke. No man could help looking at Sylvia
  and, with the wolf alongside, she was something to stop the heart. The
  monster had no eye for anything but her apparently, and yet no one was
  deceived. Every man in the room knew dogs, I suppose, in a big or a little
  way, and every man was intent on the points of this giant, yet no one came
  near.</p>

  <p>Instead of answering me, the proprietor said: "Is that an all-white
  Newfoundland?"</p>

  <p>"I guess that's what it is," I said. "Has Cobalt come in?"</p>

  <p>"Come where?" he said without looking at me.</p>

  <p>"To town&mdash;to Skagway," I said. "This is Skagway, I take it?" For he
  irritated me, the fat-faced beast, slowly getting a new lip hold on the
  foul-smelling cigar butt.</p>

  <p>"Yeah!" he said, hardly hearing me. "And Cobalt. Who's Cobalt, buddy?"</p>

  <p>I was staggered, not at all by his insolence, since men grow accustomed to
  the most brutal discourtesy in the wilderness of the North, but because I saw
  that he was not affecting this ignorance. He really did not know the name of
  Cobalt. He never had heard of the man before this moment! I was properly
  shocked, for in the Northern camps Cobalt was such a familiar name in the
  most casual conversation that one could hardly get through the evening
  without some reference to him. Dogs and weather and even gold hardly got more
  attention than Cobalt. But here I had returned to a part of the world where
  Cobalt was not known.</p>

  <p>Not entirely unknown, of course, but Skagway had grown. People were coming
  in from the outside in numbers, and there is nothing like a cheechako for
  ignorance in all things wherein he should be the most concerned. I went back
  to Baird with my information.</p>

  <p>"He never heard of Cobalt," I said.</p>

  <p>Baird shook his head. "He's lying. Nobody this far north can grow up
  without knowing something about Cobalt. He's lying. He looks like a
  liar."</p>

  <p>"He looks like anything you want to call him," I returned, "but he doesn't
  know Cobalt. He was telling the truth. We'll have to ask somebody else. In
  the meantime get some rooms. You get the rooms, and I'll go out and circulate
  a little."</p>

  <p>Baird looked me up and down critically. "Are you packing a gun, Tom?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want a gun," I told him, and I meant it. For, if I met with
  Cobalt, no skill of mine could save me. He was far too fast and accurate with
  shooting irons.</p>

  <p>We got a room for Sylvia and another for her father and me. While he
  arranged the packs and had the luxury of a bath and a shave, I went out with
  my trail beard still on my face and tried to hunt up information about
  Cobalt. I went into the first saloon. It was a big affair and worked up a
  good deal for that far north. It had some long mirrors behind the bar and
  gilded lamps, and there were gaming tables covered with green felt. I gave
  that felt a good long look until I saw how the nap was worn and knew that a
  lot of money was trotted out on those green lawns from time to time. It
  excited me a deal. Wherever there is heavy gambling, there is likely to be
  danger in the air, and the look of that saloon already was hostile enough,
  though only a few fellows were sitting in at a poker game in a corner of the
  gaming room.</p>

  <p>The bartender had a decent look, from a distance, and I decided that I
  would try to pump him. When I got closer to him, however, I saw that my first
  flash had been all wrong. He was blond and slender and small, with a
  retreating chin and a buck-toothed grin that flashed like a silver dollar in
  the sun. As I approached him, I could see why they trusted that bar to his
  keeping even in Skagway. He kept right on smiling, but his eye was as cold as
  a gray January morning.</p>

  <p>I ordered a drink and offered him one himself. He thanked me and poured
  half a thimbleful of liquor into the bottom of his glass. I had not opened
  the door of his confidence by buying that drink. I could have bought a barrel
  full of whiskey without buying his confidence because there was no confidence
  in him.</p>

  <p>"Is Cobalt in town?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"Cobalt who?" said the bartender. "Or what Cobalt?"</p>

  <p>I looked hard at him, but I saw that he meant what he said. They didn't
  know Cobalt in Skagway.</p>

  <p>"If he comes in," I could not help saying, "you'll learn a lot about
  Cobalt on the jump. That's all!"</p>

  <p>I was ready to turn away when the barkeep reached over the bar and touched
  me on the arm. "What's all this play about Cobalt, brother?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I asked you about the toughest man in Alaska," I said, "and you ask me
  right back for his front name. I tell you, there's no other name for him.
  What's the matter with you? You look normal, but to hear you talk a fellow
  would think that you never knew anything but newspapers."</p>

  <p>He listened to this little denunciation with quite an air of interest. He
  glanced me over in a casual way, very much as though he were saying: <i>Shall
  I rap this loon over the head or not?</i></p>

  <p>"This Cobalt," he said, "must be quite a card."</p>

  <p>"He's not a card. He's a whole deck," I said.</p>

  <p>"What's his specialty?" asked the barkeep.</p>

  <p>"Bending iron bars into hairpins," I said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, one of these strong men, is he?" That tough youth yawned at me.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's one of these strong men," I said. "With a slap of his open hand
  he breaks your jaw, and he smashes the wrist of the gunman just with his
  grip."</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut," said the bartender, "does his mamma know about these
  things?"</p>

  <p>"You're hard-boiled, my boy," I said, "but, when Cobalt arrives, you'll be
  able to tell what's in the can by the label on it."</p>

  <p>"Pineapple," guessed the barkeep.</p>

  <p>He amused me. He was as calm and as cool as iced tea. He kept that buck-
  toothed smile flashing at me all the time until I was afraid that he would
  cut the corners of his mouth. "Well," I said, "I'm not his press agent."</p>

  <p>"I was just wondering," said the barkeep.</p>

  <p>At this I laughed openly and loudly. This bartender, boy though he was,
  was so entirely and perfectly tough from rind to core that he tickled
  something in me.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Hay fever," I said. "It just comes on me now and then."</p>

  <p>His eye grew more friendly. For the first time a wrinkle or two came
  beside it. He seemed to be almost amused.</p>

  <p>"Tell me one thing," I said.</p>

  <p>"Mostly they don't ask for it like you do," he replied.</p>

  <p>"What I want is information."</p>

  <p>"Lay out your goods, brother. I gotta take something home for little
  Minnie."</p>

  <p>"I guessed by your kind eye that you had children at home."</p>

  <p>"You guessed wrong. Minnie's a cross-eyed cat that I'm trying to get
  straight."</p>

  <p>I laughed in my turn. "Here's my question. What's Skagway? I've been here
  before. But what's Skagway now?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; TOMMY'S AGE</h2>

  <p class="first">The barkeep ran a finger inside the collar of his shirt and
  looked me up and down. He seemed so little interested that I should not have
  been surprised to see him turn away from me, but he did not turn away. He
  decided that he would answer. Without a movement of the head, without a
  gesture, he fixed his fishy eyes on me and said: "Over there at the table,
  that's Skagway."</p>

  <p>I looked them over. It was the table of poker players of which I have
  spoken. There was a bearded man just off the trail apparently, sitting deeply
  in his chair with a gloomy, bulldog look. There was a tall man, thin as a
  knife blade, with hands that moved so fast they blurred the eye. There was a
  chap with angling eyebrows. He kept his head down most of the time, and he
  had a way of looking up from under the brows like a Mephistopheles. The
  fourth man looked like a pig, not the domestic kind, but a wild boar whose
  fat was ninety percent muscle. The fifth had a bald head, a black beard, and
  a white face. He might have been a minister, he kept his head so high and his
  eyes so low.</p>

  <p>"You mean the preacher yonder?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

  <p>"Because he's ten years younger than he looks."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's Soapy Jones. That's Skagway, too, as you can take for
  granted."</p>

  <p>"I've been inside for a long time," I answered. "Perhaps I'm out of
  date."</p>

  <p>My friend drummed on the edge of the bar with light, rapid fingers. "Have
  a drink on me and tell me how you learned to keep your face."</p>

  <p>"I mean it," I said earnestly. "I haven't seen many newspapers."</p>

  <p>"You're asking me for a lot of faith, brother, but I'll tell you
  something. When they go out walking in Skagway, they leave their pokes at
  home."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," I said. "I begin to understand. He's not alone&mdash;Soapy?"</p>

  <p>"No, he's got a full deck."</p>

  <p>I went back to the hotel and found the Lightning Warrior and Baird in
  Sylvia's room. I sat down and talked things over with them.</p>

  <p>"Skagway is wide open," I told them, "and the chief thing inside is a
  fellow named Soapy Jones. He works with a big gang, and he runs the town.
  He's the big boy here. I can't get any information about Cobalt. It may be
  that he is here now, lying low and waiting for us. It may be that he's at
  Dyea. It may be that he's already gone on to Vancouver or San Francisco to
  meet us at the dock. Any of those things may have happened. In the meantime
  we'd better lie low in our turn and wait for the boat. This ought to keep us
  amused."</p>

  <p>I pointed toward the wolf. My move was a little too sudden, and he flashed
  from his corner half way across the room to meet my gesture. He made not a
  sound, but the silent beast was ready to leap at my throat. Sylvia spoke one
  word, and he sank at her feet, but he still kept those wicked blue eyes fixed
  on me.</p>

  <p>I went downstairs, got some hot water in a kettle, and a big laundry tub.
  Then I went back to my room, shaved, stripped, and gave myself a bath. It had
  to be a scrub, I can tell you. When I finished scrubbing and rinsing, I felt
  lighter, and I looked lighter. I stared at myself in a small, cracked mirror
  that hung on the wall, and I saw that I wore a mask of tan that covered my
  forehead, eyes, nose, and cheekbones. But all the lower part of my face was
  white as could be. That was the effect of the beard which had grown out upon
  the long trail. That mask of tan had a strange effect. It really gave me the
  look of a robber, and this amused me so much that I laughed a little out
  loud. I was neither very big, very strong, nor very bold, but the white and
  the tan made me seem a fairly dangerous fellow.</p>

  <p>When I joined Sylvia and Baird for a meal a little later, they both
  laughed at me. The Lightning Warrior merely snarled. Sylvia put down her hand
  and slapped him until he was silent, but he kept on watching me. I never had
  manhandled him or even given him bad language, but he had built up a growing
  hatred for me during the outward march. The beast was human in his sympathies
  and antipathies.</p>

  <p>What a meal we had! Not that Skagway offered much beyond meat and coffee,
  but the coffee was a change from tea. It tasted like nectar to us all, and we
  finished off with plum jam in quantities on fresh baker's bread. Afterward we
  sat around for a while, Baird and I smoking. Sylvia came out of her dreams to
  talk a bit. She began to put questions to me.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Tom, why you never talk about yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I talk enough," I said.</p>

  <p>"I mean about your past life."</p>

  <p>"Well, on the inside, a man's a bore if he begins to talk about his
  home."</p>

  <p>"I used to talk about mine," she said.</p>

  <p>"You're different, Sylvia. You could talk about anything," I assured
  her.</p>

  <p>She shook her head at the compliment. "I used to talk about everything,
  from the pet canaries to my poor old pinto, Jerry, and the story of Champ
  Allison at the rodeo and everything."</p>

  <p>"You could tell them all over again, and I'd sit as still as a mouse
  eating bread and butter and listen. Start now, and I'll prove it."</p>

  <p>"Tom, do you think that I'm such a baby?"</p>

  <p>"You're not a baby, Sylvia. You're a great big grown-up woman. That's what
  you are."</p>

  <p>Baird laughed a little. Then he got behind a newspaper he had bought and
  began to grunt and cluck from time to time with surprise and interest as he
  read the items. It left Sylvia and me alone, and I stood up.</p>

  <p>"If you'll excuse me, Sylvia," I said, "I'm going to go up and take a
  nap."</p>

  <p>"You sit down again, Tom," she commanded. "You can't run away now. I've
  got you safely here. This isn't inside. This is outside. And you're not
  sleepy. You're only nervous. That's why you want to get away."</p>

  <p>I sat down again gingerly. "Oh, what's the matter, Sylvia?" I queried. "I
  won't be able to tell you as much as the back page of that newspaper."</p>

  <p>She looked at me. I began to feel worried and cornered.</p>

  <p>"Everybody else used to talk to me," she said, "but you always dodged. Why
  do you dodge, Tom? Have you got a black spot?"</p>

  <p>"You can call it that." I would have agreed to anything to avoid
  argument.</p>

  <p>That girl had the most impish persistence. She looked me over calmly. The
  assurance of a pretty girl is an amazing thing. "How old are you, Tom?"</p>

  <p>"I'm middle-aged, my dear."</p>

  <p>"Fortyish or fiftyish?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, fortyish, around about."</p>

  <p>"Mostly around, and not about. Why won't you tell me? I'll tell you my
  age."</p>

  <p>"I know."</p>

  <p>"What am I, then?"</p>

  <p>"Eighteen, last summer."</p>

  <p>"Humph. No wonder you talk to me like a baby. I'm twenty-two."</p>

  <p>"Stuff!"</p>

  <p>"Ask Dad if I'm not. Dad, how old am I?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" responded Baird, involved in finding the continuation
  of a long article.</p>

  <p>Sylvia frowned, then she smiled. "Well, I'm nearly twenty-one, anyway. Now
  you tell me how old you are, Tom."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to get out of this."</p>

  <p>"You sit where you are. If you get up and go, I'll tag along."</p>

  <p>"Oh, leave Tommy alone," growled Baird. "Leave him alone, can't you?
  You're a torment, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"I'm not flirting with Mister Chalmers. He's forty-something. I don't
  flirt with middle-aged men."</p>

  <p>"Hum!" said Baird, looking over the edge of his paper at her with a scowl.
  "You don't, don't you? Since when, please? You'd flirt with Father Time. You
  make me a little tired, Sylvia. Stop the nonsense and run along."</p>

  <p>"Will you run with me, Tommy?" Sylvia suggested.</p>

  <p>"Confound it, Sylvia," I said, "what's the matter with you? Can't you
  leave me alone?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it undignified&mdash;to call you Tommy? Is that why you're
  angry?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not angry."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are. You said 'Confound it!' and you frowned at me."</p>

  <p>"I'll say worse than that. Leave me alone, Sylvia. You're a young demon,
  and I won't let you make a fool out of me."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're talking about. I only asked you how old you
  are."</p>

  <p>"Well, I've told you."</p>

  <p>"You haven't at all. Let me guess."</p>

  <p>"I can't keep you from it."</p>

  <p>"You're twenty-seven," she said, after thinking for a moment.</p>

  <p>I pushed my chair back a little. "Great Scott, my dear, where's your sense
  of humor? Twenty-seven? With a growing family? Well, well!"</p>

  <p>I grew rather hot, but Sylvia did not mind in the least.</p>

  <p>"You may be a bit older than that. But not more than thirty, I know."</p>

  <p>"The deuce you do. I'm not thirty, eh? And you're sure, are you?"</p>

  <p>"I can always tell."</p>

  <p>"Perfect rot. How could you tell?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, by a certain sign&mdash;it never fails."</p>

  <p>"What sign? I never heard of such nonsense!" I was getting still hotter at
  the way she sat back, assured and certain.</p>

  <p>"By the wrinkles around the eyes. You haven't any, hardly. You're not more
  than twenty-eight&mdash;about."</p>

  <p>I banged my fist on my knee. "I tell you what, you bright young thing. I'm
  thirty-two years and three months and four days old. There you are with your
  infallible signs!"</p>

  <p>She leaned forward with a little gesture of interest and compassion. "Oh,
  Tommy, are you only thirty-two? Are you really only thirty-two, poor
  fellow?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; SYLVIA AT WORK</h2>

  <p class="first">When I saw how neatly she had trapped me, I grew hotter than
  ever in the face. Baird noticed the moment of silence and glanced at me.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter now?" he asked. "Are you two fighting?"</p>

  <p>"She's got a long way past that," I answered. "She's started pitying
  me."</p>

  <p>"Look out for her," said Baird, yawning, and went back to his paper.</p>

  <p>"I'm not pitying you," protested Sylvia. "I mean I'm only being sorry that
  you've had so much pain."</p>

  <p>"I really wish you'd stop, Sylvia. I'm a little tired of it."</p>

  <p>"I know. People don't like to talk about sorrow and all that. I didn't
  mean to intrude on you, Tommy. I do humbly beg your pardon. Tell me that
  you're not offended?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not offended, and you don't have to be so starry eyed about it. Do
  your rehearsing with somebody else, will you? I'm too old to enjoy the
  sport."</p>

  <p>"Don't you know, Tommy, that a girl much prefers an older man, somebody
  that's stable, with greater experience and knowledge of life? Don't you
  really know that, you strange fellow?"</p>

  <p>"You treacherous little cat. You mouse eater, you! Take your claws away
  from me."</p>

  <p>Sylvia leaned back in her chair, sighed, and shook her head. "Oh, Tommy,"
  she murmured, "you don't understand me a bit!"</p>

  <p>"Only a few footnotes," I admitted. "The text is in a foreign language.
  I'm not a scholar in your sense of the word, Sylvia. Not a bit."</p>

  <p>Baird stood up. "I'm going out to have a look around," he said.</p>

  <p>"I'll go with you," I proposed.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be left here all alone," said Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"Then you come along," said Baird.</p>

  <p>"I'm too tired. I'm worn out. Are you going to leave me, Tommy?
  Please!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, plague take it. I suppose I'll stay."</p>

  <p>Baird grinned down at her with a wise and understanding twinkle in his
  eyes. "You watch her, Tom," he warned. "She's poison, slow but sure."</p>

  <p>"What a way to talk!" said Sylvia.</p>

  <p>Baird went out the door, turning up the collar of his coat, and tucking
  the newspaper under his arm.</p>

  <p>"The thing to do," I said, "is not to march aboard the boat when it comes
  in. He might be watching. We can take a canoe and go on board after it's
  started south and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke in on me dreamily. "How old are your two children, Tommy?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, let me see. Seven and five. Why? I was saying about the boat
  that&mdash;," I started off again.</p>

  <p>"Seven and five! That's a charming time. It's the boy who's seven?"</p>

  <p>"No, it's the girl."</p>

  <p>"That's a pity. Girls need older brothers."</p>

  <p>"She's an independent youngster."</p>

  <p>"What's her name?"</p>

  <p>"Celia."</p>

  <p>"That's a charming name. And the little boy?"</p>

  <p>"Bill."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet he's a man!"</p>

  <p>"He's kind of cross-eyed."</p>

  <p>"Which is their mother's favorite?"</p>

  <p>I looked at her for a moment before I answered, gathering myself a little.
  "Their mother died when Bill was born," I told her at last.</p>

  <p>Her face puckered up with pain. Then, suddenly realizing why I had wished
  to avoid this conversation, she caught her hands together with a faint
  cry.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," I assured her. "I don't mind. I ought to talk about her.
  It does me good."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Tommy, why should life have hurt you like that?"</p>

  <p>"A harmless little fellow like me?"</p>

  <p>"She meant a frightful lot to you? Her name was Celia also?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. She was one of the best. She was about the best."</p>

  <p>"Was she a lovely girl, Tommy?"</p>

  <p>"No, not lovely. She could have done with a little more nose and a little
  less mouth. But her heart was right. She never yipped during the pinch of the
  hard times."</p>

  <p>"That's why you're up here, Tommy&mdash;to try to get for the youngsters
  what their mother never had?"</p>

  <p>"In a general way."</p>

  <p>"But you've chucked that in order to help me. That's what you've
  done!"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly. I've got a pretty good stake now. Close to sixty
  thousand. I know some range land I want. Thirty thousand will get me the
  grazing land. I know where it's cheap. The rest goes into a shack and barns,
  horses and cows. You know? A small beginning and a lot of hard work but
  youngsters turn out well in a life like that."</p>

  <p>"Is that your ambition?" she asked dreamily.</p>

  <p>"Yes. To develop my own strain of tough ranch stock, horses and cows. To
  have my brand known. To spread the elbows of my outfit on the range. To make
  a garden. Improve the house. See the kids grow up, wild but straight. That's
  about my whole ambition. You see, I'm a simple fellow, Sylvia. I'm not one to
  set the world on fire or take it by the hair of the head."</p>

  <p>I was amazed to see moisture in her eyes. "I'd better go upstairs and
  leave you. I'm going to be crying over you in another minute."</p>

  <p>"Great Scott, Sylvia, what's the matter? Are you pitying a poor fellow who
  can be contented with a few acres of bare range land and a few cows bawling
  on them on a winter's day? Yes, you're pitying me. You're thinking of
  something else."</p>

  <p>"You tell me what I'm thinking of." She put her head on one side, not
  archly but in grave thought, with her eyes almost closed, so that the blue of
  them was lost and there was only the black shadow of the lashes curving.</p>

  <p>I said: "You're thinking of Fifth Avenue shops and houses that have
  Persian rugs on the floor, the real quill, and country houses with hunters in
  the pasture, and ocean liners to link you up with Nice and Seville and
  Oxford, and all that."</p>

  <p>"Look, Tommy&mdash;" She pushed back the hair from her temple and let me
  see the beginning of a white scar. She raised her sleeves, and I saw another
  cut on her arm, the white sign of it.</p>

  <p>"That top one is where a mustang's shoe grazed me. The one on the arm I
  got from a mesquite thorn, going lickety split&mdash;you know how!"</p>

  <p>"I know how!" I agreed. "By jiminy, Sylvia, I never thought of you as a
  ranch girl, but you'd make something to fill the eye, all right. I'd like to
  see you ride over the rim of the world."</p>

  <p>"Where's the rim of that old world?" she asked, smiling at me and
  wrinkling her eyes a little.</p>

  <p>"Right on the land I'm going to buy. That's why I'm going to buy it,
  because it's the top rim of the world. You'd look grand riding over the
  eyebrow of Talking Mountain."</p>

  <p>"Look, Tommy, you know what I can do?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty, but go on. You tell me."</p>

  <p>"I can ride. I can ride 'em straight up. And I can fan 'em, too."</p>

  <p>"Aw, go on. You can land on your head, too."</p>

  <p>"You bet I can, and you bet I have. I'm not bragging, but don't you go
  thinking that I'm so <i>crêpe de Chine</i>."</p>

  <p>"I saw you on the march. You're tough enough, all right."</p>

  <p>"Go on and laugh at me, but you said that I'd tie up with Nice and Seville
  and Oxford. What would I want to be doing in Oxford? Feeding the swans in the
  gardens? I'd rather be out daubing a rope on a yearling."</p>

  <p>"Go on! You couldn't daub a rope."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't I just?" She crowed with indignant protest. "I could go and daub
  a rope right with you, Tom Chalmers, I'll bet."</p>

  <p>"I'm not much, but I've got a big brother that can do a day's work, all
  right."</p>

  <p>All at once she leaned back in her chair and began to chuckle. It began
  away back in her throat, and it just bubbled and bubbled.</p>

  <p>"Why, Tommy, you're not so serious after all. You're fun!"</p>

  <p>"Don't stop laughing, Sylvia. You look great. I like to see you laugh with
  me or at me. When I get Talking Mountain, you come and we'll have that ride.
  You can daub that old rope, too. I'll bet you throw it underhand, like any
  Mexican."</p>

  <p>"And overhand," she said with pride. Then she grew serious. "But don't you
  be sidetracked. You hold out for Talking Mountain. You keep heading that
  way."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I may be sidetracked?"</p>

  <p>She sat very still, her chin on her brown fist, and studied me. Her eyes
  were as blue as one of those little mountain lakes that drink up the whole
  sky in an acre of water. "Oh, I'm afraid you've been sidetracked a good many
  times."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I admitted, "I've always been beaten. I've always been a bust."</p>

  <p>"Because you've tied to the wrong people!"</p>

  <p>"Except one."</p>

  <p>"I wish I had known her. I would have loved her. It makes me pretty sick
  at heart when I think of you, Tommy, up here in the North and the two
  youngsters down there."</p>

  <p>"I left them pretty well heeled."</p>

  <p>"I don't mean that, but all they're missing, and all you're
  missing&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>Baird came in then and stood over us. "Has she been working on you all
  this time, Tom?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said. "I'm a little dizzy, but I feel like a new man now. What
  have you seen?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen him," said Baird.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; PRODDING A MEMORY</h2>

  <p class="first">I thought Baird was joking because of the casual way in
  which he had first spoken but, when I looked up to him, I saw the pupils of
  his eyes staring as though he had just come in out of pitchy darkness. He was
  thoroughly wrought up, and he showed it. Sylvia and I stood up.</p>

  <p>We huddled off upstairs to the room which belonged to Baird and to me, and
  there we sat in a mute and wretched conference. Baird told how he had seen a
  crowd of a dozen men just landed from Dyea, and among them he recognized the
  head, the shoulders, and the springing step of Cobalt. He drew back into the
  mouth of a small alley and watched the group go by. It was Cobalt beyond a
  doubt. He had seen his face.</p>

  <p>When we heard this story, we sat for another long moment in silence. I
  remember that the Lightning Warrior chose this instant to stand up, stretch,
  and yawn, and then couch himself again at the feet of the girl. He seemed to
  know something keenly affecting her was under consideration.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said at last bitterly, "all that we can do is to lie low."</p>

  <p>"He's sure to find us out," said Sylvia sensibly. "In a town of this size,
  every coming and going is pretty well noted."</p>

  <p>This was plain.</p>

  <p>"This end of the town will get to know Cobalt for the first time," I
  reflected. "The next time I ask about him, they'll recognize the name at
  least. I suppose that's only a pale consolation, but I'd like to see him in
  action against some of the thugs of Soapy Jones. He'll break up a few of them
  like kindling wood."</p>

  <p>"Soapy Jones? Soapy Jones?" murmured Baird. He fell into deep meditation.
  "I've heard of him before."</p>

  <p>"Of course you have. Tom told us about him when he came in this morning,"
  Sylvia put in.</p>

  <p>"I've heard of him before that," said Baird. "I heard of him in Spokane
  one winter, if I'm not mistaken. I'm curious to find out&mdash;I'm going to
  find out now!" He got out of his chair.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to find out?" we asked him.</p>

  <p>"Well, you'll see. Maybe there's a way out for us after all."</p>

  <p>He seemed excited and very keen. We let him go without further protest and
  since what he did that day was important so important that all that followed
  hinged upon it it will be best to follow his steps to discover, as we
  discovered later, what he did.</p>

  <p>He went straight down to the saloon in which I had seen Soapy and the four
  men who were playing poker. The place was nearly empty now. Soapy and the
  rest of the poker players were out of sight. Only two lumbermen were off at
  an end of the bar, bending over their drinks and talking mournfully of the
  good days in the great logging camps and lamenting this miserable North
  country.</p>

  <p>Baird beckoned the bartender down to the place where he stood, and he
  looked into the pale-gray eyes of the little man. "I want to see Soapy
  Jones."</p>

  <p>"Do you?" replied the barkeep. "Wait a minute." He felt in one pocket and
  then in another. "I don't seem to have him about me. I must have left him at
  home on the shelf."</p>

  <p>I can imagine how he would have said all that, and the sneering, steady
  way in which he would look into the eyes of poor Baird. The latter was
  stumped.</p>

  <p>"Hold on a minute," he said. "Could you send a message to him for me?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno," said the barkeep, beginning to polish the bar with a soiled
  towel. "We don't keep many messenger boys around here. What sort of a
  message?"</p>

  <p>"Five words."</p>

  <p>"What are the words?"</p>

  <p>"These: 'Do you remember Digger Merchant?'"</p>

  <p>The barkeep considered for a moment. "I don't know you," he said then.</p>

  <p>"He does, I think," assured Baird.</p>

  <p>The little man made up his mind. He called to one of the lumbermen:
  "Buck!"</p>

  <p>"Well?" answered Buck.</p>

  <p>"Go find Soapy and tell him that there's a man here asking: 'Do you
  remember Digger Merchant?'"</p>

  <p>"What's a digger merchant?" asked Buck, looking for the point of the joke
  with a scowl.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about that," insisted the barkeep. "You hop and find Soapy and
  tell him what I've told you. If anybody starts following you when you're on
  the way, come right back here." He looked darkly at Baird as he said
  this.</p>

  <p>The other lumberman showed signs of wishing to be friendly, but Baird
  retired to a corner to wait. He sat there for a full hour. The time of good
  business arrived. Another barman joined him of the buck teeth. A crowd began
  to seep in. New lamps were lighted. All at once there was the reek of cheap
  whiskey in the air. The floor and the ceiling were sweating with moisture.
  Around the big stove in the center of the room men were standing to dry
  themselves or for sheer need of warmth. Baird stuck in his cold, dim corner
  and waited. He stared continually through the wraiths of tobacco smoke
  expecting each minute to see the celebrated Soapy.</p>

  <p>Someone stood suddenly beside his chair. "Who are you?" asked a voice.</p>

  <p>Baird looked up at a long black beard and a bald head, curiously pale and
  polished. He rose. "My name is Baird. Are you Soapy Jones?"</p>

  <p>"I'm Soapy Jones," said the ministerial presence. "What is this about
  Digger Merchant?"</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't remember me. I don't remember your face, either. You weren't
  wearing that beard when I last saw you."</p>

  <p>"Where was I?"</p>

  <p>"You were lying in the middle of the road with four bullet holes in you.
  You were sopping with blood. That was four miles from Spokane."</p>

  <p>Soapy Jones looked at the other intently. He wound his long white fingers
  into the black of his curling beard and hung the weight of his arm upon
  it.</p>

  <p>"Come along with me. We'll talk," Soapy said.</p>

  <p>He led Baird into the rear of the saloon. There he unlocked a door and
  admitted him into a small room, a mere closet, for there was only one window,
  very small and close to the ceiling. A screen hanging in front of this
  aperture prevented any eye from looking in from the outside. In the closet
  there were two chairs and nothing else by way of furniture.</p>

  <p>"Now we can talk," said Soapy. "Sit down."</p>

  <p>He took one chair. Baird accepted the other. Both of their faces were in
  shadow from the light of the lantern which was bracketed against one wall.
  Only a high light gleamed steadily upon the bald head of Soapy.</p>

  <p><i>How many other men had sat in this room with the gangster?</i> wondered
  Baird. He began to grow a little nervous for the eye of Soapy would never let
  him go.</p>

  <p>"When you saw me lying there in the road, as you say," Soapy took up the
  conversation, "what did you do?"</p>

  <p>"I got you into the back of the buckboard I was driving and headed for
  town as fast as I could drive. You were bleeding to death."</p>

  <p>"Go on." The eyes of Soapy were eyes unchanging as he listened.</p>

  <p>"After I'd gone half a mile," continued Baird, "I decided that the blood
  was running out of you too fast. You wouldn't last until we reached a doctor.
  So I stopped and got off your clothes. I cut them away for the sake of speed.
  I used your clothes to tie up the wounds."</p>

  <p>"Where were they?"</p>

  <p>"Two through the body. One looked as though it went straight through your
  lungs. But you were not choking with blood. Two more were through the right
  thigh, and the thigh bone was broken. I put a tourniquet above the wound in
  the leg. That stopped the bleeding. Then I covered you with the buggy rug and
  went on. I got you to a doctor on the edge of town."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Soapy urged again.</p>

  <p>"That's all. I left you there and went on. I had important business ahead
  of me."</p>

  <p>"You could have heard of all this," said Soapy.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Perhaps I could."</p>

  <p>"What you say is not worth anything. You could have heard it all."</p>

  <p>"I'll give you proof. One bullet had cut through your wallet. Cut through
  it at the lower edge. The wallet was sopping with blood."</p>

  <p>"You could have heard about that, too."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I could have heard about that, I suppose, but I didn't. I saw
  it."</p>

  <p>"Where there any initials on that wallet?"</p>

  <p>"There were."</p>

  <p>"What were they?"</p>

  <p>"I don't remember."</p>

  <p>"The first question I ask you, and you don't know the answer."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't remember the initials. One of them had been clipped off by a
  bullet."</p>

  <p>"You remember that, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was the middle initial."</p>

  <p>Soapy Jones turned his eyes up to the ceiling in thought. "I think you're
  straight," he said at last. "Now what do you want out of me?"</p>

  <p>Not a word of gratitude, mind you. The man was as practical as a
  banker.</p>

  <p>"I want help," answered Baird.</p>

  <p>Soapy waved his hand. "Of course you do. What kind of help?"</p>

  <p>"A kind that will cost a lot of trouble."</p>

  <p>"Partner," said Soapy Jones, without the slightest warmth in his voice,
  "I've never had a chum, but I've never let a friend down, and I've never let
  an enemy off. I'm logical, and I'm logical now. You can have anything that
  belongs to me, from my gun to my wallet. You have the cards. Deal any sort of
  a hand that you think fit&mdash;and you can pick them off the bottom."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; THIS IS FRIENDSHIP</h2>

  <p class="first">The unmoved, the indifferent manner of Soapy Jones when he
  made these large proffers was what convinced my friend, Baird, that there was
  something in him that might be trusted. He thanked Soapy. The latter merely
  shrugged his shoulders, as though all he offered should really be taken for
  granted in the normal course of events.</p>

  <p>Baird said: "What I'm going to ask you to do is probably harder than
  anything you've ever undertaken before."</p>

  <p>Soapy merely smiled. He never appeared weary, and he never appeared
  excited. Except that his eyes were dark, they were something like Cobalt's,
  bright and steady.</p>

  <p>"There's a man in this town named Cobalt."</p>

  <p>"I've heard of him," Soapy said. "He's usually inside. He's a hard nut.
  I've heard something about him. He breaks men up when he gets into a fight.
  Is that the one?"</p>

  <p>"That's the one."</p>

  <p>"Well, he won't break me up."</p>

  <p>"I would like to have Cobalt kept in hand for two days&mdash;until the
  next steamer sails south. Do you think you could manage that?"</p>

  <p>"I'll manage it so that he'll lose all interest in sailings south or
  north."</p>

  <p>"I don't want him harmed. Rather than that, I'll ask you not to bother
  about him."</p>

  <p>"I see what you are. You're one of the kind that wants to sell a horse and
  ride him, too." Soapy said this without a sneer. He was merely and calmly
  placing Baird in a category.</p>

  <p>"No matter what you think about me," responded Baird, "I wouldn't have a
  hair of his head harmed."</p>

  <p>"He might lose a little hide. What about that?"</p>

  <p>"He can't be handled easily. I know that. Only, there must be no real
  physical damage done to him. Otherwise the thing's not to be considered."</p>

  <p>Soapy raised a hand, dismissing the subject at once. "He'll be handled.
  What's the look of this fellow, Cobalt?"</p>

  <p>"You can spot him in any crowd. He looks bigger than he is, and yet he's
  bigger than his looks. He has pale-blue eyes. There are muscles around the
  base of his jaw. You'll know Cobalt the instant you see him. He's quiet. He
  never makes trouble but, if it starts around him, he'll do the
  finishing."</p>

  <p>"Not in this town." Soapy Jones smiled again. He had an ugly smile. I've
  seen it myself, and I know.</p>

  <p>Then Baird said: "This affair will be a good deal of trouble to you. You
  name your own figure for it."</p>

  <p>Soapy stared at him. "Partner," he answered, "this is friendship. You
  can't pay me money for this sort of work."</p>

  <p>"I'm grateful."</p>

  <p>"I guess you are. This fellow Cobalt has thrown a chill into you, but you
  don't need to worry about him now. He's in my hands."</p>

  <p>"I've warned you about him before. I warn you again. He's a hard man. He's
  the hardest man we ever saw inside."</p>

  <p>"They don't have any hard men inside. I have the hard men here. I have all
  the hard men. They have some fellows inside with strong hands, but I have
  man-breakers here that ride the tough boys to death. Let me tell you
  something. I won't send two men to tackle your friend, Cobalt. I'll only send
  one."</p>

  <p>Baird sat still and stared, agape. "Do you mean it?"</p>

  <p>"I'll send one man. As small as this. Hardly more than a boy. And he'll
  ride your tough friend to death. He'll tame him." He leaned back a little in
  his chair and laughed. "That's the kind I have around me," he went on. "Man-
  breakers. Experts. I train them myself. I have the best-trained man-breakers
  in the world. That's all, now. Go home and stop worrying. This fellow Cobalt
  is already out of your way. I've taken him out of your way."</p>

  <p>Baird certainly knew a great deal about what Cobalt could do and had done,
  but he could not help believing what Soapy told him. He thanked the crook
  again and came straight back to me. Sylvia had gone to bed, tired out, and I
  asked Baird what he had done. He was afraid that I would not approve, and
  therefore he merely said that he had seen Soapy and discovered that he had
  known the man before in Spokane. He said that Soapy seemed to be a human
  devil, and that was all. But Baird told me not a word of the real subject of
  his conversation with Soapy Jones. If he had, it might have saved something
  in the end.</p>

  <p>We did not go to bed. We were too excited. Besides, there was a rising
  tide of noise through the muddy streets of Skagway, so we went down to find
  out what was in the air. We got no farther than the downstairs entrance hall,
  where the desk was located before we had a chance to learn everything that
  was going on. There were twenty men gathered around one speaker. The speaker
  was a rough-looking fellow with a brown, weathered face, a resolute
  expression, and a deep, harsh voice. He talked rapidly and with emotion, but
  he did not shout. He seemed rather like a man expressing his fury in the
  bosom of his family.</p>

  <p>He said: "Gentlemen, we've stood quite a pile from Soapy Jones. I don't
  hanker to stand no more. If there's anybody here that has any backbone, he'll
  stand by me. I mean to fight Soapy Jones. I'm wearing a gun, and I intend to
  use it on him the first time I see him. You all may think that's boasting,
  but it ain't. I come here from the inside with a partner. We'd worked like
  dogs for three years. You know what it means to work three years on the
  inside of Alaska. Well, we'd done that.</p>

  <p>"We go to the first saloon that we sight to get a drink. My partner pulls
  out his poke to pay and lets the poke drop with a thud that shakes the bar.
  There's thirty pounds of good red dust in that poke. What's more, there's
  three years in it. Three years of hard slogging. Maybe that's not much. I
  don't say that it is. But thirty pounds is around ten thousand dollars. That
  was his half of the work we'd done. I had the same amount. Well, the
  bartender in that saloon is a little fellow with buck teeth and a sort of a
  foolish, smiling look, except around the mouth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Someone broke in to say that they knew the man. So did I. The description
  was unmistakable. "Jess Fair," someone named him.</p>

  <p>"This bartender ups and tells my partner he'd better leave that money with
  him for safe keeping, seeing it's so heavy to tote around. My partner only
  laughs and says that he knows how to take care of his own money.</p>

  <p>"'Do you?' says the barkeep, this fellow you call Fair. And he reaches
  over the bar with a big Colt in his hand and slams my partner over the head
  with the barrel of the gun. While my pal drops, Jess Fair takes the poke and
  shoves it under the bar!</p>

  <p>"I didn't have no gun, but I jumped for that thug. He just jammed the
  muzzle of his gun into the hollow of my throat and told me that I was stupid
  to associate with such a fool, and he told his bouncers to throw the pair of
  us out into the street. They did it, too. They threw us out, and I got my
  partner to a room and found a doctor. Maybe his skull is fractured. Anyway,
  he's still got a fever, and he's out of his head.</p>

  <p>"I left him flat on his back, moaning and muttering. I hired a kid to look
  after him for a while. Then I bought me a gun. And I went and looked up a
  fellow who they said was a deputy sheriff. He said the matter would be looked
  into. I waited two days. I asked him what he'd done about it, and he had
  forgotten who I was. I had to remind him, and he said he'd had his hands full
  and that he would look into it the first chance he got, but I knew when that
  will be&mdash;just never.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's why I'm here. You've averaged about a dead man a day for a
  long spell here in Skagway. Why? Because you've got Soapy here with his gang.
  That's why! Every kind of dirty work in the world is done by him and his
  gang. Now, gentlemen, I'm gonna tell you that in half an hour there's gonna
  be a meeting where the best men in the town are gonna be present and try to
  work out some way of handling Soapy and cleaning up Skagway. I'm gonna be
  present. So will a lot of Soapy's agents. But we want the decent people to
  come along with us. Why, every man here oughta follow me!"</p>

  <p>He finished with this and, turning on his heel, walked out of the room and
  into the street. Just as he suggested, every man followed him. For my part it
  seemed impossible that such things as the brutal robbery he described could
  be tolerated by the adherents of law and order even in a wild frontier town
  like Skagway.</p>

  <p>I went along with Baird at the heels of this group. Looking back, I saw
  that the proprietor remained at his desk, smiling sourly after us.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet he's one of the gang," I said to Baird.</p>

  <p>"Of course he is," agreed Baird. "Every crook in town is with Soapy, or
  else he's not in the town long. Soapy won't allow any rivalry, they tell me.
  He's a monopolist, pure and simple."</p>

  <p>On the way to the meeting place, we fell in with a decent sort of fellow
  who had the look of a gambler, if I ever saw one. His fine long hands were a
  treat to see, and I could imagine him doing real magic with a pack of
  cards.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of all of this?" I asked him. "I'm a newcomer. I'm an
  old hand in Alaska, but I'm a cheechako in Skagway."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," replied the stranger. "Soapy's about half a curse and
  half a blessing to Alaska. He weeds out the crooks. He keeps some, but he
  knocks others over the head. Besides, Soapy's not such a bad fellow in a way.
  He knows his friends."</p>

  <p>"Does he rob people in open daylight in his saloon?" asked Baird, growing
  hot.</p>

  <p>"Of course he does, and the poor fools still flock there," said our new
  friend. "The trouble with us Americans is that we don't particularly care
  about law and order. It takes time and trouble to organize an efficient legal
  system and protection for the people. We don't waste that much time and
  trouble. We leave it for the other fellow, and the other fellow is as likely
  as not to be a crook himself. He knows we won't watch him. Look at
  Canada&mdash; the difference just over the border. Six Northwest Mounted
  Police could clean up the whole of Skagway in a week if this were in Canada.
  They have the public and the public interest behind them."</p>

  <p>We could not help agreeing. There's no finer body of men in the world than
  the Northwest Mounted.</p>

  <p>"What's your line here?" I asked the stranger because he interested
  me.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm one of Soapy's dealers," he said with a grin and drifted away
  from us in the crowd.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; SOAPY AND THE CROWD</h2>

  <p class="first">As we wedged with the entering crowd into the big room that
  housed the meeting, Baird said to me: "That's pretty cool. I wonder how many
  more of the same kind are down here spotting for Soapy?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty," I suggested. "Keep your voice down. Let others do the talking.
  Soapy has Skagway in his pocket, it seems to me."</p>

  <p>It was true, too. Soapy's reign of terror has become famous since that
  day. I saw the town when his reign was in its prime, and still I look back to
  those days as to a bad dream.</p>

  <p>The room was packed. We remained rather near the door because it was
  impossible to get in much farther. Then somebody stood up on a chair in the
  middle of the room and began to harangue us. He was a fat man with a big,
  round, bald, red head and a thick-lipped mouth. He looked like a white Negro.
  He was quite a talker, and he painted the picture of Soapy Jones with all the
  colors of the rainbow. He told us that Skagway could be the key to Alaska. He
  told us what Soapy was making of it. He gave us a list of crimes that made my
  blood run cold.</p>

  <p>I whispered to Baird: "There's going to be a riot at the end of this
  meeting. White men won't stand for the sort of things that Soapy's doing
  here."</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It may be that Soapy has this meeting already salted," said
  Baird. "Look yonder. There's Jess Fair, the barkeep. Look at him applauding.
  He's not afraid."</p>

  <p>"He's a young demon," I said, and added: "Keep your voice down. You don't
  know who's listening in on what we say." It was my second warning to Baird,
  and I thought it was very good advice.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the people in the crowd were getting hot under the collar.
  When the first speaker ended, others jumped up on chairs, sometimes four or
  five at a time, all ready and bursting to tell about the evil things Soapy
  Jones had done. Finally a man of dignified presence stood up and raised his
  hand until he silenced the others. He then asked them what was to be done. He
  wanted to know the sentiment of the meeting whether they considered Soapy a
  public menace or not?</p>

  <p>There was a hoarse, deep-throated roar from that crowd. It sounded like
  the barking of the sea lions on the Cliff House rocks at San Francisco. When
  the roar died down, the tall fellow raised his hand, and the crowd was silent
  again. Then he said: "My friends, I propose we march in a mass to Soapy's
  saloon, smash the place, and search it from top to bottom. We may discover
  some interesting things there. I'd particularly like to examine the inside of
  his roulette wheel!"</p>

  <p>There was a sour burst of laughter at this.</p>

  <p>"After we've smashed the saloon, we'll close up the place tight. To the
  thugs we catch in it, we'll give a fair trial and a quick ending. There's
  plenty of rope lengths in Skagway, I take it!"</p>

  <p>Another roar went up from the crowd. I was once the unwilling witness of a
  lynching. The faces I saw around me looked like the faces I remembered having
  seen in that other crowd long before.</p>

  <p>Just then a voice spoke from the doorway, a loud, ringing voice, that made
  every face jerk around to see who was speaking. "Gentlemen!" said the
  newcomer in a loud voice.</p>

  <p>It was Soapy Jones standing in the doorway, with a high hat on his head
  and wearing a long-tailed coat. Over the bend of one arm he carried a riot
  gun.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," said Soapy, "have I your attention?"</p>

  <p>He hardly needed to ask that question. I could hear the breathing of the
  people about me, but I could hear nothing else.</p>

  <p>He went on: "It seems to me, friends, that it's time for you to
  disperse."</p>

  <p>He waited. No one stirred.</p>

  <p>"A good pow-wow is an excellent thing at times," continued Soapy Jones,
  "but after a talk there's nothing better than a little walk. I advise you to
  start walking gentlemen!"</p>

  <p>Still no one moved. The air was tense. Just before me was the fellow who'd
  made the talk in the hotel lobby. I saw his hand stealing inside his coat
  probably for that gun he had advertised having, but I did not actually see
  the glint of the weapon.</p>

  <p>Soapy was saying: "Mister Haven, no one seems willing to take the place of
  honor. Will you lead the way out?"</p>

  <p>I heard a man near the door mutter an oath, but suddenly he slouched
  forward and went through the doorway past Soapy. The whole crowd lurched a
  little.</p>

  <p>"Mister Jenkins," said Soapy, "suppose you go next. And you, Mister Cross,
  and you, Marrow!"</p>

  <p>I got to know Marrow later. He was quite a humorist and now he said: "I'd
  like to stop and argue with you, Soapy, but some of your friends might help
  me along from behind!"</p>

  <p>He laughed at his own joke. Others began to laugh. I felt the danger
  melting out of the air. I felt the crowd weakening.</p>

  <p>"We're all salted down with his thugs," muttered somebody near me.
  "There's no chance to do anything today!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly I knew that he was right. Nothing would be done on this day.
  Nothing would probably be done on other days for a long time. It was that
  remarkable man who stood there in the doorway that had quelled them. I never
  have seen such an exhibition of the force of will power, never in all my
  life, and I've seen some odd corners of the world and some hard breaks. Soapy
  Jones, smiling faintly there in the doorway, seemed to reach every face and
  every soul with his bright, moving eyes. He seemed to be writing things down
  in his memory. As the people brushed by him, going out he occupied half of
  the entrance, so that we had to get out in single file he made cheerful
  remarks here and there.</p>

  <p>"The air's bad in here," he observed. "You know, I've studied to be a
  doctor, and I wouldn't keep even a dog in a crowd like this. You'll like
  everything a lot better once you're out in the open."</p>

  <p>In a steady file the people went past him. Some of them looked at him with
  angry defiance. Others were plainly frightened to death, hanging their heads
  and hurrying by him as though they prayed that he might not file a picture of
  their faces in his cunning mind. Still others and I think these were in the
  majority smiled or laughed openly, as though they found the whole thing a
  joke and had looked on it as a joke from the first.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget Soapy Jones's emporium, gentlemen," he was saying. "An
  asylum for the thirsty and a place where one can make the time pass quickly.
  A day is like an hour in the Soapy Jones saloon."</p>

  <p>"It goes like an hour, and it costs like a year!" said some wag who was
  passing him.</p>

  <p>"So it does," said Soapy, laughing in the most amiable manner. "I remember
  you, young fellow. You did very well at faro last night. Come and try your
  luck again."</p>

  <p>"I've had my luck, and I'll keep it," said the other.</p>

  <p>"That's not a bad idea, either," answered Soapy. "Now, who's for Soapy's
  place? You know how it got that name? Because it's scrubbed clean every day.
  Every floor, window, and every door."</p>

  <p>"But some of the stains don't come out," said one.</p>

  <p>"So they don't," agreed Soapy. "If you're ever bored in my place, you can
  look at the floor and find more there than you would in a book. Come along,
  boys. Who's for Soapy Jones's saloon?"</p>

  <p>It was an amazing thing to see how he gathered them. They went in troops
  after him. They began to laugh and whoop and shout. A great many of them were
  wild young boys, such as always form the body and the forefront of every gold
  rush, but some of them were old enough to have known better.</p>

  <p>I've always felt that it was the very nature of Soapy's place that
  intrigued people and got them in. Robbery, murder even, walked through the
  rooms of Soapy Jones and, therefore, every man prided himself on the number
  of times he had been there and his ability to call the bartenders and the
  dealers by name. To be recognized as an old patron in the saloon of Soapy
  Jones qualified a man, not so much as a fool as a desperado.</p>

  <p>That was the ending of the first memorable meeting of protest against
  Soapy Jones. If there had been really efficient preparation and leadership,
  the power of the man might have been broken on that day. But the leadership
  was lacking and, therefore, the whole scheme fell through. Instead, the hand
  of Soapy Jones was strengthened for days to come. Many a man can remember
  that meeting. Many have described it. But I believe that it went almost
  exactly as I have remembered and written it down. To the end of my life one
  of the clearest of my memories must be Soapy at the door of the meeting,
  smiling and chatting with the people who filed past him, the very men who had
  just been discussing a necktie party at which he was to be the honored
  guest.</p>

  <p>Baird, watching the people drift down the street, finally said to me:
  "I've a mind to go with them."</p>

  <p>"Have you lost your head?" I was alarmed.</p>

  <p>"It may be worthwhile, for one to know some of those fellows better."</p>

  <p>"You'll be tapped over the head. And you have something in your poke,
  too!"</p>

  <p>He smiled at me, a faint smile "No, you don't have to worry about me. You
  don't have to worry about yourself, so long as you're with me. I have what
  you might call a pass with Soapy Jones."</p>

  <p>I rubbed my chin with my knuckles and shook my head at him. It was long
  after this before I understood the details of his interview with the thug
  and, therefore, I was thoroughly mystified. I knew Baird was a man of many
  experiences, and I was willing to let him keep his mystery a secret.</p>

  <p>"If you're sure it's safe," I said, "of course there's no place where I'd
  rather see a show than in that tiger's den."</p>

  <p>So we went down the street after the rest, and at their heels we pushed
  through the door and entered the rambling rooms that made up the
  establishment. There was already an air of mad gaiety, and people were
  thronging between the bar and the gaming tables. Then Baird gripped my arm.
  His fingers bit into my flesh like teeth.</p>

  <p>"Cobalt. Let's get out," he whispered.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; THE WILD MAN AGAIN</h2>

  <p class="first">When one sees lightning, it is already too late to run. When
  we saw Cobalt, he was stepping straight toward us. How do you think he
  greeted us after the long absence and after all that had passed between us?
  He simply said: "Hello, fellows! What did you think of that meeting? There
  was a show for you!"</p>

  <p>"Were you there, Cobalt?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was there. I was standing a little behind you." A glint of
  amusement came into his eyes.</p>

  <p>I understood at once. He'd been following us. He knew all about us. He had
  known, perhaps, ever since we came into town, but he did not gloat over us.
  Neither did he show the slightest feeling of any kind. He merely said: "It
  was a good show. That fellow, Soapy, he'd be worth knowing. He has something
  more than cloth up his sleeve."</p>

  <p>I looked at Baird, and Baird looked at me.</p>

  <p>"It's a wonder we ever left Circle City," I said, taking the
  conversational bull by the horns.</p>

  <p>"Well, you might have waited," said Cobalt. "You were afraid of trouble
  with me, weren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course we were," put in Baird.</p>

  <p>"As long as we didn't meet on the trail," said Cobalt, "it was all right.
  That might have been bad. Did you ever notice the queer ideas that a fellow
  gets when he's on the trail?"</p>

  <p>I listened to him and could not believe my ears. "Cobalt, you would have
  killed me on the trail?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied as calmly as you please. "Of course, I would have killed
  you&mdash;if I could."</p>

  <p>Baird glared at us in a wild way. This sort of talk was too much for him.
  It was like having a bounding, roaring lion come up and lick your hand. "I've
  got to get back," he muttered. "I've got to get back to my girl."</p>

  <p>"Oh, she's all right," said Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"What?" exclaimed Baird.</p>

  <p>Cobalt grinned at us in a friendly way. "Don't you worry," he said. "I
  only looked at her. I didn't steal her. She's asleep."</p>

  <p>"You looked at her? Through the window?"</p>

  <p>"No, not through the window. I opened the door."</p>

  <p>"That door has a lock on it," exclaimed Baird, all in a sweat.</p>

  <p>"I jimmied the lock and walked in."</p>

  <p>"The mischief you did," said Baird.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to see her. It had been ages, since the last look. So I spoiled
  the lock on that door. It doesn't amount to anything, and it'll save me some
  trouble the next time."</p>

  <p>"Cobalt," I said, "why did you do it? Did you throw her into a fit? A
  thing like that's enough to kill her."</p>

  <p>"Of course it is, only I didn't wake her up. I didn't want to talk to her.
  I just wanted to look. I would be there still looking, except that the wolf
  got a shade restless, and I was afraid he was growling loud enough to wake
  her up." He gestured toward a corner. "Let's go over and have a drink."</p>

  <p>I was still more than half staggered. My brain reeled. Toward this
  encounter I had been looking as toward the end of the world, and yet here was
  the great enemy who'd haunted our very dreams as calm and as gentle as a
  lamb.</p>

  <p>It was quite too much for Baird. He repeated hoarsely: "I'll see you
  later, Cobalt. I'd better get back to my girl&mdash;broken lock on the
  door&mdash; all alone."</p>

  <p>Cobalt laughed, answering: "Do you think another man is likely to walk
  into that room? If he does, he'll walk out again with his throat cut. The
  wolf is fond of the girl, it seems."</p>

  <p>He took us each by an arm and determinedly carried us into the corner
  where he set us down at a table and ordered three drinks. While he was
  getting the drinks, Baird said to me: "Tom, he's lost his wits. He's
  completely mad!"</p>

  <p>It showed me how excited he was. "What makes you think so?"</p>

  <p>"I know it. I can tell by the look of his eye. His mind's on fire, but
  he's choking off the flames."</p>

  <p>When Cobalt came back, Baird said: "You're sure she doesn't know you were
  there?"</p>

  <p>"She won't know it till she wakes up. She was sleeping soundly with one
  arm curled under her head. She was talking in her sleep and laughing a
  little. It was a pretty sight to see." He smiled as he thought of it then
  went on: "She was murmuring something about Tommy being fun. Does she call
  you Tommy now, Chalmers?"</p>

  <p>I gave him something like two looks in one. He did not seem angry or
  jealous as his remarks implied that he might be. He looked at me with a new
  interest, only I could not tell what was in his mind. A watchdog looks as he
  did then when its head is raised and its eyes are shining. It may be ready to
  jump forward and lick your hand. Again, it may be ready to jump forward and
  slit your throat. That was the way Cobalt looked. Anything might have been
  stirring within him.</p>

  <p>"She calls me Tommy. That's her way of talking down to me."</p>

  <p>I was all in sweat, but Cobalt simply smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad I didn't meet you on the trail, Chalmers. You're all right. You
  won't burn through steel, but you might rust it."</p>

  <p>It was not very hard to see there was an insult in this speech, but I was
  not the man to take up the challenge in any haste. I let it fall flat, in
  fact. I would as soon have picked up and held in hand a nitroglycerine bomb
  as to trouble Cobalt on this day. Besides, we had something coming in our
  direction, after the way we had run out on him at Circle City.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you didn't meet me on the trail," I admitted. "In other words,
  I'm glad to be here!" I smiled at Cobalt, and he smiled back.</p>

  <p>"You talk against yourself a lot," he said. "As a matter of fact, you're
  about the only man in Skagway with the nerve to walk the streets and not pack
  a gun."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that I don't pack a gun?"</p>

  <p>He sipped his drink. It was poison so rank that one could almost see the
  fumes from it rise. But Cobalt tasted that liquid fire and ran it casually
  over the back of his tongue, though it would have removed the membrane of an
  ordinary person.</p>

  <p>"I know," said Cobalt, "because you're afraid you might get scared into
  using it. But you're all right, Tom. You'll fight when you're cornered, and
  you might be hard on the eyes of the fellow who cornered you."</p>

  <p>I suppose there was an insult in all of this too, particularly in the
  suggestion I might scratch like a woman but, again I repeat, I was not
  looking for insults in the speeches of Cobalt. I was sedulously avoiding
  them.</p>

  <p>"Well, Cobalt, I'm glad that you're not doing the cornering."</p>

  <p>"Of course, I'm not doing it. I'm only glad to have met you all again. You
  made good time coming in with only the three of you and two sleds."</p>

  <p>"Sylvia and the wolf pulled one," said Baird.</p>

  <p>Cobalt half rose and suddenly slumped back into his chair. After the real
  or the affected calm of his meeting with us, it was a shock to see him hit
  hard by what seemed to me a thing of no very great consequence.</p>

  <p>"You mean she made the Lightning Warrior get out and pull on a line?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"That's what she did," I said. "I never saw a wolf pull so hard or a dog,
  either. He was like a horse, and I remember once when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Cobalt waved this remark to one side. "Tell me how she did it?" he said,
  leaning forward and looking eagerly at me.</p>

  <p>"How she tamed the wolf?" I asked. "Yes, I'll tell you how she tamed
  him."</p>

  <p>"Start in. I'm interested."</p>

  <p>"She went out into the yard, back there in Circle City, and let him off
  the chain he'd been chewing on." As I explained, I kept looking him in the
  eye. "You know what that means. The wolf was ravening, but she simply went
  out, leaned over him, and took off his collar."</p>

  <p>Cobalt looked blank. "She sort of hypnotized him, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"No, but she didn't care. She didn't much care what happened. That was the
  way of it. And the unexpected happened. The wolf loved her because she wasn't
  afraid of him."</p>

  <p>Cobalt took his face between his hands and rested his elbows on the edge
  of the table. How he stared at me. "The wolf never loved me," he said
  then.</p>

  <p>"You know how it is with dumb beasts," I said. "They're apt to give you
  back exactly what they get from you."</p>

  <p>He nodded at me, a mere jerk of the head. "I guess you score off me there.
  But she made the beast love her, eh? That's what I wanted to talk to you
  about. He stood between me and her bed. The longer I stayed, the worse he
  got. He would have jumped me in another moment. He seemed to have forgotten
  everything."</p>

  <p>What had he forgotten? Why, the manhandling that Cobalt had given the
  brute when they fought it out there in the wilderness. The mystery of the
  girl's accomplishment seemed to interest him more than the actual meeting
  with Sylvia herself.</p>

  <p>Then he repeated: "You don't know what her methods are?"</p>

  <p>"Just fearlessness," I said.</p>

  <p>Cobalt laughed in a very odd way. "Maybe she'll tame me one of these
  days."</p>

  <p>"Well, maybe she will," I said.</p>

  <p>He gave me an ugly look, his upper lip lifting at one corner in a way I
  shall never forget. One doesn't expect to see such an expression, not in the
  face of a man.</p>

  <p>"Let it go at that!" said Cobalt, leaning back in his chair suddenly. He
  glanced about then remarked: "I know that there are some people watching me
  here in Skagway." He turned to Baird. "Have you put somebody on my
  trail?"</p>

  <p>I did not know at that time what had passed between Soapy Jones and Baird.
  Therefore I was surprised when Baird changed color.</p>

  <p>"Would that be out of the way?" Baird spoke, frankly enough.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Cobalt, "but I'll have a look at that lad over there." He
  got up from the table and turned his back on us.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; THE RAWHIDE KID</h2>

  <p class="first">He went straight toward a young fellow who was seated in a
  chair tilted back against the wall, quite close to us. In one glance I read
  him to be one of the Soapy Jones's men. I cannot tell exactly why I was sure
  of this. It may have been because Cobalt already had mentioned that he was
  being followed. It may have been simply the look of the boy, for he was
  hardly more than that, nineteen or twenty, lean as a greyhound, strong as
  rawhide. He seemed very slender, but the size of his neck showed his real
  strength. When Cobalt came before him, we could hear perfectly what they said
  to each other. Cobalt spoke first.</p>

  <p>"I didn't get your name, friend."</p>

  <p>The other looked up at him as fresh as salt. "I never seen you before," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Is that so? Then it was your ghost that's been following me around
  Skagway."</p>

  <p>"I never follow anybody. I show the way, old-timer, and don't you forget
  it."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to forget you easily, but I'm going to try to put you out
  of my mind."</p>

  <p>"How will you go about the putting?" asked the lad.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you."</p>

  <p>Cobalt reached for him. At this gesture the boy moved as light moves when
  it twinkles on the face of a mirror. All in a flash he was on his feet and in
  the same instant a gun winked in his hand, a gun which was polished with use
  and good care so that it shone like something translucent. You could tell
  that the lad did his thinking, not pen in hand, but gun in hand, so quick was
  that draw. But as the gun came out, Cobalt reached the wrist of the gun arm
  and his grip froze on it. The boy smashed the other fist into Cobalt's face
  and tried to hit him again, but Cobalt picked the second drive out of the air
  and held the fist fast. It looked as though the boy had struck a wall of
  iron. There they stood, the lad cursing, his face contorted with pain, and
  Cobalt smiling at him gently. Their faces were only inches apart.</p>

  <p>"Skagway is getting introduced to Cobalt," I told Baird.</p>

  <p>He looked very grave. "Cobalt will be a dead man inside twenty-four
  hours!" he predicted.</p>

  <p>I paid little attention to that remark at the time. It seemed to me to
  come rather out of Baird's wish than any possibility. Cobalt stepped back to
  the table, bringing the boy with him. He held the gun hand of the lad over
  the top of the table and squeezed the heavy Colt revolver out of his grasp.
  It was not surprising that the gun fell. Blood fell with it. With my own eyes
  I saw a thin spurt spring out from under a fingernail of the youngster. His
  white, writhing face was too much for me.</p>

  <p>I sprang up and clapped Cobalt on the shoulder. "Cobalt, hadn't you better
  let him go? He's done no harm!"</p>

  <p>Cobalt turned his head slowly until he could look at me and there, for the
  first time, I saw the thing that had frozen so many hearts. I saw the mask of
  Cobalt fighting, a mask of ice and fire, and it sickened me. I slumped back
  into my chair as though he had struck me. All he said was: "That gun was
  meant for me. Murder was all this lad meant. Isn't that enough?" It was
  enough. In the meantime we had the eye of the crowd. All heads were turned
  our way. I saw Jess Fair, behind the bar, watching with a curious
  detachment.</p>

  <p>"Keep a good hold on the Rawhide Kid," said one of the men nearest to us.
  "When you let go of him, he'll sting you sure."</p>

  <p>"This Rawhide Kid will never sting again," said Cobalt gently. "His
  nettles are all gone."</p>

  <p>I thought the Rawhide Kid was about to faint. Cobalt had shifted his grip
  so that he held him by both hands. I could judge of the pressure that was
  being exerted by the tremor of Cobalt's forearms. He backed the boy into a
  corner. The big lad laid his shoulders against the wall and endured the
  punishment. He set his teeth in his lip. His eyes bulged a little.</p>

  <p>"I just wanted to say a few words to you," Cobalt told him.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to kill you!" said the boy.</p>

  <p>"There'll be time for that later on, but you're going to begin by talking
  to me a little."</p>

  <p>"I'll have the heart out of you before long!"</p>

  <p>"Not until you get a new pair of hands!"</p>

  <p>The Rawhide Kid gasped. His head jerked back and rapped against the wall
  as he felt the pressure increase. There is little else so painful as having
  the hand gripped so hard that the knucklebones grate together. The Rawhide
  Kid was enduring his share of the torment and something more. No one moved to
  interfere with the procedure. The men looked on with keen interest, but they
  kept at a distance. It was simply known that the Rawhide Kid had pulled a
  gun. It was not the first time that he had flashed a weapon in Skagway, it
  developed. Being a killer, he got only that sympathy which a killer may
  expect. No one could hear what Cobalt was saying to the boy except Baird and
  me.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Cobalt, "I want the name of the man who set you trailing
  me."</p>

  <p>"Nobody. I ain't trailing you."</p>

  <p>"I want the name of the man who started you on my trail," insisted
  Cobalt.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there was a dull, cracking sound. I knew that one of the boy's
  metacarpal bones must have snapped. His head jerked over on his shoulder,
  pulled by the twinge of agony, but he did not cry out. He had his share of
  manhood and more than his share.</p>

  <p>"The name!"</p>

  <p>The twisting lips of the boy whispered: "Soapy!"</p>

  <p>Cobalt released him instantly, picked the gun off the top of the table,
  and offered it to him, but the hands of the lad were stiff and white from the
  frightful pressure they had endured. There was only the ugly stain of red
  about the fingertips. He could not take the weapon. So Cobalt dropped it into
  the pocket of his coat, and Rawhide stumbled blindly away and was lost behind
  the shoulders of the crowd.</p>

  <p>Cobalt came back and sat down with us. His calm outwardly was entirely
  restored. He lifted his half-finished drink of whiskey with a hand which did
  not tremble and drank it off slowly, as before.</p>

  <p>"It's Soapy Jones," he said softly, as he replaced the glass upon the
  table.</p>

  <p>The crowd was already busied about its former occupations. Only now and
  again some head turned and a glance went to Cobalt, but he did not seem to
  notice these looks. I could not help saying: "If it's Soapy Jones, you'd
  better get out of Skagway, Cobalt."</p>

  <p>He grinned at me. "That's good sympathetic advice, brother, but I'm not
  getting out of Skagway."</p>

  <p>I said: "You ought to know the power Soapy has here. The man owns the
  town. You've just seen today what he can do with it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw. I saw plenty of what he can do, but I'm not leaving
  Skagway."</p>

  <p>"You think," I said, aroused by a real concern for him, "that it's only a
  question of one man. He may be a hardcase, but no doubt you could handle him
  alone. It isn't that. He has a mob behind him. Half these fellows would kill
  you for the sake of getting one smile from Soapy. That's the fact. I've heard
  the talk."</p>

  <p>Cobalt shook his head. "D'you think that I'd leave town before I've
  finished my business here? You wouldn't think that of me, Tom, would
  you?"</p>

  <p>I had to shake my head. As well think of a bulldog loosing its grip at a
  word of good advice. "No," I said, "I don't suppose you will."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know just what your business is," prompted Baird.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's Sylvia, of course," Cobalt replied. "Sylvia alone. That is to
  say, it was Sylvia before Soapy Jones mixed into the affair. Now I'll have to
  have an interview with Soapy. There doesn't seem to be any doubt about that."
  Suddenly he made a gesture with both hands, palms up. "It looks to me as if
  I'm going to have a real party in Skagway, as if I'm going to be able to fill
  both hands in this town."</p>

  <p>I understood, with a chilly touch of insight, just what he meant. He would
  have his fill of fighting, and battle was what he lived for. His lips were
  compressing in hardly visible twitches.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Cobalt," I said, "did you never have both hands full
  before?"</p>

  <p>He half closed his eyes in thought. "No," he conceded finally. "I never
  had both of them full." He looked down. You would have thought he was pitying
  the bad luck of those hands. "When I was ripping away on Birch Creek last
  summer, I just about filled them&mdash;thinking of Sylvia, I mean, and
  working for her."</p>

  <p>He had worked twenty hours out of the twenty-four, men said, and one hour
  of his labor was worth five hours of another man. He worked in a frenzy, as a
  dog pulls at a sled when it has hydrophobia of the peculiar variety which
  appears in arctic sled teams. I remember thinking how foolish we'd been Baird
  and I to dream we could escape from this man when his heart was really set on
  finding the girl. He had worked hard enough to show that he would never give
  her up. It hardly needed his frantic rush from Circle City to the coast to
  prove that to us. We had argued like children, and like children we had
  obeyed a blind impulse.</p>

  <p>I stared at Baird helplessly, and he likewise stared back at me. What
  could the solution be? Nothing except the will of this giant of mind and
  body.</p>

  <p>"What's the next step, Cobalt?" I asked him, expressing our despair in the
  foolish question.</p>

  <p>"Soapy Jones is the next step," he answered.</p>

  <p>I saw Baird change color.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; AN INCIDENT</h2>

  <p class="first">I think Cobalt would have gone straight to find Soapy at
  that moment if an odd event hadn't intervened and filled our attention for a
  little. Otherwise, it would hardly deserve a place in this narrative, but the
  thing was so diabolical, and it has been repeated so often by old-timers who
  only heard of it, that I've deemed it fitting to set the thing down in black
  and white exactly as it happened.</p>

  <p>This was the way of it. A man with a wide, good-natured looking face came
  into the saloon and asked in a loud voice: "Where's Jess Fair?"</p>

  <p>It seemed a strange question, seeing that Fair was actually standing there
  behind the bar. At the moment he was polishing up the bar and giving some
  directions over his shoulder to an assistant. He was wearing a white coat and
  a blue bow tie with a fancy figure in it. He was always dressed just like a
  dandy.</p>

  <p>When the stranger asked for him, he continued to polish the bar and to
  speak to his assistant without turning his head. No one answered the man's
  question, but I heard Cobalt murmur: "There's going to be trouble."</p>

  <p>Well, I could feel it too. The air became suddenly electric. Danger will
  prickle like a current through the skin of a man.</p>

  <p>"Where's Jess Fair?" repeated the stranger.</p>

  <p>There was still no answer. People looked at him, some of them smiling a
  little and expectant. So he addressed a man standing close to our table.</p>

  <p>"I've got a warrant for a man named Jess Fair who works for Soapy Jones,"
  he said. "Can you tell me where I can find him?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you," said the other. "What's the warrant for?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, just a little thing. Just a couple or three murders and some little
  things like that down in the States."</p>

  <p>"Well, you look around for Jess," said the man he'd addressed. "I don't
  recollect having heard the name before."</p>

  <p>He turned and winked at us as the stranger went away. Then we heard him
  say to a companion. "That's the new deputy sheriff. The fool don't know what
  he's about, coming in this place to make an arrest."</p>

  <p>"He's drunk," suggested the other.</p>

  <p>"No, he's just a fool," said the first man.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he was right. At any rate we now heard Jess Fair saying from
  behind the bar: "Step over here, Sheriff, will you?"</p>

  <p>The deputy sheriff walked over to the bar. "Well?" he said.</p>

  <p>"You're looking for Jess Fair?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I want him, and I want him quick."</p>

  <p>"Jess is a friend of mine," said the bartender.</p>

  <p>"Is he?" answered the man of the law. "Then I dunno that you keep very
  good company, brother. Where's this friend of yours hang out?"</p>

  <p>"Why, he's right here, most of the time."</p>

  <p>Broad grins appeared on the faces of all the men except those nearest.
  They continued to wear masks of iron self-control.</p>

  <p>"Is he?" asked the deputy, looking suddenly around him. "But he ain't here
  now?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I'll ask." He actually called to the men and asked them:
  "Have any of you seen Jess Fair today?"</p>

  <p>"Why," said one man, "I've been looking right at him, here in the
  barroom."</p>

  <p>There was a chuckle from one man, instantly suppressed, for fear that the
  game might be spoiled. The deputy sheriff had turned to the last speaker.</p>

  <p>"What does Fair look like?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, ain't you ever seen him?"</p>

  <p>"No. They just told me that pretty nearly everybody would be able to spot
  Jess Fair to me. He works here in this place. He works for Soapy Jones,
  whoever he is."</p>

  <p>"You don't know Soapy, either?"</p>

  <p>"No, I've barely heard of him. I've only been in town for three days."</p>

  <p>Three days in town and already a deputy sheriff! Well, the law moved in
  mysterious ways and with strange agents in Skagway. This fellow had the look
  of a professional bouncer or thug. He had simply gone looking for trouble in
  asking for the job of law enforcement, and trouble was what he found, the
  poor boob.</p>

  <p>"Soapy's quite a fellow," said one of the bystanders to the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"I guess he is. But I'm only looking for Jess Fair," said the deputy.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'd talk to that bartender," was the suggestion he got.</p>

  <p>He turned back to Fair. "This fellow, Fair, what's the look of him?"</p>

  <p>"Why," said the barkeep after a moment of pretended reflection, "he looks
  a great deal like me."</p>

  <p>"Now, how do you mean that?" asked the deputy in an irritated tone. "Is he
  your height, your complexion, got a mouth like yours?"</p>

  <p>The bartender looked calmly upon him. "Kind of like me in all those ways.
  But I think that he's a good deal better looking than most people do."</p>

  <p>"Do you?" said the deputy. "I ain't asking what you think of him. I'm only
  asking where I can find him."</p>

  <p>"Hunting for him would be the best way, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" exclaimed the man of the law. "Are you handing me some lip?"</p>

  <p>"No, I've hardly got enough lip to cover my own teeth. I couldn't spare
  any."</p>

  <p>The deputy swelled like a toad with anger. He strode up to the bar and
  dropped his fist on the edge of it.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be doing that," cautioned Fair. "You look pretty good natured
  already."</p>

  <p>Someone in the crowd broke into a roar of laughter. This was the end of
  self-restraint, and the whole room exploded and rocked with mirth. The deputy
  was so angry that he glared about him, as though looking for the first man he
  could strike in the face. There were too many and all equal offenders. He
  decided to concentrate on the barkeep whose remark had excited all the
  mirth.</p>

  <p>"That last crack of yours was too fresh," he said.</p>

  <p>"It got a laugh, though. That's what I'm hired for. It ain't the booze we
  peddle that keeps the boys contented at this bar. It's the jokes that their
  bartender is always cracking."</p>

  <p>This caused another burst of laughter, and the deputy turned purple. "Come
  here to me!"</p>

  <p>Jess actually leaned closer across the bar. "Yes, sir?" His appearance of
  humility tickled the bystanders still more.</p>

  <p>"Somebody ought to warn that fool," said Cobalt. "I'm afraid that
  something will happen."</p>

  <p>"Not here. Not before all this crowd," said Baird.</p>

  <p>I agreed with him, but Cobalt merely shook his head gloomily.</p>

  <p>"You been shooting off your face a lot," said the deputy to Fair. "Now I
  wanta know something. Who are you, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I'm a barkeep in the employ of the Honorable S. Jones of New York, Paris,
  Chicago, and points farther west. He'll tell you more about me."</p>

  <p>"Why, you thundering fool! I've got half a mind to take you in!"</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"To jail, you fool young puppy. That's where I got a mind to take
  you."</p>

  <p>"What for?" asked Jess.</p>

  <p>"For contempt of the law!" roared the deputy.</p>

  <p>"Are you the law?" Fair wondered innocently.</p>

  <p>The deputy gaped, grew still more purple, and actually gagged with his own
  fury, unable to speak.</p>

  <p>"But I'll direct you to Jess Fair," continued the barkeep, "if you'll
  promise not to take me to jail."</p>

  <p>That fool of a sheriff actually answered: "I'll make that a bargain. You
  ain't worth my while, only that I'm gonna teach you the right kind of
  manners."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Now tell me where this Jess Fair is."</p>

  <p>"Standing in my boots."</p>

  <p>"Hey?"</p>

  <p>A wild burst of laughter filled in the pause. The deputy, looking wildly
  about him, suddenly realized how completely he had been made sport of, and he
  stuck out his under jaw like a bulldog.</p>

  <p>"It's amusin', is it?" he asked defiantly. "You come with me. I hereby
  arrest you in the name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I hardly saw the gun flash into the hand of the bartender. I don't know
  whether he pulled it from within his neat white coat or snatched it from the
  shelf beneath the bar. But I heard the report, saw the muzzle of the gun
  jerked on high by the explosion, and saw the deputy go staggering backward,
  beating at the air like a man swimming. He fell flat on his back, twisted
  over on his face, kicked out his legs, and lay still. No one moved except
  Jess Fair. He jumped over the bar as light as a bird and leaned over the
  deputy.</p>

  <p>When he straightened up after a moment of examination, he merely said: "It
  looks as though Skagway is short of a brand new deputy sheriff, and that's
  too bad. Here, boys. Lay hold of this and chuck it outside, will you?"</p>

  <p>That was exactly what was done. The body of the dead man was lifted by two
  of the hangers-on of the place and thrown out into the street. Who removed it
  from the spot where it fell, I don't know. Perhaps another section of the
  gang did the work. What I do know is that no one inside of that saloon made
  any protest on account of the cold-blooded murder, not even Cobalt. In
  another few minutes, when the blood had been mopped up from the floor, men
  were walking about, talking and drinking, as cheerful as ever.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; THE YEGGS</h2>

  <p class="first">The body of the deputy sheriff had hardly been carried out
  of doors when Baird thrust back his chair from the table, exclaiming: "What's
  become of me, that I can sit still while outrages like this are carried
  through? What's happened to the rest of the men here? Are we all wild
  beasts?"</p>

  <p>He stood up. He was very excited, quivering from head to foot with his
  emotion. He said directly to Cobalt: "If there's justice in heaven, I'll balk
  you in the thing you wish to do. I'll keep my girl from you if you are Satan
  himself, with wings and all!"</p>

  <p>He turned on his heel and walked out from the saloon, while Cobalt looked
  after him without the slightest display of emotion. It was one of the
  upsetting features of Cobalt's behavior that you never could tell what would
  start the lion in him roaring. I preferred noise in him rather than
  silence.</p>

  <p>I was anxious enough to get out of that saloon, and I'm ashamed to confess
  that the reason I did not get up was simply that for a moment I could not. I
  felt sick and weak about the knees after what I had seen. It was Cobalt who
  stood up first. Immediately after he had left, I pulled myself together and
  managed to get out into the street. It was a dismal day. There was a light,
  variable wind blowing, and the snow descended in thin, light flakes that
  whirled and danced like white leaves from a shrub whose branches filled the
  sky. But at least I did not find the limp, dead body of the sheriff lying
  there in the street. As I said before, he had been disposed of, no one knew
  where.</p>

  <p>I turned toward the hotel, walking slowly at first, but with increasing
  speed as the freshness of the air and the cool touch of the snowflakes
  cleared my brain of the sense of faintness. Several men were walking in the
  same direction ahead of me and one of them, I saw, was Cobalt, sauntering
  along. I decided not to pass him, and it turned out a lucky thing for me that
  I made this decision. Lucky for Cobalt, too.</p>

  <p>He came to a corner and paused a moment, looking up and down the narrow
  alley which bisected the main way. While he stood there, a man stepped up and
  accosted him. He spoke rapidly, making wide gesticulations, like someone
  arguing a point, and I saw Cobalt nod once or twice, apparently agreeing with
  what he heard.</p>

  <p>I came up very close now, so that I could hear the murmur of the voices,
  and next I saw a man approach Cobalt from behind. The manner of his approach
  alarmed me. His step was the unmistakable glide of a stalking animal.</p>

  <p>I hurried. I thought of shouting to Cobalt, but something stopped me from
  doing that until I saw the second man's hand come out from his coat pocket
  with a revolver in it. He had the weapon by the barrel, and he swung the butt
  back over his head, straining arm and body so as to give full force to the
  blow he was about to deal. By the grace of luck I was just near enough. I
  grabbed the armed hand of the scoundrel with both of mine and shouted:
  "Cobalt! Cobalt! Look out!"</p>

  <p>The fellow I had hindered turned around, cursing. He struck me on the side
  of the head with knuckles that felt like steel, heavily weighted. I was half
  stunned and could only stumble in blindly and grapple with him. Suddenly he
  dropped. I lurched dizzily over his limp body and almost dropped into the
  snow-flecked mud. Then I saw that another form lay loosely spilled in the
  street, and here was Cobalt holding me under the pit of one arm.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right?" he asked me.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm all right." My movements denied it, because I kept wavering back
  and forth like a gate in a wind, an old gate that dangles from one hinge.</p>

  <p>"Stand back there against that wall," directed Cobalt.</p>

  <p>He helped me to get to that comparatively sheltered position. In the
  meantime one of the thugs had scrambled to his feet and ran off up the
  street, staggering. The second one was beginning to stir also, and Cobalt
  picked him up by the nape of the neck as a laborer might pick up half a sack
  of oats. The fellow was still loose and limp, but he rapidly recovered his
  consciousness. It was the yegg who had attempted to brain Cobalt from behind.
  A smear of blood was on one side of his face, and the flesh was already
  swelling. Plainly that was where the fist of Cobalt had delivered a hammer
  stroke. I noticed, as he got back his wits, that he showed less fear than
  sullen anger.</p>

  <p>"Today ain't the last day," he said to Cobalt. "They's gonna be another
  turn, old son."</p>

  <p>"Today may be the last day for you," said Cobalt. "I don't know. It
  depends on how well you talk."</p>

  <p>"I don't talk," said the yegg.</p>

  <p>"You're likely to be dead, then," said Cobalt. "Look at me, you!"</p>

  <p>"Well," said the thug, "whatcha want? Gonna eat me?"</p>

  <p>"I'll break you up small enough for eating, unless I find out who started
  you on my trail."</p>

  <p>"You looked like you'd have a fat poke. That's all."</p>

  <p>Cobalt with a jerk twisted the man's arm behind his back. "I'll tear that
  arm out at the shoulder, unless you tell me straight&mdash;who put you on my
  trail?"</p>

  <p>"Leave go!" gasped the yegg. "You're gonna break my arm, you! Leave go,
  will you?"</p>

  <p>"I want the name!"</p>

  <p>"There ain't any name. I swear there wasn't anybody that put me on the
  job, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Take another minute to think," advised Cobalt, and gave the arm a fresh
  twist.</p>

  <p>Once I was tormented like that by an older lad, when I was a youngster at
  school. I still can remember the blinding pain. Now, the face of the other
  wrinkled as though he felt flames.</p>

  <p>"Soapy!" he breathed.</p>

  <p>Cobalt released his arm. "You're number two from Soapy. Go back and tell
  your boss that I'm mighty flattered by getting so many messages from him.
  Tell him that the first chance I get, I'm going to call on him in person. I
  hope that he'll be ready to stage a good party."</p>

  <p>The thug lingered a moment, held by the sheer excess of his misery. He was
  massaging the twisted, tortured shoulder as he said: "You'll have your party,
  you fool! You'll have a party. So will that other sick-faced rat that grabbed
  me from behind. If it hadn't been for that, you'd be having a fine long sleep
  right now, Cobalt!"</p>

  <p>"That's pretty," said Cobalt. "Now run along, my friend.</p>

  <p>The next time we meet, I'll start, and I won't stop. You tell Soapy that I
  have all the information that I need. That's all!"</p>

  <p>The thug went up the street, still bending forward and nursing his injured
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"He won't slug a blackjack with that arm for a few weeks," mused Cobalt
  with satisfaction, stepping up beside me. "How are you now?"</p>

  <p>"I'm all right," I assured him. "He must have been an ex-pug. I never felt
  such a sock."</p>

  <p>"He's tough," agreed Cobalt, "or his arm would have broken just now."</p>

  <p>I saw that he was smiling a little, and that his eyes were bright. He kept
  watching me curiously. Plainly he had enjoyed the adventure.</p>

  <p>"Chalmers, I don't quite understand you."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"I thought you were against me."</p>

  <p>"I never was against you," I told him.</p>

  <p>"You never were?" he asked me, lifting his brows.</p>

  <p>"I never was against you. I helped to keep Sylvia Baird away from you.
  That's true. But I never was against you."</p>

  <p>"What would you call that? I mean, when a man carts a girl the most part
  of a thousand miles just to spite a friend of his&mdash;a funny kind of
  friendship, I'd call that."</p>

  <p>"Maybe <i>you</i> would. You ought to see how it is, though, Cobalt. If I
  help a man to do a wrong thing, I'm not his friend from my way of seeing it.
  If I keep him from doing a wrong thing, that seems to me to be the real part
  of friendship."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see the point," he said, an ugly glint in his eye. You're one of
  the old-fashioned moralists, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not a moralist. I'm just a common or garden kind of a fellow. That's
  all."</p>

  <p>"Look here, you saved me from having my head split open today."</p>

  <p>I felt rather modest about it, my part had been so small. "Not so much as
  that. You know, the rap would probably just have put you down and out for a
  minute."</p>

  <p>"Not when Soapy sends his boys out to collect a scalp," declared Cobalt.
  He shook his head. "Are you cold?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Will you stay here and talk to me for a minute?"</p>

  <p>"All right."</p>

  <p>"I want to stay here," he explained, "because before long I hope to see
  one of Soapy's bright boys come back to pick up the trail."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll stay here with you."</p>

  <p>"I want to know this. What made you grab the arm of that yegg? If he'd
  slugged me, everything would have been easy for you and for Baird. You could
  have got Sylvia out then, and nothing to bother you."</p>

  <p>I nodded. "I don't know. The truth is, I like you, Cobalt. I couldn't help
  trying to bother the thug when he was about to hammer you over the head. It
  was just an impulse. Don't you go and make too much out of it."</p>

  <p>He nodded, watching me, seeming to make a rapid mental calculation. "The
  trouble with you is that you don't add up right."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that, Cobalt?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I mean, knowing what I know about you, when I put you together, it
  doesn't make sense. There's something missing that I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, but don't make any mystery out of me. I'm as simple as they
  come."</p>

  <p>"Maybe, but tell me another thing. What does Sylvia mean to you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>Cobalt raised a forefinger. "Don't lie!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; SOME QUESTIONS</h2>

  <p class="first">It was not a pleasant subject. "I'm not lying, Cobalt. She
  means nothing to me."</p>

  <p>He merely smiled and said: "I want to believe you. I want to like you,
  Chalmers. You know what Soapy Jones means in this town, and you've got
  yourself into his bad graces by helping me in a pinch. I want to like you. I
  want to trust you. But you ought to be straight with me."</p>

  <p>"I am being straight. She means nothing to me."</p>

  <p>"You think that she's ugly maybe, or just merely pretty?" he said, half
  sneering.</p>

  <p>"She's the loveliest thing that I ever saw, with one exception."</p>

  <p>"What's that exception?"</p>

  <p>"A half-bred yearling filly that I saw at an Arizona horse fair."</p>

  <p>Cobalt started. "Come, come! Are you comparing a woman to a horse?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The horse had her beat."</p>

  <p>"All right. Go on and make a joke."</p>

  <p>"I'm not joking, man. Just because I differ from you, it does not mean
  that I'm joking."</p>

  <p>"Well, maybe not, but I find you mighty hard to understand."</p>

  <p>"You've said that before, but you're making a mountain out of a molehill.
  There's nothing unusual about me."</p>

  <p>"I'll try to take you at your word. But about Sylvia. You don't mind my
  talking to you about her, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I'd rather that you didn't."</p>

  <p>"Well, tell me why you'd rather not talk about her?"</p>

  <p>"Because she has a right to be consulted," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Oh, come, now," he replied. "Let's not split hairs. You know that
  Sylvia's everything to me."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that."</p>

  <p>"You don't?"</p>

  <p>"No. I know that she's a lovely picture to you. She's equal, say, to a
  fine emerald. Or have you changed your mind about that, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't changed my mind. I see what you mean&mdash;that everyone is
  apt to have a different view in looking at her."</p>

  <p>"That's about it."</p>

  <p>"And your point of view is that she doesn't mean anything to you. You
  think she's lovely, but she doesn't mean anything. Not to you. Is that it?
  You don't think that she's clever, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"She's as keen as a whip. She's a lot too clever for me to handle, I can
  tell you. She has brains enough, if you want that."</p>

  <p>"You don't want brains in a woman. Is that it?"</p>

  <p>He hung on like a bulldog, and I began to grow a little irritated.
  Besides, my feet were numbing rapidly as I stood still. "Brains or no brains,
  I don't want the woman, if that's what you mean. If you're going to be a
  jealous fool about her, I'll give you the answer straight off. I don't want
  your woman, Cobalt. I hope that you'll believe me."</p>

  <p>He was not offended. He looked at me in rather a dazed way. "But everybody
  wants Sylvia. You must be half crazy, Tom. What's the matter with you? Why
  don't you care about her the way other people do?"</p>

  <p>"I like to be with her. That's true. I like to be with her. She's good
  company. She's as good a sport as any man. She's tough. She does her share.
  She can walk like a man. She has a good nerve. She's clean, and she's gentle.
  She's amusing about everything that you could name. But I don't want her. You
  can have her, Cobalt, as far as I'm concerned. It's only her own preference
  that I'm considering."</p>

  <p>"By the jumping thunder! I sort of believe that you mean what you
  say."</p>

  <p>"I mean it. You can bet that I mean it."</p>

  <p>"I want to believe you because there have been times when I wanted to tear
  your heart out. Do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"I've guessed it. I'm glad that you passed us on the trail without seeing
  us."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad, too. In the open country a man gets pretty hard. I was hard
  when I was marching down from Circle City. I wanted your blood, Tom. But
  that's over. To put it in one word, you don't love Sylvia." He waited eagerly
  for the final confirmation.</p>

  <p>I had to search my mind when I was on the verge of replying. "Of course, I
  love her," I stated.</p>

  <p>"Hello! What are you doing? Trying to make a fool out of me?"</p>

  <p>"No. Don't you see what I mean? Sylvia's a darling. But she's a child. I'm
  old enough to be her father."</p>

  <p>"No, you're not."</p>

  <p>"I am. Almost. You don't understand, Cobalt. Women don't mean anything to
  me any more. I'm done with all that."</p>

  <p>"You have me beat," answered Cobalt. "I try to follow you, but you're too
  far away. I don't see what you mean. You haven't taken a vow or something,
  have you?"</p>

  <p>"I've got a pair of children back home. All the woman part of life is
  finished for me. You ought to be able to see that."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't, quite."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry if you don't understand, but I don't want to talk any more
  about it."</p>

  <p>"I'd think," said Cobalt, hanging on to the subject with his usual
  determination, "I'd really think that if you had a couple of kids down
  there&mdash;who's taking care of them?"</p>

  <p>"An older sister of mine. She takes care of them for me."</p>

  <p>"Well, I should think that you'd be looking for somebody to take their
  mother's place, you know, and who could be better than&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up, Cobalt! I don't want to talk about it any more. Are you
  trying to make me fall in love with Sylvia? Let me tell you all over again,
  I'm ten years too old for that."</p>

  <p>He stopped there. He only added a final, rather startling thing to end our
  talk. "Well, partner, I hope that she doesn't decide to lift those ten years
  off your shoulders one of these days!"</p>

  <p>I grinned a little. It was the sort of remark at which one has to smile.
  But I was glad the subject of Sylvia was out of the way, for the time being
  at least. How the man carried on about her.</p>

  <p>He explained: "Maybe I'm a fool, but I was jealous. I don't see things the
  way you do. You have a different slant. You make me feel like a silly kid,
  Tom. But I hope we can shake on this."</p>

  <p>I hesitated with good reason. "If I shake hands, it means a lot to me. It
  means I'm your friend. And how can I call you my friend when I'll still be
  trying to block you?"</p>

  <p>"You're going to keep it up. You're going to try to stop me, even
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'll have to try to. I'm pledged to stop you, if I can."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's all a confusion and a mess. Tom, here's my hand, if you want to
  take it. Here's my hand. I'll be a friend to you in every way I can, except
  in one way."</p>

  <p>You can imagine how glad I was to take that famous hand of Cobalt's and
  grip it with all my might. "We're friends. And this puts another ten years on
  my life, I think!"</p>

  <p>"Do you? Have you been noticing the yegg on the far side of the street
  who's watching me?"</p>

  <p>I saw the fellow now. He was standing with arms folded, wearing a big
  parka and puffing at a pipe. About all I could see of his face was a
  bristling mustache, sticking straight out. "D'you think he's watching
  us?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much else for him to see," replied Cobalt. "Let's move along.
  Believe me, Tom, what you've done today for me has tangled you up pretty
  badly. They'll all go out for you much as they're going for me."</p>

  <p>I nodded. Speaking was not so easy for me just then. "What should we do
  about it?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"Are you packing a gun?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"You're not! What sort of a fellow are you, Tom?"</p>

  <p>"Not much with a gun for one thing."</p>

  <p>"Here. Take this." He shoved a Colt into my hand.</p>

  <p>"I can't take your gun."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I have another. Don't worry a bit. But keep your eye sharp.
  I'm going to try to get at Soapy Jones, old-timer. I'm going to try to get at
  the tap root of his institution and cut it so that the tree will die."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he began to laugh. I stared at him, bewildered, but as a matter
  of fact he seemed to think that this was a grand party he had embarked on,
  and he went up the street with that light, aspiring tread of his, head held
  high. I followed along with him.</p>

  <p>A gust of wind struck us in the face. He merely laughed louder and started
  to whistle through the blast. I wished, with all my might, that I could have
  borrowed certain qualities of nerve and mind from this master of men. At the
  door of the hotel, he said good bye.</p>

  <p>"Hold on, old fellow," I said. "Why don't you room here?"</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't want me. Sylvia wouldn't want me. Neither would her father,
  and neither would you, for that matter. Good bye again. Keep your eyes open
  and your gun ready. You may need it one of these days."</p>

  <p>He simply had escorted me home, do you see, and now he was going off into
  a veritable sea of dangers. I began to wish for one thing only, and that was
  the arrival of the ship that would give us all a chance to escape from
  Skagway and travel toward the south, toward law and order. My mind was on
  this as I entered the hotel lobby.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE LION'S DEN</h2>

  <p class="first">When I passed the desk, I spoke to the proprietor. He merely
  grunted and did not raise his head to return the greeting but pretended to be
  busy with the summing up of an account. I was not fooled. Something had
  turned him against me, and was it not the swift-winged rumor which must have
  gone forth, saying that I was opposed to Soapy Jones? I had not the slightest
  doubt that the fellow was really a member of the gang which was plundering
  and murdering in Skagway.</p>

  <p>There was this new weight on my mind when I got upstairs. Sylvia smiled at
  me in her charming way when I entered after knocking on the door. I found
  that, while she was awake, she still looked sleepy, yawning from time to
  time. Even the wild tales which her father had been telling her were not
  enough to get the weariness out of her eyes. She was sitting at one end of
  the bed, with a blanket twisted around her, for the wretched room was a mere
  house of cards, and the wind was whistling through a thousand cracks.</p>

  <p>"Father has been telling me everything," she said. "Don't you feel like a
  page out of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> or something? And what became of friend
  Cobalt?"</p>

  <p>"He left me at the door of the hotel."</p>

  <p>"Is he taking a room here?" asked her father in an ominous voice.</p>

  <p>"He's not taking a room. He's gone on. He only brought me here to see that
  no one bumped me over the head while I was on the street."</p>

  <p>"Come along, man," chided Baird. "You mean that he was really
  friendly?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he was friendly."</p>

  <p>"He's changed," remarked Baird. "He's quieter, older, sourer."</p>

  <p>"Sylvia's ripened him a good deal."</p>

  <p>She gathered her ankle in one hand and looked seriously at me. "You're
  sympathizing with Cobalt, just now."</p>

  <p>"A wee bit," I told both of them. "The gang is after him, hot and heavy.
  They tried to brain him! I managed to help him a little."</p>

  <p>"What?" cried Sylvia. "Have you got mixed into a fight?"</p>

  <p>I stared darkly at her, for I saw that she was stinging me again with her
  own peculiarly subtle malice.</p>

  <p>"Be quiet, Sylvia. Stop this confounded wrangling, will you?" commanded
  her father. "Chalmers, will you tell me what's happened?"</p>

  <p>"Cobalt and I have shaken hands We're friends."</p>

  <p>"Have you gone over to him?" queried Baird.</p>

  <p>"No. I'm still free to help you."</p>

  <p>"It sounds a little twisted," observed Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"Well," I admitted, "no doubt it is twisted, but I've told you the facts.
  However, you don't have to worry about Cobalt. He won't interfere with you
  much longer. He'll be a dead man before another day comes around."</p>

  <p>I watched Sylvia as I said this, to see if she would show any fear. She
  did not. Neither did she show any pleasure in hearing that the man's death
  was so imminent.</p>

  <p>"You're guessing?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>"It's no guess. It's about as clear truth as I've ever seen. No man can
  live in Skagway after Soapy Jones has decided that he must die."</p>

  <p>"Decided that he must die?" cried Baird. "Is Soapy trying to have Cobalt
  murdered?"</p>

  <p>"I saw the thing tried today," I told them. "It will be tried again." I
  could not help adding: "They've got me in their black book also."</p>

  <p>Baird exclaimed again. He seemed very excited. "I'm going back to see
  Soapy," he declared. "You're coming with me."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," I declined, "I'll stay here and rest a while. You can go. But I
  prefer to stay here."</p>

  <p>"Sylvia," said her father, "persuade him to go, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I'll persuade him," replied Sylvia. "Tommy, you run along.
  There's a lot of drafts in this room, and you'll catch your death of cold, if
  you stay on here."</p>

  <p>"There's not enough kindness in you, Sylvia," I said, "to warm the heart
  of a little fly-catching lizard. Come along, Baird. I'll go with you!"</p>

  <p>At the door I looked back at her, scowling. She showed no emotion. She was
  merely thoughtful and detached, watching me as though I were a mere machine.
  The attitude became her, with her head canted over upon one side. It became
  her so much that my heart was still aching a good deal when we got
  downstairs.</p>

  <p>There the proprietor gave us a corner of his eye and immediately lost
  himself in his accounts again. This made me so angry that I lost control of
  my temper entirely. Sylvia had irritated me too much just before. Now I
  stepped over and tapped the brute of a proprietor on the shoulder. He raised
  his head with a jerk, but he lifted his eyes slowly.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I'm watching you, my friend, I'm watching you all the time."</p>

  <p>He looked me straight in the eye, sneering.</p>

  <p>"You'll need the help of your patron demon," I told him, "if you interfere
  in my affairs, or in Baird's affairs. And if you go near the girl, I'll have
  your heart out. I'm holding you responsible for her safety. You hear?"</p>

  <p>I thought he would jump over the desk to get at me, he was so swollen
  faced with fury, but he gradually settled back into the chair from which he
  had just risen. "Yeah, I hear," was all he said.</p>

  <p>I went out into the street, Baird asking me if I were not mad to talk like
  this, making such a foolish scene. I told him that I was tired. I was tired
  of the crime and the treacherous suggestions that filled the whole air of
  Skagway. He only answered, after a moment, that at least Sylvia was perfectly
  safe. Of course I agreed with him, but I was not so sure. Nothing that I can
  put down in words will give the true atmosphere of Skagway at that time. I
  really believe that it was a more dangerous cap than even those early murder
  nests, the Montana gold mines.</p>

  <p>The wind had died down when we got into the street, and it was much
  colder. The snow that had fallen had collected, here and there, in ruts and
  depressions, crisp and grating under the heels.</p>

  <p>I said to Baird: "Soapy is liable to have the pair of us knifed."</p>

  <p>"I've got to take the chance," replied Baird. "That's twice in half an
  hour that they've tried their hands with Cobalt. They'll have the man dead
  before long. They'll never try only one man against him. Not after what he's
  done today."</p>

  <p>I agreed with that. We went on, but there never was a more nervous and
  unhappy fellow than I was when we entered the saloon. Baird asked for Soapy
  from my friend, the barkeep, and he looked at us with his bright, unfriendly
  smile before he would answer.</p>

  <p>"You'll find him back in the little room," he told Baird. "You know the
  way. Let your friend stay here and have a drink on the house. Soapy never
  sees more than one man at a time."</p>

  <p>I only laughed. "Fair," I said to the bartender, "I'd rather put in my own
  strychnine. I'd rather pour it in my own coffee than let you in on the
  job."</p>

  <p>The fellow was the coolest in the whole world. When I accused him of
  wanting to poison me, he merely laughed.</p>

  <p>"I don't use strychnine," he said. "Matter of fact, I use something a lot
  swifter. You won't have a drink?"</p>

  <p>"No. I'm with Baird."</p>

  <p>We walked off but, as we turned away, I faced a small mirror at a side of
  the barroom. By chance it showed me the face of Jess Fair behind me, and I
  distinctly saw him make several movements with his head. At the same moment
  two or three fellows got up from a table in a corner of the room. One of them
  cursed loudly and swore that he would never try his luck at poker again. I
  was not surprised. I decided that Fair's signals must have been intended for
  this table. What a lot they were, the three of them. They did not look like
  the dregs of humanity. They were not even as near human as that.</p>

  <p>A sapient thing is vice. In their wrinkled eyes, in their foreheads, and
  about their mouths was the stamp of worldly wisdom. They all seemed to have
  the same blood. They looked like brothers, but this was only because they
  descended from the same fatherhood of crime.</p>

  <p>"We're followed, Baird," I said. "We're followed by fellows who would as
  soon brain us as take out a handkerchief."</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" demanded Baird. "We're inside now, and we've got to try to
  fight it out."</p>

  <p>"We've got to try to fight it out, but I'm scared almost stiff right
  now."</p>

  <p>"So am I," confessed Baird, "but let's keep walking."</p>

  <p>Our terror thawed a little by action of this sort, and so we came to the
  door of the small closet where Baird had been interviewed previously by the
  great Soapy Jones. First Baird rapped at the door.</p>

  <p>"It's sound-proof," said one of the three, passing with a leering look of
  contempt.</p>

  <p>"It ain't fool-proof, though," remarked another wag.</p>

  <p>The three of them laughed, nodding their heads at one another. Then the
  door opened, and Soapy Jones was inside, looking out at us and smiling.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Baird," he said. His smile went out as his glance fell on me. "I'm
  mighty glad to see you both. Come in, boys, come in."</p>

  <p>Baird went in first, and I trailed after. The place was so odd. I never
  had seen anything like it.</p>

  <p>"Not a sound goes through these walls, and not a sound enters," remarked
  Soapy Jones. "So you can explain the mystery, Chalmers, of your return to my
  place."</p>

  <p>"No mystery at all," I said.</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut, no mystery? You'll find it mysterious enough."</p>

  <p>"Shall I?" I asked, getting more frightened every moment.</p>

  <p>The door opened behind me. I dared not turn, but I got an impression of a
  dozen men entering the room.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29"></a>XXIX. &mdash; SOAPY'S CABINET</h2>

  <p class="first">My own eyes would not have served me as well at that moment
  as the eyes of my friend, Baird, for he was facing me, and in his face I saw
  mirrored the danger which was coming on me from behind. I still wonder that I
  did not cry out, or leap to the side, or attempt to pull out the revolver
  which Cobalt had given me, but I was paralyzed. Hands suddenly gripped me by
  each arm. There was enough power in their grasp to have mastered ten people
  like me.</p>

  <p>Then Baird got his voice and shouted: "Soapy, is this the result of your
  promises to me?"</p>

  <p>"What promises have I made to you?" he asked coldly. "You never mentioned
  this sneaking fellow." He pointed at me.</p>

  <p>It was not pleasant to have Soapy scowl and sneer at me. His scowls and
  sneers were likely to possess a peculiar efficacy as all men knew. His
  gestures generally were quite as effective as axe or sword strokes.</p>

  <p>"He's with me, he's my man," said Baird frantically, as the others drew me
  back toward the door. "I owe him more than I owe any other man in the world.
  He's been more a friend to me and to my daughter and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What are your friends to me?" asked Soapy. He grew white. His face shone
  as if it were freshly covered with grease.</p>

  <p>For my part I pitied poor Baird. The fury of the gangster was so intense
  that I felt that I was as good as dead. I was not even badly frightened. The
  horror which I felt of that black-bearded ogre was sufficient to make all
  other fears as nothing.</p>

  <p>"My friends are nothing to you," insisted Baird, "but you owe me
  something. You're a man who pays his debts of gratitude. You won't let harm
  be done to poor Tom Chalmers?"</p>

  <p>"Chalmers? Is that his name?" Soapy asked. "He looks like a cur to me. He
  has the hang-dog look. What use would he be to any man in the world? Why do
  you want him, Baird?"</p>

  <p>"I want him&mdash;," began Baird.</p>

  <p>At this moment there came three knocks in quick succession on the door of
  the little cabinet.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" demanded Soapy. He did not wait for an answer but opened
  the door in person.</p>

  <p>Framed in the opening appeared two men who supported a third man between
  them. The man was limp as a rag. His clothes were torn. His face looked as
  though it had been beaten with heavy clubs. I cannot describe the look of his
  features or the swollen, closed eyes. I thought he was dead, and so did Soapy
  apparently.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" he asked and added: "What do you fools mean by bringing a
  stiff here?"</p>

  <p>"He's alive," said one of the two men. "We found him. It's Blacksnake
  Loren."</p>

  <p>"Who jumped him? What gang did this?" demanded Soapy. "What in the hell is
  happening in Skagway?"</p>

  <p>"No gang. Cobalt done it," said one of the men.</p>

  <p>"You lie," insisted Soapy. "Blacksnake is a man-breaker. He's been in the
  ring. He's wrestled, too. No one man could do that to him unless he used a
  club!"</p>

  <p>They said together: "We seen it!"</p>

  <p>"What?" shouted Soapy. "You saw it, and you didn't give Blacksnake a
  hand?"</p>

  <p>"It happened kind of fast," said one of the men sullenly. "I was taking
  him in front, and Buck here behind. Blacksnake, he jumped out of the doorway,
  and Cobalt sort of exploded. That's all I know what to say. He exploded. He
  seemed to hit us all at once. I went down hard. Through a haze I seen that
  Buck was down, too, and poor Blacksnake, he was in the hands of Cobalt all by
  himself. First he struggled. Then he was just hanging like a rag out of those
  hands, and Cobalt dropped him into the mud and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get out of my sight," breathed Soapy through his teeth.</p>

  <p>They backed up. Soapy slammed the door again. If he had been angry before,
  he was almost hysterical now. Not that he shouted or pranced, but the fury
  showed in his rolling eyes and in the twitching of his lips, now and then,
  which gave him a most animal and frightful appearance.</p>

  <p>Baird, I must say, was a fellow of a great courage. Even then he did not
  keep still, but went at Soapy vigorously. "There's the man you promised not
  be hurt," he stated, "and you've sent three of your best to murder him."</p>

  <p>"Murder him?" asked Soapy, beginning to pace up and down. He laughed a
  little, excess of passion making the noise bubble over at his lips. He
  resumed: "Three of my men were to take him without more than giving him a
  crack over the head, but I wish now that I'd had them poison him. I will.
  I'll have them bump him off. There's room for him with the sharks of the
  Pacific, maybe. There's no room for him in Skagway!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think you'll have him killed," counseled Baird, always surprising
  me with his equable manner.</p>

  <p>"Don't you?" asked Soapy.</p>

  <p>"No," Baird replied. "There's too much honor and decency in you. You're
  not a fellow to break your word of honor which you've given to me."</p>

  <p>One of the men who was holding me broke into a loud, braying laughter.
  Soapy glanced at him, and the glance was enough. The fool cut off his
  laughter so suddenly that he almost choked. I heard him stifle and gag.</p>

  <p>"I've made the promise, and I hope that I'll keep it," continued Soapy,
  "but I've never made a promise that has cost me more. You," he barked at the
  men who held me, "get that trash out of the room!"</p>

  <p>"And do what with him?" asked the one who held me.</p>

  <p>"What do I care?" Soapy shrugged. "Just get him out of here."</p>

  <p>Baird exclaimed. He ran across the cabinet to get to me. He would have
  caught hold of me, I think, but they thrust him off, dragging me through the
  door, and hurried me almost at a run down a small corridor. My brain was
  whirling. I should not have been surprised if the final blow had fallen on me
  from behind at any moment. Then they took me up a short, narrow flight of
  steps, kicked open a door, and thrust me inside.</p>

  <p>"Fan him," said one of them.</p>

  <p>They fanned me. They went through my clothes and took from me nothing but
  my gun and a smaller pocket knife. When they had finished with that, one of
  them said: "Are we gonna waste time over him?"</p>

  <p>"What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"I'd tap him on the head and see how much salt water he can drink."</p>

  <p>"I dunno. The chief didn't say."</p>

  <p>"That's because he didn't care. He said that he didn't care."</p>

  <p>There was this conversation about my life or death being carried on, and I
  was listening with the last hope gradually flickering out.</p>

  <p>"If he don't care," said another, "suppose that we bleed him for what we
  can get."</p>

  <p>"He's got nothing. He looks poor."</p>

  <p>"He's from the inside. He must have something."</p>

  <p>"Soapy don't like it when you bleed without orders."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to get somebody's opinion."</p>

  <p>"My opinion is what I said before. Soak him between the eyes and see how
  far he'll float on the tide."</p>

  <p>I stared about me at the room and the faces. The only window was
  shuttered. The place was as dark as night. One lantern burned on a small deal
  table which stood in the center of the compartment. In a corner there was a
  cot with a thin straw mattress but no bedding on top of it. I knew that the
  stuffing was straw because it stuck out in a bristling handful from one torn
  corner. Worse than all else the miserable room was dripping with moisture.
  There was a dark, shallow pool in one corner, with a limp piece of paper half
  sunk in it. Altogether it was as depressing a cell as I ever have seen.</p>

  <p>"I'm not gonna stay here forever," said one of the men.</p>

  <p>"Let's do something."</p>

  <p>"The gent that makes the wrong step for Soapy never gets a chance to make
  another."</p>

  <p>I blessed that thug for his cool common sense.</p>

  <p>"There's the door to Jess Fair's room," said one. "Jess, he'd know what to
  do with the bird."</p>

  <p>"Go on, Kid. You find out."</p>

  <p>"Yeah," said the Kid, "the rest of you ain't so keen to bother Jess, are
  you?" He sneered back over his shoulder at them as he went toward the door.
  What a face the Kid had! White, scowling, with puckered brows and ferociously
  flaring nostrils, there was still an element of debauched youth in him. He
  had big shoulders and a big, square jaw. He paused by the opposite door and
  knocked gently, almost reverently.</p>

  <p>A quiet voice called out to enter, and the Kid opened the door. I looked
  straight into a room of about the same size as the one we were in, but it was
  arranged more pleasantly. There was at least covering on the cot. Quantities
  of spare clothes hung from pegs along the walls. A small stove burned in the
  center of the room and near the stove, propped back in a chair with his heels
  on the edge of the table, was Jess Fair, reading a magazine. He held it with
  one hand, the read page turned back inside the hollow of his palm. He looked
  across at us with a quiet indifference, as cool and smiling as when he stood
  behind the bar. He showed no surprise at the sight of me.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Chalmers," he said. "Poison might have been better at that,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said frankly. "I think that it might."</p>

  <p>"Shut up, you," snapped the Kid at me. "Hey, Jess, what'll we do with this
  sap? Sock him or tie him?"</p>

  <p>"What's the order?" asked Jess, not even giving me a second glance.</p>

  <p>"There wasn't no particulars. Soapy said he didn't care," came the
  answer.</p>

  <p>"Soaking him takes less time," said Fair.</p>

  <p>"That older guy, that friend of his, has he got a real pull with the
  chief?" asked the Kid, rather anxiously.</p>

  <p>Jess Fair looked at the ceiling and yawned. "Yeah," he said, "I guess he's
  got a pull, all right."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30"></a>XXX. &mdash; THE KID</h2>

  <p class="first">In this manner, by a casual speech, my life was undoubtedly
  saved. When I think back to it, I feel that this incident better illustrated
  the cruel callousness of Soapy's gang than all their murders. To kill me or
  not to kill me was a mere matter of convenience. It was only extraordinary
  that they wasted so much time in debate and, I am sure, if the remark of Jess
  Fair had not turned the situation in my favor, someone of my precious guards
  would have ended the dispute by braining me on the spot. Not that Jess took
  any personal part in the question. He merely delivered the one opinion and
  then, turning his eyes back to his magazine, he recommenced his reading,
  saying in a drowsy murmur: "Shut the door, will you?"</p>

  <p>They shut the door. I noticed that they closed it quietly, as if thus to
  show their respect, and this alone would have been enough to establish Jess
  as a person of importance.</p>

  <p>When they had me again in the other room, the Kid said: "Tie his hands,
  and you birds slide. You find out something about him. Did he bring anything
  out of the inside? If he did, we'll get it. Go on!"</p>

  <p>They thought this idea was a masterpiece. They tied up my hands as he had
  directed, and I was allowed to sit on the bed. The Kid took his place on the
  table, dangling his legs. His head sagged forward and thrust out like the
  head of a great bird. His back sagged and bent forward. He made a cigarette
  out of brown wheat-straw papers and some tobacco in a sack. He lighted it,
  tucked it in a corner of his mouth, and spoke, the cigarette flopping rapidly
  up and down while he talked. It never was shifted from this post until it was
  burned to a butt.</p>

  <p>"That's likely to stick and take off some skin when you peel it away,
  isn't it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Aw, maybe it sticks sometimes," said the Kid. "That don't make no
  difference. That's nothing. What was your lay before you come up North?"</p>

  <p>"My lay? Oh, I was a common 'puncher."</p>

  <p>"Was you? That's no kind of a lay, is it?"</p>

  <p>"It's pretty hard work. It's all right if you like it. Cows and horses, I
  mean, and plenty of roof over your head."</p>

  <p>"You mean sky? Eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"No, I guess you never scrape off your hats ag'in' that roof." The Kid
  grinned a little at his own remark.</p>

  <p>"I've had a mustang buck me up to the rafters of that same little old
  sky," I told him.</p>

  <p>He lost interest in this conversation and yawned, exhaling a quantity of
  thin, blue-brown smoke. Just then we heard Jess Fair cough, a light, barking
  sound in the next room. The Kid listened, canting his head to one side,
  instantly intrigued.</p>

  <p>"Listen to him," he said.</p>

  <p>"It's not a very good-sounding cough."</p>

  <p>"He's cooked," and the Kid nodded in confirmation of his words. "He's
  cooked, all right. You hear that?" He had lowered his voice, so that the
  sound of it might not reach the man on the farther side of the flimsy
  partition. "He just sets there. He can't sleep."</p>

  <p>"The cough keep him awake?"</p>

  <p>"The cough? Yeah. Maybe the cough, partly. He's got something on his
  mind."</p>

  <p>"Nothing seems to bother him a great deal."</p>

  <p>"No. Because he's cooked, and he knows it. That's why he gives you the
  glassy eye. He knows that he's cooked!" He laughed a little, inviting me to
  share in his amusement, but I could not laugh.</p>

  <p>"He knows he's cooked. That's why even Soapy is afraid of him. When you
  know you're cooked, you don't care about nothing. That's the way with Jess
  Fair. That's why he could go and get anybody, because he don't care."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he could get Cobalt?"</p>

  <p>"Cobalt? Oh, that's the strong boy from the inside. Sure, Jess could get
  him. Jess could get anybody. He always has."</p>

  <p>"What's Jess done?"</p>

  <p>The Kid jerked up his head and stared at me. "You think I'm a fool?" he
  snapped. "No, no, brother. I ain't as simple as that. I don't know nothing
  about him. Not a blooming thing. There was a bird up here from Tucson. He
  said he knew a lot about Jess. He comes in and hunches up to the bar, shakes
  hands, and calls Jess by his first name and old hoss. But he lost his memory
  the next day."</p>

  <p>"He shut up, did he?"</p>

  <p>"Sure he shut up." The Kid silently demonstrated by placing a forefinger
  between his eyes and moving the thumb as if on a trigger. "Yeah, he lost his
  memory. He didn't have nothing left to remember with. But Jess is that way.
  He ain't no historian. He hates history, matter of fact."</p>

  <p>I left the subject of Jess Fair. "What was your lay, Kid?"</p>

  <p>"Me?" replied the Kid, puckering his white fleshy brows.</p>

  <p>"Aw, I dunno. I kind of floated around. I punched a cow or two myself," he
  concluded cautiously, eyeing me.</p>

  <p>"Where was that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, around here and there," he said vaguely. Then he warmed up. "I'll
  tell you what, if I'd had a chance, I would've stuck to it. I liked it. I had
  everything from pretty near blizzards to pretty near sunstrokes. But I liked
  it all. Horses like me, if you know what I mean. They take to me, and I take
  to them. There was a little ornery no-'count filly on a ranch that I raised
  on a bottle till she could take to hay and stuff. I raised her myself. They
  used to laugh at me. She'd foller me around. They called me the 'old mare' on
  that outfit. That little beast, I tell you what, she used to come and steal
  lump sugar out of my pocket. She never thought I knew. She was a little
  witch, that filly." He laughed silently at the memory of that distant
  joy.</p>

  <p>"What did you call her?"</p>

  <p>"Her? I called her the Princess. That was what she was like. When spring
  came around, she lost her pot belly, and the way she stepped around, she
  looked like she could gallop on clouds. That was the kind of a look she
  had."</p>

  <p>"What became of her?"</p>

  <p>He scowled at his knuckles. "Well, I moved on. That's all." He stared
  earnestly at me. "You know the way it is. The way some people are, they never
  forget nothing. They never give you a chance." He sighed. "That little witch,
  she come into the bunkhouse after me one day. They was playing poker. She
  stood there and looked on, with the lantern reflected in both of her two
  eyes. She looked like she understood. I called her the Princess. That was
  what she was like!"</p>

  <p>I thought that I could see the slender filly with her eyes like two stars.
  I wondered if she might not have been able to bring the Kid back into a clean
  life. But now she was only a symbol of all that was true and beautiful from
  which the cruelty of justice had parted him.</p>

  <p>We fell silent, partly because the thoughts of the poor Kid were far away
  and, in part, because a strong wind had come up, battering and clattering
  away at the building, slamming doors, rattling shutters, and making
  conversation more or less difficult. So great was the force of the wind that
  the door to the room in which we sat oscillated violently back and forth,
  stopped, and slammed and shuddered noisily again.</p>

  <p>"You've had a rough time of it, Kid."</p>

  <p>"Me? Aw, I don't sob about it," he said hastily, defending his manly
  spirit. "I don't hang around and sob about it none."</p>

  <p>The door opened. In the opening stood not one of the gangsters but Cobalt.
  He closed the door behind him, slamming it carelessly, as though the wind had
  accomplished the thing. The Kid was so thoroughly deceived that he did not
  even turn to look.</p>

  <p>I tried to think of something to say to get the attention of the Kid and
  keep it. But he chose this moment for yawning. Well, I knew that was the end
  for him. Up came Cobalt, tiptoe. The floor creaked under him at the last
  moment, and the Kid jerked his head around to be caught in Cobalt's
  hands.</p>

  <p>Have you seen a cat strike its claws into a bird and seen the poor thing
  flutter and turn limp? Or have you seen a mountain lion strike a young deer
  and watch the deer fall? I have seen those things, and I thought of them as
  the terrible grip of Cobalt paralyzed the Kid with the first pressure. As
  though his fingers were talons, they seemed to drive into the boy. There was
  no question of resistance. Cobalt lifted him from the table. The Kid vaguely
  struggled with his arms and kicked with his legs. Then he was still. He did
  not even cry out. With hypnotized eyes he watched the face of the other.</p>

  <p>"What was it? Jujitsu?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Cobalt placed him on the cot beside me. He stuffed a wadded bandanna into
  the mouth of the boy and lashed it securely in place with a cord. He cut the
  rope from my hands and, with an addition to it from the twine which he
  carried, he trussed the Kid hand and foot.</p>

  <p>I leaned over the boy. "Can you breathe all right, Kid?"</p>

  <p>He jerked his head to signify that he could. He shook his head again,
  looking at Cobalt, as much as to say that no ordinary but a supernatural
  agency had taken him in hand. I almost agreed with him.</p>

  <p>Cobalt was already at the window shutter. He worked it open and told me to
  climb through. I told him to go first, but he took me under the pits of the
  arms and lowered me though the opening like a sack. My feet struck the
  ground, and the cold wind whistled about me. Cobalt jumped down at my
  side.</p>

  <p>At the same time we heard a door open inside the building, and the voice
  of Jess Fair was saying: "Hey, Kid, what's the big idea of all the cold
  air?"</p>

  <p>We waited to hear no more but went hastily down the street.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31"></a>XXXI. &mdash; A LITTLE SMASHING</h2>

  <p class="first">When we had gone a short distance down the street and saw
  that there was no sudden pursuit, I asked Cobalt how he had managed the
  thing. He said that he had seen me enter the place, doubted my safety there,
  and made a tour around the outside. Luckily he heard voices, mine among them,
  so he spotted the room where I was kept and entered by forcing a nearby
  window. As he described the thing, he made it seem the most natural and
  normal act. A thing to be expected of anyone. But I know that the house of
  Soapy Jones was a tower of dread to everyone in Skagway. Not another soul in
  the world, I verily believe, would have dared what Cobalt dared that day.</p>

  <p>It does not seem much compared with his final exploit in Skagway. It
  hardly seems to be a stepping stone to the tremendous achievement with which
  he staggered us all, and which I shall have to describe presently. Yet his
  present exploit of entering the Soapy Jones place was alone enough to shock
  the whole of Skagway into attention, you may be sure.</p>

  <p>As we went down the street, the wind hurling us forward so that we had to
  lean back against it, we fairly stumbled into two other pedestrians who were
  going along with their heads down, bucking against the wind-driven sleet. It
  was the pair who, together with the Kid, had taken me in hand. I made a dive
  for one of them, shouting out to Cobalt. I think I should have had my hands
  full, for the fellow I tackled was a robust rascal but, when the two saw me,
  they were limp with astonishment. They did not even defend themselves. We got
  their guns from them without an effort.</p>

  <p>They kept saying: "Did Soapy do it? Did Soapy turn you loose?"</p>

  <p>"Cobalt pried me away from Soapy. That's all," I said. "And one day he'll
  go back, take an hour off, and kick that whole shack to pieces."</p>

  <p>"I almost think he will!" rasped one of the thugs. "If he's got you away
  from Soapy, he can do anything."</p>

  <p>We took them to the police. The thing was a perfect farce. The moment they
  found out that the two we had with us were accused of being employed by Soapy
  Jones, the police would have nothing to do with the case. I don't think they
  were originally honest fellows whom he had corrupted. They were thugs
  themselves, members of Soapy's gang wearing uniforms.</p>

  <p>They asked me what I had to prove what had happened to me and anything
  that had been done against me by the men who worked for Soapy. I showed them
  my wrists, which the ropes had chafed, and Cobalt told how he had found me
  sitting with my hands tied together and under guard in the dingy room. They
  merely shrugged their shoulders. The two crooks we had taken in with us began
  to feel at home and to make a loud, violent defense of themselves.</p>

  <p>I shall never forget the scene. The storm had covered Skagway with a
  twilight dimness. Two greasy lanterns flickered on the walls of the little
  room. By the stove sat one deputy, his feet wrapped in a quantity of sacking.
  At the desk was another, a desk spotted with many ink stains, though I don't
  think that it was much used for writing purposes. The fellow at the desk had
  a protruding chin and a protruding forehead. When he smiled, he seemed
  embarrassed.</p>

  <p>When we saw that nothing could be done, Cobalt stood for a time with his
  eyes half closed, the old, familiar demon beginning to glisten in them. I
  knew that something was about to happen, as surely as when one sees the
  powder trail burning and the open powder cask to which the fired trail
  leads.</p>

  <p>The thugs and the crooked deputies were beginning to grin at one another
  and enjoy themselves when Cobalt said: "The whole pack of you are a lot of
  thieves and crooks. You're all working for Soapy. I've known it for some
  minutes. But I'll tell you what, boys, I'm going to give him a message. I'm
  going to give him a letter, and you can tell him how I punctuated it, and
  where I made the underlinings. It won't be a long letter, but it will say
  something."</p>

  <p>With that he leaned over and picked up the writing desk. The deputy behind
  it was knocked out of his chair and fell sprawling with a yell, while Cobalt
  poised that heavy mass above his head and hurled it at the stove. It knocked
  that stove to smithereens. It knocked over the second deputy as well, and it
  covered the floor of the shack with rolling coals and flaming brands of
  wood.</p>

  <p>What a screeching and a yelling went up from that pair. The thugs tried to
  get out, but Cobalt threw them back into the place and bolted the door from
  the outside. What a yelling that started then! They were sure that they were
  going to be burned alive, and I suggested the same thing to Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"Don't make much difference," he said, "but they won't burn alive. They'll
  be smoked meat before they get those embers out. They'll be singed meat,
  too."</p>

  <p>That they were. We stood across the street and heard the four screeching
  for help and battering at the wall of the shack for ten minutes. No one came
  to their aid. Well, that was Skagway in the palmy days of its youth.</p>

  <p>Finally they broke open, not the door, but a section of the wall of the
  shack. Three of them pitched out into the mud of the street and wallowed in
  it as if they loved the sty. Then one fellow got up and reeled into the thick
  white smoke that poured out of the shack. He came back dragging the fourth
  and last of the quartet, who had been overcome with the fumes.</p>

  <p>"There's about half a man in that one," commented Cobalt.</p>

  <p>I could agree with this, but a moment later the whole four spotted us,
  where we stood howling with laughter across the street. I thought they would
  go mad. They danced and raved and tore, and the two deputies started on the
  run to arrest us. The other thugs held them back. What they said to them did
  not take long, but it was enough. Those deputies stopped short, like dogs
  when they run out of a village to chase coyotes and find a wolf instead.</p>

  <p>Cobalt and I went on together unharmed, and I was very thankful to heaven
  and to Cobalt for the dangers he had put behind me this day. We went to the
  hotel, and there he turned in with me.</p>

  <p>"They've had time to think things over. It won't hurt if I go in and talk
  to them a little now?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>I insisted that it was high time that he should do so, but I'm afraid that
  there was not much heartiness in my voice. When we walked in, the proprietor
  stared at us with open mouth. How much did he know? I never could tell. I
  could only guess that he was a complete scoundrel.</p>

  <p>"Out again, you see," I said with mock cheerfulness to him.</p>

  <p>He did not reply. He gaped only wider, and his face grew more pouchy, I
  thought, as we walked by him.</p>

  <p>"He's one of them, all right," said Cobalt. "You're in a snake's den
  here."</p>

  <p>I felt that we were, but how was it possible to get a better place in
  Skagway? I could hear the excited voice of Baird before we got to the room
  and, when we knocked on the door and he saw us standing there, it warmed my
  heart to hear the way he shouted out his pleasure and dragged me in, thumped
  me on the shoulder, and swore even then he had been mourning for me.</p>

  <p>"That fiend of a Soapy Jones hates you. He's withdrawn all his promises.
  He swears that he'll start with you and finish by making hash of Cobalt.
  Cobalt, why have you crossed him so often?"</p>

  <p>"Because he's been in my way," said Cobalt, and it was a characteristic
  answer.</p>

  <p>Sylvia was eating ham and hot cakes with plum jam, a frightful
  combination, but one gets peculiar hankerings after the diet on the inside.
  She had a great pot of steaming coffee beside her and a stack of pancakes a
  foot high. Now she stood up and told us to finish off for her.</p>

  <p>So we sat down. Up there in the North it seems as though everyone is
  always hungry. Food is as welcome a sight as bank notes in milder climates.
  Sylvia stood by, simply passing things to us. It was her father who did the
  questioning.</p>

  <p>"What happened?" he asked. "Where did they take you? Did Soapy change his
  mind at last?"</p>

  <p>"Cobalt pried me loose from Soapy's gang," I answered. "He came into the
  house, and he got me loose from them. He says it was simple."</p>

  <p>We all took a turn looking at Cobalt, but his face was hidden behind a
  tilted mug of coffee. "They've got a lot of chicory in this coffee," he
  commented. "Hand me another slab of those hot cakes, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>He heaped his plate again. That furnace of his needed continual
  stoking.</p>

  <p>"You can't pass it off like this, Cobalt," said Baird. "It was a grand
  thing. I think that I'd rather knock at Satan's gate than go near that place
  again. Soapy is a madman now. Some of his best men have been manhandled.
  You've done him a great deal of harm. His gang takes it to heart that they
  haven't been sent on your trail from the first in numbers, not to take you
  but to murder you. That would be safer. They say that they might as well be
  sent to bait a grizzly bear. I think they're right. I was a witness of a half
  riot that started in Soapy's office, if that's what one can call it. They
  want your blood, Cobalt, and my solemn advice to you, son, is to clear out of
  Skagway and get as far inside as you can, as fast as you can. There's nothing
  but poison waiting for you here."</p>

  <p>Cobalt nodded cheerfully at him. "Do you think I'll back down? Not I! Not
  for fifty like Soapy. The bartender, though, is a different matter. I think
  if there were only two like him, I'd give him plenty of room. It's good
  advice. It's kind advice, Baird, but I'll stay on here and try my hand with
  Soapy first."</p>

  <p>When he had said this, he turned and looked deliberately at the girl. One
  could tell what he meant. It would be Soapy and the gang first. Afterward
  came Sylvia.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32"></a>XXXII. &mdash; THE RIGHT CLUB</h2>

  <p class="first">I was sorry that Cobalt had to ring in his unfortunate
  attitude toward Sylvia at the very moment when we were all looking up to him
  as a sort of demigod. Silence fell upon us, but out of the silence came
  something of the old sharp hostility. I could see the eyes of Sylvia turn
  bright and cold, and the jaw of her father was set.</p>

  <p>Sylvia went on serving until the edge of that vast appetite of his had
  been dulled. Then she said: "Make yourself a smoke, Cobalt?"</p>

  <p>He had no makings. So she took mine and manufactured a cigarette for him.
  I wondered why she had learned the rather difficult and delicate little art
  of making cigarettes when she herself never smoked them. At any rate she made
  the cigarette, presented it to him for moistening, finished it off, gave it
  into his hand, then lighted and held the match for him. As the first big
  exhalations of smoke went upward, she stood there beside him and looked down
  at him through the smoke.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Cobalt."</p>

  <p>"Aye," said Cobalt. "Now that you've soothed me, you can use the club on
  the poor beast."</p>

  <p>She brushed the smoke apart a little with her hand. "I'm only going to
  tell you the truth, Cobalt."</p>

  <p>"Let me hear it then."</p>

  <p>"It's this. It's the reason why you won't want me any longer."</p>

  <p>"Go on," he urged. He actually smiled at her.</p>

  <p>"It's because I care for another man."</p>

  <p>This struck me, I know, with a great shock. It seemed to strike her father
  also, hard enough to bring him out of his chair, but Cobalt merely shrugged
  his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You remember the story I once told you, my dear?" he asked her. "About
  the thief and the emerald? Would the thief have cared where the emerald
  wanted to go or what the emerald felt about him?"</p>

  <p>"You don't mean it," said Sylvia. "You're not as hard as you make out.
  You're a terribly great fighting man, Cobalt, but your heart is not so hard
  as you make out. It does make a difference to you. Particularly when you know
  that it's a friend of yours."</p>

  <p>"Ah? And what do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"A friend whose life you've saved, and who has saved yours. That's what I
  mean."</p>

  <p>Cobalt stood up at last and gave me such a look as no man receives twice
  from another. "You mean Chalmers?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Sylvia. "That's who I mean."</p>

  <p>I could not speak. I wish to heaven that I could have spoken. It would
  have meant all the difference afterward. I could only stand there mute, like
  a fool, with a ringing in my ears that came from the thunderstrokes of my
  heart. I heard the voice of Cobalt speaking, and the sound of it was wooden
  and dead, saying: "Well, that's right, Sylvia. You've picked out the right
  club. It's the only club in the world that would have stopped me, I suppose.
  But you've stopped me now. I'll go out and get a little air."</p>

  <p>He went past us, three standing clay figures, and the door closed gently
  behind him. Baird recovered himself before I did. He was greatly excited and,
  going up to Sylvia, he caught her by the hands and shook them, not in
  congratulation but with a vigorous impatience.</p>

  <p>"Did you honestly mean it, Sylvia? Or was it only a ruse?"</p>

  <p>She nodded her head. She had the look of a sleepwalker. "Yes, I mean
  it."</p>

  <p>Baird seemed to feel that he could get no more out of her. He turned back
  to me, crying: "How long has this been going on? What's been between the two
  of you?"</p>

  <p>I made a helpless gesture. My brain was still spinning. "I don't know
  anything about it. She's flirted with me a little. She'd flirt with a wooden
  Indian for lack of something better. But I never knew that she cared a rap. I
  still don't think she does."</p>

  <p>"I do," stated Sylvia, "but I've been shameless. I haven't asked if you
  care a rap about me, Tommy."</p>

  <p>"This is the most extraordinary thing I've ever heard of," said Baird.
  "You mean Tom Chalmers hasn't spoken to you, and yet you talk like that to
  Cobalt?"</p>

  <p>"Do you want to call Cobalt back?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>He threw up both his hands. "Great heavens, no! Let him stay away. I'd
  rather have you committed to the arms of an avalanche than to see you married
  to that man. But Chalmers&mdash;why, he's older, he's married, he has
  children."</p>

  <p>"He's only thirty-two," said the girl. "He has a pair of darling
  youngsters. Don't you think that I'll be glad to have them for mine and
  mother them?"</p>

  <p>"I'm beaten!" said Baird. "I don't know what to think or to say."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think or say a thing," she commanded. "Let water run downhill.
  That's the best way. Tommy, you tell me, and let father hear. Do you think
  you can come to care about me?"</p>

  <p>She came across the room toward me. I stepped behind a chair. At that she
  stopped. She let her head fall a little on one side. Her great blue eyes were
  soft with a sort of despair.</p>

  <p>"You don't want me, Tommy. Is that it?"</p>

  <p>"Look here, Sylvia, you know mighty well what I mean."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to get out of here," said Baird.</p>

  <p>"You stay right where you are," I called after him.</p>

  <p>He turned at the door and looked back. "I don't want to interfere in your
  private affairs with Sylvia. I can't stay here."</p>

  <p>"You can though," I insisted. "I want you to stay long enough to explain
  why you're in a sweat."</p>

  <p>"I've heard and seen enough in the last five minutes to make an Egyptian
  statue break out in a sweat," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll tell you why you're in a sweat. You're thinking that I'm
  nothing but a fellow on the make. A chap with a small bit of money, no great
  ambitions, and nothing but the hope of running cows on some range land ahead
  of him. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>He came half way back across the room.</p>

  <p>"Oh, talk to him, Daddy," pleaded the girl. "Try to persuade him for me. I
  know that you love Tom."</p>

  <p>"I respect you, Tom," said Baird. "I have an affection for you. You've
  done a grand thing for me and for Sylvia, and I realize it. Don't think I
  don't. There's no other man in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's all right," I broke in. "Now let's have the other side."</p>

  <p>"You've expressed the other side," replied Baird. "I mean, Sylvia is
  growing up toward another sort of life than what you offer to her."</p>

  <p>"You mean, you don't want to picture her in the kitchen of a small ranch
  house, washing dishes and turning around to see that the boiling beans still
  have enough water on 'em. Is that it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's about it."</p>

  <p>"You see how it is, Sylvia," I said to her.</p>

  <p>"All of this has nothing to do with it," argued the girl. "You have to
  tell me whether you care about me, or not."</p>

  <p>"You're wrong again," I told her. "You know that every man in the world
  who has seen you cares about you, either as the thief cared for the emerald
  or as someone he wants for a real wife. I care for you in both ways somewhat.
  You know that I do. But I'm afraid of you. Besides, you'd always be in second
  place in my home."</p>

  <p>"Is there someone else?" Sylvia asked.</p>

  <p>"There's my dead wife."</p>

  <p>Baird muttered: "This is too painful. I'm going out, Sylvia. Perhaps you'd
  better talk about this another time?"</p>

  <p>"We'll talk it out now," insisted Sylvia, "if Tom doesn't mind."</p>

  <p>"Go on," I said. "I'm glad to talk it out and have it done with."</p>

  <p>"I swear," said Sylvia, "that I never would be jealous of her poor, kind
  ghost."</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "But I would always be making comparisons. You're ten
  times cleverer than she was. And you're a thousand times more beautiful. But
  she was as clear as crystal. You take a mountain spring, Sylvia,&mdash;it may
  not be very big, and it may not be very important, but almost anybody could
  sit a day and look down at the water bubbling and listen to its song."</p>

  <p>"You mean," she said, "I'm complicated? I'm really not. A little play-
  acting&mdash;I'll wipe that out, if you want."</p>

  <p>"To change your mind would be to spoil you," I told her. I think that I
  was right. "Great Scott, Sylvia, to kiss the tips of your fingers would be
  joy enough to make me giddy. That's all very well. But I see the truth of
  this situation. You've only used me to shunt poor Cobalt away. You'd&mdash;by
  heaven, now I think that I see the truth!"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"Stand away from me, then," I said. "When you're so close, Sylvia, I begin
  to forget everything. I can't think. But isn't this true? There's another man
  you like a lot better than you like me."</p>

  <p>"I? Nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"There is. Confess it!"</p>

  <p>"You're an odd man, Tommy." There was a shadow in her eyes. "But you know,
  I think if we lived together, we would each grow to love more and more. I've
  never met anyone so gentle and understanding as you are."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," I said. "But now, look here! Suppose I name the other man for
  you, the man you like better but are afraid of."</p>

  <p>"Stuff!" Sylvia went back a step from me and seemed alarmed.</p>

  <p>"I saw it in your face a while ago," I declared. "I saw it when you stood
  yonder and parted the smoke and looked down into his face. You're afraid he's
  too great a force, that he'd dash you around the world, you don't know where.
  You'd rather dodge him and attach yourself to me, because I'm harmless, and
  because somehow Cobalt won't persecute you so long as you're with me. But
  Cobalt is the man you love. Stand there and honestly tell me whether I'm
  right or wrong?"</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33"></a>XXXIII. &mdash; SYLVIA GOES NATIVE</h2>

  <p class="first">I cannot say exactly how the idea came popping into my
  brain. Perhaps it was the memory of a certain curious tenderness I had seen
  in her face as she stood before Cobalt. I was continually studying her
  expression. Her words mostly told you nothing. Sometimes they would be
  expressing only the shadow of the real truth about her and, when that thought
  came leaping into my mind, I threw it at her. The result was a shock to me
  and to Baird.</p>

  <p>For Sylvia, the keen, clever, invincible Sylvia, who all her life had done
  exactly as she pleased, who was strong by nature and strong by habit of
  thought, no matter how delicately she disguised her power of brain, this
  Sylvia now looked rather wildly about her, and then she ran to her father and
  like any tiny child threw herself into his arms and began to sob and sway and
  tremble with a passionate grief. The Lightning Warrior came out of the corner
  in which he had denned himself all this time and crouched nearby, studying
  the situation, trying to make out whether or not the girl was being attacked
  and ready to cut the hand of the attacker.</p>

  <p>That was a picture and a thing to hear as well, what with the wild sobbing
  of Sylvia, and the voice of the storm wind that was mourning outside. I
  started out of the room, tiptoeing. Baird stopped me.</p>

  <p>"You'd better stay here and see this thing through with us. You're
  qualified, I'd say, as a sort of second father to her, Tom. You've seen
  through her as I never would have."</p>

  <p>I stopped, of course. Sylvia left her father's arms, went over, and threw
  herself on the bed. There she lay, still shaken by her sobbing. Baird wanted
  to go to her, but I held onto him.</p>

  <p>"Don't you go," I said in a whisper. "She's having it out with herself.
  There's a pack of wildcats screeching and clawing in her just about now."</p>

  <p>He mopped his wet face and grunted, but he took my advice. The storm in
  her ended. The sobbing ceased. She lay still for a moment, and then she got
  up and went to the washstand. I poured some water into the bowl. While she
  washed her face, lifting the icy water in her cupped hands and holding it a
  long moment in place, I picked a towel off the rack and gave it to her so she
  could dry with it. Then I got a cup of coffee for her.</p>

  <p>She sat down at the table and reached blindly for me, giving my hand a
  squeeze. Baird stood by as one who looks from a distance on a strange
  happening. At last the tremors left her, and the cup of coffee was
  finished.</p>

  <p>"I wish that I smoked," said Sylvia. "I wish that I smoked! That would be
  comfortable now. I'm going to learn."</p>

  <p>She never would, I knew. She never would foul her hands with yellow or
  stain her lips with tar and nicotine.</p>

  <p>"You talk, father," she proposed. "You suggest what we should do."</p>

  <p>Poor Baird had remained standing stock-still. Now he shook his head. "You
  know, Sylvia, that there's not much in me that can be useful for you in the
  way of advice. I've never really understood you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's why I've always loved you so," said Sylvia. "You try,
  Tommy."</p>

  <p>"I think Cobalt ought to be in on this," I said.</p>

  <p>"No!" she cried out hoarsely.</p>

  <p>I was astonished and shocked by her vehemence.</p>

  <p>She went on: "You're tired, Tommy, or you wouldn't suggest that, since
  you've seen so much. You know I've been hypnotized by Cobalt from the first.
  But I feel that it's merely hypnosis and, if ever I belonged to him, some
  terrible thing would happen. I think of him as one might think of
  murder."</p>

  <p>I stood up and said I was going to bed. My poor brain was not worth a rap,
  it was so befogged. So I went to the door and got to the room which Baird and
  I occupied. He followed me in just as I covered up as warmly as I could. Both
  in brain and body, all the strength was out of me.</p>

  <p>"She wants to be alone," said Baird. "I don't know why. I wish to heaven I
  could see a way out of this. But I can't. There are too many threads. While
  we struggle with our own little problems, we forget that we're all caught in
  the spider's web, Soapy and his Skagway gang. That would be enough by itself,
  but with this other added&mdash;I don't know, not unless Cobalt himself
  breaks the web."</p>

  <p>I shook my head. Sleep was coming over my mind like dark clouds in the
  sky. "He can't do that. Not even Cobalt can do that. One man, two men, even
  half a dozen. Yes, he could handle them. But this is different. Here you have
  something extra. Here you have Soapy and his cohorts. And there is that
  smiling young demon, that Jess Fair."</p>

  <p>"The bartender with the buck teeth?" asked Baird. "What of him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you'll hear of him before the wind-up," I remember muttering. Then
  blessed sleep came over me, as rain comes over a dry land.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34"></a>XXXIV. &mdash; BUCKING THE THUGS</h2>

  <p class="first">I should have been there, though I have heard accounts from
  so many eyewitnesses that my absence hardly matters. After all, I could not
  have been inside the brains of those who were in action. Each word, look,
  gesture, intonation has been mentioned to me, I'm sure, at one time or
  another. For what did Skagway have to think about afterward? What else was
  there to talk about? At any rate there is no use crying over spilled milk. I
  was asleep when the crash came. I was up there in my room, sound asleep, and
  poor Baird was in the same room also, softly cursing my snoring but too
  sympathetic to awaken me.</p>

  <p>I slept and dreamed of Sylvia, of course. Her delicate grace, as I
  remember, I found turned into a beautiful painting all the life of her
  transformed into a brilliant shadow by the grace of the powers of this world
  who wanted to preserve her as she was forever, never aging, undying. While I
  dreamed, Cobalt was in the street.</p>

  <p>When he got to the entrance of the hotel, he paused for a moment in the
  doorway and looked over the men who were lounging there. They were
  chattering, laughing, joking. When they saw him, they became silent. Skagway
  knew Cobalt by this time, you may be sure! The latest comers and the oldest
  dwellers knew all about him. He had split open the mind of the town and put a
  new picture inside of it, so that the murders and the robberies of Soapy's
  gang were no longer the only important themes of current news about which to
  gossip.</p>

  <p>One of the men by the stove said: "I beg your pardon, Mister Cobalt, but
  is it true&mdash; ?"</p>

  <p>"Not 'mister,'" said Cobalt. "I never wear a title, man. This is a little
  too far north for titles."</p>

  <p>He went out into the street without waiting for the other man to complete
  his remark. I suppose it would have been a question about one of Cobalt's
  famous feats on the inside.</p>

  <p>There in the street, where the wind howled and beat, Cobalt was seen to
  stride up and down for some time. What was going through his wild brain at
  that time? Well, I suppose that it was the same theme that filled my poor
  brain as I slept&mdash;beautiful Sylvia. Perhaps he had a few thoughts for me
  also. I dare say, he must have wondered how she could give herself to an
  unimportant chap like me, a comparative weakling. It must have been the
  bitterest gall to him. A sense of vast defeat too must have been in his mind.
  He had never failed before, when he bent all his will to the work, but now he
  had failed miserably.</p>

  <p>I don't know what he would have done, if chance had not given a direction
  to his misery. As he walked through the cold, driving mist of the storm, he
  heard a groaning, cursing voice ahead, and a big man came stalking through
  the dimness, walking with uneven strides. Cobalt listened, drinking in the
  sound of another's sorrow. Then he took the other by the arm.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The big man cursed him and tried to shake him off. Of course, he merely
  shook himself, not Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" persisted Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"Get your hand off me," shouted the big man, all his grief turning into
  rage, and he raised a big fist to strike.</p>

  <p>Cobalt picked the fist out of the air and pulled it down. "Now tell me,
  what's the matter?"</p>

  <p>The other grunted. "It's Cobalt," he said. "I didn't know you in the whip
  of the wind. Aw, it's nothing, Cobalt. They've trimmed me. That's all. Not
  much. I had a hundred ounces. It ain't a fortune. But it was all that I
  brought out with me."</p>

  <p>"Soapy?" asked Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. Who but him?"</p>

  <p>"One of the crooked machines? You gambled on 'em?"</p>

  <p>"I started. I wasn't losing fast enough. They rolled me. They soaked me
  and rolled me for my wad. That's all. It happens every day."</p>

  <p>"It's too bad," said Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"It ain't the money," said the stranger. "It's me being such a fool.
  That's what grinds on me. Look at me! Forty-eight. Born with nacheral good
  sense. Now, see what's happened to me. I'll have to go back inside. I'd
  rather walk into fire and brimstone."</p>

  <p>"Why not go another place for your money?"</p>

  <p>"Hey? What?"</p>

  <p>"Why not make a shorter trip to get your dust?"</p>

  <p>"I dunno what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Go to those who have it now. That's a shorter trip than Dawson or Circle
  City."</p>

  <p>The stranger laughed. "I'm to go in and ask them for it, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong with that, except that I'd just get rolled again."</p>

  <p>"Everybody gets rolled a few times in his life. Let's go back and see what
  happens."</p>

  <p>"In Soapy's place?" gasped the other.</p>

  <p>"Why, where else? Come along. We'll both ask for it. Two hands are better
  than one."</p>

  <p>"By thunder, I see what you mean. But I'll tell you what. You have nerve
  to do anything, but I haven't. I've had enough of Soapy Jones and his gang. I
  like life pretty well. That's all. I won't go in there again."</p>

  <p>"You don't know yourself," persuaded Cobalt. "The fact is that you're
  aching to get back in there and hand 'em some talk. Tell 'em that they don't
  play fair. Tell 'em anything surprising and new."</p>

  <p>The other laughed. "You're a card, Cobalt. There's nobody like you."</p>

  <p>"Come on, then. You come back with me, and I'll get your money for
  you."</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>"I mean it."</p>

  <p>"Get my money away from those men?"</p>

  <p>"I'll get your money for you, or I'll die trying."</p>

  <p>That was enough. That old-timer thought of his hundred ounces, he told me
  afterward, and he thought of nothing else. He turned right around, and down
  the storm-swept street he went with Cobalt. They came to the door of Soapy's
  place, pushed it open, and entered.</p>

  <p>Of course it was packed. Weather like that would have sent people to any
  hole, for the sake of the warmth alone. Besides, as I have said before, the
  people of Skagway never got tired of gratifying their curiosity and showing
  their courage by going into Soapy's den. I said it was packed. As a matter of
  fact the majority of the people were in the gaming rooms. The bar was not at
  all crowded. Jess Fair was not attending it. He was enjoying a rest, a thing
  he allowed himself for only a few hours every day. Men said that he loved
  nothing in life except to stand there behind the long bar, peddle the drinks,
  and look into the faces of the customers with his pale, expressionless eyes.
  It was another matter, after the new pair entered the big fellow and Cobalt.
  They got at a corner table with a couple of chairs, and there they sat.</p>

  <p>"We'll warm up a little before we start talking," said Cobalt. "What's
  your name?"</p>

  <p>"Joe Porter."</p>

  <p>"All right, Joe. We'll warm up a little, and then we'll begin to argue
  with them."</p>

  <p>"If there's any talk to be done," said Joe Porter, "why shouldn't we do it
  now, before the place gets crowded?"</p>

  <p>"It's crowded now." Cobalt was cool as you please. "That fellow with the
  yellow face in the corner&mdash;that half-breed, or whatever he is&mdash;he's
  one of the bouncers. He's a crowd in himself, if I'm any judge of some of the
  bulges under his clothes. There's another bouncer at the bar and two more
  beside the door. They're all full of guns. Do you pack a gun yourself,
  brother?"</p>

  <p>"I've got an old bull-nosed Forty-Four, but I ain't much with it, and I
  don't aim to use it unless I have to. Self-defense or something like
  that."</p>

  <p>"Well, seventeen hundred dollars is part of yourself. You'd be defending
  that."</p>

  <p>Joe Porter rubbed his knuckles through his beard. "Are you gonna make a
  fight out of this, Cobalt?"</p>

  <p>"There may be a little fighting."</p>

  <p>"Then I dive for the floor," said Porter. "I ain't no hero. I'm for the
  safest place, and the floor's the safest."</p>

  <p>Cobalt laughed. "You're all right, Joe. I like a man who speaks his
  mind."</p>

  <p>"The crowd's thickening up a good deal." Poor Porter was not relishing his
  position a bit.</p>

  <p>The word had gone instantly through the place that Cobalt was there and,
  of course, that was enough to bring people with a rush. They came swarming in
  from the gaming rooms. They thronged before the bar, and every one of them
  had his eye upon Cobalt and Cobalt's rough-looking companion. I suppose that
  crowd was as hard a looking lot as ever gathered into one room.</p>

  <p>"Do you see the fellow who rolled you?" asked Cobalt of his companion.</p>

  <p>Porter took off his hat and rubbed his head. There was a great lump on the
  top of it, where he had been slugged. "Over there," he said. "That fellow
  with the Stetson hat on, the pale-gray hat and the skinny face. He's the one,
  I guess, that done it."</p>

  <p>"Are you only guessing?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I had a drink or two on board."</p>

  <p>"We'll try to find out," stated Cobalt. "Hello, friend!" He signaled to
  the man in the Stetson, and the latter turned slowly toward the table.</p>

  <p>He was a man of middle height with a wizened, evil face. I have seen him
  myself, and his hands, his mouth, the very whites of his eyes were tobacco-
  stained.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" he said to Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"Partner," said Cobalt pleasantly, "sit down with us and have a drink,
  will you?"</p>

  <p>The yellow-stained man hesitated a moment. I have often wondered whether
  fear or courage made him accept the invitation, since he must have seen
  Porter sitting there as big as life, ready to accuse him. But up he came and
  down he sat, signaling to a boy to bring on the drinks. They had a round of
  them. Cobalt turned his drink around and around. He did not taste it. The
  other turned down his glass in a moment.</p>

  <p>He coughed. "The stuff's wildfire!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It gets into the brain, all right," said Cobalt. "What's your name,
  partner?"</p>

  <p>"Name of Louis Trainor," said the thug.</p>

  <p>"Let me introduce a friend of mine. This is Joe Porter. Porter, Mister
  Louis Trainor."</p>

  <p>The two looked at one another without shaking hands.</p>

  <p>"I guess we've met," said Porter.</p>

  <p>"I guess I've seen you somewhere," said the thug.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't my hand you shook," said Porter.</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>"No, it was my head that you knocked on and my poke you entered," said
  Porter.</p>

  <p>Cobalt laughed. The thug followed his lead and laughed in turn. "I don't
  know what he's talking about," he explained to Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"That's a pity," said Cobalt. "Maybe your pockets will remember,
  though."</p>

  <p>"What?" asked Louis Trainor.</p>

  <p>"Maybe your pockets will remember," said Cobalt again. "Turn them out and
  let's see what's in them."</p>

  <p>Louis Trainor was not a fool, and he was not a coward. His hands twitched
  once, and then they remained still on the edge of the table. His eye shrank
  from the steady gaze of Cobalt and wandered, first to the right and then to
  the left with significant glances.</p>

  <p>"You help him," Cobalt said to Porter. "You see that he is feeling pretty
  tired and doesn't want to budge his hands from the edge of the table. One
  would think that he even felt it was dangerous to move those hands. So you
  just dip into his pockets for him, will you?" Porter, grinning, half
  frightened, surveyed the crowd around them. Everyone was interested, but no
  one seemed inclined to interfere. The whole thing had been so soft-voiced
  that no one of the spectators could be actually sure of what was taking
  place. But they began to suspect when they saw Porter go through the pockets
  and up the sleeves of Trainor. He pulled out of them a queer heap of
  things.</p>

  <p>From a breast pocket of the coat he took a handkerchief with a moistened
  corner and a red-and-blue chemical crayon for marking cards. From a side coat
  pocket he took a slingshot with an elastic wristband. From the belt of Louis
  Trainor he removed two knives, one a regular Bowie, the other a slender
  sailor's dirk. He also got from Trainor a deck of cards, probably already
  prepared to be slipped in the place of an honest deck. He took out a good
  revolver, .32 caliber. Trainor, in his shooting, apparently did not wish to
  strike heavy blows but deadly ones. Porter found, finally, a gold belt
  strapped about the waist of the thug. In it there was a considerable quantity
  of dust. Cobalt weighed it with his hand.</p>

  <p>"About forty ounces in this," he said. "Where's the other sixty, Trainor?
  Did the house take all that for a commission, or did you split a part of it
  with your pals?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," said Trainor.</p>

  <p>He looked wildly about him and savagely. The crowd was half laughing and
  half growling. The pile of crooked implements on the table was a sufficient
  comment upon the character of Trainor, and even a complete thug has some
  scruples of conscience about seeing himself exposed.</p>

  <p>"You go up and invite me to sit down here," said Trainor, "and you order
  up drinks, and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And then I take a look at you," said Cobalt, "and I think your lining
  will be more interesting than your exterior. I seem to be right."</p>

  <p>"I'll get your&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you stir those hands," said Cobalt, almost under his breath, "I'll
  take you and break you in two. Now listen to me. I want to learn what you did
  with the other sixty ounces. You got those forty from this fellow, didn't
  you? You're the one who rapped him over the head and rolled him for his wad,
  aren't you?"</p>

  <p>He was so quiet that Trainor looked at him twice before he understood that
  there was a tiger, and not a man, sitting there before him at the table.</p>

  <p>He moistened his stained lips, and then he said: "I rapped him. I wish I'd
  smashed his skull in for him. I slugged the fool, and I rolled him.
  And&mdash;" He hesitated, and then he went on, seeing the danger in Cobalt's
  face: "I got twenty ounces. Twenty went to my side-kicker. Sixty went to the
  house. It's a hog."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35"></a>XXXV. &mdash; A SHOWDOWN IN SIGHT</h2>

  <p class="first">"We'll take the forty ounces for security," said Cobalt,
  after he had heard the confession of the yegg. "We'll back the house for the
  rest. That sounds fair, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>Trainor said nothing for the good reason that there was nothing to say. He
  got up suddenly and walked off into the crowd, leaving his crooked implements
  behind him on the table. Men sneered at him and shouldered him as he passed,
  for his villainy had been too clearly exposed. He would never again be a
  useful member of any gaming house in the Northland.</p>

  <p>He pressed through, regardless of the looks and hard words that he got
  from all sides. In the farthest corner he found a bouncer and said to him:
  "What's your job? To stand around and watch holdups in the shop?"</p>

  <p>"You dirty crook," said the bouncer pleasantly, "I wish that I'd had the
  picking of your pockets myself. What do I care what happens to you in this
  shop? It's happening to you and not to the shop. It's just another act to
  keep the show running good and smooth. Don't stick out your jaw at me, or
  I'll bust it for you."</p>

  <p>"You know that chief wants us to pull together," Trainor reminded him.</p>

  <p>"The best thing that the chief could do," replied the bouncer, "would be
  to slam you out into the street. You're no good. You're a spoiled egg in this
  house from now on."</p>

  <p>Trainor regarded him wickedly but seemed to see that there was something
  of truth in what he had heard. Therefore he walked on. He tried another
  bouncer with the same results.</p>

  <p>Finally he saw that there was nothing to be gained directly from others.
  He said to a third of these fighting men: "Bill, lemme have the loan of a
  gun, will you?"</p>

  <p>"So you can use it, or so you can hock it?" queried Bill.</p>

  <p>"So I can use it."</p>

  <p>"Well, all right," agreed Bill. "It ain't natural for me to keep a man out
  of a fight if I see a good way of getting him into it. Here's a gat. Go and
  use it, but use it good. That gun has told the truth to four men in its
  day."</p>

  <p>"I'll use it like an angel, and no mistake," swore Trainor, and he turned
  to make good his promise.</p>

  <p>He was the cornered rat now ready to show his teeth but, as he turned
  toward the table at which big Joe Porter and Cobalt had been sitting, other
  things were happening in the room. I have often wondered and often asked how
  it was that Cobalt was able to sit in that room so long before an attack was
  made upon him? I have often asked, but the answer was always a mere
  conjecture. Probably, in a case of such importance, the bouncers wanted an
  order directly from Soapy or from his lieutenant, Jess Fair.</p>

  <p>As soon as Trainor left the table, Cobalt singled out a lanky fellow with
  a sour, dignified look. You could not tell whether his pride was mostly his
  nature or simply a stiff neck. Cobalt called him over, and the fellow came
  suspiciously. He was not one to let himself be trapped, as Trainor had been
  trapped, by getting within the reach of those famous and terrible hands of
  Cobalt.</p>

  <p>Instead, he paused at a little distance. The crowd gave back suddenly to a
  good distance. For this looked like a gun play. They got so completely out of
  the way that Cobalt could talk to this ruffian without much danger of being
  over-heard.</p>

  <p>"You're Booze Gabriel, aren't you?" asked Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. There's some that call me that."</p>

  <p>"You're the finest fighting man that Soapy has, they tell me. The finest
  fighting man in Skagway. Is that right?"</p>

  <p>"Are you aiming to kid me? D'you think that I rate myself along with Jess
  Fair?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jess is in a class all by himself," conceded Cobalt with a wave of
  his hand, indicating the exception. "I was meaning among the regular run.
  They tell me that you're one of the best."</p>

  <p>"I ain't here to brag," said Booze Gabriel. "What are you driving at,
  Cobalt? Is it me that you want to break up next?"</p>

  <p>What a curious thing it must have been to see Cobalt there in that saloon
  surrounded by enough guns to blow him off the earth and out of all
  recognition. Yet he could pick a man out of the crowd and make even the hired
  ruffians come to his call.</p>

  <p>"Will you sit down and liquor with us?" invited Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"No. This is my day for standing," countered Gabriel with a grand,
  stretching grin that suddenly made him look like a wolf. "I ain't sitting
  down today."</p>

  <p>"All right," nodded Cobalt, "maybe you can make a better speech standing
  up. A lot of the greatest orators like to be standing, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"What kind of a speech am I going to make?"</p>

  <p>"You're going to tell me what's what about Soapy Jones."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am, am I?" drawled Gabriel.</p>

  <p>"You are," went on Cobalt. "I've heard a lot of rot about him, since I
  came to Skagway. A lot of people say that you boys throw in with him partly
  because you're afraid to stay out and partly because of the money that you
  make working for him."</p>

  <p>"And what's your idea about that?" asked Booze, cautiously trying out his
  man.</p>

  <p>"My idea is that you all know down in your boots that Soapy is one man in
  a million."</p>

  <p>"You're right. He's one man in ten million," agreed Booze Gabriel
  emphatically.</p>

  <p>"That's why you stay on with him. Thuggery isn't all the truth about him.
  What is the truth, Booze?"</p>

  <p>"Why, this here talk is takin' a kind of a strange turn, where I would
  like to say that Soapy Jones ain't wearin' his right moniker. I ain't tellin'
  nothing. I'm only saying that Soapy ain't wearin' the true moniker that
  belongs to him."</p>

  <p>"Of course, he's not," agreed Cobalt. "He wouldn't hurt his family. He
  wouldn't drag them down by letting the weight of his reputation fall on their
  necks."</p>

  <p>"No, he wouldn't." Booze Gabriel straightened a little. "The fact is that
  Soapy's a gentleman and don't you make no mistake."</p>

  <p>"That's not the mistake that I'm making." Suddenly Cobalt laughed. The
  whole crowd could hear him say: "Great Scott, Booze, would I be here if I
  didn't know that Soapy's a gentleman?"</p>

  <p>That was a poser for them. They looked at Cobalt then at one another.
  Soapy Jones, a gentleman? That was a new conception, to be sure. Cobalt went
  on developing his theme: "The fact is, Booze, that a gentleman once is a
  gentleman always. That's the point, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You bet it's the point," said Booze Gabriel. "And I've known
  Soapy&mdash;" He stopped himself.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Cobalt, "you've known him for years, haven't you? And
  you've always known what he is at heart. That's why you're with him. Am I
  right?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, you're right!"</p>

  <p>"And that's why I'm sitting here in his saloon," Cobalt asserted. "Because
  I trust him."</p>

  <p>That was about as odd a speech as ever was heard in Skagway. It stunned
  the crowd that listened. A stir and a murmur passed though the listeners,
  hearing, as they thought, that Cobalt was making overtures to the master
  criminal of the town. For I think that most of the law-abiding men had begun
  to hope that Cobalt, out of the greatness of his strength, might provide the
  rock on which Soapy was at last to split.</p>

  <p>"You're here because you trust him," echoed Booze Gabriel, not
  comprehending at all.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I am. It's because I know a gentleman's reactions. He may tap
  a few fools on the head, here and there&mdash;not referring to you,
  Porter&mdash; and he may slip a knife into somebody's gizzard from time to
  time. He may mark a card, and he may put a brake on a roulette wheel. But his
  instincts are right when it comes to a pinch. So I came in here with my
  friend, Porter. I want to talk to Mister Jones. I know he will realize that
  the time has come for him to step out in person. Another day he might send
  one of his agents, to speak to another man. But the time has come when I have
  to see him face to face, and he has to see me. We both know it."</p>

  <p>He pointed. People suddenly turned their heads toward the farther doorway,
  expecting something to appear at once. "I know," Cobalt resumed, "that he
  won't even come into the room behind me. He'll come through that doorway, so
  that we can face one another as gentlemen should."</p>

  <p>Booze Gabriel straightened even more, and his color brightened as well. I
  believe it was a fact that he had long been devoted to Soapy. He was the same
  as others of the gang like Jess Fair who had followed Soapy for years with a
  strange fascination. "I'll tell you what," Gabriel assured Cobalt, "my boss
  will meet anyone, any time, on his own level. Are you asking to meet Soapy
  now?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm asking," Cobalt stated.</p>

  <p>"All right," said Gabriel. "I'm gonna go and tell him so." He turned on
  his heel briskly, smartly like a soldier, and marched out of the room, the
  crowd making way for him.</p>

  <p>Joe Porter said softly: "You ain't gonna do it, Cobalt?"</p>

  <p>"No? Why not?"</p>

  <p>"If you do, you're a dead man."</p>

  <p>"How's that?"</p>

  <p>"You're dead on two counts. One is that Soapy himself is a regular wizard
  with guns. They say that he's as slick, almost, as Jess Fair when it comes to
  pulling a Colt and using it, front end or back. And the second count is, even
  if you drop Soapy, his boys will load you full of lead afterward. You can't
  get past those two counts."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I can't, but I'm going to try."</p>

  <p>"You ain't. You're going to get out of here, and you're going to get
  quick!"</p>

  <p>Cobalt merely smiled at him.</p>

  <p>"You're a dead man otherwise." Porter repeated. "I'll have you on my
  conscience all the rest of my days."</p>

  <p>"I'm nothing to have on your conscience. If I live, or if I die, there's
  nothing much to have on your conscience, Porter. Life's not a song to me. The
  taste has gone from it."</p>

  <p>Porter argued no longer. He sank back in his chair and sat there, rigidly
  waiting. When he looked around the room, he saw that everybody else in the
  place was waiting in the same manner and that all realized, like him, that
  the showdown between Cobalt and Soapy Jones was about to follow.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36"></a>XXXVI. &mdash; A NECKTIE PARTY</h2>

  <p class="first">What did occur at this particular point was a blank for many
  years. It was never filled in until a party of Wyoming cowpunchers got on the
  trail of a man suspected of being a horse thief. Wyoming men ride hard. They
  don't fear dim trails, and they don't spare their mounts. So they caught that
  fellow on the second day of the ride, up near the state border, and they
  examined him under the shade of a spruce. The examination did not last long,
  for he was riding on a good gray mare which belonged to one of the members of
  the party. He was a horse thief and, when he was pressed, admitted that he
  had "borrowed" the mare. Horse thieves are not popular anywhere in the West
  but, it is said, they are least of all popular in Wyoming. At any rate the
  thief in this case was told to commend his soul to the infinite mercy of a
  better world, for he was about to be started toward it within the next few
  seconds.</p>

  <p>At this it is said that he merely blinked once or twice and then admitted
  the justice of the sentence. He even said that he had once helped at the
  execution of a horse thief himself. Having thus opened the conversation,
  while they were preparing the rope and going through other formalities, such
  as the selection of a limb, the posse talked with their condemned man and
  asked his name. He said that his name was Gabriel, and that most people
  called him Booze. At this, one of those present cried out that he had seen
  this fellow before on a certain day in the saloon of Soapy Jones in Skagway,
  and that he had always wondered how Soapy had been worked on to come out to
  the fight that followed instead of simply sending a few of his henchmen to
  murder Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you about that," said Booze Gabriel. "I'll tell it to you
  short, and I'll tell it to you true."</p>

  <p>The leader of the posse sat down on a rock and laid the noosed rope
  aside.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Booze," he said. "The better you tell it, the higher we'll hoist
  you, and the quicker you'll finish. We'll snuff you out just like a
  shot."</p>

  <p>"That's good," said Booze, "because it's not the dying but the choking
  that kind of bothers me." Then he proceeded with his story as follows:</p>

  <p>When he left the barroom, he went straight back to the office of his
  chief, but there was no answer to the code rap which he gave upon the door.
  This did not trouble him, since Soapy was often out of the place. Then he
  went upstairs and tried Soapy's bedroom door. After he had knocked twice
  here, using the same code tap, he heard the creak of a bed, and Soapy
  presently unbarred the door to him. His face was puffed, and his eyes were
  wrinkled with sleep, which he began to rub out of them as he asked Booze,
  with several oaths, what the matter was.</p>

  <p>"Soapy," answered Gabriel, "there's a gentleman downstairs asking for
  Mister Jones."</p>

  <p>Soapy laughed in his face. "For 'Mister' Jones he's asking, is he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's the word."</p>

  <p>"And who is he?"</p>

  <p>"Cobalt."</p>

  <p>Soapy got him by the arm and jerked him into the room. Gabriel said that
  the face of his chief was twisted into knots. "You're lying to me. No man and
  no demon would dare to come back into my place after what he's done to me,
  not even Cobalt!"</p>

  <p>"Cobalt's not a fool, and yet Cobalt's down there," insisted Gabriel.</p>

  <p>"If Cobalt's down there, then he's a fool."</p>

  <p>"Not a fool," objected Gabriel, "because he knows that he's as safe there
  as he would be in his own house."</p>

  <p>Soapy only stared at him. Then, retreating to a table in the corner of his
  room, he lighted the lamp and held it above his head so that, in a brighter
  light, he could look at Booze.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not drunk," said Gabriel. "I'm cold sober. Thank goodness for it!
  I can tell you that the time's come, and you'll have to believe me."</p>

  <p>"The time has come for what? If the cur is down there, the time has come
  to rouse up some of the boys and send Jess along with them. It's Cobalt's
  last day." Soapy ended up this speech by roundly cursing Cobalt, but he found
  that Booze Gabriel was only smiling. "What's the matter with you? I think
  that you're half out of your wits today."</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not out of my wits, but you've got to go down there and face him
  man to man, single-handed, like one gentleman faces another."</p>

  <p>"Hold on! As one gentleman faces another? Is that what you said?" Then he
  began to laugh.</p>

  <p>At this moment Booze simply quoted a better man than himself&mdash;Cobalt.
  "Once a gentleman, always a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"What?" cried Soapy. "What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"You know right well what I mean. And I know, too, that nothin' that a man
  does can rub out his blood. There's right blood in you, Soapy, and you know
  it."</p>

  <p>Soapy Jones actually smoothed his long curling beard and stared at the
  floor, silenced.</p>

  <p>Booze went on: "I'll tell you, Soapy, that what you're thinkin' of right
  now is the Negroes singing in the cotton field, the hounds baying the 'possum
  of a night, and the look of the bayou with the swans slidin' across it, their
  white shadows beside them. That's what you're thinkin' of, and of pictures
  hung along a wall in a big white house with columns in front of it."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Soapy Jones through his teeth. "What if I am?"</p>

  <p>"Only I was recollecting you. Cobalt, down there, he knows mighty well
  what kind of a man you are under the skin. He's guessed what there is that
  makes me and Jess love you, Soapy. And that's why he's as safe as if he was
  in his own house, until you come down there and face him yourself."</p>

  <p>Soapy looked at his follower patiently, thoughtfully. Then he said: "I
  think you're right, Gabriel. The day's come. I'm going down to do as he asks.
  Only I feel that my luck has run out, and I'm as dry as a squeezed lemon.
  Here, man, you give me a hand with my clothes, will you?"</p>

  <p>Booze Gabriel stayed there and helped his chief to dress. He felt no shame
  in this menial employment. Instead he spoke with pleasure and with pride
  about the clean linen of his chief, the silken socks which he drew on, and
  the fine quality of the suit with its long-tailed coat. He spoke of how Soapy
  shrugged his heavy shoulders until the coat sat on him in exactly the way he
  chose to have it and how critically Soapy regarded himself from every angle
  in his mirror, and then got Booze Gabriel to give his boots another rub.</p>

  <p>"What boots they were!" said Gabriel, "as soft as velvet and as bright as
  moonlight in water." Then Soapy drew on gloves of a fabric so light and thin
  and soft that they did not in the least impede the freedom of the fingers. He
  pulled both of them on but on second thought, just as he was about to leave
  the room, he drew off the one from the right hand and carried it in his
  left.</p>

  <p>Next, he took from a doorway a short-bodied revolver of a make which Booze
  Gabriel did not know, although he knew that it was his master's favorite
  weapon. This gun he unloaded and loaded again, after he was sure that it was
  in perfect order. Finally, he fixed a spring holster under the pit of his
  left arm and placed the gun in this. Having done so, he made two or three
  turns through his room, drawing the gun like a flash and then returning it to
  its hiding place.</p>

  <p>He washed his hands. He gloved his left hand again and carried the other
  glove in the same hand. Then he took down from a bureau drawer a handkerchief
  of the finest linen, folded it precisely, and thrust it into his outer breast
  coat pocket. He allowed just a trim corner of it to appear above the lip of
  the pocket.</p>

  <p>"Look at me, Booze, and tell me how I seem." He stood up for
  inspection.</p>

  <p>"There ain't a breath of dust on you," said Gabriel, "and you look like
  the walkin' image of the old major himself."</p>

  <p>At this Soapy turned on him, cursed him, and called him a rotten fool.</p>

  <p>"But he did look like the major," Booze Gabriel told his listeners in the
  posse as they sat that day under the shade of the spruce tree. "He looked as
  like him as two peas out of the same pod, except that the major had a pile
  more stomach on him and not quite so muscular in the shoulders, if you foller
  me. But that was the way that Soapy was dressed when he left his room and
  marched down toward the saloon with me behind him."</p>

  <p>"What happened then?" asked one of the posse.</p>

  <p>Booze grew suddenly dark of brow. "You know what happened. And it ain't
  for me to tell you what happened. Get your rope ready."</p>

  <p>After his talk some of the men found their blood cooler, and they would
  have left the rope behind them and taken Booze into town for a regular trial
  and legal punishment. But the leader of the posse declared that he was sure
  Booze didn't much care what happened to him, and that it would cost the
  county a lot of useless extra expense.</p>

  <p>With both of these points Booze at once agreed and made no protest
  whatever. So they asked him for his last wishes, his last message, and his
  last prayer.</p>

  <p>"I got one message for Satan, and one prayer to him, and one wish. The
  message and the prayer and the wish is for one of the shady spots in Hades.
  Good bye, boys!"</p>

  <p>He stood up on the back of his stolen mare. They led it out from under
  him. He dropped heavily until his toes actually touched the dust. Mercifully,
  the shock snapped the spinal column, and poor Booze Gabriel died as quickly
  as though a bullet had passed through his brain. Thus the posse redeemed its
  promise, having heard the strange story of how Booze persuaded Soapy Jones to
  descend from his room and meet Cobalt on equal terms in a duel.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37"></a>XXXVII. &mdash; THEY MEET</h2>

  <p class="first">When I think of what happened in that room, I groan,
  remembering that I was not present. But, again, I assure you that I have
  heard the story so many times, from so many points of view, that sometimes I
  forget that I was not actually inside the doors. The whole scene is so
  vividly spread before my eyes.</p>

  <p>Red Loftus, Champ Evens, and Harry Gay were tending bar at this time, and
  they had to work like fury to keep the drinkers supplied with the red-eye.
  The clash of the glasses and the dull, bumping sound as a spun bottle went
  whirring down the bar and rocked into place mixed with the murmurs of the
  drinkers. The mirror behind the bar was spotted and blurred with the many
  faces that it reflected. It was a great business stroke, when that ingenious
  Soapy decided to place a mirror along the back of the bar. For it gave his
  place an air of elegance that almost amounted to decency.</p>

  <p>The suspense by this time had grown nerve-wracking. Joe Porter said
  afterward that every man in the place from time to time would mop his
  forehead or loosen his shirt collar a trifle. Joe's own big, hairy hands were
  sweating profusely, but he said that Cobalt's were cool enough apparently,
  and the face of Cobalt was perfectly calm also.</p>

  <p>The crowd understood this thing that was to come as perfectly as though it
  were a rehearsed performance. They left a long lane from one door leading
  directly toward the table at which Cobalt was sitting. That lane was
  astonishingly narrow as though everyone took it for granted that, when such
  men as Cobalt and the great Soapy Jones met, no bullets were likely to fly
  astray from the mark.</p>

  <p>Just then there came a strange interruption, a most unexpected thing.
  Trainor, who had been so thoroughly subdued before with his borrowed gun
  ready in his hand, now rushed to the front of the crowd and screamed
  hysterically at Cobalt: "You don't have to wait for Soapy Jones. I'll meet
  you now! I'll take you down!"</p>

  <p>Cobalt did not stir a hand to reach his gun. He merely said: "Some of you
  take the fool away."</p>

  <p>Imagine that in the saloon of Soapy Jones where the other fellow was a
  trusted crook. More amazing than the order was the fact that it was obeyed,
  not by mere members of the crowd but by a pair of Soapy's own bouncers. They
  actually mastered Trainor, jerked the gun out of his hand and, taking him to
  the door of the saloon, hurled him into the mud and told him they would break
  his neck if he ever came back again.</p>

  <p>This brought loud applause, hand clapping, feet stamping, and yells of
  laughter from the crowd. There was a hasty round of drinks, and the
  atmosphere seemed to lighten at once. The incident could not be explained by
  Joe Porter, but I think that I understand it. Everyone was so bent on seeing
  the meeting between Cobalt and Soapy that practically no attention was paid
  to Trainor. He was not even exciting he was a mere nuisance.</p>

  <p>The remarkable thing to me is that Cobalt was able, so accurately, to see
  into the minds of the crowd. That drink was hardly down, and the bustle
  subdued into its former murmuring, when even that murmur died out. Through
  the doorway came, not Soapy Jones but the lofty, emaciated form of Booze
  Gabriel. He was dead white, his eyes glittering like the eyes of a drug
  fiend. He halted near the table of Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"Mister Jones is about to join you, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>It sounds silly, but it was not silly, according to Joe Porter who said
  that he could feel an electrical prickling running up and down his scalp at
  this moment. Then Soapy himself stepped into the doorway and sauntered slowly
  toward Cobalt.</p>

  <p>Cobalt stood up. "Mister Jones, I believe."</p>

  <p>"The same, sir," replied Soapy. "Mister Cobalt, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Carney is my name, sir," said Cobalt. It was the first time anyone in the
  North had heard the true name of the strong man. "James Carney," repeated
  Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"Mister Carney," Soapy said and bowed a little.</p>

  <p>"I have come in here, Mister Jones," explained Cobalt, "to represent a
  friend of mine who has lost a little money in your gaming rooms."</p>

  <p>"Is that why you have come?" asked Soapy. "But you must realize that games
  of chance are games of chance."</p>

  <p>"Yes, even when there are brakes on the wheel. Of course, there's always a
  chance, but as a matter of fact the game of chance that beat him was simply
  coming into your saloon. He was thumped over the head and thrown into the
  street. They took a hundred ounces from him."</p>

  <p>"Are you a lawyer, Mister Carney?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then may I ask you what brings you to the support of Mister&mdash;your
  friend, yonder?"</p>

  <p>"A sense of decency and a liking for fair play."</p>

  <p>"And just what can you do for him?"</p>

  <p>"I can persuade you to return him sixty ounces. I took forty away from one
  of the thieves."</p>

  <p>"Persuasion," philosophized Soapy Jones, "is a gentle art."</p>

  <p>"It depends upon the kind that's needed. I'll tell you what, Mister Jones.
  It occurs to me that here I am, occupying a seat at one of your best tables
  and not spending much money. So perhaps you'll see your way clear to paying
  down sixty ounces to Mister Porter, my friend here. Then I'll promise you
  that I'll walk out and leave you to better company."</p>

  <p>"What could be better company?" asked Jones. "No, no, my dear sir, I
  wouldn't dream of buying you out. You're welcome to sit in that chair
  forever. A man so well known will draw trade for me. I would be glad to give
  you a bonus on the amount that you bring in for me above my average, if
  you'll appear there every day."</p>

  <p>I have always thought that this was a fairly clever way of turning the
  thing off. Joe Porter said that he began to yearn for something to happen,
  for this stiff verbal duel excited him almost to a madness of suspense.</p>

  <p>"I see that you're a true Southerner," observed Cobalt, "for you perfectly
  understand all forms of hospitality."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, but really all that people complain about is that I am apt to
  entertain them a little too much."</p>

  <p>"There is only one good way to entertain my friend, Porter, here."</p>

  <p>"And what is that?" The chief appeared as pleased as he could be.</p>

  <p>"By giving him sixty ounces."</p>

  <p>"I saw no theft," replied that smooth fellow. I suppose that he got his
  nickname from some such source.</p>

  <p>"Do you see this?" asked Cobalt. He lifted the hat off Porter and showed
  the rising bump.</p>

  <p>"If you feel that there's a cause for complaint, there is always the
  law."</p>

  <p>It appeared that Soapy Jones felt this last point with a peculiar force,
  for he actually bowed to Cobalt and then smiled at him. With his gloved left
  hand he parted his black beard and still smiled at him. Porter told me that
  this smiling of the arch-villain made a great impression on him. Suddenly he
  realized that even a scoundrel may be flattered and, if not flattered, he may
  be amused sufficiently to have his mind turned from his purpose.</p>

  <p>"A great many things are above the law," continued Soapy Jones. "The law
  is made for those who go along the road, not for those who cut across country
  where there's no need for traffic regulations. As for your friend, you ought
  to remember that even the fly has no right to complain to the spider, and yet
  the fly loses a good deal more than money."</p>

  <p>"We claim sixty ounces, duly paid over," said Cobalt. "If the money is not
  paid, we will appeal to the court."</p>

  <p>"To what court?" asked Soapy with an evil grin.</p>

  <p>"The court of arms," said Cobalt, as ceremonious as ever.</p>

  <p>Then, Porter said, Soapy gave one swift, malignant glance around him, as
  though he were regretting his fine first display. Now he would be neither
  civil nor courtly but simply put his heel on the stranger's neck. However,
  that moment did not last very long. He was still half infuriated and half
  amused by the attitude of Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"A good fight," he said, "will end almost any argument, so long as the
  fight lasts long enough and comes to a complete end."</p>

  <p>"I agree with you," said Cobalt. "That's the sort of a fight I
  suggest."</p>

  <p>"But, even if you win, you're not out of the web."</p>

  <p>"I take my chance."</p>

  <p>"I'll give you something better than a chance." Soapy raised his gloved
  hand to draw attention. "Friends, Mister Carney and I have a few little
  differences of opinion, mostly it appears, about a big bohunk who claims he
  was rolled in my place. Perhaps there are some other things into the bargain,
  but let that go. We are going to have the matter out between ourselves, as
  gentlemen ought to do. We won't crowd the law courts, and we won't fatten the
  lawyers. I think it's a good example that we're setting.</p>

  <p>"If I go down and I'm flattened&mdash;even if I'm on the floor wriggling
  but beaten, I put a curse on any man who steps in to help me. Let Mister
  Carney go safely out of this place. And you there behind the bar, if I'm
  beaten, before he goes, see that Porter gets his sixty ounces. No, make it a
  hundred and sixty&mdash;for luck!" He laughed as he said this.</p>

  <p>Porter said that his excitement was so intense that he simply forgot to
  think of what the wager meant to him. He could only stare and gape from one
  of these men to the other, wondering at the polite, circuitous way in which
  they expressed themselves and wondering still more at the fierce emotion
  which was in both of them. This miracle already had been accomplished. Cobalt
  had come into the spider's den, and the spider had consented to fight without
  using the advantages of his web. And here Jess Fair came for the first time
  into the picture.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch38"
     name="ch38"></a>XXXVIII. &mdash; TERMINUS AD QUEM</h2>

  <p class="first">When Fair came in, he walked right up to the shoulder of his
  master and was heard to say: "Leave it, Soapy. This is my job."</p>

  <p>"It's my job," replied Soapy. "Your job is only after the finish, to see
  that the pair of them get safely out of here after you've paid them what I've
  promised. There'll be no crawfishing today, Jess. This is my day. I feel it
  in my bones. Old Lady Luck is smiling at me. Don't worry about me, because
  you'll see me turning up on top."</p>

  <p>Jess Fair in reply murmured&mdash;so at least one of the nearest
  bystanders said: "Look at his heart, not at his face. Let his eyes alone, and
  shoot for the heart."</p>

  <p>The man who heard this looked across the room to where Cobalt was
  standing, and he said that he could understand the warning for the eyes of
  Cobalt were blue lightning.</p>

  <p>"What rules do you want?" asked the gambler, turning back to Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"We're in your own house," replied Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, we won't use the rules of the house," said Soapy Jones.
  "We'll try a new set, like a new pack. We stand, back to back, in the middle
  of the room. We step off ten paces which are counted by anyone&mdash;say by
  Jess Fair.</p>

  <p>At the tenth step, we turn and start shooting. If we can't finish with
  shooting, we take the knives. If the knives won't do, we end with our hands.
  Is that agreeable?"</p>

  <p>"That's agreeable," said Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"And if hands are not good enough, then anything we can get hands on will
  serve as a weapon."</p>

  <p>"Anything from poison to dynamite. Why, we agree so well it's a pity that
  we haven't worked as partners, Mister Jones."</p>

  <p>At this, Soapy's face grew as black as his beard. "You've been the one man
  to thwart me and beat me. You've smashed up my men. You've walked alive
  through Skagway as if Satan were giving a charm to you. I'm going to have
  your heart for it, Cobalt!"</p>

  <p>"All right," agreed Cobalt. "There's a heart in me to get, if you can win.
  It's free for you to have. You've been liar, murderer, thief, and sneak all
  your days. You're a greasy scoundrel, Jones, and we'll see the end of you.
  Commence when you're ready. Fair, will you give the signal?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Jess Fair.</p>

  <p>For an instant the two glared at one another. Then they came together,
  making the last few steps slowly, their eyes glaring straight at one another.
  For the gambler disdained to accept the advice of Jess Fair.</p>

  <p>They turned their backs on one another, and Jess Fair said in the most
  casual way: "All right, friends. One! Two! Three!"</p>

  <p>He counted out the paces, and they took them, Cobalt stepping short, and
  the gambler stepping long. A grim thing it was, Porter said, to see those two
  men, hardly matched in the whole world, walking so stiffly away from one
  another, while the only man who could have made a third to them stood by and
  quietly gave the measure of that dance.</p>

  <p>"Ten!" came from the lips of Jess Fair as quietly as any other number in
  the count, and the two turned.</p>

  <p>Porter said that he expected them to side-step&mdash;or that one of them
  would throw himself to the floor, but he was amazed to see that neither of
  them did such a thing. They whirled and stood as straight and tall as
  fencers, their guns whipping into their hands and their arms flying straight
  out. It was marvelous, the speed with which each turned, and still more
  marvelous that they seemed to do it in a single beat, like trained dancing
  partners. Their revolvers exploded to punctuate the measure. Neither man fell
  at the first shot, but the Colt dropped from Cobalt's hand. A sound like a
  weird, high-pitched moan came from the crowd.</p>

  <p>Cobalt leaned for his fallen weapon, but he was beaten, it seemed, by the
  bad start. Perhaps by one millionth of a second, the bullet of the gambler
  had been fired first and leaped across the room in time to strike the very
  gun that was in the hand of the enemy. For there was Cobalt, leaning, the red
  blood running from the shattered hand with which he reached after the weapon
  on the floor. The second bullet fired by Soapy slashed the shirt of the other
  across the shoulder, but the sudden stoop forward of Cobalt saved his life
  for another instant. He scooped up the fallen Colt and, without straightening
  his body, he flung the heavy gun straight at Soapy. The whirling revolver
  struck not the head or arm, but merely the powerful body of Jones. Yet, even
  so, a full-weight Colt .45 is not a toy when it is hurled from the hand of a
  fellow like Cobalt. It banged into the body of Soapy and staggered him just
  as he was firing his third shot.</p>

  <p>Thus there came about the miracle of that battle: of the first four shots
  fired only one reached a mark and that mark was only the hand of the enemy.
  The hurled revolver was followed by the tigerish leap of Cobalt. Porter swore
  to me that it was not a run across the room but a single, terrible bound that
  brought him upon Soapy Jones. The impact knocked them both from their feet,
  and thus entangled they rolled over and over and struck with a crash against
  the wall. The dust puffed up about them.</p>

  <p>Then it was seen that they lay, each on his side, facing one another. The
  revolvers had been dropped, but Soapy, with a great, bent-bladed Bowie knife,
  was striving to cut the throat of Cobalt, and Cobalt had caught the moving
  knife hand in his left, not in his right. The crimson, fast bleeding right
  was merely good to control the other hand of the gambler.</p>

  <p>The moan of the excited, frightened crowd rose to a higher key. Porter
  said that it was like the keen wind on an autumn day, the last day of the
  whirling leaves and the first of the black winter. But the knife was not
  traveling toward the goal at which Soapy had aimed it. Instead, it wavered
  for a moment in between, its point a scant inch from the throat of Cobalt.
  Then it was seen that the knife was turning. It wavered and shuddered, but
  turn it did, while those two mighty men struggled for its possession. The
  point crooked back toward the breast of Soapy Jones, and it was Cobalt's hand
  which turned it. He was the master now.</p>

  <p>Then, Porter told me, he could not look, so unnerved was he by the hideous
  slowness of the thing. He glanced away across the room and saw Jess Fair
  standing nonchalantly against the bar, his legs crossed, the buck-toothed
  smile flashing about as usual. Then, in a rush, the color left the face of
  Jess. Porter knew what it meant. At the same moment, he said, there came from
  the crowd of watchers a faint sigh in unison, as though drawn by a single
  throat, and the sound froze him to the very marrow of his soul. It lifted him
  out of his chair and, looking back toward the corner, he saw Cobalt rising to
  his feet, while big Soapy Jones remained motionless on the floor, looking at
  the ceiling, a high light gleaming on his forehead. Porter knew very well
  that the upturned eyes saw nothing, and that the tremor was in the light and
  not in the flesh. Soapy Jones had breathed his last.</p>

  <p>The next thing that Porter knew he was being led to the bar by Cobalt, as
  if for a drink, while every man in the room remained rooted to his place by
  the terror and horror of what had been seen. Only one man moved, a big, husky
  miner who slumped to the floor in a dead faint. It was not a drink that
  Porter got at the bar. Behind it stood Jess Fair, marble-white but with his
  buck-toothed smile still flashing. He laid a ten-pound gold belt before
  Porter, and the latter took it. He said that Jess Fair did not look at him at
  all but only at the face of Cobalt. His eyes wandered curiously from feature
  to feature, as if he were an artist and strove to remember that face, that he
  might sketch it later on, though Porter very well knew that it was not as an
  artist, with brush or pen, that the barkeeper stared at Cobalt.</p>

  <p>They turned toward the door together, Cobalt and Porter. As they did so,
  pandemonium broke loose in the saloon. The bouncers, the strong-arm men, all
  had quietly vanished, and the crowd which had been like sheep under the eye
  of Soapy Jones alive, now roared like lions when they knew that he was dead.
  They paid no attention to Cobalt and his red-dripping hand. They were only
  intent upon smashing and looting the saloon, and they did a good job of it.
  Chairs were used as clubs. Glasses were smashed. Men pulled open the cash
  drawers behind the bar and looted them. They rushed in swarms to do the same
  thing at the gaming tables.</p>

  <p>No one opposed them. The organization of Soapy Jones was just as strong as
  it had been before his death. There were just as many bloodthirsty and expert
  criminals, but the head had been struck from the body. At one blow Soapy's
  gang was dispensed.</p>

  <p>At the door, Porter said, he looked back and the swirl of the crowd, like
  the dashing of water in a cataract, parted before his glance for an instant
  and gave him a view of Jess Fair, on his knees beside the body of his dead
  master with one hand upon his face. It was a gesture of infinite gentleness
  and grief, and Porter never could speak of it without amazement and a shake
  of his head.</p>

  <p>When they got into the street, he did a foolish thing. He told Cobalt that
  he had received two for one, two ounces for every ounce of dust that had been
  stolen from him. He offered half of the loot to Cobalt and even remarked,
  like a tactless fool, that it might be some time before his right hand was in
  working shape again. Some time, indeed!</p>

  <p>Cobalt made no answer. I don't suppose that he ever had been in the least
  interested in Porter and Porter's loss or gain. It was merely the small
  entering wedge which he had used to topple over the huge structure of Soapy's
  organization.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch39"
     name="ch39"></a>XXXIX. &mdash; THE MONARCH BEATEN</h2>

  <p class="first">All this happened while I had been sleeping. What could I
  have done, had I been awake and on the spot? Well, nothing, perhaps, but it
  was a time when a man would wish to be on the ground where the action took
  place. What wakened me was Baird's shaking me by the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"The town is on the loose!" he said. "And hell's to pay! Listen! Look out
  the window!"</p>

  <p>I sat up in the bed. The noise from the street instantly cleared the fog
  of sleep from my brain and left me perfectly alert. I heard the dull roar of
  many voices. I looked through the window as I jumped up from the bed, and
  there I saw a tall red flame leaping into the sky.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" I asked. "Have the fools set the town on fire?"</p>

  <p>"It looks like Soapy's place," said Baird. "I can't quite make it out, but
  it looks about the location of Soapy's place. Let's find out what's
  happening. I'll get Sylvia."</p>

  <p>Sylvia did not need to be fetched. She was tapping on the door of our room
  as her father spoke, and he let her in. We went down together. There was no
  one in the lobby except a small, greasy-looking boy who was rummaging through
  the desk of the proprietor. He had half the drawers out and their contents
  scattered over the floor. When we spoke to him, he jumped up and looked at us
  like the guilty little rat that he was. Then he gathered courage. The boss
  was gone, and he would not come back.</p>

  <p>"Not even come back for the rent that's owing to him?" I asked the
  youngster.</p>

  <p>"Naw! He'll never come back. He's started overland. All that he wants is
  fast mushing and a good dog team. He'd rather have a good dog team than all
  of the rent in the world."</p>

  <p>"What in the world has happened?" Baird asked him. "What buildings are
  burning down there?"</p>

  <p>"Soapy's gone up in smoke," replied the boy and deliberately turned his
  back on us, starting to rummage once more through the ravished drawers of
  that desk.</p>

  <p>We went out into the street. There was a crowd running about, breaking
  into buildings, shouting and screeching with an insane pleasure. We managed
  to find one man who was an onlooker, like ourselves. He told us the story in
  brief. It was not until a long time afterward that I gathered the full
  details from Porter and many others. It was far more impressive, when one
  heard it from that stranger briefly, for he made the thing more of a miracle.
  With the details stripped away, it seemed Herculean, inhuman, the courage and
  the power that a single man had shown in advancing into the house of the
  gambler and killing him there in the presence of all his followers.</p>

  <p>"Did Jess Fair do nothing?" I remember asking.</p>

  <p>"Jess Fair? Sure. He buried his boss!" He laughed in a strange way.</p>

  <p>"Buried already?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. In fire."</p>

  <p>"Did Jess set fire to the gambling house?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yeah. That's what they say," replied the other. He was indifferent, but
  he chuckled every now and then, looking up and down the street at the
  smashing going on and the crowd dashing about.</p>

  <p>"Tell me something," I said to him.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"You're a newspaper reporter, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"The hell! How did you guess that?"</p>

  <p>Then we asked where the hero was to be found. Certainly, the best that
  Skagway could offer would not be too good for him now. But our reporter
  friend of the detached manner and the chuckle had not been able to find
  Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather listen to him for five minutes now than to have a five-column
  head!" he said.</p>

  <p>We went on, pursuing our inquiries, and the story grew and grew with every
  step that we made. We went down to the gaming house, and there we saw a
  number who, like ourselves, were gazing with wonder and a little awe upon the
  crimson and black, fast-dissolving remnants of the famous house of crime. I
  asked one of them who stood nearby if it was really true that Jess Fair had
  kindled the fire to cremate the body of his master. He said that it was true
  and that he had started the fire in order to drive out the crowd which was
  getting rough and looting the place. In other words, he preferred to let the
  flames take the gold of his crooked master.</p>

  <p>"What's made Jess Fair so devoted to Soapy Jones?" asked Baird of another
  man.</p>

  <p>"Well, Soapy got him young," said the other. "That's all. If you start
  early enough, you can make any pup into a one-man dog."</p>

  <p>That was the only explanation I ever heard of the singular attachment
  which the gunman showed for the master criminal. We were to learn more later
  on.</p>

  <p>We were standing there, watching the crumbling of the last of the ruin,
  out of which there came small explosions from time to time, and leaping
  columns of sparks, fire, and smoke. The heat was welcome and bathed us in a
  blood-red glow.</p>

  <p>"You see?" said Sylvia aside to me. "That's the reason. You see what he's
  done?"</p>

  <p>"You mean Cobalt?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. That's what I mean. You see how he's smashed that place?"</p>

  <p>"I see that he's removed a curse from Skagway," I told her. "I see that
  he's done what the whole mob of the so-called law abiding, including your
  father and myself, never had the courage to attempt. I see that he's given
  Skagway a chance to draw a breath and make of itself a decent place. That's
  what I see, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"Don't be so indignant," she replied. "I hoped you'd see what I mean."</p>

  <p>"I think you're only blind, Sylvia. You won't open your eyes to the truth
  about him."</p>

  <p>"I won't give myself into the hands of a hypnotist," she replied. "That's
  all. If I'd let myself go, I could be mad about him. But there's no check on
  him. There's no rein that would hold him in. He'd run away. He'd be apt in a
  crisis to smash things right and left. A man who wronged him would be apt to
  lead him into a murder. There's no holding him."</p>

  <p>"You could hold him," I told her.</p>

  <p>"I? Why, he saw through me at the first glance. He wasn't fooled by my
  little airs. Not a bit! He saw there was trouble in me. I was the first woman
  that looked strong enough to amuse him, strong enough to give him a little
  occupation in mastering her. That's the whole trouble. He'd have me mastered
  soon enough, and then he'd lose interest."</p>

  <p>I wondered if she were right. She had a keen way of looking into things, I
  must say, even from the first. She could be a doctor who prescribed for the
  physician. She had prescribed me as an antidote for the great Cobalt, simply
  because I was the reverse of him in every way.</p>

  <p>A pair of men came up and stood beside us and talked about the fire and
  the cause of it. They mentioned Cobalt, of course. Both of them had been in
  the gambling den when the fight took place. It was from one of them that I
  first heard of how the knife had been turned in Soapy's hand and used to take
  his life. It was a neat and horrible detail, and I looked askance to see how
  Sylvia was taking it. Her lips curled.</p>

  <p>"Like a dog fight?" I heard her faintly whisper.</p>

  <p>That enraged me suddenly.</p>

  <p>Then one of the two strangers said something about its being the end of
  Cobalt, too. You can imagine how that interested all of us.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Baird sharply. "What do you mean by its being
  the end of Cobalt?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said the other, "he had two hands, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, of course!" snapped Baird impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the stranger, "now that he has only one hand, wouldn't you
  say he's divided in two?"</p>

  <p>"Only one hand?" asked Sylvia in a quiet voice but one that set my teeth
  on edge. "Has he lost a hand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's practically ruined. Where the bullet tore the gun out of his
  hand. They say the cords are cut inside the palm. I saw it dripping red. It
  was bleeding pretty fast, and he went right out into the cold with it. I
  reckon he'll never use that hand again."</p>

  <p>Sylvia took her father and me, each by an arm, and drew us together.</p>

  <p>"We've got to find him!" she said. "He's gone somewhere. We've got to find
  out where he's gone. I'm going to find him if I have to crawl on my knees
  around the world!"</p>

  <p>We started making inquiries. It was a long, hard job. At the name of
  Cobalt everyone was willing to break out into exclamations and encomiums, but
  no one could give us any practical hints about where we could find him. That
  is, no one could for a long time. Then we came across the man who kept the
  rooming place where Cobalt had stayed, and he told us Cobalt had come
  straight home from the scene of the fight and had dressed his hand the
  proprietor holding two lanterns close to it in order to give him light for
  the work.</p>

  <p>"And the hand?" asked Sylvia in a breaking voice. "What had happened to
  it?"</p>

  <p>He looked down at her. "If you're a friend of his," he said, "well, I'll
  leave a doctor or himself to do the telling of it. It ain't a job I
  want."</p>

  <p>I felt sick. Cobalt was ruined. Was the destruction of Soapy Jones worth
  it? No, not the destruction or the salvation of all of Skagway!</p>

  <p>"Where is Cobalt now?" asked Baird in a husky voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's gone," said the man. "He hitched up his dogs quite a while ago,
  five big Huskies, and he hit for the inland trail. I asked him if he was
  going inside."</p>

  <p>"What did he say?" cried Sylvia.</p>

  <p>"He said he was going inside and would never come out," answered the
  man.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch40"
     name="ch40"></a>XL. &mdash; INLAND</h2>

  <p class="first">Baird expressed what I'm ashamed to say was in my own mind.
  "He's gone back to his own kind. That's the place for him. He doesn't belong
  out here! He'll be happier inside."</p>

  <p>I remember that the girl looked fixedly at me and said: "What do you
  think, Tommy?"</p>

  <p>What did I think? Well, it barely mattered, with her glance telling me I
  had better start thinking all over again, and at last I managed to say
  miserably: "I don't know. It doesn't seem right. They say his hand is
  gone."</p>

  <p>"This is the point," she said. "Why did he start inland again?"</p>

  <p>"Because he's hankering after his kind," said Baird. "That's it, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" Sylvia addressed me.</p>

  <p>The Lightning Warrior, who had been following her like a ghost, stepped
  forward, and she rested her head absently on his head. He glared at me with
  an undying hatred.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," I replied. "I suppose, perhaps, you had something to do
  with it, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"Then there's only one thing for us," she answered. "We've got to go after
  him. Do you agree?"</p>

  <p>"To go after him?" exclaimed Baird. "My dear, do you think we could ever
  catch up? Do you remember how he came up with us and passed like the wind
  when we were trying to beat him out with a huge head start and couldn't
  manage it? What could we do now <i>he</i> has the start?"</p>

  <p>"You're speaking of a time when he had two hands," said Sylvia coldly.
  "Besides, his heart was up then. It's down now, I imagine."</p>

  <p>"You're not serious, dear," said her father. "You don't mean we'll
  actually chuck everything and go after him?"</p>

  <p>"Chuck everything? Chuck what?" asked Sylvia. "What are you? What's Tommy?
  What am I, compared with Cobalt? We're going after him. I'm going after him,
  at least, if I have to go to the North Pole!"</p>

  <p>That settled the thing on the spur of the moment. There was no argument,
  no discussion. Baird simply looked at me, and I looked back at him. Each of
  us gave up. I had a keen picture of her trekking alone through the
  wilderness. I knew she would do it, too, and so did her father.</p>

  <p>From that point on, we simply spoke of getting ready as soon as possible.
  Then there was the question about the trail he might have taken. It was
  Sylvia, again, who suggested that he might have gone around the point and
  started in from Dyea. While Baird was getting the dogs ready, along with the
  sleds and packs, I hurried down to the waterfront and there, after a time, I
  found a pair of Indians who had seen Cobalt. They had helped him paddle
  around the point. He had gone to Dyea, to shift the pursuit, in case anyone
  decided to go after him.</p>

  <p>I asked one of the Indians in broken English if the white man helped with
  the paddling. He said that he had, but he bad used his left hand only as the
  oarlock, driving from the heel of his right hand. He never shifted the
  paddle.</p>

  <p>"This hand no good!" said the Indian, and he grasped his right hand with
  his left.</p>

  <p>I went back to Sylvia and her father with the news, and we went down to
  the waterfront. There we got two good-size boats and made the trip around the
  point, though the water was kicking up a good deal, and we got pretty wet
  before we ever managed to make the other landing.</p>

  <p>We camped in Dyea. Plenty of people there knew about the smashing of Soapy
  Jones and his gang, and we were bombarded with questions, but no one seemed
  to have seen Cobalt go through. I wondered if he had dodged like a fox,
  merely landing in order to take fresh boating and double back to the point
  from which he had started? I would not have put it past him, and I wondered
  at his state of mind. Who could have wished to pursue him? He would not have
  dodged the vengeance of the Soapy Jones gang, not even with his right hand
  useless. Then what pursuit could he fear, except from Sylvia and us? And why
  should he fear that?</p>

  <p>The three of us never talked of Cobalt. We kept his name for the questions
  that must be asked of strangers, but I could guess that all of us felt and
  thought about the same way. In that time Sylvia never smiled, never laughed.
  She did not seem depressed, either; she was simply set like iron.</p>

  <p>After that one rest in Dyea, we started the march inland. The climb seemed
  worse than ever. We had to relay the packs to the top of course and, after
  that labor was completed, we skidded down the steep of the farther side.
  There we sorted and repacked the sleds, and we began to forge ahead.</p>

  <p>We had seven good dogs rather, we had seven not counting the white King.
  He stayed with Sylvia. Sometimes she went up to the lead and harnessed him as
  the first dog of the string, and then it seemed to me that we doubled our
  rate of travel. Sometimes she trailed behind with him, his great head always
  just under her hand and his pale, strange eyes fixed ahead like a thing that
  hungered to be farther north, as I suppose in all his blood he hungered.</p>

  <p>That was the worst march I had ever made. There was something depressing
  about turning back from the outside after we were safely there. My heart sank
  in my boots. There was something also about the quest which we were
  following. What would happen, what could happen, when we overtook Cobalt if
  we did?</p>

  <p>I think it was three days from the crest when we came upon the first
  outfit on the trail, a pair of partners who'd already quarreled and decided
  to split. Poor fellows, they walked about with the expression of sulky dogs
  and didn't speak to each other. They were dividing their supplies. They had
  only one rifle, one axe, and one tent cloth. One took the handle of the axe.
  They smashed the rifle and threw it away. They cut the tent cloth exactly in
  two, and each took a part. They had two sleds and five dogs. Each of them
  took a sled and two dogs. They offered to sell us the extra dog, but we
  didn't want it, so they butchered it instead of turning it loose. Each of
  them tried to prove that it was only the villainy of the other that was
  responsible for their break-up.</p>

  <p>We asked if they had seen an outfit that might have been Cobalt's. They
  were very polite. One of them, a big Swede with a mouth large enough to
  swallow a veal pie at a gulp, said he thought he'd seen an outfit go by, just
  as they were getting ready for their start the day before five dogs, one man,
  and two sleds. The man walked with an easy rise in his step. It might have
  been Cobalt.</p>

  <p>That cinched the matter for all three of us. That springing step we all
  remembered keenly enough, and from that moment we pushed ahead, assured we
  were traveling in the right direction. An odd group we made. Baird and I
  agonized throughout that march, but Sylvia scorned delays, and we pushed
  ahead with speed for her sake. Or was it so much for her sake as because her
  stronger spirit had mastered ours and forced us on?</p>

  <p>At the end of the next march, when we were making camp, a chill, misty,
  unseasonable rain began to fall. I was out at a little distance from the camp
  foraging for wood of a size that would make decent cutting. As I came to the
  edge of the heavy brush, with a clear swale of shining snow before me, I saw
  a four-dog outfit go by. It was pulling one sled, and the man with it was out
  ahead breaking trail.</p>

  <p>He was a smallish figure, hardly larger than a boy. He walked like a
  snowshoe expert, however, with short, rapid, tireless steps. And he made
  exceedingly good time. I did not step out to greet him, I hardly know why.
  Perhaps it was because I'd gathered my firewood and was about to turn back to
  the camp. At any rate there I stood, almost entirely screened by the brush.
  As I waited, the driver drew nearer and nearer, never altering his pace,
  never changing his quick, untiring step. I admired him. I was about to shout
  out a greeting and a congratulation to him, when he turned his face a little
  and I recognized him. It was the buck-toothed smile of Jess Fair.</p>

  <p>The moment I spotted him, you can be sure I choked back my greeting. I
  only wished for a thicker screen of shrubbery between me and the other
  fellow. There I stood, forgetting the freezing of my feet, while he tracked
  on and on and gradually the misty rain closed in and shut his retreating
  figure from view. A welcome riddance!</p>

  <p>But, on my way back to camp, my thoughts were not pleasant, I can assure
  you. I knew that Jess Fair had loved Soapy Jones. It seemed to me that I
  could follow the train of his thoughts. First, he had delayed long enough to
  see the cremation of his strange master. Then he had gone on the trail of his
  destroyer.</p>

  <p>Well, he was ahead of us, and what would happen if he came up with Cobalt
  first Cobalt with only one hand and that hand his left? It was not the mere
  matter of strength. If Cobalt ever got to grips with him, that terrible left
  hand alone would be enough to settle the business in a few seconds, but he
  would never get to grips with Jess Fair. The fight would be from a distance,
  where guns would settle it. What chance would Cobalt have, great as he was,
  great even with a single hand? No, he would have no chance at all.</p>

  <p>I trudged back to camp in low spirits, I can tell you, and Baird said to
  me: "Well, I thought you'd likely bring in some venison as well as the wood.
  You've been gone long enough to stalk a deer."</p>

  <p>I threw down the wood and said: "Baird, we'll have to break camp. I've
  seen something more than a deer, and it's on our trail, heading us."</p>

  <p>"What have you seen?" asked Sylvia, coming toward me slowly, staring.</p>

  <p>"I've seen Jess Fair with four dogs, traveling fast. And he's headed us
  already."</p>

  <p>Baird exclaimed and struck a hand against his forehead. "Fate itself is
  against us," he said.</p>

  <p>"There's no fate," said Sylvia, in a strange, rapid monotone. "It's too
  far north for fate to bother. We've got to break camp, Daddy. Hurry, hurry!
  We've got to make a double march this time!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch41"
     name="ch41"></a>XLI. &mdash; FATIGUE</h2>

  <p class="first">There are two kinds of weariness. There is that which the
  body feels and which the mind submits to willingly, the kind a man feels
  grateful for when he's in bed and knows he will not have to wait for sleep.
  The second kind is a different matter. It's the fatigue which the body feels
  and the brain denies. The body begins to call out from all its members. All
  of its muscles, nerves, limbs, its very bones begin to groan and ask for
  rest, and the brain has to scorn this appeal and declare it is nothing.</p>

  <p>It is not so hard, at first. The will wells up in you. The heart swells,
  as it were, and becomes greater. The body is a pitiful, contemptible,
  complaining crew that mans a great vessel, incapable of halting. After a
  while the matter is altered, greatly altered. You can force the legs ahead.
  You can think of old songs and sing them. Then, finally, the words of the
  tune change and begin to sing silently in the innermost ear: <i>You've done
  enough. You can't do more. You have to stop. You have to give up. All things
  must die, and death is no sweeter at the end of the longest trail.</i></p>

  <p>The mind resists. Once the vast labor is ended, it says, life will be
  sweet again, sweeter than ever. Someday there will again be a soft bed, and
  the body will stretch its weary bones in such a sleep as gold cannot buy for
  the kings of the earth. But the promises of the brain grow dimmer and dimmer.
  And the outcry of the tormented muscles begins to predominate. At last, the
  traveler knows that he cannot go any farther. Still he goes.</p>

  <p>He picks out the crest of the next hill and vows that there he will pause.
  From that hill he sees a bush in the valley and declares that this will be
  the outermost edge of his voyage. There he will sink down, let come what may.
  When he reaches the bush, however, there is still another object before him,
  and he fastens his mind on its nearness, scorns his conquered body, and
  marches on with a staggering step.</p>

  <p>All of this we went through on that forced march which was killing us, but
  we dared not pause. I speak of Baird and of myself, for we had a spur in our
  sides the girl. She never faltered. Once in fact I heard her moan, and I
  turned sharply toward her, about to say: "Sylvia, we have to camp! This is
  madness! We can't win. They have too long a lead over us!" But as I turned to
  her, she lifted her dauntless head and smiled at me in such a way that the
  weariness left my body, and for a moment I was strong and fresh again.</p>

  <p>What a spirit was in her, fresh and free and noble as the spirit of some
  matchless Thoroughbred, some queen of the desert, for which tribes fight
  because of herself as well as her flawless lineage. Who would think of mere
  goodness, gentleness, when looking at her? For she was more. She was
  something in which one could see only the great heart, the great soul, the
  matchless strength of will, all locked up as priceless jewels are in a casket
  of a still greater price.</p>

  <p>So she was to us on that grisly march which was to bring us to the end of
  it all. She was a light shining, pouring out not radiance but infinite
  beauty. She talked to us, when there was no breath left in her to sustain her
  own body. She laughed joyously, when all her soul was wrapped in pain. She
  walked with a light step, when her knees were leaden and her heart was
  bowed.</p>

  <p>All during that march, I said to myself: <i>She has fought against it. She
  has denied it. She has struggled to keep herself from him, but she is
  overcome by a greater love than any woman ever felt for a man. It is out of
  that love that she is able to pour forth for us these drafts of strong wine,
  buoying our courage.</i></p>

  <p>I had no jealousy of Cobalt. I felt toward him and toward the girl, as men
  in the street feel when they look at the shining, obscured windows of the
  palace and hear inside the music of the dancers, for I knew that both of
  these were spirits from a realm above mine. And so we slogged on, Baird and
  I, setting our teeth, shifting our glances from the trail only to let them
  rest on the girl.</p>

  <p>Once I thought she was about to fail actually to fall on the trail. She
  was walking behind the sled at that moment with both her hands on a line
  which the Lightning Warrior pulled against, and she leaned heavily back, and
  finally her head fell limply and dangled back on her shoulders, her face
  turned up to the sky.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia," I cried to her. "How is it with you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I was star-gazing. I forgot for a moment," she said. "I'm as fit as a
  fiddle. I'm going to break trail for a while."</p>

  <p>And she did it! I tried to stop her, but my poor spirit was too weak for
  her. She went on ahead, and she broke trail, stepping gallantly with the
  Lightning Warrior as gaunt and great and powerful as a polar bear. When I
  think back to it, I see it with the same whirling of the senses that I felt
  then, half overcome, half stupefied with deadening fatigue. There was an
  unearthly something about it. I used to look at the slender body of that girl
  and tell myself how little her strength was compared with mine. Then I could
  only say this was a miracle which I was seeing.</p>

  <p>It was about the latter quarter of that march when we found the first
  significant thing on the trail, a moccasin. The thing was picked up by Baird.
  It was small enough almost for Sylvia to have worn it. Had some poor child
  come across this trail then? Or was there another woman before us? It had not
  fallen in the snow very long before. It was not even thoroughly frozen and
  bent in the hand without cracking.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what it is?" said Baird to me.</p>

  <p>"No," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia seems to know, however," he said.</p>

  <p>She was acting very oddly. She called the Lightning Warrior to her and
  showed him the thing. Then she threw it down into the snow and stamped on it.
  The beast began to growl. When she picked it up, he tried to snatch it from
  her hand with his needle-sharp teeth, but she kept it and, holding it high,
  she spoke angrily, turned and twisted it, and seemed trying to tear it. Then
  she struck it with her hands until the Lightning Warrior went into a frenzy.
  He would leap up high, whining in his frantic eagerness. He bounded all about
  her and seemed ready to knock her down with a blow of his massive shoulder
  and so get the thing from her.</p>

  <p>Finally she gave him a half of it, which she tore from the rest, and that
  wolf slashed it to bits as though it were a living thing. She rewarded him
  for this show of foolish ferocity until I had to ask her: "Sylvia, what under
  heaven are you about?"</p>

  <p>"Who owns the moccasin, Tommy?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"How in the world should I know?"</p>

  <p>"There aren't many men with feet as small as that, are there?"</p>

  <p>"No, there aren't, of course, and it must be&mdash;say, a child."</p>

  <p>She showed me the remnant remaining to her. "See the way it's worn under
  the toes. No woman or child has so much strength in the toes, such a foot
  grip. That's a man's moccasin, Tommy, and haven't I heard that the great Jess
  Fair is a very small man?"</p>

  <p>The thing clapped together like two parts of the same apple and made a
  whole again. I could understand her well enough. We all were enemies of Jess,
  and it might be as well to have the Lightning Warrior as an extra foe to him.
  Baird saw and heard all this, but he was too sick from fatigue to make any
  comment.</p>

  <p>So we slogged on again in the remorseless march, the memory of which is
  etched with all the acid of pain in my mind so that the latter part of it I
  can recall almost step by step. It was two or three hours after the episode
  of the moccasin that we heard the first shot of the battle. The sound came
  clanging to our ears from a distance, and we all three looked at one another.
  Sylvia nodded.</p>

  <p>"We'd better go that way," she said. "You never can tell&mdash;"</p>

  <p>So we headed to the left and immediately heard another rifle shot to guide
  us more accurately. Baird got out the small field glasses, which he carried,
  and Sylvia herself unlimbered the rifle. I went ahead, being more fit than
  Baird, and started to break trail.</p>

  <p>There was a new fall of snow, light, dry, flying like dust under the broad
  web of the shoes, and this sort of snow always makes heavy pulling for a
  sled. In addition we had a gradual slope to surmount, and the dogs made hard
  work of it until the girl fastened the Lightning Warrior in the lead. Then we
  hummed along with me staggering in advance, and the fangs of the wolf inches
  from my tired legs.</p>

  <p>In mounting that slope, I poured out the last of my strength as utterly as
  one pours out the last drop from a cup of water. I knew somehow that over the
  brim of it we would come on something of importance, and I gave myself in a
  last frantic outburst. The blood came surging into my head. My eyes thrust
  out until they ached. But we made good time right up to the brow of the
  hill.</p>

  <p>There the team stopped, for I had pitched into the snow ahead of them and
  sat there, bowed far forward, supporting some of my weight on shaking arms,
  nauseated and done for. I heard Sylvia say: "This is the place!"</p>

  <p>I looked rather vaguely about me, for there was a quiet emphasis in her
  voice. A treasure hunter might have spoken with just these words and in just
  this manner, arriving at the destined spot. This was the place?</p>

  <p>The white ground sloped from the brow of one hill into a wide hollow which
  was empty of all growth in the center, but to right and left low trees and
  shrubbery went away like rolling smoke across the hills and hummocks. The sky
  was comparatively clear, but it seemed to me a narrow horizon, a sky without
  an arch, flat as a floor and low above our heads.</p>

  <p>What Sylvia was pointing toward was a pair of sleds in the center of the
  hollow with five dogs attached to it. Three of them were standing and two
  seemed to be stretched in the snow, resting. As I watched, another dog
  dropped down and, immediately after, I heard the sharp ring of the rifle
  report, like a hand clap at my ear.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch42"
     name="ch42"></a>XLII. &mdash; THE LAST BATTLE</h2>

  <p class="first">Baird spoke first. "It's Cobalt!"</p>

  <p>He had the glasses fixed against his eyes. When I heard him say this, I
  reached over, and he handed me the glasses. The picture drew closer. It
  <i>was</i>Cobalt. He had dragged from the pack on his sled a rifle which he
  held to his shoulder with his left hand alone, and at this moment he was
  firing into some brush to the right of the sled.</p>

  <p>There was no answering shot at Cobalt, but another of Cobalt's dogs went
  down. Then I understood. It was Jess Fair of course who had overtaken his
  man, and now from the secure shelter of the bushes he was playing with his
  victim. He would let Cobalt have a foretaste of death before death itself
  arrived. The dogs would go down first, and then the master would follow them
  at the leisure of Jess Fair.</p>

  <p>I dropped the glasses and tried to struggle to my feet, but my knees were
  unstrung. I could only kick feebly with my legs. "Give me a hand up!" I
  called. "He's murdering Cobalt!"</p>

  <p>There was no answer. I turned my head and saw that Baird had taken the
  rifle and was aiming at something he saw in the brush the hidden assassin.
  The girl in the meantime was running off to the left, along the brow of the
  hill. She ran with all the strength she could muster. The Lightning Warrior
  was beside her.</p>

  <p>I heard the heavy, hollow click of the hammer of the rifle falling, but no
  report followed that sound. I heard a moan from Baird. Another report rang in
  the hollow, and the fifth and last of Cobalt's dogs went down. Cobalt himself
  would be the next to follow.</p>

  <p>Baird was sobbing like a desperate child as he fought and struggled with
  the jammed cartridge. Then he took the weapon like a club, by the barrel, and
  ran down the slope with staggering steps. Somehow, I got strength enough to
  heave myself to one knee then to the next. I caught hold of the shoulders of
  the nearest dog. The Husky showed me his murderous teeth but endured enough
  of my weight so that I found myself presently standing erect but wavering. I
  began to move cautiously forward, down the slope. I was like a man drunk,
  with a mist before his eyes. Through that mist cut a streak of white.</p>

  <p>It was the wolf, running with nose down, hot on a scent that wavered a
  little from a straight line, and heading toward the shrubbery from which the
  hidden marksman was firing. Baird, overstepping on his exhausted legs,
  tumbled headlong into the snow before me. I overtook him and got the rifle
  away from him, and then I went on, stumbling, floundering, gasping for breath
  but always struggling with the infernal jam. I could do nothing with it,
  however.</p>

  <p>I saw a smaller form come up beside me. It was Sylvia, running
  desperately, and she went by me as though I were standing still. The last of
  Cobalt's dogs was down. His turn would be next. Perhaps he might have
  sheltered himself behind the sled and fired his rifle, left handed, across
  the top of the pack, but I think Cobalt was tired of life. For now he stood
  up from the snow in which he had sunk upon one knee, shooting from the left
  shoulder, the bandaged right hand supporting the weapon. He cast the useless
  gun from him and charged at the patch of shrubbery which held the
  murderer.</p>

  <p>That, I think, is the way I shall always think of him when I ride the
  range alone of Cobalt's running with all his might, leaning forward, throwing
  out his hands before him. Only one of them was useful, but that one would be
  enough, if ever he could come to grips. But how could he come to grips with
  that remorseless gunman?</p>

  <p>The rifle rang again, and Cobalt pitched on his face. Dead? No, he turned
  over in the snow, regained his feet, and went forward, hobbling. There was no
  use in his charging now, but he would not give up. He preferred to take his
  death while in action, his face to the foe. It was a noble thing to see.</p>

  <p>I saw Sylvia before me throw up her hands at the moment when Cobalt
  dropped. An instant later as he rose, the savage voice of the Lightning
  Warrior, baying on the trail, came back to my ears. There followed another
  rifle shot. I looked to see Cobalt fall again and lie still forever, since he
  was near the edge of the shrubbery, but Cobalt did not fall.</p>

  <p>Another gunshot followed and then silence. That silence held during the
  mortal seconds which elapsed before we got into the shrubbery together, Baird
  and I. For his greater strength at the moment had permitted him to overtake
  me. We went crashing through, regardless of what happened to our snowshoes,
  and so we came on the picture of the end. Jess Fair lay on his back with the
  Lightning Warrior on top of him. Both were dead, and each had slain the
  other.</p>

  <p>We turned our backs on them for there was something else to see. It was
  Cobalt, who sat in the snow with his back against a bush, his head hanging on
  his breast, his hands dangling into the snow, while Sylvia kneeled before
  him, cutting away the furs, trying to get at a wound between knee and
  hip.</p>

  <p>When we came up and spoke, Cobalt lifted his head. He gave us a blank
  look. His face was ghastly, and there seemed no recognition in his eyes. Then
  down rolled his head again, and the chin rested on his breast.</p>

  <p>Sylvia began to give us orders in a quiet, metallic voice. She never spoke
  to Cobalt or asked him how he felt. She didn't comfort or question him in any
  way. She never expressed a regret for her past treatment of him or confessed
  her true feeling, but she went on with the work steadily and got a shelter
  prepared, a bed of boughs constructed, and a good fire roaring.</p>

  <p>It was a slow business. We wanted to second her in every way we could, but
  exhaustion had almost the best of us. I took three axe strokes to a branch
  which ordinarily I would easily have slashed in two with one. But the camping
  drew to an end. We had the wood in, the fire going, and the shelter tent up,
  and Baird was proceeding with the cookery, while I trimmed up odds and ends
  and drove in pegs to make the tent more secure in case a heavy wind should
  blow up.</p>

  <p>We heaped one mound of snow to make a temporary grave over Jess Fair and
  the dead wolf. That might seem strange, since they had slain one another, but
  there was a similarity in their faces for each had died for the love of a
  master.</p>

  <p>At this point the girl announced that the wound in Cobalt's leg was
  dressed and that it would do very well, since it was only a clean, clipping
  hole through the thigh. Now she asked for hot water and more light, because
  she was going to dress the wounded hand. I was standing by, having brought
  the water, when I saw her begin to untie the bandage which Cobalt himself had
  clumsily wound around the hand. He seemed to start back, and suddenly he
  caught her arm with his left hand.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I won't have it touched," he said by way of answer. "It's doing very
  well. The air will be bad for it."</p>

  <p>"Will you let go your hold on me, Cobalt?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I will not, till you let me be."</p>

  <p>"You're breaking my arm," said Sylvia.</p>

  <p>He continued to stare at her for a moment, then he relaxed his grip and
  surrendered. As he lay there, he closed his eyes and said a thing I shall
  never forget.</p>

  <p>"I've been cut down to your size, Sylvia," he said.</p>

  <p>Ah, the bitterness in that quiet voice of his. He kept his eyes closed
  while she unwound the crooked, heavy, clumsy bandage which he had made. When
  it was off, she hesitated for a moment, holding the wounded hand back up, and
  I knew that she was gathering courage to turn it palm upward. She did at
  last, and she did it without flinching, though the red, horrible, puckering
  thing that I saw made my brain spin and my stomach turn.</p>

  <p>I managed to stand by while she washed and prepared the hand. Then she
  made five small pairs of splints, a pair for each finger, stretched the hand
  on them. It must have been a painful thing for Cobalt, but what was pain to
  him? He remained there on the bed of boughs, looking up into space with a
  faintly puckered brow, as though he were not aware we were doing anything at
  all to him.</p>

  <p>Afterward she went away, giving me a look that made me stay beside him,
  though I was groggy for the lack of sleep. We heard poor Baird begin to
  snore. Then there came a small, thin, wailing sound.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" asked Cobalt sharply.</p>

  <p>"It's the wind coming up."</p>

  <p>I lied as cheerfully as I could, but I knew well enough what it was. It
  was the whining, high-pitched sobbing of the girl. Poor Sylvia! Poor Cobalt!
  The sound ended. It began again and was stifled.</p>

  <p>"Call her, will you?" said Cobalt.</p>

  <p>I went and called Sylvia. She said she would not come, but I urged her,
  and at last she came.</p>

  <p>"Are you here?" asked Cobalt.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said.</p>

  <p>"Now, listen to me," said Cobalt. "I hoped this would be the last day for
  me. Fair would have finished me off quietly enough, and there would have been
  an end. But you had to come in between and smash things. Very well! But let
  me tell you, though there's only a third of me left, I won't have your pity.
  I won't have your whining."</p>

  <p>I looked at Sylvia and wondered what she would say to this cruel speech,
  but she said nothing. She only stood there with a white face and big eyes and
  the look of a beaten child. I cannot say that I regarded her altogether with
  sympathy, since I could look back rather clearly through the events of this
  history which I have been writing, and all the sins were hers, I felt. There
  never would have been any trouble except for her. Yet my heart ached for
  her.</p>

  <p>She saw that his eyes were closed, after he had spoken, and she took
  advantage of being unseen by him to hold out her hands to him. I hardly knew
  what to do, but I tried the simplest thing. I got her by a hand and drew her
  down close beside Cobalt. I took Cobalt's sound hand also and put Sylvia's
  small one beside it.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tell you the truth, Cobalt," I said. "She's about half
  wildcat but, if you don't hold onto the hand that you've got hold of now,
  you're missing what no other man ever can have."</p>

  <p>"Say what you mean, Tom," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Why, Cobalt, you blind fool! If you'd had your eyes open there in Circle
  City, you wouldn't have fought with her. You wouldn't have tried to crush
  her. You would not have talked rot about thieves and emeralds. You would
  simply have told her you loved her, and she would have answered that she
  loved you. For she's honest, Cobalt. But she has her pride. Would you want
  her without pride as big as your own?"</p>

  <p>"Chalmers," said Cobalt gravely, "I love you and I trust you, and no one
  else. You wouldn't lie to me. Not now, I think. But say this again."</p>

  <p>I got a look from Sylvia, however, that was enough for me. I did not
  repeat myself, but I got out of the shelter as fast as I could and stood
  outside. The sky was dark, without a star. The vague outlines of the trees
  were all around me; and out of the distance came a moaning, weeping voice. It
  was not Sylvia this time but, in fact, the wind.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch43"
     name="ch43"></a>XLIII. &mdash; REMINISCENT</h2>

  <p class="first">How we trekked back to Dyea is no matter, or how we took
  shipping south, or how we parted. I would like to begin again with Talking
  Mountain, the land I bought, and the look of the children when I saw them
  again. How we built the shack and how we put a wing on it the next spring. I
  would like to talk about the cattle, too, and the way they fattened on the
  highlands, just as I had known they would. For I've a theory that never has
  played me false, that the higher the land, the better the grass. It grew
  sparsely in bunches on my range land, but it seemed sweet to a cow. They fed
  on it greedily, and they were never tired of rooting the snow away to get at
  the cured, dead-looking grass in the winter. It may be a false theory of
  mine. It may only be true of Talking Mountain, but I know that the cattle
  throve wonderfully well on those clean uplands.</p>

  <p>I would like to talk about my life with the children too and the school
  work of an evening. How they rode range with me, growing sturdily but never
  hard minded. For there again is the beauty of the highlands, that the pure
  air touches the spirit in some mysterious way I never have understood.</p>

  <p>However, I know that in such a history as this, one must cling to the main
  events of the narrative. One event is surely part of the main course. I had
  gone to town to buy bacon and flour and other necessaries in the pinch of the
  early autumn, when a man looks to his winter larder. As I jogged my span of
  buckskins down the street, I saw a fight whirl out of the door of a saloon,
  and three men came tumbling in the dust, two fighting one. One of them was
  too much for the other two. He left them writhing in the street and stood up,
  a pale-faced youngster with a great hulking jaw and heavy, square shoulders
  and long arms.</p>

  <p>I stopped the team. "Hello, Kid," I said. "You'd better jump in here with
  me before they slam you in jail."</p>

  <p>He gave me one look, and then he came with a leap and sat in the seat with
  me. I drove on without pausing for provisions this trip, for I understood
  that trouble might be coming in the rear of the Kid. He had not changed much
  since Skagway.</p>

  <p>After we got clear of town, he turned and gave it a look. "Where are we
  going?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Up high where the air's better," I told him.</p>

  <p>He looked at me, but he said nothing. On the whole journey he asked only
  one question, I think.</p>

  <p>"Him, he got married. Cobalt, I mean. He got married, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he got married."</p>

  <p>"And where is he now?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," I answered. "You know how it is. Out on a ranch, your
  fingers get too stiff to handle a pen."</p>

  <p>I thought the Kid might stay a week. I was wrong. He told me he had been
  looking for me and Talking Mountain all his life, only he hadn't known our
  names. So he refused to budge and settled down and became a man I can trust
  my life to, this day or any other day hereafter. The good, sharp mountain
  winds blew him clean, as they have a way of doing.</p>

  <p>There is one more thing to add, the most important of all, I suppose. On a
  bright spring day, a May day, with all that May brings to the mountains, my
  girl spied two riders coming up the valley trail. She called to me. We have
  few strangers on Talking Mountain, and some of those who come our way need
  watching. So I put the rifle just inside the kitchen door and stepped outside
  into the bright sunshine.</p>

  <p>I watched them for a moment. The wind was running in brilliant waves along
  the flowers of the mountainside, and then I saw they were a man and a
  woman.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, my dear," I said. "It's a man and woman. Go put on the
  coffee pot and slice some bacon and clean a couple of the trout your brother
  brought in."</p>

  <p>She went to do as she was told, while I stood there, shading my eyes until
  they rode straight up to me, and still I did not know them. It was so
  unexpected, and our foolish eyes will only see what they are taught to
  expect.</p>

  <p>In fact, they had both dismounted, and he had cried out: "Tom, by thunder,
  you've forgotten!"</p>

  <p>Then I saw the black, thick glove on his right hand.</p>

  <p>"Cobalt!" I said.</p>

  <p>He took me with his left arm alone. It was enough. He sprained every rib
  in my body with a bear's hug. While I was still staggering and gasping,
  Sylvia kissed me and cried out about seeing me again.</p>

  <p>Before they would talk, they wanted to see everything. I showed them the
  haystacks, the new barn, the chickens, the corrals, and the pasture with the
  saddle stock in it enough to warm a man's heart to see the beauties. The Kid
  was in there, gentling a four-year-old, but he drifted away from us.</p>

  <p>"He's a little shy with strangers," I explained. "We won't bother
  him."</p>

  <p>I showed them the spring, and the new stone steps we had made from it to
  the house, and I showed them where I was going to build the windmill that
  would pump water to the corrals and to the house also.</p>

  <p>Then we went into the house, and they saw the children, as brown as
  squirrels and as shy. Only once they saw Sylvia, they would not leave. They
  were always standing in the corner, in the shadow, worshipping her
  beauty.</p>

  <p>So we had a meal together, but my guests did most of the eating, for my
  heart was a little too full for that. "And everything goes on pretty well?" I
  asked at last.</p>

  <p>I looked at the gloved hand, and Cobalt stretched it out.</p>

  <p>"Everything's going beautifully!" he said. "Look at this." He wriggled his
  fingers a very little, stiffly. "It will be as good as ever, one of these
  days."</p>

  <p>"I always knew it would." I managed to steal a glance at Sylvia. She tried
  to turn her eyes down in time, but I saw the tears in them.</p>

  <p>Well, everything was very well with them in one sense. Cobalt was in
  business and prospering. He was smashing stocks instead of men. He insisted
  one day they were coming West to join me. He would buy all the rest of the
  range. We'd live together always. I listened and pretended to believe.</p>

  <p>They could not stay long. I rode back with them part way to show the
  shortcut into the valley. There we said good bye, and Sylvia kissed me again.
  I held her in my arms for a moment and whispered: "Is everything well, my
  dear?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Tommy," she said, "I try and try, and maybe one day he will be what
  he was when he first met me."</p>

  <p>"Trust yourself," I said, "you can make wild things love you. And
  everything will end well. Heaven bless you both!"</p>

  <p>They went on. I watched them riding over the rimrock, the rim of my world,
  brilliant with light, and then they passed into the shadows of the quieter
  valley and were dimmed a little, as memory is dimmed by time.</p>
