<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">ONE Monday morning Chief-Inspector Gilbert
Larose, of Scotland Yard, was the recipient of what, he
considered, quite an interesting letter. It was marked private
and read:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>, I am desirous of consulting you about a matter which, from
its delicate nature, I am unwilling to lay, officially, before
the authorities. I have heard, however, that you, although
attached to Scotland Yard, are never unduly bound by red tape,
and I would, therefore, like to have your advice and, perhaps,
enlist your services. I will be at Fantelli's Restaurant in Old
Bond street at 2.30 tomorrow afternoon in the expectation that
you can meet me there. I choose that hour because it is one when
the restaurant is generally almost empty. You will find me seated
in the far corner on the right, and you will recognise me at
once, as I am a clergyman. Kindly make yourself known to me only
if I am alone."</p>

<br>

<p>The letter was signed "Church of England."</p>

<p>"Darned sauce," exclaimed Larose, asking a favor, almost as if
he were conferring one! But he's an important individual, this
clergyman, and nothing at all in the poor curate line of
business! Thick expensive note paper, and Fantelli's as a meeting
place, where a sandwich costs about half a crown! Why, goodness
gracious, he must be a bishop at the very least!" He nodded. "But
I'll go and meet him, for his lordship is, of course, being
blackmailed! That's only what the letter can mean." He grinned.
"Fie, fie, a clergyman having done anything that should expose
him to blackmail!"</p>

<p>So that same afternoon, having a couple of spare hours on his
hands, a few minutes before the time appointed, he made his way
to the highly fashionable Fantelli's, and, ensconcing himself at
a table well away from the one to be selected by his
correspondent, ordered a cup of coffee and proceeded to await the
coming of some clergyman.</p>

<p>Then, he had only just been served with his order when he saw
a man in severe and immaculate clerical attire being ushered into
the restaurant.</p>

<p>The new arrival was tall and imposing and of decidedly an
aristocratic appearance. He looked about fifty years of age and
carried himself importantly as if he were walking down the aisle
of some historic church, with the gaze of all assembled there,
riveted upon him.</p>

<p>His face was proud and handsome, with a clear-cut, classic
profile and eyes like those of an eagle. His eyebrows were big
and bushy, and he had the large mouth and mobile lips of the
orator.</p>

<p>Gaining a table at the far end, the clergyman seated himself
slowly and gave a curt order to a waiter. Then he cast a quick
look round, in a half-furtive sort of way, as if apprehensive
that among the few late lunchers there might be someone whom he
knew.</p>

<p>"Well," grinned Larose to himself, "if he's not a bishop, he
ought to be, for he quite looks the part." He frowned suddenly.
"But where have I seen that pontifical face before? It's not
quite unfamiliar to me!" He "snapped his fingers together. "Ah, I
know! I remember him! Of course, of course!"</p>

<p>He waited until the clergyman had been served with his order
and then, with an inward smile at the surprise he was going to
give, picked up his cup of coffee and, moving over to the
reverend gentleman's table, pulled out a chair and seated himself
opposite.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon!" he began, "I'm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the clergyman was frowning angrily. "Excuse me," he
interrupted sharply, "but this table is mine and I should prefer
it to remain so."</p>

<p>Larose smiled pleasantly. "But if I'm not very much mistaken,"
he said, "you have, expressly, come here to meet me. I had a
letter from you this morning. My name's Larose."</p>

<p>The clergyman looked startled and opened his eyes very wide.
"But I thought, I thought&mdash;&mdash;" he hesitated&mdash;"I
expected a much older man." He bent his head forward. "You are
really Chief-Inspector Gilbert Larose?"</p>

<p>"None other," laughed Larose, "and you are 'Church of
England.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," nodded the clergyman frowningly, "I deemed it
wisest to give no name." He hesitated again. "Now, 'er, 'er' but
it is rather embarrassing to me to give my confidences to so
young a man. I quite thought that as a chief-inspector you would
be much nearer my own age."</p>

<p>"I'm twenty-nine," said Larose, "and old enough to regard all
confidences as of interest only in a purely professional way." He
spoke very quietly. "Now how can I help you?"</p>

<p>"My name is Ambrose Brown," began the clergyman, "and
I'm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," interrupted Larose sharply, "that's not who you are.
Although not dressed in your full archidiaconal clothes, you are
Archdeacon Revington-Montgomery, Rector of St. James's, Hanover
square, one of the most fashionable churches in the
metropolis."</p>

<p>The clergyman at once got very red. He looked rather
shamefaced and swallowed hard. But he instantly recovered himself
and frowned with dignity. "Well, that small evasion is quite
pardonable," he commented carelessly, "and when you have heard
what I have to say you will, without doubt, agree with me."</p>

<p>"Not at all," exclaimed Larose, now speaking very sternly,
"for if I am to help you, as you wish, there must be complete
frankness on your part and no holding back anything."</p>

<p>The archdeacon raised his eyebrows. "Well, at all events," he
remarked with a grim smile, "I am glad to learn that Scotland
Yard is sufficiently in touch with church matters to be aware of
the identity of one of its very numerous London incumbents."</p>

<p>"But it's not exactly that," retorted Larose drily. "I happen
to have seen your photograph in the '<i>Tatler</i>' last week,
when you were present at the opening meeting of the Hambleden
Vale Harriers. You were there with your daughter, Miss Ethel
Revington-Montgomery, whom, I read, is shortly to be married to
young Lord Hawkesbury."</p>

<p>"Well," frowned the archdeacon, in no wise abashed, "it is
expedient for the Church to, at some time, take its part in
social functions. You must remember our flocks include all
classes."</p>

<p>Larose smiled. "Well, how can I help you?" he asked again.</p>

<p>Just for a few seconds the archdeacon hesitated and then he
took a letter from his pocket and, with a very reluctant
expression, handed it across to Larose. "This came on Saturday,"
he said curtly. "Please read it and tell me what I must do."</p>

<p>The letter was typed upon a sheet of plain paper, but from the
unusual shape of the sheet a part of it had undoubtedly been cut
off. It was dated the previous Friday and, with no address or
signature, read:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="typewriter">To Archdeacon Revington-Montgomery.</p>

<p class="typewriter">If you are not prepared to
pay over to the writer of this letter the sum of one thousand
pounds, within seven days of above date, the details of certain
adventures of yours when at Oxford, will be forwarded to various
people. The photographs of certain letters you wrote then will
accompany the communication. Among other recipients will be your
wife and some of her near relations, the Dowager Lady Hawkesbury,
the Prime Minister, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of
London and the editor of the "Church Times." Advertise at
once that you are prepared to negotiate, under the name of
Balliol, in the personal column of the "Morning Post," and
realise that the matter is urgent.</p>

<br>

<p>Larose read the letter very carefully, twice, and then turning
his eyes away from the archdeacon, asked carelessly. "And tell
me, please, what are these adventures this would-be blackmailer
refers to and what do these letters he threatens to broadcast
contain?"</p>

<p>The archdeacon at once shook his head most emphatically. "I
haven't the remotest idea," he replied, "I have no more idea than
you, and I simply do not know to whom or to what he refers."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Larose sternly, "I've told you already once
that you must give me your complete confidence or I shall not be
able to help you at all. Now what adventures does the man refer
to?"</p>

<p>The archdeacon smiled contemptuously. "Good heavens, sir!" he
exclaimed. "How on earth can I remember every incident which
happened between thirty-one and thirty-three years ago?" He
looked rather uncomfortable. "I have no doubt that when at Oxford
I may have committed certain small, youthful indiscretions, but,
most certainly, the recollection of no particular one stands
out."</p>

<p>"Then you admit there are episodes in your life," said Larose
sharply, "that you do not want now to be brought up?"</p>

<p>"Episodes of small moment," retorted the archdeacon warmly,
"when known to have taken place in my years of
adolescence"&mdash;his voice hardened bitterly&mdash;"but
episodes which, if magnified, deliberately and with malice and
tacked on to my adult years, may certainly assume a significance
out of all proportion to their importance."</p>

<p>He went on warily. "Remember&mdash;I went up to Oxford thirty-one years ago and with no intention, then, of taking holy orders.
I was of well-to-do parents, and, only nineteen, took part in all
the amusements and activities of young fellows of my own age. I
captained the eleven one year at Lord's, I rowed against
Cambridge, I followed the hounds and a normal, healthy young man,
I enjoyed life to the full." He smiled whimsically. "I may have
been no saint, but I was certainly no great sinner."</p>

<p>"Then there may be letters in existence," said Larose, "love-letters that you would not care to have read now?"</p>

<p>The archdeacon sighed. "It looks like it, doesn't it?" he
said. His face broke into a sad smile. "Does not the old aphorism
run 'to be in love and wise at the same time is not given even to
Jupiter'?" He nodded. "Yes, no doubt I have written foolishly in
my time, but I can think of no letters I wrote to anyone that are
likely to have been kept for thirty years." He sighed more
heavily. "But you must understand, this wretch is threatening me
at a most awkward time, for any scandal involving me now may have
most disastrous consequences in several directions."</p>

<p>"In what unusually particular ways?" asked Larose. "Please be
more explicit."</p>

<p>"To begin with," said the archdeacon gloomily, "three weeks
today my daughter is to be married to young Lord Hawkesbury, and
his mother is very straight-laced and, to put it
plainly"&mdash;he hesitated a long moment&mdash;"she is not
altogether a pleasant woman. She does not view with warm approval
the alliance of her son with my daughter and, indeed, would like
to see the match fall through. Her objection is a most unworthy
one. Lord Hawkesbury certainly comes of most distinguished
lineage, he is the twelfth baron, but my daughter is a very
beautiful girl and"&mdash;he drew himself up proudly&mdash;"the
Revington-Montgomerys have been county people of most high social
standing for many generations. My wife, too, is the daughter of
the late Bishop Ripon."</p>

<p>He looked scornful. "But the truth is, the Dowager Lady
Hawkesbury had set her heart upon a certain wealthy heiress of
plebian origin for her son, and it needed considerable courage on
the boy's part to select my daughter instead." He pursed up his
lips. "His lordship is only just one and twenty, two years
younger than my daughter, and his mother has great influence over
him."</p>

<p>"And what other unhappy consequences might there be?" asked
Larose thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The archdeacon frowned. "The Bishop of Durham is most
dangerously ill, and it is known he cannot possibly recover.
Then, upon his deeply-to-be regretted passing&mdash;I have it
upon most unimpeachable authority&mdash;the See is going to be
offered to me." He looked very troubled. "But the slightest
breath of scandal, the slightest hint of anything that would
suggest I am unfit for such high office&mdash;and then, of
course, I shall be passed over."</p>

<p>"Then those are the two particular misfortunes that threaten
you!" said Larose.</p>

<p>The archdeacon hesitated a moment, and then got very red.
"No," he said sharply, "there is a possibility of another
trouble, but this time it is a purely domestic one. Last week an
old college friend of mine, now Sir James Vereker, and a very
eminent surgeon, was dining with us, and he was foolish enough to
make some very tactless remarks about our 'varsity days together,
and my wife, one of the best of women, has been very upset ever
since. Indeed, she has formed the very decided opinion that there
was some discreditable entanglement in my pre-nuptial days."</p>

<p>"What exactly did this friend of yours say?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing very particular, but it was the way he said it.
He remarked jokingly that we had both been birds of gay plumage
once, and he went on to ask me, very pointedly, so my wife will
have it, if I had altogether forgotten a lonely little bachelor
holiday we had once both spent upon a houseboat up the Thames."
The archdeacon shook his head angrily. "Of course, there was
nothing at all to hide, but it was the foolish way in which he
stressed the words 'bachelor' and 'lonely' that caused all the
trouble. My wife did not like it at all, and she has referred to
it quite a lot since, taking the view that it is unseemly there
should be any suggestion that a man in my position should have
any actions of his youthful days to regret."</p>

<p>"Could everyone else see her annoyance at the time?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"Only those who knew her well would have noticed it," replied
the archdeacon. "She appeared to laugh it off then, but
immediately our guest had gone and we were alone she asked me
about it, and asked very suspiciously, too. Indeed, I have never
seen her quite like it before." He spoke testily. "But why do you
ask all this? It has nothing whatever to do with that letter I
received."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know so much about that," exclaimed Larose at
once. He tapped the letter he was holding in his hand. "At any
rate this gentleman seems to be quite aware of a chink in your
armor there and he is now stabbing through."</p>

<p>A short silence followed, and then Larose went on in brisk and
business-like tones. "Well, I think I've got a good grasp of all
the main facts now, and the next thing is to get upon the trail
of the blackmailer." He looked intently at the archdeacon. "Now,
how long is it since the date of your daughter's wedding was
finally decided upon and publicly announced?"</p>

<p>"Three months," replied the archdeacon, "almost immediately
after the news of the engagement was given out."</p>

<p>"And how long is it since the Bishop of Durham was taken
ill?"</p>

<p>"He had a seizure seven weeks ago."</p>

<p>"And when were you first told you would probably be his
successor?"</p>

<p>"Within a very few days of his being taken ill. It was
realised at once that he would never be able to take on his
duties again, however long a time he might linger on."</p>

<p>Larose spoke very slowly. "And I suppose the matter of the
bishopric was discussed among you, in the home circle of your
family?" he asked.</p>

<p>The archdeacon nodded. "Yes, naturally, we have spoken about
it." He smiled. "It is not a happening that occurs very often in
a churchman's life."</p>

<p>"And, of course, the servants have heard something about it,
too?" queried Larose.</p>

<p>The archdeacon frowned. "Y-e-s, I suppose so." He hesitated a
moment. "In fact we had to, in some way, take them into our
confidence, because some much-needed repairs that I was
contemplating to my house have been cancelled in
consequence."</p>

<p>Larose spoke most decisively. "Then there is no doubt in my
mind, sir, that a confederate of the blackmailer will be found
among your domestic staff, and by what malign chance he came to
get in touch with one of them we shall have to find out."</p>

<p>The archdeacon's eyes blazed. "Fantastic and impossible!" he
exclaimed. "Our servants are our faithful friends! Good heavens!
Why, for generations the Revington-Montgomerys have almost bred
their own servants! My butler, man and boy, has been with me
since he was fifteen; the mother of my cook served my father and
his father before him for more than seventy years, and the
shortest term of service of any of our present maids is eleven
years." He scoffed contemptuously. "The very idea is
preposterous!"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head and his tones were equally as emphatic
as those of the archdeacon. "But everything suggests the
inspiration of this letter coming from someone inside your home.
It's writer knows Lady Hawkesbury is not pleased that her son is
marrying your daughter, and would delight to find some excuse to
compel him to give her up, and he knows your wife has been upset
lately by supposed revelations of your college days." He raised
his hand convincingly. "He must be aware of both these facts
because he specially underlines Lady Hawkesbury and your wife,
and mentions them, first, in his letter, thereby stressing they
are your most vulnerable points. Then he knows you are in the
running for that bishopric, because he is in a great hurry there,
fearing the present bishop may die and you be offered and accept
the See before he handles the money. Look&mdash;he only gives you
seven days! Yes, yes, all his information is up to date, for it
is only since that doctor dined with you last week that Mrs.
Revington-Montgomery comes into the picture, and he must have
been told about things there by someone who knows your wife well.
Remember, you have just said that only those who are intimately
acquainted with her would have seen her vexation that night."</p>

<p>"But the first person when a blackmailer is threatening a
man," retorted the archdeacon hotly, "would, naturally, be that
man's wife."</p>

<p>"No, not to bring up a happening of thirty years ago to her,"
said Larose, "unless he had special reason to know he could wound
her there. Most wives would take no notice of anything happening
so long ago."</p>

<p>"You distress me," said the archdeacon, stirring uneasily in
his chair. "I cannot conceive any member of my household would
have any part in bringing upon me such unhappiness."</p>

<p>Larose shook his head again. "But you must face facts, sir,
and so I insist that, as a preliminary to the enquiries I will
make, you realise this blackmailer is intimately in touch with
your affairs." He spoke very quietly. "And that being so, I ask
you how else could he get in touch with them, except through the
servants."</p>

<p>The archdeacon looked very worried. "But what in that case can
I do?" His voice hardened resentfully. "You surely don't suggest
I cross-examine my own domestics! Do you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied Larose instantly, "for that would
spoil everything." He smiled. "Now, how many servants do you
keep?"</p>

<p>"Four maids and a butler."</p>

<p>"Well, I must see them when they can have no idea what I am
after," said Larose. He considered for a moment. "Yes, I'll come
up to dinner with you tonight. Fortunately, I am free. You'll say
I am the son of another old college friend and you can give out I
own a large sheep-station in Australia."</p>

<p>The archdeacon looked as if he were not too pleased at the
idea. "But it happens," he frowned, "Lady Hawkesbury and her son
are dining with us tonight,
and&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! It'll be quite all right," laughed Larose, guessing
instinctively what was in the archdeacon's mind. "I've got a
dress suit and I shan't disgrace you." He looked very amused.
"Last month, for a whole week, I was one of a house-party given
by a certain ducal gentleman who often entertains Royalty, and no
one ever came to know I was only a policeman. Well, you'll
introduce me as Mr. Howard. That's a good name. I'll be Spencer
Howard and you'll say I'm over here on holiday. Then"&mdash;he
frowned&mdash;"what excuse can you make to take me into the
kitchen? I must see the cook and the other maids. Now, what have
you got in the kitchen that would, seemingly, be of interest to
anyone coming from Australia?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied the archdeacon curtly. "I am very
conservative and we don't go in for electric ranges or any new
fangled nonsense. We cook everything in the old-fashioned way,
exactly as it was done in my father's time and his father's
before him."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" exclaimed Larose, his face at once brightening up,
"then does it happen by any chance that you roast your joints on
one of those most interesting old revolving spits? You do!
Splendid! It couldn't be better! I've never seen one and you
shall take me into the kitchen to have a good look at it."</p>

<p>So that night Larose found himself one of a very select little
party at the stately Rectory in Hanover square. The Dowager Lady
Hawkesbury was cold and reserved, and regarded him haughtily
through her lorgnette. Young Lord Hawkesbury was boyish and
friendly, and the bride-to-be, a very lovely girl, with beautiful
long-lashed blue eyes, was quite friendly, too. The archdeacon's
wife was condescendingly polite and nothing more. It was quite
easy to see that her reverend husband was very much afraid of
her.</p>

<p>Larose, looking smart and well-dressed, was quite at his ease,
and out of pure devilry and to the great discomforture of the
archdeacon, started right-away to fib outrageously.</p>

<p>Suiting his remarks to what he considered would be to the
taste of the haughty dowager, he spoke grandly of his sheep
station in Australia and the many lordly visitors he had
entertained there for kangaroo shooting.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Newark bagged twenty-nine one afternoon," he told
them impressively, "and his Excellency Lord Thistleton twenty-one. Viscount Tuttering, however, was a bad shot and only got
three."</p>

<p>At the mention of such aristocratic personages, the eyes of
Lady Hawkesbury opened very wide and she began to thaw
perceptibly. "And how large is your sheep station, Mr. Howard?"
she asked sweetly.</p>

<p>"Oh, not very big!" replied Larose carelessly. "Only about
4,000 square miles," and her ladyship, appearing to be greatly
interested, continued the conversation in the most friendly
way.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Revington-Montgomery asked Larose, a little too
casually the latter thought, if his father ever talked about her
husband and the college days they had spent together.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, quite a lot!" nodded Larose. "They had such merry
times together." He saw the archdeacon wince uncomfortably, but
went on laughingly, "but dad often says your husband was a sort
of schoolmaster to them all, trying to keep them in order as much
as he could. Indeed, they never dared to tell him half their
pranks, because he was so strict." His eyes twinkled. "My father
says they used to call him 'Old Goody-goody,' he was so prim and
proper."</p>

<p>The archdeacon scowled, got very red, and then the corners of
his mouth twitched and his face broke into a reluctant smile.
Finally, after a great effort to suppress it, he burst into a
loud and merry laugh.</p>

<p>The laughter was infectious, and everyone joined in. Then Mrs.
Revington-Montgomery asked, "And does he ever mention Sir James
Vereker?"</p>

<p>"Sir James Vereker?" queried Larose, looking very puzzled.
"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"The eminent surgeon," she explained. "He was at Oxford at the
same time as my husband."</p>

<p>A light seemed to break upon Larose. "Oh, Sawbones Jim!" he
exclaimed smilingly. "Yes, yes, he often does. He says Jim was a
very fine fellow, but a great practical joker, and you could
never believe a word he said. He thinks he must have sobered down
a lot to have got the reputation he has."</p>

<p>Mrs. Revington-Montgomery turned to her husband. "But you've
never mentioned to us that you used to call him Sawbones,
Augustine?"</p>

<p>The archdeacon shook his head. "No, I didn't like the
nickname," he replied. "I thought it vulgar." He scowled at
Larose. "I think so now."</p>

<p>The general conversation was resumed, with Larose always
mindful, however, with what purpose he had come to the rectory.
His eyes rested many times upon the butler, and the bright-looking maids who were in attendance upon them.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing there," he murmured. "Both quite unimpeachable,
and certainly not criminal types. I must wait until I've seen the
cook and the other maid."</p>

<p>Presently, when he was partaking of some delicious saddle of
mutton, he looked rather puzzled, and then turned to his hostess.
"Do you know," he said impressively, "this mutton carries me to
more than thirteen thousand miles away. It has a taste that I
have not experienced since I left Australia, with the
unmistakable flavor of meat roasted over a fire, just like we get
when camping out in the bush. It seems to me quite different from
meat baked in an oven."</p>

<p>Mrs. Revington-Montgomery beamed. "So glad you like it, Mr.
Howard," she said, "but it is not astonishing you have noticed
it, for it is roasted and not baked. It is roasted upon a spit."
She looked affectionately at her spouse. "It is one of the
obsessions of my husband that we should always roast everything
that way."</p>

<p>So, of course, it was quite natural that Larose, as a most
interested arrival from over the seas, should be taken later into
the kitchen to see the famous spit, and then it was the head
parlor-maid who explained its clockwork arrangement to him. The
cook was plump and short and shy, and she blushed delightedly
when Larose gave it as his emphatic opinion that the dinner he
had just eaten was by far the best he had partaken of since his
arrival in England.</p>

<p>The inspection of the spit over, the archdeacon, at Larose's
request, took him into the conservatory to look at the ferns.</p>

<p>"What's the parlor-maid's name?" asked Larose sharply. "She
appears the only likely passer-on of any gossip from the house,
and if she's a confederate, I should say she was quite an
unintentional one. She's a great talker. Now, tell me all about
her and who her people are."</p>

<p>"Her name's Ella Rawlins," replied the archdeacon, "and she's
been with us since she was sixteen. She's about thirty now. She's
an orphan, and has no relations, except a widowed aunt, a Mrs.
Clubber, who keeps a working man's boarding house in a street off
Tottenham Court road. Fisher place, I think it's called."</p>

<p>"Well, has she been visiting this aunt lately," asked Larose,
"since that night when Sir James Vereker dined here?"</p>

<p>The archdeacon smiled drily. "I really do not know, but last
Sunday was her Sunday off, and she was away all day."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Larose. "Then I'll think of some excuse to
go and see that aunt tomorrow."</p>

<p>So the following afternoon, rather poorly dressed, and
describing himself as a clerk in casual employment, Larose
proceeded to interview Mrs. Clubber, with the suggestion of
becoming one of her boarders for a time. Her place was a
converted shop, with a number of rooms above, and she occupied
the whole of the premises, using the shop itself as the dining
room. It was really more than a boarding house, for besides
taking four boarders who "slept in," she catered for the morning
and evening meals of eleven other men, who had sleeping
accommodation close near.</p>

<p>Fortunately, at that moment she had one bedroom unoccupied
and, upon Larose stating he had been recommended to her by the
archdeacon, she welcomed him with open arms, and a bargain was
soon struck.</p>

<p>Like her niece, she was a very talkative woman and, when
showing him into the room he was to occupy, proceeded to regale
him with intimate private details of the lives of the other men
who were full boarders with her. One was an assistant in a
grocer's shop, another was a motor mechanic, and the third worked
at a butcher's.</p>

<p>"And such perfect gentlemen!" she exclaimed. "Nothing rowdy
about them, and only taking a pint or two, and getting frisky,
very occasionally. I'm sure you'll soon make great friends of
them."</p>

<p>Then the conversation veered round to the archdeacon, and upon
Larose telling her he had only spoken to that reverend gentleman
once, she started to tell all she knew about him.</p>

<p>"His daughter is most beautiful," she said, "and she's going
to be married to a young lord in three weeks. It's most romantic
and a perfect love match, love at first sight, so I've been told,
and she's two years older than he is." She lowered her voice
darkly. "They do say the young lord's mother had chosen a rich
heiress for her son, but the boy proposed to Miss Revington-Montgomery without telling his mother anything about it, and now
she can't stop the marriage."</p>

<p>She went on mysteriously. "And there are rumors that the
archdeacon will be a bishop soon, when some old man dies. Of
course, it's not been in the newspapers yet, but my niece, who's
head-parlor-maid at the Rectory, has told us all about it."</p>

<p>"Certainly, everything looks most promising," remarked Larose
to himself when Mrs. Clubber had at last taken herself off. "A
man here, with compromising letters in his possession, would at
once realise their possibilities for blackmail when he heard all
the tittle-tattle from the Rectory with which that parlor-maid
has been undoubtedly regaling her aunt. He would visualise the
suspicious wife and the intense anxiety of the archdeacon that no
scandals should be broadcast at a critical time like this."</p>

<p>But when at seven o'clock that evening he took his seat at the
long trestle table, among the other partakers of the high tea
provided, his heart sank. Everyone there looked so harmless and
there was certainly no one of pronounced criminal type among
them. They were mostly youngish men and full of life and
merriment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clubber was bustling about and taking her full part in
the jokes and conversation and, with many eyes twinkling, she
informed Larose, as a newcomer, that she suffered badly from
corns, had got a floating kidney, and would soon have to take to
a wig if her hair continued to go on coming out, as it was now
doing. Evidently, she had no affairs of a strictly private
nature.</p>

<p>Then suddenly noticing a newspaper upon a shelf, Larose was
seized with an idea, and he chuckled to himself at its
simplicity.</p>

<p>When the tea things had been cleared away, pipes and
cigarettes were brought out, and with no one leaving the room,
games of dominoes and cards were started. Larose waited a few
minutes and then took the newspaper off the shelf and started to
read. But there was, apparently, nothing of much interest in it
and, waiting for a lull in the conversation, he threw it down and
remarked loudly so that everybody could hear:&mdash;"Well, the
old bishop of Durham is dead at last!"</p>

<p>But no one that he could see took any notice, so rising from
the form upon which he had been sitting, he walked over and stood
behind one of a party of four who were playing cards.</p>

<p>Nothing happened for a few moments, and then out of the tail
of his eye he saw a little, plump man, one of the few elderly men
in the room, move over and pick up the discarded paper.</p>

<p>The plump man took out and adjusted a pair of large spectacles
and started to read. But his reading was not of a concentrated
nature, for he ran down the columns of the newspaper, one by one,
and went quickly from one page to another.</p>

<p>"Great Jupiter!" exclaimed Larose, with his heart beating a
little faster, "but I do believe I'm getting a bite."</p>

<p>The plump man went through the entire paper, twice, and then,
with a frown, took off his spectacles and returned them to his
pocket. Then, after a minute or two, Larose felt rather than saw
him sidling up to him. The man spoke very quietly and in quite a
pleasant voice.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he said, "but did I hear you say the Bishop of
Durham was dead?"</p>

<p>Larose took good stock of him. He seemed most inoffensive,
and, indeed, of a retiring and timid disposition.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Larose with a smile. "Was he a friend of
yours?"</p>

<p>"No," laughed the man a little nervously, "but I used to live
in Durham, and am interested." His voice seemed to shake. "But I
didn't find it in that paper you were reading."</p>

<p>"Oh, it wasn't there," said Larose, "but I happened to hear
two clergymen talking about it in the bus this afternoon," and
then the little man, with a nod of thanks for the information, at
once picked a shabby hat from off a peg and went out of the
room.</p>

<p>Knowing that he was one of the habitués of the place, and
could be laid hands upon whenever he was wanted, Larose did not
attempt to follow, but later in the evening made some enquiries
about him from Mrs. Clubber.</p>

<p>"Oh! that little, plump man with the round face and bald
head!" she exclaimed. "He's Mr. Gentile, and he's a perfect
little gentleman, always so polite and quiet. He's very clever
and writes stories that will get published one day. He works in a
money-lender's office, the United Loan and Discount Company in
Theobald's road, but it's very sad, for he was given a month's
notice a little while ago and, as he's over fifty, he doesn't
know where he'll get another job."</p>

<p>She rattled on. "He's a widower and he's got a little son, in
some Home in Hendon, who's lately gone blind. No one can cure him
in England, but they do say that, if the lad could get taken to
Vienna, a foreign doctor there would put him right at once. Yes,
he's very clever, this Mr. Gentile, and he's just done my income
tax papers for me and got my assessment down, too. Where does he
live? He's got a room just round the corner in Vane street, over
a boot repairer's there. Yes, he's a perfect little gentleman,
Mr. Gentile."</p>

<p>The following morning Larose, made up as an elderly man,
called in at the United Loan and Discount Company, with an
enquiry as to exactly what repayments would have to be made if
they lent him £50 upon his furniture. The company was evidently
not in a big way of business, occupying only an office and a back
room in a basement under a shop. Larose saw Mr. Gentile at work
upon a typewriter at the back.</p>

<p>Appearing very hard of hearing, the terms of repayment for the
contemplated loan were with difficulty explained to the elderly
gentleman, who at length induced the clerk to have them typed
down for him upon a sheet of the firm's official paper and it was
to Gentile, he saw, to whom was given the typing, his machine
being apparently the only one in the office. Then Larose left,
promising to consider the matter.</p>

<p>That evening at Mrs. Clubber's after high tea, Larose
buttonholed the plump, amiable-looking Mr. Gentile and asked him
smilingly if he would do him a great service. "It's my income tax
paper," he explained, "and I can't get it right. Mrs. Clubber
tells me you understand all about income tax, and do hers for
her. So could you very kindly come up to my bedroom for a few
minutes?'</p>

<p>The little man complied readily, and they mounted to the
bedroom together. Then, with the door shut upon them, the whole
demeanor of Larose altered, and with a very stern expression upon
his face he gripped Gentile by the arm.</p>

<p>"See here, my fine fellow," he rapped out menacingly and with
no preamble, "I'm a detective from Scotland Yard, and I'm going
to arrest you straight-away upon the charge of attempting to
extort money under threats from Archdeacon Revington-Montgomery.
No, no," he went on fiercely, "it's no good your attempting to
deny it. I've got it proved up to the very hilt." He shook his
finger in Gentile's face. "Your letter was written upon the paper
of your firm, and with the self-same typewriter that you yourself
always use. I've been investigating at the office this evening."
He pushed the man down into the chair. "Now, then, what have you
got to say to the charge?"</p>

<p>But Gentile was speechless in his terror. His body shook as if
he were in an ague, his face was ashen grey, and he heaved big,
deep breaths, as if he were choking.</p>

<p>"Come on," snarled Larose furiously, "confess, and it'll save
both you and us a lot of trouble. You're booked for seven years,
my friend, and I shouldn't wonder if the judge doesn't order a
flogging as well."</p>

<p>The little man found his voice at last. "But I don't think I
should have gone on with it," he wailed. "I don't think I should
have done any more. I was getting frightened. I only did it on
the spur of the moment, because I was desperate. I was going to
be thrown out of my job. I'm dreadfully sorry."</p>

<p>"But who are you working with?" hissed Larose. "Don't attempt
to make out you're doing all this on your own. Who's got those
letters of the archdeacon's?"</p>

<p>Gentile's voice broke and he burst into tears. "There are no
letters," he sobbed jerkily. "I made it up, and there's no one
working with me. I imagined everything myself."</p>

<p>Larose's face was a study. Amazement, incredulity and disgust
were struggling for the mastery. He wanted to kick himself for
not having thought of that possibility before, and he wanted to
laugh at the same time. So this insignificant little man, with
the cherub face, had been the one to launch the thunderbolt! This
childlike individual had been trying his apprentice hand at
crime!</p>

<p>"You write stories, I hear," said Larose sharply. "Well, what
kind of stories?"</p>

<p>"Detective ones," jerked the little man. "It's been a hobby of
mine."</p>

<p>Larose could grin at last. "Good! And now you'll be able to
write one about me," he said grimly, "and how I got you seven
years' hard labor."</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do?" wept Gentile. "Are you going
to put me in prison tonight?"</p>

<p>For a long minute Larose considered and there was no sound in
the room, except the sniffing of the malefactor, who was mopping
at his eyes with a very ragged handkerchief.</p>

<p>Then Larose said sternly. "The best thing, I think, will be
for you to write a full confession and I'll take you straight-away round to the archdeacon. Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"No, I've never seen him," quavered Gentile. "All I know about
him is what Mrs. Clubber told me when I was doing her income tax
papers. She said some doctor had disclosed he had once led a gay
life, and that his wife was very angry about it. That put the
idea into my head and I looked up all about him in the Clerical
Dictionary. Mrs. Clubber said, too, he was going to be made the
next Bishop of Durham."</p>

<p>Larose borrowed a pad of paper from Mrs. Clubber and the
confession was at once written, with the little man's tears
falling upon the paper.</p>

<p>Then they both sallied forth into the street and after a call
at a telephone box, where Larose learnt the archdeacon was not at
the Rectory, but was taking the Wednesday eight o'clock evensong
at the church, they proceeded to St. James's.</p>

<p>"I'll take you into the vestry afterwards," Larose informed
his prisoner grimly, "and we'll see what the archdeacon is
prepared to do."</p>

<p>Arriving at their destination, they saw the assembled
congregation was a very small one, barely a score of worshippers
being present, and, apart from a few pews adjacent to the chancel
rails, the church was not lighted up. The candles upon the altar
burnt dimly, and there was mystery and gloom in the shadows of
the body of the building, and the high arched roof above.</p>

<p>The service was a choral one, and the music was very
beautiful, with the organ notes pealing soft and low.</p>

<p>The Psalms were being chanted as the two late arrivals felt
their way in the darkness into one of the back pews, and the
little man shook and shivered as he heard:&mdash;"Let them be
confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul; let them be
turned back and brought to confusion that imagine evil against
me."</p>

<p>The service was very short, and, waiting until everyone was
leaving, Larose led the shaking Gentile to the door of the
vestry, and asked to speak to the archdeacon.</p>

<p>The latter was very surprised to see him, and stared
wonderingly at his white-faced companion. He led the way into a
little room off the vestry, and then closed the door.</p>

<p>Larose then preceded, very briefly, to tell him everything,
and produced the confession the Gentile had written.</p>

<p>Gentile himself was quivering, like a leaf, and kept opening
and shutting his mouth and swallowing hard.</p>

<p>The archdeacon looked very grave and stern and stood for many
moments considering, when Larose asked him if he were going to
lay a charge.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Gentile collapsed and was laid upon the floor in
a dead faint. His collar was loosened and his face bathed in cold
water.</p>

<p>"Why did he do it?" whispered the archdeacon to Larose.</p>

<p>"He's losing his job," whispered back Larose, "and apart from
that, he wanted money to get foreign medical treatment for his
son, who's gone blind, and they can't cure him over here." He
nodded. "It's quite true. I heard it from Mrs. Clubber before I
found him out."</p>

<p>In a few minutes Gentile had recovered and was able to sit up.
The archdeacon then drew Larose aside. "Would you kindly mind
going out for a few minutes?" he said grimly. "I take it your
profession has made you a scoffer, and I'd rather speak to this
man alone." He smiled. "Go and sit where I was sitting, and then
you'll be able to tell people you've sat in the seat of a man who
afterwards became a bishop." He nodded. "His Lordship of Durham
passed away this morning."</p>

<p>So for half an hour and longer Larose waited in the darkness
of the church, beginning to think presently that the business in
the vestry would never end.</p>

<p>But Gentile came tip-toeing out at last. His eyes were red and
swollen, but his face, although still heavy with emotion, was a
happy one. He was holding a letter in his hand.</p>

<p>"He wants you now," he whispered. "He's not going to prosecute
me and he's going to get me a job. He's given me this letter,
too. It's to a great doctor Sir James Vereker and he says my boy
shall be sent to Vienna." His voice choked as he jerked his head
back in the direction of the vestry. "He's an archangel as well
as an archdeacon."</p>

<p>The archdeacon was looking quite exhausted when Larose
proceeded into the vestry. "It's all over," he said with a great
sight of relief, "and the matter is closed. Of course I am not
going to hand him over to the police." He pursed up his lips and
nodded grimly. "I shall befriend that man as some
atonement"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"for certain follies of my
youth." He smiled whimsically. "The mills of God grind slowly,
but my punishment came at last." He looked intently at Larose.
"Now, sir, you have lifted a load of misery from me and you are a
wonderful man! How can I repay you?"</p>

<p>"My job," smiled Larose. "I'm glad you are not prosecuting.
That fellow's not really bad and he's not a criminal at heart.
No, no, of course I wouldn't take a penny. You pay me in your
taxes. Good-night, sir. A very interesting little case, and I've
quite enjoyed it."</p>

<p>The following morning Larose received an almost regal-looking
card of invitation to the wedding of Ethel, daughter of
Archdeacon and Mrs. Revington-Montgomery," and upon the appointed
day, about a fortnight later, he accordingly presented himself at
the historic church of St. James's, Hanover square.</p>

<p>Then, standing among the large crowd of fashionably dressed
people waiting to pass in, he suddenly started and drew in a deep
breath. He could not believe his eyes.</p>

<p>Clad in a long black gown, a little plump man of important
bearing was standing at the top of the steps by the church door.
With stern and solemn mien, this man was scrutinising the
invitation cards of all who drew level with him, and then, with a
gesture of great dignity, he would motion to them to pass in.</p>

<p>Larose gasped. "Who's that man?" he asked incredulously of one
of the stalwart policemen who were standing by to make sure that
no unauthorised person entered the church.</p>

<p>"The assistant verger," nodded the policeman carelessly. "I've
not seen him here before, but I understand he's just been
appointed."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm &mdash;&mdash;, but I mustn't swear," murmured
Larose, "when I'm just going into church."</p>
