Paris: 1793</b>
</h2>

<p>There was not even a reaction.</p>

<p>On! ever on! In that wild, surging torrent; sowing the wind of
anarchy, of terrorism, of lust of blood and hate, and reaping a
hurricane of destruction and of horror.</p>

<p>On! ever on! France, with Paris and all her children still
rushes blindly, madly on; defies the powerful coalition, Austria,
England, Spain, Prussia, all joined together to stem the flow of
carnage, defies the Universe and defies God!</p>

<p>Paris this September, 1793!&mdash;or shall we call it
Vend&eacute;miaire, Year I of the Republic? Call it what we will!
Paris! a city of bloodshed, of humanity in its lowest, most
degraded, aspect, France herself a gigantic self-devouring monster,
her fairest cities destroyed, Lyons razed to the ground, Toulon,
Marseilles, masses of blackened ruins, her bravest sons turned to
lustful brutes or to abject cowards seeking safety at the cost of
any humiliation.</p>

<p>That is thy reward, O mighty, holy Revolution! Apotheosis of
equality and fraternity! Grand rival of decadent Christianity.</p>

<p>Five weeks now since Marat, the bloodthirsty Friend of the
People, succumbed beneath the sheath-knife of a virgin patriot; a
month since his murderess walked proudly, even enthusiastically, to
the guillotine! There has been no reaction&mdash;only a great
sigh!...Not of content or satisfied lust, but a sigh such as the
man-eating tiger might heave after his first taste of long-coveted
blood.</p>

<p>A sigh for more!</p>

<p>A king on the scaffold; a queen, degraded and abased, awaiting
death, which lingers on the threshold of her infamous prison; eight
hundred scions of ancient houses that have made the history of
France; brave generals, Custine, Blanchelande, Houchard,
Beauharnais; worthy patriots, noble-hearted women, misguided
enthusiasts, all by the score and by the hundred, up the few wooden
steps which lead to the guillotine.</p>

<p>An achievement, of a truth!</p>

<p>And still that sigh for more!</p>

<p>But for the moment&mdash;a few seconds only&mdash;Paris looked
round her mighty self, and thought things over!</p>

<p>The man-eating tiger for the space of a sigh licked his powerful
jaws and pondered!</p>

<p>Something new!&mdash;something wonderful!</p>

<p>We have had a new Constitution, a new Justice, new Laws, a new
Almanac!</p>

<p>What next?</p>

<p>Why, obviously! How comes it that great intellectual, aesthetic
Paris never thought of such a wonderful thing before? A new
religion!!</p>

<p>Christianity is old and obsolete, priests are aristocrats,
wealthy oppressors of the people, the Church but another form of
wanton tyranny.</p>

<p>Let us by all means have a new religion.</p>

<p>Already something has been done to destroy the old! To destroy!
always to destroy! Churches have been ransacked, altars spoliated,
tombs desecrated, priests and curates murdered; but that is not
enough.</p>

<p>There must be a new religion; and to attain that there must be a
new God.</p>

<p>"Man is a born idol-worshipper."</p>

<p>Very well then! let the People have a new religion and a new
God. Stay!&mdash;Not a God this time! for God means Majesty, Power,
Kingship! everything in fact which the mighty hand of the people of
France has struggled and fought to destroy. Not a God, but a
goddess.</p>

<p>A goddess! an idol! a toy! Since even the man-eating tiger must
play sometimes.</p>

<p>Paris wanted a new religion, and a new toy, and grave men,
ardent patriots, mad enthusiasts, sat in the Assembly of the
Convention and seriously discussed the means of providing her with
both these things which she asked for.</p>

<p>Chaumette I think it was who first solved the
difficulty&mdash;Procureur Chaumette, head of the Paris
Municipality, he who had ordered that the cart, which bore the
dethroned queen to the squalid prison of the Conciergerie, should
be led slowly past her own late palace of the Tuileries, and should
be stopped there just long enough for her to see and to feel, in
one grand mental vision, all that she had been when she dwelt
there, and all that she now was by the will of the People.</p>

<p>Chaumette, as you see, was refined, artistic; the torture of the
fallen Queen's heart meant more to him than a blow of the
guillotine on her neck.</p>

<p>No wonder, therefore, that it was Procureur Chaumette who first
discovered exactly what type of new religion Paris wanted just
now.</p>

<p>"Let us have a goddess of Reason," he said, "typified if you
will by the most beautiful woman in Paris. Let us have a feast of
the Goddess of Reason, let there be a pyre of all the gew-gaws
which for centuries have been flaunted by over-bearing priests
before the eyes of starving multitudes, let the people rejoice and
dance around that funeral pile, and above it all let the new
goddess tower smiling and triumphant. The Goddess of Reason! the
only deity our new and regenerate France shall acknowledge
throughout the centuries which are to come!" Loud applause greeted
the impassioned speech.</p>

<p>"A new goddess, by all means!" shouted the grave gentlemen of
the National Assembly, "the Goddess of Reason!"</p>

<p>They were all eager that the People should have this toy;
something to play with and to tease, round which to dance the mad
carmagnole and sing the ever recurring "&Ccedil;a ira". Something
to distract the minds of the populace from the consequences of its
own deeds, and the helplessness of its legislators.</p>

<p>Procureur Chaumette enlarged upon its original idea, like a true
artist who sees the broad effect of a picture at a glance and then
fills in the minute details; he was already busy elaborating his
scheme.</p>

<p>"The goddess must be beautiful...not too young...Reason can only
go hand in hand with the riper age of second youth...she must be
decked out in classical draperies, severe yet suggestive...she must
be rouged and painted...for she is a mere idol...easy to be
appeased with incense, music, and laughter."</p>

<p>He was getting deeply interested in his subject, seeking
minutiae of detail, with which to render his theme more and more
attractive.</p>

<p>But patience was never the characteristic of the revolutionary
government of France. The National Assembly soon tired of
Chaumette's dithyrambic utterances. Up aloft on the Mountain,
Danton was yawning like a gigantic leopard.</p>

<p>Soon Henriot was on his feet. He had a far finer scheme than
that of the Procureur to place before his colleagues. A grand
nation f&ecirc;te, semi-religious in character, but of the new
religion which destroyed and desecrated and never knelt in
worship.</p>

<p>Citizen Chaumette's Goddess of Reason by all means&mdash;Henriot
conceded that the idea was a good one&mdash;but the goddess merely
as a figure-head: around her a procession of unfrocked and apostate
priests, typifying the destruction of ancient hierarchy, mules
carrying loads of sacred vessels, the spoils of ten thousand
churches of France, and ballet girls in bacchanalian robes, dancing
the carmagnole around the new deity.</p>

<p>Public Prosecutor, Foucquier Tinville, thought all these schemes
very tame. Why should the people of France be led to think that the
era of a new religion would mean an era of milk and water, or
pageants and of fireworks? Let every man, woman and child know that
this was an era of blood, of blood and again of blood.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed in passionate accents, "would that all the
traitors in France had but one head, that it might be cut off with
one blow of the guillotine!"</p>

<p>He approved of the National f&ecirc;te, but he desired an
apotheosis of the guillotine; he undertook to find ten thousand
traitors to be beheaded on one grand and glorious day: ten thousand
heads to adorn the Place de la Revolution on a great,
never-to-be-forgotten evening, after the guillotine had
accomplished this record work.</p>

<p>But Collot d'Herbois would also have his say. Collot lately
hailed from the South, with a reputation for ferocity unparalleled
throughout the whole of this horrible decade. He would not be
outdone by Tinville's bloodthirsty schemes.</p>

<p>He was the inventor of the "Noyades," which had been so
successful at Lyons and Marseilles. "Why not give the inhabitants
of Paris one of these exhilarating spectacles?" he asked with a
coarse, brutal laugh.</p>

<p>Then he explained his invention of which he was inordinately
proud. Some two or three hundred traitors, men, women and children,
tied securely together with ropes, in great, human bundles, and
thrown upon a barge in the middle of the river: the barge with a
hole in her bottom! not too large! only sufficient to cause her to
sink slowly, very slowly in sight of the crowd of delighted
spectators.</p>

<p>The cries of the women and children, and even of the men, as
they felt the waters rising and gradually enveloping them, as they
felt themselves powerless even for a fruitless struggle, had proved
most exhilarating, so Citizen Collot declared, to the hearts of the
true patriots of Lyons.</p>

<p>Thus the discussion continued.</p>

<p>This was the era when every man had but one desire, that of
outdoing others in ferocity and brutality, and but one care, that
of saving his own head by threatening that of his neighbour.</p>

<p>The great duel between the Titanic leaders of these turbulent
parties, the conflict between hot-headed Danton on the one side and
cold-blooded Robespierre on the other, had only just begun, the
great, all-devouring monsters had dug their claws into one another,
but the issue of the combat was still at stake.</p>

<p>Neither of these two giants had taken part in these
deliberations anent the new religion and the new goddess. Danton
gave signs now and then of the greatest impatience, and muttered
something about a new form of tyranny, a new kind of
oppression.</p>

<p>On the left, Robespierre in immaculate sea-green coat and
carefully gauffered linen, was quietly polishing the nails of his
right hand against the palm of his left.</p>

<p>But nothing escaped him of what was going on. His ferocious
egoism, his unbounded ambition was even now calculating what
advantages to himself might accrue from this idea of the new
religion and of the National f&ecirc;te, what personal
aggrandisement he could derive therefrom.</p>

<p>The matter outwardly seemed trivial enough, but already his keen
and calculating mind had seen various side issues which might tend
to place him&mdash;Robespierre&mdash;on a yet higher and more
unassailable pinnacle.</p>

<p>Surrounded by those who hated him, those who envied and those
who feared him, he ruled over them all by the strength of his own
cold-blooded savagery, by the resistless power of his merciless
cruelty.</p>

<p>He cared about nobody but himself, about nothing but his own
exaltation: every action of his career, since he gave up his small
practice in a quiet provincial town in order to throw himself into
the wild vortex of revolutionary politics, every word he ever
uttered had but one aim&mdash;Himself.</p>

<p>He saw his colleagues and comrades of the old Jacobin Clubs
ruthlessly destroyed around him: friends he had none, and all left
him indifferent; and now he had hundreds of enemies in every
assembly and club in Paris, and these, too, one by one were being
swept up in that wild whirlpool which they themselves had
created.</p>

<p>Impassive, serene, always ready with a calm answer when passions
raged most hotly round him, Robespierre, the most ambitious, most
self-seeking demagogue of his time, had acquired the reputation of
being incorruptible and selfless, an enthusiastic servant of the
Republic.</p>

<p>The sea-green Incorruptible!</p>

<p>And thus whilst others talked and argued, waxed hot over schemes
for processions and pageantry, or loudly denounced the whole matter
as the work of a traitor, he, of the sea-green coat, sat quietly
polishing his nails.</p>

<p>But he had already weighed all these discussions in the balance
of his mind, placed them in the crucible of his ambition, and
turned them into something that would benefit him and strengthen
his position.</p>

<p>Aye! the feast should be brilliant enough! gay or horrible, mad
or fearful, but through it all the people of France must be made to
feel that there was a guiding hand which ruled the destinies of
all, a head which framed the new laws, which consolidated the new
religion and established its new goddess: the Goddess of
Reason.</p>

<p>Robespierre, her prophet!</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2" id="Chapter2"></a>Chapter
2<br>
A Retrospect</b>
</h2>

<p>The room was close and dark, filled with the smoke from a
defective chimney.</p>

<p>A tiny boudoir, once the dainty sanctum of imperious Marie
Antoinette; a faint and ghostly odour, like unto the perfume of
spectres, seemed still to cling to the stained walls, and to the
torn Gobelin tapestries.</p>

<p>Everywhere lay the impress of a heavy and destroying hand: that
of the great and glorious Revolution.</p>

<p>In the mud-soiled corners of the room a few chairs, with
brocaded cushions rudely torn, leant broken and desolate against
the walls. A small footstool, once gilt-legged and satin-covered,
had been overturned and roughly kicked to one side, and there it
lay on its back, like some little animal that had been hurt,
stretching its broken limbs upwards, pathetic to behold.</p>

<p>From the delicately wrought Buhl table the silver inlay had been
harshly stripped out of its bed of shell.</p>

<p>Across the Lunette, painted by Boucher and representing a chaste
Diana surrounded by a bevy of nymphs, an uncouth hand had scribbled
in charcoal the device of the Revolution: <i>Libert&eacute;,
Egalit&eacute;, Fraternit&eacute; ou la Mort;</i> whilst, as if to
give a crowning point to the work of destruction and to emphasise
its motto, someone had decorated the portrait of Marie Antoinette
with a scarlet cap, and drawn a red and ominous line across her
neck.</p>

<p>And at the table two men were sitting in close and eager
conclave.</p>

<p>Between them a solitary tallow candle, unsnuffed and weirdly
flickering, threw fantastic shadows upon the walls, and illumined
with fitful and uncertain light the faces of the two men.</p>

<p>How different were these in character!</p>

<p>One, high cheek-boned, with coarse, sensuous lips, and hair
elaborately and carefully powdered, the other pale and thin-lipped,
with the keen eyes of a ferret and a high, intellectual forehead,
from which the sleek brown hair was smoothly brushed away.</p>

<p>The first of these men was Robespierre, the ruthless and
incorruptible demagogue, the other was Citizen Chauvelin,
ex-ambassador of the Revolutionary Government at the English
Court.</p>

<p>The hour was late, and the noise from the great, seething city
preparing for sleep came to this remote little apartment in the now
deserted Palace of the Tuileries merely as a faint and distant
echo.</p>

<p>It was two days after the Fructidor Riots. Paul
D&eacute;roul&egrave;de and the woman, Juliette Marny, both
condemned to death, had been literally spirited away out of the
cart which was conveying them from the Hall of Justice to the
Luxembourg Prison, and news had just been received by the Committee
of Public Safety that at Lyons the Abb&eacute; de Mesnil, with the
ci-devant Chevalier d'Egremont and the latter's wife and family,
had effected a miraculous and wholly incomprehensible escape from
the northern prison.</p>

<p>But this was not all. When Arras fell into the hands of the
Revolutionary army, and a regular cordon was formed round the town
so that not a single Royalist traitor might escape, some
three-score women and children, twelve priests, the old aristocrats
Chermeuil, Delleville and Galipaux, and many others, managed to
pass the barriers and were never recaptured.</p>

<p>Raids were made in the suspected houses: in Paris chiefly, where
the escaped prisoners might have found refuge&mdash;or, better
still, where their helpers and rescuers might still be lurking.
Foucquier Tinville, Public Prosecutor, led and conducted these
raids, assisted by that bloodthirsty vampire, Merlin. They heard of
a house in the Rue de l'Ancienne Com&eacute;die, where an
Englishman was said to have lodged for two days.</p>

<p>They demanded admittance, and were taken to the rooms where the
Englishman had stayed. These were bare and squalid, like hundreds
of other rooms in the poorer quarters of Paris. The landlady,
toothless and grimy, had not yet tidied up the one where the
Englishman had slept; in fact, she did not know he had left for
good.</p>

<p>He had paid for his room a week in advance, and came and went as
he liked, she explained to Citizen Tinville. She never bothered
about him, as he never took a meal in the house, and he was only
there two days. She did not know her lodger was English until the
day he left. She thought he was a Frenchman from the South, as he
certainly had a peculiar accent when he spoke.</p>

<p>"It was the day of the riots," she continued; "he would go out,
and I told him I did not think that the streets would be safe for a
foreigner like him: for he always wore such very fine clothes, and
I made sure that the starving men and women of Paris would strip
them off his back when their tempers were roused. But he only
laughed. He gave me a bit of paper and told me that if he did not
return I might conclude that he had been killed, and if the
Committee of Public Safety asked me questions about him, I was just
to show the bit of paper and there would be no further
trouble."</p>

<p>She had talked volubly, more than a little terrified at Merlin's
scowls, and the attitude of Citizen Tinville, who was known to be
very severe if anyone committed any blunders.</p>

<p>But the Citizeness&mdash;her name was Brogard, and her husband's
brother kept an inn in the neighbourhood of Calais&mdash;the
Citizeness Brogard had a clear conscience. She held a licence from
the Committee of Public Safety for letting apartments, and she had
always given due notice to the Committee of the arrival and
departure of her lodgers. The only thing was that if any lodger
paid her more than ordinarily well for the accommodation, and he so
desired it, she would send in the notice conveniently late, and
conveniently vaguely worded as to the description, status, and
nationality of her more liberal patrons.</p>

<p>This had occurred in the case of her recent English visitor.</p>

<p>But she did not explain it quite like that to Citizen Foucquier
Tinville or to Citizen Merlin. However, she was rather frightened,
and produced the scrap of paper which the Englishman had left with
her, together with the assurance that when she showed it there
would be no further trouble.</p>

<p>Tinville took it roughly out of her hand, but would not glance
at it. He crushed it into a ball and then Merlin snatched it from
him with a coarse laugh, smoothed out the creases on his knee, and
studied it for a moment.</p>

<p>There were four lines of what looked like poetry, written in a
language which Merlin did not understand. English, no doubt.</p>

<p>But what was perfectly clear, and easily comprehended by anyone,
was the little drawing in the corner, done in red ink, and
representing a small, star-shaped flower.</p>

<p>Then Tinville and Merlin both cursed loudly and volubly, and,
bidding their men follow them, turned away from the house in the
Rue de l'Ancienne Com&eacute;die and left its toothless landlady on
her own doorstep still volubly protesting her patriotism and her
desire to serve the Government of the Republic.</p>

<p>Tinville and Merlin, however, took the scrap of paper to Citizen
Robespierre, who smiled grimly as he in his turn crushed the
offensive little document in the palm of his well-washed hand.</p>

<p>Robespierre did not swear. He never wasted either words or
oaths; but he slipped the bit of paper inside the double lid of his
silver snuff-box, and then he sent a special messenger to Citizen
Chauvelin in the Rue Corneille, bidding him come that same evening,
after ten o'clock, to room No. 16 in the ci-devant Palace of the
Tuileries.</p>

<p>It was now half-past ten, and Chauvelin and Robespierre sat
opposite one another in the ex-boudoir of Queen Marie Antoinette,
and between them on the table, just below the tallow candle, was a
much-creased exceedingly grimy bit of paper.</p>

<p>It had passed through several unclean hands before Citizen
Robespierre's immaculately white fingers had smoothed it out and
placed it before the eyes of ex-ambassador Chauvelin.</p>

<p>The latter, however, was not looking at the paper, he was not
even looking at the pale, cruel face before him. He had closed his
eyes, and for a moment had lost sight of the small, dark room, of
Robespierre's ruthless gaze, of the mud-stained walls, and the
greasy floor. He was seeing, as in a bright and sudden vision, the
brilliantly lighted salons of the Foreign Office in London, with
beautiful Marguerite Blakeney gliding queen-like on the arm of the
Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>He heard the flutter of many fans, the frou-frou of silk
dresses, and above all the din and sound of dance music he heard an
inane laugh and an affected voice repeating the doggerel rhyme that
was even now written on that dirty piece of paper which Robespierre
had placed before him:&mdash;</p>

<p class="note">"We seek him here, we seek him there,<br>
Those Frenchies seek him everywhere!<br>
Is he in heaven, is he in hell,<br>
That demmed elusive Pimpernel?"</p>

<p>It was a mere flash! One of memory's swiftly effaced pictures,
when she shows us for the fraction of a second indelible pictures
from out our past. Chauvelin, in that same second, while his own
eyes were closed and Robespierre's fixed upon him, also saw the
lonely cliffs of Calais, heard the same voice singing "God save the
King!" the volley of musketry, the despairing cries of Marguerite
Blakeney; and once again he felt the keen and bitter pang of
complete humiliation and defeat.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3" id="Chapter3"></a>Chapter

Ex-Ambassador Chauvelin</b>
</h2>

<p>Robespierre had quietly waited the while. He was in no hurry:
being a night-bird of very pronounced tastes, he was quite ready to
sit here until the small hours of the morning, watching Citizen
Chauvelin mentally writhing in the throes of recollections of the
past few months.</p>

<p>There was nothing that delighted the sea-green Incorruptible
quite so much as the aspect of a man struggling with a hopeless
situation, and feeling a net of intrigue drawing gradually tighter
and tighter around him.</p>

<p>Even now, when he saw Chauvelin's smooth forehead wrinkled into
an anxious frown, and his thin hand nervously clutched upon the
table, Robespierre heaved a pleasurable sigh, leaned back in his
chair, and said with an amiable smile:</p>

<p>"You do agree with me, then, Citizen, that the situation has
become intolerable?"</p>

<p>Then as Chauvelin did not reply, he continued, speaking more
sharply:</p>

<p>"And how terribly galling it all is, when we could have had that
man under the guillotine by now, if you had not blundered so
terribly last year."</p>

<p>His voice had become hard and trenchant like that knife to which
he was so ready to make constant allusion. But Chauvelin still
remained silent. There was really nothing that he could say.</p>

<p>"Citizen Chauvelin, how you must hate that man!" exclaimed
Robespierre at last.</p>

<p>Then only did Chauvelin break the silence which up to now he had
appeared to have forced himself to keep.</p>

<p>"I do!" he said with unmistakable fervour.</p>

<p>"Then why do you not make an effort to retrieve the blunders of
last year?" queried Robespierre blandly. "The Republic has been
unusually patient and long-suffering with you, Citizen Chauvelin.
She has taken your many services and well-known patriotism into
consideration. But you know," he added significantly, "that she has
no use for worthless tools."</p>

<p>Then as Chauvelin seemed to have relapsed into sullen silence,
he continued with his original ill-omened blandness:</p>

<p>"Ma foi! Citizen Chauvelin, were I standing in your buckled
shoes, I would not lose another hour in trying to avenge mine own
humiliation!"</p>

<p>"Have I ever had a chance?" burst out Chauvelin with
ill-suppressed vehemence. "What can I do single-handed? Since war
has been declared I can not go to England unless the Government
will find some official reason for my doing so. There is much
grumbling and wrath over here, and when that damned Scarlet
Pimpernel League has been at work, when a score or so of valuable
prizes have been snatched from under the very knife of the
guillotine, then, there is much gnashing of teeth and useless
cursings, but nothing serious or definite is done to smother those
accursed English flies which come buzzing about our ears."</p>

<p>"Nay! you forget, Citizen Chauvelin," retorted Robespierre,
"that we of the Committee of Public Safety are far more helpless
than you. You know the language of these people: we don't. You know
their manners and customs, their ways of thought, the methods they
are likely to employ: we know none of these things. You have seen
and spoken to men in England who are members of that damned League.
You have seen the man who is its leader. We have not."</p>

<p>He leant forward on the table and looked more searchingly at the
thin, pallid face before him.</p>

<p>"If you named that leader to me now, if you described him, we
could go to work more easily. You could name him, an you would,
Citizen Chauvelin."</p>

<p>"I cannot," retorted Chauvelin doggedly.</p>

<p>"Ah! but I think you could. But there! I do not blame your
silence. You would wish to reap the reward of your own victory, to
be the instrument of your own revenge. Passons! I think it natural!
But in the name of your own safety, Citizen, do not be too greedy
with your secret. If the man is known to you, find him again, find
him, lure him to France! We want him&mdash;the people want him! And
if the people do not get what they want, they will turn on those
who have withheld their prey."</p>

<p>"I understand, Citizen, that your own safety and that of your
Government is involved in this renewed attempt to capture the
Scarlet Pimpernel," retorted Chauvelin drily.</p>

<p>"And your head, Citizen Chauvelin," concluded Robespierre.</p>

<p>"Nay! I know that well enough, and you may believe me, an you
will, Citizen, when I say that I care but little about that. The
question is, if I am to lure that man to France, what will you and
your Government do to help me?"</p>

<p>"Everything," replied Robespierre, "provided you have a definite
plan and a definite purpose."</p>

<p>"I have both. But I must go to England in, at least, a
semi-official capacity. I can do nothing if I am to hide in
disguise in out of the way corners."</p>

<p>"That is easily done. There has been some talk with the British
authorities anent the security and welfare of peaceful French
subjects settled in England. After a good deal of correspondence
they have suggested our sending a semi-official representative over
there to look after the interests of our own people commercially
and financially. We can easily send you over in that capacity if it
would suit your purpose."</p>

<p>"Admirably. I have only need of a cloak. That one will do as
well as another."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Not quite. I have several plans in my head, and I must know
that I am fully trusted. Above all, I must have power...Decisive,
absolute, illimitable power."</p>

<p>There was nothing of the weakling about this small, sable-clad
man, who looked the redoubtable Jacobin leader straight in the
face, and brought a firm fist resolutely down upon the table before
him. Robespierre paused awhile ere he replied; he was eyeing the
other man keenly, trying to read if behind that earnest, frowning
brow there did not lurk some selfish ulterior motive along with
that demand for absolute power.</p>

<p>But Chauvelin did not flinch beneath that gaze which could make
every cheek in France blanch with unnamed terror, and after that
slight moment of hesitation Robespierre said quietly:</p>

<p>"You shall have the complete power of a military dictator in
every town or borough of France which you may visit. The
Revolutionary Government shall create you, before you start for
England, Supreme Head of all the Sub-Committees of Public Safety.
This will mean that in the name of the safety of the Republic every
order given by you, of whatsoever nature it might be, must be
obeyed implicitly under pain of an arraignment for treason."</p>

<p>Chauvelin sighed a quick, sharp sigh of intense satisfaction,
which he did not even attempt to disguise before Robespierre.</p>

<p>"I shall want agents," he said, "or shall we say spies? And, of
course, money."</p>

<p>"You shall have both. We keep a very efficient secret service in
England, and they do a great deal of good over there. There is much
dissatisfaction in their Midland counties&mdash;you remember the
Birmingham riots? They were chiefly the work of our own spies. Then
you know Candeille, the actress? She has found her way among some
of those circles in London who have what they call Liberal
tendencies. I believe they are called Whigs. Funny name, isn't it?
It means perruque, I think. Candeille has given charity
performances, in aid of our Paris poor, in one or two of these Whig
clubs, and incidentally she has been very useful to us."</p>

<p>"A woman is always useful in such cases. I shall seek out the
Citizeness Candeille."</p>

<p>"And if she renders you useful assistance, I think I can offer
her what should prove a tempting prize. Women are so vain!" he
added, contemplating with rapt attention the enamel-like polish on
his fingernails. "There is a vacancy in the Maison Moli&eacute;re.
Or&mdash;what might prove more attractive still&mdash;in connection
with the proposed National f&ecirc;te, and the new religion for the
people, we have not yet chosen a Goddess of Reason. That should
appeal to any feminine mind. The impersonation of a goddess, with
processions, pageants, and the rest. Great importance and
prominence given to one personality. What say you, Citizen? If you
really have need of a woman for the furtherance of your plans, you
have that at your disposal which may enhance her zeal."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Citizen," rejoined Chauvelin calmly. "I always
entertained a hope that some day the Revolutionary Government would
call again on my services. I admit that I failed last year. The
Englishman is resourceful. He has wits and he is very rich. He
would not have succeeded, I think, but for his money&mdash;and
corruption and bribery are rife in Paris and on our coasts. He
slipped through my fingers at the very moment when I thought that I
held him most securely. I do admit all that, but I am prepared to
redeem my failure of last year, and...there is nothing more to
discuss. I am ready to start."</p>

<p>He looked round for his cloak and hat, and quietly readjusted
the set of his necktie. But Robespierre detained him a while
longer: that born mountebank, born torturer of the souls of men,
had not gloated sufficiently yet on the agony of mind of this
fellow man.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had always been trusted and respected. His services in
connection with the foreign affairs of the Revolutionary Government
had been invaluable, both before and since the beginning of the
European War. At one time he formed part of that merciless
decemvirate, which&mdash;with Robespierre at its head&mdash;meant
to govern France by laws of bloodshed and of unparalleled
ferocity.</p>

<p>But the sea-green Incorruptible had since tired of him, then had
endeavoured to push him on one side, for Chauvelin was keen and
clever, and, moreover, he possessed all those qualities of selfless
patriotism which were so conspicuously lacking in Robespierre.</p>

<p>His failure in bringing that interfering Scarlet Pimpernel to
justice and the guillotine had completed Chauvelin's downfall.
Though not otherwise molested, he had been left to moulder in
obscurity during this past year. He would soon enough have been
completely forgotten.</p>

<p>Now he was not only to be given one more chance to regain public
favour, but he had demanded power which, in consideration of the
aim in view, Robespierre himself could not refuse to grant him. But
the Incorruptible, ever envious and jealous, would not allow him to
exult too soon.</p>

<p>With characteristic blandness he seemed to be entering into all
Chauvelin's schemes, to be helping him in every way he could, for
there was something at the back of his mind which he meant to say
to the ex-ambassador, before the latter took his leave: something
which would show him that he was but on trial once again, and which
would demonstrate to him with perfect clearness that over him there
hovered the all powerful hand of the master.</p>

<p>"You have but to name the sum you want, Citizen Chauvelin," said
the Incorruptible, with an encouraging smile; "the Government will
not stint you, and you shall not fail for lack of authority or for
lack of funds."</p>

<p>"It is pleasant to hear that the Government has such uncounted
wealth," remarked Chauvelin with dry sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Oh! The last few weeks have been very profitable," retorted
Robespierre, "we have confiscated money and jewels from emigrant
royalists to the tune of several million francs. You remember the
traitor Juliette Marny, who escaped to England lately? Well! Her
mother's jewels and quite a good deal of gold were discovered by
one of our most able spies to be under the care of a certain
Abb&eacute; Foucquet, a calotin from Boulogne&mdash;devoted to the
family, so it seems."</p>

<p>"Yes?" queries Chauvelin indifferently.</p>

<p>"Our men seized the jewels and gold, that is all. We don't know
yet what we mean to do with the priest. The fisher-folk of Boulogne
like him, and we can lay our hands on him at any time, if we want
his old head for the guillotine. But the jewels were worth having.
There's a historic necklace worth half a million at least."</p>

<p>"Could I have it?" asked Chauvelin.</p>

<p>Robespierre laughed and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You said it belonged to the Marny family," continued the
ex-ambassador. "Juliette Marny is in England. I might meet her. I
cannot tell what may happen: but I feel that the historic necklace
might prove useful. Just as you please," he added with renewed
indifference. "It was a thought that flashed through my mind when
you spoke &mdash;nothing more."</p>

<p>"And to show you how thoroughly the Government trusts you,
Citizen Chauvelin," replied Robespierre with perfect urbanity, "I
will myself direct that the Marny necklace be placed unreservedly
in your hands; and a sum of fifty thousand francs for your expenses
in England. You see," he added blandly, "we give you no excuse for
a second failure."</p>

<p>"I need none," retorted Chauvelin drily, as he finally rose from
his seat, with a sigh of satisfaction that this interview was ended
at last.</p>

<p>But Robespierre, too, had risen, and pushing his chair aside, he
took a step or two towards Chauvelin. He was a much taller man than
the ex-ambassador. Spare and gaunt, he had a very upright bearing,
and in the uncertain light of the candle he seemed to tower
strangely and weirdly above the other man: the pale hue of his
coat, his light-coloured hair, the whiteness of his linen, all
helped to give to his appearance at that moment a curious spectral
effect.</p>

<p>Chauvelin somehow felt an unpleasant shiver running down his
spine as Robespierre, perfectly urbane and gentle in his manner,
placed a long, bony hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Citizen Chauvelin," said the Incorruptible, with some degree of
dignified solemnity, "meseems that we very quickly understood one
another this evening. Your own conscience, no doubt, gave you a
premonition of what the purport of my summons to you would be. You
say that you always hoped the Revolutionary Government would give
you one great chance to redeem your failure of last year. I, for
one, always intended that you should have that chance, for I saw,
perhaps, just a little deeper into your heart than my colleagues. I
saw not only enthusiasm for the cause of the People of France, not
only abhorrence for the enemy of your country, I saw a purely
personal and deadly hate of an individual man&mdash;the unknown and
mysterious Englishman who proved too clever for you last year. And
because I believe that hatred will prove sharper and more
far-seeing than selfless patriotism, therefore I urged the
Committee of Public Safety to allow you to work out your own
revenge, and thereby to serve your country more effectually than
any other &mdash;perhaps more pure-minded&mdash;patriot would do.
You go to England well provided with all that is necessary for the
success of your plans, for the accomplishment of your own personal
vengeance. The Revolutionary Government will help you with money,
passports, safe conducts; it places its spies and agents at your
disposal. It gives you practically unlimited power, wherever you
may go. It will not enquire into your motives, nor yet your means,
so long as these lead to success. But private vengeance or
patriotism, whatever may actuate you, we here in France demand that
you deliver into our hands the man who is known in two countries as
The Scarlet Pimpernel! We want him alive if possible, or dead if it
must be so, and we want as many of his henchmen as will follow him
to the guillotine. Get them to France, and we'll know how to deal
with them, and let the whole of Europe be damned."</p>

<p>He paused for awhile, his hand still resting on Chauvelin's
shoulder, his pale green eyes holding those of the other man as if
in a trance. But Chauvelin neither stirred nor spoke. His triumph
left him quite calm; his fertile brain was already busy with his
plans. There was no room for fear in his heart, and it was without
the slightest tremor that he waited for the conclusion of
Robespierre's oration.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Citizen Chauvelin," said the latter at last, "you have
already guessed what there is left for me to say. But lest there
should remain in your mind one faint glimmer of doubt of or hope,
let me tell you this. The Revolutionary Government gives you this
chance of redeeming your failure, but this one only; if you fail
again, your outraged country will know neither pardon nor mercy.
Whether you return to France or remain in England, whether you
travel North, South, East or West, cross the oceans, or traverse
the Alps, the hand of an avenging People will be upon you. Your
second failure will be punished by death, wherever you may be,
either by the guillotine, if you are in France, or if you seek
refuge elsewhere, then by the hand of an assassin. Look to it,
Citizen Chauvelin! For there will be no escape this time, not even
if the mightiest tyrant on earth tried to protect you, not even if
you succeed in building up an empire and placing yourself upon a
throne."</p>

<p>His thin, strident voice echoed weirdly in the small, close
boudoir. Chauvelin made no reply. There was nothing that he could
say. All that Robespierre had put so emphatically before him, he
had fully realised, even whilst he was forming his most daring
plans.</p>

<p>It was an "either&mdash;or" this time, uttered to <i>him</i>
now. He thought again of Marguerite Blakeney, and the terrible
alternative he had put before <i>her</i> less than a year ago.</p>

<p>Well! He was prepared to take the risk. He would not fail again.
He was going to England under more favourable conditions this time.
He knew <i>who</i> the man was, whom he was bidden to lure to
France and to death.</p>

<p>And he returned Robespierre's threatening gaze boldly and
unflinchingly; then he prepared to go. He took up his hat and
cloak, opened the door and peered for a moment into the dark
corridor, wherein, in the far distance, the steps of a solitary
sentinel could be faintly heard: he put on his hat, turned to look
once more into the room where Robespierre stood quietly watching
him, and went his way.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4" id="Chapter4"></a>Chapter

The Richmond Gala</b>
</h2>

<p>It was perhaps the most brilliant September ever known in
England, where the last days of dying summer are nearly always
golden and beautiful.</p>

<p>Strange that in this country, where that same season is so
peculiarly radiant with a glory all its own, there should be no
special expression in the language with which to accurately name
it.</p>

<p>So we needs must call it "fin d'&eacute;t&eacute;"&mdash;the
ending of the summer; not the absolute end, nor yet the ultimate
departure, but the tender lingering of a friend obliged to leave us
anon, yet who fain would steal a day here and there, a week or so
in which to stay with us: who would make that last pathetic
farewell of his endure a little while longer still, and brings
forth in gorgeous array for our final gaze all that he has which is
most luxuriant, most desirable, most worthy of regret.</p>

<p>And in this year of grace 1793, departing summer had lavished
the treasures of her palette upon woodland and river banks; had
tinged the once crude green of larch and elm with a tender hue of
gold, had brushed the oaks with tones of warm russet, and put
patches of sienna and crimson on the beech.</p>

<p>In the gardens the roses were still in bloom&mdash;not the
delicate blush or lemon ones of June, nor yet the pale Banksias and
climbers, but the full-blooded red roses of late summer, and
deep-coloured apricot ones, with crinkled outside leaves faintly
kissed by the frosty dew. In sheltered spots the purple clematis
still lingered, whilst the dahlias, brilliant of hue, seemed
overbearing in their gorgeous insolence, flaunting their crudely
coloured petals against sober backgrounds of mellow leaves, or the
dull, mossy tones of ancient, encircling walls.</p>

<p>The Gala had always been held about the end of September. The
weather, on the riverside, was most dependable then, and there was
always sufficient sunshine as an excuse for bringing out madam's
last new muslin gown, or her pale-coloured, quilted petticoat. Then
the ground was dry and hard, good alike for walking and for setting
up tents and booths. And of these there was of a truth a most
goodly array this year: mountebanks and jugglers from every corner
of the world, so it seemed, for there was a man with a face as
black as my lord's tricorne, and another with such flat, yellow
cheeks as made one think of batter pudding and spring aconite, of
eggs and other very yellow things.</p>

<p>There was a tent wherein dogs&mdash;all sorts of dogs, big,
little, black, white, or tan&mdash;did things which no Christian
with respect for his own backbone would have dared to perform, and
another where a weird-faced old man made bean stalks and walking
sticks, coins of the realm and lace &#8217;kerchiefs, vanish into
thin air.</p>

<p>And as it was nice and hot, one could sit out upon the green and
listen to the strains of the band, which discoursed sweet music,
and watch the young people tread a measure on the sward.</p>

<p>The quality had not yet arrived, for humbler folk had partaken
of a very early dinner, so as to get plenty of fun and long hours
of delight for the sixpenny toll demanded at the gates.</p>

<p>There was so much to see and so much to do: games of bowls on
the green, and a beautiful Aunt Sally; there was a skittle alley,
and two merry-go-rounds; there were performing monkeys and dancing
bears, a woman so fat that three men with arms outstretched could
not get round her, and a man so thin that he could put a lady's
bracelet round his neck and her garter round his waist. There were
some funny little dwarfs, with pinched faces and a knowing manner,
and a giant come all the way from Russia&mdash;so &#8217;twas
said.</p>

<p>The mechanical toys, too, were a great attraction. You dropped a
penny into a little slit in a box, and a doll would begin to dance
and play the fiddle; and there was the Magic Mill, where, for
another modest copper, a row of tiny figures, wrinkled and old and
dressed in the shabbiest of rags, marched in weary procession up a
flight of steps into the mill, only to emerge again the next moment
at a further door of this wonderful building looking young and gay,
dressed in gorgeous finery and tripping a dance measure as they
descended some steps and were finally lost to view.</p>

<p>But what was most wonderful of all, and collected the goodliest
crowd of gazers and the largest amount of coins, was a miniature
representation of what was going on in France even at this very
moment.</p>

<p>And you could not help but be convinced of the truth of it all,
so cleverly was it done. There was a background of houses and a
very red-looking sky.</p>

<p>"Too red!" some people said, but were immediately quashed by the
dictum of the wise, that the sky represented a sunset, as anyone
who looked could see. Then there were a number of little figures,
no taller than your hand, but with little wooden faces and arms and
legs, just beautifully made little dolls, and these were dressed in
kirtles and breeches&mdash;all rags mostly&mdash;and little coats
and wooden shoes. They were massed together in groups with their
arms all turned upwards.</p>

<p>And in the centre of this little stage, on an elevated platform,
there were miniature wooden posts close together, and with a long,
flat board at right angles at the foot of the posts, at the top,
was a miniature knife, which ran up and down in a groove and was
drawn by a miniature pulley. Folk who knew said that this was a
model of a guillotine.</p>

<p>And lo and behold! When you dropped a penny into a slot just
below the wooden stage, the crowd of little figures started waving
their arms up and down, and another little doll would ascend the
elevated platform and lie down on the red board at the foot of the
wooden posts. Then a figure dressed in brilliant scarlet put out an
arm, presumably to touch the pulley, and the tiny knife would
rattle down on to the poor little reclining doll's neck, and its
head would roll off into a basket beyond.</p>

<p>Then there was a loud whirr of wheels, a buzz of internal
mechanism, and all the little figures would stop dead, with arms
outstretched, whilst the beheaded doll rolled off the board and was
lost to view, no doubt preparatory to going through the same
gruesome pantomime again. It was very thrilling, and very terrible:
a certain air of hushed awe reigned in the booth where this
mechanical wonder was displayed.</p>

<p>The booth itself stood in a secluded portion of the grounds, far
from the toll-gates, and the bandstand, and the noise of the
merry-go-round, and there were great texts, written in red letters
on a black ground, pinned all along the walls: "Please spare a
copper for the starving poor of Paris."</p>

<p>A lady, dressed in grey quilted petticoat and pretty grey and
black striped paniers, could be seen walking in the booth from time
to time, then disappearing through a partition beyond. She would
emerge again presently, carrying an embroidered reticule, and would
wander round among the crowd, holding out the bag by its chain, and
repeating in tones of somewhat monotonous appeal: "For the starving
poor of Paris, if you please!"</p>

<p>She had fine dark eyes, rather narrow and tending upwards at the
outer corners, which gave her face a not altogether pleasant
expression. Still, they <i>were</i> fine eyes, and when she went
round soliciting alms most of the men put a hand into their
breeches pocket and dropped a coin into her embroidered
reticule.</p>

<p>She said the word "poor" in rather a funny way, rolling the "r"
at the end, and she also said "please" as if it were spelt with a
long line of "e's," and so it was concluded that she was French and
was begging for her poorer sisters. At stated intervals during the
day the mechanical toy was rolled into a corner, and the lady in
grey stood up on a platform, and sang queer little songs, the words
of which nobody could understand.</p>

<p class="note">"Il &eacute;tait une bergere, et ron et ron petit
pataplon"</p>

<p>But it all left an impression of sadness and of suppressed awe
upon the minds and susceptibilities of the worthy Richmond yokels,
come with their wives or sweethearts to enjoy the fun of the fair,
and gladly did everyone emerge out of that melancholy booth into
the sunshine, the brightness, and the noise.</p>

<p>"Lud! But she do give me the creeps," said Mistress Polly, the
pretty barmaid from the "Bell Inn" down by the river. "And I must
say that I don't see why we English folk should send our
hard-earned pennies to those murdering ruffians over the water.
Bein' starving, so to speak, don't make a murderer a better man if
he goes on murdering," she added with indisputable if ungrammatical
logic. "Come, let's look at something more cheerful now."</p>

<p>And without waiting for anyone else's assent, she turned towards
the more lively portion of the grounds closely followed by a
ruddy-faced, somewhat sheepish looking youth, who very obviously
was her attendant swain.</p>

<p>It was getting on for three o'clock now, and the quality were
beginning to arrive. Lord Anthony Dewhurst was already there,
chucking every pretty girl under the chin, to the annoyance of her
beau. Ladies were arriving all the time, and the humbler feminine
hearts were constantly a-flutter at sight of rich brocaded gowns,
and the new Charlottes, all crinkled velvet and soft marabout,
which were so becoming to the pretty faces beneath.</p>

<p>There was incessant and loud talking and chattering, with here
and there the shriller tones of a French voice being distinctly
noticeable in the din. There were a good many French ladies and
gentlemen present, easily recognisable, even in the distance, for
their clothes were of more sober hue and of lesser richness than
those of their English compeers.</p>

<p>But they were great lords and ladies, nevertheless&mdash;dukes
and duchesses and countesses, come to England for fear of being
murdered by those devils in their own country. Richmond was full of
them just now, as they were made right welcome both at the Palace
and at the magnificent home of Sir Percy and Lady Blakeney.</p>

<p>Ah! Here comes Sir Andrew Ffoulkes with his lady! So pretty and
dainty does she look, like a little china doll, in her
new-fashioned, short-waisted gown, her brown hair in soft waves
above her smooth forehead, her great hazel eyes fixed in unaffected
admiration on the gallant husband by her side.</p>

<p>"No wonder she dotes on him!" sighed pretty Mistress Polly,
after she had bobbed her curtsey to my lady. "The brave deeds he
did for love of her! Rescued her from those murderers over in
France, and brought her to England safe and sound, having fought no
end of them single-handed, so I've heard it said. Have not you,
Master Thomas Jezzard?"</p>

<p>And she looked defiantly at her meek-looking cavalier.</p>

<p>"Bah!" replied Master Thomas with quite unusual vehemence in
response to the disparaging look in her brown eyes, "'tis not he
who did it all, as you well know, Mistress Polly. Sir Andrew
Ffoulkes is a gallant gentleman, you may take your Bible oath on
that, but he that fights the murdering frog-eaters single-handed is
he whom they call the Scarlet Pimpernel: the bravest gentleman in
all the world."</p>

<p>Then, as at mention of the national hero, he thought that he
detected in Mistress Polly's eyes an enthusiasm which he could not
very well ascribe to his own individuality, he added with some
pique:</p>

<p>"But they do say that this same Scarlet Pimpernel is mightily
ill-favoured, and that's why no one ever sees him. They say he is
fit to scare the crows away, and that no Frenchy can look twice at
his face, for it's so ugly, and so they let him get out of the
country rather than look at him again."</p>

<p>"Then they do say a mighty lot of nonsense," retorted Mistress
Polly, with a shrug of her pretty shoulders, "and if that be so,
then why don't you go over to France and join hands with the
Scarlet Pimpernel? I'll warrant no Frenchman'll want to look twice
at your face."</p>

<p>A chorus of laughter greeted this sally, for the two young
people had in the meanwhile been joined by several of their
friends, and now formed part of a merry group near the band, some
sitting, others standing, but all bent on seeing as much as there
was to see in Richmond Gala this day. There was Johnny Cullen, the
grocer's apprentice from Twickenham, and Ursula Quekett, the
baker's daughter, and several "young &#8217;uns" from the
neighbourhood, as well as some older folks.</p>

<p>And all of them enjoyed a joke when they heard one, and thought
Mistress Polly's retort mightily smart. But then Mistress Polly was
possessed of two hundred pounds, all her own, left to her by her
grandmother, and on the strength of this extensive fortune had
acquired a reputation for beauty and wit not easily accorded to a
wench that had been penniless.</p>

<p>But Mistress Polly was also very kind-hearted. She loved to
tease Master Jezzard, who was an indefatigable hanger-on at her
pretty skirts, and whose easy conquest had rendered her somewhat
contemptuous; but at the look of perplexed annoyance and bewildered
distress in the lad's face, her better nature soon got the upper
hand. She realised that her remark had been unwarrantably spiteful,
and, wishing to make atonement, she said with a touch of coquetry
which quickly spread balm over the honest yokel's injured
vanity:</p>

<p>"La! Master Jezzard, you do seem to make a body say some queer
things. But there! You must own 'tis mighty funny about that
Scarlet Pimpernel!" she added, appealing to the company in general,
just as if Master Jezzard had been disputing the fact. "Why won't
he let anyone see who he is? And those who know him won't tell. Now
I have it for a fact from my lady's own maid Lucy, that the young
lady as is stopping at Lady Blakeney's house has actually spoken to
the man. She came over from France, come a fortnight tomorrow; she
and the gentleman they call Mossoo D&eacute;roulede. They both saw
the Scarlet Pimpernel and spoke to him. <i>He</i> brought them over
from France. Then why won't they say?"</p>

<p>"Say what?" commented Johnny Cullen, the apprentice.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he isn't," said old Clutterbuck, who was clerk of the
vestry at the church of St. John the Evangelist.</p>

<p>"Yes!" he added sententiously, for he was fond of his own
sayings and usually liked to repeat them before he had quite done
with them, "that's it, you may be sure. Perhaps he isn't."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Master Clutterbuck?" asked Ursula Quekett,
for she knew the old man liked to explain his wise saws, and as she
wanted to marry his son, she indulged him whenever she could. "What
do you mean? He isn't what?"</p>

<p>"He isn't&mdash;that's all," explained Clutterbuck with vague
solemnity.</p>

<p>Then, seeing that he had gained the attention of the little
party round him, he condescended to come to more logical
phraseology.</p>

<p>"I mean, that perhaps we must not ask'Who <i>is</i> this
mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel?' but'Who <i>was</i> that poor and
unfortunate gentleman?' "</p>

<p>"Then you think&mdash;" suggested Mistress Polly, who felt
unaccountably low-spirited at this oratorical pronouncement.</p>

<p>"I have it for a fact," said Mr. Clutterbuck solemnly, "that he
whom they call the Scarlet Pimpernel no longer exists now; that he
was collared by the Frenchies, as far back as last fall, and, in
the language of the poets, has never been heard of no more."</p>

<p>Mr. Clutterbuck was very fond of quoting from the works of
certain writers whose names he never mentioned, but who went by the
poetical generality of "the poets." Whenever he made use of phrases
which he was supposed to derive from these great and un-named
authors, he solemnly and mechanically raised his hat, as a tribute
of respect to these giant minds.</p>

<p>"You think that the Scarlet Pimpernel is dead, Mr. Clutterbuck?
That those horrible Frenchies murdered him? Surely you don't mean
that?" sighed Mistress Polly ruefully.</p>

<p>Mr. Clutterbuck put his hand up to his hat, preparatory, no
doubt, to making another appeal to the mysterious poets, but was
interrupted in the very act of uttering great thoughts by a loud
and prolonged laugh, which came echoing from a distant corner of
the grounds.</p>

<p>"Lud! But I'd know that laugh anywhere," said Mistress Quekett,
whilst all eyes were turned in the direction whence the merry noise
had come.</p>

<p>Half a head taller than any of his friends around him, his lazy
blue eyes scanning from beneath their drooping lids the motley
throng around him, stood Sir Percy Blakeney, the centre of a
gaily-dressed little group which seemingly had just crossed the
toll-gate.</p>

<p>"A fine specimen of a man, for sure," remarked Johnny Cullen,
the apprentice.</p>

<p>"Aye! You may take your Bible oath on that!" sighed Mistress
Polly, who was inclined to be sentimental.</p>

<p>"Speakin' as the poets," pronounced Mr. Clutterbuck
sententiously, "inches don't make a man."</p>

<p>"Nor fine clothes neither," added Master Jezzard, who did not
approve of Mistress Polly's sentimental sigh.</p>

<p>"There's my lady!" gasped Miss Barbara suddenly clutching Master
Clutterbuck's arm vigorously. "Lud! But she is beautiful
today!"</p>

<p>Beautiful indeed, and radiant with youth and happiness,
Marguerite Blakeney had just gone through the gates and was walking
along the sward towards the bandstands. She was dressed in clinging
robes of shimmery green texture, the new-fashioned, high-waisted
effect suiting her graceful figure to perfection. The large
Charlotte, made of velvet to match the gown, cast a deep shadow
over the upper part of her face, and gave a peculiar softness to
the outline of her forehead and cheeks.</p>

<p>Long lace mittens covered her arms and hands, and a scarf of
diaphanous material, edged with dull gold, hung loosely around her
shoulders.</p>

<p>Yes! She was beautiful! No captious chronicler has ever denied
that! And no one who knew her before, and who saw her again on this
late summer's afternoon, could fail to mark the additional charm of
her magnetic personality. There was a tenderness in her face as she
turned her head to and fro, a joy of living in her eyes that was
quite irresistibly fascinating.</p>

<p>Just now she was talking animatedly with the young girl who was
walking beside her, and laughing merrily the while:</p>

<p>"Nay! We'll find your Paul, never fear! Lud! Child, have you
forgotten he is in England now, and that there's no fear of his
being kidnapped here on the green in broad daylight?"</p>

<p>The young girl gave a slight shudder, and her child-like face
became a shade paler than before. Marguerite took her hand and gave
it a kindly pressure. Juliette Marny, but lately come to England,
saved from under the very knife of the guillotine by a timely and
daring rescue, could scarcely believe as yet that she and the man
she loved were really out of danger.</p>

<p>"There is Monsieur D&eacute;roulede," said Marguerite after a
slight pause, giving the young girl time to recover herself and
pointing to a group of men close by. "He is among friends, as you
see."</p>

<p>They made such a pretty picture, these two women, as they stood
together for a moment on the green, with the brilliant September
sun throwing golden reflections and luminous shadows on their
slender forms. Marguerite, tall and queen-like in her rich gown,
and costly jewels, wearing with glorious pride the invisible crown
of happy wifehood; Juliette, slim and girlish, dressed all in
white, with a soft, straw hat on her fair curls, and bearing on an
otherwise young and childlike face the hard imprint of the terrible
sufferings she had undergone, of the deathly moral battle her
tender soul had had to fight.</p>

<p>Soon a group of friends joined them. Paul D&eacute;roulede among
these, also Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lady Ffoulkes, and, strolling
slowly towards them, his hands buried in the pockets of his fine
cloth breeches, his broad shoulders set to advantage in a coat of
immaculate cut, priceless lace ruffles at neck and wrist, came the
inimitable Sir Percy.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5" id="Chapter5"></a>Chapter
5<br>
Sir Percy and His Lady</b>
</h2>

<p>To all appearances he had not changed since those early days of
matrimony when his young wife dazzled London society by her wit and
by her beauty, and he was one of the many satellites that helped to
bring into bold relief the brilliance of her presence, of her
sallies, and of her smiles.</p>

<p>His friends alone, mayhap &mdash;and of these only an intimate
few&mdash;had understood that beneath that self-same lazy manner,
those shy and awkward ways, that half-inane, half-cynical laugh,
there now lurked an undercurrent of tender and passionate
happiness.</p>

<p>That Lady Blakeney was in love with her own husband nobody could
fail to see, and in the more frivolous cliques of fashionable
London, this extraordinary phenomenon had oft been eagerly
discussed.</p>

<p>"A monstrous thing, of a truth, for a woman of fashion to adore
her own husband!" was the universal pronouncement of the
gaily-decked little world that centered around Carlton House and
Ranelagh.</p>

<p>Not that Sir Percy Blakeney was unpopular with the fair sex. Far
be it from the veracious chronicler's mind even to suggest such a
thing. The ladies would have voted any gathering dull if Sir
Percy's witty sallies did not ring from end to end of the dancing
hall, if his new satin coat and broidered waistcoat did not call
for comment or admiration.</p>

<p>But that was the frivolous set, to which Lady Blakeney had never
belonged.</p>

<p>It was well-known that she had always viewed her good-natured
husband as the most willing and most natural butt for her caustic
wit; she still was fond of aiming a shaft or two at him, and he was
still equally ready to let the shaft glance harmlessly against the
flawless shield of his own imperturbable good humour; but now,
contrary to all precedent, to all usages and customs of London
society, Marguerite seldom was seen at routs or at the opera
without her husband; she accompanied him to all the races, and even
one night &mdash;oh, horror!&mdash;had danced the gavotte with
him.</p>

<p>Society shuddered and wondered! &mdash;tried to put Lady
Blakeney's sudden infatuation down to foreign eccentricity, and
finally consoled itself with the thought that, after all, this
nonsense could not last, and that she was too clever a woman and he
too perfect a gentleman to keep up this abnormal state of things
for any length of time.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the ladies averred that this matrimonial love
was a very one-sided affair. No one could assert that Sir Percy was
anything but politely indifferent to his wife's obvious attentions.
His lazy eyes never once lighted up when she entered a ballroom,
and there were those who knew for a fact that her ladyship spent
many lonely days in her beautiful home at Richmond, whilst her lord
and master absented himself with persistent if unchivalrous
regularity.</p>

<p>His presence at the Gala had been a surprise to everyone, for
all thought him away fishing in Scotland or shooting in Yorkshire,
anywhere save close to the apron-strings of his doting wife. He
himself seemed conscious of the fact that he had not been expected
at this end-of-summer f&ecirc;te, for as he strolled forward to
meet his wife and Juliette Marny, and acknowledged with a bow here
and a nod there the many greetings from subordinates and friends,
there was quite an apologetic air about his good-looking face, and
an obvious shyness in his smile.</p>

<p>But Marguerite gave a happy little laugh when she saw him coming
towards her:</p>

<p>"Oh, Sir Percy!" she said gaily, "and pray have you seen the
show? I vow 'tis the maddest, merriest throng I've seen for many a
day. Nay! But for the sighs and shudders of my poor little
Juliette, I should be enjoying one of the liveliest days of my
life."</p>

<p>She patted Juliette's arm affectionately.</p>

<p>"Do not shame me before Sir Percy," murmured the young girl,
casting shy glances at the elegant cavalier before her, vainly
trying to find in the indolent, foppish personality of this society
butterfly some trace of the daring man of action, the bold
adventurer who had snatched her and her lover from out the very
tumbril that bore them both to death.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I ought to be gay,&#8221; she continued, with an
attempt at a smile; &#8220;I ought to forget everything, save what
I owe to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Percy's laugh broke in on her half-finished sentence.</p>

<p>"Lud! And to think of all that I ought not to forget!" he said
loudly. "Tony here has been clamouring for iced punch this last
half-hour, and I promised to find a booth wherein the noble liquid
is properly dispensed. Within half an hour from now His Royal
Highness will be here. I assure you, Mlle. Juliette, that from that
time onwards I have to endure the qualms of the damned, for the
heir to Great Britain's throne always contrives to be thirsty when
I am satiated, which is Tantalus' torture magnified a thousandfold,
or to be satiated when my parched palate most requires solace; in
either case I am a most pitiable man."</p>

<p>"In either case you contrive to talk a deal of nonsense, Sir
Percy," said Marguerite gaily.</p>

<p>"What else would your ladyship have me do this lazy, hot
afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Come and view the booths with me," she said. "I am dying for
the sight of the fat woman and the lean man, the pig-faced child,
the dwarfs, and the giants. There! Monsieur D&eacute;roulede," she
added, turning to the young Frenchman who was standing close beside
her, "take Mlle. Juliette to hear the clavecin players. I vow she
is tired of my company."</p>

<p>The gaily-dressed group was breaking up. Juliette and Paul
D&eacute;roulede were only too ready to stroll off arm-in-arm
together, and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes was ever in attendance on his
young wife.</p>

<p>For one moment Marguerite caught her husband's eye. No one was
within earshot.</p>

<p>"Percy," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, m'dear?"</p>

<p>"When did you return?"</p>

<p>"Early this morning."</p>

<p>"You crossed over from Calais?"</p>

<p>"From Boulogne."</p>

<p>"Why did you not let me know sooner?"</p>

<p>"I could not, dear. I arrived at my lodgings in town looking a
disgusting object. I could not appear before you until I had washed
some of the French mud from off my person. Then His Royal Highness
demanded my presence. He wanted news of the Duchesse de Verneuil,
whom I had the honour of escorting over from France. By the time I
had told him all that he wished to hear, there was no chance of
finding you at home, and I thought I should see you here."</p>

<p>Marguerite said nothing for a moment, but her foot impatiently
tapped the ground, and her fingers were fidgeting with the gold
fringe of her scarf. The look of joy, of exquisite happiness,
seemed to have suddenly vanished from her face; there was a deep
furrow between her brows.</p>

<p>She sighed a short, sharp sigh, and cast a rapid upward glance
at her husband.</p>

<p>"Percy," she said abruptly.</p>

<p>"Yes, m'dear."</p>

<p>"These anxieties are terrible to bear. You have been twice over
to France within the last month, dealing with your life as lightly
as if it did not now belong to me. When will you give up these mad
adventures, and leave others to fight their own battles and to save
their own lives as best they may?"</p>

<p>She had spoken with increased vehemence, although her voice was
scarce raised above a whisper. Even in her sudden, passionate
anger, she was on her guard not to betray his secret. He did not
reply immediately, but seemed to be studying the beautiful face on
which heart-broken anxiety was now distinctly imprinted.</p>

<p>Then he turned and looked at the solitary booth in the distance,
across the frontal of which a large placard had been recently
affixed, bearing the words! "Come and see the true representation
of the guillotine!"</p>

<p>In front of the booth a man, dressed in ragged breeches, with
Phrygian cap on his head, adorned with a tricolour cockade, was
vigorously beating a drum, shouting volubly the while:</p>

<p>"Come in and see, come in and see! The only realistic
presentation of the original guillotine. Hundreds perish in Paris
every day! Come and see! Come and see! The perfectly vivid
performance of what goes on hourly in Paris at the present
moment."</p>

<p>Marguerite had followed the direction of Sir Percy's eyes. She,
too, was looking at the booth; she heard the man's monotonous,
raucous cries. She gave a slight shudder and once more looked
imploringly at her husband. His face &mdash;though outwardly as
lazy and calm as before &mdash;had a strange, set look about the
mouth and firm jaw, and his slender hand, the hand of a dandy
accustomed to handle cards and dice and to play lightly with the
foils, was clutched tightly beneath the folds of the priceless
Mechlin frills.</p>

<p>It was but a momentary stiffening of the whole, powerful frame,
an instant's flash of the ruling passion hidden within that very
secretive soul. Then he once more turned towards her, the rigid
lines of his face relaxed, he broke into a pleasant laugh, and with
the most elaborate and most courtly bow he took her hand in his
and, raising her fingers to his lips, he gave the answer to her
question:</p>

<p>"When your ladyship has ceased to be the most admired woman in
Europe&mdash;namely, when I am in my grave."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6" id="Chapter6"></a>Chapter
6<br>
For the Poor of Paris</b>
</h2>

<p>There was no time to say more then. For the laughing, chatting
groups of friends had once more closed up round Marguerite and her
husband, and she, ever on the alert, gave neither look nor sign
that any serious conversation had taken place between Sir Percy and
herself.</p>

<p>Whatever she might feel or dread with regard to the foolhardy
adventures in which he still persistently embarked, no member of
the League ever guarded the secret of his chief more loyally than
did Marguerite Blakeney.</p>

<p>Though her heart overflowed with a passionate pride in her
husband, she was clever enough to conceal every emotion save that
which Nature had insisted on imprinting on her face, her present
radiant happiness and her irresistible love. And thus before the
world she kept up that bantering way with him, which had
characterised her earlier matrimonial life, that good-natured, easy
contempt which he had so readily accepted in those days, and which
their entourage would have missed and would have enquired after, if
she had changed her manner towards him too suddenly.</p>

<p>In her heart she knew full well that within Percy Blakeney's
soul she had a great and powerful rival: his wild, mad, passionate
love of adventure. For it he would sacrifice everything, even his
life; she dared not ask herself if he would sacrifice his love.</p>

<p>Twice in a few weeks he had been over to France: every time he
went she could not know if she would ever see him again. She could
not imagine how the French Committee of Public Safety would so
clumsily allow the hated Scarlet Pimpernel to slip through its
fingers. But she never attempted either to warn him or to beg him
not to go. When he brought Paul D&eacute;roulede and Juliette Marny
over from France, her heart went out to these two young people in
sheer gladness and pride because of <i>his</i> precious life, which
<i>he</i> had risked for them.</p>

<p>She loved Juliette for the dangers Percy had passed, for the
anxieties she herself had endured; only today, in the midst of this
beautiful sunshine, this joy of the earth, of summer and of the
sky, she had suddenly felt a mad, overpowering anxiety, a deadly
hatred of the wild adventurous life, which took him so often away
from her side. His pleasant, bantering reply precluded her
following up the subject, whist the merry chatter of people round
her warned her to keep her words and looks under control.</p>

<p>But she seemed now to feel the want of being alone, and,
somehow, that distant booth with its flaring placard, and the crier
in the Phrygian cap, exercised a weird fascination over her.</p>

<p>Instinctively she bent her steps thither, and equally
instinctively the idle throng of her friends followed her. Sir
Percy alone had halted in order to converse with Lord Hastings who
had just arrived.</p>

<p>"Surely, Lady Blakeney, you have no thought of patronising that
gruesome spectacle?" said Lord Anthony Dewhurst, as Marguerite
almost mechanically had paused within a few yards of the solitary
booth.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, with enforced gaiety, "the place seems
to attract me. And I need not look at the spectacle," she said
significantly, as she pointed to a roughly-scribbled notice at the
entrance of the tent: "In aid of the starving poor of Paris."</p>

<p>"There's a good-looking woman who sings, and a hideous
mechanical toy that moves," said one of the young men in the crowd.
"It is very dark and close inside the tent. I was lured in there
for my sins, and was in a mighty hurry to come out again."</p>

<p>"Then it must be my sins that are helping to lure me, too, at
the present moment," said Marguerite lightly. "I pray you all to
let me go in there. I want to hear the good-looking woman sing,
even if I do not see the hideous toy on the move."</p>

<p>"May I escort you then, Lady Blakeney?" said Lord Tony.</p>

<p>"Nay! I would rather go in alone," she replied a trifle
impatiently. "I beg of you not to heed my whim, and to await my
return, there, where the music is at its merriest."</p>

<p>It had been bad manners to insist. Marguerite, with a little
comprehensive nod to all her friends, left the young cavaliers
still protesting, and quickly passed beneath the
roughly-constructed doorway that gave access into the booth.</p>

<p>A man, dressed in theatrical rags and wearing the characteristic
scarlet cap, stood immediately within the entrance, and
ostentatiously rattled a money-box at regular intervals.</p>

<p>"For the starving poor of Paris," he drawled out in nasal,
monotonous tones the moment he caught sight of Marguerite and of
her rich gown. She dropped some gold into the box and then passed
on.</p>

<p>The interior of the booth was dark and lonely-looking after the
glare of the hot September sun and the noisy crowd that thronged
the sward outside. Evidently a performance had just taken place on
the elevated platform beyond, for a few yokels seemed to be
lingering in a desultory manner as if preparatory to going out.</p>

<p>A few disjointed comments reached Marguerite's ears as she
approached, and the small groups parted to allow her to pass. One
or two women gaped in astonishment at her beautiful dress, whilst
others bobbed a respectful curtsey.</p>

<p>The mechanical toy arrested her attention immediately. She did
not find it as gruesome as she expected, only singularly grotesque,
with all those wooden little figures in their quaint, arrested
action.</p>

<p>She drew nearer to have a better look, and the yokels who had
lingered behind, paused, wondering if she would make any
remark.</p>

<p>"Her ladyship was born in France," murmured one of the men close
to her; "she would know if the thing really looks like that."</p>

<p>"She do seem interested," quoth another in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Lud love us all!" said a buxom wench, who was clinging to the
arm of a nervous-looking youth, "I believe they're coming for more
money."</p>

<p>On the elevated platform at the further end of the tent, a slim
figure had just made its appearance, that of a young woman dressed
in peculiarly sombre colours, and with a black lace hood thrown
lightly over her head.</p>

<p>Marguerite thought that the face seemed familiar to her, she
also noticed that the woman carried a large embroidered reticule,
in her be-mittened hand.</p>

<p>There was a general exodus the moment she appeared. The Richmond
yokels did not like the look of that reticule. They felt that
sufficient demand had already been made upon their scant purses,
considering the meagreness of the entertainment, and they dreaded
being lured to further extravagance.</p>

<p>When Marguerite turned away from the mechanical toy, the last of
the little crowd had disappeared, and she was alone in the booth
with the woman in the dark kirtle and black lace hood.</p>

<p>"For the poor of Paris, madame," said the latter mechanically,
holding out her reticule.</p>

<p>Marguerite was looking at her intently. The face certainly
seemed familiar, recalling to her mind the far-off days in Paris,
before she married. Some young actress no doubt driven out of
France by that terrible turmoil which had caused so much sorrow and
so much suffering. The face was pretty, the figure slim and
elegant, and the look of obvious sadness in the dark, almond-shaped
eyes was calculated to inspire sympathy and pity.</p>

<p>Yet strangely enough Lady Blakeney felt repelled and chilled by
this sombrely-dressed young person: an instinct, which she could
not have explained and which she felt had no justification, warned
her that somehow or other the sadness was not quite genuine, the
appeal for the poor not quite heartfelt.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she took out her purse, and dropped some few
sovereigns into the capacious reticule; then she said very
kindly:</p>

<p>"I hope that you are satisfied with your day's work, madame; I
fear me our British country folk hold the strings of their purses
somewhat tightly these times."</p>

<p>The woman sighed and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, madame!" she said with a tone of great dejection, "one does
what one can for one's starving countrymen, but it is very hard to
elicit sympathy over here for them, poor dears!"</p>

<p>"You are a Frenchwoman, of course," rejoined Marguerite, who had
noted that though the woman spoke English with a very pronounced
foreign accent, she had nevertheless expressed herself with
wonderful fluency and correctness.</p>

<p>"Just like Lady Blakeney herself," replied the other.</p>

<p>"You know who I am?"</p>

<p>"Who could come to Richmond and not know Lady Blakeney by
sight?"</p>

<p>"But what made you come to Richmond on this philanthropic errand
of yours?"</p>

<p>"I go where I think there is a chance of earning a little money,
for the cause which I have at heart," replied the Frenchwoman with
the same gentle simplicity, the same tone of mournful
dejection.</p>

<p>What she said was undoubtedly noble and selfless. Lady Blakeney
felt in her heart that her keenest sympathy should have gone out to
this young woman&mdash;pretty, dainty, hardly more than a
girl&mdash;who seemed to be devoting her young life to a purely
philanthropic and unselfish cause. And yet in spite of herself,
Marguerite seemed unable to shake off that curious sense of
mistrust which had assailed her from the first, nor that feeling of
unreality and stageiness with which the Frenchwoman's attitude had
originally struck her.</p>

<p>Yet she tried to be kind and to be cordial, tried to hide that
coldness in her manner which she felt was unjustified.</p>

<p>"It is all very praiseworthy on your part, madame," she said,
somewhat lamely. "Madame...?" she added interrogatively.</p>

<p>"My name is Candeille&mdash;D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille,"
replied the Frenchwoman.</p>

<p>"Candeille?" exclaimed Marguerite with sudden alacrity,
"Candeille...? surely..."</p>

<p>"Yes...of the Veri&eacute;t&eacute;s."</p>

<p>"Ah! then I know why your face from the first seemed familiar to
me," said Marguerite, this time with unaffected cordiality. "I must
have applauded you many a time in the olden days. I am an
ex-colleague, you know. My name was St. Just before I married, and
I was of the Maison Moli&eacute;re."</p>

<p>"I knew that," said D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille, "and half
hoped that you would remember me."</p>

<p>"Nay! who forget Demoiselle Candeille, the most popular star in
the theatrical firmament?"</p>

<p>"Oh! that was so long ago."</p>

<p>"Only four years."</p>

<p>"A fallen star is soon lost out of sight."</p>

<p>"Why fallen?"</p>

<p>"It was a choice for me between exile from France and the
guillotine," rejoined Candeille simply.</p>

<p>"Surely not?" queried Marguerite with a touch of genuine
sympathy. With characteristic impulsiveness she had now cast aside
her former misgivings: she had conquered her mistrust, at any rate
had relegated it to the background of her mind. This woman was a
colleague: she had suffered and was in distress, she had every
claim therefore on a compatriot's help and friendship. She
stretched out her hand and took D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille's
in her own; she forced herself to feel nothing but admiration for
this young woman, whose whole attitude spoke of sorrows nobly
borne, of misfortunes proudly endured.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I should sadden you with my story," rejoined
D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille, after a slight pause, during which
she seemed to be waging war against her own emotion. "It is not a
very interesting one. Hundreds have suffered as I did. I had
enemies in Paris. God knows how that happened. I had never harmed
any one, but some one must have hated me and must have wished me
ill. Evil is so easily wrought in France these days. A
denunciation&mdash;a perquisition&mdash;an accusation. Then the
flight from Paris...the forged passports...the disguise...the
bribe...the hardships...the squalid hiding-places. Oh! I have gone
through it all...tasted every kind of humiliation...endured every
kind of insult...Remember! that I was not a noble aristocrat...a
Duchess or an impoverished Countess..." she added with marked
bitterness, "or perhaps the English cavaliers whom the popular
voice has called the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel would have
taken some interest in me. I was only a poor actress, and had to
find my own way out of France alone, or else perish on the
guillotine."</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," said Marguerite, simply.</p>

<p>"Tell me how you got on, once you were in England," she
continued, after a while, seeing that D&eacute;sir&eacute;e
Candeille seemed absorbed in thought.</p>

<p>"I had a few engagements at first," replied the Frenchwoman. "I
played at Sadler's Wells and with Mrs. Jordan at Covent Garden, but
the Aliens' Bill put an end to my chances of livelihood. No manager
cared to give me a part, and so..."</p>

<p>"And so?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I had a few jewels, and I sold them...A little money, and I
live on that...But when I played at Covent Garden I contrived to
send part of my salary over to some of the poorer clubs of Paris.
My heart aches for those that are starving...Poor wretches, they
are misguided and misled by self-seeking demagogues...It hurts me
to feel that I can do nothing more to help them...and eases my
self-respect if, by singing at public fairs, I can still send a few
francs to those who are poorer than myself."</p>

<p>She had spoken with ever-increasing passion and vehemence.
Marguerite, with eyes fixed into vacancy, seeing neither the
speaker nor her surroundings, seeing only visions of those same
poor wreckages of humanity, who had been goaded into thirst for
blood, when their shrunken bodies should have been clamouring for
healthy food, Marguerite thus absorbed had totally forgotten her
earlier prejudices, and now completely failed to note all that was
unreal, stagey, theatrical, in the oratorical declamations of the
ex-actress from the Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s.</p>

<p>Pre-eminently true and loyal herself, in spite of the many
deceptions and treacheries which she had witnessed in her life, she
never looked for falsehood or for cant in others. Even now she only
saw before her a woman who had been wrongfully persecuted, who had
suffered and had forgiven those who had caused her to suffer. She
bitterly upbraided herself for her original mistrust of this
noble-hearted, unselfish woman, who was content to tramp around in
an alien country, bartering her talents for a few coins, in order
that some of those, who were the originators of her sorrows, might
have bread to eat and a bed in which to sleep.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," she said warmly, "truly you shame me, who am
also French born, with the many sacrifices you so nobly make for
those who should have first claim on my sympathy. Believe me, if I
have not done as much as duty demanded of me in the cause of my
starving compatriots, it has not been for lack of good-will. Is
there any way now," she added eagerly, "in which I can help you?
Putting aside the question of money, wherein I pray you to command
my assistance, what can I do to be of useful service to you?"</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Lady Blakeney" said the other
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Well? What is it? I see there is something in your mind..."</p>

<p>"It is perhaps difficult to express...but people say I have a
good voice...I sing some French ditties...they are a novelty in
England I think...If I could sing them in fashionable salons...I
might perhaps..."</p>

<p>"Nay! you shall sing in fashionable salons," exclaimed
Marguerite eagerly; "you shall become the fashion, and I'll swear
the Prince of Wales himself shall bid you sing at Carlton
House...and you shall name your own fee, Mademoiselle...and London
society shall vie with the &eacute;lite of Bath, as to which shall
lure you to its most frequented routs...There! there! you shall
make a fortune for the Paris poor...and to prove to you that I mean
every word I say, you shall begin your triumphant career in my own
salon to-morrow night. His Royal Highness will be present. You
shall sing your most engaging songs...and for your fee you must
accept a hundred guineas, which you shall send to the poorest
workmen's club in Paris in the name of Sir Percy and Lady
Blakeney."</p>

<p>"I thank your ladyship, but..."</p>

<p>"You'll not refuse?"</p>

<p>"I'll accept gladly...but...you will understand...I am not very
old," said Candeille, quaintly. "I...I am only an actress but if a
young actress is unprotected...then..."</p>

<p>"I understand," replied Marguerite gently, "that you are far too
pretty to frequent the world all alone, and that you have a mother,
a sister, or a friend...which?...whom you would wish to escort you
to-morrow. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"Nay," rejoined the actress, with marked bitterness, "I have
neither mother, nor sister, but our revolutionary government, with
tardy compassion for those it has so relentlessly driven out of
France, has deputed a representative of theirs in England to look
after the interests of French subjects over here."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"They have realised over in Paris that my life here has been
devoted to the welfare of the poor people in France. The
representative whom the Government has sent to England is specially
interested in me and in my work. He is a stand-by for me in case of
trouble...in case of insults...A woman alone is oft subject to
those, even at the hands of so-called gentlemen...and the official
representative of my own country becomes in such cases my most
natural protector."</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"You will receive him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Then may I present him to your ladyship?"</p>

<p>"Whenever you like."</p>

<p>"Now, an it please you."</p>

<p>"Now?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Here he comes, at your ladyship's service."</p>

<p>D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille's almond-shaped eyes were fixed
upon a distant part of the tent, behind Lady Blakeney, in the
direction of the main entrance to the booth. There was a slight
pause after she had spoken, and then Marguerite slowly turned in
order to see who the official representative of France was, whom,
at the young actress's request, she had just agreed to receive in
her house.</p>

<p>In the doorway of the tent, framed by its gaudy draperies, and
with the streaming sunshine as a brilliant background behind him,
stood the sable-clad figure of Chauvelin.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7" id="Chapter7"></a>Chapter
7<br>
Premonition</b>
</h2>

<p>Marguerite neither moved nor spoke. She felt two pairs of eyes
fixed upon her, and with all the strength of will at her command
she forced the very blood in her veins not to quit her cheeks,
forced her eyelids not to betray by a single quiver the icy pang of
a deadly premonition which at sight of Chauvelin seemed to have
chilled her entire soul.</p>

<p>There he stood before her, dressed in his usual sombre garments,
a look almost of humility in those keen grey eyes of his, which a
year ago on the cliffs of Calais had peered down at her with such
relentless hate.</p>

<p>Strange that at this moment she should have felt an instinct of
fear. What cause had she to throw more than a pitiful glance at the
man who had tried so cruelly to wrong her and who had so signally
failed?</p>

<p>Having bowed very low and very respectfully, Chauvelin advanced
towards her, with all the airs of a disgraced courtier craving
audience from his queen.</p>

<p>As he approached she instinctively drew back.</p>

<p>"Would you prefer not to speak to me, Lady Blakeney?" he said
humbly.</p>

<p>She could scarcely believe her ears, or trust her eyes. It
seemed impossible that a man could have so changed in a few months.
He even looked shorter than last year, more shrunken within
himself. His hair, which he wore free from powder, was perceptibly
tinged with grey.</p>

<p>"Shall I withdraw?" he added after a pause, seeing that
Marguerite made no movement to return his salutation.</p>

<p>"It would be best, perhaps," she replied coldly. "You and I,
Monsieur Chauvelin, have so little to say to one another."</p>

<p>"Very little indeed," he rejoined quietly. "The triumphant and
happy have ever very little to say to the humiliated and the
defeated. But I had hoped that Lady Blakeney, in the midst of her
victory, would have spared one thought of pity and one of
pardon."</p>

<p>"I did not know that you had need of either from me,
Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Pity, perhaps not; but forgiveness, certainly."</p>

<p>"You have that, if you so desire it."</p>

<p>"Since I failed, you might try to forget."</p>

<p>"That is beyond my power. But, believe me, I have ceased to
think of the infinite wrong which you tried to do to me."</p>

<p>"But I failed," he insisted, "and I meant no harm to
<i>you."</i></p>

<p>"To those I care for, Monsieur Chauvelin."</p>

<p>"I had to serve my country as best as I could. I meant no harm
to your brother. He is safe in England now. And the Scarlet
Pimpernel was nothing to you."</p>

<p>She tried to read his face, tried to discover in those
inscrutable eyes of his some hidden meaning to his words. Instinct
had warned her, of course, that this man could be nothing but an
enemy, always and at all times. But he seemed so broken, so abject
now, that contempt for his dejected attitude, and for the defeat
which had been inflicted on him, chased the last remnant of fear
from her heart.</p>

<p>"I did not even succeed in harming that enigmatical personage,"
continued Chauvelin with the same self-abasement. "Sir Percy
Blakeney, you remember, threw himself across my plans&mdash;quite
innocently, of course. I failed where you succeeded. Luck has
deserted me. Our Government offered me a humble post, away from
France. I look after the interests of French subjects settled in
England. My days of power are over. My failure is complete. I do
not complain, for I failed in a combat of wits...but I failed...I
failed...I failed...I am almost a fugitive and I am quite
disgraced. That is my present history, Lady Blakeney," he
concluded, taking once more a step towards her; "and you will
understand that it would be a solace if you extended your hand to
me just once more, and let me feel that although you would never
willingly look upon my face again, you have enough womanly
tenderness in you to force your heart to forgiveness, and mayhap to
pity."</p>

<p>Marguerite hesitated. He held out his hand, and her warm,
impulsive nature prompted her to be kind. But instinct would not be
gainsaid: a curious instinct to which she refused to respond. What
had she to fear from this miserable and cringing little worm, who
had not even in him the pride of defeat? What harm could he do to
her, or to those whom she loved? Her brother was in England! Her
husband!! Bah! not the enmity of the entire world could make her
fear for <i>him!</i></p>

<p>Nay! That instinct, which caused her to draw away from
Chauvelin, as she would from a venomous asp, was certainly not
fear. It was hate! She hated this man!&mdash;hated him for all that
she had suffered because of him; for that terrible night on the
cliffs of Calais! the peril to her husband who had become so
infinitely dear! the humiliations and self-reproaches which she had
endured.</p>

<p>Yes! It was hate! And hate was of all emotions the one she most
despised.</p>

<p>Hate? Does one hate a slimy but harmless toad, or a stinging
fly? It seemed ridiculous, contemptible, and pitiable to think of
hate in connection with that melancholy figure of this discomfited
intriguer, this fallen leader of revolutionary France.</p>

<p>He was holding out his hand to her. If she placed even the tips
of her fingers upon it, she would be making the compact of mercy
and forgiveness which he was asking of her. The woman
D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille roused within her the last
lingering vestige of her slumbering wrath. False, theatrical, and
stagey&mdash;as Marguerite had originally suspected&mdash;she
appeared to have been in league with Chauvelin to bring about this
undesirable meeting.</p>

<p>Lady Blakeney turned from one to another, trying to conceal her
contempt beneath a mask of passionless indifference. Candeille was
standing close by, looking obviously distressed and not a little
puzzled. An instant's reflection was sufficient to convince
Marguerite that the whilom actress of the Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s
Theatre was obviously ignorant of the events to which Chauvelin had
been alluding; she was, therefore, of no serious
consequence&mdash;a mere tool, mayhap, in the ex-ambassador's
hands. At the present moment she looked like a silly child who does
not understand the conversation of the "grown-ups."</p>

<p>Marguerite had promised her help and protection, had invited her
to her house, and offered her a munificent gift in aid of a
deserving cause. She was too proud to go back now on that promise,
to rescind the contract because of an unexplainable fear. With
regard to Chauvelin the matter stood differently; she had made him
no direct offer of hospitality; she had agreed to receive in her
house the official chaperon of an unprotected girl, but she was not
called upon to show cordiality to her own and her husband's most
deadly enemy.</p>

<p>She was ready to dismiss him out of her life with a cursory word
of pardon and a half-expressed promise of oblivion; on that
understanding, and that only, she was ready to let her hand rest
for the space of one second in his.</p>

<p>She had looked upon her fallen enemy, seen his discomfiture and
his humiliation! Very well! Now let him pass out of her life, all
the more easily since the last vision of him would be one of such
utter abjection as would even be unworthy of hate.</p>

<p>All these thoughts, feelings and struggles passed through her
mind with great rapidity. Her hesitation had lasted less than five
seconds: Chauvelin still wore the look of doubting entreaty, with
which he had first begged permission to take her hand in his. With
an impulsive toss of the head, she had turned straight towards him,
ready with the phrase with which she meant to dismiss him from her
sight now and for ever, when suddenly a well-known laugh broke in
upon her ear, and a lazy, drawly voice said pleasantly:</p>

<p>"La! I vow the air is fit to poison you! Your Royal Highness, I
entreat, let us turn our backs upon these gates of Inferno, where
lost souls would feel more at home than doth your humble
servant."</p>

<p>The next moment His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales had
entered the tent, closely followed by Sir Percy Blakeney.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8" id="Chapter8"></a>Chapter
8<br>
The Invitation</b>
</h2>

<p>It was in truth a strange situation, this chance meeting between
Percy Blakeney and ex-Ambassador Chauvelin.</p>

<p>Marguerite looked up at her husband. She saw him shrug his broad
shoulders as he first caught sight of Chauvelin and glance down in
his usual lazy, good-humoured manner at the shrunken figure of the
silent Frenchman. The words she meant to say never crossed her
lips; she was waiting to hear what the two men would say to one
another.</p>

<p>The instinct of the grande dame in her, the fashionable lady
accustomed to the exigencies of society, just gave her sufficient
presence of mind to make the requisite low curtsey before His Royal
Highness. But the Prince, forgetting his accustomed gallantry, was
also absorbed in this little scene before him. He, too, was looking
from the sable-clad figure of Chauvelin to that of gorgeously
arrayed Sir Percy. He, too, like Marguerite, was wondering what was
passing behind the low, smooth forehead of that inimitable dandy,
what behind the inscrutably good-humoured expression of those
sleepy eyes.</p>

<p>Of the five persons thus present in the dark and stuffy booth,
certainly Sir Percy Blakeney seemed the least perturbed. He had
paused just long enough to allow Chauvelin to become fully
conscious of a feeling of supreme irritation and annoyance, then he
strolled up to the ex-ambassador, with hand outstretched and the
most engaging of smiles.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he said, with his half shy, half pleasant-tempered smile,
"my engaging friend from France! I hope, sir, that our demmed
climate doth find you well and hearty to-day."</p>

<p>The cheerful voice seemed to ease the tension. Marguerite sighed
a sigh of relief. After all, what was more natural than that Percy,
with his amazing fund of pleasant irresponsibility, should thus
greet the man who had once vowed to bring him to the guillotine?
Chauvelin himself, accustomed by now to the audacious coolness of
his enemy, was scarcely taken by surprise. He bowed low to His
Highness, who, vastly amused at Blakeney's sally, was inclined to
be gracious to everyone, even though the personality of Chauvelin,
as a well-known leader of a regicide government, was inherently
distasteful to him. But the Prince saw in the wizened little figure
before him an obvious butt for his friend Blakeney's impertinent
shafts, and although historians have been unable to assert
positively whether or no George Prince of Wales knew aught of Sir
Percy's dual life, yet there is no doubt that he was always ready
to enjoy a situation which brought about the discomfiture of any of
the Scarlet Pimpernel's avowed enemies.</p>

<p>"I, too, have not met M. Chauvelin for many a long month," said
His Royal Highness with an obvious show of irony. "An I mistake
not, sir, you left my father's Court somewhat abruptly last
year?"</p>

<p>"Nay, your Royal Highness," said Sir Percy, gaily, "my friend
Monsieur...er...Chaubertin and I had serious business to discuss,
which could only be dealt with in France...Am I not right,
Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Quite right, Sir Percy," replied Chauvelin curtly.</p>

<p>"We had to discuss the abominable soup in Calais, had we not?"
continued Blakeney in the same tone of easy banter, "and wine that
I vowed was vinegar. Monsieur...er...Chaubertin...no, no, I beg
pardon...Chauvelin...Monsieur Chauvelin and I quite agreed upon
that point. The only matter on which we were not quite at one was
the question of snuff."</p>

<p>"Snuff?" laughed His Royal Highness, who seemed vastly
amused.</p>

<p>"Yes, your Royal Highness...snuff...Monsieur Chauvelin here
has&mdash;if I may be allowed to say so&mdash;so vitiated a taste
in snuff that he prefers it with an admixture of pepper...Is that
not so, Monsieur...er...Chaubertin?"</p>

<p>"Chauvelin, Sir Percy," remarked the ex-ambassador drily.</p>

<p>He was determined not to lose his temper, and looked urbane and
pleasant, whilst his impudent enemy was enjoying a joke at his
expense. Marguerite the while had not taken her eyes off the keen,
shrewd face. Whilst the three men talked, she seemed suddenly to
have lost her sense of the reality of things. The present situation
appeared to her strangely familiar, like a dream which she had
dreamt ofttimes before.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became absolutely clear to her that the whole scene
had been arranged and planned: the booth with its flaring placard,
Demoiselle Candeille soliciting her patronage, her invitation to
the young actress, Chauvelin's sudden appearance&mdash;all, all had
been concocted and arranged, not here, not in England at all, but
out there in Paris, in some dark gathering of bloodthirsty
ruffians, who had invented a final trap for the destruction of the
bold adventurer, who went by the name of the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>And she also was only a puppet, enacting a part which had been
written for her: she had acted just as <i>they</i> had anticipated,
had spoken the very words they had meant her to say: and when she
looked at Percy he seemed supremely ignorant of it all, unconscious
of this trap, of the existence of which everyone here present was
aware save, indeed, himself. She would have fought against this
weird feeling of obsession, of being a mechanical toy wound up to
do certain things, but this she could not do; her will appeared
paralysed, her tongue even refused her service.</p>

<p>As in a dream, she heard His Royal Highness ask for the name of
the young actress, who was soliciting alms for the poor of
Paris.</p>

<p>That also had been pre-arranged. His Royal Highness for the
moment was also a puppet, made to dance, to speak, and to act as
Chauvelin and his colleagues over in France had decided that he
should. Quite mechanically Marguerite introduced Demoiselle
Candeille to the Prince's gracious notice.</p>

<p>"If your Highness will permit," she said, "Mademoiselle
Candeille will give us some of her charming old French songs at my
rout to-morrow."</p>

<p>"By all means! By all means!" said the Prince. "I used to know
some in my childhood's days. Charming and poetic...I know...I
know...We shall be delighted to hear Mademoiselle sing. Eh,
Blakeney?" he added good-humouredly, "and for your rout to-morrow,
will you not also invite M. Chauvelin?"</p>

<p>"Nay! but that goes without saying, your Royal Highness,"
responded Sir Percy, with hospitable alacrity and a most approved
bow directed at his arch-enemy. "We shall expect M. Chauvelin. He
and I have not met for so long, and he shall be made right welcome
at Blakeney Manor."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9" id="Chapter9"></a>Chapter
9<br>
Demoiselle Candeille</b>
</h2>

<p>Her origin was of the humbles, for her mother&mdash;so it was
said&mdash;had been kitchen-maid in the household of the Duc de
Marny, but D&eacute;sir&eacute;e had received some kind of
education, and though she began life as a dresser in one of the
minor theatres of Paris, she became ultimately one of its most
popular stars.</p>

<p>She was small and dark, dainty in her manner and her ways, and
with a graceful little figure, peculiarly supple and sinuous. Her
humble origin certainly did not betray itself in her hands and
feet, which were exquisite in shape and lilliputian in size.</p>

<p>Her hair was soft and glossy, always free from powder, and
cunningly arranged so as to slightly over-shadow the upper part of
the face.</p>

<p>The chin was small and round, the mouth extraordinarily red, the
neck slender and long. But she was not pretty: so said all the
women. Her skin was rather coarse in texture and darkish in colour,
her eyes were narrow and slightly turned upwards at the corners;
no! she was distinctly not pretty.</p>

<p>Yet she pleased the men! Perhaps because she was so artlessly
determined to please them. The women said that Demoiselle Candeille
never left a man alone until she had succeeded in captivating his
fancy, if only for five minutes; an interval in a dance...the time
to cross a muddy road.</p>

<p>But for five minutes she was determined to hold any man's
complete attention, and to exact his admiration. And she nearly
always succeeded.</p>

<p>Therefore the women hated her. The men were amused. It is
extremely pleasant to have one's admiration compelled, one's
attention so determinedly sought after.</p>

<p>And Candeille could be extremely amusing, and as Madelon in
Moli&egrave;re's "Les Pr&eacute;cieuses" was quite inimitable.</p>

<p>This, however, was in the olden days, just before Paris went
quite mad, before the Reign of Terror had set in, and ci-devant
Louis the King had been executed.</p>

<p>Candeille had taken it into her frolicsome little head that she
would like to go to London. The idea was, of course, in the nature
of an experiment. Those dull English people over the water knew so
little of what good acting really meant. Tragedy! Well! passons!
their heavy, large-boned actresses might manage one or two big
scenes, where a commanding presence and a powerful voice would not
come amiss, and where prominent teeth would pass unnoticed in the
agony of a dramatic climax.</p>

<p>But comedy!</p>

<p>Ah! &ccedil;a non, par example! Demoiselle Candeille had seen
several English gentlemen and ladies in those same olden days at
the Tuileries, but she really could not imagine any of them
enacting the piquant scenes of Moli&egrave;re or Beaumarchais.</p>

<p>Demoiselle Candeille thought of every Englishborn individual as
having very large teeth. Now large teeth do not lend themselves to
well-spoken comedy scenes, to smiles, or to double-entendre.</p>

<p>Her own teeth were exceptionally small and white, and very
sharp, like those of a kitten.</p>

<p>Yes! Demoiselle Candeille thought it would be extremely
interesting to go to London and to show to a nation of shopkeepers
how daintily one can be amused in a theatre.</p>

<p>Permission to depart from Paris was easy to obtain. In fact, the
fair lady had never really found it difficult to obtain anything
she very much wanted.</p>

<p>In this case, she had plenty of friends in high places. Marat
was still alive, and a great lover of the theatre. Tallien was a
personal admirer of hers, and Deputy Dupont would do anything she
asked.</p>

<p>She wanted to act in London, at a theatre called Drury Lane. She
wanted to play Moli&egrave;re in England in French, and had already
spoken with several of her colleagues, who were ready to join her.
They would give public representations in aid of the starving
population of France; there were plenty of Socialistic clubs in
London quite Jacobin and Revolutionary in tendency: their members
would give her full support.</p>

<p>She would be serving her country and her countrymen, and
incidentally see something of the world and amuse herself. She was
being bored in Paris.</p>

<p>Then she thought of Marguerite St. Just, once of the Maison
Moli&egrave;re, who had captivated an English milor' of enormous
wealth. Demoiselle Candeille had never been of the Maison
Moli&egrave;re; she had been the leading star at one of the
minor&mdash;yet much-frequented&mdash;theatres of Paris, but she
felt herself quite able and ready to captivate some other
unattached milor', who would load her with English money and
incidentally bestow an English name upon her.</p>

<p>So she went to London.</p>

<p>The experiment, however, had not proved an unmitigated success.
At first she and her company did obtain a few engagements at one or
two of the minor theatres, to give representations of some of the
French classical comedies in the original language.</p>

<p>But these never quite became the fashion. The feeling against
France and all her doings was far too keen in that very set which
Demoiselle Candeille had desired to captivate with her talents, to
allow the English <i>jeunesse dor&eacute;e</i> to flock and see
Moli&egrave;re being played in French by a French troupe, whilst
Candeille's own compatriots resident in England had given her but
scant support.</p>

<p>One section of these&mdash;the aristocrats and
&eacute;migr&eacute;s&mdash;looked upon the actress who was a
friend of all the Jacobins in Paris as nothing better than
<i>canaille.</i> They sedulously ignored her presence in this
country, and snubbed her whenever they had an opportunity.</p>

<p>The other section&mdash;chiefly consisting of agents and spies
of the Revolutionary Government&mdash;she would gladly have
ignored. They had at first made a constant demand on her purse, her
talents, and her time; then she grew tired of them, and felt more
and more chary of being identified with a set which was in such
ill-odour with that very same <i>jeunesse dor&eacute;e</i> whom
Candeille had desired to please.</p>

<p>In her own country she was, and always had been, a good
Republican: Marat had given her her first start in life by his
violent praises of her talent in his widely-circulated paper; she
had been associated in Paris with the whole coterie of artists and
actors: every one of them Republican to a man. But in London,
although one might be snubbed by the &eacute;migr&eacute;s and
aristocrats, it did not do to be mixed up with the sans-culotte
journalists and pamphleteers who haunted the Socialistic clubs of
the English capital, and who were the prime organisers of all those
seditious gatherings and treasonable unions that caused Mr. Pitt
and his colleagues so much trouble and anxiety.</p>

<p>One by one D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille's comrades, male and
female, who had accompanied her to England returned to their own
country. When war was declared, some of them were actually sent
back under the provisions of the Aliens Bill.</p>

<p>But D&eacute;sir&eacute;e had stayed on.</p>

<p>Her old friends in Paris had managed to advise her that she
would not be very welcome there just now. The sans-culotte
journalists of England, the agents and spies of the Revolutionary
Government, had taken their revenge of the frequent snubs inflicted
upon them by the young actress, and in those days the fact of being
unwelcome in France was apt to have a more lurid and more dangerous
significance.</p>

<p>Candeille did not dare return: at any rate, not for the
present.</p>

<p>She trusted to her own powers of intrigue, and her well-known
fascinations, to re-conquer the friendship of the Jacobin clique,
and she once more turned her attention to the affiliated
Socialistic clubs of England. But between the proverbial two stools
Demoiselle Candeille soon came to the ground. Her machinations
became known in official quarters, her connection with all the
seditious clubs in London was soon bruited abroad, and one evening
D&eacute;sir&eacute;e found herself confronted with a document
addressed to her: "From the Office of His Majesty's Privy Seal,"
wherein it was set forth that, pursuant to the Statute 33, George
III., cap. 5, she, D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille, a French
subject now resident in England, was required to leave this kingdom
by order of His Majesty within seven days, and that in the event of
the said D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille refusing to comply with
this order, she would be liable to commitment, brought to trial,
and sentenced to imprisonment for a month, and afterwards to
removal within a limited time under pain of transportation for
life.</p>

<p>This meant that Demoiselle Candeille had exactly seven days in
which to make complete her reconciliation with her former friends,
who now ruled Paris and France with a relentless and perpetually
blood-stained hand. No wonder that during the night which followed
the receipt of this momentous document, Demoiselle Candeille
suffered gravely from insomnia.</p>

<p>She dared not go back to France, she was ordered out of England!
What was to become of her?</p>

<p>This was just three days before the eventful afternoon of the
Richmond Gala, and twenty-four hours after ex-Ambassador Chauvelin
had landed in England. Candeille and Chauvelin had since then met
at the "Cercle des Jacobins Fran&ccedil;ais" in Soho Street, and
now fair D&eacute;sir&eacute;e found herself in lodgings in
Richmond, the evening of the day following the Gala, feeling that
her luck had not altogether deserted her.</p>

<p>One conversation with Citizen Chauvelin had brought the fickle
jade back to Demoiselle Candeille's service. Nay, more, the young
actress saw before her visions of intrigue, of dramatic situations,
of pleasant little bits of revenge&mdash;all of which was meat and
drink and air to breathe for Mademoiselle
D&eacute;sir&eacute;e.</p>

<p>She was to sing in one of the most fashionable salons of
England: that was very pleasant. The Prince of Wales would hear and
see her! That opened out a vista of delightful possibilities! And
all she had to do was to act a part dictated to her by Citizen
Chauvelin, to behave as he directed, to move in the way he wished!
Well! that was easy enough, since the part which she would have to
play was one peculiarly suited to her talents.</p>

<p>She looked at herself critically in the glass. Her maid
Fanchon&mdash;a little French waif picked up in the slums of
Soho&mdash;helped to re-adjust a stray curl which had rebelled
against the comb.</p>

<p>"Now for the necklace, Mademoiselle," said Fanchon, with
suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>It had just arrived by messenger: a large morocco case, which
now lay open on the dressing-table, displaying its dazzling
contents.</p>

<p>Candeille scarcely dared to touch it, and yet it was for her.
Citizen Chauvelin had sent a note with it.</p>

<p class="letter">Citizeness Candeille will please accept this gift
from the Government of France, in acknowledgment of useful services
past and to come.</p>

<p>The note was signed with Robespierre's own name, followed by
that of Citizen Chauvelin. The morocco case contained a necklace of
diamonds worth the ransom of a king.</p>

<p>"For useful services past and to come!" and there were promises
of still further rewards, a complete pardon for all defalcations, a
place within the charmed circle of the Com&eacute;die
Fran&ccedil;aise, a grand pageant and apotheosis, with Citizeness
Candeille impersonating the Goddess of Reason, in the midst of a
grand national f&ecirc;te, and the acclamations of excited Paris:
and all in exchange for the enactment of a part&mdash;simple and
easy&mdash;outlined for her by Chauvelin!...</p>

<p>How strange! How inexplicable! Candeille took the necklace up in
her trembling fingers and gazed musingly at the priceless gems. She
had seen the jewels before, long, long ago! round the neck of the
Duchesse de Marny, in whose service her own mother had been.
She&mdash;as a child&mdash;had often gazed at and admired the great
lady, who seemed like a wonderful fairy from an altogether
different world to that inhabited by the poor little kitchen
slut.</p>

<p>How wonderful are the vagaries of fortune! D&eacute;sir&eacute;e
Candeille, the kitchen-maid's daughter, now wearing her
ex-mistress's jewels. She supposed that these had been confiscated
when the last of the Marnys&mdash;the girl Juliette&mdash;had
escaped from France!&mdash;confiscated and now sent to her,
Candeille, as a reward or as a bribe!</p>

<p>In either case they were welcome. The actress's vanity was
soothed. She knew Juliette Marny was in England, and that she would
meet her to-night at Lady Blakeney's. After the many snubs which
she had endured from the French aristocrats settled in England, the
actress felt that she was about to enjoy an evening of triumph.</p>

<p>The intrigue excited her. She did not quite know what schemes
Chauvelin was aiming at, what ultimate end he had had in view when
he commanded her services and taught her the part which he wished
her to play.</p>

<p>That the schemes were vast and the end mighty she could not
doubt. The reward she had received was proof enough of that.</p>

<p>Little Fanchon stood there in speechless admiration whilst her
mistress still fondly fingered the magnificent necklace.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle will wear the diamonds to-night?" she asked with
evident anxiety: she would have been bitterly disappointed to have
seen the beautiful thing once more relegated to its dark morocco
case.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, Fanchon!" said Candeille, with a sigh of great
satisfaction. "See that they are fastened quite securely, my
girl."</p>

<p>She put the necklace round her shapely neck, and Fanchon looked
to see that the clasp was quite secure.</p>

<p>There came the sound of loud knocking at the street door.</p>

<p>"That is M. Chauvelin come to fetch me with the chaise. Am I
quite ready, Fanchon?" asked D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, Mademoiselle!" sighed the little maid; "and
Mademoiselle looks very beautiful to-night."</p>

<p>"Lady Blakeney is very beautiful, too, Fanchon," rejoined the
actress na&iuml;vely; "but I wonder if she will wear anything as
fine as the Marny necklace?"</p>

<p>The knocking at the street door was repeated. Candeille took a
final, satisfied survey of herself in the glass. She knew her part
and felt that she had dressed well for it. She gave a final,
affectionate little tap to the diamonds round her neck, took her
cloak and hood from Fanchon, and was ready to go.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10" id=

Lady Blakeney's Rout</b>
</h2>

<p>There are several accounts extant, in the fashionable chronicles
of the time, of the gorgeous reception given that autumn by Lady
Blakeney in her magnificent riverside home.</p>

<p>Never had the spacious apartments of Blakeney Manor looked more
resplendent than on this memorable occasion &mdash;memorable
because of the events which brought the brilliant evening to a
close.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales had come over by water from Carlton House;
the Royal Princesses came early, and all fashionable London was
there, chattering and laughing, displaying elaborate gowns and
priceless jewels, dancing, flirting, listening to the strains of
the string band, or strolling listlessly in the gardens, where the
late roses and clumps of heliotrope threw soft fragrance on the
balmy air.</p>

<p>But Marguerite was nervous and agitated. Strive how she might,
she could not throw off that foreboding of something evil to come,
which had assailed her from the first moment when she met Chauvelin
face to face.</p>

<p>That unaccountable feeling of unreality was still upon her, that
sense that she, and the woman Candeille, Percy, and even His Royal
Highness, were, for the time being, the actors in a play written
and stage-managed by Chauvelin. The ex-ambassador's humility, his
offers of friendship, his quietude under Sir Percy's good-humoured
banter, everything was a sham. Marguerite knew it; her womanly
instinct, her passionate love, all cried out to her in warning; but
there was that in her husband's nature which rendered her powerless
in the face of such dangers, as, she felt sure, were now
threatening him.</p>

<p>Just before her guests had begun to assemble, she had been alone
with him for a few minutes. She had entered the room in which he
sat, looking radiantly beautiful in a shimmering gown of white and
silver, with diamonds in her golden hair and round her exquisite
neck.</p>

<p>Moments like this when she was alone with him, were the joy of
her life. Then, and then only, did she see him as he really was,
with that wistful tenderness in his deep-set eyes, that occasional
flash of passion from beneath the lazily-drooping lids. For a few
minutes&mdash;seconds, mayhap&mdash;the spirit of the reckless
adventurer was laid to rest, relegated into the furthermost
background of his senses by the powerful emotions of the lover.</p>

<p>Then he would seize her in his arms, and hold her to him, with a
strange longing to tear from out his heart all other thoughts,
feelings, and passions save those which made him a slave to her
beauty and her smiles.</p>

<p>"Percy!" she whispered to him to-night, when freeing herself
from his embrace she looked up at him, and for this one heavenly
second felt him all her own. "Percy, you will do nothing rash,
nothing foolhardy, to-night. That man had planned all that took
place yesterday. He hates you and..."</p>

<p>In a moment his face and attitude had changed, the heavy lids
drooped over the eyes, the rigidity of the mouth relaxed, and that
quaint, half shy, half inane smile played around the firm lips.</p>

<p>"Of course he does, m'dear," he said, in his usual affected,
drawly tones, "of course he does, but that is so demmed amusing. He
does not really know what or how much he knows, or what I know...In
fact...er...we none of us know anything just at present..."</p>

<p>He laughed lightly and carelessly, then deliberately readjusted
the set of his lace tie.</p>

<p>"Percy!" she said reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, m'dear."</p>

<p>"Lately, when you brought D&eacute;roul&egrave;de and Juliette
Marny to England I endured agonies of anxiety...and..."</p>

<p>He sighed, a quick, short, wistful sigh, and said very
gently:</p>

<p>"I know you did, m'dear, and that is where the trouble lies. I
know that you are fretting, so I have to be so demmed quick about
the business, so as not to keep you in suspense too long...And now
I can't take Ffoulkes away from his young wife, and Tony and the
others are so mighty slow."</p>

<p>"Percy!" she said once more, with tender earnestness.</p>

<p>"I know, I know," he said, with a slight frown of self-reproach.
"La! but I don't deserve your solicitude. Heaven knows what a brute
I was for years, whilst I neglected you, and ignored the noble
devotion which I, alas! do even now so little to deserve."</p>

<p>She would have said something more, but was interrupted by the
entrance of Juliette Marny into the room.</p>

<p>"Some of your guests have arrived, Lady Blakeney," said the
young girl, apologising for her seeming intrusion. "I thought you
would wish to know."</p>

<p>Juliette looked very young and girlish in a simple white gown,
without a single jewel on her arms or neck. Marguerite regarded her
with unaffected approval.</p>

<p>"You look charming to-night, Mademoiselle, does she not, Sir
Percy?"</p>

<p>"Thanks to your bounty," smiled Juliette, a trifle sadly.
"Whilst I dressed to-night, I felt how I should have loved to wear
my dear mother's jewels, of which she used to be so proud."</p>

<p>"We must hope that you will recover them, dear, some day," said
Marguerite vaguely, as she led the young girl out of the small
study towards the larger reception rooms.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I hope so," sighed Juliette. "When times became so
troublous in France after my dear father's death, his confessor and
friend, the Abb&eacute; Foucquet, took charge of all my mother's
jewels for me. He said they would be safe with the ornaments of his
own little church at Boulogne. He feared no sacrilege, and thought
they would be most effectually hidden there, for no one would dream
of looking for the Marny diamonds in the crypt of a country
church."</p>

<p>Marguerite said nothing in reply. Whatever her own doubts might
be upon such a subject, it could serve no purpose to disturb the
young girl's serenity.</p>

<p>"Dear Abb&eacute; Foucquet," said Juliette after awhile, "his is
the kind of devotion which I feel sure will never be found under
the new r&eacute;gimes of anarchy and of so-called equality. He
would have laid down his life for my father or for me. And I know
that he would never part with the jewels which I entrusted to his
care, whilst he had breath and strength to defend them."</p>

<p>Marguerite would have wished to pursue the subject a little
further. It was very pathetic to witness poor Juliette's hopes and
confidence, which she felt sure would never be realised.</p>

<p>Lady Blakeney knew so much of what was going on in France just
now: spoliations, confiscations, official thefts, open robberies,
all in the name of equality or fraternity, and of patriotism. She
knew nothing, of course, of the Abb&eacute; Foucquet, but the
tender little picture of the devoted old man, painted by Juliette's
loving words, had appealed strongly to her sympathetic heart.</p>

<p>Instinct and knowledge of the political aspect of France told
her that by entrusting valuable family jewels to the old
Abb&eacute;, Juliette had most unwittingly placed the man she so
much trusted in danger of persecution at the hands of a government
which did not even admit the legality of family possessions.
However, there was neither time nor opportunity now to enlarge upon
the subject. Marguerite resolved to recur to it a little later,
when she would be alone with Mdlle. De Marny, and, above all, when
she could take counsel with her husband as to the best means of
recovering the young girl's property for her, whilst relieving a
devoted old man from the dangerous responsibility which he had so
selflessly undertaken.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the two women had reached the first of the long
line of State apartments wherein the brilliant f&ecirc;te was to
take place. The staircase and the hall below were already filled
with the early arrivals. Bidding Juliette to remain in the
ballroom, Lady Blakeney now took up her stand on the
exquisitely-decorated landing, ready to greet her guests. She had a
smile and a pleasant word for all, as, in a constant stream, the
&eacute;lite of London fashionable society began to file past her,
exchanging the elaborate greetings which the stilted mode of the
day prescribed to this butterfly world.</p>

<p>The lacqueys in the hall shouted the names of the guests as they
passed up the stairs: names celebrated in politics, in worlds of
sport, of science, or of art, great historic names, humble,
newly-made ones, noble illustrious titles. The spacious rooms were
filling fast. His Royal Highness, so &#8217;twas said, had just
stepped out of his barge. The noise of laughter and chatter was
incessant, like unto a crowd of gaily-plumaged birds.</p>

<p>Huge bunches of apricot-coloured roses in silver vases made the
air heavy with their subtle perfume. Fans began to flutter. The
string band struck the preliminary cords of the gavotte.</p>

<p>At that moment the lacqueys at the foot of the stairs called out
in stentorian tones:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille and Monsieur
Chauvelin!"</p>

<p>Marguerite's heart gave a slight flutter; she felt a sudden
tightening of the throat. She did not see Candeille at first, only
the slender figure of Chauvelin dressed all in black, as usual,
with head bent and hands clasped behind his back; he was slowly
mounting the wide staircase, between a double row of brilliantly
attired men and women, who looked with no small measure of
curiosity at the ex-ambassador from revolutionary France.</p>

<p>Demoiselle Candeille was leading the way up the stairs. She
paused on the landing, in order to make before her hostess a most
perfect and elaborate curtsey. She looked smiling and radiant,
beautifully dressed, a small wreath of wrought gold leaves in her
hair, her only jewel an absolutely regal one, a magnificent
necklace of diamonds round her shapely throat.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11" id=
"Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
The Challenge</b>
</h2>

<p>It all occurred just before midnight, in one of the smaller
rooms, which lead in enfilade from the principal ball-room.</p>

<p>Dancing had been going on for some time, but the evening was
close, and there seemed to be a growing desire on the part of Lady
Blakeney's guests to wander desultorily through the gardens and
glass-houses, or to sit about where some measure of coolness could
be obtained.</p>

<p>There was a rumour that a new and charming French artiste was to
sing a few peculiarly ravishing songs, unheard in England before.
Close to the main ball-room was the octagon music-room, which was
brilliantly illuminated, and in which a large number of chairs had
been obviously disposed for the comfort of an audience. Into this
room many of the guests had already assembled. It was quite clear
that a chamber-concert&mdash;select and attractive as were all Lady
Blakeney's entertainments&mdash;was in contemplation.</p>

<p>Marguerite herself, released for a moment from her constant
duties near her royal guests, had strolled through the smaller
rooms, accompanied by Juliette, in order to search for Mademoiselle
Candeille and to suggest the commencement of the improvised
concert.</p>

<p>D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille had kept herself very much aloof
throughout the evening, only talking to the one or two gentlemen
whom her hostess had presented to her on her arrival, and with M.
Chauvelin always in close attendance upon her every movement.</p>

<p>Presently, when dancing began, she retired to a small boudoir,
and there sat down, demurely waiting, until Lady Blakeney should
require her services.</p>

<p>When Marguerite and Juliette Marny entered the little room, she
rose and came forward a few steps.</p>

<p>"I am ready, Madame," she said pleasantly, "whenever you wish me
to begin. I have thought out a short programme&mdash;shall I start
with the gay or the sentimental songs?"</p>

<p>But before Marguerite had time to utter a reply, she felt her
arm nervously clutched by a hot and trembling hand.</p>

<p>"Who...who is this woman?" murmured Juliette Marny close to her
ear.</p>

<p>The young girl looked pale and very agitated, and her large eyes
were fixed in unmistakable wrath upon the French actress before
her. A little startled, not understanding Juliette's attitude,
Marguerite tried to reply lightly:</p>

<p>"This is Mademoiselle Candeille, Juliette dear," she said
effecting the usual formal introduction, "of the
Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s Theatre of Paris&mdash;Mademoiselle
D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille who will sing some charming French
ditties for us to-night."</p>

<p>While she spoke she kept a restraining hand on Juliette's
quivering arm. Already, with the keen intuition which had been on
the qui-vive the whole evening, she scented some mystery in this
sudden outburst on the part of her young
prot&eacute;g&eacute;e.</p>

<p>But Juliette did not heed her: she felt surging up in her young,
overburdened heart all the wrath and the contempt of the
persecuted, fugitive aristocrat against the triumphant usurper. She
had suffered so much from that particular class of the risen
kitchen-wench, of which the woman before her was so typical an
example: years of sorrow, of poverty were behind her: loss of
fortune, of kindred, of friends&mdash;she, even now a pauper,
living on the bounty of strangers.</p>

<p>And all this through no fault of her own: the fault of her class
mayhap! but not hers!</p>

<p>She had suffered much, and was still overwrought and
nerve-strung: for some reason she could not afterwards have
explained, she felt spiteful and uncontrolled, goaded into stupid
fury by the look of insolence and of triumph with which Candeille
calmly regarded her.</p>

<p>Afterwards she would willingly have bitten out her tongue for
her vehemence, but for the moment she was absolutely incapable of
checking the torrent of her own emotions.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Candeille, indeed?" she said in wrathful scorn.
"D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille, you mean, Lady Blakeney! My
mother's kitchen-maid, flaunting shamelessly my dear mother's
jewels, which she has stolen mayhap..."</p>

<p>The young girl was trembling from head to foot, tears of anger
obscured her eyes; her voice, which fortunately remained
low&mdash;not much above a whisper&mdash;was thick and husky.</p>

<p>"Juliette! Juliette! I entreat you," admonished Marguerite; "you
must control yourself, you must, indeed...you must...Mademoiselle
Candeille, I beg of you to retire..."</p>

<p>But Candeille&mdash;well-schooled in the part she had to
play&mdash;had no intention of quitting the field of battle. The
more wrathful and excited Mademoiselle de Marny became the more
insolent and triumphant waxed the young actress's whole attitude.
An ironical smile played round the corners of her mouth, her
almond-shaped eyes were half-closed, regarding through drooping
lashes the trembling figure of the young impoverished aristocrat.
Her head was thrown well back, in obvious defiance of the social
conventions, which should have forbidden a fracas in Lady
Blakeney's hospitable house, and her fingers, provocatively toyed
with the diamond necklace which glittered and sparkled round her
throat.</p>

<p>She had no need to repeat the words of a well-learnt part: her
own wit, her own emotions and feelings helped her to act just as
her employer would have wished her to do. Her native vulgarity
helped her to assume the very bearing which he would have desired.
In fact, at this moment D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille had
forgotten everything save the immediate present: a more than
contemptuous snub from one of those penniless aristocrats, who had
rendered her own sojourn in London so unpleasant and
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>She had suffered from these snubs before, but had never had the
chance of forcing an esclandre as a result of her own humiliation.
That spirit of hatred for the rich and idle classes, which was so
characteristic of revolutionary France, was alive and hot within
her: she had never had an opportunity&mdash;she, the humble
fugitive actress from a minor Paris theatre&mdash;to retort with
forcible taunts to the ironical remarks made at haughty
&eacute;migr&eacute;s, who swarmed in those very same circles of
London society into which she herself had vainly striven to
penetrate.</p>

<p>Now at last one of this same hated class, provoked beyond
self-control, was allowing childish and unreasoning fury to
outstrip the usual calm irony of aristocratic rebuffs.</p>

<p>Juliette had paused awhile, in order to check the wrathful tears
which, much against her will, were choking the words in her throat
and blinding her eyes.</p>

<p>"Hoity! toity!" laughed Candeille. "Hark at the young
baggage!"</p>

<p>But Juliette had turned to Marguerite and began explaining
volubly:</p>

<p>"My mother's jewels!" she said in the midst of her tears. "Ask
her how she came by them? When I was obliged to leave the home of
my fathers&mdash;stolen from me by the Revolutionary
Government&mdash;I contrived to retain my mother's jewels...you
remember, I told you just now...The Abb&eacute; Foucquet&mdash;dear
old man!&mdash;saved them for me...that and a little money which I
had...he took charge of them...he said he would place them in
safety with the ornaments of his church, and now I see them round
that woman's neck...I know that he would not have parted with them
save with his life."</p>

<p>All the while that the young girl spoke in a voice half-choked
with sobs, Marguerite tried with all the physical and mental will
at her command to drag her out of the room and thus to put a
summary ending to this unpleasant scene. She ought to have felt
angry with Juliette for this childish and senseless outburst, were
it not for the fact that somehow she knew within her innermost
heart that all this had been arranged and pre-ordained: not by
Fate, not by a Higher Hand, but by the most skilful intriguer
present-day France had ever known.</p>

<p>And even now, as she was half-succeeding in turning Juliette
away from the sight of Candeille, she was not the least surprised
or startled at seeing Chauvelin standing in the very doorway
through which she had hoped to pass. One glance of his face had
made her fears tangible and real: there was a look of satisfaction
and triumph in his pale, narrow eyes, a flash in them of
approbation directed at the insolent attitude of the French
actress: he looked like the stage-manager of a play, content with
the effect his own well-arranged scenes were producing.</p>

<p>What he hoped to gain by this&mdash;somewhat
vulgar&mdash;quarrel between the two women, Marguerite, of course,
could not guess: that something was lurking in his mind, inimical
to herself and to her husband, she did not for a moment doubt, and
at this moment she felt that she would have given her very life to
induce Candeille and Juliette to cease this passage of arms,
without further provocation on either side.</p>

<p>But though Juliette might have been ready to yield to Lady
Blakeney's persuasion, D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille, under
Chauvelin's eye, and fired by her own desire to further humiliate
this overbearing aristocrat, did not wish the little scene to end
so tamely just yet.</p>

<p>"Your old calotin was made to part with his booty, m'dear," she
said, with a contemptuous shrug of her bare shoulders. "Paris and
France have been starving these many years past: a paternal
Government seized all it could with which to reward those that
served it well, whilst all that would have bought bread and meat
for the poor was being greedily stowed away by shameless
traitors!"</p>

<p>Juliette winced at the insult.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she moaned, as she buried her flaming face in her
hands.</p>

<p>Too late now did she realise that she had deliberately stirred
up a mud-heap and sent noisome insects buzzing about her ears.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," said Marguerite authoritatively, "I must ask you
to remember that Mlle. de Marny is my friend, and that you are a
guest in my house."</p>

<p>"Aye! I try not to forget it," rejoined Candeille lightly; "but
of a truth you must admit, Citizeness, that it would require the
patience of a saint to put up with the insolence of a penniless
baggage, who but lately has had to stand her trial in her own
country for impurity of conduct."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, whilst Marguerite distinctly heard
a short sigh of satisfaction escaping from the lips of Chauvelin.
Then a pleasant laugh broke upon the ears of the four actors who
were enacting the dramatic little scene, and Sir Percy Blakeney,
immaculate in his rich white satin coat and filmy lace ruffles,
exquisite in manners and courtesy, entered the little boudoir, and
with his long back slightly bent, his arm outstretched in a
graceful well-studied curve, he approached Mademoiselle
D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille.</p>

<p>"May I have the honour," he said with his most elaborate air of
courtly deference, "of conducting Mademoiselle to her chaise?"</p>

<p>In the doorway, just behind him, stood His Royal Highness the
Prince of Wales, chatting with apparent carelessness to Sir Andrew
Ffoulkes and Lord Anthony Dewhurst. A curtain beyond the open door
was partially drawn aside, disclosing one or two brilliantly
dressed groups, strolling desultorily through the further
rooms.</p>

<p>The four persons assembled in the little boudoir had been so
absorbed by their own passionate emotions and the violence of their
quarrel, that they had not noticed the approach of Sir Percy
Blakeney and of his friends. Juliette and Marguerite certainly were
startled, and Candeille was evidently taken unawares. Chauvelin
alone seemed quite indifferent, and stood back a little when Sir
Percy advanced, in order to allow him to pass.</p>

<p>But Candeille recovered quickly enough from her surprise:
without heeding Blakeney's proffered arm, she turned with all the
airs of an insulted tragedy queen towards Marguerite.</p>

<p>"So 'tis I," she said with affected calm, "who am to bear every
insult in a house in which I was bidden as a guest. I am turned out
like some intrusive and importunate beggar, and I, the stranger in
this land, am destined to find that amidst all these brilliant
English gentlemen there is not one man of honour."</p>

<p>"M. Chauvelin," she added loudly, "our beautiful country, has,
meseems, deputed you to guard the honour as well as the worldly
goods of your unprotected compatriots. I call upon you, in the name
of France, to avenge the insults offered to me to-night."</p>

<p>She looked round defiantly from one to the other of the several
faces which were now turned towards her, but no one, for the
moment, spoke or stirred. Juliette, silent and ashamed, had taken
Marguerite's hand in hers, and was clinging to it as if wishing to
draw strength of character and firmness of purpose through the
pores of the other woman's delicate skin.</p>

<p>Sir Percy, with backbone still bent in a sweeping curve, had not
relaxed his attitude of uttermost deference. The Prince of Wales
and his friends were viewing the scene with slightly amused
aloofness.</p>

<p>For a moment&mdash;seconds at most&mdash;there was dead silence
in the room, during which time it almost seemed as if the beating
of several hearts could be distinctly heard.</p>

<p>Then Chauvelin, courtly and urbane, stepped calmly forward.</p>

<p>"Believe me, Citizeness," he said, addressing Candeille directly
and with marked emphasis, "I am entirely at your command, but am I
not helpless, seeing that those who have so grossly insulted you
are of your own irresponsible, if charming, sex?"</p>

<p>Like a great dog after a nap, Sir Percy Blakeney straightened
his long back and stretched it out to its full length.</p>

<p>"La!" he said pleasantly, "my ever-engaging friend from Calais.
Sir, your servant. Meseems we are ever destined to discuss amiable
matters, in an amiable spirit...A glass of punch,
Monsieur...er...Chauvelin?"</p>

<p>"I must ask you, Sir Percy," rejoined Chauvelin sternly, "to
view this matter with becoming seriousness."</p>

<p>"Seriousness is never becoming, sir," said Blakeney, politely
smothering a slight yawn, "and it is vastly unbecoming in the
presence of ladies."</p>

<p>"Am I to understand, then, Sir Percy," said Chauvelin, "that you
are prepared to apologise to Mademoiselle Candeille for the insults
offered to her by Lady Blakeney?"</p>

<p>Sir Percy again tried to smother that tiresome little yawn,
which seemed most distressing when he desired to be most polite.
Then he flicked off a grain of dust from his immaculate lace ruffle
and buried his long, slender hands in the capacious pockets of his
white satin breeches; finally he said, with the most good-natured
of smiles:</p>

<p>"Sir, have you seen the latest fashion in cravats? I would wish
to draw your attention to the novel way in which we in England tie
a Mechlin-edged bow."</p>

<p>"Sir Percy," retorted Chauvelin firmly, "since you will not
offer Mademoiselle Candeille the apology which she has the right to
expect from you, are you prepared that you and I should cross
swords like two honourable gentlemen?"</p>

<p>Blakeney laughed his usual pleasant, somewhat shy laugh, shook
his powerful frame, and looked from his altitude of six foot three
inches down on the small sable-clad figure of ex-Ambassador
Chauvelin.</p>

<p>"The question is, sir," he said slowly, "should we then be two
honourable gentlemen crossing swords?"</p>

<p>"Sir Percy..."</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>Chauvelin, who for one moment had seemed ready to lose his
temper, now made a sudden effort to resume a calm and easy
attitude, and said quietly:</p>

<p>"Of course, if one of us is coward enough to shirk the
contest..."</p>

<p>He did not complete the sentence, but shrugged his shoulders
expressive of contempt. The other side of the curtained doorway a
little crowd had gradually assembled, attracted hither by the loud
and angry voices which came from that small boudoir. Host and
hostess had been missed from the reception rooms for some time; His
Royal Highness, too, had not been seen for the last quarter of an
hour. Like flies attracted by the light, one by one, or in small,
isolated groups, some of Lady Blakeney's guests had found their way
to the room adjoining the Royal presence.</p>

<p>As His Highness was standing in the doorway itself, no one
could, of course, cross the threshold, but everyone could see into
the room and could take stock of the various actors in the little
comedy. They were witnessing a quarrel between the French envoy and
Sir Percy Blakeney, wherein the former was evidently in deadly
earnest and the latter merely politely bored. Amused comments flew
to and fro: laughter and a Babel of irresponsible chatter made an
incessant chirruping accompaniment to the duologue between the two
men.</p>

<p>But at this stage the Prince of Wales, who hitherto had
seemingly kept aloof from the quarrel, suddenly stepped forward and
abruptly interposed the weight of his authority and of his social
position between the bickering adversaries.</p>

<p>"Tush, man!" he said impatiently, turning more especially
towards Chauvelin, "you talk at random. Sir Percy Blakeney is an
English gentleman, and the laws of this country do not admit of
duelling, as you understand it in France; and I for one certainly
could not allow..."</p>

<p>"Pardon, your Royal Highness," interrupted Sir Percy, with
irresistible bonhomie, "your Highness does not understand the
situation. My engaging friend here does not propose that I should
transgress the laws of this country, but that I should go over to
France with him, and fight him there, where duelling
and...er...other little matters of that sort are allowed."</p>

<p>"Yes! quite so!" rejoined the Prince. "I understand M.
Chauvelin's desire...But what about you, Blakeney?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied Sir Percy lightly, "I have accepted his challenge,
of course!"</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12" id=

Time-Place-Conditions</b>
</h2>

<p>It would be very difficult indeed to say why&mdash;at Blakeney's
lightly-spoken words&mdash;an immediate silence should have fallen
upon all those present. All the actors in the little drawing-room
drama, who had played their respective parts so unerringly up to
now, had paused awhile, just as if an invisible curtain had come
down, marking the end of a scene, and the interval during which the
players might recover strength and energy to resume their
r&ocirc;les. The Prince of Wales as foremost spectator said nothing
for the moment, and, beyond the doorway, the audience there
assembled seemed suddenly to be holding its breath,
waiting&mdash;eager, expectant, palpitating&mdash;for what would
follow now.</p>

<p>Only here and there the gentle frou-frou of a silk skirt, the
rhythmic flutter of a fan, broke those few seconds' deadly, stony
silence.</p>

<p>Yet it all was simple enough. A fracas between two ladies, the
gentlemen interposing, a few words of angry expostulation, and then
the inevitable suggestion of Belgium or of some other country where
the childish and barbarous custom of settling such matters with a
couple of swords had not been as yet systematically stamped
out.</p>

<p>The whole scene&mdash;with but slight variations&mdash;had
occurred scores of times in London drawing-rooms. English gentlemen
had, scores of times, crossed the Channel for the purpose of
settling similar quarrels in Continental fashion.</p>

<p>Why should the present situation appear so abnormal? Sir Percy
Blakeney&mdash;an accomplished gentleman&mdash;was past master in
the art of fence, and looked more than a match in strength and
dexterity for the meagre, sable-clad little opponent who had so
summarily challenged him to cross over to France, in order to fight
a duel.</p>

<p>But somehow everyone had a feeling at this moment that this
proposed duel would be unlike any other combat ever fought between
two antagonists. Perhaps it was the white, absolutely stony and
unexpressive face of Marguerite which suggested a latent tragedy;
perhaps it was the look of unmistakable horror in Juliette's eyes,
or that of triumph in those of Chauvelin, or even that certain
something in His Royal Highness' face, which seemed to imply that
the Prince, careless man of the world as he was, would have given
much to prevent this particular meeting from taking place.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, there is no doubt that a certain wave of
electrical excitement swept over the little crowd assembled there,
the while the chief actor in the little drama, the inimitable
dandy, Sir Percy Blakeney himself, appeared deeply engrossed in
removing a speck of powder from the wide black satin ribbon which
held his gold-rimmed eyeglass.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!" said His Royal Highness suddenly, "we are
forgetting the ladies. My lord Hastings," he added, turning to one
of the gentlemen who stood close to him, "I pray you to remedy this
unpardonable neglect. Men's quarrels are not fit for ladies' dainty
ears."</p>

<p>Sir Percy looked up from his absorbing occupation. His eyes met
those of his wife; she was like a marble statue, hardly conscious
of what was going on round her. But he, who knew every emotion
which swayed that ardent and passionate nature, guessed that
beneath that stony calm there lay a mad, almost unconquerable
impulse; and that was to shout to all these puppets here the truth,
the awful, the unanswerable truth, to tell them what this challenge
really meant; a trap wherein one man, consumed with hatred and
desire for revenge, hoped to entice a brave and fearless foe into a
death-dealing snare.</p>

<p>Full well did Percy Blakeney guess that for the space of one
second his most cherished secret hovered upon his wife's lips, one
turn of the balance of Fate, one breath from the mouth of an unseen
sprite, and Marguerite was ready to shout:</p>

<p>"Do not allow this monstrous thing to be! The Scarlet Pimpernel,
whom you all admire for his bravery, and love for his daring,
stands before you now, face to face with his deadliest enemy, who
is here to lure him to his doom!"</p>

<p>For that momentous second, therefore, Percy Blakeney held his
wife's gaze with the magnetism of his own; all there was in him of
love, of entreaty, of trust, and of command went out to her through
that look with which he kept her eyes rivetted upon his face.</p>

<p>Then he saw the rigidity of her attitude relax. She closed her
eyes in order to shut out the whole world from her suffering soul.
She seemed to be gathering all the mental force of which her brain
was capable for one great effort of self-control. Then she took
Juliette's hand in hers, and turned to go out of the room; the
gentlemen bowed as she swept past them, her rich silken gown making
a soft hush-sh-sh as she went. She nodded to some, curtseyed to the
Prince, and had at the last moment the supreme courage and pride to
turn her head once more towards her husband, in order to re-assure
him finally that his secret was as safe with her now, in this hour
of danger, as it had been in the time of triumph.</p>

<p>She smiled and passed out of his sight, preceded by
D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille, who, escorted by one of the
gentlemen, had become singularly silent and subdued.</p>

<p>In the little room now there only remained a few men. Sir Andrew
Ffoulkes had taken the precaution of closing the door after the
ladies had gone.</p>

<p>Then His Royal Highness turned once more to Monsieur Chauvelin
and said with an obvious show of indifference:</p>

<p>"Faith, Monsieur! Meseems we are all enacting a farce, which can
have no final act. I vow that I cannot allow my friend Blakeney to
go over to France at your bidding. Your government now will not
allow my father's subjects to land on your shores without a special
passport, and then only for a specific purpose."</p>

<p>"La, your Royal Highness," interposed Sir Percy, "I pray you
have no fear for me on that score. My engaging friend here
has&mdash;and I mistake not&mdash;a passport ready for me in the
pocket of his sable-hued coat, and as we are hoping effectually to
spit one another over there...gadzooks! but there's the specific
purpose...Is it not true, sir" he added, turning once more to
Chauvelin, "that in the pocket of that exquisitely-cut coat of
yours you have a passport&mdash;name in blank perhaps&mdash;which
you had specifically designed for me?"</p>

<p>It was so carelessly, so pleasantly said, that no one save
Chauvelin guessed the real import of Sir Percy's words. Chauvelin,
of course, knew their inner meaning: he understood that Blakeney
wished to convey to him the fact that he was well aware that the
whole scene to-night had been pre-arranged, and that it was
willingly and with eyes wide open that he walked into the trap
which the revolutionary patriot had so carefully laid for him.</p>

<p>"The passport will be forthcoming in due course, sir," retorted
Chauvelin evasively, "when our seconds have arranged all
formalities."</p>

<p>"Seconds be demmed, sir," rejoined Sir Percy placidly. "You do
not propose, I trust, that we travel a whole caravan to
France?"</p>

<p>"Time, place, and conditions must be settled, Sir Percy,"
replied Chauvelin; "you are too accomplished a cavalier, I feel
sure, to wish to arrange such formalities yourself."</p>

<p>"Nay! neither you nor I, Monsieur er Chauvelin," quoth Sir Percy
blandly, "could, I own, settle such things with persistent
good-humour; and good-humour in such cases is the most important of
all formalities. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Sir Percy."</p>

<p>"As for seconds, perish the thought! One second only, I entreat,
and that one a lady&mdash;the most adorable&mdash;the most
detestable&mdash;the most true&mdash;the most fickle amidst all her
charming sex...Do you agree, sir?"</p>

<p>"You have not told me her name, Sir Percy?"</p>

<p>"Chance, Monsieur, Chance. With His Royal Highness' permission,
let the wilful jade decide."</p>

<p>"I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Three throws of the dice, Monsieur...Time Place Conditions, you
said&mdash;three throws and the winner names them...Do you
agree?"</p>

<p>Chauvelin hesitated. Sir Percy's bantering mood did not quite
fit in with his own elaborate plans; moreover, the ex-ambassador
feared a pitfall of some sort, and did not quite like to trust to
this arbitration of the dice-box.</p>

<p>He turned, quite involuntarily, in appeal to the Prince of
Wales, and the other gentlemen present.</p>

<p>But the Englishman of those days was a born gambler. He lived
with the dice-box in one pocket and a pack of cards in the other.
The Prince himself was no exception to this rule, and the first
gentleman in England was the most avowed worshipper of Hazard in
the land.</p>

<p>"Chance, by all means," quoth His Highness gaily.</p>

<p>In the midst of so hostile a crowd, Chauvelin felt it unwise to
resist. Moreover, one second's reflection had already assured him
that this throwing of the dice could not seriously interfere with
the success of his plans. If the meeting took place at
all&mdash;and Sir Percy now had gone too far to draw
back&mdash;then of necessity it would have to take place in
France.</p>

<p>The question of time and conditions of the fight, which at best
would be only a farce&mdash;only a means to an end&mdash;could not
be of paramount importance.</p>

<p>Therefore he shrugged his shoulders with well-marked
indifference, and said lightly:</p>

<p>"As you please."</p>

<p>There was a small table in the centre of the room with a settee
and two or three chairs arranged close to it. Around this table now
an eager little group had congregated: the Prince of Wales in the
forefront, unwilling to interfere, scarce knowing what madcap plans
were floating through Blakeney's adventurous brain, but excited in
spite of himself at this momentous game of hazard, the issues of
which seemed so nebulous, so vaguely fraught with dangers. Close to
him were Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, Lord Anthony Dewhurst, Lord
Grenville, and perhaps a half score gentlemen, young men about town
mostly, gay and giddy butterflies of fashion, who did not even
attempt to seek, in this strange game of chance, any hidden meaning
save that it was one of Blakeney's irresponsible pranks.</p>

<p>And in the centre of the compact group, Sir Percy Blakeney, in
his gorgeous suit of shimmering white satin, one knee bent upon a
chair, and leaning with easy grace&mdash;dice-box in
hand&mdash;across the small gilt-legged table; beside him
ex-Ambassador Chauvelin, standing with arms folded behind his back,
watching every movement of his brilliant adversary, like some
dark-plumaged hawk hovering near a bird of paradise.</p>

<p>"Place first, Monsieur?" suggested Sir Percy.</p>

<p>"As you will, sir," assented Chauvelin.</p>

<p>He took up a dice-box which one of the gentlemen handed to him,
and the two men threw.</p>

<p>"'Tis mine, Monsieur," said Blakeney carelessly, "mine to name
the place where shall occur the historic encounter, 'twixt the
busiest man in France and the most idle fop that e'er disgraced
these three kingdoms. Just for the sake of argument, sir, what
place would you suggest?"</p>

<p>"Oh! the exact spot is immaterial, Sir Percy," replied Chauvelin
coldly, "the whole of France stands at your disposal."</p>

<p>"Aye! I thought as much, but could not be quite sure of such
boundless hospitality," retorted Blakeney imperturbably.</p>

<p>"Do you care for the woods around Paris, sir?"</p>

<p>"Too far from the coast, sir. I might be seasick crossing over
the Channel, and glad to get the business over as soon as
possible...No, not Paris, sir&mdash;rather let us say Boulogne.
Pretty little place, Boulogne...do you not think so?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, Sir Percy."</p>

<p>"Then Boulogne it is...the ramparts, as you will, on the south
side of the town."</p>

<p>"As you please," rejoined Chauvelin drily. "Shall we throw
again?"</p>

<p>A murmur of merriment had accompanied this brief colloquy
between the adversaries, and Blakeney's bland sallies were received
with shouts of laughter. Now the dice rattled again, and once more
the two men threw.</p>

<p>"'Tis yours this time, Monsieur Chuavelin," said Blakeney, after
a rapid glance at the dice. "See how evenly Chance favours us both.
Mine, the choice of place...admirably done you'll confess...Now
yours the choice of time. I wait upon your pleasure, sir...The
southern ramparts at Boulogne&mdash;when?"</p>

<p>"The fourth day from this, sir, at the hour when the Cathedral
bell chimes the evening Angelus," came Chauvelin's ready reply.</p>

<p>"Nay! but methought that your demmed government had abolished
Cathedrals, and bells and chimes. The people of France have now to
go to hell their own way for the way to heaven has been barred by
the National Convention...Is that not so? Methought the Angelus was
forbidden to be rung."</p>

<p>"Not at Boulogne, I think, Sir Percy," retorted Chauvelin drily,
"and I'll pledge you my word that the evening Angelus shall be rung
that night."</p>

<p>"At what hour is that, sir?"</p>

<p>"One hour after sundown."</p>

<p>"But why four days after this? Why not two or three?"</p>

<p>"I might have asked, why the southern ramparts? Sir Percy, why
not the western? I chose the fourth day&mdash;does it not suit
you?" asked Chauvelin ironically.</p>

<p>"Suit me! Why, sir, nothing could suit me better," rejoined
Blakeney with his pleasant laugh. "Zounds! But I call it marvellous
demmed marvellous. I wonder now," he added blandly, "what made you
think of the Angelus?"</p>

<p>Everyone laughed at this, a little irreverently perhaps.</p>

<p>"Ah!" continued Blakeney gaily, "I remember now...Faith! To
think that I was nigh forgetting that when last you and I met, sir,
you had just taken or were about to take Holy Orders...Ah! how well
the thought of the Angelus fits in with your clerical garb...I
recollect that the latter was mightily becoming to you, sir"</p>

<p>"Shall we proceed to settle the conditions of the fight, Sir
Percy?" said Chauvelin, interrupting the flow of his antagonist's
gibes, and trying to disguise his irritation beneath a mask of
impassive reserve.</p>

<p>"The choice of weapons, you mean," here interposed His Royal
Highness; "but I thought that swords had already been decided
on."</p>

<p>"Quite so, your Highness," assented Blakeney, "but there are
various little matters in connection with this momentous encounter
which are of vast importance...Am I not right, Monsieur? Gentlemen,
I appeal to you...Faith! one never knows. My engaging opponent here
might desire that I should fight him in green socks, and I that he
should wear a scarlet flower in his coat."</p>

<p>"The Scarlet Pimpernel, Sir Percy?"</p>

<p>"Why not, Monsieur? It would look so well in your buttonhole,
against the black of the clerical coat, which I understand you
sometimes affect in France and when it is withered and quite dead
you would find that it would leave an overpowering odour in your
nostrils, far stronger than that of incense."</p>

<p>There was general laughter after this. The hatred which every
member of the French revolutionary government&mdash;including, of
course, ex-Ambassador Chauvelin&mdash;bore to the national hero was
well known.</p>

<p>"The conditions then, Sir Percy," said Chauvelin, without
seeming to notice the taunt conveyed in Blakeney's last words.
"Shall we throw again?"</p>

<p>"After you, sir," acquiesced Sir Percy.</p>

<p>For the third and last time the two opponents rattled the
dice-box and threw. Chauvelin was now absolutely unmoved. These
minor details quite failed to interest him. What mattered the
conditions of the fight which was only intended as a bait with
which to lure his enemy in the open. The hour and place were
decided on, and Sir Percy would not fail to come. Chauvelin knew
enough of his opponent's boldly adventurous spirit not to feel in
the least doubtful on that point. Even now, as he gazed with
grudging admiration at the massive, well-knit figure of his
arch-enemy, noted the thin nervy hands and square jaw, the low,
broad forehead, and deep-set half-veiled eyes, he knew that in this
matter wherein Percy Blakeney was obviously playing with his very
life, the only emotion that really swayed him at this moment was
his passionate love of adventure.</p>

<p>The ruling passion strong in death!</p>

<p>Yes! Sir Percy would be on the southern ramparts of Boulogne one
hour after sunset on the day named, trusting, no doubt, in his
usual marvellous good-fortune, his own presence of mind and his
great physical and mental strength, to escape from the trap into
which he was ready to walk.</p>

<p>But even at this moment, Chauvelin had already resolved on one
great thing: namely that on that eventful day nothing whatever
should be left to Chance; he would meet his cunning enemy not only
with cunning but also with power, and if the entire force of the
Republican army then available in the north of France had to be
requisitioned for the purpose, the ramparts of Boulogne would be
surrounded and no chance of escape left for the daring Scarlet
Pimpernel.</p>

<p>His wave of meditation, however, was here abruptly stemmed by
Blakeney's voice.</p>

<p>"Lud! Monsieur Chauvelin," he said. "I fear me your luck has
deserted you. Chance, as you see, has turned to me once more."</p>

<p>"Then it is for you, Sir Percy," rejoined the Frenchman, "to
name the conditions under which we are to fight."</p>

<p>"Ah! that is so, is it not, Monsieur?" quoth Sir Percy lightly.
"By my faith! I'll not plague you with formalities. We'll fight
with our coats on if it be cold, in our shirt-sleeves if it be
sultry...I'll not demand either green socks or scarlet ornaments.
I'll even try and be serious for the space of two minutes, sir, and
confine my whole attention&mdash;the product of my infinitesimal
brain&mdash;to thinking out some pleasant detail for this duel,
which might be acceptable to you. Thus, sir, the thought of weapons
springs to mind...Swords, you said, I think. Sir! I will e'en
restrict my choice of conditions to that of the actual weapons with
which we are to fight. Ffoulkes, I pray you," he added, turning to
his friend, "the pair of swords which lie across the top of my desk
at this moment."</p>

<p>"We'll not ask a menial to fetch them, eh, Monsieur?" he
continued gaily, as Sir Andrew Ffoulkes at a sign from him had
quickly left the room. "What need to bruit our pleasant quarrel
abroad? You will like the weapons, sir, and you shall have your own
choice from the pair. You are a finer fencer, I feel sure and you
shall decide if a scratch or two or a more serious wound shall be
sufficient to avenge Mademoiselle Candeille's wounded vanity."</p>

<p>Whilst he prattled so gaily on, there was dead silence among all
those present. The Prince had his shrewd eyes steadily fixed upon
him, obviously wondering what this seemingly irresponsible
adventurer held at the back of his mind. There is no doubt that
everyone felt oppressed, and that a strange murmur of anticipatory
excitement went round the little room, when, a few seconds later,
Sir Andrew Ffoulkes returned, with two sheathed swords in his
hand.</p>

<p>Blakeney took them from his friend and placed them on the little
table in front of ex-Ambassador Chauvelin. The spectators strained
their necks to look at the two weapons. They were exactly similar
one to the other: both encased in plain black leather sheaths, with
steel ferrules polished to shine like silver; the handles, too,
were of plain steel, with just the grip fashioned in a twisted
basket pattern of the same highly-tempered metal.</p>

<p>"What think you of these weapons, Monsieur?" asked Blakeney, who
was carelessly leaning against the back of a chair.</p>

<p>Chauvelin took up one of the two swords, and slowly drew it from
out its scabbard, carefully examining the brilliant, narrow steel
blade as he did so.</p>

<p>"A little old-fashioned in style and make, Sir Percy," he said,
closely imitating his opponent's easy demeanour, "a trifle heavier,
perhaps, than we in France have been accustomed to lately, but,
nevertheless, a beautifully-tempered piece of steel."</p>

<p>"Of a truth there's not much the matter with the tempering,
Monsieur," quoth Blakeney, "the blades were fashioned at Toledo,
just two hundred years ago."</p>

<p>"Ah! here I see an inscription," said Chauvelin, holding the
sword close to his eyes, the better to see the minute letters
engraved in the steel.</p>

<p>"The name of the original owner. I myself bought them&mdash;when
I travelled in Italy&mdash;from one of his descendants."</p>

<p>"Lorenzo Giovanni Cenci," said Chauvelin, spelling the Italian
names quite slowly.</p>

<p>"The greatest blackguard that ever trod this earth. You, no
doubt, Monsieur, know his history better than we do. Rapine, theft,
murder; nothing came amiss to Signor Lorenzo...neither the deadly
drug in the cup nor the poisoned dagger."</p>

<p>He had spoken lightly, carelessly, with that same tone of easy
banter, which he had not forsaken throughout the evening, and the
same drawly manner, which was habitual to him. But at these last
words of his, Chauvelin gave a visible start, and then abruptly
replaced the sword&mdash;which he had been examining&mdash;upon the
table.</p>

<p>He threw a quick, suspicious glance at Blakeney, who, leaning
back against the chair and one knee resting on the cushioned seat,
was idly toying with the other blade, the exact pair to the one
which the ex-ambassador had so suddenly put down.</p>

<p>"Well, Monsieur," quoth Sir Percy, after a slight pause, and
meeting with a swift glance of lazy irony his opponent's fixed
gaze. "Are you satisfied with the weapons? Which of the two shall
be yours, and which mine?"</p>

<p>"Of a truth, Sir Percy" murmured Chauvelin still hesitating.</p>

<p>"Nay, Monsieur," interupted Blakeney with pleasant bonhomie, "I
know what you would say of a truth, there is no choice between this
pair of perfect twins: one is as exquisite as the other. And yet
you must take one and I the other...this or that, whichever you
prefer. You shall take it home with you to-night and practise
thrusting at a haystack or at a bobbin. The sword is yours to
command until you have used it against my unworthy person...yours
until you bring it out four days hence&mdash;on the southern
ramparts of Boulogne, when the Cathedral bells chime the evening
Angelus; then you shall cross it against its faithless twin. There,
Monsieur&mdash;they are of equal length of equal strength and
temper a perfect pair. Yet I pray you, choose."</p>

<p>He took up both the swords in his hands, and carefully balancing
them by the extreme tip of their steel-bound scabbards, he held
them out toward the Frenchman. Chauvelin's eyes were fixed upon
him, and he from his towering height was looking down at the little
sable-clad figure before him.</p>

<p>The Terrorist seemed uncertain what to do. Though he was one of
those men who, by the force of their intellect, the strength of
their enthusiasm, the power of their cruelty, had built a new
anarchical France, had overturned a throne and murdered a king, yet
now, face to face with this affected fop, this lazy and debonnair
adventurer, he hesitated&mdash;trying in vain to read what was
going on behind that low, smooth forehead or within the depths of
those lazy, blue eyes.</p>

<p>He would have given several years of his life at this moment for
one short glimpse into the innermost brain cells of his daring
mind, to see the man start, quiver but for the fraction of a
second, betray himself by a tremor of the eyelid. What counter-plan
was lurking in Percy Blakeney's head, as he offered to his opponent
the two swords, which had once belonged to Lorenzo Cenci?</p>

<p>Did any thought of foul play, of dark and deadly poisonings
linger in the fastidious mind of this accomplished English
gentleman?</p>

<p>Surely not!</p>

<p>Chauvelin tried to chide himself for such fears. It seemed
madness even to think of Italian poisons, of the Cencis or the
Borgias in the midst of this brilliantly-lighted English
drawing-room.</p>

<p>But because he was above all a diplomatist, a fencer with words
and with looks, the envoy of France determined to know, to probe,
and to read. He forced himself once more to careless laughter and
nonchalance of manner and schooled his lips to smile up with gentle
irony at the good-humoured face of his arch-enemy.</p>

<p>He tapped one of the swords with his long-pointed finger.</p>

<p>"Is this the one you choose, sir?" asked Blakeney.</p>

<p>"Nay! which do you advise, Sir Percy?" replied Chauvelin
lightly. "Which of those two blades think you is most like to hold
after two hundred years the poison of the Cenci?"</p>

<p>But Blakeney neither started nor winced. He broke into a laugh,
his own usual pleasant laugh, half shy and somewhat inane, then
said in tones of lively astonishment</p>

<p>"Zounds! Sir, but you are full of surprises. Faith! I never
would have thought of that! Marvellous, I call, it demmed
marvellous! What say you, gentlemen? Your Royal Highness, what
think you? Is not my engaging friend here of a most original turn
of mind? Will you have this sword or that, Monsieur? Nay, I must
insist&mdash;else we shall weary our friends if we hesitate too
long. This one, then, sir, since you have chosen it," he continued,
as Chauvelin finally took one of the swords in his hand. "And now
for a bowl of punch. Nay, Monsieur, &#8217;twas demmed smart what
you said just now. I must insist on your joining us in a bowl. Such
wit as yours, Monsieur, must need whetting at times. I pray you
repeat that same sally again!"</p>

<p>Then, finally turning to the Prince and to his friends, he
added:</p>

<p>"And after that bowl, gentlemen, shall we rejoin the
ladies?"</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13" id=

Reflections</b>
</h2>

<p>It seemed indeed as if the incident were finally closed, the
chief actors in the drama having deliberately vacated the centre of
the stage.</p>

<p>The little crowd which had stood in a compact mass round the
table began to break up into sundry small groups: laughter and
desultory talk, checked for a moment by that oppressive sense of
unknown danger, which had weighed on the spirits of those present,
once more became general. Blakeney's light-heartedness had put
everyone into a good humour; since he evidently did not look upon
the challenge as a matter of serious moment, why then, no one else
had any cause for anxiety, and the younger men were right glad to
join in that bowl of punch which their genial host had offered with
so merry a grace.</p>

<p>Lacqueys appeared, throwing open the doors. From a distance the
sound of dance music once more broke upon the ear.</p>

<p>A few of the men only had remained silent, deliberately holding
aloof from the renewed mirthfulness. Foremost amongst these was His
Royal Highness, who was looking distinctly troubled, and who had
taken Sir Percy by the arm and was talking to him with obvious
earnestness. Lord Anthony Dewhurst and Lord Hastings were holding
converse in a secluded corner of the room, whilst Sir Andrew
Ffoulkes, as being the host's most intimate friend, felt it
incumbent on him to say a few words to ex-Ambassador Chauvelin.</p>

<p>The latter was desirous of effecting a retreat. Blakeney's
invitation to join in the friendly bowl of punch could not be taken
seriously, and the Terrorist wanted to be alone, in order to think
out the events of the past hour.</p>

<p>A lacquey waited on him, took the momentous sword from his hand,
found his hat and cloak, and called his coach for him: Chauvelin,
having taken formal leave of his host and acquaintances, quickly
worked his way to the staircase and hall, through the
less-frequented apartments.</p>

<p>He sincerely wished to avoid meeting Lady Blakeney face to face.
Not that the slightest twinge of remorse disturbed his mind, but he
feared some impulsive action on her part, which indirectly might
interfere with his future plans. Fortunately no one took much heed
of the darkly-clad, insignificant little figure, that glided so
swiftly by, obviously determined to escape attention.</p>

<p>In the hall he found Demoiselle Candeille waiting for him. She
too had evidently been desirous of leaving Blakeney Manor as soon
as possible. He saw her to her chaise; then escorted her as far as
her lodgings, which were close by: there were still one or two
things which he wished to discuss with her, one or two final
instructions which he desired to give.</p>

<p>On the whole, he was satisfied with his evening's work: the
young actress had well supported him, and had played her part so
far with marvellous <i>sang-froid</i> and skill. Sir Percy, whether
willingly or blindly, had seemed only too ready to walk into the
trap which was being set for him.</p>

<p>This fact alone disturbed Chauvelin not a little, and as, half
an hour or so later, having taken final leave of his ally, he sat
alone in the coach which was conveying him back to town, the sword
of Lorenzo Cenci close to his hand, he pondered very seriously over
it.</p>

<p>That the adventurous Scarlet Pimpernel should have guessed all
along that sooner or later the French Revolutionary
Government&mdash;whom he had defrauded of some of its most
important victims&mdash;would desire to be even with him, and to
bring him to the scaffold, was not to be wondered at. But that he
should be so blind as to imagine that Chauvelin's challenge was
anything else but a lure to induce him to go to France could not
possibly be supposed. So bold an adventurer, so keen an intriguer
was sure to have scented the trap immediately, and if he appeared
ready to fall into it, it was because there had already sprung up
in his resourceful mind some bold coup or subtle counter-plan, with
which he hoped to gratify his own passionate love of sport, whilst
once more bringing his enemies to discomfiture and humiliation.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Sir Percy Blakeney, as an accomplished gentleman of
the period, could not very well under the circumstances which had
been so carefully stage-managed and arranged by Chauvelin, refuse
the latter's challenge to fight him on the other side of the
Channel. Any hesitation on the part of the leader of that daring
Scarlet Pimpernel League would have covered him with a faint
suspicion of pusillanimity, and a subtle breath of ridicule, and in
a moment the prestige of the unknown and elusive hero would have
vanished for ever.</p>

<p>But apart from the necessity of the fight, Blakeney seemed to
enter into the spirit of the plot directed against his own life
with such light-hearted merriment, such zest and joy, that
Chauvelin could not help but be convinced that the capture of the
Scarlet Pimpernel at Boulogne or elsewhere would not prove quite so
easy a matter as he had at first anticipated.</p>

<p>That same night he wrote a long and circumstantial letter to his
colleague, Citizen Robespierre, shifting thereby, as it were, some
of the responsibility of coming events from his own shoulders on to
the executive of the Committee of Public Safety.</p>

<p class="note">"I guarantee to you, Citizen Robespierre," he
wrote, "and to the members of the Revolutionary Government who have
entrusted me with the delicate mission, that four days from this
date, at one hour after sunset, the man who goes by the mysterious
name of the Scarlet Pimpernel will be on the ramparts of Boulogne,
on the south side of the town. I have done what has been asked of
me. On that day, and at that hour, I shall have brought the enemy
of the Revolution, the intriguer against the policy of the
Republic, within the power of the Government which he has flouted
and outraged. Now look to it, citizens all, that the fruits of my
diplomacy and of my skill be not lost to France again. The man will
be there at my bidding; 'tis for you to see that he does not escape
this time."</p>

<p>This letter he sent by the special courier which the National
Convention had placed at his disposal in case of emergency. Having
sealed it and entrusted it to the man, Chauvelin felt at peace with
the world and with himself. Although he was not so sure of success
as he would have wished, he yet could not see <i>how</i> failure
could possibly come about: and the only regret which he felt
to-night, when he finally, in the early dawn, sought a few hours'
troubled rest, was that that momentous fourth day was still so very
far distant.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14" id=

The Ruling Passion</b>
</h2>

<p>In the meanwhile silence had fallen over the beautiful old
manorial house. One by one the guests had departed, leaving that
peaceful sense of complete calm and isolation which follows the
noisy chatter of any great throng bent chiefly on enjoyment.</p>

<p>The evening had been universally acknowledged to have been
brilliantly successful. True, the much-talked-of French artiste had
not sung the promised ditties, but in the midst of the whirl and
excitement of dances, of the inspiriting tunes of the string band,
the elaborate supper and recherch&eacute; wines, no one had paid
much heed to this change in the programme of entertainments.</p>

<p>And everyone had agreed that never had Lady Blakeney looked more
radiantly beautiful than on this night. She seemed absolutely
indefatigable; a perfect hostess, full of charming little
attentions towards everyone, although more than ordinarily absorbed
by her duties towards her many Royal guests.</p>

<p>The dramatic incident which had taken place in the small boudoir
had not been much bruited abroad. It was always considered bad form
in those courtly days to discuss men's quarrels before ladies, and
in this instance those who were present when it all occurred
instinctively felt that their discretion would be appreciated in
high circles, and held their tongues accordingly.</p>

<p>Thus the brilliant evening was brought to a happy conclusion,
without a single cloud to mar the enjoyment of the guests.
Marguerite performed a veritable miracle of fortitude, forcing her
very smiles to seem natural and gay, chatting pleasantly, even
wittily, upon every known fashionable topic of the day, laughing
merrily the while her poor, aching heart was filled with
unspeakable misery.</p>

<p>Now, when everybody had gone, when the last of her guests had
bobbed before her the prescribed curtsey, to which she had
invariably responded with the same air of easy self-possession, now
at last she felt free to give rein to her thoughts, to indulge in
the luxury of looking her own anxiety in the face and to let the
tension of her nerves relax.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had been the last to leave, and Percy had
strolled out with him as far as the garden gate, for Lady Ffoulkes
had left in her chaise some time ago, and Sir Andrew meant to walk
to his home not many yards distant from Blakeney Manor.</p>

<p>In spite of herself Marguerite felt her heartstrings tighten as
she thought of this young couple so lately wedded. People smiled a
little when Sir Andrew Ffoulkes' name was mentioned: some called
him effeminate, other uxorious, his fond attachment for his pretty
little wife was thought to pass the bounds of decorum. There was no
doubt that since his marriage the young man had greatly changed.
His love of sport and adventure seemed to have died out completely,
yielding evidently to the great, more overpowering love, that for
his young wife.</p>

<p>Suzanne was nervous for her husband's safety. She had sufficient
influence over him to keep him at home, when other members of the
brave little League of the Scarlet Pimpernel followed their leader
with mad zest on some bold adventure.</p>

<p>Marguerite, too, at first had smiled in kindly derision when
Suzanne Ffoulkes, her large eyes filled with tears, had used her
wiles to keep Sir Andrew tied to her own dainty apron-strings. But
somehow, lately, with that gentle contempt which she felt for the
weaker man, there had mingled a half-acknowledged sense of
envy.</p>

<p>How different 'twixt her and her husband.</p>

<p>Percy loved her truly and with a depth of passion proportionate
to his own curious dual personality: it were sacrilege almost, to
doubt the intensity of his love. But, nevertheless, she had at all
times a feeling as if he were holding himself and his emotions in
check, as if his love, as if she, Marguerite, his wife, were but
secondary matters in his life; as if her anxieties, her sorrow when
he left her, her fears for his safety, were but small episodes in
the great book of life which he had planned out and conceived for
himself.</p>

<p>Then she would hate herself for such thoughts: they seemed like
doubts of him. Did any man ever love a woman, she asked herself, as
Percy loved her? He was difficult to understand, and
perhaps&mdash;oh! that was an awful "perhaps"&mdash;perhaps there
lurked somewhere in his mind a slight mistrust of her. She had
betrayed him once!&mdash;unwittingly, 'tis true! Did he fear she
might do so again?</p>

<p>And to-night, after her guests had gone, she threw open the
great windows that gave on the beautiful terrace, with its marble
steps leading down to the cool river beyond. Everything now seemed
so peaceful and still; the scent of the heliotrope made the
midnight air swoon with its intoxicating fragrance; the rhythmic
murmur of the waters came gently echoing from below, and from far
away there came the melancholy cry of a night-bird on the
prowl.</p>

<p>That cry made Marguerite shudder: her thoughts flew back to the
episodes of this night and to Chauvelin, the dark bird of prey,
with his mysterious, death-dealing plans, his subtle intrigues,
which all tended towards the destruction of one man: his enemy, the
husband whom Marguerite loved.</p>

<p>Oh! how she hated these wild adventures which took Percy away
from her side. Is not a woman who loves&mdash;be it husband or
child&mdash;the most truly selfish, the most cruelly callous
creature in the world&mdash;there, where the safety and the
well-being of the loved one is in direct conflict with the safety
and well-being of others.</p>

<p>She would right gladly have closed her eyes to every horror
perpetrated in France; she would not have known what went on in
Paris; she wanted her husband! And yet, month after month, with but
short intervals, she saw him risk that precious life of his, which
was the very essence of her own soul, for others! for others!
always for others!</p>

<p>And she! she! Marguerite, his wife, was powerless to hold him
back! Powerless to keep him beside her, when that mad fit of
passion seized him to go on one of those wild quests, wherefrom she
always feared he could not return alive: and this, although she
might use every noble artifice, every tender wile of which a loving
and beautiful wife is capable.</p>

<p>At times like those her own proud heart was filled with hatred
and with envy towards everything that took him away from her: and
to-night all these passionate feelings, which she felt were quite
unworthy of her and of him, seemed to surge within her soul more
tumultuously than ever. She was longing to throw herself in his
arms, to pour out into his loving ear all that she suffered, in
fear and anxiety, and to make one more appeal to his tenderness and
to that passion which had so often made him forget the world at her
feet.</p>

<p>And so instinctively she walked along the terrace towards that
more secluded part of the garden just above the river bank, where
she had so oft wandered hand in hand with him in the honeymoon of
their love. There great clumps of old-fashioned cabbage roses grew
in untidy splendour, and belated lilies sent intoxicating odours
into the air, whilst the heavy masses of Egyptian and Michaelmas
daisies looked like ghostly constellations in the gloom.</p>

<p>She thought Percy must soon be coming this way. Though it was so
late, she knew that he would not go to bed. After the events of the
night, his ruling passion, strong in death, would be holding him in
its thrall.</p>

<p>She, too, felt wide awake and unconscious of fatigue; when she
reached the secluded path beside the river, she peered eagerly up
and down, and listened for a sound.</p>

<p>Presently it seemed to her that above the gentle clapper of the
waters she could hear a rustle and the crunching of the fine gravel
under carefully measured footsteps. She waited awhile. The
footsteps seemed to draw nearer, and soon, although the starlit
night was very dark, she perceived a cloaked and hooded figure
approaching cautiously towards her.</p>

<p>"Who goes there?" she called suddenly.</p>

<p>The figure paused: then came rapidly forward, and a voice said
timidly:</p>

<p>"Ah! Lady Blakeney!"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Marguerite peremptorily.</p>

<p>"It is I, D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille," replied the midnight
prowler.</p>

<p>"Demoiselle Candeille!" ejaculated Marguerite, wholly taken by
surprise. "What are you doing here, alone, and at this hour?"</p>

<p>"Sh-sh-sh" whispered Candeille eagerly, as she approached quite
close to Marguerite and drew her hood still lower over her eyes. "I
am all alone...I wanted to see some one&mdash;you, if possible,
Lady Blakeney...for I could not rest...I wanted to know what had
happened."</p>

<p>"What had happened? When? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"What happened between Citizen Chauvelin and your husband?"
asked Candeille.</p>

<p>"What is that to you?" replied Marguerite haughtily.</p>

<p>"I pray you, do not misunderstand me..." pleaded Candeille
eagerly. "I know my presence in your house...the quarrel which I
provoked must have filled your heart with hatred and suspicion
towards me...But oh! how can I persuade you?...I acted
unwillingly...will you not believe me?...I was that man's
tool...and...Oh God!" she added with sudden, wild vehemence, "if
only you could know what tyranny that accursed Government of France
exercises over poor helpless women or men who happen to have fallen
within reach of its relentless clutches..."</p>

<p>Her voice broke down in a sob: Marguerite hardly knew what to
say or think. She had always mistrusted this woman, with her
theatrical ways and stagey airs, from the very first moment that
she saw her in the tent on the green: and she did not wish to run
counter against her instinct in anything pertaining to the present
crisis. And yet, in spite of her mistrust, the actress's vehement
words found an echo in the depths of her own heart. How well she
knew what tyranny of which Candeille spoke with such bitterness.
Had she not suffered from it, endured terrible sorrow and
humiliation, when under the hand of that same appalling tyranny she
had betrayed the identity&mdash;then unknown to her&mdash;of the
Scarlet Pimpernel?</p>

<p>Therefore when Candeille paused after those last excited words,
she said with more gentleness than she had shown hitherto, though
still quite coldly:</p>

<p>"But you have not yet told me why you came back here to-night?
If Citizen Chauvelin was your taskmaster, then you must know all
that has occurred."</p>

<p>"I had a vague hope that I might see you."</p>

<p>"For what purpose?"</p>

<p>"To warn you if I could."</p>

<p>"I need no warning."</p>

<p>"Or are you too proud to take one? Do you know, Lady Blakeney,
that Citizen Chauvelin has a personal hatred against your
husband?"</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" asked Marguerite, with her suspicions
once more on the qui-vive. She could not understand Candeille's
attitude. This midnight visit, the vehemence of her language, the
strange mixture of knowledge and ignorance which she displayed.
What did this woman know of Chauvelin's secret plans? Was she his
open ally, or his helpless tool? And was she even now playing a
part taught her or commanded her by that prince of intriguers?</p>

<p>Candeille, however, seemed quite unaware of the spirit of
antagonism and mistrust which Marguerite took but little pains now
to disguise. She clasped her hands together, and her voice shook
with the earnestness of her entreaty:</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said eagerly, "have I not seen that look of hatred in
Chauvelin's eyes? He hates your husband I tell you...Why I know
not...but he hates him and means that great harm shall come to Sir
Percy through this absurd duel...Oh! Lady Blakeney, do not let him
go...I entreat you, do not let him go!"</p>

<p>But Marguerite proudly drew back a step or two, away from the
reach of those hands, stretched out towards her in such vehement
appeal.</p>

<p>"You are overwrought, Mademoiselle," she said coldly. "Believe
me, I have no need either of your entreaties or of your warning...I
should like you to think that I have no wish to be
ungrateful...that I appreciate any kind thought you may have
harboured for me in your mind...But beyond that...please forgive me
if I say it somewhat crudely&mdash;I do not feel that the matter
concerns you in the least...The hour is late," she added more
gently, as if desiring to attenuate the harshness of her last
words. "Shall I send my maid to escort you home? She is devoted and
discreet..."</p>

<p>"Nay!" retorted the other in tones of quiet sadness, "there is
no need of discretion...I am not ashamed of my visit to you
to-night...You are very proud, and for your sake I will pray to God
that sorrow and humiliation may not come to you, as I feared...We
are never likely to meet again, Lady Blakeney...you will not wish
it, and I shall have passed out of your life as swiftly as I had
entered into it...But there was another thought lurking in my mind
when I came to-night...In case Sir Percy goes to France, the duel
is to take place in or near Boulogne...this much I do know...would
you not wish to go with him?"</p>

<p>"Truly, Mademoiselle, I must repeat to you..."</p>

<p>"That 'tis no concern of mine...I know...I own that...But, you
see, when I came back here to-night in the silence and the
darkness&mdash;I had not guessed that you would be so proud...I
thought that I, a woman, would know how to touch your womanly
heart...I was clumsy I suppose...I made so sure that you would wish
to go with your husband, in case...in case he insisted on running
his head into the noose, which I feel sure Chauvelin has prepared
for him...I myself start for France shortly. Citizen Chauvelin has
provided me with the necessary passport for myself and my maid, who
was to have accompanied me...Then, just now, when I was all alone
and thought over all the mischief which that fiend had forced me to
do for him, it seemed to me that perhaps..."</p>

<p>She broke off abruptly, and tried to read the other woman's face
in the gloom. But Marguerite, who was taller than the Frenchwoman,
was standing, very stiff and erect, giving the young actress
neither discouragement nor confidence. She did not interrupt
Candeille's long and voluble explanation: vaguely she wondered what
it all was about, and even now, when the Frenchwoman paused,
Marguerite said nothing, but watched her quietly as she took a
folded paper from the capacious pocket of her cloak and then held
it out with a look of timidity towards Lady Blakeney.</p>

<p>"My maid need not come with me," said D&eacute;sir&eacute;e
Candeille humbly; "I would far rather travel alone...this is her
passport, and...Oh! you need not take it out of my hand," she added
in tones of bitter self-deprecation, as Marguerite made no sign of
taking the paper from her. "See! I will leave it here among the
roses!...You mistrust me now...it is only natural...presently,
perhaps, calmer reflection will come...you will see that my purpose
now is selfless...that I only wish to serve you and him."</p>

<p>She stooped and placed the folded paper in the midst of a great
clump of centifolium roses, and then without another word she
turned and went her way. For a few moments, whilst Marguerite still
stood there, puzzled and vaguely moved, she could hear the gentle
frou-frou of the other woman's skirts against the soft sand of the
path, and then a long-drawn sigh that sounded like a sob.</p>

<p>Then all was still again. The gentle midnight breeze caressed
the tops of the ancient oaks and elms behind her, drawing murmurs
from their dying leaves like unto the whisperings of ghosts.</p>

<p>Marguerite shuddered with a slight sense of cold. Before her,
amongst the dark clump of leaves and the roses invisible in the
gloom, there fluttered with a curious, melancholy flapping, the
folded paper placed there by Candeille. She watched it for awhile,
as, disturbed by the wind, it seemed ready to take its flight
towards the river. Anon it fell to the ground, and Marguerite, with
sudden overpowering impulse, stooped and picked it up. Then
clutching it nervously in her hand, she walked rapidly back towards
the house.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15" id=
"Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
Farewell</b>
</h2>

<p>As she neared the terrace, she became conscious of several forms
moving about at the foot of the steps, some few feet below where
she was standing. Soon she saw the glimmer of lanthorns, heard
whispering voices, and the lapping of the water against the side of
a boat.</p>

<p>Anon a figure, laden with cloaks and sundry packages passed down
the steps close beside her. Even in the darkness Marguerite
recognised Benyon, her husband's confidential valet. Without a
moment's hesitation, she flew along the terrace towards the wing of
the house occupied by Sir Percy. She had not gone far before she
discerned his tall figure walking leisurely along the path which
here skirted part of the house.</p>

<p>He had on his large caped coat, which was thrown open in front,
displaying a grey travelling suit of fine cloth; his hands were as
usual buried in the pockets of his breeches, and on his head he
wore the folding chapeau-bras which he habitually affected.</p>

<p>Before she had time to think, or to realise that he was going,
before she could utter one single word, she was in his arms,
clinging to him with passionate intensity, trying in the gloom to
catch every expression of his eyes, every quiver of the face now
bent down so close to her.</p>

<p>"Percy, you cannot go...you cannot go!..." she pleaded.</p>

<p>She had felt his strong arms closing round her, his lips seeking
hers, her eyes, her hair, her clinging hands, which dragged at his
shoulders in a wild agony of despair.</p>

<p>"If you really loved me, Percy," she murmured, "you would not
go, you would not go..."</p>

<p>He would not trust himself to speak; it well-nigh seemed as if
his sinews cracked with the violent effort at self-control. Oh! how
she loved him, when she felt in him the passionate lover, the wild,
untamed creature that he was at heart, on whom the frigid
courtliness of manner sat but as a thin veneer. This was his own
real personality, and there was little now of the elegant and
accomplished gentleman of fashion, schooled to hold every emotion
in check, to hide every thought, every desire save that for
amusement or for display.</p>

<p>She&mdash;feeling her power and his weakness now&mdash;gave
herself wholly to his embrace, not grudging one single, passionate
caress, yielding her lips to him, the while she murmured:</p>

<p>"You cannot go...you cannot...why should you go?...It is madness
to leave me...I cannot let you go..."</p>

<p>Her arms clung tenderly round him, her voice was warm and
faintly shaken with suppressed tears, and as he wildly murmured:
"Don't! for pity's sake!" she almost felt that her love would be
triumphant.</p>

<p>"For pity's sake, I'll go on pleading, Percy!" she whispered;
"oh! my love, my dear! do not leave me!...we have scarce had time
to savour our happiness...we have such arrears of joy to make
up...Do not go, Percy...there's so much I want to say to you...Nay!
you shall not! you shall not!" she added with sudden vehemence.
"Look me straight in the eyes, my dear, and tell me if you can
leave me now?"</p>

<p>He did not reply, but, almost roughly, he placed his hand over
her tear-dimmed eyes, which were turned up to his in an agony of
tender appeal. Thus he blindfolded her with that wild caress. She
should not see&mdash;no, not even she!&mdash;that for the space of
a few seconds stern manhood was well-nigh vanquished by the magic
of her love.</p>

<p>All that was most human in him, all that was weak in this strong
and untamed nature, cried aloud for peace and luxury and idleness:
for long summer afternoons spent in lazy content, for the
companionship of horses and dogs and of flowers, with no thought or
cares save those for the next evening's gavotte, no graver
occupation save that of sitting at <i>her</i> feet.</p>

<p>And during these few seconds, whilst his hand lay across her
eyes, the lazy, idle fop of fashionable London was fighting a
hand-to-hand fight with the bold leader of a band of adventurers:
and his own passionate love for his wife ranged itself with fervent
intensity on the side of his weaker self. Forgotten were the
horrors of the guillotine, the calls of the innocent, the appeal of
the helpless, forgotten the daring adventures, the excitements, the
hair's-breadth escapes: for those few seconds, heavenly in
themselves, he only remembered her&mdash;his wife&mdash;her beauty
and her tender appeal to him.</p>

<p>She would have pleaded again, for she felt that she was winning
in this fight: her instinct&mdash;that unerring instinct of the
woman who loves and feels herself beloved&mdash;told her that for
the space of an infinitesimal fraction of time, his iron will was
inclinded to bend; but he checked her pleading with a kiss.</p>

<p>Then there came the change.</p>

<p>Like a gigantic wave carried inwards by the tide, his turbulent
emotion seemed suddenly to shatter itself against a rock of
self-control. Was it a call from the boatmen below? a distant
scrunching of feet upon the gravel?&mdash;who knows, perhaps only a
sigh in the midnight air, a ghostly summons from the land of dreams
that recalled him to himself.</p>

<p>Even as Marguerite was still clinging to him, with the ardent
fervour of her own passion, she felt the rigid tension of his arms
relax, the power of his embrace weaken, the wild love-light become
dim in his eyes.</p>

<p>He kissed her fondly, tenderly, and with infinite gentleness
smoothed away the little damp curls from her brow. There was a
wistfulness now in his caress, and in his kiss there was the
finality of a long farewell.</p>

<p>"'Tis time I went," he said, "or we shall miss the tide."</p>

<p>These were the first coherent words he had spoken since first
she had met him here in this lonely part of the garden, and his
voice was perfectly steady, conventional, and cold. An icy pang
shot through Marguerite's heart. It was as if she had been abruptly
wakened from a beautiful dream.</p>

<p>"You are not going, Percy!" she murmured, and her own voice now
sounded hollow and forced. "Oh! if you loved me you would not
go!"</p>

<p>"If I loved you!"</p>

<p>Nay! in this at least there was no dream! No coldness in his
voice when he repeated those words with such a sigh of tenderness,
such a world of longing, that the bitterness of her great pain
vanished, giving place to tears. He took her hand in his. The
passion was momentarily conquered, forced within his innermost
soul, by his own alter ego, that second personality in him, the
cold-blooded and coolly-calculating adventurer who juggled with his
life and tossed it recklessly upon the sea of chance 'twixt a
doggrel and a smile. But the tender love lingered on, fighting the
enemy a while longer, the wistful desire was there for her kiss,
the tired longing for the exquisite repose of her embrace.</p>

<p>He took her hand in his, and bent his lips to it, and with the
warmth of his kiss upon it, she felt a moisture like a tear.</p>

<p>"I must go, dear," he said after a little while.</p>

<p>"Why? Why?" she repeated obstinately. "Am I nothing, then? Is my
life of no account? My sorrows? My fears? My misery? Oh!" she
added, with vehement bitterness, "why should it always be others?
What are others to you and to me, Percy?...Are we not happy
here?...Have you not fulfilled to its uttermost that self-imposed
duty to people who can be nothing to us?...Is not your life ten
thousand times more precious to me than the lives of ten thousand
others?"</p>

<p>Even through the darkness, and because his face was so close to
hers, she could see a quaint little smile playing round the corners
of his mouth.</p>

<p>"Nay, m'dear," he said gently, "'tis not ten thousand lives that
call to me to-day...only one at best...Don't you hate to think of
that poor little old cur&eacute; sitting in the midst of his ruined
pride and hopes: the jewels so confidently entrusted to his care
stolen from him, he waiting, perhaps, in his little presbytery for
the day when those brutes will march him to prison and to
death...Nay! I think a little sea voyage and English country air
would suit the Abb&eacute; Foucquet, m'dear, and I only mean to ask
him to cross the Channel with me?..."</p>

<p>"Percy!" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"Oh! I know! I know!" he rejoined with that short deprecatory
sigh of his, which seemed always to close any discussion between
them on that point, "you are thinking of that absurd duel..." He
laughed lightly, good-humouredly, and his eyes gleamed with
merriment.</p>

<p>"La, m'dear!" he said gaily, "will you not reflect a moment?
Could I refuse the challenge before His Royal Highness and the
ladies? I couldn't...Faith! that was it...Just a case of
couldn't...Fate did it all...the quarrel...my interference, the
challenge...<i>He</i> had planned it all, of course...Let us own
that he is a brave man, seeing that he and I are not even yet for
that beating he gave me on the Calais cliffs."</p>

<p>"Yes! he has planned it all," she retorted vehemently. "The
quarrel to-night, your journey to France, your meeting with him
face to face at a given hour and place where he can most readily,
most easily close the death-trap upon you."</p>

<p>This time he broke into a laugh. A good, hearty laugh, full of
the joy of living, of the madness and intoxication of a bold
adventure, a laugh that had not one particle of anxiety or of
tremor in it.</p>

<p>"Nay! m'dear!" he said, "but your ladyship is
astonishing...Close a death-trap upon your humble servant?...Nay!
the governing citizens of France will have to be very active and
mighty wide-awake ere they succeed in stealing a march on
me...Zounds! but we'll give them an exciting chase this time...Nay,
little woman, do not fear!" he said with sudden infinite
gentleness; "those demmed murderers have not got me yet."</p>

<p>Oh! how often she had fought with him thus: with him, the
adventurer, the part of his dual nature that was her bitter enemy,
and which took him, the lover, away from her side. She knew so well
the finality of it all, the amazing hold which that unconquerable
desire for these mad adventurers had upon him. Impulsive, ardent as
she was, Marguerite felt in her very soul an overwhelming fury
against herself for her own weakness, her own powerlessness in the
face of that which for ever threatened to ruin her life and her
happiness.</p>

<p>Yes! and his also! for he loved her! he loved her! he loved her!
The thought went on hammering in her mind, for she knew of its
great truth. He loved her and went away! And she, poor, puny
weakling, was unable to hold him back; the tendrils which fastened
his soul to hers were not so tenacious as those which made him
cling to suffering humanity, over there in France, where men and
women were in fear of death and torture, and looked upon the
elusive and mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel as a heaven-born hero sent
to save them from their doom. To them at these times his very
heart-strings seemed to turn with unconquerable force, and when,
with all the ardour of her own passion, she tried to play upon the
cords of his love for her, he could not respond, for they&mdash;the
strangers&mdash;had the stronger claim.</p>

<p>And yet through it all she knew that this love of humanity, this
mad desire to serve and to help, in no way detracted from his love
for her. Nay, it intensified it, made it purer and better, adding
to the joy of perfect intercourse the poetic and subtle fragrance
of ever-recurring pain.</p>

<p>But now at last she felt weary of the fight: her heart was
aching, bruised and sore. An infinite fatigue seemed to weight like
lead upon her very soul. This seemed so different to any other
parting, that had perforce been during the past year. The presence
of Chauvelin in her house, the obvious planning of this departure
for France, had filled her with a foreboding, nay, almost a
certitude of a gigantic and deadly cataclysm.</p>

<p>Her senses began to reel; she seemed not to see anything very
distinctly: even the loved form took on a strange and ghost-like
shape. He now looked preternaturally tall, and there was a mist
between her and him.</p>

<p>She thought that he spoke to her again, but she was not quite
sure, for his voice sounded like some weird and mysterious echo. A
bouquet of climbing heliotrope close by threw a fragrance into the
evening air, which turned her giddy with its overpowering
sweetness.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes, for she felt as if she must die, if she
held them open any longer; and as she closed them it seemed to her
as if he folded her in one last, long, heavenly embrace.</p>

<p>He felt her graceful figure swaying in his arms like a tall and
slender lily bending to the wind. He saw that she was but
half-conscious, and thanked heaven for this kindly solace to this
heart-breaking farewell.</p>

<p>There was a sloping, mossy bank close by, there where the marble
terrace yielded to the encroaching shrubbery: a tangle of pale pink
monthly roses made a bower overhead. She was just sufficiently
conscious to enable him to lead her to this soft green couch. There
he laid her amongst the roses, kissed the dear, tired eyes, her
hands, her lips, her tiny feet, and went.</p>

The Passport</b>
</h2>

<p>The rhythmic clapper of oars roused Marguerite from this
trance-like swoon.</p>

<p>In a moment she was on her feet, all her fatigue gone, her
numbness of soul and body vanished as in a flash. She was fully
conscious now!&mdash;conscious that he had gone!&mdash;that,
according to every probability under heaven and every machination
concocted in hell, he would never return from France alive, and
that she had failed to hear the last words which he spoke to her,
had failed to glean his last look or to savour his final kiss.</p>

<p>Though the night was starlit and balmy, it was singularly dark,
and vainly did Marguerite strain her eyes to catch sight of that
boat which was bearing him away so swiftly now: she strained her
ears, vaguely hoping to catch one last, lingering echo of his
voice. But all was silence, save that monotonous clapper, which
seemed to beat against her heart like a rhythmic knell of
death.</p>

<p>She could hear the oars distinctly: there were six or eight she
thought: certainly no fewer. Eight oarsmen probably, which meant
the larger boat, and undoubtedly the longer journey...not to London
only, with a view to posting to Dover, but to Tilbury Fort where
the <i>Day Dream</i> would be in readiness to start with a
favourable tide.</p>

<p>Thought was returning to her, slowly and coherently: the pain of
the last farewell was still there, bruising her very senses with
its dull and heavy weight; but it had become numb and dead, leaving
her, herself, her heart and soul, stunned and apathetic, whilst her
brain was gradually resuming its activity.</p>

<p>And the more she thought it over, the more certain she grew that
her husband was going as far as Tilbury by river, and would embark
on the <i>Day Dream</i> there. Of course, he would go to Boulogne
at once. The duel was to take place there, Candeille had told her
that...adding that she thought, she, Marguerite would wish to go
with him.</p>

<p>To go with him!</p>

<p>Heavens above! was not that the only real, tangible, thought in
that whirling chaos which was raging in her mind?</p>

<p>To go with him! Surely there must be some means of reaching him
yet! Fate, Nature, God Himself would never permit so monstrous a
thing as this: that she should be parted from her husband, now when
his life was not only in danger, but forfeit already...lost...a
precious thing all but gone from this world.</p>

<p>Percy was going to Boulogne...she must go too. By posting at
once to Dover, she could get the tidal boat on the morrow and reach
the French coast quite as soon as the <i>Day Dream</i>. Once at
Boulogne, she would have no difficulty in finding her husband, of
that she felt sure. She would have but to dog Chauvelin's
footsteps, find out something of his plans, of the orders he gave
to troops or to spies&mdash;oh! she would find him!&mdash;of that
she was never for a moment in doubt!</p>

<p>How well she remembered her journey to Calais just a year ago,
in company with Sir Andrew Ffoulkes! Chance had favoured her then,
had enabled her to be of service to her husband, if only by
distracting Chauvelin's attention for awhile to herself. Heaven
knows! she had but little hope of being of use to him now: an
aching sense was in her that fate had at last been too
strong!&mdash;that the daring adventurer had staked once too often,
had cast the die and had lost.</p>

<p>In the bosom of her dress she felt the sharp edge of the paper
left for her by D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille among the roses in
the park. She had picked it up almost mechanically then, and tucked
it away, hardly heeding what she was doing. Whatever the motive of
the French actress had been in placing the passport at her
disposal, Marguerite blessed her in her heart for it. To the woman
she had mistrusted, she would owe the last supreme happiness of her
life.</p>

<p>Her resolution never once wavered. Percy would not take her with
him: that was understandable. She could neither expect it nor think
it. But she, on the other hand, could not stay in England, at
Blakeney Manor, whilst any day, any hour, the death-trap set by
Chauvelin for the Scarlet Pimpernel might be closing upon the man
whom she worshipped. She would go mad if she stayed. As there could
be no chance of escape for Percy now, as he had agreed to meet his
deadly enemy face to face at a given place, and a given hour, she
could not be a hindrance to him: and she knew enough subterfuges,
enough machinations and disguises by now, to escape Chauvelin's
observation, unless...unless Percy wanted her, and then she would
be there.</p>

<p>No! she could not be a hindrance. She had a passport in her
pocket, everything en r&egrave;gle, nobody could harm her, and she
could come and go as she pleased. There were plenty of swift horses
in the stables, plenty of devoted servants to do her bidding
quickly and discreetly: moreover, at moments like these,
conventionalities and the possible conjectures and surmises of
others became of infinitesimally small importance. The household of
Blakeney Manor were accustomed to the master's sudden journeys and
absences of several days, presumably on some shooting or other
sporting expeditions, with no one in attendance on him, save
Benyon, his favourite valet. These passed without any comments now!
Bah! let everyone marvel for once at her ladyship's sudden desire
to go to Dover, and let it all be a nine days' wonder; she
certainly did not care. Skirting the house, she reached the stables
beyond. One or two men were still astir. To these she gave the
necessary orders for her coach and four, then she found her way
back to the house.</p>

<p>Walking along the corridor, she went past the room occupied by
Juliette de Marny. For a moment she hesitated, then she turned and
knocked at the door.</p>

<p>Juliette was not yet in bed, for she went to the door herself
and opened it. Obviously she had been quite unable to rest, her
hair was falling loosely over her shoulders, and there was a look
of grave anxiety on her young face.</p>

<p>"Juliette," said Marguerite in a hurried whisper, the moment she
had closed the door behind her and she and the young girl were
alone, "I am going to France to be near my husband. He has gone to
meet that fiend in a duel which is nothing but a trap, set to
capture him and lead him to his death. I want you to be of help to
me, here in my house, in my absence."</p>

<p>"I would give my life for you, Lady Blakeney," said Juliette
simply, "is it not <i>his</i> since he saved it?"</p>

<p>"It is only a little presence of mind, a little coolness and
patience, which I will ask of you, dear," said Marguerite. "You, of
course, know who your rescuer was, therefore you will understand my
fears. Until to-night I had vague doubts as to how much Chauvelin
really knew, but now these doubts have naturally vanished. He and
the French Revolutionary Government know that the Scarlet Pimpernel
and Percy Blakeney are one and the same. The whole scene to-night
was pre-arranged: you and I and all the other spectators, and that
woman Candeille&mdash;we were all puppets piping to that devil's
tune. The duel, too, was pre-arranged!...that woman wearing your
mother's jewels!...Had you not provoked her, a quarrel between her
and me, or one of my guests, would have been forced somehow...I
wanted to tell you this, lest you should fret, and think that you
were in any way responsible for what has happened...You were
not...He had arranged it all...You were only the tool...just as I
was...You must understand and believe that...Percy would hate to
think that you felt yourself to blame...You are not that, in any
way...The challenge was bound to come...Chauvelin had arranged that
it should come, and if you had failed him as a tool he soon would
have found another! Do you believe that?"</p>

<p>"I believe that you are an angel of goodness, Lady Blakeney,"
replied Juliette, struggling with her tears, "and that you are the
only woman in the world worthy to be his wife."</p>

<p>"But," insisted Marguerite firmly, as the young girl took her
cold hand in her own, and, gently fondling it, covered it with
grateful kisses, "but if...if anything happens...anon...you will
believe firmly that you were in no way responsible?...that you were
innocent...and merely a blind tool?..."</p>

<p>"God bless you for that!"</p>

<p>"You will believe it?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"And now for my request," rejoined Lady Blakeney in a more
quiet, more matter-of-fact tone of voice.</p>

<p>"You must represent me, here, when I am gone: explain as
casually and as naturally as you can that I have gone to join my
husband on his yacht for a few days. Lucie, my maid, is devoted,
and a tower of secrecy; she will stand between you and the rest of
the household in concocting some plausible story. To every friend
who calls, to anyone of our world whom you may meet, you must tell
the same tale, and if you note an air of incredulity in anyone, if
you hear whispers of there being some mystery&mdash;well! let the
world wag its busy tongue&mdash;I care less than nought: it will
soon tire of me and my doings, and having torn my reputation to
shreds, will quickly leave me in peace. But to Sir Andrew
Ffoulkes," she added earnestly, "tell the whole truth from me. He
will understand and do as he thinks right."</p>

<p>"I will do all you ask, Lady Blakeney, and am proud to think
that I shall be serving you, even in so humble and easy a capacity.
When do you start?"</p>

<p>"At once. Good-bye, Juliette."</p>

<p>She bent down to the young girl and kissed her tenderly on the
forehead, then she glided out of the room as rapidly as she had
come. Juliette, of course, did not try to detain her, or to force
her help or companionship on her when, obviously, she would wish to
be alone.</p>

<p>Marguerite quickly reached her room. Her maid Lucie was already
waiting for her. Devoted and silent as she was, one glance at her
mistress' face told her that trouble&mdash;grave and
imminent&mdash;had reached Blakeney Manor.</p>

<p>Marguerite, whilst Lucie undressed her, took up the passport and
carefully perused the personal description of one C&eacute;line
Dumont, maid to Citizeness D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille, which
was given therein: tall, blue eyes, light hair, age about
twenty-five. It all might have been vaguely meant for her. She had
a dark cloth gown, and long black cloak with hood to come well over
the head. These she now donned, with some thick shoes, and a
dark-coloured handkerchief tied over her head under the hood, so as
to hide the golden glory of her hair.</p>

<p>She was quite calm and in no haste. She made Lucie pack a small
hand valise with some necessaries for the journey, and provided
herself plentifully with money&mdash;French and English
notes&mdash;which she tucked well away inside her dress.</p>

<p>Then she bade her maid, who was struggling with her tears, a
kindly farewell, and quickly went down to her coach.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17" id=

Boulogne</b>
</h2>

<p>During the journey Marguerite had not much leisure to think. The
discomforts and petty miseries incidental on cheap travelling had
the very welcome effect of making her forget, for the time being,
the soul-rending crisis through which she was now passing.</p>

<p>For, of necessity, she had to travel at the cheap rate, among
the crowd of poorer passengers who were herded aft the packet boat,
leaning up against one another, sitting on bundles and packages of
all kinds; that part of the deck, reeking with the smell of tar and
sea-water, damp, squally, and stuffy, was an abomination of hideous
discomfort to the dainty fastidious lady of fashion, yet she almost
welcomed the intolerable propinquity, the cold douches of salt
water, which every now and then wetted her through and through, for
it was the consequent sense of physical wretchedness that helped
her to forget the intolerable anguish in her mind.</p>

<p>And among these poorer travellers she felt secure from
observation. No one took much notice of her. She looked just like
one of the herd, and in the huddled-up little figure in the dark,
bedraggled clothes, no one would for a moment have recognised the
dazzling personality of Lady Blakeney.</p>

<p>Drawing her hood well over her head, she sat in a secluded
corner of the deck, upon the little black valise which contained
the few belongings she had brought with her. Her cloak and dress,
now mud-stained and dank with splashings of salt water, attracted
no one's attention. There was a keen north-easterly breeze, cold
and penetrating, but favourable to a rapid crossing. Marguerite,
who had gone through several hours of weary travelling by coach
before she embarked at Dover in the late afternoon, was unspeakably
tired. She had watched the golden sunset out at sea until her eyes
were burning with pain, and as the dazzling crimson and orange and
purple gave place to the soft grey tones of evening, she descried
the round cupola of the church of Our Lady of Boulogne against the
dull background of the sky.</p>

<p>After that her mind became a blank. A sort of torpor fell over
her sense: she was wakeful and yet half-asleep, unconscious of
everything around her, seeing nothing but the distant massive
towers of old Boulogne churches gradually detaching themselves one
by one from out the fast-gathering gloom.</p>

<p>The town seemed like a dream city, a creation of some morbid
imagination, presented to her mind's eye as the city of sorrow and
of death.</p>

<p>When the boat finally scraped her sides along the rough wooden
jetty, Marguerite felt as if she were being forcibly awakened. She
was numb and stiff and thought she must have fallen asleep during
the last half-hour of the journey.</p>

<p>Everything round her was dark. The sky was overcast, and the
night seemed unusually sombre. Figures were moving all round her;
there was noise and confusion of voices, and a general pushing and
shouting, which seemed strangely weird in this gloom. Here, among
the poorer passengers, there had not been thought any necessity for
a light: one solitary lantern fixed to a mast only enhanced the
intense blackness of everything around. Now and then a face would
come within range of this meagre streak of yellow light, looking
strangely distorted, with great, elongated shadows across the brow
and chin, a grotesque, ghostly apparition, which quickly vanished
again, scurrying off like some frightened gnome, giving place to
other forms, other figures, all equally grotesque and equally
weird.</p>

<p>Marguerite watched them all half-stupidly and motionlessly for
awhile. She did not quite know what she ought to do, and did not
like to ask any questions: she was dazed and the darkness blinded
her. Then gradually things began to detach themselves more clearly.
On looking straight before her, she began to discern the
landing-place, the little wooden bridge across which the passengers
walked, one by one, from the boat on to the jetty. The first-class
passengers were evidently alighting now: the crowd, of which
Marguerite formed a unit, had been pushed back in a more compact
herd, out of the way for the moment so that their betters might get
along more comfortably.</p>

<p>Beyond the landing-stage a little booth had been erected, a kind
of tent, open in front and lighted up within by a couple of
lanthorns. Under this tent there was a table, behind which sat a
man dressed in some sort of official-looking clothes, and wearing
the tricolour scarf across his chest.</p>

<p>All the passengers from the boat had apparently to file past
this tent. Marguerite could see them now quite distinctly, the
profiles of the various faces, as they paused for a moment in front
of the table, being brilliantly illuminated by one of the lanterns.
Two sentinels, wearing the uniform of the National Guard, stood
each side of the table. The passengers, one by one, took out their
passport as they went by, handed it to the man in the official
dress, who examined it carefully, very lengthily, then signed it,
and returned the paper to its owner: but at times he appeared
doubtful, folded the passport, and put it down in front of him: the
passenger would protest; Marguerite could not hear what was said,
but she could see that some argument was attempted, quickly
dismissed by a peremptory order from the official. The doubtful
passport was obviously put on one side for further examination, and
the unfortunate owner thereof detained, until he or she had been
able to give more satisfactory references to the representatives of
the Committee of Public Safety stationed at Boulogne.</p>

<p>This process of examination necessarily took a long time.
Marguerite was getting horribly tired, her feet ached, and she
scarcely could hold herself upright: yet she watched all these
people mechanically, making absurd little guesses in her weary mind
as to whose passport would find favour in the eyes of the official
and whose would be found suspect and inadequate.</p>

<p>Suspect! a terrible word these times! since Merlin's terrible
law decreed now that every man, woman, or child, who was suspected
by the Republic of being a traitor, was a traitor in fact.</p>

<p>How sorry she felt for those whose passports were detained: who
tried to argue&mdash;so needlessly!&mdash;and who were finally led
off by a soldier, who had stepped out from somewhere in the dark,
and had to await further examination, probably imprisonment, and
often death.</p>

<p>As to herself, she felt quite safe: the passport given to her by
Chauvelin's own accomplice was sure to be quite en
r&egrave;gle.</p>

<p>Then suddenly her heart seemed to give a sudden leap and then to
stop in its beating for a second or two. In one of the passengers,
a man who was just passing in front of the tent, she had recognised
the form and profile of Chauvelin.</p>

<p>He had no passport to show, but evidently the official knew who
he was, for he stood up and saluted, and listened deferentially
whilst the ex-ambassador apparently gave him a few instructions. It
seemed to Marguerite that these instructions related to two women
who were close behind Chauvelin at the time, and who presently
seemed to file past without going through the usual formalities of
showing their passports. But of this she could not be quite sure.
The women were closely hooded and veiled, and her own attention had
been completely absorbed by this sudden appearance of her deadly
enemy.</p>

<p>Yet what more natural than that Chauvelin should be here now.
His object accomplished, he had no doubt posted to Dover, just as
she had done. There was no difficulty in that, and a man of his
type and importance would always have unlimited means and money at
his command to accomplish any journey he might desire to
undertake.</p>

<p>There was nothing strange or even unexpected in the man's
presence here; and yet somehow it had made the whole, awful reality
more tangible, more wholly unforgettable. Marguerite remembered his
abject words to her, when first she had seen him at the Richmond
f&ecirc;te: he said that he had fallen into disgrace, that, having
failed in his service to the Republic, he had been relegated to a
subordinate position, pushed aside with contumely to make room for
better, abler men.</p>

<p>Well! all that was a lie, of course, a cunning method of gaining
access into her house; of that she had already been convinced, when
Candeille provoked the esclandre which led to the challenge.</p>

<p>That on French soil he seemed in anything but a subsidiary
position, that he appeared to rule rather than to obey, could in no
way appear to Marguerite in the nature of surprise.</p>

<p>As the actress had been a willing tool in the cunning hands of
Chauvelin, so were probably all these people around her. When
others cringed in the face of officialism, the ex-ambassador had
stepped forth as a master: he had shown a badge, spoken a word
mayhap, and the man in the tent, who had made other people tremble,
stood up deferentially and obeyed all commands.</p>

<p>It was all very simple and very obvious: but Marguerite's mind
had been asleep, and it was the sight of the sable-clad little
figure which had roused it from its happy torpor.</p>

<p>In a moment now her brain was active and alert, and presently it
seemed to her as if another figure&mdash;taller than those
around&mdash;had crossed the barrier immediately in the wake of
Chauvelin. Then she chided herself for her fancies!</p>

<p>It could not be her husband. Not yet! He had gone by water, and
would scarce be in Boulogne before the morning!</p>

<p>Ah! now at last came the turn of the second-class passengers!
There was a general bousculade, and the human bundle began to move.
Marguerite lost sight of the tent and its awe-inspiring
appurtenances: she was a mere unit again in this herd on the move.
She, too, progressed along slowly, one step at a time; it was
wearisome and she was deadly tired. She was beginning to form plans
now that she had arrived in France. All along she had made up her
mind that she would begin by seeking out the Abb&eacute; Foucquet,
for he would prove a link 'twixt her husband and herself. She knew
that Percy would communicate with the abb&eacute;; had he not told
her that the rescue of the devoted old man from the clutches of the
Terrorists would be one of the chief objects of his journey? It had
never occurred to her what she would do if she found the
Abb&eacute; Foucquet gone from Boulogne.</p>

<p>"H&eacute;! la m&egrave;re! your passport!"</p>

<p>The rough words roused her from her meditations. She had moved
forward, quite mechanically, her mind elsewhere, her thoughts not
following the aim of her feet. Thus she must have crossed the
bridge along with some of the crowd, must have landed on the jetty
and reached the front of the tent, without really knowing what she
was doing.</p>

<p>Ah, yes! her passport! She had quite forgotten that! But she had
it by her, quite in order, given to her in a fit of tardy remorse
by Demoiselle Candeille, the intimate friend of one of the most
influential members of the Revolutionary Government of France.</p>

<p>She took the passport from the bosom of her dress and handed it
to the man in the official dress.</p>

<p>"Your name?" he asked peremptorily.</p>

<p>"C&eacute;line Dumont," she replied unhesitatingly, for had she
not rehearsed all this in her mind dozens of times, until her
tongue could rattle off the borrowed name as easily as it could her
own; "servitor to Citizeness D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille!"</p>

<p>The man, who had very carefully been examining the paper the
while, placed it down on the table deliberately in front of him,
and said:</p>

<p>"C&eacute;line Dumont! Eh! la m&egrave;re! what tricks are you
up to now?"</p>

<p>"Tricks? I don't understand!" she said quietly, for she was not
afraid. The passport was en r&egrave;gle: she knew she had nothing
to fear.</p>

<p>"Oh! but I think you do!" retorted the official with a sneer;
"and 'tis a mighty clever one, I'll allow. C&eacute;line Dumont, ma
foi! Not badly imagined, ma petite m&egrave;re: and all would have
passed off splendidly; unfortunately, C&eacute;line Dumont,
servitor to Citizeness Candeille, passed through these barriers
along with her mistress not half an hour ago."</p>

<p>And with long, grimy fingers he pointed to an entry in the large
book which lay open before him, and wherein he had apparently been
busy making notes of the various passengers who had filed past
him.</p>

<p>Then he looked up with a triumphant leer at the calm face of
Marguerite. She still did not feel really frightened, only puzzled
and perturbed; but all the blood had rushed away from her face,
leaving her cheeks ashen white, and pressing against her heart,
until it almost choked her.</p>

<p>"You are making a mistake, citizen," she said very quietly. "I
am Citizeness Candeille's maid. She gave me the passport herself,
just before I left England; if you will ask her the question, she
will confirm what I say, and she assured me that it was quite en
r&egrave;gle."</p>

<p>But the man only shrugged his shoulders and laughed derisively.
The incident evidently amused him, yet he must have seen so many of
the same sort; in the far corner of the tent Marguerite seemed to
discern a few moving forms, soldiers, she thought, for she caught
sight of a glint like that of steel. One or two men stood close
behind the official at the desk, and the sentinels were to the
right and left of the tent.</p>

<p>With an instinctive sense of appeal, Marguerite looked round
from one face to the other: but each looked absolutely impassive
and stolid, quite uninterested in this little scene, the exact
counterpart of a dozen others, enacted on this very spot within the
last hour.</p>

<p>"H&eacute;! l&agrave;! l&agrave;! petite m&egrave;re!" said the
official in the same tone of easy persiflage which he had adopted
all along; "but we do know how to concoct a pretty lie,
aye!&mdash;and so circumstantially too! Unfortunately it was
Citizeness D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille herself who happened to
be standing just where you are at the present moment, along with
her maid, C&eacute;line Dumont, both of whom were specially signed
for and recommended as perfectly trustworthy by no less a person
than Citoyen Chauvelin of the Committee of Public Safety."</p>

<p>"But I assure you that there is a mistake," pleaded Marguerite
earnestly. "'Tis the other woman who lied; I have my passport
and..."</p>

<p>"A truce on this," retorted the man peremptorily. "If everything
is as you say, and if you have nothing to hide, you'll be at
liberty to continue your journey to-morrow, after you have
explained yourself before the Citizen Governor. Next one now,
quick!"</p>

<p>Marguerite tried another protest, just as those others had done,
whom she had watched so mechanically before. But already she knew
that that would be useless, for she felt that a heavy hand was
being placed on her shoulder, and that she was being roughly led
away.</p>

<p>In a flash she had understood and seen the whole sequel of the
awful trap, which had all along been destined to engulf her as well
as her husband.</p>

<p>What a clumsy, blind fool she had been!</p>

<p>What a miserable antagonist to the subtle schemes of a past
master of intrigue as was Chauvelin. To have enticed the Scarlet
Pimpernel to France was a great thing! The challenge was clever,
the acceptance of it by the bold adventurer a foregone conclusion,
but the master stroke of the whole plan was done, when she, the
wife, was enticed over, too, with the story of Candeille's remorse
and the offer of the passport.</p>

<p>Fool! fool that she was!</p>

<p>And how well did Chauvelin know feminine nature! How cleverly he
had divined her thoughts, her feelings, the impulsive way in which
she would act; how easily he had guessed that, knowing her
husband's danger, she, Marguerite, would immediately follow
him.</p>

<p>Now the trap had closed on her&mdash;and she saw it all, when it
was too late.</p>

<p>Percy Blakeney in France! his wife a prisoner! her freedom and
safety in exchange for his life!</p>

<p>The hopelessness of it all struck her with appalling force, and
her senses reeled with the awful finality of the disaster.</p>

<p>Yet instinct in her still struggled for freedom. Ahead of her,
and all around her, beyond the tent and in the far distance, there
was a provocative, alluring darkness: if she only could get away,
only could reach the shelter of that remote and sombre distance,
she would hide, and wait, not blunder again&mdash;oh no! she would
be prudent and wary, if only she could get away!</p>

<p>One woman's struggles against five men! It was pitiable,
sublime, absolutely useless.</p>

<p>The man in the tent seemed to be watching her with much
amusement for a moment or two, as her whole, graceful body
stiffened for that absurd and unequal physical contest. He seemed
vastly entertained at the sight of this good-looking young woman
striving to pit her strength against five sturdy soldiers of the
Republic.</p>

<p>"Allons! that will do, now!" he said at last, roughly. "We have
no time to waste! Get the jade away, and let her cool her temper in
No. 6, until the Citizen Governor gives further orders."</p>

<p>"Take her away!" he shouted more loudly, banging a grimy fist
down on the table before him, as Marguerite still struggled on with
the blind madness of despair. "Pardi! can none of you rid us of
that turbulent baggage!"</p>

<p>The crowd behind were pushing forward: the guard within the tent
were jeering at those who were striving to drag Marguerite away:
these latter were cursing loudly and volubly, until one of them,
tired out, furious and brutal, raised his heavy fist and with an
obscene oath brought it crashing down upon the unfortunate woman's
head.</p>

<p>Perhaps, though it was the work of a savage and cruel creature,
the blow proved more merciful than it had been intended: it had
caught Marguerite full between the eyes; her aching senses, wearied
and reeling already, gave way beneath this terrible violence; her
useless struggles ceased, her arms fell inert by her side, and
losing consciousness completely, her proud unbendable spirit was
spared the humiliating knowledge of her final removal by the rough
soldiers, and of the complete wreckage of her last, lingering
hopes.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18" id=

No. 6</b>
</h2>

<p>Consciousness returned very slowly, very painfully.</p>

<p>It was night when last Marguerite had clearly known what was
going on around her; it was day-light before she realised that she
still lived, that she still knew and suffered.</p>

<p>Her head ached intolerably: that was the first conscious
sensation which came to her; then she vaguely perceived a pale ray
of sunshine, very hazy and narrow, which came from somewhere in
front of her, and struck her in the face. She kept her eyes tightly
shut, for that filmy light caused her an increase of pain.</p>

<p>She seemed to be lying on her back, and her fingers wandering
restlessly around felt a hard paillasse beneath their touch, then a
rough pillow, and her own cloak laid over her: thought had not yet
returned, only the sensation of great suffering and of infinite
fatigue.</p>

<p>Anon she ventured to open her eyes, and gradually one or two
objects detached themselves from out the haze which still obscured
her vision.</p>

<p>Firstly, the narrow aperture&mdash;scarcely a
window&mdash;filled in with tiny squares of coarse, unwashed glass,
through which the rays of the morning sun were making kindly
efforts to penetrate, then the cloud of dust illumined by those
same rays and made up&mdash;so it seemed to the poor tired brain
that strove to perceive&mdash;of myriads of abnormally large
molecules, over-abundant, and over-active, for they appeared to be
dancing a kind of wild saraband before Marguerite's aching eyes,
advancing and retreating, forming themselves into groups and taking
on funny shapes of weird masques and grotesque faces, which grinned
at the unconscious figure lying helpless on the rough paillase.</p>

<p>Through and beyond them Marguerite gradually became aware of
three walls of a narrow room, dank and grey, half covered with
whitewash and half with greenish mildew! Yes! and there, opposite
to her and immediately beneath that semblance of a window was
another paillasse, and on it something dark, that moved.</p>

<p>The words: "Libert&eacute;, Egalit&eacute;, Fraternit&eacute; ou
la Mort!" stared out at her from somewhere beyond those active
molecules of dust, but she also saw just above the other paillasse
the vague outline of a dark crucifix.</p>

<p>It seemed a terrible effort to co-ordinate all these things, and
to try and realise what the room was, and what was the meaning of
the paillasse, the narrow window and the stained walls, too much
altogether for the aching head to take in save very slowly, very
gradually.</p>

<p>Marguerite was content to wait and to let memory creep back as
reluctantly as it would.</p>

<p>"Do you think, my child, you could drink a little of this
now?"</p>

<p>It was a gentle, rather tremulous voice which struck upon her
ear. She opened her eyes, and noticed that the dark something which
had previously been on the opposite paillasse was no longer there,
and that there appeared to be a presence close to her only vaguely
defined, someone kindly and tender who had spoken to her in French,
with that soft sing-song accent peculiar to the Normandy peasants,
and who now seemed to be pressing something cool and soothing to
her lips.</p>

<p>"They gave me this for you!" continued the tremulous voice close
to her ear; "I think it would do you good, if you tried to take
it."</p>

<p>A hand and arm were thrust underneath the rough pillow, causing
her to raise her head a little. A glass was held to her lips and
she drank.</p>

<p>The hand that held the glass was all wrinkled, brown and dry,
and trembled slightly, but the arm which supported her head was
firm and very kind.</p>

<p>"There! I am sure you feel better now. Close your eyes again and
try to go to sleep."</p>

<p>She did as she was bid, and was ready enough to close her eyes.
It seemed to her presently as if something had been interposed
between her head and that trying ray of white September sun.</p>

<p>Perhaps she slept peacefully for a little while after that, for
though her head was still very painful, her mouth and throat felt
less parched and dry. Through this sleep, or semblance of sleep,
she was conscious of the same pleasant voice softly droning Paters
and Aves close to her ear.</p>

<p>Thus she lay during the greater part of that day. Not quite
fully conscious, not quite awake to the awful memories which anon
would crowd upon her thick and fast.</p>

<p>From time to time the same kind and trembling hand would with
gentle pressure force a little liquid food through her unwilling
lips: some warm soup, or anon a glass of milk. Beyond the pain in
her head, she was conscious of no physical ill; she felt at perfect
peace, and an extraordinary sense of quiet and repose seemed to
pervade this small room, with its narrow window, through which the
rays of the sun came gradually in more golden splendour as the day
drew towards noon, and then they vanished altogether.</p>

<p>The drony voice close beside her acted as a soporific upon her
nerves. In the afternoon she fell into a real and beneficent
sleep...</p>

<p>But after that she woke to full consciousness!</p>

<p>Oh! the horror, the folly of it all!</p>

<p>It came back to her with all the inexorable force of an
appalling certainty.</p>

<p>She was a prisoner in the hands of those who long ago had sworn
to bring the Scarlet Pimpernel to death!</p>

<p>She! his wife, a hostage in their hands! her freedom and safety
offered to him as the price of his own! Here there was no question
of dreams or of nightmares: no illusions as to the ultimate
intentions of her husband's enemies. It was all a reality, and even
now, before she had the strength fully to grasp the whole nature of
this horrible situation, she knew that, by her own act of mad and
passionate impulse, she had hopelessly jeopardised the life of the
man she loved.</p>

<p>For with that sublime confidence in him begotten of her love,
she never for a moment doubted which of the two alternatives he
would choose, when once they were placed before him. He would
sacrifice himself for her; he would prefer to die a thousand deaths
so long as they set her free.</p>

<p>For herself, her own sufferings, her danger or humiliation she
cared nothing! Nay! at this very moment she was conscious of a
wild, passionate desire for death...In this sudden onrush of memory
and of thought she wished with all her soul and heart and mind to
die here suddenly, on this hard paillasse, in this lonely and dark
prison...so that she should be out of the way once and for all...so
that she should <i>not</i> be the hostage to be bartered against
his precious life and freedom.</p>

<p>He would suffer acutely, terribly at her loss, because he loved
her above everything else on earth; he would suffer in every fibre
of his passionate and ardent nature, but he would not then have to
endure the humiliations, the awful alternatives, the galling
impotence and miserable death, the relentless "either-or" which his
enemies were even now preparing for him.</p>

<p>And then came a revulsion of feeling. Marguerite's was
essentially a buoyant and active nature, a keen brain which worked
and schemed and planned, rather than one ready to accept the
inevitable.</p>

<p>Hardly had these thoughts of despair and of death formulated
themselves in her mind, than, with brilliant swiftness, a new train
of ideas began to take root.</p>

<p>What if matters were not so hopeless after all?</p>

<p>Already her mind had flown instinctively to thoughts of escape.
Had she the right to despair? She, the wife and intimate companion
of the man who had astonished the world with his daring, his
prowess, his amazing good-luck, she to imagine for a moment that in
this all-supreme moment of his adventurous life the Scarlet
Pimpernel would fail!</p>

<p>Was not English society peopled with men, women, and children
whom his ingenuity had rescued from plights quite as seemingly
hopeless as was her own, and would not all the resources of that
inventive brain be brought to bear upon this rescue which touched
him nearer and more deeply than any which he had attempted
hitherto?</p>

<p>Now Marguerite was chiding herself for her doubts and for her
fears. Already she remembered that amidst the crowd on the landing
stage she had perceived a figure&mdash;unusually
tall&mdash;following in the wake of Chauvelin and his companions.
Awakened hope had already assured her that she had not been
mistaken, that Percy, contrary to her own surmises, had reached
Boulogne last night: he always acted so differently to what anyone
might expect, that it was quite possible that he had crossed over
in the packet-boat after all, unbeknown to Marguerite as well as to
his enemies.</p>

<p>Oh yes! the more she thought about it all, the more sure was she
that Percy was already in Boulogne, and that he knew of her capture
and her danger.</p>

<p>What right had she to doubt, even for a moment, that he would
know how to reach her, how&mdash;when the time came&mdash;to save
himself and her?</p>

<p>A warm glow began to fill her veins, she felt excited and alert,
absolutely unconscious now of pain or fatigue, in this radiant joy
of re-awakened hope.</p>

<p>She raised herself slightly, leaning on her elbow: she was still
very weak, and the slight movement had made her giddy, but soon she
would be strong and well...she must be strong and well and ready to
do his bidding, when the time for escape will have come.</p>

<p>"Ah! you are better, my child, I see..." said that quaint,
tremulous voice again, with its soft sing-song accent. "But you
must not be so venturesome, you know. The physician said that you
had received a cruel blow. The brain has been rudely shaken...and
you must lie quite still to-day, or your poor little head will
begin to ache again."</p>

<p>Marguerite turned to look at the speaker, and, in spite of her
excitement, of her sorrow, and of her anxieties, she could not help
smiling at the whimsical little figure which sat opposite to her,
on a very rickety chair, solemnly striving with slow and measured
movement of hand and arm, and a large supply of breath, to get up a
polish on the worn-out surface of an ancient pair of buckled
shoes.</p>

<p>The figure was slender and almost wizened, the thin shoulders
round with an habitual stoop, the lean shanks were encased in a
pair of much-darned, coarse black stockings. It was the figure of
an old man, with a gentle, clear-cut face furrowed by a forest of
wrinkles, and surmounted by scanty white locks above a smooth
forehead, which looked yellow and polished like an ancient piece of
ivory.</p>

<p>He had looked across at Marguerite as he spoke, and a pair of
innately kind and mild blue eyes were fixed with tender reproach
upon her. Marguerite thought that she had never seen quite so much
goodness and simple-heartedness portrayed on any face before. It
literally beamed out of those pale blue eyes, which seemed quite
full of unshed tears.</p>

<p>The old man wore a tattered garment, a miracle of shining
cleanliness, which had once been a soutane of smooth black cloth,
but was now a mass of patches and threadbare at shoulders and
knees. He seemed deeply intent in the task of polishing his shoes,
and having delivered himself of his little admonition, he very
solemnly and earnestly resumed his work.</p>

<p>Marguerite's first and most natural instinct had, of course,
been one of dislike and mistrust of any one who appeared to be in
some way on guard over her. But when she took in every detail of
the quaint figure of the old man, his scrupulous tidiness of
apparel, the resigned stoop of his shoulders, and met in full the
gaze of those moist eyes, she felt that the whole aspect of the
man, as he sat there polishing his shoes, was infinitely pathetic,
and, in its simplicity, commanding of respect.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Lady Blakeney at last, for the old man,
after looking at her with a kind of appealing wonder, seemed to be
waiting for her to speak.</p>

<p>"A priest of the good God, my dear child," replied the old man
with a deep sigh and a shake of his scanty locks, "who is not
allowed to serve his divine Master any longer. A poor old fellow,
very harmless and very helpless, who has been set here to watch
over you.</p>

<p>"You must not look upon me as a jailer because of what I say, my
child," he added with a quaint air of deference and apology. "I am
very old and very small, and only take up a very little room. I can
make myself very scarce, you shall hardly know that I am
here...They forced me to it, much against my will...But they are
strong and I am weak, how could I deny them since they put me here?
After all," he concluded na&iuml;vely, "perhaps it is the will of
le bon Dieu, and He knows best, my child, He knows best."</p>

<p>The shoes evidently refused to respond any further to the old
man's efforts at polishing them. He contemplated them now, with a
whimsical look of regret on his furrowed face, then set them down
on the floor and slipped his stockinged feet into them.</p>

<p>Marguerite was silently watching him, still leaning on her
elbow. Evidently her brain was still numb and fatigued, for she did
not seem able to grasp all that the old man said. She smiled to
herself, too, as she watched him. How could she look upon him as a
jailer? He did not seem at all like a Jacobin or a Terrorist, there
was nothing of the dissatisfied democrat, of the snarling anarchist
ready to lend his hand to any act of ferocity directed against a
so-called aristocrat, about this pathetic little figure in the
ragged soutane and worn shoes.</p>

<p>He seemed singularly bashful, too, and ill at eas, and loth to
meet Marguerite's great, ardent eyes, which were fixed
questioningly upon him.</p>

<p>"You must forgive me, my daughter," he said shyly, "for
concluding my toilet before you. I had hoped to be quite ready
before you woke, but I had some trouble with my shoes; except for a
little water and soap, the prison authorities will not provide us
poor captives with any means of cleanliness and tidiness, and le
bon Dieu does love a tidy body as well as a clean soul.</p>

<p>"But there, there," he added fussily, "I must not continue to
gossip like this. You would like to get up, I know, and refresh
your face and hands with a little water. Oh! you will see how well
I have thought it out. I need not interfere with you at all, and
when you make your little bit of toilette, you will feel quite
alone...just as if the old man was not there."</p>

<p>He began busying himself about the room, dragging the rickety,
rush-bottomed chairs forward. There were four of these in the room,
and he began forming a kind of bulwark with them, placing two side
by side, then piling the two others up above.</p>

<p>"You will see, my child, you will see!" he kept repeating at
intervals as the work of construction progressed. It was no easy
matter, for he was of low stature, and his hands were unsteady from
apparently uncontrollable nervousness.</p>

<p>Marguerite leaning slightly forward, her chin resting in her
hand, was too puzzled and anxious to grasp the humour of this
comical situation. She certainly did not understand. This old man
had in some sort of way, and for a hitherto unexplained reason,
been set as a guard over her; it was not an unusual device on the
part of the inhuman wretches who now ruled over France to add to
the miseries and terrors of captivity where a woman of refinement
was concerned, the galling outrage of never leaving her alone for a
moment.</p>

<p>That peculiar form of mental torture, surely the invention of
brains rendered mad by their own ferocious cruelty, was even now
being inflicted on the hapless, dethroned Queen of France.
Marguerite, in far-off England, had shuddered when she heard of it,
and in her heart had prayed, as indeed every pure-minded woman did
then, that proud, unfortunate Marie Antoinette might soon find
release from such torments in death.</p>

<p>There was evidently some similar intention with regard to
Marguerite herself in the minds of those who now held her prisoner.
But this old man seemed so feeble and so helpless, his very
delicacy of thought as he built up a screen to divide the squalid
room into two, proved him to be singularly inefficient for the task
of a watchful jailer.</p>

<p>When the four chairs appeared fairly steady, and in
comparatively little danger of toppling, he dragged the paillasse
forward and propped it up against the chairs. Finally he drew the
table along, which held the cracked ewer and basin, and placed it
against this improvised partition: then he surveyed the whole
construction with evident gratification and delight.</p>

<p>"There now!" he said, turning a face beaming with satisfaction
to Marguerite, "I can continue my prayers on the other side of the
fortress. Oh! it is quite safe..." he added, as with a fearsome
hand he touched his engineering feat with gingerly pride, "and you
will be quite private...Try and forget that the old abb&eacute; is
in the room...He does not count...really he does not count...he has
ceased to be of any moments these many months, now that Saint
Joseph is closed, and he may no longer say Mass."</p>

<p>He was obviously prattling on in order to hide his nervous
bashfulness. He ensconced himself behind his own finely constructed
bulwark, drew a breviary from his pocket, and having found a narrow
ledge on one of the chairs, on which he could sit, without much
danger of bringing the elaborate screen on to the top of his head,
he soon became absorbed in his orisons.</p>

<p>Marguerite watched him for a little while longer: he was
evidently endeavouring to make her think that he had become
oblivious of her presence, and his transparent little manoeuvres
amused and puzzled her not a little.</p>

<p>He looked so comical with his fussy and shy ways, yet withal so
gentle, and so kindly that she felt completely reassured and quite
calm.</p>

<p>She tried to raise herself still further, and found the process
astonishingly easy. Her limbs still ached, and the violent,
intermittent pain in her head certainly made her feel sick and
giddy at times, but otherwise she was not ill. She sat up on the
paillasse, then put her feet to the ground, and presently walked up
to the improvised dressing-room and bathed her face and hands. The
rest had done her good, and she felt quite capable of coordinating
her thoughts, of moving about without too much pain and of
preparing herself both mentally and physically for the grave events
which she knew must be imminent.</p>

<p>While she busied herself with her toilet her thoughts dwelt on
the one all-absorbing theme: Percy was in Boulogne; he would reach
her without fail; in fact, he might communicate with her at any
moment now, and had without a doubt already evolved a plan of
escape for her, more daring and ingenious than any which he had
conceived hitherto; therefore, she must be ready, and prepared for
any eventuality, she must be strong and eager, in no way
despondent, for if he were here, would he not chide her for her
want of faith.</p>

<p>By the time she had smoothed her hair and tidied her dress,
Marguerite caught herself singing quite cheerfully.</p>

<p>So full of buoyant hope was she.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19" id=
"Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
The Strength of the Weak</b>
</h2>

<p>"M. L'Abb&eacute;!..." said Marguerite gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes, mon enfant."</p>

<p>The old man looked up from his breviary and saw Marguerite's
great earnest eyes fixed with obvious calm and trust upon him. She
had finished her toilet as well as she could, had shaken up and
tidied the paillasse, and was now sitting on the edge of it, her
hands clasped between her knees. There was something which still
puzzled her, and, impatient and impulsive as she was, she had
watched the abb&eacute; as he calmly went on reading the Latin
prayers for the last five minutes, and now she could contain her
questionings no longer.</p>

<p>"You said just now that they set you to watch over me..."</p>

<p>"So they did, my child, so they did..." he replied with a sigh,
as he quietly closed his book and slipped it back into his pocket.
"Ah! they are very cunning...and we must remember that they have
the power. No doubt," added the old man, with his own quaint
philosophy, "no doubt le bon Dieu meant them to have the power, or
they would not have it, would they?"</p>

<p>"By'they' you mean the Terrorists and anarchists of France, M.
l'Abb&eacute;...The Committee of Public Safety who pillage and
murder, outrage women, and desecrate religion...Is that not
so?"</p>

<p>"Alas! my child!" he sighed.</p>

<p>"And it is'they' who have set you to watch over me?...I confess
I don't understand..."</p>

<p>She laughed, quite involuntarily indeed, for, in spite of the
reassurance in her heart, her brain was still in a whirl of
passionate anxiety.</p>

<p>"You don't look at all like one of'them,' M. l'Abb&eacute;," she
said.</p>

<p>"The good God forbid!" ejaculated the old man, raising
protesting hands up towards the very distant, quite invisible sky.
"How could I, a humble priest of the Lord, range myself with those
who would flout and defy Him."</p>

<p>"Yet I am a prisoner of the Republic and you are my jailer, M.
l'Abb&eacute;."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" he sighed. "But I am very helpless. This was my cell.
I had been here with Fran&ccedil;ois and F&eacute;licit&eacute;, my
sister's children, you know. Innocent lambs, whom those fiends
would lead to slaughter. Last night," he continued, speaking
volubly, "the soldiers came in and dragged Fran&ccedil;ois and
F&eacute;licit&eacute; out of this room, where, in spite of the
danger before us, in spite of what we suffered, we had contrived to
be quite happy together. I could read the Mass, and the dear
children would say their prayers night and morning at my knee."</p>

<p>He paused awhile. The unshed tears in his mild, blue eyes
struggled for freedom now, and one or two flowed slowly down his
wrinkled cheeks. Marguerite, though heart-sore and full of
agonising sorrow herself, felt her whole noble soul go out to this
kind old man, so pathetic, so high and simple-minded in his
grief.</p>

<p>She said nothing, however, and the abb&eacute; continued, after
a few seconds' silence.</p>

<p>"When the children had gone, they brought you in here, mon
enfant, and laid you on the paillasse where F&eacute;licit&eacute;
used to sleep. You looked very white, and stricken down, like one
of God's lambs attacked by the ravening wolf. Your eyes were closed
and you were blissfully unconscious. I was taken before the
governor of the prison, and he told me that you would share the
cell with me for a time, and that I was to watch you night and day,
because..."</p>

<p>The old man paused again. Evidently what he had to say was very
difficult to put into words. He groped in his pockets and brought
out a large bandana handkerchief, red and yellow and green, with
which he began to mop his moist forehead. The quaver in his voice
and the trembling of his hands became more apparent and
pronounced.</p>

<p>"Yes, M. l'Abb&eacute;? Because?..." queried Marguerite
gently.</p>

<p>"They said that if I guarded you well, F&eacute;licit&eacute;
and Fran&ccedil;ois would be set free," replied the old man after a
while, during which he made vigorous efforts to overcome his
nervousness, "and that if you escaped the children and I would be
guillotined the very next day."</p>

<p>There was silence in the little room now. The abb&eacute; was
sitting quite still, clasping his trembling fingers, and Marguerite
neither moved nor spoke. What the old man had just said was very
slowly finding its way to the innermost cells of her brain. Until
her mind had thoroughly grasped the meaning of it all, she could
not trust herself to make a single comment.</p>

<p>It was some seconds before she fully understood it all, before
she realised what it meant not only to her, but indirectly to her
husband. Until now she had not been fully conscious of the enormous
wave of hope which almost in spite of herself had risen triumphant
above the dull, gray sea of her former despair; only now, when it
had been shattered against this deadly rock of almost superhuman
devilry and cunning, did she understand what she had hoped, and
what she must now completely forswear.</p>

<p>No bolts and bars, no fortified towers or inaccessible
fortresses could prove so effectual a prison for Marguerite
Blakeney as the dictum which morally bound her to her cell.</p>

<p>"If you escape, the children and I would be guillotined the very
next day."</p>

<p>This meant that even if Percy knew, even if he could reach her,
he could never set her free, since her safety meant death to two
innocent children and to this simple-hearted man.</p>

<p>It would require more than the ingenuity of the Scarlet
Pimpernel himself to untie this Gordian knot.</p>

<p>"I don't mind for myself, of course," the old man went on with
gentle philosophy. "I have lived my life. What matters if I die
to-morrow, or if I linger on until my earthly span is legitimately
run out. I am ready to go home whenever my Father calls me. But it
is the children, you see. I have to think of them. Fran&ccedil;ois
is his mother's only son, the bread-winner of the household, a good
lad and studious, too, and F&eacute;licit&eacute; has always been
very delicate. She is blind from birth, and..."</p>

<p>"Oh! don't...for pity's sake, don't..." moaned Marguerite in an
agony of helplessness. "I understand...you need not fear for your
children, M. l'Abb&eacute;: no harm shall come to them through
me."</p>

<p>"It is as the good God wills!" replied the old man quietly.</p>

<p>Then, as Marguerite had once more relapsed into silence, he
fumbled for his beads, and his gentle voice began droning the
Paters and Aves, wherein no doubt his childlike heart found peace
and solace.</p>

<p>He understood that the poor woman would not wish to speak, he
knew as well as she did the overpowering strength of his helpless
appeal. Thus the minutes sped on, the jailer and the captive tied
to one another by the strongest bonds that hand of man can forge,
had nothing to say to one another: he, the old priest, imbued with
the traditions of his calling, could pray and resign himself to the
will of the Almighty, but she was young and ardent and passionate,
she loved and was beloved, and an impassable barrier was built up
between her and the man she worshipped!</p>

<p>A barrier fashioned by the weak hands of children, one of who
was delicate and blind. Outside was air and freedom, re-union with
her husband, an agony of happy remorse, a kiss from his dear lips,
and trembling hands held her back from it all, because of
Fran&ccedil;ois who was the bread-winner and of
F&eacute;licit&eacute; who was blind.</p>

<p>Mechanically, now, Marguerite rose again, and like an
automaton&mdash;lifeless and thoughtless&mdash;she began putting
the dingy and squalid room to rights. The abb&eacute; helped her to
demolish the improvised screen; with the same gentle delicacy of
thought which had caused him to build it up, he refrained from
speaking to her now: he would not intrude himself on her grief and
her despair.</p>

<p>Later on, she forced herself to speak again, and asked the old
man his name.</p>

<p>"My name is Foucquet," he replied. "Jean Baptiste Marie
Foucquet, late parish priest of the Church of S. Joseph, the patron
saint of Boulogne."</p>

<p>Foucquet! This was l'Abb&eacute; Foucquet! the faithful friend
and servant of the de Marny family.</p>

<p>Marguerite gazed at him with great, questioning eyes.</p>

<p>What a wealth of memories crowded in on her mind at sound of
that name! Her beautiful home at Richmond, her brilliant array of
servants and guests, His Royal Highness at her side! life in free,
joyous, happy England&mdash;how infinitely remote it now seemed.
Her ears were filled with the sound of a voice, drawly and quaint
and gentle, a voice and a laugh half shy, wholly mirthful, and oh!
so infinitely dear:</p>

<p>"I think a little sea voyage and English country air would suit
the Abb&eacute; Foucquet, m'dear, and I only mean to ask him to
cross the Channel with me..."</p>

<p>Oh! the joy and confidence expressed in those words! the daring!
the ambition! the pride! and the soft, languorous air of the
old-world garden round her then, the passion of his embrace! the
heavy scent of late roses and of heliotrope, which caused her to
swoon in his arms!</p>

<p>And now a narrow prison cell, and that pathetic, tender little
creature there, with trembling hands and tear-dimmed eyes, the most
powerful and most relentless jailer which the ferocious cunning of
her deadly enemies could possibly have devised.</p>

<p>Then she talked to him of Juliette Marny.</p>

<p>The abb&eacute; did not know that Mlle. de Marny had succeeded
in reaching England safely, and was overjoyed to hear it.</p>

<p>He recounted to Marguerite the story of the Marny jewels: how he
had put them safely away in the crypt of his little church, until
the Assembly of the Convention had ordered the closing of the
churches, and placed before every minister of le bon Dieu the
alternative of apostasy or death.</p>

<p>"With me it has only been prison so far," continued the old man
simply, "but prison has rendered me just as helpless as the
guillotine would have done, for the enemies of le bon Dieu have
ransacked the church of Saint Joseph and stolen the jewels which I
should have guarded with my life."</p>

<p>But it was obvious joy for the abb&eacute; to talk of Juliette
Marny's happiness. Vaguely, in his remote little provincial cure,
he had heard of the prowess and daring of the Scarlet Pimpernel,
and liked to think that Juliette owed her safety to him.</p>

<p>"The good God will reward him and those whom he cares for,"
added Abb&eacute; Foucquet with that earnest belief in divine
interference which seemed so strangely pathetic under these present
circumstances.</p>

<p>Marguerite sighed, and for the first time in this terrible
soul-stirring crisis through which she was passing so bravely, she
felt a beneficent moisture in her eyes: the awful tension of her
nerves relaxed. She went up to the old man, took his wrinkled hand
in hers, and falling on her knees beside him, she eased her
overburdened heart in a flood of tears.</p>

Triumph</b>
</h2>

<p>The day that Citizen Chauvelin's letter was received by the
members of the Committee of Public Safety was, indeed, one of great
rejoicing.</p>

<p>The "Moniteur" tells us that in the S&eacute;ance of September
22nd, 1793, or Vend&eacute;miaire 1st of the Year I., it was
decreed that sixty prisoners, not absolutely proved guilty of
treason against the Republic&mdash;only suspected&mdash;were to be
set free.</p>

<p>Sixty!...at the mere news of the possible capture of the Scarlet
Pimpernel!</p>

<p>The Committee was inclined to be magnanimous. Ferocity yielded
for the moment to the elusive joy of anticipatory triumph.</p>

<p>A glorious prize was about to fall into the hands of those who
had the welfare of the people at heart.</p>

<p>Robespierre and his decemvirs rejoiced, and sixty persons had
cause to rejoice with them. So be it! There were plans evolved
already as to national f&ecirc;tes and wholesale pardons, when that
impudent and meddlesome Englishman at last got his deserts.</p>

<p>Wholesale pardons which could easily be rescinded afterwards.
Even with those sixty it was a mere respite. Those of le Salut
Public only loosened their hold for awhile, were nobly magnanimous
for a day, quite prepared to be doubly ferocious the next.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile let us heartily rejoice.</p>

<p>The Scarlet Pimpernel is in France, or will be very soon, and on
an appointed day he will present himself conveniently to the
soldiers of the Republic for capture and for subsequent guillotine.
England is at war with us, there is nothing, therefore, further to
fear from her. We might hang every Englishman we can lay hands on,
and England could do no more than she is doing at the present
moment: bombard our ports bluster and threaten, join hands with
Flanders, and Austria, and Sardinia, and the devil if she
choose.</p>

<p>Allons! vogue la gal&egrave;re! The Scarlet Pimpernel is,
perhaps, on our shores at this very moment! Our most stinging, most
irritating foe is about to be delivered into our hands.</p>

<p>Citizen Chauvelin's letter is very categorical:</p>

<p><i>"I guarantee to you, Citizen Robespierre, and to the Members
of the Revolutionary Government, who have entrusted me with the
delicate mission..."</i>
</p>

<p>Robespierre's sensuous lips curl into a sarcastic smile. Citizen
Chauvelin's pen was ever florid in its style: <i>"entrusted me with
the delicate mission,"</i> is hardly the way to describe an order
given under penalty of death.</p>

<p>But let it pass!</p>

<p><i>"...that four days from this date, at one hour after sunset,
the man who goes by the mysterious name of the Scarlet Pimpernel
will be on the southern ramparts of Boulogne, at the extreme
southern corner of the town."</i>
</p>

<p><i>"Four days from this date"</i>...and Citizen Chauvelin's
letter is dated the nineteenth of September, 1793.</p>

<p>"Too much of an aristocrat&mdash;Monsieur le Marquis
Chauvelin..." sneers Merlin, the Jacobin. "He does not know that
all good citizens had called that date the 28th Fructidor, Year I
of the Republic."</p>

<p>"No matter," retorts Robespierre, with impatient frigidity,
"whatever we may call the day, it was forty-eight hours ago, and in
forty-eight hours more that damned Englishman will have run his
head into a noose, from which, an I mistake not, he'll not find it
easy to extricate himself."</p>

<p>"And you believe in Citizen Chauvelin's assertion," commented
Danton, with a lazy shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Only because he asks for help from us," quoth Robespierre
drily; "he is sure that the man will be there, but not sure if he
can tackle him."</p>

<p>But many were inclined to think that Chauvelin's letter was an
idle boast. They knew nothing of the circumstances which had caused
that letter to be written: they could not conjecture how it was
that the ex-ambassador could be so precise in naming the day and
hour when the enemy of France would be at the mercy of those whom
he had outraged and flouted.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Citizen Chauvelin asks for help, and help must not
be denied him. There must be no shadow of blame upon the actions of
the Committee of Public Safety.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had been weak once, had allowed the prize to slip
through his fingers; it must not occur again. He has a wonderful
head for devising plans, but he needs a powerful hand to aid him,
so that he may not fail again.</p>

<p>Collot d'Herbois, just home from Lyons and Tours, is the right
man in an emergency like this. Citizen Collot is full of ideas; the
inventor of the "Noyades" is sure to find a means of converting
Boulogne into one gigantic prison, out of which the mysterious
English adventurer will find it impossible to escape.</p>

<p>And whilst the deliberations go on, whilst this Committee of
butchers is busy slaughtering in imagination the game which it has
not yet succeeded in bringing down, there comes another messenger
from Citizen Chauvelin.</p>

<p>He must have ridden hard on the other one's heels, and something
very unexpected and very sudden must have occurred to cause the
citizen to send this second note.</p>

<p>This time it is curt and to the point. Robespierre unfolds it
and reads it to his colleagues.</p>

<p><i>"We have caught the woman&mdash;his wife&mdash;there may be
murder attempted against my person, send me some one at once, who
will carry out my instructions in case of my sudden death."</i>
</p>

<p>Robespierre's lips curl in satisfaction, showing a row of
yellowish teeth, long and sharp like the fangs of a wolf. A murmur
like unto the snarl of a pack of hyenas rises round the table, as
Chauvelin's letter is handed round.</p>

<p>Every one has guessed the importance of this preliminary
capture: "the woman&mdash;his wife." Chauvelin evidently thinks
much of it, for he anticipates an attempt against his life, nay! he
is quite prepared for it, ready to sacrifice it for the sake of his
revenge.</p>

<p>Who had accused him of weakness?</p>

<p>He only thinks of his duty, not of his life, he does not fear
for himself, only that the fruits of his skill might be jeopardised
through assassination.</p>

<p>Well! this English adventurer is capable of any act of
desperation to save his wife and himself, and Citizen Chauvelin
must not be left in the lurch.</p>

<p>Thus, Citizen Collot d'Herbois is despatched forthwith to
Boulogne to be a helpmeet and counsellor to Citizen Chauvelin.</p>

<p>Everything that can humanly be devised must be done to keep the
woman secure and to set the trap for that elusive Pimpernel.</p>

<p>Once he is caught the whole of France shall rejoice, and
Boulogne, who has been instrumental in running the quarry to earth,
must be specially privileged on that day.</p>

<p>A general amnesty for all prisoners the day the Scarlet
Pimpernel is captured. A public holiday and a pardon for all
natives of Boulogne who are under sentence of death: they shall be
allowed to find their way to the various English
boats&mdash;trading and smuggling craft&mdash;that always lie at
anchor in the roads there.</p>

<p>The Committee of Public Safety feel amazingly magnanimous
towards Boulogne; a proclamation embodying the amnesty and the
pardon is at once drawn up and signed by Robespierre and his
bloodthirsty Council of Ten; it is entrusted to Citizen Collot
d'Herbois to be read out at every corner of the ramparts as an
inducement to the little town to do its level best. The Englishman
and his wife&mdash;captured in Boulogne&mdash;will both be
subsequently brought to Paris, formally tried on a charge of
conspiring against the Republic, and guillotined as English spies,
but Boulogne shall have the greater glory and shall reap the first
and richest reward.</p>

<p>And armed with the magnanimous proclamation, the orders for
general rejoicings and a grand local f&ecirc;te, armed also with
any and every power over the entire city, its municipality, its
garrison, its forts, for himself and his colleague Chauvelin,
Citizen Collot d'Herbois starts for Boulogne forthwith.</p>

<p>Needless to tell him not to let the grass grow under his horse's
hoofs. The capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel, though not absolutely
an accomplished fact, is nevertheless, a practical certainty, and
no one rejoices over this great event more than the man who is to
be present and see all the fun.</p>

<p>Riding and driving, getting what relays of horses or waggons
from roadside farms that he can, Collot is not like to waste much
time on the way.</p>

<p>It is 157 miles to Boulogne by road, and Collot, burning with
ambition to be in at the death, rides or drives as no messenger of
good tidings has ever ridden or driven before.</p>

<p>He does not stop to eat, but munches chunks of bread and cheese
in the recess of the lumbering chaise or waggon that bears him
along whenever his limbs refuse him service and he cannot mount a
horse.</p>

<p>The chronicles tell us that twenty-four hours after he left
Paris, half-dazed with fatigue, but ferocious and eager still, he
is borne to the gates of Boulogne by an old cart horse
requisitioned from some distant farm, and which falls down dead at
the Porte Gayole, whilst its rider, with a last effort, loudly
clamours for admittance into the town "in the name of the
Republic".</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21" id=

Suspense</b>
</h2>

<p>In his memorable interview with Robespierre, the day before he
left for England, Chauvelin had asked that absolute power be given
him, in order that he might carry out the plans for the capture of
the Scarlet Pimpernel, which he had in his mind. Now that he was
back in France he had no cause to complain that the Revolutionary
Government had grudged him this power for which he had asked.</p>

<p>Implicit obedience had followed whenever he had commanded.</p>

<p>As soon as he heard that a woman had been arrested in the act of
uttering a passport in the name of C&eacute;line Dumont, he guessed
at once that Marguerite Blakeney had, with characteristic impulse,
fallen into the trap which, with the aid of the woman Candeille, he
had succeeded in laying for her.</p>

<p>He was not the least surprised at that. He knew human nature,
feminine nature, far too well, ever to have been in doubt for a
moment that Marguerite would follow her husband without calculating
either costs or risks.</p>

<p>Ye gods! the irony of it all! Had she not been called the
cleverest woman in Europe at one time? Chauvelin himself had thus
acclaimed her, in those olden days, before she and he became such
mortal enemies, and when he was one of the many satellites that
revolved round brilliant Marguerite St. Just. And to-night, when a
sergeant of the town guard brought him news of her capture, he
smiled grimly to himself: "the cleverest woman in Europe" had
failed to perceive the trap laid temptingly open for her.</p>

<p>Once more she had betrayed her husband into the hands of those
who would not let him escape a second time. And now she had done it
with her eyes open, with loving, passionate heart, which ached for
self-sacrifice, and only succeeded in imperilling the loved one
more hopelessly than before.</p>

<p>The sergeant was waiting for orders. Citizen Chauvelin had come
to Boulogne, armed with more full and more autocratic powers than
any servant of the new republic had ever been endowed with before.
The governor of the town, the captain of the guard, the fort and
municipality were all as abject slaves before him.</p>

<p>As soon as he had taken possession of the quarters organised for
him in the town hall, he had asked for a list of prisoners who for
one cause or another were being detained pending further
investigations.</p>

<p>The list was long, and contained many names which were of not
the slightest interest to Chauvelin: he passed them over
impatiently.</p>

<p>"To be released at once," he said curtly.</p>

<p>He did not want the guard to be burdened with unnecessary
duties, nor the prisons of the little seaport town to be
inconveniently encumbered. He wanted room, space, air, the force
and intelligence of the entire town at his command for the one
capture which meant life and revenge to him.</p>

<p>"A woman&mdash;name unknown&mdash;found in possession of a
forged passport in the name of C&eacute;line Dumont, maid to the
Citizeness D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille&mdash;attempted to
land&mdash;was interrogated and failed to give satisfactory
explanation of herself&mdash;detained in room No. 6 of the Gayole
Prison."</p>

<p>This was one of the last names on the list, the only one of any
importance to Citizen Chauvelin. When he read it he nearly drove
his nails into the palms of his hands, so desperate an effort did
he make not to betray before the sergeant, by look or sigh, the
exultation which he felt.</p>

<p>For a moment he shaded his eyes against the glare of the lamp,
but it was not long before he had formulated a plan and was ready
to give his orders.</p>

<p>He asked for a list of prisoners already detained in the various
forts. The name of l'Abb&eacute; Foucquet, with those of this niece
and nephew, attracted his immediate attention. He asked for further
information respecting these people, heard that the boy was a
widow's only son, the sole supporter of his mother's declining
years; the girl was ailing, suffering from incipient phthisis, and
was blind.</p>

<p>Pardi! the very thing! L'Abb&eacute; himself, the friend of
Juliette Marny, the pathetic personality around which this final
adventure of the Scarlet Pimpernel was intended to revolve! and
these two young people! his sister's children! one of them blind
and ill, the other full of vigour and manhood.</p>

<p>Citizen Chauvelin had soon made up his mind.</p>

<p>A few quick orders to the sergeant of the guard, and
l'Abb&eacute; Foucquet, weak, helpless and gentle, became the
relentless jailer who would guard Marguerite more securely than a
whole regiment of loyal soldiers could have done.</p>

<p>Then, having despatched a messenger to the Committee of Public
Safety, Chauvelin laid himself down to rest. Fate had not deceived
him. He had thought and schemed and planned, and events had shaped
themselves exactly as he had foreseen, and the fact that Marguerite
Blakeney was at the present moment a prisoner in his own hands was
merely the result of his own calculations.</p>

<p>As for the Scarlet Pimpernel, Chauvelin could not very well
conceive what he would do under these present circumstances. The
duel on the southern ramparts had, of course, become a farce, not
likely to be enacted, now that Marguerite's life was at stake. The
daring adventurer was caught in a network at last, from which all
his ingenuity, all his wit, his impudence, and his amazing luck
could never extricate him.</p>

<p>And in Chauvelin's mind there was still something more. Revenge
was the sweetest emotion his bruised and humbled pride could know:
he had not yet tasted its complete intoxicating joy: but every hour
now his cup of delight became more and more full: in a few days it
would overflow.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile he was content to wait. The hours sped by and
there was no news yet of that elusive Pimpernel. Of Marguerite he
knew nothing save that she was well guarded; the sentry who passed
up and down outside room No. 6 had heard her voice and that of the
Abb&eacute; Foucquet in the course of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had asked the Committee of Public Safety for aid in
his difficult task, but forty-eight hours at least must elapse
before such aid could reach him. Forty-eight hours during which the
hand of an assassin might be lurking for him, and might even reach
him ere his vengeance was fully accomplished.</p>

<p>That was the only thought which really troubled him. He did not
want to die before he had seen the Scarlet Pimpernel a withered,
abject creature, crushed in fame and honour, too debased to find
glorification even in death.</p>

<p>At this moment he only cared for his life because it was needed
for the complete success of his schemes. No one else he knew would
have that note of personal hatred towards the enemy of France which
was necessary now in order to carry out successfully the plans
which he had formed.</p>

<p>Robespierre and all the others only desired the destruction of a
man who had intrigued against the reign of terror which they had
established; his death on the guillotine, even if it were
surrounded with the halo of martyrdom, would have satisfied them
completely. Chauvelin looked further than that. He hated the man!
he had suffered humiliation through him individually. He wished to
see him as an object of contempt rather than of pity. And because
of the anticipation of this joy, he was careful of his life, and
throughout those two days which elapsed between the capture of
Marguerite and the arrival of Collot d'Herbois at Boulogne,
Chauvelin never left his quarters at the H&ocirc;tel de Ville, and
requisitioned a special escort consisting of proved soldiers of the
town guard to attend his every footstep.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 22nd, after the arrival of Citizen Collot
in Boulogne, he gave orders that the woman from No. 6 cell be
brought before him in the ground floor room of the Fort Gayole.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22" id=
"Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
Not Death</b>
</h2>

<p>Two days of agonising suspense, of alternate hope and despair,
had told heavily on Marguerite Blakeney.</p>

<p>Her courage was still indomitable, her purpose firm and her
faith secure, but she was without the slightest vestige of news,
entirely shut off from the outside world, left to conjecture, to
scheme, to expect and to despond alone.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Foucquet had tried in his gentle way to be of
comfort to her, and she in her turn did her very best not to render
his position more cruel than it already was.</p>

<p>A message came to him twice during those forty-eight hours from
Fran&ccedil;ois and F&eacute;licit&eacute;, a little note scribbled
by the boy, or a token sent by the blind girl, to tell the
abb&eacute; that the children were safe and well: that they would
be safe and well so long as the citizeness with the name unknown
remained closely guarded by him in room No. 6.</p>

<p>When these messages came, the old man would sigh and murmur
something about the good God: and hope, which perhaps had faintly
risen in Marguerite's heart within the last hour or so, would once
more sink back into the abyss of uttermost despair.</p>

<p>Outside the monotonous walk of the sentry sounded like the
perpetual thud of a hammer beating upon her bruised temple.</p>

<p>"What's to be done? My God! what's to be done?"</p>

<p>Where was Percy now?</p>

<p>"How to reach him!...Oh, God! grant me light!"</p>

<p>The one real terror which she felt was that she would go mad.
Nay! that she was in a measure mad already. For hours now&mdash;or
was it days?...or years?...she had heard nothing save that rhythmic
walk of the sentinel, and the kindly, tremulous voice of the
abb&eacute; whispering consolations, or murmuring prayers in her
ears, she had seen nothing save that prison door of rough deal,
painted a dull gray, with great old-fashioned lock, and hinges
rusty with the damp of ages.</p>

<p>She had kept her eyes fixed on that door until they burned and
ached with well-night intolerable pain; yet she felt that she could
not look elsewhere, lest she missed the golden moment when the
bolts would be drawn, and that dull, gray door would swing slowly
on its rusty hinges.</p>

<p>Surely, surely, that was the commencement of madness!</p>

<p>Yet for Percy's sake, because he might want her, because he
might have need of her courage and of her presence of mind, she
tried to keep her wits about her. But it was difficult! oh!
terribly difficult! especially when the shades of evening began to
gather in, and peopled the squalid, white-washed room with
innumerable, threatening ghouls.</p>

<p>Then when the moon came up, a silver ray crept in through the
tiny window and struck full upon that gray door, making it look
weird and spectral, like the entrance to a house of ghosts.</p>

<p>Even now, as there was a distinct sound of the pushing of bolts
and bars, Marguerite thought that she was the prey of
hallucinations. The Abb&eacute; Foucquet was sitting in the remote
and darkest corner of the room, quietly telling his beads. His
serene philosophy and gentle placidity could in no way be disturbed
by the opening or shutting of a door, or by the bearer of good or
evil tidings.</p>

<p>The room now seemed strangely gloomy and cavernous, with those
deep, black shadows all around and that white ray of the moon which
struck so weirdly on the door.</p>

<p>Marguerite shuddered with one of those unaccountable
premonitions of something evil about to come, which ofttimes assail
those who have a nervous and passionate temperament.</p>

<p>The door swung slowly open upon its hinges: there was a quick
word of command, and the light of a small oil lamp struck full into
the gloom. Vaguely Marguerite discerned a group of men, soldiers no
doubt, for there was the glint of arms and the suggestion of
tricolour cockades and scarves. One of the men was holding the lamp
aloft, another took a few steps forward into the room. He turned to
Marguerite, entirely ignoring the presence of the old priest, and
addressing her peremptorily.</p>

<p>"Your presence is desired by the citizen governor," he said
curtly; "stand up and follow me."</p>

<p>"Whither am I to go?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To where my men will take you. Now then, quick's the word. The
citizen governor does not like to wait."</p>

<p>At a word of command from him, two more soldiers now entered the
room and placed themselves one on each side of Marguerite, who,
knowing that resistance was useless, had already risen and was
prepared to go.</p>

<p>The abb&eacute; tried to utter a word of protest, and came
quickly forward towards Marguerite, but he was summarily and very
roughly pushed aside.</p>

<p>"Now then, calotin," said the first soldier with an oath, "this
is none of your business. Forward! march!" he added, addressing his
men, "and you, citizeness, will find it wiser to come quietly along
and not to attempt any tricks with me, or the gag and manacles will
have to be used."</p>

<p>But Marguerite had no intention of resisting. She was too tired
even to wonder as to what they meant to do with her or whither they
were going; she moved as in a dream and felt a hope within her that
she was being led to death: summary executions were the order of
the day, she knew that, and sighed for this simple solution of the
awful problem which had been harassing her these past two days.</p>

<p>She was being led along a passage, stumbling ever and anon as
she walked, for it was but dimly lighted by the same little oil
lamp, which one of the soldiers was carrying in front, holding it
high up above his head: then they went down a narrow flight of
stone steps, until she and her escort reached a heavy oak door.</p>

<p>A halt was ordered at this point: and the man in command of the
little party pushed the door open and walked in. Marguerite caught
sight of a room beyond, dark and gloomy-looking, as was her own
prison cell. Somewhere on the left there was obviously a window;
she could not see it, but guessed that it was there because the
moon struck full upon the floor, ghostlike and spectral, well
fitting in with the dreamlike state in which Marguerite felt
herself to be.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room she could discern a table with a chair
close beside it, also a couple of tallow-candles, which flickered
in the draught caused, no doubt, by that open window which she
could not see.</p>

<p>All these little details impressed themselves on Marguerite's
mind, as she stood there, placidly waiting until she should once
more be told to move along. The table, the chair, that unseen
window, trivial objects though they were, assumed before her
over-wrought fancy an utterly disproportionate importance. She
caught herself presently counting up the number of boards visible
on the floor, and watching the smoke of the tallow-candles rising
up towards the grimy ceiling.</p>

<p>After a few minutes' weary waiting, which seemed endless to
Marguerite, there came a short word of command from within, and she
was roughly pushed forward into the room by one of the men. The
cool air of a late September's evening gently fanned her burning
temples. She looked round her, and now perceived that some one was
sitting at the table, the other side of the tallow-candles&mdash;a
man, with head bent over a bundle of papers and shading his face
against the light with his hand.</p>

<p>He rose as she approached, and the flickering flame of the
candles played weirdly upon the slight, sable-clad figure,
illumining the keen, ferret-like face, and throwing fitful gleams
across the deep-set eyes and the narrow, cruel mouth.</p>

<p>It was Chauvelin.</p>

<p>Mechanically Marguerite took the chair which the soldier drew
towards her, ordering her curtly to sit down. She seemed to have
but little power to move. Though all her faculties had suddenly
become preternaturally alert at sight of this man, whose very life
now was spent in doing her the most grievous wrong that one human
being can do to another, yet all these faculties were forcefully
centred in the one mighty effort not to flinch before him, not to
let him see for a moment that she was afraid.</p>

<p>She compelled her eyes to look at him fully and squarely, her
lips not to tremble, her very heart to stop its wild, excited
beating. She felt his keen eyes fixed intently upon her, but more
in curiosity than in hatred or satisfied vengeance.</p>

<p>When she had sat down he came round the table and moved towards
her. When he drew quite near, she instinctively recoiled. It had
been an almost imperceptible action on her part, and certainly an
involuntary one, for she did not wish to betray a single thought or
emotion, until she knew what he wished to say.</p>

<p>But he had noted her movement&mdash;a sort of drawing up and
stiffening of her whole person as he approached. He seemed pleased
to see it, for he smiled sarcastically, but with evident
satisfaction, and&mdash;as if his purpose was now
accomplished&mdash;he immediately withdrew and went back to his
former seat on the other side of the table.</p>

<p>After that he ordered the soldiers to go.</p>

<p>"But remain at attention outside, you and your men," he added,
"ready to enter if I call."</p>

<p>It was Marguerite's turn to smile at this obvious sign of a
lurking fear on Chauvelin's part, and a line of sarcasm and
contempt curled her full lips.</p>

<p>The soldiers having obeyed, and the oak door having closed upon
them, Marguerite was now alone with the man whom she hated and
loathed beyond every living thing on earth.</p>

<p>She wondered when he would begin to speak and why he had sent
for her. But he seemed in no hurry to begin. Still shading his face
with his hand, he was watching her with utmost attention: she, on
the other hand, was looking through and beyond him, with
contemptuous indifference, as if his presence here did not interest
her in the least.</p>

<p>She would give him no opening for this conversation which he had
sought, and which she felt would prove either purposeless or else
deeply wounding to her heart and to her pride. She sat, therefore,
quite still with the flickering and yellow light fully illumining
her delicate face, with its childlike curves, and delicate
features, the noble, straight brow, the great blue eyes and halo of
golden hair.</p>

<p>"My desire to see you here to-night must seem strange to you,
Lady Blakeney," said Chauvelin at last.</p>

<p>Then, as she did not reply, he continued, speaking quite gently,
almost deferentially:</p>

<p>"There are various matters of grave importance, which the events
of the next twenty-four hours will reveal to your ladyship, and
believe me that I am actuated by motives of pure friendship towards
you in this my effort to mitigate the unpleasantness of such news
as you might hear to-morrow perhaps, by giving you due warning of
what its nature might be."</p>

<p>She turned great questioning eyes upon him, and in their
expression she tried to put all the contempt which she felt, all
the bitterness, all the defiance and the pride.</p>

<p>He quietly shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Ah! I fear me," he said, "that your ladyship, as usual, doth me
grievous wrong. It is but natural that you should misjudge me, yet,
believe me..."</p>

<p>"A truce on this foolery, M. Chauvelin," she broke in, with
sudden impatient vehemence, "pray, leave your protestations of
friendship and courtesy alone, there is no one here to hear them. I
pray you proceed with what you have to say."</p>

<p>"Ah!" It was a sigh of satisfaction on the part of Chauvelin.
Her anger and impatience, even at this early stage of the
interview, proved sufficiently that her icy restraint was only on
the surface.</p>

<p>And Chauvelin always knew how to deal with vehemence. He loved
to play with the emotions of a passionate fellow-creature: it was
only the imperturbable calm of a certain enemy of his that was wont
to shake his own impenetrable armour of reserve.</p>

<p>"As your ladyship desires," he said, with a slight and ironical
bow of the head. "But before proceeding according to your wish, I
am compelled to ask your ladyship just one question."</p>

<p>"And that is?"</p>

<p>"Have you reflected what your present position means to that
inimitable prince of dandies, Sir Percy Blakeney?"</p>

<p>"Is it necessary for your present purpose, Monsieur, that you
should mention my husband's name at all?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It is indispensable, fair lady," he replied suavely, "for is
not the fate of your husband so closely intertwined with yours,
that his actions will inevitably be largely influenced by your
own?"</p>

<p>Marguerite gave a start of surprise, and as Chauvelin had paused
she tried to read what hidden meaning lay behind these last words
of his. Was it his intention then to propose some bargain, one of
those terrible "either-ors" of which he seemed to possess the
malignant secret? Oh! if that was so; if, indeed he had sent for
her in order to suggest one of those terrible alternatives of his,
then&mdash;be it what it may, be it the wildest conception which
the insane brain of a fiend could invent, she would accept it, so
long as the man she loved were given one single chance of
escape.</p>

<p>Therefore she turned to her arch-enemy in a more conciliatory
spirit now, and even endeavoured to match her own diplomatic
cunning against his.</p>

<p>"I do not understand," she said tentatively. "How can my actions
influence those of my husband? I am a prisoner in Boulogne; he
probably is not aware of that fact yet, and..."</p>

<p>"Sir Percy Blakeney may be in Boulogne at any moment now," he
interrupted quietly. "An I mistake not, few places can offer such
great attractions to that peerless gentleman of fashion than doth
this humble provincial town of France just at this present...Hath
it not the honour of harbouring Lady Blakeney within its
gates?...And your ladyship may indeed believe me when I say, that
the day that Sir Percy lands in our hospitable port, two hundred
pairs of eyes will be fixed upon him, lest he should wish to quit
it again."</p>

<p>"And if there were two thousand, sir," she said impulsively,
"they would not stop his coming or going as he pleased."</p>

<p>"Nay, fair lady," he said, with a smile, "are you then endowing
Sir Percy Blakeney with the attributes which, as popular fancy has
it, belong exclusively to that mysterious English hero, the Scarlet
Pimpernel?"</p>

<p>"A truce to your diplomacy, Monsieur Chauvelin," she retorted,
goaded by his sarcasm; "why should we try to fence with one
another? What was the object of your journey to England? of the
farce which you enacted in my house, with the help of the woman
Candeille? of that duel and that challenge, save that you desired
to entice Sir Percy Blakeney to France?"</p>

<p>"And also his charming wife," he added, with an ironical
bow.</p>

<p>She bit her lip and made no comment.</p>

<p>"Shall we say that I succeeded admirably?" he continued,
speaking with persistent urbanity and calm "and that I have strong
cause to hope that that elusive Pimpernel will soon be a guest on
our friendly shores?...There! you see, I, too, have laid down the
foils...As you say, why should we fence? Your ladyship is now in
Boulogne, soon Sir Percy will come to try and take you away from
us, but, believe me, fair lady, that it would take more than the
ingenuity and the daring of the Scarlet Pimpernel magnified a
thousandfold to get him back to England again...unless..."</p>

<p>"Unless?..."</p>

<p>Marguerite held her breath. She felt now as if the whole
universe must stand still during the next supreme moment, until she
heard what Chauvelin's next words would be.</p>

<p>There was to be an "unless" then? An "either-or" more terrible,
no doubt, than the one he had formulated before her just a year
ago.</p>

<p>Chauvelin, she knew, was pastmaster in the art of putting a
knife at his victim's throat, and giving it just the necessary
twist with his cruel and relentless "unless"!</p>

<p>But she felt quite calm, because her purpose was resolute. There
is no doubt that during this agonising moment of suspense she was
absolutely firm in her determination to accept any and every
condition, which Chauvelin would put before her as the price of her
husband's safety. After all, these conditions, since he placed them
before <i>her</i>, could but resolve themselves into questions of
her own life as against her husband's.</p>

<p>With that unreasoning impulse, which was one of her most salient
characteristics, she never paused to think that, to Chauvelin, her
own life or death were only the means to the great end which he had
in view: the complete annihilation of the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>That end could only be reached by Percy Blakeney's
death&mdash;not by her own.</p>

<p>Even now, as she was watching him with eyes glowing and lips
tightly closed, lest a cry of impatient agony should escape her
throat, he, like a snail that has shown its slimy horns too soon,
and is not ready to face the enemy as yet, seemed suddenly to
withdraw within his former shell of careless suavity. The
earnestness of his tone vanished, giving place to light and easy
conversation, just as if he were discussing social topics with a
woman of fashion in a Paris drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Nay!" he said pleasantly, "is not your ladyship taking this
matter in too serious a spirit? Of a truth, you repeated my
innocent word'unless,' even as if I were putting a knife at your
dainty throat. Yet I meant naught that need disturb you yet. Have I
not said that I am your friend? Let me try and prove it to
you."</p>

<p>"You will find it a difficult task, Monsieur," she said
drily.</p>

<p>"Difficult tasks always have had a great fascination for your
humble servant. May I try?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Shall we then touch at the root of this delicate matter? Your
ladyship, so I understand, is at this moment under the impression
that I desire to encompass&mdash;shall I say? the death of an
English gentleman for whom, believe me, I have the greatest
respect. That is so, is it not?"</p>

<p>"What is so, M. Chauvelin?" she asked almost stupidly, for truly
she had not even begun to grasp his meaning. "I do not
understand."</p>

<p>"You think that I am at this moment taking measures for sending
the Scarlet Pimpernel to the guillotine? Eh?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Never was so great an error committed by a clever woman. Your
ladyship must believe me when I say that the guillotine is the very
last place in the world where I would wish to see that enigmatic
and elusive personage."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to fool me, M. Chauvelin? If so, for what
purpose? And why do you lie to me like that?"</p>

<p>"On my honour, 'tis the truth. The death of Sir Percy
Blakeney&mdash;I may call him that, may I not&mdash;would ill suit
the purpose which I have in view."</p>

<p>"What purpose? You must pardon me, Monsieur Chauvelin," she
added with a quick, impatient sigh, "but of a truth, I am getting
confused, and my wits must have become dull in the past few days. I
pray you to add to your many protestations of friendship a little
more clearness in your speech, and, if possible, a little more
brevity. What, then, is the purpose which you had in view when you
enticed my husband to come over to France?"</p>

<p>"My purpose was the destruction of the Scarlet Pimpernel, not
the death of Sir Percy Blakeney. Believe me, I have a great regard
for Sir Percy. He is a most accomplished gentleman, witty,
brilliant, an inimitable dandy. Why should he not grace with his
presence the drawing-rooms of London or of Brighton for many years
to come?"</p>

<p>She looked at him with puzzled inquiry. For one moment the
thought flashed through her mind that, after all, Chauvelin might
be still in doubt as to the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel...But
no! that hope was madness...It was preposterous and
impossible...But then, why? why? why?...Oh, God! for a little more
patience!</p>

<p>"What I have just said may seem a little enigmatic to your
ladyship," he continued blandly, "but surely so clever a woman as
yourself, so great a lady as is the wife Sir Percy Blakeney,
Baronet, will be aware that there are other means of destroying an
enemy than the taking of his life."</p>

<p>"For instance, Monsieur Chauvelin?"</p>

<p>"There is the destruction of his honour," he replied slowly.</p>

<p>A long, bitter laugh, almost hysterical in its loud outburst,
broke from the very depths of Marguerite's convulsed heart.</p>

<p>"The destruction of his honour!...ha! ha! ha! ha!...of a truth,
Monsieur Chauvelin, your inventive powers have led you beyond the
bounds of dreamland!...Ha! ha! ha! ha!...It is in the land of
madness that you are wandering, sir, when you talk in one breath of
Sir Percy Blakeney and the possible destruction of his honour!"</p>

<p>But he remained apparently quite unruffled, and when her
laughter had somewhat subsided, he said placidly:</p>

<p>"Perhaps!..."</p>

<p>Then he rose from his chair, and once more approached her. This
time she did not shrink from him. The suggestion which he had made
just now, this talk of attacking her husband's honour rather than
his life seemed so wild and preposterous&mdash;the conception truly
of a mind unhinged&mdash;that she looked upon it as a sign of
extreme weakness on his part, almost as an acknowledgement of
impotence.</p>

<p>But she watched him as he moved round the table more in
curiosity now than in fright. He puzzled her, and she still had a
feeling at the back of her mind that there must be something more
definite and more evil lurking at the back of that tortuous
brain.</p>

<p>"Will your ladyship allow me to conduct you to yonder window?"
he said, "the air is cool, and what I have to say can best be done
in sight of yonder sleeping city."</p>

<p>His tone was one of perfect courtesy, even of respectful
deference, through which not the slightest trace of sarcasm could
be discerned, and she, still actuated by curiosity and interest,
not in any way by fear, quietly rose to obey him. Though she
ignored the hand which he was holding out towards her, she followed
him readily enough as he walked up to the window.</p>

<p>All through this agonising and soul-stirring interview she had
felt heavily oppressed by the close atmosphere of the room,
rendered nauseous by the evil smell of the smoky tallow-candles,
which were left to spread their grease and smoke abroad unchecked.
Once or twice she had gazed longingly towards the suggestion of
pure air outside.</p>

<p>Chauvelin evidently had still much to say to her: the torturing,
mental rack to which she was being subjected had not yet fully done
its work. It still was capable of one or two turns, a twist or so
which might succeed in crushing her pride and her defiance. Well!
so be it! she was in the man's power: had placed herself therein
through her own unreasoning impulse. This interview was but one of
the many soul-agonies which she had been called upon to endure,
and, if by submitting to it all she could in a measure mitigate her
own faults and be of help to the man she loved, she would find the
sacrifice small and the mental torture easy to bear.</p>

<p>Therefore, when Chauvelin beckoned to her to draw near, she went
up to the window, and leaning her head against the deep stone
embrasure, she looked out into the night.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23" id=
"Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
The Hostage</b>
</h2>

<p>Chauvelin, without speaking, extended his hand out towards the
city, as if to invite Marguerite to gaze upon it.</p>

<p>She was quite unconscious what hour of the night it might be,
but it must have been late, for the little town, encircled by the
stony arms of its forts, seemed asleep. The moon, now slowly
sinking in the west, edged the towers and spires with filmy lines
of silver. To the right Marguerite caught sight of the frowning
Beffroi, which even as she gazed out began tolling its heavy bell.
It sounded like the tocsin, dull and muffled. After ten strokes it
was still.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock! At this hour, in far-off England, in fashionable
London, the play was just over, crowds of gaily-dressed men and
women poured out of the open gates of the theatres, calling loudly
for attendant or chaise. Thence to balls or routs, gaily fluttering
like so many butterflies, brilliant and irresponsible...</p>

<p>And in England also, in the beautiful gardens of her Richmond
home, ofttimes at ten o'clock she had wandered alone with Percy,
when he was at home, and the spirit of adventure in him was
momentarily laid to rest. Then, when the night was very dark and
the air heavy with the scent of roses and lilies, she lay quiescent
in his arms in that little arbour beside the river. The rhythmic
lapping of the waves was the only sound that stirred the balmy air.
He seldom spoke then, for his voice would shake whenever he uttered
a word: but his impenetrable armour of flippancy was pierced
through, and he did not speak because his lips were pressed to
hers, and his love had soared beyond the domain of speech.</p>

<p>A shudder of intense mental pain went through her now, as she
gazed on the sleeping city, and sweet memories of the past turned
bitterness in this agonising present. One by one, as the moon
gradually disappeared behind a bank of clouds, the towers of
Boulogne were merged in the gloom. In front of her, far far away,
beyond the flat sand dunes, the sea seemed to be calling to her
with a ghostly and melancholy moan.</p>

<p>The window was on the ground floor of the fort, and gave direct
on to the wide and shady walk which runs along the crest of the
city walls; from where she stood Marguerite was looking straight
along the ramparts, some thirty m&egrave;tres wide at this point,
flanked on either side by the granite balustrade, and adorned with
a double row of ancient elms, stunted and twisted into grotesque
shapes by the persistent action of the wind.</p>

<p>"These wide ramparts are a peculiarity of this city..." said a
voice close to her ear. "At times of peace they form an agreeable
promenade under the shade of the trees, and a delightful
meeting-place for lovers...or enemies..."</p>

<p>The sound brought her back to the ugly realities of the present:
the rose-scented garden at Richmond, the lazily flowing river, the
tender memories which for that brief moment had confronted her from
out a happy past, suddenly vanished from her ken. Instead of these
the brine-laden sea air struck her quivering nostrils, the echo of
the old Beffroi died away in her ear, and now, from out one of the
streets or open places of the sleeping city, there came the sound
of a raucous voice, shouting in monotonous tones a string of words,
the meaning of which failed to reach her brain.</p>

<p>Not many feet below the window the southern ramparts of the town
stretched away into the darkness. She felt unaccountably cold,
suddenly, as she looked down upon them, and, with aching eyes,
tried to pierce the gloom. She was shivering, in spite of the
mildness of this early autumnal night: her overwrought fancy was
peopling the lonely wall with unearthly shapes, strolling along,
discussing in spectral language a strange duel which was to take
place here between a noted butcher of men and a mad Englishman
overfond of adventure.</p>

<p>The ghouls seemed to pass and repass along in front of her and
to be laughing audibly because that mad Englishman had been offered
his life in exchange for his honour. They laughed and laughed, no
doubt because he refused the bargain&mdash;Englishmen were always
eccentric, and in these days of equality and other devices of a
free and glorious Revolution, honour was such a very marketable
commodity that it seemed ridiculous to prize it quite so highly.
Then they strolled away again and disappeared, whilst Marguerite
distinctly heard the scrunching of the path beneath their feet. She
leant forward to peer still further into the darkness, for this
sound had seemed so absolutely real, but immediately a detaining
hand was placed upon her arm and a sarcastic voice murmured at her
elbow:</p>

<p>"The result, fair lady, would only be a broken leg or arm; the
height is not great enough for picturesque suicides, and, believe
me, these ramparts are only haunted by ghosts."</p>

<p>She drew back as if a viper had stung her: for the moment she
had become oblivious of Chauvelin's presence. However, she would
not take notice of his taunt, and after a slight pause, he asked
her if she could hear the town crier over in the public
streets.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>"What he says at the present moment is of vast importance to
your ladyship," he remarked drily.</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Your ladyship is a precious hostage. We are taking measures to
guard our valuable property securely."</p>

<p>Marguerite thought of the Abb&eacute; Foucquet, who no doubt was
still quietly telling his beads, even if in his heart he had begun
to wonder what had become of her. She thought of Fran&ccedil;ois,
who was the bread-winner, and of F&eacute;licit&eacute;, who was
blind.</p>

<p>"Methinks you and your colleagues have done that already," she
said.</p>

<p>"Not as completely as we would wish. We know the daring of the
Scarlet Pimpernel. We are not even ashamed to admit that we fear
his luck, his impudence, and his marvellous ingenuity...Have I not
told you that I have the greatest possible respect for that
mysterious English hero...An old priest and two young children
might be spirited away by that enigmatical adventurer, even whilst
Lady Blakeney herself is made to vanish from our sight."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see your ladyship is taking my simple words as a
confession of weakness," he continued, noting the swift sigh of
hope which had involuntarily escaped her lips. "Nay! an' it please
you, you shall despise me for it. But a confession of weakness is
the first sign of strength. The Scarlet Pimpernel is still at
large, whilst we guard our hostage securely; he is bound to fall
into our hands."</p>

<p>"Aye! still at large!" she retorted with impulsive defiance.
"Think you that all your bolts and bars, the ingenuity of yourself
and your colleagues, the collaboration of the devil himself, would
succeed in outwitting the Scarlet Pimpernel, now that his purpose
will be to try and drag <i>me</i> from out your clutches?"</p>

<p>She felt hopeful and proud. Now that she had the pure air of
heaven in her lungs, that from afar she could smell the sea, and
could feel that perhaps in a straight line of vision from where she
stood the <i>Day Dream</i>, with Sir Percy on board, might be lying
out there in the roads, it seemed impossible that he should fail in
freeing her and those poor people&mdash;an old man and two
children&mdash;whose lives depended on her own.</p>

<p>But Chauvelin only laughed a dry, sarcastic laugh, and said:</p>

<p>"Hm! perhaps not!...It, of course, will depend on you and your
personality...your feelings in such matters...and whether an
English gentleman likes to save his own skin at the expense of
others."</p>

<p>Marguerite shivered as if from cold.</p>

<p>"Ah! I see," resumed Chauvelin quietly, "that your ladyship has
not quite grasped the position. That public crier is a long way
off: the words have lingered on the evening breeze and have failed
to reach your brain. Do you suppose that I and my colleagues do not
know that all the ingenuity of which the Scarlet Pimpernel is
capable will now be directed in piloting Lady Blakeney, and
incidentally the Abb&eacute; Foucquet with his nephew and niece,
safely across the Channel? Four people!...Bah! a bagatelle for this
mighty conspirator, who but lately snatched twenty aristocrats from
the prisons of Lyons...Nay! nay! two children and an old man were
not enough to guard our precious hostage, and I was not thinking of
either the Abb&eacute; Foucquet or the two children, when I said
that an English gentleman would not save himself at the expense of
others."</p>

<p>"Of whom, then, were you thinking, Monsieur Chauvelin? Whom else
have you set to guard the prize which you value so highly?"</p>

<p>"The whole city of Boulogne," he replied simply.</p>

<p>"I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Let me make my point clear. My colleague, Citizen Collot
d'Herbois, rode over from Paris yesterday; like myself, he is a
member of the Committee of Public Safety, whose duty it is to look
after the welfare of France by punishing all those who conspire
against her laws and the liberties of the people. Chief among these
conspirators, whom it is our duty to punish is, of course, that
impudent adventurer who calls himself the Scarlet Pimpernel. He has
given the Government of France a great deal of trouble through his
attempts&mdash;mostly successful, as I have already
admitted&mdash;at frustrating the just vengeance which an oppressed
country has the right to wreak on those who have proved themselves
to be tyrants and traitors."</p>

<p>"Is it necessary to recapitulate all this, Monsieur Chauvelin?"
she asked impatiently.</p>

<p>"I think so," he replied blandly. "You see, my point is this. We
feel that in a measure now the Scarlet Pimpernel is in our power.
Within the next few hours he will land at Boulogne...Boulogne,
where he has agreed to fight a duel with me...Boulogne, where Lady
Blakeney happens to be at this present moment...as you see,
Boulogne has a grave responsibility to bear: just now she is to a
certain extent the proudest city in France since she holds within
her gates a hostage for the appearance on our shores of her
country's most bitter enemy. But she must not fall from that high
estate. Her double duty is clear before her: she must guard Lady
Blakeney and capture the Scarlet Pimpernel; if she fail in the
former she must be punished, if she succeed in the latter she shall
be rewarded."</p>

<p>He paused and leaned out of the window again, whilst she watched
him, breathless and terrified. She was beginning to understand.</p>

<p>"Hark!" he said, looking straight at her. "Do you hear the crier
now? He is proclaiming the punishment and the reward. He is making
it clear to the citizens of Boulogne that on the day when the
Scarlet Pimpernel falls into the hands of the Committee of Public
Safety a general amnesty will be granted to all natives of Boulogne
who are under arrest at the present time, and a free pardon to all
those who, born within these city walls, are to-day under sentence
of death...A noble reward, eh? Well deserved, you'll
admit?...Should you wonder, then, if the whole town of Boulogne
were engaged just now in finding that mysterious hero and
delivering him into our hands?...How many mothers, sisters, wives,
think you, at the present moment, would fail to lay hands on the
English adventurer, if a husband's or son's life or freedom
happened to be at stake?...I have some records here," he continued,
pointing in the direction of the table, "which tell me that there
are five-and-thirty natives of Boulogne in the local prisons, a
dozen more in the prisons in Paris; of these at least twenty have
been tried and are condemned to death. Every hour that the Scarlet
Pimpernel succeeds in evading his captors, so many deaths lie at
his door. If he succeeds in once more reaching England safely,
three-score lives mayhap will be the price of his escape...Nay! but
I see your ladyship is shivering with cold..." he added, with a dry
little laugh. "Shall I close the window? or do you wish to hear
what punishment will be meted out to Boulogne, if, on the day that
the Scarlet Pimpernel is captured, Lady Blakeney happens to have
left the shelter of these city walls?"</p>

<p>"I pray you proceed, Monsieur," she rejoined with perfect
calm.</p>

<p>"The Committee of Public Safety," he resumed, "would look upon
this city as a nest of traitors, if on the day that the Scarlet
Pimpernel becomes our prisoner Lady Blakeney herself, the wife of
that notorious English spy, had already quitted Boulogne. The whole
town knows by now that you are in our hands&mdash;you, the most
precious hostage we can hold for the ultimate capture of the man
whom we all fear and detest. Virtually the town crier is at the
present moment proclaiming to the inhabitants of this city:'We want
the man, but we already have his wife; see to it, citizens, that
she does not escape! For if she do, we shall summarily shoot the
bread-winner in every family in the town!' "</p>

<p>A cry of horror escaped Marguerite's parched lips.</p>

<p>"Are you devils, then, all of you," she gasped, "that you should
think of such things?"</p>

<p>"Aye! some of us are devils, no doubt," said Chauvelin drily;
"but why should you honour us in this case with so flattering an
epithet? We are mere men, striving to guard our property, and mean
no harm to the citizens of Boulogne. We have threatened them, true!
but is it not for you and that elusive Pimpernel to see that the
threat is never put into execution?"</p>

<p>"You would not do it!" she repeated, horror-stricken.</p>

<p>"Nay! I pray you, fair lady, do not deceive yourself. At present
the proclamation sounds like a mere threat, I'll allow, but let me
assure you that if we fail to capture the Scarlet Pimpernel, and if
you, on the other hand, are spirited out of this fortress by that
mysterious adventurer, we shall undoubtedly shoot or guillotine
every able-bodied man and woman in this town."</p>

<p>He had spoken quietly and emphatically, neither with bombast nor
with rage, and Marguerite saw in his face nothing but a calm and
ferocious determination of an entire nation embodied in this one
man, to be revenged at any cost. She would not let him see the
depth of her despair, nor would she let him read in her face the
unutterable hopelessness which filled her soul. It were useless to
make an appeal to him: she knew full well that from him she could
obtain neither gentleness nor mercy.</p>

<p>"I hope that at last I have made the situation quite clear to
your ladyship?" he was asking quite pleasantly now. "See how easy
is your position: you have but to remain quiescent in room No. 6,
and if any chance of escape be offered you ere the Scarlet
Pimpernel is captured, you need but to think of all the families in
Boulogne, who would be deprived of their bread-winner&mdash;fathers
and sons mostly, but there are girls, too, who support their
mothers or sisters: the fish-curers of Boulogne are mostly women,
and there are the net-makers and the seamstresses: all would suffer
if your ladyship were no longer to be found in No. 6 room of this
ancient fort; whilst all would be included in the amnesty if the
Scarlet Pimpernel fell into our hands..."</p>

<p>He gave a low, satisfied chuckle, which made Marguerite think of
the evil spirits in hell exulting over the torments of unhappy lost
souls.</p>

<p>"I think, Lady Blakeney," he added drily, and making her an
ironical bow, "that your humble servant hath outwitted the elusive
hero at last."</p>

<p>Quietly he turned on his heel and went back into the room,
Marguerite remaining motionless beside the open window, where the
soft, brine-laden air, the distant murmur of the sea, the
occasional cry of a sea-mew, all seemed to mock her agonising
despair.</p>

<p>The voice of the town crier came nearer and nearer now: she
could hear the words he spoke quite distinctly: something about
"amnesty" and pardon, the reward for the capture of the Scarlet
Pimpernel, the lives of men, women and children in exchange for
his.</p>

<p>Oh! she knew what all that meant!&mdash;that Percy would not
hesitate one single instant to throw his life into the hands of his
enemies, in exchange for that of others. Others! others! always
others! the sigh that had made her heart ache so often in England,
what terrible significance it bore now.</p>

<p>And how he would suffer in his heart and in his pride, because
of her whom he could not even attempt to save, since it would mean
the death of others!&mdash;of others, always of others!</p>

<p>She wondered if he had already landed in Boulogne! Again she
remembered the vision on the landing-stage: his massive figure, the
glimpse she had of the loved form, in the midst of the crowd!</p>

<p>The moment he entered the town he would hear the proclamation
read, see it posted up no doubt on every public building, and
realise that she had been foolish enough to follow him, that she
was a prisoner, and that he could do nothing to save her.</p>

<p>What would he do? Marguerite, at the thought, instinctively
pressed her hands to her heart: the agony of it all had become
physically painful. She hoped that perhaps this pain meant
approaching death! Oh! how easy would this simple solution be!</p>

<p>The moon peered out from beneath the bank of clouds which had
obscured her for so long; smiling, she drew her pencilled silver
lines along the edges of towers and pinnacles, the frowning
Beffroi, and those stony walls which seemed to Marguerite as if
they encircled a gigantic graveyard.</p>

<p>The town crier had evidently ceased to read the proclamation.
One by one the windows in the public square were lighted up from
within. The citizens of Boulogne wanted to think over the strange
events which had occurred without their knowledge, yet which were
apparently to have such direful or such joyous consequences for
them.</p>

<p>A man to be captured!&mdash;the mysterious English adventurer of
whom they had all heard, but whom nobody had seen. And a
woman&mdash;his wife&mdash;to be guarded until the man was safely
under lock and key!</p>

<p>Marguerite felt as if she could almost hear them talking it over
and vowing that she should not escape, and that the Scarlet
Pimpernel should soon be captured.</p>

<p>A gentle wind stirred the old gnarled trees on the southern
ramparts, a wind that sounded like the sigh of swiftly dying
hope.</p>

<p>What could Percy do now? His hands were tied, and he was
inevitably destined to endure the awful agony of seeing the woman
he loved die a terrible death beside him.</p>

<p>Having captured him, they would not keep him long: no necessity
for a trial, for detention, for formalities of any kind. A summary
execution at dawn on the public place, a roll of drums, a public
holiday to mark the joyful event, and a brave man will have ceased
to live, a noble heart have stilled its beatings for ever, whilst a
whole nation gloried over the deed.</p>

<p>"Sleep, citizens of Boulogne! all is still!"</p>

<p>The night watchman had replaced the town crier. All was quiet
within the city walls: the inhabitants could sleep in peace, a
beneficent Government was wakeful and guarding their rest.</p>

<p>But many of the windows in the town remained lighted up, and at
a little distance below her, round the corner so that she could not
see it, a small crowd must have collected in front of the gateway
which led into the courtyard of the Gayole Fort. Marguerite could
hear a persistent murmur of voices, mostly angry and threatening,
and once there were loud cries of: "English spies," and "&agrave;
la lanterne!"</p>

<p>"The citizens of Boulogne are guarding the treasures of France!"
commented Chauvelin drily, as he laughed again, that cruel,
mirthless laugh of his.</p>

<p>Then she roused herself from her torpor: she did not know how
long she had stood beside the open window, but the fear seized her
that that man must have seen and gloated over the agony of her
mind. She straightened her graceful figure, threw back her proud
head defiantly, and quietly walked up to the table, where Chauvelin
seemed once more absorbed in the perusal of his papers.</p>

<p>"Is this interview over?" she asked quietly, and without the
slightest tremor in her voice. "May I go now?"</p>

<p>"As soon as you wish," he replied with gentle irony.</p>

<p>He regarded her with obvious delight, for truly she was
beautiful: grand in this attitude of defiant despair. The man, who
had spent the last half-hour in martyrising her, gloried over the
misery which he had wrought, and which all her strength of will
could not entirely banish from her face.</p>

<p>"Will you believe me, Lady Blakeney," he added, "that there is
no personal animosity in my heart towards you or your husband? Have
I not told you that I do not wish to compass his death?"</p>

<p>"Yet you propose to send him to the guillotine as soon as you
have laid hands on him."</p>

<p>"I have explained to you the measures which I have taken in
order to make sure that we do lay hands on the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Once he is in our power, it will rest with him to walk to the
guillotine or to embark with you on board his yacht."</p>

<p>"You propose to place an alternative before Sir Percy
Blakeney?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"To offer him his life?"</p>

<p>"And that of his charming wife."</p>

<p>"In exchange for what?"</p>

<p>"His honour."</p>

<p>"He will refuse, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"We shall see."</p>

<p>Then he touched a handbell which stood on the table, and within
a few seconds the door was opened and the soldier who had led
Marguerite hither re-entered the room.</p>

<p>The interview was at an end. It had served its purpose.
Marguerite knew now that she must not even think of escape for
herself, or hope for safety for the man she loved. Of Chauvelin's
talk of a bargain which would touch Percy's honour she would not
even think: and she was too proud to ask anything further from
him.</p>

<p>Chauvelin stood up and made her a deep bow, as she crossed the
room and finally went out of the door. The little company of
soldiers closed in around her, and she was once more led along the
dark passages, back to her own prison cell.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24" id=

Colleagues</b>
</h2>

<p>As soon as the door had closed behind Marguerite there came from
somewhere in the room the sound of a yawn, a grunt, and a volley of
oaths.</p>

<p>The flickering light of the tallow candles had failed to
penetrate into all the corners, and now from out one of these dark
depths a certain something began to detach itself, and to move
forward towards the table at which Chauvelin had once more resumed
his seat.</p>

<p>"Has that damned aristocrat gone at last?" queried a hoarse
voice, as a burly body, clad in loose-fitting coat and mud-stained
boots and breeches, appeared within the narrow circle of light.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Chauvelin, curtly.</p>

<p>"And a cursed long time you have been with the baggage," grunted
the other surlily. "Another five minutes and I'd have taken the
matter in my own hands."</p>

<p>"An assumption of authority," commented Chauvelin, quietly, "to
which your position here does not entitle you, Citizen Collot."</p>

<p>Collot d'Herbois lounged lazily forward, and presently he threw
his ill-knit figure into the chair lately vacated by Marguerite.
His heavy, square face bore distinct traces of the fatigue endured
in the past twenty-four hours on horseback or in jolting market
waggons. His temper, too, appeared to have suffered on the way, and
at Chauvelin's curt and dictatorial replies he looked as surly as a
chained dog.</p>

<p>"You were wasting your breath over that woman," he muttered,
bringing a large and grimy fist heavily down on the table, "and
your measures are not quite so sound as you fondly imagine, Citizen
Chauvelin."</p>

<p>"They were mostly of your imagining, Citizen Collot," rejoined
the other quietly, "and of your suggestion."</p>

<p>"I added a touch of strength and determination to your mild,
milk-and-water notions, citizen," snarled Collot spitefully. "I'd
have knocked that intriguing woman's brains out at the very first
possible opportunity had I been consulted earlier than this."</p>

<p>"Quite regardless of the fact that such violent measures would
completely damn all our chances of success as far as the capture of
the Scarlet Pimpernel is concerned," remarked Chauvelin, drily,
with a contemptuous shrug of the shoulders. "Once his wife is dead,
the Englishman will never run his head into the noose which I have
so carefully prepared for him."</p>

<p>"So you say, citizen; and therefore I suggested to you certain
measures to prevent the woman escaping which you will find
adequate, I hope."</p>

<p>"You need have no fear, Citizen Collot," said Chauvelin curtly;
"this woman will make no attempt to escape now."</p>

<p>"If she does..." and Collot d'Herbois swore an obscene oath.</p>

<p>"I think she understands that we mean to put our threat in
execution."</p>

<p>"Threat?...It was no empty threat, citizen...Sacr&eacute;
tonnerre! if that woman escapes now, by all the devils in hell I
swear that I'll wield the guillotine myself and cut off the head of
every able-bodied man or woman in Boulogne with my own hands."</p>

<p>As he said this his face assumed such an expression of inhuman
cruelty, such a desire to kill, such a savage lust for blood that
instinctively Chauvelin shuddered and shrank away from his
colleague. All through his career there is no doubt that this man,
who was of gentle birth, of gentle breeding, and who had once been
called M. le Marquis de Chauvelin, must have suffered in his
susceptibilities and in his pride when in contact with the
revolutionaries with whom he had chosen to cast his lot. He could
not have thrown off all his old ideas of refinement quite so easily
as to feel happy in the presence of such men as Collot d'Herbois,
or Marat in his day&mdash;men who had become brute beasts, more
ferocious far than any wild animal; more scientifically cruel than
any feline prowler in jungle or desert.</p>

<p>One look in Collot's distorted face was sufficient at this
moment to convince Chauvelin that it were useless for him to view
the proclamation against the citizens of Boulogne merely as an idle
threat, even if he had wished to do so. That Marguerite would not
under the circumstances attempt to escape, that Sir Percy Blakeney
himself would be forced to give up all thoughts of rescuing her,
was a foregone conclusion in Chauvelin's mind, but if this
high-born English gentleman had not happened to be the selfless
hero that he was, if Marguerite Blakeney were cast in a different,
a rougher mould&mdash;if, in short, the Scarlet Pimpernel, in the
face of the proclamation did succeed in dragging his wife out of
the clutches of the Terrorists, then it was equally certain that
Collot d'Herbois would carry out his rabid and cruel reprisals to
the full. And if, in the course of the wholesale butchery of the
able-bodied and wage-earning inhabitants of Boulogne, the headsman
should sink worn out, then would this ferocious sucker of blood put
his own hand to the guillotine, with the same joy and lust which he
had felt when he ordered one hundred and thirty-eight women of
Nantes to be stripped naked by the soldiery before they were flung
helter-skelter into the river.</p>

<p>A touch of strength and determination! Aye! Citizen Collot
d'Herbois had plenty of that. Was it he, or Carri&egrave;re, who at
Arras commanded mothers to stand by while their children were being
guillotined? And surely it was Maignet, Collot's friend and
colleague, who at Bedouin, because the Red Flag of the Republic has
been mysteriously torn down over night, burnt the entire little
village down to the last hovel and guillotined every one of the
three hundred and fifty inhabitants?</p>

<p>And Chauvelin knew all that. Nay, more! he was himself a member
of that so-called government which had countenanced these
butcheries by giving unlimited powers to men like Collot, like
Maignet and Carri&egrave;re. He was at one with them in their
Republican ideas, and he believed in the regeneration and
purification of France through the medium of the guillotine, but he
propounded his theories and carried out his most bloodthirsty
schemes with physically clean hands and in an immaculately-cut
coat.</p>

<p>Even now, when Collot d'Herbois lounged before him, with
mud-bespattered legs stretched out before him, with dubious linen
at neck and wrists, and an odour of rank tobacco and stale, cheap,
wine pervading his whole personality, the more fastidious man of
the world, who had consorted with the dandies of London and
Brighton, winced at the enforced proximity.</p>

<p>But it was the joint characteristic of all these men who had
turned France into a vast butchery and charnel-house, that they all
feared and hated one another, even more whole-heartedly than they
hated the aristocrats and so-called traitors whom they sent to the
guillotine. Citizen Lebon is said to have dipped his sword into the
blood which flowed from the guillotine, whilst exclaiming: "Comme
je l'aime ce sang coul&eacute; de tra&icirc;tre!" but he and Collot
and Danton and Robespierre, all of them in fact, would have
regarded with more delight still the blood of any one of their
colleagues.</p>

<p>At this very moment Collot d'Herbois and Chauvelin would with
utmost satisfaction have denounced, one the other, to the tender
mercies of the Public Prosecutor. Collot made no secret of his
hatred for Chauvelin, and the latter disguised it but thinly under
the veneer of contemptuous indifference.</p>

<p>"As for that damned Englishman," added Collot now, after a
slight pause, and with another savage oath, "if 'tis my good
fortune to lay hands on him, I'd shoot him then and there like a
mad dog, and rid France once and for ever of this accursed
spy."</p>

<p>"And think you, Citizen Collot," rejoined Chauvelin, with a
shrug of the shoulders, "that France would be rid of all English
adventurers by the summary death of this one man?"</p>

<p>"He is the ringleader, at any rate..."</p>

<p>"And has at least nineteen disciples to continue his traditions
of conspiracy and intrigue. None, perhaps, so ingenious as himself,
none with the same daring and good luck perhaps, but still a number
of ardent fools only too ready to follow in the footsteps of their
chief. Then there's the halo of martyrdom around the murdered hero,
the enthusiasm created by his noble death...Nay! nay, citizen, you
have not lived among these English people, you do not understand
them, or you would not talk of sending their popular hero to an
honoured grave."</p>

<p>But Collot d'Herbois only shook his powerful frame like some
big, sulky dog, and spat upon the floor to express his contempt of
this wild talk, which seemed to have no real tangible purpose.</p>

<p>"You have not caught your Scarlet Pimpernel yet, citizen," he
said with a snort.</p>

<p>"No, but I will after sundown to-morrow."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I have ordered the Angelus to be rung at one of the closed
churches, and he agreed to fight a duel with me on the southern
ramparts at that hour and on that day," said Chauvelin simply.</p>

<p>"You take him for a fool?" sneered Collot.</p>

<p>"No, only for a foolhardy adventurer."</p>

<p>"You imagine that with his wife as hostage in our hands, and the
whole city of Boulogne on the look out for him for the sake of the
amnesty, the man would be fool enough to walk on those ramparts at
a given hour for the express purpose of getting himself caught by
you and your men?"</p>

<p>"I am quite sure that if we do not lay hands on him before that
given hour he will be on the ramparts at the Angelus to-morrow,"
said Chauvelin emphatically.</p>

<p>Collot shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>"Is the man mad?" he asked with an incredulous laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," rejoined the other with a smile.</p>

<p>"And having caught your hare," queried Collot, "how do you
propose to cook him?"</p>

<p>"Twelve picked men will be on the ramparts ready to seize him
the moment he appears."</p>

<p>"And to shoot him at sight, I hope."</p>

<p>"Only as a last resource, for the Englishman is powerful, and
may cause our half-famished men a good deal of trouble. But I want
him alive if possible..."</p>

<p>"Why? A dead lion is safer than a live one any day."</p>

<p>"Oh! we'll kill him right enough, citizen. I pray you have no
fear. I hold a weapon ready for that meddlesome Scarlet Pimpernel
which will be a thousand times more deadly and more effectual than
a chance shot, or even the guillotine."</p>

<p>"What weapon is that, Citizen Chauvelin?"</p>

<p>Chauvelin leaned forward across the table and rested his chin on
his hands; instinctively Collot, too, leaned towards him, and both
men peered furtively round them, as if wondering if prying ears
happened to be lurking round. It was Chauvelin's pale eyes which
now gleamed with hatred and with an insatiable lust for revenge at
least as powerful as Collot's lust for blood; the unsteady light of
the tallow candles threw grotesque shadows across his brows, and
his mouth was set in such rigid lines of implacable cruelty that
the brutish sot beside him gazed on him amazed, vaguely scenting
here a depth of feeling which was beyond his power to comprehend.
He repeated his question under his breath:</p>

<p>"What weapon do you mean to use against that accursed spy,
Citizen Chauvelin?"</p>

<p>"Dishonour and ridicule!" replied the other quietly.</p>

<p>"Bah!"</p>

<p>"In exchange for his life and that of his wife."</p>

<p>"As the woman told you just now...he will refuse."</p>

<p>"We shall see, citizen."</p>

<p>"You are mad to think such things, citizen, and ill serve the
Republic by sparing her bitterest foe."</p>

<p>A long, sarcastic laugh broke from Chauvelin's parted lips.</p>

<p>"Spare him?&mdash;Spare the Scarlet Pimpernel!..." he
ejaculated. "Nay, citizen, you need have no fear of that. But,
believe me, I have schemes in my head by which the man, whom we all
hate, will be more truly destroyed than your guillotine could ever
accomplish; schemes whereby the hero who is now worshipped in
England as a demi-god will suddenly become an object of loathing
and of contempt...Ah! I see you understand me now...I wish to so
cover him with ridicule that the very name of the small wayside
flower will become a term of derision and of scorn. Only then shall
we be rid of these pestilential English spies, only then will the
entire League of the Scarlet Pimpernel become a thing of the past
when its whilom leader, now thought akin to a god, will have found
refuge in a suicide's grave from the withering contempt of the
entire world."</p>

<p>Chauvelin had spoken low, hardly above a whisper, and the echo
of his last words died away in the great, squalid room like a long
drawn out sigh. There was dead silence for awhile save for the
murmur of the wind outside and from the floor above the measured
tread of the sentinel guarding the precious hostage in No. 6.</p>

<p>Both men were staring straight in front of them. Collot
d'Herbois, incredulous, half-contemptuous, did not altogether
approve of these schemes, which seemed to him wild and uncanny; he
liked the direct simplicity of a summary trial, of the guillotine,
or of his own well stage-managed "Noyades". He did not feel that
any ridicule or dishonour would necessarily paralyse a man in his
efforts at intrigue, and would have liked to set Chauvelin's
authority aside, to behead the woman upstairs and then to take his
chance of capturing the man later on.</p>

<p>But the orders of the Committee of Public Safety had been
peremptory: he was to be Chauvelin's help, not his master, and to
obey him in all things. He did not dare to take any initiative in
the matter, for in that case, if he failed, the reprisals against
him would indeed be terrible.</p>

<p>He was fairly satisfied now that Chauvelin had accepted his
suggestion of summarily sending to the guillotine one member of
every family resident in Boulogne if Marguerite succeeded in
effecting an escape, and, of a truth, Chauvelin had hailed the
fiendish suggestion with delight. The old abb&eacute;, with his
nephew and niece, were undoubtedly not sufficient deterrents
against the daring schemes of the Scarlet Pimpernel, who, as a
matter of fact, could spirit them out of Boulogne just as easily as
he would his own wife.</p>

<p>Collot's plan tied Marguerite to her own prison cell more
completely than any other measure could have done, more so, indeed,
than the originator thereof knew or believed...A man like this
d'Herbois&mdash;born in the gutter, imbued with every brutish
tradition which generations of jail-birds had bequeathed to
him&mdash;would not, perhaps, fully realise the fact that neither
Sir Percy nor Marguerite Blakeney would ever save themselves at the
expense of others. He had merely made the suggestion, because he
felt that Chauvelin's plans were complicated and obscure, and,
above all, insufficient, and that perhaps after all the English
adventurer and his wife would succeed in once more outwitting him,
when there would remain the grand and bloody compensation of a
wholesale butchery in Boulogne.</p>

<p>But Chauvelin was quite satisfied. He knew that under present
circumstances neither Sir Percy nor Marguerite would make any
attempt at escape. The ex-ambassador had lived in England; he
understood the class to which these two belonged, and was quite
convinced that no attempt would be made on either side to get Lady
Blakeney away, whilst the present ferocious order against the
bread-winner of every family in the town held good.</p>

<p>Aye! the measures were sound enough. Chauvelin was easy in his
mind about that. In another twenty-four hours he would hold the man
completely in his power who had so boldly outwitted him last year;
to-night he would sleep in peace&mdash;an entire city was guarding
the precious hostage.</p>

<p>"We'll go to bed now, citizen," he said to Collot, who, tired
and sulky, was moodily fingering the papers on the table. The
scraping sound which he made thereby grated on Chauvelin's
overstrung nerves. He wanted to be alone, and the sleepy brute's
presence here jarred on his own solemn mood.</p>

<p>To his satisfaction, Collot grunted a surly assent. Very
leisurely he rose from his chair, stretched out his loose limbs,
shook himself like a shaggy cur, and, without uttering another
word, he gave his colleague a curt nod and slowly lounged out of
the room.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25" id=
"Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
The Unexpected</b>
</h2>

<p>Chauvelin heaved a deep sigh of satisfaction when Collot
d'Herbois finally left him to himself. He listened for awhile until
the heavy footsteps died away in the distance, then leaning back in
his chair, he gave himself over to the delights of the present
situation.</p>

<p>Marguerite was in his power. Sir Percy Blakeney compelled to
treat for her rescue if he did not wish to see her die a miserable
death.</p>

<p>"Aye! my elusive hero," he muttered to himself, "methinks that
we shall be able to cry quits at last."</p>

<p>Outside everything had become still. Even the wind in the trees
out there on the ramparts had ceased their melancholy moaning. The
man was alone with his thoughts. He felt secure and at peace, sure
of victory, content to await the events of the next twenty-four
hours. The other side of the door, the guard, which he had picked
out from amongst the more feeble and ill-fed garrison of the little
city for attendance on his own person, were ranged ready to respond
to his call.</p>

<p>"Dishonour and ridicule! Derision and scorn!" he murmured,
gloating over the very sound of these words, which expressed all
that he hoped to accomplish, "utter abjection, then perhaps a
suicide's grave..."</p>

<p>He loved the silence around him, for he could murmur these words
and hear them echoing against the bare stone walls like the
whisperings of all the spirits of hate which were waiting to lend
him their aid.</p>

<p>How long he had remained thus absorbed in his meditations he
could not afterwards have said; a minute or two perhaps at most,
whilst he leaned back in his chair with eyes closed, savouring the
sweets of his own thoughts, when suddenly the silence was
interrupted by a loud and pleasant laugh and a drawly voice
speaking in merry accents:</p>

<p>"The Lud love you, Monsieur Chaubertin! and pray how do you
propose to accomplish all these pleasant things?"</p>

<p>In a moment Chauvelin was on his feet, and with eyes dilated,
lips parted in awed bewilderment, he was gazing towards the open
window, where, astride upon the sill, one leg inside the room, the
other out, and with the moon shining full on his suit of
delicate-coloured cloth, his wide-caped coat and elegant
chapeau-bras, sat the imperturbable Sir Percy.</p>

<p>"I heard you muttering such pleasant words, Monsieur," continued
Blakeney calmly, "that the temptation seized me to join in the
conversation. A man talking to himself is ever in a sorry
plight...he is either a madman or a fool..."</p>

<p>He laughed his own quaint and inane laugh, and added,
apologetically:</p>

<p>"Far be it from me, sir, to apply either epithet to you...demmed
bad form calling another fellow names...just when he does not quite
feel himself, eh?...You don't feel quite yourself, I fancy, just
now...eh, Monsieur Chaubertin...er...beg pardon, Chauvelin?..."</p>

<p>He sat there quite comfortably, one slender hand resting on the
gracefully fashioned hilt of his sword&mdash;the sword of Lorenzo
Cenci&mdash;the other holding up the gold-rimmed eyeglass, through
which he was regarding his avowed enemy; he was dressed as for a
ball, and his perpetually amiable smile lurked round the corners of
his firm lips.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had undoubtedly for the moment lost his presence of
mind. He did not think of calling to his picked guard, so
completely taken aback was he by this unforeseen move on the part
of Sir Percy. Yet, obviously, he should have been ready for this
eventuality. Had he not caused the town crier to loudly proclaim
throughout the city that if <i>one</i> female prisoner escaped from
Fort Gayole the entire able-bodied population of Boulogne would
suffer?</p>

<p>The moment Sir Percy entered the gates of the town, he could not
help but hear the proclamation, and hear at the same time that this
one female prisoner who was so precious a charge was the wife of
the English spy, the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>Moreover, was it not a fact that whenever or wherever the
Scarlet Pimpernel was least expected, there and then would he
surely appear? Having once realised that it was his wife who was
incarcerated in Fort Gayole, was it not natural that he would go
and prowl around the prison, and along the avenue on the summit of
the southern ramparts, which was accessible to every passer-by? No
doubt he had laid in hiding among the trees, had perhaps caught
snatches of Chauvelin's recent talk with Collot.</p>

<p>Aye! it was all so natural, so simple! Strange that it should
have been so unexpected!</p>

<p>Furious at himself for his momentary stupor, he now made a
vigorous effort to face his impudent enemy with the same sang-froid
of which the latter had so inexhaustible a fund.</p>

<p>He walked quietly towards the window, compelling his nerves to
perfect calm and his mood to indifference. The situation had ceased
to astonish him; already his keen mind had seen its possibilities,
its grimness, and its humour, and he was quite prepared to enjoy
these to the full.</p>

<p>Sir Percy now was dusting the sleeve of his coat with a
lace-edged handkerchief, but just as Chauvelin was about to come
near him, he stretched out one leg, turning the point of a dainty
boot towards the ex-ambassador.</p>

<p>"Would you like to take hold of me by the leg, Monsieur
Chaubertin?" he said gaily. "'Tis more effectual than a shoulder,
and your picked guard of six stalwart fellows can have the other
leg...Nay! I pray you, sir, do not look at me like that...I vow
that it is myself and not my ghost...But if you still doubt me, I
pray you call the guard...ere I fly out again towards the fitful
moon..."</p>

<p>"Nay, Sir Percy," said Chauvelin, with a steady voice, "I have
no thought that you will take flight just yet...Methinks you desire
conversation with me, or you had not paid me so unexpected a
visit."</p>

<p>"Nay, sir, the air is too oppressive for lengthy
conversation...I was strolling along these ramparts, thinking of
our pleasant encounter at the hour of the Angelus to-morrow...when
this light attracted me...I feared I had lost my way, and climbed
the window to obtain information."</p>

<p>"As to your way to the nearest prison cell, Sir Percy?" queried
Chauvelin drily.</p>

<p>"As to anywhere, where I could sit more comfortably than on this
demmed sill...It must be very dusty, and I vow 'tis terribly
hard..."</p>

<p>"I presume, Sir Percy, that you did my colleague and myself the
honour of listening to our conversation?"</p>

<p>"An you desired to talk secrets,
Monsieur...er...Chaubertin...you should have shut this window...and
closed this avenue of trees against the chance passer-by."</p>

<p>"What we said was no secret, Sir Percy. It is all over the town
to-night."</p>

<p>"Quite so...you were only telling the devil your mind...eh?"</p>

<p>"I had also been having conversations with Lady Blakeney...Did
you hear any of that, sir?"</p>

<p>But Sir Percy had evidently not heard this question, for he
seemed quite absorbed in the task of removing a speck of dust from
his immaculate chapeau-bras.</p>

<p>"These hats are all the rage in England just now," he said
airily, "but they have had their day, do you not think so,
Monsieur? When I return to town, I shall have to devote my whole
mind to the invention of a new headgear..."</p>

<p>"When will you return to England, Sir Percy?" queried Chauvelin
with good-natured sarcasm.</p>

<p>"At the turn of the tide to-morrow eve, Monsieur," replied
Blakeney.</p>

<p>"In company with Lady Blakeney?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir...and yours, if you will honour us with your
company."</p>

<p>"If you return to England to-morrow, Sir Percy, Lady Blakeney, I
fear me, cannot accompany you."</p>

<p>"You astonish me, sir," rejoined Blakeney, with an exclamation
of genuine and unaffected surprise. "I wonder, now, what would
prevent her?"</p>

<p>"All those whose death would be the result of her flight, if she
succeeded in escaping from Boulogne..."</p>

<p>But Sir Percy was staring at him, with wide open eyes,
expressive of utmost amazement.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear, dear...Lud! but that sounds most
unfortunate..."</p>

<p>"You have not heard of the measures which I have taken to
prevent Lady Blakeney quitting this city without our leave?"</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur Chaubertin...no...I have heard nothing..."
rejoined Sir Percy blandly. "I lead a very retired life when I come
abroad, and..."</p>

<p>"Would you wish to hear them now?"</p>

<p>"Quite unnecessary, sir, I assure you...and the hour is getting
late."</p>

<p>"Sir Percy, are you aware of the fact that unless you listen to
what I have to say, your wife will be dragged before the Committee
of Public Safety in Paris within the next twenty-four hours?" said
Chauvelin firmly.</p>

<p>"What swift horses you must have, sir," quoth Blakeney
pleasantly. "Lud! to think of it!...I always heard that these
demmed French horses would never beat ours across country."</p>

<p>But Chauvelin now would not allow himself to be ruffled by Sir
Percy's apparent indifference. Keen reader of emotions as he was,
he had not failed to note a distant change in the drawly voice, a
sound of something hard and trenchant in the flippant laugh, ever
since Marguerite's name was first mentioned. Blakeney's attitude
was apparently as careless, as audacious as before, but Chauvelin's
keen eyes had not missed the almost imperceptible tightening of the
jaw and the rapid clenching of one hand on the sword hilt, even
whilst the other toyed in graceful idleness with the filmy Mechlin
lace cravat.</p>

<p>Sir Percy's head was well thrown back, and the pale rays of the
moon caught the edge of the clear-cut profile, the low massive
brow, the drooping lids through which the audacious plotter was
lazily regarding the man who held not only his own life, but that
of the woman who was infinitely dear to him, in the hollow of his
hand.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Sir Percy," continued Chauvelin drily, "that you
are under the impression that bolts and bars will yield to your
usual good luck, now that so precious a life is at stake as that of
Lady Blakeney."</p>

<p>"I am a great believer in impressions, Monsieur Chauvelin."</p>

<p>"I told her just now that if she quitted Boulogne ere the
Scarlet Pimpernel is in our hands, we would summarily shoot one
member of every family in the town&mdash;the bread-winner."</p>

<p>"A pleasant conceit, Monsieur...and one that does infinite
credit to your inventive faculties."</p>

<p>"Lady Blakeney, therefore, we hold safely enough," continued
Chauvelin, who no longer heeded the mocking observations of his
enemy, "as for the Scarlet Pimpernel..."</p>

<p>"You have but to ring a bell, to raise a voice, and he, too,
will be under lock and key within the next two minutes,
eh?...Passons, Monsieur...you are dying to say something
further...I pray you proceed...your engaging countenance is
becoming quite interesting in its seriousness."</p>

<p>"What I wish to say to you, Sir Percy, is in the nature of a
proposed bargain."</p>

<p>"Indeed?...Monsieur, you are full of surprises...like a pretty
woman...And pray, what are the terms of this proposed bargain?"</p>

<p>"Your side of the bargain, Sir Percy, or mine? Which will you
hear first?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yours, Monsieur...yours, I pray you...Have I not said that
you are like a pretty woman?...Place aux dames, sir! always!"</p>

<p>"My share of the bargain, sir, is simple enough: Lady Blakeney,
escorted by yourself and any of your friends who might be in the
city at the time, shall leave Boulogne harbour at sunset to-morrow,
free and unmolested, if you on the other hand will do your
share..."</p>

<p>"I don't yet know what my share in this interesting bargain is
to be, sir...but, for the sake of argument, let us suppose that I
do not carry it out...What then?..."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir Percy...putting aside for the moment the question of
the Scarlet Pimpernel altogether...then, Lady Blakeney will be
taken to Paris, and will be incarcerated in the prison of the
Temple, lately vacated by Marie Antoinette&mdash;there she will be
treated in exactly the same way as the ex-queen is now being
treated in the Conciergerie...Do you know what that means, Sir
Percy?...It does not mean a summary trial and a speedy death, with
the halo and glory of martyrdom thrown in...it means days, weeks,
nay, months, perhaps, of misery and humiliation...it means, that,
like Marie Antoinette, she will never be allowed solitude for one
single instant of the day or night...it means the constant
proximity of soldiers, drunk with cruelty and with hate...the
insults, the shame..."</p>

<p>"You hound!...you dog!...you cur!...do you not see that I must
strangle you for this?..."</p>

<p>That attack had been so sudden and so violent that Chauvelin had
not the time to utter the slightest call for help. But a second
ago, Sir Percy Blakeney had been sitting on the window-sill,
outwardly listening with perfect calm to what his enemy had to say;
now, he was at the latter's throat, pressing with long and slender
hands the breath out of the Frenchman's body, his usually placid
face distorted into a mask of hate.</p>

<p>"You cur!...you cur!..." he repeated; "am I to kill you, or will
you unsay those words?"</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, he relaxed his grip. The habits of a lifetime
would not be gainsaid even now. A second ago his face had been
livid with rage and hate, now a quick flush overspread it, as if he
were ashamed of this loss of self-control. He threw the little
Frenchman away from him like he would a beast which had snarled,
and passed his hand across his brow.</p>

<p>"Lud forgive me!" he said quaintly, "I had almost lost my
temper."</p>

<p>Chauvelin was not slow in recovering himself. He was plucky and
alert, and his hatred for this man was so great that he had
actually ceased to fear him. Now he quietly readjusted his cravat,
made a vigorous effort to reconquer his breath, and said, firmly,
as soon as he could contrive to speak at all:</p>

<p>"And if you did strangle me, Sir Percy, you would do yourself no
good. The fate which I have mapped out for Lady Blakeney would then
irrevocably be hers, for she is in our power, and none of my
colleagues are disposed to offer you a means of saving her from it,
as I am ready to do."</p>

<p>Blakeney was now standing in the middle of the room, with his
hands buried in the pockets of his breeches, his manner and
attitude once more calm, debonnair, expressive of lofty
self-possession and of absolute indifference. He came quite close
to the meagre, little figure of his exultant enemy, thereby forcing
the latter to look up at him.</p>

<p>"Oh!...ah!...yes!" he said airily, "I had nigh forgotten...you
were talking of a bargain...my share of it...eh?...Is it me you
want?...Do you wish to see me in your Paris prisons?...I assure
you, sir, that the propinquinty of drunken soldiers may disgust me,
but it would in no way disturb the equanimity of my temper."</p>

<p>"I am quite sure of that, Sir Percy&mdash;and I can but repeat
what I had the honour of saying to Lady Blakeney just now&mdash;I
do not desire the death of so accomplished a gentleman as
yourself."</p>

<p>"Strange, Monsieur," retorted Blakeney, with a return of his
accustomed flippancy. "Now I do desire your death very strongly
indeed&mdash;there would be so much less vermin on the face of the
earth...But pardon me&mdash;I was interrupting you...Will you be so
kind as to proceed?"</p>

<p>Chauvelin had not winced at the insult. His enemy's attitude now
left him completely indifferent. He had seen that self-possessed
man of the world, that dainty and fastidious dandy, in the throes
of an overmastering passion. He had very nearly paid with his life
for the joy of having roused that supercilious and dormant lion. In
fact, he was ready to welcome any insults from Sir Percy Blakeney
now, since these would be only additional evidences that the
Englishman's temper was not yet under control.</p>

<p>"I will try to be brief, Sir Percy," he said, setting himself
the task of imitating his antagonist's affected manner. "Will you
not sit down?...We must try and discuss these matters like two men
of the world...As for me, I am always happiest beside a board
littered with papers...I am not an athlete, Sir Percy...and serve
my country with my pen rather than with my fists."</p>

<p>Whist he spoke he had reached the table, and once more took the
chair whereon he had been sitting lately, when he dreamed the
dreams which were so near realisation now. He pointed with a
graceful gesture to the other vacant chair, which Blakeney took
without a word.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Chauvelin, with a sigh of satisfaction, "I see that
we are about to understand one another...I have always felt that it
was a pity, Sir Percy, that you and I could not discuss certain
matters pleasantly with one another...Now, about this unfortunate
incident of Lady Blakeney's incarceration, I would like you to
believe that I had no part in the arrangements which have been made
for her detention in Paris. My colleagues have arranged it
all...and I have vainly tried to protest against the rigorous
measures which are to be enforced against her in the Temple
prison...But these are answering so admirably in the case of the
ex-queen, they have so completely broken her spirit and her pride,
that my colleagues felt that they would prove equally useful in
order to bring the Scarlet Pimpernel&mdash;through his
wife&mdash;to an humbler frame of mind."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, distinctly pleased with his preoration,
satisfied that his voice had been without a tremor and his face
impassive, and wondering what effect this somewhat lengthy preamble
had upon Sir Percy, who through it all had remained singularly
quiet. Chauvelin was preparing himself for the next effect which he
hoped to produce, and was vaguely seeking for the best words with
which to fully express his meaning, when he was suddenly startled
by a sound as unexpected as it was disconcerting.</p>

<p>It was the sound of a loud and prolonged snore. He pushed the
candle aside, which somewhat obstructed his line of vision, and
casting a rapid glance at the enemy, with whose life he was toying,
even as a cat doth with that of a mouse, he saw that the aforesaid
mouse was calmly and unmistakably asleep.</p>

<p>An impatient oath escaped Chauvelin's lips, and he brought his
fist heavily down on the table, making the metal candlesticks
rattle and causing Sir Percy to open one sleepy eye.</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons, sir," said Blakeney, with a slight yawn. "I
am so demmed fatigued, and your preface was unduly long...Beastly
bad form, I know, going to sleep during a sermon...but I haven't
had a wink of sleep all day...I pray you to excuse me..."</p>

<p>"Will you condescend to listen, Sir Percy?" queried Chauvelin
peremptorily, "or shall I call the guard and give up all thoughts
of treating with you?"</p>

<p>"Just which ever you demmed well prefer, sir," rejoined Blakeney
imperturbably.</p>

<p>And once more stretching out his long limbs, he buried his hands
in the pockets of his breeches and apparently prepared himself for
another quiet sleep. Chauvelin looked at him for a moment, vaguely
wondering what to do next. He felt strangely irritated at what he
firmly believed was mere affectation on Blakeney's part, and
although he was burning with impatience to place the terms of the
proposed bargain before this man, yet he would have preferred to be
interrogated, to deliver his "either-or" with becoming sternness
and decision, rather than to take the initiative in this
discussion, where he should have been calm and indifferent, whilst
his enemy should have been nervous and disturbed.</p>

<p>Sir Percy's attitude had disconcerted him, a touch of the
grotesque had been given to what should have been a tense moment,
and it was terribly galling to the pride of the ex-diplomatist that
with this elusive enemy, and in spite of his own preparedness for
any eventuality, it was invariably the unforeseen that
happened.</p>

<p>After a moment's reflection, however, he decided upon a fresh
course of action. He rose and crossed the room, keeping as much as
possible an eye upon Sir Percy, but the latter sat placid and
dormant, and evidently in no hurry to move. Chauvelin, having
reached the door, opened it noiselessly, and to the sergeant in
command of his bodyguard who stood at attention outside, he
whispered hurriedly:</p>

<p>"The prisoner from No. 6...Let two of the men bring her hither
back to me at once."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26" id=
"Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
The Terms of the Bargain</b>
</h2>

<p>Less than three minutes later, there came to Chauvelin's
expectant ears the soft sound made by a woman's skirts against the
stone floor. During those three minutes, which had seemed an
eternity to his impatience, he had sat silently watching the
slumber&mdash;affected or real&mdash;of his enemy.</p>

<p>Directly he heard the word "Halt!" outside the door, he jumped
to his feet. The next moment Marguerite had entered the room.</p>

<p>Hardly had her foot crossed the threshold than Sir Percy rose,
quietly and without haste but evidently fully awake, and, turning
towards her, made her a low obeisance.</p>

<p>She, poor woman, had, of course, caught sight of him at once.
His presence here, Chauvelin's demand for her reappearance, the
soldiers in a small, compact group outside the door&mdash;all these
were unmistakable proofs that the awful cataclysm had at last
occurred.</p>

<p>The Scarlet Pimpernel, Percy Blakeney, her husband, was in the
hands of the Terrorists of France, and, though face to face with
her now, with an open window close to him, and an apparently
helpless enemy under his hand, he could not&mdash;owing to the
fiendish measures taken by Chauvelin&mdash;raise a finger to save
himself or her.</p>

<p>Mercifully for her, nature&mdash;in the face of this appalling
tragedy&mdash;deprived her of the full measure of her senses. She
could move and speak and see, she could hear and in a measure
understand what was said, but she was really an automaton or a
sleepwalker, moving and speaking mechanically and without due
comprehension.</p>

<p>Possibly, if she had then and there fully realised all that the
future meant, she would have gone mad with the horror of it
all.</p>

<p>"Lady Blakeney," began Chauvelin after he had quickly dismissed
the soldiers from the room, "when you and I parted from one another
just now, I had no idea that I should so soon have the pleasure of
a personal conversation with Sir Percy...There is no occasion yet,
believe me, for sorrow or for fear...Another twenty-four hours at
most, and you will be on board the <i>Day Dream</i> outward bound
for England. Sir Percy himself might perhaps accompany you, he does
not desire that you should journey to Paris, and I may safely say
that, in his mind, he has already accepted certain little
conditions which I have been forced to impose upon him, ere I sign
the order for your absolute release."</p>

<p>"Conditions?" she repeated vaguely and stupidly, looking in
bewilderment from one to the other.</p>

<p>"You are tired, m'dear," said Sir Percy quietly; "will you not
sit down?"</p>

<p>He held the chair gallantly for her. She tried to read his face,
but could not catch even a flash from beneath the heavy lids which
obstinately veiled his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh! it is a mere matter of exchanging signatures," continued
Chauvelin, in response to her inquiring glance, and toying with the
papers which were scattered on the table. "Here, you see, is the
order to allow Sir Percy Blakeney and his wife, n&eacute;e
Marguerite St. Just, to quit the town of Boulogne unmolested."</p>

<p>He held a paper out towards Marguerite, inviting her to look at
it. She caught sight of an official-looking document, bearing the
motto and seal of the Republic of France, and of her own name and
Percy's written thereon in full.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly on r&egrave;gle, I assure you," continued
Chauvelin, "and only awaits my signature."</p>

<p>He now took up another paper, which looked like a long,
closely-written letter. Marguerite watched his every movement, for
instinct told her that the supreme moment had come. There was a
look of almost superhuman cruelty and malice in the little
Frenchman's eyes as he fixed them on the impassive figure of Sir
Percy, the while, with slightly trembling hands, he fingered that
piece of paper and smoothed out its creases with loving care.</p>

<p>"I am quite prepared to sign the order for your release, Lady
Blakeney," he said, keeping his gaze still keenly fixed upon Sir
Percy. "When it is signed, you will understand that our measures
against the citizens of Boulogne will no longer hold good, and
that, on the contrary, the general amnesty and free pardon will
come into force."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand that," she replied.</p>

<p>"And all that will come to pass, Lady Blakeney, the moment Sir
Percy will write me in his own hand a letter, in accordance with
the draft which I have prepared, and sign it with his name."</p>

<p>"Shall I read it to you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"If you please."</p>

<p>"You will see how simple it all is...A mere matter of form...I
pray you, do not look upon it with terror, but only as the prelude
to that general amnesty and free pardon, which I feel sure will
satisfy the philanthropic heart of the noble Scarlet Pimpernel,
since three-score at least of the inhabitants of Boulogne will owe
their life and freedom to him."</p>

<p>"I am listening, Monsieur," she said calmly.</p>

<p>"As I have already had the honour of explaining, this little
document is in the form of a letter addressed personally to me,
and, of course, in French," he said finally; then he looked down on
the paper and began to read:</p>

<p class="note">Citizen Chauvelin, &mdash;In consideration of a
further sum of one million francs, and on the understanding that
this ridiculous charge brought against me of conspiring against the
Republic of France is immediately withdrawn, and I am allowed to
return to England unmolested, I am quite prepared to acquaint you
with the names and whereabouts of certain persons who, under the
guise of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, are even now
conspiring to free the woman Marie Antoinette and her son from
prison, and to place the latter upon the throne of France. You are
quite well aware that under the pretence of being the leader of a
gang of English adventurers, who never did the Republic of France
and her people any real harm, I have actually been the means of
unmasking many a Royalist plot before you, and of bringing many
persistent conspirators to the guillotine. I am surprised that you
should cavil at the price I am asking this time for the very
important information with which I am able to furnish you, whilst
you have often paid me similar sums for work which was a great deal
less difficult to do. In order to serve your Government
effectually, both in England and in France, I must have a
sufficiency of money, to enable me to live in a costly style
befitting a gentleman of my rank. Were I to alter my mode of life I
could not continue to mix in that same social milieu to which all
my friends belong, and wherein, as you are well aware, most of the
Royalist plots are hatched.</p>

<p class="note">Trusting, therefore, to receive a favourable reply
to my just demands within the next twenty-four hours, whereupon the
names in question shall be furnished you forthwith,&mdash;I have
the honour to remain, citizen, your humble and obedient
servant.</p>

<p>When he had finished reading, Chauvelin quietly folded the paper
up again, and then only did he look at the man and the woman before
him.</p>

<p>Marguerite sat very erect, her head thrown back, her face very
pale, and her hands tightly clutched in her lap. She had not
stirred whilst Chauvelin read out the infamous document, with which
he desired to brand a brave man with the ineradicable stigma of
dishonour and of shame. After she heard the first words, she looked
up swiftly and questioningly at her husband, but he stood at some
little distance from her, right out of the flickering circle of
yellowish light made by the burning tallow candles. He was as rigid
as a statue, standing in his usual attitude, with legs apart and
hands buried in his breeches pockets.</p>

<p>She could not see his face.</p>

<p>Whatever she may have felt with regard to the letter, as the
meaning of it gradually penetrated into her brain, she was, of
course, convinced of one thing, and that was that never for a
moment would Percy dream of purchasing his life or even hers at
such a price. But she would have liked some sign from him, some
look by which she could be guided as to her immediate conduct: as,
however, he gave neither look nor sign, she preferred to assume an
attitude of silent contempt.</p>

<p>But even before Chauvelin had had time to look from one face to
the other, a prolonged and merry laugh echoed across the squalid
room.</p>

<p>Sir Percy, with head thrown back, was laughing
whole-heartedly.</p>

<p>"A magnificent epistle, sir," he said gaily. "Lud love you,
where did you learn to wield the pen so gracefully?...I vow that if
I signed this interesting document, no one would believe I could
have expressed myself with such perfect ease...and in French,
too..."</p>

<p>"Nay, Sir Percy," rejoined Chauvelin drily, "I have thought of
all that, and lest in the future there should be any doubt as to
whether your own hand had or had not penned the whole of this
letter, I also make it a condition that you write out every word of
it yourself, and sign it here in this very room, in the presence of
Lady Blakeney, of myself, of my colleague, and of at least half a
dozen other persons whom I will select."</p>

<p>"It is indeed admirably thought out, Monsieur," rejoined Sir
Percy, "and what is to become of the charming epistle, may I ask,
after I have written and signed it?...Pardon my curiosity...I take
a natural interest in the matter...and truly your ingenuity passes
belief..."</p>

<p>"Oh! the fate of this letter will be as simple as was the
writing thereof...A copy of it will be published in our <i>Gazette
de Paris</i>, as a bait for enterprising English journalists...They
will not be backward in getting hold of so much interesting
matter...Can you not see the attractive headlines in <i>The London
Gazette</i>, Sir Percy?'The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel
unmasked! A gigantic hoax! The origin of the Blakeney
millions!'...I believe that journalism in England has reached a
high standard of excellence...and even the <i>Gazette de Paris</i>
is greatly read in certain towns of your charming country...His
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, and various other influential
gentlemen in London, will, on the other hand, be granted a private
view of the original, through the kind offices of certain devoted
friends whom we possess in England...I don't think that you need
have any fear, Sir Percy, that your calligraphy will sink into
oblivion. It will be our business to see that it obtains the full
measure of publicity which it deserves..."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, then his manner suddenly changed: the
sarcastic tone died out of his voice, and there came back into his
face that look of hatred and cruelty which Blakeney's persiflage
had always the power to evoke.</p>

<p>"You may rest assured of one thing, Sir Percy," he said with a
harsh laugh, "that enough mud will be thrown at that erstwhile
glorious Scarlet Pimpernel...some of it will be bound to
stick..."</p>

<p>"Nay, Monsieur...er...Chaubertin," quoth Blakeney lightly, "I
have no doubt that you and your colleagues are past masters in the
graceful art of mud-throwing...But pardon me...er...I was
interrupting you...Continue, Monsieur...continue, I pray. 'Pon my
honour, the matter is vastly diverting."</p>

<p>"Nay, sir. After the publication of this diverting epistle,
meseems your honour will cease to be a marketable commodity."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, sir," rejoined Sir Percy, apparently quite
unruffled; "pardon a slip of the tongue...we are so much the
creatures of habit...As you were saying...?"</p>

<p>"I have but little more to say, sir...But lest there should even
now be lurking in your mind a vague hope that, having written this
letter, you could easily in the future deny its authorship, let me
tell you this: my measures are well taken: there will be witnesses
to your writing of it...You will sit here in this room, unfettered,
uncoerced in any way...and the money spoken of in the letter will
be handed over to you by my colleague, after a few suitable words
spoken by him, and you will take the money from him, Sir
Percy...and the witnesses will see you take it, after having seen
you write the letter...they will understand that you are being
<i>paid</i> by the French Government for giving information anent
Royalist plots in this country and in England...they will
understand that your identity as the leader of the so-called band
is not only known to me and to my colleague, but that it also
covers your real character and profession as the paid spy of
France."</p>

<p>"Marvellous, I call it...demmed marvellous," quoth Sir Percy
blandly.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had paused, half-choked by his own emotion, his
hatred, and prospective revenge. He passed his handkerchief over
his forehead, which was streaming with perspiration.</p>

<p>"Warm work, this sort of
thing...eh...Monsieur...er...Chaubertin?..." queried his
imperturbable enemy.</p>

<p>Marguerite said nothing; the whole thing was too horrible for
words; but she kept her large eyes fixed upon her husband's
face...waiting for that look, that sign from him which would have
eased the agonising anxiety in her heart, and which never came.</p>

<p>With a great effort now, Chauvelin pulled himself together, and
though his voice still trembled, he managed to speak with a certain
amount of calm:</p>

<p>"Probably, Sir Percy, you know," he said, "that throughout the
whole of France we are inaugurating a series of national
f&ecirc;tes, in honour of the new religion which the people are
about to adopt...Demoiselle D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille, whom
you know, will at these festivals impersonate the Goddess of
Reason, the only deity whom we admit now in France...She has been
specially chosen for this honour, owing to the services which she
has rendered us recently...and as Boulogne happens to be the lucky
city in which we have succeeded in bringing the Scarlet Pimpernel
to justice, the national f&ecirc;te will begin within these city
walls, with Demoiselle Candeille as the thrice-honoured
goddess."</p>

<p>"And you will be very merry here in Boulogne, I dare
swear..."</p>

<p>"Aye, merry, sir," said Chauvelin with an involuntary and savage
snarl, as he placed a long, claw-like finger upon the momentous
paper before him, "merry, for we here in Boulogne will see that
which will fill the heart of every patriot in France with
gladness...Nay! &#8217;twas not the death of the Scarlet Pimpernel
we wanted...not the noble martyrdom of England's chosen hero...but
his humiliation and defeat...derision and scorn...contumely and
contempt. You asked me airily just now, Sir Percy, how I proposed
to accomplish this object...Well! you know it now&mdash;by forcing
you...aye, <i>forcing</i>&mdash;to write and sign a letter, and to
take money from my hands which will brand you for ever as a liar
and an informer, and cover you with thick and slimy mud of
irreclaimable infamy..."</p>

<p>"Lud! sir," said Sir Percy pleasantly, "what a wonderful command
you have our language...I wish I could speak French half as well
..."</p>

<p>Marguerite had risen like an automaton from her chair. She felt
that she could no longer sit still; she wanted to scream out at the
top of her voice all the horror she felt for this dastardly plot,
which surely must have had its origin in the brain of devils. She
could not understand Percy. This was one of those awful moments,
which she had been destined to experience once or twice before,
when the whole personality of her husband seemed to become shadowy
before her, to slip, as it were, past her comprehension, leaving
her indescribably lonely and wretched, trusting, yet terrified.</p>

<p>She thought that long ere this he would have flung back every
insult in his opponent's teeth; she did not know what inducements
Chauvelin had held out in exchange for the infamous letter, what
threats he had used. That her own life and freedom were at stake
was, of course, evident; but she cared nothing for life, and he
should know that certainly she would care still less, if such a
price had to be paid for it.</p>

<p>She longed to tell him all that was in her heart, longed to tell
him how little she valued her life, how highly she prized his
honour! But how could she, before this fiend, who snarled and
sneered in his anticipated triumph? And surely, surely Percy
knew!</p>

<p>And, knowing all that, why did he not speak? Why did he not tear
that infamous paper from out that devil's hands and fling it in his
face? Yet, though her loving ear caught every intonation of her
husband's voice, she could not detect the slightest harshness in
his airy laugh; his tone was perfectly natural, and he seemed to
be, indeed&mdash;just as he appeared&mdash;vastly amused.</p>

<p>Then she thought that perhaps he would wish her to go now, that
he felt a desire to be alone with this man, who had outraged him in
everything that he held most holy and most dear&mdash;his honour
and his wife...that perhaps, knowing that his own temper was no
longer under control, he did not wish her to witness the
rough-and-ready chastisement which he was intending to mete out to
this dastardly intriguer.</p>

<p>Yes! that was it, no doubt! Herein she could not be mistaken;
she knew his fastidious notions of what was due and proper in the
presence of a woman, and that even at a moment like this he would
wish the manners of London drawing-rooms to govern his every
action.</p>

<p>Therefore she rose to go, and as she did so, once more tried to
read the expression in his face...to guess what was passing in his
mind.</p>

<p>"Nay, madam," he said, whilst he bowed gracefully before her, "I
fear me this lengthy conversation hath somewhat fatigued you...This
merry jest 'twixt my engaging friend and myself should not have
been prolonged so far into the night!...Monsieur, I pray you, will
you not give orders that her ladyship be escorted back to her
room?"</p>

<p>He was still standing outside the circle of light, and
Marguerite instinctively went up to him. For this one second she
was oblivious of Chauvelin's presence, she forgot her well-schooled
pride, her firm determination to be silent and to be brave: she
could not longer restrain the wild beatings of her heart, the agony
of her soul, and with sudden impulse she murmured, in a voice
broken with intense love and subdued, passionate appeal:</p>

<p>"Percy!"</p>

<p>He drew back a step further into the gloom: this made her
realise the mistake she had made in allowing her husband's most
bitter enemy to get this brief glimpse into her soul. Chauvelin's
thin lips curled with satisfaction, the brief glimpse had been
sufficient for him, the rapidly whispered name, the broken accent
had told him what he had not known hitherto, namely, that between
this man and woman there was a bond far more powerful than that
which usually existed between husband and wife, and merely made up
of chivalry on the one side and trustful reliance on the other.</p>

<p>Marguerite, having realised her mistake, ashamed of having
betrayed her feelings even for a moment, threw back her proud head
and gave her exultant foe a look of defiance and of scorn. He
responded with one of pity, not altogether unmixed with deference.
There was something almost unearthly and sublime in this beautiful
woman's agonising despair.</p>

<p>He lowered his head and made her a deep obeisance, lest she
should see the satisfaction and triumph which shone through his
pity.</p>

<p>As usual, Sir Percy remained quite imperturbable, and now it was
he who, with characteristic impudence, touched the handbell on the
table:</p>

<p>"Excuse this intrusion, Monsieur," he said lightly; "her
ladyship is over-fatigued and would be best in her room."</p>

<p>Marguerite threw him a grateful look. After all, she was only a
woman and was afraid of breaking down. In her mind there was no
issue to the present deadlock save death. For this she was
prepared, and had but one great hope, that she could lie in her
husband's arms just once again before she died. Now, since she
could not speak to him, scarcely dared to look into the loved face,
she was quite ready to go.</p>

<p>In answer to the bell, the soldier had entered.</p>

<p>"If Lady Blakeney desires to go..." said Chauvelin.</p>

<p>She nodded, and Chauvelin gave the necessary orders: two
soldiers stood at attention ready to escort Marguerite back to her
prison cell. As she went towards the door she came to within a
couple of steps from where her husband was standing, bowing to her
as she passed.</p>

<p>She stretched out an icy cold hand towards him, and he, in the
most approved London fashion, with the courtly grace of a perfect
English gentleman, took the little hand in his and, stooping very
low, kissed the delicate finger-tips.</p>

<p>Then only did she notice that the strong, nervy hand which held
hers trembled perceptibly, and that his lips&mdash;which for an
instant rested on her fingers&mdash;were burning hot.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27" id=

The Decision</b>
</h2>

<p>Once more the two men were alone.</p>

<p>As far as Chauvelin was concerned he felt that everything was
not yet settled, and until a moment ago he had been in doubt as to
whether Sir Percy would accept the infamous conditions which had
been put before him, or allow his pride and temper to get the
better of him and throw the deadly insults back into his
adversary's teeth.</p>

<p>But now a new secret had been revealed to the astute
diplomatist. A name, softly murmured by a broke-hearted woman, had
told him a tale of love and passion which he had not even suspected
before.</p>

<p>Since he had made this discovery he knew that the ultimate issue
was no longer in doubt. Sir Percy Blakeney, the bold adventurer,
ever ready for a gamble where lives were at stake, might have
demurred before he subscribed to his own dishonour in order to save
his wife from humiliation and the shame of the terrible fate that
had been mapped out for her. But the same man passionately in love
with such a woman as Marguerite Blakeney would count the world well
lost for her sake.</p>

<p>One sudden fear alone had shot through Chauvelin's heart when he
stood face to face with the two people whom he had so deeply and
cruelly wronged, and that was that Blakeney, throwing aside all
thought of the scores of innocent lives that were at stake, might
forget everything, risk everything, dare everything in order to get
his wife away there and then.</p>

<p>For the space of a few seconds Chauvelin had felt that his own
life was in jeopardy, and that the Scarlet Pimpernel would indeed
make a desperate effort to save himself and his wife. But the fear
was short lived; Marguerite&mdash;as he had well
forseen&mdash;would never save herself at the expense of others,
and she was tied! tied! tied! That was his triumph and his joy!</p>

<p>When Marguerite finally left the room Sir Percy made no motion
to follow her, but turned once more quietly to his antagonist.</p>

<p>"As you were saying, Monsieur?..." he queried lightly.</p>

<p>"Oh! there is nothing more to say, Sir Percy," rejoined
Chauvelin; "my conditions are clear to you, are they not? Lady
Blakeney's and your own immediate release in exchange for a letter
written to me by your own hand, and signed here by you&mdash;in
this room&mdash;in my presence and that of sundry other persons
whom I need not name just now. Also certain money passing from my
hand to yours. Failing the letter, a long, hideously humiliating
sojourn in the Temple prison for your wife, a prolonged trial and
the guillotine as a happy release!...I would add the same thing for
yourself, only that I will do you the justice to admit that you
probably do not care."</p>

<p>"Nay! a grave mistake, Monsieur...I do care...vastly care, I
assure you...and would seriously object to ending my life on your
demmed guillotine...a nasty, uncomfortable thing, I should
say...and I am told that an inexperienced barber is deputed to cut
one's hair...Brrr!...Now, on the other hand, I like the idea of a
national f&ecirc;te...that pretty wench, Candeille, dressed as a
goddess...the boom of the cannon when your amnesty comes into
force...You <i>will</i> boom the cannon, will you not,
Monsieur?...Cannons are demmed noisy, but they are effective
sometimes, do you not think so, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Very effective certainly, Sir Percy," sneered Chauvelin; "and
we will certainly boom the cannon from this very fort, an it so
please you..."</p>

<p>"At what hour, Monsieur, is my letter to be ready?"</p>

<p>"Why! at any hour you please, Sir Percy."</p>

<p>"The <i>Day Dream</i> could weight anchor at eight
o'clock...would an hour before that be convenient to yourself?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Sir Percy...if you will honour me by accepting my
hospitality in these uncomfortable quarters until seven o'clock
to-morrow eve?..."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Monsieur..."</p>

<p>"Then am I to understand, Sir Percy, that..."</p>

<p>A loud and ringing laugh broke from Blakeney's lips.</p>

<p>"That I accept your bargain, man!...Zounds! I tell you I
accept...I'll write the letter, I'll sign it...an you have our free
passes ready for us in exchange...At seven o'clock to-morrow eve,
did you say?...Man! do not look so astonished...The letter, the
signature, the money...all your witnesses...have everything
ready...I accept, I say...And now, in the name of all the evil
spirits in hell let me have some supper and a bed, for I vow that I
am demmed fatigued."</p>

<p>And without more ado Sir Percy once more rang the handbell,
laughing boisterously the while; then suddenly, with quick
transition of mood, his laugh was lost in a gigantic yawn, and
throwing his long, body on to a chair, he stretched out his legs,
buried his hands in his pockets, and the next moment was peacefully
asleep.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter28" id=

The Midnight Watch</b>
</h2>

<p>Boulogne had gone through many phases, in its own languid and
sleepy way, whilst the great upheaval of a gigantic revolution
shook other cities of France to their very foundations.</p>

<p>At first the little town had held somnolently aloof, and whilst
Lyons and Tours conspired and rebelled, whilst Marseilles and
Toulon opened their ports to the English, and Dunkirk was ready to
surrender to the allied forces, she had gazed through half-closed
eyes at all the turmoil, and then quietly turned over and gone to
sleep again.</p>

<p>Boulogne fished and mended nets, built boats, and manufactured
boots with placid content, whilst France murdered her king and
butchered her citizens.</p>

<p>The initial noise of the great revolution was only wafted on the
southerly breezes from Paris to the little sea-port towns of
northern France, and lost much of its volume and power in this
aerial transit: the fisher-folk were too poor to worry about the
dethronement of kings: the struggle for daily existence, the perils
and hardships of deep-sea fishing engrossed all the faculties they
possessed.</p>

<p>As for the burghers and merchants of the town, they were at
first content with reading an occasional article in the <i>Gazette
de Paris</i> or the <i>Gazette des Tribunaux</i>, brought hither by
one or other of the many travellers who crossed the city on their
way to the harbour. They were interested in these articles, at
times even comfortably horrified at the doings in Paris, the
executions and the tumbrils, but on the whole they liked the idea
that the country was in future to be governed by duly chosen
representatives of the people, rather than by a prey to the
despotism of kings, and they were really quite pleased to see the
tricolour flag hoisted on the old Beffroi, there where the
snow-white standard of the Bourbons had erstwhile flaunted its
golden fleur de lys in the glare of the midday sun.</p>

<p>The worthy burgesses of Boulogne were ready to shout: "Vive la
R&eacute;publique!" with the same cheerful and raucous Normandy
accent as they had lately shouted "Dieu prot&egrave;ge le Roy!"</p>

<p>The first awakening from this happy torpor came when that tent
was put up on the landing stage in the harbour. Officials, dressed
in shabby uniforms and wearing tricolour cockades and scarves, were
now quartered in the Town Hall, and repaired daily to that
roughly-erected tent, accompanied by so many soldiers from the
garrison.</p>

<p>There installed, they busied themselves with examining carefully
the passports of all those who had dwelt in the city&mdash;father
and son and grandfather, and many generations before that, and had
come and gone in and out of their own boats as they pleased, were
now stopped as they beached their craft and made to give an account
of themselves to these officials from Paris.</p>

<p>It was, of a truth, more than ridiculous, that these strangers
should ask of Jean-Marie who he was, or of Pierre what was his
business, or of D&eacute;sir&eacute; Fran&ccedil;ois whither he was
going, when Jean-Marie and Pierre and D&eacute;sir&eacute;
Fran&ccedil;ois had plied their nets in the roads outside Boulogne
harbour for more years than they would care to count.</p>

<p>It also caused no small measure of annoyance that fishermen were
ordered to wear tricolour cockades on their caps. They had no
special ill-feeling against tricolour cockades, but they did not
care about them. Jean-Marie flatly refused to have one pinned on,
and being admonished somewhat severely by one of the Paris
officials, he became obstinate about the whole thing, and threw the
cockade violently on the ground and spat upon it, not from any
sentiment of anti-Republicanism, but just from a feeling of Norman
doggedness.</p>

<p>He was arrested, shut up in Fort Gayole, tried as a traitor, and
publicly guillotined.</p>

<p>The consternation in Boulogne was appalling.</p>

<p>The one little spark had found its way to a barrel of blasting
powder, and caused a terrible explosion. Within twenty-four hours
of Jean-Marie's execution the whole town was in the throes of the
Revolution. What the death of King Louis, the arrest of Marie
Antoinette, the massacres of September had failed to do, that the
arrest and execution of an elderly fisherman accomplished in a
trice.</p>

<p>People began to take sides in politics. Some families realised
that they came from ancient lineage, and that their ancestors had
helped to build up the throne of the Bourbons. Others looked up
ancient archives, and remembered past oppressions at the hands of
the aristocrats.</p>

<p>Thus some burghers of Boulogne became ardent reactionaries,
whilst others secretly nursed enthusiastic royalist convictions:
some were ready to throw in their lot with the anarchists, to deny
the religion of their fathers, to scorn the priests and close the
places of worship, others adhered strictly still to the usages and
practices of the Church.</p>

<p>Arrests became frequent: the guillotine, erected in the Place de
la S&eacute;n&eacute;chauss&eacute;e, had plenty of work to do.
Soon the cathedral was closed, the priests thrown into prison,
whilst scores of families hoped to escape a similar fate by summary
flight.</p>

<p>Vague rumours of a band of English adventurers soon reached the
little sea-port town. The Scarlet Pimpernel&mdash;English spy or
hero, as he was alternately called&mdash;had helped many a family
with pronounced royalist tendencies to escape the fury of the
blood-thirsty Terrorists.</p>

<p>Thus gradually the anti-revolutionaries had been weeded out of
the city: some by death and imprisonment, others by flight.
Boulogne became the hotbed of anarchism: the idlers and loafers
inseparable from any town where there is a garrison and a harbour,
practically ruled the city now. Denunciations were the order of the
day. Every one who owned any money, or lived with any comfort, was
accused of being a traitor and suspected of conspiracy. The
fisher-folk wandered about the city, surly and discontented: their
trade was at a standstill, but there was a trifle to be earned by
giving information: information which meant the arrest, ofttimes
the death, of men, women, and even children who had tried to seek
safety in flight, and to denounce whom&mdash;as they were trying to
hire a boat anywhere along the coast&mdash;meant a good square meal
for a starving family.</p>

<p>Then came the awful cataclysm.</p>

<p>A woman&mdash;a stranger&mdash;had been arrested and imprisoned
in the Fort Gayole, and the town-crier publicly proclaimed that if
she escaped from jail, one member of every family in the
town&mdash;rich or poor, republican or royalist, Catholic or
freethinker&mdash;would be summarily guillotined.</p>

<p>That member, the bread-winner!</p>

<p>"Why, then, with the Duvals it would be young
Fran&ccedil;ois-Auguste. He keeps his old mother with his
boot-making..."</p>

<p>"And it would be Marie Lebon; she has her blind father dependent
on her net-mending."</p>

<p>"And old Mother Laferri&egrave;re, whose grandchildren were left
penniless...she keeps them from starvation by her wash-tub."</p>

<p>"But Fran&ccedil;ois-Auguste is a real Republican; he belongs to
the Jacobin Club."</p>

<p>"And look at Pierre, who never meets a calotin but he must needs
spit on him."</p>

<p>"Is there no safety anywhere?...are we to be butchered like so
much cattle?..."</p>

<p>Somebody makes the suggestion:</p>

<p>"It is a threat...they would not dare!..."</p>

<p>"Would not dare?"</p>

<p>'Tis old Andr&eacute; Lemoine who has spoken, and he spits
vigorously on the ground. Andr&eacute; Lemoine has been a soldier,
he was in the Vend&eacute;e. He was wounded at Tours...and he
knows!</p>

<p>"Would not dare?"...he says in a whisper. "I tell you, friends,
that there's nothing the present Government would not dare. There
was the Plaine Saint Mauve...Did you ever hear about that?...little
children fusilladed by the score...little ones, I say, and women
with babies at their breasts...weren't they innocent?...Five
hundred innocent people butchered in La Vend&eacute;e...until the
headsman sank&mdash;worn out...I could tell worse than that...for I
know...There's nothing they would not dare!..."</p>

<p>Consternation was so great that the matter could not even be
discussed.</p>

<p>"We'll go to Gayole and see this woman, at any rate."</p>

<p>Angry, sullen crowds assembled in the streets. The proclamation
had been read just as the men were leaving the public-houses,
preparing to go home for the night.</p>

<p>They brought the news to the women, who, at home, were setting
the soup and bread on the table for their husband's supper. There
was no thought of going to bed or of sleeping that night. The
bread-winner in every family, and all those dependent on him for
daily sustenance were trembling for their lives.</p>

<p>Resistance to the barbarous order would have been worse than
useless, nor did the thought of it enter the heads of these humble
and ignorant fisher-folk, wearied out with the miserable struggle
for existence. There was not sufficient spirit left in this
half-starved population of a small provincial city to suggest open
rebellion. A regiment of soldiers come up from the south was
quartered in the Ch&acirc;teau, and the natives of Boulogne could
not have mustered more than a score of disused blunderbuss between
them.</p>

<p>Then they remembered tales which Andr&eacute; Lemoine had told,
the fate of Lyons, razed to the ground, or Toulon burnt to ashes,
and they did not dare rebel.</p>

<p>But brothers, fathers, sons, trooped out towards Gayole, in
order to have a good look at the frowning pile, which held the
hostage for their safety. It looked dark and gloomy enough, save
for one window which gave on the southern ramparts. This window was
wide open, and a feeble light flickered from the room beyond, as
the men stood about, gazing at the walls in sulky silence, they
suddenly caught the sound of a loud laugh proceeding from within,
and of a pleasant voice speaking quite gaily in a language which
they did not understand, but which sounded like English.</p>

<p>Against the heavy oaken gateway, leading to the courtyard of the
prison, the proclamation, written on stout parchment, had been
pinned up. Beside it hung a tiny lantern, the dim light of which
flickered in the evening breeze, and brought at times into sudden
relief the bold writing and heavy signature, which stood out, stern
and grim, against the yellowish background of the paper, like black
signs of approaching death.</p>

<p>Facing the gateway and the proclamation, the crowd of men took
its stand. The moon, from behind them, cast fitful, silvery glances
at the weary heads bent in anxiety and watchful expectancy: on old
heads and young heads, dark, curly heads, and heads grizzled with
age, on backs bent with toil, and hands rough and gnarled like
seasoned timber.</p>

<p>All night the men stood and watched.</p>

<p>Sentinels from the town guard were stationed at the gates, but
these might prove inattentive or insufficient; they had not the
same price at stake, so the entire able-bodied population of
Boulogne watched the gloomy prison that night, lest anyone escaped
by wall or window.</p>

<p>They were guarding the precious hostage, whose safety was the
stipulation for their own.</p>

<p>There was dead silence among them, and dead silence all around,
save for that monotonous tok-tok-tok of the parchment flapping in
the breeze. The moon, who all along had been capricious and chary
on her light, made a final retreat behind a gathering bank of
clouds, and the crowd, the soldiers, and the great grim wall were
all equally wrapped in gloom.</p>

<p>Only the little lantern on the gateway now made a ruddy patch of
light, and tinged that fluttering parchment with the colour of
blood. Every now and then an isolated figure would detach itself
from out the watching throng, and go up to the heavy, oaken door,
in order to gaze at the proclamation. Then the light of the lantern
illumined a dark head or a grey one, for a moment or two: black or
white locks were stirred gently in the wind, and a sigh of
puzzlement and disappointment would be distinctly heard.</p>

<p>At times a group of three or four would stand there for awhile,
not speaking, only sighing and casting eager, questioning glances
at one another, whilst trying vainly to find some hopeful word,
some turn of phrase or meaning that would be less direful, in that
grim and ferocious proclamation. Then a rough word from the
sentinel, a push from the butt-end of a bayonet would disperse the
little group and send the men, sullen and silent, back into the
crowd.</p>

<p>Thus they watched for hours whilst the bell of the Beffroi
tolled all the hours of that tedious night. A thin rain began to
fall in the small hours of the morning, a wetting soaking drizzle
which chilled the weary watchers to the bone.</p>

<p>But they did not care.</p>

<p>"We must not sleep, for the woman might escape."</p>

<p>Some of them squatted down in the muddy road, the luckier ones
managed to lean their backs against the slimy walls.</p>

<p>Twice before the hour of midnight they heard that same quaint
merry laugh proceeding from the lighted room, through the open
window. Once it sounded very loud and very prolonged, as if in
response to a delightful joke.</p>

<p>Anon the heavy gateway of the Gayole was opened from within, and
half a dozen soldiers came walking out of the courtyard. They were
dressed in the uniform of the town guard, but had evidently been
picked out of the rank and file, for all six were exceptionally
tall and stalwart, and towered above the sentinel, who saluted and
presented arms as they marched out of the gate.</p>

<p>In the midst of them walked a slight, dark figure, clad entirely
in black, save for the tricolour scarf round his waist.</p>

<p>The crowd of watchers gazed on the little party with suddenly
awakened interest.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" whispered some of the men.</p>

<p>"The citizen governor," suggested one.</p>

<p>"The new public executioner," ventured another.</p>

<p>"No! no!" quoth Pierre Maxime, the doyen of Boulogne fishermen,
and a great authority on every matter, public or private, within
the town, "no, no, he is the man who has come down from Paris, the
friend of Robespierre. He makes the law now, the citizen governor
even must obey him. 'Tis he who made the law that if the woman up
yonder should escape..."</p>

<p>"Hush!...sh!...sh!..." came in frightened accents from the
crowd.</p>

<p>"Hush, Pierre Maxime!...the citizen might hear thee," whispered
the man who stood closest to the old fisherman, "the citizen might
hear thee, and think that we rebelled..."</p>

<p>"What are these people doing here?" queried Chauvelin, as he
passed out into the street.</p>

<p>"They are watching the prison, citizen," replied the sentinel,
whom he had thus addressed, "lest the female prisoner should
attempt to escape."</p>

<p>With a satisfied smile, Chauvelin turned towards the Town Hall,
closely surrounded by his escort. The crowd watched him and the
soldiers as they quickly disappeared in the gloom, then they
resumed the stolid, wearisome vigil of the night.</p>

<p>The old Beffroi now tolled the midnight hour, the one solitary
light in the old fort was extinguished, and after that the frowning
pile remained dark and still.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter29" id=

The National F&ecirc;te</b>
</h2>

<p>"Citizens of Boulogne, awake!"</p>

<p>They had not slept, only some of them had fallen into drowsy
somnolence, heavy and nerve-racking, worse, indeed, than any
wakefulness.</p>

<p>Within the houses the women, too, had kept the tedious vigil,
listening for every sound, dreading every bit of news which the
wind might waft in through the small, open windows.</p>

<p>If one prisoner escaped, every family in Boulogne would be
deprived of the bread-winner. Therefore the women wept, and tried
to remember those Paters and Aves which the tyranny of liberty,
fraternity, and equality had ordered them to forget.</p>

<p>Broken rosaries were fetched out from neglected corners, and
knees stiff with endless, thankless toil were bent once more in
prayer.</p>

<p>"Oh, God! Good God! Do not allow that woman to flee!"</p>

<p>"Holy Virgin! Mother of God! make that she should not
escape!"</p>

<p>Some of the women went out in the early dawn to take hot soup or
coffee to their men, who were watching outside the prison.</p>

<p>"Has anything been seen?"</p>

<p>"Have ye seen the woman?"</p>

<p>"Which room is she in?"</p>

<p>"Why won't they let us see her?"</p>

<p>"Are you sure she hath not already escaped?"</p>

<p>Questions and surmises went round in muffled whispers as the
steaming cans were passed round. No one had a definite answer to
give, although D&eacute;sir&eacute; Melun declared that he had,
once during the night, caught sight of a woman's face at one of the
windows above: but as he could not describe the woman's face, nor
locate with any degree of precision the particular window at which
she was supposed to have appeared, it was unanimously decided that
D&eacute;sir&eacute; must have been dreaming.</p>

<p>"Citizens of Boulogne, awake!"</p>

<p>The cry came first from the Town Hall, and therefore from behind
the crowd of men and women, whose faces had been so resolutely set
for all these past hours towards the Gayole Prison.</p>

<p>They were all awake! but too tired and cramped to move as yet,
and to turn in the direction whence arose that cry.</p>

<p>"Citizens of Boulogne, awake!"</p>

<p>It was just the voice of Auguste Moleaux, the town crier of
Boulogne, who, bell in hand, was trudging his way along the Rue
Daumont, closely followed by two fellows of the municipal
guard.</p>

<p>Auguste was in the very midst of the sullen crowd before the men
ever troubled about his presence here, but now, with many a
vigorous "Allons donc!" and "Voyez-moi &ccedil;a, fais donc place,
voyons!" he elbowed his way through the throng.</p>

<p>He was neither tired nor cramped, he served the Republic in
comfort and ease, and had slept soundly on his paillasse in the
little garret allotted to him in the Town Hall.</p>

<p>The crowd parted in silence to allow him to pass. Auguste was
lean and powerful, the scanty and meagre food doled out to him by a
paternal Government had increased his muscular strength whilst
reducing his fat. He had very hard elbows, and soon he managed, by
dint of pushing and cursing, to reach the gateway of Gayole.</p>

<p>"Voyons! enlevez-moi &ccedil;a," he commanded in stentorian
tones, pointing to the proclamation.</p>

<p>The fellows of the municipal guard fell to and tore the
parchment away from the door, whilst the crowd looked on with
stupid amazement.</p>

<p>What did it all mean?</p>

<p>Then Auguste Moleaux turned and faced the men.</p>

<p>"Mes enfants," he said, "my little cabbages! wake up! The
Government of the Republic has decreed that to-day is to be a day
of gaiety and public rejoicings!"</p>

<p>"Gaiety?...Public rejoicings, forsooth, when the bread-winner of
every family..."</p>

<p>"Hush! Hush! Be silent all of you," quoth Auguste impatiently.
"You do not understand!...All that is at an end...There is no fear
that the woman shall escape...You are all to dance and
rejoice...The Scarlet Pimpernel has been captured in
Boulogne&mdash;last night..."</p>

<p>"Qui &ccedil;a the Scarlet Pimpernel?"</p>

<p>"Mais! 'tis that mysterious English adventurer who rescued
people from the guillotine!"</p>

<p>"A hero? quoi?"</p>

<p>"No! no! only an English spy, a friend of aristocrats...he would
have cared nothing for the breadwinners of Boulogne..."</p>

<p>"He would not have raised a finger to save them."</p>

<p>"Who knows?" sighed a feminine voice. "Perhaps he came to
Boulogne to help them."</p>

<p>"And he has been caught, anyway," concluded Auguste Moleaux
sententiously; "And, my little cabbages, remember this, that so
great is the pleasure of the all-powerful Committee of Public
Safety at his capture, that because he has been caught in Boulogne,
therefore Boulogne is to be specially rewarded!"</p>

<p>"Holy Virgin, who'd have thought it?"</p>

<p>"Sh...Jeannette, dost not know that there's no Holy Virgin
now?"</p>

<p>"And dost know, Auguste, how we are to be rewarded?"</p>

<p>It is a difficult matter for the human mind to turn very quickly
from despair to hope, and the fishermen of Boulogne had not yet
grasped the fact that they were to make merry, and that thoughts of
anxiety must be abandoned for those of gaiety.</p>

<p>Auguste Moleux took out a parchment from the capacious pocket of
his coat; he put on his most solemn air of officialdom, and,
pointing with extended forefinger to the parchment, he said:</p>

<p>"A general amnesty to all natives of Boulogne who are under
arrest at the present moment: a free pardon to all natives of
Boulogne who are under sentence of death: permission to all natives
of Boulogne to quit the town with their families, to embark on any
vessel they please, in or out of the harbour, and to go
whithersoever they choose, without passports, formalities, or
questions of any kind."</p>

<p>Dead silence followed this announcement. Hope was just beginning
to crowd anxiety and sullenness out of the way.</p>

<p>"Then poor Andr&eacute; Legrand will be pardoned," whispered a
voice suddenly; "he was to have been guillotined to-day."</p>

<p>"And Denise Latour! She was innocent enough, the gentle
pigeon."</p>

<p>"And they'll let poor Abb&eacute; Foucquet out of prison,
too."</p>

<p>"And Fra&ccedil;ois!"</p>

<p>"And poor F&eacute;licit&eacute;, who is blind!"</p>

<p>"M. l'Abb&eacute; would be wise to leave Boulogne, with the
children."</p>

<p>"He will, too: thou canst be sure of that!"</p>

<p>"It is not good to be a priest just now!"</p>

<p>"Bah! calotins are best dead than alive."</p>

<p>But some in the crowd were silent; others whispered eagerly:</p>

<p>"Thinkest thou it would be safer for us to get out of the
country whilst we can?" said one of the men in a muffled tone, and
clutching nervously at a woman's wrist.</p>

<p>"Aye! aye! it might leak out about that boat we procured
for..."</p>

<p>"Sh...I was thinking of that..."</p>

<p>"We can go to my Aunt Lebrun in Belgium..."</p>

<p>Others talked in whispers of England, or the New Land across the
seas: they were those who had something to hide&mdash;money
received from refugee aristocrats, boats sold to would-be
&eacute;migr&eacute;s, information withheld, denunciations shirked:
the amnesty would not last long, &#8217;twas best to be safely out
of the way.</p>

<p>"In the meanwhile, my cabbages," quoth Auguste sententiously,
"are you not grateful to Citizen Robespierre, who has sent this
order specially down from Paris?"</p>

<p>"Aye! aye!" assented the crowd cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Citizen Robespierre!"</p>

<p>"Vive la R&eacute;publique!"</p>

<p>"And you will enjoy yourselves to-day?"</p>

<p>"That we will!"</p>

<p>"Processions?"</p>

<p>"Aye! with music and dancing."</p>

<p>Out there, far away, beyond the harbour, the grey light of dawn
was yielding to the crimson glow of morning. The rain had ceased,
and heavy, slaty clouds parted here and there, displaying glints of
delicate turquoise sky and tiny ethereal vapours, in the dim and
remote distance of infinity, flecked with touches of rose and
gold.</p>

<p>The towers and pinnacles of old Boulogne detached themselves,
one by one, from the misty gloom of night. The old bell of the
Beffroi tolled the hour of six. Soon the massive cupola of Notre
Dame was clothed in purple hues, and the gilt cross on St. Joseph
threw back across the square a blinding ray of gold.</p>

<p>The town sparrows began to twitter, and from far out at sea, in
the direction of Dunkirk, there came the muffled boom of
cannon.</p>

<p>"And remember, my pigeons," admonished Auguste Moleaux solemnly,
"that in this order which Robespierre has sent from Paris it also
says that from to-day onwards le bon Dieu has ceased to be!"</p>

<p>Many faces were turned towards the east just then, for the
rising sun, tearing with one gigantic sweep the bank of clouds
asunder, now displayed his magnificence in a gorgeous immensity of
flaming crimson. The sea, in response, turned to liquid fire
beneath the glow, whilst the whole sky was irradiated with the
first blush of morning.</p>

<p>Le bon Dieu has ceased to be!!!</p>

<p>"There is only one religion in France now," explained Auguste
Moleaux, "the religion of Reason! We are all citizens!! We are all
free and all able to think for ourselves. Citizen Robespierre has
decreed that there is no good God. Le bon Dieu was a tyrant and an
aristocrat, and, like all tyrants and aristocrats, He has been
deposed. There is no good God, there is no Holy Virgin, and no
Saints&mdash;only Reason, who is a goddess, and whom we all
honour."</p>

<p>And the townsfolk of Boulogne, with eyes still fixed on the
gorgeous east, shouted with sullen obedience:</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the Goddess of Reason!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Robespierre!"</p>

<p>Only the women, trying to escape the town crier's prying eyes,
or the soldier's stern gaze, hastily crossed themselves behind
their husband's backs, terrified lest le bon Dieu had, after all,
not altogether ceased to exist at the bidding of Citizen
Robespierre.</p>

<p>Thus the worthy natives of Boulogne, forgetting their anxieties
and fears, were ready enough to enjoy the national f&ecirc;te
ordained for them by the Committee of Public Safety, in honour of
the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel. They were even willing to
accept this new religion which Robespierre had invented: a religion
which was only a mockery, with an actress to represent its supreme
deity.</p>

<p>Mais que voulez-vous? Boulogne had long ago ceased to have faith
in God: the terrors of the Revolution, which culminated in that
agonising watch of last night, had smothered all thoughts of
worship and of prayer.</p>

<p>The Scarlet Pimpernel must indeed be a dangerous spy, that his
arrest should cause so much joy in Paris!</p>

<p>Even Boulogne had learned by experience that the Committee of
Public Safety did not readily give up a prey, once its vulture-like
claws had closed upon it. The proportion of condemnations as
against acquittals was as a hundred to one.</p>

<p>But because this one man was taken, scores to-day were to be set
free!</p>

<p>In the evening, at a given hour&mdash;seven o'clock had Auguste
Moleaux, the town crier, understood&mdash;the boom of the cannon
would be heard, the gates of the town would be opened, the harbour
would become a free port.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Boulogne were ready to shout:</p>

<p>"Vive the Scarlet Pimpernel!"</p>

<p>Whatever he was&mdash;hero or spy&mdash;he was undoubtedly the
primary cause of all their joy.</p>

<p>By the time Auguste Moleux had cried out the news throughout the
town, and pinned the new proclamation of mercy up on every public
building, all traces of fatigue and anxiety had vanished. In spite
of the fact that wearisome vigils had been kept in every home that
night, and that hundreds of men and women had stood about for hours
in the vicinity of the Gayole Fort, no sooner was the joyful news
known than all lassitude was forgotten, and everyone set to with
right merry will to make a great f&ecirc;te-day a complete
success.</p>

<p>There is in every native of Normandy, be he peasant or
gentleman, an infinite capacity for enjoyment, and at the same time
a marvellous faculty for co-ordinating and systematising his
pleasures.</p>

<p>In a trice the surly crowds had vanished. Instead of these,
there were groups of gaily visaged men pleasantly chattering
outside every eating and drinking place in the town. The national
holiday had come upon these people quite unawares, so the early
part of it had to be spent in thinking out a satisfactory programme
for it. Sipping their beer or coffee, or munching their cherries
&agrave; l'eau-de-vie, the townsfolk of Boulogne, so lately
threatened with death, were quietly organising processions.</p>

<p>There was to be a grand muster on the Place de la
S&eacute;n&eacute;chauss&eacute;e, then a torchlight and
lanthornlight march right round the ramparts, culminating in a
gigantic assembly outside the Town Hall, where the Citizen
Chauvelin, representing the Committee of Public Safety, would
receive an address of welcome from the entire population of
Boulogne.</p>

<p>The procession was to be in costume! There were to be Pierrots
and Pierrettes, Harlequins and English clowns, aristocrats and
goddesses! All day the women and girls were busy contriving
travesties of all sorts, and the little tumble-down shops in the
Rue du Ch&acirc;teau and the Rue Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric
Sauvage&mdash;kept chiefly by Jews and English traders&mdash;were
ransacked for old bits of finery, and for remnants of costumes,
worn in the days when Boulogne was still a gay city and carnivals
were held every year.</p>

<p>And then, of course, there would be the Goddess of Reason, in
her triumphal car!&mdash;the apotheosis of the new religion, which
was to make everybody happy, rich and free.</p>

<p>Forgotten were the anxieties of the night, the fears of death,
the great and glorious Revolution, which for this one day would
cease her perpetual demand for the toll of blood.</p>

<p>Nothing was remembered save the pleasures and joy of the moment,
and at times the name of that Englishman&mdash;spy, hero, or
adventurer&mdash;the cause of all this bounty: the Scarlet
Pimpernel.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter30" id=

The Procession</b>
</h2>

<p>The grandfathers of the present generation of Boulonnese
remembered the great day of the National F&ecirc;te, when all
Boulogne, for twenty-four hours, went crazy with joy. So many
families had fathers, brothers, sons, languishing in prison under
some charge of treason, real or imaginary, so many had dear ones
for whom this memorable day of September, 1793, was one of
never-to-be-forgotten relief and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>The weather all day had been exceptionally fine. After that
glorious sunrise the sky had remained all day clad in its gorgeous
mantle of blue, and the sun had continued to smile benignly on the
many varied doings of this gay little seaport town. When it began
to sink slowly towards the West a few little fluffy clouds appeared
on the horizon, and from a distance, although the sky remained
clear and blue, the sea looked quite dark and slaty against the
brilliancy of the firmament.</p>

<p>Gradually, as the splendour of the sunset gave place to the
delicate purple and grey tints of evening, the little fluffy clouds
merged themselves into denser masses, and these, too, soon became
absorbed in the great, billowy banks which the south-westerly wind
was blowing seawards.</p>

<p>By the time that the last grey streak of dusk vanished in the
West, the whole sky looked heavy with clouds, and the evening set
in, threatening and dark.</p>

<p>But this by no means mitigated the anticipation of pleasure to
come. On the contrary, the fast-gathering gloom was hailed with
delight, since it would surely help to show off the coloured lights
of the lanthorns and give additional value to the glow of the
torches.</p>

<p>Of a truth &#8217;twas a motley throng which began to assemble
on the Place de la S&eacute;n&eacute;chauss&eacute;e, just as the
old bell of the Beffroi tolled the hour of six. Men, women, and
children in ragged finery, Pierrots with neck frills and floured
faces, hideous masks of impossible beasts roughly besmeared with
crude colours. There were gaily-coloured dominoes, blue, green,
pink, and purple; harlequins combining all the colours of the
rainbow in one tight-fitting garment, and Columbines with short,
tarlatan skirts, beneath which peeped bare feet and ankles. There
were judges' perruques, and soldiers' helmets of past generations,
tall Normandy caps adorned with hundreds of streaming ribbons and
powdered headgear which recalled the glories of Versailles.</p>

<p>Everything was torn and dirty, the dominoes were in rags, the
Pierrot frills, mostly made up of paper, already hung in strips
over the wearers' shoulders. But what mattered that?</p>

<p>The crowd pushed and jolted, shouted and laughed, the girls
screamed as the men snatched a kiss here and there from willing or
unwilling lips, or stole an arm round a gaily-accoutred waist. The
spirit of old King Carnival was in the evening air&mdash;a spirit
just awakened from a long Rip Van Winkle-like sleep.</p>

<p>In the centre of the Place stood the guillotine, grim and gaunt,
with long, thin arms stretched out towards the sky, the last
glimmer of waning light striking the triangular knife, there, where
it was not rusty with stains of blood.</p>

<p>For weeks now Madame Guillotine had been much occupied plying
her gruesome trade; she now stood there in the gloom, passive and
immovable, seeming to wait placidly for the end of this holiday,
ready to begin her work again on the morrow. She towered above
these merrymakers, hoisted up on the platform whereon many an
innocent foot had trodden, the tattered basket beside her, into
which many an innocent head had rolled.</p>

<p>What cared they to-night for Madame Guillotine and the horrors
of which she told? A crowd of Pierrots with floured faces and
tattered neck-frills had just swarmed up the wooden steps, shouting
and laughing, chasing each other round and round on the platform,
until one of them lost his footing and fell into the basket,
covering himself with bran and staining his clothes with blood.</p>

<p>"Ah, vogue la gal&egrave;re! We must be merry tonight!"</p>

<p>And all these people, who for weeks past had been staring death
and the guillotine in the face, had denounced each other with
savage callousness in order to save themselves, or hidden for days
in dark cellars to escape apprehension, now laughed and danced and
shrieked with gladness in a sudden, hysterical outburst of joy.</p>

<p>Close beside the guillotine stood the triumphal car of the
Goddess of Reason, the special feature of this great national
f&ecirc;te. It was only a rough market cart, painted by an
unpractised hand with bright, crimson paint, and adorned with huge
clusters of autumn-tinted leaves, and the scarlet berries of
mountain ash and rowan, culled from the town gardens, or the
country side outside the city walls.</p>

<p>In the cart the goddess reclined on a crimson-draped seat, she
herself swathed in white, and wearing a gorgeous necklace around
her neck. D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Candeille, a little pale, a little
apprehensive of all this noise, had obeyed the final dictates of
her taskmaster. She had been the means of bringing the Scarlet
Pimpernel to France and vengeance, she was to be honoured therefore
above every other woman in France.</p>

<p>She sat in the car, vaguely thinking over the events of the past
few days, whilst watching the throng of rowdy merrymakers seething
around her. She thought of the noble-hearted, proud woman whom she
had helped to bring from her beautiful English home to sorrow and
humiliation in a dank, French prison; she thought of the gallant
English gentleman, with his pleasant voice and courtly, debonnair
manners.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had roughly told her, only this morning, that both
were now under arrest as English spies, and that their fate no
longer concerned her. Later on the governor of the city had come to
tell her that Citizen Chauvelin desired her to take part in the
procession and the national f&ecirc;te, as the Goddess of Reason,
and that the people of Boulogne were ready to welcome her as such.
This had pleased Candeille's vanity, and all day, whilst arranging
the finery which she meant to wear for the occasion, she had ceased
to think of England and of Lady Blakeney.</p>

<p>But now, when she arrived on the Place de la
S&eacute;n&eacute;chauss&eacute;e, and mounting her car, found
herself on a level with the platform of the guillotine, her memory
flew back to England, to the lavish hospitality of Blakeney Manor,
Marguerite's gentle voice, the pleasing grace of Sir Percy's
manners, and she shuddered a little when that cruel glint of
evening light caused the knife of the guillotine to glisten from
out the gloom.</p>

<p>But anon her reflections were suddenly interrupted by loud and
prolonged shouts of joy. A whole throng of Pierrots had swarmed
into the Place from every side, carrying lighted torches and tall
staves, on which were hung lanthorns with many-coloured lights.</p>

<p>The procession was ready to start. A stentorian voice shouted
out in resonant accents:</p>

<p>"En avant, la grosse caisse!"</p>

<p>A man now, portly and gorgeous in scarlet and blue, detached
himself from out the crowd. His head was hidden beneath the
monstrous mask of a cardboard lion, roughly painted in brown and
yellow, with crimson for the widely-open jaws and the corners of
the eyes to make them seem ferocious and bloodshot. His coat was of
bright crimson cloth, with cuts and slashings in it, through which
bunches of bright blue paper were made to protrude, in imitation of
the costume of mediaeval times.</p>

<p>He had blue stockings on and bright scarlet slippers, and behind
him floated a large strip of scarlet flannel, on which moons and
suns and stars of gold had been showered in plenty.</p>

<p>Upon his portly figure in front he was supporting the big drum,
which was securely strapped round his shoulders and tarred
cordages, the spoil of some fishing vessel.</p>

<p>There was a merciful slit in the jaw of the cardboard lion,
through which the portly drummer puffed and spluttered as he
shouted lustily:</p>

<p>"En avant!"</p>

<p>And wielding the heavy drumstick with a powerful arm, he brought
it crashing down against the side of the mighty instrument.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Hurrah! en avant les trompettes!"</p>

<p>A fanfare of brass instruments followed, lustily blown by twelve
young men in motley coats of green, and tall, peaked hats adorned
with feathers.</p>

<p>The drummer had begun to march, closely followed by the
trumpeters. Behind them a bevy of Columbines in many-coloured
tarlatan skirts and hair flying wildly in the breeze, giggling,
pushing, exchanging ribald jokes with the men behind, and getting
kissed or slapped for their pains.</p>

<p>Then the triumphal car of the goddess, with Demoiselle Candeille
standing straight up in it, a tall, gold wand in one hand, the
other resting in a mass of scarlet berries. All round the car,
helter-skelter, tumbling, pushing, came Pierrots and Pierrettes
carrying lanthorns, and Harlequins bearing the torches.</p>

<p>And after the car the long line of more sober folk, the older
fishermen, the women in caps and many-hued skirts, the serious
townsfolk who had scorned the travesty, yet would not be left out
of the procession. They all began to march, to the tune of those
noisy brass trumpets which were thundering forth snatches from the
newly-composed "Marseillaise".</p>

<p>Above the sky became more heavy with clouds. Anon a few drops of
rain began to fall, making the torches sizzle and splutter, and
scatter grease and tar around, and wetting the light-covered
shoulders of tarlatan-clad Columbines. But no one cared! The glow
of so much merrymaking kept the blood warm and the skin dry.</p>

<p>The flour all came off the Pierrots' faces, the blue paper
slashings of the drummer-in-chief hung in pulpy lumps against his
gorgeous scarlet cloak. The trumpeters' feathers became streaky and
bedraggled.</p>

<p>But in the name of that good God who had ceased to exist, who in
this world or out of it cared if it rained, or thundered and
stormed! This was a national holiday, for an English spy was
captured, and all natives of Boulogne were free of the guillotine
to-night.</p>

<p>The revellers were making the circuit of the town, with
lanthorns fluttering in the wind, and flickering torches held up
aloft illumining laughing faces red with the glow of a drunken joy,
young faces that only enjoyed the moment's pleasure, serious ones
that withheld a frown at thought of the morrow. The fitful light
played on the grotesque masques of beasts and reptiles, on the
diamond necklace of a very earthly goddess, on God's glorious
spoils from gardens and country-side, on smothered anxiety and
repressed cruelty.</p>

<p>The crowd had turned its back on the guillotine, and the
trumpets now changed the inspiriting tune of the "Marseillaise" to
the ribald vulgarity of the "&Ccedil;a ira!"</p>

<p>Everyone yelled and shouted. Girls with flowing hair produced
broomsticks, and, astride on these, broke from the ranks and danced
a mad and obscene saraband, a dance of witches in the weird glow of
sizzling torches, to the accompaniment of raucous laughter and of
coarse jokes.</p>

<p>Thus the procession passed on, a sight to gladden the eyes of
those who had desired to smother all thought of the Infinite, of
Eternity and of God in the minds of those to whom they had nothing
to offer in return. A threat of death yesterday, misery,
starvation, and squalor! All the hideousness of a destroying
anarchy, that had nothing to give save a national f&ecirc;te, a
tinsel goddess, some shallow laughter and momentary intoxication; a
travesty of clothes and of religion, and a dance on the ashes of
the past.</p>

<p>And there along the ramparts, where the massive walls of the
city encircled the frowning prisons of Gayole and the old
Ch&acirc;teau, dark groups were crouching, huddled together in
compact masses, which, in the gloom, seemed to vibrate with fear.
Like hunted quarry seeking for shelter, sombre figures flattened
themselves in the angles of the dank walls, as the noisy carousers
drew nigh. Then as the torches and lanthorns detached themselves
from out the evening shadows, hand would clutch hand and hearts
would beat with agonised suspense, whilst the dark and shapeless
forms would try to appear smaller, flatter, less noticeable than
before.</p>

<p>And when the crowd had passed noisily along, leaving behind it a
trail of torn finery, of glittering tinsel and of scarlet berries,
when the boom of the big drum and the grating noise of the brass
trumpets had somewhat died away, wan faces, pale with anxiety,
would peer from out the darkness, and nervous hands would grasp
with trembling fingers the small bundles of poor belongings tied up
hastily in view of flight.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock, so &#8217;twas said, the cannon would boom
from the old Beffroi. The guard would throw open the prison gates,
and those who had something or somebody to hide, and those who had
a great deal to fear, would be free to go withersoever they
chose.</p>

<p>And mothers, sisters, sweethearts stood watching by the gates,
for loved ones to-night would be set free, all along of the capture
of that English spy, the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter31" id=

Final Dispositions</b>
</h2>

<p>To Chauvelin the day had been one of restless inquietude and
nervous apprehension.</p>

<p>Collot d'Herbois harassed him with questions and complaints
intermixed with threats but thinly veiled. At his suggestion,
Gayole had been transformed into a fully-manned, well-garrisoned
fortress. Troops were to be seen everywhere, on the stairs and in
the passages, the guard-rooms and offices: picked men from the
municipal guard, and the company which had been sent down from
Paris some time ago.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had not resisted these orders given by his colleague.
He knew quite well that Marguerite would make no attempt at escape,
but he had long ago given up all hope of persuading a man of the
type of Collot d'Herbois that a woman of her temperament would
never think of saving her own life at the expense of others, and
that Sir Percy Blakeney, in spite of his adoration for his wife,
would sooner see her die before him, than allow the lives of
innocent men and women to be the price of hers.</p>

<p>Collot was one of those brutish sots&mdash;not by any means
infrequent among the Terrorists of that time&mdash;who, born in the
gutter, still loved to wallow in his native element, and who
measured all his fellow-creatures by the same standard which he had
always found good enough for himself. In this man there was neither
the enthusiastic patriotism of a Chauvelin, nor the ardent
selfishness of a Danton. He served the revolution and fostered the
anarchical spirit of the times only because these brought him a
competence and a notoriety which an orderly and fastidious
government would obviously have never offered him.</p>

<p>History shows no more despicable personality than that of Collot
d'Herbois, one of the most hideous products of that utopian
Revolution, whose grandly conceived theories of a universal
levelling of mankind only succeeded in dragging into prominence a
number of half-brutish creatures who, revelling in their own
abasement, would otherwise have remained content in inglorious
obscurity.</p>

<p>Chauvelin tolerated and half-feared Collot, knowing full well
that if now the Scarlet Pimpernel escaped from his hands, he would
expect no mercy from his colleagues.</p>

<p>The scheme by which he hoped to destroy not only the heroic
leader but the entire League, by bringing opprobrium and ridicule
upon them, was wonderfully subtle in its refined cruelty, and
Chauvelin, knowing by now something of Sir Percy Blakeney's
curiously blended character, was never for a moment in doubt but
that he would write the infamous letter, save his wife by
sacrificing his honour, and then seek oblivion and peace in
suicide.</p>

<p>With so much disgrace, so much mud cast upon their chief, the
League of the Scarlet Pimpernel would cease to be. <i>That</i> had
been Chauvelin's plan all along. For this end he had schemed and
thought and planned, from the moment that Robespierre had given him
the opportunity of redeeming his failure of last year. He had built
up the edifice of his intrigue, bit by bit, from the introduction
of his tool, Candeille, to Marguerite at the Richmond gala, to the
arrest of Lady Blakeney in Boulogne. All that remained for him to
see now would be the attitude of Sir Percy Blakeney to-night, when,
in exchange for the stipulated letter, he would see his wife set
free.</p>

<p>All day Chauvelin had wondered how it would all go off. He had
stage-managed everything, but he did not know how the chief actor
would play his part.</p>

<p>From time to time, when his feeling of restlessness became quite
unendurable, the ex-ambassador would wander round Fort Gayole, and
on some hastily conceived pretext demand to see one or the other of
his prisoners. Marguerite, however, observed complete silence in
his presence: she acknowledged his greeting with a slight
inclination of the head, and in reply to certain perfunctory
queries of his&mdash;which he put to her in order to justify his
appearance&mdash;she either nodded or gave curt monosyllabic
answers through partially-opened lips.</p>

<p>"I trust that everything is arranged for your comfort, Lady
Blakeney?"</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"You will be rejoining the <i>Day Dream</i> to-night. Can I send
a messenger over to the yacht for you?"</p>

<p>"I thank you. No."</p>

<p>"Sir Percy is well. He is fast asleep, and hath not asked for
your ladyship. Shall I let him know that you are well?"</p>

<p>A nod of acquiescence from Marguerite, and Chauvelin's string of
queries was at an end. He marvelled at her quietude, and thought
that she should have been as restless as himself.</p>

<p>Later on in the day, and egged on by Collot d'Herbois and by his
own fears, he had caused Marguerite to be removed from room No.
6.</p>

<p>This change he heralded by another brief visit to her, and his
attitude this time was one of deferential apology.</p>

<p>"A matter of expediency, Lady Blakeney," he explained, "and I
trust that the change will be for your comfort."</p>

<p>Again the same curt nod of acquiescence on her part, and a
brief:</p>

<p>"As you command, Monsieur!"</p>

<p>But when he had gone, she turned with a sudden, passionate
outburst towards the Abb&eacute; Foucquet, her faithful companion
through the past long, weary hours. She fell on her knees beside
him and sobbed in an agony of grief.</p>

<p>"Oh! if I could only know...if I could only see him!...for a
minute!...a second!...if only I could know!..."</p>

<p>She felt as if the awful uncertainty would drive her mad.</p>

<p>If she could only know! If she could only know what he meant to
do!</p>

<p>"The good God knows!" said the old man, with his usual, simple
philosophy, "and perhaps it is all for the best."</p>

<p>The room which Chauvelin had now destined for Marguerite, was
one which gave from the larger one, wherein last night he had had
his momentous interview with her and with Sir Percy.</p>

<p>It was small, square and dark, with no window in it: only a
small ventilating hole high up in the wall and heavily grated.
Chauvelin, who desired to prove to her that there was no wish on
his part to add physical discomfort to her mental tortures, had
given orders that the little place should be made as habitable as
possible. A thick, soft carpet had been laid on the ground; there
was an easy chair and a comfortable-looking couch with a couple of
pillows and a rug upon it, and oh, marvel! on the round central
table, a vase with a huge bunch of many-coloured dahlias, which
seemed to throw a note as if of gladness into this strange and
gloomy little room.</p>

<p>At the furthest corner, too, a construction of iron uprights and
crossway bars had been hastily contrived and fitted with curtains,
forming a small recess, behind which was a tidy washstand, fine
clean towels, and plenty of fresh water. Evidently the shops of
Boulogne had been commandeered in order to render Marguerite's
sojourn here outwardly agreeable.</p>

<p>But as the place was innocent of window, so was it innocent of
doors, The one that gave into the large room had been taken out of
its hinges, leaving only the frame, on each side of which stood a
man from the municipal guard with fixed bayonet.</p>

<p>Chauvelin himself had conducted Marguerite to her new prison.
She followed him&mdash;silent and apathetic&mdash;with not a trace
of that awful torrent of emotion which had overwhelmed her but
half-an-hour ago, when she had fallen on her knees beside the old
priest and sobbed her heart out in a passionate fit of weeping.
Even the sight of the soldiers left her outwardly indifferent. As
she stepped across the threshold she noticed that the door itself
had been taken away: then she gave another quick glance at the
soldiers, whose presence there would control her every
movement.</p>

<p>The though of Queen Marie Antoinette in the Conciergerie prison
with the daily, hourly humiliation and shame which this constant
watch imposed upon her womanly pride and modesty, flashed suddenly
across Marguerite's mind, and a deep blush of horror rapidly
suffused her pale cheeks, whilst an almost imperceptible shudder
shook her delicate frame.</p>

<p>Perhaps, as in a flash, she had at this moment received an
inkling of what the nature of that terrible "either-or" might be
with which Chauvelin was trying to force an English gentleman to
dishonour. Sir Percy Blakeney's wife had been threatened with Marie
Antoinette's fate.</p>

<p>"You see, Madame," said her cruel enemy's unctuous voice close
to her ear, "that we have tried our humble best to make your brief
sojourn here as agreeable as possible. May I express a hope that
you will be quite comfortable in this room, until the time when Sir
Percy will be ready to accompany you to the <i>Day-Dream</i>."</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir," she replied quietly.</p>

<p>"And if there is anything you require, I pray you to call. I
shall be in the next room all day and entirely at your
service."</p>

<p>A young orderly now entered bearing a small
collation&mdash;eggs, bread, milk and wine&mdash;which he set on
the central table. Chauvelin bowed low before Marguerite and
withdrew. Anon he ordered the two sentinels to stand the other side
of the doorway, against the wall on his own room, and well out of
sight of Marguerite, so that, as she moved about her own narrow
prison, if she ate or slept, she might have the illusion that she
was unwatched.</p>

<p>The sight of the soldiers had had the desired effect on her.
Chauvelin had seen her shudder, and knew that she understood or
that she guessed. He was now satisfied, and really had no wish to
harass her beyond endurance.</p>

<p>Moreover, there was always the proclamation, which threatened
the bread-winners of Boulogne with death, if Marguerite Blakeney
escaped, and which would be in full force until Sir Percy had
written, signed, and delivered into Chauvelin's hands, the letter
which was to be the signal for the general amnesty.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had indeed cause to be satisfied with his measures.
There was no fear that his prisoners would attempt to escape.</p>

<p>Even Collot d'Herbois had to admit that everything was well
done. He had read the draft of the proposed letter, and was
satisfied with its contents. Gradually now into his loutish brain
there had filtrated the conviction that Citizen Chauvelin was
right, that that accursed Scarlet Pimpernel and his brood of
English spies would be more effectually annihilated by all the
dishonour and ridicule which such a letter written by the
mysterious hero would heap upon them all, than they could ever be
through the relentless work of the guillotine. His only anxiety now
was whether the Englishman would write that letter.</p>

<p>"Bah! he'll do it," he would say whenever he thought the whole
matter over. "Sacr&eacute; tonnerre! but 'tis an easy means to save
his own skin."</p>

<p>"You would sign such a letter without hesitation, eh, Citizen
Collot?" said Chauvelin, with well-concealed sarcasm, on one
occasion, when his colleague discussed the all-absorbing topic with
him; "you would show no hesitation, if your life were at stake, and
you were given the choice between writing that letter, and...the
guillotine?"</p>

<p>"Parbleu!" responded Collot with conviction.</p>

<p>"More especially," continued Chauvelin drily, "if a million
francs were promised you as well?"</p>

<p>"Sacr&eacute; Anglais!" swore Collot angrily, "you don't propose
giving him that money, do you?"</p>

<p>"We'll place it ready to his hand, at any rate, so that it
should appear as if he had actually taken it."</p>

<p>Collot looked up at his colleague in ungrudging admiration.
Chauvelin had, indeed, left nothing undone, had thought everything
out in this strangely conceived scheme for the destruction of the
enemy of France.</p>

<p>"But in the name of all the dwellers in hell, citizen,"
admonished Collot, "guard that letter well, once it is in your
hands."</p>

<p>"I'll do better than that," said Chauvelin, "I will hand it over
to you, Citizen Collot, and you shall ride with it to Paris at
once."</p>

<p>"To-night!" assented Collot, with a shout of triumph, as he
brought his grimy fist-crashing down on the table, "I'll have a
horse ready saddled at this very gate, and an escort of mounted
men...we'll ride like hell's own furies and not pause to breathe
until that letter is in Citizen Robespierre's hands."</p>

<p>"Well thought on, citizen," said Chauvelin approvingly. "I pray
you give the necessary orders, that the horses be ready saddled,
and the men booted and spurred, and waiting at the Gayole gate at
seven o'clock this evening."</p>

<p>"I wish the letter were written and safely in our hands by
now."</p>

<p>"Nay! the Englishman will have it ready by this evening, never
fear. The tide is high at half-past seven, and he will be in haste
for his wife to be aboard his yacht, ere the turn, even if
he..."</p>

<p>He paused, savouring the thoughts which had suddenly flashed
across his mind, and a look of intense hatred and cruel
satisfaction for a moment chased away the studied impassiveness of
his face.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, citizen?" queried Collot anxiously; "even if
he...what?..."</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing, nothing! I was only trying to make vague guesses
as to what the Englishman will do <i>after</i> he has written the
letter," quoth Chauvelin reflectively.</p>

<p>"Morbleu! he'll return to his own accursed country...glad enough
to have escaped with his skin...I suppose," added Collot with
sudden anxiety, "you have no fear that he will refuse at the last
moment to write that letter?"</p>

<p>The two men were sitting in the large room, out of which opened
the one which was now occupied by Marguerite. They were talking at
the further end of it, close to the window, and though Chauvelin
had mostly spoken in a whisper, Collot had ofttimes shouted, and
the ex-ambassador was wondering how much Marguerite had heard.</p>

<p>Now at Collot's anxious query he gave a quick, furtive glance in
the direction of the further room wherein she sat, so silent and so
still, that it seemed almost as if she must be sleeping.</p>

<p>"You don't think that the Englishman will refuse to write the
letter?" insisted Collot with angry impatience.</p>

<p>"No!" replied Chauvelin quietly.</p>

<p>"But if he does?" persisted the other.</p>

<p>"If he does, I send the woman to Paris to-night and have him
hanged as a spy in this prison yard without further formality or
trial..." replied Chauvelin firmly; "so either way, you see,
citizen," he added in a whisper, "the Scarlet Pimpernel is done
for...But I think that he will write the letter."</p>

<p>"Parbleu! so do I!..." rejoined Collot, with a harsh laugh.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter32" id=

The Letter</b>
</h2>

<p>Later on, when his colleague left him in order to see to the
horses and to his escort for the night, Chauvelin called Sergeant
H&eacute;bert, his old and trusted familiar, to him and gave him
some final orders.</p>

<p>"The Angelus must be rung at the proper hour, friend
H&eacute;bert," he began with a grim smile.</p>

<p>"The Angelus, Citizen?" quoth the sergeant, with complete
stupefaction; "'tis months now since it has been rung. It was
forbidden by a decree of the Convention, and I doubt me if any of
our men would know how to set about it."</p>

<p>Chauvelin's eyes were fixed before him in apparent vacancy,
while the same grim smile still hovered round his thin lips.
Something of that irresponsible spirit of adventure which was the
mainspring of all Sir Percy Blakeney's actions must for the moment
have pervaded the mind of his deadly enemy.</p>

<p>Chauvelin had thought out this idea of having the Angelus run
to-night, and was thoroughly pleased with the notion. This was the
day when the duel was to have been fought; seven o'clock would have
been the very hour, and the sound of the Angelus to have been the
signal for the combat, and there was something very satisfying in
the thought that that same Angelus should be rung as a signal that
the Scarlet Pimpernel was withered and broken at last.</p>

<p>In answer to H&eacute;bert's look of bewilderment, Chauvelin
said quietly:</p>

<p>"We must have some signal between ourselves and the guard at the
different gates, also with the harbour officials: at a given moment
the general amnesty must take effect and the harbour become a free
port I have a fancy that the signal shall be the ringing of the
Angelus: the cannons at the gates and the harbour can boom in
response; then the prisons can be thrown open and prisoners can
either participate in the evening f&ecirc;te or leave the city
immediately, as they choose. The Committee of Public Safety has
promised the amnesty: it will carry out its promises to the full,
and when Citizen Collot d'Herbois arrives in Paris with the joyful
news, all natives of Boulogne in the prisons there will participate
in the free pardon too."</p>

<p>"I understand all that, Citizen," said H&eacute;bert, still
somewhat bewildered, "but not the Angelus."</p>

<p>"A fancy, friend H&eacute;bert; and I mean to have it."</p>

<p>"But who is to ring it, Citizen?"</p>

<p>"Morbleu! haven't you one calotin left in Boulogne whom you can
press into doing this service?"</p>

<p>"Aye! calotins enough! There's the Abb&eacute; Foucquet in this
very building...in No. 6 cell..."</p>

<p>"Sacr&eacute; tonnerre!" ejaculated Chauvelin exultantly, "the
very man! I know his dossier well! Once he is free, he will make
straightway for England...he and his family...and will help to
spread the glorious news of the dishonour and disgraces of the
much-vaunted Scarlet Pimpernel!...The very man, friend
H&eacute;bert!...Let him be stationed here...to see the letter
written...to see the money handed over&mdash;for we will go through
with that farce&mdash;and make him understand that the moment I
give him the order, he can run over to his old church, S. Joseph,
and ring the Angelus...The old fool will be delighted...more
especially when he knows that he will thereby be giving the very
signal which will set his own sister's children free...You
understand?..."</p>

<p>"I understand, citizen."</p>

<p>"And you can make the old calotin understand?"</p>

<p>"I think so, citizen...You want him in this room...At what
time?"</p>

<p>"A quarter before seven."</p>

<p>"Yes. I'll bring him along myself, and stand over him, lest he
plays any pranks."</p>

<p>"Oh! he'll not trouble you," sneered Chauvelin. "He'll be deeply
interested in the proceedings. The woman will be here, too,
remember," he added with a jerky movement of the hand in the
direction of Marguerite's room; "the two might be made to stand
together, with four of your fellows round them."</p>

<p>"I understand, citizen. Are any of us to escort the Citizen
Foucquet when he goes to S. Joseph?"</p>

<p>"Aye! two men had best go with him. There will be a crowd in the
streets by then...How far is it from here to the church?"</p>

<p>"Less than five minutes."</p>

<p>"Good. See to it that the doors are opened and the bell-ropes
easy of access."</p>

<p>"It shall be seen to, citizen. How many men will you have inside
this room to-night?"</p>

<p>"Let the walls be lined with men whom you can trust. I
anticipate neither trouble nor resistance. The whole thing is a
simple formality, to which the Englishman has already intimated his
readiness to submit. If he changes his mind at the last moment,
there will be no Angelus rung, no booming of the cannons or opening
of the prison doors: there will be no amnesty, and no free pardon.
The woman will be at once conveyed to Paris, and...But he'll not
change his mind, friend H&eacute;bert," he concluded in suddenly
altered tones, and speaking quite lightly, "he'll not change his
mind."</p>

<p>The conversation between Chauvelin and his familiar had been
carried on in whispers: not that the Terrorist cared whether
Marguerite overheard or not, but whispering had become a habit with
this man, whose tortuous ways and subtle intrigues did not lend
themselves to discussion in a loud voice.</p>

<p>Chauvelin was sitting at the central table, just where he had
been last night when Sir Percy Blakeney's sudden advent broke in on
his meditations. The table had been cleared of the litter of
multitudinous papers which had encumbered it before. On it now
there were only a couple of heavy pewter candlesticks, with the
tallow candles fixed ready in them, a leather pad, an ink well, a
sand box, and two or three quill pens: everything disposed, in
fact, for the writing and signing of the letter.</p>

<p>Already in imagination Chauvelin saw his impudent enemy, the
bold and daring adventurer, standing there beside that table and
putting his name to the consummation of his own infamy. The mental
picture thus evoked brought a gleam of cruel satisfaction and of
satiated lust into the keen, ferret-like face, and a smile of
intense joy lit up the narrow, pale-coloured eyes.</p>

<p>He looked round the room where the great scene would be enacted:
two soldiers were standing on guard outside Marguerite's prison,
two more at attention near the door which gave on the passage: his
own half-dozen picked men were waiting his commands in the
corridor. Presently the whole room would be lined with troops,
himself, and Collot standing with eyes fixed on the principal actor
of the drama! H&eacute;bert with specially selected troopers,
standing on guard over Marguerite!</p>

<p>No, no! he had left nothing to chance this time; and down below
the horses would be ready saddled, that were to convey Collot and
the precious document to Paris.</p>

<p>No! nothing was left to chance, and in either case he was bound
to win. Sir Percy Blakeney would either write the letter, in order
to save his wife, and heap dishonour on himself, or he would shrink
from the terrible ordeal at the last moment and let Chauvelin and
the Committee of Public Safety work their will with her and
him.</p>

<p>"In any case, the pillory as a spy and summary hanging for you,
my friend," concluded Chauvelin in his mind, "and for your
wife...Bah! once you are out of the way, even she will cease to
matter."</p>

<p>He left H&eacute;bert on guard in the room. An irresistible
desire seized him to go and have a look at his discomfited enemy,
and from the latter's attitude make a shrewd guess as to what he
meant to do to-night.</p>

<p>Sir Percy had been given a room on one of the upper floors of
the old prison. He had in no way been closely guarded, and the room
itself had been made as comfortable as may be. He had seemed quite
happy and contented when he had been conducted hither by Chauvelin
the evening before.</p>

<p>"I hope you quite understand, Sir Percy, that you are my guest
here to-night," Chauvelin had said suavely, "but that you are free
to come and go just as you please."</p>

<p>"Lud love you, sir," Sir Percy had replied gaily, "but I verily
believe that I am!"</p>

<p>"It is only Lady Blakeney whom we have cause to watch until
to-morrow," added Chauvelin with quiet significance. "Is not that
so, Sir Percy?"</p>

<p>But Sir Percy seemed whenever his wife's name was mentioned to
lapse into irresistible somnolence. He yawned now with his usual
affectation, and asked at what hour gentlemen in France were wont
to breakfast.</p>

<p>Since then Chauvelin had not seen him. He had repeatedly asked
how the English prisoner was faring, and whether he seemed to be
sleeping and eating heartily. The orderly in charge invariably
reported that the Englishman seemed well, but did not eat much. On
the other hand, he had ordered, and lavishly paid for, measure
after measure of brandy and bottle after bottle of wine.</p>

<p>"Hm! How strange these Englishmen are!" mused Chauvelin. "This
so-called hero is nothing but a wine-sodden brute, who seeks to
nerve himself for a trying ordeal by drowning his faculties in
brandy...Perhaps, after all, he doesn't care!..."</p>

<p>But the wish to have a look at that strangely complex
creature&mdash;hero, adventurer, or mere lucky fool&mdash;was
irresistible, and Chauvelin in the later part of the afternoon went
up to the room which had been allotted to Sir Percy Blakeney.</p>

<p>He never moved now without his escort, and this time also two of
his favourite bodyguard accompanied him to the upper floor. He
knocked at the door, but received no answer; after a second or two
he bade his men wait in the corridor, and gently turning the latch,
he walked in.</p>

<p>There was an odour of brandy in the air, on the table two or
three empty bottles of wine and a glass half-filled with cognac
testified to the truth of what the orderly had said, whilst
sprawling across the camp bedstead, which obviously was too small
for his long limbs, his head thrown back his mouth open for a
vigorous snore, lay the imperturbable Sir Percy, fast asleep.</p>

<p>Chauvelin went up to the bedstead and looked down upon the
reclining figure of the man who had oft been called the most
dangerous enemy of Republican France.</p>

<p>Of a truth, a fine figure of a man, Chauvelin was ready enough
to admit that: the long, hard limbs, the wide chest, and slender,
white hands&mdash;all bespoke the man of birth, breeding, and
energy: the face, too, looked strong and clearly cut in repose, now
that the perpetually inane smile did not play round the firm lips,
nor the lazy, indolent expression mar the seriousness of the
straight brow. For one moment&mdash;it was a mere
flash&mdash;Chauvelin felt almost sorry that so interesting a
career should be thus ignominiously brought to a close.</p>

<p>The Terrorist felt that if his own future, his own honour and
integrity were about to be so hopelessly crushed, he would have
wandered up and down this narrow room like a caged beast, eating
out his heart with self-reproach and remorse, and racking his
nerves and brain for an issue out of the terrible alternative which
meant dishonour or death.</p>

<p>But this man drank and slept.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he does not care!"</p>

<p>And as if in answer to Chauvelin's puzzled musings, a deep snore
escaped the sleeping adventurer's parted lips.</p>

<p>Chauvelin sighed, perplexed and troubled. He looked round the
little room, then went up to a small side table which stood against
the wall, and on which were two or three quill pens and an ink
well, also some loosely scattered sheets of paper. These he turned
over with a careless hand, and presently came across a
closely-written page:</p>

<p class="note">"Citizen Chauvelin:&mdash;In consideration of a
further sum of one million francs..."</p>

<p>It was the beginning of the letter!...only a few words so
far...with several corrections of misspelt words...and a line left
out here and there, which confused the meaning...a beginning made
by the unsteady hand of that drunken fool...an attempt only at
present...</p>

<p>But still...a beginning.</p>

<p>Close by was the draft of it as written out by Chauvelin, and
which Sir Percy had evidently begun to copy.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind, then...He meant to subscribe with his
own hand to his lasting dishonour...and, meaning it, he slept!</p>

<p>Chauvelin felt the paper trembling in his hand. He felt
strangely agitated and nervous, now that the issue was so near...so
sure!...</p>

<p>"There's no demmed hurry for that, is
there...er...Monsieur...Chaubertin?..." came from the slowly
wakening Sir Percy in somewhat thick, heavy accents, accompanied by
a prolonged yawn. "I haven't got the demmed thing quite
ready..."</p>

<p>Chauvelin had been so startled that the paper dropped from his
hand. He stooped to pick it up.</p>

<p>"Nay! why should you be so scared, sir?" continued Sir Percy
lazily. "Did you think I was drunk?...I assure you, sir, on my
honour, I am not so drunk as you think I am."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt, Sir Percy," replied Chauvelin ironically,
"that you have all your marvellous faculties entirely at your
command...I must apologise for disturbing your papers," he added,
replacing the half-written page on the table; "I thought, perhaps,
that if the letter was quite ready..."</p>

<p>"It will be, sir...it will be...for I am not drunk, I assure
you...and can write with a steady hand...and do honour to my
signature..."</p>

<p>"When will you have the letter ready, Sir Percy?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Day Dream</i> must leave the harbour at the turn of the
tide," quoth Sir Percy thickly. "It'll be demmed well time by
then...won't it, sir?..."</p>

<p>"About sundown, Sir Percy...not later..."</p>

<p>"About sundown...not later..." muttered Blakeney, as he once
more stretched his long limbs along the narrow bed.</p>

<p>He gave a loud and hearty yawn.</p>

<p>"I'll not fail you..." he murmured, as he closed his eyes and
gave a final struggle to get his head at a comfortable angle; "the
letter will be written in my best cali...callig...Lud! but I'm not
so drunk as you think I am..."</p>

<p>But as if to belie his own oft-repeated assertion, hardly was
the last word out of his mouth, than his stertorous and even
breathing proclaimed the fact that he was once more fast
asleep.</p>

<p>With a shrug of the shoulders and a look of unutterable contempt
at his broken-down enemy, Chauvelin turned on his heel and went out
of the room.</p>

<p>But outside in the corridor he called the orderly to him, and
gave strict commands that no more wine or brandy was to be served
to the Englishman under any circumstances whatever.</p>

<p>"He has two hours in which to sleep off the effects of all that
brandy which he has consumed," he mused as he finally went back to
his own quarters, "and by that time he will be able to write with a
steady hand."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter33" id=

The English Spy</b>
</h2>

<p>And now at last the shades of evening were drawing in thick and
fast. Within the walls of Fort Gayole the last rays of the setting
sun had long ago ceased to shed their dying radiance, and through
the thick stone embrasures and the dusty panes of glass the grey
light of dusk soon failed to penetrate.</p>

<p>In the large ground-floor room, with its window opened upon the
wide promenade of the southern ramparts, a silence reigned which
was oppressive. The air was heavy with the fumes of the two tallow
candles on the table, which smoked persistently.</p>

<p>Against the walls a row of figures in dark blue uniforms with
scarlet facings, drab breeches, and heavy riding boots, silent and
immovable, with fixed bayonets, like so many automatons lining the
room all round; at some little distance from the central table and
out of the immediate circle of light, a small group composed of
five soldiers in the same blue and scarlet uniforms. One of these
was Sergeant H&eacute;bert. In the centre of this group two persons
were sitting: a woman and an old man.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Foucquet had been brought down from his prison
cell a few minutes ago, and told to watch what would go on around
him, after which he would be allowed to go to his old church, S.
Joseph, and ring the Angelus once more before he and his family
left Boulogne for ever.</p>

<p>The Angelus would be the signal for the opening of all the
prison gates in the town. Everyone to-night could come and go as
they pleased, and having rung the Angelus, the abb&eacute; would be
at liberty to join Fran&ccedil;ois and F&eacute;licit&eacute; and
their old mother, his sister, outside the purlieus of the town.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; Foucquet did not quite understand all this,
which was very rapidly and roughly explained to him. It was such a
very little while ago that he had expected to see the innocent
children mounting up those awful steps which lead to the
guillotine, whilst he himself was looking death quite near in the
face, that all this talk of amnesty and of pardon had not quite
fully reached his brain.</p>

<p>But he was quite content that it had all been ordained by le bon
Dieu, and very happy at the thought of ringing the dearly-loved
Angelus in his own old church once again. So when he was
peremptorily pushed into the room and found himself close to
Marguerite, with four or five soldiers standing round them, he
quietly pulled his old rosary from his pocket and began murmuring
gentle Paters and Aves under his breath.</p>

<p>Beside him sat Marguerite, rigid as a statue, her cloak thrown
over her shoulders, so that its hood might hide her face. She could
not now have said how that awful day had passed, how she had
managed to survive the terrible, nerve-racking suspense, the
agonising doubt as to what was going to happen. But above all, what
she had found most unendurable was the torturing thought that in
this same grim and frowning building her husband was
there...somewhere...how far or how near she could not say...but she
knew that she was parted from him, and perhaps would not see him
again, not even at the hour of death.</p>

<p>That Percy would never write that infamous letter and
<i>live</i>, she knew. That he might write it in order to save her
she feared was possible, whilst the look of triumph on Chauvelin's
face had aroused her most agonising terrors.</p>

<p>When she was summarily ordered to go into the next room she
realised at once that all hope now was more than futile. The walls
lined with troops, the attitude of her enemies, and, above all,
that table with paper, ink, and pens ready, as it were, for the
accomplishment of the hideous and monstrous deed, all made her very
heart numb, as if it were held within the chill embrace of
death.</p>

<p>"If the woman moves, speaks, or screams gag her at once!" said
Collot roughly the moment she sat down, and Sergeant H&eacute;bert
stood over her, gag and cloth in hand, whilst two soldiers placed
heavy hands on her shoulders.</p>

<p>But she neither moved, nor spoke, not even presently when a loud
and cheerful voice came echoing from a distant corridor, and anon
the door opened and her husband came in, accompanied by
Chauvelin.</p>

<p>The ex-ambassador was very obviously in a state of acute nervous
tension, his hands were tightly clasped behind his back, and his
movements were curiously irresponsible and jerky. But Sir Percy
Blakeney looked a picture of calm unconcern: the lace bow at his
throat was tied with scrupulous care, his eyeglass upheld at quite
the correct angle, and his delicate-coloured caped coat was thrown
back sufficiently to afford a glimpse of the dainty cloth suit and
exquisitely embroidered waistcoat beneath.</p>

<p>He was the perfect presentation of a London dandy, and might
have been entering a royal drawing-room in company with an honoured
guest. Marguerite's eyes were riveted on him as he came well within
the circle of light projected by the candles, but not even with
that acute sixth sense of a passionate and loving woman could she
detect the slightest tremor in the aristocratic hand which held the
gold-rimmed eye-glass, nor the faintest quiver of the
firmly-moulded lips.</p>

<p>This had occurred just as the bell of the old Beffroi chimed
three-quarters after six. Now it was close on seven, and in the
centre of the room, and with his face and figure well lighted up by
the candles, at the table, pen in hand, sat Sir Percy writing.</p>

<p>At his elbow, just behind him, stood Chauvelin on the one side
and Collot d'Herbois on the other, both watching with fixed and
burning eyes the writing of that letter.</p>

<p>Sir Percy seemed in no hurry. He wrote slowly and deliberately,
carefully copying the draft of the letter which was propped up in
front of him. The spelling of some of the French words seemed to
have troubled him at first, for when he began he made many
facetious and self-deprecatory remarks anent his own want of
education, and carelessness in youth in acquiring the gentle art of
speaking so elegant a language.</p>

<p>Presently, however, he appeared more at his ease, or perhaps
less inclined to talk, since he only received curt, monosyllabic
answers to his pleasant sallies. Five minutes had gone by without
any other sound, save the spasmodic creak of Sir Percy's pen upon
the paper, the while Chauvelin and Collot watched every word he
wrote.</p>

<p>But gradually from afar there had risen in the stillness of
evening a distant, rolling noise like that of surf breaking against
the cliffs. Nearer and louder it grew, and as it increased in
volume, so it gained now in diversity. The monotonous roll like
far-off thunder was just as continuous as before, but now shriller
notes broke out from amongst the more remote sounds, a loud laugh
seemed ever and anon to pierce the distance and to rise above the
persistent hubbub, which became the mere accompaniment to these
isolated tones.</p>

<p>The merrymakers of Boulogne having started from the Place de la
S&eacute;n&eacute;chauss&eacute;e, were making the round of the
town by the wide avenue which tops the ramparts. They were coming
past the Fort Gayole, shouting, singing, brass trumpets in front,
big drum ahead, drenched, hot, and hoarse, but supremely happy.</p>

<p>Sir Percy looked up for a moment as the noise drew nearer, then
turned to Chauvelin, and, pointing to the letter, he said:</p>

<p>"I have nearly finished!"</p>

<p>The suspense in the smoke-laden atmosphere of this room was
becoming unendurable, and four hearts at least were beating wildly
with overpowering anxiety. Marguerite's eyes were fixed with tender
intensity on the man she so passionately loved. She did not
understand his actions or his motives, but she felt a wild longing
in her to drink in every line of that loved face, as if with this
last long look she was bidding an eternal farewell to all hopes of
future earthly happiness.</p>

<p>The old priest had ceased to tell his beads. Feeling in his
kindly heart the echo of the appalling tragedy which was being
enacted before him, he had put out a fatherly, tentative hand
towards Marguerite, and given her icy fingers a comforting
pressure.</p>

<p>And in the hearts of Chauvelin and his colleague there was
satisfied revenge, eager, exultant triumph, and that terrible
nerve-tension which immediately precedes the long-expected
climax.</p>

<p>But who can say what went on within the heart of that bold
adventurer about to be brought to the lowest depths of humiliation
which it is in the power of man to endure? What behind that smooth,
unruffled brow still bent laboriously over the page of writing?</p>

<p>The crowd was now on the Place Daumont; some of the foremost in
the ranks were ascending the stone steps which lead to the southern
ramparts. The noise had become incessant; Pierrots and Pierrettes,
Harlequins and Columbines had worked themselves up into a veritable
intoxication of shouts and laughter.</p>

<p>Now, as they all swarmed up the steps and caught sight of the
open window, almost on a level with the ground, and of the large,
dimly-lighted room, they gave forth one terrific and voluminous
"Hurrah!" for the paternal government up in Paris, who had given
them cause for all this joy. Then they recollected how the amnesty,
the pardon, the national f&ecirc;te, this brilliant procession had
come about, and somebody in the crowd shouted:</p>

<p>"Allons! let us have a look at that English spy..."</p>

<p>"Let us see the Scarlet Pimpernel!"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes! let us see what he is like!"</p>

<p>They shouted and stamped and swarmed round the open window,
swinging their lanthorns and demanding, in a loud tone of voice,
that the English spy be shown to them.</p>

<p>Faces, wet with rain and perspiration, tried to peep in at the
window. Collot gave brief orders to the soldiers to close the
shutters at once and to push away the crowd, but the crowd would
not be pushed. It would not be gainsaid, and when the soldiers
tried to close the window twenty angry fists broke the panes of
glass.</p>

<p>"I can't finish this writing in your lingo, Sir, whilst this
demmed row is going on," said Sir Percy placidly.</p>

<p>"You have not much more to write, Sir Percy," urged Chauvelin,
with nervous impatience; "I pray you finish the matter now, and get
you gone from out this city."</p>

<p>"Send that demmed lot away then," rejoined Sir Percy,
calmly.</p>

<p>"They won't go...They want to see you..."</p>

<p>Sir Percy paused a moment, pen in hand, as if in deep
reflection.</p>

<p>"They want to see me," he said, with a laugh. "Why, demn it
all...then, why not let 'em?..."</p>

<p>And with a few rapid strokes of the pen he quickly finished the
letter, adding his signature with a bold flourish, whilst the
crowd, pushing, jostling, shouting and cursing the soldiers, still
loudly demanded to see the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>

<p>Chauvelin felt as if his heart would veritably burst with the
wildness of is beating.</p>

<p>Then Sir Percy, with one hand lightly pressed on the letter,
pushed his chair away, and with his pleasant ringing voice, said
once again:</p>

<p>"Well! demn it...let 'em see me!..."</p>

<p>With that he sprang to his feet and up to his full height, and
as he did so he seized the two massive pewter candlesticks, one in
each hand, and with powerful arms well outstretched he held them
high above his head.</p>

<p>"The letter..." murmured Chauvelin, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>But even as he was quickly reaching out a hand, which shook with
the intensity of his excitement, towards the letter on the table,
Blakeney, with one loud and sudden shout, threw the heavy
candlesticks on to the floor. They rattled down with a terrific
crash, the lights were extinguished, and the whole room was
immediately plunged in utter darkness.</p>

<p>The crowd gave a wild yell of fear: they had only caught sight
for one instance of that gigantic figure&mdash;which, with arms
outstretched, had seemed supernaturally tall&mdash;weirdly
illumined by the flickering light of the tallow candles, and the
next moment disappearing into utter darkness before their very
gaze. Overcome with sudden superstitious fear, Pierrots and
Pierrettes, drummer and trumpeters, turned and fled in every
direction.</p>

<p>Within the room all was wild confusion. The soldiers had heard a
cry:</p>

<p>"La fentre! La fentre!"</p>

<p>Who gave it no one knew, no one could afterwards recollect;
certain it is that with one accord the majority of the men made a
rush for the open window, driven thither partly by the wild
instinct of the chase after an escaping enemy, and partly by the
same superstitious terror which had caused the crowd to flee. They
clambered over the sill and dropped down on to the ramparts below,
then started in wild pursuit.</p>

<p>But when the crash came, Chauvelin had given one frantic
shout:</p>

<p>"The letter!!!...Collot!...A moi...In his hand...The
letter!..."</p>

<p>There was a sound of a heavy thud, of a terrible scuffle there
on the floor in the darkness, and then a yell of victory from
Collot d'Herbois.</p>

<p>"I have the letter! A Paris!"</p>

<p>"Victory!" echoed Chauvelin, exultant and panting, "victory!!
The Angelus, friend H&eacute;bert! Take the calotin to ring the
Angelus!!!"</p>

<p>It was instinct which caused Collot d'Herbois to find the door;
he tore it open, letting in a feeble ray of light from the
corridor. He stood in the doorway one moment, his slouchy, ungainly
form distinctly outlined against the lighter background beyond, a
look of exultant and malicious triumph, of deadly hate and cruelty
distinctly imprinted on his face, and with upraised hand wildly
flourishing the precious document, the brand of dishonour for the
enemy of France.</p>

<p>"A Paris!" shouted Chauvelin to him excitedly. "Into
Robespierre's hands...The letter!..."</p>

<p>Then he fell back panting, exhausted on the nearest chair.</p>

<p>Collot, without looking again behind him, called wildly for the
men who were to escort him to Paris. They were picked troopers,
stalwart veterans from the old municipal guard. They had not broken
their ranks throughout the turmoil, and fell into line in perfect
order as they followed Citizen Collot out of the room.</p>

<p>Less than five minutes later there was the noise of stamping and
champing of bits in the courtyard below, a shout from Collot, and
the sound of a cavalcade galloping at break-neck speed toward the
distant Paris gate.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter34" id=

The Angelus</b>
</h2>

<p>And gradually all noises died away around the old Fort Gayole.
The shouts and laughter of the merrymakers, who had quickly
recovered from their fright, now came only as the muffled rumble of
a distant storm, broken here and there by the shrill note of a
girl's loud laughter, or a vigorous fanfare from the brass
trumpets.</p>

<p>The room where so much turmoil had taken place, where so many
hearts had beaten with torrent-like emotions, where the awesome
tragedy of revenge and hate, of love and passion had been
consummated, was now silent and at peace.</p>

<p>The soldiers had gone: some in pursuit of the revellers, some
with Collot d'Herbois, others with H&eacute;bert and the calotin
who was to ring the Angelus.</p>

<p>Chauvelin, overcome with the intensity of his exultation and the
agony of the suspense which he had endured, sat, vaguely dreaming,
hardly conscious, but wholly happy and content. Fearless, too, for
his triumph was complete, and he cared not now if he lived or
died.</p>

<p>He had lived long enough to see the complete annihilation and
dishonour of his enemy.</p>

<p>What had happened to Sir Percy Blakeney now, what to Marguerite,
he neither knew nor cared. No doubt the Englishman had picked
himself up and got away through the window or the door: he would be
anxious to get his wife out of the town as quickly as possible. The
Angelus would ring directly, the gates would be opened, the harbour
made free to everyone...</p>

<p>And Collot was a league outside Boulogne by now...a league
nearer to Paris.</p>

<p>So what mattered the humble wayside English flower, the damaged
and withered Scarlet Pimpernel?...</p>

<p>A slight noise suddenly caused him to start. He had been
dreaming, no doubt, having fallen into some kind of torpor, akin to
sleep, after the deadly and restless fatigue of the past four days.
He certainly had been unconscious of everything around him, of time
and of place. But now he felt fully awake.</p>

<p>And again he heard that slight noise, as if something or someone
was moving in the room.</p>

<p>He tried to peer into the darkness, but could distinguish
nothing. He rose and went to the door. It was still open, and close
behind it, against the wall, a small oil lamp was fixed, which lit
up the corridor.</p>

<p>Chauvelin detached the lamp and came back with it into the room.
Just as he did so there came to his ears the first sound of the
little church bell ringing the Angelus.</p>

<p>He stepped into the room, holding the lamp high above his head;
its feeble rays fell full upon the brilliant figure of Sir Percy
Blakeney.</p>

<p>He was smiling pleasantly, bowing slightly towards Chauvelin,
and in his hand he held the sheathed sword, the blade of which had
been fashioned in Toledo for Lorenzo Cenci, and the fellow of which
was lying now&mdash;Chauvelin himself knew not where.</p>

<p>"The day and the hour, Monsieur, I think," said Sir Percy with
courtly grace, "when you and I are to cross swords together; those
are the southern ramparts, meseems. Will you precede, sir? and I
will follow."</p>

<p>At sight of this man, of his impudence, and of his daring,
Chauvelin felt like an icy grip on his heart. His cheeks became
ashen white, his thin lips closed with a snap, and the hand which
held the lamp aloft trembled visibly. Sir Percy stood before him,
still smiling, and with a graceful gesture pointing towards the
ramparts.</p>

<p>From the church of Saint Joseph the gentle, melancholy tones of
the Angelus sounding the second Ave Maria came faintly echoing in
the evening air.</p>

<p>With a violent effort Chauvelin forced himself to self-control,
and tried to shake off the strange feeling of obsession which had
overwhelmed him in presence of this extraordinary man. He walked
quite quietly up to the table and placed the lamp upon it. As in a
flash recollection had come back to him...the past few
minutes!...the letter! and Collot well on his way to Paris!</p>

<p>Bah! he had nothing to fear now, save perhaps death at the hand
of this adventurer, turned assassin in his misery and
humiliation!</p>

<p>"A truce on this folly, Sir Percy," he said roughly. "As you
well know, I had never any intention of fighting you with these
poisoned swords of yours, and..."</p>

<p>"I knew that, M. Chauvelin...But do <i>you</i> know that I have
the intention of killing you now...as you stand...like a
dog!..."</p>

<p>And, throwing down the sword with one of those uncontrolled
outbursts of almost animal passion which for one instant revealed
the real, inner man, he went up to Chauvelin, and, towering above
him like a great avenging giant, he savoured for one second the joy
of looking down on that puny, slender figure which he could crush
with sheer brute force with one blow from his powerful hands.</p>

<p>But Chauvelin at this moment was beyond fear.</p>

<p>"And if you killed me now, Sir Percy," he said quietly, and
looking the man whom he so hated fully in the eyes, "you could not
destroy that letter which my colleague is taking to Paris at this
very moment."</p>

<p>As he had anticipated, his words seemed to change Sir Percy's
mood in an instant. The passion in the handsome, aristocratic face
faded in a trice, the hard lines round the jaw and lips relaxed,
the fire of revenge died out from the lazy blue eyes, and the next
moment a long, loud, merry laugh raised the dormant echoes of the
old fort.</p>

<p>"Nay, Monsieur Chaubertin," said Sir Percy gaily, "but this is
marvellous...demmed marvellous...do you hear that,
m'dear?...Gadzooks! but 'tis the best joke I have heard this past
twelve months...Monsieur here thinks...Lud! but I shall die of
laughing...Monsieur here thinks...that &#8217;twas that demmed
letter which went to Paris...and that an English gentleman lay
scuffling on the floor and allowed a letter to be filched from
him..."</p>

<p>"Sir Percy!"...gasped Chauvelin, as an awful thought seemed
suddenly to flash across his fevered brain.</p>

<p>"Lud, sir, you are astonishing!" said Sir Percy, taking a very
much crumpled sheet of paper from the capacious pocket of his
elegant caped coat and holding it close to Chauvelin's
horror-stricken gaze. "<i>This</i> is the letter which I wrote at
that table yonder, in order to gain time and in order to fool
you...But by the Lord, you are a bigger demmed fool than ever I
took you to be, if you thought it would serve any other purpose
save that of my hitting you in the face with it."</p>

<p>And with a quick and violent gesture he struck Chauvelin full in
the face with the paper.</p>

<p>"You would like to know, Monsieur Chaubertin, would you not..."
he added pleasantly, "what letter it is that your friend Citizen
Collot is taking in such hot haste to Paris for you?...Well! the
letter is not long, and 'tis written in verse...I wrote it myself
upstairs to-day, whilst you thought me sodden with brandy and
three-parts asleep. But brandy is easily flung out of the
window...Did you think I drank it all?...Nay! as you remember, I
told you that I was not so drunk as you thought?...Aye! the letter
is writ in English verse, Monsieur, and it reads thus:</p>

<p class="note">"We seek him here! we seek him there!<br>
Those Frenchies seek him everywhere!<br>
Is he in heaven? is he in hell?<br>
That demmed elusive Pimpernel?"</p>

<p>"A neat rhyme, I fancy, Monsieur, and one which will, if rightly
translated, greatly please your friend and ruler, Citizen
Robespierre...Your colleague, Citizen Collot is well on his way to
Paris with it by now...No, no, Monsieur...as you rightly said just
now...I really could not kill you...God having blessed me with the
saving sense of humour..."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the third Ave Maria of the Angelus died away on
the evening air. From the harbour and the Old Chateau there came
the loud boom of the cannon.</p>

<p>The hour of the opening of the gates, of the general amnesty and
free harbour, was announced throughout Boulogne.</p>

<p>Chauvelin was livid with rage, fear, and baffled revenge. He
made a sudden rush for the door in a blind desire to call for help,
but Sir Percy had toyed long enough with his prey. The hour was
speeding on: H&eacute;bert and some of the soldiers might return,
and it was time to think of safety and of flight. Quick as a hunted
panther, he had interposed his tall figure between his enemy and
the latter's chance of calling for aid, then, seizing the little
man by the shoulders, he pushed him back into that portion of the
room where Marguerite and the Abb&eacute; Foucquet had been lately
sitting.</p>

<p>The gag, with cloth and cord, which had been intended for a
woman, were lying on the ground close by, just where H&eacute;bert
had dropped them when he marched the old abb&eacute; off to the
church.</p>

<p>With quick and dexterous hands, Sir Percy soon reduced Chauvelin
to an impotent and silent bundle. The ex-ambassador, after four
days of harrowing nerve-tension, followed by so awful a climax, was
weakened physically and mentally, whilst Blakeney, powerful,
athletic, and always absolutely unperturbed, was fresh in body and
spirit. He had slept calmly all the afternoon, having quietly
thought out all his plans, left nothing to chance, and acted
methodically and quickly, and invariably with perfect repose.</p>

<p>Having fully assured himself that the cords were well fastened,
the gag secure, and Chauvelin completely helpless, he took the now
inert mass up in his arms and carried it into the adjoining room,
where Marguerite for twelve hours had endured a terrible
martyrdom.</p>

<p>He laid his enemy's helpless form upon the couch, and for one
moment looked down on it with a strange feeling of pity, quite
unmixed with contempt. The light from the lamp in the further room
struck vaguely upon the prostrate figure of Chauvelin. He seemed to
have lost consciousness, for the eyes were closed, only the hands,
which were tied securely to his body, had a spasmodic, nervous
twitch in them.</p>

<p>With a good-natured shrug of the shoulders, the imperturbable
Sir Percy turned to go, but just before he did so, he took a scrap
of paper from his waistcoat pocket and slipped it between
Chauvelin's trembling fingers. On the paper were scribbled the four
lines of verse which in the next four-and-twenty hours Robespierre
himself and his colleague would read.</p>

<p>Then Blakeney finally went out of the room.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter35" id=
"Chapter35"></a>Chapter 35<br>
Marguerite</b>
</h2>

<p>As he re-entered the large room, she was standing beside the
table, with one dainty hand resting against the back of the chair,
her whole graceful figure bent forward as if in an agony of ardent
expectation.</p>

<p>Never for an instant, in that supreme moment when his precious
life was at stake, did she waver in courage or presence of mind.
From the time that he jumped up and took the candlesticks in his
hands, her sixth sense showed her as in a flash what he meant to do
and how he would wish her to act.</p>

<p>When the room was plunged in darkness she stood absolutely
still; when she heard the scuffle on the floor she never trembled,
for her passionate heart had already told her that he never meant
to deliver that infamous letter into his enemies' hands. Then, when
there was a general scramble, when the soldiers rushed away, when
the room became empty and Chauvelin alone remained, she shrank
quietly into the darkest corner of the room, hardly breathing, only
waiting...waiting for a sign from him!</p>

<p>She could not see him, but she felt the loved presence there,
somewhere close to her, and she knew that he would wish her to
wait...She watched him silently...ready to help if he
called...equally ready to remain still and to wait.</p>

<p>Only when the helpless body of her deadly enemy was well out of
the way did she come from out the darkness, and now she stood with
the full light of the lamp illumining her ruddy golden hair, the
delicate blush on her cheek, the flame of love dancing in her
glorious eyes.</p>

<p>Thus he saw her as he re-entered the room, and for one second he
paused at the door, for the joy of seeing her there seemed greater
than he could bear.</p>

<p>Forgotten was the agony of mind which he had endured, the
humiliations and the dangers which still threatened: he only
remembered that she loved him and that he worshipped her.</p>

<p>The next moment she lay clasped in his arms. All was still
around them, save for the gentle patter-patter of the rain on the
trees of the ramparts: and from very far away the echo of laughter
and music from the distant revellers.</p>

<p>And then the cry of the sea-mew, thrice repeated, from just
beneath the window.</p>

<p>Blakeney and Marguerite awoke from their brief dream: once more
the passionate lover gave place to the man of action.</p>

<p>"'Tis Tony, an I mistake not," he said hurriedly, as with loving
fingers, still slightly trembling with suppressed passion, he
re-adjusted the hood over her head.</p>

<p>"Lord Tony?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Aye! with Hastings and one or two others. I told them to be
ready for us to-night, as soon as the place was quiet."</p>

<p>"You were so sure of success, then, Percy?" she asked in
wonderment.</p>

<p>"So sure," he replied simply.</p>

<p>Then he led her to the window and lifted her on to the sill. It
was not high from the ground, and two pairs of willing arms were
there ready to help her down.</p>

<p>Then he, too, followed, and quietly the little party turned to
walk towards the gate. The ramparts themselves now looked strangely
still and silent: the merrymakers were far away, only one or two
passers-by hurried swiftly past here and there, carrying bundles,
evidently bent on making use of that welcome permission to leave
this dangerous soil.</p>

<p>The little party walked on in silence, Marguerite's small hand
resting on her husband's arm. Anon they came upon a group of
soldiers who were standing somewhat perfunctorily and irresolutely
close by the open gate of the fort.</p>

<p>"Tiens c'est l'Anglais!" said one.</p>

<p>"Morbleu! he is on his way back to England," commented another
lazily.</p>

<p>The gates of Boulogne had been thrown open to everyone when the
Angelus was run and the cannon boomed. The general amnesty had been
proclaimed, everyone had the right to come and go as they pleased,
the sentinels had been ordered to challenge no one and to let
everybody pass.</p>

<p>No one knew that the great and glorious plans for the complete
annihilation of the Scarlet Pimpernel and his League had come to
naught, that Collot was taking a mighty hoax to Paris, and that the
man who had thought out and nearly carried through the most
fiendishly cruel plan ever conceived for the destruction of an
enemy, lay helpless, bound and gagged, within his own
stronghold.</p>

<p>And so the little party, consisting of Sir Percy and Marguerite,
Lord Anthony Dewhurst and my lord Hastings, passed unchallenged
through the gates of Boulogne.</p>

<p>Outside the precincts of the town they met my lord Everingham
and Sir Philip Glynde, who had met the Abb&eacute; Foucquet outside
his little church and escorted him safely out of the city, whilst
Fran&ccedil;ois and F&eacute;licit&eacute;, with their old mother,
had been under the charge of other members of the League.</p>

<p>"We were all in the procession, dressed up in all sorts of
ragged finery, until the last moment," explained Lord Tony to
Marguerite, as the entire party now quickly made its way to the
harbour. "We did not know what was going to happen...All we knew
was that we should be wanted about this time&mdash;the hour when
the duel was to have been fought&mdash;and somewhere near here on
the southern ramparts...and we always have strict orders to mix
with any crowd if there happens to be one. When we saw Blakeney
raise the candlesticks, we guessed what was coming, and we each
went to our respective posts. It was all quite simple."</p>

<p>The young man spoke gaily and lightly, but through the easy
banter of his tone there pierced the enthusiasm and pride of the
soldier in the glory and daring of his chief.</p>

<p>Between the city walls and the harbour there was much bustle and
agitation. The English packet boat would lift anchor at the turn of
the tide, and as everyone was free to get aboard without leave or
passport, there were a very large number of passengers, bound for
the land of freedom.</p>

<p>Two boats from the <i>Day Dream</i> were waiting in readiness
for Sir Percy and my lady, and those whom they would bring with
them.</p>

<p>Silently the party embarked, and as the boats pushed off and the
sailors from Sir Percy's yacht bent to their oars, the old
Abb&eacute; Foucquet began gently droning a Pater and Ave, to the
accompaniment of his beads.</p>

<p>He accepted joy, happiness, and safety with the same gentle
philosophy as he would have accepted death, but Marguerite's keen
and loving ears caught at the end of each Pater a gently murmured
request to le bon Dieu to bless and protect our English
rescuer.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Only once did Marguerite make allusion to that terrible time,
which had become the past.</p>

<p>They were wandering together down the chestnut alley in the
beautiful garden at Richmond. It was evening, and the air was heavy
with the rich odour of wet earth, of belated roses, and dying
mignonette. She had paused in the alley and placed a trembling hand
upon his arm, whilst raising her eyes, filled with tears of tender
passion, up to his face.</p>

<p>"Percy," she murmured, "have you forgiven?"</p>

<p>"What, m'dear?"</p>

<p>"That awful evening in Boulogne...what that fiend demanded...his
awful'either-or'...I brought it all upon you...it was all my
fault."</p>

<p>"Nay, my dear, for that 'tis I should thank you..."</p>

<p>"Thank me?"</p>

<p>"Aye," he said, whilst in the fast-gathering dusk she could only
just perceive the sudden hardening of his face, the look of wild
passion in his eyes; "but for that evening in Boulogne, but for
that alternative which that devil placed before me, I might never
have known how much you meant to me."</p>

<p>Even the recollection of all the sorrow, the anxiety, the
torturing humiliations of that night seemed completely to change
him: the voice became trenchant, the hands were tightly clenched.
But Marguerite drew nearer to him, her two hands were on his
breast, she murmured gently:</p>

<p>"And now?..."</p>

<p>He folded her in his arms with an agony of joy, and said
earnestly:</p>

<p>"Now I know."</p>
