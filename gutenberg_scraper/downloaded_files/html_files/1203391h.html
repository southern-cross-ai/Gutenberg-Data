<h2>Production Notes:</h2>
<p>Barrington's book relies heavily on David Collins's "An
Account of the English Colony of NSW", Vol. 1 (1798) and Vol. 2
(1802).</p>
<p>This work combines the scans of two editions of the same book.
In the first [1802] edition, there are contents but no
illustrations. In the second [nominally 1810], there are
illustrations, no contents, a "supplement" and various updating
paragraphs, annotated as such.</p>
<p>The main technical production problems have been: * the
original scan is in poor condition (mould) and poorly printed,
making checking of punctuation difficult. * the sources are
various, and hence spellings are commonly inconsistent.</p>
<p>Some of the punctuation has been modernised, chiefly
quotations.</p>
<p>I have tried to make the spellings of the main people, places,
ships, etc. consistent. Although Parramatta is so spelt in the
tile page, it is spelt "Paramatta" throughout; this spelling has
been retained, as have most others, except obvious typographical
errors.</p>
<p>As a convention, all pounds (money) are shown italicised, e.g.
25<i>l</i>, although the "&pound;" sign is used in the 2nd
Edition.</p>
<p>In the 2nd Edition, and in Collins's account, ships' names are
italicised; here they are not.</p>
<p>Where a year begins, I have interpolated it at the start of
the paragraph in which it occurs; e.g. "1793.]"</p>
<p>Barrington's footnotes are shown in [ ] at the end of the
paragraph in which the note is indicated</p>

the Public for the very liberal patronage they have kindly shewn
this publication, on which he is conscious that neither pains or
expense has been <i>spared</i>, to execute it in a style which
must be highly satisfactory.</p>
<p>The Publisher at the same time requests the attention of the
Public to a Republication, much enlarged, of <i>Barrington's

&amp;c. &amp;c. which will be compleated in Twelve Numbers, at
One Shilling each, and be enriched with Views, Map, &amp;c.
elegantly coloured, and a fine Portrait of the Author.</p>
<p>The <i>History of New South Wales</i>, which the Public have
honoured with such general approbation, is a work entirely
original, having never before been printed; but the
<i>Voyage</i>, &amp;c. which constitutes the intended Work, is a
new edition of Barrington's celebrated Voyage, of which several
editions have been sold: to which are made many very considerable
corrections and improvements. The following very flattering

<b>SIRE,</b>
<p>       <small>ONE</small> of the most humble of your subjects,
presumes to lay at your feet, the History of New South Wales, and
your Majesty's Colony on that Island. Tempted by that eminent.
Philanthropy, with which, your Majesty is so peculiarly endowed,
and the knowledge of which, in the most distant parts of the
World, has more gloriously exalted your illustrious Name, in the
hearts of all good Men, than, even your truly powerful Fleets and
Armies, have enrolled it in the History of Great Sovereigns.</p>
<p>If your Majesty should deign to look on this Production, you
will have the satisfaction of finding, that the life you have so
well spent, in promoting the Comforts and Happiness of the many
Millions committed to your Care, is even of such an Heavenly
nature, as in many cases to correct, and often reform, the most
vicious of those, who have been found improper persons, to remain
in those kingdoms, which are blessed with your immediate
presence.</p>
<p>That just knowledge of Mankind, your Majesty has so often
shown, in the appointment of your Officers, has seldom been more
beneficially felt, than in those you have from time to time
chosen for New South Wales, who have in all cases, been,
Gentlemen particularly calculated to represent your Person, and
to fulfil your intentions, as they have possessed Learning,
Prudence, Justice, and Mercy.</p>
<p>That your Majesty, may long continue Vice-Regent on Earth, and

<br>
<br>
<p><small>TO</small> trace from the <small>ORIGIN</small>, the
<small>HISTORY</small> of any <small>COUNTRY</small>, but more
particularly the one of so promising an aspect of future
importance as that of <small>NEW SOUTH WALES</small> is an
undertaking very interesting, but not often to be accomplished
with that degree of certainty, which precludes every idea, of
<small>SPECULATIVE FICTION</small>, though when capable of being
effected, it forms a valuable acquisition to the
<small>WORLD</small>. In this situation stands <small>NEW SOUTH
WALES</small>. <small>CIRCUMNAVIGATORS</small> have frequented
it, and the <small>PUBLIC</small> have been favoured with the
Accounts of Individuals who have resided there, but no prior
attempt has been made to produce a <small>COMPLETE
HISTORY</small> of the <small>COUNTRY</small> itself, from its
<small>DISCOVERY</small>, and an Account of its
<small>INHABITANTS</small>, their <small>CUSTOMS</small>, and
<small>MANNERS</small>, accompanied with, an Historical Detail,
of the proceedings of the <small>ENGLISH COLONY</small>, from the
<small>FOUNDATION</small> to its <small>PRESENT
STATE</small>.</p>
<p>That such a <small>WORK</small> must prove acceptable to the
World in general, but particularly to his fellow Countrymen, the
Author is well aware; and as his residence in the Country,
enables him to add considerably to the vast fund of knowledge
already ascertained, he trusts, that his endeavour to furnish
<small>A COMPLETE HISTORY OF NEW SOUTH WALES</small>, will meet
with general approbation. If in the perusal of this Work, the
refined mind finds but a few moments pleasure, in following the
interesting Narratives respecting the Natives or Colonists; or if
he is beguiled of one tear of sensibility, in commisserating the
sorrows or sufferings, of his <small>INNOCENT</small> or
<small>GUILTY</small> fellow creatures, the end of the Author
will be answered: for though, alas! he has formerly wandered in
the paths of error, he trusts, that now he has felt the kind hand
of <small>PATRONIZING FAVOUR</small>, he may be looked upon as a
<small>MAN ENDEAVOURING TO DO WELL</small>, and hopes the
promotion he has received, will be the means of enabling him to
effect, some good in the remnant of his life, to
<small>COUNTER-BALANCE</small> that proneness to evil which is
ever, too attendant on the <small>HUMAN CREATURE</small>.<br>

<small>OF</small><br>
<br>
BARRINGTON'S<br>
<i>HISTORY OF NEW SOUTH WALES,<br>
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</i>]</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>[THE rapid sale of the first Edition of this
entertaining Work, and the frequent demands and enquiries since
made relative to the same, together with the increasing
importance of our Settlements in New South Wales, &amp;c. having
induced the publishers to reprint the present Edition, it has
been thought proper to extend and enlarge the original plan by a
Supplement, bringing down the History of the Settlement to the
present Period of 1811.<br>
<br>
With this view, it has been the care of the Editor, besides the
information received from the spot, to collect his materials from
every quarter which could possibly afford him any information:
for this purpose, neither the labours of the missionary, the
journals of the navigator, native or foreigner, nor the public
documents relative to the colony, have been neglected. The merit
of the arrangement and the execution of the task he must submit
to the candour of his readers to decide upon.<br>
<br>
It may be necessary to point out to the recollection of the
public, that the History of New South Wales, written by George
Barrington, after recording the events which distinguished that
distant quarter of the world up to the year 1801, proceeded to
relate the several voyages of discovery made from thence into the
Southern Ocean, &amp;c.; particularly those of Lieutenants Bass
and Flinders, Captain Bampton of the Hormuzear, &amp;c.
&amp;c.<br>
<br>
But in the present Edition the reader will find the still more
important extracts from the recent voyages of M.
<i>Labillardiere</i>, who was sent in search of the unfortunate
<i>La Perouse</i>; and that of M. <i>Peron</i>, who visited
Sydney between 1800 and 1804, while upon a voyage of discovery
made by order of the First Consul of France in the Southern
Hemisphere. This enlightened naturalist's remarks, so creditable
to the genius and exertions of the British nation, are sufficient
to shew how astonishingly the colony has improved since
Barrington published his History, Voyage, &amp;c. &amp;c. Almost
every subsequent navigator, it will appear, has either found out
some new islands, or something new in the manners of those
already known.<br>
<br>
Added to these, the present volume contains very interesting and
entertaining accounts not only of Van Diemen's Land, upon which a
British settlement has been since established, but likewise of
New Caledonia, New Ireland, New Zealand, the Island of Simboo,
Kennedy's Island, and Mangea; also of Otaheite, especially so far
as Pomarre, the king of that and some adjacent places, has been
connected with the missionaries, who are protected by Government
in their attempts to introduce religion into the Friendly
Islands.<br>
<br>
To the Geographical department in this Edition we have added that
of the Biography of some of the principal persons who have
distinguished themselves in this newly discovered part of the
world: among these, our readers may recollect Governor Colonel
Collins, Captain Bligh of the Bounty, Lieutenant Riou of the
Guardian, Messrs. Muir, Palmer, Skirving, and Margarot; and a
young Englishman of the name of Bruce, lately married to a
Princess of New Zealand. In fine, we presume that the present
improved Edition contains "A comprehensive History of the Country
itself, from its Discovery; the Customs and Manners of its
Inhabitants; its Productions; and an Historical Detail of the
Proceedings of the Colony from the Foundation to its present
State."]</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> important advantages, which will
continually result to the <small>MOTHER COUNTRY</small>, from
<small>NEW SOUTH WALES</small>, renders it of sufficient
consequence to make the slightest information sought after with
anxious avidity&mdash; nor is it a matter of surprise.&mdash;The
Climate is healthy, the Soil good, and the very Bowels of the
Earth is fraught with inexhaustible treasures; it contains Iron,
Copper, and Coals; while the exterior abounds in Wood, and the
Fruits, which are various, reach the summit of perfection, these
advantages will accelerate the growing importance of the Trade
and Commercial Interest of the Country, while Bays and Harbours
offer their sheltering protection to Ships.</p>
<p>Yet considerable as these advantages are, they are very far
surpassed, by the School the English Colony forms, for the
Correction of those unfortunate Human Beings, who, urged by
various depraved motives, forfeit the protection of the Laws they
have failed to observe; it is much to be lamented, that the
number of Objects thus exiled is so great, while it is highly
honourable in a Government to afford, even these outcasts, an
opportunity of being serviceable to the state, and by their own
good conduct, ultimately to themselves.&mdash;To the original
Projector of the Colony, (Lord Sydney) the Public are under great
obligations, and no doubt can now arise of its
success.&mdash;Though it must prove painful to observe, that many
sent to <small>NEW SOUTH WALES</small>, continued
incorrigible&mdash;yet, on the contrary, some in the infancy of
the Colony, will be found reforming rapidly, and the penitence of
a <small>FEW</small>, cannot be but acceptable to Man, since in
Heaven <small>THERE IS JOY</small> <i>over even one</i>
<small>SINNER</small> <i>that</i> <small>TRULY
REPENTS</small>.</p>
<p>In executing the History of <small>NEW SOUTH WALES</small>, I
mail avail myself of all my materials, under a regular series of
Chapters; first tracing the Discovery, then the Nature, Customs,
and Manners of its original Inhabitants, from that I mall proceed
to the Plan for settling the Colony, its Foundation and Progress
to the present Time; and lastly, the Natural History of the
Island, thus endeavouring to present a Complete Whole.<br>

<h3><small>THE</small><br>
<br>
HISTORY<br>
<br>
<small>OF</small><br>
<br>
NEW SOUTH WALES<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>IN</small> contemplating the origin, rise, and fall of
nations, the mind is alternately filled with a mixture of sacred
pain and pleasure. And while the "mind's eye", views the
prosperous state of this infant country, it can hardly refrain,
taking an excursive glance at the United States of America, and
at the same time, find itself, obliged to acknowledge, that it
must prove equally great, and ardently hope, it will prove
abundantly more grateful, to the mother country.</p>
<p>The beautiful and fertile island of New South Wales, is
ascertained to be the largest in the world, and formerly supposed
to be part of that imaginary continent, called Terra Australis
Incognita, lies between 10 degrees 30 minutes, and 43 degrees
South latitude, and between 110 and 153 degrees 30 minutes East
longitude, extending in all as much, as the whole continent of
Europe, the Eastern coast running not less than 2000 miles in
length from North-East to South-West. Its dimensions from East to
West has not been so accurately ascertained.</p>
<p>The Dutch navigators who chiefly explored the Island, called
those parts first discovered <small>EENDRAGHT</small>
(<i>Concord</i>) Land, which was the name of the ship that first
made the land, in 1616, 24 degrees and 25 degrees South. Two
years afterwards, Zeachen discovered another part of the coast,
in 15 degrees South, who named it <small>ARNHEIM DIEMAN</small>,
though this was not the same part that received the name of
Dieman's Land from Tasman, which is the extremity Southward, in
latitude 43 degrees. Jan Van Edelsgave in 1619, has given his own
name to a Southern part. Dampier coasted the Western parts in
1687, and again in 1699; from this period it was visited several
times, by the Dutch and others, but nothing of any consequence
transpired till in 1770, when the celebrated Captain Cook,
explored the country, and called it <small>NEW SOUTH
WALES</small>; however, the shortness of his stay precluded him
from making any thing more than general observations, though Sir
Joseph Banks, (then Mr. Banks,) discovered such an ample field
for botanical research, that one part, in compliment to him, was
called <small>BOTANY BAY.</small>&mdash;It will not be requisite
to relate here, the remarks made by Captain Cook, as we shall
incorporate his with all other information through the course of
the work. Therefore shall now proceed in the proposed plan; first
with</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic01" id="id03"></a><img alt="" src=
"1203391h-images/pic01.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">A Male &amp; Female Native</p>
<br>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>THE<br>
<br>
NATURE, CUSTOMS AND MANNERS<br>
<br>
OF THE NATIVES.</small></p>
<p><small>BOTH</small> the male and female natives, are not
generally tall, and very few of either sex are well made, their
limbs are long and thin, the exercise they take, and the poverty
of their living, must be the cause, for the climate is
particularly fine. But the limbs of those who reside in the
woods, exceed in length those on the coast; for these suffer very
great difficulties to procure food, while those on the coast draw
from the never-failing ocean an ample supply of fish; but the
inhabitants of the woods have to hunt and climb trees for animals
and honey; enabled by the parental hand of providence they effect
this, with little labour armed with a stone hatchet, they cut a
notch in the tree big enough to place the ball of the great toe,
which done, they take the first step, embracing the tree with one
arm, and holding the hatchet in the other, in this situation the
next notch is cut higher up, for the other foot to rest on, and
proceeding thus they reach as high as they wish, which is often
from eighty to an hundred feet. The features of the men are hard
and disgusting, and the bone or reed they wear through the nose,
added to the bushy hair of their heads and beards, render them
almost horrible. The females have a small portion of that
delicacy the more refined females of civilized nations justly
boast; indeed, even the blush of shame has been seen, on the dark
cheeks of a female native of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Their eyes are sunk in the head, and covered with thick
eye-brows; their noses are flat, with very wide nostrils; their
eyes are particularly good, and forms to them the greatest
acquisition, for if short sighted, they could not avoid the
spears which would otherwise wound, if not kill them. Their
mouths are wide, and lips very thick; their teeth are in general
white, sound, and even. Some of them have prominent jaws, and one
of them, called old We-rahng, might with great ease pass for an
Orang-Outang.</p>
<p>Both sexes rub fish-oil into their skins, which with the heat
of their own bodies, produce a stench which by no means accords
with the refined ideas of decency; but this is used to guard
against the musquitoes some of which sting with severity; however
in this, as in all other parts, some are more beastly than
others, and it is by no means uncommon to see the entrails of
fish frying upon their heads in the sun, till the oil runs over
the face and body. This unguent is deemed by them of so much
importance, that children even of two years old are taught the
use of it. The natives of this country have various ornaments;
with gum, they fasten to their hair, fish-bones, birds' feathers,
slips of wood, dogs'-tails, and the teeth of the kangaroo; those
on the South of Botany Bay, plat the hair with gum, like pieces
of rope, and, occasionally, they daub themselves with red and
white clay, the latter previous to dancing, and the former to
battle. The forms of these imagined ornaments are governed by the
taste of the person; and really, those who excel in this plastic
art, look like spectres. Scars are by both sexes deemed highly
ornamental, inasmuch, that they are proud to have wounds made
with shells, and as they keep these open the flesh grows up on
each side, and then suffering it to skin over, it forms the
honourable badge of a wale or seam. This operation is generally
performed when young, and though for many years they continue
full, in the decline of life they become nearly invisible. The
hole, which is bored through the nose, between the age of twelve
and fifteen, is only used on particular occasions to put the reed
or bone in; this ceremony is generally confined to the male,
though there are instances of the females undergoing the same
mutilation. The women suffer another operation when infants,
which is the loss of two joints of the little finger on the left
hand, this is effected by a hair being tied round the joint,
which stops the circulation, when the part drops off in
consequence of mortification; very few indeed escape this loss,
and those few who do, are treated with contempt.</p>

<p align="center">Manhood, or knocking out the Tooth</p>
<p>The men too suffer a privation, most of them lose the right
front tooth, which operation is attended with numerous
ceremonies. The principals who perform it, come from Cam-mer-ray,
armed with shields, clubs, and throwing sticks, painted in the
form of their tribe; the ground selected for the business is
previously cleared in an oval figure of about 30 feet by 20, and
this mystic spot is called Yoo-lahng: the operators arrived, take
their position at one end of it, and at the other end the boys,
generally to the number of from 14 to 20, and of various ages,
who are brought by their friends or relations to undergo the
ceremony, which initiates them into the liberties of men, as soon
as they are capable of performing the duties. The ceremony then
begins, from the opposite end of the Yoo-lahng, the armed party
advance, singing and clattering their shields and spears, and
with their feet kicking up dust enough to hide and choak every
body around them; on nearly reaching the children, one of the
armed men steps forward, and seizing a lad returns to his party,
who hail him by a shout, showing at the same time, a
determination to keep and protect the victim; in this way the
whole are taken and seated on the opposite end of the Yoo-lahng,
each with his legs crossed under him, holding down his head and
clasping his hands. Miserable as this situation must be, it is
not to be altered during the night, and till all the ceremony
concludes, no refreshment is to be given them.&mdash;As the
natives are well aware, that the knocking out the tooth is
attended with considerable pain, the performers of the mystic
rites have cunning enough to impress on the minds of those about
to suffer, that on their being delivered of a bone, for which
farce they conceal one in a girdle, that the operation will be
effected with a proportionate degree of ease, as they surfer the
greater degree of pain. Thus one falls on the ground, and draws
himself into every form that ideal pain can invent, and while in
this state, some dance, some sing, and some beat him, till he
produces the wonderful bone that is to perform the operation with
little or no pain. This closes the first act of the farce, and
with it generally closes the day.</p>
<p>Towards sunrise the next morning, the party advance into the
Yoo-lahng, shouting, and running three times round it.</p>
<p>The operators now parade round the Yoo-lahng, on their hands
and feet like dogs, with a wooden sword in the girdle, which from
the position it takes behind, serves to represent the tail; this
is meant to endow them with the good qualities of that animal.
The next ceremony is, one brings into the circle a kangaroo made
of grass, and a second a load of brush-wood, and it is not
unusual for him to have some in his nose. These are laid at the
feet of the young men, and the bearers retire. By this form they
are supposed to have the power of killing the animal given them,
and the brush-wood is the retreat of the kangaroo.&mdash;The
following scene is to shew them one of the exercises, hunting the
kangaroo; for this purpose they leave the boys some time, and
taking off the sword, or dog's-tail, they fasten some long grass
to the girdles, and approach the circle as a herd of kangaroos,
jumping along to the music of a shield, beat with a club. On
reaching the Yoo-lahng, they pass the boys, then throwing away
the grass tails, each takes up a boy and carries him off to the
next scene, which is opened by several laying on the ground. The
boys are then made to stand together; at each end sits a man on
the stump of a tree, with his arms extended: as the boys make
towards these, the men begin to stare and loll out their tongues;
the boys are now led over the men, who then make a noise like
thunder at a great distance. This is meant to make them brave
men. The whole party then stop and the boys are set down. At the
same time the performers, arm with spear and shield, the whole
then poise and present their spears, at every third stroke which
one gives his shield with a club, who stands in the centre. This
is to shew the use of the spear to the youths. The scene that
follows, is the ceremony of knocking out the tooth. A native sits
on the grass, and a lad is seated on his shoulders. Now the
mystic bone is produced to lance the gum, for which purpose it is
made sharp; a stick is then with great ceremony cut at some
distance from the end, and laid on a tree, then three aims are
taken before it is struck, when the gum is cut, the operator puts
the sharp point of the stick on the tooth, and with a stone in
the other hand, after making three aims, he hits the stick, and
out falls the tooth, generally as perfect as if drawn by a
dentist. The lad is then taken away, that the gum may be healed
by his friends, who dress him as he must for some time appear;
which dress, consists of a girdle a wooden sword, and a ligature
round his head; for that day, he must neither eat or speak, and
his left hand must be kept up to his mouth.</p>
<p>It is deemed honourable to bear this operation without any
sign of dissatisfaction, but for fear all should not have
fortitude enough to bear it, the assistants make a great
noise.</p>
<p>It is curious that the sufferer adds to his own name that of
the person, on whose shoulders he sits to have the operation
performed.</p>
<p>The ceremony being ended, and the youths all dressed alike,
they sit down, and on a sudden given signal, they rise and rush
into the town, which is just by, and drive everybody before them.
These are now allowed to use the spear and shield, and accepted
as men.</p>
<p>One good quality these people certainly possess, which is,
that if a man and his wife, on any occasion quarrel, no one takes
the least notice of it, each present minds his own business
without casting even a look, at the wrangling pair. This is,
perhaps, one of the best lessons these savages afford to
civilized society; and in this instance, the children of nature
shew more sense than those of refinement.</p>
<p>The men fish with a fish-gig, or spear, which they are very
dexterous in the use of. The fish-gig is about twelve feet long,
which they can lengthen by joints, according to the depth of the
water. At the end they have two, three, or four barbed prongs,
with a hook of a fish or other bone; sometimes, in fine weather,
a man will lay across his canoe with his face in or near the
water, and his fish-gig ready for darting: thus they watch for
prey, and seldom miss their aim. The women are employed in the
canoes with lines and hooks; the lines are made of the bark of
trees, the hooks, like those used by the men, are made of bits of
shells and birds talons, in one of their miserable canoes, which
is seldom more than six inches from the surface of the water,
washing the edge nearly in surf, which would frighten many seamen
in a good vessel, the youngest child, if very small, lies in its
mother's lap, from whence it cannot fall, though she is busy
fishing, as she sits in the bottom of the canoe, with her knees
up to her breast; thus, between her knees and body, the child is
secure. The men also dive and procure fish from the rocks under
water, where they often remain a considerable time; when rising,
to the surface they throw on shore what they have gained, to a
person who attends to dress it by broiling on a fire kept ready
for the purpose.</p>
<p>They have a curious way of catching birds. A native, will in
the heat of the sun lay down as if asleep, holding a bit of fish
in his hand; the bird seeing the bait, seizes on the fish, and
the native then catches it.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic03" id="id05"></a><img alt="" src=
"1203391h-images/pic03.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">A Native Family</p>
<br>
<p>The spirit of retaliation, and ideas of honor they entertain,
produces some singular circumstances, of which the following is
one: A native of Botany Bay had been beaten by two natives of
another tribe, one of these was in return to be beaten by him;
for this purpose a party attended over night at the edge of a
stream, near the settlement, to dance, which they continued doing
till past twelve o'clock: the man who was to be beat danced with
the rest, and then lay down among them. The next morning, while
he was asleep at the foot of a tree, the one who was to beat him
and another armed with spears and clubs, rushed on him; one threw
his spear at him, but missed his object, when the other gave him
two blows with his club. This awoke him, he got up, but being
unarmed, he sorrowfully hung down his head; no more blows were
given, and his enemy wiped the blood from his wounds with some
grass: after this they were friends, for having satisfied his
revenge he forgot the injury he formerly received.</p>
<p>The great trouble they have in obtaining fire makes them
seldom be without it; when it so happens, a number seat
themselves in a circle, and as it is a work of great labour each
takes a turn when the other is tired. It is performed by fixing
the cylindrical piece of wood in a hollow made in a plane, the
round part is then twirled round swiftly between both the hands,
sliding them up and down, and thus it goes round till the
wished-for fire is produced.</p>
<p>The men often singe the beard, which is deemed one of the most
painful operations they can undergo.</p>
<p>These people, whose natural capacity so little can be urged in
favour of, display in some cases extraordinary ingenuity, for
various figures have been discovered, cut on the surface of large
stones, representing themselves in different attitudes, their
canoes, fish, and animals; and when that rudeness of the
instruments, they must necessarily have used is considered, they
exhibit perhaps, generally speaking, as strong likenesses as many
portraits painted by our own artists in England.</p>
<p>The natives had no conception of boiling water originally, for
when the crew of a boat were boiling some fish, a native, while
our people were at a little distance, put his hand in to get some
fish, and was of course scalded, and much astonished.</p>
<p>Both the male and female natives are particularly filthy in
their food, indeed they care not what they devour, even the
vermin from the head and maggots from trees they deem a great
relish; and not content with what may come in their way by
chance, they throw pieces of wood at the end of a line into the
water to catch worms, maggots, and other vermin.</p>
<p>Though a trivial offence in their ideas justifies the murder
of each other, they highly reprobate the crime, when committed
without what they esteem a just cause, and the relations of the
slain seek redress by retaliation.</p>
<p>The colour of the natives, is by no means uniform, some are of
a copper colour, while others are perfectly black, but so filthy
are they in their persons that their appearance is generally that
of dirty black; when first born the skin is of a red hue, which
in a few weeks turns to the colour of the parents, and then it
never changes again.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>DWELLINGS.</small></p>
<p>THOSE who repose on the soft pillow of ease will doubtless
pity the situation of these savages, to the regular-built house,
the protecting door, and the refreshing bed they are equally
strangers. The miserable huts in which these people exist are
made of the barks of trees, placed with both ends on the ground.
Those near the coast are larger than those in the woods, which
are generally formed only of one bark, and shelter one person,
while the large ones hold five or six. At the mouth of each
dwelling is, in most cases a nest of insects, drawn together by
the bones and remnants of their food, and close to the hut is the
fire which renders it smokey. Accidents by fire are frequent,
many burn their toes and legs while asleep, and so very difficult
are they to awaken, that a child is often seriously burnt while
sleeping in the arms of the mother. Excavations in the rocks,
also serve them for dwellings, which affords them protection,
from both wind and rain; in these caves they mix without
discrimination, and if undisturbed enjoy the comforts of
sleep.</p>
<p>These people certainly, have fewer ideas of building any place
to shelter them from the weather than any savages ever
discovered, for those who build the bark huts, are very few
compared to the whole. Generally speaking, they prefer the ready
made habitations they find in the rocks, which perfectly accords
with the roving manner in which they live, for they never stay
long in one situation, and as they travel in tribes together,
even making the bark huts would engage them more time than they
would be happy on one spot.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>CHILDREN.</small></p>
<p><small>AMONG</small> the natives of this country, neither the
midwife, or man-mid wife, would find any employ, for females
receive no assistance, and women only are suffered to be present,
as the children are suffered to come into the world by the
efforts of nature, and it is by no means uncommon to see the
woman a few hours after her delivery walking about as usual. The
new born infant is carried about a short time by the mother on a
piece of bark, till it acquires strength enough to set on her
shoulders with its legs round her neck, and lay hold of her hair
to keep itself up. The children are named after some fish, bird,
or beast. At an early age they have the ornaments of the hair
added to them, as well as those of clay on the skin.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>JUVENILE SPORTS.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> sports of the native children are miniature
exhibitions of the exercisers of men, from an early age they
practise the throwing the spear and defending themselves from it;
and almost from eight years old till they realize the scene, they
amuse themselves with stealing the females, as their fathers have
formerly their mothers, and treating them little better. These
are the sports of the youths; but they are employed assisting in
fishing and the chase at an early age.</p>
<p>Children feel themselves capable of receiving an insult, for
even if at play a blow or push of greater force than seems
requisite is given, they return one of the same kind with an
equal spirit of retaliation as the men. The children have a
talent for mimicry, in which they take great delight; the air of
a soldier, the importance of an officer, the skulking way of lazy
convicts, indeed every thing that passes they mimic with great
exactness, and if they succeed in endeavouring to please, and
draw forth the smile of approbation, they laugh themselves
immoderately.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>DISPOSITIONS.</small></p>
<p><small>LAVATER</small> himself would undoubtedly have been at
a loss to assign, any general national character in a case like
the present, for the dispositions of these people are
paradoxical; they are brutal and generous, selfish and liberal,
revengeful and forgiving, jealous and unsuspecting, courageous
and cowardly, open and cunning; with all these powerful
oppositions it is hard to give any general idea of national
character, at least any of a favourable kind. Their partiality to
revenge by murder, must ever be detestable to refined nations, as
well as the cruel manner in which men behave to the women; yet
they have constancy to endure pain, and courage to fight either
singly or in the field. There is little reason to suspect they
were honest before we came among them, or if they were, they
(like too many others, when opportunity offers) soon became,
expert thieves.</p>
<p>No strangers to falsehood and its effects on the minds of
others, they endeavour to impress all they say as truth, by
earnestly wishing us to believe that all we hear from others is
false. They are not insusceptible of friendship or of sorrow, but
neither is lasting; even the love of themselves extends no
further than the present instant, they know not of tomorrow. They
eat and sleep, they awake and seek food, though it is not
uncommon to make the female sit in their canoe to catch fish
while they sleep: thus at once shewing their absolute power and
indolence.</p>
<p>The kind submissive way in which they behave, on meeting any
of our people armed, would make any stranger think himself among
his friends, but if he meets the same people, when without arms,
he is nearly sure of being killed.</p>
<p>They have some little knowledge of astronomy, but of the form
of the earth they have none; and the sun they imagine returns by
night from the journey of the day.</p>
<p>The respect they pay to old age, from whatever cause it may
arise, is a credit to them, and they carry this to a great height
if the object happens to be blind, for in that case nobody is
suffered to stand before him, and when rowed in a canoe, the
rower is obliged to sit behind him.</p>
<p>Taking them thus, "with all their imperfections on their
heads", we have a right to presume that when equally enlightened,
they may become equally possessed of those refined
qualifications, which at present, render Europeans their
superiors.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>DRESS.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> females at an early age wear a little
apron, made from the skin of the opossum, or kangaroo cut into
slips, and hanging a few inches from the waist; this they wear
till they grow up and are taken by men, and then they are left
off: this is truly savage. It is curious that those parents who
think any clothing decent for their children, should afterwards
suffer them to go in a state of nature by setting the example
themselves.</p>
<p>The men and women seldom wear any thing on them, and though
clothes have often been given them; they are always thrown
away.</p>
<p>Some few who are in the habit of being much among us, do now
tie a kind of bandage round the waist; but these are so few as by
no means to entitle them to be considered as any thing more than
a nation of nasty naked savages.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>PROPERTY.</small></p>
<p><small>THAT</small> happiness is obliged to result from
property, is by no means true, for few savages have less to call
their own, than those of New South Wales, and yet they are
perfectly happy; this arises from only seeking what is requisite
to satisfy nature, and any thing more they will not keep; thus
the property these people possess are their canoes, spears,
shields, clubs, hatchets, fish-gigs, and lines; but some have
informed us of hereditary property which they have retained
undisturbed. The Goat Island, (called by them Memel), close to
Sydney Cove, was said to be the property of Bennillong's father;
on our settling there he called it his, and took great pleasure
in being there with his wife.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>LANGUAGE.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> impossibility of giving any perfect idea of
a savage language induces me to abandon such an attempt, but as
many of the natives' words must of necessity be introduced, they
will be explained as they occur.</p>
<p>The language certainly affords to the ear in many cases an
agreeable harmony, and as they generally suit their "actions to
their words", they are more intelligible than might be expected,
it is however to be lamented, that in these endeavours to be
understood, they too often lay aside "the modesty of Nature", and
thus they disgust and please at the same instant.</p>
<p>The natives imitate any thing said by the English very
correctly, indeed so much so, that they have even sung songs
after our people, though on the contrary we do not find it an
easy task to imitate them.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>WEAPONS.</small></p>
<p><small>WEAPONS</small> for offensive and defensive warfare, as
well as for fishing and the chase, have at all times been found
with savages.</p>
<p>Spears, throwing sticks, fish-gigs, shields, and clubs are
their weapons.</p>
<p>Of the spear they have eight sorts, exclusive of fish-gigs,
for each of which they have a separate name, differing only for
the purpose of distinguishing the number of barbed points.</p>
<p>In the use of these, they are very expert, often hitting the
object they aim at, from a distance of 50, 60, and 70 feet.</p>
<p>The throwing stick, is used in discharging the spear. This
instrument is from 2 to 3 feet in length, with a shell on one
end, and a hook on the other.</p>
<p>They have two sorts of shields, one made of bark and the other
of solid wood.</p>
<p>Of clubs they have various sorts, some are very large and
long, which strike with such violence, as often to fracture the
skull, and always bring a woman to the ground.</p>
<p>The stone hatchet must by no means be forgot, as this has
proved the most dreadful to our people. The stone which forms the
head is fastened to the wooden handle with gum.</p>
<p>Their instruments are generally ornamented with carved work,
executed in the best stile they are capable of, and painted with
red and white clay in the same way, as they decorate their
persons.</p>

<p align="center">Burning the Dead</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>FUNERAL RITES.</small></p>
<p><small>AMONG</small> every class of human beings, death has a
serious effect on the mind, and every nation, either civilized or
savage, has a ceremony particularly solemn for the occasion;
whether this arises from the knowledge of revealed religion with
the enlightened, or from the finer feelings of a savage, who
knows that he can enjoy no future comforts, with a person he may
have been accustomed to live, it is equally entitled to our
respect, for it has an almost equal effect on the mind, and I am
confident, that the heart of a savage in New South Wales
generally feels an anguish on such occasions that would do
infinite credit to a polished European.</p>
<p>Those who die young, are consigned to the grave, but those who
have passed the middle age are burnt.</p>
<p>Previous to the body being either buried or burnt, it is
carried about in a canoe on mens' shoulders, preceded by others
who carry tufts of grass in their hands; the head of the corpse
is carried foremost, and when it passes any hut the deceased has
been accustomed to frequent, a child is taken up in the arms of a
man and presented towards the corpse as a mark of respect. When
the body reaches the place of interment, it is deposited in a
grave about six inches deep, strewed with grass and leaves; on
laying the corpse in the grave great care is taken to place it so
that the sun may look at it as he passes. The grave is then
covered in, and boughs and grass laid on the top, and over that
they lay a log of wood. Thus every rite performed, some of the
men lay an injunction on the women to prevent their eating any
fish or meat that day. During the whole ceremony, the name of the
deceased is never mentioned, and the night after, two natives sit
up to watch the grave.</p>
<p>And when the body is to be burnt, the ceremony is the same
till it reaches the grave, in which is laid twigs and brush-wood,
large logs being piled round it, about three feet high; some
grass is spread over the pile, the body is then put on it, with
its head to the North; logs of wood arc then placed over the
whole, which is instantly set fire to and consumed. The next day
the ashes are raked together, covered with mould, over which is
placed the bark of a tree.</p>
<p>They have a truly horrid accompaniment to these ceremonies,
when a mother leaves a young child, and no one can be found to
nurse and suckle it, which is, for the father, or nearest
relation, to place the child in the grave directly after the
mother, and dashing a large stone on the infant, the grave is
instantly covered up by the natives, and thus both are burnt
together. To this cause may be partly assigned the great want of
population among the natives. This cruel ceremony is however
never performed if any nurse can be found, or any person will
engage to become its father, though its real father is alive: a
man thus agreeing to become a father to the child, in case of the
mother's death, reminds me nearly of what we call godfathers,
only with this truly essential difference; that the savage
godfathers, as I shall call them, of New South Wales, really do
their duty, while the European godfathers, like greater savages,
let them, generally speaking, take their chance in the world.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>GOVERNMENT.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> natives live in a state of Nature and
acknowledge one authority. They are divided into families, and
the senior exacts compliance from the rest. This was soon
discovered after our arrival, for when we met a family unknown to
us the oldest advanced to speak to us, and to these old men they
apply the name of (Be-anna) or father, by which name they called
Governor Phillip, and all those, they saw our people pay
obedience to. When any of these elders came among us, it was
instantly wispered, with an eagerness which drew our attention,
and impressed on our minds an idea that we beheld some one of
consequence.</p>
<p>Each of the families into which the natives are divided, have
a nominal place of residence though they seldom stay long there
at one time, and from this is derived the tribes name.</p>
<p>The tribe of Cam-mer-ray, is the most powerful and numerous,
obliging the others to do as they like; they are more robust than
the others, and it is this tribe who are the operators in
extracting the tooth, from the natives.</p>
<p>All great contests are decided, when these persons of the
Cam-mer-ray tribe are present.</p>
<p>Yet all this respect, the other inhabitants pay to those of
Cam-mer-ray, seems to arise from their vast superiority of
numbers; and this is not the only part of the world where numbers
have gained power over few; but seldom are they like the
Cam-mer-ray tribe content, with the tribute of a single tooth
from each of the vanquished.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>RELIGION.</small></p>
<p><small>MOST</small> countries have a religion of some kind,
but the inhabitants of New South Wales have naturally none; they
have no object on their minds that impels them to good actions or
deters them from bad; they have a confused idea of a future
state, but it by no means affects their actions. Some think they
go over the great water, meaning the sea, when they die, and
others expect to go to the skies where they came from, and that
in the shape of little children, in which shape they will
reappear in this world at some future time. That they well know
the difference between right and wrong, as far as concerns this
world, is evident, for if any body does them an injury they
exclaim wee-re (bad); but if any person does them a service
bood-jer-re (good). This proves they not only understand a
difference, but have words to express it.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>DISEASES.</small></p>
<p><small>IN</small> all ages diseases have been the companions
of mortals, and the natives of New South Wales have their share;
most nations have their cures, and all attempt to cure the
maladies by which they suffer. A pain in the belly, they cured
formerly by breathing on the hand to warm it and applying it to
the part affected, singing a suitable song to the occasion, and
keeping the mouth near the affected part, frequently stopping to
blow on it, and making a noise, after blowing, like the barking
of a dog; but our settling there rendered this useless, as
tincture of rhubarb saves this trouble.</p>
<p>In 1789, a disorder in appearance like the small-pox, raged
with incredible violence. Some Gentlemen of the colony took a
native to the beach to find his former companions, and so much,
did his agony and expression affect them, that it will never be
effaced from their minds; with an anxious eve he searched round
every cove, no print of a human foot was to be seen on the sand;
the caves in the rocks were now the tombs of the dead, and not
one living soul was to be seen&mdash;all had flown&mdash;in the
silent agony of grief he lifted up his hands, and then exclaimed,
"all dead! all dead!" and in mournful sorrow again hung down his
head, nor did he lift it up again during the excursion. This poor
fellow at length suffered the fate of his companions, for on some
of the natives being brought to the Colony, he caught the disease
and died. With such violence did this disorder rage, that the
country seemed desolate, and one whole tribe of natives were
swept off except, three persons.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that though Sydney was full of children at
that time, and they visited those natives that were ill, not one
caught it.</p>
<p>Those on the coast have a disorder very much like the itch,
sometimes it is very general; in 1791, it raged so much that many
came to the colony in a shocking state, and every native seen,
had it with more or less violence.</p>
<p>The venereal disease, there is every reason to imagine they
were not ignorant of before they knew us, but if they were, our
arrival will account for its appearance shortly after, though
every care on the part of the Governor was taken to prevent it.
However an intercourse between the people soon took place, a
native, woman had a child by a white man; but perceiving the
child incline more to white, than the colour of her other
children, she held the little unfortunate over the fire in the
smoke, rubbing dirt and oil over its body, to give it the
wished-for hue.</p>
<p>When they have a pain in any part, they tie a ligature very
tight round the part, and thus stopping the circulation of the
blood, give ease to the part affected.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>SUPERSTITION.</small></p>
<p><small>THAT</small> these people should be superstitious must
be naturally expected; they are certainly superior to brutes, and
all those in the intermediate steps from ignorance to knowledge
must ever be so, and perhaps there are many who value their own
refined knowledge, that are not totally free from this weakness.
The Cam-mer-ray car-rah-dy (priest) who performed the operation
of producing the bone in the tooth-drawing ceremony, would alone
establish the fact, but others as strong can be produced.</p>
<p>A native who had been wounded by a spear met with one of these
conjurors before it was Well, who made him believe he had still
the barb in his side; however to shew his vast power, he
pretended to take out what was not there, and sent the poor
fellow away satisfied with his great importance.</p>
<p>One of the female natives who lived in the Colony had been out
and returned ill, though nothing seemed to be the matter with
her; but she said one of the Cam-mer-ray women had made water in
a path, she was obliged to come over, and this made her ill;
however it had such an effect on her weak mind that she did not
recover, though Mr. White kindly bled her in the arm; but the
disease which superstition caused was overcome by the same
weakness, which was effected by her being placed on the ground,
and a string tied round her head, the other end of the line was
taken by a girl, who rubbed her lips with it till they bled; this
she spit into some water on one side of her, while the poor girl
round whose head the string went, imagined; it came from her,
conveyed by the string.</p>
<p>They never broil fish at night, because they think the wind
will blow a contrary way to what they want it.</p>
<p>They will not whistle under a rock, having a tradition, that
some of the natives did, while feasting under one, and it fell
from a great height and crushed them to death.</p>
<p>After these it is hardly requisite to say, that they believe
in spirits. An apparition, they say, advances slowly, with its
hand in a line with its face, and seizes the person it intends to
visit by the throat.</p>
<p>The repository of the dead, and even the darkness of the night
are too powerful for their fears.</p>
<p>Those indeed who can encounter these seeming perils, are
esteemed proper persons to become Car-rah-dys.</p>
<p>The shooting of a star, and thunder and lightning they fear
much.</p>

<p align="center">Courtship</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>LOVE AND MARRIAGE.</small></p>
<p><small>THOSE</small> who delight in sentimental love tales,
will probably be disgusted with the male natives of New South
Wales, for their conduct to women renders them considerably
inferior to the brute creation; indeed nothing but having
promised to give a faithful account of all their customs, induces
me to state what I now find become my duty.</p>
<p>Strangers to the finer passions, they seek only the
gratification of their brutal desires, yet like other savages
they have customs peculiar to themselves on these occasions. In
obtaining a female partner the first step they take, romantic as
it may seem, is to fix on some female of a tribe at enmity with
their own, this done, the lover, as we must now esteem him, seeks
to find his intended unprotected by her friends, when he steals
upon the unsuspecting woman. The monster then stupefies her with
blows, which he inflicts with his club, on her head, back, neck,
and indeed every part of her body, then snatching up one of her
arms, he drags her, streaming with blood from her wounds, through
the woods, over stones, rocks, hills, and logs, with all the
violence and determination of a savage, till he reaches his
tribe, when a scene takes place with the relation of which, I
shall neither stain my pages, or offend the reader. The woman
thus violated becomes the wife of the ravisher, and is admitted
into her husband's tribe.</p>
<p>The tribe of the female, by the favourite plan of retaliation,
redress this outrage, but the female herself seems contented, and
seldom, leaves her husband or his tribe for another.</p>
<p>The women are kept in the greatest subjection by the men. If a
tribe is travelling and meets any of our people, the women are
made to retire to a distance, from which they are not suffered to
advance till ordered; and on any occasion the slightest offence
given to the husband is punished with the blow of the club, which
never fails to cause a stream of blood, and very often a
fractured skull: yet this inhuman practice appears rather to
strengthen the wife's attachment than weaken it, and the very
wounds are shewn as marks of honour.</p>
<p>In some very few cases, the wives return this usage, and after
such an engagement they live together the same as before. The
analogy there is between savages and the lower classes of people
in all countries, is here too obvious to escape attention.</p>
<p>The men do not confine themselves to one wife, but the women
revenge this by retaliation, and often by murder.</p>
<p>That the females are not devoid of art, the following anecdote
will form a pleasing illustration: A female fell in love with the
great coat of the Governor, and used a variety of means to obtain
it; she first danced, playing many antic tricks; this not
effecting it, she attacked the Governor with tears, and this
failing, she ceased and then became as merry as any around
her.</p>
<p>Though chastity is not one of the virtues they boast, there
are some few who seem ashamed to be naked before us; though when
among the natives they are indifferent in this respect.</p>
<p>That even genuine love in all its native purity has been
discovered among them, the reader will be convinced by the
following little narrative, which happened in the neighbourhood
of Paramatta, and I am well acquainted with the young man, who
belonged to a tribe near Paramatta, he was about twenty three
years old, had two sisters, one about twenty and the other only
fourteen. One day when he returned from hunting the kangaroo, his
sisters did not meet him as usual on his approach to the cave, so
imagining they were gone to procure water or roots, he without
going in, being fatigued, sat down at the foot of a tree to wait
their return. The sun was now withdrawing itself, and the dark
mantle of night with rapid strides began to cover the horizon;
now the vivid lightning with its forked forms bespoke the
impending storm; in a few moments the rain poured rapidly clown
and drove my hero from the foot of the tree to his cave, but
scarce had he reached it before another flash of lightning shewed
to his distressed eyes the form of his youngest sister bleeding
on the ground; troubled as he was before at the warring of the
elements, his agony was now increased ten-fold; kneeling down he
endeavoured to make her rise; but alas! she was incapable of
hearing him, for she was senseless: discovering this he hastened
to procure, a little water, and as he washed her face with it she
returned to life.&mdash;"Oh! my dear brother, cried she, our
sister is torn from us, and I narrowly escaped being murdered for
trying to prevent it; the wretch after beating her with his club,
caught up one arm to drag her out of our cave, and I laid hold of
the other to detain her, but the instant the brute saw this, with
one blow of his club he knocked me to the ground, where you have
now found me." As she ended this narrative the tears run down her
cheeks, and her brother could not refrain accompanying her,
meditating revenge, and planning its execution; they passed the
night in melancholy conversation, and soon as the returning sun
enabled them, they sought together the tribe of the offender.
After a journey quickened by haste to revenge, they reached the
neighbourhood of the tribe they sought; when at a little
distance, he saw the sister of the very savage who had stolen his
sister, she was leaving her tribe to pick up some sticks for a
fire; (this was indeed a fine opportunity for revenge) so making
his sister hide herself, he flew to the young woman and lifted up
his club to bring her to the ground, and thus satisfy his
revenge. The victim trembled, yet knowing his power she stood
with all the fortitude she could, lifting up her eyes they, came
in contact with his, and such was the enchanting beauty of her
form that he stood an instant motionless to gaze on it. The poor
thing saw this, and dropped on her knees to implore his pity, but
before she could speak, his revenge softened into love; he threw
down his club, and clasping her in his arms vowed eternal
constancy; his pity gained her love, thus each procured a mutual
return. Then calling his sister, she would have executed her
revenge, but for her brother; who told her she was now his wife.
On my hero asking after his sister, his new wife said she was
very ill but would soon be better; and she excused her brother
because the means he had taken were the customary ones of
procuring a wife: "but you", said she, "have more white heart,
(meaning he was more like the English) you no beat me; me love
you; you love me; me love your sisters; your sisters love me; my
brother no good man." This artless address won both their hearts,
and now all three live in one hut, which I enabled them to make
comfortable, within half a mile of my own house. I have taught
all three to read decently, and hope they will continue to
cherish those seeds of virtue I have laboured to impress on their
minds.</p>
<p>This little anecdote I have given as the young man related it
to me; it affected me much, and perhaps I have lost much of the
simplicity.</p>
<p>The females of New South Wales are in many cases found to be
at the head of the quarrels, and in these they mix with the men
and do their part in the battle, indeed on some settled contests
the women begin the affray. It is to this fondness for masculine
avocations, that must be attributed the many quarrels which
continually happen among them.</p>

<p><small>TO</small> carry into effect the sentences of Criminal
Courts, which assigns to convicted guilt, a temporary or total
exile from the country whose laws it violates, the English
Government deemed New South Wales a proper spot to found a
Colonial Establishment for the purpose.</p>
<p><b>1786-7.]</b></p>
<p>In the year 1786, the Commissioners of the Navy contracted for
a number of vessels to convey convicts to Botany Bay. The ships
for the transports were properly fitted up, and the store ships
had provisions for two years, and tools of every description put
on board.</p>
<p>Capt. Arthur Phillip hoisted a pendant on board the Sirius of
20 guns, 520 tons burden, lying at Deptford, on the 24th of
October, John Hunter Esq. was appointed as a Second Captain to
her, for as Capt. Phillip was to hold the high office of Governor
over the intended Colony, a Second Captain was requisite to
command her in his absence. As the Sirius was going on particular
service she was not confined in her establishment, having 2
captains, 3 lieutenants, a master, purser, surgeon and two mates,
a boatswain, gunner, and a detachment of marines The Supply brig
was commissioned as an armed tender, commanded by Lieutenant
Henry Lidgbird Ball. The Sirius with this ship completed their
equipment, and droped down from Deptford to Long Reach, on the
10th of December, and there took in powder, guns, and other
stores. Some transports here joined them, and on the 30th of
January, 1787, on the arrival of orders, they sailed for
Spithead, but owing to foul weather did not reach it till the
latter end of February. On the 5th of March the orders for
embarkation arrived, and then to join the other ships at
Mother-bank, after taking the convicts and troops on board. On
the 7th of March, Capt. Phillip came to command his fleet, at the
Mother-bank, wishing to lose no time as the wind now served. The
signal for sailing was made on Thursday the 10th; some of the men
wishing to be paid up to the time of their sailing, demurred to
proceed, so that Captain Phillip ordered such as refused to be
put on board the Hy&aelig;na frigate, and to have in exchange the
same number of her crew, and as she was to accompany the fleet to
a given distance, they might be re-exchanged. This obstacle being
removed, and the crews of the Sirius and Supply having received
the usual two months advance of wages, the men of war and some
transports got under sail to drop clown to St. Helen's and
proceed to sea, but were unable to pass through the needles till
the next morning.</p>
<p>The following are the vessels names, their tonnage, and the
number of persons they had on board destined for the Colony;</p>

<p>and the Sirius had on board the Major Commandant of the
Marines, who was Lieutenant-Governor of the Colony, the Adjutant
and Quarter-Master, the Judge-Advocate, Capt. Collins, and the
Commissary; with 1 serjeant, 3 drummers, 7 privates, 4 women, and
a few artificers.</p>
<p>All the transports as well as the ships of war, were stored in
every part with provisions, implements of agriculture, clothing
for the convicts, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>To prevent any separation, Capt. Phillip established day and
night signals, and he allowed the Masters, to suffer a number of
convicts to come upon deck in the day time, for the preservation
of their health. The Lady Penrhyn and the Charlotte proved heavy
sailors, but to prevent a separation, the Sirius shortened sail
every evening, and during the night carried a light in the
main-top. On the 15th they found five persons were left behind,
to supply which loss as many men came from the Hy&aelig;na. On
the 16th they cleared the Channel. Four days had not expired from
leaving the Channel, when a mutiny was discovered, by one of the
convicts. Capt. Phillip ordered the two principles to be brought
on board the Sirius, where they had two dozen lashes each. The
Hy&aelig;na was now sent off with letters for England, but the
five men lent for those left behind, chose rather to proceed with
the fleet than return. On the 24th they made the latitude of Cape
Ortugal. The Supply was now ordered to keep six miles a head in
the day, and two during the night, as they expected to see land
the next day, which proved the case, as early next morning the
signal to that effect was made by her, and at noon they were by
the rocks called the Deserters; and on the 31st off the Canary
Islands, distant about three leagues from Madeira. On the 3d of
June they saw the Island of Teneriffe ahead, and at seven in the
evening the fleet came to an anchor in the road of Santa Cruz.
While we lay here, one Powers, a convict, made his escape from
the Alexander in a small boat; he was however retaken and kept in
irons. Having finished getting provisions and water, on the 10th
the fleet got under weigh, on the 15th they crossed the Tropic of
Cancer with a steady wind. On the 14th of July the fleet crossed
the Equator, in the 26th degree of East Longitude; and only two
accidents happened in their passage to the Brazils, a seaman fell
overboard and was drowned, and a female convict was killed by a
boat falling off the booms. On the 2d of August the Coast of
South America was in sight, and on the 4th they anchored within
the Islands at the entrance of the harbour of Rio de Janeiro. The
passage from Teneriffe, though a long one, was attended with no
disease. During their stay here the convicts had an allowance of
rice, oranges, and vegetables, and every care was taken to enable
them to withstand the scurvy; and during the whole passage the
Rev. Mr. Johnson performed duty every Sunday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the 4th of September, the Harbour-master took
charge of the Sirius over the bar, from this to Friday, the 14th,
the wind blew hard, when it became calm till the 16th, and then
it again sprung up, but by the Lady Penrhyn and other transports
inattention to signals we could not make sail in time. On the
19th a convict was drowned by falling overboard. On the 4th of
October thirty convicts were reported to be ill, some of them
dangerously. Four seamen from the Alexander, were sent on board
the Sirius, for having entered into a combination to release some
of the convicts, while the ship should be at the Cape of Good
Hope. On the 13th, the fleet came to anchor in Table Bay; on the
15th Governor Phillip, and the principal Officers went on shore,
to pay their respects to the Governor of the Cape of Good Hope,
and to request those stores, seeds, &amp;c. requisite. While the
fleet lay here the carpenters prepared as many stalls for the
reception of cattle as room could be found for, and on the 8th of
November, 3 mares, 3 colts, 1 stallion, 7 cows, 1 bull, 1
bull-calf, with a good assortment of sows, boars, goats, ewes,
and rams, &amp;c. were received on board the various ships as
live-stock for the Colony. During this long stay the whole fleet
had the benefit of fresh provisions and vegetables. Every article
wanted being now procured, on the 12th, by signal, they all
weighed anchor.</p>
<p><b>1788.]</b></p>
<p>For some time after they left the Cape the wind blew fresh.
Capt. Phillip on the 16th made known his intention of leaving the
fleet, and going forward in the Supply, that he might arrive in
time to fix on, and clear, a proper spot for the settlement,
previous to the arrival of the remainder of the fleet. In
consequence of this determination, on the 25th Capt. Phillip went
on board the Sirius, and with the Alexander, Scarborough, and
Friendship transports quitted the fleet. On the 4th of January,
1788, the Sirius made preparations for falling in with land. On
Monday, the 7th, about ten in the forenoon, the fleet was 17
leagues from the South Cape of New Holland, and at five minutes
past two the signal for seeing land was made. The Mewston and
Swilly Rocks soon became visible, and the fleet with fair weather
stood along shore, distant only about three miles from New
Holland. The Land now appeared high, rocky, and barren. Over the
South Cape it seemed woody, the coast was irregular, with low
points forming creeks and bays. The Golden Grove in the night of
the 9th shipped a sea, with a confused heavy swell, though it was
a calm at the time, which circumstance has occurred to other
ships in nearly the same situation. On the following day, at two
o'clock, a squall took the Sirius, arid did her considerable
damage; the slowness of their progress along the coast made it
the 19th before they reached the Red Point. In the evening they
saw the entrance into Botany Bay, but too late for the transports
to enter that night. In the course of the night the whole fleet
was carried Southward as far as a clump of trees called
Post-Down-Clump; but as a breezy sprung up, they soon regained
the lost distance, and at ten minutes before eight in the
morning, the Sirius came to an anchor in Botany Bay, and by nine
o'clock all the transports were safe in.</p>
<p>This voyage, on the termination of which many doubts must have
arisen in the onset, was providentially compleated in eight
months and a week, during which time, the fleet sailed 5021
leagues, and at length rested, only a few days sail from the
antipodes of their native country, and during the whole passage
only 32 had died, though many were sickly on leaving England. But
the good quality of the provisions, aided by the refreshments
they received at Rio de Janeiro and the Cape of Good Hope,
rendered the fleet healthy.</p>
<p>On the Sirius anchoring, Captain Hunter was informed that the
Supply only arrived two days previous to the fleet; and the
transports which sailed with the Supply only the day before.
Governor Phillip had not lost an instant from the time he
arrived, in searching for a proper spot to found the settlement;
but to all he had yet seen there were many objections; indeed, a
place could hardly be found big enough for all to sit down. The
shore round Point Sutherland was good, but there no fresh water
could be found except what came from a marsh. Port Jackson and
Broken Bay were now to be examined, for which purpose the
Governor with Capt. Hunter, Captain Collins (the Judge-Advocate,)
a Lieutenant, the Master of the Sirius, and a few marines,
embarked in 3 boats. The Governor leaving orders for clearing the
ground at Point Sutherland in his absence. These 3 boats
presently drew the attention of the natives, who as they went
along the coast, shouted "warre, warre, warre",(that is "go away,
go away, go away"), though, those about Botany Bay by no means
looked on them, as enemies either of their country or themselves.
The coast round Port Jackson promised little, but disappointed
them, by soon shewing, a fine harbour capable of affording ample
security for a large fleet. On one of the coves of this, it was
resolved to fix the Colony, and having examined it, the Governor
and his party returned to Botany Bay.</p>
<p>Lieut. King, in the absence of the Governor, found nothing to
induce the latter, to alter the determination he had made to fix
at Port Jackson, and the removal would have taken place the next
morning, had not two strange sail appeared about day light; these
surprized us, till we ascertained they were the Boussole and
Astrolabe, on their return from a voyage of discovery from
France, under M. de la Perouse. As Capt. Hunter was working the
Sirius out of Botany Bay as M. de la Perouse entered, they had
hardly time to speak. Governor Phillip, with a party of
artificers taken from the convicts and seamen of the Sirius, and
a few marines, arrived at Port Jackson on the 25th, and on the
next day, ground enough was cleared to encamp the Governor's
guard. The convicts landed that morning near a stream of fresh
water, at the head of a cove. On this first inhabited spot, from
that time tranquillity ceased, and the foundation of a new
country usurped the seat of silence. The whole party that had
arrived, were assembled this evening on the point, where they
landed, on which was erected a flagstaff, the Union-Jack was
displayed, and the marines fired several vollies; between these,
the healths of the Royal Family, and success to the New Colony,
were drank by the Governor and Officers, and to conclude the
evening, the Sirius and convoy, arrived from Botany Bay. Thus
closed the voyage to New South Wales, with all the good fortune
that could be wished, and with considerably more than might
reasonably be expected. Next day the disembarkment commenced, and
continued till all the convicts and troops were landed. The
confusion that must take place on such an occasion, is hardly to
be described, for literally speaking, every man stepped out of a
boat into a wood; various parties were variously employed, few
were seen, but most heard; some clearing ground, some pitching
tents, others bringing up stores, in short, confusion was the
order of the day; but as the woods were felled, and ground
cleared, the encampments regularly extended, the whole bore
something like form. The Governor's house, which was made of
canvass, and brought over on purpose, was put up on the East side
of Sydney Cove, and a small body of convicts were placed in tents
near it. The marines were placed at the head of the cove, and on
the West side the main body of convicts. The women disembarked on
the 6th of February, when every person belonging to the
settlement landed. Tents were provided for the sick, which number
we found with concern increase; the scurvy and dissentry now
broke out and several died. Wild celery, spinage, and parsley
grew about the settlement, which all were glad to use in their
messes. The live-stock was landed, on the East point of the cove,
when having cropped the pasturage, they were removed, to the head
of the adjoining cove, which was cleared for a farm, to be under
the direction of a person, the Governor brought out.</p>
<p>His Excellency ordered some ground on the East side of his
house, to be cleared for the purpose of receiving the plants,
&amp;c. from Rio-de-Janeiro and the Cape of Good Hope. They were
then brought on shore, and in a short time every eye was
gratified with seeing the fig, orange, pear, grape, and apple
take root in New South Wales.</p>
<p>The Governor ordered his Majesty's commission, which appointed
him to be, his "Captain General and Governor in Chief, in and
over the Territory of New South Wales and its Dependencies", to
be read in public, together with the Letters Patent for
establishing Civil and Criminal Courts in the territory, which
was now found to extend from Cape York, the extremity of the
coast to the North, in the latitude of 20&deg;. 37'. South, to
the South Cape, the Southern extremity of the coast, in the
latitude of 43&deg;. 39'. South, and inland to the Westward as
far as 135&deg;. of East longitude, comprehending all the islands
adjacent, in the Pacific Ocean within the latitude of the before
mentioned Capes.</p>
<p>The ceremony of reading these instruments was performed, with
great dignity, by Captain Collins, the Judge-Advocate, after
which the Governor addressed himself to the convicts, and assured
them, that he should ever be ready to encourage those who might
deserve it; but, on the contrary, those who acted in opposition
to propriety, would inevitably meet the punishment they deserved;
nor did he close without shewing them, how much it was both their
duty and interest, to forget the ways in which they had lived,
and to become good, honest, and industrious members of the
community. At the end of his affectionate address three vollies
were fired, after which he received the honours due to his rank
on the parade, and entertained all the officers and gentlemen of
the settlement under a tent pitched on purpose.</p>
<p>On mustering the convicts in the morning, nine were found
absent, for notwithstanding every care that could be taken, so
ignorant were they, that fearless of danger, some of them
intreated, but in vain, to be taken on board the French ships in
Botany Bay. For want of proper persons being sent out to act as
overseers, the convicts could not be kept to work, as those who
overlooked them, were only such convicts as behaved well on the
voyage, so that having participated in the vices of others, they
had neither inclination or power to exact obedient conduct.
Thefts now began to be discovered, and many tools secreted; these
evils resulted in a great measure, from the sailors bringing
spirits on shore, which even punishment could not prevent. The
Criminal Court, was assembled on the 11th of February, for the
trial of prisoners. One for an assault, was sentenced to have 150
lashes; the next for robbing another convict of biscuit, was to
be confined on a rocky island for a week, on bread and water; and
the third, for stealing a plank, was sentenced to receive 50
lashes, but was pardoned.</p>
<p>It is too frequently found that mercy is abused, and that a
merciful judge encreases the number of criminals; this was
shortly exemplified, for in less than a month four more were
tried for a still greater offence, which was robbing the store of
provisions; thus at once destroying the support of the whole, and
at the very time when the officer and the convict had the same
allowance of provisions. The charge being proved, one man, James
Barrett, suffered death, his confederates were banished, and one
sentenced to have 300 lashes was pardoned, and one who was tried
the next day was pardoned on condition of becoming executioner to
the colony.</p>
<p>The Letters Patent, authorized proceeding in a more summary
way than in the realms of Great Britain. The Criminal Court was
to consist of the Judge-Advocate, and six Officers of the Sea or
Land Service, and to hear, determine and punish all offences
committed in the Colony, according to the laws of England. The
charges to be exhibited in writing by the Judge-Advocate, and
witnesses to be examined on oath, both for and against the
prisoner, and the court to adjudge whether guilty or not, by a
majority; but in cases of death there must be five concur in the
opinion of his guilt, and the sentences so pronounced to have the
effect of a verdict from a Jury, and the Provost Martial to cause
the judgment of the Court to be executed according to the
Governor's warrant.</p>
<p>The Civil Court consists of the Judge-Advocate and two
inhabitants of the settlement, appointed by the Governor, which
Court hears and decides all pleas of lands, houses, debts, and
contracts, and all personal pleas, with power to summon the
parties, to examine such complaint by witnesses on oath, and
issue execution under the hand of the Judge-Advocate, and any
body aggrieved may appeal to the Governor, and if the amount
exceeds 300<i>l</i>. to the King himself in Council. This Court
has likewise a power to grant probates of wills and
administration of personal estates acquired in the country.</p>
<p>The Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Judge-Advocate are
constituted Justices of the Peace, and the Governor is empowered
to make such other persons Justices of the Peace as he may think
proper.</p>
<p>Augustus Alt, Esq. Surveyor General, was the first sworn into
this office, to sit with the Judge-Advocate and determine on, and
punish such causes as were of two little importance to bring
before a Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Besides the other powers of the Governor, he was Vice-Admiral
of the territory, and could assemble Courts Martial, and confirm
and set aside sentences. Capt. Collins, the Judge-Advocate to the
Settlement, had also a warrant giving him the same important
office to the marine detachment.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant Governor is Judge of the Vice-Admiralty Court,
for the trial of offences committed on the High Seas.</p>
<p>Thus, effectual means were provided to punish offenders, and
as the various Courts could be assembled when wanted, that loss
of time and labour was saved, which would otherwise have taken
place.</p>
<p>The allowance of provisions was now the following weekly
ration, to each male 7lbs. of biscuit, 1lb. of flour, 7lbs. of
beef or 4lbs. of pork, 3 pints of pease, and 6 ounces of butter;
and two thirds of this quantity to the female convicts, which
ought certainly to have afforded of itself perfect security to
the store: but the Government had to deal with those who no
consequences, would deter from the commission of crimes, and who
no reward could induce to do right.</p>
<p>As the safety of the stores, constituted the preservation of
the colony, ground was cleared and houses began to hold them.
This was done by the convicts, and as a temptation to work they
had a quantity set them, which done, they were allowed time to
collect materials to build huts for themselves, but this few
profited by, prefering idleness, and many thinking to escape if
they could get on board, daily visited the ships of the French in
Botany Bay; but M. de la Perouse gave no countenance to their
requests, but threatened to drive them away by force.</p>
<p>In February the Supply sailed from Port Jackson, as the
Governor was instructed, for the purpose of growing flax, to form
a settlement at Norfolk Island, on which expedition he sent
Lieut. King, first making him a Justice of the Peace, as
Commandant, a surgeon, a petty officer, two soldiers, nine male
and six female convicts, and two persons who boasted a knowledge
of the flax dressing business. They had likewise tools, farming
implements, and provisions for six months. The situation of
Norfolk Island is in latitude of 29&deg;. South, and in longitude
160&deg;. 10'. East of Greenwich.</p>
<p>Lieut. Dawes, of the Marines, was by the Board of Longitude
ordered to make observations in New South Wales, for which
purpose the Board sent out proper instruments, and shortly after
their arrival an observatory was begun, under this Gentleman's
direction. On a survey of the harbour being made by Captain
Hunter, it was found to exceed the extent imagined to the
Westward, and the country was found to be even better there than
near the settlement, During this survey Capt. Hunter saw many of
the natives, who left him in a friendly way, as he treated them
with his usual cheerful manners.</p>
<p>Least the loose way in which the natives left their spears,
fish-gigs, and other little property about, should tempt the
convicts or others to make free with any thing, the Governor
strictly ordered no one to take them, as it was his earnest wish,
and constant endeavour to keep up a friendly intercourse with
them. During the first six weeks of our residence, we received a
visit from only two natives, who came and staid a short time,
every thing they saw they admired, and on giving each a hatchet,
we found they understood the use of it.</p>
<p>It is to be lamented that the orders of the Governor had
little effect, for the convicts lost no opportunity of taking all
they could find from the natives, which made them resist an
attempt a boat's crew made to land in one of the coves, and
shortly after a few landed on Garden Island, where a garden was
making, and watching their opportunity, ran away with the tools
of our men, who then fired at them, and hitting one with small
shot, the axe was dropped, but with the rest they escaped. M. de
la Perouse likewise was obliged to fire on the natives, for
annoying his people while on shore. These circumstances
attributed to the termination of that intercourse Governor
Phillip was so desirous to cultivate.</p>
<p>Several couples signified their wish to marry, and they were
never refused, unless proof was given that either had a husband
or wife living on leaving England, and some expecting to have
received a portion of liberty for marrying, finding themselves
disappointed, wished to be restored to their former state.</p>
<p>Important as the business was in which the whole colony was
engaged, divine service was regularly performed on Sundays, all
the convicts attending, and a detachment of marines with their
arms; and it was with pleasure observed, that all behaved with
the greatest attention and respect.</p>
<p>[The following inserted into 2nd Edition]</p>
<blockquote>[A New South Wales Almanack, for the year 1811, has
been published in that settlement, containing, among other
matters, lists of the civil and military establishments. A pearl
fishery has also been discovered by Captain Campbell, and is
situated to the Eastward of Otaheite. The pearl oyster shells are
worth in this country about &pound;140 per ton; and in China they
bring 20 dollars a pickel (133 lbs.) The natives dive for them,
and generally obtain five tons daily.<br>
<br>
Capt. Campbell formerly commanded the Harrington brig, which
traded to the East Indies, and was taken possession of by some
convicts, and carried out of Port Jackson. By this seizure he
sustained a loss of &pound;4000.<br>
<br>
Great improvements have taken place since the accession of Col.
Macquarrie to the government. The large town of Sydney is now
planned and laid out in regular streets, and divided into
districts, with head-boroughs, sub-constables, watchmen, &amp;c.
Mr. D'Arcy Wentworth has been appointed the head of the police.
Five townships have been laid out on the Hawkesbury and George
Rivers, to be called Windsor, Richmond, Wilberforce, Pitt, and
Castlereagh. The roads from Sydney to Paramatta and Hawkesbury,
which were scarcely passable, have been repaired, bridges thrown
over the small streams, and turnpikes established. No fears of a
scarcity of provisions were to be apprehended, vast quantities of
cattle being reared, and the store-houses being filled with
grain. Butchers' meat was from 1s. to 1s. 3d. per lb. and the
supply of the colony equal to its consumption, without assistance
from the mother country. Wool was likely to be their first staple
of commerce. Settlers of good character were furnished with
live-stock from the government stores, on consideration of paying
the value, in money or grain, in 18 months. The population of
Sydney is estimated at 10,000 souls, of which number 8,000 have
been sent from England as convicts. Governor Macquarrie was
indefatigable in reforming public morals, both by example and
precept, and in checking drunkenness, concubinage, and other
vices which were too prevalent.<br>
<br>
A singular advantage to the Colony is the introduction of
cotton-trees, by a French emigrant Colonel, named De la Clampe,
who, having fled to England during the revolution, was permitted
by Government to go out to the Colony. When M. Peron visited the
settlement, he says, "Of all which De la Clampe pointed out,
nothing so forcibly excited my attention as a beautiful
plantation of cotton, and cocoa-trees, in a very flourishing
condition. M. de la Clampe assured me, that by a series of
tedious and very nice experiments, he had succeeded in raising
cotton-trees, yielding cotton of various shades, and especially
that peculiar to the fine nankeens of China, a fast colour
hitherto not obtained, whether by dint of culture or by dyeing.
'Either I am much mistaken,' said the Colonel, 'or in a short
time I shall have created two branches of commerce and
exportation for this Colony of the greatest value:&mdash;I have
but this means left of acquitting the sacred debt I owe to a
nation which gave me shelter in the hour of misfortune; and I am
the more impatient for the moment which will enable me to satisfy
this first desire of my heart, as a testimony of gratitude like
this will best agree with my sentiments of delicacy and
patriotism.'"]</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p><small>IN</small> the beginning of February, the Colony
suffered great inconvenience from the rain, and on the 6th, 2
lambs, 6 sheep, and a pig, were destroyed by lightning, at the
foot of a tree. In the beginning of March, the Governor took an
excursion for a few days, under the idea of finding several spots
of good land, near Broken Bay, but without success. The weather
became now equally averse to labour and health, the sick list
amounted to 200; for the reception of these a building was
erected, one ward for the troops, and a second for the convicts.
Barracks likewise were began for the detachment, but all building
was retarded, by the bad quality of the wood, which was both
shakey and rotten.</p>
<p>The French now departed from Botany Bay, but previous to their
sailing buried the Abbe Le Receveur, not far from where their
tents were erected, and on the tree at the foot of which he was
laid, were nailed two pieces of board, with the following
inscription:</p>
<p align="center">Hic jacet<br>
L. Receveur<br>
Ex F. F. Minoribus<br>
Galli&aelig; Sacerdos.<br>
Physicus in Circumnavigatione Mundi<br>
Duce D. de la Perouse,<br>
Obit Die 17 Feb<sup><small>r</small></sup>. Anno<br>
1788.</p>
<p>When these boards fell down, Governor Phillip had the
inscription engraved on copper, and put in the same place. A
wharf was now began, for landing goods, and the ordnance, which
consisted of two brass six pounders on travelling carriages, four
iron twelve pounders, and two iron six pounders, were brought on
shore. The transports which Mere chartered for China began to
clear. A gang of convicts were employed about the head of Long
Cove to make bricks, near which two acres of ground were cleared
for such officers, as wished to raise grain for their stock, as
no grants of land were to be made, until an account of the
country had been taken. That necessity which obliged them to
suffer the live-stock to range about the tents, was the cause of
great inconvenience, for the hogs in particular made way into
them, and destroyed every thing they met with. These damages were
at first made good from the store, but, that opening the door to
impositions, an order was given, to kill any hog caught so
trespassing. The main street for a town was marked out of
extensive dimensions.</p>
<p>The Supply returned from Norfolk Island on the 19th, after an
absence of 4 weeks and 6 days. She reached the island on the 29th
of last month, but in consequence of the great surf they could
not land till the 5th day after, and then could not pitch a tent
till they had cleared the ground. The bay he landed in, and fixed
the settlement, he called Sydney Bay, and the two small islands
at a little distance, he named Phillip and Nepean. The soil at
Norfolk Island was very rich, but the landing dangerous at Sydney
Bay, as it is exposed to Southerly winds. The flax plant, which
was the object of this expedition, and which Capt. Cook remarked
to grow spontaneously, had not been discovered by Lieut. King
when the Supply sailed. Lieut. Ball after he left this harbour,
soon discovered an uninhabited island, smaller than Norfolk
Island, abounding with turtle and fowls, which were so tame that
some of the crew approached near enough to knock them down with
sticks, this place Lieut. Ball called Lord Howe Island. The pines
on Norfolk Island grow to an immense size, one measured nine feet
round, and another 180 feet in length. The Scarborough,
Charlotte, and Lady Penrhyn transports were cleared and
discharged. Several of the convicts came in from the woods
wounded by the natives. One of the wounded had been employed
cutting rushes for thatching, and another who was not well, had
been collecting vegetables. All our people denied giving any
cause, but as they well knew the consequence that would result
from offending the natives, there could be no wonder that they
denied it, for the Governor had made known, that any one, giving
them offence, should be subjected to a prosecution. There can be
no doubt but our people gave the first offence, for the Governor
on his return from his excursion about Broken Bay, found the
natives very shy, instead of coming to him with that confidence
with which he had formerly inspired them with. At length one came
to him, and informed him by signs, that he had been beaten by
some of our people, this and their running away, were
strong-proofs of the truth, added to which 11 canoes full of
natives, passed the Sirius, and on our boats going near them,
they paddled off. The water, that had supplied the settlement,
was found to be only a drain from a swamp, it was therefore
requisite to let it remain without cutting the wood round it.
April now commenced, and the winter was approaching, every hand
was put on the buildings, even the ships' crews helped, except
those who brought the cabbage trees, to assist in making huts, a
row of which were began on the West side for the female convicts.
Distress was now very universal owing to the scurvy. A woman
convict was accused with stealing an iron, which was found on
her, being left alone she hung herself, but was discovered and
cut down in time to save her life.</p>
<p>Thefts continued to be continually committed, but they became
fewer, as the Governor assured the convicts that instant
punishment should attend all future convictions; and had the
sailors not continued to bring spirits on shore, their conduct as
well as the convicts would have been more to be commended.</p>
<p>The venereal disease was discovered among the convicts, which
made the Governor order, that any person having it and concealing
it, should receive corporal punishment, and have short allowance
of provisions for six months. The ordnance of the colony was now
placed under the direction of Lieut. Dawes, and a redoubt was
began by him. In the course of this month the stock of sheep
suffered much by the dogs of the natives, at one part 5 ewes: and
a lamb, were destroyed.</p>
<p>May, like every other month in the infancy of the Colony, was
marked by crimes, a youth of 17, James Bennett, was tried and
convicted for breaking open a tent, and stealing above the amount
of 5s. he confessed many crimes after conviction for this, and to
idleness and bad company attributed his ruin. With a view to make
a deeper impression on others, he was instantly executed. On the
5th, 6th, and 7th of this month a transport sailed for China. On
the 8th, likewise, sailed the Supply for Lord Howe Island, in
quest of fowl and turtle, as a change of diet was thought the
best means of resisting the rapid progress of the scurvy.</p>
<p>The Governor wishing to ascertain the state of the live-stock,
desired a general return; the amount of which was,</p>

<blockquote>[But in 1812 we find the stock so much improved, that
the following was an average of the price of provisions at Sydney
for several months: Wheaten bread 12&frac12; d; India corn bread,
5&frac12; d. per loaf; beef, 1s. 4d. and mutton and pork, 1s. 6d.
per lb.; potatoes, 16s. per cwt.; fowls, 2s. 6d. each; eggs, 3s.
per dozen. Jamaica rum and Hollands gin, each 27s. per gallon,

the lowest calculation, at 20,000 souls.]</blockquote>
<p>A bricklayer, being discovered among the convicts, a number of
men were put under him to build brick huts. On the 15th, a stone
house was began for the Governor. In the course of this month the
store house was completed and a road to the wharf. On the 21st,
in the evening, a convict was brought to the hospital, dreadfully
wounded by some natives with a barbed spear, which entered
between his shoulders, and went three inches deep into his back.
He said, that while in a cove at some distance, he was suddenly
wounded by a spear, when his companion ran away, and that the
natives then came and stripped him of his clothes, but did not
take them away. In a few days the other man's clothes were
brought in, torn with spears, and covered with blood, leaving no
room to doubt of his fate. On the 25th the Supply returned from
Norfolk Island, being unable to procure any turtle; but while
absent, they saw a rock which Lieut. Ball, from its shape, called
Ball Pyramid. A soldier and sailor were tried on the 26th for
assaulting and wounding James M'Neal, a seaman belonging to the
Sirius. This happened on Garden Island, they all three lived in
one hut, and having received their week's spirits they got drunk
and quarreled. The assault being proved, each received 500
lashes. The 30th of this month, the bodies of two convicts were
brought in, the head of one was beaten to a jelly, and the bodies
of both had many marks of spears. It was found on inquiry, that
these men had stolen a canoe from the natives, for which they
suffered with their lives. The natives themselves came about us
as usual, and some who went near the Sirius were shaved; when
they landed on the Western point, they examined every thing, and
went away very friendly, taking no notice of the murders, and
seeming to fear no resentment; but the Governor thought it
necessary to avenge it, so he set out with a strong party well
armed, and landed were the bodies were found, then proceeding
across the country to Botany Bay, he saw on the beech upwards of
50 canoes, but no natives near them. However, in a cove between
Botany Bay and Port Jackson, he fell in with about 300 natives of
both sexes, and a friendly intercourse took place, but nothing
which could tend to discover the murderers.</p>
<p>His Majesty's birthday was kept with all the honours the
colony were capable of shewing; the Sirius and Supply fired
several vollies, and in honour of his Majesty's second brother,
the Governor fixed the boundaries of the first county on the
island, and named it Cumberland County. Each person in the colony
drank his Majesty's health, and those sent to the rocks as a
punishment, received a free pardon. That vicious minds, never
lose an opportunity of taking an advantage is universally
admitted, and the little liberty allowed the convicts this
evening, afforded them an opportunity of plundering many huts and
tents. An officer on going to his tent, found a convict, who he
was obliged to wound with his sword before he could secure him.
Fortunately two were detected and executed, but one of these was
out of the way for 19 days, secreting himself by day, and coming
at night to the colony to rob the huts and tents.</p>
<p>Economy is one of those virtues which could hardly be expected
to reign among convicts; they were so destitute of it that they
would not manage to use their provisions so as to last the week,
but by devouring the whole in the beginning of the week, were
totally without for the latter part.</p>
<p>One of these improvident men made his week's allowance of
flour (which was at that time 8lbs.) into cakes, and eat them at
one meal. The consequence was, he was taken both senseless and
speechless, and next day died. A convict, to whose care was
entrusted the cattle, let 4 cows and 2 bulls stray away, and did
not inform the Governor of the loss for 2 days, every exertion
was made use of to recover them, but after a fruitless search for
many days, they were given up as lost. As the weather became
colder, the fish deserted the coast so much that few were to be
caught, and from this cause the natives suffered so much, that
one old man was found nearly starved to death. On the 22d a
slight shock of an earthquake was observed, it lasted two or
three seconds, but was so slight, that many did not feel it. The
Prince of Wales, Alexander, Borrowdale, and Friendship, completed
their stores, and sailed for England on the 14th of July, and on
the 20th the Supply sailed with provisions for Norfolk Island.
Two transports now only remained, and every preparation was
making for clearing and discharging them. A cellar was made, to
receive the stock of spirits from on board the Fishburn, and the
provisions from the Golden Grove were placed in the large
storehouse. As many accidents happened by fire, an order was
issued to prevent chimnies being built in those huts that were
thatched. When our people were fishing, it was by no means
uncommon for some of the natives to come down and help them haul
the seine, for which assistance they usually had a share of the
fish given them. However, one day, driven by hunger or some less
honest motive, they came and took more than half what was brought
on shore; they were armed, and had a party in the rear with
spears poized, ready to throw if any resistance had been made;
but for the future a petty officer was ordered to go with every
fishing boat down the harbour. Notwithstanding all the orders,
that could be given to prevent offending the natives, they had,
in toto, no effect on the convicts, for in direct opposition to
the Governor's regular orders, they would wander about, often
only two together, and even singly. On the 27th, as two convicts
strayed in this way, the natives made signs to them to go back,
which they did, but ran different ways, the natives seeing this,
threw spears at them; one escaped, but the other received two
spears, on which, he swam over the bay, and said the natives
laughed at him.</p>
<p>The beginning of August was so very rainy, that all building,
and indeed labour of every kind was suspended, and considerable
damage was done to the brick-kiln, which fell in, a quantity of
bricks were spoilt, and the very roads were unable to be passed.
Till the 14th, when the weather changed, no work could be done.
During the unfavourable deluge, thefts were frequent, a sheep,
intended for celebrating the Prince of Wales's birth day, was
stolen, and notwithstanding the Governor offered the reward of
emancipation for the discovery, it was without effect; but the
Prince's birth day was observed by a cessation from labour, and
the colours were displayed at the flagstaff, on this and all
other birthdays of the Royal Family.</p>
<p>A party of natives, on the 21st, landed from five canoes, near
where the observatory was building, while some engaged the
workmen and officers, the others endeavoured to take away a goat
from the hospital, but being resisted by a sailor, they held
their spears at him till he retreated, then killed the goat, and
putting it in a canoe, bore towards Long Cove. The Governor
followed them, and got up with some of the party, but neither
could meet with the offenders or the goat. The Supply, on the
26th, arrived from Norfolk Island, with accounts that the flax
plant had been discovered, and was growing luxuriently, but the
wheat seed was found to have been heated on the passage, and
would not vegetate.</p>
<p>One of the most artful convicts, amused the Settlement at
Sydney Cove, with an account of a gold mine, he pretended to have
discovered, and offered to conduct an officer to the spot. A boat
was got ready, but on landing at the place, he prevailed on the
officer to send away the boat, and afterwards left him, and
arrived at the colony, some hours before the officer, saying he
sent him for a guard, but before that gentleman returned, he
escaped into the wood, and did not return till next day, when he
had 50 lashes for the imposition; however he persisted that he
had discovered a metal, of which he produced a bit. The Governor
returned about this time from an excursion, and on hearing his
tale, ordered him to be again taken down the harbour, and told
the man, that if it turned out a deception, he would put him to
death. This saved more trouble, for the man confessed he had
invented the tale to impose on the crews of the Fishburn and
Golden Grove, who under the idea of having gold dust from him,
would let him have cloathing, &amp;c. and the specimens
exhibited, where made from part of a brass buckle and a guinea,
the remains of which he produced; for this trick he had 100
lashes, and wore a canvass frock with an R cut and sewed on it,
to render him a more conspicuous rogue than the rest; but so
ignorant were many, that they believed he had really discovered a
gold mine, notwithstanding his confession, and the <i>reward</i>
he highly deserved, justly obtained, and still publicly wore.</p>
<p>Those who were imprudent enough to exceed the limits laid
down, without taking arms, continued to be molested by the
natives. In the course of this month, a straying convict, was
beaten, stripped, and would have been murdered by them, had they
not been alarmed by a musquet going off, on which they left him,
and his clothes as fast as they could.</p>
<p>September arrived, and the wheat sown at Port Jackson seemed
to promise as little as that at Norfolk Island, therefore the
Governor ordered the Sirius, to the Cape of Good Hope for seed,
and as much flour as she could stow for the use of the colony;
that she might bring a greater quantity, her guns were landed on
the the West point of the cove: the Golden Grove was also ordered
to prepare for taking stores, provisions, and convicts to Norfolk
Island, A house for the stores of the detachment being now
finished, they were landed from the Sirius, and placed in it. A
boat of eight oars, and another of sixteen, sent out in frame,
were now put together. The only cow left went mad, and was
obliged to be shot, though with calf, The Golden Grove, on the 2d
of October, received thirty-two convicts, a party of marines, and
two seamen from the Sirius on board, for Norfolk Island; and the
Sirius sailed the same day for the Cape of Good Hope, from which
time, one pound of flour was deducted per week from those who
received the full allowance, and two thirds of a pound from those
at a shorter allowance, and thus it was to continue fill the
return of the Sirius, but by this deduction labour was not
affected. Some convicts were employed in procuring timber to form
a bridge, over the stream at the head of the cove. A party of
Natives, on the 24th, met a stray convict, and threw spears at
him, but luckily without effect. On having information of this,
the Governor went with an armed party; and hearing some natives
in the bushes fired among them, being determined, they should
keep from the colony. The Governor, in one of his excursions,
discovered some fine land at the head of the cove, which, from
its form, he called the Crescent, and having determined to fix a
settlement there, on the 2d of November he went to mark out
ground for a redoubt and other buildings, and on the 4th 20
convicts, who understood the farming business, were dispatched to
him. This spot was named Rose-Hill, and the earth being of
superior quality to that about Sydney Cove, and free from rocks,
it promised well for the encrease of grain. The Golden Grove
returned on the 10th with very favourable accounts from Norfolk
Island; Lieut. King wrote that his people were healthy,
vegetables and fish were in abundance, that his gardens
flourished, and the grain last sown promised a line crop. On the
19th, the two store ships sailed for England, by which the
Governor sent home dispatches. The redoubt began in July was this
month completed, and two pieces of ordnance mounted in it. The
convict who fabricated the story of the gold-mine, had for some
time been observed to have become very lazy, and to neglect his
work; and at length he was convicted of house-breaking, and
suffered death. Before he was turned off, he mentioned two women,
who received the property he at various times stole. These were
afterwards apprehended, and one of them made an example of; her
head was shaved, and a canvas frock put on her, with R. S. G.
(receiver of stolen goods) painted on, and was to be punished, if
ever seen without it. It was hoped, that shame would operate on
some of the convicts at least, for of many no good could be
expected, they were too callous, for any thing human to reform,
and so lazy that no more work could be obtained from them, than
just enough to prevent that punishment, which was the reward of
total neglect. At length the Governor, ordered, that those who
did not do the work allotted them should only receive two-thirds
of the allowance of provisions. On the contrary, there were some
few convicts, whose conduct was marked by obedience and
attention, but these never associated with the vile ones. So
eager, was one of the convicts, to return to England at the end
of his time, that he sold part of his provisions from time to
time to other convicts, to get money for his passage, and at last
he died for want, leaving behind him a whole week's provisions
intended for sale.</p>
<p>A boat-house was began under Mr. Ried, the carpenter of the
Supply, to build boats, &amp;c. with the timber of this country.
A landing place was formed on the East side of the cove, and on
the West side a powder magazine was marked out, to be built of
stone. The Governor determined, to procure one or two natives and
bring them to the settlement, for the purpose of learning the
native language, that by a capability of conversing, both parties
might acquire a proper knowledge of the other, and know their
friends and enemies. Accordingly, on December 30th, Lieuts. Ball
and Johnstone seized a young man and brought him to the Governor,
who had him clothed, and a light iron put on his wrist, he was
then committed to the care of a convict, who could be well
trusted. A hut had been prepared, and in this he slept well, all
the first night, and made no attempt to escape. Thunder,
lightning, rain, and hot weather closed the year, yet these
violent commotions of the elements, by no means gave the most
judicious an unfavourable opinion of the climate; neither did the
frequent enormities, committed by the more depraved part of the
convicts, make the enlighted part of the colony despair of
eventually effecting all the good which could be rationally
expected.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<p><b>1789.]</b></p>
<p><small>IDLENESS</small>, the mother of all vices, held an
absolute sway over the convicts, but this was not the only evil
to be complained of. Thefts, which may be called the children of
idleness, were no strangers to the colony, one committed a
robbery, and fled to the woods, but came every night to rob the
tents and huts, and once effected a robbery on the public store,
however he was taken, tried, and hung. Another for, stabbing a
woman with whom he lived, was sentenced to have 700 lashes, half
of which he had at the time the other was executed. When one of
our boats went down the harbour with convicts to cut rushes, some
natives stole three jackets, on the discovery they were pursued,
when they left their canoe, and landing ran into the woods; but
our people, notwithstanding the continual orders, to touch
nothing belonging to the natives, retained the canoe, on seeing
which they threw a spear and wounded the cockswain. The young
native that was taken to the colony in December, was now taken
down the harbour, and conversed several times with his friends,
but had no wish to leave the settlement. To prevent the convicts
practice of selling their clothes, the Governor ordered, that any
person buying them, should on information be obliged to redeliver
them, and lose the money they might have given for them.</p>
<p>At the end of February, the detachment took possession of
their barracks, and a brick guard-house was began. At Rose-Hill
the ground was being cleared, but the labour of removing the
timber when cut down, very much retarded the progress of our
people. One of the convicts, in March, strayed away to the woods,
to obtain a herb called by us the sweet tea, and he was murdered
by the natives. The brick-makers gang, to which this man
belonged, determined on revenge, and arming themselves with
sticks, proceeded against the natives, but met a larger number
than they expected, who threw spears at them, and killed one man
and wounded six. On this, a well armed party was sent out, who
found the body of the man, and a boy whom they had wounded and
nearly cut his left ear off. Notwithstanding this party suffered
so much, by going without orders against the natives, the
Governor determined to punish them, and ordered those not wounded
to have 150 lashes each, and as soon as the others recovered,
they were to have the same. Six soldiers were discovered, in a
plan they had long executed, of robbing the store, by means of a
false key, which breaking in the lock, led to a discovery, and
the six were tried and hung. In the mean time Norfolk Island
escaped an insurrection. The Supply returned from there on the
24th.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the 26th of February, early in the morning, a
hurricane visited the island, several pines of 180 feet in length
and upwards, were blown down, and from then till noon the wind
increased, with torrents of rain. A very large oak was blown on
the granary, and dashed it to pieces, breaking several barrels of
flour. At noon the storm was so violent, that it blew up more
trees than 50 men could have felled in a fortnight, and the
gardens both public and private were destroyed. Lieutenant King's
people were in good health, and he retained the same good opinion
of the climate, he entertained at first; for the internal defence
of the island he had formed the free people into a militia, and
general satisfaction was visible in every countenance when the
Supply dropped anchor in the cove. The Governor ever anxious to
discover all that could be of use to the Islands prosperity,
directed in the beginning of April, a survey to be made of a
large bay on the North shore, in consequence of which, a
sufficient depth of water was discovered for foreign ships to
anchor in. The Governor called it Neutral Bay. Early in this
month the people gave information, that on going to the harbour
they found the caves filled with dead bodies of the natives. The
cause of this was discovered on bringing two men, a boy, and a
girl to the colony, when it proved to be the small-pox. The two
men were overcome by the disease too much to recover, but the boy
and girl did very well directly. The native who resided with us,
said whole families were killed by it, and that many to avoid it,
flew to the woods. When the boy recovered, he was taken by Mr.
White, the surgeon, of whom the boy was very fond, and the girl
was taken by the clergyman's wife. From the time the children
came to us, the native who lived in the settlement was very
attentive to them, and, as was feared by every body, he caught
the infection and died. At five in the evening, on the 6th, after
an absence of seven months and six days, the Sirius from the Cape
of Good Hope anchored in the cove. She arrived at the Cape on the
2d of January, and sailed on her return on the 20th of February.
In a gale she suffered much damage. She brought 127,000 weight of
flour for the settlement, and twelve months provisions for her
crew. The latter end of May several convicts reported they had
seen the body of a white man in a cove at a distance; a muster
was called and no one found absent but a black named C&aelig;sar,
who had absconded from the service of an officer, and taken with
him a gun, an iron pot, and some provisions; in the course of a
short time, however, he was caught, and as the idea of death
seemed to have no effect on his mind, the Governor ordered him to
be kept at work on Garden Island in fetters. The King's birthday
was celebrated with every possible respect on June 4th, 1789, and
in addition to the ceremonies of last year, the ordnance of the
colony was fired for the first time, and in the evening, some of
the convicts were suffered to perform the comedy of the
Recruiting Officer. On the following day Lieut. Creswell, with a
body of marines, sailed in the Supply for Norfolk Island. The
Governor returned on the 14th of July, from a second excursion up
the river Hawkesbury, in which he was impeded by a shallow just
above a hill, he called Richmond Hill. Two years had now elapsed,
and several convicts claimed the privileges of free men, but by
some accident the proper papers for ascertaining the facts, had
been left in England, and though no profit hardly could arise
from the freedom being granted, they were anxious for it, so the
Governor directed the Judge-Advocate to take the affidavits of
those who could swear their time was expired, and recommended
them to work for the public till the papers left in England
should arrive. The live-stock of the colony now became an object
of attention, it was observed, that all the animals kept for
breeding brought forth a greater number of males than females, as
in a litter of twelve pigs, nine were males, and only one kid out
of seven was a female, and it generally happened in the same
proportion, This circumstance was of serious consequence, for it
threatened to retard the time when the assistance from the mother
country could be dispensed with. From Lieut. King, at Norfolk
Island, the Supply brought dispatches, saying 17 acres of ground
had been cleared, that he was erecting a store-house, and had
made a road from Sydney to Cascade Bay, and a cotton tree was
discovered.</p>
<p>The continual depredations committed in the colony, drew every
good mind to consider some mode of relief, and at length a plan
was proposed by one Harris, a convict, for a night watch, to take
up such as might be out after a given hour, and to be assisted by
the military if wanted, this proposal was accepted by the
Governor, and adopted on the 8th of August. On a survey of the
Sirius, she was found to want considerable repairs, which
commenced directly.</p>
<p>As Henry Hacking, who was suffered to go into the woods to
shoot fowls, was thus employed, a stone was thrown at him with
great force, and on looking about, saw about 40 natives in the
bushes, wishing to get rid of them, he presented his piece
several times, but instead of going away they followed him, on
which he fired, and on discharging a second time, they went away.
The purser of the Sirius, who was cutting wood, received a visit
from a few natives, who hid his axes in the bushes, but finding
he missed them, they ran off, and left two children behind them,
which the purser, Mr. Palmer, detained till he recovered the
property lost.</p>
<p>The corn promised a grateful return at Rose-Hill, where an emu
was killed, which on being opened contained 50 eggs. In October a
vessel was launched, which was employed in taking provisions,
&amp;c. to Rose-Hill. It was now discovered that the store was
infested with rats, and on removing them, eight casks of flour
were found destroyed.</p>
<p>In the beginning of November, the quantity of provisions
issued to the males in the colony was reduced one-third, except
spirits. This measure was adopted from the uncertainty of hearing
from England, it was however found requisite to issue this ration
of provisions on Saturdays and Wednesdays, to make them last the
proper time.</p>
<p><b>1790.]</b></p>
<p>Captain Hunter, on the 7th of November, brought the Sirius
into the cove perfectly repaired and fit for sea. The supply on
the 11th sailed for Norfolk Island, and was to call at Lord Howe
Island in quest of turtle. By the activity of the watchmen, a
female convict was taken up for house breaking, and received
sentence to die, when she pleaded being with child, but a jury of
women pronouncing otherwise she was executed, and previous to
being hung, acknowledged she only said she was so, to save her
life. One of the colony boats caught as many fish in the seine as
would have served the whole settlement a day, had it not burst,
and a boat belonging to the Sirius caught near fifty large fish,
which were called light horsemen from a bone that grew out of the
head like a helmet. On the 25th of November two natives were
secured, they were known by the children, who informed them of
the safety they were in, but being dissatisfied, one effected his
escape with an iron on his ancle, and the other was detected when
going to follow the first, This month a brick-house was began for
the Judge-Advocate, and in December the harvest was got in; at
Rose-Hill it produced 200 bushels of wheat, 35 of barley, a few
oats, and a small quantity of Indian corn, all of which was
reserved for seed, and 25 bushels of barley was produced from a
small spot of ground called the Governor's Farm, at Sydney. The
Supply returned from Norfolk Island on the 21st, in her visit to
Lord Howe Island. 18 turtle were turned, but as several died on
the passage only four could be left there. A few days before
Christmas a cabbage was cut at Rose-Hill, that weighed 26lbs. On
the 7th of January, 1790, the Supply sailed for Norfolk Island,
with convicts and stores, as Lieut. King wished more hands to be
sent to him. A convict, whose term the Governor was convinced had
expired, signified a wish to become a settler, and as he had been
bred to the business of a farmer, and by his good conduct and
industry while in the colony, manifested a strong desire to
return to a good line of life. The Governor ordered two acres of
ground to be cleared, and a hut built for him, and supplied him
with tools, seed, and live-stock, that he might commence farmer.
Anxiety now became seriously visible, for the flour brought from
England was expended, and only that, procured from the Cape of
Good Hope remained. On the South head of the harbour a flagstaff,
was erected, and a hut for those who attended it. This was meant
to serve as a signal for any vessel that might arrive, and that
the settlement might learn when any came in view. Fish was often
caught in great abundance, and one night, enough was taken to
afford two pounds to every person in the settlement, which was
given them exclusive of the regular provisions. The Governor
directed boats to go out three times a week to fish for the
public, and the produce was of great service. C&aelig;sar, who
was sent to work on Garden Island, effected his escape, and got
to Rose-Hill, from whence he returned on the 30th very much
wounded by some natives; but he said he had discovered the cattle
lost from the colony, and in endeavouring to drive them before
him, the natives threw spears at him. From his known character
this was paid no attention to, but he was secured and taken to
the hospital to be healed of his wounds. On the 10th of February,
a signal was made from the flagstaff, every mind was big with
expectation in full hopes of hearing from England, but it proved
only the Supply on her return from Norfolk Island, being unable
to bear up to Port Jackson she had gone to Botany Bay. Lieut.
King informed the Governor that his wheat had returned 20 fold,
and his people were healthy, and that the gardens flourished. The
soil at Norfolk Island bearing such an evident superiority over
that of the settlement, determined the Governor to send a number
of convicts there, with two companies of marines. A month passed
in making preparations for their departure. The weather was very
bad, the rain poured down in torrents, doing great damage among
the huts of the convicts. The allowance of spirits which had
hitherto been half a pint a day, was on the 1st of March reduced
to half that quantity. On the 3d, two companies of marines, with
their officers, the Lieutenant-Governor, and a surgeon, embarked
on board the ships Sirius and Supply. On the following day, 116
male and 68 female convicts, and 27 children, were put on board.
C&aelig;sar was one of the male convicts, who the Governor
pardoned; and one of an opposite description, for his conduct had
been so good as to raise him to the privileges of freedom, and he
was now sent as an assistant to a medical gentleman at Norfolk
Island. The Sirius and Supply sailed on the 5th. Capt. Hunter
left at the South Head, the gunner, a midshipman, and six of the
Sirius's crew. Those who remained at Sydney had all the
Governor's attention, he visited the huts left empty, by those
gone to Norfolk Island, and gave them to those whose huts were in
a miserable state, and that this kindness might not fail to have
some good effect, they were told, that unless, both the huts and
gardens were kept in a good state, they would be turned out, and
that they might have time to do this, Wednesday afternoon and all
Saturday was allowed them. On the 27th, a still shorter ration
was found requisite to be adopted, and 4lbs. of flour,
2&frac12;lbs. of pork, and 1&frac12;lb. of rice, was all that
could be allowed per week, for each person. This consequently
affected the capability of working so much, that it was ordered
to begin work at sunrise and end at one o'clock, allowing a
little time for breakfast; and the afternoon was allowed them to
receive their provisions and work in their gardens. The same
regulations were adopted at Rose-Hill, and the night-watch was
urged to be very active. The little live-stock now began to be an
evil, for those to whom it belonged, being unable to keep them
regularly fed, suffered them to range about, and as they did
considerable damage in the gardens, the Governor ordered them to
be kept up at night, for if caught in any garden they should be
forfeited.</p>
<p>On the 3d of April it was directed, that all the fish caught
should be issued at the public store, at the rate of ten pounds
of fish to two pounds and a half of pork, for in the present
state of affairs the smallest saving was an object. The want of
supplies from England, threw a gloom over every person in the
settlement, which was materially augmented by the loss of the
Sirius, on the reef at Norfolk Island, this nearly banished all
hope, as it was to this ship going for provisions, that all
looked for relief Every exertion was made to save the ship,
without effect, but no life was lost, and the major part of the
provisions on board were saved. After the loss of the Sirius it
was found requisite to proclaim martial law; and that two keys
should be made to the public store, one to be kept by Capt.
Hunter in behalf of the seamen, and the other by some person on
the part of the military, And the next day the troops, seamen,
and convicts, being informed of the resolutions, shewed their
satisfaction, by passing under the colours displayed on purpose.
The Supply brought the Commandant of Norfolk Island, and upwards
of thirty persons lately of the Sirius.</p>
<p>Thus situated, the Governor called a council, when the
dreadful situation of the colony was viewed, and it was agreed,
that even the small ration of provisions must be reduced to all
but children under 18 months. All private boats were to be given
up for the public use, to be used in fishing, and men were to
shoot for the benefit of the colony. The fishing boats not
succeeding in the fishery at Botany Bay, were sent to Sydney with
considerable success, but as the men employed were not found
trustworthy, an officer accompanied them. On the 7th, four
hundred pounds weight of fish were caught and issued; but from
that day, during the month, so little was caught, that all the
private boats were returned, and the men employed in them taken
to the boats of government, and the shooting proved ineffectual;
necessity became pressing, and the colony had to deplore the
non-arrival of stores from England. The only means left was to
send Lieut. Ball, in the Supply, to Batavia, to get eight months'
provisions for the ship, and hire another to assist in bringing
to the colony</p>

<p>with necessaries for the hospital. Distant as the period must
be when these could arrive, they were the only ones to be
depended on. She sailed on the 17th of April, and could not be
expected to return in less than six months. What tender anxiety
must every one have felt when this vessel sailed; every hope
rested on its success, and as the masthead became invisible, a
prayer for her safety must have burst from every heart, and a
tear thrill from each eye on losing the object of its
attention.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the distressed state of the colony, care was
taken to reserve 300 bushels of wheat for seed, and the Governor
with his usual consideration of the public good, gave up 300
weight of flour, which was his own property, and received only
the same ration for himself as the soldier or the convict. Thus
the hut of the convict and the government-house knew alike the
miseries of want. But though distress reigned universally, it was
not possible to prevent thefts. A female convict coming from
Rose-Hill was robbed of seven days' ration, and as the state of
the store would not afford her loss to be made good, she was left
to the charity of the rest, who had themselves by far too little
to empower them to work. An old man, who came to the store for
his day's allowance, exhausted with hunger and weakened by age,
was carried to the hospital, where he died the next day; his
stomach was opened and proved empty, and it appeared, on inquiry,
that having nothing to cook his little provision in, he was
forced to pay for the loan of one by a part of it, but when he
could not afford to do thus, he was obliged to eat them raw,
which caused indigestion, and killed him.</p>
<p>At Rose-Hill no misconduct was found among the convicts; a
kangaroo was caught there which weighed 180lbs. The native dogs
grew troublesome, as they came in numbers by night, and killed
several hogs. The colony now became in want of salt, so two
boilers were erected to boil salt water, and by this simple means
was obtained a supply of that useful article; and as the fishing
tackle began to decrease, a rope-maker, (a convict,) was put to
make lines from the bark of a tree, like the natives. The little
labour that could be obtained from a starving people, was applied
to getting the ground at Rose-Hill and Sydney ready to sow. On
the 3d of June, every heart was delighted by the long expected
signal for a ship in sight at South head, and though it blew very
hard, Captain Tench, and the Governor's Secretary, with Mr.
White, went off at great risk, and reached the ship in time to
give directions for her being placed in Spring Cove. She proved
to be the Lady Juliana transport, from London, last from
Plymouth, from whence she sailed on the 29th of July, with 222
female convicts on board. It was now found that the not hearing
from England arose from neglect, delay, and misfortune, and the
latter was by far the most serious. Two months after the Lady
Juliana, sailed the Guardian, of 44 guns, Lieut. Riou commander,
stored with provisions, &amp;c. which joined with those on board
the Juliana, made enough for two years, including clothing for
the seamen, marines, and convicts, wines, blankets, medicines,
tools, &amp;c. &amp;c. The Guardian had a large collection of
private property, for the officers, on board. Lieut. Riou, with
his valuable cargo, touched at the Cape of Good Hope for
live-stock for the colony, and took on board 150 fruit trees
prepared on purpose, under the direction of Sir Joseph Banks.
This ship, unfortunately for all parties, on the 23d of December,
struck against an island of ice, in latitude 45&deg;. 54'. South,
and longitude 41&deg;. 30'. East, which did her so much damage,
that to prevent her instantly sinking, the greater part of the
cargo, both public and private property, were obliged to be
thrown overboard. The live-stock was all killed, and the trees
all destroyed, but the ship herself was saved, and had just
regained port on the Juliana's arrival, and 75 barrels of flour
were put on board her from the Guardian; added to these
circumstances, the Lady Juliana brought intelligence, that 1000
convicts were to sail from England shortly after, and that a
corps of foot for the service of the country was raising. The
pleasure felt on the first sight of the Juliana, was considerably
depressed by the unpleasant news she brought. The birthday of his
Majesty was kept with every honour, and the Governor pardoned all
those in confinement or under sentence of punishment; and the 9th
of this month was appointed to he kept as a day of thanksgiving
for his Majesty's recovery from his late lamentable illness, of
which they now first heard. The Lady Juliana could not reach the
cove till the 6th. It was much to be lamented, that at a time
when a cargo of any thing but convicts would have been of
service, that scarce any thing else should arrive, but
fortunately the colony had effectual relief by the arrival of the
Justinian store-ship, Maitland, master, with provisions, and
requisites of all kinds, from England, after a short passage of
five months. Three transports were now hourly expected, with 1000
convicts and detachments of the corps. The day after the
Justinian arrived, the full ration was ordered to be given, and
served weekly, and the drums beat as formerly for labour, and
every thing resumed its former appearance. A shop was opened on
shore by the master of the Juliana, for the sale of grocery,
stationary, glass, &amp;c. &amp;c. but were offered so dear as to
sell few. On. the 26th, the Surprize transport, from England,
Nicholas Anstis, master*, came into the cove; she had on board
several officers and privates of "The New South Wales Corps", and
218 male convicts. This vessel sailed from Portsmouth on the 19th
of January, with two other transports, and only parted with them
between the Cape of Good Hope and New South Wales; during the
voyage they buried 42, and 100 more were now on the sick list. On
the 28th, the Neptune and Scarborough anchored off Garden Island,
and the next morning entered the Cove. Great fears had been
entertained that these vessels would increase the sick list, and
these fears were realized, for the next day at noon, 200 sick
were landed from the transports. On the West side was a shocking
scene; above 30 tents were pitched before the hospital, and all
the huts in the neighbourhood were filled with sick; many died,
being brought on shore, and the appearance of those not on the
sick list, was emaciated; this, and the illness of the others,
was occasioned by the way in which they were brought over, some
in irons singly, and some linked together. A plan had been
detected for a mutiny to take the Scarborough, and this was the
cause of much circumspection; for the future, few were suffered
to be on deck at once, so that the want of air increased diseases
shocking of themselves, and some on board the Neptune died in
irons. Profit to the owners was all that seemed to be considered
aboard these vessels. New bread was made and delivered daily to
the sick, and wine, vegetables, &amp;c. were given them, indeed
no means of decreasing the sick list was neglected. The
detachment of the New South Wales Corps was disembarked, and they
took possession of the quarters allotted them in the marine
barracks. The total of sick, on the 30th of June, was 349. By the
7th of July, the portable hospital, brought over in the
Justinian, was got up and instantly filled; and on the 13th, the
sick list was augmented to 488 persons. The convicts whose health
would permit, were sent to be employed at Rose-Hill, with a
detachment of the New South Wales corps.</p>
<p align="center"><small>[* Mr. Anstis was chief-mate on board
the Lady Penrhyn.]</small></p>
<p>The Governor this month, marked out land for a town at
Rose-Hill, one street of which was to be a mile in extent, and
205 feet wide. At the same time, every one was busy at Sydney,
discharging the transports, by which Lieut. Riou, sent from the
Cape of Good Hope 400 tierces of beef, and 200 of pork, saved
from the Guardian's wreck, which with the flour received by the
Juliana, was all that could be preserved of the invaluable cargo;
a brick store-house was built this month, and a road formed from
the brick kilns to the buildings. The Surprize and Justinian were
ordered to Norfolk Island, as the Lady Juliana wanted repairs.
The Justinian sailed on the 28th of July, with provisions and
stores, and after landing them, was to proceed to Canton to
freight home. By this ship the Governor forwarded dispatches, and
the Lady Juliana being by great exertion repaired, sailed in a
few days on the same course. The Governor received by these ships
official instructions, respecting the distribution of land, to
those of the marines, who wished to become settlers in the
country: every non-commissioned officer was to have 130 acres if
single, and 150 if married: to every private 80 acres if single,
and 100 if married; and 10 acres for every child barn at the time
of the grant, free of all rent for five years, and then to pay
only one shilling a year for every 50 acres; and if they entered
into the New Corps, and formed a company, to be officered from
the marines, they were to have a bounty of 3<i>l</i>. and double
the quantity of land, if they conducted themselves well for five
years; and in this case to be subject to no rent for 10 years,
and then only one shilling for every 50 acres: and on such grant
to receive one year's provisions, seed, tools, and agricultural
implements; and when they could prove their ability, to cloth and
maintain a number of convicts, they were to have their labour.
Government between each parcel of land so allotted, retained a
space as crown land, which was to be let on lease for 14 years.
In each township 400 acres were kept for a clergyman, and 200 for
a school-master. The land, both good and bad, in all cases to be
equally divided. The convicts who wished to become, settlers,
either on emancipation or discharge, were to receive 30 acres if
single, and 50 if married, and 10 for every child born at the
time of settling; and the only conditions required by Government
of the settlers, were, that they should reside on, and cultivate
the ground, and reserve such timber as might be fit for his
Majesty's navy. Towards the end of July, a whale came into the
harbour, and some boats went after it, but the people not being
acquainted with the use of the harpoon, it escaped, and in its
course upset a punt, and Mr. Furguson, a midshipman of the
Sirius, with two soldiers were drowned; after which it ran on
shore, and was killed by the natives. On the 1st of August, the
Surprize sailed for Norfolk Island, with 135 male and 150 female
convicts, with two superintendants and a deputy commissary. The
Scarborough sailed for Canton on the 8th, and the Neptune on the
24th. Exertion was now made in all parts to forward the general
interest; and as provisions were regularly delivered, work could
be regularly enforced, and the thefts became less frequent, and
till September the natives caused no more trouble; but then Mr.
White saw (Bennillong) the native who escaped in May, from the
settlement, and he sent by Mr. White, as a present to the
Governor, a slice of the whale. The Governor wishing to see him,
armed, and went to the look-out, with a party, as he heard the
cove was full of natives, and landed just by the whale.
Bennillong was there with another, called Cole-be, who had also
escaped from the settlement. The former was so altered in his
person, that the Governor could hardly recollect him, till joined
by Lieutenant Waterhouse and Captain Collins, to the latter of
which gentlemen Bennillong was much attached, and now expressed
much joy at seeing him again. Various articles were given to the
natives, who were attending the whale feast. They shortly began
forming a circle round the Governor and his party, this somewhat
alarmed them, and the Governor proposed, retreating backwards
towards the boats, and instructions had been given to the men, to
remain on their oars in case of any accident. Bennillong had
shewn to the Governor several natives, and one he particularly
pointed to his Excellency; wishing to notice him, the Governor
went towards him, presenting both his hands, which civility, the
savage mistook for an attempt to seize him, so lifting his spear
in an instant, discharged it at the Governor, and with such force
was it thrown, that entering above the collar-bone the barb came
through on the other side. The spear was broken off by Lieut.
Waterhouse, and while the Governor was being conducted back to
the boat, the men landed armed, but out of four musquets only one
would go off. Two hours elapsed before the boat could reach the
settlement, when the spear was extracted, and the wound
pronounced not mortal. This misfortune, no doubt arose from the
Governor landing unarmed, for the strong armed party sent off for
Mr. White, (the principal surgeon), to broken Bay, returned the
next day, and though they saw many natives no accident happened.
In a few days Bennillong, with his wife and several companions,
came to a cove on the North shore, near the settlement, and Mr.
White and others taking Boo-roong (the native female child who
was cured of the small pox) an interview with the natives was
obtained, in the course of which Bennillong said, he had beaten
Wil-le-me-ring, (the native who had wounded the Governor), and
that he should wait some days, in hopes that the Governor would
pay him a visit, which his Excellency did, on the tenth day after
he received the wound, but himself and officers were ail armed.
Bennillong assured him, that it was owing to fears for his own
safety that Wil-le-me-ring threw the spear. This visit may he
esteemed the foundation of a good understanding with the natives.
On the 26th of September, five men who had been transported for
life, effected an escape from Rose-Hill, and on inquiry it was
found they intended to steer for Otaheite; but from the boat in
which they undertook their voyage, there can be no doubt but they
perished. In the beginning of October, the heat and want of rain
was so great, that the grass caught fire and burned for some
miles, but the wind got strong N.W. and it was soon checked. On
the 8th of October, Bennillong, after many promises came to see
the Governor, and his reception so delighted him, that he wished
to have a hut and live near the settlement, for the building of
which directions were immediately given.</p>
<p>On the 19th, a signal was made for a ship in sight, and
shortly the Supply came into the Cove from Batavia, after an
absence of six months and two days. It was with great difficulty
that Lieut. Ball executed his mission, at the expense of
11,688<i>l</i> 6s. 9d. As the five men escaped in September,
others were tempted to make similar trials, but were detected,
and the masts and oars, &amp;c. they had hid in the woods were
destroyed. A boat belonging to Mr. White, which went out with the
seine, was filled by the surf, and went down near Middle Head,
with five people, who were all drowned. The oars, &amp;c. which
floated on shore, the natives fixed up on the coast, so that they
might be seen by our people, this was the first act that shewed a
friendly inclination towards the colony from them. A Storehouse
was began and finished in November, at Rose-Hill, the size of
which was 100 feet by 20. At Sydney, a landing place on the East
side was finished, a cutler's-shop, a place to boil oil and melt
tallow, and Bennillong's hut was completed, and he took
possession of it.</p>
<p>The Dutch Snow, Waaksamheyd, (Good-look-out), hired by Lieut.
Ball, anchored in the Cove, with the provisions, &amp;c. bought
by that gentleman, at Batavia, which turned out of an inferior
quality, and served to shew that the Dutch are not very nice
about oppressing those in want, as our colony was then. In the
course of the year 1790, 2 seamen, 1 soldier, 123 male convicts,
7 females, and 10 children, died, making together 143
persons.</p>
<p><b>1791.]</b></p>
<p>It would be well if at the beginning of the new year, 1791, I
could say the convicts in general had become new men, but that
was not the case; for as the Indian corn grew ripe their
depredations commenced, notwithstanding the full ration they now
received: they seemed indeed to have an innate principle for
stealing engrafted in their constitutions. In January, the
natives stole the colours from the flagstaff. On the 22d, the
Supply sailed for Norfolk Island, with provisions, and to bring
back Capt. Hunter, and the crew of the Sirius; with which she
returned on the 26th of February. The greatest distress was
suffered there previous to the arrival of the provisions, but now
every thing went on well, and the Supply brought some canvas
manufactured there, from the flax of the country.</p>
<p>On a survey of Norfolk Island, it was seen, that only three or
four hundred families could be supported by the produce of
it.</p>
<p>In February, the heat was so great at Rose-Hill, that a number
of birds and bats fell down dead from the trees and while flying
in the air. On the 2d of March, Lieut. Thomas Edgar hoisted a
pendant on board the Dutch Snow, which the Governor hired to go
to England; and at the end of the month, the officers and seamen
who were to return to England, were embarked, but ten seamen and
two marines preferred settling in New South Wales. On the 28th
the Snow sailed for England, with Capt Hunter, and the officers,
and part of the crew belonging to the Sirius: and in the course
of the night of the 28th, one Bryant, (with his wife and two
children), and seven other convicts escaped in a boat; and it was
found the master of the Dutch Snow, furnished them with a chart
and compass, which as some of them understood the use of, there
remained no doubt, but they would reach Timor in safety, for it
was understood they meant to make that place.</p>
<p>In the course of this month, the first settler, James Ruse,
after having been fifteen months on his ground, became desirous
of giving up all claims on the public store, as he found he could
live on the produce of his farm. As much had been suffered for
want of provisions, the Governor esteemed it prudent to guard
against a second suffering, by lowering the ration in time;
therefore on the first Saturday in April, 3lbs. of flour, 3lbs.
of rice, and 3lbs. of pork, or 4&frac12;lbs. of beef were served
to every man, woman, and child above ten years old; and a smaller
to those under that age. A plan was now discovered, to take away
a sixteen oared boat; but to guard against this, and all other
similar attempts, a centinel was placed on the wharf; and no boat
suffered to leave the cove without the knowledge of the officer
of the guard. The native, Cole-be, who had lately attached
himself to Mr. White, came one day with a musquet in his hand,
which he found at the bottom of the sea while diving; it was
thought to have belonged to one of the men who were drowned with
Mr. White's boat. The Supply did not return from Norfolk Island
till the 30th of May, and her long absence began to cause great
anxiety, which was accounted for on her arrival, as she had been
driven off by contrary winds for ten days. The provisions at
Norfolk Island were likewise low, and it was found to produce an
evident effect on the countenances of the convicts, having
suffered so much from the same cause before. On the 4th of June,
the Governor named the town marked out at Rose-Hill, Paramatta.
The good understanding which had commenced with the natives,
induced them to bring fish to Paramatta, and exchange it for a
little bread or salt meat; but that depravity which had hitherto
distinguished the convicts, nearly put an end to it, by
destroying a canoe belonging to Ballooderry, a native; and though
all the convicts concerned in destroying the canoe were punished,
the native was not satisfied, so threw a spear and wounded one
not concerned in the mischief, which made the Governor, forbid
Ballooderry coming near the settlement. This alarmed the natives
in general, and they kept away for some time. On the 19th of
July, arrived the Mary-Ann transport, from England, with 141
female convicts, six children, and one free woman on board, and a
small lot of provisions. The Governor made known, that no
obstacles would be placed in the way, of those whose times were
expired that might wish to return to England, if they could
induce the masters of any ships that came to convey them thither.
The Matilda transport arrived on the 1st of August, after a
passage of only four months and five days from Portsmouth; she
brought 205 male convicts, a few of the New South Wales corps,
and provisions for them for nine months after landing. The
Governor placed twelve convicts who wished to become settlers, in
a range of farms at the foot of Prospect-Hill, West of Paramatta
about four miles, and fifteen others he placed in the district
named the Ponds, in a North-East direction, two miles from
Paramatta, and finding the lots of ground he was instructed to
retain, on each side of the grants of land, as crown land, would
affect the interest of the settlers, he determined in such cases
to deviate from that plan; for the natives taking advantage, of
the distance settlers lived from each other, actually went and
destroyed the hut of one, and would have murdered him, had not an
armed settler accidentally made his appearance. On the 20th, the
Atlantic arrived from Plymouth, with a party of the New South
Wales corps, and 220 male convicts, and the next morning, the
Salamander arrived; she likewise had on board a party of the New
South Wales corps, and 160 male convicts, with an allowance of
nine months' provisions. The latter was ordered to proceed with
her cargo to Norfolk Island. On the 28th, the William and Ann
arrived, likewise with a party of military and 131 male convicts.
The town now filling fast, and spirits finding their way on
shore, it was ordered, that any found without a permit from the
Judge-Advocate should be seized. Ballooderry, with some of his
friends, at length ventured into town, but on an attempt to seize
him he threw a spear, on which, they were fired on, but only one
of Ballooderry's companions were wounded, and they all escaped.
The business of this month was principally confined to clearing
the transports, and removing the shingles with which the houses
and other buildings had hitherto been thatched, and regular tiles
substituted; the land in all parts was preparing for sowing. On
the 3d of September, near 200 male convicts, and a party of the
New South Wales corps, went in the Salamander to Norfolk Island.
His Majesty's ship Gorgon, of 44 guns, Capt. Parker, arrived on
the 21st, she brought from the Cape of Good Hope, a considerable
quantity of live-stock, some of which died on board, however they
landed one bull-calf, 16 cows, 68 sheep, and 11 hogs, and 200
fruit-trees, and a quantity of corn and garden seed. By this ship
came a public seal for the colony, and a Commission empowering
the Governor to remit, either absolutely or conditionally, the
whole, or any part of the terms, for which any fellons might be
transported. On the 26th, the Active from England, and the Queen
from Ireland arrived in the cove; on board the Active was a party
of the new corps, 126 male, and 23 female convicts, and three
children. These ships had been very unhealthy during their
passage, and many of those in the Active and Queen complained
that they had not received a proper allowance of provisions. An
inquiry into the conduct of the master of the Queen took place
before the magistrates, when it appeared he had not acted
properly, and the Governor transmitted the proceedings, to the
Secretary of State. On a survey of the Supply, it was discovered,
after 6 months she would be unable to make a voyage to England,
it was therefore determined to, send her off directly. The
Albemarle came into the Cove, on the 13th of October, with 250
male and 6 female convicts, and 23 of the New South Wales corps.
A party of the convicts, in conjunction with some of the seamen,
made an attempt to seize the ship on the 9th of April, but was
prevented by Mr. George Brown, who hearing the alarm, armed, and
fired at one of them, and lodged the contents in his shoulder,
when they all ran below; on being secured, two of the ringleaders
were hung at the fore-yard arm, and two of the seamen who it
appeared had supplied the convicts with tools to saw their irons
off, where left at Madeira to be sent prisoners to England. On
the 14th of October, the Britannia, with 129 male convicts,
stores, and provisions, arrived; and on the 16th, the Admiral
Barrington, with a party of the new corps, 264 male convicts,
four free women, and one child. This ship brought 84 sick, who
were landed directly. On the 26th, the Atlantic sailed for
Norfolk Island, with Governor King and family, with other persons
for the settlement, and then was to proceed to Calcutta for
provisions. A party of convicts, on the 1st of November,
consisting of near twenty, absconded from Paramatta, taking a
week's provisions, under the idea of either finding a passage to
China, or a settlement where they might live without work. A
party went in search of them without effect, but a boat going
down the harbour a few clays after, found the wife of one of the
convicts who had absconded with him; however she had been absent
from the party three days, and had wandered by herself; the next
day a boat brought her husband back to the settlement. They both
gave the same account of the intentions of the whole party, and
that they had suffered much by fatigue, heat of the weather, and
hunger, Three more of these foolish people, were found by some
officers on an excursion, but did not readily surrender
themselves. They were sent to Paramatta, and careless of what
they before suffered, they a second time decamped, but parties
were sent in pursuit directly, and returned with thirteen of
those who first went off, in a state dreadfully exhausted, having
existed chiefly by sucking the wild honey-flower and shrubs. It
was generally imagined, that the distressed appearance of these
would deter all others from similar attempts; but more
effectually to guard against them, the Governor made known, that
in future the parties sent after any run-a-ways would have orders
to fire on them, or if brought back alive, they should be chained
together, and live on bread and water only for the rest of their
terms; and he told them also, that he understood they intended to
arm themselves and seize on the stores; but if any such attempt
was made, every man concerned should be put to death directly.
The Britannia, Mary-Ann, William and Ann, and Matilda, made an
excursion as an experiment to see how far it might answer the
purpose to visit this, coast as a whale fishery; but owing to the
badness of the weather few could be secured though several were
killed; but from the great numbers seen, the masters of the
vessels determined to give it another trial as soon as they could
refit, which they did with much the same success. On the 26th of
November, the Supply, Lieut. Ball, sailed for England, at which
time there were 921 acres of land thinned, cleared, and
cultivated. This month the mortality was so great that 50 male
and four female convicts died; and a servant of Mr. White's in
passing from his house to the kitchen, without his hat, was
deprived of sense and motion by a ray of the sun, and died the
next day. At twelve o'clock that day, the thermometer stood at
94&deg;&frac14;, and the wind was N.W. As the heat of the water
affected the quality, and assisted by the watering the
transports, considerably decreased the run of water, the Governor
ordered the stone masons gang, to cut tanks in the rocks, as
reservoirs, for water enough to last a considerable time. On the
3d of December, the Albemarle and Active sailed for India, and at
and after this time orders were given to all masters or captains
to deliver up any convicts or others, who might be found secreted
on board, the first opportunity, to the British Government. The
Gorgon sailed for England on the 18th of December.</p>
<p><b>1792.]</b></p>
<p>In January 1792, a convict fainted while dragging in a
brick-cart, he was removed and laid under a cart near the road
side, that he might be in the shade, and being weak fell asleep,
but on waking felt something tight round his' neck, which on
putting his hand to, proved a large snake, who on being disturbed
bit his lip. Two men passing took the snake away and killed it.
The poor fellow who was bit died the next morning. At Paramatta,
the bake-house was robbed by a fellow getting down the chimney,
and returning by the same passage with his booty. To prevent
riotous meetings of the convicts, an inclination for which now
shewed itself, the Governor issued a proclamation, declaring,
that if a riot took place in the night, that all absent from
their huts, would be considered guilty, and be punished
accordingly; and if it happened in the day time, all absent from
work would be implicated. At the same time all complaints were
directed to be made to the overseers, and any person not giving
information of any plan for a riot, was to be considered as a
principal. On the 14th of February, the Pitt, Capt. Manning, from
England, came into the Cove, onboard of which was Francis Grose,
Esq. with the appointment of Lieutenant-Governor of the
settlement, and Major-Commandant of the New South Wales corps, a
part of which came with him; there came likewise, 319 male and 49
female convicts, 5 children, and 7 free women, with provisions
for that number for 10 months, and a sloop in frame of 41 tons
burthen. The Governor gave permission for a shop to be opened for
the sale of articles brought out in the Pitt, which sold at great
prices, in consequence of the uncertainty of receiving other
supplies from England. In March the Pitt sailed for Norfolk
Island with provisions, and from thence was to proceed to Bengal.
April and May were distinguished by disease and mortality, many
died, and a great number were, with illness and shortness of
provisions, rendered, so weak as to be incapable of labour. The
mortality and depredations were chiefly confined to the convicts
who came from Ireland in the Queen. The continual depredations at
length, in May 1792, met with a temporary check, for the Governor
ordered, that any body convicted, should be sent to cultivate the
new grounds beyond Paramatta; thus losing the comforts of a hut
and garden, as well as the pleasures of being in society, and so
powerfully did this operate, that one attempted suicide to avoid
it. But the natives, in May, were detected robbing the
settlements beyond Paramatta of corn, 15 or 16 were observed to
come from a hut dressed in such clothing as they could find, and
taking away corn in nets, it was first imagined they were
convicts, but on one attempting to throw a spear, the man who saw
them levelled his piece, and fired at him who dropped his spear,
and they all fled, leaving the corn in the nets. A few days
afterwards, a convict was butchered by the natives; when the body
was found it was scarce cold, and at least 30 spear wounds in it.
At the end of this month, the corn was all housed in at
Paramatta, and as the ground became clear, the convicts were
detected, bringing in the corn they had before stolen and
secreted in the woods, and all such detected, were sent to the
new grounds. The employ about this time was building brick huts
in the room of those first made, which being formed of perishable
materials, were nearly destroyed.</p>
<p>The following lists of articles and prices, in the infantine
country of New South Wales, in May 1792, may at some future time,
if not at present, be deemed an object of curiosity.</p>

<p>[The following inserted into 2nd Edition]</p>
<blockquote>[Here by the way, it is worth observing how much the
conveniences and comforts of the colony had increased in 1810,
when out of 10,452 inhabitants, only 4,277 were wholly, or in
great part, victualled from the public store, and when
three-fifths of the corn brought to market are purchased by the
Governor at a price, over which, from the largeness of the
demand, he has always a power of controul. The ground in
cultivation at this period amounted to rather more than 21,000
acres, and 74,000 acres were held in pasture. The stock too was
considerable: by the return in 1810, the amount was, horses 524,
mares 593, bulls 193, cows 6,351, oxen 4,782, sheep 33,818, goats
1,732, hogs 8,992. Of these but a small proportion were kept by
government, part of which are killed for the supply of the public
store, and the remainder made use of to stock the farms of new
settlers. And now for some years past, excepting when the crops
have failed through inundations of the river Hawkesbury, the
colony has been able wholly to supply itself with corn. At times
wheat and cattle have, in the courts of justice, been considered
as legal tender in the payment of debts. The maximum on the price
of grain and butchers' meat is no longer in existence, and though
a similar limit on the price of labour had been attempted, this
also had always been either evaded or disregarded.]</blockquote>
<p>In June, the progress of the diseases abated considerably,
though the ration was obliged to be lowered, but they were
promised to be made up when supplies arrived, and all were
exhorted to do the best they could to ensure a good stock for the
next season, as there was every prospect of enough being produced
then at Paramatta, to last the settlement for twelve months.
However, on the 20th, the Atlantic store-ship came into the Cove
from Calcutta, with provisions, when the following ration was
issued for each marine and male convict for a week, 7lbs. of
bread or flour, 7lbs. ditto of beef, or 4lbs. of pork, 3 pints of
pease, &frac12;lb. of rice, or 1lb. of flour, and two-thirds of
the above to each woman.</p>
<p>A market-place, with a clerk to keep accounts, was appointed
at Sydney, and at Paramatta, the Clerk had likewise to see that
no stolen goods were bought, sold, or exchanged. The harvest
being got in, the viler convicts began their depredations again,
on the property of individuals. Thus it seems that the fear of
going to the new grounds, was of no great duration, and though r
generally speaking, detection speedily followed the commission;
and punishment the conviction of the offenders, burglaries, and
every species of robbery, was continually practised, and the only
thing that could be lamented was, that what would have formed an
excuse in any other country, here encreased the crime, hunger!!!
for several declared, previous to punishment, that want of
provisions was the cause, and this was in a great measure proved,
for when the ration was at the full allowance there were by far
fewer crimes committed, than might be expected from such a
number, of SUCH people. On the 26th of July, the Britannia
store-ship anchored in the Cove, from Falmouth. This was one of
three ships, which were sent out with twelve months' cloathing,
for the convicts, four months' flour, and eight months' beef and
pork for 4639 persons at a full allowance; in consequence of
which, the Commissary next day issued to each man, 4lbs. of
maize, 3lbs. of soujee, 7lbs. of beef, or 4lbs. of pork, 3lbs. of
pease, or dholl, and &frac12;lb. of rice; two-thirds of a man's
allowance, was issued to every woman and child above ten years
old, and one-fourth of a man's ration to children under two years
old. The Governor, in July, pardoned Elizabeth Perry, who came
over in 1790, as James Ruse, a settler, had married her, which,
with her own prudent conduct added to her husband's industry,
procured this kindness from the Governor, and in this and most
other cases, the hand of mercy, it was found, was extended with
good effect, as by far the greater part of those who were
pardoned, behaved with the greatest propriety. On the 30th of
September, as the Britannia was about sailing out, the Atlantic
hove in sight, and at night, entered the Cove, from Norfolk
Island. Governor King complained of a grub doing material injury
to the corn, which was thought to be produced by the great
richness of the soil. That valuable article, limestone, was at
length discovered in Norfolk Island, where it grew in great
abundance, which superceeded the necessity of continually
rebuilding of barracks, store-houses, huts, &amp;c. The officers
of New South Wales engaged the master of the Britannia, to make a
voyage to the Cape of Good Hope on their account, for cattle and
other articles not to be found in the stores.</p>
<p>On the 7th of Oct. the Royal Admiral East Indiaman, Capt.
Bond, arrived with stores and provisions for the colony, and 21
of the New South Wales corps, a master miller, and a person to be
employed in cultivation, and a third as master carpenter, with
289 male, and 47 female convicts. The Britannia sailed on the
24th for the Cape, and Mr. Raven took the Governor's dispatches
for England, in which he demanded a supply of 12 months'
provisions directly. A licence was granted for the sale of
porter, but as spirits were introduced, it in fact, became a
public house, with its usual accompaniments, drunkenness and
idleness. At the latter end of the month a general delivery of
cloathing, &amp;c. to the convicts took place, which consisted of
two frocks, two pairs of trowsers, one pair of stockings, one
hat, one pair of shoes, 1lb. of soap, three needles, a quarter of
a pound of thread, and a comb to each male; and to the females
were delivered one cloth petticoat, one shift, one pair of shoes,
one pair of stockings, 1lb. of soap, a quarter of a pound of
thread, two ounces of pins, six needles, one thimble, and a pair
of scissars. Of the quality of these, articles not much can be
said in favour of, they were literally made only to sell!!!</p>
<p>October closed, with a melancholy circumstance, to the
feelings of those who valued real worth, it was Governor
Phillip's making known, his determination of quitting his
Government and returning in the Atlantic to England, as his
health was on the decline, and he hoped by a change of air
shortly to reinstate it. The 1st of November, was distinguished
by the arrival of the Philadelphia brigantine, Patrickson master,
from Philadelphia, who having heard of our distress for want of
provisions, at the Cape of Good Hope, made the best of his way to
England, and from thence to Philadelphia, and getting his cargo
on board, sailed here with beef, wine, rum, gin, tobacco, pitch,
and tar. The Governor bought as much for the public store as
amounted to 2829<i>l</i>. 11s. and the rest of his cargo was sold
to the officers to great advantage. The Governor hired this
vessel at the expense of 150<i>l</i>. to go to Norfolk Island
with provisions and stores.</p>
<p>Having now reached that period, of the History of New South
Wales, in which I find it requisite, as a faithful historian of
the country, to introduce myself, I must beg leave to make use of
the words of that truly respectable author, and esteemed
gentleman, Capt. Collins, who has recorded the event which took
place on the 3d of November, 1792, in a way which, while it
records the truth, will ever be my pride to merit.</p>
<p>"On the 3d of the month three warrants of emancipation passed
the seal of the territory: one to John Trace, a convict who came
out in the first fleet; having but three months of his term of
transportation remaining, that portion of it was given up to him,
that he might become a settler. The second was granted to Thomas
Restil, (alias Crowder,) on the recommendation of the
Lieutenant-Governor of Norfolk Island, on condition that he
should not return to England during the term of his natural life,
his sentence of transportation being <i>durante vit&aelig;</i>.
The third warrant was made out in favour of one who, whatever
might have been his conduct when at large in society, had here
not only demeaned himself with the strictest propriety, but had
rendered essential services to the colony&mdash;George
Barrington. He came out in the Active; on his arrival the
Governor employed him at Toongabbe, (some new ground beyond
Paramatta), and in a situation that was likely to attract the
envy and hatred of the convicts, in proportion as he might be
vigilent and inflexible. He was first placed as a subordinate,
and shortly after as a principal watchman; in which situation he
was diligent, sober, and impartial; and had rendered himself so
eminently serviceable, that the Governor resolved to draw him
from the line of convicts; and with the instrument of his
emancipation, he received a grant of thirty acres of land in an
eligible situation near Paramatta. He was afterwards sworn in as
a peace officer. Here was not only a reward for past good
conduct, but an incitement to a continuance of it; and Barrington
found himself through the Governor's liberality, though not so
absolutely free as to return to England at his own pleasure, yet
enjoying the immunities of a free man, a settler, and a civil
officer, in whose integrity much confidence was placed."</p>
<p>On the 13th, the Royal Admiral sailed for Canton. Of the
private speculation brought out in this ship, they sold at Sydney
and at Paramatta to the amount of 3600<i>l</i>. and left articles
to be sold on commission to the amount of 750<i>l</i>. more.</p>
<p>On the 18th, the Kitty transport anchored in the Cove, from
England, this vessel seemed particularly unfortunate, for the
colony at least. She sailed twice from England, on first sailing
she had on board 10 male and 30 female convicts, but a leak
obliging her to put back to Spithead, eight of the 10 male
convicts escaped, and when her cargo was landed, the flour was
damaged, and a quantity of iron pots, of which the colony was in
the greatest want, were either cracked or broken. In this ship
arrived two chests of dollars, amounting to 1001<i>l</i>. These
were sent for the use of Government, and became a very convenient
species of circulating currency. The brick hospital at Paramatta,
consisting of two wards, was finished this month. On Tuesday, the
11th of December, the Atlantic being prepared for the reception
of the Governor, his Excellency quitted the colony, having
faithfully discharged the trust which his Majesty had reposed in
him; and with him embarked cheerfully two natives, Bennillong,
and Yem-mer-ra-wan-nic, two men attached to his person.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<p><b>1793.]</b></p>
<p><small>ON</small> Governor Phillip leaving the island, land
had been granted to settlers, amounting to 3470 acres, of which
417&frac12; acres was cultivated, and the timber was cleared from
100 acres more, and 1012&frac34; acres only was cleared and in
cultivation on the public account, which shews, that a small
number of convicts, working on their own accounts, effected more
good than the whole body did while labouring for government; but
as so much was got in a proper state for cultivation, it
foretold, that at no very distant date, the colony would be able
to support itself, without assistance from the mother country.
Previous to his departure, Governor Phillip gave to each married
settler from the convicts, and to every settler from the marines
and from the Sirius, a ewe for breeding, and to others such goats
as could be spared. These liberal presents, which might have been
productive of such great comfort to these people, where however
soon offered for sale, and had not the officers bought them, a
few days would have put out of existence, a stock which had been
procured with emense trouble, and great expense. The Government
of the country was now invested in Francis Grose, Esq.
Major-Commandant of the New South Wales corps, who adopted
military instead of civil officers; it was not obvious why this
alteration was, made, as no evil had resulted hitherto from the
departments being filled by civil officers; but probably it might
arise from Governor Grose, being a military man. Early in
December, an American ship, the Hope, Page, master, from Rhode
Island, arrived, who said he put into the cove, for wood and
water, but more probably to sell a cargo he had on board of
provisions and spirits, of which was purchased to the amount of
2957<i>l</i> 6s. 6d. Of the regulations made by the new Governor,
were the dispensing with the officer's guard, and differing the
time of labour to the convicts, so as to allow them more time for
then selves. The weather during December was excessively hot, and
the wind blew from the Northward of West; and to add to the heat
of the atmosphere, the natives set fire to the grass, and for a
great distance the country was in flames. The thermometer, in the
shade, rose above an hundred degrees. At Paramatta and Toongabbe,
(a place beyond Paramatta,) the country was on fire, and a spark
from a tree which was burning, fell upon a thatched hut, in which
some people, lived belonging to Mr. Arndell, it caught fire, and
was with the outhouses, and 30 bushels of wheat, consumed in a
few minutes. In this year death caused a decrease in the colony
of 482 persons. January the 16th, 1793, the Bellona transport
anchored in the Cove, from England, with a cargo of stores and
provisions for the colony, 17 female convicts, and five settlers
with their families; among the stores were five pipes of port
wine, some rum, and 3000lbs. of tobacco; and it was very much to
be lamented, that a large quantity of the most useful articles in
the cargo were spoilt. On the 18th a melancholy accident took
place; the wife of Williams, a settler, with a child, and the
wife of a man named Green, had been drinking with Williams and
others, at Sydney, and were going in a small boat to Paramatta,
with a bag of rice belonging to Green, and as some water got to
it, she endeavoured to move the bag, and in the attempt overset
the boat, when both women and the child were drowned. Williams
and his wife were remarkable for vileness; just before entering
the boat they fought, and she had imprecated every evil to befall
her if she returned to Paramatta with her husband. The child was
taken from its mother's arms as she stink, but for want of aid in
time it died. The two women were found in a few days, and
Williams buried his wife and child within a few yards of his own
door, and to complete the measure of his iniquity, but a few days
after, he was sitting at his door with a bottle of rum, drinking
one glass and pouring another on the grave, till it was all gone,
declaring at each libation how well she loved it when alive. The
settlers who came out in the Bellona having fixed on their ground
in February, it was marked out, and they took possession, giving
their farms collectively the name of "<i>Liberty Plains</i>" as
they were all free settlers but one, which was Walter Rouse, a
very good man, by trade a bricklayer.</p>
<p>Government having given its assent, the officers made choice
of some land at Paramatta, and some in parts of the harbour, for
their own cultivation; each officer was allowed the use of 10
convicts, and as they entered vigorously into cultivation, and
being allowed to pay the convicts in spirits, for working, in
that time which belonged to themselves, they got on prodigiously
fast. The Bellona sailed on the 19th for Canton, previous to
which, the master was suffered to take on board, two convicts
whose terms had expired, and to prevent any getting off without
leave of the Government, the master permitted the ship to be
smoked, which produced four convicts who had found means to get
secreted on board. At length room was found wanting for the
stores, an event which had never occurred before, so that it was
an object of novelty and wonder. On the 25th of February, 1793,
the Shah Hormuzear, Bampton, from Calcutta, with a cargo on
speculation to this country, it consisted of live-stock, wine,
iron, copper, canvas, of the best qualities, and offered at such
prices as rendered them acceptable On the 13th of March two
Spanish ships anchored in the harbour. These two ships were on a
voyage of discovery from Spain, and were expected to put in here,
as Government sent out orders so long ago as 1790, to treat the
officers of this expedition with every attention. They were
called the Descuvierta and Atrevida, (the Discovery and
Intrepid,) the former commanded by Don Alexandro Malaspina,
commander of the expedition, and the latter by Bon Jose' de
Bustamante y Guevra. They requested permission to build an
observatory near the point of the Cove, on which the hut was
built for Bennillong, which hut they used as a magazine for their
instruments. The presence of these strangers, afforded a pleasing
variety to the uniformity of occurrences at Sydney. On the 21st,
returned the Kitty from Norfolk Island, whither she had been with
provisions, and Governor King, returned by her, many of such
characters, as he had reason to believe would occasion him
trouble; and he stated in his dispatches, that the harvest of
wheat and maize had proved so prolific, that he had enough for
twelve months. The people were healthy, and not one offence had
been committed, deserving punishment, for three months.</p>
<p>The master of the Shah Hormuzear, having submitted proposals
for procuring live-stock, an agreement was entered into for that
purpose, and Bengal settled to be the place from whence they
should come, as well as some provisions, for which purpose he
quitted the Cove on the 19th of April, in company with the
Chesterfield, having to carry, in conjunction with that ship,
provisions and stores to Governor King, at Norfolk Island, which,
with what he had already sent him, made enough for twelve months,
but as a signal for a strange sail was made, both ships waited to
know the event. The next day, the D&aelig;dalus store-ship,
Lieut. Hanson, from America, arrived; she left England with a
cargo of provisions for the use of the vessels under Capt.
Vancouver, and instead of bringing the settlement any material
relief, they wanted assistance, for she was to join Capt.
Vancouver at Nootka, or some of the Sandwich Islands, in the
following October. Lieut. Hanson touched at New Zealand, and
brought two natives, both young men, from that country, to
instruct the inhabitants of Norfolk Island in the manufacture of
the flax-plant; they arrived in time to go in the Shah Hormuzear;
they were put on board just before Mr. Bampton's ship sailed,
which, alas! never returned, as she became leaky and was run on
shore and scuttled in New Zealand.* On the 12th of April, between
5 and 6 in the evening, an appearance was observed in the North
West part of the sky, and seemed like a ray of forked lightning,
had been stationary in the sky for a quarter of an hour, but was
not discernable after the sun set. On a survey, made the latter
end of May, it appeared, that the officers who turned their
attention to cultivation, had cleared and cultivated 233 acres,
and had cut down wood from 219 acres more; every settler had
added to his kinds, and was approaching towards the station of an
independant farmer; the grounds of government had received no
addition whatever since the departure a of Governor Phillip,
since when 1575 acres had been granted, 830 of which lay between
Paramatta and Sydney, the Lieutenant-Governor wishing to make a
chain of farms from one settlement to the other.</p>
<p><small>[* The shocking sufferings of several of those on
board, will be found in the European Magazine for May and June
1797.]</small></p>
<p>On the 1st of June, the Kitty, which had undergone
considerable repairs, hauled into the Cove, and would have sailed
the next morning, but a mutiny was discovered, which required the
presence of the Lieutenant-Governor and the military to quell,
and the next day three seamen were taken from her, and replaced
by two convicts and a seamen. Provisions now began to get very
short, and a decrease in the ration was become requisite, but the
Lieutenant-Governor wishing to retard the evil day, proposed
staying one more week, previous to carrying into effect the
deduction. On the next Monday the Britannia returned, after an
absence of eight months; at the Cape of Good Hope she took on
board 30 cows, 3 mares, and 12 goats, with a quantity of flour,
sugar, tobacco, and spirits; but though the greatest attention
was paid to the live stock, 29 cows and 3 goats died. This
afforded another instance of the great difficulty in bringing
live-stock to the colony; which will be still more evident by the
following statement:</p>
<p>Embarked at various times for the colony, 15 bulls, 119 cows,
and 6 calves. Lost on their passage, 12 bulls, 91 cows, and 1
calf.<br>
Landed, 3bulls, 28 cows, and 5 calves.</p>
<p>Of horses, sheep, and hogs, a considerably larger portion were
landed safe, and it was imagined the mortality, among the black
cattle arose from their being taken from the field, and being
embarked, previous to being accustomed to dry victuals. The
natives now became troublesome, by lurking into the woods and
fields between the settlements, and robbing the convicts of their
clothing and provision as they passed; and as they wounded two or
three, an armed party was sent against them to discharge small
shot at them, but to take no life. But some on the contrary
resided at the settlement, and mixed with the inhabitants without
reserve, and were hired by many to collect fire-wood, or faring
water from the tanks, and esteemed themselves well paid for the
trouble, by an old worn out jacket, trowsers or a bit of bread,
indeed they wood beg for the latter with the greatest
earnestness, being particularly fond of it.</p>
<p>On the 1st of July, the D&aelig;dalus sailed to join Capt.
Vancouver, and was suffered to take, six convicts and two seamen
to complete her number of hands, and a native embarked, whom the
Lieutenant-Governor sent for the purpose of learning the English
language; his native name was Gnung-a-gnung-a Mur-re-mur-gan, but
he was universally called "Collins", after the Judge-Advocate. He
was of a very mild disposition, and readily undertook the voyage.
On Saturday, the 6th of July, the ration was reduced 1lb. of
pork. A church was now began, 73 feet by 15; it was to be
composed of strong posts, wattles, and plaster, and to be
thatched. As spirits continued to be made an improper use of, the
Lieutenant-Governor made known, that any person selling them,
without a licence would have it seized, and their houses pulled
down. This month the wheat sown on the public account was got in.
On the 24th, the vessel (now called the Francis) brought out in
frame by the Pitt, was got afloat, and as it was understood that
several persons had an idea of effecting their escape in her,
every precaution was taken, that none but trustworthy persons
should be employed on board.</p>
<p>On the 7th of August, the Boddingtons' transport, from Cork,
arrived with 124 male and 20 female convicts of Ireland on board,
and nine months' provisions for them. Advice came by this ship,
that another, the Sugar-Cane, might be shortly expected. On
Sunday, the 25th of August, divine service was performed in the
church.</p>
<p>In September, the settlers were enabled to sell to government
1200 bushels of Indian corn, at 5s. per bushel, which was the
price paid to all. On Sunday, the 8th, the Britannia and Francis
sailed for Dusky Bay. On Tuesday, the 17th, the Sugar-Cane
arrived, with 110 male and 50 female convicts. In the course of
the voyage a mutiny was discovered, and one convict found without
his irons was executed, which prevented any more mischief. This
ship brought for the colony<br>

<p>The Boddingtons' and Sugar-Cane both sailed on the 13th. A
mill for grinding corn was invented by a convict named Wilkinson,
which was found to answer so well, that the Lieutenant-Governor
ordered the artificers and a gang of convicts from Paramatta to
assist in making one, under Wiliamson's directions, on a larger
scale. A warrant of emancipation passed the great seal for 23
convicts, on condition of their entering into the New South Wales
corps. From Paramatta information was received, that four people,
in the night of the 15th, broke into the house of a settler,
(John Randall,) with their faces and hands blackened, where with
bludgeons, they nearly murdered two men who lived with him, and
but for the activity and resistance of these two, they would have
effected their intentions; and the same account said, that seven
of those lately from Ireland had absconded to the woods. On the
26th, a box belonging to John Sparrow, (a convict,) by trade a
watchmaker, was broke open at the hospital, and three watches
stolen, one of which belonged to an officer, who had employed
Sparrow to repair it, and an old man at the hospital was at the
same time robbed of eight guineas and some dollars, which he had
saved to pay his passage home. In a storm, on the 26th, two boys
ran to a tree for shelter, and the next morning were found dead,
being killed by lightning, and they were buried in one grave.
This was the first accident of the kind which had happened in the
colony. On the 29th, the Fairy American Snow, arrived from
Boston, in New England, and was to proceed to the North-West
coast of America. On Thursday, November 7th, the Francis returned
from Dusky Bay. On Saturday, the 23d of November, the first wheat
issued from the store, and the produce of the country was
delivered, and for the first week, great inconvenience was
sustained to get it ground, but other mills were erected, and
this evil was of no long duration. The wheat sown in April was
this month reaped and got in, which the Lieutenant-Governor
agreed to buy of all settlers to whom it belonged, at 10s. per
bushel. Guilty ignorance, every ready to cherish erroneous
notions, of escaping that punishment which it deserves, by some
flaw in the administration of justice, offered to the minds of
the convicts a curious idea, which was, that the
Lieutenant-Governor, had not the power of ordering a sentence of
death to be executed, so that it became requisite, to let them
see the contrary, which was done in executing John Crow, who was
convicted some time before, but had been respited twice. In a
storm, on the 6th of December, a boat which came from Paramatta
with corn, filled with water which ran off the wharf, and sunk,
by which 280 bushels of Indian corn and a few of wheaten meal
were lost, except to the natives, who were so fond of it that
many lived and brought up considerable quantities. Spirits gained
such an ascendency over the weak minded, that they refused
anything else in payment for labour while they were to be
obtained, and several officers' servants stole them from their
masters. Sydney had now increased, since Governor Phillip quitted
it 160 huts and 5 barracks. Towards the close of December, a
party of natives attacked several settlers, and taking all their
provisions, fled to the woods.</p>
<p>Passage boats were allowed now to go from Sydney to Paramatta.
These were the property of convicts who had served their time;
the fare was one shilling for each person, and all luggage was
paid 1s. per cwt. for. In the year 1793, there died 7 soldiers,
two settlers, 78 male convicts, 26 female convicts, and 29
children; and with accidents, &amp;c. the decrease was 153
persons.</p>
<p><b>1794.]</b></p>
<p>Amidst the variety of crimes continually committed in New
South Wales by the convicts, murder had hitherto been excluded,
but on the 5th of January, 1794, an elderly man, whose name was
Lewis, that went to watch the cattle, was shockingly murdered.
His body was found a few days afterwards in a hollow, covered
with logs, boughs, and grass; the hands, and flesh of one arm,
had been torn off by the native dogs. This poor fellow,
unfortunately, had boasted of having saved some money, and had
sewed it in his clothes to prevent losing it, should his hut be
robbed while he was out. The body was brought in and buried at
Paramatta, but no discovery could be made of who murdered the
poor man. Likewise on the 5th, the Francis sailed for Norfolk
Island, the Lieutenant-Governor, becoming anxious to know the
state of that settlement. On an account being taken of the salt
provisions at Sydney and Paramatta, only enough was found to last
for 10 weeks, at the ration of 8lbs. per week for a man. One of
the men employed by the officers to shoot game, having caught
three kangaroo's brought two in, and said he cut the other up for
the dogs, when in fact he had sold it to one Lane, a man who had
been a convict. To prevent thefts, the best way is certainly to
punish receivers, for without them there would be no temptations.
Under this idea, the Lieutenant-Governor ordered Lane to have 100
lashes, to be dependant on the store for provisions, and sent to
Toongabbe to labour. Notwithstanding the great crops of corn
gathered by the settlers, only 160 bushels were offered to
government, though it was ascertained that at least 7000 bushels
of wheat alone had been produced. Some kept it for distilling and
brewing, while others paid debts, contracted by gaming with it;
for the last indeed, some had gone so far as to lose their farms,
and others absolutely losing their clothes off their backs, went
<i>naked</i>. Ruse, the first settler, and one Williams, having
imprudently sold their farms, and spent the money they produced,
gained permission to begin new ones, about 24 miles from
Paramatta, with some others who were about settling. On the 12th
of February, the Francis returned from Norfolk Island. The
accounts from Governor King were highly satisfactory, the
harvest, which was abundant, was all got in, and every store in
such plenty as seemed to defy any idea of future want; the people
were all in good health, and the live-stock increasing rapidly.
The two natives of New Zealand, sent by the Shah Hormuzear,
answered the purpose so well, that though Governor King had few
hands and bad materials, a quantity of canvas was manufactured
weekly; but the New Zealanders, having shewn great anxiety to
return home, Governor King thought the Britannia's calling at
Norfolk Island a favourable opportunity, and embarked with a
guard and the two natives for New Zealand*, leaving Capt. Nepean
(who was on his return, to Europe by the Britannia), as Governor
in his absence. The passage was short, for on the 4th day the
natives were landed among some of their friends, and on the 10th
day, Governor King returned to Norfolk Island; and the second day
after the Britannia again sailed. Ten of the New South Wales
corps, were sent to Sydney from Norfolk Island for mutinous
conduct, and after a trial of five days were found guilty, but
recommended to mercy. The offence committed, was owing to a
jealousy which had arisen between the soldiers and free men,
settlers and others, occasioned by some acts of violence and
improper behaviour on both sides, which broke out one evening, at
a place the Lieutenant-Governor had permitted plays to be
represented by the convicts. Mr. King, who was present, thought
it necessary to order one of the soldiers into confinement. When
the play was ended, the detachment repaired to their commanding
officer, and demanded the release of their comrade; on his
declaring his inability to comply with such request, they
signified a resolution to release him themselves; upon which the
officer remonstrated with them, and they dispersed. On the
following morning, when the Lieutenant-Governor was made
acquainted with the circumstances, he convened all the officers
in the settlement, and laid before them what he had heard,
together with an account of a determination among the soldiers,
to release from the halberts any of their comrades who should be
ordered punishment, for any offence or injury done to a settler;
all of which he caused to be authenticated upon oath. The result
of the officers was, that the detachment should be disarmed, and
all those settlers from the marines and Sirius's ship's company,
should be embodied and armed as a militia to do their duty. This
was put in execution on the 21st, by sending the detachment from
their quarters unarmed, upon different duties; while the
new-raised militia took possession of their arms. On their
return, twenty were selected as mutineers to be sent to Sydney,
the remainder returning to their duty immediately (but of that
number ten were, after a few days confinement, pardoned and
liberated); and two days after the Francis appeared. At the
conclusion of February, the natives again caused great trouble,
robbing and doing every kind of mischief, and though they kept in
the woods near the settlements, and generally murdered all the
white people they could, yet so great was the dread of labour to
many of the convicts, that they absconded continually to the
woods, thus shewing that they preferred death to work. On the
last day of delivering provisions for February (the 22d), it was
found, that if some did not arrive in a fortnight, there would
not be an ounce left. Thus situated nothing was neglected. The
Shark was even found of service, and the oil produced from the
liver of it sold at 1s. per quart; candles were a luxury in the
colony which few could boast of. The Indian corn was now nearly
ripe, and as the seed wheat, was yet held sacred, it was hoped
that the Indian corn would be ready in time to prevent such a
fatal resource; for the stock of seed wheat, even if added to all
the live-stock, could last but a short time for so many as 3000
people. Providentially the very day that the last provisions were
delivered from the store, the 8th of March, a signal of a vessel
in sight was made, but by great wind and stormy weather, it was
the 10th when she anchored in the Cove, and proved to be the
William, Folger, of London, last from Cork, with a cargo of 1173
barrels of beef, and 907 of pork, but no flour. At the same time
arrived the Arthur, a small brig of 95 tons, from Bengal, with
beef, pork, sugar, rum, and calicos. In consequence of these
fortunate arrivals, the full ration was ordered to be delivered,
and the short allowances, as promised, made good, Distress which
had never yet encreased the morality of the convicts, now shewed
that the love of gaming could keep its ascendency over even
hunger itself. Of those adicted to gaming, one was an overseer,
who giving offence to some of the convicts, they formed a plan to
strip him, the first time they knew he had any considerable sum
about him; when engaged at play, a party rushed on him just as he
had won 25 dollars, and this at once secured them, but he seized
one with 10 dollars in his hand, which was all he recovered. The
overseer confessed, that it was owing to gaming only, that he
became a convict; thus, though under punishment for the effects,
he still retained a determination to practice the great cause, of
all evils which attended him. On the 3d of April, the
D&aelig;dalus, store-ship, anchored from the North-West coast of
America. The native who went out in this ship, returned without
acquiring much of our language, but he had rendered himself
particularly esteemed by every body in the ship. The Arthur
sailed on the same day as the D&aelig;dalus arrived, and the
Francis came in the next day from Norfolk Island. The good order
which reigned in Norfolk Island had rendered keeping the settlers
together as a militia, unnecessary. The natives continually
visited those parts where the corn was nearly ripe, and in such
numbers, that it was found requisite for the watchmen to fire on
them, and this order produced many tales from the men about the
natives coming in great numbers, and the valour of those who
drove them away; they were at length given no credit to, so in a
few days a watchman brought in the head of one native he had
shot. On the 24th. of May, the Indispensable, store-ship, arrived
from England; she was the first of six or seven ships that were
to bring out a supply of stores, provisions, and clothes for
twelve months, for the colony, in consequence of which a full
ration was ordered to be delivered; viz. 8lbs. of flour, 7lbs. of
beef, or 4lbs. of pork, and three pints of Indian corn, of which
latter article government had bought, of the settlers and others
6163&frac14; bushels. The Britannia returned on the 1st of June,
whose arrival had been anxiously expected. The length of her
absence was accounted for by her being forced to go to Batavia
instead of Bengal, as she was attacked in the Straits of Malacca,
by a fleet of piratical prows, from which she escaped after an
engagement of six hours. The Britannia brought 250 casks of beef,
250 casks of pork, 500 pecols of sugar, and 55 coyangs of rice.
On the 8th of June, arrived the Speedy, store-ship. On the 14th
the Halcyon, from Rhode Island, with a cargo of beef, pork,
spirits, tobacco, tea and nankeens, on speculation. The time was
now arrived when the colony wore a very comfortable appearance;
the stores were filled with provisions, and five ships on the
seas with a still greater abundance, a stock rapidly increasing,
and a crop of corn on the ground, which promised to realize the
fond hope, of New South Wales becoming independent of the mother
country for grain. On the 5th of July, the Hope arrived from
Rhode Island, with provisions and spirits. The spirits were
bought, but the provisions no one would buy. This was the first
instance of a vessel bringing provisions without being able to
dispose of them. The Indispensable and Halcyon sailed on the 8th
to complete their voyages to Bengal and Canton. On the 9th
arrived the Fancy, with a cargo of rice and dholl. In July a
building of four cells, for solitary confinement was added to the
guard-house on the East side of the Cove. On the 28th, the
Francis returned from Norfolk Island, whither she had been sent
to inform Governor King that supplies would speedily be sent him;
who in return sent information, that the harvest had been
prodigiously productive; that he had purchased 11000 bushels of
maize of the settlers, for the amount of which he had drawn
bills, but the Lieutenant-Governor thinking it not requisite to
put such an expense on the crown, declined accepting the bills
till he had the approbation of government. On the 1st of
September, the Britannia sailed, for the second time on a voyage
of speculation, on account of the officers, to the Cape of Good
Hope, for live-stock and other articles. On the 10th, arrived
from England, the Resolution; and on the 11th the Salamander,
both freighted with provisions and stores for the colony. The
heavy weather they had met with, considerably damaged the ships
and stores. By those vessels came intelligence, that John Hunter,
Esq. was appointed Governor of New South Wales, instead of Capt.
Phillip, who had resigned, and was rewarded by a pension of
500<i>l</i>. per annum. How highly to the credit of government
would it be, if pensions were granted to all those who equally
deserve them, and withheld from those who do not. Some of the
ignorant Irish convicts, this month seized a boat, but after an
absence of some time, landed at Botany Bay, which led to their
detection of course. On the 17th, a dreadful accident happened at
Paramatta; a building in which was 2400 bushels of maize caught
fire, and was consumed with a number of fine hogs. In the course
of September, it became requisite to treat the natives with
severity. A settler, and his servant, at Hawkesbury, were nearly
murdered by the natives who stole on them so privately, as not to
be discovered, till they had got so near as to prevent their
getting assistance. A few days after, the natives attacked some
others, and carried off every thing they could find; but the
settlers collectively followed, with arms, and killed eight on
the spot. The D&aelig;dalus sailed, for Norfolk Island, on the
26th, with provisions and stores, and the wives of Bennillong and
his companion, who wished to withdraw from the other natives,
till the return of Bennillong and his companion from England. On
the 29th, the Fancy sailed. In the beginning of October, John
Bevan, a most daring fellow, was caught in the act of
house-breaking, he was tried on the first, and executed on the
sixth; the evening before which, a murder was perpetrated by one
Hill, a butcher, on the body of Simon Brown, a settler, who he
owed an animosity. It appeared on the trial, that Hill, and a
woman he lived with, had quarrelled, when she to avoid a beating,
flew to an empty house followed by Hill, and poor Burn to prevent
Hill from beating her, interfered, on this the rascal Hill,
stabbed him to the heart, of which wound he died in an hour. Hill
the fiend of iniquity, was executed on the 16th, and
dissected.</p>
<blockquote>[* The following account of the Flax Manufactory, on
the New Zealanders leaving Norfolk Island, can hardly prove
unacceptable:<br>
<br>
Not more than nine men and nine women could be employed in
preparing and manufacturing the flax, which barely kept them in
practice. There was only one loom on the island, and the slay or
reed designed for coarse canvas; nor did they possess a single
tool required by flax-dressers or weavers, beyond the poor
substitutes which they were obliged to fabricate themselves. If
there had been proper slays or reeds, brushes, and other articles
indispensably necessary for flax-dressing and weaving, with more
people to work the flax and a greater number of weavers, this
island might soon require very little assistance in clothing the
convicts; but for want of these necessary articles, the only
cloth that could be made was a little canvas something finer than
No. 7, which is thought to be equally strong and durable as that
made from European flax.<br>
<br>
This useful plant needs no cultivation. An experiment has been
made to cultivate it, and answered extremely well; but the
produce was not so much superior to that growing in a natural
state as to make it advisable to bestow any pains on its
culture.<br>
<br>
Before the arrival of the two New Zealanders, no effectual
progress had been made in its manufacture; nor was it without
much intreaty that these visitors were induced to furnish the
information required. And indeed, as this work is principally
performed by the women in New Zealand, they were by no means
competent to give the fullest instructions. Sufficient however
was obtained from them to improve upon. Since that time those
women that could be spared from other work, not exceeding from
six to twelve, had been employed in preparing the flax; and a
flax-dresser, weaver, and three other assistants, in
manufacturing it into canvas, rope, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
When the leaves are gathered, the hard stalk running through the
centre is taken out with the thumbnail; and the red edges of the
leaf are also stripped off. The two parts are then separated in
the middle, making four slips of about three-quarters of an inch
wide, and the length of from eighteen inches to three or four
feet. These slips are cut across the centre with a muscle-shell,
but not so deep as to separate the fibres, which is the flax. The
slips thus prepared are held in the left hand, with the thumb
resting on the upper part of the slip just above the cut. The
muscle-shell held in the right hand is placed on the upper part
just below the cut, with the thumb resting on the upper part. The
shell is drawn to the end of the slip, which separates the
vegetable covering from the flaxen filaments. The slip is then
trimmed, and the same operation is performed on the remaining
part, which leaves the flax entire. If it be designed for fishing
lines, or other coarse work, nothing more is done to it; but if
intended for cloth, it is twisted and beaten for a considerable
time in a clear stream of water; and when dried, twisted into
such threads as the work requires. Instead of working it as soon
as gathered, our people found it work better for being placed in
a heap in a close room for five days or a week, after which it
became softer and pleasanter to work. They also found it easier,
and more expeditious, to scrape the vegetable covering, from the
fibres, which is done with three strokes of a knife. It is then
twisted, and put into a tub of water, where it remains until the
day's work is finished. The day following it is washed and beaten
in a running stream. When sufficiently beaten it is dried, and
needs no other preparation, until it is hackled and spun into
yarn for weaving.<br>
<br>
The numbers employed at this work were as follow;<br>

<br>
by whose weekly labour sixteen yards of canvas of the size of No.
7 was made. It is to be remarked, that the women, and most of the
men, could be employed at no other work; and that the labour of
manuring and cultivating the ground; the loss of other crops; the
many processes used in manufacturing the European hemp, and the
accidents to which it is liable during its growth, are all, by
using this flax, avoided, as it needs no cultivation, and grows
in sufficient abundance on all the cliffs of the island (where
nothing else will grow) to give constant employment to five
hundred people. Indeed, should it be thought an object, any
quantity of canvas, rope or linen, might be made there, provided
there were men and women, weavers, flax-dressers, spinners, and
rope-makers, with the necessary tools; but destitute as our
people were of these aids, all that could be done was to keep in
employ the few that could be spared from other essential
work.]</blockquote>
<p>The settlers at Hawkesbury, now seemed to require some person
of authority to be present, for an account was received, that the
natives were urged to their late depredations, by an act of
cruelty, to a native boy, whom the settlers had tied hands and
feet together, and dragging him several times through a fire,
threw him into a river and then shot him, this they in part
acknowledged, but assigned as the cause that the boy had been
sent among them as a spy. In the evening of the 25th, arrived the
Surprize transport from England, with 60 females 23 males, and
some few stores and provisions, among these convicts were Mess.
Muir, Palmer, Skirving and Margarot, convicted in Scotland for
sedition. On the 23d of November, the D&aelig;dalus returned from
Norfolk Island. Several whose sentences had expired, and ten
settlers who gave up their farms in consequence of their bills
for corn not being honoured, had now entered into the New South
Wales corps, arrived in this vessel.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant-Governor meaning to quit the country by the
D&aelig;dalus, proper preparations were made, which being
completed the Lieutenant-Governor with Mr. White, Mr. Laing,
three soldiers, two women, and nine men, embarked. On the 15th,
before the departure of the Lieutenant-Governor, those convicts
under confinement were released, and allotments of land made to
those who wished it. During December, a farm of 25 acres was sold
by auction for 13<i>l</i>. The frequent failures of those who
attempted to escape from the colony, either by stealing boats or
going to the woods, by no means lessened the desire of others,
though seldom many days expired without their returning
themselves, or being taken and brought back. On the 24th arrived
the Experiment Snow, front Bengal, with a few provisions,
spirits, sugar and piece-goods, on speculation. On the departure
of Lieutenant-Governor Grose, the government devolved on Captain
William Paterson, of the New South Wales corps. The loss by death
in 1794, was only 59 persons.</p>
<p><b>1795.]</b></p>
<p>In January, 1795, the attention was turned to preparing the
ground for wheat. The Indian corn, which was now ripening about
Hawkesbury, promised at least 30,000 bushels of that grain. Some
of the young natives, who lived among the settlers became so
useful, that they would in three or four hours do as much work as
was allotted to a convict for a day's work. At this time the
heavy rains swelled the river Hawkesbury to such a degree, that
considerable damage was done to the crops of the settlers and
government. A bridge at Paramatta, was swept away by the torrent.
No doubt now remained of the bad conduct of some of the settlers
toward the natives. In revenge they threatened to put to death
three of the settlers, Doyle, Forester, and Nixon; and had
actually attacked and wounded two other settlers, Shadrech and
Akers, whose farms and persons they mistook for those of Doyle
and Forester's. These particulars were procured through the means
of one Wilson, a very wild young man, who, his term of
transportation being expired, preferred living among the natives
in the vicinity of the river, to earning the wages of honest
industry by working for settlers. He had formed a strange medley
language between his own and theirs, with which he made shift to
comprehend something of what they wished him to communicate; for
they did not conceal the sense they entertained of the injuries
which had been clone to them. The tribe with whom Wilson
associated had given him a name, Bun-bo-&eacute;. As the
gratifying a wandering disposition was the sole object with
Wilson in herding with these people, no good consequence was
likely to ensue from it. Mr. Grimes purposed taking him with him
in the schooner to Port Stephens.</p>
<p>There were at this time, several convicts in the woods
subsisting by theft; and it being said, that three had been met
with arms, it became necessary to secure them as soon as
possible. Watchmen and other people immediately went out, and in
the afternoon of the 14th, a fellow of the name of Suffini was
killed by them. This circumstance drove the rest to a greater
distance from Sydney, and they were reported, some days
afterwards, to have been met on their route to the river. Suffini
would not have been shot at, had he not refused to surrender when
called to by the watchman while in the act of plundering a
garden.</p>
<p>About the latter end of the month the natives adjusted some
affairs of honour near the brick-fields. The people who live
about the South shore of Botany Bay brought with them a stranger
of an extraordinary appearance and character; his name was
G&ograve;me-boak. He had been several days on his journey from
the place where he lived, which was far to the southward. In
height he was not more than five feet two or three inches; but he
was by far the most muscular, square, and well-formed native ever
seen. He fought well; his spears were remarkably long, and he
defended himself with a shield which covered his whole body. He
engaged with some of the Sydney natives, and it was observed,
that neither their persons or reputation suffered any thing in
the contest. When the fight was over, our officers praising the
martial talents of this stranger, the very great strength of his
arm, and the excellence of his sight, they admitted the praise to
be just (because when opposed to them, he had not gained the
slightest advantage); but unwilling that they should think more
highly of him, than themselves, with distorted features they
assured the officers, that G&ograve;me-boak was a cannibal, well
knowing that alone would disgust them with him.</p>
<p>On the 1st of March, the Francis returned from Port Stephens.
Mr. Grimes reported that he went into two fresh-water branches,
up which he rowed, and at no very great distance from the
entrance, he found them terminate in a swamp. He described the
land on each side as low and sandy, and had seen nothing while in
this harbour, which in his opinion could render a second visit
necessary. The natives were so unfriendly, that he made but few
observations on them. He thought them both a taller and a stouter
race of people than those about this settlement, and their
language was entirely different. Their huts and canoes were
something larger than those which we had seen here; but their
weapons the same. They welcomed him on shore with a dance,
joining hand in hand, round a tree, probably to express their
unanimity; one of them after this, drawing Mr. Grimes into the
wood, poised a spear, and was op the point of throwing it, when
he was prevented by young Wilson, who Mr. Grimes took with him:
he had followed Mr. Grimes with a double-barrelled gun, and now
levelling at the native, he fired it. He was supposed to be
wounded, for he fell; but rising again, he attempted a second
time to throw the spear, and was again prevented by Wilson. The
effect of this second shot was supposed to be conclusive, as he
was not seen to rise any more. Mr. Grimes now regained his boat
without any other interruption.</p>
<p>The Britannia, on the 4th returned from the Cape of Good Hope.
Mr. Raven, the commander, brought alive to his employers, 1
stallion, 29 mares, 3 fillies, and 12 sheep. He sailed from the
Cape with 40 mares onboard; but those that died were the
worst.</p>
<p>As salt provisions now again grew low, half the allowance of
pork and beef was deducted at once; but, the same day, the
Britannia was lured to go to India for provisions, and to render
this deduction as light as possible, the Commissary purchased a
quantity of fresh pork from the settlers, which was issued at the
rate of 2lbs. of fresh, instead of 1lb. of salt. The Francis
returned on the 21st, from Hawkesbury, with 1100 bushels of
Indian corn, and about that time information was received
overland, that the natives and settlers, had commenced open war,
and that two people, a settler and a free labourer, were killed.
Their depredations were managed with great art, and if that
failed they made use of force, using their spears and clubs.
Capt. Paterson sent an armed party, to destroy all they could
meet with of this tribe. The savages in return attacked a farm
belonging to William Rowe, and murdered him and a line child; his
wife, after being very much wounded, crawled away, and hid
herself among the rushes for some time, till assisted and carried
to the hospital, when she recovered very slowly, in consequence
of this, a party of soldiers were distributed among the settlers,
which afforded them that protection which it would have been well
had they deserved.</p>
<p>On the 31st of May, anchored in the Cove, the Endeavour, of
800 tons, from Bombay, under the command of Mr. Bampton, with 132
head of cattle, some rice, and all the other articles except the
salted provisions contracted for by Lieutenant-Governor Grose.
The Britannia sailed for India on the 18th. The usual attendants
on a short ration shortly appeared; private stocks were robbed,
and huts broke open; but as many were caught, a rascal, to
prevent that detection he would probably meet with, if he broke
into a hut, hit upon a new plan; he stole a greyhound, which he
killed, and sold to the hungry for kangaroo, at nine-pence per
pound. The Providence, of 28 guns, Capt. Broughton, from England,
arrived, she had been driven Northward as far as Port Stephens,
where Capt Broughton found and took on board four miserable
objects of men, who had escaped from Sydney, in 1790, and from
the wretched boat which they stole, every one thought they must
have been drowned. The tale they told furnished amusement to
gaping crowds for some days; it seemed that having made Port
Stephens, they lived like the savages, but the food by no means
agreed with them. Each had a name and a wife given him by the
natives, and two of them had children. The natives fed them, and
they were considered by them as unfortunate creatures, entitled
to their protection, and as they and the natives began to
understand each other, they impressed on the minds of the poor
savages an idea, that they were the spirits of their ancestors,
and one poor native so truly believed it, that he seemed to
recognize the features of his father in one of the convicts, and
took him to the place where his father was burnt. The Fancy
arrived on the 3d of September, from Norfolk Island, where plenty
abounded; 4000lbs. of pork had been salted, and the Governor
offered 40 tons of salt provisions he had, and could spare to the
settlement at Sydney. On the 7th of September, the Supply and
Reliance arrived, the latter of which vessels, had Governor
Hunter on board. His Excellency took upon him the office of
Governor on the 11th, but previous to Capt. Paterson's giving up
the command, he pardoned those in confinement. The first act of
Governor Hunter was, to order a very exact return of the
live-stock, and a particular account of every person in the
country to be taken (except the military), and he advised the
cultivation of Indian corn to its full extent, for the purpose of
feeding the live-stock; and his Excellency accepted, those bills
for corn bought at Norfolk Island, which his predecessor refused.
On the 18th of September, the Fancy and Endeavour sailed for
India; leave was given for 50, whose terms of transportation had
expired, to quit the colony in the Endeavour, and nearly the same
number quilted without leave in that one vessel, which was a
serious loss. In the beginning of October, civil magistrates were
substituted for military ones. On the 4th, the store-ship, Young
William, anchored in the Cove, with a cargo of provisions, with
which being overloaded, she was much damaged. In consequence of
this supply the ration was considerably improved. On the 13th the
Providence sailed for Nootka Sound; on the 16th, the Supply for
Norfolk Island; and on the 29th the Young William for Canton. On
the 5th of November, the Sovereign arrived laden with provisions.
By this ship arrived Mr. Hibbins, as Deputy Judge-Advocate.</p>
<p>On the 7th, Smith and Whitehouse were tried for, and found
guilty of, breaking into a house, stripping it, destroying the
live-stock, and cruelly beating a servant; on the 16th they were
led to execution when the Governor pardoned Whitehouse. A
printing press, never before used, though brought out by Governor
Phillip was now set to work, and ail orders were printed. On the
20th, the Supply returned from Norfolk Island, and brought the
unpleasant intelligence, that the Lieutenant-Governor was very
ill; and owing to the rats, and a weed called cow-itch,
cultivation was much injured.</p>
<p>Several contests which had lately taken place in Sydney and
its neighbourhood, among the natives, were attended by many of
those who inhabited the woods, and came from a great distance
inland. Some of the prisoners gathering from time to time rumours
of the existence of our cattle lost in 1788, two of them resolved
on ascertaining the truth of these reports, and tried by
different excursions, to discover their retreat. On their return
from the first, subsequent to the Governor's arrival, they
reported, that they had seen them. Being, however, at that moment
too much engaged in perfecting the civil regulations for the
settlement, the Governor could not go to that part of the country
in which where they were said to have been found; but detatched
Henry Hacking. His report was so satisfactory, that on the 18th,
the Governor set off from Paramatta, attended by a small party,
Capt. Collins, Capt. Waterhouse, and Mr. Bass, when after
travelling two days, in a direction S.S.W. from the settlement at
Prospect Hill, he crossed the river named the Nepean; and to his
great surprize and satisfaction, fell in with a fine herd of
cattle, upwards of 40 in number, grazing in a pleasant and
fertile pasturage. The day being far advanced when he saw them,
he rested for the night, hoping in the morning to see the whole
herd. A doubt had arisen, of their being cattle produced from
what were brought from the Cape; as it was thought they might be
of longer standing; the Governor thought it worth determining,
and directed the attendants in the morning to procure and kill a
calf. This they were not able to effect; for while lying in wait
for the herd to pass (now seen to consist of upwards of sixty
young and old,) they were furiously set upon by a bull, who
brought up the rear, and which they killed in their own defence.
This answered the purpose better perhaps than a calf, for he had
all the marks of the Cape cattle when full grown, wide spreading
horns, a moderate rising or hump between his shoulders, and a
short thin tail Being at this time 38 miles from Paramatta,
little of the meat could be sent in.</p>
<p>The country where they were found grazing was remarkably
pleasant; every where was thick and luxuriant grass; the trees
were thinly scattered, and free from underwood; several beautiful
flats presented large ponds, covered with ducks and black swans,
and the ground rose from these levels into gently rising
hills.</p>
<p>Those lost in 1788, two bulls and five cows, must have
travelled in a western direction until they came to the banks of
the Nepean, and finding the crossing easy, they came at once into
a country well-watered and stored with grass. Thus finding
themselves in possession of a pasture equal to their support, and
in which they remained undisturbed; and as few natives were to be
seen near there, they were likely to remain for years unmolested,
to propagate their species.</p>
<p>It was a happy circumstance to have in the woods of New South
Wales a thriving herd of wild cattle. Proposals were made to
bring them into the settlement; but if these had been sacrificed,
in what better condition would the colony have been for having
possessed <i>a fine herd of cattle in the woods?</i> which, as
observed by Capt. Collins, "if suffered to remain undisturbed for
some years, would, like the cattle of South America, always prove
a market sufficient for the inhabitants of the country; and
perhaps, not only for their own consumption, but for exportation.
The Governor saw it in this light, and determined to guard, as
much as was in his power, against any attempts to destroy
them."</p>
<p>Discharging the store-ship, part of the cargo of which, was
injured by the weather she had met with, formed the principal
labour of the month, owing to the small number of working men
which could be got together, the Governor was forced to order two
men to be sent for this purpose from every farm having ten, till
the provisions were placed in the public store.</p>
<p>Of the natives little had lately been seen, till the arrival
of Governor Hunter, with whom Bennillong returned, who in his
absence had gained a polish, which made him act with a genteel
conduct to his sisters and relations, and the consequence he had
acquired blazed forth in his behaviour to his mere acquaintances,
indeed he seemed to arrogate to himself a superiority over his
fellow countrymen, by saying he should introduce peace and love
among them, and not suffer them to murder one another, and his
ideas of delicacy made him offended with his sisters; at table he
acted with the greatest propriety, observing every custom in
genteel life. Of his dress he was particular, and indeed he
appeared highly delighted with civilized life. On making inquiry
for his wife, he found she had favoured a rival, but on producing
a jacket and petticoat, she left her lover and followed
Bennillong; however, in a day or two, the lady appeared as
unadorned as usual, and Bennillong was not with her. Caruey, his
rival, it was found had been beaten by Bennillong, who had learnt
in England the use of his fists, which gave him an advantage
Caruey by no means understood. However he gave up his false wife,
and said he would make a better choice next time. Bennillong was
frequently absent from the Governor, but when he returned he
never came into the presence of his Excellency till he had
dressed himself, for when he went on an excursion he left his
clothes at home. In December a report reached Sydney, that the
natives had been committing their depredations again, at some
farms down the river, and on an armed party being sent out, five
were killed, one wounded, and four taken prisoners. C&aelig;sar
again fled to the woods, and lived by plundering the settlers by
night; however one good action he committed, which was killing a
native that wounded Collins, who lived in the settlement. Poor
Collins, the moment he was wounded, desired to be brought to the
settlement for our surgeons to cure him, The barbed spear had
been driven into his loins, and could not be extracted at the
hospital; he therefore left the settlement, determined to trust
to nature, nor did he trust in vain. Being seen from time to time
for several weeks, walking about with the spear still unmoved;
but at last information was brought to the colony that his wife
had fixed her teeth in the wood and drawn it out; after which he
recovered, and was able again to go into the field, His wife
War-re-weer shewed by an uncommon attention her great attachment
to him. The Sovereign sailed on the 27th for Bengal.</p>
<p>At Sydney, an attempt being made to steal a cask of pork from
the pile of provisions before the store-house, the whole was
removed into one of the old marine barracks.</p>
<p>At Hawkesbury an extraordinary phenomenon occurred. Four farms
on the creek named Ruse's Creek, the crops on all of which were
ripe, and prodigiously fine, were totally cut up by a fall of
large flakes of ice. This memorable shower passed in a direction
North-West, taking such farms as fell within its course. The
effect was extraordinary; the wheat then standing was beaten
down, the ears cut off, and the grain threshed out. Of the Indian
corn the large thick stalks were broken, and the cobs found lying
at the roots. A man who was distant from a house was glad to take
shelter in the hollow of a tree. The side of the trees, on that
part of the race-ground which it crossed, that were opposed to
its fury, appeared as if large shot had been discharged against
them. The two succeeding days were mild; notwithstanding which
the ice remained on the ground as large as when it fell. Some
flakes of it were found and brought in so long after as the
second day, which measured from six to eight inches long, and at
that time were two fingers at least in thickness.</p>
<p>On representing to the Governor the distress the settlers had
suffered, whose farms had lain in the course of the shower, that
relief was given them as their situations required.</p>
<p>Only 26 persons lost their lives in the year 1795, which
certainly was much fewer than could be expected. Happy indeed
would it be, if at the close of 1795, the settlement could be
found unincumbered by those, who like other beasts of prey,
sought only whom they might devour; and it is particularly
distressing to observe, that the several depredations committed,
were on the properties of such persons as implicated those about
them as being accessaries, though in many cases unjustly no
doubt. It should be considered, that when a house was to be
robbed, the plunderers must be aware, that where nothing was,
nothing could be got.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<p><b>1796.]</b></p>
<p><small>THE</small> task of following the progress of the
country, becomes more satisfactory by far, than in the earlier
period of it. Want and its attendant horrors do not so
continually intrude in the narrative. The settlement having
become more established. Crimes being so generally punished, and
rewards for opposite conduct uniformly bestowed, certainly
together, held out a temptation much stronger to do well than
otherwise: notwithstanding which, crimes of the blackest die
must, it is much to be feared, for many years stain the History
of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The Arthur anchored in the Cove from Calcutta, on the 1st of
January, 1796, with a cargo of various articles, on speculation;
and on the 2d, the Surprize returned from Norfolk Island, whither
she had been sent to learn the state of Governor King's health,
and to know if any thing was wanted at that settlement. All the
information she brought was, that the Governor was still very
ill.</p>
<p>On the 16th, a play-house was opened at Sydney, permission for
which had been some time granted to a number of the well-behaved
convicts. Their first performance was, "The Revenge, and the
Hotel". The principal performers were Sparrow, the manager, H.
Green, W. Fowkes, G. H. Hughes, W. Chapman, and Mrs. Davis. The
pieces were decently played, and the house, dresses &amp;c. had
far from a contemptable appearance. When leave was given for
opening the theatre, they were told, that the first impropriety
would not pass unnoticed; and on the second being committed, the
whole of them would be sent to another settlement. The price of
admission to the gallery was 1s. paid either in money, flour,
meat, or spirits, according to the market price. That opening the
door of a theatre should hold out a powerful temptation to many,
who had by their means, found the ready road to New South Wales,
is not a wonderful thing; but contrary to the practice in
England, of robbing at the theatre, they visited it only to see
whose house they might plunder while they were at the play; an
instance of which was brought to light on the second night of
performing.</p>
<p>The following curious prologue was spoken at the theatre,
which is certainly <small>PARTICULARLY DESCRIPTIVE</small> of the
theatrical corps.</p>
<p align="center">PROLOGUE.</p>
<p class="poem">From distant climes, o'er widespread seas we
come,<br>
Though not with much eclat, or beat of drum.<br>
True patriots all, for be it understood,<br>
We left our country, for our country's good;<br>
No private views, disgraced our generous zeal,<br>
What urged our travels, was our country's weal;<br>
And none will doubt, but that our emigration<br>
Has prov'd most useful, to the British nation.<br>
    But, you inquire, what could our breast inflame,<br>
With this new passion for Theatric fame;<br>
What, in the practice of our former days,<br>
Could shape our talents to exhibit plays;<br>
Your patience, Sirs, some observations made,<br>
You'll grant as equal to the scenic trade.<br>
    He, who to midnight ladders is no stranger,<br>
You'll own will make an admirable Ranger.<br>
To seek Mackheath we have not far to roam,<br>
And sure in filch I shall be quite at home.<br>
Unrivalled there, none will dispute my claim<br>
To high pre-eminence and exalted fame.<br>
    As oft on Gadshill we have ta'en our stand,<br>
When 'twas so dark you could, not see your hand,<br>
Some true-bred Falstaff we may hope to start,<br>
Who, when well-bolster'd, well will play his part.<br>
The scene to vary, we shall try in time<br>
To treat you with a little pantomime.<br>
Here light and easy Columbines are found,<br>
And well-tried Harlequins with us abound;<br>
From durance vile oar precious selves to keep,<br>
We often had recourse to th' flying leap;<br>
To a black face have sometimes ow'd escape,<br>
And Hounslow Heath, has proved the worth of crape.<br>
    But how, you ask, can we e'er hope to soar,<br>
Above these scenes, and rise to Tragic lore?<br>
Too oft, alas, we've forc'd th' unwilling tear,<br>
And petrified the heart with real fear.<br>
Macbeth, a harvest of applause will reap.<br>
For some of us, I fear, have murder'd sleep;<br>
His lady too with grace will sleep and talk,<br>
Our females have been us'd at night to walk.<br>
    Sometimes, indeed, so various is our art,<br>
An actor may improve and mend his part:<br>
"Give me a horse", bawls Richard, like a drone,<br>
Well find a man would help himself to one.<br>
Grant us your favour, put us to the test,<br>
To gain your smiles we'll do our very best;<br>
And, without dread of future Turnkey Lockits,<br>
Thus, in an honest way, still pick your pockets.</p>
<p>That liberty, which had kindly been given for the performance
of plays, probably led some to imagine, that it would be no
difficult matter to obtain a licence to erect stills, and vend
spirits, thus by legal means continue what had been a long time
carrying on in private; but an intention fraught with such
seriously destructive consequences, the Governor determined to
suppress; and therefore issued the most positive orders to
prevent any attempt of the kind, by desiring information to be
given of any stills erected. The result was, that several were
found and destroyed. It being thought expedient to ascertain the
number of arms in the hands of individuals, an order was issued
to all but the military, to bring their arms to the Commissaries,
and take certificates of permission for bearing them. But out of
300 stand of arms, only 50 were brought in, which proved what was
suspected, that they were got into improper hands. C&aelig;sar,
who was still in the woods, and several others, were reported to
have been seen in arms, and as some of the settlers were
suspected of supplying them with ammunition, they were informed
that in case it should be proved, they would be implicated in the
consequences of the robberies. The Ceres, store-ship, arrived on
the 23d from England. The next day, the Experiment Snow from
Bengal arrived, with a cargo of soap, sugar, spirits, callicos,
muslins, &amp;c. &amp;c. On the same day arrived the ship Otter
from North America, Dorr, master, who finding the market
well-stocked, or coming only to enable convicts to make their
escapes, he offered for sale as a favour, a small quantity of
rum, wine, and tea. The natives resumed their troublesome
conduct, and wounded a boatman during this month. On the 21st,
the Reliance sailed for Norfolk Island. Two days afterwards,
Eades, a soldier, fell from a rock and was drowned, leaving a
widow and five little children, for whose benefit a night was
given by the players, on the 4th of February, which produced
12<i>l</i>. The Marquis Cornwallis, from Ireland, anchored, on
the 11th of February, in the Cove, with 233 convicts, male and
female, of the country from which they came. In the voyage a plan
was detected to take the ship, but was discovered and prevented;
one part of the plan which the females were to execute, was to
mix powdered glass with the flour used by the seamen for
puddings. This ship likewise brought intelligence, that the Cape
of Good Hope had surrendered to his Majesty's arms; and General
Craig and Commodore Blanket, both sent official accounts of the
circumstance to Governor Hunter, kindly offering any services in
their power for the benefit of the settlement.</p>
<p>On the 15th, the black C&aelig;sar was shot by Wimbow. This
man and another, tempted by the reward of five gallons of
spirits, had been for some days in quest of him. Finding his
haunt, they concealed themselves all night at the edge of a brush
which they perceived him enter, In the morning he came out, and
looking round him saw his danger, he presented his musquet, but
before he could pull the trigger Wimbow fired and shot him. They
took him to the hut of Rose, a settler, at Liberty Plains, and be
expired in a few hours. Thus ended a man who had given more
trouble than any other convict in the settlement.</p>
<p>On the 18th, the Otter sailed for America. By her escaped
Thomas Muir, transported for sedition, and several others whose
sentences were not expired. Muir, in a letter he left said, he
conceived that in withdrawing he was only asserting his freedom;
and meant if he arrived in safety, to enjoy what he deemed
himself to have regained of it in America, until the time should
come when he might return to his own country with credit and
comfort. He purposed practising at the American bar. In this
country he passed his time in ease and retirement, living out of
the town at a spot of ground which he had purchased.</p>
<p>The Abigal, another American, in a few days arrived; but as
several prisoners had found an asylum in the Otter, the Governor
ordered the Abigal to anchor in Neutral Bay, where he imagined
the line of communication would not be so easy as in Sydney Cove.
Her master, Thornton, gave out that he was bound to Manilla and
Canton. For part of his cargo, however, he met with purchasers,
notwithstanding the stock of articles which the late arrivals had
brought in.</p>
<p>The frequent depredations to which the settlers on the banks
of the Hawkesbury, and other places, were exposed to from the
natives, called upon them, for the protection of their families,
and to afford each other their assistance upon occasion of alarm,
by assembling when anybody of natives were found to be lurking
about their grounds; but they seldom shewed the smallest
disposition to assist each other. Improvident even for their own
safety and interest, they neglected the means by which all could
be secured. This disposition being soon manifest, the Governor
thought it necessary to issue an order, stating his expectations
and directions, "that all the people residing in the different
districts of the settlements, whether the alarm was on their own
farms, or on the farm of any other person, should upon such
occasions immediately render to each other such assistance as
each man, if attacked, would himself wish to receive; and he
assured them, that if it should hereafter be proved, that any
settlers or other persons withdrew or kept back their assistance
from those who might be threatened, or who might be in danger of
being attacked, they would be proceeded against as persons
disobeying the rules and orders of the settlement." Those who had
fire-arms were enjoined not wantonly to fire at, or take the
lives of any of the natives, as such an act would be considered
as murder, and subject the offender to such punishment as the law
might direct. The Governor had been informed, that two white men
(Wilson and Knight) had been often seen with the natives in their
excursions, and were thought to direct and assist in those
depredations by which the settlers had suffered. The settlers
were strictly prohibited from giving any natives encouragement to
lurk about their farms.</p>
<p>Those natives who lived with the settlers had enjoyed the
comforts of a settler's mode of living, 3nd that their friends
and companions might partake, stole from those with whom they
were living, or communicated such favourable opportunities as
offered of stealing what they pleased.</p>
<p>Several who had served their term of transportation applied
for permission to provide for themselves. Of these were Wilson
and Knight, who preferred a vagrant life with the natives; and
considering, that if taken, they would be dealt with so as to
prevent their getting among their black friends again; these
rascals led on the natives to every kind of mischief, explaining
too clearly, of how little use a discharged musquet was. This
removed that terror of fire-arms with which it had been the
constant endeavour to inspire them.</p>
<p>As many articles were brought for sale in the Marquis
Cornwallis, a shop was opened on shore, and money, or orders on
the Commissary, Paymaster of the Corps, and Officers who paid
companies, were taken for goods, an opportunity was now afforded
to some among the privates to pass, not only counterfeit Spanish
dollars and rupees, but forged notes or orders. One forged note
for 10 guineas, was passed at the shop, but discovered before the
recollection of the persons who offered it was effaced, though
not in time to recover the property. The whole party was
apprehended.</p>
<p>In one hot day in this month, the shrubs and brushwood about
the Cove caught fire, and burnt within a few yards of the
magazine. On its being extinguished, the powder was removed, on
board the Supply, till security against any future accident of
that kind could be erected round the building.</p>
<p>On the 5th of March, the Reliance returned from Norfolk
Island. The harvest proved very bad this season. The corn in
general was much mixed with a weed called drake; this arose from
an over-eagerness to reap a golden harvest, and like most cunning
people, the settlers were too cunning for themselves. Had they
properly manured the land, the produce would have been
prodigious. Spirits, in defiance of all orders, found their way
to the neighbourhood of Hawkesbury, where the settlers were
continually intoxicated. In the course of March, Capt. Paterson's
store-room was entered, by a hole being made in the wall, and
robbed to a great amount; and Capt. Townson's house was robbed of
60<i>l</i>. in dollars, and his watch; and a woman was robbed in
the street of a piece of callico, for which a convict was taken
up, but as she could not swear to his person, the fellow escaped
that punishment he most undoubtedly deserved. The supply sailed
for Norfolk Island on the 24th. Poor Bennillong having taken too
much notice of Cole-be's wife, which the husband discovered, a
contest ensued in which Bennillong received a wound on his upper
lip that divided it, and knocked out two of his teeth. This
rendered him more hideous than he was before, and his appearance
before was very far from captivating.</p>
<p>To prevent, if possible, the indiscriminate sale of spirits
which, notwithstanding all orders, prevailed, the Governor
thought granting licences to a few persons, might have a proper
effect. Ten selected persons had licences granted them for twelve
months, by three magistrates. They were bound in penalties of
20<i>l</i>. and found two sureties in 10<i>l</i>. However from
the frequent intoxication which great numbers had for some time
been seen in, there was reason to suspect that a greater quantity
of spirits had been landed from the different ships than permits
had been obtained for. Governor Hunter, to suppress the practice
of retailing spirits in this indiscriminate way, thought proper
not only to grant licences under these restrictions, but desired
the aid of all officers to use their exertions to end a species
of traffic, from which the destruction of all industry was to be
expected, and no good could result.</p>
<p>On the 18th, the Supply returned from Norfolk Island, after an
absence of only three weeks and four days, the quickest passage
too and from that island; and on the following day, the Snow,
Susan Trotter, from Rhode Island. Her cargo consisted of spirits,
broad-cloth, and a variety of useful articles.</p>
<p>On the 30th, the Indispensable transport arrived from England,
with 131 female convicts, and a small quantity of provisions.</p>
<p>At a criminal court held this month, four prisoners were tried
for forging, and uttering with a forged indorsement, the note
passed at the store in February, James M'Carthy was convicted of
the same, and received sentence of death; the others were
acquitted. This trial had been delayed, M'Carthy having broke out
of the cells, and remained for some time sheltered at the
Hawkesbury.</p>
<p>Three were tried for stealing some articles out of a store,
and James Ashford, a young lad, was found guilty. He was
sentenced to seven years labour at Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>Two were found guilty of stealing geese, belonging to Mr.
Grimes, deputy-surveyor, and sentenced to receive corporal
punishment.</p>
<p>On the 11th of May, the Britannia, store-ship arrived from
Calcutta and Madras, with salt provisions and rice, exclusive of
the private property of the officers, and one mare, five cows,
and a calf, brought for sale. With this ship arrived Lieut.
Campbell, and Mr. Phillips, a surgeon, belonging to the Bengal
army, for the purpose of raising 200 recruits from among those
whose sentences of transportation had expired. This at first
seemed to promise as well for the settlement, as taking weeds out
of a garden; but the Governor found these gentlemen were only to
accept of such as bore a good character. Such a number of such
people could they have found them, being permitted to go, must
have ruined the country, it would have indeed opened that way to
villainy which must have rendered it ever successful, as the
number who wished to counteract vile proceedings must have been
considerably lessened. The Governor therefore determined not to
suffer recruiting to commence for the Bengal army, till he was
obliged by an order from the administration of his country.
McCarthy was ordered for execution (for forgery) on the 16th, but
the Rev. Mr. Johnson requested his life might be spared, as he
seemed to have been the tool of others. To this request the
Governor acceeded, on condition of his being kept for seven years
to hard labour at Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>During May, several vile and daring robberies were committed,
a convict who had liberty granted him to cultivate 30 acres of
land, had bought a cask of provisions, from a ship in the cove,
which he wished taken to a settlers near his farm; he therefore
sent two men with it, who contrived that it should never reach
the destination; and the house of a superintendant was broke open
and robbed of property to a considerable amount. Information was
given, that two run-a-ways, James M'Manus, and George Collins,
were secreted in a hut near the brick fields; the consequence of
which was George Collins was secured, but M'Manus escaped. The
hut they were found in, was by order pulled down as a warning for
others, to be cautious how they harboured such persons. The
Governor having reason to suspect, that the settlers were many of
them much involved, and that their crops for some time were
pledged to discharge those incumbrances. He ordered an inquiry to
be made, when it proved, that in the districts of the Ponds, the
Field of Mars, Eastern Farms, Prospect-Hill, and Mulgrave-Place,
near the Hawkesbury, the several settlers owed 5098<i>l</i>. Many
of them were idle, drunken fellows, who gave themselves up to
every vice. One man of a different description, had fortunately
resisted many temptations to sell a sheep given him by Governor
Phillip, was now master of 22 male and females, without buying a
single one; he was an industrious man, and very attentive to his
business, and thus reaped the certain reward of his exertions. On
the 19th of June, the house of William Miller, a baker, was
robbed of articles to the value of above 50<i>l</i>. principally
the property of other persons; but most of the things stolen,
were next morning found in a situation, evidently chosen that
they might be discovered. Mr. Bass and two others went on an
excursion to view the mountains and country around them, and
having in their route passed over some very rich ground, they
reached the highest summit, and there saw at an immense distance
a large range of mountains. On the 20th, the Governor and a party
went a second time to see the state of the wild cattle, during
which excursion they counted 94. A boat which had been driven
into a bay at Port Stephens, returned with large pieces of coal,
of which they reported great quantities to be laying on the
beach. On the 21st, the Francis sailed for Norfolk Island with
dispatches from the Governor. Capt. Collins, as Judge-Advocate,
and other Magistrates, finding great inconvenience in transacting
business at their own houses, a court-house was erected. A timber
carriage was this month made use of both at Sydney and Paramatta,
drawn by oxen, which saved much time, and the labour of many
men.</p>
<p>Several women were employed in haymaking, at Toongabbe, which
was to be carried out by those ships, about to proceed to the
Cape of Good Hope for cattle. On the 4th of July, Smith, a seaman
of the Indispensable, was shot by David Lloyd, a convict servant;
and at the Hawkesbury, on the same day, David Lane was shot by
John Fenlow, his master. Lane expired in a few hours, but Smith
languished till the 9th, and then died at the hospital. Both
murderers were taken up, but Fenlow escaped, though ironed, and
was not retaken till the end of the month, when some natives gave
information that he was in the neighbourhood of his own farm.
These enormities were productive of some regulations long wanted.
Several settlers had all assistance from government withdrawn
from them; others were struck off the victualling books, and all
persons off the store were ordered to appear at Sydney before
some of the magistrates, and receive certificates that they had
served their terms of transportation, and the settlers were not
allowed to employ any who had not such vouchers. This brought in
many run-a-ways, who came with fictitious names, but they were
detected and sent to hard labour. Live-stock was rapidly
increasing at this time, and an officer about leaving the colony,
sold to government a flock of 100 goats, for 490<i>l</i>. 10s.
which enabled the Governor to perform some promises he had made
of giving to several worthy settlers a number of those valuable
animals.</p>
<p>Information was given to the Governor, that several persons
were building boats without permission; notwithstanding the
convenience which must attend having boats in the harbour, abuses
were carried on by their means. An order was given, that no boat
should be built without the Governor's permission in writing; and
that all boats in the possession of individuals, should be taken
to the master boat-builder, and numbered on the stern, a register
of which should be kept by the provost-martial; and all boats
without a number were to be seized.</p>
<p>The natives had been less troublesome lately than for some
time. Four people of a fishing boat who had been cast on shore
near Port Stephens, met with some natives who put them into a
path from thence to Broken Bay, and conducted them part of the
way. In this journey, these people made them understand that they
had seen among the natives to the Northward, a white woman.</p>
<p>On the 29th, the Francis returned from Norfolk Island. The
criminal court at that settlement had been assembled, and one
convict suffered death for a most daring burglary, which he and
two others effected with circumstances of cruelty. The
accomplices were sentenced to hard labour on Phillip Island.</p>
<p>The gangs at this place employed in public works were seldom
seen in the afternoon. It appeared that, notwithstanding the
orders given tor the regulation of public labour, the
superintendants had tasked the people as they thought proper. By
this, the work of government was almost neglected, and the
convicts time applied to the use of individuals.</p>
<p>To remedy this evil, the Governor informed the superintendants
and overseers, that if they should be found applying to any other
use the time to be employed for the public, they would be
instantly dismissed.</p>
<p>A court of criminal judicature was assembled early in August,
for the trial of several offenders on different charges.</p>
<p>Four were tried for a burglary in the house of William Miller,
but acquitted. David Lloyd was tried for the wilful murder of
John Smith, the seaman belonging to the Indispensable. It
appeared, that the seamen had in a state of intoxication gone to
the house, to take from a female convict (then living as a
servant at Mr. Payne's, who he had cohabited with during the
passage) some clothes he had given her. A riot in consequence
ensued, and the prisoner endeavoured to make it appear, that he
in his defence fired the pistol. The court found him guilty of
manslaughter, and sentenced him to receive 600 lashes. John
Fenlow was tried for the murder of his servant, David Lane. The
charge was fully made out, and the prisoner received sentence of
death. Four who had often broke out of prison, and run from the
jail-gang, were tried as incorrigible rogues, and being found
guilty, were sentenced to three years hard labour at Norfolk
Island; and one man tried for a rape was acquitted. Fenlow, being
tried on the Saturday, was executed on Monday, and his body
delivered to the surgeons for dissection. A stone was found in
his small bladder of the size of a lark's egg. The night before
his execution he confessed that the murder which he committed was
premeditated. The day before he was tried, he had prepared an
opening through the brick wall of his cell, purposing, had it not
been discovered, to have escaped after his trial.</p>
<p>On the 8th, the Susan sailed for Canton, in which two women
and a few men were allowed to quit the colony.</p>
<p>A civil court was held the next day, when some who had been
arrested by writs issued from the last court were brought up,
several of whom being settlers, assigned their coming crops for
the different sums. Had those defendants been thrown into prison,
their ruin would have been certain, and the debt would as
certainly have remained unsatisfied. This method was tried as
being more beneficial to both; but they were in general of such a
description, that even this indulgence induced them to be more
worthless and thoughtless than before.</p>
<p>The ship, Grand Turk, anchored in the Cove on the 25d of
August from Boston, in New England, with a cargo of spirits,
tobacco, soap, linseed oil, iron, cloth, &amp;c. but the
speculation did not answer, as the market was over-stocked. The
Supply sailed for Norfolk Island, on the 20th of September, with
wheat.</p>
<p>The following statements of live and other stocks, on the 29th
of September, places the colony in that comfortable situation,
which shews the combined exertions of the officers employed in
the government, had been crowned with the success they
deserved.</p>

day, 1s. 6d. and her victuals.</p>
<p>On the 29th of September, sailed the Reliance, Britannia, and
Francis, for Norfolk Island. In the Britannia Captain Collins,
the Judge-Advocate, embarked for England, and whose departure was
very particularly regretted, but that gentleman, whose unremitted
exertions for the good of the colony, was at all times so
eminently distinguished, had the satisfaction of leaving that
country, which he found on landing a mere wood, in a state highly
satisfactory to his own feelings. The Supply was to join them,
and the Britannia was to take on board Lieutenant-Governor King
and his family, as his health still continued very considerably
impaired, and Governor Hunter had granted him permission to
return to England. The Reliance was to proceed to the Cape of
Good Hope, and return to Port Jackson with live-stock.</p>
<p>When Governor King quitted Norfolk Island, the state he left
that settlement in, will in the following account shew, how well
he was calculated for the great trust reposed in him.</p>
<p>[The following inserted into 2nd Edition]</p>
<blockquote>[With respect to Governors, though it is acknowledged
that Governor Macquarrie had improved upon all the plans of the
Governors that preceded him; but as the absolute power they
possessed, has been found prejudicial to the improving state of
the colony, it has been thought fit that a council should be
given him for the purpose of sharing with him in the
responsibility of those measures which they may think necessary
for the security or prosperity of the colony. Formerly, at the
sole will of the Governor, a punishment of 500 lashes has been
inflicted, and in other cases a fine of 100<i>l</i>. A person,
too, charged with shooting at, and wounding, a native was, in
March 1810, tried simply for an assault, whilst another, who had
committed a similar offence against an European, was tried on the
same day for his life!&mdash;Since Governor Bligh had represented
to his Majesty's ministers that the inhabitants were particularly
desirous that they might not be so much in the power of the
military, but have some kind of justice that might bring them
nearer to their brethren in Great Britain, as there were then
settlers sufficient in character and numbers to furnish juries,
it was wisely determined to alter the mode of administering
justice in this colony. Since this period, it has also been
hinted to the Governors of the settlement, that they ought not on
their own account to enter into farming speculations; "his (the
Governor's) salary ought to be sufficient to support him; he
ought never to look to other and indirect means of enriching
himself."<br>
<br>
Other circumstances highly interesting to the readers of this
work, and the public at large, may be also proper to introduce
here.<br>
<br>
In addition to an Orphan Female School, which has flourished
almost from the first settlement of the colony, supported by port
duties and fines, a Male Orphan School, on a similar plan, has
been established. Several private schools are also open, and
nothing is wanted more than a sufficient number of proper
masters.<br>
<br>
The mode of transportation has undergone many improvements. When
the hulks are full up to their establishment, and the convicted
offenders in the different counties are beginning to accumulate,
a vessel is taken up to convey a part of them to New South Wales.
A selection is made in the first instance of all the male
convicts under 50 years of age, sentenced to transportation for
life, or for 14 years; and if there are not a sufficiency of
these, the number is filled up with those the most unruly in the
hulks sentenced for 7 years, or those convicted of the most
atrocious crimes. As to females, it is still customary to send,
without any exception, all whose health will permit it, under 45
years of age. On the voyage a proportion of the prisoners is
daily to be admitted on the decks; the sick to be visited twice a
day by the surgeon, the healthy once. To render the surgeon more
careful, he is now paid a gratuity of 10s. 6d. for every convict
landed in New South Wales. If the conduct of the master of the
vessel, too, be satisfactory, the Governor may bestow upon him a
gratuity of 50<i>l</i>.; on the contrary, he may be fined, or
liable to a prosecution. About 200 men or women are generally
embarked on board one ship, with a guard of thirty men and an
officer. And as a proof of this improvement in the mode of
conveyance, it appears, that from the year 1795 to 1801, of 3,833
convicts embarked, 385 died on board the transports; but since
1801, of 2,398 embarked, 52 only have died on the passage, being
1 in 46. Upon the arrival of a transport at New South Whales,
general orders are issued for the returns of men wanted, with the
land held in cultivation by each settler. The trade, age,
character, and capacity, of each convict are, as far as possible,
ascertained. Persons who have been in a higher situation of life
have tickets of leave given them, by which they have liberty to
provide for themselves, and are exempt from all compulsory
labour. Similar tickets are given to men unused to active
employment, as goldsmiths and others; the remainder are
distributed amongst the settlers as servants and labourers. The
convicts in the service of government work from six in the
morning till three in the afternoon, when they may spend the rest
of the day in amusement, or in labour for themselves. They are
clothed, fed, and mostly lodged by government. If the convicts
misconduct themselves at their work, the superintendants have no
power to inflict punishment, but must take them before the
sitting magistrate of the week at Sydney, who, with a regular
bench, can order them from 25 to 300 lashes. The convicts
distributed among the settlers are clothed, supported, and lodged
by them; and working no longer than the government convicts, have
the same privileges. The master can inflict no corporal
punishment upon them but by the interference of a magistrate; and
if the master himself he a magistrate, be must apply to another
magistrate for redress against his servant. The servant on his
part may also apply to a magistrate, who can, if his complaint be
well founded, discharge him from his master. In the distribution
of female convicts, they are no longer given to such of the
inhabitants as demanded them, when they were in general received
rather as prostitutes than as servants; but now, by order of the
government here, the female convicts are kept separate till they
can properly be distributed in such a manner as they may best
derive the advantages of industry and good character.<br>
<br>
When the convicts' time is up, if they chuse to settle in the
country, a grant is made to the unmarried of 40 acres of land,
and to the married of something more for the wife and each child,
with tools and stock, which they are not allowed to sell,
&amp;c.<br>
<br>
Evidence having been produced of the bad consequences of the
Governor's possessing a power to grant absolute or conditional
pardons; and it being known that in some years 150 pardons have
been granted to convicts immediately upon their arrival, without
reference to their characters or merits, Parliament has
recommended that pardons in future shall only be granted through
the Secretary of State, though this may create a delay, perhaps
of a year, in obtaining the pardon or any convict.<br>
<br>
As to the mode of returning after the expiration of their time,
all but the aged and infirm convicts easily find employment on
board the ships visiting New South Wales, and are allowed to work
their passage home; but though hitherto no such facility has been
afforded to the women, who have had no possible method of leaving
the colony but by prostituting themselves on board the ships
whose masters may chuse to receive them, or who must otherwise
submit to banishment for life, means for preventing this in
future have also been recommended by Parliament.<br>
<br>
But we will now revert to our narrative of the progress of this
infant colony.]</blockquote>
<p align="center"><small>JUDICATURE.</small></p>
<p>A court of criminal judicature existed there similar to that
at Sydney, only composed of five instead of seven members; but no
civil court had been established.</p>
<p align="center"><small>INHABITANTS.</small></p>
<p>The civil department consisted of a Lieutenant-Governor, a
Deputy Judge-Advocate, a Deputy Provost-Martial, and Deputy
Commissary; a Surgeon, a Storekeeper, and four subordinate
Officers; and the military of a company of the New South Wales
corps.</p>
<p>The settlers were, four seamen who belonged to his Majesty's
ship Sirius; fifteen marines; fifty-two settlers, whose terms of
transportation had expired; three officers, and others. The whole
number (exclusive of the officers) with their families, was about
240.</p>
<p>One hundred and forty-nine men, and sixty-three women, whose
terms of sentence had expired, supported them selves by hiring
ground from settlers, working for individuals, or at their
different trades, and labouring for the public; for which they
were clothed and fed from the stores, and received such other
encouragement as their behaviour merited. The number of this
class, with their women and children, was about 130.</p>

maintained by them; the rest were occupied as follows: not more
than 30 men were employed in cultivating ground for the public
advantage, and even these were much interrupted, by attending the
artificers in carrying on the different buildings.</p>
<p align="center"><small>CULTIVATION.</small></p>
<p>The island contains about 11,000 acres. In the level parts
where the earth cannot be washed away by the heavy rains, the
soil varies from a rich brown mould to a light red earth. These
are varied by pieces of black mould and gravel. Those parts of
easy ascent preserve their depth of soil, and many of them have
born six successive crops of wheat.</p>

<p>Most of the ground cleared of timber was under cultivation in
1793 and 1794, and produced above 34,000 bushels of grain; but,
from the check given to industry in the year 1794, and the great
proportion of the labourers working for their own support and
other ways disposed of, not more than one-third of the government
ground, and a fifth of the ground belonging to individuals, was
in any state of cultivation during the last year.</p>
<p>The few at public work, and the labour necessary for preparing
the ground to receive wheat, did not admit of more than 100 acres
of wheat, 18 of maize being sown last year for the crown; the
produce of which had been abundant; but the quantity was much
reduced by the weeds that grew with it, and lightning.</p>
<p>Cultivation was confined to maize, wheat, potatoes, and other
garden vegetables. The heat of the climate rendered wheat an
uncertain crop.</p>
<p>The harvests of maize were plentiful; and two crops were
generally procured in twelve months. The produce of one crop was
in general 45 bushels per acre, and often from 70 to 80.</p>
<p>It appears, that there were 5247 acres occupied; of which only
1528 were cleared of timber: that there also remained 5753
neither occupied nor cleared, making in the whole 9472 acres not
cleared of timber.</p>

<p>When the settlers were informed that payment of their bills
could not be made till orders were received from England, and
that no more grain could be received, but that the purchase of
fresh pork would be continued, their industry became changed, but
raising grain continued necessary for their stock.</p>
<p>On most part of the 9472 acres not cleared of timber, the
trees and underwood were covered with succulent herbage, which,
with the fern and other soft roots, afford the best food for
swine. Several individuals had taken advantage of this
convenience, by inclosing from 10 to 100 acres of the uncleared
parts, into which they turned their swine, of them many had from
20 to 150, that required nothing more than a small quantity of
maize to accustom them to their owners.</p>
<p>Salting pork in the cool months had been successfully tried.
The swine belonging to government which could be killed during
the winter, were salted down.</p>
<p>The Bengal ewes yeaned twice in 13 months, and had commonly
two, often three, and sometimes four lambs at a yeaning; and
these had increased so much by being crossed by the Cape ram,
that a lamb six weeks old is now as large as one of the old
ewes.</p>
<p>The goats too are extremely prolific, and generally breed
thrice in the year, having commonly from two to four kids at a
time.</p>
<p>The want of artificers of all descriptions, and the scarcity
of labourers at public work, much retarded the construction of a
number of buildings. The island possessed the best of stone,
lime, and timber; but, unfortunately, there never had been but
one mason on the island.</p>
<p>At Cascade Bay had been made a very strong wharf, 126 feet
long, which connects the shore with the landing rock. At the end
of it is a swinging crane and capstern, by which boats are loaded
and unloaded with the heaviest articles; and in bad weather are
hoisted up with safety.</p>
<p>Near this wharf, a large storehouse and barracks for the
guard, are built No risk need be run by ships keeping in Sydney
Bay, as the landing is good at Cascade Bay, when it becomes in
the least degree hazardous at the former place.</p>
<p>A water-mill had been built; it ground 20 bushels of wheat
daily; which had removed the inconvenience of every man grinding
his own ration before it could be dressed. The abundance of
mill-stones, and the quantity of wood fit for millwrights' work,
with the convenient situation of the different streams, will
admit of any number of water mills being erected.</p>
<p>Two well-finished windmills had also been erected by settlers,
which answered extremely well.</p>
<p>Not more than ten settlers had been able to erect dwellings
better than log huts, which are neither warm nor durable. Many
were building comfortable weather-boarded habitations at their
own expense.</p>
<p>Of schools there were two; one for young children, who were
instructed by a woman of good character; and the other kept by a
man, who taught reading, writing, and arithmetic, for which he
was well qualified, and was very attentive. A third institution
on a permanent footing was added, for the reception of such
orphan female children as had lost or been deserted by their
parents. Most of these were of such an age as to require a strict
hand and careful eye over them. Unfortunately they, as well as
the other children, were destitute of every article of clothing,
except such as the store afforded, which was by no means
calculated for children in that warm climate. By the application
of fines imposed for breaches of the peace, &amp;c. and a
subscription raised among the officers, the orphan children had
for some time past been clothed, and about 28<i>l</i>. remained
to be applied in the same manner.</p>
<p>How highly honourable is it to Lieutenant-Governor King, that
at the same time every nerve was exerted to repress and punish
the various crimes he was obliged to witness, that be should have
such a parental care over the infant generation, as to found
schools for their instruction:&mdash;undoubtedly he must have
felt what Thompson wrote&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><small>"Delightful task to rear the tender
mind", &amp;c.</small></p>
<p>and thus gained that inward satisfaction, which all men must
do who endeavour to do well.</p>
<p align="center"><small>LABOUR.</small></p>

<p>From the foregoing statement it appears, that not more than
136 men, composing the fourth class, are employed in carrying on
public work, of which number only 28 can be employed (when other
works of public necessity do not intervene) in raising grain,
&amp;c. without expense to the crown, for the first, third,
fourth, and a part of the fifth and sixth classes; making
together 442 persons.</p>
<p>Those of the fourth class, who labour as carpenters, sawyers,
blacksmiths, &amp;c. work from daylight till eight o'clock; from
nine till noon; and from two in the afternoon till sunset; and as
long as they do their work properly they have Fridays and
Saturdays to themselves, which they employ in working at their
grounds, or in building, &amp;c. for settlers and others who can
employ them. As those works are in fact of a private nature,
although in the end they become more or less of public utility,
the artificers are indulged with the use of government tools and
such materials as can be spared.</p>
<p>Those employed in cultivation, and other incidental labour,
for the public benefit, work at all seasons from daylight until
one o'clock, which is found much more advisable than dispersing
them at the hours for meals, and collecting them again to resume
their labour. As very few of this description have any persons to
dress their meal, or grind their maize, they have by this
management a great part of the day at their own disposal; and
from the 21st of September to the 21st of February no public work
is done, on Saturdays. Those of this description who are
industrious employ a great part of their leisure time in
cultivating pieces of ground for their own use, or labouring for
others.</p>
<p>The second and a part of the fifth and sixth classes, making
together 331 persons, support themselves by the produce of their
labour without expense to the crown; as the clothing with which
they and the settlers are occasionally furnished from the stores
is paid for in grain or stock.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>ORDINARY PRICE OF LABOUR.</small></p>
<p>To a convict taken off the stores by an officer or settler,
from 5<i>l</i>. to 6<i>l</i>. per annum.</p>
<p>To a freeman hired by the year, victualled and clothed, from
10<i>l</i>. to 12<i>l</i>. per annum.</p>
<p>A day's work for a labourer, with victuals, is 3s. without,
5s.</p>
<p>Cutting down and burning off an acre of wood, 2<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>Ditto, ditto, an acre of weeds, 1<i>l</i>. 10s.</p>
<p>Thrashing one bushel of wheat, 10lbs. equal to 1s. 8d.</p>
<p>Other works are in proportion.. The mode of payment for labour
is various, and depends entirely on the employers circumstances;
but it is in general made by what arises from the grain or fresh
pork put into the stores by settlers, &amp;c. sometimes (but very
rarely) in cash; and often, by equal labour, or by produce, which
is rated as underneath.</p>
<p>And in order to prevent disputes respecting the payment, these
agreements, as well as all others, are entered in a book kept by
a person for that purpose, and properly witnessed.</p>

sale, for barter, or in payment for labour.</p>

<p>N.B. When the latter is taken into the stores for the sick, it
is issued as 5 lbs. of mutton for 7 lbs. of salt beef stopped in
the stores; by which method government does not pay more than 6d.
per lb. as for fresh pork.</p>
<p>The depravity of the convicts rapidly increasing, the Governor
resolved on building a larger log prison both at Sydney and
Paramatta, and "as the affair cried haste", a quantity of logs
were ordered to be sent in by the various settlers, officers, and
others, by which means the carpenters had as many or more than
they could use; at this time it was discovered that many convicts
attended the delivery of provisions from the stores, both at
Sydney and Paramatta, answering to their own or another name at
both places, to prevent a repetition, of which the delivery was
ordered to take place in the future on the same hour at both
stores. Indeed, so incorrigible were some of the convicts,
particularly those of the gaol gang, that they were ordered to
work every Sunday on the highway, as a punishment, and in an
excursion the Governor made to Paramatta, he recovered nearly 100
men as labourers for Government, who had absconded from the other
settlements. On the 16th of October, a boat sent to the North
shore for wood, brought in a man's hat, which was found with a
hammer laying near it; some blood was found in the hat, and on
searching, the body of a man was discovered near the water side.
On the next morning a man murdered a woman, with whom he lived.
During this month the houses at Paramatta and Sydney were
numbered, divided into districts, and one inhabitant chosen in
each, as a security for the peace being kept in the division, and
an appointment took place of three watchmen, to be rechosen every
12 months, and approved by the Governor. Bennillong who had
become tired of civilized life, and had returned to his natural
savage state, applied to the Governor for assistance against a
number of his fellow countrymen, who were determined to kill him,
for murdering a man near Botany Bay, of which he protested his
innocence. The Governor, anxious to protect his companion from
England (Bennillong), sent a guard with him to the brick-fields,
(where the natives lay in wait for him) to explain to his
countrymen that he was not guilty of that or any murder, and that
the Governor would not suffer a native to visit any of the
settlements that should dare insult him; and as they had all felt
the comforts of the settlements, particularly in cold weather,
the business ended. On the 1st of November, arrived the Prince of
Wales, from England, with a cargo of provisions. On the 13th, the
Francis arrived from Norfolk Island, with dispatches from the
Reliance, Supply, and Britannia; and on the 14th Richard Atkins,
Esq. officiated as Judge-Advocate, instead of Captain Collins.
The Sylph anchored in the Cove, on the 17th, with provisions; she
sailed with the Prince of Wales from England, but was by contrary
winds prevented reaching her destination before. A criminal court
opened on the 23d, and was held till the 29th, at the conclusion
of which, eight men had sentence of death passed on them; Francis
Morgan, for the murder of the man whose body was found on the
16th of October, and seven for robbing the stores, and two others
were found guilty of manslaughter; three were executed at Sydney,
two at Paramatta, and three were pardoned. The body of Morgan was
ordered to be hung in chains on the island Mat-te-wan-ye. This
spectacle, shocking to the refined mind, served as an object of
ridicule to the convicts, and terror to the natives, who though,
hitherto, particularly partial to that spot, now totally
abandoned it, least the malefactor should descend and seize them,
in the same way as their superstition prompted them to imagine
spirits did. The Prince of Wales sailed for China on the 23d, and
on the 6th of December, the Sylph to the same place. On board the
latter two male convicts were discovered. Nothing but the
superior ignorance of the convicts can account for the repeated
attempts to leave the colony in this way, as no obstacle was ever
placed in the way of their quitting the country with some degree
of credit, when the term for which they were transported had
expired. A little native girl, whose parents resided near Broken
Bay, and were among those that committed continual depredations
at the Hawkesbury, was brought in by a party detatched against
the depredators, among whom were shot, her parents. She soon
became a great favourite in Sydney, which made the natives about
that settlement very jealous of her, and at length they found
means to get the poor girl into the woods near the Governor's
house, when they murdered her, by cutting off her arms, and
making many spear wounds in her body; they then left her, and
withdrew into the woods. In January a stack of wheat containing
about 800 bushels of corn, was destroyed by fire; and as a
considerable quantity of wheat the property of Government was in
the neighbourhood of it, the jail gang were ordered out, and
promised if they stopped the progress of the flames, that the
irons in which they always worked should be knocked off. This had
the desired effect; they overcame the fire, and gained their
promised reward. Lawrence Davoreu, an attorney, transported from
Ireland, was on the 20th of January convicted of forgery. The
Governor ordered him to Norfolk Island for life. His Excellency
made an excursion to Botany Bay, for the purpose of exploring
George's river, and the soil near its banks. The river it was
found reached 25 miles from Botany Bay. This month a windmill and
a granary were finished.</p>

to be in future paid.</p>

<p>If possible, to prevent the many robberies committed by the
convicts who were hitherto suffered to wander about, it was
ordered, that none but officers, should travel without passports,
which they were to shew to the officers in the different
districts, and those detected travelling without, were to be
imprisoned a month.</p>
<p>The continual repetitions of the most cruel outrages,
committed by the natives on the settlers in the Northern farms,
in one of which they lately murdered a man and woman, compelled
the settlers to arm and follow them, keeping up the pursuit all
night; the next morning they came near about 100 of them, when
the natives fled, leaving their plunder on the ground. The
pursuers continued to follow them to the neighbourhood of
Paramatta; when fatigued, the settlers went into the town, and
were in return followed by the natives, with Pe-mul-wy at their
head. This fellow, with all the brutal impudence of ignorance,
threatened to kill the first man that approached him, and
actually threw a spear at a soldier; in consequence of which a
discharge from the military and settlers took place, by which 5
natives were killed, and many wounded; among the latter was
Pe-mul-wy, who was then brought to the hospital, from whence,
when cured, he made his escape, with an iron ah out his leg.</p>
<p>The log prison and granary at Sydney were completed during
March. The settlers at the Hawkesbury sent round a quantity of
grain to repay the store for that lent them, as seed to crop
their grounds the last season; and at the same time sent
information that the natives had plundered a settler's house, and
then burnt it, as well as a rick of wheat.</p>
<p>The public granaries being filled, they closed on the 21st of
April, and were declared shut against the receipt of grain, till
the following August. The Governor wishing to ascertain the
quantity and quality of a tract of land between the Duck and
George's River, set out with a party, sending a boat on first
with provisions to the Banks of the George's River, from
Paramatta; the ground was found excellent, and well stored with
ponds of fresh water. Proceeding nearly to Botany Bay, they saw
several parties of natives, and among the rest Pe-mul-wy, who
inquired, if the Governor was angry? and was delighted on being
told he was not During April a tree was discovered, the bark of
which, when soaked in water and well beat, could be spun and used
instead of hemp, and was superior to the flax from Norfolk
Island, which was particularly fortunate, as the colony was in
great want of cordage.</p>
<p>A criminal court assembled this month, sentenced three (who
had served the terms for which they were transported), to be now
again transported to Norfolk Island; one for receiving stolen
goods for 14 years, and the other two, who were of that class,
who to avoid work, sought refuge in the woods, and robbed the
settlements at night for support, the court sentenced to 7 years
transportation.</p>
<p>The public works continued the same as at the end of the last
month. The foundation of the building for the reception of the
assistant-surgeons was laid, and the lower floor of the large
granary at Sydney was nearly completed.</p>
<p>Much rain fell during this month. On the morning of the 27th
of April, a high wind came on, which, for the want of care at the
windmill, it was set going with such violence, that one of the
running stones was broke, a piece of which so wounded the
millwright, that his life was despaired of. Some carpenters were
ordered to repair the damage, and in a few days it was at work as
usual.</p>
<p>The example lately made had no good effect on the natives,
they still troubled the settlers in Land Cove, burning a house,
and killing a number of hogs, which, as they left behind them,
proved the attack to be wanton. At Kissing Point, they wounded a
settler and his wife, and burned every article they had. The
settlers were so perpetually alarmed by the natives that they
again collected, and with a few soldiers sent to assist them,
went out in the night, and their fires directed them to the place
where a large body of natives had collected to attack and plunder
them. A volley of musketry was then fired over their heads, which
so alarmed them, that they instantly fled, leaving their spears,
&amp;c. and about 20 bushels of Indian corn which they had
stolen.</p>
<p>Though many of the natives had been kindly treated, yet they
were seldom found to possess any degree of gratitude. Bennillong
himself, was as destitute in this respect as most of his
countrymen; even their children, bred up in the settlements, and
who, from being accustomed to follow the settlers' manner of
living, might have been supposed to have no taste for the life of
their parents, when grown up, quitted their hospitable abodes,
and took to the same savage mode of living, where the supply of
food was often uncertain, and their lives in danger. The wife of
a man named Ye-ra-ni-be, both of whom had been brought up in the
settlement, was murdered in the brick-fields by her husband, and
Cole-be, who first beat her about the head, and then drove a
spear through her heart.</p>
<p>If spoken to for robbing the maize-grounds, or cornfields, to
be revenged, they assembled in large bodies, burned the houses of
the settlers, and frequently took their lives, though seldom
refused corn when they would ask for it; that they were
stimulated to this conduct by some run-a-ways, who were among
them at the time there was no doubt. In order to get these pests,
a proclamation was issued, calling on them by name to surrender
within 14 days, declaring them outlaws if they failed, and
required the inhabitants to assist in bringing them to justice.
And the Governor made known, that if any natives were again
detected in robbing the settlers, he would hang one of them in
chains near the spot as a terror to the others.</p>
<p>On the 16th of May, the Supply arrived from the Cape of Good
Hope, with 31 cows, 5 mares, and 27 sheep, all in perfect health:
8 cows, 2 bulls, and 13 sheep died in the course of the
voyage.</p>
<p>In the night of the 16th, a boat which had been fishing at
some distance to the Southward of Botany Bay, brought to the
settlement three persons who belonged to a ship called the Sydney
Cove, which had sailed from Bengal with a cargo for this country
on speculation. The Governor was informed by Mr. Clarke, (one of
the three) that the ship had sprung a dangerous leak before she
had rounded the South Cape, which, as soon as they had got to the
Eastward of the Southern part of the coast, increased to so great
a degree, as to render it absolutely necessary to haul in for the
land. The wind being from the S. E. they were enabled to
accomplish this, in time to land the ship, when she was dropping
from under them, having sunk down to the fore channels, when they
were enabled to run her aground, on an island in lat. 40&deg; 37'
South. They met with this misfortune in the middle of February;
soon after which a small number of them resolved to attempt
reaching Port Jackson in the ship's long boat, leaving the
commander and about 30 people to stay near the wreck. The boat
being got ready, 17 people embarked in her, and sailed; but
meeting with very bad weather they were again wrecked on the
coast near Point Hicks, and endeavoured to travel Northward, but
dropped off one by one and lost each other daily, till the number
was reduced to five, the three who had arrived (the supercargo, a
sailor, and a Lascar), the first mate of the ship, and the
carpenter. These two, from excessive fatigue, had been unable to
proceed, and had stopped the day before their companions had been
taken up by the fishing-boat.</p>
<p>To seek these unfortunates a boat was dispatched, provided
with such comforts as were necessary. The man who met with the
supercargo was sent in the whale boat, and they proceeded to the
spot which Mr. Clarke had described as the place where they lost
sight of their companions; but, after a long search, they only
found some trifling articles, and these being bloody, it was
naturally imagined they had been killed by the natives, whom, in
the course of their long march, they had found frequently very
kind, and at other times on the contrary very savage.</p>
<p>Mr. Clarke, and the two other people, were very much
exhausted, but every care being paid to their situation, they
quickly recovered.</p>
<p>The Britannia anchored between the heads from Ireland, on the
27th, with 150 male and 50 female convicts from that kingdom, and
an officer and 25 recruits for the New South Wales corps.</p>
<p>The same day the Francis, and a longboat named the Eliza,
sailed to bring away the remainder of the ship's company
belonging to the unfortunate Sydney Cove.</p>
<p>The settlement was now much distressed for canvas, the best
boat being in the Hawkesbury, it became requisite to dismantle
another, and thus furnish sails to bring her round.</p>
<p>On the 2d of June, the ship Ganges arrived from Ireland, with
convicts from that kingdom, and a detachment of recruits for the
New South Wales corps.</p>
<p>The Governor now visited Paramatta, to examine that part of
the country he meant to cultivate on the public account; and to
observe how the convicts, lately arrived, were provided for. The
cattle from the Supply had been sent thither, and were with the
stock at Toongabbe, all thriving well.</p>
<p>The ground proposed to be cleared on the public account, was
two miles and a half from Paramatta, very well situated, having
excellent ponds in its vicinity. The deputy surveyor attended the
governor, spots were marked out for erecting the public
buildings; and named Portland-Place.</p>
<p>In consequence of the proclamation issued last month, a
run-a-way convict delivered himself up, an another was taken;
they seemed half starved; but their sufferings were not
sufficient to prevent a repetition of the offence in themselves,
or similar ones in others; so strong was the aversion these vile
character had to work.</p>
<p>On the 26st of June, the Reliance arrive from the Cape of Good
Hope, with 26 cows 3 bulls, and about 60 sheep on board, for the
colony. Two boys belonging to the Reliance, on the same night she
arrived, carried away a small two-oared boat, in which they
intended to proceed and join the natives. To effect which, they
took a boat-cloak to sleep in, a pair of pistols, a small
quantity of gunpowder, an 50 cakes of portable soup; but being
pursued they were brought back again.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Sydney were assessed to supply thatch for
the new gaol, and the building was enclosed with a strong high
fence. It was 80 feet long, the sides and ends were of strong
logs, a double row of which formed each partition. The prison was
divided into 22 cells. The floor and the roof were logs, over
which was a coat eight inches deep of clay.</p>
<p>On the 5th of July the Francis arrived from the wreck of the
Sydney Cove, with all the crew except six, who were left to
protect that part which was saved of the cargo. A violent storm
arose on the 17th, which rooted up many large trees, and blew
down several chimnies. The vanes a windmill were torn by the
wind, and even the ships in the cove, brought their anchors horn
On the 7th of August, the Francis sailed for Norfolk Island with
provisions; but the wind left her before she cleared the harbour,
"when some of those on board got intoxicated, and desired to
bring a boat on shore, which was of course refused; in
consequence of this, one of the crew fired a pistol and wounded a
seaman, and for this he was brought on shore, though not in a way
agreeable to his desires. A whale-boat was sent with Mr. Bass, to
discover a stratum of coal found by Mr. Clarke, two days before
he was taken up by the fishing boat. Mr. Bass met with it seven
leagues Southward, and found it extended for nine miles to the
breadth of eight feet. On the 27th, a young native, said to have
committed murder, underwent the encounter of that revenge usually
exhibited on those occasions. In the combat two spears went
through his hand, when his friends rushed on his adversaries,
defeated them, and broke their spears. Bennillong was now accused
of the murder of a native woman, because she told her friends,
when at the point of death, that she dreamed Bennillong had
killed her; but he protested he was a perfect stranger to the
woman, having never seen her.</p>
<p>A piratical misfortune occurred in the beginning of September;
a boat, named the Cumberland, on her passage with stores to the
Hawkesbury, was boarded by some persons in a small boat, and
joined by some of the crew. Four not wishing to escape in this
way, were put on shore near Broken Bay. The boat then put off to
sea, and those landed hastened to Port Jackson with the
information; and though two boats went in pursuit of them, it was
without effect. On the 20th of September arrived the Deptford
brig from Madras, on speculation, principally laden with spirits;
for as they at all times found a ready sale at Sydney, no ship
came there on a trading voyage without a large portion of them in
their cargo, and though every means that could be devised was
made use of, to prevent the whole of them being brought on shore,
ways were contrived to land them without leave; so great was the
determination to procure those baneful commodities.</p>
<p>Towards the close of this month another excursion was made to
view the wild cattle, when two herds were seen, one consisting of
67 and and another of 170.</p>
<p>On the 2d of October, another boat was seized by a party, in
which were included the three men who objected to going away in
the Cumberland last month; and though boats were sent out after
them directly, they returned with the same want of success.</p>
<p>The Reliance though cleared of her stores, and now quite
light, was found to admit as much water as before; and it
appeared on opening the ceiling, that the leak was in the
guard-board streak, abreast of the main-mast, the water rushing
in there with great force.</p>
<p>A survey had been held on the Supply, after which she was
pronounced unfit for further service.</p>
<p>The bricklayers, carpenters, blacksmiths, and other labourers,
were all now fully employed. A large and convenient shop, capable
of working several forges, was erecting at Sydney.</p>
<p>The Governor to prevent any more escapes by means of boats,
ordered all that might in future be found not properly secured,
or left with rudders, sails, masts, or oars, to be burnt. On the
20th of October, two men were tried for the murder of a native
long accustomed to the settlement, but were acquitted, as it
seemed committed by accident. One for forgery was convicted, and
sentenced to be transported for seven years to Norfolk Island.
Three of the witnesses on these trials were afterwards convicted
of perjury, and sentenced to stand in the pillory, with their
ears nailed to the rostrum; at the execution of which the mob
greeted them with the true English accompaniments of dirt and
rotten eggs.</p>
<p>The 20th of this month a contest took place between the
natives; one of which, desirous of revenging the death of a
friend, who had been killed by some native of a tribe from which
a young man had just come amongst them. Discovering their
intention, he stood up, and, being attacked by numbers, defended
himself with great bravery, till being speared in several places,
at length fell. As he lay on the ground, several treacherously
rushed on him, and stabbed him repeatedly with a Doo-ul. Thus
situated, he tried to cover himself with his shield, on which,
rising from the ground, he was again attacked, and received their
spears with the greatest dexterity, till some treacherous native
took a station on one side, and fixed a spear in his back, which
remained there. On this, they proceeded a second time to rush on
him, when he had just strength enough left to make his escape
into a house, where he was kindly received, but immediately
fainted.</p>
<p>The spear being drawn, and his wounds dressed, by a surgeon,
in a few days he was able to walk. His brother, who had
accompanied him to the battle, stood up in his defence, and was
wounded both in the leg and thigh.</p>
<p>The principal sufferer in this affair was one named William
and Ann, which he had adopted from a ship of that name which
arrived in the year 1791.</p>
<p>Some of the women on this occasion howled and cried
alternately when they were enraged, which often happened, they
danced and beat their sides with their arms; a proof of their
passions being affected.</p>
<p>On the 31st, an open boat, from the Hawkesbury, which arrived
with Indian corn, had been boarded in her passage by a party of
natives in canoes. They were suffered to come in the boat, when
watching an opportunity, they made an attempt to seize, the arms.
This caused a struggle, in which the boat's crew prevailed, but
not before some of these black pirates had lost their lives.</p>
<p>It was discovered that a boat belonging to a settler, which
had been stolen some time, and was supposed to have been driven
out to sea and lost, had been taken by the natives, after
murdering the men who were in her. The boat, on a search being
made, was found in the possession of the natives.</p>
<p>This was a novel circumstance, but it was too true; the white
people living amongst them had been the instigators of this
mischief.</p>
<p>A bridge, capable of bearing any weight, was erected over Duck
river, for the convenience of land carriage between the towns of
Sydney and Paramatta.</p>
<p>During November, a scarcity of wheat once more visited the
public stores, and the Governor ordered a reduction of that
article till the crops were gathered.</p>
<p>The success which attended the seizure of the Cumberland, and
the other escapes of two parties of convicts, tempted 14 others
to form a plan for taking away a boat, and making the same
effort. Having secreted all the stores they meant to carry away,
the night for their departure was settled; and they were on the
point of embarking, when they were surrounded by a party of
magistrates and constables, who took them and their stores into
custody; for they had not proceeded with the caution necessary
for such an enterprize, and information was given just in time to
defeat their project; and the next day they were punished, by
being sent up to Paramatta to hard labour.</p>
<p>On the subject of these mad schemes, the Governor addressed
the convicts, and afterwards published an order, pointing out the
risk which must attend such enterprises; and said, he was of
opinion, that a few ignorant people had been led to try them by
the wicked designs of some viler than themselves.</p>
<p>The Irish convicts who arrived in the last ship shewing a
propensity to desert from work, a party of soldiers were sent to
Toongabbe, there to remain during the harvest.</p>
<p>Nine hundred bushels of the last year's crop, where brought
round in the Francis from the Hawkesbury, and placed in the
public store. Than the appearance of the wheat of this season
nothing could promise better; it had ripened suddenly, owing to
some heavy rains being followed by hot weather. The military were
hired to assist in reaping, it being necessary to lose no time in
collecting the crops.</p>
<p>James Wilson, who had for a long time taken up his abode in
the woods, surrendered himself this month to the Governor's
clemency. He had been with the savages over different parts of
the country, and had submitted to have his shoulders and breast
scarified after their custom. He appeared with no covering but an
apron of a kangaroo's skin.</p>
<p>The Governor knowing, from his former habits, that if punished
and sent to hard Labour, he would rejoin his savage companions,
thought to make him useful in the mode of living which he seemed
to prefer; therefore pardoned him, and proposed his attempting,
to take the convicts who were at large in the woods; just before
Wilson's return two of whom had stolen two mares.</p>
<p>Wilson said, that he had been 100 miles in every direction
round the settlement, and had seen several animals, which had not
been seen in any of the districts; and to the North West of the
head of the Hawkesbury, he came upon a very extensive tract of
open and well-watered country, where he had seen a bird of the
pheasant species, and a quadruped, which he said was larger than
a dog.</p>
<p>A convict who had formerly been a school-fellow of the Rev.
Mr. Johnson's, had been taken into his service, and he reposed in
him the greatest confidence, treating him with every indulgence.
He had not been in the service of Mr. Johnson long, when that
Gentleman was informed that his servant had taken an impression
of his store-room key, and procured another from it that would
fit the lock. Hardly crediting the information, he was urged to
furnish an opportunity; for which purpose a constable was
concealed in the house one Sunday, while all the family but this
servant were attending divine service. This plan succeeded;
imagining all was safe, by means of his key, he entered the room,
and was proceeding to plunder it, when the constable seized him
taking the property.</p>
<p>This month the Deptford brig sailed to the coast of
Coromandel.</p>
<p>On the 10th of December two of the natives, both of them well
known in the settlement, (Cole-be, the friend of Bennillong, and
one of another tribe) meeting at Sydney, attacked each other.
Cole-be was remarkable for his activity, but his opponent was
much younger, and a perfect match for him. Closing on each other,
with their clubs, Cole-be, who had not before gained any
advantage, and the handle of the other's shield drawing out, and
falling from, his grasp, he stooped to pick it up, when Cole-be
struck him on the head, and staggered him, arid followed his blow
while in that situation.</p>
<p>Cole-be as conscious this would acquire him the name of
jee-run, or coward, as that the friends of the other would
revenge his cause, the consequences might be serious if he died,
he thought proper to abscond, and the poor fellow was taken care
of, but on the 16th he died. During this time he was attended by
some of his male and female friends, particularly two, Collins
and Mo-roo-bra. One of the nights when a dismal song of
lamentation had been sung over him, principally by women, his
male friends, after listening with great attention, started up,
and seizing their weapons, went off determined on revenge,
knowing where to meet with Cole-be, they beat him and reserved
the gratification of killing him for their final revenge, until
the fate of their companion should be ascertained. The next
night, Collins and Mo-roo-bra attacked a relation of Cole-be's,
Boo-ra-wan-ye, whom they beat about the head with great
cruelty.</p>
<p>The murdered native was hurried the day after he died by the
road side below the military barracks. He was placed by his
friends upon a large piece of bark, and laid into a grave.
Bennillong assisted, placing the head of the corpse, near which
he stuck a beautiful war-ra-taw, and covered the body with the
blanket on which he died. The earth was thrown in with some
spades, during which, and the whole of the ceremony, the women
howled and cried; this was the effect of violent passions into
which the men threw themselves. Many spears were thrown, and some
blows were dealt with clubs; but nothing serious happened.
Cole-be's death all seemed determined on, having in so cowardly a
manner killed one so much beloved. To effect which a number of
natives met in a few days near the barracks, at which time a
young man, a relation of Cole-be's, received many wounds, and a
lad also related to him, (and who formerly lived with Mr. White,
the surgeon), was to have been sacrificed, but he was saved by
the appearance of a soldier, who had been sent with him for
protection; for it was conceived, when the tumult against his
uncle (Cole-be) had subsided, nothing more would be thought of
him.</p>
<p>Cole-be knowing that he must submit to the trial usual on such
occasions, or live in the continual fear of being murdered,
determined to suffer the affair to be decided. Having made known
his resolution. On a day appointed, he repaired armed to the
place near the barracks. The violence shewn by the friends ol the
deceased was indescribable; and Cole-be would certainly have lost
his life, but for several of the military. Although active in the
use of the shield, he was overpowered, and falling beneath their
spears, would have been killed on the spot, but several soldiers
rushed in, and prevented them; he, from the many severe wounds he
received, being incapable of making any resistance. The soldiers
lifted him from the ground, and bore him into the barracks.</p>
<p>Bennillong, the friend of Cole-be, was present at this
meeting; but, without intending to take any part in it either
way. The atrocity of his friend's conduct had been such that he
could not openly espouse his quarrel; perhaps indeed, he had no
wish to fight; and if he could avoid it, he would not, by
appearing against him, add to the number of his enemies. He was
armed, however, and without clothing of any kind, remaining a
silent spectator till the moment when the soldiers rushed in to
save the life of Cole-be. On a sudden he was in a rage, and threw
a spear among the soldiers, which took effect on one of them,
entering at his back and coming out at the belly, close to the
naval. For this he would instantly have been killed had not the
provost-marshal interfered and brought him away; for he had
received a blow on the head with the butt-end of a musket.</p>
<p>It was thought necessary to confine him all night, to prevent
the mischief with which he threatened the white people, and to
save him from the anger of the military, and on the following
morning he quitted the town.</p>
<p>Prior to the death of the poor fellow murdered by Cole-be, the
natives at Sydney were called to the celebration of that
ceremony, Yoo-lahng Era-ba-diang.*</p>
<p align="center"><small>[* See pages from 12 to 15. [Chapter
I]]</small></p>
<p>Bennillong was there, but returned without his wife, being
persuaded by her mother, who she met at the Yoo-lahng, to leave
her husband. Bennillong was no favourite with even the females of
his own country, and those unfortunate enough to be with him for
any time, were known to be actuated by fear of his brutality.</p>
<p>The house of John Mitcham, a settler, and a stack of wheat,
were set, on fire by three villains. The poor man owed above
30<i>l</i>. which the contents of his wheat-stack was meant to
discharge, but now, besides being cruelly beaten, he had to make
a fresh beginning in the world, and that very much involved. The
man knew not who were his enemies; for two of them had blackened
their faces, and the other was a stranger.</p>
<p>An order was issued, with an offer of conditional freedom, and
permission to become a settler, to any convict who would give
information to convict the offenders.</p>
<p>As much mischief had been done by dogs among the hogs, sheep,
goats, and fowls, an order was issued limiting the number kept by
each person to what were necessary for protection.</p>
<p>Three schools for the education of children, had been
established at Sydney; and this being the period of their
breaking-up for the Christmas holydays, 102 clean and
decently-dressed children, came with their several masters and
mistresses, and paid their respects to the Governor, who examined
the progress of the elder scholars in writing, &amp;c.</p>
<p>On Christmas-eve, two settlers between Sydney and Paramatta,
having boasted of their abilities in drinking, challenged each
other to a trial of skill in that way, and to prevent being
disturbed, retired to a wood, with a quantity of spirits. Their
abilities by no means kept pace with their boasting; for one died
on the spot, and the other was nearly dead when taken up.</p>
<p>On Christmas-day information was given, that two seamen of the
Reliance had discovered the body of a soldier (who had been for
two days missing,) lying in a mangled state, with his head and
hands cut off.</p>
<p>A settler was fined 40s. and ordered to labour for six weeks,
for disobeying the public orders.</p>
<p>The commander of the wrecked ship, Sydney Cove, having
intreated the Governor to spare the Francis to visit the wreck,
and the six men he had left in charge of what property was saved.
His Excellency consenting, at the latter end of the month the
Francis sailed with Captain Hamilton for that purpose.</p>
<p>On the East side of Sydney, a fire broke out among the
convict's houses, when three of them were destroyed; and another
house, at some distance, was burnt by some wretches who the owner
had displeased.</p>
<p>In December, the public labour was covering the new
store-house, finishing a tower for a clock which had arrived in
the Reliance, building another windmill, and completing the
barracks of the assistant-surgeons.</p>
<p>At Paramatta and Toongabbe the wheat was all nearly housed. At
the latter place a barn had been built, 90 feet long, with a
floor on which 16 or 18 threshers could work.</p>
<p><b>1798.]</b></p>
<p>In January, 1798, the prisoners who arrived in the last ships
from Ireland had become so troublesome, and so dissatisfied,
that, without the most rigid treatment it was not possible to
make them do any work. Added to the natural viciousness of their
propensities, they formed a stupid opinion that there existed a
colony of white people in the country S. W. of the settlement,
distant only between 3 and 400 miles, in which they assured
themselves of finding every comfort without labour, which to
people of this description seemed to promise every happiness that
ignorant indolence could devise.</p>
<p>In consequence of this idea a plan was formed for effecting an
escape from the colony, and meant to be executed, as soon as a
sufficient stock of provisions could be obtained.</p>
<p>The Governor receiving information of these intentions,
desired a magistrate to go to Toongabbe, where the principal
malcontents were employed, and shew them the danger to which such
a step would expose them, and to acquaint them, that the Governor
would allow any four to proceed as far as they should find
inclined, with what provisions they could carry, and for the
preservation of their lives, he would order three other people,
accustomed to the woods, and acquainted with the savages, to
accompany and lead them in whatever direction they should point
out.</p>
<p>On inquiry, it appeared, that the history of the supposed
settlement had originated from a strange unintelligible account
which one who left his work, and lived with the natives, had
collected from the mountain savages.</p>
<p>A short time demonstrated the effect of the Governor's
address. He received information that numbers of them were
assembling for the purpose of proceeding in quest of the new
settlement. His Excellency directed a party of armed constables
to secure as many as they were able; and sixteen were taken and
put into confinement; they appeared to be quite ignorant where
they were going; but observing both obstinacy and ignorance, the
Governor, conceived that he could not use any argument more
likely to convince them of their folly than by ordering a severe
corporal punishment to be inflicted at Sydney on those who
appeared to be the principals in this business, which was put in
execution; seven of them received two hundred lashes each; the
remainder, after being punished at Paramatta, were sent to hard
labour and well looked after.</p>
<p>The necessity of checking this spirit of emigration,
determined the Governor to convince them, by their own
experience, of the dangers attending it, he therefore ordered
four of the strongest among them to be chosen, and prepared for a
journey of discovery. They were to be accompanied by three men,
who were to lead them back, when fatigued and exhausted with
their journey, over the very worst and most dangerous parts of
the country; but this plan was no sooner settled, than the
Governor was informed that a party concerted with the four
fellows elected, to meet them at a particular place, and there
murder the persons intended as their guides, possess themselves
of their arms and provisions, and afterwards pursue their own
course. This infernal scheme was counteracted by an addition of
four soldiers to the guides; and on the 14th they set off from
Paramatta.</p>
<p>On the 24th the military brought back three of the fellows,
who, having gained the foot of the first mountains, were so
completely sick of their journey, and the prospect before them,
that they intreated the soldiers to return, who were ordered to
leave them at this place to the direction of the guides; only one
man expressed a determination to penetrate further into the
country, and was left with them for that purpose.</p>
<p>In the transactions of the 2d of October, it will be seen a
boat had been carried off by some who were supposed to have taken
her out to sea, but they were now heard of. Owen Cavanagh, a free
man, had a boat which he employed in conveying grain from
Hawkesbury to Sydney. On the 10th of this month, he informed the
Governor, that a short time before, his boat had been boarded off
Mullett-Island, by the people who stole the settlers, and carried
her off, and another with 50 bushels of grain, which was bringing
to Sydney. One who had against his wish, been a party in the
first seizure, now left them, and returned with Cavanagh; and
gave the following account of their proceedings:</p>
<p>"Having made the capture they proceeded to the Southward, with
the idea of reaching the wreck of the Sydney Cove. For their
guide they had a pocket compass, of which hardly one man of the
fourteen knew the use. In this boat they were twice thrown on
shore, and at length reached an island, where they fortunately
found many birds and seals, or they must have perished. From the
hardships they underwent, they would have returned, had they
expected their punishment would have been any but death. Not
finding it possible for such a number of beings to continue in
one mind 3 or to furnish food in their miserable situation for so
many, they thought proper that one half should deceive the other,
and while these were asleep, those who were prepared took away
the boat, leaving their seven unsuspecting companions on a
desolate island," the situation of which this man could not
describe so as to enable it to be found. Their number reduced to
seven, they thought themselves in danger near this port; they had
been lurking for some time near Broken Bay, with a view of
stealing a better boat loaded with grain, which they effected,
first by taking the boat of Cavanagh, by means of which he had
long been enabled to support his wife and children; securing him,
they took possession of a smaller boat, with above 50 bushels of
wheat. Finding Cavanagh's the largest and best, they ran out from
the land, and shifted their prisoners into the smaller boat and
stood off to the Northward.</p>
<p>Wilson lately came from the woods, and among other information
mentioned finding above 50 skeletons, which the natives said,
were those of white men, who had lost their way; which was
corroborated by old shoes, &amp;c. lying about.</p>
<p>On the 20th, the Francis returned. Previous to his departure
for the wreck, Capt. Hamilton informed the Governor that she had
on board 7000 gallons of spirits, and wished to bring back part
with him by the Francis. The Governor averse to the introduction
of spirits, would have opposed the application; but it being
known in the colony, that a quantity of this article had been
saved, and that the island abounded with kangaroos and birds, he
thought these circumstances would not only have led to desertions
and captures of boats which had been effected, but likely to
prove temptations to similar practices; he therefore agreed to
purchase 3500 gallons of the rum of Capt. Hamilton, on account of
Government.</p>
<p>Capt. Hamilton said, that of the other articles taken on shore
from the wreck, a small quantity of coarse cloth only had been
preserved, as the remainder was destroyed by wind and bad
weather. The wreck was quite washed away. Of the six lascars who
were left with the property, one died; the five were in good
health. Capt. Hamilton left a cow, which died; but a mare was
brought away in the Francis. The Lascars had lived by killing
kangaroos and birds. They had erected a smoke-house, and cured
meat enough to serve them the ensuing winter. These people,
provided only with a small boat, made several excursions; and it
appeared that this part of the coast of New South Wales was
formed by a group of islands, reaching as far as they had seen to
the Westward. From these, and observations he had made when on
that part himself, the Governor conceived it highly probable that
there were many passages or straits through to the ocean
westward, making Van Diemen's land, the Southernmost part of New
South Wales, an island.</p>

<p><small>NOTWITHSTANDING</small> the trial Cole-be had undergone
for the unfair way of striking his opponent, while stooping down,
of which blows he died, the friends of that man did not think it
sufficient for his loss. Mo-roo-bra, with some other natives, met
Cole-be, and made an attack, determined to murder him. Cole-be,
still weak of the wounds he received in the last combat, was not
able to resist; and after receiving many blows on the head, was
thought finally dispatched; but Mo-roo-bra, as they quitted him,
saw him revive and attempt to rise, so returned to finish his
business. This so exasperated another native, that he caught up a
spear, and in a rage threw it with great force at Mo-roo-bra: it
entered his right side, over the hip bone, and went downwards
quite through the body, and he died in about an hour. The same
evening this heroic native was attacked in the usual way, and
defended himself with prodigious gallantry. He was speared twice
through the thigh, once through the leg, and received a bad wound
in the right hand.</p>
<p>The magistrates at Sydney, two in number, being much
indisposed, the Governor took upon himself the execution of their
troublesome office.</p>
<p>At the end of the month he visited Paramatta, to examine the
progress of the works going on there. During his Excellency's
stay, an Irish convict, who had escaped for some time, was
brought in. After wandering about several days in search of a
road which was to have conducted him to China, or the new ideal
colony of white people, his strength failed as provisions grew
short, and as he despaired of meeting with relief, he had sense
enough to reverse the written instructions calculated only to
carry him out, directing him to keep the sun on a particular part
of his body, varying according to the time of the day. Thus he
travelled Eastward, which led him nearly to the head of George's
river, where a few people were settled; and having one morning
heard a gun at a distance, he tried to walk to it, but was
unable, when night came on him, being faint, he took a little
flour from his pocket, and sprinkling it on some water, drank it,
and then laid down to rest. In the morning he was a little
refreshed, and again endeavoured to get in the direction whence
he heard the report of a gun, and soon heard a man's voice, on
which he hallooed and to his great joy was answered. This man,
who was a settler, took him to his house, recruited his spirits,
and brought him into the town. Being questioned how he found his
way back, he said, "that a paper compass which had been given him
was of no use, so he kept his face toward the place whence the
sun came from; but had not the herd been on his side, he must
have been lost, being two whole days without any food, but a
little flour and water.</p>
<p>The public works carrying on this month, were laying a new
floor in the granary at Paramatta; repairing every brick building
belonging to government, which were all very much decayed. At
Sydney, on the 31st, the building for that purpose being
finished, the clock was put up, and thus made known the hour to
the inhabitants. This appendage of public utility, astonished the
natives, who could by no means account for the noise it made on
striking, at which times they started in the most anxious fear,
till they became accustomed to the sound.</p>
<p>The Francis again sailed to the wreck of the Sydney Cove, on
the first of February.</p>
<p>Some of the natives who dwelt in the neighbourhood of the cow
pasture plains, told, the Governor that several of the wild
cattle had been killed, imagining this to have been done by the
Irish run-a-way convicts, a party of military, with Hacking, was
sent out with orders if possible to secure them. After an absence
of some days, they returned, having searched the country round,
but no traces of the cattle where they had been accustomed to
range could be seen, or did they meet any white people. The
natives persisted in having seen some of the convicts among them,
and said that some calves had been run down by them. This idea
was strengthened by finding some short pointed spears, supposed
to be made for the killing calves caught.</p>
<p>On the 9th of February, the three men who had been sent out
with the Irishmen, so desirous of discovering a way to China,
returned so exhausted, that two of them were scarce able to move.
Wilson, who was the third, having been in the habit of travelling
in the woods, kept them in spirits, and enabled them to reach
Prospect-Hill about sunset. Having been in want of food for
several days, except a few small birds, the refreshment which
they procured had nearly overcome them. The Governor sent a free
servant of his with Wilson, who gave an account of the journey;
in the following very interesting particulars:</p>
<p>"From Mount Hunter, (which was the highest land then known in
that part of the country, and distant from Paramatta from 30 to
34 miles S.W. they departed January 24, travelling S.S.W. for 18
miles, 12 of which was line open country. There they fell in with
the river Nepean, winding behind the cow-pasture plains. The
banks of the river being exceeding steep and rocky, they had
difficulty ii crossing. The other side of the river had a barren
appearance; during that day they saw a few kangaroos of a
particular kind, having long, black, and brushy tails; with a few
birds, which, from the length of the tail feathers they called
pheasants.</p>
<p>"On the 25th they continued in their course S.S.W. about six
miles. They saw many kangaroos and several emus; met with some
natives, one of whom engaged to go with them, if they would halt
that night. This agreed to, they had leisure to examine a hill,
the face of which appeared white, and proved to be a large cliff
of salt, a sample of which they brought away. The next day they
inclined to the Westward, and went 16 miles W.S.W. over a rocky
country, covered with brushwood. They on the following day,
travelled in the same direction, nearly the same distance, in
which they got to an open mountainous country, where crossing a
small river, they discovered both coal and limestone, and every
step the scene improved.</p>
<p>The 28th, they still went W.S.W. and added to their distance
20 miles. In one part they ascended a hill, from which they
obtained a view of the country for a great distance. To the
Northward it seemed to be open, and thinly clad with timber: to
the North-Westward they saw some very high mountains, and
apparently good land: to the Westward they saw a deep break,
which they thought formed by a river. This day they met with a
party of natives, who were terrified, and ran away from them. One
of the party followed and came up with a woman and child, whom he
detained to tempt the men to return, but though she remained with
them all night, the men did not appear. They gave her a small
hatchet in the morning, and sent her back. Wilson, though he
understood a little of the language of the mountain natives,
could not comprehend any thing the woman said, nor could she
understand one single word spoken by him.</p>
<p>"These natives were clothed with skins of animals, reaching
from their shoulders to their heels, which had a very pleasing
effect.</p>
<p>"The 29th, they travelled 24 miles in the same direction. The
first four miles the country was not good, being rocky and
covered with low shrubs, and intersected with creeks, appearing
to run towards some river. At the head of these creeks they saw
several water falls, one fell 40 feet, and two others 20 feet
each. They now proceeded Northward 12 miles, intending to get
round the heads of the creeks; but fell in with more. They then
determined to keep W. S. W. but found, the country rocky and
barren. They then saw a tree which they had not before noticed,
about the size of an apple tree, the leaves of which were of a
light blue, and the bark resembled that valuable production of
nature, the mahogany tree.</p>
<p>"The party were now nearly exhausted, having had nothing to
eat for two days, except a rat. Wilson was willing to go forward;
but his companions were now become very unwell, and wished
themselves safe home again.</p>
<p>"The 30th, they continued 16 miles in the same direction of
W.S.W. In the course of the day they fell in with the head of a
river nearly as large as the Hawkesbury, appearing to, run from
S.E. to N.W. Its banks were so rocky and steep, that they would
have found infinite difficulty in descending them; to which they
were strongly invited by the appearance of a level open country
on the other side; and Wilson proposed making a canoe to cross
over with; but the others were so faint and tired, having had
nothing to eat hut the rat and two small birds each, that they
were afraid to venture. Their shoes were now worn out, and their
feet cut and bruised by walking, so at length they proposed to
return.</p>
<p>"This being agreed to, on the 1st of February, they came back
S.E. by E. and having walked nine miles, they fell in with many
meadows thinly stocked with trees. The hills were slightly
covered with timber, and they were light. The ground was good
except on the tops of the hills where it was stoney. Here they
became much exhausted, and though they saw many birds, they could
not approach near enough to shoot any.</p>
<p>"On the 2d, they came E.N.E. over a fine country, formed of
meadows, extending some thousands of acres, with very few trees.
Towards the evening, having passed the first ridge of mountains,
they fell in with a number of kangaroos, one of which they
killed, and were much refreshed by it.</p>
<p>"On the 3d, the report of two guns in the S.E. was heard by
them, which they answered, but were not returned. Though they had
now reached that part of the country Wilson well knew, they must
have perished, but for his great exertions. Wilson assured them
of their being near Prospect-Hill; which, after much difficulty,
they at length reached, at the time they despaired of ever
viewing it."</p>
<p>A muster took place on the 14th of February, in every district
of the colony, at which all the labourers, either free men or
convicts, were obliged to appear. The next morning the settlers
were called over, prior to which the Governor informed them, that
he had heard much discontent prevailed among them in consequence
of some grievances which they complained of. For these, till he
was acquainted with the nature of them, he was unable to apply
any relief, so he desired they might be made in writing; and to
save trouble, he would direct two gentlemen to collect from the
settlers such of their distresses and grievances as they wished
to make known; and assured them, he had, from his own ideas,
forwarded a plan to the Secretary of State, which he hoped would
be attended to, and benefit them.</p>
<p>The women and children were then mustered, and proved to form
a very considerable part of the settlement.</p>
<p>As the maize ripened the natives resumed their depredations;
and on the 19th, the Governor received information from
Paramatta, that a man had been murdered near Toongabbe, and three
others wounded; and in a few days, two others were killed in the
same way, by the same natives. From these circumstances it became
requisite to send out several well armed parties, and attack them
where they could meet them.</p>
<p>Mr. Bass, the surgeon of the Reliance, now returned from an
excursion of 12 weeks in a boat to the Southward. This gentleman,
disliking an idle life, and having a good constitution, and being
possessed of great sensibility, ingenuity, and observation,
requested the Governor to lend him a boat, and allow him to man
her with volunteers from the King's ships; proposing to go along
the coast to make observations. The Governor consenting, he set
out in her; he persevered as far to the Southward as the latitude
40&deg; 00', visiting every opening in the coast; but only in one
place, to the Southward and Westward of Point Hicks, finding a
harbour capable of admitting ships. There was an appearance of a
strait, or rather an open sea, between the latitudes of 39&deg;
and 40&deg; South, and that Van Diemen's land consisted (as
conjectured) of a group of islands off the Southern coast of the
country.</p>
<p>Mr. Bass, on his return, picked up, on an island near the
coast, the seven men who were part of those who ran off with a
settler's boat, and had been left in this place by their
companions. Being incapable of taking them in his boat, he put
them on the main land, furnished them with part of his
provisions, and a gun for their protection. Two who were ill he
took into his boat, and left the other five to march to the
Northward, at the distance of upwards of 400 miles from Port
Jackson. They were nearly naked, almost starved, and must have
perished on the island, had not Mr. Bass discovered a smoke that
they had made to draw his attention; which he, being near, took
for a smoke made by some natives.</p>
<p>On the 26th of this month there was an unusually heavy fall of
rain during the night.</p>
<p>A curious notion was found to prevail among the natives
respecting Pe-mul-wy, which must prove fatal to him. Both he and
the other natives entertained an opinion, that, from his having
been frequently wounded, he could not be killed by our fire-arms.
This fancied security tempted the rascal to be at the head of
every party that attacked the maize-grounds.</p>
<p>On the 5th of March, a court was held at Paramatta. Writs were
issued, and prosecutions for debt commenced, and on the 7th
adjourned till the 19th, when it continued sitting until the
24th. The business consisted chiefly respecting debts contracted
between the retail dealers and the settlers; and as a proof to
what height this business had arrived, it is only to state, that
an appeal was made to the Governor in one cause for a debt of the
very serious sum of 868<i>l</i>. 16s. l0d. which was withdrawn on
the defendant consenting to pay the debt.</p>
<p>The Governor having received from the settlers, by means of
the two gentlemen he sent to them (the Rev. Mr. Marsden and Mr.
Arndell). a statement of their grievances and distresses,
informed them, that he was sorry to see the effects of them at
each civil court held. The debts with which they were so
frequently burdened, through imposition and extortion, committed
by petty dealers who infested the colony, added to the
difficulties under which an industrious man laboured, shewed
there wanted some mode of providing the necessaries required;
these were grievances of which he determined to get the better,
and he resolved to adopt every means in his power to give them
relief. To begin which he found it necessary to shut many
public-houses, which, when permitted, were meant as a convenience
to the people; but he saw they were the chief cause from which
many confessed their ruin to have sprung.</p>
<p>The island which Captain Hamilton run his ship on, to prevent
her sinking with them at sea, was now distinguished by the name
of Preservation Island. From which the Francis had arrived with
the remaining part of the property. When she was unloaded, the
property was put up and sold for the benefit of the underwriters,
and fetched the most enormous prices. The money that the settlers
should have expended in the improvement of their farms was thus
thrown away; and as the wheat of the last season had been
received into the public granary, and paid for, money not being
scarce, twenty-two shillings were paid for a common cup and
saucer.</p>
<p>The Governor wishing to obtain further information respecting
the salt-hill Wilson and his companions saw in their late
excursion, he sent Hacking there. On his return he brought some
samples of various veins of salt in different places, of 10 to 12
feet deep.</p>
<p>While out he was directed to seek for the wild cattle, and
reported that a few miles from the place where they were usually
found, he met with the most numerous herd yet seen; in which he
counted 170, and afterwards saw some stragglers. It was highly
satisfactory to know that they were safe.</p>
<p>Those men who carried off the boat of Owen Cavanagh, were
heard of again. The end of this month, a report reached Sydney,
that a piratical crew infested the harbour of Broken Bay, and the
Hawkesbury. The Governor had a letter from these men, in which
they professed to repent of their conduct, and intreated
forgiveness. They said, they had been wrecked 400 miles to the
Northward, when they at last got on shore, saving as much of
Cavanagh's boat as enabled them to make a smaller one, and in
this they returned, and surrendered themselves, when they were
confined for piracy.</p>
<p>The wanton destruction of timber had brought forth an order to
prohibit the cutting it down. The practice still continuing, the
Francis was sent round to the Hawkesbury, to seize a quantity of
timber which had been cut down for private sale. This seizure was
of consequence at this time, as a brig was building, from 125 to
150 tons burthen, to replace the Supply, which was condemned, and
a large boat, the Cumberland, in the room of that taken away by
the crew. The colony was now in such want of naval stores, that
the ruin of the craft, lately in such good condition, was nearly
effected. The bottoms were destroyed by worms, for want of pitch,
tar, paint, and oil; and to render the Francis capable of going
to Norfolk Island, with the Reliance, it was found necessary to
reduce part of the Supply's sails for her use.</p>
<p>Provisions and stores were now anxiously expected, as 16
months had elapsed since the arrival of the last.</p>
<p>April opened with five men being capitally convicted at a
court of criminal judicature, of seizing two boats, with an
intent of escaping. One was convicted of a robbery; three were
transported to Norfolk Island for 14 years; one for 7; one was
adjudged corporal punishment, and one acquitted.</p>
<p>Two of the five, condemned for seizing the boats, suffered at
Sydney. Their companions were respited at the place of execution.
They seemed penitent, and confessed the justice of their
sentence, acknowledging much mischief they had done, and how much
more they meditated, had they not been taken.</p>
<p>One man, for robbery, of the name of Mitton, was executed at
Paramatta, certainly a fit subject for example. He had been twice
pardoned after sentence of death; once in Ireland, and once here
for a similar offence for which he now suffered.</p>
<p>Before this man was executed, he confessed that many robberies
had been concerted, and were to have been committed by him and
others. He mentioned, as the chief instigator, a woman named
Robley (the wife of a blacksmith at Sydney), who received all the
property collected in this way. Dreading this discovery, she
offered to accuse others, or she must have been convicted
herself.</p>
<p>A native woman from the Hawkesbury, reported that she had seen
the two mares stolen some time since from Paramatta, and that
they were in the neighbourhood of that river. She also said, that
one of the men who stole them had been killed by the natives, and
the other had perished with hunger.</p>
<p>Hacking, when sent to the salt-hill last month, was
accompanied by Wilson and another man, who were directed to
penetrate as far into the country as the provisions they were
able to carry would permit. They returned from an absence of
three weeks, and said that they had been 140 miles W. by S. from
Prospect Hill. In their journey they travelled over a variety of
country, and found more salt hills. They met with some narrow
rivers or creeks, and some very extensive tracts of open rich
ground. They ascended hills of great height, from which their
prospect was extensive, and whence they discovered mountains
rising upon mountains to the Westward; all exceedingly high, and
they did not meet a single native in all their journey.</p>
<p>The Governor wishing to know the truth of every report that
could improve his knowledge of the advantages which this country
contained, he sent a party, with a few natives, to learn if there
was any salt near Broken Bay. Captain Waterhouse undertaking the
search, found the place described, and some salt; it was the
produce of the spray; the sea breaking over the rocky parts of
the shore in bad weather, and graining down behind, occasioned
the quantity of salt among the sand, and on the rocks.</p>
<p>The settlers, little undeserving the attention they met with,
were constantly laying complaints before the Governor. A petition
was presented from them in April, expressive of the distress they
were under, both from the high wages they gave for working their
ground, and the immense price paid for all articles requisite to
carry on business. And requested the price of maize might be the
same as last year.</p>
<p>His Excellency knowing their distresses, and as he was ever
ready to listen to any reasonable applications, ordered the
commissary to receive it at that price. But they were informed,
that they must expect a reduction in the price of grain of every
kind to take place.</p>
<p>Another evil oppressed them, which was an unbounded rage for
traffic. Even the delivery of grain into the public store houses
was completely monopolized, and settlers had few opportunities of
getting any thing near the value for their crops, being obliged
to dispose of it to those whose greater influence could get it
received into the public store.</p>
<p>Orders had been often issued on this subject, directing the
storekeepers to give the preference to those whose grain was the
produce of their own labour, and to let favour be shewn to the
poor settler. These directions had been often frustrated, from
the knowledge of which, the Governor was completely kept; on one
occasion the store at the Hawkesbury opened to receive 1,500
bushels of wheat, and the whole was engrossed by two or three
rich traders, to the exclusion of the farmers, settlers, and
others. But the Governor directed, that half the quantity thus
partially put in, should betaken away, and room made for the
accommodation of those so grossly injured.</p>
<p>A report now prevailed, particularly among the Irish, that an
old woman prophesied the arrival of several French frigates, or
larger ships of war, who, after destroying the settlement, would
liberate and take away all the convicts. This ridiculous tale was
circulated with incredible rapidity. In consequence of this, one
fellow at work in a gang at Toongabbe, threw down his hoe, and
advancing foremost, gave three cheers for liberty. This was well
received by his fellow convicts, but a magistrate being at hand,
it was put an&lt; end to, by securing this wild Irish advocate,
who was tied up, and rewarded by a severe flogging.</p>
<p>In a few days after this circumstance, the Governor visited
Toongabbe, and returning to Paramatta, met the prophetess, an old
Scotch woman, who, when she saw the Governor, held up her hands,
and begged he would for a few minutes listen to her, and she
would endeavour to confute the reports propagated in her name.
She said, she had heard he was offended with her; and she wished
to convince him, that it was totally false, and had arisen from a
man, who, as she made a little beer, and sold it to the labouring
people, had called for some one day at her hut, and entered into,
conversation with her about the expected arrival of ships with
stores from England. On this the old woman recounted a dream she
had the night before, and from which she was led to hope that
ships would soon arrive. Out of this conversation and dream, a
story had been fabricated, purporting that this poor old creature
had prophesied many extraordinary things.</p>
<p>His Excellency told her he saw through the whole, and desired
she would no longer be uneasy about the impression the first
account made on him. With this she appeared highly gratified; for
she had been much distressed before she had met with this
opportunity of informing him from whence this story
originated.</p>
<p>On the 2d of May, some of the Irishmen who had for sometime
been searching for a road to China, were brought in by the
settlers near George's river. They had wandered through the woods
till nearly perished for want of food, when they were discovered
in an unexpected way. Some people going from Botany Bay up
George's river, had lost themselves by following an arm of that
river never before looked into. During this mistake, they met
these people, whose want of knowledge of the country led them
down on a point of land placed between two waters, where they
remained nine days, unable to return, and must have perished had
not an accidental mistake led the people in the boat to them. The
narrative given of their travels and sufferings, were the same as
of other similar adventurers, and added one more to the many
already recounted to prove that daring folly and extreme
ignorance must be acting in strong conjunction over the minds of
those who made such attempts.</p>
<p>While such vagabonds were about the country, the safety of a
property was in danger. A bull-calf of an officer was stolen from
the herd, and though rewards were offered no information
transpired.</p>
<p>On the 14th, the Nautilus Brig, arrived from the island of
Otaheite, in great distress. This little vessel had lost her
passage to the N.W. coast of America, and had been at Kamscatka,
the Sandwich Islands, and Otaheite. Being infirm and nearly worn
out, the master found it impossible to repair his vessel at
either of those places, and had touched at Otaheite for the
refreshments they required, and then endeavoured to reach this
port, where they hoped to receive that assistance which would
enable them to proceed to India.</p>
<p>At Otaheite they found the missionaries sent from England, to
propagate the Christian religion, were not on such a footing as
they expected to be with the natives, being nearly shut up within
their little fortress. The natives had used threats, and made
known an intention of taking off their women. The arrival of this
vessel in some degree relieved them from the anxiety they had for
some time been under, and they determined to leave the island in
her. Mr. Bishop, her commander, paid them all the attention the
shattered state of the brig permitted, taking on board in all, 19
men, women, and children; and with great difficulty brought them
safe to Sydney, the vessel being so leaky as to require the
labour of all the company to keep her afloat. She was unable to
bring them all, leaving six or seven on the island. Those
arrived, were treated with attention, and all possible relief
afforded to their distresses.</p>
<p>On the 18th, the Barwell arrived from England, with male
convicts, stores, and provisions. The weak state of the public
gangs, even made the allotment of villainy which arrived in this
ship, an acquisition to the general strength.</p>
<p>The Barwell brought an account (from the Cape of Good Hope.)
of the Lady Shore transport being lost on her passage to New
South Wales, with 60 convicts, 57 females and 3 males, a large
assortment of stores, and a company for the New South Wales corps
on board, to whom was owing the loss of the ship; for after
murdering the commander, and his first mate, they carried the
ship into Rio de la Plata, where she was delivered up to the
Spaniards. Thank God, there is no port in the British dominions
ever open to receive the traitors of any country.</p>
<p>In the Barwell arrived a new Judge-Advocate*, in the room of
Captain Collins, who had resigned. Instructions now came from his
Majesty's Ministers to the Governor, on some points he had
requested orders, particularly to the number of labouring people
who had for such a length of time been allowed to the civil and
military officers at the public expense. These instructions
limited the number to two; and others they might be inclined to
employ were to be maintained and clothed by themselves; or if fed
and clothed at the public expense, to be paid for at a certain
rate, either in the produce of their farms, or otherways.</p>
<p align="center"><small>[* Mr Richard Dore]</small></p>
<p>Among the convicts received by the Barwell were some useful
mechanics; a truly valuable acquisition, as the Governor would be
enabled to discharge several free people.</p>
<p>On the 29th, the Reliance and Francis sailed for Norfolk
Island, carrying a proportion of the stores received by the
Barwell. On board of the Reliance were sent 100 casks of salt
provisions, and 1200 bushels of wheat.</p>
<p>The Governor having received several petitions and complaints
from the settlers at Norfolk Island, he caused the following
order to be sent thither for their information:&mdash;</p>
<p>"From the nature of the difficulties of which the settlers
upon Norfolk Island have complained, difficulties which have not
until very lately been known to have any existence, the Governor
is led to suspect, that the same rage for traffic, and an
intemperate indulgence in some of those destructive
gratifications which, have so effectually ruined, many of the
most forward and promising settlers in New South Wales, have
reached Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>"His Excellency, from an earnest desire to promote the
prosperity of the island, and the true happiness of its
inhabitants, has, since his arrival in this country, availed
himself of every opportunity of forwarding for their
accommodation a share of such little comforts, as accidental
ships may have brought hither. But he is sorry to observe, that
instead of those attentions being felt as an advantage, they
appear only to operate as an incitement to more extensive
dealings; a circumstance which he foresees must end in the ruin
of many of the settlers, for whose welfare he is extremely
anxious. He therefore urges them not to be led away from their
real interest, by speculative ideas, or a desire of indulging in
dangerous gratifications, squandering the whole produce of their
hard labour in trifles, or in scenes of dissipation which must
eventually end in their complete ruin. He desires that they will
persevere with patience in the management of their farms and the
rearing of stock; and assures them, that he has taken such steps
as he hopes will incline the Government to consider the
inconveniences which are sustained in this distant part of the
world, and induce them to adopt such measures as will procure the
colonists, before long, every European article that they may have
occasion for at a very moderate expense; and by that means put an
effectual stop to the impositions under which the industrious
settlers have too long laboured."</p>
<p>At the end of May, the settlers at the Northern farms were
much troubled by the natives, who came down in a body, and burnt
several houses. This was indeed unfortunate, as those farms had
very great industry bestowed on them; and as the land was of a
superior quality it had not but for these savages been thrown
away.</p>
<p>On the 14th, there was a shower of hailstones of a very large
size, most of them measuring six inches in circumference.</p>
<p>The Governor went to Paramatta on the 6th of June, to search
for a proper place, for settling as farmers some of the
missionaries from Otaheite, who wished to continue in New South
Wales; and some free settlers lately sent out by the Government,
who with their families arrived from England in the Barwell. It
is indeed very much to be lamented, that a single ship was ever
suffered to sail from England for this country, without a
portion, however small, of such persons, by which means the
country would have avoided many of the miseries it was exposed
to, in having, comparatively speaking, none but convicts to deal
with. On an examination of the country, he pronounced it superior
to any that had yet been seen, and in quantity equal to what was
wanted. This land was good, well watered, and easy to be cleared,
and only distant from five to six miles from Paramatta. Being
satisfied with the situation, he kindly recommended it to the
missionaries; but some of them seemed so undecided as to give the
Governor reason to suspect some busy, ignorant, and wicked person
or other had been giving them advice which might terminate much
to their disadvantage. However, several determined to settle
there, and in consequence received a portion of tools, grain, and
other assistance from the public stores.</p>
<p>Messrs. Campbell and Clarke of Calcutta, not discouraged by
the fate of their unfortunate ship, the Sydney Cove, sent out
another, which, in compliment to the Governor, they called the
Hunter, and sent by her an assortment of India goods, and some
cows and horses. This vessel arrived on the 10th of the month,
when the Governor determined to crush if possible, the spirit of
monopoly; to effect which he gave public notice, that the ship
had arrived with a cargo for sale, and that every inhabitant
might have an opportunity of buying what their circumstances
would afford, he directed that no part of the cargo should be
sold before the settlers had made known to him what sums of money
they could conveniently spare; and a day was appointed to receive
their accounts.</p>
<p>Orders were given, that no person should board any ship in the
harbour till she was properly secured in the Cove, and the master
had been with the Governor and received port orders.</p>
<p>Capt. Hamilton, late of the Sydney Cove, survived the arrival
of the Hunter only a few days. He never completely got the better
of the distresses he suffered on the loss of his ship, and as the
truly worthy, man generally gains esteem, though only a short
time in the country, he died much regretted by all who had the
pleasure of being acquainted with him.</p>
<p>Complaints having been made, that the people who brought grain
from the Hawkesbury to Sydney were practising numerous
impositions on the farmers, by false measures; the Governor
determined to put a stop to such robbery; directed the
magistrates of Sydney and Paramatta to order all measures to be
brought to Sydney, to be proved and marked; and made known that
any measure used without such mark would subject the owner to a
prosecution.</p>
<p>The want of a vessel for a more frequent intercourse with
Norfolk Island, having been felt, the commanding officer
constructed a small decked boat, sloop rigged, which arrived at
Port Jackson on the 15th; but for the want of a harbour at that
island, she was launched from the shore, and obliged to proceed
directly to sea. In consequence of which she proved very leaky;
but as two pumps had been fitted on board her, they were able to
keep the water under.</p>
<p>The maize harvest was all got in during June: but some
buildings were retarded by the rains which fell at the latter end
of it.</p>
<p>The situation of the Governor and other officers, employed in
the Government of the country, must have been particularly
distressing: ever anxious to protect the good, and to prevent and
punish the vile, who on their part were racking their too
powerful inventions to elude, if only for a moment, the paternal
care which the government took of its subjects. Perhaps if we
look back in history we may account for the origin, increase, and
growth of despotic governments; from the same causes as that
vileness too general among the ignorant, must have caused an
increase of severity in those regulations first established for
the good of the whole, and thus form eventually, that climax of
despotism, which in the more modern periods of history are found
overthrown.</p>
<p>On the 1st of July arrived the Cornwall, Southern whaler, the
master of which brought an account that some Spanish cruizers had
appeared off Cape Horn, the whalers of the Southern fishery were
directed to pass into these seas during the war. Tins ship was
followed by two others, the Eliza from the Cape of Good Hope, and
the Sally.</p>
<p>This circumstance promised some advantages to the settlement.
The whale fishing on the coast would most certainly be
effectually tried, and the existence, and positions of shoals,
harbours, or rivers, be ascertained.</p>
<p>Having in a few days refitted, the 3 whalers sailed on their
fishing voyages. Previous to which, the Argo, an American
schooner, arrived from the Isle of France, having on board a
cargo of salt provisions, French brandy, and other articles on
speculation; which, as usual in this country, found a ready sale,
much more to the advantage of the owners than the colonists, As
this ship came from the Mauritius, the Governor entertained some
jealousy, certainly founded on probability; and, as it was not
any ways impossible, that, under neutral colours, a spy might be
concealed, he thought it requisite to put the battery on Point
Maskelyne, into a more secure state, and to construct two
redoubts in proper and convenient situations for offensive and
defensive warfare, should it prove requisite.</p>
<p>On the 18th arrived the Britannia whaler from England, with 94
female convicts, who being landed, some were sent to Paramatta
and Toongabbe. The cattle that were brought in the Hunter, were
at this time sold by auction, and were not greater objects of
contest than the newly-arrived females, as the number of that sex
in the colony bore no proportion to the men.</p>
<p>The Reliance and Francis returned the 25th and 27th of this
month, from Norfolk Island, having been absent 60 days; the
Reliance, on her passage back, meeting with blowing weather and
much sea all the way.</p>
<p>By her, the commanding officer, wrote from Norfolk Island,
that a most improper association had been entered into by the
settlers and others, which they termed the Fraternal Society of
Norfolk Island; and which, among others, had for its object the
uniting for the purpose of distressing the Government, by
withholding the produce of their farms from the store; in
consequence of some misconduct on the part of the store-keepers,
who suffered the same monopoly to take place there, as was
complained of at Sydney. They wrote at the same time to the
Governor, denying giving any name to their meeting, but heavily
complaining; that, "after much expense and trouble in rearing
swine, the storekeepers would not receive it."</p>
<p>The Governor highly and justly censured this manner of
assembling, and in a printed notice which he sent to them, told
the inhabitants, that if they felt any grievance, whether real or
supposed, they must submit their complaints to the commanding
officer of the settlement, by one or two persons elected for that
purpose, and not by a numerous body of people. Every other mode
of attempting to gain redress was illegal, and could only tend to
expose those who might be concerned therein to a very
considerable degree of danger, which he would most undoubtedly
inflict.</p>
<p>In the course of this month was tried an incorrigible
offender, John Raynor, who was convicted of house-breaking, and
accordingly executed, which fate he had often merited. He left a
letter previous to his execution, in which he enumerated many of
the offences he had committed, and denied some with which he had
been charged.</p>
<p>Various complaints, were made of the profligacy of the women;
who, from having met too much indulgence on account of their sex,
were grown, as might be naturally expected, so idle and insolent,
that they would not, unless forced, do any thing but nurse their
children; an excuse very few were without. If their value might
be estimated by the fineness of the children with which they had
prodigiously increased the numbers in the settlements, they would
have been found deserving every care and attention; but their
vices, too conspicuous and prominent to admit of much palliation,
rendered them objects of detestation.</p>
<p>The heavy rains which had fallen this month and last, having
much damaged the public road between Sydney and Paramatta, two
gangs were employed in repairing them. The weather was much
colder than usual at this season, and in the interior, there was
a sharp frost during the night.</p>
<p>An order having been given in the beginning of August, for
assembling the court of civil judicature, a recommendation to the
inhabitants was added, "that when any bargain, contract, or
agreement, was made between any party or parties, on any subject
whatsoever, the same should be reduced to writing, specifying in
direct and clear terms what the nature of such bargain or
contract might be, and causing the same to be properly witnessed,
and subscribed by the parties concerned." This measure was to
prevent disputes, litigation, and misunderstandings among them,
and to avoid the inconvenience which the members of the court
experienced, when convened, from the loose and careless manner in
which business was brought before them.</p>
<p>On the 1st of this month the regulation relative to the number
of public servants which the officers were allowed to retain,
commenced.</p>
<p>It now became too obvious, that, instead of employing each
Sunday in the performance of those duties for which that day was
set apart, it was passed in committing every vile act of
dissipation, the overseers of the gangs were ordered to see their
men mustered every Sunday morning, and to attend with them at
church. The superintendants and constables were to see this order
complied with, and that the women (who, as in all cases when they
are really bad, are much worse than the men) were strictly looked
after, and made to attend divine service regularly. And, as
example was thought might (as inmost cases), do something, the
officers were ordered not only to send a number of their
servants, but they were all called on, civil and military, to
assist in the execution of this order; and the magistrates were
required to pay their attention, in compelling a proper obedience
to it, by preventing the opening of the public houses during
divine service, as well as any other irregularity on that
day.</p>
<p>On the 20th, arrived the Pomona and Diana, whalers belonging
to the Southern fishery.</p>
<p>The Governor desirous of having that part of the coast
surveyed in which a strait was supposed to exist (between the
latitude of 39&deg; 00' S. and the land previously deemed the
Southern Promontory of New South Wales, and called Van Diemen's
land), his Excellency resolved to send Mr. Bass, and Lieut.
Flinders of the Reliance, on that service, in the small decked
boat which lately arrived from Norfolk Island, which was named
the Norfolk, after the Island on which she was built, for which
purpose she was properly fitted up.</p>
<p>The powder magazine having been found to be in an insecure and
dangerous state, the pow der was removed on board the Supply.
This indeed was very necessary, for an attempt had been made to
break open the door of the magazine.</p>
<p>The mind, fatigued by the enormities of the convicts, will at
least find relief by contemplating the transactions of those,
from whose nature nothing but savage actions can well be
expected, for in this way the natives now claim attention.</p>
<p>A young female, related to Bennillong, who had resided from
infancy at Sydney, was shockingly murdered; and a native of
Botany Bay had driven a spear through the body of a lad called
Nanberrey. The name of the girl was War-re-weer; but to
distinguish her, as there were others of that name, an addition
was made founded on a personal defect, she being blind of one
eye, she was called War-re-weer Wo-gul Mi (one eye), The girl
being killed, and Nanbarrey wounded, caused great violence from
their friends, among which were Cole-be and Bennillong; the
former meeting with the man who wounded the boy, revenged the
treatment he received so completely that the murderer died of his
wounds the next morning. Bennillong, in consequence of this, was
attacked when alone by two men, and defended himself with the
greatest address, and would have defeated both, had they kept
fairly in front; but one of them, with the treachery very common
to those savages, skulked behind, and threw a spear with such
violence that it entered his side seven inches into the cavity of
his body. He was taken on board the Reliance, where at first the
wound was attended with very unfavourable symptoms as nothing
remained on his stomach.</p>
<p>As the death of the young man slain by Cole-be was of course
to be revenged, a body of the Southern natives fought those of
Sydney for that purpose a few days after. The contest was carried
on with much desperation on both sides; three natives were
killed, and many wounded, among whom was Bennillong, who, having
recovered of his wound, appeared and fought on this occasion for
Cole-be, like a good, honest, faithful, friend.</p>
<p>The weather, which in the last month was remarkably cold, but
at the end of this was sultry, accompanied by high winds, which
set many parts of the country on fire, and destroyed much
property; when the Surveyor-General's house, and every article in
it, was consumed.</p>
<p>The Barwell being ready for sea, sailed on the 17th of August
for China. Capt. Cameron, her commander, was permitted to take on
board fifty men who had completed their period of transportation,
and kindly offered to touch at Norfolk Island for any purpose the
Governor might wish. By this ship Mr. Campbell, who arrived in
the Hunter from Bengal, took his passage to China; and by this
gentleman the Governor sent a letter to the Governor-General of
India, informing him, that "having transmitted to the Secretary
of State, copies of the letters upon the subject of raising
recruits in this country for the army in India, which had been
received in the year 1796, it was the opinion of his Majesty's
Ministers, that the inconveniencies attending such a measure
would more than counterbalance the advantages of it, and
permission for that purpose could not therefore be granted."</p>
<p>Indeed, had it been carried into execution, the army in India
would not have been much benefited; since, if the recruiting
officers were as nice as their instructions directed them to be
as to the point of character, small would be the number of
recruits.</p>
<p>In order to encourage the rearing of swine, as well as of
every other live-stock, the settlers and others had notice given
them that when any of them had prepared any number fit for the
public store, they might make it known to the Commissary, who to
prevent unnecessary expense or trouble, would inform them of the
day and place he would receive them. He was also at liberty to
contract for a given time, with any persons who would furnish
either of the public stores at Sydney, Paramatta, or the
Hawkesbury.</p>
<p>The Hunter Snow, Fern, commander, having found a voyage to New
South Wales was no bad speculation, resolved to derive some
profit from his return, as it was understood, when he sailed on
the 20th, that he was bound for New Zealand, for the purpose of
cutting spars for the Bengal market.*</p>
<p><small>[* Mr. Robert Campbell, who returned to Port Jackson,
said, that Capt. Fern proceeded to the river Thames in New
Zealand, where his crew cut down a quantity of spars, large
enough to load his vessel; and being short of hands, he could not
have shipped them, but that the natives with much alacrity
assisted in getting them to the water's side.]</small></p>
<p>Two men who had been exploring the country to the North West
of Richmond Hill and the river Hawkesbury, found the bones of two
mares which had been stolen from Paramatta.</p>
<p>On the 1st of October, the Semiramis, from Rhode Island, bound
to China, arrived, after a passage of three months and nine
days.</p>
<p>In the evening of the same day, the church on the East side of
the Cove was discovered to be on fire. Every assistance was
given, but ineffectually; for as the building was covered with
thatch, which was exceedingly dry, it was completely consumed in
an hour.</p>
<p>This was a great loss and calculated to impede the progress of
morality, as during the week it was used as a school, for 200
children to be educated, under the Rev. Mr. Johnson. As the
Church stood alone, and no person was suffered to remain in it
after the school hours, there was no doubt that it was the effect
of design, in consequence of the late order to enforce attendance
on divine service which had been rigidly executed; with a view of
rendering, by the destruction of the building, the Sabbath a day
of as little decency and sobriety as any other. The perpetrators
were, however, disappointed; for the Governor, justly deeming
this to have been the motive, and highly irritated at such a
shameful act, resolved, if no convenient place could be found for
the performance of public worship, that Sunday, instead of being
employed as each thought proper, the labouring gangs should be
employed that day in erecting another church. However, as a large
store-house was just finished, it was fitted up as a church; and
thus not one Sunday did this wicked design affect the regular
performance of divine service.</p>
<p>A reward of 30<i>l</i>. was offered for the discovery of the
offender, with emancipation to the informer if a convict, and a
recommendation to the master of a ship to take him or her from
the settlement. But rewards and punishments alike failed to
effect any good among the convicts.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<p align="center">[Bass and Flinders explore Van Diemen's
Land]</p>
<p><small>ON</small> the 7th of October, the Semiramis and Argo
sailed for China; and the Nautilus Brig, with the Norfolk
long-boat, sailed for Van Diemen's land. The Nautilus, which had
been in extreme distress for every kind of repair, was completely
refitted; but as two men, who had the care of the cargo with
which she was sent out from India, had been very unfortunate
through the bad state of their vessel, they were determined to
try during this season, how productive the seal-fishing among the
islands to the Southward would prove.</p>
<p>On the 8th sailed the Francis for Norfolk Island, with a few
women and stores. It was intended she should on her return,
examine a shoal on the Northward of Lord Howe Island, and, if
possible, ascertain the situation of an island discovered by
Lieut. Shortland, in the Alexander transport, and named by him
Sir Charles Middleton Island. Lieut. John Shortland, of the
Reliance, son of the before-mentioned officer, was sent in the
Francis, charged with the direction of the vessel on that
service.</p>
<p>On board the Norfolk sailed Lieut. Flinders and Mr. Bass, who
were instructed to examine the strait supposed to divide Van
Diemen's land from the continent.</p>
<p>The great rage for trade before spoken of, prevailing so
universally in the colony, occasioned continual scenes of
contentions and litigation among the inhabitants; so much that
inconvenience was felt in the liberties taken of imprisoning the
convicts, servants of the crown, for debts due to the dealers,
notwithstanding an order which was given by Governor Phillip, in
which the colony were informed, that the public servants
(convicts) had no property, their clothing, time, and labour,
being the property of Government, and not at their own disposal.
This order having wilfully worn out of recollection, it was
become requisite to renew it, and thus prevent that loss of
labour on the public works which imprisoning their persons must
occasion. Notice was therefore again given, that the servants of
the crown should not be imprisoned; and if any person was
desirous of giving them credit, it must be on the strength of
their own good opinion of such people; and it was now again to be
generally understood, that government would not dispense with
their labour for any private dealings.</p>
<p>On the 11th in the evening, a fire broke out in the town of
Sydney, which, but for great care and activity, would have
destroyed every house on the East side. A row of buildings lately
erected for the nurses and others employed in and about the
hospital, was set on fire, and consumed; and the flames nearly
reached the boat-yard.</p>
<p>On the 20th of October, the Ann and Hope, an American ship,
anchored in Botany Bay, contrary winds having prevented her
reaching Port Jackson. The master wanted wood and water, and as
three days proved time enough to procure them, at their
expiration he sailed for China.</p>
<p>At the end of this month the Governor made an excursion among
the settlers at Hawkesbury; and while there, made several
regulations for the sawyers, who fixed their own portion of the
public labour. His Excellency informed them that a session was to
be held every three months for settling all civil concerns in
future. The farms he found in general promising the greatest
plenty, but the houses and persons of the settlers wore the
appearance of poverty and beggary, as they still continued
converting the produce of their farms to the purpose of obtaining
pernicious spirits which must ever keep them poor and
wretched.</p>
<p>On the 27th, the Marquis Cornwallis arrived from the Cape of
Good Hope, with cattle on Government account, amounting to 158
cows and 20 bulls, and a few on private account. When landed,
some appeared weakly; but generally speaking, they were in good
health, and proved a vast acquisition to the colony; some of the
cows being a mixed breed between the Cape and English cattle, and
the whole seemed to be under the age of three years.</p>
<p>At the same time arrived the Indispensable, a Southern whaler,
commanded by Mr. Wilkinson, but she sailed again immediately.</p>
<p>During this month the foundation of a stone building intended
for a church, was laid at Sydney. It was intended to be 150 feet
in length, and 52 in breadth. Similar preparations were making at
Paramatta, but of a smaller size than those at Sydney.</p>
<p>In November the criminal court of judicature met twice, for
the trial of several offenders; one of whom convicted of perjury,
stood in the pillory agreeable to his sentence.</p>
<p>Bennillong, who might have continued living at the Governor's
house, preferred the dangerous society of his own countrymen,
only visiting the settlement when the recollection of the
comforts he could no where else enjoy, oppressed him too
powerfully. Information was brought of his having again been
wounded in a contest with some of the other natives. Bennillong
had received and recovered of many wounds, any single one of
which would have destroyed an European. The natives certainly owe
their fortunate recoveries more to their good habit of body than
to any other cause.</p>
<p>A fatal instance of effects of improper conduct, and keen
sense of criminality, was exemplified in the melancholy end of
Nathaniel Franklin, the Governor's steward. This man he brought
from England, and intrusted the entire care and management of his
domestic concerns to him. He had been very often cautioned by his
Excellency against the various artful and (fatiguing
acquaintances he had formed, and was particularly desired to
guard against not suffering himself to be led away by their
opinions. It appeared he had, very unfortunately, not possessed
fortitude enough to withstand their infernal solicitations, but
had consented to rob his kind protector, the Governor, to a very
large amount; thus abusing the unlimited confidence he had placed
in him, and made a most iniquitous use of his name. At length
touched by the glaring infamy of his conduct, he retired into a
shrubbery in the Governor's garden, and there shot himself
through the head; thus at once shewing the divine truth of that
excellent proverb, "evil communications corrupt good
manners".</p>
<p>The continual complaints made daily respecting the misconduct
of the convict women, made it requisite to take some steps which
should make them clearly understand the nature of their situation
in the colony, and the several duties they were liable to
perform. The Governor therefore desired every officer or
house-keeper, who had any female servant, to forward to the
Judge-Advocate's office, the names of those employed; and he
forbid them to shield from public labour any but those they were
permitted to retain; and if at any time they might wish to
discharge any such servants, to send information of such design,
with a character of the person, to the same office.</p>
<p>Time which destroys every thing in all parts of the world, in
his ravages, seemed particularly anxious to shew his power in New
South Wales, where, though building had been but a very few years
attempted, many had been rebuilt, and at this time the roof of
the Government house at Paramatta was falling in, and the
building on being surveyed, was found so weak and decayed as not
to admit of repairs; therefore it was resolved to take it down,
and build a new one; for which purpose a number of brick-makers
were sent to the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The ship's company of the Supply were actively and usefully
employed at Sydney, in constructing a half-moon battery on the
East point of the Cove, where stood the house built for
Bennillong by Governor Phillip.</p>
<p>On the 25th, a violent burst of thunder, with whirlwinds, was
felt, by which several buildings were considerably damaged.</p>
<p>On the 3d of December, when the departure of the Marquis
Cornwallis took place, for Bengal, several convicts were taken
from the settlement without the formality of permission.</p>
<p>The harvest began last month was completed this. Of the
abundance fondly expected, all were disappointed; owing to an
unfortunate drought in the course often months, the wheat did not
turn out more than one-third the quantity of grain, that there
was a rational expectation it would have produced, had the season
been otherwise.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the harvest a slight disturbance took
place among the Irish convicts at Toongabbe. Each man and woman
who had been employed, having received a small quantity of
spirits and water, which was ordered to be given them, its first
effect was cheerful pleasantry, but it terminated in riot; a
circumstance by no means uncommon with those people. They were
however soon separated and sent to their huts.</p>
<p>On the 19th, the Francis arrived from Norfolk Island, leaving
all there in good health. Lieut Shortland, agreeable to his
directions, searched for Sir Cha. Middleton Island and shoal, and
returned with his journal, and a chart of the several traverses
he made in quest of the island, and compared them with some made
by Lieut. (now Captain) Ball, of his Majesty's armed brig Supply,
when sent by Governor Phillip on the same pursuit. The extensive
range taken by those officers in the search, and not having met
with any indications of land near that situation, left little
reason to believe the existence of an island. That of the shoal
was not doubtful; and, although Mr. Shortland did not fall in
with it, yet as a shoal had been seen near the spot in which that
reef was laid down, there was every reason to believe that a bank
Or shoal did exist thereabout; but its exact situation in point
of latitude and longitude had not yet been correctly fixed, nor
was its extent supposed to be so great as was at first
believed.</p>
<p>The 25th, was properly observed as Christmas-day, in the
evening the Nautilus arrived from the Southward. She had been at
Preservation Island, where, and in the neighbouring islands, she
had been successful in seal-catching. The master left 14 of his
people on the island of Cape Barren, to provide as many skins and
as much oil as they could against his return. Those he brought
with him were in a few days sold at Sydney.</p>
<p>The Indispensable and Britannia whalers, which had been
fishing on the coast, returned on the 29th to repair and refresh
their crews. They had cruized from the latitude of 32&deg; 00',
to 35&deg; 00' and not farther from the coast than from. 20 to 30
leagues, and thought themselves successful, one having got 54,
and the other 60 tons of spermaceti oil.</p>
<p>The Eliza put into Botany Bay, to wood and water; but though
much longer at sea had not met with equal success, obtaining only
45 tons of oil. The master said he saw off the N.E. part of New
Caledonia, a ship on shore on a reef, the lower masts of which
were above water; but the weather being thick and hazy, and
blowing too fresh to allow him to examine her; but as a piece of
a boat, seemingly part of a whale-boat, floated near him, he
judged it to be the wreck of a whaler; and he also fell in with a
seriously dangerous and extensive shoal, lying N.N.W. 40 leagues
from Sandy Cape, on the coast of New South Wales. It was so
extensive, that finding himself on it, and not being able to get
back, it took him some considerable time to run through it.</p>
<p>Three deaths happened this month out of the regular course: a
woman died of the bite of a snake; another was drowned in
attempting to land at Norfolk Island; and on the 19th died,
suddenly, Mr. Stephenson, the storekeeper at Sydney. His death
was not in the usual way, neither had been the last few years of
his life; for by an upright conduct, and a faithful discharge of
the duties of his office, he secured to himself the approbation
of his superiors. He had been emancipated for his good behaviour,
and thus enabled to execute the office of storekeeper.</p>
<p>As the election of constables took place annually in December,
the magistrates were requested to be very particular in the
persons returned for that purpose; as there was reason, from many
causes, to fear, that the frequent escapes of prisoners from
goal, must have been attended with that uniform success they met
with, by the constables being tampered with, so shameful was
their neglect of that duty entrusted to their care.</p>
<p>The wheat harvest over, the country, as happened too generally
at this season, was in many places on fire, when every person
engaged in farming was reminded of the necessity of exerting
themselves to secure their crops, against accidents by fire. An
admonition one would have thought by no means requisite, as it so
very materially concerned their own interest; but it serves to
shew that those not anxious for the public good, were careless
even of their own. In the early part of December, the thermometer
at the Hawkesbury stood at 107 degrees.</p>
<p>Many persons were much afflicted with inflammations of the
eyes, accompanied with extreme pain, which was supposed by the
faculty to be occasioned by the dry, sultry weather which
prevailed some time. Dysenteric complaints, which were attributed
to the water, most of the runs and springs being nearly dried up.
The tanks cut in the rocks, below the stream by order of Governor
Phillip had proved of the greatest utility.</p>
<p>The seamen of the Supply finished a half-moon battery this
month, and part of that ship's guns were mounted in it, and thus
formed a very respectable addition to the strength of the
colony's defence.</p>
<p>Among other works, some were employed in white-washing the
houses in Sydney, and repairing the buildings which required it;
an highly necessary attention once in very year, for the general
preservation; the re-construction of which, if suffered to decay,
was attended with a great expense both of money and labour, the
latter of which was of more consequence than the former as there
were but few comparatively to work, and small indeed was the
quantity of it to be obtained from them.</p>
<p>The live-stock and the ground in cultivation, will be seen to
have very much increased this year, by the following account of
each.</p>

<p>If to the increase of live-stock, and cultivated land, could
be added an increase of morality or improvement among the
convicts, it would afford the mind infinite satisfaction, but
alas! the earth itself and the beasts of the field have shown
forth the bounty of the creator; while these beings have lived
only to profane the name and goodness of him who suffered them to
exist.</p>
<p><b>1799.]</b></p>
<p>On the 2d of January, 1779 [1799?], several certificates were
given to convicts who had completed their terms of
transportation; and that no one might have the power of making a
plea of injustice being exercised with respect to their
servitude, a rule was made several times during the year, to
issue certificates to such as were entitled to them; and if they
desired to be at their own disposal, they were struck off the
victualling books. Many convicts sent out had not more than two
years to serve on their arrival, proved, by claiming their
discharge, a considerable drawback from the number of labourers
in Norfolk Island and New South Wales. By these means were let
loose on the public, a number of worthless characters, who became
very dangerous and troublesome, refusing every kind of labour,
though they neglected not to form connections with the worthless
part of the inhabitants, who from their peculiar situations, had
many opportunities of affording information where robberies of
all kinds could be most readily and successfully committed.
Still, as the sentenced period had expired, there was no denying
them without injustice, the restoration of their freedom. The
convicts in general had for several months suffered much, for
want of clothing and bedding, for, during the late harvest they
laboured in the fields, as totally divested of clothing as any
native savages in the country. In consequence of which many
anonymous letters were dropped, in which were threatened what
vile actions would be effected at the season they knew many
opportunities would offer.</p>
<p>About this time, when certificates were to be granted, a
numerous body, particularly of Irish convicts, many of whom had
only lately reached the country, asserted in the most turbulent
manner "their times were out", nor would they at first he
persuaded they laboured under, a mistake; when growing insolent,
they used threats; on which some of the most daring were secured
and punished, after which they went peaceably to their work.</p>
<p>The unfortunate produce of the harvest, now proved a most
serious cause of regret, for the wheat was little more than
straw; and the maize burnt in the ground for want of rain. Indeed
from the establishment of the colony, so long a drought and great
continuance of heat had not been known. The country was now
nearly every where in flames, and even the wind was parching, and
a very few showers which fell proved of no advantage, being
instantly drawn up by the excessive heat.</p>
<p>On January the 12th, arrived the Norfolk, with Lieut. Flinders
and Mr. Bass, from the examination of Van Diemen's land, of which
voyage these gentlemen gave the following interesting
particulars:</p>
<p>Sailing, as stated, in October last, on the 11th, when nearly
off Cape Howe, they were met by a fresh gale at S.W. on which
they bore up, gained, and cast anchor in Twofold Bay. Mr. Bass
had visited this Bay when on the coast before in the whale-boat;
but had not then an opportunity to examine it as he wished, but
now he ascertained Twofold Bay to be situated at the South end of
a chain of hills, one part of which is more conspicuous than the
rest, laying behind the bay. The land on the West side of this
chain of hills, is both high and rocky. The shore divided into
steep cliff heads, with small beaches; the one formed by the
foremost ridges, and the others by the sand thrown up at the foot
of the vallies, and ponds of brackish water were found behind the
beaches.</p>
<p>The sudden rise of the hills permit the vegetable earth to be
washed down into the vallies, and some of the gradual slopes
retain enough of it to produce a thick coat of grass; however the
soil partakes too much of the stoney quality of the higher parts
for cultivation.</p>
<p>The hills and vallies produce large timber and brush-wood; on
the hills, the brush-wood grows in small clumps; but in the
vallies it not only covers all the surface, but is bound together
by creeping vines of various sizes.</p>
<p>In the S.W. corner of the bay, is a small inlet that
communicates with the sea, through the beach at the back of which
it lies. The chain of hills here runs back some distance from the
water, and leaving some miles of good ground, through which the
inlet takes its course to the S.W. for six or eight miles, where
it ends in swamps and marshes. On its banks they saw some hundred
acres of alight sandy soil, in patches of from 50 to 100 acres
each; but on the mountain side, it soon became stoney, and on
that next the inlet it was wet and salt.</p>
<p>The country on the back of the bay is formed of round stoney
hills hardly fit for pasturage, but covered with timber, and
patches of short brush-wood.</p>
<p>On the South side, they found another shallow inlet, larger
than the other, running in by the end of a beach, and winding
along to the S.S.W. with little low ground on its borders, but
the returning tide did not allow them time to proceed to its
head.</p>
<p>On the East side, the hills not being either steep or
prominent, several large slopes of good though sandy soil, were
discovered to have been formed. Some of which extended to the
water, well covered with grass, and thinly set with timber, which
formed a beautiful appearance from the bay. Speaking of the land
round the bay, these Gentlemen observed, it might be said it was
more barren than productive; that there were several spots of
tolerable good, and some of excellent soil; but the greater part
incapable of cultivation, and fit only for pasturage.</p>
<p>The most common timber they saw was a species of gum tree, the
bark of which on the trunk is that of the iron bark of Port
Jackson; and its leaf, that of the gum tree; its branches near
the head are of a yellow colour, smooth, and resembling the
barked limbs of trees. The wood longer grained, and tougher,
splitting with more truth than any other kinds of the gum
tree.</p>
<p>The natives in person were similar to those about Port
Jackson, but their language was unintelligible. They used canoes,
and seemed to well know the value of them; for on rowing round
the point of Snug Cove, when Mr. Bass was on a former visit, a
party of them paddled on shore, took their canoes upon their
heads, and ran off with them to the woods. However, they did not
now appear quite so shy as formerly; and there was every reason
to imagine that a friendly intercourse might have been
established.</p>
<p>As the very few spears seen here were made of solid wood,
Messrs. Bass and Flinders conjectured, that the grass reed spear
used by the natives of Port Jackson was not known among these
people.</p>
<p>Few marks of the kangaroo were seen, and both quadrupeds and
birds appeared to be far less numerous here than in most other
places. The dogs accompanying the voyagers found a porcupine
ant-eater, which they could make no impression on; he escaped by
burrowing in the loose sand, sinking himself directly downwards,
and not head foremost, thus presenting his prickly back, opposed
his adversaries to the last.</p>
<p>[The following inserted into 2nd Edition]</p>
<blockquote>[In this respect, Van Diemen's land resembles New
South Wales, where the Porcupine Ant Eaters are likewise to be
seen in very great numbers. They are very good eating; they
burrow like rabbits, and have a long tongue, which when they put
out of their mouth, the Ants immediately croud upon it as if they
were lured by a kind of charm.<br>
<br>
The Koolah, or Sloth, having a false belly, is also found here.
This animal when it ascends a tree, never quits it till it has
stripped it of its leaves. It is mostly found to the southward
and northward of Broken Bay, among the deep ravines. Wherever the
leaves of the gum tree are found eaten off, it is a certain sign
that this creature is near. It is usually found with a companion,
in a manner folded together. Two stuffed specimens of these are
to be seen in Mr. Bullock's Museum.<br>
<br>
A species of the Hyena has lately been seen at Port Dalrymple,
extremely fierce, having a very large mouth, strong sharp claws,
and very strongly limbed. It is striped all over, and being of
the Opossum kind, has also a false belly. This creature here does
not attack human beings, but confines its ravages to sheep and
poultry.<br>
<br>
The Flying Mice here are very handsome. Their tail resembles a
feather; the belly is white, and the back brown. The down which
covers this little creature, is as soft as satin.<br>
<br>
Many of the reptiles in this country have lately been found to be
of a venemous nature. The bite of the several kinds of Coluber,
or Snake, has proved fatal in various instances. It is very
remarkable that at Norfolk Island, about three hundred leagues
from the nearest coast of New South Wales, there are no reptiles
to be found of any description, though at Philip Island, only
seven miles distant, several kinds are found, particularly the
Centepede, the Tarantula, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
The Deer in the colony, originally from India, thrive very well;
and though not so fat as in England, are supposed to be of
superior flavour.<br>
<br>
Native green currants grow wild, and make an uncommonly fine
jelly. A wild cherry is also found in the settlement, with the
stone on the outside, of a red colour; but nearly unfit to eat;
as also a wild fig, full of seed, equally as unpalatable as the
cherry, though eaten by the natives. Strawberries grow to great
perfection; but no English currant, gooseberry or cherry trees.
Pines, far exceeding those in England, are now growing on the
colony. Melons are large, and plentiful. Botany Bay greens are
abundant; they much resemble sage in appearance; and are esteemed
a very good dish by the Europeans, though disliked by the
natives. Some coffee trees were planted by a French settler, but
he died before he could bring them to perfection.<br>
<br>
With respect to flowers, Geraniums flourish in such abundance
that they are formed into hedges in various parts of the
settlement. They are always in leaf and flower, and emit a most
fragrant odour to a great distance.<br>
<br>
Cedar and Coals are the produce of the Newcastle
District.&mdash;Manna has also been found near Port Dalrymple;
but the most valuable of recent discoveries are the white,
yellow, and large brilliant topazes, exceeding in worth those of
the Brazils.<br>
<br>
The Spice tree found here is a very strong aromatic, and
possesses a more pungent quality than pepper. It produces a
berry, which as well as the bark, is of a very powerful spicy
nature. Fustic, a wood which makes the finest yellow dye, has
been discovered at Newcastle, in New South Wales. The indigo
found in different parts could never be brought to
perfection.<br>
<br>
But to return to Van Diemen's Land:]</blockquote>
<p>A few ducks, teal, herons, cranes, and red-bills were seen on
the lagoons, and some flights of curlews and plovers.</p>
<p>The rocks consist of hard clay, mixed with great numbers of
small stones, variously coloured, some with red, others with
yellow. Some calcareous spar lay scattered on the surface of the
ground; strata of which were deposited in fissures formed in the
bodies of the locks.</p>
<p>Leaving Twofold Bay, they proceeded to the Southward, and on
the 17th, made a small cluster of Islands, in latitude 38&deg;
16', which now bears the name of Kent's Group. These arc six: or
seven in number, of various sizes. Their height is considerable,
and as irregular in figure as can well be imagined. This group
appears formed of granite, which is imperfectly concealed by long
straggling dwarfish brush, and some few still more diminutive
trees. Nature is either working slowly on these islands, or has
ceased to work on them, since a more deserted place is no where
to be met with. The birds seemed not to frequent them in their
usual numbers. Indeed there was nothing to tempt the explorers
even to land.</p>
<p>Passing Kent's Group, and standing to the Southward, next
morning Furneaux's Islands were in sight, and on the following
day they anchored at Preservation Island, which is one of them.
These islands, from what was now and before seen of them by Mr.
Bass, appeared to consist of two kinds, perfectly dissimilar in
figure, but alike in the materials they are formed of. Both are
of granite; but the one is low, and rather level, with a soil of
sand covered with brush-wood and tufted grass: the other is high
and rocky, and cut into a variety of peaks. Some vegetable soil
lies on these, and the vegetation is large; and trees of a
tolerable size are produced in some places. There are attached to
some parts of these islands low sandy land, of the same height
with the lower islands.</p>
<p>Preservation Island, is of the humble class of islands and of
a moderate height. A surface of sand, mixed with vegetable soil,
scarcety hides from view the base of granite. In several places
vast blocks of this stone lie scattered about, as free from
vegetation and the injuries of weather as if they had but just
fallen; and, what is remarkable, most of them are entirely
detached from the stone on which they rest. It seemed that these
blocks had fallen from some place higher than on which they were
found; but that was at the same time deemed impossible, for they
were then higher than any other part of the island. It is
certainly more probable, that subterraneous or volcanic fire
might have caused their appearance.</p>
<p>The bulk of these blocks render them so conspicuous, that the
attention is first taken by them on approaching the island. But,
besides granate, there is on the North side, where the island is
lowest, a slip of calcareous earth, which discovers itself near
the surface of the water. It is not pure, for broken pieces of
the granite are mixed with it. Some parts are a mere mass of
these pieces, cemented by the calcareous matter; others are a
perfect chalk, and may be burnt into excellent lime. Broken sea
shells and other exuvi&aelig; of marine animals are apparent
throughout the whole mass.</p>
<p>Upon the beach near this chalky rock, were found a
considerable quantity of black metallic particles, which appeared
in the granite as black shining specks, and are undoubtedly
grains of tin.</p>
<p>It excited much surprise to find this bed of the remains of
shell animals, of which chalk is formed wherever found; and Mr.
Bass endeavoured to investigate the cause of this deposit, by
examining the neighbouring parts; on which he was of opinion,
that as traces of the sea, and of the effects of running waters,
were discernable in various parts of the island, and particularly
in the vicinity of this deposit, it seemed probable it had been
formed by two streams of the tide, which when the island was
beneath the surface of the sea, having swept round a large lump
of rock, then met and formed an eddy, where every substance must
fall to the bottom. The lump of rocks is a rocky knowl, which
runs from the opposite side of the island nearly to the chalk. On
each side is a gap, through which the two streams have
passed.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the island seems starved; consisting only of
a few stunted trees; some patches of brush-wood, almost
impenetrable; tufts of sour wiry grass, and many low saltish
plants, principally of the creeping kind.</p>
<p>A spot on the East end of the island exhibited a phenomenon
not easily explicable by any laws of that class of natural
history to which it could be referrible.</p>
<p>In a patch of naked sand, on one of the most lofty parts of
the island, not less than 100 feet above the sea, within a few
hundred yards, lay scattered a number of broken branches of dead
trees, from one to three inches in diameter, and apparently of a
kind similar to the large brush-wood. Amid these branches were
seen sticking up several white stoney stumps, of sizes ranging
between the above diameters, and in height from a foot to a foot
and an half. Their form, together with a number of prongs,
projecting in different directions around their base, and
entering the ground in the manner of roots, presented a striking
resemblance to the stumps and roots of trees. They were extremely
brittle, a slight blow with a stick, being sufficient to break
them; and when taken into the hand, they broke to pieces with
their own weight.</p>
<p>When broke transversely, it was seen that the internal was
divided into interior or central, exterior or cortical. The
external part, which occupied various proportions of the whole,
resembled a fine white and soft grit-stone; but acids being
applied to them, shewed it to be combined with a considerable
portion of calcareous matter. The interior or central part was
always circular, seldom found the same diameter, or of the same
composition, on any two stumps. In some, the calcareous and sandy
matter had taken entire possession, so that the wood was
completely obliterated; but yet a central ring remained. In
others was a center chalk, quite white, which crumbled between
the fingers to powder; some consisted of chalk and brown earth,
and others had detained a few portions of their woody fibres, the
spaces between which were filled up with chalk or earth.</p>
<p>It appeared, when the people of the Sydney Cove came on the
island, the pieces of dead branches at this time lying round the
stumps, then formed, with them, the stem and branches of dead
trees completely. But by this time curiosity, and the frolics of
the horse landed from the Sydney Cove, had reduced them to the
state described.</p>
<p>Mr. Bass had been told that the trees when in a complete
state, rose from the stoney part; and that a living leaf was seen
upon the upper branches of one of them. But he could never learn
whether the stoney part of the stem was of an equal height in all
the trees.</p>
<p>To ascertain to what depth the petrification descended, Mr.
Bass scratched away the sand from the foot of many of the stumps,
and in no instance found it to have proceeded more than three or
four inches beneath the surface of the sand, for at that depth
the remains of the root came to view. There were parts of the
roots which had undergone an alteration similar to that which had
taken place in the stems: these established the limits of the
petrifying power; for they had felt it only either at their
outset from the bottom of the stems, or when, being obstructed in
their progress, they had arched upwards to the surface.</p>
<p>In accounting for the cause that produced this change in the
structure of the lower parts of the stems of these trees, Mr.
Bass professed the greatest diffidence. He found that all his
conjectures were best supported by existing facts, allowing
however, they were petrifactions, it is certain that there must
have existed a pond, in which the petrifying water was contained;
but the ground in their neighbourhood retained no traces of such
a receptacle. There were, indeed, near them, some few lumps or
banjos of sand, and vegetable earth held together by dead roots
of small trees, and elevated above the rest of the ground, but
the relative position of these with each other was so confused
and irregular, that nothing but the necessity of a once existing
reservoir could ever lead any one to conjecture that these might
have been parts of its bank. Mr. Bass concluded that this must
have been the case, and that the remainder of the bank had been
torn away, and the pond annihilated by some violent effort of
nature.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the narrowness of the island, many small
kangaroos were found in its brushy parts; but so many had been
destroyed by the people of Sydney Cove, that they now became
scarce.</p>
<p>The sooty petrel had appropriated a certain grassy part of the
island to herself, and retained her position with a degree of
obstinacy not easily to be overcome. For though it so happened,
that the store-house for the wrecked cargo was erected upon the
spot, and the people for more than a year gained the greater part
of the food from these birds, and were continually walking over
their habitations, yet at the end of that time the returning
flights in the evening were as numerous as they had been on their
first arrival.</p>
<p>When Mr. Hamilton, the commander of the Sydney Cove, quitted
the house, he left two hens sitting upon their eggs, some
breeding pigeons, and a bag of rice; but no traces were now to be
discovered either of the birds or their food. Probably as long as
they continued in doors, they did well; but that, when forced by
necessity to go abroad for food, they fell a sacrifice to the
rapacity of the hawks.</p>
<p>Several snakes with venemous fangs were found; but, no person
had been bit by them, so that the degree of their power was
unknown.</p>
<p>The water of the island was imagined to have been injurious to
the health of people of the Sydney Cove. Being supposed to
contain arsenic, which seemed highly probable from an experiment
made with the metallic particles, which were thought to be tin. A
fume of which bore many marks of arsenic arising from the
crucible during the time of smelting it. Water was very scarce
while these people were upon the island; but, owing to some
unusual falls of rain, several little runs and swamps were found
by Mr. Bass; and a low piece of ground where they deposited their
dead was now a pond of an excellent quality.</p>
<p>Although he had seen but few of the low islands of Furneaux,
yet Mr. Bass had not any doubt but that this account of
Preservation Island would in general answer for the description
of any of them.</p>
<p>He next describes what he saw of Cape Barren Island, which he
understood, from the people of the Nautilus snow, was an exact
specimen of those of the higher kind, so far as they had observed
of them.</p>
<p>Cape Barren Island, which takes its name from the cape so
called by Captain Furneaux, is a small island when compared with
that lying to the northward of it. From what was seen of it in
the sloop, it could only be conjectured that these two were
separate Islands; but Mr. Bishop had passed in the Nautilus
through the channel that divides them.</p>
<p>This island is one of the higher kind that consists of both
high and low land. The high part composed of granite, in many
places, in others clothed with small gum trees, which draw their
support through some small quantity of vegetable earth lodged by
the broken blocks and fragments of stone, and some straggling
brush-wood shooting up round the trees.</p>
<p>The base of the low part is granite; the surface chiefly sand;
its produce, variety of brush-wood, with some few small gum
trees, and a species of fir, that grows tall and straight to the
height of twenty or twenty-five feet. Within the body of the
brush there are several clear spots, where the ground is partly
rocky or sandy, partly wet and spongy. These are somewhat
enlivened by beautiful flowering heath and low shrubs, but have a
dark aspect. A grass tree grows here, similar to that about Port
Jackson, except that no reed, either living nor dead, could be
found belonging to it. In the brushes, were a few tufts of grass;
but the greater part of it was the coarse sort that grows in
hassocks.</p>
<p>It is curious that a place where food seemed to be so scarce
should yet be thickly inhabited by the small brush kangaroo, and
a new quadruped, also a grass-eater.</p>
<p>This animal, being a new one, appears to deserve a particular
description. "The Wom-bat (or Womback) is a thick, short-legged,
inactive quadruped, with appearance of every strength, and bigger
than a turnspit dog. Its figure and movements, strongly bring to
mind the bear.</p>
<p>"Its length, from the tip of the tail to the tip of the nose,
is thirty-one inches, of which its body is twenty-three and
five-tenths. The head of this curious animal is seven inches. Its
circumference behind the fore-legs, twenty-seven inches; across
the thick part of the belly, thirty-one inches. Its weight is
between twenty-five and thirty pounds. The hair coarse, and about
one inch in length, thin on the belly, thicker on the back and
head, and thickest upon the loins and rump; the colour of it a
sandy brown, of varying shades, darkest along the back.</p>
<p>"The head is large and flattish, and, when looking the animal
full in the face, seems, excluding the ears, to form nearly an
equilateral triangle, any side of which is about seven inches in
length, but the upper side, or that which constitutes the breadth
of the head, is the shortest. The hair upon the face lies in
regular order, as if it were combed, with its ends pointed
upwards in a kind of radii, from the nose.</p>
<p>"The ears are sharp and erect, of two inches and three tenths
in length, stand well asunder, and are in nowise
disproportionate. The eyes are small, and rather sunk than
prominent, but quick and lively. They are placed about two inches
asunder, a little below the centre of the imaginary triangle
towards the nose. The nice co-adaption of their ciliary
processes, which are covered with a fine hair, seeming to afford
the animal the power of excluding whatever may be hurtful.</p>
<p>"The nose is large and spreading, the nostrils large, and
capable of being closed. They stand angularly, and a channel is
continued from them towards the tipper lip, which is divided like
the hare's. The whiskers are rather thick and strong, and are in
length from 2 to 3 inches.</p>
<p>"The mouth is small; which contains five long grass-cutting
teeth in the front of each jaw, within them is a vacancy of an
inch, then appear two small canine teeth of equal height with,
and so similar to, eight molares situated behind, as scarcely to
be distinguishable from them. The whole number in both jaws
amount to twenty-four.</p>
<p>"The neck is thick and short, and greatly restrains the
motions of the head, which looks as if it was stuck on the
shoulders.</p>
<p>"From the neck the back arches a little as far as the loins,
whence it goes off at a flat slope to the hindmost parts, where
no tail is visible A tail, notwithstanding is found, after
separating the hairs, five tenths of an inch in length, naked,
except for a few short hair near its end. This curious tail
seemed to hold a much bolder proportion in the young than in the
full-grown animal.</p>
<p>"The fore legs are very strong and muscular: their length, to
the sole of the paw, is 5 inches, and the distance between them
is 5 inches. The paws are fleshy, round and large being 2 inches
in diameter. Their claws are 5 in number. The 3 middle claws are
strong; the thumb and little finger claws are also strong, but
shorter than the others. The fleshy root of the thumb-claw, is
smaller and more flexible than the others. The sole of the paw is
hard, and the upper part covered with the common hair, down to
the roots of the claws which it overhangs. The hind legs are less
strong and muscular than the fore; their length, to the sole, is
five inches and a half. The hind paw is longer than the fore, but
not less fleshy; its length is nearly three inches, its breadth
two inches and a half. The claws are four in number: the three
inner ones are less strong, but about two-tenths of an inch
longer than the longest of the fore claws; and there is a fleshy
spur in the place of a thumb-claw. The whole paw has a curve,
which throws its fore part rather inward.</p>
<p>"In size the two sexes are nearly the same, but the female
rather the heaviest.</p>
<p>"This animal has not any claim to swiftness of foot, as most
men could run it down. Its pace is hobbling something like the
gait of a bear. In disposition it is mild and gentle; but it
bites hard and is furious when provoked. Mr. Bass never heard its
voice but once; it was a low cry, which could not be heard at a
distance of more than 30 or 40 yards. He chased one, and with his
hands under its belly lifted it off the ground without hurting
it, and laid it on its back along his arm. It made no noise, nor
any effort to escape. Mr. Bass carried the beast upwards of a
mile, shifting him from arm to arm, sometimes laying him on his
shoulder, which he took in good part; till being obliged to
secure his legs while he went into the brush to cut a specimen of
a new wood, the creature's anger arose with the pinching of the
twine; he whizzed with all his might, kicked most furiously, and
snapped off a piece from the elbow of Mr. Bass's jacket with his
grass cutting teeth; and the creature, when again taken up,
remained implacable all the way to the boat, only ceasing to kick
when he was exhausted."</p>
<p>Besides Furneaux's Islands, the Wom-bat inhabits the mountains
and several islands to the Westward of Port Jackson. In all these
places its habitation is under ground, being admirably formed for
burrowing, but what depth it descends does not seem to be
ascertained. According to the account given of it by the natives,
the wom-bat of the mountains is never seen during the day, but
lives retired in his hole, feeding only in the night; but that of
the islands is seen to feed in all parts of the day. The stomachs
of such as Mr. Bass examined were distended with the coarse wiry
grass, and he had seen the animal scratching among the the dry
ricks of seaweed thrown up upon the shores, hat could never
discover what it was in search of.</p>
<p>Cape Barren Island, besides the kangaroo and wom-bat, is
inhabited by the porcupine ant-eater; a rat with webbed feet;
parroquets, and small birds unknown at Port Jackson, some few of
which were of beautiful plumage. Black snakes with the venimous
fangs were numerous upon the edges of the brush. The rocks toward
the sea were covered with fur-seals.</p>
<p>Quitting Furneaux's Islands, the Norfolk proceeded toward the
North coast of Van Diemen's land; and on the 1st of November
anchored at the largest of the Swan Isles, two small islands so
called by Lieut. Flinders, when here in the Francis; as an
European belonging to the Sydney Cove assured him that he had met
great numbers of swans on them.</p>
<p>The isle at which the sloop anchored, like Preservation
Island, was low, sandy, and barren, but differed in the
composition of its rocks, or that substance Which formed the
basis of its support. This had not any affinity to granite. It
was of various colours, but generally either of a light brown or
grey. It seemed to be lamellated, but the lamellae were placed
vertically, often radiated with a diameter of four or five feet,
and sometimes placed parallel. On breaking the stone, the
fracture was vitreous, or like that of glass, and it scintillated
on steel being applied. Rust of iron was visible in several
parts, the stone breaking in those parts into plates; but where
none of those markings were seen, it broke with great difficulty.
On the first view, the stone looked like clay; but as it produced
fire with steel, there must have been a large portion of flint in
it. It appeared to contain iron in rather a large quantity.</p>
<p>Not a single swan was found upon the island, notwithstanding
the information given by the European; but several geese were
breeding there, and the sooty petrel possessed the grassy
parts.</p>
<p>On the first of November, early in the morning, they left the
Swan Isles, steering to the Westward along shore.</p>
<p>A column of smoke which arose some distance inland, was the
only proof of its being inhabited.</p>
<p>At noon the latitude was 40&deg; 44' 08", the peak of Cape
Barren Island then in sight. At this time they were two miles to
the Westward of the small island, which was low and rocky, lying
about 2 miles and a half of a sharp, sandy point, with which it
was nearly joined by some lumps of rock that almost closed up the
passage.</p>
<p>The aspect of the low land here was less pleasing, the
mountains approaching nearer the sea, and the country appearing
to be more stocked with wood. The coast seemed inclined to a
southerly direction, and the Western extremity, which bore S.W.
by W. appeared irregular and very much broken.</p>
<p>At five in the afternoon they anchored two miles and a half to
the Westward of the small island, setting the vessel to the
Northward.</p>
<p>The next morning they weighed at nine, with an easterly wind,
and steered towards a small break that presented itself in the
bottom of an extensive bay, lying between the two extremes then
in view. The break was not sufficiently distinct to have
justified in itself alone a reasonable supposition of an inlet,
but that it was corroborated by the direction of the ebb tide,
which, while the sloop was at anchor, was observed to come from
the S.S.W. or directly out of the bay, running at the rate of two
miles and a half per hour. By noon, they ascertained that there
was not any inlet, they bore away to the Westward along the
land.</p>
<p>Their distance from the shore did not exceed a mile and a
half. The back country consisted of high mountains, whose
parallel edges were one above another lo a considerable distance
inland. The land in front appeared both woody, bushy, and
sandy.</p>
<p>In the afternoon they ran between a sandy point, with shoal
water off it, and two islands. One of these, named Waterhouse
Isle, is between two and three miles in length, high, but level,
and covered with large wood. The other is small, low, rocky, and
nearly bare. The coast now trended to the S.S.W. the land sloping
up from the sea a moderate height, with more open than wooded
ground, and little brush-wood; but the soil sandy, and the grass
thin.</p>
<p>Proceeding, the shore no longer retained a regular line of
direction, but fell back into sandy bights. Hauling off for the
night to the Westward of a small rocky barren island, about four
miles from the land, at six o'clock the next morning they came in
with it again, and began their course along the shore, to the
S.S.W. in an irregular manner.</p>
<p>At eleven they passed within a mile of a grassy cape, which is
the extremity of a ridge, that rising up by a gentle ascent,
retreats and joins some lofty mountains. A small rocky island lay
too miles from it to the W.S.W. at noon the latitude was 40&deg;
55' 25", and the longitude 147&deg; 16' 30".</p>
<p>Early in the afternoon a gap in the land situated at the back
of a deep narrow bight, attracted attention, this they bore away
to examine; and, after running three miles, they found they had
shut in the line of the coast on each side, and were impelled
forward by a strong inset of tide. Continuing their course for
the gap, some back points within the entrance soon became
distinguishable, and the rapidity of the flood tide was observed
to increase on nearing the shore. When the sloop was on the point
of entering the harbour, the water shoaled suddenly, and she
struck the ground and lay fast; but the strong flood in a few
minutes dragged her over into deep water, and shot her into the
entrance with great velocity.</p>
<p>Having advanced within the entrance, the harbour began to
expand itself in a kind of large basin. Its shores were broken
into points, between some of which the great strength of the
flood tide led them to expect it would branch off into arms. The
land lying immediately upon its borders was low, but not flat;
and those points near which the sloop passed were clothed with an
unusual degree of verdure. The sun being down, the vessel was
anchored for the night, and the next day they proceeded with
their researches.</p>
<p>This harbour, or inlet, which was named by the Governor, Port
Dalrymple, in compliment to Alexander Dalrymple, Esq. takes its
course from the S. E. between two chains of rounded mountains,
stretching inland from the sea with an almost imperceptible
increase of elevation; and, seemed to unite, at the distance of
between thirty and forty miles, in a body of rugged mountains
more lofty than themselves. These two chains in their relative
positions formed an acute angle, being at their greatest distance
asunder, as measured along the sea coast, only sixteen miles.</p>
<p>As these gentlemen were limited in point of time (twelve weeks
having been deemed by the Governor sufficient for the execution
of this service), the fear of losing a wind favourable for the
prosecution of the principal object of the voyage, that of
sailing through the strait, deterred them from trying to reach
the head of the river.</p>
<p>The quality of the ground, was far superior to that of the
borders of any of the salt water inlets of New South Wales,
Western Port excepted. The vegetable mould was, however, found to
be of no great depth, and was sometimes mixed with small
quantities of sand.</p>
<p>The best of the soil was found upon the sides of sloping
hills, and in the broad vallies between them. Some parts that
were low and level had a wet surface, bounded by small tracts of
flowering shrubs and plants, that absolutely perfumed the air.
These retained in general the appearance of those in New South
Wales, while they were in reality very different. The two
countries present a perfect similarity in this, that the more
barren spots are the most gaily adorned.</p>
<p>Except in these places the grass does not grow in tufts, but
covers the land equally with a short herbage, better adapted, for
small than of large cattle. The food for the latter grows in the
bottoms of the vallies and on the damp flats. A large proportion
of the soil promised a fair return to the labours of the
cultivator, but the greater part would perhaps be more
advantageously employed, if left for pasturage, than if thrown
into cultivation.</p>
<p>Water was found in runs more than in ponds, not very
plentiful, but far from being scarce.</p>
<p>The west side of the river possessed the largest quantity of
the best ground, because the mountains on that side are at a
greater distance than those on the east. The country lying near
the west arm is rather flat, and might be converted to many
useful purposes.</p>
<p>The best land seemed to be that fine hilly country at the back
of an island named Middle-Island; but access to it is not easy on
account of a large shoal extending along its front, which is dry
at low water, as far out as the island itself. The shape of the
land is very pleasingly variegated with hill and valley; the soil
is in general a rich black mould, shallow, and even sometimes a
little stoney on the hills, but in the vallies abundant depth and
richness. A close coat of grass of a uniform thickness
overspreads it every where. It appears to be watered only by
swampy ponds, which in many places are at some distance from each
other.</p>
<p>The heavy timber is chiefly of the various species of the gum
tree; of which two are different from any that have been yet seen
in this country. But, from the few trees that have been felled,
it was thought to be more sound at heart than they are usually.
The she oaks were more inclined to spread than grow tall. The
tree producing the yellow gum is of a very diminutive size; but,
unlike that of Cape Barren Island, it bears a reed correspondent
to itself. These were going into flower, and their length was
only from nine inches to two feet.</p>
<p>Grey kangaroos of a large size, abounded in the open forest;
and the brushes with the smaller black kind.</p>
<p>The gloomy plumage of the parrots forms a contrast with the
lustre of those near the settlement. The cry of the bell-bird
seems to be unknown here. Aquatic birds, web-footed and waders,
frequent the arms and covers of the river; but the black swans
alone are remarkable in point of number. Mr. Bass once saw three
hundred swimming within the space of a quarter of a mile; and
heard the "dying song" so celebrated by the poets. Not more than
two thirds of any of the flocks which they fell in with could
fly, the rest could do no more than flap along upon the surface
of the water, being either moulting, or not yet come to their
full feather and growth, which they require two years to attain.
They swam and flapped alternately, and went surprisingly fast It
was some times a long chase, but the boat generally tired them
out. When in danger, speed makes no part of their escape, they
immerse their bodies so far, that the water makes a passage
between their neck and back, and in this position they would
avoid a heavy load of shot. They seemed endowed with much
sagacity; in chase they soon learned the weakest point of their
pursuers, and, instead of swimming directly from them, as they
did at first, always endeavoured in the most artful manner to
gain the wind.</p>
<p>The swan is said to feed upon fish, frogs, and water-slugs;
but in the gizards of many that at different times and in
different places were examined, nothing appeared but small water
plants, and some little sand. Of their affection for their young
he had seen some sacrifices; but of their fierceness, when
opposed to man, or their great strength, he had seen no
instance.</p>
<p>Among other reptiles were found the snake with venemous fangs,
and some brown guanoes.</p>
<p>This country is but thinly inhabited, and the extreme shyness
of the natives prevented any kind of communication whatever. They
never even got sight of them but once, and that at a great
distance. They had made fires abreast where the sloop was at
anchor; but as soon as the boat approached the shore they ran off
to the woods. Their huts, of which seven or eight were frequently
found together like a little encampment, were constructed of bark
torn in long stripes, after being divided transversely at the
bottom, in such breadths as their strength would be able to
disengage them from the wood. It is then broken into lengths, and
placed, sloping-wise, against the elbowing part of some dead
branch that had fallen off limbs of the gum tree; and a little
grass is sometimes thrown over the top. But, they have not
ingenuity enough to place the slips of bark in such a manner as
to preclude the rain.</p>
<p>The only utensil observed lying near their huts was a kind of
basket made of long grass. The two ends of a large bunch of this
grass are tied to the two ends of a smaller bunch; the large one
is then spread out to form the basket, while the smaller answers
the purpose of a handle. Their use is to bring shell fish from
the mud banks where they are collected. The large heaps of muscle
shells found near each hut proved the mud banks to be a principal
source of food. On an examination of their fire-places nothing,
except a few bones of the opossum, or squirrel and here and there
those of a small kangaroo were discovered.</p>
<p>The mode of taking the opossum seemed to be similar to that
practised in New South Wales, except that they use a rope in
ascending the tree; for at the foot of a notched tree, about
eight feet of a two-inch rope made of grass was found with a knot
in it, near which it appeared broken.</p>
<p>To the canoe they were strangers as one was never met with, or
was any tree ever observed to be barked in the manner requisite
for this purpose; though birds bred upon little islands to which
access might be had in the smallest canoe. The roughness of the
notches left by the stone hatchet upon the bark of the trees bore
no favourable testimony to its excellence. They were rather the
marks of a rough than of a sharp edged tool, and seemed more
beaten than cut, which was not the case with the marks left by
the stone hatchet of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The range of the thermometer, taken in various parts of the
port, was at night from 49&deg; to 52&deg;, and at noon from
58&deg; to 64&deg;.</p>
<p>On the 20th of November they left Port Dalrymple with a light
breeze at N.E. and proceeded slowly to the westward. At day-light
the following morning, the wind shifted to the W. by N. which
drove them back to Furneaux's islands, where, the gale continuing
at west, they were kept until the 3d of December, when they were
enabled to proceed to the westward. The land here trended to the
W.N.W. as far as visible through the haze, which suffered them
only to distinguish that it was high and uneven. At noon the
latitude was 40&deg; 58', and the longitude 140&deg; 44'. Their
progress was slow; but what was seen of it appeared high and
mountainous, the mountains forming into low peaks, to which a few
large shapeless knobs added a great Angularity. On the haze
clearing away, and the shore being distinctly seen, it appeared
rocky, but wooded nearly down to the water's edge. Here and there
were seen spaces of open ground, some of which sloped toward the
sea, and had a few large trees growing on them. A peaked
mountain, some miles inland, might have been thought, from its
shape and height, to have been once a volcano.</p>
<p>On the 6th, towards noon, soon after passing Circular Head,
the outermost land in sight stretched so far on the northward,
that the course to clear it was N.N.W. It formed like two
hummocks.</p>
<p>Nothing new presented itself on the following day, but some
small flights of sooty petrels.</p>
<p>On the 8th, being threatened with a gale, they came to anchor
under the land, off a small beach on its N.E. part, where the S.
W. wind could not molest the vessel. Here Mr. Bass landed to
examine the country, but the tall sturdy brush-wood grew so close
that their dogs could hardly make their way through it. Several
patches seemed to have been burnt many months ago, but the small
brush and creeping vines only were destroyed; the closeness of
the blackened saplings was still irresistible. A few starved gum
trees erected their heads above the brush-wood, and the whole
wore an aspect of poverty. The rocks were composed of quartz,
probably a species of granite, but unlike what formed Furneaux's
Islands.</p>
<p>Leaving this place on the 9th, they steered for the outermost
land in sight, and was distant three or four leagues. After
rounding the end of the land under which they had anchored, its
shores fell back, and discovered to them it was an island of from
fifteen to twenty miles miles in circuit, and situated between
four and five from the main. It was with the greatest
astonishment that they recollected the fire places and sea shells
which they had the preceding evening seen upon the island. This
island had bestowed on it the name of the Three Hummock
Island.</p>
<p>During the early part of the morning, some millions of sooty
petrels passed the vessel on their way to the westward.</p>
<p>Having passed within a mile of a pointed part of the main,
which in height and vegetation resembled Three Hummock Island,
towards noon they came up with some land, which proved to be a
small island, high and steep; and a long swell, which had just
before made its first appearance, broke violently upon it, making
a furious surf on all sides. Its summit was whitened over with
birds. With difficulty a landing was effected, and, after an
encounter with some seals that stood above, they reached the top.
The birds found were albatrosses. The spread of their wings was
from seven to nine feet; and the appearance of their visitors did
not occasion much disturbance among them, even when they
approached close to them. The females sat upon their nests, this
being the season of their breeding, the nests were not more than
a foot and a half apart, built of muddy earth, bound with grass,
raised about four inches from the ground. One young bird was in
each nest: of the size of a small pullet, covered with a
beautifully white down; at some distance resembling a ball of
cotton. Some nests held an addled egg of a dirty white colour,
and equal in size to that of a goose. The nests were so near each
other, and the birds so conscious of the strength of their sharp
bills, that in going through them they were obliged to make use
of seal clubs, to procure a passage. Even the young ones spouted
plentiful mouthfuls of a kind of oil on them not altogether
unpleasant.</p>
<p>This island, which obtained the name of Albatross Island, was
a mass of stone, without any other vegetation than a few tufts of
coarse grass. Besides albatrosses, it afforded shelter to a few
hair seals, and the large gull. The latitude was 40&deg; 24', the
longitude 145&deg; 02'.</p>
<p>Several other islands were seen to the Southward, and the
coast of the main seemed trended in the same direction. A deep
bight lay at the back of these islands, with points and openings
visible in its most distant part. They passed near enough to
determine that they were high, steep, and difficult of access.
Their tops and sloping parts were grown over with either coarse
grass or short brush; but not any trees appeared. The largest
might be seven or eight miles in circuit, the smaller were mere
masses of rock, and the whole in number about twelve, obtained
the name of Hunter's Isles.</p>
<p>A fresh gale at E.N.E. and a heavy swell from the S.W. drove
the vessel fast to the Southward and Westward; and on the 11th,
the gale having moderated, they stretched in for the land, a
large extent of which was indistinctly visible through a light
haze that hung about the horizon. At noon the latitude was
41&deg; 13', and the longitude 148&deg; 58'. With a fresh breeze
at N.N.E. they bore away along the shore, which trends to the
S.E. by E. and was distant three or four miles.</p>
<p>On the following morning the wind rounded to the Northward,
and they continued along the shore. Early in the forenoon they
passed a singular point, with a number of lumps of rock lying
some two or three miles off it to the S.W. It resembled an
artificial pier, or mole, with warehouses upon it, and a
light-house on the end next the water. Large masses of detached
oblong rocks gave the appearance of warehouses, and a remarkable
long one standing upon its end, that of the light-house.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Bass, nor his fellow voyager, Lieut. Flinders,
hesitated to think they had passed through the strait, and from
the Pacific, had entered the southern Indian ocean; for what
within the extent of a vast sea could give birth to the monstrous
swell now rolling in before their eyes? and the coast was
evidently trending towards the S.W. cape.</p>
<p>It was worthy of remark, that the Northern shore of the strait
from Wilson's Promontory to Western Port resembled the bluff bold
shore of an open sea, with a swell rolling in, and a large surf
breaking upon it; while the Southern shore, or what is the coast
of Van Diemen's land, appeared like the inner shore of a cluster
of islands, whose outer parts break off the great weight of the
sea.</p>
<p>On the 11th in the afternoon a piece of land like an island
was discovered standing out of the line of the coast, but was
found joined to the main by a sandy beach. The shore behind it
was rugged and craggy, and the land was both sterile and stoney.
As night came on the vessel stood off to the Westward, and at
day-light the next morning came in with the land near the same
spot, and ran along the shore at N.W.</p>
<p>About noon the coast rose into chains of high mountains, in
the same line as the coast, in latitude 43&deg; 07', the
longitude 145&deg; 42'. Some smoke rising astern the vessel was
the first circumstance which afforded proof of inhabitants being
on this West coast.</p>
<p>On the 13th they found the vessel had been carried in the
night to leeward of a break in tin land, they had seen the
preceding evening, which appeared like the entrance of an
harbour. The north point of which was named Point St.
Vincent.</p>
<p>In the evening they passed the S. W. cape of Van Diemen's
land, hitherto known as that of New Holland. It is a narrow piece
of land, with two hummocks. Passing the cape, they went between
De Witt's Isles and the main, and at sunset they were only about
a mile and a half from the South Cape.</p>
<p>The South West and South Capes lie nearly East and West of
each other, distant nearly fifteen leagues. The coast between
forms the Southern boundary of Van Diemen's land.</p>
<p>The extremity of Van Diemen's land presents a rugged front to
the icy regions of the south pole; and seems to have extended
further South than at present. It has numerous peaks, ridges,
gaps and fissures, that seemed to disdain the smallest uniformity
of figure. Beneath this confusion is observed an equal
regularity. Lofty ridges of mountain, bounded by large cliffs,
project for miles into the sea, at nearly equal distances from
each other, with a breadth from one to two miles. The bays
between them are backed by sandy beaches. These buttresses appear
to be the southern extremities of the mountains of Van Diemen's
land.</p>
<p>De Witt's Isles are twelve in number, and of various sizes.
The two largest are three or four miles in circuit. Their sides
steep; but their height is inferior to that of the main. The
largest is the lowest. The smaller isles are little more than
lumps of rock, of which that called by Captain Cook the Mew Stone
is the southernmost. Their appearance, like that of the main,
bespeaks sterility; but, superior to the greater part of it, they
produce a covering of brush; and upon the sides are a few stinted
gum trees.</p>
<p>A smoke that arose at the back of one of the bights shewed the
main to be inhabited.</p>
<p>The South Cape is easily to be distinguished from any other
projection in its neighbourhood. Besides being the southernmost,
it is a promontory making like a foreland, sloping gradually as
it runs towards the sea, where it ends in a perpendicular
cliff.</p>
<p>About sunset the fresh N.W. wind died away suddenly; and a
squall from the Westward, of thunder, lightning, and heavy rain,
soon carried them round the South cape, and, by dark, brought
them off Storm-Bay, where they hauled to the wind with the
sloop's head up the bay, meaning, in the morning, to proceed by
this bay to the Derwent river.</p>
<p>The night was squally, and by day light next morning (the
14th), it was found that the vessel had drifted across the mouth
of Storm-Bay, or Storm-Bay-Passage. Tasman's-head, its Eastern
point, bore N.E. distant three miles. Being too far to leeward to
fetch up, and the gale continuing, they bore away round
Tasman-head.</p>
<p>Nothing remarkable was observed about Tasman's-head, except
two small islands lying off it, at the distance of half or three
quarters of a mile; and close to them were the two rocks named
the Friars. The vegetation on the innermost of the two small
islands had been burnt in a manner similar to that on De Witt's
isles.</p>
<p>Passing Fluted Cape, a fine piece of Basaltes, and Penguin
island, they brought up under Cape Frederick Henry, the north
point of Adventure Bay; and, the wind blowing strong off it, and
the sloop being light and leewardly, they bore round Cape
Frederick Henry, hauling on the north of it into the bay, and
thus go into the Derwent river: but, finding themselves likely to
lose ground by tacking, they stood into Henshaw's bay, and were
greatly surprised to find that, instead of its being a mere
shallow bight, as laid down in Hayes's chart, it extended many
miles to the northward. The whole now bears the name of Frederick
Henry Bay. In this very extensive bay they remained a week,
traversing and measuring various parts of its shores.</p>
<p>The surrounding country was found miserable, presenting little
fit even for pasturage, and none good enough for cultivation,
except near a shallow lagoon on the west side, on the borders of
which were seven or eight hundred acres of low ground, of a black
mould. Near the best part, was a large fresh water swamp,
overgrown with reeds and bulrushes.</p>
<p>In the evening of the 21st they entered the mouth of the
Derwent.</p>
<p>In passing between two islands, the heads of the sea-weed,
named from its size (Gigantic), were shewing themselves above the
surface in six or eight fathoms water.</p>
<p>After a very slow course of about twenty-six miles to N. W.
the Derwent river falls into Frederick Henry Bay, at which place
its breadth is two miles and a quarter, and ten fathoms deep.
Several hundred yards above the mouth, it is joined by the
Storm-Bay-Passage, which union makes an island of that land which
is Adventure Bay. This island, the Derwent river, and the
Storm-Bay-Passage, were the discovery of Mr. Hayes, of which he
made only an incorrect chart.</p>
<p>That dull river the Derwent, not being affected by the tides,
its navigation is tedious, particularly with a foul wind. It
winds through a country of hills and mountains. The hills on the
East rise directly from the banks; but the mountains to the
Westward are at the distance of some miles from the water side
and have hilly land before them. The hills are thinly set with
light timber principally short oaks; but are covered with thick
grass, free from brush-wood or patches of shrubs. The soil is a
black mould, deep in the vallies, very shallow, and occasionally
a mixture of sand and small stones. As the hills descend with
gentle slopes, the vallies between are extensive and flat.</p>
<p>Mr. Bass ascended a mountain in the West three miles from the
water, and so conspicuous as to be seen from every part of the
Derwent, and was surprized to find it abound with tall gum-tree
timber remarkably straight.</p>
<p>The shore on the East side of the river, is covered with a
good soil, lightly wooded; on the West the country rises suddenly
into stoney hills so that it is not in general so good as in
other places; a few patches were observed of eighty or one
hundred acres of excellent land.</p>
<p>The strata of cliffs were broken and lay sloping in different
directions; several pieces of petrified wood, and lumps of stone
were inveloped, or rather stuck into the matter of the rock,
which, although in colour much like a yellow tinged clay, yet had
the usual rough porous surface peculiar to such substances; here
as in other places, it was hard, but did not scintillate with
steel, and was divided by lines of a still harder iron-tinged
stone, into squares and parallelograms of various sizes. From one
of these intersecting lines, Mr. Bass took a small lump of this
ferruginous stone, that seemed to have bubbled up, and to have
hardened in the form of an ill-shaped bunch of small grapes. Some
of the neighbouring cliffs, for several yards were formed into
basaltic columns.</p>
<p>In crossing one of the heads between two bays Mr. B. met with
a deep hole in the ground Which seemed to have been caused by the
falling in of the earth. It extended about twenty-two yards by
seventeen; its depth twenty. And the sides were both rather
smooth and perpendicular. A little surf that washed up within it
proved a communication with the river, by a narrow subterraneous
passage of from ten to sixteen feet in height, and according to
the distance of the hole from the edge of the cliff, about thirty
five yards in length; proceeding on the West side from Point
William to Shoal Point, the land is too stony on the hills for
cultivation, but proper for pasturage. The rallies are certainly
adapted to grain.</p>
<p>The land round Prince of Wales Cove is level, and often
clayey. About three hundred acres of open ground, called King
George's Plains, seem well calculated for the purpose of rearing
grape vines.</p>
<p>The land at the head of Risdon creek, on the East side, seems
preferable to any other on the banks of the Derwent.</p>
<p>Herdsman's Cove, above Risdon Creek, has a large tract of good
land lying at its head. The country, which is thin of timber,
rounds into grassy hills of gentle ascent. The soil consists of
more brown earth than black mould; on the sides and tops of the
hills, it is stoney. A chain of ponds intersecting the hills
afford a continual stream of fresh water to the head of the
Cove.</p>
<p>Not supposing the sloop could proceed above Herdsman's Cove,
they went up the river in her boat, under the idea that one tide
would enable them to reach its source; but they were mistaken.
When the returning tide met them, the water had become fresh; the
stream was two hundred and thirty yards in breadth, and in depth
three fathoms. It was wedged in between high grassy hills that
descended to the river.</p>
<p>In their excursion a human voice reached them from the hills;
when they landed, carrying one of several swans they had shot.
Having nearly reached the summit, two females suddenly appeared
some distance before them, each snatched up a basket, and ran
off. A man then appeared, and suffered them to approach him
without any signs of fear. He accepted the swan with joy and
seemed to esteem it of value.</p>
<p>He was unintelligible to them, even as they were to him, they
addressed him in several of the dialects of New South Wales, and
some few of the most common words of the South Sea Islands. With
some difficulty they made him understand they wished to see his
habitation. He pointed over the hills, and proceeded onwards;
often stopping under pretence of having lost the tract; which
made them suspect his aim was, to amuse and tire them. Judging,
therefore, that in persisting to follow him they must lose the
remaining part of the flood tide, they parted from him in great
friendship.</p>
<p>This man was short, slight, and of a middle age, with a
countenance more expressive of intelligence than of that ferocity
or stupidity which generally characterized the other natives; his
features were less negro-like, than theirs; and on the top of his
head were plaisteres of red earth. His hair was either naturally
short and close, or had been rendered so by burning, and,
although short and stiffly curled, they did not think it woolly.*
He was armed with two ill made spears of solid wood.</p>
<p><small>[* Mr. Raven, returning to England in the Buffalo, put
into Adventure Bay, where this man was seen, and cut off some
wool from the head of a native there.]</small></p>
<p>No part of the dress of Mr. Bass or Lieut. Flinders attracted
his attention, except the red silk handkerchiefs round their
necks; and their fire arms were to him, objects neither of
curiosity or fear.</p>
<p>This was the first man they spoke with in Van Diemen's land,
and his open deportment led them to form a favourable opinion of
the disposition of its inhabitants, and conjecture if the country
was peopled in the usual numbers, he would not have been the only
one they would have met.</p>
<p>They found many huts on the shores of the river, of the same
bad construction as those of Port Dalrymple, but with fewer
muscle-shells lying near them. The natives of this place, draw
the principal part of their food from the woods; the bones of
small animals were numerous round their deserted fire-places; and
the two spears Which they saw in the hands of the man were
similar to those used for hunting in other parts; and many trees
were observed to be notched for the purpose of climbing.</p>
<p>No canoes were ever seen, nor any tree so barked as to answer
that purpose. And yet all the islands in Frederick-Henry Bay had
evidently been visited.</p>
<p>The feathered tribes were similar to those of Port Dalrymple.
The flocks of black swans even exceeded those they had before met
with.</p>
<p>The most formidable among the reptiles was the black snake
with venemous fangs, and so much in colour resembling a burnt
stick, that a close inspection could only detect the
difference.</p>
<p>Mr. Bass once, with his eyes cautiously directed towards the
ground, stepped over one which was lying asleep among some black
sticks, and would have passed on without observing it, had not
its rustling and loud hiss attracted his attention.</p>
<p>He resolved to take it alive, and try the effect of its bite
on a hawk at that time in the sloop. In the contest, he turned
round and bit himself severely; in a few minutes after which he
was overcome. His exertions, however, were still vigorous, and
Mr. Bass expected, as he began to recover himself, they would
increase; but in less than ten minutes he died. Having never
before known a snake of this size to be killed by a few very
slight blows with a stick so rotten as scarcely to bear the
weight of its own blow, he was at a loss to conceive how death so
sudden succeeded so much vigour in an animal so tenacious of
life, When, three hours afterwards, the skin was stripped off,
the flesh for some distance round the marks of his teeth, was
found inflamed and discoloured; thus this reptile proved a
suicide.</p>
<p>Every particular relative to the Derwent river being stated,
and all the information of Van Diemen's land related, it may be
esteemed highly proper, to point out the manner in which this
country and new South Wales appear to differ in their most
essential quality, that of their soil.</p>
<p>In adjusting the comparative fertility of the soils of Van
Diemen's land, and New South Wales, their contrasted dispositions
are more prominent than any inequality in their quantity. They
are poor countries; but, as far as the eye of discovery has yet
penetrated in either, the cultivable soil of the latter is found
lying in a few distinct patches of varying quality; while the
soil of the former, being more equally spread, those spots of
abundant richness, or large wilds of sterility, are less
frequently seen.</p>
<p>Although Van Diemen's land seems to possess few or none of
those depths of soil which the happiest spots of New South Wales
are blessed with, it seldom excludes the hopes of its traveller
with those tracts which disarm industry.</p>
<p>In point of productive soil Mr. Bass gives the advantage to
Van Diemen's land.</p>
<p>Two rivers only, Port Dalrymple and the Derwent, are known to
descend from Van Diemen's land; and by Point St. Vincent possibly
there may be a third. But two or three rivers bear but a scanty
proportion to the island.</p>
<p>On the 3d of January they quitted the River Derwent, and
proceeded to the Northward, coasting the East side of
Frederick-Henry Bay. The figure of the shore, between what is now
called Basaltes and Cape Pillar, exhibited one of those great
works of nature which seldom fails exciting surprise: it was all
basaltic. The cape is a vast high wedge, which projects into the
sea, surmounted by lofty columns.</p>
<p>After passing Cape Pillar, some islands became visible to the
northward; but they did not reach them, as the wind failed. On
the next day, they arrived within five miles of one which in its
general appearance, bore some resemblance to Furneaux's
Islands.</p>
<p>On the 7th they saw Cape Barren Island. They did not pass
through the channel, or passage, which divides Furneaux's
Islands, but discovered why Captain Furneaux named the place the
Bay of Shoals.</p>
<p>Early on the 8th they neared the islands lying off the
Patriarchs; three in number; the largest of which was high,
rocky, and barren, with a basis of granite, which, like that of
Preservation Island, laid scattered about in large detached
blocks. Landing upon the outermost, Mr. Bass found it well
inhabited. The various tribes had divided into districts. One
part was white with gannets, breeding in nests of earth and dried
grass. Petrels and penguins had their underground habitations in
those parts of the island which had the most grass. The rocks of
the shore, and blocks of granite, were occupied by the pied
offensive shag and common gull; geese, red-bills and quails,
lived in common, and the rest was appropriated to the seals, Mr.
Bass observed with surprise, that though the principal herd made
off as usual on the first approach, yet the males, who possessed
a rock to themselves, where they sat with their wives and
progeny, on his drawing near them, hobbled up with a menacing
roar, and fairly commenced the attack, while the wives seemed to
rest their security upon the superior courage of the males; for,
instead of retreating into the water with consternation, they
only raised themselves upon their fore fins, ready to go, keeping
their eye on him.</p>
<p>The seal is reckoned stupid; but Mr. B. noticed many signs of
sagacity in them; and was of opinion that, a seal might be
trained to be a fisher for man, even as a hawk is his fowler.</p>
<p>Having collected what stock was necessary, they stood to the
Northward, and on the 12th reached Port Jackson.</p>
<p>On an account of this voyage being delivered to the governor,
he named the principal discovery, Bass Strait, as a tribute due
to the correctness of that judgment which led to the supposition
that the south-westerly winds which rolled in on the Western
shores, could proceed only from their being exposed to the
Southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>The principal advantage likely to arise to the settlement from
this discovery was, the expediting of the passage from the Cape
of Good Hope to Port Jackson. But there is a greater advantage to
be gained by making a passage through the strait. The major part
of the ships that have arrived at Port Jackson have met with N.E.
winds on opening the sea round the South Cape and Cape Pillar,
and have been so retarded by them, that a fourteen days' passage
to the port is reckoned to be a fair one, although the difference
of latitude is but ten degrees. If by going through Bass Strait,
the N.E. winds can be avoided, which would be the case, a week or
more would be gained by it.</p>
<p>This strait presents another advantage. From the prevalence of
the N.E. and easterly winds off the South Cape, many suppose that
a passage may be made from thence to the Westward, either to the
Cape of Hood Hope, or India; but the fear of the great unknown
bight between the South Cape and the S.W. Cape of Leeuwin's land,
lying in about 35&deg; South and 113&deg; East has hitherto
prevented the trial. The strait removes a part of this danger, by
presenting a place of retreat, if wanted; and should the wind
come at S.W. no ship need fear making a good stretch to the
W.N.W. There is besides King George the Third's Sound, discovered
by Capt. Vancouver, in latitude of 35&deg; 03' South, and
longitude 108&deg; 12' East.</p>
<p>Thus prosperously did the voyage of Mr. Bass, and Lieut.
Flinders, answer every purpose the Governor and these gentlemen
fondly expected; and to future ages, most probably, will be left
the proper elevation of these navigators' names, in the Temple of
Fame; for though the advantages may now be seen, they will
undoubtedly hereafter be beneficially felt.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<p align="center">[Flinders explores Glass-House Bay]</p>
<p><small>FROM</small> the interesting voyage of discovery,
performed by Mr. Bass and Lieut Flinders, we must return to the
proceedings at the colony.</p>
<p>In the night of the 24th of January, 1799, the commissary's
house was robbed to a considerable amount, as they effected an
entrance into the store-room.</p>
<p>The governor this month visited Paramatta, and had the
misfortune to find the pasture so universally burnt up, that the
cattle were in want of grass; and, as the drought continued, the
maize, it was feared, would fall very short of the quantity
expected; his Excellency, therefore, ordered a return to be made
of the stock of grain, that he might see on what he had to
depend.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the Diana, information was brought from
Norfolk Island, that the produce of wheat had been greater this
harvest than it had ever been before; but the maize, for want of
rain, was by no means so prolific; and the extravagant price paid
for wages, had obliged the settlers to advance the price of wheat
to fifteen shillings a bushel.</p>
<p>The number of causes for the recovery of debts, which came
before the magistrates, rendered their business very troublesome;
and, as the inventive <small>GENIUS</small> of the convicts,
afforded them nearly constant employ as justices of the peace: an
order was issued, making known, that pleas of debt must be
decided by the court of civil jurisdiction.</p>
<p>At the close of January, the criminal court resumed its
operations; when one man was found guilty of house-breaking, a
second for forgery, and a third for having shot a native at
Botany Bay. The man convicted of forgery was recommended to
mercy, and the murderer was to receive corporal punishment, at
the execution of which, many of the natives attended, and beheld
it with perfect indifference.</p>
<p>The man convicted of house-breaking, suffered on the 8th of
February, and his exhortations, previous to execution, had scarce
ceased, when the court was assembled for the trial of another man
for the same offence, of which he was convicted. This man, Samuel
Wright, had before been convicted but received a pardon. On the
morning, of the day now appointed for his execution; he cut his
throat, but in so slight a way, as evidently shewed he wished
only to delay the fulfillment of his sentence, that he might
obtain an opportunity of making an escape.</p>
<p>A few, belonging to a gang of thieves, which had for some time
infested the settlements, and plundered to a very large amount,
were brought to trial before this court, but not being capitally
convicted, some were transported to Norfolk Island, and others
flogged. The executions of those sentences, which the offended
laws of every nation inflicts, are in general esteemed useful as
warnings to others, but, that these should particularly lose that
effect in New South Wales, should by no means excite astonishment
as the major part of the inhabitants, had been too conversant
with the nature of crimes and punishments, for any example to
affect them; particularly while a ready market almost continually
offered for the sale of any stolen articles, which must be the
case while the sailors of any ships were suffered to come on
shore, or any persons permitted to go on board the ships.</p>
<p>About twelve o'clock on the night of the 11th, the goal at
Sydney was burnt down; there were above 20 prisoners all ironed,
in at the time it was first discovered, and it was with very
considerable difficulty, they were brought from the flames. Not
the least doubt was for an instant entertained, but this building
was set fire to purposely, though nothing could be discovered. In
a few days after this fire, some of the Irish convicts with
blackened faces, broke into the house of one of the missionaries,
and not content with robbing him of all he had, they wounded him
in several places.</p>
<p>The badness of the harvest, which seemed to indicate a very
material degree of want in the article of grain, by no means
tempted those who wished to distil spirituous liquors, to forego
their inclinations though so repeatedly forbidden, consequently
former orders on this subject were repeated, and several stills
seized and destroyed.</p>
<p>The harvest which had most certainly been very unproductive,
offered to the settlers an excuse for requesting the loan of
grain from the public store for seed, but as too many examples
had proved how little good, could result from endeavouring to
assist them, they were refused, for their own stock they were
known to have sold for spirits, and in some instances even that
lent them for seed before they left the store-house door, and for
the sole purpose of obtaining spirits; which may, with great
propriety, be deemed the forbidden fruit of New South Wales; and
the effects of plucking it (if I may be allowed the simile) was
again exemplified on the last day of this month, when a soldier
was found dead, sitting on the ground with his back reclined
against the barracks; he had, in an inordinate desire for
spirits, taken too copious a draught the preceding night, and
unable to reach home, undoubtedly fell down in the position he
was found, and thus, like Bibo, was drunk when he died; and
though, from the situation in which he was found, he appeared to
have resigned his life without a struggle; it affords to any mind
capable of thinking an example at once just and dreadful; for the
mind, thus rendered incapable of retaining a proper sense of the
creator, is thus shewn not fit to exist.</p>
<p>The excessive heat of so long a continuance had very much
affected the water. Those ponds which still retained any, were so
reduced, that the major part of them were become most intolerable
brackish, and hardly drinkable. This circumstance made it
strongly conjectured, that the earth contained a very large
portion of salt, as at this time the ponds on the high grounds
were even very far from fresh. All the woods from Sydney to
Paramatta were absolutely completely on fire, the trees were
burnt to the tops, and all the grass destroyed.</p>
<p>To counteract if it was possible the vile intentions of those
wicked wretches who were directly or indirectly concerned in
setting the gaol on fire, a strong building of stone, with
substantial walls, was began this month, which was well
calculated to defeat any future attempt to reduce it by fire.</p>
<p>The long dry weather which had prevailed, to the great injury
of cultivation, was succeeded in the beginning of March by rain
for several days, which much refreshed the gardens then nearly
burnt up, and revived at all parts of the island the shockingly
perishing vegetation. At the Hawkesbury, a sad accident occurred,
which, proved destructive to the settlers at that place. The
river suddenly, and in the course of a few hours, swelled to the
height of 50 feet from its usual level, and with that rapidity as
to carry every thing that stood in the way before it. The
government store-house, erected at the first settling in this
part, was in the course of this inundation, swept away, with all
the provisions it contained. Several inhabitants were taken from
the ridges of their houses, by boats only in time to save their
lives; for most of the dwellings were inundated, and the whole
country appeared one extensive lake. A very considerable number
of live-stock, with a great part of the produce of the last
harvest, and the household property of the people, were driven
away by the torrent. Fortunate indeed may it be esteemed, only
one life was lost.</p>
<p>This proved a shocking calamity; as no cause had appeared to
indicate an overflow of the river, the settlers were by no means
prepared for such an event. The natives however foresaw it, and
advised the inhabitants of it, but, not liking to be taught by
untutored savages, they neglected their advice, and thus
ruinously felt the effects. There was no doubt, unperceived by
the settlers a very heavy fall of rain in the interior, among the
mountains, and, from the parched state of the land for such a
long time, it had not been absorbed, but ran down the sides of
the hills, filling the low grounds, and branches of the river,
which, was in form strictly serpentine, and could not give a
passage to the water as fast as it descended.</p>
<p>It was very generally believed, this violent inundation would,
however, prove beneficial to the grounds overflowed, making them
produce with such abundance as to cover the loss sustained. In a
few days this collection of water found its way to the sea, and,
the river resumed its usual level, when the settlers began fresh
cropping their grounds; for which purpose they applied to the
Governor for seed wheat, which certainly could not be well
refused, but an application made at the same time for beds and
cloathing, could not be granted, as the store was not rich enough
in these articles to afford relief.</p>
<p>The Rebecca whaler arriving, brought the account of the battle
of the Nile, which was celebrated by a discharge of the
artillery. The goods which arrived in the Rebecca for sale, were
not able to be disposed of at Sydney, as a bad harvest had
prevented the settlers being in possession of any money. The
Nautilus was therefore chartered to convey them to Norfolk
Island, where they might find a market.</p>
<p>The Britannia came in to repair, and her success could by no
means be complained of, as she had procured nearly 26 tons of oil
while absent, and had the weather been more favourable, she would
have taken much more.</p>
<p>During March, the criminal court met once, when one man
received sentence of death for house breaking; and another for
the same offence, was to be transported for 14 years. The civil
court was a week deciding a variety of causes for debt.</p>
<p>On the 1st of April the criminal court was assembled for the
trial of a soldier, who a few days before stabbed a seaman
belonging to the Reliance, that insulted him while on duty as
centinal on a wharf at Sydney. As the man died, the soldier was
of course tried for murder, but in the defence he made it was
proved to the court, that it was occasioned by the intemperance
of the seaman, in consequence of which he was accordingly found
to have committed a justifiable homicide.</p>
<p>To this effect of intoxication, a few days added another
victim, in the person of a female, either the real or pretended
wife of Simon Taylor, a man who had ever been considered one of
the very few industrious settlers the colony could boast. They
had been drinking together, unfortunately, to great excess; and
in that state quarrelled, when the unhappy man put an end to her
existence. He was taken into custody directly, and confined for
trial.</p>
<p>A grub-worm was found in several parts of the cultivated
ground, which did very considerable damage; and at the Hawkesbury
a eatery pillar commenced its ravages, on the young grain just as
it was shooting out of the earth. This circumstance occasioned
some delay in sowing that ground which belonged to
government.</p>
<p>It was for some days reported, that the crews of two boats,
suffered to go to Hunter's river for a load of coal, had been cut
off by the natives, the Governor ordered his whale-boat to be
well armed, and to proceed thither in quest of the boats and
their crews; sending in her Henry Hacking, who from his past
services still retained the Governor's confidence. On his return,
the information he gave his Excellency was, that on arriving he
found an attempt had been made to burn the lesser boat, which had
only three men in her, who on leaving Sydney, were provided with
a musket each; the men were, however, not to be found. Going in
search of them, he met with a large body of armed savages. On
asking them to tell him what was become of the white men, the
natives said, they were gone to Sydney; but as he found they had
taken away the sails, the men's blankets, and every thing that
they had with them, this did not satisfy him; so he then
threatened to fire if they did not inform him directly, and
presented his musquet at them. At this they laughed, and said,
that if he did not go away, and leave the small boat, he had
brought, and the whale-boat they would spear every white man
there, and accordingly poised their spears in a very threatening
manner. Hacking again levelled his piece at them, and snapped it
without priming, merely to alarm them; but they on the contrary,
became far more noisy and violent than before. Finding an attack
was certain, he charged with buckshot, and ordered them to leave
the place; but, their violence increasing, he at length fired,
and four fell, one of whom got up again and ran away; but as the
other three remained on the ground, they were most probably
mortally wounded. The whole body now disappeared, leaving Hacking
to retreat unmolested.</p>
<p>As our people had been in the constant habit of visiting this
river for coals, and were always very particular in their conduct
to all the natives they met with, treating them with kindness and
civility, for their behaviour there was but one way to account.
It has ever been universally allowed, that all savages are under
the influence of sudden impulse, which nearly renders it
impossible to trust them with security.</p>
<p>The men belonging to the boats were not heard of for some
time, which made it feared they had been murdered, but they very
fortunately reached the settlement in perfect safety.</p>
<p>On the 24th of April, the Nautilus returned from Norfolk
Island, and with her a Spanish ship, a prize to two whalers,
captured off Cape Blanco on the coast of Peru. The Spaniard was
bound from Lima to Guiaquill.</p>
<p>A vice-admiralty court being assembled, she was condemned as a
legal prize, and that part of her cargo, consisting of sugar and
flour, was in a few days sold by public auction; but a quantity
of an ardent spirit, similar to the aqua ardente of the Brazils,
the Governor would not allow to be sold.</p>
<p>This new circumstance in the history of New South Wales, wore
the very promising appearance of rendering it of more consequence
than it had previously been; it indeed proved, that in a Dutch or
Spanish war, it might become a place of importance, as it at once
offered a reception to the prizes, and a court were they could be
condemned, as well as a market for their cargoes.</p>
<p>On the 26th, the Norfolk returned from Norfolk Island, with
information that the maize harvest had entirely failed, in
consequence of the long drought.</p>
<p>The want of clothing, during April, stimulated several
experiments to be made, to remedy what indeed there seemed no
other way of getting the better of. An end of a linen web,
produced from flax of the country, was crossed with thread, made
of the bark of a tree, and a web from the bark was crossed by a
thread of wool. Specimens of these were sent to England, and at
least served to shew, that with proper tools, and proper hands,
much might be done; nor must be forgot, the discovery of a strata
of coal, or the iron ore, which on being smelted, has been found
at least equal to the Swedish iron.</p>
<p>His Majesty's ship the Buffalo, arrived from England, on the
3d of May. At the Cape of Good Hope she took on board 66 head of
cattle, which were landed in good condition. She brought various
tools and articles of hardware for the colony, but no bedding or
cloathing had been sent out.</p>
<p>Mr. Raven commanded this ship, by whose services the colony
was much benefitted when in the ship Britannia, and was sent out
to replace the Supply, and whose commander, Lieut. Kent, was with
her officers and crew to be removed to the Buffalo; and the
Governor was directed to furnish Mr. Raven a passage to
England.</p>
<p>This ship, notwithstanding she was named the Buffalo, had at
her head a carved figure of a kangaroo, with which the natives
appeared very much pleased not expecting to see the animals of
their country represented by us in wood.</p>
<p>The natives still hostile to the settlers, speared one of
those at George's river so shockingly that he died of the
wounds.</p>
<p>The natives of New South Wales, though they retained the
greatest ferocity towards our people, were not divested entirely
of the softer passions, for occasionally they would retire to the
woods and unbend their morose natures by singing and dancing; but
that savage disposition which is universally found among them,
even on these occasions gets superior to every other sensation,
and they have absolutely been known to leave these parties of
pleasure to satisfy that thirst for revenge for which they are at
all times found to be so particularly eminent.</p>
<p>On the 16th of May, Simon Taylor was brought before the
criminal court of judicature for the murder of his wife; and
being convicted, he received sentence of death, and was executed
on the 20th, at Paramatta. This man was sensible of his guilt,
and admonished the spectators against indulging in drunkenness,
which had brought him to his disgraceful end.</p>
<p>Another man, was adjudged corporal punishment, and one year's
hard labour, for embezzling some live-stock, the property of
government, which had been entrusted to his care. He had been one
of the convicts who were with Capt. Riou in the Guardian, who on
account of their good conduct before and after the accident,
received emancipation, and were allowed to provide for their own
support. Few however were found to merit this indulgence, and
this last act strongly pointed out how requisite it was, for free
persons to be sent out from England to take care of the public
live-stock, and other purposes of trust.</p>
<p>A highway robbery was committed on the 23d, between Sydney and
Paramatta. Three men rushed from a wood, and knocking down a
young man travelling from the first to the last mentioned town,
emptied his pockets of several dollars. However recovering, and
finding only one man, who was trying to get his handkerchief from
his neck, he had a struggle with him, and the thief not being the
strongest, was secured and conveyed to Paramatta. A court
assembled for his trial; but the evidence being defective he was
acquitted.</p>
<p>[The following inserted into 2nd Edition]</p>
<blockquote>[Those prisoners who are guilty of theft have
latterly been transported to some remote settlement; which system
of punishment has been found more efficacious than castigation,
or any other corporal punishment, since they feel an
unconquerable repugnancy to the idea of a separation from their
connections and companions, and entertain a sensible dread of
solitude.<br>

"Of late years a number of vessels have been seized and carried
away by the convicts. Lately the <i>Venus</i>, a brig belonging
to Messrs. Robert Campbell and Co. laden with a quantity of
provisions and stores to supply the settlements to the southward,
and a very handsome brig, called the <i>Harrington</i>, from
Madras, were seized and taken off. The former, when she had
reached the place of her destination, after coming to an anchor,
and landing the Master with dispatches for the
Lieutenant-Governor, was seized by some convicts who had been
placed on board under confinement, aided by part of the crew, and
was carried beyond the reach of recapture. The latter was cut out
of Farm Cove, and was carried out to sea, before any information
was received on the subject.&mdash;This transaction was planned
in a very secret manner; so that all the convicts boarded her
about twelve o'clock at night; and although the vessel lay in
sight of some part of the town, and within the fire of two
batteries, yet nothing was discovered of the circumstance till
the following morning. Upon representation being made to Col.
Johnston, that officer ordered several boats to be manned
immediately, and a party of the New South Wales, with a number of
inhabitants who had volunteered their services to use every means
to retake the vessel, put to sea; but after rowing and sailing
about for several hours, they were obliged to return without ever
coming in sight of the <i>Harrington</i>. Other means were
subsequently tried for the recovery of the vessel, but all to no
effect: the convicts had managed their matters with such secresy,
promptitude, and skill, as totally prevented every endeavour to
counteract their intention."]</blockquote>
<p>Fresh pork having been for some time received into the store,
there were now found six months' salt provisions on hand; but
without this supply from the produce of the country all would
have been consumed, and the colony left destitute of animal food,
unless an inroad had been made on the live-stock.</p>
<p>The curing of pork at Norfolk Island was encouraged by every
means; but the casks in which the salt meat was sent from England
were so weak by their arrival that not one in twenty was fit for
that use again. Had any timber, for this use been found, a supply
of hoops and salt pans would have been wanting; and, if not cured
in the winter season, and the method observed by Capt. Cook which
was now used at Norfolk Island, it remained doubtful whether it
could be carried to any serviceable extent.</p>
<p>Fresh pork being raised in consequence of the bad crops
produced by the late harvest, afforded some relief to those who
had materially suffered, the commissary was, at the close of this
month, directed to pay only the former price, of nine-pence per
pound.</p>
<p>On a review of the public stores respecting salt provision, it
was found necessary to make a small reduction in time, to avoid a
greater. It was therefore ordered, that the rations should be
delivered as follows to each man weekly,</p>

<p>and this deduction was only to continue till the arrival of a
store-ship with salted provisions.</p>
<p>And to such men as were entitled, was issued as much as blue
gurrah (or East India bunting) and thread as would make a frock
and trowsers, a proportion was also delivered to the women and
children. These gurrahs were brought from India in the
speculative cargos to this country, and were at last found useful
to cover the absolute nakedness of too many people.</p>
<p>The arrival of the Buffalo, enabled the Governor at length to
inform those people convicted in Ireland, and transported to New
South Wales, that he had received a statement of the sentences of
those brought in the Queen; and an assurance, that the lists of
those sent out since should be forwarded by the next vessel which
sailed for the colony.</p>
<p>The Diana and Eliza whalers came in to refit, and refresh on
the 2d of June. Each had procured upwards of twenty-five tons of
spermaceti oil since they left port, and had seen the Britannia,
which had still better success, having one hundred and ten tons
of oil on board.</p>
<p>On the 3d the Indispensible sailed on a fishing voyage, after
having been careened and repaired in the Cove.</p>
<p>The masters of the whalers, asserted that ships properly
fitted for the variable weather they are liable to meet with on
the coast, must most undoubtedly succeed.</p>
<p>In the evening on the 4th, the weather became tempestuous,
which continued for three days blowing a heavy gale from the
Southward, with a deluge of rain; several public buildings,
erected with great labour, were very much damaged; among others
was the tower of the new mill at Sydney, which was so much
injured, that it was found necessary to take the whole down.</p>
<p>This gale subsiding, returned about the middle of the month,
blowing with increased violence, and attended with another deluge
of rain. Its effects were more destructive than the former, doing
great injury to various public and private buildings. One side of
the church tower was destroyed, the clock was, however,
fortunately saved. The government house at Paramatta, which was
nearly finished, received very material injury, but was not
entirely destroyed. A man, crossing a gully betwixt Sydney and
Paramatta, was carried away by the torrent and drowned. The
cattle suffered much, and some of both the public and private
stock perished.</p>
<p>The storm did so much damage, that the settlement was thrown
back at least 12 months in those works, which would have been
shortly completed. The weather had never been so severe as at the
beginning of this month. The settlement had from the fires of the
summer, and the floods and gales of the winter, suffered very
considerably. In addition to these, great inconvenience arose
from the late unproductive harvest, as well as from an exhausted
store in the articles of clothing and bedding, the hostile
disposition of the natives, and the absence of morality, honesty,
and industry in the colonists.</p>
<p>Every exertion was made to redress the misfortunes suffered by
the late tempest, and it was hoped they would be surmounted
during the present year. The erection of the stone prison at
Sydney, was found very expensive, the Governor therefore called a
meeting of the officers, inhabitants, and landholders, and
proposed a portion to be furnished by each, of money, as well as
labour; which was agreed to by them; and that building was
carried on at their expense, the public stores only furnishing
the iron wanted.</p>
<p>On the 29th, the Albion arrived from England, having made the
quick passage of only three months and 15 days. She brought 900
tierces of salt pork, and some dispatches.</p>
<p>Mr. Ebor Bunker, who commanded the Albion, had been at Port
Jackson in the William and Ann transport, and was now
commissioned by her owners, Messrs. Champions, to give the whale
fishing on the coast a fair trial. For this purpose the ship was
fitted out liberal, with every store for her own use, and every
comfort for her people.</p>
<p>On the 2d of July, a horrid murder was effected on Mr. Samuel
Clode, one of the missionaries from Otaheite. This act of
barbarity was committed at the brick-fields, in the hut of one
Thomas Jones. His brains were beat out with an axe, and his
throat cut so as nearly to sever the head from the body, which
was then thrown into a sawpit full of water, and covered with
bushes. Here it remained only until the following morning, when
it was discovered by a labouring man, who went to get his hoe;
which, to prevent being stolen, he had been in the habit of
hiding every night in the sawpit.</p>
<p>Suspicion falling upon four persons, they were apprehended;
and the criminal court being convened, three, Thomas Jones, (a
soldier,) his wife, and John Albury, were, on the clearest
evidence, convicted of the murder, and sentenced to suffer
death.</p>
<p>It came out on the trial, that 10<i>l</i>. which Jones was
indebted to Mr. Clode, tempted him to effect his destruction. For
this purpose he told that unfortunate gentleman, that if he would
call at his hut in the evening he would pay him. Mr. Clode called
at the time appointed, and While stooping at a table to write a
receipt, he received the first blow of the axe, from the hand of
Jones (Albury's resolution, who it was agreed should give it,
failing at the moment), this fellow had from some pecuniary
transaction been under an obligation, and took this infernal
method of discharging it.</p>
<p>They were convicted on the 4th, and executed on the 6th, on
the spot were the murder was committed. The house was then pulled
down and burnt, and the bodies of the two men were hung in chains
near the place; the woman's was delivered for dissection to the
surgeons.</p>
<p>To form a just idea of the shocking abandoned state of the
settlement at this time, it will only be requisite to peruse the
following orders, that were issued.</p>
<p>"From the late increased number of nocturnal robberies, there
is much reason to suspect that the petty constables, and
divisional watchmen are either extremely negligent in the
performance of their duty, or that they suffer themselves to be
prevailed on by the housebreakers to be less vigilant than that
duty requires, and to connive at their depredations on the
inhabitants. A continuance of this unpardonable remissness upon
their part must dispose the more respectable inhabitants to
believe them partakers with the thieves. It is, therefore, hereby
particularly recommended by the Governor to every officer in the
colony, as they value the security of their property, to give
their utmost assistance to those immediately concerned in the
executive part of the civil police, in putting as speedily as
possible, a stop to so very great an evil. It is also
particularly recommended to the principal inhabitants of the
towns of Sydney and Paramatta, that they select a few of the most
respectable of their number, in each division of these towns,
whom they may authorize to consider, of the most effectual means
of detecting the robber, and bringing them to trial; whether by
such rewards as they may be enabled to offer, or by small
divisional patroles for the night service, and who shall take
that duty by turns, and be under the immediate direction of a
reputable inhabitant, of their own choice, or an officiating
constable selected from among the most sober and vigilent of that
description of persons."</p>
<p>Proposals were to be sent to the Judge-Advocate's office, and
a bench of magistrates were either to approve or alter them.</p>
<p>This order was published on the 2d, and next day the following
appeared:</p>
<p>"The continual complaints which are made of the conduct of the
female convicts require the most rigid and determined discipline
with such characters, who to the disgrace of their sex, are far
worse than the men, and are generally found at the bottom of
every infamous transaction that is committed in the colony. It is
hereby most strenuously recommended to the magistrates in
general, that on proof being brought before them of any improper
conduct in those dangerous and mischievous characters, or of any
disobedience of orders, or neglect of such duty as they may be
directed to perform, they may be ordered such exemplary
punishment, either corporal or otherwise, as the nature of their
crime may call for. This measure will appear the more necessary,
when it is recollected, that formerly, when such punishments were
had recourse to, these women gave much less trouble, and were far
more orderly in their conduct."</p>
<p>The superintendants were directed not to allow them to leave
their work, but to see they were employed during those hours
allotted for their labour.</p>
<p>The first of the orders was attended with effect; for in a few
days, several who had been out of their time, were employed only
in wandering from one district to another, without any honest
means of getting bread, were apprehended, and being examined,
were ordered to labour.</p>
<p>The genius of wickedness ever ready to reap advantage by any
oversight, or want of caution, either on the part of government
or individuals, now largely availed themselves of the little
precaution used, on receiving live-stock at the public stores,
and actually made a regular practice of stealing hogs, &amp;c.
during the night, and selling them the next day at the store; but
no sooner was this detected, than the Governor ordered nothing to
be received without a voucher as to whose property it was.</p>
<p>The middle of July was occupied in taking an account of the
inhabitants of the settlements, the land in cultivation, and
live-stock on hand, for the purpose of forwarding to England with
the next dispatches. The number of acres in wheat amounted to
4393, and in maize to 1440, or thereabouts.</p>
<p>A sealer at the Hawkesbury, who had been a convict, had more
land in cultivation than any individual in that district, having
46 acres in wheat, and five in maize.</p>
<p>A man, left by a Mr. Hogan, in the care of some land bought by
him in 1796, had now 200 acres in wheat, and the Commissary, Mr.
Palmer, had an agent who, by great attention, had got upwards of
290 acres in wheat.</p>
<p>Hogs were still numerous in this district, notwithstanding the
great slaughter amongst them of late for the store. The settlers
had indeed few sheep, but nearly 250 goats.</p>
<p>The ground in cultivation was considerably less in the
neighbourhood of Paramatta, but the settlers were also
proportionally few. The number of settlers at the Hawkesbury
being nearly 200, and at Paramatta only 100. The widow of a
superintendant had 50 acres in wheat, and 23 in maize. A man,
named Edward Elliot, who had withstood every temptation to sell
the single ewe given him by Governor Phillip*, had now 116 sheep,
and was in a fair way of becoming a man of considerable
property.</p>
<p align="center"><small>[* Vide page 163. [Chapter
VI]]</small></p>
<p>I had myself at this period, a live-stock consisting of 13
sheep, 55 goats, and 2 mares, with 25 acres of ground in wheat;
but esteemed myself much richer, in possessing the good opinion
of every gentleman in the country which I trust I shall retain
for the very few years, I may in all probability be in existence,
for endeavouring to discharge the important office committed to
my charge, has materially affected my health, but while I am
honoured with any office under government, I shall, I hope, never
be found wanting in the execution of my duty, even though I
forfeit a life, which I lament has not always been so worthily
employed!</p>
<p>In the district of Paramatta, the total of the live-stock were
332 sheep, 903 goats, and 428 hogs.</p>
<p>The land in cultivation about Sydney, was very inconsiderable,
and the live-stock, exclusive of the officers and free settlers,
was only 38 sheep, 292 goats, and 362 hogs, the convict settlers
amounted to 70 only.</p>
<p>Thus the agricultural affairs of the country were by no means
in a contemptible state, and how very far superior must they have
been, had the convicts and other labourers used any thing like
decent industry. All the females among the wild herd of cattle in
the woods, still remained untouched by order of the Governor, and
it was determined they should remain so, till the period arrived,
when from its increased numbers it might afford a permanent
supply, and the too numerous males, at present afforded an
agreeable variety, to the rations delivered from the stores.</p>
<p>The Hillsborough transport arrived from England on the 26th of
July, when she sailed, the number of male convicts on board,
amounted to three hundred, but the gaol fever, breaking out among
them on the passage, ninety-five died which number was encreased
by six more within a few days after they landed.</p>
<p>The erection of the stone gaol proceeding too slowly, the
constables of the divisions of Sydney were ordered to inform the
inhabitants of their divisions, that they must furnish from each,
viz. from King's, Nepean's, Banks's, and Maskelyne's divisions,
as well as from the Brick-fields, five men each day and a
watchman to attend them. These were to be relieved by the same
number every day, as long as the work should require such
assistance.</p>
<p>In the beginning of August the Governor employed several days
taking an excursion from Prospect Hill to the settlement near
George's river. Having formerly surveyed the country from
Paramatta to that river, he determined to trace it in another
direction, and had the satisfaction of finding, that it was
equally favourable to cultivation with that before taken notice
of. The distance from the hill was about five miles, over very
fine ground, adapted for cultivation and pasturage, and equal to
any part of New South Wales. The settlers placed there were doing
very well, and had not been troubled for some time by the
natives. His Excellency now proceeded down the river to Botany
Bay, and walked from there to Sydney, the space between which
places is nothing but barren and uneven ground, covered very
generally with flowering heath.</p>
<p>In a few days after his return, the Norfolk arrived from the
Northward.</p>
<p>The Governor being anxious to obtain some information relative
to the coast Northward of Port Jackson, and more particularly of
two openings laid down by Capt. Cook, the further-most North of
which he called Hervey Bay, and seemed to lie in latitude 24&deg;
36' South, Lieut. Flinders, was directed by his Excellency to
proceed in the Norfolk Northward, and examine them with all the
accuracy six weeks would suffer him.</p>
<p>The Norfolk was manned from the two king's ships, and Lieut.
Flinders took with him a native named Bong-ree, who was
remarkable for his good disposition. To guard against accidents,
they were supplied with eleven weeks provisions, and the vessel
sailed on the 8th of July on this service to the Northward, and
Lieut. Flinders on his return delivered to the Governor the
substance of the following particular and very interesting
account:</p>
<p>Soon after seven in the morning of the 9th they sounded,
without finding ground at fifteen fathoms, at the distance of
half a mile from a reef of black rocks. There were two low and
dangerous rocks, lying between three and four miles from this
point.</p>
<p>Sounding again they found ground with ten fathoms of line,
half a mile from shore, abreast Cape Hawke. Two hills noticed by
Capt. Cook stood on the Cape, and were covered with brush-wood,
and the strata lay many degrees from horizontal. From the Cape
the coast falls back, forming a double bay. The land which was
low, rose gradually, ridge over ridge inland, which made the
country look pleasant from the sea, though the trees were very
small indeed.</p>
<p>In the morning of the 10th they discovered the vessel had been
carried by a current considerably to the Southward, and at noon
found a difference of thirty-three miles.</p>
<p>The sloop was this morning found to have a bad leak, which
admitted water so fast that one pump was obliged to be kept
constantly at work. Its coming on suddenly was considered not to
have been occasioned by any strain. But from whatever cause it
arose it was of a serious nature, as the maize with which the
sloop had been loaded continually choaking up the pumps.</p>
<p>The Solitary Isles came in sight on the 11th, Lieut. Flinders
intended to have landed on them, but no inducement presented
itself; as on them he saw neither a seal or bird. They appeared
covered with brush; the colour of the rock, and general
appearance, much resembled the small islands off Tasman's-head.
At noon the country still continued to have the same irregular
appearance; but running along the shore it evidently grew worse,
having a still greater tendency to sand. The several projections
of land which appeared, often presented the appearance of
openings behind; which hopes they were inclined to entertain, as
Capt. Cook passed this part in the night.</p>
<p>Early in the afternoon a small island opened from a low rocky
point, behind which a small river run to the S.W. but breakers
appeared to extend nearly across the entrance.</p>
<p>A peaked hill, standing four or rive miles inland, and more
conspicuous than usual was seen soon after three o'clock P.M.
Before five, the vessel stood in for an opening, and soon after
dusk she anchored in two and a half fathoms of water on a hard
bottom of sand.</p>
<p>The objects in view inducing Lieut. Flinders to enter this bay
were, that he might by day-light run along the remaining part of
the coast, which Capt. Cook had only sailed by in the night, and
to seek a place of safety, should the wind fail him on his
return. The leak in the sloop was also a material inducement; for
should the place prove to be of consequence enough to expend a
few days in examining, and a place offer for laying her on shore,
he meant to get it stopped.</p>
<p>Examining this bay in his boat, he found it very shallow; and
the North point of the entrance proved a projecting spot of sandy
ground. Returning to the sloop at noon, he landed on the South
head to observe the latitude. The sun being half an hour from the
meridian allowed him time to examine three huts standing in a
circular form, at a little distance. The frame was composed of
strong tendrils of the vine, crossing each other in all
directions, bound by strong grass at the intersections. The roof
was bark, resembling that of the Tea-tree at Port Jackson, and so
laid on as to keep out both wind and rain. The entrance was by a
small avenue projecting from the periphery of the circle, and not
leading directly into the hut, but turned to prevent the rain
beating in. The height of the under part of the roof was about
five feet, and had collected a coat of soot, from fires having
been made in the middle of the huts. One was a double hut with
two recesses under one entrance, and large enough to contain
fifteen people. Bong-ree observed they were much superior to any
huts made by savages which he had ever seen. He brought away a
small hand-basket, made of some leaf, capable of holding two or
three quarts of water.</p>
<p>White cockatoos and parroquets were now seen, and a crow with
a note remarkable short and hasty. Pelicans, gulls and red-bills,
frequented the shoals, and the country was sandy wherever landed.
The palm nut tree found here was the third kind mentioned by
Capt. Cook as produced on the Eastern coast of New South Wales;
and as Bong-ree, who was acquainted with the country as far as
Port Stephens, never saw it before, this was probably one of the
most Southern situations in which it grew.</p>
<p>The nuts were seen about the fireplaces of the natives; the
lower end of which had been sucked, which method was afterwards
practised, on procuring some ripe ones. The taste though pleasant
at first, left an astringency behind, that by no means tempted a
second trial. The eatable part of the nut was so small, as not to
be worth sucking out from the fibres. Their size was that of a
walnut; within the outer skin was a hard shell like that of the
cocoa nut; and within this, two, or more almond-like kernels. The
nut, when taken from the tree, was an assemblage of these kernels
set into a cone, varying, in the size of a man's fist, to that of
a melon. The size, and indentations on the surface, on a first
view looked much like the outward form of the breadfruit. The
stem of the tree was short, and none were observed to be eighteen
inches in diameter. The branches did not ramify into twigs, but
preserved their size to the extreme, where the leaves were
produced surrounding the fruit. One or two smaller branches
struck off from the main branch, and produced their leaves in the
same way, without fruit The height of the tree altogether might
be from fifteen to twenty-five feet. Suckers or branches of all
sizes were seen shooting out below those bearing fruit, growing
downwards along the stem, which entered the ground and formed
roots, as well as supporters to the tree.</p>
<p>This bay not appearing to deserve a particular examination,
Lieut. Flinders got under weigh at one o'clock in the afternoon
of the 12th.</p>
<p>On Saturday the 13th, at ten in the morning they were three
miles from Cape Byron, and the peak of Mount Warning just
appeared over it. Having hauled more off the shore, to avoid the
reef lying off Point Danger, on the following morning they were
at a great distance from land. They now steered West for a large
space, where no land was visible, and, perceiving breakers off
the South point of the opening, found this was Moreton Bay.
Passing between these breakers and Point Look-out, they got
ground in twenty fathoms water. As they drew nearer, there
appeared to be a large extent of water in the opening; but Lieut.
Flinders suspected there was no passage for a vessel in the
direction he was steering. The country to the sea-ward was very
sandy. Cape Moreton was at dusk only distant two miles; and the
highest Glass-House, presented itself over the distant land. Two
hummocks resembling haycocks, distinct from any other land,
opened soon after to the Southward.</p>
<p>The vessel was now hauled in round Cape Moreton, to go into
Glass-House Bay. They steered West till eight o'clock, when
having little wind, and that from the Southward, they dropped
anchor. Weighing again the next morning, the 14th, they worked
near the Eastern shore till noon.</p>
<p>While within a mile of the shore, ten natives were distinctly
seen, half of whom were most probably women, as they kept behind
the others. The men made many gestures to our people. One had a
green branch in his hand, which he waved from the ground on one
side of him to the other, and some of them ran into the water
occasionally, and beat the surface with sticks. They appeared to
be friendly, using the same word in calling as that made use of
by the Port Jackson natives, and appeared very desirous indeed,
that the vessel should proceed up the bay.</p>
<p>In the evening Lieut. Flinders anchored in eleven fathoms
water, two miles from shore.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the 16th, at day-light, they weighed to turn up
the bay. In their progress, they found various depths of water;
and, perceiving an opening in the Western land, Lieut. Flinders
wished to anchor near it, but shoal water prevented him. At a
quarter past eight in the morning, however, they cast anchor in
three fathoms of water.</p>
<p>Lieut. Flinders went in his boat towards the opening, taking
with him Bong-ree the native. As they approached the sandy point
on the East side of the opening, some dogs came down upon the
beech, and shortly several natives appeared, carrying fishing
nets over their shoulders. They lay upon their oars some time,
conversing with them by signs, and repeating the words which they
made use of. As they seemed to be friendly, Bong-ree resolved to
visit them; and seeing nothing among them but the pieces of
firewood, which these savages usually carry about with them, the
boat was backed in, when he jumped on shore, naked, and as
unarmed as themselves.</p>
<p>He soon made an exchange of the yarn belt from his waist, for
a fillet of kangaroo hair. The muskets were kept at hand in the
boat to guard against any treachery; every thing seeming to go on
well, the natives appearing rather shy than otherwise, Lieut
Flinders joined his companion, taking his gun with him. By making
friendly signs, laying down the gun, and offering a woollen cap,
he was suffered to approach, and one took the cap; but when
Lieut. Flinders made him understand he expected his net bag in
return, he let him know he must first give him his hat. This hat,
made of white filaments of the cabbage-tree, seemed to excite the
attention of the whole party.</p>
<p>As the hat was not given to the native, he came forward, first
throwing the cap on the bank behind him, to secure it, and seemed
very anxious for the hat or gun, if not both. Every tiling was,
however, still carried on very amicably; and Lieut. Flinders,
with Bong-ree, made slowly towards the boat, but turned again, as
he found they pressed too close after them. One native laughing,
and talking as well as he could to Lieut. Flinders, tried to take
his hat with a hooked stick, which, on being discovered caused a
laugh. Behind another was stretching his arm to the same object,
but fear prevented his coming near enough to reach it.</p>
<p>When our people got into the boat, and shoved her into deep
water, they were not pleased, but tried to induce them to land
again. Finding this not succeed, one threw his piece of fire-wood
at them; as it fell short the matter was treated as a joke.
Another now ran into the water, and threw his, which likewise
fell short: he then took the hooked stick, and slipped off the
hook, which was only tied on, shewed a spear, with which he ran
up to his middle in water, and threw; it passed over the center
of the boat, but touched no one.</p>
<p>In consequence of this unprovoked attack, Lieut. Flinders
snapped his gun at the man who threw the spear; the flint being
wet, it missed fire; but as the offender still stood in the water
with his back towards them, and calling to his companions, Lieut.
Flinders again tried, and the gun again missed fire.</p>
<p>During this transaction, the greater part of the natives were
observing Lieut. Flinders' motions with much unconcern. On the
third trial, however, it went off. The man in the water fell
flat, as did every individual among them; but those on the shore
rose directly, and scrambled away, some upright and others upon
their hands and feet. One of the people in the boat then fired
among them, and they fell again upon their faces; but, as none
were killed, they all got up, and made off behind a bank. The man
in the water now rose up, and proceeded the same way, but his
progress was slower than the others, he stooped much, carrying
one hand behind him on his back. From whence it was thought he
had been wounded, he continually looked over his shoulder,
perhaps expecting to see a spear sticking in his back. Bong-ree
said another native had his arm broke by the second shot.</p>
<p>This wanton attack, which obliged the party to fire on these
people, in order to maintain that superiority which they esteemed
it requisite to assert, Lieut. Flinders thought might be the
means of preventing future mischief, by giving them an extensive
idea of his power, and thus deter them from any future attempt in
his intercourse with them. For as he had to examine this bay, and
the leak was to be stopped, it became probable they would often
meet; and he was satisfied of the great influence which the awe
of a superior power has on savages, to create respect.</p>
<p>With this view he fired at a man among the trees, who being
above two hundred yards off, certainly esteemed himself safe. One
of the balls grazed the bank in a line for him, but if it took
effect, it could not be seen. They then landed to bring away the
nets, which it was supposed the natives in their flight had
forgot to take with them. On viewing the bank to ascertain the
position of the natives, he saw several running various ways
among the trees, with an apparent design of coming round on them;
and, not knowing their force or numbers, Lieut. Flinders ordered
the native and a man who had landed to return to the boats, as no
nets were left as expected.</p>
<p>The low sandy point where this business happened, obtained for
it the name of Point Skirmish; they afterwards proceeded up the
opening, which proved to be a river leading to the Glass-House
peaks. These peaks stood on the low flat ground, much within the
mountains, and as far as could well be judged, had a volcanic
appearance, as a quantity of pumice-stone was found lying at the
high-water mark on the shore, where Lieut. Flinders landed to
mark the nature of the country, not being able to proceed in his
boat.</p>
<p>Among the most common trees there was one differing from any
at Port Jackson. The leaves were of a dark hue, and bore
resemblance to the pine. The wood on being cut smelt of
turpentine, which exuded where the bark had been wounded. The
external part was white, but the body was of a reddish brown, the
bark resembling that of the iron bark tree at Port Jackson.</p>
<p>The blue gum, she-oak, and cherry tree of Port Jackson were
also here, and one with the leaves of the gum tree, but with the
soft bark of the tea tree, and the soil it grew in was sandy.
Fearing the natives might surprise them among the trees, they did
not go far from the beach.</p>
<p>Several huts, from 12 to 15 feet in length, were standing near
each other. They appeared like a covered archway, rounded at the
end. The roofs, and way of securing them, were nearly the same as
those in Shoal Bay; but these had no curved entrance to keep out
the weather, nor was the hut smaller in that part than elsewhere,
the sides and roof were equally calculated to shelter the
inhabitants from a storm, In one of them was found a small light
shield, and in another a net, which had a hag to it, knotted and
made in the same way as it would have been if made by an European
workman.</p>
<p>Returning to the sloop they passed a dry shoal lying at the
entrance of the river, the deep channel into which was between
this shoal and Point Skirmish, where they found from three to six
fathoms water.</p>
<p>Before he left the sloop, Lieut. Flinders gave directions to
examine a part on the starboard side, where he suspected the leak
to be; and on his return found it to have been occasioned by the
starting of a plank from the timber near the keel. The caulker
had filled it up with oakum from the inside, since which she had
made but little water.</p>
<p>From the situation in which the sloop lay, the bay had not any
appearance of closing round, but seemed to promise a large river
at its head, and a communication with Moreton Bay. At three in
the afternoon they got under weigh to proceed up this river, with
a light air from the Northward, standing to the Southward till
dark, at which time they anchored three miles from the shore, in
five fathoms, on a soft muddy bottom.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the 17th, at day-light, the sloop got under
weigh, with a Southerly breeze, as long as the tide lasted, and
anchored about ten o'clock, a mile and a half from a point
remarkable for its red cliffs. To the Westward of this point, the
latitude was 27&deg; 16' 25" South. The rocks were stone,
impregnated with iron, with some pieces of granite and crystal
about the shore.</p>
<p>From this point they made to a green headland, two miles
Westward. The reefs off this head appeared a truly remarkable
miniature of those that form a barrier to the North shore of New
South Wales.</p>
<p>In a hut standing on the side of the head, they found a net
fourteen fathoms long, with meshes larger than any English seine,
and of much stronger twine; its depth was, however, much less,
being only three feet, and at each end was a stick of nearly the
same length, pointed at the end. On the shoal near the hut were
several semicircular inclosures, made Math sticks and branches,
set and interwoven so close, that no fish could pass. The net
Lieut. Flinders supposed was to be placed across the semicircle
at high water, and thus secure the fish that might get within the
inclosure, until the tide should leave them dry. He brought away
the net, as a proof of the ingenuity of these natives, and left
them in return a hatchet, and that they might learn the great use
of it, he cut down several branches, and laid them near the
hut.</p>
<p>Some wood, which the crew at high water collected for their
fire, proved to be cedar of a fine grain. The remnant of a canoe
made of bark was found lying on the shore, near the hut from
which the net had been taken.</p>
<p>Many traces of dogs, kangaroos, and emus, were seen on the
beach. Two hawks were shot, and their plumage was very much
unlike any known at Port Jackson. The most remarkable was a dull
red colour in the body, with a white neck, breast, and head.</p>
<p>During the afternoon they made a further progress with the
sloop till night, when they anchored, and the following morning
got under weigh with a flood tide, and a gentle breeze from the
Northward. They shortly passed two islands three or four miles
each in circuit. The Northernmost was the largest, well covered
with wood. The trees up the Southern island were equally dark
with this, but the land of the interior part was higher than the
Northernmost, which was nearly level with the water. Besides
these there were two smaller islands, nearly on a level with the
first, covered pretty well with wood, but the Southernmost was
very small indeed.</p>
<p>Going between these two islands in deep water, it suddenly
shoaling they tacked to the Westward. This entrance from Moreton
Bay was open, and the South side bore N.68&deg;E. six or eight
miles, and the West of Moreton Island bore N.2&deg;W. Another
island, larger than either mentioned, bore from S.55&deg; to
34&deg;E. distant about five miles. Allowing the Northernmost of
the four to be the first, they made for the third island after
tacking, and the water deepened directly to six fathoms.</p>
<p>Their attention was attracted by some natives from these
islands, who appeared standing up in their canoes, and pulling to
them, in regular order. They seemed to have long poles or spears
with which they appeared to be paddling, all shifting their hands
at the same instant. About twenty of them were counted, and were
thought to be coming on with much resolution, so the crew
prepared for the event whatever it might be. The Norfolk was put
under easy sail, her decks cleared and each man had a number of
musquet-balls, pistol-balls, and buck-shot, to be used as
distance might seem to render requisite; as it was determined not
one should escape if they made an attack.</p>
<p>Thus prepared, they bore towards them, but finding at length
that notwithstanding all their exertions they did not approach
any nearer the vessel; to their great surprize they discovered
that instead of being in canoes to attack them, they were
standing on a flat, which surrounded the third island, driving
fish into their nets, and that they in fact, had only two canoes
among them. They stood all in a line, splashing the water with
sticks, first on one side and then on the other. This apparently
hostile array thus proved to be only a few men fishing, and they
were so peaceable that on the vessel's approach they sunk their
canoes on the flat, and retreating to the island made their
fires.</p>
<p>From the situation of the sloop at anchor, at noon Glass-House
Bay appeared closed round, except at one opening which bore
S.27&deg;E. To turn up this, they sailed as soon as the ebb tide
slacked. On standing near the South part of the shoal which
seemed to surround the island that the natives had retired to,
one came down abreast the sloop, making gestures, and running
backwards and forwards, but little attention was paid him, Lieut.
Flinders intending to get as far up, the bay as possible while
the tide served. At midnight he anchored as the deep water now
became contracted to a narrow channel.</p>
<p>The next day Lieut. Flinders landed on an island in his
passage. Recent footsteps of dogs, were numerous on the beach,
but traces of men but just visible: there were several
fire-places, and various other proofs of the island being
visited. This island was three miles in circumference. The
central part of which was higher than the skirts, and covered
with fine mould. On the S.E. side of the island it descended in a
steep bank, where the earth was as red as blood; and some parts
of it were as hard as rock. The trees on it were large and
luxuriant. On the S.W. and N.E. sides it was low and sandy, and
the palm nut-tree flourished here. These nuts it was supposed
formed the principal inducement for the natives to visit this
island; particularly as there was abundant testimony under the
trees that they did not fall off and rot. They found some boughs
ranged to keep off the wind; and from the fire-places which they
were to defend, it was thought not less than five or six natives
had made this their residence, but as they met with no huts
regularly constructed, it was probably only a temporary one.</p>
<p>Black and the white cockatoos, the beautiful lilac-headed
parroquet, and the bald-headed mocking bird of Port Jackson, were
seen, but no marks of resident quadrupeds, rats excepted, could
be discovered.</p>
<p>Beyond this island the bay was contracted into a river, of
considerable width, but it appeared so shoal, and so difficult of
access, that Lieut Flinders gave up all idea of pursuing it,
particularly as the winds were adverse: so he returned on board,
with the intention of visiting the river near the Glass-House
peaks, and there to lay the sloop on shore, and procure a supply
of water.</p>
<p>The following day passed in endeavouring to get into the
river, which, from the pumice-stone found on its shores, was
called Pumice-Stone River. And at sun-set they anchored within
two miles of its entrance.</p>
<p>On the morning of Sunday the 21st, Lieut. Flinders went in his
boat to examine the river, and its entrance. On nearing Point
Skirmish, several natives came down towards the boat unarmed,
and, by friendly offers of their girdles and nets, would fain
have pursuaded him to land; but as he could not be satisfied they
had not some treacherous design, or whether their being unarmed
arose from any confidence they might be inclined to place, he did
not choose to trust them, so proceeded in his examination of the
river.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding he found the shoals very intricate; yet, as
there was depth of water enough for the sloop, he determined to
get her in.</p>
<p>On these shoals several pelicans were seen; and they did not
go far before they were saluted with the well-known note of the
swan, which bird now took so much of their attention, that before
they left the river eight were killed.</p>
<p>Having now nearly reached the end of their excursion, two
natives came to the beach, and were very desirous they should
land. Being dry sand and at a distance to be safe from the reach
of spears, they put ashore on it. Lieut. Flinders taking up his
gun to fire at two red-bills, at the same time, the natives
alarmed ran to the woods; Bong-ree following they returned, when
he made an exchange for their hair fillets and belts, giving them
a woollen cap in return, and came to the boat for a piece of
cloth and some biscuit, to make the exchange more equal. During
this time Lieut. Flinders was on shore with a gun, to cover him
in case they behaved improperly. On his advancing to them, they
were very violent for him to keep at a distance, and would by no
means suffer him to approach without laying down his gun. Though
this place was six miles from Point Skirmish, it was evident that
the fame and dread of fire-arms had reached it, and undoubtedly
it must have been considerably increased by the shooting of the
swans, which they witnessed.</p>
<p>Returning down the river, they were hailed by a man on the
West side, with a spear in his hand; and two women and several
children being with him argued much against any premeditated
hostility. The women and children retired on the vessel
approaching; the shore; but they were observed to be peeping from
the bushes. The man was very anxious for the gun being laid down,
calling out "woo-rah, woo-rah", and seemed delighted when it was
complied with; but he did not appear to have heard many
particulars of their dangerous power, for on pointing a musquet
towards him, he by no means appeared sensible of any danger to
himself. As he would not quit his spear, and night was
approaching, they did not land, but backed in to throw him a
stocking, which they shewed him might be worn as a cap, and then
sailed on.</p>
<p>Monday the 22d was taken up in getting the sloop in the river,
which with some difficulty was accomplished, having to find out a
channel through a number of shoals. Having found a proper place
to lay the sloop on shore, on Thursday the 25th, they completed
stopping the leak, and was again in a condition to prosecute the
excursion to the Glass-House peaks.</p>
<p>A few hours before high water on the 23d, he attempted to get
some swans, but met with none but could fly. He saw several large
fish, or animals that came up to the surface of the water to
blow, like the porpoise, or seal, they did not spout, and had no
dorsal fin. The head resembled the bluff-nosed hair seal, but
their size was larger than any Lieut. Flinders had seen. He fired
three balls into one, and Bong-ree threw a spear in another; both
sunk, and were not seen again. These animals were supposed to be
sea-lions, and were observed no where but in this river.</p>
<p>Not finding fresh water to fill up their casks, they dug a
hole in a low situation a hundred yards inland. The first foot
was fine vegetable earth, mixed with a little black sand; the
three following feet were different layers of sand, and then they
came to the hardened black clay of which the rocks on the banks
were formed. Here the water began to ooze in at the sides of the
hole, which in the course of six-and-thirty hours was filled, but
with very thick water. Fortunate, however, there was no occasion
to make use of it; as one of the people, rather incautiously
strayed into the wood, and met with a deep hole containing some
very good water, and with this they completed their stock.</p>
<p>While they were making up the sails, which had been loosed in
the morning to dry, three natives appeared on the beach, a little
distance from the vessel, unarmed as before. Bong-ree went to
them in his usual manner, but they would not suffer Lieut.
Flinders, or indeed any of the party to come near them, without
previously laying down their guns. Yarn caps, pork, and biscuit,
were given them, all of which they took, with apparent delight,
and made signs for Bong-ree to go with them, that they might give
him girdles and fillets, for his head and arms. While their
visitors were only two, the natives seemed lively, dancing and
singing; but, the number of white men increasing to eight, they
became alarmed and seeming to look with a jealous eye on the shot
belt Lieut. Flinders wore, which they undoubtedly must have
thought to be some weapon.</p>
<p>To restore their confidence, he gave it one of the people to
carry away; but this he thought wrong, as it might tend to make
them suspicious of every thing they saw, and thus destroy their
friendly intercourse. By this belt they certainly recognised
Lieut. Flinders as the person who fired on them before, and were
evidently desirous that he should keep at a much greater distance
than any other person. Three of the sailors, who were Scotch,
attempted to dance a reel, but made a very bad business of it,
which the natives seemed to view either without amusement or
curiosity. Finding at length they could not persuade the natives
to visit the sloop, they parted with them in a very friendly
manner.</p>
<p>On Thursday the 25th, having weighed anchor, and proceeded up
the river in the afternoon, as they might be nearer the
Glass-House peaks, as he now intended to visit them. Some parts
of the fiver, were from four to six fathoms deep; but the channel
was divided, and narrow. Coming to an anchor near that part of
the Western shore where the man and his family called to them;
and at this time they saw a fire, and heard several voices near
the same place.</p>
<p>The next morning Lieut. Flinders took the boat up a small
branch which seemed to lead towards the peaks; but afterwards,
joining the same stream, formed two very low islands, leaving the
Glass-Houses at some distance on the left hand. Between nine and
ten o'clock he left the boat, taking with him two seamen and the
native. Steering N.W. by W. through a low swampy country, till
they came to the side of a creek, the banks of which were low,
muddy, and covered with mangroves. This creek carried them by the
head of it, where the stream, passing through a rocky swamp,
permitted them to wade over it. From here they steered till they
obtained a sight of the flat-topped peak, which appeared to be
nearer than the highest Glass-House, which was that he first
meant to visit; but finding one of the mounts with sloping sides
considerably nearer, he altered his course for it; and, after
walking nine miles from the boat, reached its top.</p>
<p>The country they passed through was low and swampy, and
towards the end of their journey the way was somewhat uneven. In
those swampy parts the surface was full of holes, where the water
lodging, walking was both difficult and tiresome. The higher
places were either sandy or stoney, and in these the grass tree
or gum rush abounded.</p>
<p>The mount itself was a pile of stones. The vegetable matter
that lodged in the cavities produced a covering of long grass,
very fit for thatch: the trees on the mount were like those on
the level ground, but much taller.</p>
<p>From the summit they viewed the bay and surrounding country
which was very extensive.</p>
<p>Near the head of Pumice-Stone river was a large sheet of
water, which seemed to divide into branches, and others still
smaller falling into this below, the whole formed channels,
which, ramifying through the low country, drew off what water
might collect within the ridge of the back mountains. These
appeared to be distant between ten and twenty miles, and the
intermediate country to be as low as that just walked over.</p>
<p>From this mount, the way was over an irregular country, the
higher parts of which were sandy and stoney, the lower swampy as
before. About half way between it and the flat-topped peak, by a
stream of water they rested for the night. At seven next morning
they found themselves under the steep cliffs of the flat-topped
peak. The stone of which was of a whitish cast, close-grained and
hard, but light and though there not stratified, there were many
fissures in it. Some distance from the peak lay some pieces of a
reddish-coloured stone, and some small pieces of granite
scattered about.</p>
<p>Lieut. Flinders was surprized at not meeting with any volcanic
appearances, as the pumice-stone in the river, and the situation
of these stupendous peaks, standing upon low flat ground, led him
to form some expectations of that kind.</p>
<p>The steepness of its sides prevented any idea of reaching the
summit of the flat-topped peak, therefore he directed his course
to the river, steering S.S.E. not only to clear the head of the
creek, but the swamps; this direction took him very far inland;
and upon his altering the course lo reach the place where he had
left the boat, he had to cross a broad stream of fresh water,
which fell in lower down, and to walk near three miles to reach
the water side. He however reached the place with great
readiness, and was presented with a black swan the people in the
boat had caught, and which was at the moment ready to satisfy the
appetites of his party, who were perfectly prepared to do it
every justice.</p>
<p>The traces of men and animals were few, and rarely met with in
the upper parts during this excursion; but Lieut. Flinders found
a new species of pheasant, about the size of a magpye. The emu
was not seen, though its voice had been heard so repeatedly, as
to induce him to suppose that bird must be numerous. The inland
part of the country was higher and better than in the
neighbourhood of the salt water, but no where did he meet with
any calculated for the production of the wheat.</p>
<p>They reached the sloop in the evening of Saturday the 27th,
and as soon as the ebb tide permitted, the following morning they
got under weigh to return down the river, and as they proceeded,
there were many natives on the shore abreast of them, who seemed
anxious for them to land, dancing and singing to obtain
attention, and express their own good-will; but as they could not
effect their wishes, they followed the sloop along the banks, and
their hopes seemed to revive by the trips which the vessel made
in tacking occasionally towards the shore.</p>
<p>The intricacy of the channels proved a great impediment to
their progress, but they could not get out of the river in one
tide, so were obliged to anchor about a mile short of the
entrance: 18 swans were procured in this river.</p>
<p>Soon after anchoring, Lieut. Flinders took some of his people
with axes on shore to cut a log of the pine for the workmen at
Port Jackson to ascertain the kind and value of the wood. There
was a house and several natives near the place, with whom
Bong-ree was talking to when the tree fell, the crash and report
of which startled them, and probably assisted in giving them a
high idea of their visitors. These people were still averse to
the appearance of a musket. The worthy native. Bong-ree, made
them a present of one of his spears, and a thro wing-stick, of
which he shewed them the use, for they appeared to be wholly
ignorant of the latter, and their weapons of the former kind were
inferior to his.</p>
<p>Bad weather detained Lieut. Flinders hen two days, during
which they were occasionally visited by the natives, who came
down upon both sides of the river, and entertained them with
singing and dancing: their singing, indeed, could not be
distinctly heard, being nearly lost in the wind.</p>
<p>While lying here, Lieut. Flinders had an opportunity of
observing their manner of fishing, which was perfectly novel even
to his companion Bong-ree. The party on the East shore, near
which the vessel lay, went out every morning at day light along
the side of the river with nets on their shoulders; and the mode
in which they used them was, whichever saw a fish, by some
dextrous manoeuvre got at the back of it, and spread out his
scoop net: others prevented its escaping on either side, and in
one or other of their nets the fish was infallibly caught. With
these nets they saw them run sometimes up to their middle in
water, and they were generally successful, after fishing they
made a fire near the beach, and sat down by it to regale with
their fish, which was no sooner out of the water than on the
fire.</p>
<p>The rain clearing up on Tuesday, in the afternoon, a party
went to the Eastern shore to procure fire-wood, and comply with
the desire which the natives had expressed of seeing them land.
On approaching them, they carried their nets away to the wood,
but three of them who remained, suffered the white people to
advance without laying down their muskets, which never happened
before. They were still timorous; but on being requested by signs
to sing, they began a song in concert, which actually was musical
and pleasing, and in rather a melancholy strain. Bong-ree gave
them a song at the conclusion of theirs, which sounded barbarous;
but he was thought a poor singer in his own country.</p>
<p>These, like the natives of Port Jackson, falling to a low
pitch of their voice, recommenced their song at the octave, which
they accompanied by slow and graceful motions, their hands being
held in a supplicating posture, and the tone and manner of their
song and gestures seemed to bespeak the good will of their
auditors. Observing they were paid attention to, they each
selected one of out people, and placed his mouth close to his
ear, as if to produce a greater effect, or teach them the song,
which their silent attention might seem to express a desire to
learn. In return for the pleasure they afforded, Lieut. Flinders
gave them some worsted caps, and old blanket trowsers, with which
they were greatly gratified. Other natives soon made their
appearance, but it was some little time before they overcame
their dread of approaching those strangers with fire-arms; but,
encouraged by the three who were with them, they came up, and a
general song and dance commenced.</p>
<p>Among those who last came, three were remarkable for their
large heads; and the face of one was so very rough, that it had
much more the appearance of a baboon than of a human being. He
was covered with oil and soot; his hair matted with filth; his
visage, even compared with his fellow countrymen's was uncommonly
ferocious; and his large mouth, beset with teeth of various
filthy hues between black, white, green, and yellow, and
sometimes smile&lt; in a way which might make any one
shudder.</p>
<p>Among other friendly interchanges, the learned the names of
Lieut. Flinders and his party. Him they called "Midger Plindah",
and his brother Mr. Samuel Flinders, they named "Dam-wel". Three
of their names were Yel-yel-bah, Ye-woo, and Bo-ma-ri-go. The
resemblance of this last to Porto Rico imprinted it on Lieut.
Flinders's recollection. When these people joined the party, the
strangers were shown and their names severally told them, until
they had learnt the pronunciation. The ceremony was reciprocal,
and accorded with what Capt. Cook had said before of an
inhabitant of Endeavour river, "he introduced the strangers by
name, a ceremony which upon such occasions was never
omitted."</p>
<p>On a comparative view of the size of these people, they were
evidently lower than the English, and perhaps less in every
respect, except in the disproportionate size of the head; and
indeed this was not general. In the features of the face,
particularly in the elongation of the lower ones, in the small
calf to the leg, and the curve of the thigh, they bore a general
resemblance to the natives of Port Jackson; but there was not one
in all this group, whose countenance had so little of the savage,
or the symmetry of whose limbs expressed strength and agility, so
much as those of Bong-ree.</p>
<p>A hawk presenting himself, Lieut. Flinders thought it a fair
opportunity of shewing his new friends a specimen of the effect
of his fire-arms. He made them understand what he intended; but,
while shifting the buck-shot in the musquet for a charge of small
shot, their agitation was so great, that they seemed to be on the
point of running into the woods; however, an expedient to keep
them was contrived; the seamen placed them in a cluster behind
themselves, and in this situation they saw Lieut. Flinders
approach towards the bird and fire. Their sensations at this
moment must have been curious; for the hawk flew away, though
much hurt, as the natives noticed, for its leg was broke. This
disappointment brought to mind how ineffectual had been some
former attempts of his to impress them with an idea of the
superior power of their visitors. Bong-ree had annoyed his
auditors with the barbarous sounds, and the clumsy exhibition of
the Scotch dancers had all been viewed by them without either
wonder or gratification.</p>
<p>These people go naked, except that they wore belts round the
waist, and fillets about the head and upper parts of the arm.
These were formed of hair, twisted into yarn like threads, and
then into bandages. Indeed the inhabitants appeared to possess in
general a pointed difference from those of New South Wales,
particularly in their networks. To these may be added the bag in
which they seemed to carry their portible property, and which was
most probably of the same kind as those mentioned by Capt. Cook;
but they were seen of different sizes, and two that Lieut.
Flinders procured were very differently worked. They were shaped
somewhat like a breast plate; and worn suspended from the neck,
which led him, previous to his first interview with them, to
suppose they were some kind of defence for the more vital parts.
They were provided with nets for catching very large fish, or
animals, as the fragments of a rotten one lying on the shore were
picked up, the meshes of which were wide enough to admit the
escape of a moderate sized porpoise; and the line of which it was
made was from three quarters to an inch in circumference.</p>
<p>Lieut. Flinders thought this mode of procuring their food
would cause a characteristic difference between the manners and
dispositions of these people, and of those who mostly depend upon
the spear or fiz-gig for a supply. In the one case, there must
necessarily be a mutual operation of two or more, who would from
necessity associate together. Those which had been met with in
Shoal Bay and Glass-House Bay were far superior to any that had
been seen in the neighbourhood of Port Jackson; this superiority
Lieut. Flinders attributed to the different mode of procuring
fish which had been adopted by the inhabitants. He likewise
supposed that the use of nets, and consequently whatever resulted
from such use, arose from the form of the bay, which being shoal
for a considerable distance from the shores, gave the greatest
advantage to nets, over every other method, more especially the
setting and scoop nets. Pumice-Stone river being full of shoals,
required the same manner of fishing; and it was observed that
most if not all the islands in the bay were surrounded by
intensive shoals, which, by extending the necessity, would assist
in bringing nets into general use.</p>
<p>At one time they saw nearly twenty natives engaged in fishing
on one flat, the greater part of whom were employed in driving
fish into a net which was held by their companions. That they
were so engaged, they convinced our people by one of the party
holding up a fish to them while he was standing in the water.</p>
<p>During the time the sloop was in Glass-House Bay, they
scarcely saw any of the women.</p>
<p>Of their canoes little could be said; for the only one they
could examine was on the East side of Pumice-Stone river. This
was formed of the stringy bark, and was much larger than any used
at Port Jackson. The ends of it were tied up in the same manner,
but it was very clumsy. None of the natives ever attempted to
approach the sloop in canoes, though eight or ten were seen
standing together, who appeared very desirous of having a
communication with it.</p>
<p>On the day the sloop was laid ashore in the river, the rise of
the tide was but three feet and nine inches. The tides were then
neaped, and the remark made by Capt. Cook, that "they had only
one high tide in twenty-four hours" seemed to apply in this bay;
for, although the sloop was got up as high as the strength of the
crew would admit, yet she righted a full hour and an half before
the night tide had done flowing, and shortly after one man haled
her off. The superior rise of the night tide was well known, and
of course proper advantage was taken of it, at Port Jackson; the
tide also rose the highest at Western Port, round the Southern
promontory of New South Wales. The time of high-water in the
river preceded the moon's passage over the meridian by two hours
and a half.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the 31st having a moderate breeze at S. by W.
with fine weather, they got under weigh and beat out of the
river. Having passed fifteen days in Glass-House Bay, Lieut.
Flinders was enabled to form a complete judgment of it. And found
it so full of shoals, that he could not point out any passage
that would lead a ship into it without danger.</p>
<p>Lieut. Flinders named the land on which Cape Moreton stood,
Moreton Island, supposing that which Capt. Cook would have, given
it, had he known its form. It appeared a strip of land the
greatest extent East and West of which was not more than five
miles; but its North and South extent Was about twenty-two miles.
The ridge of land which ran along the middle of the island was
nearly of the same height with the Cape; and though it appeared
to be composed of piles of sand heaped together upon a base
mostly of stone, it was interspersed with small trees calculated
to mislead a distant observer, who would most probably think that
some spots of it could not be classed among the most barren parts
of the universe.</p>
<p>Passing out of the bay they saw a turtle lying asleep on the
water, whence it became very probable, that taking these animals
formed part of the labours of the inhabitants, and well indeed
would it be if many of those who pride themselves on the high
state of civilization, equally-well employed their time.</p>
<p>In his passage to Hervey's Bay, the next place of destination
Lieut. Flinders was only two days; passing the Wide Bay of Capt.
Cook on the 1st, and Sandy Cape on the 2d of August; the
Southerly wind of the day veering round in the evening to the
Eastward compelled him during the night to keep some distance
from some land; but returning in the morning, he found Captain
Cook's description of the coast applied exceedingly well.</p>
<p>During this run he passed one of those spotted flat-tailed
snakes first noticed by Captain Cook in this latitude, and which
appeared to be of the kind observed by Captain Dampier on the
North West coast of New Holland.</p>
<p>In this bay Lieut Flinders remained till the 7th, during which
time he had sailed round the interior without being able to enter
any opening that might take him to a river. It was deep and
extensive, the soundings in it irregular, and in several places
he was prevented by breakers from approaching nearer the
shore.</p>
<p>Hauling up for an opening which, he wished to examine, he came
to a sandy inlet, laying at the mouth of it. Being unable to find
a passage into the opening with the sloop, he came to an anchor
and went ashore on this island which was surrounded with shoal
water. The base of which he found to be a hard stone, over which
was a covering of sand, mixed with coral and shells. There was a
cluster of palms on it, and other small trees; a few large trees
were lying on the shore, thrown clown by the wind or flood,
assisted by the weight of the trees themselves, which the depth
of soil was not able to support. Being about half ebb, the shoal
was dry, on which, were some thousand curlews and gulls, and some
pelicans; but all too shy to allow of his approach within musquet
shot. On one of the trees was stuck the cap of a small whale's
scull, and in one of the sockets, of the eyes a bird's nest,
apparently of the last, season was discovered.</p>
<p>This islet must certainly have been visited by natives; for
they found three spears, and near them was hidden a small shield,
of the same form and substance as those seen near Pumice-Stone
river. The spears were of solid wood, of twelve feet in length,
and could not have been used with a throwing stick. One of them
was barbed with a small piece of bone.</p>
<p>The forms of the shores about this harbour, apparently
dividing it into two bays, an upper and lower; and the shore on
the East side of the upper bay being high and bounded by steep
cliffs Lieut. Flinders was induced to think a deep channel
existed there, as the sheet of water extended six or seven miles
square.</p>
<p>With the intention of accomplishing an Eastern passage to this
upper bay, he returned on board from his visit to Curlew islet,
and got the sloop under weigh; but was obliged to give up the
idea, finding the shoal water so extensive as to make it probable
it joined a line of breakers; and the sun being near the horizon,
to get clear of the shoal water before dark, became a principal
concern; these induced him to shape his course for an hummock on
the West side of the bay.</p>
<p>The soundings deepened gradually to six fathoms; but, shoaling
again to three and even two fathoms, Lieut. Flinders suspected
the flood tide might set the vessel to the Southward towards the
shore; this however, was not the case, for at day light next
morning her situation was that expected, the sloping hummock
bearing W.5&deg;N. and their distance off shore about two
miles.</p>
<p>Keeping along the shore till nine o'clock, the water shoaled
to nine feet, and obliged them to haul off to the N.E. Being now
to the Northward of where Capt. Cook had laid down the coast
line, and the land being visible at W.10&deg;N. and as far as
N.W. from the mast head, he did not judge it necessary to pursue
the search any longer under the supposition of there being a
double bay, and therefore continued his course for the extreme of
the sloping hummock called Break Sea Spit.</p>
<p>Round Hervey's Bay the coast was in general, low near the
shore, and on the West side it extended to some distance inland.
On that side the land wore a different appearance from that of
Sandy Cape, there being few marks of sand, and the shore very
rocky. Proceeding toward the head, the beaches presented
themselves, and continued with little interruption into the upper
bay. A large island lying off the entrance to the upper bay
shewed no marks of sand, but was well covered with both wood and
verdure. In height, it was equal to the high parts of the main,
and being four or five miles in length, seemed to be a fire
island. On the Eastern shore the sand was more or less apparent
every where, increasing in quantity towards the Cape. The white
cliffs that were noticed before contained chalk; the upper
stratum, two or three feet in thickness, having a superior
whiteness in those which were best seen.</p>
<p>With respect to fertility, the general aspect only can be
spoken of. About the head of the bay, the trees were of a fair
growth; grass seemed sufficiently abundant, there were few
appearances of sand, and some parts of it were stony.</p>
<p>Respecting the inhabitants he had only time to observe, that
their smokes were numerous about the bay, and that they at times
frequented Curlew islet.</p>
<p>Of the animal, vegetable, or fossil productions of the bay, he
could speak still less, the shortness of his stay permitting no
examination.</p>
<p>From the appearance of the tide the day he landed on the
islet, it was high water between twelve and one o'clock, which
was three or four hours before the moon came on the meridian.</p>
<p>Having cleared the point of Break Sea Spit, on Thursday the
8th he proceeded on his return to Port Jackson. Passing the Mind
between Smoky Cape and Solitary Isles in the day which had been
before passed in the night, he observed it seemed to be higher
than most parts of its coast, Mount Warning excepted; and even
there it was not so high near shore. The view that he had of the
land at sunset, when Smoky Cape bore S.25&deg;W. distant fire or
six leagues, induced Lieut. Flinders to imagine it probable that
there might be an opening to the Northward.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of Sunday the 18th, there being little wind,
and the weather fine, they were attended by several spermaceti
whales. They were not more than twice the sloop's length from
her, coming up on either side at times very near her; and
remained playing about for more than two hours.</p>
<p>Their appearance was followed in the evening by a gale from
the S.W. which reduced them to their storm sails, and compelled
them to keep off and on during the night The wind, however,
lowering the next day, and a Southerly current having been in
their favour, Lieut. Flinders concluded his labours at dusk in
the evening of the 20th; at which time he secured hid little
vessel along side his Majesty's ship the Reliance in Port
Jackson.</p>
<p>The observations which were made by Lieut. Flinders on the set
of the current at different parts of the coast, being directly
opposite to the remarks of Capt. Cook, it will only be doing
justice to his great merit to state them. That great and able
seaman, Capt. Cook, says, in his notice of the current on tins
coast, "that it always ran with more force in shore than in the
offing." Now in going to the Northward the Norfolk was kept as
near in shore as circumstances would permit; but the whole sum of
Southing produced in eight days, was 65 miles, almost the whole
of which they lost off the Three Brothers and Smoky Cape. To
counteract this, they had twenty-five miles of Northing, reducing
the current to thirty miles in eight days, which could indeed
hardly be called a current.</p>
<p>On the contrary, their average distance from shore when
returning, was about twelve leagues off the land; and in running
the same difference of latitude in twelve days the sum of the
Southing was two hundred and eleven miles, and the Northing but
one mile and a half. Out of this, thirty-four miles were gained
in one day when their distance from shore was the greatest.</p>
<p>From this it appears, the current was strongest at the
distance of five, and from thence to twenty or more leagues; and
within that there was some set to the Northward. But Lieut.
Flinders thought the Southerly current would prevail nearer to
projecting points, at the times its strength was greatest, for in
that respect it had been found to vary much.</p>
<p>Respecting the tides it was scarce necessary to say any thing;
for, by a comparison of the times of high water at Bustard Bay
and Port Jackson, it seemed the flood came from the Southward,
and would therefore produce little or no set along the coast,
either way, in the greatest part of that space. From Break Sea
Spit, the coast trends to the Westward of North, which has a
tendency to draw the flood from the S.E. and this was shown by
Capt. Cook to be the case. Thus concluded the arduous voyage of
Lieut. Flinders, whose great skill in exploring unknown coasts
and harbours, has so evidently manifested itself in this
excursion, promises fair to place him high in the list of British
circum-navigators.</p>
<p>[The following inserted into 2nd Edition]</p>
<blockquote>[To add to the interest of this part of the
narrative, we have here some particulars to introduce relative to
the unfortunate Trench navigator La Perouse, who sailed from
Brest in 1785, and who, as well as Lieut. Flinders, visited Van
Diemen's Land.<br>
<br>
An officer of the name of Edwards, belonging to the 8th regiment
of light dragoons, which has been long on service in India, was
proceeding to New South Wales in the <i>Venus</i>, in 1808, for
the benefit of his health. When the vessel was off Van Diemen's
Land, Lieutenant Edwards and some others landed for the purpose
of amusing themselves, and seeing a little of the country. After
walking about for sometime, some of the company perceived an
inscription cut in the bark of a tree, the characters of which
were nearly obliterated or filled up; the date, however, was
legible, which, by a singular coincidence, proved to have been
inscribed exactly that very day seventeen years. As the whole of
the inscription, from the circumstances we have stated, could not
be deciphered, the company returned on hoard, giving up all idea
of further research. The extraordinary discovery having made a
deeper impression on Mr. Edwards than it did on his
fellow-passengers, he determined to make another attempt to
decipher the inscription; for which purpose he went on shore the
next morning, accompanied by some persons to whom he had imparted
a portion of his Zealand curiosity. Their first proceeding was to
clear away the bark from the tree, by which means they found that
the impression on the body of the tree was so strong as to be
legible. They ascertained from it that something of consequence
was buried at the root of the tree.<br>
<br>
Mr. Edwards immediately set to work with an iron instrument they
had brought on shore, and, after digging for a short time, it
came in contact with a glass bottle, and broke it, but
fortunately the contents were not injured. Upon examination they
were found to consist of four letters; two of which were
addressed to persons at that time filling situations in the
Government of France, and the other two to ladies. A paper also
accompanied the letters, which were carefully sealed, requesting
whoever should find them to forward them to their respective
addresses. Mr. Edwards under these circumstances, as well as in
observance of the sentiments which should animate an officer and
a gentleman, did not feel himself warranted in opening the
mysterious papers, but carried them in the state they were found
to the Governor of New South Wales, at whose disposal he was
anxious to place them. The Governor, however, considering
Lieutenant Edwards as best entitled to the merit of the
discovery, submitted to him the propriety of transmitting them
himself to the British Government. This suggestion was adopted,
and Mr. Edwards forwarded the letters unopened, with an account
of the manner in which they were discovered, by the
<i>Dromedary</i> storeship, to his father in London; who, in
conformity with his son's request, put them into the hands of the
Secretary of State for the Colonial Department.<br>
<br>
That the letters contain some information relating to the fate of
that very able and much lamented mariner Perouse is most
probable; for the latest intelligence obtained of him was not far
removed from the date of the inscription, when he was continuing
his researches in the same quarter. These letters, it is
presumed, were transmitted by our Government to France in the
same state they were received.<br>
<br>
A British officer, in confirming the above, lately made the
following remarks:<br>
<br>
"I saw <i>La Boussole</i> and <i>L'Astrolabe</i>, under the
command of Monsieur De La Perouse, enter Botany Bay, and anchor
there, on the 26th of January, 1788. On the 24th of February
following, I breakfasted and dined with the Chevalier De La
Perouse on board <i>La Boussole</i>. A few days after, three of
the French officers crossed from Botany Bay to Port Jackson,
where they dined, passed the day, and remained till next morning,
as the guests of myself and some other British marine officers.
On or about the 12th of March, 1788, La Perouse sailed from
Botany Bay; and, as <i>I believe</i>, was never after heard
of."]</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<p><small>FROM</small> contemplating a narrative, replete with
rational gratification to the mind, it is a pity to be obliged to
resume a continuance of the catalogue of crimes with which
iniquity seems ever ready to afford a super-abundance of
materials.</p>
<p>The criminal courts being assembled on the 29th of August, one
man, Job Williams, was convicted of a burglary; and several
others were ordered to be transported to Norfolk Island. Williams
afterwards received a pardon, as, some favourable circumstances
were laid before the Governor.</p>
<p>Some difficulties were still placed in the way of the
Commissary in preparing his accounts to be sent home, through the
settlers, and other persons who had not come forward as directed,
to sign the vouchers of sums paid for grain or pork delivered at
the public stores, the Commissary was therefore ordered not to
pay directly in future, but to issue government notes quarterly;
when every person concerned would be obliged to attend, and give
the proper receipts for such sums paid them. This was indeed a
most valuable regulation, and some such preventive mode had been
long wanted.</p>
<p>The convicts who arrived in the Hillsborough being mostly
recovered from the disease and weakness with which they landed,
additional strength was added to the public gangs, and the
different works in hand went on with considerably more spirit
than they had for some time. In addition to the battery which,
under the direction of Lieut. Kent, had been constructed by the
seamen of the Supply on the East point of the Cove, the work on
Point Maskelyne had been completed with embrasures; and some guns
were placed in a commanding situation above the wind-mill on the
West side; and a work had been thrown up on Garden Island;
therefore, in point of defence, the settlement wore a respectable
aspect.</p>
<p>During the night of the 6th of September, the Resource, an
American ship, arrived from Rhode Island, bound to China. Having
refreshed her crew she sailed again on the 14th; but to the
injury of other Americans who might hereafter visit the
settlement, the master took several seamen away belonging to the
king's ships. To recruit their numbers, and refresh those he had
on board, were undoubtedly his motives for coming in; but such
conduct deserving a representation to the American Minister, the
Governor determined to make one.</p>
<p>On the 15th, the Buffalo sailed for the Cape of Good Hope, to
fetch cattle for the colony. The Governor wished to send a cargo
of coals by her to the Cape; but her repairs had taken up so much
time, that to load her with that article would have
procrastinated her departure too far into the season, to admit of
her return within the summer months, which was absolutely
requisite to preserve her cattle. This desirable object was
therefore declined.</p>
<p>Dispatches were sent to England by this opportunity,
containing among others, a requisition for those materials
wanting to carry into effect the manufacture of woollens and
linens, viz. a large quantity of reeds, hackles, tow, and wool
cards, a quantity of log wood, red wood, copperas, and alum.</p>
<p>Shortly after the sailing of this ship, the Governor visited
the wild cattle, for which purpose he left Paramatta the 24th of
September, crossing the Nepean river next morning further to the
Northward than before. In this direction he traversed with his
party a new tract of country, perfectly beautiful and highly
calculated for both cultivation and pasture.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Cow-pasture Plains, they met with a small herd
of cattle about 20 in number, all extremely fierce, and had not
some dogs been with the party, they would certainly have been
attacked. The natives who accompanied the Governor, were alarmed
so much, that they climbed up the trees, and left their friends
to provide for their own safety. Several of the dogs having been
set at the cattle, by some of the party, who did it, not thinking
their situation perfectly safe, the animals dismayed at this
unusual appearance went off with great expedition, all but a bull
calf, which the dogs detained: the Governor however, directed him
to be freed, on which a curious circumstance occurred. Three
horses being with the party, the calf stuck close to them,
running between their legs, and as he bellowed very loud there
was every reason to fear the flock would return, and thereby
danger the party; thus it was thought requisite to stop his cries
by shooting him which was done instantly, and they regaled with
infinite satisfaction on veal, a dish almost unknown in this
country.</p>
<p>Quitting the Cow-pasture Plains, the Governor and his party
re-crossed the river higher up, and were led four miles over a
mountainous country, and then over a level space covered with
fine grass, and very well watered.</p>
<p>On the return of the Governor and his party on the beginning
of October, they found the Eliza whaler had come in from sea,
wanting only thirty tons of oil to complete her cargo.</p>
<p>A great number of convicts and others who were the labouring
servants of Government having absconded for the purpose of living
by robbery, or escape in those ships ready to sail. An order was
issued, that those concerned might not plead ignorant of the
consequence and thus try to evade punishment, "that any officer
or man belonging to the above ships, who should be known to have
countenanced or assisted the convicts above alluded to in making
their escape would be taken out of the ship, and punished with
the utmost severity of the law; and as the most strict and
scrupulous search would take take place on board, for every
convict which should be found concealed, or suffered to remain on
board without regular permission, so many of the ship's company
should be taken out and detained for daring to encourage such
escape. Such of the above public servants as might have taken to
concealments on shore for the purpose of avoiding their work, or
making their escape from the colony, if they did not return
within a week to their respective stations, might, upon
discovery, expect the most exemplary punishment; but they would
be pardoned for the present attempt if they returned
immediately."</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the Governor had found it requisite to publish
this particularly strict order, the very day it appeared, on
searching the Hillsborough then moving out of the Cove, several
convicts were secreted on board, these however, were brought on
shore, and all except one received severe corporal punishment.
That one was forgiven on declaring who were the people that
encouraged their concealment, and prepared hiding places for
them. This he did and it proved to be two of the seamen, who were
also directly brought on shore, punished and then drummed to the
wharf, and returned to the ship from whence they came. The little
effect of good orders, regulations, and punishments, were again
fully shewn, and still more strongly confirmed by the following
circumstance:</p>
<p>The Spanish ship a prize to the whalers had been bought by Mr.
Hingston, late master of the Hillsborough, and two free men of
the settlement, she had been named the Hunter, and was about
making a voyage to Bengal, for the purpose of freighting back
with goods for the colony. A female named Ann Holmes being found
missing, while the Hunter was going out of the harbour, the
Governor directed an armed boat to follow the ship, with
constables to search her; and ordered if any persons were found
on hoard without permission, to bring the ship again into port.
Having found the woman, the ship was accordingly brought up the
harbour and properly secured.</p>
<p>Many of her crew conducted themselves in an insolent and
mutinous manner to an officer sent from the Reliance, having
armed against the constables, and one of them presented a musquet
at a chief constable, they were now secured, and ordered to be
punished on board their own ship, after which they were turned on
shore. But as the Governor thought something more than this
requisite to be done; a criminal court assembled and the master
of the ship was tried, charged with aiding a female convict to
escape. The offence consisting of aiding a <i>convict</i>, thus
it became requisite to prove the person found in his ship was a
convict; but on referring to a list of the prisoners who arrived
in the Royal Admiral, which ship Ann Holmes had been sent out in,
to New South Wales, no term of transportation was found against
her name. So the master was acquitted, it not being possible to
prove that Holmes was then a convict. But the master was highly
reprehensible for concealing any person in his ship, and must
undoubtedly have felt himself in an awkward situation, in being
brought before a court for the breach of an order issued but a
short time to guard him and others against the very offence he
had committed.</p>
<p>The Hillsborough, when searched, had no less than thirty
convicts on board, against the orders, but these were without the
knowledge of the officers, being secreted by the seamen. Soon
after these transactions, both ships sailed on their voyages.</p>
<p>Though by the measures adopted, it was supposed none had
escaped in the ships, yet many were still known to be in the
woods. On the 15th a young ox was missed from the stock-yard at
Toongabbe; with the hope of discovering the offenders, a notice
was issued, holding out a conditional emancipation, and
permission to become a settler, to any convict for life, who
would come forward with the information necessary to convict the
persons concerned; and an absolute emancipation, with permission
to quit the colony, to any one transported only for a limited
time; but nothing ever transpired that could lead to a
discovery.</p>
<p>Wheat at this time getting low in the stores rendered it
necessary to deduct two pounds from the twelve which were issued,
an addition was made to the allowance of salt meat, eight pounds
and a half of beef being issued instead of five, and five pounds
of pork in the room of three. This was to continue until the new
crops were gathered which wore at present a promising appearance,
and the various misfortunes which had attended the exertions of
the industrious, being, it was hoped at an end, the governor
thought it to be his duty to fall to the original prices of
grain, and of course directed the following should be given in
future:</p>

<p>to commence on the 1st of January, 1800.</p>
<p>The Reliance sailed on the 2d of November, with a party of
military to relieve those on duty at Norfolk Island; and the next
day the ship Walker arrived from England, on board of which were
Lieut. Colonel Paterson, and Capt Abbot, of the New South Wales
corps.</p>
<p>The dispatches the Governor now received, directed a register
to be kept of all ships entering in and clearing out of the
harbour, in consequence of which he appointed Richard Atkins,
Esq. the Judge-Advocate, to that service; and it now became an
article in the port orders delivered to the masters of ships on
their arrival, "that they were not upon any account to break
bulk, or attempt to land any article whatever, until such time as
an account of the ship, her commander, cargo, &amp;c. had been
laid before the Governor." It was at the same time ordered that
no boat, or indeed any person, except the pilot and officer, sent
by the Governor, and the person to fill up the register, should
ever board a ship, entering the port, till the information
required had been fully obtained.</p>
<p>The ordnance of the colony was increased on the arrival of the
Walker by four iron twelve pounders, and intelligence was brought
that copper coin, to the amount of 5501. was put on board the
Porpoise, and might be daily expected. Money would in its
circulation most certainly be attended with the greatest utility
to all the inhabitants of the colony in their several dealings;
and to prevent its being taken out of the colony it might be
marked. If by the introduction of the coin, the lamentable and
nearly never to be forgiven crime of forgery, mould be avoided,
it would indeed be an event devoutly to be wished; but in all
human probability, this crime, if expelled, would only introduce
the more general crime of manufacturing counterfeit money, for
among the many <i>ingenious</i> persons in the country it would
certainly be attempted.</p>
<p>At the same time as the Walker, the Britannia arrived from her
last cruize, having perfected her cargo of oil.</p>
<p>A general complaint being made by the inhabitants of Sydney
concerning the quality of the bread delivered to them, the
Governor ordered a meeting of officers for the investigation of
it; it appeared the bakers received the wheat as issued, and
engaged to give in return a quantity of bread; but, never having
been confined as to quality, returned loaves composed of more
chaff and bran than flour, which made the convicts very feelingly
call them "scrubbing brushes". The bakers were heard, but proper
directions were given to remove the evil, and prevent a
repetition of it.</p>
<p>Lieut. Col. Paterson had, since he arrived, introduced some
regulations in the corps of which he was sent out to take the
command. As his Majesty had augmented the pay of the
non-commissioned officers, drummers, and privates of the army,
since the 25th day of May 1797, under certain regulations with
respect to stoppages, this regiment was to receive the benefit of
three-pence halfpenny per day, to be deducted, as a payment for
the ration issued to them, and which the commissary was now
directed to serve, agreeable to the ration established by command
for such troops as were serving in Jamaica, Gibraltar, &amp;c.
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Col. Paterson was also instructed to complete the companies of
the corps, if he could obtain proper characters for the purpose,
in consequence of which notice was given, informing those free
people, who could bring with them satisfactory recommendations to
the colonel, they would be received for the regiment.</p>
<p>The great pains formerly taken, to enforce a proper attention
to the duties of religion, it might rationally have been thought,
would have had a lasting effect; but the orders and regulations
for the good government of New South Wales, like the Acts of
Parliament of the mother country, were only observed at their
first publication: again, therefore, was the Governor obliged to
call on all in authority, to exert themselves in enforcing a
proper observance of the sabbath, and they were particularly
directed to urge the women to attend divine service, for the
females had at all times thought it convenient not to imagine
themselves included in those addressed by the public orders.</p>
<p>The crops of wheat, which at this time were ready for the
reaper, wore a profitable and very promising appearance; the
stalks of that at the Hawkesbury was bending with the weight of
the corn. But in this, as in other countries, a crop could never
with safety be reckoned, until gathered into the barn. On the
16th of November fell a heavy storm of thunder, lightning, and
rain, with a shower of hail that knocked the greater part of the
fruit off the trees, and cut up the gardens in the neighbourhood
of Sydney; though at two miles from that place, it was not felt.
On the 18th of November, a gale of wind and rain visited the
Hawkesbury two days after the storm at Sydney, which beat down
much of the wheat, and greater part of the public store. This
tempestuous weather subsided for a day, and then recommenced and
continued until the 25th, when it cleared up; and, to encrease
the affliction, myriads of caterpillars were now destroying the
young maize.</p>
<p>To obtain an absolute knowledge of what was the produce of the
year's harvest, proper persons were appointed, by the Governor,
to visit every district, and to obtain from the owners an account
of what was produced on each farm.</p>
<p>The building the public gaol at Sydney was not yet completed,
although a meeting of the officers had been held to consider of
the means best to be devised for defraying the expense.</p>
<p>The Britannia whaler being now ready for sea, on the 2d of
December sailed for England, by which opportunity Mr. Raven, who
came with the Buffalo, and five of his officers took their
passage; an agreement being made with the master, to furnish them
with a passage for 250<i>l</i>. The Walker on the same day sailed
on her fishing voyage.</p>
<p>The dissatisfaction manifested by the settlers, respecting the
reduction of the price of grain which had been ordered by the
Governor to take place, induced them to complain to his
Excellency by petitions, in which they dated many hardships they
laboured under, in the hope that he would receive the crops of
this season at the higher price. Having considered the propriety
of their petitions, he wished them to recollect, that four years
since he had given notice, that the high price of grain could not
be continued longer than that season: and though he had no doubt
of their having had the losses they represented, and they must
know he had used every means he could to remove or relieve them;
yet his duty forced him to adhere to the reduction of which he
had given notice, and at the same time observed, some of the
misfortunes had proceeded from a want of attention to their own
interest; many of them having sold their last bushel for the
imprudent gratification of the moment, thus reducing their
families to distress and even nakedness.</p>
<p>At the same time he informed them, he felt much pleasure in
being able to communicate to them, that government intended to
administer every relief, by supplying the inhabitants with both
necessaries and comforts at a moderate price.</p>
<p>During the same day which the Britannia sailed, the Plumier, a
Spanish ship, anchored in the cove; which ship was a prize to
three whalers that captured her near Cape Corientes, on the coast
of Peru. Her cargo principally consisted of spirits and wine,
which being condemned by the Vice-admiralty Court as a lawful
prize, were removed to the Supply, and an order was issued, to
forbid the landing of spirits, wine, or malt liquor, till a
regular permit was obtained, which restriction was extended to
wine and malt liquor, as spirits were frequently landed as those
articles.</p>
<p>The Commissary was now enabled to issue slop-cloathing to the
convicts, as a quantity had been received by the Walker; but
unfortunately, however, much put on board arrived in a damaged
state.</p>
<p>On the 14th of December, the Martha schooner came in from Bass
Strait; she brought 1000 seal-skins and 30 barrels of oil, which
she had procured among the islands.</p>
<p>The criminal court assembled on the 16th, when two mates of
the Walker were tried for using menaces to a person for stopping
their boat when attempting to land spirits without a permit; but
as he had no authority for making a seizure, they were
acquitted.</p>
<p>One John Morris was convicted of forgery, and received
sentence of death; but his fate being determined by the majority
of one voice, this business must, as provided by the patent for
establishing the court, be referred to the King in council. It
was fortunate that such instances did not often occur; for the
unfortunate criminal must languish for many months in so dreadful
a state of uncertainty, that it is hard to say, if the thus
created punishment by suspense, even though eventually the
culprit was pardoned, did not exceed the instant punishment of
death; and if, after a lapse of time, the pendant arm of justice
inflicted the rigorous sentence of the law, the poor wretches
state, must excite the commiseration of all hearts composed of
any softer materials than iron.</p>
<p>The settlers in a body again represented their inability to
bear a reduction in the price of wheat this season, not only in
consequence of their former losses, but of the very high price of
those necessaries of life requisite for paying their labourers:
thus the Governor consented to receive the wheat only at the
former price of 10s. per bushel, and they were then told the
reduction would certainly take place the next season. His
Excellency also allowed a quantity of wine and spirits to be
landed, for the accommodation of those who had crops to secure,
and thus prevent the impositions they must be subject to in
procuring them from a petty dealer.</p>
<p>The Reliance and Francis returned on the 24th from Norfolk
Island, with the relief of the military.</p>
<p>Before the morning of the 25th, the log gaol at Paramatta was
set on fire, and shortly consumed. The prisoners confined there
were with difficulty saved from the flames, and so scorched that
one died in a few days.</p>
<p>The rewards formerly thought proper to be held out on other
occasions, were offered to any one, who would give evidence to
convict the incendiaries; and the inhabitants were again called
on by that duty each owed to society, as well as by his own
interest, to use every means to discover the perpetrators of such
diabolical mischief, which in its extent, involved the lives of
many, and the properties of every one.</p>
<p>It is by no means wonderful, that in a country inhabited by
convicts there should be an antipathy to a gaol, so strong as to
end in the destruction of those, composed of combustible
materials, and though it might be thought, the criminals on the
outside, would have had a little pity for those on the in, that
was not found the case either at the burning the prison formerly
or now, which shews too plainly the real state of depravity to
which human nature can reach.</p>
<p>The harvest now beginning, constables were sent to the
Hawkesbury to secure every vagrant they could meet with and bring
them to Sydney, if they did not choose to work, as the settlers
were willing to pay them a dollar per day, and give them their
provisions; at this time there were many persons in that
district, calling themselves free people, who refused to do any
kind of labour unless paid the most exorbitant wages.</p>
<p>This evil indeed reigns too universally in all countries, for
from this cause the farmer is evidently forced to charge more for
his grain; thus the encrease of price rises still higher, till at
length the very labourer, who is the first grand cause, complains
of the price of that bread he needs for himself or family.</p>
<p>The following statement of the live-stock and ground in
cultivation in New South Wales at this period, is highly
satisfactory: viz.</p>
<p align="center">LIVE-STOCK.</p>
<p><small>39 Horses, 72 Mares, 188 Bulls and Oxen, 512 Cows, 3189
Hogs, 4721 Sheep, and 2583 Goats.</small></p>
<p align="center">LAND IN CULTIVATION.</p>
<p><small>5465 Acres of Wheat, 2302 of Maize, 82 of Barley, and
only 8 of Oats.</small></p>
<p>Thus it appears there was a great encrease of live-stock,
except of horses. And a considerable addition had been made to
the ground in cultivation.</p>

<p>That the encrease of live-stock and land in cultivation,
should have for its growing accompaniment an encrease of crimes,
can only be viewed with regret, and it is much to be lamented,
that abilities so great, as those possessed by every officer in
the settlement, had not more worthy subjects of his Majesty's to
govern, and thus have them shewn to still greater advantage.</p>
<p>On the 3d of January, 1800, the Swallow, East-India packet,
arrived on her voyage to China. She on anchoring saluted the
fort, which was of course returned.</p>
<p>She had a variety of articles for sale, intended for the China
market; but the master found it worth his while to display to the
female inhabitants here various elegant articles of dress.</p>
<p>On the 11th the Minerva transport arrived from Ireland, with
162 male and 26 female convicts from that kingdom, all in perfect
health, their treatment doing the highest credit to the master,
the surgeon, and officers; only three had died during the
passage. She was chartered for Bengal; and, as the season was
early for her proceeding on that voyage, the Governor wishing to
divide this description of people, would have sent her with them
to Norfolk Island; but as no provision had been made for her
proceeding to that place under the original charter-party, he did
not think proper to give what the master demanded. And having
been informed that another ship, the Friendship, had sailed from
Ireland, he resolved to land the convicts and to avoid imposition
wait her arrival.</p>
<p>As the Minerva had touched at Rio de Janeiro, she brought many
articles for sale, from that port as well as from England, most
of which were seriously wanted, but the prices were so immoderate
as to drain all the money that could be procured.</p>
<p>The arrival of the Minerva, was accompanied with that of the
Thynne, a snow from Bengal under Danish colours, chartered by the
officers of the colony, through an agent they sent thither on
purpose. She was laden on their account with articles they were
much in want of.</p>
<p>The 18th a convict attempted to go alongside the Minerva, and
still persisting, though repeatedly warned to keep off, was shot
by the centinel, agreeable to his orders, and though tried was of
course acquitted.</p>
<p>The natives having murdered two men who had farms at the
Hawkesbury, a few of the settlers in the neighbourhood determined
like the native savages of the country to revenge their death by
retaliation. There were three native boys living with a settler
named Powell, and two others. These innocent and unoffending lads
selected as the object of their revenge by these white savages.
Having told them, they thought they could find the guns of the
white men, they were sent for that purpose, and soon brought them
in. Powell and his companions now began to execute their infernal
work of vengeance. For which purpose they drove them into a barn,
and after tying their hands behind them, the cowardly miscreants
stabbed them, till two died beneath their hands. The third made
his escape, by jumping into the river, and though to assist him
in swimming he could only make use of his feet, yet with this
disadvantage, and the savage murderers of his companions firing
constantly at him, he reached the opposite bank alive, and soon
joined his own far more innocent people.</p>
<p>The governor, on being informed of this circumstance, with his
usual goodness sent directly to the place, where the bodies of
these poor victims were found buried in a garden, stabbed in
several places, and their hands tied as described. Powell and the
other murderers were taken into custody, and a court being
assembled, they were tried for the wilful murder of the two
native boys.</p>
<p>The evidence produced to the court perfectly established that
the deceased had died by means of the prisoners; and the members
of the court were unanimously of opinion that they were
"<i>guilty of killing two natives</i>"; but instead of passing a
sentence of death, a special reference was made to his Majesty's
Minister, and the prisoners were admitted to bail.</p>
<p>By way of a defence the prisoners brought forward a cloud of
witnesses to prove a number of white people had been killed by
the natives; but most undoubtedly could these people have been
properly understood, proofs had not been wanting, of the wanton
and brutal manner in which by far too many of them had been
expelled existence.</p>
<p>Doubts arising as to the light the natives were to be held,
the court applied to the Governor for information, when he sent
the court the orders from time to time given respecting them, and
a copy of an article in his "Majesty's instructions to the
Governor", which in very strong terms places them under the
protection of the British government, and directs, that "if any
of his subjects should wantonly destroy them, or give them
unnecessary interruption in the exercise of their several
occupations, they are to be brought to punishment according to
the degree and nature of their offence."</p>
<p>But as in this instance, the court were divided in their
sentiments, the whole business, with their doubts, was agreed to
be submitted to his Majesty's Minister. Notwithstanding it was
impossible to explain to the natives, or make them comprehend the
nature of these doubts, it was naturally to be expected they
would ill brook the return of the prisoners to their farms
without receiving some punishment: an event wholly opposite to
their ideas and customs; in fact they threatened most violently
to burn the crops the first opportunity. In the hands of a body
of justly irritated and hostile natives, fire might, with little
trouble to them, ruin every prospect of the most abundant
harvest; and by this threat, it appeared evident they were not
ignorant of the power they possessed, thus it was essential to
the comfort, security, and indeed existence of the settlers in
particular, that they should live with them at least on amicable
terms, On the 21st the Swallow sailed on her voyage to China.</p>
<p>On the 25th of this month, the Walker whaler came in, not
having met with any success. She had spoke the Albion, which had
unfortunately been equally unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The gaol at Sydney still wanting much of being compleated from
the smalness of the sums raised to carry it on; and as it
appeared that the officers had paid forty pounds each as an
individual share of the expense, it became requisite that some
means should be adopted to finish the building; and, as the price
of wheat had, at the urgent request of the settlers, been for
this season continued at ten shillings per bushel, it was thought
proper to raise a sum for the purpose, by each leaving with the
commissary sixpence, for every bushel of wheat taken to the
store. This would undoubtedly be the least felt, and was intended
to cease when a sum sufficient was collected.</p>
<p>There being now only five months' provision in the store at a
full allowance, it was deemed necessary to issue only two thirds
of the regular ration; and this deduction was to commence on the
first of February. A small addition was made to that already in
store, by seventy casks of salt provisions the master of the
Minerva had for sale.</p>
<p>The Francis and the Norfolk brought round each a cargo of
timber and plank for a vessel building at Sydney, and other
purposes.</p>
<p>On the first of February the alteration in the ration took
place. Col. Paterson brought out with him an arrangement of the
military ration, which, as directed by his Majesty's regulation,
consisted of the following daily allowance for each man:</p>

</table>
<p>When the rice and pease could not be issued, 1&frac12; lb. of
bread or flour, and 1&frac12; lb. of beef, or 10 oz. of pork,
make a complete ration. The quantity of salt provisions at this
time in store, not being able to suffer an exemption of the
regiment from a reduction, they were informed that, till the
store could afford to victual them agreeable to that regulation,
they would receive the same as the civil department; but that no
stoppages from their pay would take place on that account.</p>
<p>One of these people a well-disposed young man, fell a victim
to an attachment he had formed with a most infamous woman; who,
after plundering him of every thing he possessed, turned him out
of her house, to make room for another. This treatment, though
only what he might rationally have expected, he could not
survive; and, placing the muzzle of his gun under his chin, drew
the trigger with his foot, and, the contents going through his
neck, he instantly expired. It is a melancholy fact that from
similar causes, may be deduced the arrival of at least one half
of the male convicts, which shews the high importance of young
men avoiding those connections so repleat with evil.</p>
<p>The Betsey whaler arrived on the 13th, from the West coast of
America with 350 barrels of oil. She was very leaky, and wanted
much repair. At the same time the Hunter bark came from Calcutta,
with a cargo on speculation; and the next day a Spanish brig
captured by the whalers.</p>
<p>On the 16th arrived the Friendship transport from Ireland with
convicts: last from the Cape of Good Hope, where the Buffalo was
embarking cattle for the settlement. The convicts arrived in very
good health, though they had been rather sickly previous to her
reaching the Cape.</p>
<p>The generality of the convicts sent by this ship and the
Minerva were but ill calculated to be of any advantage to the
settlement, as little addition could be made by them to the
strength of the labouring gangs. Many of them were bred up in
genteel habits, and others to light professions, and of course
unaccustomed to hard labour. These must become a drain on the
store; for, notwithstanding the detestation for the crimes many
of them were transported for, yet it was not possible for the
Governor, consistent with his well-known feeling humanity, to
send a Physician, the once Sheriff of a county, a Catholic
priest, or a Protestant clergyman and family, to the brick-carts,
brick-fields, grubbing hoe, or the timber carriage. The lower
classes of convicts in these cargos were mostly old men, fit only
for hut-keepers to remain at home and prevent robbery, while the
other inhabitants of the hut were at labour: thus making good the
old proverb, "set a thief to catch a thief".</p>
<p>A quantity of clothing being received by these ships, and as
no bedding had been sent, the Governor bought a thousand bad
rugs, manufactured in some of the Spanish settlements on the
coast of America, and were on board the last prize. One of these,
with a complete suit of clothing, were issued to each of the
convicts.</p>
<p>Many of the settlers declining to come forward and assist with
the small assessment of sixpence per bushel on wheat, which was
intended to be taken toward the completion of the gaol, it was
now thought requisite to adopt some other measure; and, as any
article of luxury was conceived to be a fitter subject than any
other for taxation, an order was issued, directing, that "on a
permit being applied for to land spirits, wine, beer, or other
strong drink from ships having those articles for sale", the
person wishing for it must make application to the gentlemen of
the committee appointed to carry on the building of the gaol, and
security was to be given them for the payment of 1s. per gallon
on the purchase of spirits, 6d. per gallon on the purchase of
wine, and 3d. per gallon on the purchase of porter or strong
beer: these sums, should the permits be granted, which rested on
the character of the person, were to be paid to the committee,
and appropriated to the above purpose.</p>
<p>Since the last arrivals from Ireland, a number of suspicious
persons were continually strolling about Sydney at all hours of
the night, several boats had been taken away, and property to a
serious amount stolen out of houses; in order to put a stop to
these practices, the centinels were directed not to suffer any
person, the civil and military officers of the settlement
excepted, to pass after ten o'clock at night, without giving the
counter-sign; on failure of which the centinel was to detain them
until the relief came round; when, if the corporal should not be
satisfied with the account they gave, they were to be taken to
the guard-house, and detained till enlarged by the magistrates.
In addition to this, the constables were directed to be strict in
their rounds, and apprehend all improper or suspicious persons
they might meet in the town during the night.</p>
<p>In a few days after the issuing this order, several of the
Irish prisoners assembled at a house, and making more noise than
proper during the night, were taken up, and lodged in the gaol
till the morning; when they were set at liberty with strong
assurances of being punished if again taken up.</p>
<p>A new powder magazine was now began, the former being at too
great a distance from the principal battery, and in a dangerously
insecure situation. The foundation of the new one was dug in a
better spot, and where it could be properly secured; which
precaution was rendered necessary by the turbulent conduct of
those convicts from Ireland.</p>
<p>The Reliance being so worn out, as to be no longer capable of
doing any service to the colony it became necessary to give her
those repairs which would enable her to reach England. She was
therefore fitted for sea, and sailed on the 3d of March on her
homeward-bound voyage.</p>
<p>The Martha returned from the Southward on the 6th of March,
with a cargo of oil and seal skins. As the Nautilus had left some
of her people on Cape Barren Island, they informed the master of
the Martha, that the best time for seals among those islands was
from November till May.</p>
<p>Many of the Irish convicts lately arrived were now afflicted
with a dysenteric complaint, and several died.</p>
<p>It has already been seen how little good could be effected by
granting indulgence to the people of this country, and now
another instance occurred from a class of people who it could
hardly have been expected from. The settlers on the banks of
George's river had served in the marine detachment, and
afterwards in the New South Wales' corps. By entreaties prevailed
on the governor to grant them some live-stock, his Excellency
furnished each with a ewe sheep, which they were no sooner
possessed of than they sold. This reaching the Governor, lie
ordered them to be seized, and returned to the flock of
government.</p>
<p>Accounts of an alarming nature toward the latter end of the
month arrived from George's river and the Hawkesbury. The weather
had, for upwards of twenty days, been very wet, which was
unfortunate, as the maize was now ripe, the wind blew a heavy
gale, accompanied with so much rain that the river Hawkesbury,
and all the creeks, rose beyond their banks, laying the flat
country under water. The consequent damage followed the
desolation which this flood spread over the cultivated grounds,
and some lives were lost, though considering the extent of the
flood they were few.</p>
<p>The prospect of a fine maize harvest was now at an end, and
work of every kind was suspended, for the purpose of preparing
the ground for a second crop of wheat. The settlement had not yet
become so firmly established as to be enabled to withstand such a
succession of ill-fortune without some assistance from the mother
country. Had the settlers been more industrious, they must in
some degree have been prepared for accidents of this nature; and
it was to be lamented, that, when they were established on the
banks of the Hawkesbury, attention had not been paid to the
evident signs of the floods which the river appeared liable to,
had the dwellings been built on higher ground, the inundations
which had occurred could have done no injury. The late overflows
had been such as exceeded in horror and destruction every thing
that could be imagined.</p>
<p>To prepare with every expedition the ground for wheat, all
persons were called on to give assistance; and, as a number of
idle persons were wandering about the colony, who refused to
labour unless paid exorbitant wages, these were again directed to
be taken up, and, if found to prefer living by extortion or
robbery, to working at a reasonable rate, they were to be made
labour for the public.</p>
<p>The Walker went on the fishery; and the Martha snow sailed for
Norfolk Island, with some articles for sale, the property of her
owners during the latter part of this month.</p>
<p>On the first day of April, the criminal court of judicature
met for the trial of offenders. Robberies had been very frequent,
on household property as well as live-stock. Two men were
convicted of robbery, and Mary Graham of forgery. Several were
sentenced to have corporal punishment, and others were ordered to
be transported to Norfolk Island. The Governor pardoned the woman
and one of the men, leaving the other to his fate, and appointed
the day for his execution; but the officers soliciting that his
life might be spared, the Governor consented, directing that both
the prisoners, yet unacquainted with the pardon to be granted
them, should be taken to the place of execution with their
coffins, and every appearance observed that could give solemnity
to the scene, and impress on the minds of the spectators a proper
awe. These directions being complied with, and the ropes put
about their necks, the provost marshal produced the pardon and
read it. One appeared much affected; but the other declared that
he was never in his life so well prepared, and indeed he seemed
hardly to desire a procrastination of death.</p>
<p>On the 14th the Hunter sailed for Norfolk Island, and on the
16th the Speedy whaler arrived from England, with fifty female
convicts; and eight hundred and thirty-two casks of salt
provisions, which enabled the Governor again to issue a full
ration.</p>
<p>In this ship arrived Capt. Philip Gidley King, the
lieutenant-governor of Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>In the evening of the same day, the Buffalo arrived from the
Cape of Good Hope, having on board eighty-five cows and twenty
breeding mares. This voyage was performed in seven months, the
Buffalo having sailed from Port Jackson on the 15th of last
September. She made her passage there in three months, arriving
in Table Bay on the 16th of December.</p>
<p>The quantity of spirits at this time in the colony occasioned
much intoxication and irregularity. The settlers at the
Hawkesbury lost to their own interest neglected sowing their
grounds: a circumstance which, but for the interference of the
Governor, would have ended in their ruin. On hearing their
situation, he forbade the sending more spirits to that profligate
district of the colony, as well as the retailing what had been
already sent, under pain of the offenders being prosecuted for
disobedience of orders.</p>
<p>The Governor in the beginning of May received information from
the officers, that they had some grounds for suspecting, that the
convicts from Ireland had brought with them the principles which
occasioned their being sent from that kingdom, and were holding
seditious correspondences, and unlawful meetings; to discover
whether there was any foundation for this, he called in the
assistance of Lieut. Governor King, Colonel Paterson, Major
Foveaux, and the magistrates; when it was determined to make a
general search among the persons suspected in all parts of the
colony at the same time, and to secure, and seal up their
papers.</p>
<p>This examination took place on the 15th; but nothing was
discovered that could furnish the smallest evidence of the
imputed crimes.</p>
<p>The next day a convict, who had with great earnestness
propagated a report that many pikes had been secretly made, and,
to prevent detection, they had been sunk in a well-known part of
the harbour; this fellow on being examined by the magistrates,
confessed he knew nothing of what he had asserted, and said he
was intoxicated at the time. For this he was severely punished,
and it was doubtful if he had not chose to suffer rather than
make known his confederates: thus perhaps imagined he proved his
innocence to his accusers, and his truth to his rebel
companions.</p>
<p>The secresy with which this business was conducted prevented
the magistrates from making any discovery, and of course they
succeeded in no degree on an examination of Harold, the
before-mentioned Catholic priest, as being a party in seditious
conversations; for nothing appeared to criminate him, though the
fact was universally credited. The Governor judged it necessary,
in consequence of these conjectures, to extract the heads of
several acts against seditious correspondence or unlawful
assemblies of the people, and altering them so as to suit the
settlement, published them as a proclamation, that none might
plead ignorance of the existence of such laws. This beside being
made public in the usual manner, was read on Sunday the 24th, in
church, after the performance of divine service.</p>
<p>The Friendship having sailed early in the month for Bengal,
that opportunity was taken of sending dispatches to England, and
to the Governor of India; who, by the Hunter, had sent a letter
to the Governor, inclosing a list of persons from New South Wales
who were then resident in Calcutta, and "desiring to be informed
whether any of them had left the territory without having
previously obtained permission for that purpose, or served the
regular term of their transportation; in which latter case it was
the intention of that government to return them to the colony by
the first opportunity." On comparing the list with the books,
there were found none of this description, and all were accounted
for, except two or three whose names did not appear on the books;
of course, if they had once been on them, their owners must now
have used others. The number of persons that appeared at Calcutta
was not more than fifteen; small however as that number was, the
fear that such worthless characters should find their way into
that government was strongly expressed. Indeed there was no
community, but would view with horror the possibility of such
persons mixing with them.</p>
<p>At the same time information transpired that some proposition
had been made, and a correspondence entered into between the
secretary of the Bengal government and the gentlemen employed as
the private agent of the officers' respecting, sending Indian
convicts to New South Wales. This was a measure, though open to
no objection, it must of course be submitted to government before
adopted, so the correspondence which had passed on this occasion
was sent home. The proposition made by the government of Bengal
was to victual and maintain their convicts for one year after
landing; when they were to be supported by the settlement. As a
description of people like these might be most usefully employed,
and would be probably more manageable than those convicts from
England and Ireland, it was hoped the plan might meet with
approbation.</p>
<p>As many favourable ideas of the settlement had reached India;
by the same conveyance three persons of respectability wrote to
the Governor, stating their desire of embarking their families
and property, and becoming settlers; but requiring a ship to be
sent for the purpose of fetching them, and on their arrival to be
granted the services of a certain number of convicts for some
space of time, and a quantity of live-stock at the expense of the
crown, his excellency knowing well the advantages the colony must
derive from such persons residing in the country resolved on
taking the first opportunity to send their proposals to
England.</p>
<p>To depress the encouragement given to the vagrants infesting
the country; it was ordered that any one wishing to travel from
one part to another, should apply for a pass, in which his
business was to be inserted; and all found without this were to
be taken before a magistrate to answer for wilful disobedience of
orders and regulations.</p>
<p>Several applications being made to get fresh pork received
into the stores, the Commissary was directed to comply with the
requests; but as there was every reason to imagine that the
compliance would be attended with the destruction of breeding and
young sows. It was ordered, that any person who should be known
to offer meat of that description, to the store, that it should
not only be refused to be received; but the owner was also to be
informed against, as being in that case no longer deserving any
encouragement or indulgence from the government he thus
offended.</p>
<p>On the 26th of May the criminal court was assembled, at which
six persons were capitally convicted, two of whom were for sheep
stealing, and ordered for execution; the others received pardons
on being transported for life to Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>The month of June opened with the execution of one of the
prisoners for sheep-stealing. Who suffered on the 2d, and his
companion on the 8th. At the moment of execution he gave
information of a gang of villains he had long been connected
with.</p>
<p>On the 8th the Hunter returned from Norfolk Island, and was
directly re-chartered to take there an officer and some soldiers,
some convicts and stores.</p>
<p>The Belle Sauvage, an American ship from Rhode Island, which
anchored in Neutral Bay, to refit, and sailed on the 10th.</p>
<p>Robberies and sheep-stealing increasing as if in defiance of
convictions and executions, it was thought necessary to pursue
some steps to overcome this evil; and to effect which a
proclamation was read in church on Sunday the 15th, previous to
issuing a process of outlawry against these public depredators,
whom all persons were commanded to assist in securing.</p>
<p>The effect of which proclamation was, that three men were
taken up, and, being tried and found guilty of sheep-stealing,
received that sentence of death they so justly merited.</p>
<p>The Hunter sailed on the 29th for Norfolk Island, having on
board Major Foveaux of the New South Wales corps, who was
proceeding to take the command of that settlement At the same
time those prisoners under sentence of transportation were sent,
and some soldiers, to the detachment of the regiment there.</p>
<p>The officers appointed for superintending the erection of the
public gaol at Sydney, informed the Governor that several persons
had not only neglected, but even resisted the payment of the
assessments ordered to defray the expense of the building; in
consequence of which it was ordered that they should be paid into
the hands of the persons directed to collect them immediately,
or, in case of a further refusal, such steps as necessary would
instantly be put in force.</p>
<p>The prisoners left for execution last month suffered death,
two at Sydney, on the 3d of this month, July, 1800, and the third
at Paramatta on the 5th.</p>
<p>A muster being made during this month, of the inhabitants,
attended by Lieut. Governor King, and other officers of the
settlement, for the purpose of transmitting to England, the
Buffalo, dropped down the harbour, to prepare for her voyage; it
not being possible, without inflicting punishment, to keep the
people to their duty on board, while lying even near that newly
formed seat of temptation, Sydney.</p>
<p>Several gentlemen now prepared for their return to England,
the Governor having granted permission for that purpose; in
consequence of which, much live-stock was sold, and an addition
made to that of the crown by the purchase of the large
cattle.</p>
<p>The Martha, which had been sent to Hunter river for coals on
her return, anchored during bad weather in the North of the
harbour, and was, by the parting of her cable, driven on a reef
of rocks, where her bottom was beat out; but by the assistance of
the officers and crew of the Buffalo, she was got off, and, being
floated with, casks, was brought to Sydney, and on examination
her damages were found not to be so serious as expected.</p>
<p>The master stated that he had not been absolutely in the
river, but in an inlet, five leagues Southward of the river,
which had a small island at its entrance. He was conducted by the
natives to a spot not far from the mouth, where he found
abundance of coal.</p>
<p>Certificates were granted this month to many who had been
their terms of transportation. To concentrate the strength of the
New South Wales corps (which now became requisite from the
turbulence of the Irish prisoners), the presence of an officer
was thought necessary at the Hawkesbury. Mr. Grimes, the deputy
surveyor, was in consequence appointed to take on him the office
of a justice of the peace.</p>
<p>In the beginning of August, the Albion whaler went into Broken
Bay, and completed her wood and water. She had obtained 600
barrels of oil; but owing to the badness of the weather, had not
secured more than one-fourth of the whales they killed. The
number of these fish which they saw was reported to be
immense.</p>
<p>A most daring attempt was made, at three o'clock one
afternoon, to land without a permit 1016 gallons of wine and
spirits, which of course were taken possession of at the wharf by
the centinel.</p>
<p>In absolute defiance of the repeated orders issued to enforce
a decent attendance at divine service on Sunday, that day was
still marked by nearly a total neglect of its duties. Another
order was now given on the 25th, again pointing out the duties of
the superintendants, constables, and overseers, as far as
respected this particular needful attention, and at the same time
assuring them that a further neglect on their parts, should be
noticed by their dismission from their situations; thus, as their
interest was made concerned, there could be much less doubt of
their attending to this last order, more than to those which
before left it that scarce article in this country,
principal.</p>
<p>Intelligence was at this time brought to the settlement of the
death of Wilson*. He had passed the major part of his life while
in this country in the woods with the natives, and was, as
mentioned before, very strongly suspected of instructing them
where they could injure the settlers with effect and safety to
themselves. However, on a proclamation from the Governor, he
surrendered himself, and promised to amend, and as nothing but a
determined love of idleness could be proved against him, he was
forgiven; and supplied with a musquet and ammunition, for the
purpose of accompanying those who made excursions into the woods,
and at other times he went to shoot kangaroos and birds. The
first bird of paradise ever seen in this country was shot by him;
it was his usual custom to live on the flesh of those birds he
killed, bringing with him their skins.</p>
<p align="center"><small>[* Vide Pages 138, &amp;c. [Chapter
V]]</small></p>
<p>Over the wood natives he had so great an influence as to
enable him to persuade them that he had himself been a black man,
and carried the joke on so far as absolutely to point, out an old
woman as his mother, who poor soul was weak and credulous enough
to own the rascal as her son. These natives who inhabit the woods
are certainly not so keen as those who live upon the coast. The
essential difference may be accounted for by their manner of
living, as undoubtedly society contributes much to the exercise
and enlargement of the mental faculties, Wilson presumed upon
their mental inability; and, having imposed himself on them as
their countryman, and inspired them with both fear and respect of
his superior powers, he indulged himself in taking libertine
liberties with their young females. Deficient as these poor
savages were in reasoning faculties, he found to his cost they
were susceptible of wrongs; for, having appropriated against her
inclinations a female to his own accommodation, her friends took
an opportunity, when he could not defend himself, to drive a
spear through his body, and thus ended his career, and left them
to expect his return at some future period in the shape of
another white man.</p>
<p>It may be remembered in the former part of this work, that the
natives of Port Stephens, entertained a similar idea, when four
white men had been thrown among them; Wilson having heard this
circumstance, availed himself of it in his visitations with the
wood natives.</p>
<p>Some very serious rumours were circulated early in September,
respecting the prisoners lately sent from Ireland for sedition,
and being concerned in the late rebellion. It was asserted that
they had formed a plan for gaining possession of the colony, that
many pikes were in great forwardness; these reports caused the
Governor to nominate a committee of officers to examine all
suspected persons, and endeavour to ascertain if any such design
existed.</p>
<p>In the routine of their inquiries, they found occasion to
imprison Harold the Catholic priest, who both from his language
and behaviour was suspected of being concerned in the intended
attack on the Government. He confessed the reports were founded
in truth, and undertook to discover the weapons concealed, of
which it had been said several hundreds were made. He implicated
several of his countrymen, and they on being questioned, accused
several others; indeed, from what transpired on the examination,
the committee thought them all deserving of punishment; Harold
however was unable to fulfil his promise of producing the pikes.
He first said they were buried in the ground of a settler, but on
searching every part of it, no pikes could be found. He then said
they were sunk in the harbour; but here neither could they be
discovered. Thus failing he tried to persuade an Irishman, to
make a few to produce in support of his assertion; but the man
unfortunately for him had been transported for having already
been a dealer in those articles, and declared he would not
involve himself a second time on their account. He however did at
length find a man to make something like one, from a large old
hinge, this bore too strongly the marks of imposition to gain any
credit. There was evidently a determination to create an alarm;
Harold declaring that he only, as their priest, was able to come
at the facts, was thought to be aiming at making himself of
consequence in the new intended government. He had some time
since applied to the Governor for liberty to act as their priest
and most undoubtedly had he been well affected to the government,
he might have been of use to the colony in that office.</p>
<p>In consequence of these circumstances and to counteract their
effects, a number of the inhabitants were formed into two
volunteer associations of fifty men each, and called the Sydney
and Paramatta Loyal Associated Corps, each commanded by a
Captain, two Lieutenants, and a proper number of non-commissioned
officers. They were supplied with arms and ammunition from the
stores, and were instructed in the use of them by the Serjeants
of the New South Wales corps.</p>
<p>Coal having been found on the banks of George's river, the
governor visited the place, and an examination discovered the
existence of that fossil, of which, a vein was about the same
time found on the west-side of Garden Island cove.</p>
<p>On the 21st of September, the John Jay, an American ship,
arrived from Rhode Island, bound to China. She had on board for
sale, a quantity of salt beef and pork, which was bought by
government, at seven-pence three farthings per pound, for the
purpose of issuing to those people off the stores, at the same
price.</p>
<p>The Buffalo was now ready for sea, and as the governor had
resolved to return in that ship to England, and had arranged all
affairs, relative to the settlement, and the lieutenant-governor
of Norfolk Island being on the spot, he left the direction of the
colony to him, and embarked on Sunday the 28th of September,
1800, previously reviewing the New South Wales corps, of whom his
Excellency took leave by issuing the following order:</p>
<p>"The governor, having this day reviewed that part of His
Majesty's New South Wales corps doing duty at Sydney, cannot omit
this opportunity of expressing the satisfaction he has received
from their very handsome and military appearance, which does so
much honour to Lieutenant Colonel Paterson, and the commissioned
officers under his command. The expertness with which the various
military motions were performed is highly to the credit of the
whole body, and in which the non-commissioned officers have a
very distinguished share. The governor cannot lose the present
opportunity (as it may possibly be the last) of assuring the
troops generally, that the confidence which he has long reposed
in their promptitude upon every occasion that might require their
particular exertion, has ever inclined him to consider with
contempt the threatnings said to have been held out by a number
of discontented and misled people: well satisfied that the active
assistance of the New South Wales corps, added to those
precautions and exertions which have, and he trusts, will
continue to distinguish the civil power, will ever be found a
complete security for the peace and tranquillity of this
settlement, and of His Majesty's government in this remote part
of the British dominions."</p>
<p>His Excellency's embarkation was attended with every mark of
respect and regret. The road to the wharf was lined with troops,
and he was accompanied by the officers of the civil and military
departments with a concourse of inhabitants; who shewed by their
deportment the high sense they entertained of the regard he had
ever paid to their interests, and the justice and humanity of his
government.</p>
<p>When governor Hunter departed from the colony, he left the
following live-stock and ground in cultivation:</p>
<p align="center"><small>LIVE-STOCK.</small></p>
<p><small>60 Horses, 143 Mares, 332 Bulls and Oxen, 712 Cows,
4017 Hogs, 2031 Male, and 4093 Female Sheep, with 725 Male, and
1455 Female Goats.</small></p>
<p align="center"><small>LAND IN CULTIVATION.</small></p>
<p><small>4665 Acres of Wheat, 2930 Acres of Maize, and 82 Acres
of Barley, exclusive of garden ground, with Potatoes and other
Vegetables.</small></p>
<p>The land in cultivation this year, was considerably less than
the preceding, in consequence of the increased poverty of the
settlers, which arose not only from their own imprudence, but the
very high price which every thing cost they had occasion to buy,
as well as the great wages they were obliged to pay for
labour.</p>
<p>To amend the latter inconvenience, it was only requisite to
wait an increase of the numbers in the colony, when the price of
labour would find its proper level, and the high demands made for
articles wanted, the government of the mother country, was now
kindly taking means to overcome, by sending them out for the
purpose of being retailed to the settlers at a moderate rate, and
thus by an ample supply, prevent the growing evil of
monopoly.</p>
<p>On the 21st of October, the Buffalo sailed for England, and
the Governor intended to touch at Norfolk Island, to learn from
observation, the state of that settlement, as some of the Irish
prisoners, suspected of laying plans of insurrection, were taken
in the Buffalo, to be landed there. As the last information from
which place More an unpromising aspect, the buildings were in a
state of decay, and few symptoms of industry were visible. Of
live-stock, only a few hogs and a few vegetables were to be
procured. At Phillip Island, on which had been fed a great number
of hogs, not one was alive, they having, for want of food,
absolutely destroyed each other. A few acres of wheat were ready
for reaping; but on the whole, Norfolk Island did not promise to
repay the expense it cost.</p>
<p>On board of the Buffalo were taken two black swans, and three
New South Wales emus. Lieutenant Kent who returned to England in
the Buffalo, previous to his departure, sold an elegant house he
had built at a great expense, which was bought to convert into an
orphan school, and speedily inhabited by them.</p>
<p>How highly honourable it was to the promoters of so laudable
an institution! for certainly, in no country under heaven, could
such an establishment be more wanting, as nearly every child
might be esteemed an orphan, for, generally speaking, their
parents did not deserve the name of fathers or mothers even while
alive.</p>

<p>During the government of Governor Hunter, the following list
of works were executed by the working gangs; and those public
works previous to his arrival, are found mentioned in the history
at various times.</p>
<p>A second strong wind-mill tower was erected at Sydney, 36 feet
in height.</p>
<p>At Sydney a granary, 72 feet in length, and 21 in width, with
two floors, was built from the ruins of a mill house, formerly
erected with great labour and expense by Lieut. Governor
Grose.</p>
<p>The public roads made good and repaired at various times, and
bridges thrown over the gullies.</p>
<p>A framed bridge built over Duck river, capable of bearing any
weight.</p>
<p>Two log granaries, 100 feet long, one for wheat and the other
for maize, erected at the Hawkesbury on the Green-hills, and
inclosed with paling.</p>
<p>A similar one at Paramatta, 100 feet in length, and paled
round with a strong high fence, like that at Sydney, which was
also like that, destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>A suite of rooms built of brick at Sydney, between the
hospitals and dwelling-house of the surgeon, for the use of his
assistants; the huts originally built for them, having gone to
decay.</p>
<p>The huts at Paramatta, built by Governor Phillip for the
reception of convicts on their arrival, having been neglected and
which had fallen to ruin, were repaired and made fit for the use
designed.</p>
<p>A wind-mill with a stone tower, built on the hill above
Sydney.</p>
<p>A double logged gaol, 80 feet long, with separate cells for
prisoners, was built at Sydney, which was afterwards burnt.</p>
<p>Eight embrasures to the battery on point Maskelyne, were made,
and a redoubt raised with eight embrasures on the point of the
cove, and mounted with cannon. And two guns were mounted on
Garden Island.</p>
<p>An apartment containing three rooms of brick, was built in the
yard of the old gaol, before it was burnt, for debtors.</p>
<p>A barn 90 feet long, was built at Toongabbe, in which nine
pair of threshers could work. The original one built by Governor
Phillip having fallen down.</p>
<p>Both government houses, the military barracks, officers'
dwellings, store-houses and granaries, and all public buildings
repaired, coated with lime and white-washed, to preserve them
from decay.</p>
<p>A brick building 100 feet long, built by Governor Phillip at
Paramatta, was repaired, and two floors laid; with an addition to
its length of 60 feet, for the purpose of a granary for wheat;
there being no building entirely for this use in the colony.</p>
<p>A framed and weather-boarded house was built on the
Green-hills at the Hawkesbury, for the commanding officer of that
district. It was shingled, and had a cellar, a kitchen, and other
accommodations, and paled round.</p>
<p>A weather-boarded store-house, with two wings built at Sydney,
which was on the burning of the church converted into a place of
worship, till a new church was erected.</p>
<p>At Sydney an excellent brick granary was erected, 100 feet
long and 22 wide, with three floors. An addition, was afterwards
made to this building of about 70 feet, for a kiln to dry the
grain.</p>
<p>At Paramatta a weather-boarded granary, 140 feet in length,
was built for the reception of maize.</p>
<p>A complete smith's shop for forges, was built at Sydney.</p>
<p>A range of barracks at Sydney were built for three
officers.</p>
<p>The foundation of a church was began at Sydney, of a large
size.</p>
<p>A handsome church was erected at Paramatta, 100 feet in length
and 44 in width, with a room 20 feet long, raised on stone
pillars, for a vestry or council room.</p>
<p>A tower steeple was built at the same place for a town
clock.</p>
<p>A naval yard was paled in on the west side of the cove, and
within it a joiner's and a blacksmith's shop, with sheds for the
vessels repairing, and the workmen, were erected; with a steamer,
a storehouse, a warder's lodge, and an apartment for the
clerk.</p>
<p>A neat thatched hut was built in the government garden at
Paramatta, for the gardener.</p>
<p>A handsome and commodious stone gaol at Sydney; with separate
apartments for debtors, and six strong cells for condemned
felons.</p>
<p>A commodious stone-house was built near the naval yard for the
master boat-builder.</p>
<p>A large and elegant government house was erected at Paramatta,
the first being too small, and so gone to decay that the roof
fell in. The new building is spacious and roomy, with cellars and
an attic story.</p>
<p>A new powder magazine was began, a frame was raised, and the
roof thatched of an open barn at the Ninety Acres, and a
threshing floor was laid.</p>
<p>A new dispensary was built, and the pannelled hospital removed
and rose on a stone foundation, and at the same time was erected
a new hospital store.</p>
<p>Fenced the military barracks with high paling.</p>
<p>Enlarged by a scalene building the whole length of each house,
the dwellings of the principal surgeon, the senior
assistant-surgeon, and the deputy-surveyor, by which an
additional accommodation of two rooms were given to each
house.</p>
<p>Paled in a cooperage adjoining the provision store at Sydney.
Cleansed from filth the public tanks, and encompassed them and
the spring-head with paling.</p>
<p>A military hospital and dispensary, and an officer's
guard-room, were built at Sydney.</p>
<p>Sheds for the boats belonging to government when hauled on
shore were also built.</p>
<p>Laid a new foundation, rebuilt a part of the walls, and
repaired the wet provision store at Paramatta.</p>
<p>Houses were erected near the hospital at Sydney, for the
nurses and attendants.</p>
<p>Repaired, plastered, white-washed, and coated with lime, a
house for a school at Sydney.</p>
<p>Several stock yards for cattle were inclosed, and many old
sheds were repaired at Paramatta, Toongabbe, and Portland-place.
In the latter district, the timber of 120 acres was cut down, and
nearly half (that of 50 acres) burnt off, a township marked out,
and some few huts built, and a number of inferior buildings.</p>
<p>Exclusive of erecting and repairing the foregoing public
works, detachments were daily employed in preserving the various
buildings, the property of the crown, particularly those occupied
by that class subordinate to the commissioned officers; and, as
these repairs were necessary to prevent those buildings going to
decay, they had been paid every attention to by Governor
Hunter.</p>
<p>The inclosures of the park and burial ground having suffered
by decay, a gang of carpenters and labourers were for a
considerable time employed in preparing railing, and putting them
up.</p>
<p>The Judge-Advocate's house at Sydney was enlarged and
repaired, with several alterations, and out-houses.</p>
<p>The strength of the public gangs did not permit their being
further employed, or it was meant to have built a water-mill at
Paramatta.</p>
<p>A court-house at the same place, and two new stores, with a
guard-house at the Green Hills. The stores were of brick, and the
guard-house of weather boards.</p>
<p>In the district of Portland Place, a stock-yard, consisting of
30 acres, was inclosed with posts and rails, and included four
chains of fresh-water ponds.</p>
<p>[The following inserted into 2nd Edition]</p>
<blockquote>[Since this period a large range of storehouses are
completed on the banks of the Paramatta river, and another had
been commenced close by the wharf at Sydney. The necessity of
some new buildings of this description had been evident for some
time, as a chief part of the king's storehouses previously
erected were too remote from the water side, which made the
unlading of ships extremely burthensome and expensive. These
inconveniences are now completely remedied, and the port rendered
more commodious than ever. Some short time also before he left
the settlement, two murders were committed by men named Brown,
and Kenny; the former of whom had killed many men at the
Southward, and was brought from thence to Port Jackson, for
trial, where he was convicted, executed, and subsequently hung in
chains on Pinch-gut, a small island in the centre of the harbour
leading to Sydney Cove. The latter was arraigned for the murder
of a woman named Smith, who, after he had perpetrated the deed,
endeavoured to consume the body of his victim, by thrusting it in
the fire. Pie was executed and hung in chains at Paramatta.<br>
<br>
It further appears that our spring is the autumn of the year in
that distant quarter.<br>
<br>
The destruction of the playhouse is mentioned as a benefit to
this infant colony, because, "when the inhabitants were engaged
in this enjoyment, their property was left unwatched. It was also
a common practice to give provisions to obtain entrance, if money
was scarce; and thus many of the convicts were unable to pursue
their labour with proper energy and activity. Other abuses, which
also resulted from the establishment of the theatre, induced the
Governor to recall the permission given for the performances, and
the playhouse was soon after levelled with the ground.<br>
<br>
Since this period, cricket; cards, water-parties, shooting,
fishing, and hunting the kangaroo, have been more attended to.
The officers have a private subscription billiard room; but
still, among the convicts gaming is carried on to a deplorable
degree.<br>
<br>
Over the South Creek at Hawkesbury, a floating bridge has been
erected, which has proved greatly beneficial to the public;
since, previous to its completion, every person who had occasion
to go to that settlement, and in many cases from one farm to
another, was obliged to pass to and fro in a boat. As this bridge
was constructed by an individual, (Mr. Andrew Thompson, a
settler) at his own expence, the following tolls are allowed to
be demanded:&mdash;For ever foot passenger fourpence, or ten
shillings per annum; for each horse, single or in draught, two
shillings and sixpence, or two pounds ten shillings per annum;
for waggons, or other four wheel carriages, with not more than
half a ton lading, one shilling and sixpence, or one pound ten
shillings per annum; for carts or carriages with two wheels,
laden or not, each one shilling and sixpence, or one pound ten
per annum; for sheep, under a score, twopence each, and by the
score, two shillings and sixpence, or two pounds ten per annum;
swine and goats, the same as sheep. Passengers, horses, carts,
and carriages are allowed to pass during the same day, with one
ticket, and a considerable income is derived from this toll.<br>
<br>
The Rocks, a part of the town of Sydney, is the general promenade
for the dashing Belles of the settlement; and the European women,
it is observed, spare no expence in ornamenting their persons.
The shops, where most of their decorations are purchased, are set
out with much taste; and articles of female ornament and apparel
are greedily purchased. By a very recent census, there were nine
thousand three hundred and fifty six inhabitants, in the
settlement, out of which six thousand support
themselves.]</blockquote>
<p>In the naval department, a vessel was left on the stocks,
designed to be of 150 or 160 tons burthen, and intended for the
purpose of taking the relief to and from Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>A boat called the Cumberland was on the stocks, and nearly
finished, of 27 tons burthen, meant to be schooner rigged and
armed, for the pursuit of deserters, who were in the practice of
carrying away the boats of the settlement.</p>
<p>In this account of the labour performed for the public, under
Governor Hunter, is not estimated the time employed for the
preparation of the earth for sowing, and the gathering in of the
harvests; so that it must indeed be considered, with no small
degree of astonishment, that such a number of buildings should
have, by any exertions, been effected, when proper allowance is
made for the dispositions of those, who only could be employed in
either building or repairing, and when added to the deduction,
which threshing out the corn for delivery, and unloading the
store-ships as they arrived, a proper allowance of time is made;
it proves that Governor Hunter effected the most with the
comparatively little labour he could induce the convicts to
perform.</p>
<p>Shortly after the departure of Governor Hunter, it appeared on
an investigation of the registers of the terms of transportation
of the convicts, that the clerks, who had been suffered to have
access to them, had altered the sentences of nearly two hundred
prisoners, on receiving a sum from each equal in value to ten or
twelve pounds; and proper steps to guard against so truly serious
an evil in future, were taken at the colony, and proper
information sent to England on the subject.</p>
<p>It now appeared the expenses attending the erecting of the
county gaol, had cost the sum of 3954<i>l</i>. the greater part
of which had been paid by public assessments.</p>
<p>Every encouragement being given for the purpose of promoting
the growth of wool, for manufacturing 300 yards of blanketing
were made from what the wool produced last season, from the
flocks belonging to government and individuals; and in five
months, 470 yards of flax were made into linen.</p>
<p>The never-resting spirit of Speculation which continually
manifested itself in the arrival of ships, received a serious
check by the Governor's sending back three vessels from Bengal,
on board which were fifty-four thousand gallons of spirits and
wine.</p>
<p>The quantity of copper coin expected having arrived, the
Governor published a table of the specie legally in circulation
in the colony, affixing the rates to each, at which they were to
be considered a legal tender in all payments, viz.</p>

<p>And as the supply of copper was sent for the convenience of
persons wanting to make small payments, no sum exceeding
5<i>l</i>. was to be esteemed a legal tender of this money; and
it was declared, that exporting or importing* of any sum of the
copper coin exceeding 5<i>l</i>. should be punished by a fine of
treble the value of the sum so exported or imported, and the
forfeiture of the sum in question.</p>
<p align="center"><small>[* Except by government.]</small></p>
<p>Ships arrived from India, England, and America, bringing on
speculation cargos of wine, spirits, tobacco, teas, sugar,
hardware, wearing apparel, &amp;c. and were publicly sold.</p>
<p>By these ships had been imported 59,294 gallons of spirits,
30,896 ditto of wines, out of which were landed 26,974 ditto of
spirits, 8,896 ditto of wines; and 32,320 ditto of spirits,
22,000 ditto of wines, were sent away.</p>
<p>By information from Norfolk Island intelligence was received,
that a plot was fortunately discovered, on the 14th of December
1800, formed by some of the convicts to murder the officers, and,
by getting possession of the island, to liberate themselves. Two
of the ringleaders were immediately executed, and others properly
punished.</p>
<p>Major Foveaux, the lieutenant-governor, had found the truly
desirable long wanted and unknown acquisition, a good
landing-place for boats and small vessels, in Anson's Bay, where
there were four and five fathoms of water only a few yards from
the shore, with a fine sandy beach, and a free passage from rocks
or shoals.</p>
<p>Having at length brought down the History of New South Wales
in regular progression, to the close of the eighteenth century, I
shall here desist from following the routine of the regular
relation of events, and leave the country in its settled state,
and I shall now proceed to the Natural History of the Island;
that done, I shall, in a concluding Chapter, give a continuance
of the History, from the beginning of the year 1801, till the
time I forwarded the manuscript to England.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h3>
<p align="center">[Natural History]</p>
<p><small>LITTLE</small> versed in studying the divine works of
Nature, I have availed myself of the labours, of my predecessors,
and accompany their researches with my own observations on the
various subjects; and as I have been assisted with natural
historical information from the same high and distinguished
characters who have generously favoured me with Colonial
historical facts, I shall give undoubtedly a faithful account of
the Natural History of New South Wales in its various
departments, as far as yet discovered, and, as Pope very justly
observes, that</p>
<p align="center"><small>"Want of decency is want of
sense."</small></p>
<p>I shall by no means introduce any description that can offend
the most delicate mind, or shall I intrude on my readers any
account of those productions which seem the inhabitants of nearly
all countries, such as the rat, the bat, the squirrel, &amp;c.
&amp;c. meaning only to describe those which seem to be more
particularly the natives of this country, and were not generally
known previous to the establishment of the colony.</p>
<p align="center">QUADRUPEDS.</p>
<p align="center"><small>ORNITHORHYNCHUS PARADOXUS.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> animal, which has obtained the name of
Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus, is still very little known. It is
found only to inhabit fresh-water lakes in the interior parts of
the country. It swims not on the surface of the water, but comes
up to breathe, in the same manner as the turtle. The natives
often sit on the banks, with spears and watch their rising to the
surface, till they get a good opportunity of striking them, which
they do with their usual dexterity, and frequently succeed in
catching them.</p>
<p>Governor Hunter once saw a native watching one above an hour
before he threw his spear at it; but at length he drove it
through the neck and fore leg, and when he brought it on shore,
it used its claws with such force, that it became requisite to
confine it between two pieces of board, while they cut off the
barbs of the spear, to disengage it. When freed, it ran on the
ground with as great activity as a land tortoise, which was much
faster than the structure of its fore feet seemed to promise. It
inhabits the banks of lakes, and feeds in the muddy places which
surrounds them; but its food is unknown.</p>
<p>The male is 17&frac14; inches in length, from the point of the
bill to the extremity of the tail. The bill is 2&frac14; inches
long; and the end of the tail 4&frac12; inches.</p>
<p>The animal's body is compressed, and of the same general
thickness, except over the shoulders, where it is smaller. The
circumference of the body is 11 inches.</p>
<p>In size, the female is rendered rather larger than the male,
by a portion of fat lying very generally under the skin, which
the male is without.</p>
<p>The colour of the male is a very dark brown, on the back,
legs, bill, and tail; the under part of the neck and belly is of
a silver grey.</p>
<p>The hair is of two kinds; a very fine thick fur, one half an
inch long, and a curious kind of hair, nearly an inch long. The
part nearest the root has the appearance of hair; but for a
quarter of an inch towards the point it becomes flat, resembling
feathers: this has a gloss on it. The fur or hair on the back is
shorter than that on the belly.</p>
<p>No appearance could be observed of nipples; although the skin
on the belly of the female was examined with the greatest
accuracy.</p>
<p>The head is compressed. The bill, projects beyond the mouth,
and in its appearance resembles that of a duck; but is in fact
more like that of the spoonbill, the middle part being composed
of bone, as in that bird: it has a very strong covering.</p>
<p>The nostrils are close to each other, near the end of the
bill; and the upper lip projects three quarters of an inch beyond
them.</p>
<p>The eyes are small; situated more on the upper part of the
head than usual, and are behind the loose edge of the flap
belonging to the bill. The eyelids are concealed in the hair,
and, in the male, are scarcely seen; but the female has a tuft of
lighter hair, which marks their situation.</p>
<p>The ears are two large slits, behind the eyes, and larger than
the orifices of the eyelids.</p>
<p>The teeth are all grinders; and are four in number, one on
each side of the upper and under jaw, and have broad flat crowns.
They differ from common teeth materially, having neither enamel
nor bone, being composed of a horny substance only, connected by
an irregular surface in the place of fangs. When cut through
which is readily done, the internal structure is like the human
nail.</p>
<p>Between the cheek and the jaw, on each side of the mouth,
there is a pouch, as in the monkey tribe. When laid open, it is
1&frac14; inch long, and the same in breadth. In the female it
contains a substance, the size of a small nut, in each pouch.</p>
<p>Besides these teeth, there are two small pointed horny teeth
upon the projecting part of the posterior portion of the tongue,
the points of which are directed forwards, to prevent the food
being pushed into the fauces during the process of mastication;
which circumstance is peculiar to this animal.</p>
<p>The fore legs are short, and the feet webbed. Each foot has
five toes, united by the web, which is very broad, and is
continued beyond the points of the toes nearly an inch. On each
toe there is a rounded straight nail, which lies loose upon the
membrane forming the web.</p>
<p>The hind legs are nearly of the same length as the forelegs,
but stronger. Each foot has five toes with claws, and webbed.</p>
<p>The male, on the heel, has a strong crooked spur, with a sharp
point, which has a joint between it and the foot, and is capable
of motion in two directions. When the point of it is brought
close to the leg, the spur is concealed in the hair; when
directed outwards, it projects considerably, and is conspicuous.
The tail in shape is like that of the beaver.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE TAPOA TAFA, OR TAPHA.</small></p>
<p>Is the size of a rat, though its formation gives it the
appearance of the martin cat, but that its body, compared to its
size, is not so long.</p>
<p>The head, which is broad from side to side, is in front flat;
the nose, which is pointed, projects beyond the teeth; the eyes
are large; the ears broad and end in points. The nature and
colour of its hair resembles that of the rat, and it has wiskers
from the nose to the eyes; the hind feet are longer, and more
flexible than the fore. On each foot there are five toes, and of
those on the fore feet, the middle toe is the largest, the rest
fall off progressively; the nails are short and sharp; on the
sole of the foot there is no hair; the tail is long, and covered
with hair of a mixed grey colour.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE TAPOA TAFA</small></p>
<p>Is only a variety of the Tapoa Tapha, and that in its external
appearance, being covered with black and white markings of
various shapes.</p>
<p align="center"><small>WHA TAPOAU ROO.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> animal in size resembles the racoon; the
colour, which is grey on the back, becomes lighter on the sides,
and changes to a rich brown on the belly; the hair is of two
sorts, long hair, and a kind of fur. The Wha Tapoau Roo has a
very short head, with prominent eyes and broad ears. Its tail is
long, and covered with hair, except the under part towards the
end. On the fore feet are five toes, the shortest of which
appears like a thumb; the hind feet resemble those of the monkey,
having no nail on the great toe, and being bare on the sole.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic06" id="id08"></a><img alt="" src=
"1203391h-images/pic06.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">A Native Dog</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE DOG, OR DINGO.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> native dog of New South Wales resembles
very much the foundation of the species, which is the Wolf,
though it is considerably smaller, and stands lower; but from its
ill-nature and viciousness, which indeed nothing overcomes, it
may with great propriety he esteemed the wolf of the country.</p>
<p>The Dog or Dingo barks in a way peculiar to itself, but moans,
snarls, and howls like other dogs.</p>
<p>Its general colour is a reddish dun, covered with long thick
strait hair, and has short erect ears and a bushy tail; the nose,
belly, and feet, are of a blue grey colour.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE POTO ROO, OR KANGAROO
RAT.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> head of this animal is not so flat on a
side view as the Scalpis Dentata. It has ears formed like those
of a mouse. The hind legs compared to the fore are long; on the
fore legs are four toes, the two middle of which are longest, and
of the same length, with long bent nails. On their hind feet they
have three toes, the middle one of which is the largest; the tail
is long; the body has a mixed covering of hair and fur of a
brownish grey colour.</p>
<p>This curious animal, which is indeed a miniature of the
Kangaroo, has a pouch also on the lower part of the belly, for
carrying its young in cases of danger or pursuit, on the surface
of which are placed four nipples near each other.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE HEPOONA ROO.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> animal, which in size resembles the
rabbit, has a flat body, with a head like a squirrel; the eyes
are large and full, the ears are broad; the tail long, and its
legs very short. Between the fore and hind legs, on the side is a
skin, which on the extension of the legs form a broad wing; but
when the legs are used in walking, it draws close up to the side
of the animal, thus resembling the flying squirrel. On each fore
foot it has five toes, with sharp nails, and on the hind toes it
has the same number; but one may be termed rather a thumb, as it
has a broad nail like a monkey. The foot is well calculated for
holding the animal in a suspended state; the hair is thick and
long on the back, and of a brown-grey colour.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic07" id="id09"></a><img alt="" src=
"1203391h-images/pic07.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Kangaroo</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE KANGAROO.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> animal appears the most important in the
country; its size is considerable, and it supplies both food and
clothing, if an apron may be so called, to the inhabitants.</p>
<p>It has a small head, neck, and shoulders, and the body
increases in thickness to the rump, from whence it again tapers
to the tail. The head is oblong, and in form like that of a fawn,
the upper lip being divided. The nostrils are wide and open, and
the lower jaw is somewhat shorter than the upper.</p>
<p>The pupil of the eyes is of a blueish black, and the irides
are dusky. The ears are erect, ovated, and thin at the ends.</p>
<p>The hair of the Kangaroo is of a greyish brown colour,
somewhat similar to the English wild rabbit. It is thick and
long, when the animal becomes old; but is very slow in its
growth, and for some time resembles a strong down. In some parts,
however, the mouth for example, it begins earlier to be
hairy.</p>
<p>This animal's teeth are so singular, that it is impossible to
decide, from them, to what class the Kangaroo belongs. It has
four broad cutting teeth in the upper jaw; but only two long
lanceolated teeth in the lower, which point forwards, and are so
placed as to oppose those of the upper. It has also four grinding
teeth in each jaw, remote from the others; and possesses the very
singular power of separating the lower incisores, and bringing
them again close to each other.</p>
<p>The proportions in some of the parts of this animal bear no
analogy to what is common in most others.</p>
<p>The fore legs are so very short, as scarcely to reach the
nose, and are indeed useless for walking. The hind legs are
almost as long as the body, and the thighs are very thick. On the
forefeet are five toes, with long conic and strong black claws;
but on the hind feet are only three, the middle toe being very
long and thick, like that of an ostrich, and extending far beyond
the two others, which are small, and placed very distinct from
it. The inner toe of the hind feet is singularly distinguished,
by having two small claws; and the bottom and hind parts of the
feet, on which the animal often rests, are black, naked, and
tuberculated. The tail, which is thick at the base, and tapers to
a point, has at the end a strong hard nail, and the hair on it is
short and somewhat hard. The tail, though long in the old, is in
the young short proportionally to the animal's size. It seems to
keep pace with the growth of the hind legs, which are the
instruments of progressive motion in this animal, and which would
also shew that the tail is a kind of second instrument in this
action.</p>
<p>The scrotum, which is large and pendulous, is placed before;
and the female has, on the belly, an oblong pouch, of a vast
depth, the receptacle of her young.</p>
<p>The Kangaroo is frequently more than six feet long, from the
nose to the tail; and its weight of a hundred and fifty pounds
and upwards.</p>
<p>Kangaroo is the natives name for this extraordinary
animal.</p>
<p>It lurks among the grass, feeds on vegetables, and drinks by
lapping. It goes chiefly on it's hind legs; making use of the
fore feet as hands, only for digging, or bringing its food to its
mouth.</p>
<p>The Kangaroo is timid: at the sight of men it flies from them
by amazing leaps; springing over bushes seven or eight feet high,
and going progressively from rock to rock.</p>
<p>When in motion, this animal carries its tail quite at right
angles with its body; and, as it alights, often looks back. It is
much too swift for greyhounds, and frequently escapes from the
fleetest of those animals. The tail is its weapon of defence,
with which it is capable of beating away the strongest dog.</p>
<p>The Kangaroo soon becomes domesticated when taken.</p>
<p>Mr. Pennant, the celebrated English naturalist, gives the
following account of one he saw in London, during 1793:</p>
<p>"It was (says Mr. P.) in a place of confinement; it for a
little time went on all fours, but soon assumed an upright
attitude. It would sport with its keeper in a very singular
manner: it first placed its tail in a perpendicular manner;
erected its body on it as a prop; and then, raising its whole
body, darted its hind legs on the breast of the man. It was
capable of striking with great force, if provoked; and it could
scratch violently with its fore claws."</p>

The Ladies' Cup, which was of very superior workmanship, won by
Chase, was presented to Captain Ritchie by Mrs. Macquarie, who,
accompanied by his Excellency, honoured each day's Races with her
presence, and who, with her usual affability, was pleased to
preface the donation with the following short address:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"In the name of the Ladies of New South Wales, I have the
pleasure to present you with this Cup. Give me leave to
congratulate you on being the successful candidate for it; and to
hope that it is a prelude to future success, and lasting
prosperity."<br>
<br>
Besides the above, several other matches were run during the
week. At the close of the second day, four hacks ran for a saddle

heats, and won by Boshy.<br>

won by Mr. Cox.<br>
<br>
The fall received by Mr. Wentworth's gr. g. Gig, in the first
heat on the last day, was occasioned by a dog crossing the
Course. The rider (Fisher) was too much hurt to recover himself
in time to remount, but the horse was not much injured by his
fall.<br>
<br>
A similar accident had nearly befallen Mr. Benn's Scratch the
second heat, being so much startled by a dog as to fly off, and
run considerably out of his track; which was, however, attended
with no bad consequences, being far a-head of his antagonist.<br>
<br>
<small>THE</small> Duke of Northumberland has sent over some
Teeswater sheep and one stallion, very recently, to Colonel
Johnston, which have greatly improved the respective breeds. Some
Merino sheep from the King's flock have also been taken over,
which have throve well, and produced very fine wool. Severed of
the deer in the colony having made their escape from a park
belonging to a Mr. Harris, surgeon of the regiment, are
understood to be breeding and running wild in the
woods.&mdash;The children born in the colony from European
parents are very robust, comely, and well made; remarkably quick
of apprehension, and ready at learning. In manners and morals
also they greatly improve.]</small></blockquote>

<p align="center">BIRDS.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE BIRD OF PARADISE OF NEW SOUTH
WALES.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> elegant bird, which by some is called the
Bird of Paradise, and by others the M&aelig;nura Superba, has a
straight bill, with the nostrils in the centre of the beak. The
base of the upper mandible has hairs like feathers inclining
downwards, the upper mandible is at the base much like that of
the pigeon, The eye is a dark hazle, with a bare space around it
of a blue cast. The chin, and a small part of the throat, are of
a dark rufous colour: the rest, with the body, of a blackish
grey. The rump feathers are longer than those of the body, and
more divided. The colour of the wings is dark rufous. The legs
and claws are large in proportion to the bird. The outward toe is
connected with that in the middle as far as the first joint. The
tail is long, and composed of three sorts of feathers, of which
the upper side is of a dark grey, with ferruginous spots. The
first two lower feathers, which are curved in two directions, are
beneath of a pearl colour, with several crescent-shaped spaces,
of a rich red and black colour. The laminae are unwebbed, rounded
towards the extremity, ornamented with a black bar, and fringed
at the end. The shaft of the second, also long, is fringed with
hair-like filaments; and the third, which is long and curved, is
plumed on the inner side only, except at the extremity.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic08" id="id10"></a><img alt="" src=
"1203391h-images/pic08.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Bird of Paradise</p>
<p>The female differs little from the male, except in the tail,
which is formed of 12 feathers a little curved and plumed, having
the upper side dark rufous and grey, and the under of a pearl
colour.</p>
<p>These birds frequent the most retired parts of the country,
and have been seen running very fast; but their cumbrous tails
prevent them from being able to fly in a direct line. They sing
for two hours in the morning, beginning when they quit the
valley, till they attain the summit of the hill, where they
scrape together a small hillock; on this they stand, with their
tail spread over them, and in this situation they imitate the
note of every bird in the country, and then they return to the
valley.</p>
<p align="center"><small>WHITE FULICA.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> bird is the only species of the genus
known of this colour. Its body is the size of a large fowl, and
on its wings are a small spine. The legs and spines on the
shoulders of the wings are yellow; the bill and front of the head
are red.</p>
<p align="center"><small>BLUE BELLIED PARROT.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> bird, which is found in all parts of the
country, has a red bill; head and throat dark blue; back part of
the head green; prime quills dusky, barred with yellow. The belly
is of a fine blue, thighs green and yellow; breast red and yellow
mixed; back and wings green; prime quills dusky, barred with
yellow; tail cuneiform, with the two middle feathers green; the
others are the same only with yellow outer edges; the legs are
dusky.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic09" id="id11"></a><img alt="" src=

<p align="center">Black Cockatoo</p>
<p align="center"><small>BLACK OR BANKSIAN COCKATOO.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> general colour of the black Cockatoo of New
South Wales is a rusty black, with long feathers on the head, on
the top of which is a fine mixture of yellow. The beak is brown,
and on the under side of the tail are several fine scarlet
feathers, with black markings and tips.</p>
<p align="center"><small>FULLIGINOUS PETERIL.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> beak of this bird is of a pale yellow hue,
but the bird is in all other parts of a deep brown or blackish
colour; except that on the chin there is a marking of white
descending from the lower mandible. This bird is most certainly
only a variety of the &AElig;quinoctialis of Linn&aelig;us. In
size it equals the English Raven.</p>
<p align="center"><small>WHITE VENTED CROW.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> bird in shape and size resembles the
English Magpye. It is black, except the base of wing feathers,
the end of the tail, and the part from whence arises its name,
which are all white. The beak is very strong, and indeed both the
habits and appearance of the bird, prove it to be of the Crow
species.</p>
<p align="center"><small>WHITE HAWK.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> entire plumage of this bird is white, the
beak is black, and the cere and legs yellow, in shape it
resembles the English hen Harrier, which is the falco cyaneus of
Linn&aelig;us.</p>
<p align="center"><small>CASSOWARY.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> Cassowary of New South Wales, is larger in
all respects than the well known bird called the Cassowary, and
differs so much even in its shape, as to incontestibly prove it a
new species; The colour is a dirty brown grey, inclined a little
to white on the belly, the structure of the feathers, which are
all small, are like those of its common name-sake, having two
quills with their webs arising out of one shaft; the head and
beak resembles the ostrich in shape as well as size; the
feathers, which very thinly cover the head, are so small as to
resemble hair which descends much thicker down the neck, except
the chin and throat, where it is so nearly bare as to shew the
skin, which at those parts is of a purple hue; its wings are so
short when compared to the bulk of the body, as to appear
ridiculous; the legs of this bird also present a very singular
appearance, for the back parts of them are notched like the teeth
of a saw, and it has three toes, with strong black claws.</p>
<p>This truly remarkable bird is very shy, and when seen, runs
with the speed of a grey-hound; its flesh is good food, being as
tender as the best beef.</p>
<p align="center"><small>CRESTED GOATSUCKER.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> genus of birds are particularly large
mouthed, in comparison to the smallness of their beaks. The
colours of the Crested Goat-sucker are cinereous, pale-brown
sprinkled with white spots on the under parts, with the long
feathers of the tail sprinkled with pale fasciae, and the
ribrissae standing up on the upper mandible like a crest.</p>
<p>The name of Goatsucker arose in consequence of an ancient
opinion of their sucking goats, &amp;c.</p>
<p>From their mode of living as well as structure, they must be
esteemed nocturnal swallows; they are fond of insects for food,
particularly beetles.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic10" id="id12"></a><img alt="" src=
"1203391h-images/pic10.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Hornbill</p>
<p align="center"><small>ANOMALOUS HORNBILL.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> very singular bird has the bill of a
Hornbill; the legs of a Toucan; and the tongue of a crow. The
size of the body is nearly that of a Crow, the bill is large, and
bent in the upper mandible; the space round the eye, is of a
bright red; the head, neck, body and wings, are of a lead colour;
and the thighs and tail have black markings on them.</p>
<p align="center"><small>TABUAN PARROT.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> Parrot measures in length 18 inches, the
head, neck and under parts, are of a rich scarlet colour; the
wings and upper part of the body is green; crossing the upper
parts of the wing coverts, is a bar of yellowish green, more
glossy than in any other part; the bottom of the back and rump is
blue; there is a patch of blue at the lower part of the back of
the neck, dividing the scarlet and green; the tail which is long
and of an olive brown colour; the bill is reddish, and the legs
nearly black.</p>
<p>The female is chiefly green. The under parts, head and neck
olive brown; belly red; rump blue, upper part green, and dusky
underneath.</p>
<p align="center"><small>BLACK SWAN.</small></p>
<p><small>OF</small> this bird* it is requisite to say but
little, as the reader of the history of New South Wales can be no
stranger to it: all that need be said is, that in dignity and
grace it is equal to the European Swan. Its colour is of a sooty
blackness, except on the long wing feathers which are white. The
beak is of a fine red colour with a black tip, and on the upper
mandible is a spot of yellow. The native name of the bird is
Mulgo.</p>
<p align="center"><small>[* An exact representation of the
<a href="#cover">Black Swan</a> is given in the title
page.]</small></p>
<p>Their flesh is esteemed even by those not natives of the
country.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE YELLOW EARED
FLY-CATCHER.</small></p>
<p>Is of a brown plumage differing in depth of colour. Under each
eye is a streak, which growing, wider reaches the ear, and is of
a fine yellow colour; the edges of the wing feathers are a slight
yellow: the under part of the bird is white growing dusky about
the chin and throat; the bill is broad at the bottom and of a
pale colour; the tail is long, and when spread seems concave at
the tip; the legs are dusky. In size the Yellow eared Fly-catcher
of New South Wales resembles the English Martin.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic11" id="id13"></a><img alt="" src=
"1203391h-images/pic11.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">Mountain Eagle</p>
<p align="center"><small>MOUNTAIN EAGLE.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> Mountain Eagle of New South Wales is a fine
majestic bird, which stands three feet high on the ground.</p>
<p>The colour of its feathers are brown; the feet pale yellow,
and the talons which it uses with the greatest force*, are black;
the beak is of a yellowish horn colour, and the crest which is
constituted by a few feathers, has a yellow sandy appearance.</p>
<p><small>[* One taken by Captain Waterhouse while on an
excursion by water, drove its talons through a seaman's foot,
though it Jay at the bottom of the boat with its feet
tied.]</small></p>
<p>This bird is both an object of wonder and fear among the
natives, for it frequently takes up a kangaroo, a dog, or a
sheep, and probably they have little doubt but, that if driven by
hunger and nothing else offered, the Mountain Eagle would descend
for the purpose of carrying off a native.</p>
<p align="center"><small>WATTLED BEE-EATER.</small></p>
<p><small>IN</small> size this bird must be compared to the
Missel Thrush, though larger in its proportions. The colour is
brown, but down each feather is a white line; under each eye is a
kind of wattle of an orange colour; the feathers on the top of
the head being longer than the rest, give an appearance of a
crest; the middle of the belly is yellow; and the tip of the tail
feathers are white; both legs and beak are brown.</p>
<p align="center"><small>GOLDEN-WINGED PIDGEON.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> bird is of a curious species, remarkable
for having most of the wing feathers marked with a spot of golden
yellow, changing according to the lights in which it is viewed to
green and copper bronze, and forms on the wing being closed two
bars across. The bill and legs are red; the chin and fore part of
the head are of a buff colour, and a streak of brownish red
passes each eye; the two middle feathers of the tail are lighter
than the other parts of plumage, which inclines to a dull lead
colour with a bar of black near the ends.</p>
<p align="center"><small>PORT JACKSON THRUSH.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> top of the head is of blue grey; the hind
part of the neck and the back is of a fine brown; the wings and
tail are lead colour; the under parts of the bird are white,
except part of the neck which is chocolate; the bill is of a dull
yellow, and the legs are brown.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic12" id="id14"></a><img alt="" src=

<p align="center">Emu</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE EMU.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> Emu of New South Wales has by some been
thought to resemble the Emu of India, and by others the Ostrich
of Africa, but Sir Joseph Banks is said to be of opinion, that it
is very similar to the American Ostrich.</p>
<p>The Emu of New South Wales measures from the head to the foot
from seven to eight feet, its general colour of a dull red brown;
on the neck is a short space of purple; the feathers are all
small and a few like hairs hang under the beak, and some few
others grow erect on the top of the head; the legs are of a blue
grey, and the iris is a bright red.</p>
<p align="center"><small>NEW HOLLAND CREEPER.</small></p>
<p>The colours of this bird are black and white; the bill is
pointed and like the legs, dusky; the sides, belly, neck and
breast are streaked with white, and over each eye is a streak of
the same colour; the sides of the neck, and part of the back have
the same kind of markings; the quills and tail feathers have
yellow edges, and several of the outer ones are spotted within
with white towards the tips; the size of the bird is nearly the
same as the Nightingale.</p>
<p>The female in colours resembles the male, only they are not so
bright; It has no white on the front of the head, that colour
being confined to the parts round the cheeks; the yellow on the
wings and tail incline rather to an olive colour; a rich brown
colour is dispersed over the shoulders, which terminates about
half way down the back.</p>
<p>The bill, legs, and indeed the general form of the female is
considerably stouter than that of the male.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE KNOB FRONTED BEE EATER.</small></p>
<p>Is about the size of a Blackbird; the plumage is generally
brown above and white beneath; the head and upper parts of the
neck is very thinly covered with narrow feathers like hairs, but
the fore part of the neck and breast are furnished with long
ones, pointed at the ends and of a white colour; the bill is pale
and about an inch in length, and on the forehead just at the base
of the bill is a short blunt knob of a brownish colour, in length
about a quarter of an inch; the tongue which is nearly as long as
the bill, is bristly at the end; the legs are brown.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE GREAT BROWN KING'S
FISHER.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> bird is eighteen inches in length; the
bill black above and white, beneath; the feathers narrow and
long, so as to form a crest, they are of brown colours streaked
with a paler brown; the back and wings brown; the lower part of
the back and rump pale blue-green; the outer edges of the quills
blue within and the tips black; on the wing covert is a patel of
glossy blue-green, and the tail is barred with ferruginous and
steel black glossed with purple, the end for an inch, white; the
under part of the body is white, transversely streaked with dusty
lines; the legs are yellow, and the claws black.</p>
<p align="center"><small>PENNATION PARROT.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> body of this bird is crimson; the feathers
on the back are black; the chin, throat, and wings blue, with a
line of a paler colour down the middle; the tail is long and
blue, with the ends of a pale colour.</p>
<p>The female is green on the upper parts of the neck and body,
and a patch of the same colour under each eye; the throat and
chin are blue; the lower part of neck, breast and rump are red;
the belly on the middle is dusky green; the tail dark blue
fringed with chestnut; the other parts of the wing are dark
blue.</p>
<p align="center"><small>MOTACILLA, OR WARBLER.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> is the same size as the superb warbler, to
which it has most certainly great affinity, but the tail is not
cuneated at the end. The upper parts of this bird are brown, but
very pale beneath, with a broad band of deeper brown towards the
tip of the tail.</p>
<p align="center"><small>GREEN PARROQUET.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> green Parroquet has a long tail; the
feathers round the beak, and the base of those in the tail, are
red. The beak is of a brownish yellow; the feet are dusky; the
tail feathers are yellow, except at the base; the wing feathers
are dusky at the interior margins.</p>
<p align="center"><small>RED SHOULDERED PARROQUET.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> bird is from ten to twelve inches in
length; the general colour is a fine green, with the outer edge
of the wing near the shoulders blue; on the sides of the body is
a patch of red, and round the beak are a few feathers of the same
colour; the long feathers of the wings are of a deep blue-black,
edged with yellow; the tail is of a very deep ferruginous colour
towards the base, but each feather is tipt with blue; the feet
and bill are of a pale brown.</p>
<p align="center"><small>SOUTHERN MOTACILLA.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> bird in size resembles the Motacilla Flava
of Linn&aelig;us, or yellow water wag-tail, but is much stouter
made. The beak is pale, and the legs are brown; the two middle
tail feathers are marked with white at the ends; the general
colour of the bird is ash-coloured on the upper part, and yellow
beneath.</p>
<p align="center"><small>SACRED KINGS FISHER.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> bird is about the size of a thrush, and
measures nearly ten inches in length; the top of the head is blue
and crested; the sides of the head, and back part of it, over the
eye from the nostrils, a rusty coloured streak; the chin, middle
part of the neck, and under part of the belly, buff colour; the
plumage on its upper part is blue; the beginning part of the neck
is black, of which colour are the inner sides of the tail
feathers, the external parts only being blue. The base of the
under jaw is whitish; the legs are brown.</p>
<p align="center"><small>CRESTED WHITE COCKATOO.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> bird is undoubtedly only a variety of the
Psittacus Cristatus of Linn&aelig;us, or large White Cockatoo;
the beak and legs are black, which indeed seems the case with all
the varieties; the crest is yellow, as well as the under parts of
the tail and wings; the other parts are of a dusky white.</p>
<p>From the great variety of the feathered tribe I have
described, and which are indeed only a few of the many daily
seen, it will appear evident, that New South Wales is richly
stored with some of the most beautiful works of the creation.<br>

<p align="center">SNAKES.</p>
<p align="center"><small>BLUE SNAKE.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> blue snake is about three feet and a half
long, coated with rather large scales. The general proportion of
this snake is nearly the same as the common English snake styled
by Linn&aelig;us Coluber Notrix.*</p>
<p><small>[* The serpents I have described are but a few of the
many which inhabit the country: none of these are poisonous, and
are only the most remarkable because the most
beautiful.]</small></p>

<p align="center">Blue Snake; Black and White Snake</p>
<p align="center"><small>BLACK AND WHITE SNAKE.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> black and white Snake is very short, being
only fifteen inches long, and from the head to the tail are
alternate bars of black and white.</p>
<p align="center"><small>YELLOW SNAKE.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> yellow snake is from three to four feet
long, very slender; its general colour is a yellow tawny colour,
with many irregular indistinct bars of a dark brown hue.</p>
<p align="center"><small>BROWN AND YELLOW SNAKE.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> snake is eight feet long; the belly is of
a yellowish colour; the other parts are of a dark brown, with
many spots of dull yellow; the scales are very small in
proportion to the size of the animal, and the tail tapers to the
end.<br>

<br>
<p align="center">LIZARDS.</p>
<p align="center"><small>VARIEGATED LIZARD.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> Lizard is so nearly like the Lacerta
Monitor of, or Monitory Lizard of Linn&aelig;us, as to leave but
very little doubt whether it is any thing more than a variety of
that species; the length of the body is fifteen inches, and the
tail is still longer; the colour is black with yellow spots and
streaks in a transverse direction; but those parts yellow in
some, are white in others.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE BROAD TAILED LIZARD.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> species is five inches long with a
proportionate head; the upper part is beset with numerous
tubercles, which in those parts towards the head particularly are
lengthened into points; the under part is of a pale colour,
nearly white; the upper part is of a dusky grey colour and very
rough; it has a depressed lanceolate tail, nearly spiny on the
margin.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE SCINCORD, OR SCINC-FORMED
LIZARD.</small></p>
<p>The tail is considerably longer than that of the Scincuses,
though by no means so taper; the colour of this animal is an iron
grey of various shades, in different parts appearing like stripes
across the back and tail; strong scales cover both body and feet;
on each foot the toes are regular and in the same numbers on each
foot, and on each toe is a sharp nail. Each toe is covered with a
very strong coat of scales.</p>
<p>Directly within the anterior edge of the opening of the ear is
a membrane, that covers nearly one third of it, which is
scolloped on the loose edge; the teeth form a row on both sides
of each jaw, which increase in size as they receed; they are
short above the gum and rounded off, so that they are calculated
rather for bruising and breaking than cutting.</p>
<p>What renders this animal remarkable, is, it has two tails
which form a kind of fork.</p>
<p align="center"><small>MURICATED LIZARD.</small></p>
<p><small>THE</small> Muricated Lizard is nearly allied to the L.
Agames and Calotes. Its length exceeds a foot; the tail is very
long, and every part of the animal is covered with scales of a
sharp form, marked with a prominent line on the surface; near the
head these scales run into a sort of spine; the feet are
furnished with claws.</p>
<p>The colour is a brownish grey, and the animal on the upper
part is marked with dusky bars, which arc most visible on the
legs and tail.</p>
<p align="center"><small>RIBBONED LIZARD.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> Lizard appears the most elegant of the
species; its length is about six inches and a half; its markings
are paralleled lines of alternately black and white from the head
to the base of the tail, the continuation of the tail is of
ferruginous colour, of which indeed there are some few spots on
the back; the lower parts of the body is of a pale yellow hue
inclining rather to white; the tail which is long is round and
tapers to the end.</p>
<p align="center"><small>BLUE FROG.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> curious Frog which is of a fine blue, has
a number of greyish specks beneath. It is the size of the common
English Frog; it has four legs and feet, with four toes on each
foot, and the toes on the two hind feet are webbed.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE WHITE JOINTED SPIDER.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> Spider is of a fine clear chestnut colour,
except on the body which is a pale brown with a blackish fasciae
reaching down about half way from its upper part; the eyes are
eight in number and placed like those of the American Spider; it
has a curiously lucid surface on its thorax and legs, the latter
of which are furnished with long spines, and the animal has the
power of either elevating or depressing at pleasure, and from an
orifice at the top of each fang, it is evident this Spider
poisons its prey previous to finally destroying it.<br>

<p align="center">FISH.</p>
<p>To give any accurate idea of all the finny inhabitants of the
deep surrounding New South Wales, is a task to be effected at
some far remote period. Little indeed is the information I can
give on this head at present, but that little is from the first
authority.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE COMPRESSED SPARUS.</small></p>
<p>Is about six inches in length, of a silvery white colour with
a compressed body, as intimated by its name, and covered with
scales of a moderate size.</p>
<p align="center"><small>CYPRINACEOUS LABRUS.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> Fish which is termed Labrus Corpore
Albescente. Labrus with whitish body, it is only about six inches
in length with large scales, and as before observed is of a
whitish colour.</p>
<p align="center"><small>DOUBTFUL LOPHIUS.</small></p>
<p>The Doubtful Lophius is about six inches long, and of a very
deep brown colour, nearly black; the mouth which is very wide, is
furnished with several rows of teeth both slender and sharp; the
brown on the belly is paler than that on the back
considerably.</p>
<p align="center"><small>BALISTES GRANULATA.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> Fish has a two spined anterior dorsal fin,
and the body covered with granules, and is allied to the Balistes

<p>As to do justice to merit should ever be the object of an
Author, I shall out of respect to Sir Joseph Banks, describe
those productions of nature, which from the same cause
Linn&aelig;us has named Banksia.</p>
<p>Four sorts of Banksia are described in the Supplementum
Plantarum of Linn&aelig;us, of which the Banksia Serrata is the
principal.</p>
<p align="center"><small>BANKSIA SERRATA.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> is the most stately of the genus. Its
trunk is thick and rugged. Leaves alternate, standing thick about
the ends of the branches on short footstalks, narrow, obtuse,
strongly serrated, smooth and of a bright green colour above,
beneath opaque and whitish, with a strong rib running through
their middle. A very large cylindrical spike of flowers
terminates each branch. Most of the flowers are abortive, a few
only in each spike producing ripe seed. The form of the capsules
may be understood from the figure, which represents a whole spike
in fruit, about a quarter the natural size. The capsules are
covered with thick down. The plant, when it is in flower, shews
the curved position in which the style is held by the corolla;
the increase of the former in length being greater and more rapid
than that of the latter.</p>
<p align="center"><small>BANKSIA PYRIFORMIS.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> species was unknown to Linn&aelig;us; and
Gaertner has given no specific character of it. It is however the
Banksia with solitary flowers, ovate downy capsules, and
lance-shaped entire smooth leaves.</p>
<p>The capsules are larger than in any other known species. In
the figure they are represented considerably smaller than the
life.</p>
<p align="center"><small>BANKSIA GIBBOSA.</small></p>
<p>Or Banksia with solitary flowers; ovate, tumid, rugged
capsules; and cylindrical leaves.</p>
<p><small>THE</small> leaves are very peculiar, being perfectly
cylindrical, about two inches long and one line in diameter,
pale, green and smooth.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE PEPPERMINT TREE.</small></p>
<p>This tree grows to the height of more than an hundred feet,
and is above thirty feet in circumference. The bark is very
smooth, like that of the poplar. The younger branches are long
and slender, angulated near the top, but as they grow older the
angles disappear. Their bark is smooth, and of a reddish brown.
The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, pointed, very entire,
smooth on both sides, and remarkably unequal, or oblique, at
their base; the veins alternate and not very conspicuous. The
whole surface of both sides of the leaves is marked with numerous
minute resinous spots, in which the essential oil resides. The
footstalks are about half an inch in length, round on the under
side, angular above, quite smooth. The flowers grow in clusters,
from six to eight in each, sessile and conglomerated. These
clusters are supported on angular alternate foot-stalks, which
form a kind of panicle. Each capsule is about the size of an
hawthorn berry, globular, but as it were cut off at the top,
rugged on the outside, hard and woody, and of a dark brown
colour. At the top is a large orifice, which shews the internal
part of the capsule divided into four cells, and having a square
column in the center, from which the partitions of the cell
arise. These partitions extend to the rim of the capsule, and
terminate in four small projections, which look like the teeth of
a calyx. The seeds are numerous, small, and angular.</p>
<p>The name of Peppermint Tree was given to this plant by the
celebrated Mr. White, on account of the very great resemblance
between the essential oil drawn from its leaves, and that
obtained from the Peppermint which grows in England. This oil was
found by Mr. White to be much more efficacious in removing all
cholicky complaints than that of the English peppermint, which he
attributes to its being less pungent and more aromatic.</p>

<p align="center">1.Banksia Serrata 2. Banksia Pyriformis<br>
3. Peppermint Tree 4. Tea Tree<br>
5. Yellow Gum Tree</p>
<p>"This tree appears", says Mr. White, "to be undoubtedly of the
same genus with that cultivated in some green-houses in England,
which Mr. L'Heritier has described in his Sertum Anglicum by the
name of <i>Eucalyptus obliqua</i>, though it is commonly called
in the gardens <i>Metrofideros obliqua</i>; but we dare not
assert it to be the same species, nor can this point be
determined till the flowers and every part of both be seen and
compared; we have compared the best specimens we could procure of
each, and find no specific difference. The Eucalyptus obliqua
has, when dried, an aromatic flavour somewhat similar to our
plant. We have remarked, indeed, innumerable minute white spots,
besides the resinous ones, on both surfaces of the leaves in some
specimens of the garden plant, which are not to be seen in ours,
and the branches of the former are rough, with small scaly
tubercles. But how far these are constant we cannot tell. The
obliquity in the leaves, one side being shorter at the base than
the other, as well as somewhat narrower all the way up, as in the
Begonia nitida of the Hortus Kewensis, is remarkable in both
plants."</p>
<p align="center"><small>TEA TREE OF NEW SOUTH WALES. MELALEUCA?
TRINERVIA.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> is a small shrub, very much branched. The
bark full of longitudinal fissures, and easily separated from the
branches. Leaves on short footstalks, alternate, lanceolate,
pointed, intire, about three quarters of an inch in length,
smooth on both sides, marked with three longitudinal ribs, and
reticulated with transverse veins; they are also full of resinous
spots, the seat of an aromatic essential oil. It most nearly
approaches the Leptospermum virgatum of Forster, referred by the
younger Linn&aelig;us, perhaps improperly, to Melaleuca. At least
it may safely be determined to belong to the same genus with the
Melaleuca virgata Linn. Supp. though a distinct species. The
specific difference between them is, that the leaves of this
plant have three ribs, whereas M. virgata has leaves perfectly
destitute of ribs or veins. Hence it is judged the figure and
description of Rumphius, Herb. Amboin. V. 2. t. 18. to belong
rather to this Tea Tree, than to M. virgata; and if this
conjecture be right, the plants are still further distinguished
by the inflorescence, which in M. virgata is an umbel, whereas in
the figure above mentioned the flowers are solitary.</p>
<p align="center"><small>SWEET TEA PLANT.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> is a tree or shrub, from whose leaves it
is judged to belong to the genus of Smilax. The leaves are about
two inches long, ovato-lanceolate, pointed, entire, marked with
three longitudinal ribs, and many transverse elevated veins,
smooth and shining above, glaucous beneath, with a thick
cartilaginous edge of the substance of the ribs. The leaves have
the taste of liquorice root accompanied with bitter. They make a
kind of tea, not unpleasant to the taste, and good for the
scurvy. The plant promises much in the last respect, from its
bitter as a tonic, as well as the quantity of saccharine matter
it contains.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE RED GUM TREE.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> is a very large and lofty tree, much
exceeding the English oak in size. The wood is extremely brittle,
and, from the large quantity of resinous gum which it contains,
is of little use but for firewood. The flowers grow in little
clusters, or rather umbels, about ten in each, and every flower
has a proper partial foot-stalk, about a quarter of an inch in
length, besides the general one. The general footstalk is
remarkably compressed, and the partial ones are so in some
degree. The flowers are yellowish, and of a singular structure.
The calyx is hemispherical, perfectly intire in the margin, and
afterwards becomes the capsule. On the top of the calyx, rather
within the margin, stands a conical pointed calyptra, which is of
the same colour with the calyx, and about as long as that and the
footstalk taken together. This calyptra, which is the essential
mark of the genus, and differs from that of the Eucalyptus
obliqua of L'Heritier only in being conical and acute, instead of
hemispherical, is perfectly entire, and never splits or divides,
though it is analogous to the corolla of other plants. When it is
removed, a great number of red stamina are seen standing in a
conical mass, which before the calypta is taken off, are
completely covered by it, and filled in the inside. The
Anther&aelig; are small and red. In the centre of these stamina
is a single style or pointal, rising a little above them, and
terminated by a blunt stigma. The stamina are very resinous and
aromatic. They are inserted into the margin of the calyx, so that
the genus is properly placed by Mr. L'Heritier in the class
Icosandria. These stamina and style being removed, and the germen
cut across about the middle of the calyx, it appears to be
divided into three cells, each containing the rudiments of one or
more seeds.</p>
<p>On making incisions in the trunk of this tree, large
quantities of red resinous juice are obtained, sometimes even
more than sixty gallons from a single tree. When this juice is
dried, it becomes a very powerfully astringent gum-resin, of a
red colour, much resembling that known in the shops by the name
of Kino, and, for all medical purposes, fully as efficacious. Mr.
White administered it to a great number of patients in the
dysentery, which prevailed much soon after the landing of the
convicts, and in no one instance found it to fail. This gum-resin
dissolves almost entirely in spirit of wine, to which it gives a
blood-red tincture. Water dissolves about one-sixth part only,
and the watery solution is of a bright red. Both these solutions
are powerfully astringent.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE YELLOW RESIN TREE.</small></p>
<p><small>THIS</small> is about the size of an English walnut
tree. Its trunk grows pretty straight for about fourteen or
sixteen feet, after which it brandies out into long spiral
leaves, which hang down on all sides, and resemble those of the
larger kinds of grass or sedge. From the center of the head of
leaves arises a single footstalk; eighteen or twenty feet in
height, perfectly straight and erect, very much resembling the
sugar cane, and terminating in a spike of a spiral form, not
unlike an ear of wheat. This large stem or footstalk is used by
the natives for making spears and fish gigs, being pointed with
the teeth of fish or other animals.</p>
<p>But the most valuable produce of this plant seems to be its
resin, the properties of which vie with those of the most
fragrant balsams. This resin exudes spontaneously from the trunk;
the more readily, if incisions are made in its bark. It is of a
yellow colour; fluid at first, but being inspissated in the sun,
it acquires a solid form. Burnt on hot coals, it emits a smell
very much resembling that of a mixture of balsam of Tolu and
benzoin, somewhat approaching to storax. It is perfectly soluble
in spirit of wine, but not in water, nor even in essential oil of
turpentine, unless it be digested in a strong heat. The varnish
which it makes with either is very weak, and of little use. With
respect to its medicinal qualities, Mr. White has found it, in
many cases, a good pectoral medicine, and very balsamic. It is
not obtainable in so great abundance as the red gum produced by
the Eucalyptus resinifera.</p>
<p>Thus having described the principal natural productions, I
shall resume the history of the country: as to notice the endless
variety of flowers, &amp;c. &amp;c. would exceed the limits of my
plan, or indeed my wish.<br>

<p>[The following inserted into 2nd Edition]</p>
<br>
<hr>
<blockquote>[It will appear in the sequel that the improvement of
the colony was not in that state of forwardness that might have
been wished; and that it probably sustained no small loss by the
removal of the Governor, Colonel Collins, who died at Van
Diemen's Land in March 1810.<br>
<br>
Col. David Collins was the eldest son of Gen. Arthur Tooker
Collins, and Harriet Fraser, of Pack, in the King's county,
Ireland, and grandson of Arthur Collins, Esq. author of the
Peerage of England, &amp;c. He was born on the 3d of March, 1756,
and received a liberal education under the Rev. Mr. Marshall,
Master of the Grammar School at Exeter, where his father resided.
In 1770 he was appointed lieutenant in the Marines; and, in 1772,
was with the late Admiral M'Bride, in the Southampton frigate,
when the unfortunate Matilda Queen of Denmark was rescued from
the dangers that awaited her by the energy of the British
government, and conveyed to a place of safety in the king her
brother's Hanoverian dominions. On that occasion he commanded the
guard that received her Majesty, and had the honour of kissing
her hand. In 1775, he was at the battle of Bunker's Hill; in
which the first battalion of Marines, to which he belonged, so
signally distinguished itself, having its commanding officer, the
gallant Major Pitcairne, and a great many officers and men,
killed in storming the redoubt, besides a very large proportion
of wounded. In 1777, he was Adjutant of the Chatham Division;
and, in 1782, Captain of Marines on board the Courageux, of 74
guns, commanded by the late Lord Mulgrave, and participated in
the partial action that took place with the enemy's fleet, when
Lord Howe relieved Gibraltar. Reduced to half-pay at the peace of
1782, he resided at Rochester, in Kent (having previously married
an American lady, who survives him, but without issue); and, on
its being determined to found a colony, by sending convicts to
Botany Bay, he was appointed Judge-Advocate to the intended
settlement, and in that capacity sailed with Governor Phillip in
May 1787 (who moreover appointed him his secretary), which
situation he filled with the greatest credit to himself and
advantage to the Colony, until his return to England in 1797. The
History of the Settlement, which he soon after published,
followed by a second volume, a work abounding with information,
highly interesting, and written with the utmost simplicity, will
be read and referred to as a book of authority, as long as the
Colony exists whose name it bears. The appointment of
Judge-Advocate, however, proved eventually injurious to his real
interests. While absent, he had been passed over when it came to
his turn to be put on full pay; nor was he permitted to return to
England to reclaim his rank in the corps: nor could he ever
obtain any effectual redress, but was afterwards compelled to
come in as a junior captain of the corps, though with his proper
rank in the army. The difference this made in regard to his
promotion was, that he died a captain instead of a
colonel-commandant, his rank in the army being merely brevet. He
had then the mortification of finding that, after ten years'
distinguished service in the infancy of a colony, and to the
sacrifice of every real comfort, his only reward had been the
loss of many years' rank, a vital injury to an officer. A remark
which his wounded feelings wrung from him at the close of the
second volume of his History of the Settlement, appears to have
awakened the sympathy of those in power; and he was, almost
immediately after its publication, offered the government of the
projected Settlement on Van Diemen's Land, which he accepted, and
sailed once more for that quarter of the globe, where he founded
his new colony; struggled with great difficulties, which he
overcame; and, after remaining there eight years, was enjoying
the flourishing state his exertions had produced, when he died
suddenly, after a few days' confinement from a slight cold, on
the 24th March, 1810. His person was remarkably handsome, and his
manners extremely prepossessing; while to a cultivated
understanding, and an early fondness for the Belles Lettres, he
joined the most cheerful and social disposition. Plow he was
esteemed by the inhabitants of the Colony over which he presided,
will appear from the following extract of a letter announcing;
his decease. By the death of Col. Collins "this Colony has
sustained a loss it will take a number of years to get over. I
have known and served with him from the first establishment of
the Colony; and, when I speak the feelings of my heart on this
melancholy occasion, I am sure that it is not my single voice,
but that of every department whatsoever in the Settlement, who,
with the most heartfelt regret, universally acknowledge him to
have been the father and friend of all."]</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h3>
<p>At the commencement of the century, it would be indeed
fortunate, if the colony had been established sufficiently, to
have placed a probability of want at defiance, but this was by no
means the case; for the salt provisions even in store at the
beginning of the year 1801, were found to be so short, as to make
it necessary to send a vessel to Otaheite, for the purpose of
salting pork for the use of the Colony; but an obstacle of the
greatest importance in such an undertaking, prevented its being
immediately put in execution: namely, there was no salt to send
for the purpose wanted, in the Colony; providentially, however, a
vessel put in to port Jackson, from the Cape Verde Islands, of
the master of which, the Governor was enabled to purchase a
quantity, amounting to nearly fifteen tons; in consequence of
which, a ship was dispatched, under the command of Lieut. Scott,
completely equipped and furnished with every requisite
instruction, to effect the object of his mission, and in addition
to these, he took a letter from the Governor to Pomarre, the King
of Otaheite earnestly requesting him, tip afford Mr. Scott every
protection and assistance in his power, to forward the completion
of the business for which he was sent; for the Governor was
perfectly aware, that although provisions might be sent out from
England for the use of the settlements, yet accidents might
retard or prevent their reaching New South Wales by the time
those in the stores were expended. In addition to this request to
the King of Otaheite, the Governor urged particularly, that the
missionaries residing at that place might receive every
attention, and endeavoured to convince Pomarre, that his majesty
would, by the good conduct shown to these people, judge of those
of Otaheite. But probably Mr. Scott took with him, far more
powerful arguments, that those in the Governor's letter, being
accompanied by a plentiful assortment of yellow and red cloths,
knives, shirts, tomahawkes, axes, jackets, scissars, &amp;c.
&amp;c. for the people in general, and for his Majesty of
Otaheite, who was known to be by no means averse to presents. Mr.
Scott was furnished with a mantle and other dresses, ornamented
with feathers, six musquets and ammunition, and thus equipped,
could not well fail of success: and well indeed would it be, if
objects of as much national advantage could be procured from all
nations, as that for the liberty of salting provisions at
Otaheite, was to New South Wales, at the expense of so small a
present.</p>
<p>Least however, any accident should happen, the Governor
forwarded instructions to Norfolk Island, for salting all the
provisions that could by any means be spared, for the settlers,
convicts, &amp;c. at Sydney.</p>
<p>The Governor, ever anxious to prevent any want falling on the
inhabitants, had entered into a contract with a merchant in
India, for a cargo of cattle and rice, fully satisfied, that from
the period of its arrival, the country would be unquestionably
competent to supply its own wants, as far as related to grain and
cattle at least, as the stock of cattle was now become very
considerable, even independent of the wild cattle in the woods;
and the promising crops of grain, now seemed enough to defy any
prospect of want when gathered.</p>
<p>The cattle in the woods, were now to be esteemed seriously
increased; inasmuch, that from the power of their numbers, and
additional furiosity, all attempts to take them alive, was become
dangerous, and indeed almost absurd; and as they had strayed to
the western mountains, they had gained nearly inaccessable
retreats. Thus situated, it is by no means improbable but they
may at no very distant period, become objects of pleasure in the
pursuit; and by their eventual deaths, furnish a constant supply
of food for the settlements, and certainly in a chace of this
kind, far more real pleasure may be found, than in the pursuit of
the timid hare, which, even when taken, can scarce serve half a
dozen persons for a single meal.</p>
<p>On the 4th of June, 1801, his Majesty's birthday was
celebrated with additional marks of distinction, as intelligence
had been received of the union of England and Ireland; in
consequence of which, on that occasion, the union standard was
unfurled for the first time in New South Wales, and the Irish in
confinement, were set at liberty.</p>

<p>The brig Lady Nelson, of only 60 tons burthen, commanded by
Lieut. Grant, arrived without her meeting with any accident, in
December 1801. Her commander, perfectly acquainted with her good
qualities, made the land in latitude 38&deg; 00' South, coasting
for some distance toward the Eastward, and sailing through Bass
Strait, in his way to Port Jackson.</p>
<p>In this passage of the Lady Nelson through the Strait, nothing
new was added to the discoveries previously made by Capt.
Flinders and Mr. Bass, in the Norfolk, except that of having made
the land about four degrees further to the Westward than seen by
those gentlemen.</p>
<p>A serious accident happened by a fire, which consumed a stack
that contained 1000 bushels of grain, the property of an
individual; and though there was every reason to suspect that it
was occasioned by some incendiary, it could not be discovered,
and indeed it was very difficult to form an idea with any degree
of certainty, whether it was effected by a native or one of our
own people, as the former were continually receiving what they
deemed sufficient cause for the commission of every depredation
and too many of the latter were ever ready to commit any
vileness, without any provocation whatever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, the natural ignorance of the natives,
and the refined iniquity of the convicts, were not the only
obstacles the colony had to encounter. Neither was the occasional
intense heat to which the country was subject; for another
overflow of the Hawkesbury inundated the country, and destroyed
the farms and property of the settlers, who now abandoned
themselves to despair, and quitted their possessions.</p>
<p>Thus the close of the year 1801, and the opening of 1802,
afford little or no variety to the general routine of occurrences
which daily pass in all settled countries, except that New South
Wales is, and I fear ever will be, while a receptacle for
convicts, more particularly marked by a repetition of crimes and
punishments, than any quarter of the globe.</p>
<p>The natives have now nearly ceased giving any material trouble
to the colonists, unless aggravated, and in such cases they will
seek their own modes of redress as long as they exist in their
savage state of nature, and there can be little doubt but the
causes which stimulate them will never cease.</p>
<p>The Lady Nelson brig having been in Bass Strait, surveyed
Western port, and found a very good harbour. She also went, in
company with the Francis schooner, to Hunter river, where they
took in between them 45 tons of coal, which were exchanged with
the master of the Cornwallis for a quantity of nails and iron,
articles of which the colonists stood in the greatest need, and
thus the natural produce of the country contributed to its wants
for the first time.</p>
<p>As the Francis was now nearly worn out, the Governor purchased
a vessel called the Harbinger, to go to and from Norfolk Island,
the service of the Porpoise, which had for some time been used,
being required for longer voyages. The Supply, though long since
condemned, was fitting up as a hulk for incorrigible convicts;
for though unfit for every other purpose, it might still be thus
employed, and be the means of affording another opportunity to
the numerous still offending inhabitants of the country, to
return to a proper line of conduct, who it is even still to be
lamented, continue equally unmoved, either by the fear of
punishment, or the hope of reward, careless alike to the pain of
the former or the pleasures of the latter, they follow the
dictates of their own vile inclinations, and if impeded by the
arm of justice, they suffer the inflicted sentence with that
hardened bravado which represses every sensation of that pity
which is an honour to human nature, when called forth into action
by objects deserving commiseration. This reflection, perhaps,
bears more strongly on my mind, having been this day favoured, by
an officer of distinction, with the very interesting, though
dreadful narrative of facts, relative to the sufferings of
several persons who sailed with Mr. Bampton in the Shah
Hormuzear, on the 19th of April 1793, in company with the
Chesterfield*, and I know no better way of stating the horrid
affair than in the words of the narrative:</p>
<p align="center"><small>[* Vide page 117. [Chapter
V]]</small></p>
<p>"On the 29th of June 1793, an island was discovered from on
board the Shah Hormuzear, then in company with the Chesterfield,
in latitude 9&deg; 28' S. and 146&deg; 57' E. longitude, by good
observation.</p>
<p>"This new discovered land is called Tate's Island, in honour
of Mr. Tate, of Bombay.</p>
<p>"On the 1st of July, the ships anchored in nine fathom water,
about twelve miles to the Eastward of Tate's Island; when it was
proposed by Capt. Bampton, of the Hormuzear, to send a boat from
each ship to sound two reefs of rocks, extending to the Northward
from the North point of the Southward from the South point.</p>
<p>"The boats were accordingly dispatched; and when they had
approached within about half a mile of the island, they perceived
that the island was inhabited.</p>
<p>"The natives made signs to the seamen to come ashore, but the
day being then far advanced, and not having a sufficient quantity
of arms and ammunition in case they were attacked, they thought
it most prudent to make the best of their way back to the
ships.</p>
<p>"When the natives saw they were about to return, many of them
leaped into the water and swam after the boats, while others of
them launched two or three canoes, and soon came up Math them.
They bartered bows, arrows, and spears, for small penknives,
beads, &amp;c. Some of the natives went afterwards on board the
ships, and traded there in the same articles.</p>
<p>"They are a stout well-made people, woolly-headed, and in
stature resemble the description given of the New Guineas, as
well as in complexion. They appeared to be humane and hospitable
people from their behaviour while on board.</p>
<p>"After they had left the Hormuzear, it was perceived that they
had stolen a hatchet, and several small articles, which might
have been expected, as it is common amongst most savages.</p>
<p>"On the 2d of July, it was proposed by Captains Bampton and
Holt to man one boat from the two ships, and send her ashore, to
see if there was any water to be had, and also for a party to go
up to the highest point of the island, to see how far the land
extended to the Westward, as the ships were then looking out for
Forest's Streights.</p>
<p>"Mr. Shaw, chief officer of the Chesterfield, was appointed to
this duty. Capt. Hill, of the New South Wales corps, Mr. Carter,
purser of the Hormuzear, and Mr. Haskett, passenger, proposed to
accompany him, in order to make some observations on the soil,
produce, and inhabitants, of this new-discovered island.</p>
<p>"On the 3d in the morning, these gentlemen having provided
themselves with presents for the natives, consisting of
penknives, scissars, razors, beads, &amp;c. and with plenty of
arms and ammunition, in case of attack, embarked on board a boat,
and at noon reached the island.</p>
<p>"The natives received them very kindly, and conducted the boat
to a convenient place for landing. After they had gone ashore,
and distributed some presents amongst the natives, which they
appeared to be very much pleased with, it was proposed, that
Messrs. Shaw, Carter, and Haskett, should proceed to the top of a
high point of land, and that Capt. Hill should stay by the boat
with the four seamen.</p>
<p>"They accordingly armed themselves with a musquet each, and a
sufficient quantity of powder and ball to begin their journey
properly accoutred.</p>
<p>"There were by this time great numbers of the natives, men,
women, and children, assembled round them, the men and children
quite naked, and the women with no other covering than a leaf
over such parts as nature had taught them to conceal.</p>
<p>"The gentlemen, when properly equipped, made signs to them
that they were in want of water, on which, with the greatest
cheerfulness, they conducted them to an excellent spring of
water, frequently kissing the hands of the party on the way,
crying out "Wabba! wabba!" which they supposed to be water in
their language.</p>
<p>"After the gentlemen had examined the water, they made signs
of being desirous to ascend the hill; the natives readily
conceived their meaning, offered to conduct them, and appeared to
be very happy in the strangers' company.</p>
<p>"They had proceeded about three quarters of a mile up the
hill, when they were conducted to a level spot of cleared ground,
where grass was growing, and several young plantain trees
springing up in the midst of it, and the number of birds
chirruping among the bushes that surrounded this spot made it
appear romantic.</p>
<p>"Here they were invited to sit down, to which Messrs. Carter,
and Shaw consented; but on Mr. Haskett's saying 'he suspected
they had some designs on them', Mr. Carter replied, that he
believed them to be a set of innocent creatures, and made signs
for something to drink.</p>
<p>"A boy was immediately dispatched, and shortly after returned
with two cocoa nuts, which were given them to drink. After Mr.
Carter had drank he got up and gave his musket to Mr. Haskett to
hold, while he took a sketch of the landscape as it then appeared
to his view.</p>
<p>"The natives seeing the two muskets in Mr. Haskett's hands,
desired to hold them for him; he gave Mr. Carter's to one of
them, but kept his own cocked, the muzzle directed towards the
breast of him who held it.</p>
<p>"As soon as Mr. Carter had finished, he took the musket from
the native, and chid Mr. Haskett for his fear, mentioning
repeatedly that they were an innocent race of men, and Mr. Shaw
acquiesced in his opinion.</p>
<p>"After refreshing themselves they made signs to the natives to
proceed further up the hill, which they did not seem inclined to,
but rather wished them to go down to the valley that appeared
clear and pleasant from the place they were then in, which was
surrounded by bushes and shrubs.</p>
<p>"When the natives perceived that their visitors were
determined to ascend the hill, they followed in great numbers,
hallooing and shouting most hideously on the way.</p>
<p>"Mr. Haskett strictly observed their motions; as they were
continually making signs to each other, and frequently pointing
towards him, he intimated these observations to the other
gentlemen, and begged them for God's sake to be on their guard,
for the natives were certainly bent on mischief.</p>
<p>"At length, about half past two P.M. they reached the summit
of the hill, on which they found a clear spot of ground of some
acres in extent: the natives here kissed their hands frequently,
and, very kindly to all appearance invited them to sit down and
rest themselves; which, however, they declined to do, the day
being so far spent.</p>
<p>"Here they had an opportunity of taking the view which was the
object of their journey; they saw the reefs extending as far as
the eye could reach; but no land to the Westward of the Island,
except a large sand-bank nearly even with the water's edge, and
not far from the island.</p>
<p>"At the same time they also perceived a great number of the
natives round the boat, who they supposed were trading with
Captain Hill. When they had made their observations, they began
to descend; by degrees the natives contrived to separate the
three gentlemen at eight or ten yards from each other,
insinuating themselves between them in the path, which was but
narrow, under the pretence of assisting them down the hill.</p>
<p>"Mr. Haskett perceived boys of about 14 or 15 years of age
lurking in the bushes as they passed, with bundles of spears and
arrows, of which he informed Mr. Carter, who was the foremost in
the path, and asked Mr. Shaw, who was behind them, if he saw
them? who answered them in the affirmative.</p>
<p>"Mr. Shaw begged the other gentlemen to be on their guard; and
Mr. Haskett proposed to Mr. Carter to turn all the natives before
them, as he could plainly perceive they were bent on murdering
them; but Mr. Carter said, he thought that would shew signs of
mistrust or fear, and that he thought it better to go on as they
were, and be all upon their guard.</p>
<p>"They had got down the hill the greatest part of the way in
this manner, when they were met by a very old man, who kissed Mr.
Carter's hand first, and then attempted to kiss Mr. Haskett's,
but was not permitted; he then went on and kissed Mr. Shaw's, who
was in the rear.</p>
<p>"Immediately after Mr. Haskett called out, 'They want to take
my musket from me'; and Mr. Carter exclaimed, 'My God! my God!
they have murdered me!' Mr. Haskett discharged his musket at the
next man to him; on the report of it, the natives all fled into
the bushes.</p>
<p>"Here was a horrid spectacle for Mr. Haskett to behold; Mr.
Carter lying on the ground in a gore of blood, and Mr. Shaw with
a large cut in his throat under the left jaw; but luckily they
were both able to rise and proceed down the hill with all
possible speed, firing at the natives wherever they saw them.</p>
<p>"When they arrived on the beach they called out 'Fire! fire!'
But what must have been their feelings when they perceived Capt.
Hill and one of the seamen dead upon the beach, cut and mangled
in a shocking manner; they shortly after perceived two of the
seamen floating on the water between the boat and the beach, with
their throats cut from ear to ear. After some difficulty, the
unhappy survivors made a shift to get on board the boat.</p>
<p>"They found that the natives had taken all their provisions,
boat cloaks, &amp;c. started the water out of their kegs, and
left the fourth sailor dead in the boat, cut and mangled in the
most shocking manner.</p>
<p>"They tried to get in their grapnel, but found it impossible,
it was so entangled amongst the rocks by the natives. They
therefore cut it; and Messrs. Shaw and Haskett got out two oars
and pulled off shore, whilst Mr. Carter kept the natives, off
with his musquet. But they found great difficulty in getting out
of the reach of their spears and arrows, as the wind blew fresh
on the shore.</p>
<p>"At length they found they could weather the point of the
island by hoisting the sail, which the natives most fortunately
had left behind them, and it was hoisted accordingly.</p>
<p>"Mr. Haskett bound up by the wounds of his unfortunate
comrades, with their handkerchiefs; but Mr. Carter was so weak
from the loss of blood, that he was obliged to lay down in the
bottom of the boat, while the other two were spectators of the
fate of their deceased companions.</p>
<p>"They saw very distinctly those voracious cannibals dragging
the bodies of Captain Hill and the seamen up towards large fires
prepared on the occasion, yelling and howling at the same
time.</p>
<p>"Between nine and ten they cleared the point of the island,
when it was proposed by Mr. Shaw to run under the lea of it, and
endeavour to get to the sand bank they saw from the top of the
hill; that being the only method they could take, as they might
reasonably hope, when they had not returned to the ships as
expected, boats would be sent in quest of them the next
morning.</p>
<p>"They, therefore, hauled up under the lea of it, and made fast
a club of iron wood, which the cannibals had left in the boat, to
a nine pound lead, which had also escaped their notice; these
they bent to the lead-line, and let it go, in hopes it would ride
her till the next morning.</p>
<p>"They then committed the body of the murdered seaman to the
deep, and returned thanks to the Almighty for delivering them
from those inhuman monsters.</p>
<p>"The pain the two wounded gentlemen felt, and the anxiety of
them all, deprived them of rest all that night. When day-light
appeared, they found they had drifted nearly out of sight of the
island, and to the leeward of the sand bank.</p>
<p>"It was impossible to reach the bank; they therefore consulted
respecting what was best to be done in their perilous
situation.</p>
<p>"They examined what was left in the boat, and found some
knives and scissars in the stern locker, but to their great
sorrow the compass was gone, and all their provisions and water.
There was also Mr. Haskett's great coat left in the boat, but
nothing else.</p>
<p>"Left now totally to Mr. Shaw, as to what were the best steps
to take, as the other two were neither navigators nor seamen, he
informed them, that the wind was then fair to run direct for
Timor, which lay nearly West of them, and he supposed they should
reach that island in about ten days. He could not think the ship
or boats would ever find them, and the longer they delayed
bearing away, the less able they would be to perform their voyage
without provisions and water.</p>
<p>"They therefore all agreed to stand away to the Westward, and
trust themselves to that providence who had delivered them from
the cannibals of Tate's Island.</p>
<p>"Animated with hope, they continued thus until the 5th. when
hunger and thirst preyed upon them: Mr. Carter's wound was so
painful that he begged to have it examined, which Mr. Haskett did
while Mr. Shaw held the steer oar. With great difficulty the hair
was cut from the head, which, with the handkerchief and his hair,
were entirely clotted with blood. The wound was in the back part
of the head, and appeared to have been made with a hatchet. After
having been washed with salt water, Mr. Haskett tied it up with a
piece of his shirt, and Mr. Carter found himself after the
dressing much relieved.</p>
<p>"In the afternoon they discovered land, which they supposed to
be the S.W. extremity of <i>New Guinea</i>; and on running down
towards it, perceiving a reef extending to the Southward, on
which were several negroes, whose heads only were out of the
water, they were at first mistaken for breakers above the water,
but as soon as their mistake was discovered, no one was eager to
try their friendship, the fate of their companions being too
fresh in their memory; not even though one of the negroes held up
to them a large fish; no small inducement to men who had not
broke fast for fifty-two hours.</p>
<p>"They passed the reef, however, without in the least noticing
the natives, and continued their course to the Westward, Mr. Shaw
and Mr. Haskett relieving each other every two hours at the steer
oar.</p>
<p>"On the 6th in the morning they discovered a sand bank to the
Southward, quite dry, to which they gave the name of <i>Forlorn
Hope</i>. A great number of birds being perceived about this
bank, they endeavoured to make for it, in the hopes of killing
some of them and gathering eggs, but found that the boat was
drifting to the leeward of the bank; they therefore hauled down
the sail, and endeavoured to row up to it, but found themselves
so exhausted for want of food and water, that it was impossible
to make their way towards the bank; indeed so much had that
attempt fatigued them, that it was with the greatest difficulty
they could accomplish stepping the mast and again hoisting the
sail.</p>
<p>"This fatigue, after the boat was again on her course,
occasioned them to repine and murmur at their misfortunes; but
reflection on the goodness of that providence who so far had
protected them, changed it into a perfect reliance on his
mercy.</p>
<p>"On the 7th in the morning, they found two small birds in the
boat, one of which they immediately divided into three parts,
each devouring his share with the keenest sensations of hunger:
the other bird was reserved for another meal. Even with this
small share of sustenance their spirits were considerably
raised:&mdash;.they Still steering to the Westward; the sun being
their guide by day, and the stars by night.</p>
<p>"Shortly after sunset this day they found themselves in shoal
water, and breakers all round them; however, they stood on till
about nine at night, when, having deepened to about five fathom,
it was proposed by Mr. Shaw, and agreed to, that they should come
to and rest themselves for the night.</p>
<p>"On the 8th in the morning, they discovered land on both sides
of them, which was at first very discouraging, but Mr. Shaw,
perceiving a current setting to the Westward, conjectured that
there was a passage through, and that after clearing the land
they should find an open sea, by which means they might shortly
reach Timor.</p>
<p>"Having, therefore, stood in between the islands, they found
there was a passage between them, and, not perceiving any signs
of inhabitants, agreed to land and look for water: Mr. Shaw and
Mr. Haskett accordingly landed, and finding a hole full of water,
Mr. Shaw could not refrain from drinking heartily of it; after
which, however, and that a keg of it had been filled, it was
found to be as brackish as the water alongside.</p>
<p>"They stood on through these straights, which they named
<i>God's Mercy</i>. In the afternoon Mr. Carter's wound became
very painful; and on Mr. Haskett's opening it to wash it as usual
with salt water, he found three pieces of the skull had worked
out; which circumstance, however, he did not communicate to Mr.
Carter, hut, on the contrary, gave him every assurance of its
doing well.</p>
<p>"Mr. Carter, having been very weak from the opening of the
wound, the throat of the remaining bird was cut and applied to
Mr. Carter's mouth, and, yielding a few drops of blood, gave him
great relief. They divided the bird in the same manner they had
done the other.</p>
<p>"On the morning of the ninth, Mr. Carter was so much reduced
as to be under the necessity of drinking his own urine, which
example was followed by the other two, and notwithstanding its
being disagreeable, they found great relief from it. About nine
at night Mr. Shaw and Mr. Haskett found themselves so weak and
overcome by sleep, that not being able to stand to the steer oar,
they lashed the car, and found the boat went along very steadily.
After joining in a prayer of thanksgiving to the Almighty, to
whose protection they committed themselves, they lay down and had
a refreshing sleep; occasionally, however, they could not refrain
from starting up to look out for land or danger.</p>
<p>"They resumed their labours at the oar on the morning of the
10th, which were rather increased by its blowing fresh and by a
heavy swell, which obliged them to reef the sail. It was with the
greatest difficulty Mr. Carter's wound could be dressed. Mr
Shaw's wound in the throat was by this time nearly closed up.</p>
<p>"They stood on this day without any thing material occurring;
Mr. Shaw still using all his powers to cheer them with the
assurances of seeing land in a day or two, although at the same
time he had hardly strength to haul the sheet aft, while Mr.
Haskett lashed the oar.</p>
<p>"At ten P.M. they found very shoal water, with breakers all
round, on which Mr. Haskett took the oar, while Mr. Shaw kept a
look out for a channel; in which manner they ran on for the
distance of three or four miles in not more than three or four
feet water; the sea frequently breaking over them, which rendered
Mr. Carter's situation truly deplorable, as, from extreme
weakness, he could not stir from the bottom of the boat, which
was so full of water that it was with the greatest difficulty he
could keep his head above it.</p>
<p>"To add to their distress, no sooner had they got clear of one
shoal, than from the violence of the oar beating against another,
Mr. Haskett was knocked out of the boat, which required all the
exertions of Mr. Shaw to get him in again, and which he could
have accomplished by no other mode than that of putting an oar
under his arm, and lifting him up as by a lever.</p>
<p>"On the 11th, they felt themselves much relieved by getting
clear of the shoals, and launching once more into the ocean; on
which occasion, as often before, they addressed themselves to
that Power to which they trusted for deliverance. Mr. Carter's
wound was again washed, and four pieces more taken from the
skull, when they clearly discovered, that from the blow being
given slantways down the back of the head, it had been given by a
hatchet, which they had no doubt was the one which had been
stolen from the ship. They still however assured him of its
looking well and being about to heal.</p>
<p>"They were now in greater distress than ever for water: even
the last miserable resource they had considerably failing them.
This threw such a damp on their spirits that they grew
disconsolate, and were making up their minds to meet death with
becoming fortitude, having given up every hope of surviving
another day, when Mr. Haskett eagerly exclaimed 'he saw
land'.</p>
<p>"Mr. Shaw likewise perceiving it, they revived instantly. Once
more putting their hopes in Providence, they stood in for the
Southern extremity of the land, which they made no doubt was
Timor, and soon got in a few miles to the leeward of the extreme,
where they discovered a bay, at the head of which were cocoanut
trees.</p>
<p>"They shortly after perceived the natives on shore. Recent
circumstances, however, made them fearful of landing; but Mr.
Shaw observed, that they might as safely trust to the chance of
being well received on shore as perish at sea, which they must
inevitably have done in another day.</p>
<p>"Having resolved, therefore, they ran into the bay, when it
was proposed that Mr. Haskett should remain in the boat, while
Mr. Carter and Mr. Shaw went in search of Water. But on Mr.
Carter's being helped out of the boat, it was found he could not
stand: he was therefore helped in again, and Mr. Haskett with Mr.
Shaw advanced towards the natives, Mr. Shaw having a water keg
and Mr. Haskett a musquet, when they were overjoyed by hearing
the natives cry out, 'Bligh! Bligh!' recollecting that Capt.
Bligh was very humanely treated at Timor; and they had now no
doubt left but they had the good fortune to touch at the same
place. They made motions to the natives for cocoa nuts, who gave
them to understand that they did not belong to them; one of them
however gave Mr. Shaw a baked yam, which he found it impossible
to eat on account of his throat being so exceedingly parched.
Having made signs for water, the natives led them to a spring,
where they quenched their thirst; when, having filled the keg,
they ran to Mr. Carter, who was calling out for water, after
which they devoured the yam with the greatest eagerness, the
natives looking at them the whole of the time in
astonishment.</p>
<p>"After their slender repast, they mentioned the word Timor to
the natives, who repeated it very distinctly, and pointed towards
the point to the Southward, and then to a prow on the beach,
intimating that they would conduct them there; in consequence of
which Mr. Shaw gave them two musquets and a number of knives and
scissars which remained in the boat.</p>
<p>"The natives made signs to go farther up the bar, which they
acquiesced in; but finding they wished to lead them up a very
narrow inlet, Mr. Shaw refused to go in with the boat,
representing that it would be highly imprudent, and as they
wished to get to Cupang as soon as possible, thought it
adviseable to make the best of their way there.</p>
<p>"This being agreed to, the boat was pushed off, and two oars
got out in order to row round the point, expecting, after that,
to have a fair wind to Cupang. Finding, however, a prow in chace
of them, they lay on their oars, hoisted their sail, and put away
before the wind, in order to escape from slavery, which they made
no doubt of experiencing if taken by the prow in chace of
them.</p>
<p>"The prow continued chasing them along the shore, between a
reef and the beach, which extends the whole length of the island.
Finding the prow still in chace, they stood over the reef, which
is a continued chain of breakers, and the prow not thinking it
proper to follow them, they escaped, and coasted it down the
island. Night approaching, and finding themselves much fatigued,
they hauled the sheet aft, and lashed the oar as before, and
found the boat went along shore very steadily. They then lay
clown to sleep, and on waking in the morning were refreshed with
the smell of spices, which was conveyed by the land wind, and
which so revived Mr. Carter that he several times exclaimed,
'Keep up your hearts, my boys, we shall dine with the Governor of
Cupang to-day.' Their hopes were however frustrated by the
numerous difficulties they had yet to encounter, owing to the
innumerable shoals and points, The water they had drank tended
likewise to increase their appetites. They were forced at night,
notwithstanding, to pursue the same method they had formerly
adopted in order to obtain sufficient rest to enable them to go
through the fatigues of the ensuing day.</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 13th, Mr. Shaw took the steer oar; but
the wind being fresh, and the boat going with great velocity
through the water, he was, from weakness, unable to stand the
force of the oar, and fell overboard: luckily, however, he held
by the gunnel until Mr. Haskett came to his assistance, when with
great exertions he was got into the boat again.</p>
<p>"Shortly after this they saw a point ahead, which they found
it impossible to weather while the wind remained the same way.
They, therefore, once more determined to land, and accordingly
ran into a small bay; when the natives came running towards them,
beckoning them to come ashore, and calling out, 'Bligh! Bligh!'
They immediately ran the boat on shore, and Mr. Haskett being
helped out of the boat by the natives, they sat him down on the
beach, and went immediately to the assistance of his companions.
When they had brought them on shore, they presented them with a
couple of cocoa-nuts, yams, and Indian corn, which they received
with unfeigned gratitude.</p>
<p>"The natives gazed on these three famished sufferers in silent
astonishment: nor is it to be wondered at; for their cheeks were
shrivelled, their eyes sunk almost into their heads, their beards
long, and their whole frames totally emaciated.</p>
<p>"The natives, far from disturbing them, made signs for them to
eat and drink, which they did with the greatest eagerness. Mr.
Carter then begged to have his wound dressed, which was done with
fresh water. Mr. Shaw having unbound his wound, found it nearly
healed.</p>
<p>"The natives appearing to express some curiosity as to the
manner in which those wounds were received, Mr. Shaw explained it
in the best manner he could, at which they made signs of being
much shocked, which did not however fully satisfy the three
gentlemen of their pacific intentions; but as they beckoned to
proceed on towards their huts, they complied, which gave the
natives apparently great satisfaction.</p>
<p>"They then attempted to get up and walk, but they could not
accomplish it without support, which the natives very kindly
afforded them, and led them to their town, which is situated at
the top of a steep hill, accessible only by two perpendicular
ladders, up which they were lifted by their guides. When they
arrived, they were taken to the Chief's house, where were
assembled an immense concourse, who came to view the strangers.
Here they were again presented with corn, yams, and toddy to
drink, after which the Chiefs pressed them to take rest. Mr.
Carter and Mr. Shaw accordingly laid themselves down there, but
Mr. Haskett was removed to another house, there not being
sufficient room for all.</p>
<p>"They were a little alarmed at seeing two men watching at the
door; notwithstanding that the Chief placed himself between them
and the men, and had a spear by his side. Mr. Shaw got up in the
night and went out of the door, in order to try if they would
prevent him going farther, but was agreeably surprised to find
they waited only lest any thing should be wanted by the
strangers.</p>
<p>"On the morning of the 14th of July, when they again met
together, the natives presented them with Indian corn, yam, and
toddy; which when they had taken they made inquiry into the name
of the land, and found that it was called Sarret, and was
separate from the Timor Land, which was the first place they
refreshed at. They were also informed that there was another
small island to the Northward called Fardette by them, but which
is in our charts called Ternabor. They also understood that a
prow came yearly to trade to Ternabor, and that she would arrive
in seven or eight months.</p>
<p>"This information greatly relieved them, and they were soon
convinced that the natives were of a humane and hospitable
nature.</p>
<p>"The first and second week elapsed without any material
occurrence, except that of a pair of scissars being stolen by one
of the children. As they were very serviceable in cutting the
hair round Mr. Carter's wound the chief was informed of the
circumstance, and he immediately called a council, consisting of
the elders of the community; when after an hour's debate they
withdrew, and on the day following the scissars were found.</p>
<p>"On the 25th of July Mr. Carter's wound was entirely healed,
after having had thirteen pieces of the fractured skull taken
out.</p>
<p>"They remained in perfect health until the 24th of November,
when Mr. Carter caught a fever, and died on the 10th of December
1793, much regretted by his friends Shaw and Haskett, as well as
by the natives of Timor Land.</p>
<p>"The two survivors waited in anxious expectation for the
arrival of the annual trading prow from Banda, and she arrived,
to their great joy on the 12th of March 1794.</p>
<p>"They sailed from Ternabor on the 10th of April, and on the
1st of May arrived at Banda, where they were received with the
utmost hospitality by the Governor, who supplied them with every
thing necessary for men in their situation, and procured them a
passage on board an Indiaman bound to Batavia, where they arrived
on the 10th of October 1794.</p>
<p>[The following inserted into 2nd Edition]</p>
<blockquote>[To the catalogue of savage murders many subsequent
instances might be added: here it may be only necessary to
mention the destruction of the ship <i>Boyd</i>, from the "Sydney
Gazette", September 1, 1810.<br>
<br>
"We mentioned in our last, that Captain Chace had received at New
Zealand a particular account, from an Otaheitean, of the loss of
the above vessel; which we premise by stating, upon the foregoing
authority, that when the <i>Boyd</i> went from hence she had on
board four or five New Zealanders, who made part of her crew.
These people were displeased at their treatment on the passage,
and determined on revenge. On their arrival, they communicated
their complaints to their friends and relatives, who were of the
Whangarooa party, and frequently at war with Tippahee and his
subjects; and the design of taking the ship was formed in
consequence. It being Captain Thompson's intention to take in a
quantity of spars, he applied to the natives for assistance in
procuring them, which they promised; but, in order to entice him
on shore, artfully objected to perform, until he should accompany
them to point out such as he might best approve. The Captain was
thereby prevailed on to leave the vessel, accompanied by his
chief officer, with three boats manned, to get the spars on
board, the natives who had arrived in the ship being of the
party, which was accompanied by a number of others in their
canoes. The boats were conducted to a river, on entering which
they were out of sight of the ship; and after proceeding some
distance lip, Captain Thompson was invited to land, and mark the
spars he wanted. The boats landed accordingly, the tide being
then beginning to ebb, and the crews followed to assist in the
work. The guides led the party through various parts of the wood
that were least likely to answer the desired end, thus delaying
the premeditated attack until the boats should be left by the
effluence of the tide sufficiently high to prevent an escape;
which part of the horrible plan accomplished, they became
insolent and rude, ironically pointing at decayed fragments, and
inquiring of Capt. Thompson whether they would suit his purpose
or not. The natives belonging to the ship then first threw off
the mask, and in opprobrious terms upbraided Capt. Thompson with
their maltreatment; informing him, at the same time, that he
should have no spars there but what he could procure himself. The
Captain appeared careless of the disappointment, and with his
people turned towards the beats; at which instant they were
assaulted with clubs and axes, which the assailants had till then
concealed under their dresses; and although the boats' crews had
several muskets, yet so impetuous was the attack, that every man
was prostrated before one could be used.<br>
<br>
"Capt. Thompson and his unfortunate men were all murdered on the
spot, and their bodies were afterwards devoured by the murderers;
who, clothing themselves with their apparel, launched the boats
at dusk the same evening, and proceeded towards the ship, which
they had determined also to attack. It being very dark before
they reached her, and no suspicion being entertained of what had
happened, the second officer hailed the boats, and was answered
by the villains who had occasioned the disaster, that the
Captain, having chosen to remain on shore that night for the
purpose of viewing the country, had ordered them to take on board
such spars as had already been procured; which account readily
obtained belief, and the officer was knocked down and killed by
those who first ascended the ship's side. All the seamen of the
watch were in like manner surprised and murdered. Some of the
assassins then went down to the cabin door, and asked the
passengers and others to go on deck to see the spars; and a
female passenger, obeying the summons, was killed on the cabin
ladder. The noise occasioned by her fall alarmed the people that
were in bed; who, running on deck in disorder, were all killed as
they went up, except four or five, who ran up the shrouds, and
remained in the rigging the rest of the night.<br>
<br>
"The next morning Tippahee appeared alongside in a canoe, and was
much offended at what had happened; but was not permitted to
interfere, or to remain near the ship. The unfortunate men in the
rigging called to him, and implored his protection; of which he
assured them, if they could make their way to his canoe. This
they effected at every hazard, and was by the old king landed on
the nearest point, though closely pursued. The pursuit was
continued on shore; they were all overtaken, and Tippahee was
forcibly held while the murder of the unhappy fugitives was
perpetrated. A female passenger and the children, who were
afterwards found in the cabin, were spared from the massacre, and
taken on shore to a hut, in which situation Mr. Berry and Captain
Pattison, of the <i>City of Edinburgh</i> would them when they
rescued them. Tippahee was afterwards permitted by the
Whangarooans to take three boat loads of any property he chose
out of the ship, fire-arms and gun-powder excepted; and the bulk
they divided among themselves. The salt provisions, flour, and
spirits, they threw overboard, as unpalatable; the carriage guns
they did the same with, considering them useless; the muskets
they prized very much; and one of the savages, in his eagerness
to try one, stove in the head of a barrel of powder, and, filling
the pan of the piece, snapped it directly over the cask, the
explosion of which killed five native women, and eight or nine
men, and set part of the ship on fire.<br>
<br>
"From the foregoing detail, it appears that neither Tippahee, nor
his son Mytye, had any share in the barbarous acts committed by
those sanguinary miscreants, but that the old Chief had, on the
contrary, endeavoured to preserve the lives of several of the
crew; and if we consider the order in which the incidents are
narrated, we must at least conclude this to be the most probable
account received of the doleful event before us; and the more
especially so, as it is the report of an Otaheitean, who was on
the spot at the time, and who, as an alien, not being interested
on the part either of the Bay of Islanders or of the
Whangarooans, may still more be entitled to credit. In the
principal facts, alas! all accounts unhappily coincide; and while
we have to deplore the calamity, we cannot forbear expressing a
hope that the commanders and crews of vessels traversing these
seas will temper friendship and humanity, towards the uncivilized
islanders with prudence and caution, and be ever guarded against
surprise and treachery, to which numbers of our countrymen have
become the victims."]</blockquote>

<h3><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a>CONCLUSION.</h3>
<p><small>HAVING</small> continued the History of New South
Wales, to the year 1802, and as an opportunity will offer of
sending the Manuscript to England in a few days; I shall close my
labours by one general view of the country, from the foundation
of the settlement, to the present time.</p>
<p>On a rational view of the country itself, at the period of
effecting the first landing by Governor Phillip, in 1788. What
was the country? but one thick wood: this, by the never ceasing
exertions of those officers in the expedition, gradually
vanished; the country opened; agriculture commenced: the effects
of their care was repaid by the satisfaction of knowing they
performed, to the best of their abilities, which were indeed
great, the object for which they were sent: and how highly are
they entitled to public gratitude, for rendering those parts
which were formerly only largewoods, convenient ports for the
refreshment of ships; for the sales of cargoes; grateful fields
for industrious farmers, and evidently in some cases, an
effectual school of reform for characters previously banished
from decent society! The discoveries of coal, tin, iron, &amp;c.
&amp;c. open the doors of commercial intercourse, sufficiently to
prove, that whatever articles the country might hereafter stand
in need of, may be procured by the endless resources of its own
natural productions.</p>
<p>The unfortunate circumstances which occasionally distress the
country, both in consequence of the extreme heats and overflowing
of the Hawkesbury, will undoubtedly become evils of less serious
magnitude, as cultivation becomes still more generally diffused;
for the slightest observation will shew, that had the country in
the interior, been in a state of cultivation, the rains which
swelled the Hawkesbury would have been absorbed, as they
descended instead of rolling down the smooth surfaces of the
hilly parts, and thus in one grand body, rushing into the
Hawkesbury. Of this indeed, I am fully convinced, for as the
pursuits of Agriculture extend, the violent rains are attended
with less dreadful consequences, which proves evidently, that in
process of time, no ill effect will result from them. But on the
contrary, the earth when in a state of cultivation in the
interior, will naturally be moistened and improved by the rains,
and the moisture so received, will resist the heats which
occasionally distress the settlers, by setting the whole surface
of the country on fire; and as the nature of the soil is so
particularly prolific as to afford two annual crops. New South
Wales may in time prove a second Poland, by becoming the Granary
of the World!!!</p>
<p>The difficulties the officers have, from the foundation of the
Colony had to combat, deserves absolute pity, for what a scene of
misery has been their portion, born and educated in affluence,
nurtured in splendour, and accustomed to elegance, fashion,
politeness, and all the enjoyments of refined life; we find them
snatched suddenly away, and placed through national necessity,
between a numerous body of vile convicts, and an innumerable body
of savages, with only the very slender barrier of a few military.
Thus situated, their strength could only be increased by the very
few of those convicts returning to a proper knowledge of
themselves. Dangerous indeed must be imagined, the situation of
these gentlemen, and dangerous indeed it was; but fortunately
their own conduct was such, that ensured them respect, fear and
love at the same time, and bad indeed as the convicts have been
found, from the beginning to the end of the History of the
Colony, not one has been found so lost, as to offer any personal
injury to any of the officers.</p>
<p>In continuing this retrospect, the poor natives next interest
my attention: their natures, which are naturally savage, could
but ill brook being driven from any part of their native country,
and though offered no personal violence, at the foundation of the
Colony, that spirit of revenge, so truly congenial to their
natures, manifested itself by far too powerfully on every
occasion. True, it most certainly is, that some of the convicts
continually committed those depredations, which must have cried
loudly, and have obtained redress, had they been executed on
other persons. The consequence of course followed, for the
natives knowing no superior power, sought redress in their own
way; but doubtless, had they never had just cause to be offended,
the greatest benefit might have been gained by their labours,
Indeed, now they begin to understand the English language a
little, many are found particularly useful, and live regularly at
the settlement, on the earnings of their own industry, and
possess dispositions of the most amiable kind. Though there are
undoubtedly, continually others, who, after living some time
amongst our people, quit all the comforts of the Colony, for the
savage association of the wild natives; but this may certainly be
accounted for on two grounds; a natural savage ignorance, or a
total abhorrence of labour, to which cause must be attributed,
the primary motive which occasioned many of the convicts visiting
the country. It is therefore, by no means wonderful, that these
savages totally unacquainted with any employment, should quit
absolute labour, till they obtained a proper knowledge of all the
various enjoyments they might obtain, by the exertion of that
labour.</p>
<p>As the natives associate with the inhabitants of the
settlements, they very rapidly become enlightened, and have in
many cases been known to give the first intelligence, of any
breach of public orders issued by the Government. This has gained
them the esteem of some, and the censure of others; indeed,
several have been so disgusted with the criminal proceedings of
the convicts towards each other, that they have sought rather the
habits of the former part of their lives, than live with those
who would injure each other wilfully. It is however, to be hoped,
that as the settlements] increase in cultivation and population,
the natives will have better examples and fewer temptations to do
injuries; for, there are now nearly One thousand young persons
living, all born in the country, who, it is fondly hoped, will
become good and useful members of society; in which case, a few
years will remove all those fears, either from mischief to be
dreaded from the natives or convicts, that continually alarm the
Government and better sort of settlers. Some of the natives are
now very regular in attending divine worship, and even those
totally unacquainted with the language, behave with the greatest
propriety, which respect, undoubtedly arises from an explanation
received by them, from those of their fellow natives; who have
not only acquired the language, but can both read and understand
the scriptures. How opposite has been, generally speaking, the
conduct of the convicts, born in a country where the poorest and
meanest of the people are taught the value of the scriptures they
have neglected, nay even despised them. The actions of their
lives form but one dreadful chain of events, only connected by a
series of uniform depravity, which no admonitions could repress,
no laws restrain, and no punishment reform.</p>
<p>The regulations adopted by the Government, either for the
general good of the settlements, or even for the particular
benefit of the convicts themselves, have not only been neglected,
but prevented being carried into effect. Even the restrictions
the convicts were wished to observe, as to confining themselves
within a given space, though it concerned the safety of their own
lives, they by no means regarded, notwithstanding examples
frequently met their eyes, of those who paid for their rashness
with their lives. The various escapes attempted and effected in
spite of every regulation, every danger, or every fatal instance
of those, who by such vain endeavours fell sacrifices to their
folly, had no beneficial effect on the minds of the depraved
inhabitants. But this certainly arose from that detestation of
labour, which nearly all so uniformly inherited, and which there
seems even yet to be no very efficient means of overcoming: for
at this period even the garden grounds allowed to many of the
convicts are not cultivated, as they prefer rather wasting the
time allowed them for that purpose, than to make a proper use of
it. But, probably, as the decent members of society increase
fast, when they exceed the numbers of the contrary description,
shame will operate so powerfully, as to induce them to act with
propriety&mdash;.to prevent being avoided, when their terms of
transportation shall expire. It is indeed much to be lamented,
that every ship nearly which visited the country, furnished those
disposed with the means of procuring spirits in the most
unreasonable quantities, notwithstanding the prohibitions of the
government, and that scarce a vessel left the country without
assisting some to make their escapes. This perhaps unsettled most
of those who would otherwise have been contented; for as every
arrival revived their hopes of escape, so did it cause them to
neglect their duty to attempt getting away. These, added to the
repeated and unfortunate shortness of provisions with which the
colony was formerly visited, might be an additional motive for
such attempts being made. When it is considered with what evils
the government of New South Wales had to contend, it is really
wonderful how so much labour was effected on the public account;
for exclusive of the quantity of land cleared and cultivated, the
list of buildings in pages 415 to 420 [Chapter X], which are
there mentioned, as only those during Governor Hunter's residence
as Chief Magistrate in the country. Many other works have gone
forward on the accounts of individuals: so that had it
fortunately have happened that all had with equal alacrity
exerted themselves for the good of the colony, as the various
officers have been found to do, it is hardly possible to
calculate to what degree of importance the country might by this
time have arrived at.</p>
<p>When the time shall arrive, that a more regular communication
is kept up between New South Wales and the mother country, which
there is every reason to expect will shortly take place, in
consequence of the representations which Governor Hunter promised
on leaving the colony to make to Government, there can be no
doubt but many advantages will result to both countries, though
more particularly to this; and should it be thought proper by
Government to suffer some honest families to come out as
settlers, there can be no doubt but it would prove most highly
beneficial to themselves and the settlements, as that spirit of
monopoly which has in several instances manifested itself, would
by that means be broken, if not entirely overcome, as there would
be a greater number ready to buy the cargos that might arrive for
sale, and consequently an increased number of retailers, which
would occasion a necessity of selling the articles at a more
moderate price.</p>
<p>The want of a regular attendance on divine worship, of which
notice has been so frequently taken in the course of the History
is now nearly removed; and I am happy to be able to say, that the
New Church, built at Paramatta, is properly attended every Sunday
by all classes of people, and I trust it will be very long before
another complaint can be made of want of attention on that head.
The adjoining sketch of the Church is a very faithful
representation, and will serve to gratify the curiosity of my
readers.</p>

<p>[The following is omitted from 2nd Edition]</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted, that any persons should have been
sent to New South Wales for their political connections. Above
all places in the world, they could not have been sent to a
worse, and the worse their cases might be, strange as it may
seem, it was the more highly improper, for what must be the
result? The convicts, all depravity themselves, admired, rather
than despised them; and the generous conduct of the Government to
Muir, and others in not putting them to hard labour, was
construed into a pity which their fates might seem to deserve,
and what had nearly been the effect of sending these
people&mdash;but the overthrow of the country, and the massacre
of the officers composing the government. For my part, might I be
permitted to offer an opinion on the best way of both deterring,
in the first place, or preventing a repetition of crimes, it
would be by placing those convicted to hard labour in the public
streets or highways for a given time, being fully convinced that
it is the detestation of work that causes at least one half of
the crimes in all parts of the world to be committed. Death, with
all the horrors which can be made to accompany it, is not half so
dreadful as work to this class of mankind. Let them be placed and
kept to hard labour in view of the public for all crimes but
murder, and it would be found there would, in a short time, be
fewer executions, and no need to transport more convicts to New
South Wales. The Hulks were intended to effect this object, but
have not answered the purpose, for the same reason that
transportation fails: whereas labouring in the streets and
highways, they would receive the continual mortification of
seeing their friends and relations, those they have plundered,
and those they have associated with, and perhaps brought them to
destruction. Thus at the expiration of their terms they would
reap a salutary lesson, and have an opportunity of returning to
society, and deter others from becoming <small>EQUALLY PUBLIC
CHARACTERS</small>.</p>
<p>Thus having finished my retrospective view of the whole, I
must now conclude, trusting I have related with the greatest
impartiality every circumstance noticed in the History, and that
I have omitted nothing of consequence. Thus flattering myself on
the whole, I have been a faithful narrator of facts; and that the
work will afford the reader some entertaining recompence for his
trouble, I must now cease to trespass further on his
patience.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<blockquote><small>BUT</small> respecting the morality of the
settlers and fertility of the colony, it was evident from the
very first trials that it could only be improved by the skill and
active industry of respectable settlers. Among the first settlers
there were unfortunately eighty-seven, mostly emancipated
convicts, sailors and privates from the marines, men too long
accustomed to drinking spirituous liquors to shake off a practice
so pernicious in their new situation; however, this is an evil no
longer existing, it having been found necessary to transport
incorrigible characters even from the place to which they had
been transported before. The settlers consequently are more
select, and hence respectable strangers, as well as the natives
of Great Britain, are induced to come and establish themselves in
the new colony. In fact, every arrival for the last seven years
has brought passengers; and when it is considered that vessels
from the following places are constantly visiting the settlement,
it is almost impossible to doubt of its increasing consequence,
viz. the Cape of Good Hope, Batavia, Bengal, Bombay, Madras, the
West and North West coasts of America, Manilla, Dusky Bay,
Otaheite, Cape Blanco, China, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br>
<br>
Besides the superabundant crops of grain which the colony has
been brought to produce, iron ore equal to any Swedish has been
discovered; many fine veins of coal; oak not inferior to our
finest mahogany, for articles of furniture and veneering;
spermaceti oil; seal skins; wool equal in quality to the finest
Spanish; besides hemp, flax, tobacco, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br>
<br>
As for any association with the natives in general, it is no
longer expected; and as they have long since ceased to be
formidable to the settlers, this is a matter of small importance;
it is most probable that, imitating the conduct of the Indians in
North America, as strangers encroach, they will retire further
and further into the interior. They seem totally incapable of
refinement; their natural aversion to its wholesome restraints
has proved on all occasions insurmountable; and it has been
consequently observed that Bennillong, though he had been to
England, even the refined Bennillong soon stripped himself of all
his fine cloaths, and betook himself in a state of nature to his
native forests and former habits; although, when he first
returned home, he appeared to his sisters and relatives quite the
man of consequence. He even declared, in a tone and with an air
that seemed to expect implicit compliance, that he should no
longer suffer them to fight as they had done; that he should
introduce peace among them, and make them love each other; and
that when they visited him at the government house they ought to
be more cleanly in their persons, and less coarse in their
manners. And, though he himself for a time behaved with great
propriety at table, particularly in the observance of those
attentions chiefly requisite in the presence of women, he could
not exterminate his ancient propensities, but finally gave up all
his new prospects for the liberty of indulging habits of life not
many removes from absolute beastiality. And, when some of our
officers asked Bennillong whether he had left all his good
manners in England, he replied, "Oh! good manners are of no use
here: one must always make free." Still, this is a rule not
without several exceptions; it will therefore give great pleasure
to every advocate for humanity to know, that through the
attention of the governors, the officers, and their ladies,
several of the natives' children are educating at Paramatta, Port
Jackson, &amp;c. and that they have manifested a docility of
disposition, that does not leave the smallest doubt of their
becoming useful members of society. The Rev. Mr. Marsden,
chaplain to the colony, took a native boy whom he brought to
write a good hand and speak English with great fluency. He was
also taught singing, and had a particular taste for sacred music.
Several others have been taught to read the New Testament.<br>
<br>
It further appears, that by means of the <i>Paramatta</i>, a
trading vessel from Port Jackson, several voyages have been made
to the Society's Islands, viz. Huahene, Macatea, and Bora-bora.
The chiefs of these islands have shewn a very friendly
disposition towards the Christian religion.<br>
<br>
Many, natives of Otaheite had visited the missionaries in 1806,
at Port Jackson, and the governor had also assured them of his
patronage and support. In the course of the same year It appears
that Pomarre, the chief, had such a thirst for knowledge, that he
consented to learn to write English: several persons of
consequence were following his example.<br>
<br>
The authority of Pomarre as king, was acknowledged not only at
Taheite Eimeo, Metea, and Teturoa, but also at Huahene, Koatea,
Macoa, Manu, Borabora, and at Matea, (the recreation island of
Koggewin) and likewise by some of the Pearl islands. In a bloody
war maintained at Oura, in 1807, it is said the party who
conquered baked in an oven, and ate up their enemies.<br>
<br>
Pomarre in the same year promised to banish Ofo, his chief idol,
to Raatea, and to abolish human sacrifices and infant murders.
Though this, some of the Taheitans then said, was all <i>te
veha</i>, mere talk.<br>
<br>
A strain of simplicity seems to run through the following<br>
<br>
<center><i>Letter from Pomarre, King of Otaheite, to the
Missionary Society.</i></center>
<br>
<br>
<p align="right"><small>Matavae Otaheite, Jan. 1,

<br>
     "Friends,<br>
<br>
"I <small>WISH</small> you every blessing, friends, in your
residence in this country, with success in teaching this bad
land, this foolish land, this wicked land, this land which is
ignorant of good, this land that knoweth not the true God, this
regardless land.<br>
<br>
"Friends, I wish you health and prosperity; may I also live, and
may Jehovah save us all.<br>
<br>
"Friends, with respect to the letter you wrote to me, I have this
to say to you, that your business with me and your wishes I fully
consent to, and shall consequently banish Oro, and send him to
Raetea.<br>
<br>
"Friends, I do therefore believe and shall obey your word.<br>
<br>
"Friends, I hope you also will consent to any request, which is
this; I wish you to send a great number of men, women, and
children here.<br>
<br>
"Friends, send also property, and cloth for us, and we will also
adopt English customs.<br>
<br>
"Friends, send also plenty of muskets and powder, for wars are
frequent in our country. Should I be killed, you will have
nothing in Taheite: do not come here when I am dead: Taheite is a
regardless country, and should I die with sickness do not come
here. This also I wish, that you would send me all the curious
things that you have in England. Also send me every thing
necessary for writing; paper, ink, and pens in abundance: let no
writing utensil be wanting.<br>
<br>
"Friends, I have done, and have nothing at all more to ask you
for. As for your desire to instruct Taheite, 'tis what I fully
acquiesce in. 'Tis a common thing for people not to understand at
first; but your object is good, and I fully consent to it, and
shall cast off all evil customs.<br>
<br>
"What I say is truth, and no lie; it is real truth.<br>
<br>
"This is all I have to write, I hate done. Friends, write to me,
that I may know what you have to say.<br>
<br>
<p align="center">"I wish you life and every blessing,<br>

<p align="right"><small>"POMARRE</small>, King of Taheite,
&amp;c.</p>
<i>For my Friends the Missionary<br>
      Society, London.</i><br>
<br>
The late Governor Bligh, also, previous to his removal by
Lieutenant-Governor Paterson, had been extremely favourable to
the missionaries in affording them all the accommodation in his
power.<br>
<br>
Pomarre, the king of Otaheite, has been in connection with the
colony ever since 1801, when a scarcity of provisions being much
feared in New South Wales, the governor dispatched a letter by
Lieutenant Scott, who was going to the Cape de Verd Islands, to
the king of Otaheite, earnestly requesting him to afford Mr.
Scott all the assistance in his power, as he was perfectly aware
that though provisions might be sent from England for the use of
the settlement, accidents might notwithstanding retard, or
prevent, their reaching New South Wales by the time the stock in
hand would be expended.<br>
<br>
At this time also the governor made it a particular request to
Pomarre, that the missionaries then residing at Otaheite; should
receive every attention; and he endeavoured to convince him that
his majesty the king of Great Britain would, by the good conduct
shewn to these people, judge of those of Otaheite.<br>
<br>
But Mr. Scott, it is thought, took with him far more powerful
arguments than those in the governor's letter, this being
accompanied by a plentiful assortment of yellow and red cloths,
knives, shirts, tomahawks, axes, jackets, scissars, &amp;c.
&amp;c. for the people in general: and for his majesty of
Otaheite, (who was known to be by no means averse to presents)
Mr. Scott was furnished with a mantle and other dresses,
ornamented with feathers, six muskets and ammunition, and thus
equipped could not well fail of success. Lest, however, any
accident should happen, the governor in the mean while sent
instructions to Norfolk Island for salting all the provisions
that could be well spared for the settlers and convicts at
Sydney.<br>
<br>
Mr. Marsden, the chaplain to the settlement, who succeeded the
Rev. Mr. Johnson, about sixteen years since, has been a very
zealous assistant to the governor in keeping up the missionary
interest in that quarter. With the view of procuring young men
for that undertaking, that gentleman was in England about two
years ago; when he spoke in the warmest terms of the climate and
scenery of this improving colony. It should also be understood,
that in December 1807, a gold time-keeper sent to be repaired was
sent back from Sydney to Pomarre, and in his absence delivered to
his mother.<br>
<br>
To return to the affairs of the missionaries; all these prospects
of success seem to have vanished suddenly; for a war having
broken out at Otaheite, the missionaries were obliged to retire
to a neighbouring island, about sixteen miles distant, when some
of them having been there before, they were received in a
friendly manner. This intelligence came from the directors at
Huahene.<br>
<br>
When the war broke out, the brig Perseverance from Sydney, in New
South Wales, was in the bay of Matavae: she was detained 4$ hours
by the earnest request of the missionaries, and took them, with
their property, on board. They left Otaheite about noon, Nov. 10,
1808, and anchored in the harbour of Huahene about noon next
day.<br>
<br>
This serious war in Taheite, it is thought, will, in all
probability, end in the dissolution of Pomarre's government, and
the total overthrow of his authority. A new mission to Uletea, it
was said, was in agitation, under the protection of Tapoa.<br>
<br>
Literature as well as religion, it seems, has increased in this,
distant quarter. Even some time ago it was observed, that the
colony of New South Wales "was already England in miniature." It
is but little more than two centuries since Europeans settled in
a manner nearly similar on the continent of North America; and
which has now for some years past proved its ability to maintain
its own independence.<br>
<br>
One of the most striking public efforts of the inhabitants of New
South Wales towards assuming a national character ought not to be
passed over without interest and observation. It is a period
naturally leading to reflection, and the thinking mind cannot
look forward without anticipating similar occurrences to those
which have happened in America; but only with this difference,
which perhaps may hasten such a period, viz. that New South Wales
increases in wealth and conveniences much more rapidly than
America did.<br>
<br>
But in no point of view, perhaps, the wealth and prosperity of a
country can be so justly ascertained as by the number and
contents of its newspapers; and the appearance of a weekly print
at a very early period in the rising infant colony would
certainly have excited surprise, had it not been, visibly
connected with the most promising hopes of its future prosperity.
We allude to the <i>Sydney Gazette and New South Wales
Advertiser</i>, price sixpence, ornamented with an oval device,
containing the implements of husbandry, round which are the
words, "Thus we hope to conquer." It was published by the
authority of Governor King, at Port Jackson, on the 6th of March
1803, where his excellency resided.<br>
<br>
From, all the subsequent papers which have arrived here, it
appears they are much occupied, like our English newspapers, with
advertisements, state of the markets, public sales, articles lost
and found, even servants wanted, with articles of millinery,
jewellery, &amp;c. &amp;c. Hence the state of society is evident;
and it presents a wide field to reflection to observe how nearly
all this approaches to the perfection of opulence.<br>
<br>
Another representation of delegated authority, of late very
frequently to be seen in the colony, is the <i>public seal</i>.
The obverse bears the king's arms and royal titles, and the
reverse emblematic figures suited to the situation of the people
for whose government it is designed. The motto is, "<i>Sic fortis
Etruria crevit</i>;" and in the margin, <i>Sigullum Nov. Camb.
Aust.</i><br>
<br>
But, perhaps, a more just tribute to the flourishing state of
this colony could not possibly have been paid than that which has
been given by a stranger, M. Peron, the <i>naturalist</i>, who
accompanied the voyage of discovery sent out by Buonaparte,
between 1800 and 1804.<br>
<br>
The activity and extent of English commerce were never more
forcibly depicted than in the language this impartial observer
made use of on this occasion. "A crowd of objects", said he,
"demanded our notice in every direction. In the port (Jackson),
we saw, drawn up together, a number of vessels that had arrived
from different parts of the world, and most of which were,
destined to perform new and difficult voyages. Some of them had
come from the banks of the Thames, or the Shannon, to pursue
whale-fishing on the frigid shores of New Zealand: others, bound
to China, after depositing the freight which they had received
from the English government for this colony, were preparing to
sail for the mouth of the Yellow-river; while some, laden with
pit-coal, were about to convey that precious combustible to
India, and the Cape of Good Hope. Several smaller vessels were on
their way to Bass's Straits, to receive skins, collected by a few
individuals, who had established themselves on the isles of those
Straits, to catch the marine animals that resort to them. Other
ships, stronger built than those just alluded to, and manned by
more numerous and daring crews, who were provided with all kinds
of arms, were on the point of sailing for the western coast of
America. Laden with various sorts of merchandize, these vessels
were intended to carry on, by force of arms, a contraband trade
on the Peruvian shores, which could not fail to prove extremely
advantageous to the adventurers. Here they were preparing an
expedition, to carry on a skin trade with the people of the
north-west shores of America; there all hands were engaged in
sending off a fleet of provision-ships to the Navigators', the
Friendly, and the Society, islands, to procure for the colony a
stock of salt provisions. At the same time, the intrepid Captain
Flinders, after effecting a junction with his companionship, the
Lady Nelson, was getting ready to continue his grand voyage round
New Holland; a voyage which was soon afterwards terminated by the
greatest misfortunes. In short, at this period, the harbour of
Port Jackson had become familiar to the American navigators, and
their flag was continually flying in it during our residence.<br>
<br>
"All these great maritime operations gave to the place a
character of importance and activity, far beyond what we expected
to meet with on shores scarcely known to Europeans, even by name,
and the interest we took in the scene was only equalled by our
admiration.<br>
<br>
"The population of the colony was to us a new subject of
astonishment and contemplation. Perhaps there never was a more
worthy object of study presented to the philosopher;&mdash;never
was the influence of social institutions proved in a manner more
striking and honourable to the distant country in question. Here
we found united, like one family, those banditti, who had so long
been the terror "of their mother country: repelled from European
society, and sent off to the extremity of the globe; placed from
the very hour of their exile in a state between the certainty of
chastisement, and the hope of a better fate; incessantly
subjected to an inspection, as inflexible as it is active, they
have been compelled to abandon their anti-social manners; and the
majority of them, having expiated their crimes by a hard period
of slavery, have been restored to the rank which they held
amongst their fellow-men. Obliged to interest themselves in the
maintenance of order and justice, for the purpose of preserving
the property which they have acquired; while they behold
themselves in the situation of husbands and fathers, they have
the most interesting and powerful motives for becoming good
members of the community in which they exist.<br>
<br>
"The same revolution, effected by the same means, has taken place
amongst the women: and those who were wretched prostitutes have
imperceptibly been brought to a regular mode of life, and now
form intelligent and laborious mothers of families. But it is not
merely in the moral character of the women that these important
alterations are discoverable, but also in their physical
condition, the results of which are worthy the consideration,
both of the legislator and the philosopher. For example, every
body knows that the common women of great capitals are in general
unfruitful; at Petersburgh, and Madrid, at Paris, and London,
pregnancy is a sort of phenomenon amongst persons or that
description; though we are unable to assign any other cause, than
a sort of insusceptibility of conception: the difficulty of
researches, as to this subject, has prevented, philosophers from
determining how far this sterility ought to be attributed to the
mode of life of such women; and to what degree it may be modified
or altered by a change of condition and manners. But both these
problems are solved, by what takes place in the singular
establishment that we are describing. After residing a year or
two at Port Jackson, most of the English prostitutes become
remarkably fruitful; and what, in my opinion, clearly proves that
the effect arises much less from the climate, than from the
change of manners amongst the women, is, that those prostitutes
in the colony, who are permitted by the police to continue in
their immoral way of life, remain barren the same as in Europe.
Hence we may be permitted to deduce the important physiological
result, that an excess of sexual intercourse destroys the
sensibility of the female organs, to such a degree, as to render
them incapable of conception; while, to restore the frame to its
pristine activity, nothing is necessary but to renounce those
fatal excesses.<br>
<br>
"While we were reflecting en these numerous and interesting
subjects, all the officers and principal citizens of the colony
were unremitting in their assiduities towards us. Our numerous
sick were received into the government hospital, where the
English surgeons paid them all possible attention. Doctor
Thomson, the chief physician of the colony, directed the mode of
treatment with the greatest, tenderness: and whatever we were in
need of, that the place could furnish, was put at our disposal.
The governor-general cave us an unlimited credit on the public
treasury, and our Commodore was furnished with royal printed
checks, to fill up with any sum that he might wish for; and these
checks, without any other security than the signature of the
French commandant, were accepted by the inhabitants with a
confidence highly honourable to the government of our country.
Our salt provisions, spirits, and biscuits, were exhausted; but
by means of these checks we obtained fresh supplies; and several
times the magazines of the colony were opened to supply us with
articles which our agents could not procure. Thus, by this
generous relief, we were enabled to reclothe our crews, who were
in want of every thing; repair our ships; purchase one, instead
of that we had lost; and be completely prepared for continuing
our voyage.<br>
<br>
"At the same time, our scientific researches met with every
encouragement; a guard of English soldiers was appointed
expressly to protect our observatory, which, we placed on the
north point of the eastern bank of Sydney Cove. The whole of the
country was open to the excursions of our naturalists, and we
were even permitted to wear our arms, as were the persons of our
suite; while guides and interpreters were furnished us for our
longest journies. In short, the English government behaved to us
with such generosity that they acquired our warmest
gratitude.<br>
<br>
"The principal object of our stay at Port Jackson, was, that we
might devote proper attention to every part of the surrounding
country. While our crews were repairing the damages the ships had
sustained, and getting in fresh supplies of provisions, the
naturalists extended their researches to every branch of the
physical history of this interesting country. The scurvy, which
had affected all my joints with swellings and stiffness, had
already begun to yield to the influence of diet and the climate;
and as soon as I was able, I went down to the coast of Botany
Bay, the harbour of which is situated some leagues to the south
of Port Jackson. A large and commodious road leads from Sydney
Town to this great bay: all the intermediate country is sandy and
barren, and appears unfit for any kind of cultivation;
consequently one does not meet with any European habitations.
After passing the high hill, at the foot of Which is the
establishment of Mr. Palmer, the country opens upon a sandy
plain, which extends as far as the swampy banks of Cook's river.
Various species of Hakea, Styphelia, Eucalyptus, Banksia,
Embothryum, and Casuarina, grow amidst these sands, and large
spaces are occupied entirely with the Xanthorea, the gigantic
stalks of which grow to the height of from eighteen to twenty
feet. In the distance may be perceived the smoke of a few huts,
belonging to those unfortunate hordes of natives who exist on
these desolate shores.<br>
<br>
"As you approach towards Botany Bay, the land gradually sinks,
till you reach the dangerous swamps formed by the brackish waters
of Cook's river towards the north, and of George river to the
south. These marshes are so extensive, and often so deep, that it
is impossible in many parts to pass them, if you want to reach
the sea. On their banks, and all along the two rivers just
mentioned, vegetation is very active: a thousand species of trees
and shrubs, which cover the surface of the soil, afforded to that
part of the country which we occupied a delightful appearance; it
was this circumstance which deceived Captain Cook, and his brave
companions; for they supposed the land to be unparalleled in
point of fertility. It would have been well, however, if this
bay, so celebrated by those navigators, had justified the great
ideas which they formed of it. Obstructed by large banks of mud,
and open at the south to the easterly winds, it does not afford
to vessels that security often necessary. The marshy soil in the
environs being unhealthy, Commodore Phillip, after viewing Port
Jackson, was soon induced to abandon Botany Bay, where only a
lime kiln remains now, to make lime out of the shells that abound
on this part of the coast. This part the natives call Gwea, as it
belonged to the tribe of savages under Bennillong, called Gwea
Gal.<br>
<br>
"Twenty-five miles, or thereabout, to the west of Sydney Town, is
the town of Rose Hill, or Paramatta, which I took the earliest
opportunity of visiting: M. Bellefin, the principal physician of
the <i>Naturaliste</i>, accompanied me. A serjeant of the New
South Wales regiment acted as our guide, and was ordered by
Colonel Paterson to obtain for us such facilities as we might
stand in need of. The large road from Sydney to Paramatta, though
not paved, is kept in good condition, and every where wide enough
for three carriages to pass abreast. Bridges are here and there
thrown across where the waters offer any interruption. Having
been opened through vast forests never before assailed by the
axe, at a distance this grand road appears like an immense avenue
of foliage and verdure. A charming freshness and an agreeable
shade always prevail in this continuous bower, the silence of
which is interrupted only by the singing and chirping of the
richly plumed parroquets and other native birds. The whole,
between this and Rose Hill, is a flat, with very few exceptions.
The soil becomes less barren in proportion as you recede from the
sea shore. In some parts there are large spaces between the
trees, covered by very fine and sweet scented grass, forming a
beautiful verdant carpet, and now affording pasturage to numerous
flocks of such excellent sheep, that the finest kinds of Spain
and England thrive as well here as on their native soil: the
English manufacturers, knowing of the superiority of the wool,
pay dearer for it. This discovery will, probably, soon open to
Great Britain a branch of commerce as easy as it is
lucrative.<br>
<br>
"Woods here and there open to the view, and the traveller
perceives amidst them spots which have been cleared by the
settlers; he discovers on them many pretty habitations, shaded by
beautiful trees, and contemplates with pleasing emotions those
new fields where the feeble grass of the north rises from the
decay of the more powerful Eucalyptus: here with delight he sees
on those distant grounds the most useful animals of his own
country; the bulls frisk about with a vigour equal, or even
superior, to that of the cold meadows of Ireland, while the cow
gives a greater quantity of milk. The English horse also appears
with the same spirit as when upon the banks of the Thames, while
the European hog is improved by numerous crosses with those of
the South Sea Islands. All kinds of poultry have at length
succeeded, and the farm yards are stocked with different kinds of
geese, turkies, pheasants, &amp;c. several of which are
preferable to the finest in Europe.<br>
<br>
"The traveller feels additional pleasure in visiting the
habitations. Beneath their agreeable roofs now live that
banditti, who, but a short time before, were the terror of
Europe, and who, familiar with guilt, constantly expected the
punishment of death: here, now, live those rogues and
pickpockets, those criminals of every kind, the refuse of the
mother country, and who there appeared to increase! All these
unfortunate wretches, the disgrace of their country, have become,
by the most inconceivable, metamorphosis, laborious cultivators,
and happy and peaceable members of their community. Indeed,
murders, or robberies, are scarcely ever heard of amongst them;
so that in this respect the most perfect security prevails
throughout the colony; a happy consequence of laws as severe as
they are beneficent.<br>
<br>
"In order to enjoy at our ease these striking scenes, M. Bellefin
and I often entered the rural habitations. We were every where
received in the most obliging manner; and when we observed the
tender cares of the mothers towards their children, and reflected
that only a few years before these very women, destitute of every
tender affection and delicate sentiment, were disgusting
prostitutes, the sudden revolution in their moral conduct gave
rise to reflections of the most gentle and philanthropic
nature."<br>
<br>
Having thus given an outline of the latest and most useful
improvements in the colony itself, we shall now, in pursuance of
the plan adopted in the first editions of the Voyage, describe
those discoveries which have been made from time to time, in the
immense bosom of the Southern and Pacific Ocean, by the
navigators dispatched from Port Jackson at different periods to
Otaheite, New Caledonia, New Ireland, Kennedy's Island, the
Island of Simboo, New Zealand, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br>
<br>
But as a British settlement has lately been formed at Port
Dalrymple and Western Port, in Van Diemen's Land, we shall
commence with a more particular account of that part of the
continent than has hitherto appeared; as it may be seen that when
the first British journals were published, the navigators had not
succeeded in making themselves acquainted with the persons of the
inhabitants, on account of their keeping themselves so carefully
aloof from strangers. Monsieur Labillardi&egrave;re, the French
navigator, in search of La Perouse, it seems, has succeeded
better.<br>
<br>
Like the original inhabitants of the coast of Botany Bay, he
observes, the natives of Van Diemen's land feed upon shell fish,
barnacles, &amp;c. and it is the women's business not only to
pick the shell fish from the rocks, but likewise to dive for
them. They also broil a kind of sea weed, and had at first such a
repugnance to any food offered them by Europeans, that they would
not suffer their children even to eat the sugar given them,
though they would trust them into their hands to dandle. They
mostly pass the nights in the open air; but though the
temperature of the climate is variable, it is observed they are
not subject to inflammations of the eyes, but generally have a
good sight. When sitting on the ground, some of them spread
kangaroos skins under them, while others use a little pillow for
resting one of their elbows, about a quarter of a yard long,
covered with skin.<br>
<br>
The singular posture of the women much surprised the Europeans
who first witnessed it. When they sit on the ground, though they
are for the most part entirely naked, it appears to have been a
point of decorum to adopt all that possible concealment which
modesty would suggest among the most refined nations.<br>
<br>
They rub their bodies with the powder of charcoal. The men in
walking frequently carry their hands resting one against the
other upon their loins; or sometimes the left hand passing behind
the back, and grasping the right arm about the middle.<br>
<br>
They have some ideas of musical harmony; a great analogy between
their tunes and those of the Arabs, in Asia Minor, has been
observed. Two of them sing the same time at once, but always one
a third above the other, forming a concord with considerable
accuracy.<br>
<br>
The black spotted paroquet scenes to be peculiar to Diemen's
Cape; it does not perch like the rest, but uniformly settles on
the grass from which it rises. Its feet are provided with very
long claws, with scarcely any curve. Its feathers are green,
spotted with black, some of the spots surrounded with small
yellowish bands; and a few reddish feathers may be seen at the
bottom of the beak, at the upper part. It should have been
observed, that though they have some ear for music, they could
not bear the sounds of a violin; but absolutely stopped their
ears that they might hear no more.<br>
<br>
Often plagued with vermin, mothers have been seen disencumbering
their infants of them; but, like many of the blacks, crushing
them between their teeth, if not swallowing these disagreeable
insects. Apes have been observed to do the same. The women of Van
Diemen's land, though they can scarcely be suspected of coquetry,
have a method of concealing those external symptoms occasioned by
frequent child bearing. They have the exterior skin of the lower
abdomen marked with three large semicircular risings, one above
the other; and in other cases are supposed to make use of the
cautery in a medical way, as many of these savages had, when
first seen, several marks of very recent burns on their
heads.<br>
<br>
In Van Diemen's land, as well as in many other uncultivated
regions, the principal part of the labour devolves upon the
women. Here they are even charged with the task of procuring food
necessary for the support of their families. Near Port
Dentrecasteaux, the women were observed with baskets followed by
their daughters to the rocks which projected into the sea, from
whence they plunged to the bottom in search of shell fish. After
remaining under water twice as long as our ablest divers, they
came up, and, only taking breath for a few moments, went down
again repeatedly, till they had filled their baskets. Most of
them having bits of wood in their hands sharpened at the ends,
with these they forced the sea-ears, &amp;c. from the rocks. They
also brought up very large lobsters, but, to prevent being hurt
by their claws, they always took the precaution to kill them the
moment they were caught. Being cold weather at this time, it was
observed, that when these women came ashore after diving, they
would stay but a very little while to warm themselves, before
they returned again; and this they did by standing with their
faces towards the fire where the fish was roasting; while behind
them other little fires were burning, for the purpose of warming
them on all sides at once.<br>
<br>
It was in vain that the French crews, when in search of La
Perouse, entreated the husbands of these women to take a part in
this labour. They kept themselves very comfortably about the
fires, feasting on the choicest of the fish, and eating broiled
fern roots. Occasionally they would take the trouble of breaking
the boughs of trees, merely to prevent the fire from going out;
but even this they had a most curious method of performing; for,
taking hold of the sticks at each end with their hands, they bent
them over their heads, as we do at the knee, till they broke. It
being observed that their meals continued very long, and the
Europeans being rather surprised that none of the savages had
drank, they found that this was always deferred till they were
quite satisfied with a quantity of food. Then the women and girls
being sent to get water in vessels formed out of a strong sea
weed, on their return they were observed to set it down by the
men, who drank it with avidity, notwithstanding it was both muddy
and stagnant.<br>
<br>
In this part of the continent of New South Wales, nothing
appeared to point out that they had any chiefs, as each family
seemed to be independent, though the children were in the
greatest subordination to their parents, and the women the same
to their husbands. It also appeared that the women were very
careful to avoid giving their husbands any occasion for
jealousy.<br>
<br>
The Commandant Dentrecasteaux suffered one of the natives to come
on board the Recherche. He came up the side with an air of
confidence, and examined the inside of the ship with great
attention; and being taken with the resemblance between the black
swans of Cape Diemen and the geese of Guinea, he asked for one,
knowing it was to be eaten. Looking at the hen coops also, he was
much pleased with a large cock, and, upon its being given him, he
made it known by signs and gestures that it should not be long
before he would broil it and eat it. Being loaded with presents,
he wished to return on shore, and was immediately rowed off. An
ape taken ashore with the people of the Recherche, furnished much
amusement to the savages; and one of the crew taking a goat with
him, this formed a subject of conversation for them a long time;
and to the goat they frequently spoke as if it understood them,
desiring it in terms of familiarity to <i>sit down</i>. In hopes
of naturalizing some European animals in New Holland, the French
ships, before their departure in 1793, set ashore a she goat and
a young he goat, under the idea that, as they could not fail
thriving on the mountains, they might be of use to future
navigators, but there was no certainty that the savages might not
destroy them before they had time to propagate.<br>
<br>
In the strait of Dentrecasteaux, after the ship's departure from
Rocky Bay, they sent an engineer geographer to explore the great
creek which falls into this strait, in order to find out whether
it had any opening into the main sea, and whether the Island of
Maria was really separated from the land of New Holland, as this
had not been fully ascertained neither by Marion nor even by
Captain Cook.<br>
<br>
While some of the crew sent out to catch fish were proceeding to
the mouth of the strait, the flood brought down considerable
quantities: several species of the ray of a very large size were
caught, some of them weighing upwards of two hundred and sixty
pounds.<br>
<br>
The savages in this neighbourhood were found to be as destitute
of clothes as those before described. But it caused some surprise
to see most of them holding the extremity of the prepuce with the
left hand; possibly from a bad habit, as it was not found to be
general. Their joy was expressed by loud bursts of laughter, at
the same time they carried their hands to their heads, and
performed a quick tapping with their feet to the ground, while
their countenances shewed they were well pleased. These savages
well understood the language of the other natives at Rocky Bay,
&amp;c. and one of them seemed to be a complete beau. He was
certainly a fine figure, though not above the middle size; he was
tattoed with astonishing regularity, and his hair, plaistered
with grease, was well powdered with ochre. One of these natives
also remembered Captain Bligh when he anchored here in 1792.<br>
<br>
All the savages in Van Diemen's land seem entirely ignorant of
the use of the bow; the spear, if such it may be called, is their
only means of defence. Almost all of them upon the coast are
tatooed with raised points, in two lines, one over the other,
something resembling the shape of a horseshoe; others made
straight lines, and in many the navel seemed puffed up and very
prominent. They lived upon fish as well as the other inhabitants
of Cape Diemen, and their appearance furnished a denial of the
common notion, that persons confining themselves to this food are
subject to diseases of the skin. Nothing of this kind was
observed among them.<br>
<br>
After five days absence the small vessel which the commandant had
dispatched to make discoveries in the great creek, returned, and
decidedly ascertained having seen the channel, that the Island of
Maria was separated from the main land; he also discovered
several bays not described before.<br>
<br>
When Captain Cook was in these parts, it appears that he left a
sow and a boar for the same purpose as the French navigator
afterwards left the he and she goat. The latter thought they
might probably multiply to such a degree as to bring about a
total change in the manners of the inhabitants, so as to make
them a pastoral people, and thus quit the sea coast without
regret. The women then would no longer be exposed to be devoured
by sharks, inconsequence of diving in search of food. Unhappily,
no person that has visited Van Diemen's Land since Captain Cook
has ever seen the least trace of the animals he left there with
the most benevolent intentions.<br>
<br>
These were the sentiments entertained of Van Diemen's land some
few years since: how much it had improved between that period and
1807 with respect to <i>game</i> in particular, the following
extract of a letter from a gentleman resident there to his friend
in London will sufficiently evince.<br>
<br>
"Dear Sir,<br>
<br>
"<small>ALTHOUGH</small> not much of a huntsman before I left
Europe, yet I have sense enough to know you have no animal now
left that can give you the least idea of sporting in Van Diemen's
Land. Nevertheless, I have heard much of the fatigues of the
chase, of hard days' riding, dashing leaps, &amp;c. &amp;c. yet
these are mere pigmy difficulties, when compared with those of
the <i>bush</i> in our new world.<br>
<br>
"The only animals I recollect you to have now left as objects of
sport, are the hare and fox, with (although but very seldom) the
stag; and in pursuit of these innumerable hounds, horses, and
huntsmen, are joined, and, if one solitary brush is obtained, the
day is thought to end victoriously. What, then, would be thought
among you, of one man, with two dogs, often procuring in a few
hours, and bringing home on his shoulders, many miles, one
hundred and fifty pounds weight of solid flesh food, which I
declare my own huntsman has often done? and I have many times had
three cwt. of meat hanging in my yard at one time*, which I
assure you, if properly dressed, it is impossible to distinguish
from beef, and in its gelatinous quality it far exceeds the ox,
for the tail, head, and feet, make a soup equal to the finest
turtle; and it is here as uncommon to sit down to table without a
tureen of this rich soup as the first dish, as it would be in
England to eat dinner without bread: in short, during the interim
of our stock increasing sufficiently in this new settlement, to
enable us to kill with propriety, the kangaroo is our principal
support; and as all nations have, <i>ab origine</i>, done before
us, so we may be said to live by the chase but I must be
understood, this chase is not unattended with difficulties of the
extremest nature, with expence, the severest fatigue, and even
danger.<br>
<br>
<small>[* "You will be surprised at the necessity of having such
a quantity of animal food; but in this provision consisted our
only means of paying the men working on our farms for their
labour."]</small><br>
<br>
"In the first place, the labour of a man to hunt four dogs, If of
any merit, is worth 40<i>l</i>. per annum; our dogs, if of good
breed, cannot be purchased for less than 20<i>l</i>. 25<i>l</i>.
and 30<i>l</i>. the pair, and, to hunt with any continued
certainty, you must have at least four, and often more, some
gentlemen having seven or eight, although more than three are
rarely ever hunted at one time; and among these, every person
must have at least one dog that will what we call shew, that is,
the kangaroos are so uncommonly fleet, that nothing but the
swiftest greyhound can equal them; they are of course seldom
killed in sight of the huntsman; and in the wild country, forming
only, on all sides, one impenetrable forest of immense gum trees,
and the deepest underwood, Interspersed nine months of the year
in all directions with runs of water, and with the number of
fallen trees that, it must be supposed, have given way to old
time in 6000 years, the value of the dogs becomes most evident.
After having run a considerable distance from the view of those
hunting them, they will return (frequently after a lapse of two
hours); and if they have killed, one chosen hound will
intuitively conduct his keeper through an almost impassable
brush, for miles, to the exact spot the reward of their vigour
lies in, and if it was not for this quality of the dogs bred in
this country, nine out of ten of the kangaroos killed would be
lost. The chase is so severe, that the strongest dog cannot hunt
more than three times a week, and he is fortunate if he escapes
without being torn in the most dangerous manner, many of our
finest animals being cut to death by the claws of the dying
kangaroo.<br>
<br>
"I have hunted my own dogs, and nothing I have heard of the
amusement can be placed in competition with it. I once laid three
superior dogs on an immense <i>forester</i>, and notwithstanding,
from his entangling himself in a brush, they soon haunched him,
yet, although the man with me exerted all his strength in beating
him with a club, he was not overcome for full fifteen minutes,
snorting the whole time, with one of the strongest dogs in the
colony at his throat, and the two others seizing him as often as
his accursed claws would allow them.<br>
<br>
"It is certainly the grandest sport of the field that can be
imagined, at the same time the most interesting, and the most
dangerous. In this instance I paid dearly for the victory: my two
best dogs were so severely mangled, that I was obliged to leave
them panting in their blood, till I could send for them; and
although the kangaroo weighed 137lb. yet I would not, for twenty
of his weight, have laid up my dogs so seriously as they were.
The chest of one was cut completely across, and so deep, that his
lungs could be plainly seen, added to which, his right side was
as, severely laid open by one kick. The other had the whole under
part of his belly deeply gashed, the scrotum entirely cat away,
and his mouth enlarged from nearly ear to ear! Yet these dogs, in
five weeks, actually were again more savage, and as vigorous as
ever!<br>
<br>
"The fatigue these faithful, and to us invaluable animals, will
undergo, is incredible; and when their feet are so sore and cut
with hard running that they may literally be said, in the old
phrase, not to have a leg to stand on, they are then often hunted
in boots and shoes, that is, with covering for their feet made of
leather, or of the kangaroo skin; and I have at this moment one
of these veterans running with these shoes, a collar of leather
covering a neck so often torn, that he cannot now be risked
without it; and a skin so cut and sewed up in all directions,
that, from no hair growing on the broad cicatrices of the many
severe wounds he has had, he appears at a distance an animal of a
distinct species.<br>
<br>
"The kangaroos here are divided principally into two classes, the
one called <i>brush kangaroos</i>, the other <i>foresters</i>.
The first run from 15 to 50 and 60 lbs. the latter from 40 lbs.
even to 170 lbs. The weight of the tail is in general one pound
in ten of the whole body; thus the tail of a kangaroo of one
hundred weight will weigh about 11 lbs. the whole of which is one
mass of cartilaginous muscle, and makes, as I have said, the
richest and most palatable soup that can be tasted, forming, when
cold, the strongest jelly. It is this weighty appendage to their
bodies that materially assists them in running, by striking it on
the ground, thus assisting the spring they make with their hind
feet, for their fore claws are too short to be of any
service.<br>
<br>
"The skins of these foresters are very valuable for shoes, and
make as fine upper leathers as can be desired; and had we any
manufacture here, the fur would also be of moment. It is rare
that any part but the hind quarters is preserved for food, the
fore quarters being given with the entrails to the dogs, with
which it is necessary they should have an ample portion of ground
maize, and, indeed, their keep is altogether expensive; but this
they amply repay. I however expect that the persecuted kangaroo,
which daily becomes more scarce, will, as was the case at Port
Jackson, forsake the ground contiguous to any of our camps, and
retire so far up the mountains, that, the difficulties of
procuring them will make it cheaper to kill our mutton.<br>
<br>
"Of birds, we have also abundance of sport here; we have teal,
quails, ducks, red birds, water hens, herons, and black swans;
the latter of which we most generally run down in our boats, when
they are moulting their wing feathers. Parrots, which are capital
eating, and small birds, are innumerable, and we have also a most
beautiful feathered pigeon, called the Bronze Wing, from the
similarity of the plumage to rich bronze. In appearance they
rather resemble the dove than the English pigeon, but cannot be
distinguished in flavour from the wood-pigeon of Great
Britain.&mdash;I have purposely first mentioned the small species
of our feathered tribe, that I may the more surprise you with the
colossal <i>Emu</i>.<br>
<br>
"This bird, which exactly resembles the cassowary, we catch here
in great numbers, but it requires the fleetest of our dogs, which
are frequently distanced: they weigh from 40 lbs. to 100 lbs. and
will kill our strongest greyhounds by one blow of their talons.
The chase of them, in the picturesque part of the country they
are found in, is a sight beyond my description, and can only
remind me of what I have thought the romantic tales of Vaillant.
Sometime after our first establishment, being with a party on an
excursion up the river, we suddenly came on a beautiful valley,
not before profaned by an European eye, in which were grazing
seven of these majestic birds: we had three dogs; each
fortunately singled out a separate object, and all, after
uncommon running, killed in sight, as an immense plain was before
us, and we were on an eminence; but the dogs were so exhausted
and bruised in the contest, that we were unable to run them for
some time. These three birds weighed 220lbs. The flesh and fat
cannot possibly be distinguished in appearance from beef, which
it resembles in flavour even more than the kangaroo, and is much
esteemed with us: it is also received in the store, in the above
proportion. I have had ten pounds of solid fat from one bird of
50lbs. which, when rendered down, and well boiled in water, is
equal to the finest butter.<br>
<br>
"The most sure method the dogs have of killing the emu, is to
seize them by the neck, in which they are extremely sensible; and
some of our old hounds are so well aware of this, that they will
often take two in one running. I think, from our ravages, we
gradually accomplish the effect of driving the natives from all
the parts contiguous to any of our camps, which, as they are
treacherous in the extreme, and here as intractable, is much to
be desired, if our residence here is to be desired. Twenty years
has had little effect in taming them at Fort Jackson, their
natural ferocity being aided by the experience of their more
civilized neighbours. They often spear our dogs, and attempt to
pay us the same compliment, and not unfrequently will
<i>waddy</i> our huntsmen, when they have not been inclined to
part with what kangaroo they may have killed.<br>
<br>
"Having now sufficiently put to issue your patience, I shall
conclude by assuring you, the general <i>tergiservatia</i> of
this part of the world has not altered the esteem which I
possessed in a less rude clime of yours.<br>
<br>
"<i>Van Diemen's Land, May 1807</i>."<br>
<br>
<br>
As a proof of the utility of the kangaroo in this infant
settlement, it seems that, owing to a recent temporary
disappointment in receiving the government supplies, the hind
quarters of that animal were received into his majesty's store,
at sixpence per pound, to victual the troops and convicts, in the
proportion of 7 lbs. for seven of salt beef, or 4 lbs. of pork.
Within the course of six months, upwards of 15,000lbs. weight had
been tendered, although only four gentlemen had hunted for the
purpose. This substitute for salt provisions, there can be little
doubt, has been the sole cause of keeping the scurvy away from
the people. Otherwise, instead of being in such health as to make
sickness almost unknown, the people and the settlers that have
since been much increasing, might have been literally
exterminated by those privations which inseparably attach to
those who may be concerned for the first two or three years in
forming a new colony.<br>
<br>
It should be observed, that in a very short period of time, all
apprehensions of a scarcity, even in Van Diemen's land, must
vanish, as there are now in the vicinity of the British
settlements very large tracts of the finest tillage and grazing
land on that side the line.</blockquote>

<center><i>Discoveries by the Nautilus; Kennedy's
Island&mdash;Dexter's Groupe &mdash;Almagan&mdash;Pagan's island,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</i></center>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote><small>CAPTAIN SIMPSON</small>, of the
<i>Nautilus</i>, discovered in south lat. 11 deg. 17 min. and E.
long. l67 deg. 58 min. an island which he called Kennedy's
Island. From its beautiful appearance, and its being well
peopled, he was of opinion that it would prove valuable, as it
produced abundance of hogs.<br>
<br>
"The natives", he says, "are savage, artful, and treacherous upon
Duff's or Dexter's Groupe, which obliged me to fire upon them (a
necessary precaution to those who may wish to land upon them
hereafter). Upon the island Disappointment, I landed some fowls,
sowed several sorts of seeds, and put some plants in the ground.
In two previous voyages I passed this island without the
precaution of looking for land, as I am sure many other
navigators have done. We found upon it the remains of a very
large lower mast next the keel, which led us to think some large
Spanish ship had been wrecked upon it long since, because greatly
decayed. There is scarcely an island in the whole groupe but has
natives upon it; and when our distance sunk the reefs below the
horizon, the natives as they crossed from one island to another
presented the appearance of a regiment of soldiers marching round
the horizon on the surface of the sea. All the islands like these
are exceedingly low, and shew at first a few scattered trees
above the horizon, which will demonstrate their danger to a
seaman. I am fully persuaded not one hundredth part of them are
known to navigators. They appeared to us to be formed of coral
and sand, lightly covered with a thin black soil: the stones on
the shore had the appearance of being burnt, being black, porous,
and light.<br>
<br>
<center><i>Description of the Island of Almagan</i>.</center>
<br>
<br>
"Running down along the north part of this island to Howel Bay,"
the same navigator observes, "I much regret that commercial
interest forbids my proceeding as far as Urac, as connecting and
examining this chain of islands is an object of some consequence
to those who navigate these seas: all that I have seen of them
are extremely fertile and pleasant.<br>
<br>
"The Island of Pagan naturally produces, in an uncommon
abundance, Papaw-apples, sugar-cane, a nut which eats much like
an almond, and is enclosed in a light green rhynd, and a root
which at Sandwich Islands is named peca, which grows and looks
very much like a potatoe, excepting that the stalk is very
different.<br>
<br>
"Being considered as a poison by the Owyeeans, they prepare the
root by washing, after which they mash and mix it up with fresh
water to the consistence of butter. They then let it settle, and
draw the water off. After undergoing this operation several times
they set it in the sun, when, after the last water is drawn off,
it dries soon and resembles flour. It may then be cooked the same
as sago, to which some people give it the preference. It makes a
very good substitute for bread.<br>
<br>
"This island produces a number of plantain or banana trees, and
cocoa nuts. In addition to these we have added, by planting and
sowing in Howel's Bay, in different parts along the shore, water
and musk-melons, with yams, landed and set in a state of
vegetation, cabbage plants, and European potatoes; we also landed
a male and female kid about six weeks old, also two cocks and two
hens.<br>
<br>
"Mr. John Howel, in the <i>Lady Washington</i>, in 1786, landed
some hogs here; and, though none of this species have been seen
since, there can be no doubt of their existence, as the print of
their feet has always been seen. And some of our party thought
they saw the print of the feet of some animal as large as a
horse, and which, judging from the dung, subsisted upon grass.
The birds are of the aquatic kind. That species of land crab
named soldier in the West Indies are also here. Fish abound, and
sharks are numerous near the shore. For a landing, Howel's Bay
should always have the preference. I would never recommend
anchoring near the shore unless a strong trade wind and clear
weather should warrant it safe: in that case I would trust it. As
far as I witnessed, the westerly winds are always indicated by
heavy clouds, light variable airs, and unsettled weather.<br>
<br>
"The north mountain burns very much; the southern ones just
smoke, but very little. Having stored the ship with cocoa nuts,
fire-wood, crabs, and Papaw-apples, and accomplished our
business, we hoisted the boat in at sunset, and made sail for
China.<br>
<br>
"Fresh water is to be had here very sweet and very
good."</blockquote>

<br>
<center><i>Voyage to Ulitea, and Mangea, an unknown
Island</i>.</center>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote><small>THIS</small> we learn by a letter from Sydney,
July 17, 1808, was performed by the <i>Mercury</i>, colonial
schooner, Thomas Reiby, master, from Otaheite, who sailed from
Sydney on the 10th of December, 1807, in company with the <i>King
George</i>. They went together to the Bay of Islands for
refreshments, and separated the 3d of January, in
latitude&mdash;33&deg; 20'; the <i>King George</i> bound for the
Fejees. On the 24th of February she came to anchor in the bay of
Matavai; and, having completed her cargo among the islands, in
two months, on the 20th of April took her departure from Ulitea;
on her return to Port Jackson, made Norfolk Island the 1st of
June, and left the 6th.&mdash;She found the American ship
<i>Amethyst</i>, Captain Smith, at the Islands; from whom she
fortunately received a supply of salt&mdash;that which she had
taken from hence having sunk a full third part from its original
quantity; which, but for the circumstance of her obtaining an
accidental supply, must have been productive of serious
disappointment to the owners. We are sorry to learn, that Captain
Smith had lost several of his people among the islands, who
deserted his ship from an inclination of living among the
natives; to whose friendly disposition toward the English Mr.
Reiby was particularly indebted for the accomplishment of his
object in so short a period.<br>
<br>
The <i>Mercury</i> was hove down at Ulitea; and, upon this
occasion, was moored, as the chiefs affirmed, to the very tree,
which had, upon the like occasion, been made, choice of by
Captain Cook, for heaving down the <i>Resolution</i>; and to
bring to recollection the more strongly that great
circumnavigator's visit to those islands, a chief, named Mahee,
produced a medallion of his Majesty, which his father had
received as a present from Captain Cook; which, after some
solicitation, he at length gave to Mr. Reiby, the reversed side
representing two ships, encircled by the
words&mdash;<i>Resolution</i> and <i>Adventure</i>, MDCCLXXII.
This medal is considerably larger than a crown piece, and was
originally gilt; but which, from the length of time, being
thirty-six years, is now nearly worn off.<br>
<br>
By the order of Laboor, the head chief at Ulitea, a store-house,
100 feet in length and 50 in breadth, was built for the reception
of the <i>Mercury</i>'s stores, the building of which was
completed in a day and a half; so numerous were the workmen.<br>
<br>
Upon leaving the island, the vessel stood towards Mangea, an
island to the south-west of Ulitea, the people of which seen)
perfect strangers to every race of, people but their own. In
their dress and colour they differ little from the Friendly
Islanders, but owing, perhaps, to the total want of intercourse
with civilized visitors, their manners are ferocious, as their
aspects are forbidding. These people are said to be much above
the ordinary size, robust, and very muscular. On the
<i>Mercury</i>'s approach, fifty or sixty canoes went out to meet
her, each canoe having only one man in it, armed with a long
spear and several short ones, As soon as she came to, which was
about two miles from the shore, they went alongside, and
entreated the hands to get nearer, which, together with their
repeated efforts to decoy them into their canoes, produced a
suspicion of their views, and, in consequence, the schooner's
people got ready to defend themselves in case of attack.<br>
<br>
Their numbers prodigiously increasing, every precaution was used
to prevent any from getting on board: they appeared to have no
kind of knowledge of fire arms, which they saw without emotion.
They demanded every moveable they saw on deck, and were
understood, as their language differed little, if at all, from
that of the Otaheitans. The pigs on board they insisted upon
having; frequently praised the size of the Mercury, and requested
lo know whose canoe she was. But at length becoming impatient, a
number grappled with the bowsprit rigging, and endeavoured to
pull her in towards the shore, while others were endeavouring, by
main strength, to pull the bolts from the sides, for the sake of
the iron, with the value of which metal they were doubtless made
acquainted by Captain Cook.<br>
<br>
As they had not any articles for barter, and the <i>Mercury</i>
had not expended the whole of her trade, Mr. Reiby offered to
purchase some of their spears, as they were ingeniously carved;
but none of them would they upon any account part with. At length
they began vehemently to threaten the people on board, if they
continued to object to going on shore: many had spears in their
hands; and one, who had taken a long spear up, with much seeming
composure, while speaking to a seaman in the main chains, of the
name of David Clarke, instead of offering it for barter, as was
expected to be his intention, made a sudden plunge at the belly
of Clarke; who received the spear through his right hand, and
into the left groin, about an inch. The unfortunate man fell upon
receiving the wound, and was with difficulty got in. A general
disposition of attack was now manifested, and self-defence became
a duty:&mdash;two musketoons were immediately discharged among
the foremost; and we are not sorry to observe, that the whole
contents of one were lodged in the body of Clarke's unprovoked
assailant. Their consternation at the noise they heard may easily
be conjectured: they staid not to examine the cause of the
explosion; but, taking to their paddles, in a few minutes reached
the shore, where an immense number were assembled; and the
<i>Mercury</i> took leave of this little inhospitable island,
which is in about 21&deg; 38' S. and 158&deg; 20' E. long.<br>
<br>
It is much to be lamented, that even the Friendly Islanders
should still retain their cruel custom of sacrificing human
beings to their superstitions. On this subject we copy the
following extract from a journal on board the
<i>Mercury</i>:&mdash;"10th of March, at two <i>p. m.</i> saw the
natives at Hubaine murder a man, as a sacrifice, and hang him up
in a basket, in a range with four others, who had suffered the
same fate.&mdash;12th of March, saw a canoe take in the murdered
bodies at Hubaine, to be conveyed to Ulitea, a distance of eight
or ten leagues, there to be buried in their grand morai, or place
of worship."<br>
<br>
On the 14th of March, forty or fifty canoes, with twenty to
thirty men in each, arrived from other parts of Huhaine, to the
bay, at which the Chief Omal commands, to hold a consultation on
the subject of the Bolabolams refusing to pay their yearly
tribute, which was usually paid in swine; and which refusal, it
was supposed, would be productive of an immediate
war.</blockquote>

<br>
<center><i>Voyage from Port Jackson to Prince of Wales's Island,
New Caledonia, &amp;c.</i></center>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote><small>ON</small> Sunday 5th of May, 1803, we
descried the extensive reef mentioned by Captain Cook as lying
off the south-east end of New Caledonia. During that and the
following day we ran before a fresh breeze along the reef,
apparently extending all along the western side of this large
island. A very high mountain which we passed on the 16th received
the name of Mount Buffalo. An opening in the reef, one mile
broad, we found leading to a very extensive harbour. The extent
of the harbour, not less than eighteen or twenty miles, struck us
with astonishment, particularly after entering it through such a
narrow passage.<br>
<br>
A number of islands of various forms and sizes diversified this
sheet of water, the whole surrounded by chains of stupendous
mountains rising one behind the other, as far as the eye could
reach; the tops of many of them hidden in the clouds. Being
evening, the bases of the islands were softened by the setting
sun, and the whole was a solemn, silent and majestic scene, and
impressed the mind with the grandeur of sequestered nature.<br>
<br>
"Watering was the purpose for which we came into this harbour;
however, at day-light the next morning a canoe was seen paddling
towards a small island that lay about a mile from the ship, when
two natives got out of it, and seated themselves on a rock. After
gazing at the ship for some time, one of them stood up and
repeatedly called out <i>Cooe</i>, at which we were not a little
surprised, it being the same word which the natives of Port
Jackson make use of as a friendly invitation. Being answered from
the ship, they returned to their canoe, and were soon joined by
two others. They were tall, stout, good looking men, with high
foreheads, and cheerful, open countenances, in colour nearly
black. Some printed cottons and a few showy articles being given
to them from the cabin windows, they gave some fine mullet and
some yams in return, but could not be prevailed upon to come on
board, till a small piece of red serge was held up to view from
one of the gangways, which they were so eager to possess, that
three of them ventured up the side of the ship without further
hesitation One of them we supposed to be a chief, from the
peculiarity of his head dress. This was a sort of cap, made of
very fine bark, projecting very far behind from the head, bound
tight round it with a fillet, and adorned on one side by a bunch
of feathers, which appeared to be those of a heron. This man was
of a lighter colour, and taller, than the others. A lady on board
tied a broad pink sash across his shoulders, which pleased him so
much, that he sat by her all the time they were at breakfast, of
which, however, he could not be persuaded to partake.<br>
<br>
"On Saturday the 21st several canoes of a considerably larger
size than any yet seen, came off to us. The people in them
appeared to be of a larger make than those we had seen before.
Their projecting brows and ferocious countenances gave an idea of
cannibalism, and they did not seem to be of the same race as
those before described.<br>
<br>
"The savages of this quarter use large clubs which they call
<i>bagos</i>, made of various materials: these and their spears
they were willing to barter for trifles.<br>
<br>
"Soon after this a double canoe, the first of that kind seen
there, made its appearance and came alongside the ship with
several articles to barter. A complete platform was laid across
the two hulls, on which were their fires; and by two round holes
in a plank fixed at each end of the platform, it appeared that
through each of them a paddle was introduced, with which they
sculled in a perpendicular direction.<br>
<br>
"These savages, like most others, proved to be thieves. Such was
their rage for small pieces of cloth and linen, blue, scarlet,
and crimson, that at length, attempting to steal the colours of
the ship, it was found necessary to fire upon them.<br>
<br>
"While some of them were on board, they were particularly
attentive to the flute. They also listened attentively to a song
which a lady sung, and joined chorus with her in the tune of
'tink a tink'. Their voices were reckoned soft and melodious. The
dangerous reef first mentioned extends three hundred miles along
the south-west coast of New Caledonia."<br>
<br>
On the 16th of July pumice stones were discovered floating on the
sea as far as the eye could reach: two volcanic islands were
known to exist about 100 miles from where this observation was
made. To some concussion in those islands, it was attributed that
the sea was violently agitated. The moon was obscured by black
heavy clouds; vivid flashes of lightning with loud peals of
thunder accompanied the rain, which fell in torrents. Sheets of
pumice stone almost stopped the ship's way, which laboured
through them with a crashing noise.<br>
<br>
A group of islands (the Admiralty Islands) on one side, and two
immense rocks rising high out of the midst of the water on the
other; as great a sea as is usually met with in the Bay of
Biscay, and a current so strong as to set the ship upwards of
forty miles to the northward in one day, excited no small alarm.
In the same latitude, and perhaps under similar circumstances, it
is thought the two vessels under M. La Perouse, viz. the
<i>Boussole</i> and <i>Astrolabe</i>, perished with all their
people, or fell into the hands of the savages, particularly as
the <i>Sirius</i> English frigate, navigating here in 1790, had
seen savages dressed in the uniforms of French marines, and other
persons who wore European stuffs, and different pieces of cloth
in their dress. These people also hung out a <i>white flag</i> as
the signal for the English to approach; but though Captain Hunter
was desirous of so doing, he found it impracticable on account of
the contrary currents and winds, and the danger to which he must
have been exposed by the numerous shoals. These strong currents,
Captain Hunter told Monsieur Breaudet at the Cape of Good Hope,
had carried the <i>Sirius</i> six hundred miles to the eastward
in the space often days, and he seemed fully persuaded that the
European dresses which he saw in the boats from the Admiralty
Islands were collected from the vessels formerly under the
command of La Perouse.<br>
<br>
M. de la Perouse was at Botany Bay with his two vessels in 1788,
bound on a voyage of discovery, and Captain Hunter had often seen
the French navigator, and had been upon terms of intimacy with
him.<br>
<br>
But to return to the vessel whose voyage we have been describing.
In a violent gale in passing between the islands of Bourou and
Manipa, the water suddenly changed its colour to a milky
whiteness. This phenomenon is said to occur twice a year in the
seas round Banda, and sometimes it reaches, apparently
diversified with black stripes, as far as Amboyna itself. It is
dangerous at these limes for small boats to navigate
it.</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<center><i>The Islands of Simboo, New Ireland,
&amp;c.</i></center>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote><small>THE</small> first of these is one which in
Bouganville's Straits is called the Brothers. Some of the
inhabitants, when an English vessel was passing in June 1803, put
off in a canoe, bringing with them bread fruit, cocoa nuts, and
some ornaments made of tortoise-shell and mother of pearl, for
which they wanted hammers and hatchets in return. These people
and their canoes formed a striking contrast with those of New
Caledonia: the whiteness of the teeth of the latter was
unsullied, but the islanders of Simboo, constantly chewing the
beetle nut, had their teeth as black as their skins, which were
some shades darker than those of New Caledonia. Many of the
former, too, had their hair powdered with some excessively white
substance: their eyebrows being filled with it, and circles drawn
round their eyes and mouth, they looked at a distance as if they
wore masks. They also wore small shells, like beads, as bandeaus,
necklaces, ear-rings, and girdles of the same, with bracelets of
pearl round their arms and legs. Their weapons are spears, bows
and arrows; the former and the latter jagged on each side with
notches like teeth.<br>
<br>
The island of Simboo bore the appearance of a garden in high
preservation. Even the ascents were covered with cocoa nut, bread
fruit and banana tree, down to the water's edge, while a fine
aromatic smell came wafted with the breeze very reviving, as the
weather had been excessively hot for some days. The dexterity of
the inhabitants here in thieving was such, that they fairly run
up the sides of the ship without any difficulty, and one of them
even snatched up two bayonets lying upon the quarter deck in the
presence of several officers and swam off. No boat has ever been
seen that could overtake one of their canoes. Their dexterity in
the water is truly astonishing. One of these savages even seemed
disposed to have siezed a child about ten years of age, the son
of the gunner, and to have jumped overboard with him, but his
design was discovered before he could put it into execution.<br>
<br>
The islands that lie contiguous to Simboo are called Bellala,
Ganunga, Peteranna, Sappa and Java. Solomon's islands were seen
next, and afterwards Bouganville's.<br>
<br>
By the 5th of July, the vessel was off New Ireland and the
islands of Bournaud and Oraison. The canoes used here seemed to
be hollowed out of trees, like those of New Caledonia. The
natives are large and athletic, of a dark copper colour, and
entirely naked. One of them was observed to have a large human
arm bone fixed as a handle to a spear, with six rows of human
teeth round it. Their bushy hair is cut in the form of a helmet;
the centre part, from the neck to the forehead, loaded with a red
powder resembling brick dust. One side of the face is nearly
covered with a yellow composition like thick plaister, and the
other with one of white.<br>
<br>
Off the extreme west point of New Ireland, it appears there are
numerous islands of various beautiful shapes, covered with trees,
mostly cocoa nuts, none of which are laid down in the charts of
M. Bouganville: but this is easily accounted for; that navigator
having sailed at a considerable distance from the shore, whilst
on the contrary the English vessel from New South Wales coasted
the whole length of New Ireland, within a few miles of
it.</blockquote>

<br>
<center>REMARKABLE PERSONS.<br>
<br>
<i>Captain Bligh.</i></center>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote><small>AMONG</small> those persons who have rendered
themselves conspicuous through any of the connections they have
had with this colony. Captain William (late Governor) Bligh is
certainly one of the most distinguished. The first event which
brought him into public notice was when he had the command of the
<i>Bounty</i>, in which he sailed from England in the autumn of
1787 on a voyage to the Society Islands, for bread-fruit trees,
in order to cultivate them in our West India islands. Having
completed the object of her voyage, the Bounty quitted Otaheite
on the 11th of April, 1789, and was pursuing her course across
the Pacific Ocean, towards the Moluccas, when on the 28th of the
same month, at day-break, Captain Bligh was siezed in his cabin
by a part of the crew, and, with eighteen others, mostly
officers, forcibly put into the long boat with a very scanty
portion of provisions and water. In hopes of making some addition
to their stock, these people in the boat put back to one of the
Friendly Islands, where, being attacked by the natives, who
killed one of the crew and wounded several others, they
determined upon steering their course to Timor, a Dutch
settlement, where they arrived alter a tedious and most
distressing passage of forty-six days in a crazy open boat,
without even an awning to defend them from the rain which fell
almost incessantly forty days out of the forty-six. Added to
this, a heavy sea and squally weather enhanced their misery. But
having received from the Dutch governor at Timor every necessary
succour, the crew were sent from thence to Batavia. Captain Bligh
arrived in England in March following. The mutineers, then said
to be twenty-five in number, were headed by one Christian
Fletcher, the master's mate, and stood away, as it was supposed,
for Otaheite. However, for a number of years, as no kind of
intelligence whatever was received either of the <i>Bounty</i> or
its mutinous crew, it was generally supposed that both had been
lost. In a word, the fate of Christian Fletcher and the rest of
the mutineers of the <i>Bounty</i> had remained a mystery almost
twenty years, when it seemed to be reserved for an American, a
Captain Folgar, of Boston, to throw a light upon this dark
transaction. Writing from Valperaiso, under the date of October
10, 1808, he relates, that upon landing at Pitcairn's Island, or
Incarnation of Quiros, in lat. 25 deg. 2 min. long. 130 deg, by
lunar observation, he found there an Englishman by the name of
Alexander Smith, the only person remaining of nine that escaped
in his Majesty's late ship the <i>Bounty</i>, Captain W. Bligh.
Smith relates that after getting Captain Bligh in the boat,
Christian, the leader of the mutiny, took the command of the ship
and went to Otaheite, where great part of the crew left it,
except himself (Smith) and seven others, who each took wives and
six Otaheitan men as servants, and shortly after arrived at this
island (Quiros), where they run the ship on shore and broke her
up. This was in 1790. Four years afterwards a great jealousy
breaking out among the Otaheitans, they revolted and killed every
Englishman except himself, whom they severely wounded in the neck
with a pistol ball. The same night the widows of the deceased
Englishmen rose and put to death the whole of the Otaheitans,
leaving Smith the only man alive upon the island, with eight or
nine women and several small children. When he recovered, he
applied himself to tilling the ground, so that it now produces
plenty of yams, cocoa nuts, bananas, plantains, hogs and poultry
in abundance. Some of the children of the mutineers are now grown
up men and women, the whole population amounting to thirty-five,
who acknowledge Smith as father and commander of them all. They
all speak English, and have been educated by him, as Cap. Folgar
relates, in a religious and moral way. Christian Fletcher, it is
said, became insane soon after he reached the island, and threw
himself off the rocks into the sea. The island is badly supplied
with water, and, having no anchorage for ships, was thought to
have been chosen by the mutineers as a place of safety. Smith
gave Capt. Folgar a chronometer made by Kendall, which was taken
from him by the governor of Juan Fernandez.<br>
<br>
But to return to Captain Bligh. Being found to be an active and
skilful officer, we soon found him again employed in the South
seas; and when Monsieur Labillardi&egrave;re was on his voyage in
search of La Perouse, he saw on the shore of Adventure Bay
several inscriptions engraved on trunks of trees, by which, he
says, he learned that Captain Bligh had been there in February
1792, when upon his voyage to the Society Islands for bread-fruit
trees, which he was to carry to the English colonies in the West
Indies lying between the tropics. This was Captain Bligh's second
voyage in the <i>Providence</i> sloop.<br>
<br>
Bligh had with him two botanists, who sowed, at a little distance
from the shore, cresses, a few acorns, celery, &amp;c. Three
young fig trees, two pomegranate trees, and a quince tree, which
the English planted, were likewise found; but one tree had
perished, because the following inscription, found on the trunk
of a large tree near the spot, mentioned seven:<br>
<br>
"Near this tree Captain William Bligh planted seven fruit trees
1792 Messrs S and W botanists".<br>
<br>
Other inscriptions were couched in nearly similar terms. They
all, M. Labillardi&egrave;re observed, "displayed the same marks
of deference which the English botanists paid the commander of
their ship, by putting only the initial letters of their own
names, and expressing that the captain himself had sowed and
planted the various vegetable productions which he had carried
from Europe;" but, be added, "I am much inclined to doubt whether
Bligh was very sensible of the honour which the botanists were
desirous of paying him."<br>
<br>
But, waving the opinion of the French navigator, it is evident
that his services in the new settlement have been considered of
sufficient importance to raise him to the arduous appointment of
governor, in which he continued a considerable period. And it was
not till some serious difference occurred between him and
Lieutenant Governor Paterson that we again heard of the former
gentleman, by means of a proclamation issued by the Governor W.
Paterson, Esq. in the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> for Sunday, March 26,
1809, charging him with a breach of the peace, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding the plausibility of Captain Bligh's Narrative
which he published in England, relative to the <i>Bounty</i>, and
(he particular conduct of Christian Fletcher, Monsieur
Labillardi&egrave;re seems to differ very much with him.
Respecting these mutineers, he says, "We learned that the
<i>Pandora</i> English frigate, Captain Edwards, had since been
at Society Islands, where they had siezed fourteen of the
mutineers. Four of them afterwards made their escape when that
vessel was run aground off Norfolk Island. The ringleader of the
mutineers. Christian, had escaped with nine others to another
island, and carried several of the natives with him. One of the
officers of the <i>Pandora</i>, lately arrived at the Cape,
assured us that Bligh had <i>behaved very ill to Christian</i>,
and that an abuse of authority on the side of the captain was the
cause of <i>all his subsequent misfortunes</i>. Christian, though
master of the vessel, had been maltreated according to Captain
Bligh's orders, as if he had been a common sailor of the lowest
rank. If this be the fact. Captain Bligh disguises the truth when
he asserts that he had always treated him with the greatest
liberality.</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<center><i>Lieutenant Riou.</i></center>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>To the instance of Captain Bligh, &amp;c. we may
still add what will appear singular in the fate of another naval
character who has been connected with the new colony; viz.
Lieutenant Riou, commander of his Majesty's ship <i>Guardian</i>,
bound with stores and provisions for the settlement at Port
Jackson in 1790, when in the course of their voyage from the Cape
of Good Hope they fell in with an island, or rather a mountain of
ice, twice as high as the mast head; with which getting
encumbered, the ship received so much damage that the greatest
part of the crew took to their boats; one of which, after
encountering the greatest hardships, was taken by a French ship,
and the crew landed at the Cape of Good Hope.<br>
<br>
The <i>Guardian</i> remained for some days in the same state as
when the boats left her at the mercy of the winds and waves,
being without a rudder, and every instant in danger of being
swallowed up in the yawning gulph beneath them; but as Lieutenant
Riou, with that true spirit of enterprize and heroism which has
so frequently distinguished the British sailor, could never be
persuaded to leave the vessel, at length the few, by their united
efforts, disengaged the ship, and she was providentially enabled
to make her way to the Cape of Good Hope.<br>
<br>
Lieutenant Edward Riou, being afterwards made captain of the
<i>Amazon</i> frigate, at length, as his monument in St. Paul's
Cathedral, with Captain Robert Moss of the <i>Monarch</i>,
expresses it, "fell gloriously fighting for their country in the
memorable attack on Copenhagen, under the command of the late
Vice Admiral Lord Nelson, on the first of April
1801."</blockquote>
<br>
<center><i>Messrs. Muir, Margarot, Skirving, and
Palmer.</i></center>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Mr. Barrington, in his History of New South Wales,
has barely noticed the escape of Mr. Thomas Muir, one of the
persons sent to that country for sedition in 1795 with Messrs.
Gerald, Margarot, and Skirving. He took the advantage of the
departure of the <i>Otter</i> for America, leaving a letter in
which he said that, in withdrawing, he conceived he had only
asserted his freedom. However, from an inhabitant of the colony,
we have received the following description and character of Mr.
Muir's three colleagues, all equally sentenced to New South
Wales.<br>
<br>
"Of Mr. Gerald, I beg leave to say that not even elegant manners,
great abilities, with a happy mode of placing them in the best
point of view, and the gifts of nature matured by education,
could save him from, landing an exile (to call him by no worse a
name) on a barbarous shore, where the few who were civilized must
pity, while they admired him. And, I am sorry to say, he arrived
In a very weak and impaired state of health.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Gerald did not recover the shock which his constitution had
suffered. At three in the morning of the 16th (of March) he
breathed his last. A consumption which accompanied him from
England, and which all his wishes and efforts to shake off could
not overcome, at length brought him to that period when, perhaps,
his strong enlightened mind must have perceived <i>how full of
vanity and vexation of spirit were the busiest concerns of this
world</i>; and into what a narrow limit was now to be thrust that
frame which but of late trod firmly in the walk of life, elate
and glowing with youthful hope, glorying in being a martyr to the
cause of Freedom, and considering as an honour that exile which
brought him to an untimely grave. He was buried in the garden of
a little spot of ground which he had purchased at Farm Cove.<br>
<br>
"He was followed in three days after by another victim to the
same opinions, Mr. William Skirving. A dysentery was the apparent
cause of his death, but his heart was broken. In the hope of
receiving remittances from England, which might enable him to
proceed with spirit and success in farming, of which he appeared
to have a thorough knowledge, he had purchased from different
persons, who had ground to sell, about one hundred acres of land
adjacent to the town of Sydney.<br>
<br>
"He soon found that a farm near the sea-coast was of no great
value. His attention and his efforts to cultivate the ground were
of no avail. Remittances he received none: he contracted some
little debts, and found himself neglected by that party for whom
he had sacrificed the dearest connexions in life,&mdash;&mdash;a
wife and family; and finally yielded to the pressure of this
accumulated weight.<br>
<br>
"Among us, he was a <i>pious, honest, worthy</i> character. In
this settlement his political principles never manifested
themselves; but all his solicitude seemed to be, to evince
himself the friend of human nature.&mdash;<i>Requiescat in
pace!</i>"</blockquote>
<br>
<center><i>Bruce, an Englishman, married to a Princess of New
Zealand.</i></center>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Another instance of a remarkable character connected
with this rising colony we have in the following accounts from
Calcutta written in May 1809.<br>
<br>
"George Bruce, son of John Bruce, foreman and clerk to Mr. Wood,
distiller, at Limehouse, was born in the parish of
Ratcliffe-highway, in 1779. In 1789 he entered on board the
<i>Royal Admiral</i> East Indiaman, Captain Bond, as boatswain's
boy. Sailed from England for New South Wales, and arrived at Port
Jackson in 1790, where, with the consent of Captain Bond, he
quitted the ship, and remained at New South Wales.<br>
<br>
"At Port Jackson Bruce entered into the naval colonial service,
and was employed for several years under Lieutenants Robins,
Flinders, and others, in exploring the coasts, surveying
harbours, headlands, rocks, &amp;c. During this time Bruce
experienced various adventures, which do not come within the
design of this narrative. After being thus employed for several
years in vessels of survey, he was turned over to the <i>Lady
Nelson</i>, Captain Simmonds, a vessel fitted up for the express
purpose of conveying Tippahee, King of New Zealand, from a visit
which he made to the Government of Port Jackson to his own
country. The King embarked, and the <i>Nelson</i> sailed on her
destination. During the passage, Tippahee was taken dangerously
ill, and Bruce was appointed to attend him: he acquitted himself
so highly to the King's satisfaction, that he was honoured with
his special favour; and, on their arrival, the King requested
that he should be allowed to remain with him at New Zealand, to
which Captain Simmonds consented, and Bruce was received into the
family of Tippahee.<br>
<br>
"Bruce spent his first few months in New Zealand in exploring the
country, and in acquiring a knowledge of the language, manners,
and customs of the people. He found the country healthy and
pleasant, full of romantic scenery, agreeably diversified by
hills and dales, and covered with wood.&mdash;The people were
hospitable, frank, and open; though rude and ignorant, yet
worshipping neither images nor idols, nor aught that is the work
of human hands; acknowledging one Omnipotent Supreme Being.<br>
<br>
"As the King proposed to place the young Englishman at the head
of his army, it was a previously necessary step that he should be
tattowed, as, without having undergone that ceremony, he could
not be regarded as a warrior. The case was urgent, and admitted
of no alternative. He therefore submitted resolutely to this
painful ceremony, and his countenance presents a master specimen
of the art of tattowing.<br>
<br>
"Being now tattowed in due form, Bruce was recognized as a
warrior of the first rank, naturalized as a New Zealander,
received into the bosom of the King's family, and honoured with
the hand of the Princess Actoekoe, the youngest daughter of
Tippahee, a maiden of fifteen or sixteen years of age, whose
native beauty had probably been great, but which has been so much
improved by the fashionable embellishments of art, that all the
softer charms of nature, all the sweetness of original
expression, are lost in the bolder impressions of tattowing.<br>
<br>
"Bruce now became the chief member of the King's family, and was
vested with the government of the island. Six or eight months
after his marriage, the English ships Inspector, the
<i>Ferret</i> South Sea whaler, and several other English
vessels, touched at New Zealand for supplies, and all of them
found the beneficial influence of having a countryman and friend
at the head of affairs in that island. They were liberally
supplied with fish, vegetables, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br>
<br>
"Our Englishman and his wife were now contented and happy, in the
full enjoyment of domestic comfort, with no wants that were
ungratified, blessed with health and perfect independence. Bruce
looked forward with satisfaction to the progress of civilization,
which he expected to introduce among the people with whom, by a
singular destiny, he seemed doomed to remain during his life.
While enjoying these hopes, the ship <i>General Wellesley</i>,
about twelve or fourteen months ago, touched at a point of New
Zealand where Bruce and his wife then chanced to be. This was at
some distance from the King's place of residence. Captain
Dalrymple applied to Bruce to assist him in procuring a cargo of
spars and benjamin, and requested specimens, of the principal
articles of produce of the island, all which was cheerfully done.
Captain Dalrymple then proposed to Bruce to accompany him to
North Cape, distant about twenty-five or thirty leagues, where it
was reported that gold dust could be procured, and Captain
Dalrymple conceived that Bruce might prove useful to him in the
search for the gold dust. With great reluctance, and after many
entreaties, Bruce consented to accompany Captain Dalrymple, under
the most solemn assurances of being safely brought back and
landed at the Bay of Islands. He accordingly embarked with his
wife on board the <i>General Wellesley</i>, representing, at the
same time, to Captain Dalrymple the dangerous consequences of
taking the King's daughter from the island; but that fear was
quieted by the solemn and repeated assurances of Captain
Dalrymple, that he would, at every hazard, reland them at the Bay
of Islands, the place from which they embarked. Being at length
all on board, the <i>Wellesley</i> sailed for the North Cape,
where they soon arrived and landed. Finding that they had been
entirely misinformed as to the gold dust, the <i>Wellesley</i>
made sail, in order to return to New Zealand&mdash;but the wind
becoming foul, and continuing so for forty-eight hours, they were
driven from the island. On the third day the wind became more
favourable, but Capt. Dalrymple did not attempt to regain the
island, but stood on for India. Bruce now gently remonstrated,
and reminded him of his promises; to which Captain Dalrymple
replied, 'That he had something else to think of, than to detain
the ship, by returning with a valuable cargo to the island.
Besides, he had another and better island in view for him.'<br>
<br>
"On reaching the Feegee, or Sandalwood Islands, Captain Dalrymple
asked Bruce, if he chose to go on shore, and remain there? which
he declined, on account of the barbarous and sanguinary
disposition of their inhabitants. Captain D. desired that he
would choose for himself; and then took from him several little
presents, which he himself and his officers had given to him at
New Zealand; these now were given to the natives of the islands,
in the boats then alongside the vessel.<br>
<br>
"Leaving the Feegee islands, they steered towards Sooloo,
visiting two or three islands in their passage; but the limits of
this narrative do not admit of giving any account of the
occurrences at those places, though they are not devoid of
interest.&mdash;After remaining four or five days at Sooloo, they
sailed for Malacca, where they arrived in December last. At
Malacca, Captain Dalrymple and Bruce went on shore. The latter
was anxious to see the governor or commanding officer, to state
his grievances; but as it was late in the evening when he landed,
he could not see him till the following morning, by which time
Captain Dalrymple had weighed from Malacca roads, leaving Bruce
on shore, and carrying off his wife on board the <i>Wellesley</i>
to Penang.<br>
<br>
"Bruce acquainted the Commanding Officer at Malacca with his
case, and expressed his wish to regain his wife, and to return
with her to New Zealand. The Commanding Officer endeavoured to
console him; desired that he would patiently wait at Malacca, for
a short time, as some ships might probably touch there, on their
passage from Bengal to New South Wales, by which he would procure
a passage for himself and his wife; and that, in the mean time,
he would write to Penang, desiring that his wife should be
returned to her husband at Malacca. After waiting three or four
weeks, accounts were received of Captain Dalrymple's arrival at
Penang; upon which Bruce obtained the Commanding Officer's
permission, and left Malacca in the <i>Scourge</i> gun-brig, for
Penang, where, upon his arrival, he found that his wife had been
bartered away to Captain Ross. On waiting upon the Governor of
Penang, he was asked what satisfaction he required for the ill
treatment he had experienced? Bruce answered, that all he wanted
was to have his wife restored, and to get a passage, if possible,
to New Zealand. Through the interference of the Governor, his
wife was restored to him. With her he returned to Malacca, in
hope of the promised passage to New South Wales; but as there was
no appearance of the expected ships for that port, he was now
promised a passage for himself and his wife to England, in one of
the homeward-bound India-men from China. By getting to England,
he hoped from thence to find a passage to New South Wales; but
the China ships only anchored in Malacca roads for a few hours,
during the night, so that he had no opportunity of proceeding by
any of the ships of that fleet. He then entreated the Commanding
Officer to get him a passage in the <i>Sir Edward Pellew</i> to
Penang, where he hoped to overtake the Indiamen. A passage for
himself and his wife was accordingly provided on board the
<i>Pellew</i>; and, on his arrival at Penang, he found the
Indiamen standing still there; but he could nut be accommodated
with a passage to Europe without the payment of four hundred
dollars. Not having that sum, and without the means to raise It,
he came on with the Sir Edward Pellew to Bengal, where he and his
wife, the affectionate companion of his distress, have been most
hospitably received, and where, their hardships and long
sufferings will be soothed and forgotten in the kindness that
awaits them. Opportunities will probably occur, in the course of
a few months, of a passage to New South Wales, from whence they
will find no difficulty in reaching New Zealand.<br>
<br>
"It was believed that the visit of Prince Tippahee to Port
Jackson had partly for its object to inquire after his favourite
daughter and his son-in-law, who had been carried so
unaccountably from his coasts."<br>
<br>
Through this channel we now learn that, besides the flax and hemp
for which New Zealand is famous, the white benjamin tree, &amp;c.
mines of different valuable metals are known to exist in the
exterior. Specimens of their ores have been obtained; but, from
the total ignorance of the people in metallurgy, or in any other
art of civilized countries, their mines remain unwrought. Iron
ores are found in great abundance; and with these the natives
paint both themselves and their canoes.<br>
<br>
Cabbages, the common and the sweet potatoe, yams, parsnips,
turnips, carrots, &amp;c. rank among their garden vegetables.
They have a plant somewhat resembling a fern, with a large
farinaceous root, which, when roasted, is a pleasant, wholesome
food, and is a most excellent substitute for bread. They have
also fruit trees, some of which are indigenous, others arc
exotic. The orange and the peach have both been introduced from
the Cape of Good Hope, and are in a very thriving way.<br>
<br>
Breeds of swine and goats have been lately brought into New
Zealand, and are increasing rapidly. Fish they possess in great
variety and profusion, and during all the months of the year. In
the summer season they are visited by shoals of mackarel; and,
during the winter, their coasts are frequented by immense
quantities of herrings.&mdash;The island is watered by many fine
rivers, which abound with fish, some of which are well known in
Europe, while others seem peculiar to the countries in the
Southern Ocean. The shores of the rivers and their lakes are
frequented by wild geese and wild ducks; but it is remarkable
that they have no tame web-footed birds. The only quadruped on
the land is a kind of fox, and their only reptile a dull sluggish
lizard.<br>
