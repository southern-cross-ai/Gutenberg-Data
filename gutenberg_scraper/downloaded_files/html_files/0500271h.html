  "Cottswold Ommony is no man's fool."</h2>

  <p class="verse" style="margin-left:20%">Tides in the ocean of stars and the
infinite rhythm of
  space;<br>
  Cycles on cycles of aeons adrone on an infinite beach;<br>
  Pause and recession and flow, and each atom of dust in its place<br>
  In the pulse of eternal becoming; no error, no breach<br>
  But the calm and the sweep and the swing of the leisurely,measureless
  roll<br>
  Of the absolute cause, the unthwarted effect&mdash;and no haste,<br>
  And no discord, and nothing untimed in a calculus ruling the whole;<br>
  Unfolding; evolving; accretion; attrition; no waste.<br>
  <br>
  Planet on planet a course that it keeps, and each swallow its flight;<br>
  Comet's ellipse and grace-note of the sudden firefly glow;<br>
  Jewels of Perseid splendor sprayed on summer's purple night;<br>
  Blossom adrift on the breath of spring; the whirl of snow;<br>
  Grit on the grinding beaches; spume of the storm-ridden wave<br>
  Hurled on the north wind's ice-born blast to blend with the tropic rain;<br>
  Hail and the hissing of torrents; song where sapphire ripples lave<br>
  The crest of thousand-fathom reefs upbuilt beneath the main,<br>
  <br>
  Silt of the ceaseless rivers from the mountain summits worn,<br>
  Rolled along gorge and meadow till the salt, inflowing tide<br>
  Heaps it in shoals at harbor-mouth for continents unborn;<br>
  Earth where the naked rocks were reared; pine where the birches died;<br>
  Season on season proceeding, and birth in the shadow of death;<br>
  Dawning of luminous day in the dying of night; and a Plan<br>
  In no whit, in no particle changing; each phase of becoming a breath<br>
  Of the infinite Karma of all things; its goal, evolution of MAN.<br>
  <br>
  &mdash;Evolution</p><br>

  <p class="first">IF you want views about the world's news, read what
  Cottswold Ommony calls the views papers; there is plenty in them that
  thoroughly zealous people believe. But remember the wise old ambassador's
  word of caution to his new subordinate&mdash;"And above all, no zeal!" If you
  want raw facts devoid of any zeal whatever try the cafes and the clubs; but
  you must sort the facts and correlate them for yourself, and whether or not
  that process shall leave you capable of thought of any kind must depend
  entirely on your own ability. Thereafter, though you may never again believe
  a newspaper, you will understand them and if you are reasonably human
  sympathize.</p>

  <p>There used to be a cafe, in Vienna, where a man might learn enough in
  fifty minutes to convince him that Europe was riding carelessly to ruin; but
  that was before 1914 when the riders, using rein and spur at last, rode
  straight for it.</p>

  <p>There is still a club in Delhi, where you may pick up odds and ends of
  information from over the Pamirs, from Nepal, from Samarkand, Turkestan,
  Arabia and the Caucasus, all mixed up with fragments from the olla podrida*
  of races known collectively as India. And having pieced them all together you
  may go mad there, as comfortably as in Colney Hatch, but with this advantage
  that nobody will interfere with you, provided you pay your bills on the first
  of the month and refrain from sitting on two newspapers while you read a
  third.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>olla podrida</i> (Spanish)&mdash;hodgepodge;
  mixture; literally: a stew of highly seasoned meat and vegetables. For more
  information, see the <i>Wikipedia</i> article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olla_podrida">Olla podrida</a>. ]</p>

  <p>It is a good club, of the die-hard kind; fairly comfortable, famous for
  its curry. It has done more to establish empire, and to breed ill-will, than
  any other dozen institutions. Its members do not boast, but are proud of the
  fact that no Indian, not even a Maharajah,* has ever set foot over its
  threshold; yet they are hospitable, if a man knows how to procure the proper
  introduction (no women are admitted on any pretense), and by keeping quiet in
  a long-armed chair you may receive an education. You may learn, for instance,
  who is and who is not important, and precisely why. You may come to
  understand how the old guard, everywhere, inevitably must die in the last
  ditch. And, if you have it in you, you will admire the old guard, without
  trying to pretend that you agree with them.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Maharajah, Maharaja</i> (Hindi, "high king")
  &mdash;a king or prince in India ranking above a rajah, especially the
  sovereign of one of the former native states. The female equivalent to
  Maharaja is Maharani (or Maharanee), a title used either by the wife of a
  Maharaja or, in the few states where that is possible, by a woman ruling in
  her own right. Paraphrased from <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja">Wikipedia</a></i>.]</p>

  <p>But above all, you may study the naked shape of modern history as she is
  never written&mdash;history in the bathroom, so to speak. And once in a
  while, you may piece together a dozen assorted facts into a true story that
  is worth more than all the printed histories and all the guide-books added
  together. (Not that the club members realize it. They are usually bored, and
  almost always thinking about income-tax and indigestion, coupled with why in
  thunder so-and-so was fool enough to bid no trumps and trust to his partner
  to hold the necessary ace.)</p>

  <p>When Ommony turned up at the club after three years in a forest he
  produced a refreshing ripple on a calm that had grown monotonous. For a week
  there had been nothing to discuss but politics, in which there is no news
  nowadays, but only repetition of complaint. But Cottswold Ommony, the last of
  the old-time foresters (and one of the few remaining men in India whom the
  new democracy has not reduced to a sort of scapegoat rubber-stamp), stirred
  memories and conjecture.</p>

  <p>"His turn for the guillotine! He has done too damned well for twenty
  years, not to have his head cut off. I'll bet you some babu* politician gets
  his job!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>babu, baboo</i> (Hindi)&mdash;gentleman; used as a
  Hindi courtesy title; equivalent to English "Mr"; also: a Hindu clerk who is
  literate in English; also, when used derogatively: a native of India who has
  acquired some superficial education in English. <i><a href=

bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:96.hobson">Baboo</a>
  in <i>The Hobson Jobson Dictionary</i>. ]</p>

  <p>"You'll have to make that bet with Ommony, if he's mad enough. Didn't you
  hear poor Willoughby was killed? That leaves Jenkins at the head of Ommony's
  department, and they've hated each other since Jenkins turned down Ommony's
  younger sister and Ommony told him what he thought about it. Not that the
  girl wasn't fortunate in a way. She married Terry later on and died. Who'd
  not rather die than have to live with Jenkins. Willoughby always considered
  Ommony to be a reincarnation of Solon or Socrates, plus Aristides crossed on
  Hypatia.* Willoughby&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Solon, Socrates, Aristides, Hypatia</i> &mdash;
  famous Greeks:<br>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon">Solon</a> (638?-559? BCE) - an
  Athenian lawgiver and poet. His reforms preserved a class system based on
  wealth but ended privilege by birth.<br>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates">Socrates</a> (470?-399 BCE) -
  a philosopher whose indefatigable search for ethical knowledge challenged
  conventional mores and led to his trial and execution on charges of impiety
  and corrupting the youth. Although Socrates wrote nothing, his method of
  question and answer is captured in the dialogues of Plato, his greatest
  pupil.<br>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristides">Aristides</a> (530?-468?
  BCE) - an Athenian statesman and general. One of the 10 generals who
  commanded the Athenians at the battle of Marathon (490 BCE. Is considered to
  be a classic example of probity in public life and was called Aristides the
  Just.<br>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia_of_Alexandria">Hypatia of
  Alexandria</a> (370-415 CE) - a Greek philosopher and mathematician. About
  400 ce she became head of the Platonist school at Alexandria, where she
  lectured on the philosophy known as Neoplatonism. This combined Plato's ideas
  with a mix of Christian, Jewish, and East Asian influences and emphasized
  striving for an unreachable ultimate reality. Her edition of Euclid's
  "Elements," prepared with her father, became the basis for all later
  versions. Christians deemed her philosophical views pagan and killed her
  during antipagan riots. She is considered to be the first woman of any
  importance in the history of mathematics.<br>

  <p>But everybody knew the ins and outs of that news. A fat babu in a dirty
  pink turban that would have scared any self-respecting horse, driving a
  second-hand Ford, with one eye on the Punjabi "constabeel" at the street
  crossing, bumped into and broke the wheel of Willoughby's dogcart, setting
  any number of sequences in motion. The horse bolted, tipped out Willoughby,
  who was killed under a tram-car, and crashed into Amramchudder Son and
  Company's open store-front, where blood from the horse's shoulder spoiled two
  bales of imported silk. A lawsuit to recover ten times the value of the silk
  was commenced against Willoughby's estate that afternoon. (Mrs. Willoughby
  had to borrow money from friends to carry on with.)</p>

  <p>The babu put on full speed, naturally, and tried to escape down a side-
  street, of which there are as many, and as narrow ones in Delhi as in any
  city of its size. He ran over a Bengali (which nobody except the Bengali
  minded very much), knocked down two Sikhs* (which was important, because they
  were on their way to a religious ceremony; righteous indignation is very bad
  stuff when spilled in the street), and finally jammed the Ford between a
  bullock-cart and a lamp-post, where the pride of Detroit collapsed into
  scrap.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Sikh</i> (Hindi)&mdash;an adherent of Sikhism, a
  monotheistic religion founded in northern India in the 16th century and
  combining elements of Hinduism and Islam. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/29/S0402900.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>. For more information, see the <i>Wiki</i>pedia article
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism">Sikhism</a>. ]</p>

  <p>The owner of the bullock-cart, a Jat* with a wart on his nose, which his
  mother-in-law had always insisted would bring bad luck (she said so at the
  trial later on, and brought three witnesses to prove it), was carrying, for
  an extortionate price, a native of a far-northern state, who had recently
  arrived by train without a ticket, and who knew how to be prompt and violent.
  The man from Spiti (which is the name of the northern state) descended from
  his perch at the rear of the cart, picked up a spoke that the collision had
  broken away, and hit the babu with it exactly once between the eyes. The babu
  died neatly without saying anything; and a hot crowd of nine nationalities,
  that was glad to see anybody die with politics the way they had been for a
  year or two, applauded.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Jat, Jatt</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a member of a large
  ethnic group who live in the states of Punjab, Western Uttar Pradesh,
  Haryana, Delhi and Rajasthan in India. The Jats are predominantly farmers and
  landowners, and Jats occupy many prominent positions in the fields of
  government, military, academia, and technology. <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jat">Wikpedia</a></i>.]</p>

  <p>The man from Spiti vanished. The "constabeel" arrested the owner of the
  bullock-cart, who turned his face skyward and screamed "Ayee-ee-ee!" once,
  which was duly noted in a memorandum book for use as evidence against him.
  Seventeen onlookers, being questioned, all gave false names and addresses,
  but swore that the Jat with the wart had attacked the babu; and a wakil
  (which is a person entitled to practice law), who knew all about the Jat's
  recent inheritance from his uncle, offered legal services that were accepted
  on the spot. Presently, in the jail, a jemadar* and two "constabeels" put the
  Jat through a hideously painful third degree, which left no marks on him but
  did induce him to part with money, most of which was spent on a debauch that
  ended in the jemadar being reduced to the ranks since the wakil objected on
  principle to sharing the loot of the Jat with any one and therefore
  righteously exposed the jemadar's abominable drunkenness.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>jemadar</i> (Hindi)&mdash;an Indian army rank
  corresponding to lieutenant. For more information see the <i>Wikipedia</i>
  article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemadar">Jemadar</a>. ]</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the native papers took the matter up and proved to nine points
  of decimals that the incident was wholly due to British arrogance and the
  neglect of public duty by an "overpaid alien hegemony," demonstrating among
  other things that the British are a race "whose crass materialism is an
  insult to the spiritual soul of India, and whose playing fields of Eton are
  an ash-bed from which arise swarms of Phoenixes to suck the life-blood of
  conquered peoples." (Excellent journalese conceived on the historic principle
  that if you make sufficient smell you are sure to annoy somebody, and he who
  is annoyed will make mistakes, which you may then gleefully expose.)</p>

  <p>The Sikhs who had been knocked down by the Ford accused the "obsequious
  servants of alien tyranny"&mdash;meaning the police&mdash;of having tried to
  prevent them from attending their religious ceremony; the fact being that the
  police had taken them to the hospital in an ambulance. The entire Sikh
  community in consequence refused to pay taxes, which set up another sequence
  of cause and effect, culminating in a yell of "Bande Materam!"* as three or
  four thousand second-year students, who were not Sikhs, rushed foaming at the
  mouth into the Chandni Chowk&dagger; (which is a business thoroughfare) with
  the intention of looting the silversmiths and putting the whole city to the
  torch. A fire-engine dispersed them; but the stream of water from the hose
  ruined the contents of Chanda Pal's drug-store.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Bande Materam</i> (Hindi)&mdash;Hail the
  Motherland! ]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[&dagger; <i>Chandni Chowk</i> (Silver Street) &mdash;
  one of the oldest and busiest markets in central north Delhi, India. The area
  is of historical importance to Delhi owing to its location between the Laal
  Quila (The Red Fort) and Fateh Puri Masjid... <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandni_Chowk">Wikipedia</a></i>. For more
  information, see the <a href="http://www.chandnichowk.com/">Chandni Chowk
  website</a>. ]</p>

  <p>Chanda Pal called in an actuary who possessed a compound geometrical
  imagination, and sent in a bill to the government that is still unpaid; and,
  having failed to collect immediately, he wrote to a friend who was an
  undergraduate at Oxford, with the result that a Member of Parliament for one
  of the Welsh constituencies asked at Question Time whether it was true that
  the Viceroy of India in person had high-handedly confiscated without
  compensation all the drugs in the Punjab;* and if so, why!</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Punjab</i>&mdash;a historical region of the
  northwest Indian subcontinent bounded by the Indus and Yamuna rivers...
  Muslims occupied the western part of the region by the 8th century,
  introducing Islam, and although they later conquered the eastern part,
  Hinduism remained entrenched there. The Moguls brought the region to cultural
  eminence until their empire declined in the 18th century. The Punjab was
  controlled by Sikhs from 1799 to 1849, when it was annexed by Great Britain.
  It was partitioned between India and Pakistan in 1947. <a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/21/P0662100.html"><i>The American Heritage
  Dictionary</i></a>. ]</p>

  <p>The answer from the Treasury Bench was "No, sir;" but the foreign
  correspondents omitted to mention that, so the French, Scandinavian and
  United States newspapers had it in headlines that "British in India
  inaugurate new reign of terror. Goods confiscated. Revolution threatened." A
  bishop in South Africa preached a sermon on the subject; thirty-seven members
  of the I.W.W., who were serving a term in San Quentin, went on a sympathetic
  hunger strike and were locked up in the dungeon; and a Congressman from
  somewhere in the Middle West wrote a speech that filled five pages of the
  Record. Stocks fell several points. Jenkins stepped into Willoughby's
  official shoes.</p>

  <p>However, clocks continued ticking. Roosters crowed. The sun appeared on
  schedule time. And Willoughby's funeral was marked by dignified
  simplicity.</p>

  <p>Except that he hugely regretted his friend Willoughby, Cottswold Ommony
  cared for none of these things. He sat near the electric fan in a corner of
  the club smoking room, aware that he was being discussed, but also quite sure
  that he did not mind it. He had been discussed, on and off, ever since he
  came to India. He looked quite unlike Hypatia, whatever Willoughby may have
  thought of his character.</p>

  <p>"Willoughby overrated him," said somebody. "You can't tell me Ommony or
  any other man is such a mixture of marvels as Willoughby made out. Besides,
  he's a bachelor. Socrates wasn't."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ommony's human. But&mdash;well&mdash;you know what he's done in that
  forest. It was raw, red wilderness when he was sent there. Now you can stand
  on a rock and see ninety miles of trees whichever way you care to look.
  Besides, dogs love him. Did you see that great dog of his outside? You can't
  fool that kind of dog, you know. They say he knows the tigers personally, and
  can talk the jungle-bat; there was only one other man who ever learned that
  language, and he committed suicide!"</p>

  <p>"All the same&mdash;he's not the only man who's done good work&mdash; and
  I've heard stories. Do any of you remember Terry&mdash;Jack Terry, the M.D.,
  who married Ommony's young sister? One of those delightful madmen who are
  really so sane that the rest of us can't understand 'em. Had weird theories
  about obstetrics. Nearly got foul of his profession by preaching that music
  was an absolute necessity at child-birth. Wanted the government to train
  symphony orchestras to play the overture to Leonora while the birth takes
  place. Perfectly mad; but a corking good surgeon. Always dead broke, from
  handing out his pay to beggars&mdash;broke, that is, until he met Marmaduke.
  Remember Marmaduke?"</p>

  <p>"Dead too, isn't he? Wasn't he the American who endowed a mission
  somewhere in the Hills?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, at Tilgaun. Marmaduke was another&mdash;ab-so-lutely mad&mdash; and
  as gentle as sunrise. Quiet man, who swore like a trooper at the mention of
  religion. Made his money in Chicago, slaughtering hogs&mdash;or so I heard.
  Wrote a book on astrology, that only ran to one edition. I sold my copy for
  ten times what I paid for it. I tell you, Marmaduke was madder than Gandhi.
  They say he left America to keep the elders of the church he belonged to from
  having him locked up in an asylum. The mission he founded at Tilgaun caused
  no end of a stir at the time. Surely you remember that? There were letters to
  the Times, and an archbishop raised a shindy in the House of Lords.
  Marmaduke's theory was that, as he couldn't understand Christianity, it was
  safe to premise that people whose religion was a mixture of degraded Buddhism
  and devil-worship couldn't understand it either. So he founded a Buddhist
  mission, to teach 'em their own religion. No, he wasn't a Buddhist. I don't
  know what his religion was. I only know he was a decent fellow, fabulously
  rich, and ab-so-lutely mad. He persuaded Jack Terry to chuck the service and
  become the mission medico&mdash;teach hygiene to men from Spiti and
  Bhutan&mdash;like teaching drought to the Atlantic! Jack Terry married
  Ommony's sister about a week before leaving for Tilgaun, and none of us ever
  saw them alive again."</p>

  <p>"Now I remember. There was a nine days' scandal, or a mystery, or
  something."</p>

  <p>"You bet there was! Terry and his wife vanished. Marmaduke was carpeted,
  but couldn't or wouldn't explain, and he died before they could make things
  hot for him. Then they gave Ommony long leave and sent him up to Tilgaun to
  investigate&mdash;that was&mdash;by gad! that was twenty years ago
  &mdash;Good lord! how time flies. Ommony discovered nothing; or, if he did
  discover anything, he said nothing&mdash;he's a great hand at doing that, by
  all accounts. But it leaked out that Marmaduke had appointed Ommony a trustee
  under his will. There was another trustee&mdash;a red-headed American
  woman&mdash;at least I heard she's red-headed; maybe, she isn't &mdash;named
  Hannah Sanburn, who has been running the mission ever since. She was not much
  more than a girl at the time, I remember. And the third trustee was a
  Tibetan. Nobody had ever heard of him, and I've never met a man who saw him;
  but I'm told he's a Ringding Gelong Lama;* and I've also heard that Ommony
  has never seen him. The whole thing's a mystery."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Ringding Gelong Lama</i> (Tibetan)&mdash;a fully-
  ordained Tibetan Buddhist monk of middle rank. See the website <i><a href=

  definition (see below), "a Ringding Gelong Lama does not rank as high in the
  Lamaistic scale as a cardinal does in the Roman Catholic Church." ]</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem particularly discreditable to Ommony. What are you
  hinting at?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Only Ommony has influence. You've noticed, I dare say, he always
  gets what he goes after. If you asked me, there's an even chance he may 'get'
  Jenkins, if he cares to."</p>

  <p>"That's notorious. Whoever goes after Ommony's scalp gets left at the
  post. What's the secret?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Nobody seems to. There's Marmaduke's money, of course.
  Ommony handles some of it. I don't suggest fraud, or any rot like that; but
  money's strange stuff; control of it gives a man power. Ommony's influence is
  out of all proportion to his job. And I've heard&mdash;mind you, I don't know
  how true it is&mdash;that he's hand-and-glove with every political fugitive
  from the North who has sneaked down South to let the clouds roll by during
  the last twenty years. They even said Ommony was on the inside of the Moplah
  business.* You know the Moplahs didn't burn his bungalow, they say he simply
  asked them not to&mdash;can you beat that&mdash;and it's a fact that he
  stayed in his forest all through that rebellion."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Moplah Rebellion</i>&mdash;a British-Muslim and
  Hindu-Muslim conflict in Kerala, SW India, that happened in 1921. The reasons
  for the conflict were rooted in increased religious awareness among the
  Muslim Moplahs (also known as Mappilas), disaffection with British
  governance, and resentment at the land-owning Nair community. On Aug 20, 1921
  the first incident of the rebellion occurred at Tirurangadi when the District
  Magistrate of Calicut with the help of troops attempted to arrest a few
  Moplah leaders who were in the possession of arms, resulting in clashes.
  Arsonists took to the street, burning and destroying government property. The
  initial focus was on the British, but when the limited presence of the
  British was eliminated, the Moplahs turned their attention to the land owning
  Nairs and other Hindus... Massacres, forced conversions, desecration of
  temples and rape were perpetrated by a section of the Moplahs... <i><a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moplah_rebellion">Wikipedia</a></i>.]</p>

  <p>Ommony was restless over in his corner. His obstinate jaw was only half-
  concealed by a close-clipped, graying beard, and there was grim humor on his
  lips. Having done more than any living man to pull the sting out of the
  Moplah rebellion, hints to the contrary hardly amused him. He was angry
  &mdash;obviously angry. However, one man claimed casual acquaintance and
  dropped into the next chair.</p>

  <p>"Expecting to stay long in Delhi?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I hope not."</p>

  <p>"Care to sell me that wolf-hound?"</p>

  <p>Ommony's reserve broke down; he had to talk to somebody:</p>

  <p>"That dog? Sell her? She's the sum total of twenty-years' effort. She's
  all I've done."</p>

  <p>The inquisitor leaned back, partly to hide his own face, partly to see
  Ommony's in a more distinct light; he suspected sunstroke, or the
  after-effects of malaria. But Ommony, having emerged from his reserve,
  continued:</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose I'm different from anybody else&mdash;at least not from
  any other reasonably decent fellow&mdash;made a lot of mistakes, of course
  &mdash;done a lot of things I wish I hadn't&mdash;been a bally ass on
  suitable occasion but I've worked&mdash;damned hard. India has had all the
  best of me and&mdash;damn her!&mdash;I haven't grudged it. Don't regret it,
  either. I'd do it again. But there's nothing to show for it all&mdash; "</p>

  <p>"Except a forest. They tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A forest, half-grown, that corrupt politicians will play ducks and drakes
  with; a couple of thousand villagers who are now being taught by those same
  politicians that everything they've learned from me is no good; a ruined
  constitution&mdash;and that dog. That's all I can show for twenty years'
  work&mdash;and like some others, I've had my heart in it. I think I know how
  a missionary feels when his flock walks out on him. I'm a failure&mdash;
  we're all failures. The world is going to pieces under our hands. What I have
  taught that dog is all I can really claim by way of accomplishment."</p>

  <p>That particular inquisitor lost enthusiasm. He did not like madmen. He
  withdrew and considered Ommony in a corner, behind a newspaper, sotto voce.
  Another not so casual acquaintance dropped into the vacant chair, and was
  greeted with a nod.</p>

  <p>"You've been absent so long you ought to see things with a fresh eye,
  Ommony. D'you think India's breaking up?"</p>

  <p>"I've thought so for twenty years."</p>

  <p>"How long before we have to clear out?"</p>

  <p>"The sooner the better."</p>

  <p>"For us?"</p>

  <p>"I mean for India!"</p>

  <p>"I should have thought you would be the last man to say that. You've done
  your bit. They tell me you've changed a desert into a splendid forest. D'you
  want to see it all cut down, the lumber wasted and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ommony pulled out his watch and tapped his finger on the dial.</p>

  <p>"I had it cleaned and repaired recently," he remarked. The man charged me
  a fair price, but after I had paid the bill he didn't have the impudence to
  keep the watch for fear I might ruin it again. India has a perfect right to
  go to hell her own way. Surgery and hygiene are good, but I don't believe in
  being governed by the medical profession. Cleaning up corrupted countries is
  good; but to stay on after we've been asked to quit is bad manners. And
  they're worse than breaking all ten commandments. Besides, we don't know much
  &mdash;or we'd have done much better."</p>

  <p>"You think India is ripe for self-government?"</p>

  <p>"When things are ripe, they fall or decay on the tree," said Ommony.
  "There's a time to stand aside and let 'em grow. There's such a thing as too
  much nursing."</p>

  <p>"Then you're willing to chuck your forest job?"</p>

  <p>"I have chucked it."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Resigned? Going to draw your pension?"</p>

  <p>"No. Pension wouldn't be due for two years yet, and I don't need it. India
  has had the use of me for twenty-three years at a fair price. I'd be
  satisfied, if she was. But she isn't. And I'm proud, so I'll be damned if
  I'll accept a pension."</p>

  <p>Ommony was left alone again. That news of his resignation was too good to
  be kept, even for a minute. Within five minutes it was all over the club, and
  men were speculating as to the real reason, since nobody ever gives anyone
  credit (and wisely, perhaps) for the motives that he makes public.</p>

  <p>"Jenkins has succeeded Willoughby. Ommony knows jolly well that Jenkins
  has it in for him. He's pulling out ahead of the landslide&mdash;that's
  what."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it. Ommony has guts and influence enough to bust ten
  Jenkinses. There's more than that in it. There never was a man like Ommony
  for keeping secrets up his sleeve. You know he's in the Secret Service?"</p>

  <p>"That's easy to say, but who said so?"</p>

  <p>"Believe it or not&mdash;I'll bet. I'll bet he stays in India. I'll bet he
  dies in harness. I'll bet any money in reason he goes straight from here to
  McGregor's office. More than that&mdash;I'll bet McGregor sent for him, and
  that he didn't resign from the Forestry without talking it over with McGregor
  first. He's deep, is Cottswold Ommony&mdash;deep. He's no man's fool. There's
  no man alive but McGregor who knows what Ommony will do next. Anybody want to
  bet about it?"</p>

  <p>The remainder of the conversation at the club that noon rippled off into
  widening rings of reminiscence, all set up by Ommony's arrival on the scene,
  and mostly interesting, but to stay and listen would have been to be
  sidetracked, which is the inevitable fate of gossips. There was a story in
  the wind that, if the club had known it, would have set all Delhi by the
  ears.</p>

  <p class="first">OMMONY did go straight to McGregor but he and Diana, his
  enormous wolf-hound, walked and club bets had to be called off because there
  was no cab-driver from whom the chuprassy* could bludgeon information.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>chuprassy</i> (Hindi)&mdash; a uniformed
  doorkeeper; also a messenger or servant wearing an official badge. Various
  sources. For more information, see the article <a href=
  "http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-
bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:549.hobson">Chuprassy</a>
  in <i>The Hobson Jobson Dictionary</i>. ]</p>

  <p>Neither his nor Diana's temper was improved by the behavior of the crowd.
  The dog's size and apparent ferocity cleared a course, but that convenience
  was not so pleasant as the manners of twenty years ago, when men made way for
  an Englishman without hesitation&mdash;without dreaming of doing anything
  else.</p>

  <p>The thrice-breathed air of Delhi gave him melancholia. It was not
  agreeable to see men spit with calculated insolence. The heat made the sweat
  drip from his beard on to the bosom of a new silk shirt. The smell of over-
  civilized, unnaturally clothed humans was nauseating. By the time he reached
  an unimaginably ugly, rawly new administration building he felt about as
  sweetly reasonable as a dog with hydrophobia, and was tired, with feet
  accustomed to the softness, and ears used to the silence, of long jungle
  lanes.</p>

  <p>However, his spirits rose as he approached the steps. He may have made a
  signal, because the moment the chuprassy saw him he straightened himself
  suddenly and ran before him, upstairs and along a corridor. By the time
  Ommony reached a door with no name on it, at the far end of the building, the
  chuprassy was waiting to open it&mdash;had already done the announcing
  &mdash;had already seen a said-to-be important personage shown out with scant
  excuses through another door. The chuprassy's salaam was that of a worshiper
  of secrets, to a man who knows secrets and can keep them; there is no more
  marrow-deep obeisance in the world than that.</p>

  <p>And now no ceremony. The office door clicked softy with a spring-lock and
  shut out the world that bows and scrapes to hide its enmity and spits to
  disguise self-conscious meanness. A man sat at a desk and grinned.</p>

  <p>"Sit. Smoke. Take your coat off. Sun in your eyes? Try the other chair.
  Dog need water? Give her some out of the filter. Now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>John McGregor passed cigars and turned his back toward a laden desk. He
  was a middle-sized, middle-aged man with snow-white hair in a crisp mass,
  that would have been curly if he had let it grow long enough. His white
  mustache made him look older than his years, but his skin was young and
  reddish, although that again was offset by crow's-feet at the corners of
  noticeably dark-gray eyes. His hands looked like a conjurer's; he could do
  anything with them, even, to keeping them perfectly still.</p>

  <p>"So you've actually turned in your resignation? We grow!" he remarked,
  laughing. "Everything grows&mdash;except me; I'm in the same old rut. I'll
  get the ax&mdash;get pensioned someday&mdash;dreadful fate! Did you have your
  interview with Jenkins? What happened? I can see you had the best of it
  &mdash;but how?"</p>

  <p>Ommony laid three letters on the desk&mdash;purple ink on faded paper, in
  a woman's handwriting. McGregor laughed aloud&mdash;one bark, like the cry of
  a fox that scents its quarry on the fluke of a changing wind.</p>

  <p>"Perfect!" he remarked, picking up the letters and beginning to read the
  top one. "Did you blackmail him?"</p>

  <p>"I did."</p>

  <p>"I could have saved you that trouble, you know. I could have 'broke' him.
  He deserves it," said McGregor, knitting his brows over the letter in his
  hand. "Man, man, he certainly deserves it!"</p>

  <p>"If we all got our deserts the world 'ud stand still." Ommony chose a
  cigar and bit the end off. "He's a more than half-efficient bureaucrat. Let
  India suck him dry and spew him forth presently to end his days at Surbiton
  or Cheltenham."</p>

  <p>McGregor went on reading, holding his breath. "Have you read these?" he
  asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>Ommony nodded. McGregor chewed at his mustache and made noises with his
  teeth that brought Diana's ears up, cocked alertly.</p>

  <p>"Man, they're pitiful! Imagine a brute like Jenkins having such a hold on
  anyone&mdash;and he&mdash;good God! He ought to have been hanged&mdash; no,
  that's too good for him! I suppose there's no human law that covers such a
  case."</p>

  <p>"None," Ommony answered grimly. "But I'm pious. I think there's a Higher
  Law that adjusts that sort of thing eventually. If not, I'd have killed the
  brute myself."</p>

  <p>"Listen to this."</p>

  <p>"Don't read 'em aloud, Mac. It's sacrilege. And I'm raw. It was at least
  partly my fault."</p>

  <p>"Don't be an idiot!"</p>

  <p>"It was, Mac. Elsa wasn't so many years younger than me, but even when we
  were kids we were more like father and child than brother and sister. She had
  the spirituality and the brains; I had the brute-strength and was presumed to
  have the common sense; it made a rather happy combination. As soon as I got
  settled in the forest I wrote home to her to come out and keep house for me.
  I used to trust Jenkins in those days. It was I who introduced them, Jenkins
  introduced her to Kananda Pal."</p>

  <p>"That swine!"</p>

  <p>"No, he wasn't such a swine as Jenkins," said Ommony. "Kananda Pal was a
  poor devil who was born into a black art family. He didn't know any better.
  His father used to make him stare into ink-pools and all that devilment
  before he was knee-high to a duck. He used to do stunts with spooks and
  things. Jenkins, on the other hand, had a decent heritage and ditched it. It
  was he who invited Kananda Pal to hypnotize Elsa. Between the two of them
  they did a devil's job of at. She almost lost her mind, and Jenkins had the
  filthy gall to use that as excuse for breaking the engagement."</p>

  <p>"My God! But think if he had married her! Man, man!"</p>

  <p>"True. But think of the indecency of making that excuse! I called in Fred
  Terry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Top-hole&mdash;generous&mdash;gallant&mdash;gay! Man, what a delightful
  fellow Terry was!" said McGregor. "Did he really fall in love with
  her?&mdash;You know, he was recklessly generous enough to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ommony. "He almost cured her; and he fell in love. She loved
  him&mdash;don't see how any real woman could have helped it. But Jenkins and
  Kananda Pal&mdash;oh, curse them both!"</p>

  <p>"Amen!" remarked McGregor. "Well&mdash;we've got what we want. How did you
  hear of these letters?&mdash;Just think of it! That poor girl writing to a
  brute like Jenkins&mdash;to give her mind back to her. So that she may
  &mdash;oh, my God!"</p>

  <p>"I saw Kananda Pal before he died. That was recently. He was quite sorry
  about his share in the business. He tried to put all the blame on Jenkins
  &mdash;you know how rotters always accuse each other when the cat's out of
  the bag. He told me of the letters, so I went to Jenkins yesterday and,
  having resigned, I was in position to be rather blunt. In fact, I was dam'
  blunt. He denied their existence at first, but he handed 'em over when I
  explained what I intended to do if he didn't!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder why he'd kept them," said McGregor.</p>

  <p>"The pig had kept them to prove she was mad, if anyone should ever accuse
  him of having wronged her," Ommony answered. "Do they read like a mad-
  woman's letters?"</p>

  <p>"Man, man! They're pitiful! They read like the letters of a drug-addict,
  struggling to throw off the cursed stuff, and all the while crying for it.
  Lord save us, what a time Fred Terry must have had!"</p>

  <p>"Increasingly rarely," said Ommony. "He had almost cured her. The attacks
  were intermittent. Terry heard of a sacred place in the hills&mdash;a sort of
  Himalayan Lourdes, I take it&mdash;and they set off together, twenty years
  ago, to find the place. I never found a trace of them, but I heard rumors,
  and I've always believed they disappeared into the Ahbor country."</p>

  <p>"Where they probably were crucified!" McGregor added grimly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Ommony. "I've heard tales about a mysterious stone in
  the Ahbor country that's supposed to have magic qualities. Terry probably
  heard about it too, and he was just the man to go in search of it. I've also
  heard it said that the 'Masters' live in the Ahbor Valley."</p>

  <p>McGregor shook his head and smiled. "Still harping on that string?"</p>

  <p>"One hundred million people, at a very conservative estimate, of whom at
  least a million are thinkers, believe that the Masters exist," Ommony
  retorted. "Who are you and I, to say they don't? If they do, and if they're
  in the Ahbor Valley, I propose to prove it."</p>

  <p>McGregor's smile widened to a grin. "Men who are as wise as they are said
  to be, would know how to keep out of sight. The Mahatmas,* or Masters, as you
  call them, are a mare's nest, Ommony, old man. However, there may be
  something in the other rumor. By the way: who's this adopted daughter of Miss
  Sanburn?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Mahatma</i> (Hindi/Sanskrit)&mdash;in India and

  <p>"You're trustee of the Marmaduke Mission, aren't you? Know Miss Sanburn

  <p>"A year ago. She comes to Delhi once a year to meet me on the mission

  <p>"And you never heard of an adopted daughter? Then listen to this."</p>

  <p>McGregor opened a file and produced a letter written in English on cheap
  ruled paper.</p>

  <p>"This is from Number 888&mdash;Sirdar* Sirohe Singh of Tilgaun, who has
  been on the secret roster since before my time. His home is somewhere near

  "Miss Sanburn of mission near here did procure fragment of crystal jade by
  unknown means, same having been broken from antiquity of unknown whereabouts
  and being reputed to possess mysterious qualities. Miss Sanburn's adopted
  daughter&mdash;" get that? "&mdash; intending to return same, was prevented

  <p>"What do you make of it?" asked McGregor.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Never heard of an adopted daughter."</p>

  <p>"Then what do you make of this?"</p>

  <p>McGregor's left hand went into a desk-drawer, and something the color of
  deep sea-water over a sandy bottom flashed in the sunlight as Ommony caught
  it. He held it to the light. It was stone, not more than two inches thick at
  the thickest part, and rather larger than the palm of his hand. It was so
  transparent he could see his fingers through it; yet it was almost fabulously
  green. One side was curved, and polished so perfectly that it felt like wet
  soap to the touch; the other side was nearly a plane surface, only slightly
  uneven, as if it had been split off from another piece.</p>

  <p>"It looks like jade," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"It is. But did you ever see jade like it? Hold it to the light
  again."</p>

  <p>There was not a flaw. The sun shone through it as through glass, except
  that when the stone was moved there was a vague obscurity, as if the plane
  where the breakage had occurred in some way distorted the light.</p>

  <p>"Keep on looking at it," said McGregor, watching.</p>

  <p>"No, thanks." Ommony laid the stone on his knee and deliberately glanced
  around the room from one object to another. "I rebel against that stuff
  instinctively."</p>

  <p>"You recognize the symptoms?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. There's a polished black-granite sphere in the crypt of a ruined
  temple, near Darjeeling, that produces the same sort of effect when you stare
  at it. I'm told the Kaaba at Mecca does the same, but that's hearsay."</p>

  <p>"Put the stone in your pocket," said McGregor. "Keep it there a day or
  two. It's the fragment that's missing from Tilgaun, and you'll discover it
  has peculiar properties. Talk with Chutter Chand about it, he can tell you
  something interesting. He tried to explain to me, but it's over my head
  &mdash;Secret Service kills imagination&mdash;I live in a mess of statistics
  and card-indexes that 'ud mummify a Sybil. All the same, I suspect that piece
  of jade will help you to trace the Terrys; and, if you dare to take a crack
  at the Ahbor country&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How did you come by the stone?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"I sent C99&mdash;that's Tin Lal&mdash;to Tilgaun to look into rumors of
  trouble up there. Tin Lal used to be a good man, although he was always a
  thorough-paced rascal. But the Service isn't what it used to be, Ommony; even
  our best men are taking sides nowadays, or playing for their own hand.
  India's going to the dogs. Tin Lal came back and reported everything quiet at
  Tilgaun&mdash;said the murders were mere family feuds. But he took that piece
  of jade to Chutter Chand, the jeweler, and offered it for sale. Told a
  lame-duck story. Chutter Chand put him off&mdash;kept the stone for
  appraisal&mdash;and brought it to me. I provided Tin Lal&mdash;naturally
  &mdash;with a year behind the bars&mdash;no, not on account of the stone. He
  had committed plenty of crimes to choose from. I chose a little one just to
  discipline him. But here's the interesting part: either Tin Lal talked in the
  jail&mdash;or someone followed him from Tilgaun. Anyway, someone traced that
  piece of jade to this office. I have had an anonymous letter about it; worth
  attention&mdash;interesting. You'll notice it's signed with a
  glyph&mdash;I've never seen a glyph quite like it&mdash;and the handwriting
  is an educated woman's. Read it for yourself."</p>

  <p>He passed to Ommony an exquisitely fashioned silver tube with a cap at
  either end. Ommony shook out a long sheet of very good English writing-paper;
  It was ivory-colored, heavy, and scented with some kind of incense. There was
  no date&mdash;no address&mdash;no signature, except a peculiar glyph, rather
  like an ancient, much simplified Chinese character. The writing was condensed
  into the middle of the page, leaving very wide margins, and had been done
  with a fine steel pen.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"The stone that was brought from Tilgaun by Tin Lal and was
  offered for sale by him to Chutter Chand is one that no honorable man would
  care to keep from its real owners. There is merit in a good deed and the
  reward of him who does justly without thought of reward is tenfold. There are
  secrets not safe to be pried into. There is light too bright to look into.
  There is truth more true than can be told. If you will change the color of
  the sash on the chuprassy at the front door, one shall present himself to you
  to whom you may return the stone with absolute assurance that it will reach
  its real owners. Honesty and happiness are one. The truth comes not to him
  who is inquisitive, but to him who does what is right and leaves the result
  to Destiny."</p><br>

  <p>Ommony examined the writing minutely, sniffed the paper, held it to the
  light, then picked up the tube and examined that.</p>

  <p>"Who brought it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It was handed to the chuprassy by a native he says he
  thinks was disguised."</p>

  <p>"Did you try changing the chuprassy's sash?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally. A deaf and dumb man came. He looked like a Tibetan. He
  approached the chuprassy and touched his sash, so the chuprassy brought him
  up to me. He was unquestionably deaf and dumb&mdash;stone-deaf, and half of
  his tongue was missing. The drums of his ears had been bored through&mdash;
  when he was a baby probably. I showed him the stone and he tried to take it
  from me. I had to have him forcibly ejected from the office; and of course I
  had him followed, but he disappeared utterly, after wandering aimlessly all
  over Delhi until nearly midnight. I have had a look-out kept, but he seems to
  have vanished without trace."</p>

  <p>"Have you drawn any conclusions?"</p>

  <p>McGregor smiled. "I never draw them before it's safe to say they're
  proved. But a young woman almost certainly wrote that letter; Miss Sanburn's
  adopted daughter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who I don't believe exists," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;is reported by 888, who has hitherto always been reliable, to have
  disappeared. She disappeared, if she ever did exist, from Tilgaun; the stone
  unquestionably came from Tilgaun, and it seems to have been in Miss Sanburn's
  possession, in the mission. Ergo&mdash;just as a flying
  hypothesis,&mdash;Miss Sanburn's adopted daughter may have written that
  letter. If so, she's in Delhi, because the ink on that paper had not been dry
  more than an hour or two when it reached me."</p>

  <p>"Have you searched the hotels?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. And the trains are being watched."</p>

  <p>"I'm curious to meet Hannah Sanburn's adopted daughter!" said Ommony
  dryly. "I've known Hannah ever since she came to India more than twenty years
  ago. I've been co-trustee ever since Marmaduke died, and I don't believe
  Hannah Sanburn has kept a single secret from me. In fact, it has been the
  other way; she has passed most of her difficult personal problems along to me
  for solution. I've a dozen files full of her letters, of which I dare say
  five percent are purely personal. I think I know all her private business. As
  recently as last year, when we met here in Delhi,&mdash;well&mdash;never
  mind; but if she had an adopted daughter, or an entanglement of any kind, I
  think I'd know it."</p>

  <p>"Women are damned deep," McGregor answered. "Well; we've not much to go
  on. I'll entrust that stone to you; if you're still willing to try to get
  into the Ahbor country, I'll do everything I can to assist. You've a fair
  excuse for trying; and you're a bachelor. Dammit, if I were, I'd go with you!
  Of course, you understand, if the State Department learns of it you'll be
  rounded up and brought back. Do you realize the other difficulties? Sven
  Hedin* is said to have made the last attempt to get through from the North.
  He failed.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Sven Anders Hedin</i> (1865-1952)&mdash;a Swedish
  explorer, geographer and geopolitician. Between 1886 and 1892 he studied
  geology, mineralogy, zoology, and Latin in Stockholm, Uppsala, Berlin, and
  Halle. Between his graduation in 1892 and 1935 he led several expeditions to
  Central Asia... He became a member of the Swedish Academy in 1913. His
  achievements include the production of the first detailed maps of vast parts
  of Pamir, Taklamakan, Tibet, the ancient Silk Road, and the Himalayas...
  Although primarily an explorer, Hedin was also the first westerner to unearth
  the ruins of ancient Buddhist cities in Chinese Central Asia. In 1899 he
  discovered the ancient Chinese garrison town of Loulan in the Taklamakan
  desert. The many manuscripts he unearthed there proved to be of great
  historical importance. In his later expeditions he mapped large parts of the
  Tibetan highlands but never reached his ultimate goal: the then forbidden
  city of Lhasa... Excerpted from <i><a href=

  <p>In the last hundred years about a dozen Europeans have had a crack at it.
  Several died, and one got through&mdash;unless Terry and your sister did, and
  if so, they almost certainly died. When Younghusband* went to Lhasa he
  considered sending one regiment back by way of the Ahbor Valley but
  countermanded the order when he realized that a force of fifty thousand men
  wouldn't stand a chance of getting through.</p>

  journeyed from China to India, crossing the Gobi desert and the Mustagh Pass
  (ca. 5,791 m) of the Karakorum Range. Lord Curzon, the British viceroy in
  India, sent Younghusband with a military expedition into Tibet in 1904, where
  he forced a treaty upon the Dalai Lama, opening Tibet to Western trade. Later
  he surveyed the Brahmaputra and Sutlej rivers and the upper reaches of the
  Indus. He three times tried and failed to scale Mt. Everest... <i><a href=

  <p>From time to time the government has sent six Gurkha spies into the
  country. None ever came back. It's almost a certainty that the River Tsangpo
  of Tibet flows through the valley and becomes the Brahmaputra lower down, but
  nobody has proved it; nor has anyone explained why the Tsangpo contains more
  water than the Brahmaputra. Old Kinthup&dagger;, the pundit* on the Indian
  Survey Staff, traced the Tsangpo down as far as the waterfall where it
  plunges into the Ahbor Valley, and he threw a hundred marked logs into the
  river, which were watched for lower down; but none of the logs appeared at
  the lower end, and not even Kinthup managed to get into the valley.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>pundit, pandit</i> (Hindi)&mdash;In this context
  <i>pundit</i> means "a native scout, explorer and surveyor." More usually (as
  elsewhere in this book), the term denotes a Hindu Brahmin who has memorized a
  substantial portion of the Vedas, along with the corresponding rhythms and
  melodies for chanting or singing them. Pandits are hired to chant Vedic
  verses at yagyas and other events, both public and private. The chanting is
  meant to be listened to with a quiet mind for the purpose of spiritual
  development for the listener as well as enlivening of the atmosphere at an
  event... In India today, pandit is a term of great respect given to Indian
  classical musicians (usually Hindu) acknowledged to be masters, such as
  Pandit Jasraj, Pandit Pran Nath, or Pandit Ravi Shankar... <a href=

  In the second half of the 19th century, the term "pundit" was also used to
  denote native surveyors who explored regions to the north of India for the
  British. For more information on this subject, see the <i>Wikipedia</i>

  <p class="footnote">[&dagger; <i>Kinthup</i>&mdash;a pundit (native scout,
  explorer and surveyor) from the Indian Himalayan state of Sikkim who, in the
  1880s, was commissioned by the British colonial authorities to explore and
  map parts of Tibet. Kinthup is famous for his attempt to determine if the
  Tibetan Tsangpo river, whose source is on Mount Kailash, was in fact the
  beginning of the Brahmaputra, which flows through India into the Bay of
  Bengal. Kinthup infiltrated Tibet, posing as the servant of a Chinese lama.
  As planned, he threw specially marked logs into the Tsangpo while other
  surveyors kept a look-out for them along the Brahmaputra. However his
  companion proved unreliable and sold him as a slave to a Tibetan lama. After
  seven months in slavery, Kinthup escaped and traveled east along the Tsangpo,
  ultimately finding refuge in a Buddhist monastery, the head lama of which
  bought him from his previous owner. A few months later Kinthup obtained
  permission to make a pilgrimage and used his leave of absence to cut and mark
  more logs. He did not throw them into the water at that time, however, for
  eighteen months had passed since he left India, and he realized that no one
  would be looking for the logs anymore. Some time later he requested
  permission to make another pilgrimage and traveled to Lhasa, where he gave a
  fellow-Sikkimese a letter for the British Indian Survey authorities,
  informing them that he intended to throw more marked logs into the Tsangpo.
  This he did on his next leave of absence from the monastery. He then made his
  way back to India, where he learned that his letter had never been delivered.
  The authorities refused to believe the story of his adventure, so Kinthup
  left the Survey and became a tailor. Only many years later did geographers
  finally determine that the Tsangpo and the Brahmaputra are in fact the same
  river. Paraphrased from <a href=

  <p>The strangest part about it is, that the Northern Ahbors come down
  frequently to the Southern Ahbor country to trade, and they even intermarry
  with the Southern Ahbors. But they never say a word about their valley. The
  rajah of Tilgaun&mdash;the uncle of the present man&mdash;caught two and put
  them to torture, but they died silent. And another strange thing is, that
  nobody knows how the Northern Ahbors get into and out of their country. The
  river is a lot too swift for boats. The forest seems impenetrable. The cliffs
  are unclimbable. There was an attempt made last year to explore by airplane,
  but the attempt failed; there's a ninety-mile wind half the time, and some of
  the passes to the south are sixteen or seventeen thousand feet in the air to
  begin with. I'm told carburetors won't work, and they can't carry enough
  fuel.&mdash;So, if you're determined to make the attempt, slip away secretly,
  and don't leave your courage behind! If it weren't that you've a right to
  visit Tilgaun I should say you'd have no chance, but you might make it, if
  you're awfully discreet and start from the Tilgaun Mission. If it's ever
  found out that I encouraged you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You've been reeling off discouragement for fifteen minutes!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but if it's known I knew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry. What made you say you think this stone will help me to
  trace the Terrys?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing definite, except that it gives me an excuse for sending you to
  Tilgaun more or less officially. I employ you to investigate the mystery
  connected with that stone. As far as Tilgaun you're responsible to me. If you
  decide to go on from there, you'll have to throw me over&mdash;disobey
  orders. You understand, I order you to come straight back here from Tilgaun.
  If you disobey, you do it off your own bat, without my official knowledge.
  And I'm afraid, old thing, you'll have to pay your own expenses."</p>

  <p>Ommony nodded.</p>

  <p>"See Chutter Chand," said McGregor, "and dine with me tonight&mdash;not at
  the club&mdash;that 'ud start all sorts of rumors flying&mdash;say at Mrs.

  invitation&mdash;how'll that do?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Cornock-Campbell is a better man than you or me. Nine o'clock. I'll

  bridled at it. "Still laughing about the 'Masters,' Mac?"</p>

  <p>"No, no. I'd forgotten them. Not that they exist&mdash;but never

  <p>Every square foot of the walls within is covered with ancient curios. A
  glass counter-show-case runs the full length of the store, and is stuffed
  with enough jewelry to furnish a pageant of Indian history; converted into
  cash it would finance a very fair-sized bank. Rising to the level of the
  counter at the rear is a long row of pigeonholed shelves crowded with ancient
  books and manuscripts that smell like recently unwound mummies. Between shelf
  and counter lives (and reputedly sleeps by night) the most efficient
  jeweler's babu in Indian&mdash;a meek, alert, weariless man who is said to be
  able to estimate anyone's bank balance by glancing at him as he enters
  through the front door. But Chutter Chand keeps himself out of sight, in a
  room at the rear of the store, whence he comes out only in emergency. On this
  particular occasion there were extra reasons for remaining in the background
  &mdash;reasons suggested by the presence of a special "constabeel" on duty
  outside the shop-door, who eyed Ommony nervously as he walked in.</p>

  <p>Ommony went straight to the room at the rear and found Chutter Chand at
  his desk&mdash;a wizened, neat little man in a yellow silk turban and a brown
  alpaca suit of English cut. The suit and his brown skin were almost of the
  same shade; an amber pin in his yellow necktie corresponded with the color of
  his laced shoes; the gold of his heavy watch-chain matched the turban; his
  lemon silk handkerchief matched his socks; his dark-brown, kindly,
  intelligent eyes struck the keynote of the color harmony.</p>

  <p>Unlike so many Indians who adopt a modified European style of dress, he
  had an air of breeding, poise and distinction.</p>

  <p>"There is always something interesting when you come, Ommonee!" he said,
  rising and shaking hands. "Wait while I remove the specimens from that chair.
  No, the snakes cannot escape; they are all poisonous, but carefully
  imprisoned. There&mdash;be seated. You are full of news, or you would have
  asked me how I am. Thank you, I am very well. And you? Now let us get to
  business!"</p>

  <p>Ommony grinned at the gibe, but he had his own way of going about things.
  He preferred to soak in his surroundings and adjust his mind to the
  environment in silence before broaching business. He lit a cigar, and stared
  about him at the snakes in cages and the odds and ends of rarities heaped
  everywhere in indescribable confusion. There were an enormous brass Gautama
  Buddha resting on iron rollers, a silver Christian crucifix from a Goanese
  cathedral, and some enamel vases, that were new since his last visit; but the
  same old cobwebs were still in place in the corners of the teak beams, and
  the same cat came and rubbed herself against his shins&mdash;until she spied
  Diana in the outer shop and grew instantly blasphemous.</p>

  <p>Still saying nothing, Ommony at last produced the lump of jade from his
  hip pocket.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Chutter Chand, "I have already seen it." But he took off his
  gold-rimmed spectacles and wiped them as if he was eager to see it again.</p>

  <p>"What do you know about it?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Very little, Sahib. To crystallize hypothesis into a mistake is all too
  easy. I prefer to distinguish between knowledge and conjecture."</p>

  <p>"All right. Tell me what little you do know."</p>

  <p>"It is jade undoubtedly, although I have never seen jade exactly like it
  &mdash;I, who have studied every known species of precious and semi-precious
  stone."</p>

  <p>"Then why do you say it is jade?"</p>

  <p>"Because I know that. I have analyzed it. It is chloromelanite, consisting
  of a silicate of aluminum and sodium, with peroxide of iron, peroxide of
  manganese, and potash. It has been broken from a greater piece&mdash; perhaps
  from an enormous piece. The example I have previously seen that most
  resembled this was found in the Kara-Kash Valley of Turkestan; but that was
  not nearly so transparent. That piece you hold in your hand is more fusible
  than nephrite, which is the commoner form of jade; and it has a specific
  gravity of 3.3."</p>

  <p>"What makes you believe it was broken from a larger piece?"</p>

  <p>"I know by the arc of the curve of the one side, and by the shape of the
  fracture on the other, that it has been broken by external violence from a
  piece considerably larger than itself. I have worked out a law of vibration
  and fracture that is as interesting in its way as Einstein's law of
  relativity. Do you understand mathematics?"</p>

  <p>"No. I'll take your word for it. What else do you know positively?"</p>

  <p>"Positively is the only way to know," the jeweler answered, screwing up
  his face until he looked almost like a Chinaman. "There was human blood on it
  &mdash;a smear on the fractured side, that looked as if a careless attempt
  had been made to wipe it off before the blood was quite dry. Also the print
  of a woman's thumb and forefinger, plainly visible under the microscope, with
  several other fingerprints that certainly were Tin Lal's. The stone had come
  in contact with some oily substance, probably butter, but there was too
  little of it to determine. Furthermore, I know, Ommonee, that you are afraid
  of the stone because to touch it makes you nervous, and to peer into it makes
  you see things you cannot explain."</p>

  <p>Ommony laughed. The stone did make him nervous.</p>

  <p>"Did you see things!" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That is how I know it makes you see them, Ommonee! Compared to me you are
  a child in such respects. If I, who know more than you, nonetheless see
  things when I peer into that stone, it is logical to my mind that you also
  see things, although possibly not the same things. Knowing the inherent
  superstition of the human mind, I therefore know you are afraid&mdash;just as
  people were afraid when Galileo told them that the earth moves."</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid of it?" asked Ommony, shifting his cigar and laying the
  stone on the desk.</p>

  <p>"What is fear?" the jeweler answered. "Is it not recognition of something
  the senses cannot understand and therefore cannot master? I think the fact
  that we feel a sort of fear is proof that we stand on the threshold of new
  knowledge&mdash;or rather, of knowledge that is new to us as
  individuals."</p>

  <p>"You mean, then, if a policeman's afraid of a burglar, he's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Certainly! He is in a position to learn something he never knew before.
  That doesn't mean that he will learn, but that he may if he cares to. People
  used to be afraid of a total eclipse of the sun; some still are afraid of it.
  Imagine, if you can, what Julius Caesar, or Alexander the Great, or Timour
  Ilang,* or Akbar&dagger; would have thought of radio, or a thirty-six-inch

  <p>"All those things can be explained. This stone is a mystery."</p>

  <p>"Ommonee, everything that we do not yet understand is a mystery. To a pig,
  it must be a mystery why a man flings turnips to him over the wall of his
  sty. To that dog of yours it must be a mystery why you took such care to
  train her. Look into the stone now, Sahib, and tell me what you see."</p>

  <p>"Not I," said Ommony. "I've done it twice. You look."</p>

  <p>Chutter Chand took up the stone in both hands and held it in the light
  from an overhead window. The thing glowed, as if full of liquid-green fire,
  yet from ten feet away Ommony could see through it the lines on the palm of
  the jeweler's hand.</p>

  <p>"Interesting! Interesting! Ommonee, the world is full of things we don't
  yet know!"</p>

  <p>Chutter Chand's brows contracted, the right side more than the left, in
  the habit-fixed expression of a man whose business is to use a microscope.
  Two or three times he glanced away and blinked before looking again. Finally
  he put the stone back on the desk and wiped his spectacles from force of
  habit.</p>

  <p>"Our senses," he said, "are much more reliable than the brain that
  interprets them. We probably all see, and hear, and smell alike, but no two
  brains interpret in the same way. Try to describe to me your sensations when
  you looked into the stone."</p>

  <p>"Almost a brain-storm," said Ommony. "A rush of thoughts that seemed to
  have no connection with one another. Something like modern politics or
  listening in on the radio when there's loads of interference, only more
  exasperating&mdash;more personal&mdash;more inside yourself, as it were."</p>

  <p>Chutter Chand nodded confirmation. "Can you describe the thoughts,
  Ommonee? Do they take the form of words?"</p>

  <p>"No. Pictures. But pictures of a sort I've never seen, even in dreams.
  Rather horrible. They appear to mean something, but the mind can't grasp
  them. They're broken off suddenly&mdash;begin nowhere and end nowhere."</p>

  <p>Chutter Chand nodded again. "Our experiences tally. You will notice that
  the stone is broken off; it also begins nowhere and ends nowhere. I have
  measured it carefully; from calculation of the curvature it is possible to
  surmise that it may have been broken off from an ellipsoid having a major or
  axis of seventeen feet. That would be an immense mass of jade weighing very
  many tons; and if the whole were as perfect as this fragment, it would be a
  marvel such as we in our day have not seen. I suspect it to have qualities
  more remarkable than those of radium, and I think&mdash;although, mind you,
  this is now conjecture&mdash;that if we could find the original ellipsoid
  from which this piece was broken we would possess the open sesame to&mdash;
  well&mdash;to laws and facts of nature, the mere contemplation of which would
  fill all the lunatic asylums! I have never been so thrilled by anything in
  all my life."</p>

  <p>But Ommony was not thrilled. He had seen men go mad from exploring without
  landmarks into the unknown. He laughed cynically.</p>

  <p>"'We fools of nature,'" he quoted, "'so horridly to shake our disposition
  with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls!' I'd rather wipe out the
  asylums."</p>

  <p>"Or live in one, Sahib, and leave the lunatics outside! Shakespeare knew
  nothing of the atomic construction of the universe. We have advanced since
  his day&mdash;in some respects. Has it occurred to you to wonder how this
  stone acquired such remarkable qualities? No! You merely wonder at it. But
  observe:</p>

  <p>"You have seen a pudding stirred? The stupidest cook in the world can pour
  ingredients into a basin and stir them with water until they become something
  compounded, that does not in the least resemble any one of the component
  parts. Is that not so? The same fool bakes what he has mixed. A chemical
  process takes place, and behold! the idiot has wrought a miracle. Again,
  there is almost no resemblance to what the mixture was before. It even tastes
  and smells quite different. It looks different. Its specific gravity is
  changed. Its properties are altered. It is now digestible. It decomposes at a
  different speed. It has lost some of the original qualities that went into
  the mixture, and has taken on others that apparently were not there before
  the chemical process began.</p>

  <p>"You can see the same thing in a foundry, where they mix zinc with copper
  and produce brass, and the brass has qualities that neither zinc nor copper
  appears to contain. A deaf and dumb man, knowing neither writing nor
  arithmetic, could produce brass from zinc and copper. A savage, who never saw
  an abstraction, can produce wine from grapes. Good. Now listen, Sahib:</p>

  <p>"Let us dive beneath the surface of these experiments. The capacity to
  become brass under certain conditions was inherent to begin with in the zinc
  and in the copper, was it not? But how so? It was inherent in the atoms, of
  which the zinc and the copper are composed; and, behind those again, in the
  electrons, of which the atoms are composed. Let us then consider the
  electrons.</p>

  <p>"Suppose that we knew how to pour electrons into a receptacle and make, so
  to speak, a pudding of them! Could we not work what the world would think are
  miracles? I have made diamonds in my workshop. I believe I can make gold.
  What could I not do, if I knew how to manage electrons in the raw&mdash;
  electrons, in every one of which is the capacity to become absolutely
  anything!</p>

  <p>"It has possibly not occurred to you, Ommonee, but the more I pursue my
  studies the more I am convinced that there was once a race of people in the
  world, or possibly a school of scientists drawn from many then-existent
  races, who knew how to manage electrons. I think they lived simultaneously
  with the cave-men. We find the bones of cave-men because those were ignorant
  people, such as the Bushmen of today, who buried their dead. We do not find
  the bones of the scientists of that period, because they were enlightened and
  disposed of corpses in the fire. The art of the cave-men is evidence that
  there was art of a very high order, which someone presumably taught. They
  painted pictures in caves into which no sunlight penetrated; therefore, there
  must have been artificial light of a sort superior to torches or tallow
  candles, because otherwise the color work would have been impossible. That is
  proof that there was science in those days, of which the cave-men could avail
  themselves just as today a lunatic may use electric light. And the fact that
  we find no traces at present of what we can recognize as a very high order of
  civilization then existent is no proof that there was none; it may have been
  totally different from anything with which we are familiar. Furthermore, the
  world has only been extremely superficially explored.</p>

  <p>"Be patient, Ommonee. I am coming to my point. I have studied that piece
  of jade. Three days and nights I studied it without sleep. To me its peculiar
  properties appear to confirm observations&mdash;micro-photographic
  observations that I have made and recorded during a period of ten years. In
  its essence, what is photography? It is the practice, by means of chemicals,
  of rendering visible to the human eye impressions of objects produced by
  light on a prepared surface. It is necessary to prepare the surface, which we
  call a dry plate or a film, because we do not yet know how else to render the
  light-made impression visible to the human eye. But it is there, whether we
  make it visible or not. And what I have discovered is this: that every
  particle of matter has a photographic quality, which varies only in degree.
  You stand against a rock&mdash;and not necessarily in sunlight, although
  sunlight helps; your impression is indelibly photographed on that rock, as I
  can prove, if you have time to witness some experiments. It is photographed
  on anything against which you stand. Other images may be superimposed on
  yours, but yours remains. In rare instances, in certain atmospheric
  conditions, these impressions become visible without any other chemical
  process, although it seems to require a certain nervous state of alertness
  before the human eye can perceive them.</p>

  <p>"You remember the case of the Brahmin* who hanged himself in a cellar not
  far from this shop of mine? His body hung there for a day before they found
  it. For weeks afterward what was supposed to be his ghost was seen&mdash;by
  scores of reputable witnesses&mdash;hanging from the beam. That was several
  years ago. There was a great stir made about it at the time, and there were
  letters to the newspapers stating instances of similar occurrences. There was
  an investigation by experts from a research society, who denounced the whole
  story as an imposture.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Brahmin</i>&mdash;a member of the highest of the
  Hindu <i>varnas</i> (castes)&mdash;that of priests and teachers. The word is
  related to, but not to be confused with, the Hindu religious conception of
  the transcendent and immanent supreme soul, "Brahman". For in-depth
  information, see the <i>Wikipedia</i> article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin">Brahmin</a>. ]</p>

  <p>"However, I was one of those who saw the ghost, and I made notes, and some
  experiments. Finally I photographed it! That satisfied me. I am sure that the
  alleged ghost was nothing but a photograph made on the wall, and that it was
  rendered visible by certain chemical conditions, not all of which I have been
  able to ascertain.</p>

  <p>"Now then: if that is possible in one instance, it is possible in every
  instance. There is no such thing as an exception in nature; we have
  discovered a law. So take this piece of jade: we see things when we look into
  it. I deduce that they are photographic. And because no other piece of stone
  that I know of has the same quality of receiving impressions that are
  instantaneously visible, it seems probable to me that it has been
  intelligently treated by someone who knew how to do that."</p>

  <p>"It might be a natural chemical process," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"I think not. Have you noticed that the strange moving images visible
  within the stone are not the reflections of objects? The stone is not a
  mirror in the ordinary sense. It does not seem to reflect at all the objects
  that surround it. I have never succeeded in seeing my face in it, for
  instance, although I have tried repeatedly, in all sorts of light, from every
  angle. It appears to me to reflect thought!"</p>

  <p>Ommony made the peculiar noise between tongue and teeth that suggests
  polite but otherwise unconditioned incredulity. Chutter Chand, deep in his
  theme, ignored the interruption.</p>

  <p>"I believe it reflects character! I believe that every thought that every
  man thinks, from the day he is born until the day he dies, leaves an
  invisible impress on his mind as well as a visible impress on his body. You
  know how changing character affects the lines on the palm of a man's hand, on
  the soles of his feet, at the corners of his eyes, at his mouth, and so on?
  Well: something of the same sort goes on in his mind, which is invisible and
  what we call intangible, but is nevertheless made up of electrons in motion.
  And those impressions are permanent. I believe that somebody, who knew how to
  manipulate electrons, has treated this stone in such a way that it reflects
  the whole of a man's thought since he was born&mdash;just as a stone wall, if
  it could be treated properly, could be shown to retain the photograph of
  every object that had passed before it since the wall was built.</p>

  <p>"I believe this was done very anciently, and for this reason: that if any
  one possessed of such intelligence and skill were alive in the world today,
  his intelligence would burn itself into our consciousness, so that we could
  not help but know of him.</p>

  <p>"I am of opinion that the process to which the jade was subjected rendered
  it at the same time transparent; because it is not in the nature of jade to
  be quite transparent normally. And in my mind there is connected with all
  this the knowledge (which is common property) that the Chinese&mdash;a very
  ancient race&mdash;regard jade as a sacred stone. Why? Is it not possible
  that jade peculiarly lends itself to this treatment, and that, though the
  science is forgotten, the dim memory of the peculiar property of the stone
  persists?"</p>

  <p>"You've a fine imagination!" said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"And what is imagination, Ommonee, if not a bridge between the known and
  unknown? Between conventional so-called knowledge and the unexplored realm of
  truth? Have you no imagination? Electricity was possible a thousand years
  ago; but until imagination hinted at the possibility, who had the use of
  it?"</p>

  <p>Ommony returned the stone to his pocket. He was interested, and he liked
  Chutter Chand, but it occurred to him that he was wasting time.</p>

  <p>"You're right, of course," he said, "that we have to imagine a thing
  before we can begin to understand it or produce or make it."</p>

  <p>"Surely. You imagined your forest, Ommonee, before you planted it. But
  between imagination and production, there in labor. You see, what the West
  can't understand it scoffs at, whereas what the East can't understand it
  calls sacred and guards against all-comers! I think you will have to
  penetrate a secret that has been guarded for thousands of years. They say,
  you know, that there are Masters who guard these secrets and let them out a
  little at a time. May the gods whom you happen to vote for be grateful and
  assist you! I would like to go on the adventure with you&mdash;but I am a
  family man. I am afraid. I am not strong. That stone has thrilled me,
  Ommonee!"</p>

  <p>"If you like, I'll leave it with you for some more experiments," said
  Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Sahib&mdash;my friend&mdash;I wouldn't keep it for a rajah's ransom! It
  was traced to this place&mdash;how, I don't know. You noticed the policeman
  at the door? He is put there to keep out murderers! There has been a ruffian
  here&mdash;a Hillman&mdash;a cutthroat who said he came from Spiti*&mdash;a
  great savage with a saw-edge tulwar!&dagger; Ugh! He demanded the stone. He
  demanded to know where it was. If it had not been that I had a shop-full of
  customers, and that I promised to try to get the stone back from the man who
  now had it, he would have cut me in halves! He said so! I am afraid all the
  time that he will return, or that some of his friends will come. Oh, I wish I
  had your lack of an imagination, Ommonee! I could feel his saw-edged tulwar
  plunging into me! Listen!" (Chutter Chand began to tremble visibly.) "Who is
  that?"</p>

  <p>Ommony glanced into the shop. There were two men, evidently unarmed or the
  "constabeel" would never have admitted them, standing talking to the clerk
  across the show-case-counter. One was apparently a very old man and the other
  very young. Both were dressed in the Tibetan costume, but the older man was
  speaking English, which was of itself sufficiently remarkable, and he
  appeared to be slightly amused because the clerk insisted that Chutter Chand
  was "absent on a journey." Neither man paid the slightest attention to the
  jewelry in the show case; they were evidently bent on seeing Chutter Chand,
  and nothing else.</p>

  <p>"Admit 'em!" whispered Ommony. "I'll hide. No, never mind the dog; she'll
  follow them in and sniff them over. If they ask about the dog, say she
  belongs to one of your customers who left her in your charge for an hour or
  two. What's behind that brass Buddha?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, Sahib. It is hollow. There is no back."</p>

  <p>"That'll do then. Help me pull it out from the wall&mdash;quick!&mdash;
  quiet!"</p>

  <p>They made rather a lot of noise and Diana came in to investigate, which
  was opportune. Ommony gave her orders sotto voce and she returned into the
  shop to watch the two curious visitors.</p>

  <p>"Now, don't let yourself get frightened out of your wits, Chutter Chand.
  Encourage 'em to talk. Ask any idiotic question that occurs to you. When
  they're ready to go, let 'em. And then, whatever you do, don't say a word to
  the policeman."</p>

  <p>Ommony stepped behind the image of the Buddha. Chutter Chand, leaning all
  his weight against it, shoved it back nearly into place, but left sufficient
  space between it and the wall for Ommony to see into an old cracked mirror
  that reflected almost everything in the room. Then, taking a visible hold on
  his emotions, Chutter Chand strode to the door and stood there for a moment
  Looking&mdash;listening&mdash;trying to breathe normally. He forced a smile
  at last.</p>

  <p>"Oh, let them in&mdash;I will talk to them," he said to the clerk in
  English, with an air of almost perfect, patronizing nonchalance. Only a very
  close observer might have known he was afraid&mdash;that fear, perhaps, in
  him was more than "recognition of something that the senses do not
  understand."</p>

  "I am one who strives to tread the middle way."</h2>

  <p class="quote">We should ascend out of perversity, even as we ascend a
  mountain that we do not know, with the aid of guides who do know. None who
  sets forth on an unknown voyage stipulates that the pilot must agree with him
  as to the course, since manifestly that would be absurd; the pilot is
  presumed to know; the piloted does not know. None who climbs a mountain
  bargains that the guide shall keep to this or that direction; it is the
  business of the guide to lead. And yet, men hire guides for the Spiritual
  Journey, of which they know less than they know of land and sea, and
  stipulate that the guide shall lead them thus and so, according to their own
  imaginings; and instead of obeying him, they desert and denounce him, should
  he lead them otherwise. I find this of the essence of perversity.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THE two Tibetans entered, the older man leading, and
  squatted on a mat which the younger man spread on the floor. Their manner
  suggested that they had accepted an invitation, instead of having gained
  admission by persistence; but Ommony, watching every movement in the mirror,
  noticed that the older man laid his hand on the seat of the chair he himself
  had just occupied&mdash;which, being old, he might have done to help himself
  down on the mat, but, being active, he almost certainly did for another
  reason.</p>

  <p>Chutter Chand sat at his desk magisterially, wiping at the gold-rimmed
  spectacles again, waiting for the visitors to speak first. But they were not
  to be tempted into that indiscretion. They sat still and were bland, while
  Diana came and deliberately sniffed them over. The hound seemed interested;
  she lay down where she could watch them both, her jowl on her paws, one ear
  up, and her tail moving slightly from side to side clearing a fan-shaped
  pattern in the dust.</p>

  <p>The old man was a miracle of wrinkles. He resembled one of those Chinese
  statuettes in ivory, yellowed by time, that suggest that life is much too
  comical a business to be taken seriously&mdash;much too serious a business to
  be cumbered with pride and possessions. He was a living paradox in a long,
  snuff-colored robe, the ends of which he arranged over his lap, leaving the
  hairy strong legs of a mountaineer uncovered. He helped himself to an
  enormous quantity of snuff from an old Chinese silver box, that he presently
  stowed away in a fold of his garment. The pungent stuff appeared to have no
  effect on him, although Diana, catching a whiff of it, sneezed violently and
  Chutter Chand followed suit.</p>

  <p>The young man was another ivory enigma, absolutely smooth in contrast to
  the elder's wrinkles, and much paler. He, too, wore snuff-colored clothes.
  His head was wrapped in a turban of gorgeously embroidered brown silk, in
  contract to the other's monkish simplicity, and the cloth of which his cloak
  was made seemed to be of lighter and better material than the older man's. He
  was remarkably good-looking&mdash;straight-featured and calm-placid, not
  apparently from self-contentment but from assurance that life holds a
  definite purpose and that he was being led along the narrow road. There was
  an air of good temper and wisdom about him, no apparent pride nor any mean
  humility. His eyes were blue-gray, his hands small, strong and artistic. His
  feet, too, were small but evidently used to walking. He was in every
  dimension smaller than the older man, unless mind is a dimension; they
  appeared to be equals in mental aroma, and they exuded that in the mysterious
  way of a painting by Goya y Lucientes.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you want?" Chutter Chand asked at last in English. It was a
  ridiculous language, on the face of it, to use to a Tibetan; but the older
  man had been using English in the outer shop, and Chutter Chand knew no
  Prakrit* dialect.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Prakrit</i> (Sanskrit)&mdash;1) any of the
  vernacular and literary Indic languages recorded from the third century BCE
  to the fourth century CE, as opposed to Sanskrit. 2) any of the modern Indic
  languages. <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/18/P0501800.html"><i>The
  American Heritage Dictionary</i></a>. For more information, see the
  <i>Wikipedia</i> article <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakrit">Prakrit</a>. ]</p>

  <p>The answer, in English devoid of any noticeable accent, was given by the
  older man in a voice as full of humor as his wrinkled face.</p>

  <p>"The piece of jade," he said, unblinking, ending on a rising note that
  suggested there was nothing to explain, nothing to argue about, nothing to do
  but be reasonable. He snapped his fingers, and Diana, normally a most
  suspicious dog, came close to him. He ran his fingers through her hair and
  she laid her huge jowl on his knee. Chutter Chand crossed and uncrossed his
  legs restlessly.</p>

  <p>"I haven't it," said the jeweler. "Besides&mdash;er&mdash; ah&mdash; you
  would have to tell me your&mdash;that is&mdash;er&mdash; you would have to
  establish first by what right you make such a demand. You understand me?"</p>

  <p>"I have made no demand," the old man answered, smiling. His voice was
  sweetly reasonable; his bright old eyes twinkled. "You have asked what I
  want. I have told you."</p>

  <p>"Tell me who you are," said Chutter Chand.</p>

  <p>"My son, I am a Lama. I am one who strives to tread the Middle Way."</p>

  <p>"Where from?"</p>

  <p>"From desire into peace!"</p>

  <p>"I mean, what, place do you come from?"</p>

  <p>"From the same place that the piece of jade came from, my son. From the
  place to which he who desires merit will return it."</p>

  <p>"Is the jade yours?" asked Chutter Chand.</p>

  <p>"Is the air mine? Are the stars mine?" the Lama answered, smiling as if
  the idea of possessing anything were a joke made by an inquiring child.</p>

  <p>"Well; what right have you to the piece of jade?" Chutter Chand snapped
  back at him. He let the irritation through without intending it and smiled
  directly afterward in an attempt to undo the impression. But if the Lama had
  noticed the acerbity, he made no sign.</p>

  <p>"None, any more than you have," came the answer in the same mild voice.
  "None has any right to it. I have a duty to return it to whence it came
  &mdash;and a duty to you, to preserve you from impertinence, if that may be.
  It is not good, Chutter Chand, to meddle with knowledge before the time
  appointed for its understanding. He who would tread the Middle Way is
  patient, keeping both feet on the ground and his head no higher than humility
  will let it reach. Be wise&mdash;O man of intellectual desires! Destruction
  is in rashness."</p>

  <p>His fingers touched Diana's collar and twisted it around until the small
  brass plate, on which Ommony's name was engraved, came uppermost; but his
  eyes continued to look straight at Chutter Chand. It was the younger man,
  squatting in silence beside him, his head and body motionless, whose bright
  eyes took in every detail of the room, not omitting to notice the movement of
  the Lama's hand. Except for the eyes, his face continued perfectly
  expressionless.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash; ah&mdash; before I answer definitely, I would like
  you to tell me about the jade," said Chutter Chand. "You will find me
  reasonable. I am not a sacrilegious person. Er&mdash; ah&mdash; can you not
  establish to my satisfaction that&mdash;ah&mdash;I would be doing rightly
  to&mdash;er&mdash; let us say, to entrust the piece of jade to you?"</p>

  <p>"I think you know that already," said the Lama, in a voice of mild
  reproof, as if he were speaking to a child of whom he was rather fond. "What
  does your heart say, my son? It is the heart that answers wisely, if desire
  has been subdued. I have come a very long way&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Desiring the piece of jade!" sneered Chutter Chand&mdash;regretting the
  sneer instantly&mdash;driving fingernails into the palm of his hand with
  impatience of himself.</p>

  <p>"True," said the Lama. "Desire is not easy to destroy. Yet I do not desire
  it for myself. And for you I desire peace&mdash;and merit. May the Lord live
  in your heart and guide you in the Middle Way."</p>

  <p>The jeweler moved restlessly. The atmosphere was getting on his nerves.
  There was an indefinable feeling of being in the presence of superiority,
  which is irritating to a man of intellect.</p>

  <p>"You mean, there will be no peace for me unless I give up the piece of
  jade to you?" he asked tartly.</p>

  <p>"I think that is so," said the Lama gently.</p>

  <p>"Well; it is not in my possession."</p>

  <p>"But you know who has it," said the Lama, looking straight at him.</p>

  <p>The jeweler did not answer, and the Lama's eyes beamed with intelligence.
  The young Tibetan moved at last and whispered in his ear. The Lama nodded
  almost imperceptibly, turning the dog's collar around again with leisurely
  fingers, whose touch seemed magically satisfying to Diana. He looked once,
  sharply, at the big brass Buddha, let his eyes rest again on the jeweler's,
  and went on speaking. "What a man cannot do is no weight against him. It be
  the hand of Destiny, preventing him from a mistake. The deeds a man does are
  the fruits that are weighed in the balance and from which the seeds of future
  lives are saved. Peace be with you. Peace refresh you. Peace give you peace
  that you may multiply it, Chutter Chand."</p>

  <p>The Lama arose and the younger man rolled up the mat. Diana jumped to her
  feet. Chutter Chand, made an attempt to get out of his chair with dignity;
  but the Lama seemed to have monopolized in his own person all the dignity
  there was in sight, which was embarrassing. "Er&mdash; ah&mdash; I appreciate
  the blessing. Er&mdash; ah&mdash; are you going? But you haven't told me what
  I asked about the jade&mdash;ah&mdash;would you care to come again?
  &mdash;Perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Lama smiled, stroked Diana's head, bowed, so that his long skirts
  swung like a bronze bell, and one almost expected a resonant boom to follow,
  and led the way out, followed by the younger man, who smiled once so suddenly
  and brightly that Chutter Chand's nervous irritation vanished. But it
  returned the moment they had gone. He jumped at the noise Ommony made pushing
  the brass Buddha away from the wall.</p>

  <p>"Damn them both!" he exploded. "Sahib, I hate to be mystified! I detest to
  be patronized! I feel I made myself contemptible! I could not think! I could
  not make my brain invent the questions that I should have asked!"</p>

  <p>"You did pretty well," said Ommony. "See 'em home, girl!"</p>

  <p>Diana's tail went between her legs, but she did not hesitate; she trotted
  out of the shop&mdash;stood still a moment on the sidewalk&mdash;sniffed
  &mdash;vanished.</p>

  <p>"Sahib, they will send someone to loot this shop of mine! Ommonee&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"Tut-tut! Those two didn't overlook one detail. The young one read my name
  on Diana's collar and whispered it to the Lama. The Lama knew I was behind
  the Buddha. He suspected something when he felt the chair-seat and found it
  warm."</p>

  <p>"Worse and worse!" said Chutter Chand despondently. "To incur the enmity
  of such people is more dangerous than to tamper with my snakes!"</p>

  <p>Chutter Chand, his brain full of western and eastern science, his suit
  from London and his turban from Lahore, yearned to the West for protection
  from eastern mystery. Ommony, all English, steeped in the Orient for twenty
  years, had thrown his thought eastward and was reckoning like lightning in
  terms of Indian thought.</p>

  <p>"They didn't suspect my presence until after they came in here. Shut up,
  Chutter Chand! Listen to me!&mdash;They'll have brought a man to watch
  outside the shop and follow anyone who follows them. They can't have
  cautioned him about the dog, because they didn't know about the dog, and they
  would never suspect a dog of having enough intelligence. Their man will be
  still out there watching the shop-door. Wait here!"</p>

  <p>He ran into the outer shop, hid behind one of the curtains at the door,
  and stood facing the mirror that gave him a view of the "constabeel's" back
  and of fifty yards of crowded street, including the sidewalk opposite. The
  "constabeel" appeared to be intently watching somebody, and in less than a
  minute Ommony picked out the individual&mdash;a tall, good-looking, boy-faced
  Hillman in a costume that suggested Bhutan or Sikkim&mdash; shapeless
  trousers and a long robe over them, with a sort of jacket on top of that. He
  was trying to look innocent, which is the surest way of attracting attention;
  and he was so intent on watching the shop-door that passers-by continually
  bunted into him&mdash;whereat he seemed to find it hard to keep his temper.
  Ommony watched him for a minute or two, and then spoke to the policeman
  through the curtain.</p>

  <p>The policeman nearly gave the game away by turning his head to listen, but
  spat and scratched himself to cover the mistake. Ommony repeated his
  instructions carefully and the policeman strolled down-street. Ommony emerged
  and walked slowly in the opposite direction; over the way, the Hillman began
  at once to follow him, suiting his pace to Ommony's. Ommony crossed the
  street; so did the policeman. Ommony turned and walked toward the Hillman;
  the policeman followed suit, approaching from the rear. Ommony came to a halt
  exactly in front of the Hillman, feeling dwarfed by the man's big-boned
  stature and aware of the handle of a long knife just emerging through a slit
  in a robe that reeked strongly of ghee.* The policeman, nervously fingering
  his club, halted to the Hillman's rear, six feet away. Passers-by began to
  detect food for curiosity; there were searching glances and a palpable
  hesitation; there would have been a crowd in sixty seconds.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>ghee</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a clarified semifluid butter
  used especially in Indian cooking. <i><a href=
  "http://www.bartleby.com/61/17/G0111700.html">The American Heritage
  Dictionary</a></i>. ]</p>

  <p>"Come with me," said Ommony, in Prakrit.</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the Hillman, staring at him, wide-eyed with surprise at being
  spoken to in his own tongue.</p>

  <p>"Because if you do, no harm will come to you; and if you don't you'll go
  to jail."</p>

  <p>The Hillman's hand crept instinctively toward his knife, and the policeman
  made ready to swing for the back of his head with a hard-wood club.</p>

  <p>"Are you a fool, that you don't know a friend when you meet one?" asked
  Ommony.</p>

  <p>"I have met enemies, and women, and one or two whom I called master, and
  many whom I have mastered&mdash;but never a friend yet!" the Hillman
  answered. "Who art thou?"</p>

  <p>"Come with me and learn," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>The Hillman hesitated, but the crowd was distinctly beginning to gather
  now&mdash;a little way off, not sure yet but alert for the first hint of
  happenings. It grew clear to the Hillman that escape might not be easy.</p>

  <p>"I fear no man!" he said, turning his head and recognizing the policeman,
  who was hardly two-thirds his size. He spat eloquently for the policeman's
  benefit, missing him neatly by about the thickness of a knife-blade.
  "Whither!" he asked then, looking straight into Ommony's eyes.</p>

  <p>Ommony led the way across the street into Chutter Chand's shop, where he
  halted to let the Hillman go in first.</p>

  <p>"Nay, lead on!" said the Hillman, stepping aside.</p>

  <p>"No. For you have a weapon and I have none. Moreover, I have said I am a
  friend, and I prefer to be a living friend rather than a dead one! Go in
  first," laughed Ommony.</p>

  <p>The Hillman laughed back. There was none of the solemnity about him that
  enshrouds the men from the Northwest frontier. Eastward along the Himalayas,
  where the smell of sweat leaves off and the smell of rancid butter begins,
  laughter becomes part of life and not an insult or indignity. He swaggered
  into the shop with no more argument and at a nod from Ommony walked straight
  through to the office at the rear.</p>

  <p>"Krishna!"* exclaimed Chutter Chand. He jumped for a corner, seized a two-
  handed Samurai sword, drew it from the scabbard, and laid it on the desk. "I
  will let my snakes loose!" he almost screamed, in Hindustani.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Krishna</i> (Sanskrit)&mdash;one of the most

  <p>But the Hillman sat down on the floor, on the exact spot where the Lama
  had been, and Ommony sat down in the chair facing him, motioning to Chutter
  Chand to resume the other chair and be sensible.</p>

  <p>"But this is the ruffian who came and threatened me!" said Chutter Chand.
  "That knife of his is saw-edged! Take it from him, Ommonee!"</p>

  <p>The Hillman appeared to know no English, but seemed to have made up his
  mind about Ommony. Friendship he might not believe in, but he could recognize
  good faith. He watched Ommony's face as a child follows a motion picture.</p>

  <p>"What is your name?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Dawa Tsering."</p>

  <p>"Where are you from?"</p>

  <p>"Spiti."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" exclaimed Chutter Chand. "Does he say he is from Spiti? They
  are all devils who come from that country! It is there they practise
  polyandry, and their dead are eaten by dogs! He is unclean!"</p>

  <p>"Who is that Lama who was in here just now?" Ommony went on.</p>

  <p>"Tsiang Samdup."</p>

  <p>Chutter Chand did not catch that name; or, if he did, the name meant
  nothing to him. Ommony, on the other hand, had to use all his power of will
  to suppress excitement, and even so he could not quite control himself. The
  Hillman noticed the change of expression.</p>

  <p>"Aye," he said, "Tsiang Samdup is a great one."</p>

  <p>"Who is the other who was with him&mdash;the young one?"</p>

  <p>"His chela."*</p>

  <p>"What name?"</p>

  <p>"Samding. Some call him San-fun-ho."</p>

  <p>"And what have you to do with them?"</p>

  <p>Instead of answering, the Hillman retorted with a question.</p>

  <p>"What is thy name? Say it again. Ommonee? That sounds like a name with
  magic in it. Om mani padme hum!* Who gave thee that name? Eh? Thy father had
  it? Who was he? How is it a man should take his father's name? Is the spirit
  of the father not offended? Thou art a strange one, Ommonee."</p>

  <p>"Why did you come in here some days ago and threaten Chutter Chand?" asked
  Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Why not!" said the Hillman. "Did I not ride under a te-rain, like a leech
  on the belly of a horse, more hours and miles than an eagle knows of? Did I
  not eat dust&mdash;and nothing else? Did I not follow that rat Tin Lal to
  this place? Did I not&mdash;pretending to admire the cobra in the window
  &mdash;see him with my own eyes sell the green stone to this little
  lover-of-snakes? I said too much. I did too little. I should have slain them
  both! But I feared, because I am a stranger in the city and there were many
  people. Moreover, I had already slain a man&mdash;a Hindu, who drove an iron
  car and broke the wheel of the cart I rode in. I slew him with a spoke from
  the broken wheel. And it seemed to me that if I should slay another man too
  soon thereafter, it might fare ill with me, since the gods grow weary of
  protecting a man too often. So I returned four days later, thinking the gods
  might have forgotten the previous affair. They owe me many favors. I have
  treated the gods handsomely. And when this little rat of a jeweler swore he
  no longer had the stone, I threatened him. I would have slain him if I
  thought he really had it, but it seemed to me he told the truth. And he
  promised to get the stone back from someone to whom he had entrusted it. And
  I, vowing I would sever him in halves unless he should keep faith, went and
  told Tsiang Samdup, who came here accordingly, I following to protect the old
  man. I suppose Tsiang Samdup now has the stone. Is that so?"</p>

  <p>"He shall have it," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"I think thou art not a liar," said the Hillman, looking straight into
  Ommony's eyes. "Now, I am a liar. If I should have said that to thee, it
  would only be a fool who would believe me, and a fool is nothing to be
  patient with. But I am not a fool, and I believe thee&mdash;or I would plunge
  this knife into thy liver! Who taught thee to speak my language?"</p>

  <p>Ommony saw fit not to answer that. "Is it not enough for thee that I can
  speak it? Where can I find the holy Lama Tsiang Samdup?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, as to that, he is not particularly holy&mdash;although others seem to
  think he is; but I am from Spiti, where we study devils and consider nonsense
  all this talk about purity and self-abnegation and Nirvana.* Who wants to go
  to Nirvana? What a miserable place&mdash;just nothing! Besides, I know
  better. I have studied these things. It is very simple. Knife a man in the
  bowels, as the Gurkhas do with a kukri,&dagger; or as I do as a rule, and he
  goes to hell for a while; he has a chance; by and by he comes to life again.
  Cut his throat, however, and he dwells between earth and heaven; he will come
  and haunt thee, having nothing else to do, and that is very bad. Hit him
  here&mdash;" (he laid a finger on his forehead, just above the nose)
  &mdash;"and he is dead. That should only be done to men who are very bad
  indeed. And that is the whole secret of religion."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Nirvana</i> (Sanskrit)&mdash;in Buddhism, Jainism,
  and Hinduism, a state of supreme liberation and bliss, contrasted to samsara
  or bondage in the repeating cycle of death and rebirth. The word in Sanskrit
  refers to the going out of a flame once its fuel has been consumed; it thus
  suggests both the end of suffering and the cessation of desires that
  perpetuate bondage. Epithets of nirvana in Buddhism include "the free," "the
  immortal," and "the unconditioned." Nirvana is attainable in life, and the
  death of one who has attained it is termed parinirvana, or complete nirvana.
  This has often been interpreted as annihilation, but in fact the Buddhist
  scriptures say that the state of the enlightened man beyond death cannot be
  described. Nirvana in the different Indian traditions is achieved by moral
  discipline and the practice of yoga leading to the extinction of all
  attachment and ignorance. <i><a href=

  <p>Ommony looked serious. "I would like to talk to you about
  religion&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I could teach you the whole of it in a very short time."</p>

  <p>"&mdash; but meanwhile, I would like to know where the holy Lama Tsiang
  Samdup is staying."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said the Hillman.</p>

  <p>"You are lying," said Ommony. "Is that not so?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. Did you think I would tell you the truth?"</p>

  <p>"No. That hardly occurred to me. Well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Diana came in, waving her long tail slowly. She flopped on the floor
  beside Ommony and there was silence for about a minute while the Hillman
  stared at her and she returned the gaze with interest. Finally her lip
  curled, showing a prodigious yellow fang and Ommony laid a hand on her head
  to silence a thunderous growl.</p>

  <p>"That is an incarnation of a devil!" said the Hillman. "In my country we
  keep dogs as big as her to eat corpses. Devils, as a rule, are very evil, but
  I think that one&mdash;" (he nodded at the dog) "&mdash;is worse than others.
  Well&mdash;I go. Say to that fool at the door that he should not offend me
  with his little stick, for it may be he desires to live. I am glad I met
  thee, Ommonee."</p>

  <p>He waved his hand, smiled like a Chinese cherub, and walked out, ignoring
  Chutter Chand as utterly as if he had never seen him; and at the door he
  smiled at the policeman as the sun smiles on manure. The policeman did his
  best, but could not keep himself from grinning back.</p>

  But there is a Middle Way, which avoids all trespassing.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">CHUTTER CHAND'S usefulness had vanished. His brain did not
  function now that fear had the upper hand. He could think of nothing but the
  Hillman's knife and of the possibility that there might be more Hillmen, who
  would knock down the policeman at the door, storm the shop, loot everything
  and slay.</p>

  <p>"I tell you, Ommonee, you have only lived in India twenty years. You do
  not know these people!"</p>

  <p>He began hurriedly putting in order a mechanical system of wire and
  weights by which the snakes might be released in an emergency, all the while
  complaining bitterly against a government whose laws forbade the keeping of
  firearms by responsible, reputable, law-abiding citizens.</p>

  <p>Ommony laughed and walked out with both fists in his pockets, preceded by
  Diana, who was a lady of one idea at a time, and that one next door to an
  obsession. She had "seen 'em home." Ergo, she should now show Ommony where
  "home" was, and he was quite satisfied to follow her. To have tracked Dawa
  Tsering the Hillman would simply have been waste of time, for the man would
  soon see he was followed and would almost certainly play a great game of
  follow-my-leader all over town. Moreover, the very name of the Lama-Tsiang
  Samdup&mdash;had excited Ommony in the sort of way that news of an ancient
  tomb excites an archeologist.</p>

  <p>It was well on toward evening&mdash;that quarter-of-an-hour when the
  streets are most densely thronged and every one seems in a hurry to get home
  or to get something done before starting homeward. All cities are alike in
  that respect; there is a spate before the slack of supper-time and temple
  services.</p>

  <p>The hound threaded her way patiently through the crowd and turned down a
  narrow thoroughfare past fruit and vegetable shops, where chafferers were
  arguing to cheapen produce at the day's end and all the races of the Punjab
  seemed to be mixed in tired confusion&mdash;faded and ill-tempered because
  the evening breeze had not yet come, and walls were giving off the oven-heat
  they had stored up during the day.</p>

  <p>There was no especial need to take precautions. Sufficient time had
  elapsed since the Lama and his young companion left the Chandni Chowk to
  convince them they had not been followed; and in any case, the most
  ill-advised thing Ommony could have done would have been to act secretively.
  A man attracts the least attention if he goes straight forward.</p>

  <p>Those who noticed him at all admired, or feared, the dog, and she paid no
  attention even to the mongrels of her own genus, who snarled from a
  respectable distance or fled down alleyways. Diana turned at last down
  suffocating passages that led one into another between blind walls, where
  death might overtake a man without causing a stir a dozen yards away. But if
  you think of death in India, you die. To live, you must think of living, and
  be interested.</p>

  <p>One of the passages opened at last into a square, whose walls were built
  of blocks that had been quarried from the ancient city; (for cities surrender
  themselves to posterity, even as human mothers do). The paving was of the
  same material, still bearing traces of the ancient carving, but rearranged at
  random so that the pattern was all gone. At the end of the courtyard was a
  stone building of three stories, whose upper windows overlooked it. (Those
  below had been bricked up.) There was an open door in the wall, that led into
  a long arched passage in which other doors to right and left were visible.
  Diana ran straight to the open door, and stopped.</p>

  <p>Ommony began to feel now like a sailor on a lee shore, with rocks ahead
  and pirates to windward. It was growing dark, for one thing. At any moment
  the Hillman with the saw-edged knife and the haphazard notions about death
  might approach down the passage from the rear. Forward lay unknown territory,
  and a buttery smell that more than hinted at the presence of northerners,
  whose notions of hospitality might be less than none at all. He could be seen
  through the window-shutters, but could not see in through them. And he had in
  his pocket the lump of jade, that had lured men all the way from beyond
  Tilgaun into the hot plains that they hate. He wished he had left the jade
  somewhere.</p>

  <p>It was the sound of a footstep some distance behind, that might be the
  Hillman's, which decided him. He strode forward and entered the door, his
  footsteps echoing under the arch. Diana followed, growling; she seemed to
  have a feeling they were being watched.</p>

  <p>The passage presently turned to right and left in darkness, and Ommony, as
  he paused to consider, became acutely conscious that his trespass was not
  only rash, but impudent. He had no vestige of right to intrude himself into
  the quarters of strangers, nor had he the excuse that he did not know what he
  was doing. A tourist might commit such an impertinence and be forgiven on the
  ground of ignorance, but if he should be knifed for ill-manners he would not
  be entitled to the slightest sympathy. He decided at once to retrace his
  steps; and as he turned to face the dim light in the doorway a voice spoke to
  him in English suddenly, making his skin creep.</p>

  <p>Diana barked savagely at a small iron grating in a door to one side of the
  passage, filling the arch with echoes. It took him several seconds to get the
  dog quiet. Then the voice again:</p>

  <p>"Go away from here! Go away quickly!"</p>

  <p>It sounded like a boy's voice&mdash;young&mdash;educated. It was not
  pitched high; there was no note of excitement&mdash;hardly any emphasis.
  Diana barked again furiously, and there was no time for hesitation; either he
  was in danger or he was not; the hound said, Yes; the boy's voice implied it;
  curiosity said, Stay! Common sense said, Make for the open quickly! Intuition
  said, Jump! and intuition is a despot whom it is not wise to disobey.</p>

  <p>He reached the courtyard neck and neck with Diana, who nearly knocked him
  over as she faced about savagely with every hair bristling, fangs bared, eyes
  aglare. He seized her by collar and tail and threw his weight backward to
  stop her from springing at the throat of a man in dingy gray, who paused in
  mid-stride, one hand behind him, in the doorway. There was another man behind
  him, dimly outlined in the gloom. Their faces, high-cheek-boned and fanatical
  &mdash;almost Chinese&mdash;were fiercely confident, and why they paused was
  not self-evident; for the man who held a hand behind his back was armed, and
  with something heavy, as the angle of his shoulder proved.</p>

  <p>Diana saved that second. Her animal instinct was quicker than Ommony's
  eye, that read anticipation in the faces in front of him. She nearly knocked
  Ommony over again as she reversed the direction of effort, broke the collar-
  hold and sprang past him, burying her fangs in something (Ommony knew that
  gurgling, smothered growl). She had knocked him sidewise and he spun to
  regain his balance while a ten-pound tulwar split the whistling air where his
  back had been. He was just in time to seize the wrist that swung the weapon
  &mdash;seize it with both hands and wrench it forward in the direction of
  effort. The saw-edged tulwar clattered on the paving-blocks, but the enemy
  did not fall, for Diana had him by the throat and was wrenching in the
  opposite direction. It was Dawa Tsering!</p>

  <p>The Hillman's hands groped for the hound's forelegs; to wrench those apart
  was his only chance, unless Ommony could save him. A spring tiger-trap was
  more likely to let go than Diana with a throat-hold. Ommony took the only
  chance in sight; he yelled "Guard!" to Diana, and crashed his fist into the
  Hillman's jaw, knocking him flat on his back as Diana let up for a fraction
  of a second to see what the new danger might be. He seized her by the tail
  then and dragged her off before she could rush in to worry her fallen
  foe.</p>

  <p>Her turn again! Struggling to free herself, she dragged Ommony in a half-
  circle, nearly pulling him off his feet as the man in the doorway lunged with
  a long old-fashioned sword. The third man seemed to prefer discretion, for he
  still lurked in the shadow, but the man with the sword came on, using both
  hands now and raising the sword above his head for a swipe that should finish
  the business.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to let Diana go. Ommony yelled "Guard!"
  again, and jumped for the saw-edged tulwar that had clattered away into the
  shadow. His foot struck it and he stooped for it as the swordsman swung. The
  blow missed. Diana seized the foe from behind and ripped away yards of his
  long cloak. Dawa Tsering struggled to his feet, more stunned by the blow on
  the back of his head when he fell than mangled by Diana's jaws; he staggered
  and seemed to have no sense of direction yet.</p>

  <p>And now Ommony had the tulwar. He was no swordsman, but neither was his
  antagonist, who was furthermore worried by Diana from the rear.</p>

  <p>"Guard, girl!" Ommony yelled at her, and discipline overcame instinct. She
  began to keep her distance, rushing in to scare the man and scooting out of
  reach when he turned to use his weapon. The third man possibly had no sword,
  for he still lurked in the doorway. Ommony ran, calling Diana, who came
  bounding after him, turning at every third stride or so to bark thunderous
  defiance.</p>

  <p>The strange thing was that no crowd had come. The walls had echoed Diana's
  barks and Ommony's sharp yells to her, that must have sounded like the din of
  battle in the stone-walled silence. It was almost pitch-dark now, and there
  were no lights from the upper windows, although the glow of street-lights was
  already visible like an aura against the sly. The whole affair began to seem
  like a dream, and Ommony felt his hip pocket to make sure the jade was still
  there. He paused in the throat of the narrow passage by which he had come,
  sent the hound in ahead of him, and turned to see if he was followed. He
  heard footsteps, and waited. In that narrow space, with Diana to guard his
  back, he felt he could protect himself with the tulwar against
  all-comers.</p>

  <p>But it was only one man&mdash;Dawa Tsering&mdash;holding a cloth to his
  throat and walking unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"Give me back my weapon, Ommonee!"</p>

  <p>The words, spoken in Prakrit, were intelligible enough but gurgled, as if
  his throat was choked and hardly functioning. Diana tried to rush at him, but
  Ommony squeezed her to the wall and grabbed her collar.</p>

  <p>"Down!" he ordered, and she crouched at his feet, growling.</p>

  <p>"Aye, hold her! I have had enough of that incarnated devil. Give me my
  knife, Ommonee!"</p>

  <p>"You call this butcher's ax a knife! You rascal, it's not a minute since
  you tried to kill me with it!"</p>

  <p>"Aye, but that is nothing. I missed. If you were dead, you might complain.
  Give me the knife and be off!"</p>

  <p>Ommony laughed. "You propose to have another crack at me, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Not I! Those Lamas area lousy gang! They told me I could come to no harm
  if I obeyed them and said my prayers! Their magic is useless. That she-devil
  of thine has torn my throat out! I doubt if I shall ever sing again. Give me
  the knife, and I will go back to the Hills. I wish I had never left
  Spiti!"</p>

  <p>"I told you I am a friend," said Ommony, spearing about in his mind for a
  clue as to how to carry on.</p>

  <p>"Aye. I wish I had believed you. Give me the knife."</p>

  <p>"Do you know your way around Delhi?"</p>

  <p>"No. May devils befoul the city! That is, I know a little. I can find my
  way to the te-rain."</p>

  <p>Ommony felt in his pocket, found an envelope, and penciled an address on
  it in bold printed characters.</p>

  <p>"Midway between ten and eleven o'clock tonight, go out into the streets
  and get into the first gharry* you meet.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>gharry</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a horse-drawn cab or
  carriage.]</p>

  <p>Give that to the driver. If the driver can't read it, show it to
  passers-by until you find someone who can. Then drive straight to that
  address, and I will pay the gharry-wallah.* If your throat needs doctoring,
  it shall have it."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>gharry-wallah</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a cab-driver]</p>

  <p>"And my knife?"</p>

  <p>"I will return it to you tonight, at that address."</p>

  <p>"All right. I will come there."</p>

  <p>"I suppose, if I had given you the knife back now, you would have killed
  me with it!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe. But you are no fool, Ommonee! You had better go quickly, before
  those Lamas find some way of making trouble for you."</p>

  <p>Ommony accepted that advice, although he did not believe that, if they
  really were Lamas, they would go out of their way to make trouble for anyone
  outside their own country. It is one thing to attack an intruder; quite
  another thing to follow a man through the streets and murder him. He was glad
  he had hurt nobody. Dawa Tsering's hurt was plainly not serious. There is no
  satisfaction whatever in violence (if it can possibly be avoided) to a man of
  Ommony's temperament. He walked in a hurry along the narrow, winding
  passageways and found the street again, bought food for Diana, gave her the
  package to carry (for she was temperamentally dangerous in a crowd after
  having used her jaws in action, unless given something definite to do), and
  after fifteen minutes' search found a gharry, in which he drove to McGregor's
  office. McGregor was not there, so he pursued him to his bungalow, where he
  fed Diana and examined curios for fifteen minutes before deciding what to
  say.</p>

  <p>McGregor understood that perfectly. He might not know Ommony as he knew
  files, the law of probabilities, and criminal statistics; he might, from deep
  experience, mistrust his own opinion; but he did know that when Ommony poked
  around in that way, picking up things and replacing them, it was wise to wait
  and not ask questions. He smoked and watched his servant putting studs into a
  clean dress-shirt.</p>

  <p>"Have you one man you can absolutely bet on, who could take a package to
  Tilgaun and could be trusted not to monkey with it on the way, or lose it, or
  let it get stolen?" he asked at last.</p>

  <p>"Number 17&mdash;Aaron Macauley, the Eurasian, is leaving for Simla on
  tonight's train. He would probably want to spend a day or two in Simla, but
  he could go on to Tilgaun after that. He's quite dependable."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I'd trust Aaron Macauley. I want a small box, stout paper, string
  and sealing-wax."</p>

  <p>McGregor produced them and watched Ommony wrap up the piece of jade and
  seal it with his own old-fashioned signet-ring. He addressed the package to
  Miss Hannah Sanburn at the Tilgaun Mission.</p>

  <p>"Better tell Macauley it contains bank-notes," said Ommony. "That'll give
  him a sense of importance and keep him from being too curious. Tell him to
  ask Miss Sanburn to keep the package there for me until I come."</p>

  <p>"All right. Now what's the theory?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much. I was attacked just now&mdash;not serious. The man who got
  the worst of it will join us after dinner. I'll give you all the grizzly
  details then. Might possibly surprise you. See you again at Mrs. Cornock-
  Campbell's."</p>

  <p>"Who is a fountain of surprises," said McGregor, smiling. "Meanwhile, how
  about protection? Do you want a body-guard?" It was not exactly clear why he
  was smiling.</p>

  <p>"No," said Ommony, looking contemplatively at Diana, who appeared to have
  fallen asleep on a Bukhara rug, "I've got a more than usually good one,
  thanks. Observe."</p>

  <p>He started on tiptoe for the door. Diana reached it several strides ahead
  of him and slipped out first, to sniff the wind and make sure that the
  shadows held no lurking enemy.</p>

  <p>"If men were as faithful as dogs," he began. But McGregor laughed:</p>

  <p>"They're not. Faith, very largely, is absence of intelligence.
  Intelligence has to be trained to be honest; it has no morals otherwise.
  Without a good Scots grounding in religion, the greater the intelligence the
  worse the crook."</p>

  <p>"Oh, rot!" said Ommony, and walked out, leaving McGregor chuckling.</p>

  Lancer regiment&mdash;even if your children have to go to Europe to be
  schooled, and your husband is under canvas half the time. And there are much
  worse fates than dining with Mrs. Cornock-Campbell, anywhere, in any
  circumstances. To be in a position to invite yourself to dinner at her Delhi
  bungalow means that, whatever your occupation, you may view life now and then
  from the summit, looking downward. Viceroys come and go. Mrs.
  Cornock-Campbell usually educates their wives.</p>

  <p>They say she knows everything&mdash;even why the German Crown Prince once
  cut short a tour of India; and that, of course, means she is no longer in the
  bloom of youth, and never indiscreet, for you don't learn state secrets by
  being young and talkative.</p>

  <p>Ommony is one of her pet cronies, though they rarely meet (which is the
  way things happen in India). He looks such a blunt old-fashioned bachelor in
  a dinner-jacket dating from away before the war, the contrast he creates with
  modern artificial cynicism is so satisfying, and he so utterly lacks pose or
  pretense, that he brings out all her vivacity (which is apt to be chilled
  when imitation people assume manners for the sake of meals).</p>

  <p>The talk, for the hour while dinner lasted, was of anything in the world
  but Ringding Lamas and the Ahbor country. Ommony was probed for epigrams,
  coined in the depths of his forest, that should make John McGregor wince and
  laugh&mdash;such statements as that "You can look for faults or virtue.
  Vultures prefer ullage. Suit yourself. A man sees his own vices and his own
  virtues reflected in his neighbor&mdash;nothing else! Another's crimes are
  what you yourself would commit under equally strong pressure. His virtues are
  greater than your own, if only because they're less obvious. The most
  indecent exhibition in the world is virtue without her cloak on!" Not polite
  exactly, (particularly not to the chief of the Secret Service), but not
  tainted by circumlocution. And again: "They say the fact that people work
  entitles them to vote. Horses work harder than men! Soap-box nonsense! The
  only excuse for work is that you like it, and the only honest objection to
  loafing is that it's bad for you."</p>

  <p>John McGregor, in the rare hours when he is not feeling the pulse of
  India's restless underworld, is an addict of the Wee Free Kirk with
  convictions regarding the devil.</p>

  <p>"A personal devil?" said Ommony. "I wish there was one! Hell breeds more
  dangerous stuff than that! If I thought there was a devil, I'd vote for him.
  He'd clean up politics."</p>

  <p>John McGregor, ganglion of India's crime statistics and acquainted with
  all evil at first hand, was shocked, to Mrs. Cornock-Campbell's huge
  delight.</p>

  <p>"Now, John! What have you to say to that?"</p>

  <p>McGregor cracked a nut nervously and sipped at his Madeira.</p>

  <p>"He could find a host of half-baked theorists to praise him for the
  blasphemy," he said deliberately, "but the ultimate appalling circumstance of
  being damned is a high price for applause."</p>

  <p>Ommony laughed. "I'd rather be thought damned by a man I respect than be
  praised by damned fools," he retorted. "We three will meet beyond the border,
  Mae. I'm looking forward to it. I can't see anything unpleasant in death,
  except the morbid business of dying. 'May there be no moaning at the bar when
  I put out to sea.' It looks as if I might be the first of the three of us to
  take that trip."</p>

  <p>So, by a roundabout route, the conversation drifted to its goal. Over her
  shoulder, at the piano, in the rose and ivory music-room after dinner Mrs.
  Cornock-Campbell tossed the question that brought secrets to the surface.
  "John says you are going to the Ahbor country."</p>

  <p>John McGregor's eyes glowed with anticipation, but he crossed his legs and
  lit a cigarette, throwing himself back into the shadow of an antique chair to
  hide the smile.</p>

  <p>"Going to try," said Ommony. "My sister and Fred Terry disappeared up
  there twenty years ago. They left no trace."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>She went on playing from Chopin and Ommony did not notice the inflection
  of her voice; he was listening to the piano's overtones, vaguely displeased
  when she closed the piano without finishing the nocturne.</p>

  <p>"I was at Tilgaun seven months ago," she said. "Colin" (that was her
  husband) "had to go to Burma, so I went to Darjeeling. I heard of the
  Marmaduke Mission, and grew curious. I wrote, and Miss Sanburn kindly invited
  me to come and stay with her. The most delightful place. Please pass me a
  cigarette."</p>

  <p>"Did Hannah mention me?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Indeed she did. You seem to be her beau ideal; and funnily enough she
  said you, and the Lama Tsiang Samdup must have been twin brothers in a former
  incarnation! She told me you and he have never met each other, although you
  are co-trustees with her under Marmaduke's will. It sounds like Gilbert and
  Sullivan. I didn't see the Lama, but I did meet someone else who is quite as
  interesting."</p>

  <p>McGregor crossed his legs and blew smoke at the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"How well do you know Miss Sanburn?" asked Mrs. Cornock-Campbell at the
  end of a minute's silence. She was watching Diana, stretched out on the
  bearskin, hunting gloriously in a dream-Valhalla. If she saw Ommony's face it
  was through the corner of one eye.</p>

  <p>"Oh, as well as a man can ever hope to know a very unusual woman," said
  Ommony.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't go deep&mdash;does it! I admit I suspected you at first.
  Then I remembered how long I have known you and&mdash;well&mdash;you're
  unorthodox, and you're a rebel, but&mdash;I couldn't imagine you leaving a
  child nameless."</p>

  <p>"What on earth do you mean?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"So I suspected Marmaduke&mdash;naturally. But all sorts of dates and
  circumstances turned up quite casually, which eliminated him.I was at Tilgaun
  a whole month before I was quite sure that Miss Sanburn is not a mother. I
  was almost disappointed! She is such a dear&mdash;I admire her so much
  &mdash;that it would have given me a selfish satisfaction to know such an
  abysmal secret, and to keep it even on a deathbed! However, the child is not
  hers. She calls her an adopted daughter, though I doubt that there are any
  legal papers. The girl is white. She's about twenty. The strangest part is
  this: that the girl disappears at intervals."</p>

  <p>"This is all news to me," said Ommony. "Mac said something, but&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"It isn't news you iconoclast! It's a most romantic mystery. The girl was
  there when I arrived. She wouldn't have been; but you know what a business it
  is to get to Tilgaun. I was supposed to wait for ponies and servants from the
  mission; they didn't come, and as there was a party of rajah's people going,
  I traveled with them. They were in a hurry, so I reached the mission quite a
  number of days before I was expected, and I met the girl on the far side of
  the rope bridge just before you reach Tilgaun&mdash;you remember the place?
  There's a low steep cliff with only a narrow passage leading out of it. She
  was sitting there nursing a twisted ankle&mdash;nothing serious&mdash;but she
  couldn't get away without my seeing her; and of course it never entered my
  head to suspect that she would want to avoid me. She told me her name was
  Elsa."</p>

  <p>"That was my sister's name," remarked Ommony, who had an old-fashioned way
  of growing sentimental when that name cropped up among intimates.</p>

  <p>"I lent her a spare pony and she rode up to the mission with me. Jolly
  &mdash;she was the jolliest girl I have ever seen, all laughter and
  intelligence&mdash;with strange sudden fits of demureness&mdash;or perhaps
  that isn't the right word. Freeze isn't the right word either. She would
  suddenly lapse into silence and her face would grow absolutely calm
  &mdash;not expressionless, but calm&mdash;like a Chinese girl's. It was as if
  she were two distinct and separate women. But she's white. I watched her
  finger-nails."</p>

  <p>"Might be Chinese," Ommony suggested. "They're given to laughter, and
  their finger-nails don't show the dark lunula when they're pressed. Hannah
  Sanburn receives all comers at the mission."</p>

  <p>"I am certain she is English," Mrs. Cornock-Campbell answered. "But as far
  as I could judge she speaks Tibetan and several dialects perfectly. Her
  English hasn't a trace of Chi-chi accent. She has been wonderfully educated.
  She has art in every fiber of her being&mdash;plays the piano fairly well
  &mdash;mostly her own compositions, and you may believe me or not, they're
  fit to be played by a master. And she draws perfectly, from memory. That
  night at supper, and afterward, she talked incessantly and kept on
  illustrating what she meant by drawing on sheets of paper&mdash;wonderful
  things&mdash;not caricatures&mdash;snap-shots of people and things she had
  seen. Wait; I've kept some of them. Let me show you."</p>

  <p>She found a portfolio and laid it on Ommony's lap. He turned over sheet
  after sheet of pencil drawings that seemed to have caught motion in the act
  &mdash;yaks, camels, oxen, Tibetan men and women taken in mid-smile, old
  monastery doorways, flowers&mdash;done swiftly and with humor. There was a
  sureness of touch that men work lifetimes to achieve; and there was a quality
  that almost nobody in this age has achieved&mdash;a sort of spirit of
  antiquity, as simple as it was indefinable in words. It was as if the artist
  knew that things are never what they seem, but was translating what she saw
  of things' origins into modern terms that could be understood. The drawings
  were of yesterday, clothed in the garments of today and looking forward to
  tomorrow.</p>

  <p>"She seemed to see right through you," Mrs. Cornock-Campbell went on. "I
  don't believe the smartest man in the world could fool that girl. She has the
  something within that men instinctively recognize and don't try to take
  liberties with. She seemed equally familiar with Tibetan and European
  thought, as well as life, and to know all the country to the northward. I
  gathered she had been to Lhasa, which seems incredible, but she spoke of it
  as if she knew the very street-stones, and you'll see there are sketches of
  bits of Lhasa in that portfolio&mdash;notice the portrait of the Dalai-Lama
  and the sketch of the southern gate.</p>

  <p>"And all the while the girl talked Miss Sanburn seemed as proud and as
  uncomfortable as a martyr at the stake! When Elsa began to talk of Lhasa I
  thought Miss Sanburn would burst with anxiety; you could see she was on the
  perpetual point of cautioning her not to be indiscreet, but she restrained
  herself with a forced smile that made me simply love her. I know Miss Sanburn
  was in agonies of terror all the time.</p>

  <p>"When Elsa had gone to bed&mdash;that was long after midnight&mdash;I
  asked Miss Sanburn what her surname was. She hesitated for about thirty
  seconds, looking at me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know how she looked," said Ommony. "Like a fighting-man with a
  heartache. That look has often puzzled me. What did she say?"</p>

  <p>"She said: 'Mrs. Cornock-Campbell, it was not intended you should meet
  Elsa. She is my adopted daughter. There are reasons&mdash;' And of course at
  that I interrupted. I assured her I don't pry into people's secrets. She
  asked me whether I would mind not discussing what little I already knew. She
  said: 'I'm sorry I can't explain, but it is important that Elsa's very
  existence should be known to as few people as possible, especially in India.'
  Of course, I promised, but she agreed to a reservation that I might mention
  having met the girl, if anything I could say should seem likely to quiet
  inquisitive people. And that was a good thing, because I had no sooner
  returned to Delhi than John McGregor came to dinner and asked me pointedly
  whether I had seen any mysterious young woman at Tilgaun. I think John
  intended to investigate her with his staff of experts in&mdash;what is the
  right word, John?"</p>

  <p>"Worm's-eye views," said McGregor. "Not all the king's horses nor all the
  king's men could have called me off, as you did with a smile and a glass of
  Madeira. Thus are governments corrupted."</p>

  <p>"So you're the second individual to whom I have opened my lips about it,"
  said Mrs. Cornock-Campbell, not exactly watching Ommony, but missing none of
  his expression, which was of dawning comprehension.</p>

  <p>"I'm beginning to understand about a hundred things," he said musingly.
  "You'd think, though, Hannah would have told me."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Cornock-Campbell smiled at John McGregor. "Didn't you know he'd say
  just that! Wake up, Cottswold! This isn't church! It's because you're her
  closest friend that you're the last person in the world she would tell. She's
  a woman!"</p>

  <p>Then there were noises in the garden and Diana left off dreaming on the
  bearskin to growl like an earthquake.</p>

  <p>"An acquaintance of mine," said Ommony. "If you can endure the smell,
  please let him in. Or we might try the veranda."</p>

  <p>Diana had to be forcibly suppressed. The butler, a Goanese (which means
  that he had oddly assorted fears, as well as a mixed ancestry and cross-bred
  notions of convention, that were skin-deep and as hard as onyx) had to be
  rebuked for near-rebellion. And Dawa Tsering, with his neck swathed in
  weirdly-smelling cloth, had to be given a mat to sit on, lest he spoil the
  carpet. It needed that setting to make plain how innocent of cleanliness his
  clothes were; and his reek was of underground donkey-stables, with some sort
  of chemical added. (There were reasons, connected with possible
  eavesdroppers, why the deep veranda was unsuitable.)</p>

  <p>"And the knife, Ommonee?" he asked, squatting cross-legged, admiring the
  room. "Is this thy house? Thou art a rich man! I think I will be thy servant
  for a while. Is the woman thy wife? It is not good to be a woman's servant.
  Besides, I am a poor hand at obedience. Nay, return me my knife and I will
  go."</p>

  <p>"Not yet," said Ommony, studying by which roundabout route it might be
  easiest to elicit information. He decided on the sympathetic-personal. The
  man's neck had plainly received attention, but the subject served. "Shall I
  get a doctor for your neck?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, Tsiang Samdup made magic and put leeches on it and some stuff that
  burned. Lo, I recover."</p>

  <p>"You mean the holy Lama Tsiang Samdup? The Ringding Gelong Lama? He who
  was at Chutter Chand's this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>Ommony knew quite well whom he meant, but he wanted to convey the
  information to the others without putting the Hillman on guard. By the look
  in the Hillman's eye, his mood was talkative&mdash;boastful&mdash;a reaction
  from the failure of the afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Aye, the same."</p>

  <p>"I should have thought his chela would have attended to that."</p>

  <p>"Samding! Nay, they say that fellow is too sacred altogether. Not that I
  believe it; I could cut his throat and show them he dies gurgling and
  whistling like any other man! But the Lama looks after him like an old wife
  with a young husband and the boy mayn't soil his fingers. Rebuke thy dog,
  Ommonee&mdash;she eyes me like a devil in the dark. So, that is better. Ohe
  &mdash;I wish I had never come southward! Yet, I have seen this house of
  thine. It is a wonder. It will serve to speak of, when I go back to Spiti and
  tell tales around the fire."</p>

  <p>Ommony translated for the others' benefit, and went on questioning.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you will return to Tilgaun with the Lama and his chela?"</p>

  <p>"May the stars and my karma forbid! I go under the belly of a te-rain, as
  I came. To Kalka I go; and thence by foot on the old road to Simla, where I
  know a man who will pay me to carry goods to the rajah of Spiti. That is a
  long journey and a difficult. I shall be well paid."</p>

  <p>Again Ommony translated.</p>

  <p>"Ask him how and where he learned that trick of riding under trains," said
  McGregor.</p>

  <p>"Oh, as to that," said Dawa Tsering, "there are few things simpler. In my
  youth" (he spoke as if he were already ancient, instead of perhaps two-or
  three-and-twenty) "I desired a woman of Spiti whose husband was unwise. He
  should have gone on a journey oftener. And he should not have returned in
  such haste. I wearied of his homecomings, so I lay in wait and slew him. And
  the rajah of Spiti, who is a jealous man&mdash;liking to attend to all the
  slaying in that country, which is nevertheless too much for one individual,
  even if he does have an army of fifty men&mdash;fined me three hundred
  rupees.* Where should I get such a fortune? Yet, unless I paid it, I should
  have to join his army and gather fuel, which is as scarce in Spiti as an
  honest woman. So I ran away. And after wandering about the Hills a month or
  two, enjoying this and that adventure, I reached Simla, where I met a man
  with whom I gambled, he offering to teach me a new game, not knowing we use
  dice in Spiti. And his dice were loaded. So I substituted mine. And when I
  had won from him more than he could pay, he offered to teach me his
  profession."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>rupee</i> (Sanksrit: "silver")&mdash;the common
  name for the currencies used in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Mauritius,
  and the Seychelles... The Pakistani rupee and the Indian rupee are subdivided
  into one hundred paise or pice (singular paisa). <i>Wikipedia</i>.]</p>

  <p>"Gambling?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Nay. I never gamble. I take no chances. I do the gods a favor now and
  then, since it seems from all accounts they need it, but I never trust them.
  That fellow told me of the te-rains that run from Kalka southward, to and
  fro, and of the many rupees that the passengers leave in their pockets while
  they sleep. He supposed I would undertake the dangerous part and thereafter
  share the loot with him, and he showed me how to hide under a te-rain until
  nightfall and then&mdash;but it was easy. And I found out after a while where
  he hid the half of our profits, which he claimed as his share after I had
  done all the climbing in and out of windows in the dark. So I took what he
  had hidden, and, what with my own savings, the total amounted to more than a
  thousand rupees. Then I returned to Spiti, and I buried the money in a
  certain place, and went to the rajah and lied to him, saying I had earned the
  amount of the fine as a wood-cutter but that a certain one (who was always my
  enemy) had stolen the money from me on the very first night that I returned.
  So the rajah transferred my fine to that other man, who had to pay it, and
  then, of course, I had to leave Spiti again&mdash;swiftly. That other man has
  many friends. But I will find a way to deal with him."</p>

  <p>"When did you first meet the holy Lama Tsiang Samdup?" Ommony asked.</p>

  <p>"Hah! I returned to the te-rains, being minded to make a fortune, but the
  gods played a scurvy trick on me. I was doing nicely; but on a certain night
  a fool of a policeman pounced on me at an istashun* just as I was crawling in
  under the wheels.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>istashun</i> (corrupted English)&mdash;a railway
  station.]</p>

  <p>He dragged me out by the leg, and it was not a proper time to kill him,
  since there were many witnesses. So I raised a lamentation, saying I would
  ride to Delhi to the bedside of a friend, and that I had no fare. And lo, the
  Lama Tsiang Samdup stepped out of the te-rain and paid my fare, praying that
  I would permit him thus to acquire merit. So I rode with him to Delhi, he
  questioning me all the night-long and I at my wits' end to invent sufficient
  lies wherewith to answer him. And in Delhi I being a stranger in the city, he
  set out with me to help me find my friend; and, there being no friend, we
  naturally did not find him, whereat the Lama wept. So it seemed to me he was
  a man who needed someone to look after him; moreover, he was certainly a very
  rich man. And I had not yet thought of a way of defeating my enemy in Spiti.
  Restrain thy she-dog, Ommonee; I like not the look in her eye."</p>

  <p>Ommony put Diana outside with orders to guard the front door.</p>

  <p>"How long ago did this happen?" he asked, forcing himself to look only
  vaguely interested as he resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"Oh, maybe a year ago&mdash;or longer. The time passes. I agreed to serve
  the Lama for a while, although he wearied me with his everlasting lectures
  about merit, and the Wheel, and the gods know what else. Also he keeps low
  company&mdash;actors and singers and such folk. When he left me at Tilgaun on
  his way northward I was well content to rest from him a while. He gave me
  money, of which he has plenty although he is much too careful with it; and
  there were good-looking girls at the mission, which is a marvel of a place
  with a high wall. But I saw how to climb the wall. So it came about that
  there was trouble between me and Missish-Anbun&mdash;she who is Abbess of the
  place&mdash;a bold woman, who was not afraid to stand up to me and speak her
  mind. Lo, I showed her my knife and she laughed at it! I speak truth. So by
  the time the Lama came back from the North I was a by-word and a mockery
  among the people of Tilgaun, who are a despicable lot but prosperous, and
  full of a notion that Missish-Anbun is the cause of all good fortune. And
  she, of course, being a woman and unmarried (which is witchcraft) told tales
  to the Lama about me when he returned; whereat he (the old fool!) was
  distressed, saying he was answerable, in that he had left me there during his
  absence. He spoke much about the Wheel, and merit, and responsibility. And I,
  who cannot help liking the old fool, although I laugh at him&mdash;and at
  myself for eating rebuke from him&mdash;was ashamed. Aye, I was ashamed. He
  made me promise to perform acts of repentance&mdash;as he said, to offset my
  own sins&mdash;but as I think, because he had a use for me.</p>

  <p>"And now he had Sam-ding with him, the chela, whom all men in that part
  regard as a reincarnation of some ancient prodigy who has been dead so long
  that his bones must have dissolved into powder. (But the priests tell just
  such tales, and who can say they are not true?)</p>

  <p>"And there was much excitement over a piece of green stone. It had
  disappeared from somewhere up North, although none mentioned the name of the
  place whence it had come, but I had heard something, and the rest I saw.
  There had come a man from Ahbor to the mission, dying of a belly-wound, and
  if my advice had been asked he would have been left to die outside the wall,
  because those Ahbors are devils. I have heard they eat corpses, which is a
  dog's business, and I know none dares to enter their country. But
  Missish-Anbun is mad, and she took him into the mission, where they stitched
  up the belly-wound and tried to make him live. But he died, and they found
  the stone in his clothing, and Missish-Anbun kept it. There was much talk
  about the stone, for the most part nonsense; some said this, and some said
  that, but it was clear enough that whoever really owned the stone had set
  inquiries going and a rumor had been spread that there was danger in
  possessing it.</p>

  <p>"I had made up my mind to steal the stone from Missish-Anbun and discover
  how much it might be worth to a man of some skill in bargaining; for it
  seemed to me there could not be much danger to me as long as I had my knife.
  &mdash;Where is my knife, Ommonee? Presently? Well, don't forget to return it
  to me. That knife and my future are one.</p>

  <p>"As I was saying, I was about to steal the stone. But a girl in the
  mission&mdash;one whose virtue I had satisfactory reason to suspect&mdash;
  forestalled me. She took the stone and ran with it toward the house of Sirdar
  Sirohe Singh, who is a prince of devils, and a father of lice, and no good.
  (He had warned me to leave Tilgaun, and I had told him who his father
  was.)</p>

  <p>"And there had come a rat of a man named Tin Lal to Tilgaun, too much
  given to asking questions. Him I was minded to slay, because that girl, whose
  virtue I say was not such as others seemed to think, no longer smiled at me
  when I sat in the sun near the mission gate, but took more notice of Tin Lal
  than was seemly. Night after night I had waited for her, and it came to my
  ears too late that there was a reason, that concerned me, for the smile in
  Tin Lal's impudent eye. I whetted the edge of my knife on a stone by the
  image of the Lord Buddha that is set into a niche in the mission wall.</p>

  <p>"But the girl stole the stone and ran off with it, and Tin Lal waited for
  her at a narrow place where the path to the sirdar's house runs between a
  cliff on the one hand and a deep ravine on the other&mdash;a place where the
  eagles nest and there is mist ascending from the waterfall below. He pushed
  her into the ravine and climbed down after her, taking the stone. And then he
  disappeared. And Sirdar Sirohe Singh, who is a dog&mdash;whose liver is
  crawling lice&mdash;whose heart is a dead fish, accused me of the deed. There
  was talk of bringing me before the rajah, and there was other talk of driving
  me away.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, I had promised the Lama I would wait for him in Tilgaun. I
  was not minded that my time had come. Moreover, I am one who keeps promises.
  So I slew the loudest talkers&mdash;very secretly, by night; and after that
  there was not so much insolence toward me when I passed up and down the
  village.</p>

  <p>"Ohe&mdash;but I was weary of Tilgaun! And when the Lama came he at first
  believed I had slain the girl and stolen the stone. But he is not entirely a
  fool in all respects, and the chela Samding has more brains than a grown man
  with a beard down to his belly. It was the chela who said that if I had in
  truth stolen the stone I would certainly have run away with it and not have
  stayed in Tilgaun like an eagle hatching eggs. And the Lama, having listened
  to a million lies and discovered the truth like a bird in the mist among
  them, told me I might earn much merit by following the trail of Tin Lal to
  the southward and recovering the stone. The Lama Tsiang Samdup said to me,
  'Slay not, but obtain the stone from Tin Lal and I will pay thee more for it
  than any other dozen men would pay.' And he named a price&mdash;a very great
  price, which set me to dreaming of the girls in Spiti, and of a valley where
  I am minded someday to build a house.</p>

  <p>"So I, having furthermore a grudge of my own against Tin Lal, agreed, and
  I followed the rat Tin Lal to Delhi, where, as I have told you, I saw him,
  through the shop-window where the snake is, sell the stone to Chutter Chand,
  the jeweler.</p>

  <p>"But the Lama and Samding had come to Delhi likewise, and to them I told
  what I had seen, having lost sight of Tin Lal in the crowd. And now give me
  back the knife, Ommonee, that I may hunt for Tin Lal. I have an extra grudge
  against him. Has he not robbed me of the price the Lama would have paid me
  for the stone? Ohe&mdash;my honor and my anger and his end are one! Give me
  the knife, Ommonee."</p>

  <p>The Hillman smiled winningly, as one who has talked his way into a hard
  man's heart. He held his hand out, leaning forward as he squatted on the
  mat.</p>

  <p>"Tin Lal is in the jail," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Oh, is that so? That makes it easy. I will wait outside the jail. They
  will not keep him in there forever."</p>

  <p>"What is that house, where you tried to kill me this afternoon?" Ommony
  asked.</p>

  <p>"A place kept by Tibetans, where the Lama stays when in Delhi. That is
  where the actor people come to see him."</p>

  <p>"Why did you attack me?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? You had said, the Lama shall have the stone. Therefore it was
  clear to me that you must have it. Therefore, if I should take it from you I
  could sell it to the Lama. I am no fool!"</p>

  <p>Ommony, with something like contentment in his eye, began to translate for
  the benefit of the others as much as he could remember of Dawa Tsering's
  tale, tossing occasional questions to the Hillman to get him to repeat some
  detail. It was the company the Lama kept that seemed to interest him
  most.</p>

  <p>"If you like," said McGregor, when the tale was finished, "I'll have those
  Tibetans searched."</p>

  <p>Ommony was about to refuse that offer, but his words were cut short by an
  uproar on the porch. Diana&mdash;on guard and therefore unable to be tempted
  from her post&mdash;was barking like a battery of six-pounders. He strode
  into the hall and listened&mdash;heard retreating footsteps&mdash; someone in
  no hurry pad-pad-padding firmly on soft-soled shoes toward the garden
  gate.</p>

  <p>He opened the door. Diana glanced angrily at a long, narrow, white
  envelope that lay on the porch floor under the electric light, and resumed
  her furious salvoes at the gate.</p>

  <p>"So-ho, old lady&mdash;someone you knew brought a letter, eh? You weren't
  indignant till he threw it down and retreated. You never said a word while he
  was coming up the path." He wetted his finger and tested the hot night air.
  "Uh-huh&mdash;wind's toward you&mdash;recognized his smell &mdash;that's
  clear enough. All right&mdash;good dog&mdash;on guard again."</p>

  <p>He picked up the envelope and walked into the house. "Did you tell the
  Lama where you were coming tonight?" he asked, standing over Dawa Tsering,
  looking down at him.</p>

  <p>"Aye. I did. Why not? How should I know, Ommonee, that this was not a
  trap&mdash;and I with no knife to hack my way out of it! Suppose that you had
  thrown me in the jail&mdash;who should then have helped me unless the Lama
  knew? I am no fool."</p>

  <p>"Did you tell him I said he shall have the green stone?"</p>

  <p>"Nay! How often must I say I am no fool! Would he buy the stone from me,
  after I had told him you said he shall have it?"</p>

  <p>"The letter! The letter!" exclaimed Mrs. Cornock-Campbell. "Are you made
  of iron, Cottswold? How can you hold a mysterious letter in your hand without
  dying to know what is in it? Give it to me! Let me open it, if you
  won't!"</p>

  <p>Ommony passed it to her. John McGregor lit another cigarette.</p>

  "Sarcasm? I wonder if that ever pays."</h2>

  <p class="quote">It is the teaching of financiers and statesmen, and of them
  who make laws, and of most religionists, that of all things a man should
  first seek safety&mdash;for his own skin&mdash;for his own money&mdash; for
  his own soul. Yet I find this teaching strange; because of all the dangers in
  the universe, the greatest lies in self-preferment.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THE letter was written on the same long, ivory-colored paper
  as that which had reached McGregor's office in the silver tube, but this time
  it was not European hand writing, although the words were English. Someone
  more used to a brush, such as the Chinese use, and who regarded every
  pen-stroke as a work of art in true relation to the whole; had taken a quill
  pen and almost painted what he had to say, in terse strong sentences.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"To Cottswold Ommony, Esquire,<br>
  "At the house of his friend.</p>

  <p class="letter">"May Destiny mete you full measure of mercy. The piece of
  jade is neither yours nor mine. By deeds in the valley of indecision a soul
  ascends or descends. You are one to whom reward is no inducement; to whom
  honor is no more than wealth a pleasing substitute for right doing. There is
  nothing done in this life that is not balanced by justice in the lives to
  come and the ultimate is peace. So do. And not by another's hand are deeds
  done; nor is the end accomplished without doing all that lies at the
  beginning. Thus the beginning is the end, and the end the beginning, as a
  circle having no beginning and no end, from which is no escape but by the
  Middle Way, which lies not yonder but at the feet of him who searches. Take
  the stone to Tilgaun, which is one stage of the journey to the place whence
  it came. From Tilgaun onward let those be responsible on whom the burden
  falls. There is danger in another's duty. Peace be with you. Peace give you
  peace that you may multiply it.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Tsiang Samdup."</p><br>

  <p>Mrs. Cornock-Campbell read the letter aloud. Not smiling, she passed it to
  Ommony and watched his face. He read it twice, frowning, and gave it to
  McGregor, who emitted his staccato, fox-bark laugh, which Diana heard and
  answered with one deep musical bay from the porch. "That links him
  technically-tight," said McGregor, folding the letter with decisive
  finger-strokes and stowing it into his pocket. "Where did he learn to write
  such English?"</p>

  <p>"Oxford," said Ommony. "He took D.D. and LL.D. Degrees, or so Marmaduke
  told me. We're not the only section of humanity that runs to Secret Service,
  Mac. We look for one thing, they for another. There isn't much they don't
  know about us, along the line that interests them."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Cornock-Campbell looked incredulous.</p>

  <p>"A Ringding Gelong Lama&mdash;an English Doctor of Divinity? Wonders don't
  cease, do they! What could he gain by taking that degree? Amusement? Are they
  as subtle as all that?"</p>

  <p>"Subtle, yes. Amusement, no," said Ommony, frowning darkly. "How spike the
  guns of the persistent missionary, unless they know how the guns are loaded?
  That's the gist of one of his letters to me. But damn the man! Why couldn't
  he meet me by appointment instead of writing this stuff? I've suspected him
  for some time of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Cornock-Campbell laughed. "He evidently knows you, Cottswold, better
  than you know him."</p>

  <p>"Know him? I've never met him!" Ommony retorted. "I saw him today for the
  first time, from behind a brass Buddha in Chutter Chand's shop. There've been
  lots of times when he ought to have met me, to talk over details in
  connection with the trusteeship, but it all had to be done by correspondence.
  He has set his signature to every paper I drew up, and he has agreed to every
  proposal I have made. Confound him! Why is he afraid of me? Why couldn't he
  come in, instead of leaving that fool letter on the door-step?"</p>

  <p>"Wise letter!" (Mrs. Cornock-Campbell went back to the piano. None but
  Rimsky-Korsakov could describe her sensations.) "He evidently knows how to
  manage you. Do you ever bet, John? I will bet you five rupees I know what's
  next!"</p>

  <p>John McGregor drew a five-rupee note from his pocket and laid it on the
  piano. Mrs. Cornock-Campbell began playing. Dawa Tsering, his head to one
  side like a bird's, watched her fingers, listening intently.</p>

  <p>"There are devils inside the machine," he said after a while. "Give me my
  knife, Ommonee, and let me go." But Ommony, pacing the floor, both hands
  behind him, frowning, took no notice of anyone. He was away off in a realm of
  conjecture of his own.</p>

  <p>"Remember: I stand to lose five dibs!" McGregor remarked at the end of
  five minutes. "Suppose you put me out of agony. I'm Scots, you know!"</p>

  <p>"Damn!" Ommony exclaimed. "Why can't he take me into his confidence? I
  hate to suspect a man. Pen and ink anywhere?"</p>

  <p>"I lose," said Mrs. Cornock-Campbell, nodding toward a gilt-and-ivory
  writing desk against the wall. "Take back your five rupees, John. You'll find
  a five of mine being used as a book-mark in one of those volumes of Walter
  Pater on the shelf. Put something in its place."</p>

  <p>McGregor paid himself. Ommony at the desk tore up sheet after sheet of
  paper, chuckled at last, and wrote a final draft. "There, that should do.
  That's obscure enough. That hoists him with his own petard. Why don't women
  ever have clean blotting-paper?"</p>

  <p>He showed what he had written to McGregor, who read it aloud, Mrs.
  Cornock-Campbell playing very softly while she listened.</p>

  <p>"To the holy Lama Tsiang Samdup, in the place where he has chosen to
  secrete himself.</p>

  <p>"I will take the Middle Way if I can find it, and I hope neither of us may
  get lost. I wish you all success.</p>

  <p>"Cottswold Ommony."</p>

  <p>"Sarcasm?" said Mrs. Cornock-Campbell. "I wonder if that ever pays."</p>

  <p>"We'll see!"</p>

  <p>Ommony sealed up the envelope, on which he had written simply "Tsiang
  Samdup," and stood over Dawa Tsering.</p>

  <p>"Take this letter to the Lama. Come back here with proof you have
  delivered it, and you shall have your knife."</p>

  <p>"Send him in my dog-cart," McGregor advised. "My sais* is one of those
  rare birds who do as they're told. He doesn't talk or ask questions."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>sais</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a coachman; a groom.]</p>

  <p>So Dawa Tsering was seen on to the back seat of the dog-cart, with a
  horse-blanket under him to keep grease off the cushion, and the conference
  was resumed. McGregor questioned Ommony narrowly concerning the events of the
  afternoon, and particularly as to the exact location of the courtyard where
  the attack had taken place.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't look to me as if they meant to kill you," he said at last. "It
  seems to me they were hell-bent on merely driving you away. Um-tiddley-um-
  tum-tum&mdash;we've made a mess of this&mdash;we should have had that
  building watched. Katherine, I will bet these ten rupees that our friend from
  Spiti draws blank."</p>

  <p>"Men are unintuitive creatures," Mrs. Cornock-Campbell answered. "No,
  John, I won't bet. The obvious thing was to take the Lama at his word and go
  straight to Tilgaun. I supposed Cottswold would see that, but he didn't
  &mdash;did you? What is the objection?"</p>

  <p>"This," said Ommony, pausing, looking obstinate, "he is either my friend,
  or he isn't. He has every reason to be frank with me. He has chosen the other
  line. All right."</p>

  <p>"All wrong!" she answered, chuckling. "In that letter, in his own way, he
  invited you to trust him."</p>

  <p>"I don't!" remarked Ommony, shutting his jaws with a snap that could be
  heard across the room.</p>

  <p>He refused to explain himself. He was not quite sure he could have done
  that, but had no inclination to try. If he had opened his lips it would have
  been to invite McGregor to throw a plain-clothes cordon around that house at
  the end of the courtyard, search the place and expose its secrets.</p>

  <p>Habitual self-control alone prevented that. Twenty years of living
  courteously in a conquered country, making full allowance for the feelings of
  those who must look to him for justice, had bred a restraint that ill-temper
  could not overthrow. But he did not dare to let himself speak just then. He
  preferred to be rude&mdash;took up a book and began reading.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Cornock-Campbell went on playing. John McGregor smoked in silence,
  pulling out the Lama's letter, reading it over and over, trying to discover
  hidden meanings. So more than an hour went by with hardly a word spoken, and
  it was long after midnight when the wheels of McGregor's returning dog-cart
  skidded on the loose gravel of the drive at the rear of the house and Diana
  awoke on the porch to tell the moon about it.</p>

  <p>Dawa Tsering was admitted through the back door and shepherded in by the
  butler, who held his nose, but who was not otherwise so lacking in
  appreciation as to shut the door tight when he left the room. Ommony strode
  to the door, opened it wide, looked into the frightened eyes of the Goanese
  and watched him until he disappeared through a swinging door at the end of
  the passage.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, shutting the door tight behind him.</p>

  <p>"The Lama is gone!" Dawa Tsering announced dramatically. "If I had had my
  knife I would have slain the impudent devil who gave me the news! Tripe out
  of the belly of a pig is his countenance! Eggs are his eyes! He is a
  ragyaba!"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>ragyabas</i> (Tibetan) are the lowest dregs of
  Tibetan society, who live on the outskirts of towns and dispose of the dead.
  When used, as in this case, as an epithet, the word has a significance too
  horrible to be translated. The man was, of course, not really a ragyaba.
  Mundy's footnote.]</p>

  <p>"The son of evil pretended not to know me! When I offered him the letter
  for the Lama he growled that Tsiang Samdup and his chela had gone elsewhere.
  When I bade him let me in, that I might see for myself, he answered
  ignorantly."</p>

  <p>"Ignorantly? How do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"He struck me with a bucket, of which the contents were garbage unsuitable
  to a man of my distinction. So I crowned him with the bucket&mdash;thus
  &mdash;not gently&mdash;and his head went through the bottom of the thing, so
  that, as it were, he wore a helmet full of smells and could no longer see. So
  then I smote him in the belly with my fist&mdash;thus&mdash;and with my
  foot&mdash;thus&mdash;as he fell. And then I came away. And there is the
  letter. Smell it. Behold the dirt on it, in proof I lie not. Now give me my
  knife, Ommonee."</p>

  <p>Ommony went into the hall and produced the "knife" from behind the hat-
  rack. Dawa Tsering thumbed the edge of the blade lovingly before thrusting
  the weapon into its leather scabbard inside his shirt.</p>

  <p>"Now I am a man again," he said devoutly. "They would better avoid me with
  their buckets full of filth!"</p>

  <p>Ommony studied him in silence for a moment. "Did you ever have a bath?" he
  asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Aye. Tsiang Samdup and his chela made me take one whenever they happened
  to think fit. That is how I know they are not especially holy. There is
  something heretical about them that I do not understand."</p>

  <p>"I am worse than they," said Ommony. "No doubt. They have their good
  points."</p>

  <p>"I have none! You must wash yourself as often as I tell you, and I shall
  give the order oftener than they did! From now on, you are my servant."</p>

  <p>"But who says so?"</p>

  <p>"I do."</p>

  <p>"You desire me?"</p>

  <p>"No, because I already have you. I can dispose of you as I see fit," said
  Ommony. "I can send you to the jail for killings and for train-robberies, and
  for trying to murder me this afternoon. Or I can bid you work out the score
  in other ways."</p>

  <p>"That is true, more or less. Yes, there is something in what you say,
  Ommonee."</p>

  <p>"It is not more or less true. It is quite true."</p>

  <p>"How so? Have I not my knife? Would you like to fight me? I can slay that
  she-dog of thine as easily as I can lay thy bowels on the floor."</p>

  <p>"No," said Ommony, "no honorable man could do that to his master. Are you
  not an honorable man?"</p>

  <p>"None more so!"</p>

  <p>"And I am your master, so that settles it."</p>

  <p>Dawa Tsering looked puzzled; there was something in the reasoning that
  escaped him. But it is what men do not understand that binds them to others'
  chariot wheels.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I do not wish to return to Spiti&mdash;yet," he said
  reflectively. "But about the bath&mdash;how often? Besides, it is contrary to
  my religion, now I come to think of it."</p>

  <p>"Change your religion, then. Now no more argument. Which way has the Lama
  gone?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, as to that&mdash;I suppose I could discover that. How much will you
  pay me?"</p>

  <p>"Thirty rupees a month, clean clothing, two blankets and your food."</p>

  <p>"That is almost no pay at all," said Dawa Tsering. "To make a profit at
  that rate, I should have to eat so much that my belly would be at risk of
  bursting. There is discomfort in so much eating."</p>

  <p>"They would give you enough to eat and no more, without money, in the
  jail," said Ommony, "and you would have to obey a babu, and be shaved by a
  contractor, and make mats without reward. And if you were very well behaved,
  they would let you rake the head jemadar's garden. Moreover, Tin Lal, who is
  also in the jail, would mock you at no risk to himself, since you would have
  no knife; and because he is clever and malignant he would constantly get you
  into trouble, laughing when you were punished. And since he is only in the
  jail for a short time, and you would be in for a long time, there would be no
  remedy. However, suit yourself."</p>

  <p>"You are a hard man, Ommonee!"</p>

  <p>"I am. I have warned you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well: I suppose it is better so. A soft knife is quickly dulled, and
  men are the same way. Yielding men are not dependable. Pay me a month's wages
  in advance, and tomorrow we will buy the blankets."</p>

  <p>But beginnings are beginnings. A foundation not well laid destroys the
  whole edifice.</p>

  <p>"From now on until I set you free, your desires are nothing," Ommony said
  sternly. "You consider my needs and my convenience. When I have time to
  consider yours, it will remain to be seen whether I forget or not. Go and
  wait on the porch. Try to make friends with the dog; she can teach you a lot
  you must learn in one way or another. If the dog permits you leisure for
  thought, try to imagine which way the Lama may have gone."</p>

  <p>Dawa Tsering went out through the hall, too impressed by the novelty of
  the situation even to mutter to himself. Ommony went to the window and said
  two or three words to Diana, whose long tail beat responsively on the teak
  boards. Presently came the sound of Dawa Tsering's voice:</p>

  <p>"O thou: my time has not come to be eaten.* Have wisdom!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Referring, of course, to the Tibetan custom of
  throwing out the dead to be devoured by dogs. Mundy's footnote.]</p>

  <p>A low rumbling growl announced that Diana was considering the situation,
  keeping Ommony's command in mind.</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt thou art a very evil devil!"</p>

  <p>Again the growl, followed by a thump and the shuffling sound of Dawa
  Tsering squatting himself on the porch.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;thus. We will see whether Ommonee knows what he is doing. Attack
  me, and die, thou mother of fangs and thunder! Then I will know it is not my
  karma to obey this Ommonee. Lie still, thou earthquake, and I will &mdash;"
  His voice dropped to a murmur and died away. Thoughts too obscure for
  expression seemed to have riveted his whole attention. Ommony, peering
  through the shutter slats, could see him sitting almost within arm's reach of
  the dog, staring straight in front of him at the stars on the north horizon.
  He turned to Mrs. Cornock-Campbell:</p>

  <p>"And now I'll go away and let you sleep. When we come to your house, Mac
  and I invariably forget manners and stay into the wee small hours&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>But at a sign from her he sat down again. She closed the piano and locked
  it. "Cottswold," she said, "tell me what you have in mind. You have said too
  much or too little."</p>

  <p>"I have told all I know&mdash;that is that I care to tell, even to you,"
  Ommony answered. "I suppose, as a matter of fact, I'm a bit piqued. That Lama
  has had scores of opportunities to realize that I wouldn't betray
  confidences. I am told I'm notorious for refusing to tell the government what
  I know about individuals; and the Lama is perfectly aware of that. I've
  risked my job fifty times by insisting on holding my tongue. Am I right,
  Mac?"</p>

  <p>"You are!" McGregor answered with a dry smile. "I remember, I once
  considered it my duty to advise threatening you with drastic penalties. I
  would have ordered you tortured, but for the cir-r-cumstance that that means
  of inducement is out of date. And besides, I had ma doots of its efficacy in
  your instance."</p>

  <p>Ommony grinned. He preferred that praise to all the orders in the almanac.
  "So, damn the Lama!" he went on fervently. "He has kept aloof for twenty
  years. I'm satisfied there's something he's deliberately keeping from me.
  I've no notion what it is, but that piece of jade is probably connected with
  it. I'm going to track him&mdash;tempt him&mdash;force his hand."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you've no notion what he's keeping from you?" Mrs. Cornock-
  Campbell asked; and Ommony stared hard at her, while McGregor blew smoke at
  the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I have a sort of notion&mdash;yes," he answered slowly.
  "Sometimes I suspect he knows what took Fred Terry and my sister to the Ahbor
  country."</p>

  <p>"And?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Cornock-Campbell studied him with dark blue eyes that seemed to
  search for something lacking in his mental make-up.</p>

  <p>"He may know what became of them."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Cornock-Campbell smiled and sighed. "Well&mdash;we three will meet
  again before you go, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Ommony. "I expect to be gone before daybreak. I'll write when I
  get the chance. If we don't meet again this side of Yama's* Bar&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Yama, Yum</i>&mdash;a Hindu god; the king of the
  infernal regions, corresponding to the Greek Pluto, and also the judge of
  departed souls. In later times he is more exclusively considered the dire
  judge of all, and the tormentor of the wicked. He is represented as of a
  green color, with red garments, having a crown on his head, his eyes
  inflamed, and sitting on a buffalo, with a club and noose in his hands.
  <i>Webster's 1913 Dictionary</i>.]</p>

  <p>"This is India&mdash;it might happen," she answered. "Your friendship has
  been one of five things that have made my life in India worth while."</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense," he said gruffly. The least trace of sentiment frightened
  him.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad I've helped," she went on. "It's a privilege to have friends
  like you and John McGregor, who don't imagine they're in love when you share
  their confidences! Good night. I don't believe you're going to your doom. I
  think I'd know it if you were."</p>

  <p>"Doom? There isn't any! There's only a reshuffling of the cards," said
  Ommony. "Good night."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br>
  The Middle Way</h2>

  <p class="quote">We live in the eternal Now, and it is Now that we create our
  destiny. It follows, that to grieve over the past is useless and to make
  plans for the future is a waste of time. There is only one ambition that is
  good, and that is: so to live Now that none may weary of life's emptiness and
  none may have to do the task we leave undone.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">NO MAN can learn any more of India in twenty years, or in
  any length of time, than he can learn about himself; and that is a mystery,
  but it is the door to understanding. And that is why men like Ommony and John
  McGregor, who have given to India the whole of their active lives, will say
  in good faith that they know very little about the country. It is also why
  they are guarded in their praise of viceroys, and candidly suspicious of all
  politicians; why they listen to the missionary with emotion not entirely
  disconnected from cold anger; and why, when they return to England in late
  life, ripened by experience, they do not become leaders of men. Knowing how
  easily and how often they have deceived others and themselves have been
  deceived, they do not dare to pose as prophets.</p>

  <p>However, there are naturally some things that they do know, guide-books,
  government reports and "experts" notwithstanding.</p>

  <p>They know (some of them) that news travels up and down India without the
  aid of wire, semaphore or radio, and faster than any mechanical means yet
  invented can imitate. It seems to travel almost with the speed of thought,
  but although it gets noised abroad none will ever tell which individual
  released it.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* There is the notorious instance of the news of Lord
  Roberts' relief of Kandahar reaching Bombay long before the government in
  Simla knew the facts. See Forty Years in India, by Lord Roberts. Mundy's
  footnote.]</p>

  <p>They also know that there are routes of travel, unconnected with the
  railway lines or trunk roads, not marked by recognizable signposts, and
  obscure to all who have not the key to them. Some of these routes are
  suspected to be religious in their origin and purpose; some are political,
  (and those are better understood). Some, they say, are survivals of forgotten
  periods of history when conquered people had to devise means of communication
  that could be kept absolutely secret from the conqueror.</p>

  <p>At any rate, the routes are there, and are innumerable, crossing one
  another like lines on the palm of a man's hand. A man with the proper
  credentials (and whatever those are, they are neither written nor carried on
  the person) can travel from end to end of India, not often at high speed, but
  always secretly; and the strange part is, that he may cross a hundred other
  routes as unknown to himself as the one he travels by is secret from other
  people.</p>

  <p>The routes are opened, closed and changed mysteriously. The men who use
  them seldom seem to know their exact detail in advance, and the fact that a
  man has traveled once by one of them (or even a dozen times) is no proof that
  he can return the same way. The underground route by which runaway slaves
  were smuggled from South to North before the Civil War in the United States
  is a crude and merely suggestive illustration of how the system works; and
  one thing is certain: these so-to-speak "underground" communications have
  nothing whatever to do with the ordinary pilgrim routes, although they may
  cross them at a thousand points. Like eternity, they seem to have neither
  beginning, end, nor relation to time; midnight is as high noon, and you cut
  into them at any time or point you please&mdash;provided that you know
  how.</p>

  <p>"Hotel, I supposes" said McGregor, tooling the dogcart along at a slow
  trot through the deserted streets. (They were deserted, that is, of apparent
  life, but there are always scores of eyes alert in India.)</p>

  <p>"No. Set me down in the Chandni Chowk. I'll tell you where to stop."</p>

  <p>"Man alive, you can't go scouting in a dinner jacket!"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Ommony asked obstinately.</p>

  <p>McGregor did not answer.</p>

  <p>Ommony spoke his mind in jerky sentences.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow morning&mdash;this morning, I mean, be a good chap&mdash; pack
  my things at the hotel&mdash;forward them all to Tilgaun. Send some one you
  can trust. Let him leave them with Miss Sanburn&mdash;bring back a receipt to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Money?" asked McGregor, nodding.</p>

  <p>"Plenty. If I need more I'll cash drafts on Chutter Chand."</p>

  <p>"What name will you sign on them? I'd better warn him, hadn't I?"</p>

  <p>"No need. I'll make a mark on the drafts that he'll recognize."</p>

  <p>"Going to take the dog with you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>McGregor smiled to himself. Ommony noticed it.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Mac, don't try to keep track of me."</p>

  <p>"Um-m-m!" remarked McGregor.</p>

  <p>Ommony's jaw came forward.</p>

  <p>"I might not know but they would, Mac. You can't keep a thing like that
  from them. They'd close the Middle Way against me."</p>

  <p>McGregor whistled softly. The Middle Way to Nirvana is no particular
  secret; anyone may read of it in any of a thousand, books, and he may tread
  that Path who dares to declare war on desire. But that is esoteric, and no
  concern of the Secret Service. Exoterically speaking, "The Middle Way" is a
  trail that for more than a century the Secret Service has desired to learn
  with all its inquisitive heart.</p>

  <p>"I mean it, Mac. All bets are off unless you promise."</p>

  <p>"You needn't betray confidences," said McGregor. "You're not responsible,
  if I keep tabs on you."</p>

  <p>"That's a naked lie, and you know it, Mac! I can get through, if I burn
  all bridges. I haven't learned what little I do know by letting you know what
  I was doing. You know that."</p>

  <p>"Um-m-m! If you're killed&mdash;or disappear?"</p>

  <p>"That's my look-out."</p>

  <p>"As a friend, you're all right. As an assistant, you're a disappointing,
  independent devil!" said McGregor. "You're as useful as a bellyache to open a
  can of corned beef with! All right. Dammit. Have your own way. Remember, I
  shall take you at your word. If you're ditched, there's no ambulance."</p>

  <p>"Splendid! Then here's where I vanish&mdash;pull up by that lamp-post,
  won't you? Well&mdash;so long, old chap. Nothing personal&mdash;eh, Mac?"</p>

  <p>"No, damn you! Nothing personal. I wish I were coming with you. Good luck.
  Good-by, old chap."</p>

  <p>They did not shake hands, for that might have implied that there was a
  dwindling friendship, to be bridged or denied recognition. Diana sprang down
  from behind and Dawa Tsering followed her. McGregor drove away, not looking
  back, and the sais&mdash;the sole occupant now of the back seat&mdash;sat
  with folded arms, staring straight along the middle of the street. But Ommony
  took no chances with the sais; he watched until the dog-cart turned a corner
  before he made a move of any kind.</p>

  <p>Then he walked straight to a door between two shop-fronts and pounded on
  it. He had to wait about three minutes before the door was opened&mdash;
  gingerly, at first, then after a moment's inspection, suddenly and wide.</p>

  <p>A very sleepy-looking Jew confronted him&mdash;a Jew of the long-nosed
  type, with the earlock that betokened orthodoxy. He had a straggly beard,
  which he stroked with not exactly nervous but exceedingly alert long
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"Ommony! This time of night?" he said in perfectly good English; but there
  was nothing that even resembled English about his make-up. He wore a turban
  of embroidered silk and a Kashmir shawl thrown over a cotton shirt and baggy
  pantaloons. His bare feet showed through the straps of sandals.</p>

  <p>"Let me in, Benjamin."</p>

  <p>The Jew nodded and, holding a lantern high, led the way down a passage
  beside a staircase into a big room at the rear, that was piled with heaps of
  clothing&mdash;costumes of every kind and color, some new, some second-hand,
  some worthy to be reckoned antiques. There were shelves stacked with
  cosmetics and aromatic scents. There were saddles, saddle-cloths and
  blankets; tents and camp-equipment; yak-hair shirts from over the Pamirs;
  prayer-mats from Samarkand; second-hand dress suits from London; silk-hats,
  "bowlers," turbans; ancient swords and pistols; match-locks, adorned with
  brass and turquoise and notched in the butt suggestively. And there was a
  smell of all the ends of Asia, that Diana sniffed and deciphered as a
  Sanskrit scholar reads old manuscripts.</p>

  <p>"I will have tea brought," said Benjamin, setting down the lantern and
  shuffling away in the dark toward the stairs. The impression was that he
  wanted time to think before indulging in any conversation.</p>

  <p>Ommony sat down on a heap of blankets and beckoned Dawa Tsering to come
  closer to the light.</p>

  <p>"Now you know where to find me," he said abruptly. "When the Jew returns
  he shall let you out by the back door. Find your way to that house in the
  courtyard. Tell those Tibetans that unless that letter&mdash;you still have
  it?&mdash;is delivered to the Lama, he shall never get that for which he came
  to Delhi. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Do you take me for a fool, Ommonee? You mean if he receives this letter
  he shall have the green stone? But that is the talk of a crazy man. Tell him
  he must buy the stone, and then let me do the bargaining!"</p>

  <p>Ommony betrayed no more impatience than he used to when he was teaching
  the puppy Diana the rudiments of her education. "I see I have no use for you
  after all," he said, looking bored.</p>

  <p>"Huh! A blind man could see better than that. It is as clear as this
  lantern-light that you and I are destined to be useful to each other. Nay,
  Ommonee, I will not go away!&mdash;What is that? I am not worth paying? Is
  that so! Very well, I will stay and serve for nothing!&mdash;Do you hear me,
  Ommonee? Huh! Those are the words of a great one&mdash;of a bold one
  &mdash;but it is nothing to me that you will not have me thrown into prison
  if I get hence.&mdash;I say I will not go away!&mdash;You will not answer,
  eh?&mdash;Very well I will go with the letter and that message. Then we will
  see! One of these days you will tell me I was right. Where is that Jew
  bunnia?"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>bunnia, bunya, baniya, baniah</i>&mdash;a (grain)
  merchant; also, a money-lender; sometimes used to denote a Hindu is
  general.]</p>

  <p>Benjamin came shuffling back along the passage, looking like an elongated
  specter as he stood in the door with the dark behind him. Dawa Tsering
  swaggered up to him demanding to be let out, and from behind the Hillman's
  back Ommony made a signal indicating the back door. Benjamin, very wide awake
  now and taking in everything with glittering black eyes, picked up the
  lantern and, leaving Ommony in the dark, led the way into another large room
  at the rear, out of which a door opened into an alley.</p>

  <p>"That one not only has a stink, he has a devil! Beware of him, Ommony!" he
  said, returning and sitting down on the blanket pile, making no bones about
  it, not waiting for an invitation. He and Ommony were evidently old friends.
  "My daughter will bring for us tea in a minute. Hey-hey! We have all grown
  older since you hid us in that forest of yours&mdash;where the ghosts are,
  Ommony, and the wolves and the tigers! Gr-r-r-agh! What a time that was! Our
  own people lifting hands against us! None but you believing us innocent! Tch-
  tch-tch! That cave was a place of terrors, but your heart was good. I left my
  middle-age in that cave, Ommony. Since fifteen years ago I am an old
  man!"</p>

  <p>The daughter came, carrying another lantern and a brass Benares tray,
  &mdash;a large-eyed woman with black hair, plump and the wrong side of forty,
  dressed in the Hindu fashion, her big breasts bulging under a yellow silk
  shawl. She made as much fuss over Ommony as if he were a long-lost husband
  but embarrassed him hardly at all, because she did not use English and the
  eastern words sounded less absurd than flattery does in any western
  tongue.</p>

  <p>"The son-in-law? Aha!" said Benjamin, "Mordecai does well. He is in
  Bukhara just now; but that is a secret. He buys Bukhara pieces from the Jews
  who became poor on account of the Bolshevism. Tay-yay! It is a long way to
  Bukhara, and no protection nowadays. We win or lose a fortune, Ommony!"</p>

  <p>The daughter poured tea into China cups that had once been a rajah's and
  the three drank together as if it were a sacred rite, touching cups and
  murmuring words that are not in any dictionary. Then the daughter went away
  and Ommony, leaning back against the wall, with Diana's great head on his
  lap, discussed things with Benjamin that would have made McGregor's ears burn
  if he had had an inkling of them.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Ommony, yes. I know which way the Lama travels. How do I know
  &mdash;eh? How was it you knew that a she-bear had a young one with her.
  Because she ground her teeth&mdash;wasn't that so? Well, I didn't know that,
  but I know a little about the Lama. Let me think. There is danger, Ommony,
  but&mdash;but&mdash;" (Benjamin's eyes shone, and his fingers worked
  nervously, as if they were kneading something concrete out of unseen
  ingredients) "&mdash;you love danger as I love my daughter!&mdash;You
  remember the time when you secured the costume business for me in the Panch
  Mahal in Pegu&mdash;when the rajah married and spent a fortune in a
  week?"</p>

  <p>Ommony nodded. Together he and Benjamin had done things that are not
  included in the lives of routine loving mortals&mdash;things that are
  forbidden&mdash;things that the orthodox authorities declare are not so. And
  there is mirth in memories of that kind, more than in all the comedies at
  which one pays legitimately to look on. Benjamin cackled and stroked his
  beard reminiscently.</p>

  <p>"Did the rajah ever learn that you and I were actors in that play? Heh-
  heh-heh! Did the priests ever discover it? Teh-teh-teh-heh-heh! Oh, my
  people! Eh-heh! You remember how the nautch-girls* were inquisitive? Ommony,
  you had the key to the temple crypts in your hand that minute! What actresses
  they were! What incomparable artists! And what children! The half of them
  were in love with you, and the other half were so devoured by curiosity
  &mdash;ach, how they wriggled with it!&mdash;they would have betrayed the
  chief priest at a nod from you! And didn't they dislike me! I haven't your
  gift, Ommony, for getting into the hearts; I can only see behind the brains.
  And what I see&mdash;but never mind. What times! What times! Did you never
  follow that up? Did you penetrate the crypts? Did you now?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>nautch</i> (Hindi)&mdash;an intricate traditional
  dance in India performed by professional dancing (nautch) girls.]</p>

  <p>"No time. Had to get back to work."</p>

  <p>"Ah, well&mdash;you wouldn't tell me, I suppose. But why not once more be
  an actor? Ommony, you know all the Hindu plays. I have seen you act
  Pururavas* and&mdash;well&mdash;believe me&mdash;I sat and pinched
  myself&mdash;I am telling you the truth!&mdash;and even so&mdash;but listen:
  the Lama Tsiang Samdup is planning to take a company of actors North for
  certain reasons!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Pururavas</i>&mdash;an allusion to the play
  Vikramorvashe or Urvashi Conquered by Valor by the Sanskrit poet Kalidasa, in
  which King Pururavas falls in love with a celestial nymph named Urvashi.

  returns to the heavens to perform in a celestial play. However, she is so
  smitten that she misses her cue and pronounces her lover's name during the
  performance. As a punishment for ruining the play, Urvashi is banished from
  heaven, but cursed to return the moment her human lover lays eyes on the
  child that she will bear him. After a series of mishaps, including Urvashi's
  temporary transformation into a vine, the curse is eventually lifted, and the
  lovers are allowed to remain together on Earth.

  <p>It would have been hard for anyone who did not know him intimately to
  believe that Ommony, as he sat there against the wall in an
  ultra-conservative English dinner jacket, could act any part except that of
  an unimaginative Englishman. There was not one trace of Oriental character
  about him, nor a hint of artistry. The only suggestion that he might be
  capable of more than met the eye was Benjamin's manifest affection&mdash;
  admiration&mdash;half-familiar, half-obsequious respect.</p>

  <p>"I'm ready for anything," he said in a matter-of-fact voice. "The question
  is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you dare! That is the question. Hah! You have the courage of a Jew!
  Dare you act all parts, Ommony? Oh-oh, but the risk is&mdash;Listen! There is
  a troupe of actors&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Benjamin's long fingers began to knead the air excitedly, but Ommony sat
  still, staring straight before him, frowning a little&mdash;aware that
  Benjamin was itching to divulge a confidence.</p>

  <p>"Their director, Ommony, is a man named Maitraya&mdash;His best male actor
  died&mdash;He will have to act the leading roles himself unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't see the advantage," Ommony objected. But he did&mdash;he saw it
  instantly.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Ommony! No bargain is a good one unless all concerned in it are
  gainers! Maitraya owes me money. He cannot pay. He is honest. He would pay me
  if he could. I hold his hundis.* I could ruin him. He must do as I say! Now
  listen! Listen!&mdash;there would be a solution of his difficulties,
  and&mdash;I might even be willing to advance just a little more money for his
  needs. He would not need much&mdash;just a little. And he must do as I say
  you understand! He must take you if I say so. The Lama commissioned me to
  engage the actors&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>hundi</i>&mdash;a promissory note.]</p>

  <p>"But won't he want to know all about the actors?" Ommony asked guardedly.
  He knew better than to turn down Benjamin's proposals point-blank.</p>

  <p>Benjamin grew suddenly calm, shot one keen glance at Ommony&mdash;and
  changed his weapon, so to speak, into the other hand. It began to be clear
  enough that Benjamin had irons of his own to heat.</p>

  <p>"Of course, if you ask me, Ommony&mdash;if you were to ask my advice
  &mdash;as a man to a man of business&mdash;I would ask you, why not go
  straight to Tilgaun, and there wait for the Lama? He is searching you say for
  a piece of jade, which is in your possession. Will he not follow you to
  Tilgaun, if you go straight there? How much trouble you would save! How much
  risk you would avoid!"</p>

  <p>"And how much information I might lose!"</p>

  <p>"Show me the jade, Ommony."</p>

  <p>"Can't. I've sent it to Tilgaun. The Lama doesn't know that. He thinks
  I've got it with me."</p>

  <p>"Well? Then if you go to Tilgaun, won't he follow you?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly. But I prefer to follow him. It's this way: you and I,
  Benjamin, have been friends for fifteen years, haven't we? If you have
  anything you want to keep from me&mdash;I don't doubt there are lots of
  things&mdash;you tell me point-blank, and I'm careful to shut my eyes and
  ears. If I stumble on anything by accident, I dismiss it from mind; I forget
  it. If you tell me a secret in confidence, I keep it a secret&mdash;take no
  advantage of you. I know you treat me in the same way. But the Lama is
  supposed to have been my friend for twenty years, although I've never met him
  to speak to&mdash;never saw him until yesterday. He has always managed not to
  meet me, without ever giving any reason for it; and he has conveyed the
  impression that he is keeping some great secret from me, without having the
  courtesy to ask me to restrain natural curiosity. Now comes this piece of
  jade, with all sorts of mysterious side-issues. He traces it into my hands.
  Instead of asking me for it, and asking me, as one friend to another, not to
  follow up the mystery, he spies on me&mdash;deliberately counts on my honesty
  and courtesy&mdash;and keeps out of sight. He plans to meet me at Tilgaun,
  where his arm might be lots longer than mine. I used to consider him a wise
  old Saint, but lately he has made me suspect him of deep mischief. His spying
  on me is an open invitation to me to spy on him. I propose to find out all I
  can about him. If he has been using me as a stalking-horse all these
  years&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You could begin at Tilgaun, Ommony, just as easily as here," said
  Benjamin, stroking his beard. His eyes were glittering eagerly, but
  friendship apparently imposed the obligation to find fault with a plan if
  possible before helping to carry it out.</p>

  <p>"No. He wants me to go straight to Tilgaun. I don't propose to play into
  his hands. The place to begin to unravel a mystery is at one or the other end
  of it."</p>

  <p>"He may have traced you to my place, Ommony. If you should go with
  Maitraya, the Lama will know it. If he thinks you have the stone in your
  possession, he will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Probably try to steal the stone. I'm hoping he will exhaust his
  ingenuity. I can create a mystery on my own account; he'll be puzzled. He
  won't dare to have me murdered until he knows for certain where the stone is.
  For fear of losing track of it altogether, he'll have to do everything
  possible to preserve my life and to save me from exposure."</p>

  <p>"If he is clever, he will go straight to Tilgaun!" said Benjamin. "That is
  what I would do in his place. Then you would have to follow him."</p>

  <p>"If he does that, well and good. But if my guess is right, he has a whole
  network of intrigue to attend to. He proposed to have me cool my heels in
  Tilgaun while he attended to business on the way."</p>

  <p>Benjamin began to pace the floor between the heaps of assorted clothing.
  He seemed to be torn between personal interest and desire to give Ommony the
  soundest possible advice. He muttered to himself. His arms moved as if he
  were arguing. Once he stood still with his back toward Ommony and bit his
  nails. Then he walked the floor again three or four times, almost stopping
  each time as he passed Ommony. At last he stood still in front of him.</p>

  <p>"If I tell you&mdash;things that I should not tell&mdash;what will you
  think of me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Ommony laughed abruptly. "Suppose I tell you first what I think you have
  in mind!" he said. "You old simpleton! Why do you suppose I came straight to
  you at this hour of the night?" (He glanced up at the wall behind him.) "You
  didn't get that devil-mask in Delhi! It's hanging there to inform some sort
  of Tibetans that they've come to the right place. I've known for more than
  nine years that you're the business agent for a monastery in the Ahbor
  country. However, it's your secret&mdash;you don't have to tell me a thing
  you don't want to."</p>

  <p>Benjamin stared at him&mdash;a rather scandalized, a rather astonished, a
  rather sly old Benjamin, with his turban a little to one side and his lower
  lip drooping. There was a hint of terror in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"How much else do you know? You? Ommony!" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. That is&mdash;no more than a blind man who knew you intimately
  couldn't help knowing. Shut up, if you want to. I don't pry into my friends'
  affairs, and you're not like the Lama. You've kept nothing from me I was
  entitled to know."</p>

  <p>"Not&mdash;not like the Lama! Ommony&mdash;if you knew!" Benjamin began
  mumbling to himself in Spanish, but there were Hebrew words interspersed with
  it. Ommony, knowing no Hebrew or Spanish, let him mumble on, frowning as if
  busy with his own thoughts. There was still an hour before dawn, when the
  stirring of a thousand other thoughts would inevitably break the chain of
  this one&mdash;plenty of time for Benjamin to outpour
  confidences&mdash;nothing to be gained by urging him.</p>

  <p>"Tsiang Samdup the Lama is good&mdash;he is better than both of us!"
  Benjamin said at last emphatically. He seemed to be trying to convince
  himself. "God forbid that I should play a trick on him! But&mdash;
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Not a word from Ommony. To all appearance he was brown-studying over
  something else, twisting Diana's ear, staring into the shadows beyond the
  lantern, so intent on his own thoughts that he did not move when a rat
  scurried over his feet. Benjamin burst into speech suddenly:</p>

  <p>"Fifteen&mdash;nearly sixteen years, Ommony, I have been agent for the
  Lama Tsiang Samdup! You would never believe the things he buys! Not ordinary
  things! And he pays with bullion&mdash;gold bars! Wait&mdash;I show you!" He
  unlocked a safe in the corner of the store and produced three small bars of
  solid gold, giving them to Ommony to weigh in the palm of his hand. But there
  was no mark upon them; nothing to identify their place of origin.</p>

  <p>"I have had dozens like those from him&mdash;dozens!" But Ommony could not
  be tempted to ask questions; he knew Benjamin too well&mdash;suspected that
  Benjamin was too shrewd an old philosopher to engage in nefarious trade; also
  that he was itching to divulge a confidence. If you scratch a man who itches,
  impulse ceases. Besides, he was perfectly sincere in not wanting to pry into
  Benjamin's private affairs. To listen to them was another matter. Benjamin
  came and sat down on the pile of blankets&mdash;laid a hand on Ommony's
  shoulder&mdash;thrust his chin forward, and screwed his eyes up.</p>

  <p>"If he should know I told&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He'll never learn from me."</p>

  <p>"Girls! Nice&mdash;little&mdash;young ones!"</p>

  <p>Ommony looked startled&mdash;stung. There was the glare in his eyes of a
  man who has been scurvily insulted.</p>

  <p>"Little European girls! Little orphans! Seven! Eh, Ommony? Now what do you
  think? And all the supplies for them&mdash;constantly&mdash;books&mdash;
  little garments. Ah! But they grow, those young ones! Stockings! Shoes! Now,
  what do you think of that?"</p>

  <p>"Are you lying?" Ommony asked in a flat voice.</p>

  <p>"Would I lie to you! Would I tell it to any other man. First to get the
  girls&mdash;and such a business! Healthy they must be, and well born
  &mdash;that is, nicely born. And the first was a little Jewess, eight years
  old at that time, from parents who were killed in Stamboul. That was not so
  very difficult; a Jew and his wife whom I knew intimately brought her as
  their own child to Bombay; and after that it was easy to dress her as a Hindu
  child, and to pretend she was a little young widow, and to smuggle her
  northward stage by stage. And once she reached Delhi there was the Middle
  Way, Ommony, the Middle Way! Hah! It was not so difficult. And the profit was
  very good."</p>

  <p>"I'm waiting for you to hedge," said Ommony. "So far, I simply don't
  believe you."</p>

  <p>"Well: the next was eleven years old, and she made trouble. She was the
  child of a sea-captain who was hanged for shooting drunken sailors. Some
  missionaries took care of her; but they said things about her father, and she
  ran away&mdash;from Poona&mdash;the mission was in Poona. So, of course,
  there was a search, and much in the newspapers. We had to hide her carefully.
  The missionaries offered a reward, but she did not want to go back to the
  missionaries. In many ways her character was such as Tsiang Samdup wished.
  And in the end we conveyed her by bullock-gharry all the way from Bombay to
  Ahmedabad, where we kept her several months in the home of a Hindu midwife.
  Then the Middle Way. The Middle Way is easy, when you know it.</p>

  <p>"The third was from Bangalore&mdash;and she was only nine months old
  &mdash;no trouble at all&mdash;the daughter of a very pretty lady who was
  engaged to be married but the man died. She gave the baby to my wife's
  sister. That child went North in the arms of a Tibetan woman from
  Darjeeling.</p>

  <p>"And the fourth was from London&mdash;a Russian musician's daughter. And
  the fifth was from Glasgow. And the sixth from Sweden, or so it was said.
  Those three were all about the same age&mdash;six, or seven, or
  thereabouts.</p>

  <p>"The seventh&mdash;she was nine years old, and the best of them all
  &mdash;was from New York&mdash;born in New York&mdash;or at sea, I forget
  which. Her father, an Irishman, died and the mother, who was English, went to
  visit her people in England. But the people had died too. So she went back to
  America, and there was some difficulty in connection with the immigration
  laws. She was not allowed to land. She had to return to England, where there
  was destitution and I know not what followed after that, though it is easy to
  imagine things. The mother was dying, and I was told she wished above all
  things to save the child from being put in an institution. Some people who
  are well known to me offered to care for the child. It happened I was in
  London, Ommony. I went and saw the mother; and, since she was dying, I took a
  chance and told her certain things; and perhaps because she was dying, and
  therefore could understand and see around the corner, as it were, she agreed.
  We had conversed, as you might say, heart to heart. It was I who brought that
  child to India. I had to adopt her legally, and&mdash;oh, Ommony, if I could
  have kept her! She was like my little own daughter to me! But what was there
  that I could do for her&mdash;an old Jew, here in Delhi? Money, yes; but
  nothing else, and money is nothing. It broke my heart. She went northward by
  the Middle Way&mdash;you know what I mean by the Middle Way?"</p>

  <p>Ommony's expression was stone-cold; he was speechless. He eyed Benjamin
  with a hard stare that had reached the rock-bottom of revelation and disgust.
  He did not dare to speak. Having pledged his word in advance not to betray
  Benjamin's secrets, his word was good; there was no hesitation on that score.
  A deliberate promise, in his estimation, stood above all obligations,
  whatever the consequences to himself. But he felt that sickening sensation of
  having trusted a man who turned out to be rotten after all.</p>

  <p>He did not dare to say a word that might give Benjamin an inkling of his
  real feelings. He must use the man as an ally. In a way he was indebted to
  him&mdash;for information as to the Lama's real activities. No wonder the
  Lama had kept so carefully aloof! Ommony forced himself to smile&mdash;
  battling with the horror of the thought of being co-trustee with a Tibetan,
  who with his right hand helped to run a philanthropic mission and with his
  left imported European girls, for the Powers of Evil only knew what purpose.
  There are other purposes, as well as crude vice, for which children may be
  stolen. His own sister&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You say Tsiang Samdup is better than both of us?" he remarked at last,
  surprised at the evenness of his own voice.</p>

  <p>"Much better!" said Benjamin. "Ah, Ommony&mdash;I see your face. Old I am.
  Blind I am not. But listen: have you seen what happens to the children whose
  parents die or desert them? Not the children of the poor; the little girls
  who are well born, who feel things that other children do not feel. I am a
  Jew&mdash;I know what feeling is! Hah! I have seen animals in cages who were
  happier! And what is happiness? Provision of necessities? Bah! They provide
  necessities for men in jail&mdash;and will you search in the jails to find
  happiness? I will show you thousands who have all they want, and nothing that
  they need! You understand me? Tsiang Samdup&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind," said Ommony, "I'll find out for myself." He did not want to
  talk; he was afraid of what he might hear&mdash;still more of what he might
  say. There are some men, who present an impassive face toward the world, who
  can face death grinning and are not afraid of "the terror that moveth by
  night" or "the pestilence that stalketh at noonday," who would rather be
  crucified than reveal the horror they have for a certain sort of traffic.
  Their emotion, too sacred, or too profane to be discussed, is nameless
  &mdash;indescribable&mdash;only to be borne with set teeth.</p>

  <p>"Ah! I know!" said Benjamin. "I know you, Ommony! What I have said is
  secret; therefore you don't wish to hear any more, because you are too much a
  man to violate what is told in confidence. And you have made no promise to
  the Lama. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Ommony nodded&mdash;grimly. That was the one bright point of light.</p>

  <p>"I could tell&mdash;I could tell much," Benjamin went on. "But I saw you
  shut your mind against me. As well pour oil on fire to put it out as talk to
  a man who mistrusts! Very well. We have been friends, you and I. Remember
  that, Ommony. And now this: you believe in a devil&mdash;some kind of a
  devil&mdash;all Englishmen do. You believe I am a devil&mdash;Benjamin, your
  friend, whom you hid in a cave in your forest&mdash;me and my wife and my
  daughter. We are devils. Very well. A promise that is made to the devil has
  not to be kept, Ommony! Go and see for yourself. I will help you. When you
  have seen, you shall judge. Then, after that, if you say I am a devil, you
  shall break your faith with me. You shall denounce me. I will let you be the
  judge."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been into the Ahbor country?" Ommony asked. His voice was
  sullen now. There was a leaden note in it.</p>

  <p>"No," Benjamin answered.</p>

  <p>"And those&mdash;those children went to the Ahbor country?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then what proof have you of what the Lama has done with them?"</p>

  <p>"Ommony&mdash;as God is my witness&mdash;I have none! I think&mdash;
  I&mdash;I am almost positively sure&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paced the floor twice, and then flung himself down on the blankets
  beside Ommony, looking up into his face. He was afraid at that moment, if
  ever man was.</p>

  <p>"That is why I have told you! I swore never to tell! Find out, Ommony!
  Tell the truth to me before I die. I am an old man, Ommony. If I have been a
  devil, I will eat&mdash;eat&mdash;eat the shame to the last crumb! Ommony, I
  swear&mdash;by my fathers I swear, I believe&mdash;I am almost positively
  sure&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He buried his face in his hands; and there was silence, in which Ommony
  could hear Diana's quiet breathing and his own heart-beats and the ticking of
  the watch in his vest-pocket.</p>

  "Gupta Rao"</h2>

  <p class="quote">When the actor, having thrown aside the costume and the wig,
  departs&mdash;is he a villain? Shall we take stones and murder him because
  for our amusement he enacted villainy?<br>
  If he should act death in the play because decency demands that, do we
  therefore burn him afterward and curse his memory? And is his wife a
  widow?<br>
  And is life not like the play? The gods who watch the drama know that
  somebody must play the villain's part, and somebody the pauper's. They reward
  men for the acting. He who acts a poor part well receives for his reward a
  more important part when his turn shall come to be born again into the
  world.<br>
  He, therefore, who is wise plays pauper, king or villain with the gods in
  mind.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">DAWN came and no Dawa Tsering. Pale light through cobwebbed
  windows drove the dark into corners and consumed it, until the devil-mask on
  the wall over Ommony's head grinned like a living thing and the street noises
  began, announcing that Delhi was awake. Diana stirred and sniffed,
  mistrusting her surroundings, but patient so long as Ommony was satisfied to
  be there. Benjamin shuffled away to the stairs. The daughter came, fussily,
  fatly hospitable, with chota hazri* on the brass Benares tray&mdash;fruit,
  tea, biscuits, and a smile that would have won the confidence of Pharaoh,
  Ruler of the Nile.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>chota hazri</i> (Hindi, "little breakfast")&mdash;
  a refreshment taken in the early morning, before or after the morning
  exercise. The term... was originally peculiar to the Bengal Presidency. In
  Madras the meal was called "early tea." The Hobson Jobson Dictionary.]</p>

  <p>But Ommony's heart had turned harder than Pharaoh's ever did. He could
  hardly force himself to be civil. He drank the tea and ate the fruit because
  he needed it, unconscious now of any ritual of friendship in the act,
  answering polite inquiries with blunt monosyllables, his mind and memory
  working furiously, independently of any efforts at conversation. His face was
  a mask, and a dull one at that, with no smile on it. The iron in him had
  absolute charge.</p>

  <p>He was not by any means the sort of man who flatters himself.</p>

  <p>"You damned, deluded fool!" he muttered pitilessly, and Diana opened one
  eye wide, awaiting action.</p>

  <p>He blamed himself, as mercilessly as he always had been merciful to
  others, for having acted as the Lama Tsiang Samdup's foil for twenty years.
  Above all things he despised a smug fool, and he called himself just that. He
  should have suspected the Lama long ago. He should have seen through
  Benjamin. He had believed his trusteeship of the Tilgaun Mission was a clean
  and selfless contribution to the world's need. Why hadn't he resigned then
  from his government job long ago to devote his whole career to the trust he
  had undertaken? If he had done that, he knew no Lama could have hoodwinked
  him. No little girls would have been smuggled then into the unknown by way of
  Tilgaun.</p>

  <p>The self-accusation case-hardened him. He set his teeth, and almost
  physically reached out for the weapons of alertness, patience, persistence,
  cunning, with which he might redeem the situation. For redeem it he surely
  would, or else perish in the attempt. Exposure too soon would do no good. He
  needed full proof. And he cared less to punish the offenders than to rescue
  the children who had been carried off, and to make anything of the sort
  impossible in future, wondering, as he considered that, what anyone would be
  able to do for girls in their predicament. The early years are the most
  impressionable; their characters would have been undermined. And then a worse
  thought: was Benjamin the only agent? There might be a regular market for
  European girls in that unknown corner of the earth, with secret agents
  supplying it from a dozen sources. If so, he felt and accepted his full share
  of responsibility. Who else could share it with him? Only Hannah Sanburn.
  She, too, had shielded the Lama and, if ignorant of what was going on, might
  at least have suspected.</p>

  <p>And thoughts of Hannah Sanburn did not give comfort. He remembered now a
  dozen incidents that should have made him suspect her years ago. That look in
  her eyes, for instance, and her nervousness whenever he had urged her to
  bring about a meeting between the Lama and himself. He recalled now how
  carefully she had always shepherded him through the mission, under pretext of
  observing the proprieties; she had never given him a chance to talk alone
  with any of the mission girls, and like a fool he had believed she did that
  to prevent the very suggestion of scandal from finding an excuse. He had
  admired her for it. But there was that room (or was it two rooms) near her
  own quarters that she had always kept locked, and that he had not cared to
  ask to inspect, because she said she kept her personal belongings in
  there.</p>

  <p>And now this story, told by Mrs. Cornock-Campbell, a witness as
  trustworthy as daybreak, of a white girl named Elsa, who spoke English and
  Tibetan, who had been to Lhasa, and who could draw&mdash;for he had seen the
  drawings&mdash;as masterfully as Michael Angelo. And Hannah Sanburn's plea
  for secrecy. And the fact that McGregor had had suspicions.</p>

  <p>Marmaduke might not have been the father of this strange girl, but that
  did not preclude the possibility of Hannah Sanburn being the mother. It
  seemed likely&mdash;more than likely&mdash;that the Lama possessed knowledge
  which enabled him to blackmail Hannah Sanburn; it was easy enough to
  understand how that well-bred New England woman would fight to preserve her
  good name, and how, if the Lama had once tempted her into one false position,
  she could be terrified from bad to worse. There is more deliberate blackmail
  in the world than most of its indirect victims suspect.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Ommony wondered that Hannah Sanburn should not have confided
  in himself. She might have known he would have shielded her and helped her to
  redeem the situation. She had had dozens of proofs of his friendship. He
  smiled rather grimly as he thought to what lengths he would have gone to
  shield and befriend Hannah Sanburn&mdash;and yet more grimly&mdash;
  cynically&mdash;as it dawned on him to what lengths he might now have to go.
  Friendship is friendship&mdash;unto death if need be.</p>

  <p>Benjamin returned; and an hour's thought had had its effect on him too.
  His assistants came, and he chased them out on hurriedly invented errands,
  barring the shop door behind them.</p>

  <p>"I have sent for Maitraya," he announced, stroking his beard, watching
  Ommony sidewise. He seemed to be not quite sure that Ommony might not have
  changed his mind with daylight.</p>

  <p>"All right. Hunt me out a costume."</p>

  <p>Ommony stepped off the pile of blankets and began to strip himself.
  Benjamin's swift fingers sought and plucked along the shelves, selecting this
  and that until a little heap of clothing lay ready on a table, Ommony saying
  nothing but observing almost savagely, like a caged man watching his meal
  prepared.</p>

  <p>"There, that is perfect," said Benjamin at last. "A dude&mdash;a dandy,
  such as actors are&mdash;aping the high caste&mdash;too educated to submit to
  inferiority&mdash;a little of this, a little of that&mdash;
  fashionable&mdash;tolerated&mdash;half-philosopher,
  half-mountebank&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Stark-naked, Ommony confronted him, and Benjamin betrayed the naked fear
  that has nothing to do with physical consequences. Ommony looked straight
  into his eyes and analyzed it, as he had done fifteen years ago when he
  protected Benjamin against accusers.</p>

  <p>"All right, Benjamin. I'll trust you this once more. But no flinching. See
  it through."</p>

  <p>He dressed himself, Benjamin watching alertly for the least mistake, but
  that was an art in which no man in the world could give Ommony instruction;
  he knew costumes as some enthusiasts know postage stamps, and he bound on the
  cream-colored silk turban without a glance in the mirror that Benjamin held
  for him.</p>

  <p>"I'll need an old trunk now, and three or four changes," he said abruptly.
  "No, cow-hide won't do&mdash;no, there's glue in that imported thing
  &mdash;observe caste prejudices, even if I'm supposed to have none&mdash;
  basketwork's the stuff. That's it. Throw me in a trousseau."</p>

  <p>He began to pace the floor, adjusting himself to the costume, finding it
  not difficult; his natural, sturdy gait learned in forest lanes with a gun
  under his arm, suggested independence and alertness without a hint of drill,
  which is the secret of self-assurance; add good manners to that and an
  intimate knowledge; there is not much acting needed.</p>

  <p>He looked stout and a bit important in the flowing cotton clothes. The
  short beard gave him dignity. His skin, weathered by twenty years of outdoor
  life, needed no darkening. Even his legs, and his bare feet thrust into red
  morocco slippers had the ivory color that belongs to most of the higher
  castes; and an actor must be of Brahmin* or Kshatriya&dagger; origin if he
  hopes to be admitted anywhere within the pale from which the lower castes are
  utterly excluded. His profession makes him technically unclean, but that is
  rather an advantage than a handicap.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Brahmin</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a member of the highest
  of the Hindu varnas (castes)&mdash;that of priests and teachers. The word is
  related to, but not to be confused with, the Hindu religious conception of

  <p class="footnote">[&dagger; <i>Kshatriya</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a member of the
  second highest of the four castes of traditional Indian society, responsible
  for upholding justice and social harmony, and including people in governing
  and military positions.]</p>

  <p>"And the name! The honored name!" asked Benjamin admiringly.</p>

  <p>"Gupta Rao. I'm a Bhat-Brahmin* of Rajputana."&dagger;</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Bhat-Brahmin</i> (Hindi)&mdash;Priest-

  <p class="footnote">[&dagger; <i>Rajputana</i>&mdash;an historic region of

  Rajputana included more than 20 princely states, notably Bikaner, Jaipur,
  Jodhpur, Udaipur, and Ajmer. The internal autonomy of many of the states was
  guaranteed. Most of these states were incorporated into Rajasthan after India
  gained independence in 1947. <i>Columbia University Encyclopedia</i>.]</p>

  <p>Benjamin sat down and laughed with his head to one side, nursing a
  knee.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Oh, you Ommony! A Jew you should have been! Hey-yey-clever! Now who
  would have thought of that but you! Yah-tchah! Bhat-Brahmin&mdash;of whom
  even rajahs are afraid! Gossiping tongue! The privilege to slander!
  Yah-keh-keh-keh! You are a clever one! Not even a Brahmin will challenge you,
  for fear you will make him a laughing-stock! Keh-hah-hah-hey-hey-hey! Ah, but
  wait, wait! We forgot the pan. You must have a pouch to carry betel-nut. And
  the caste-mark&mdash;keep still while I paint the caste-mark."</p>

  <p>And then at last came Dawa Tsering, not pleased with himself but trying to
  appear pleased, adjusting his eyes to the dimness as Benjamin let him in by
  the back door. "Where is Ommonee?"</p>

  <p>He stared about him, brushed past Ommony contemptuously, and at last saw
  the cast-off dinner jacket and white shirt. He broke into the
  jargon-Hindustani that serves for lingua franca in that land of a hundred
  tongues, chattering as he hurried along the passage past the stairs and back
  again:</p>

  <p>"Where is he? Is he hiding? Has he gone?" Then, shouting at last in
  something near panic: "Oh&mdash;Ommonee!"</p>

  <p>He stared at Diana, but she gave him no information. She lay curled up on
  the floor, apparently asleep. Benjamin looked non-committal&mdash;busy
  considering something else.</p>

  <p>"Where is he&mdash;thou?" the Hillman demanded, coming to a stand in front
  of Ommony and fingering the handle of his knife. The light was dim just there
  where the saddles were piled in a ten-foot heap.</p>

  <p>"Would you know his voice?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Aye, in a crowd!"</p>

  <p>"Would you know his walk?"</p>

  <p>"None better! Seen from behind, when he is thinking, he rolls thus, like a
  bear. But who art thou? Where is he?"</p>

  <p>Ommony turned his back, walked to the heap of blankets by the wall, and
  sat down.</p>

  <p>"Would you know him sitting?" he asked casually; and suddenly it occurred
  to Dawa Tsering that he was being questioned in his own tongue.</p>

  <p>"Thou!" he exclaimed. "Well, may the devils destroy the place! Art thou
  then a magician?" He sniffed three times. "Not even the smell is the same!
  Was it the Jew who worked the magic? Art thou truly Ommonee?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm changed. I'm Gupta Rao. If you ever call me Ommony again without
  my permission, I will bring to pass a change in your affairs that you will
  remember! Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Gupta Rao&mdash;huh? A change&mdash;eh? Hmn! And that is not a bad idea.
  Change me, thou! There are many garments in this place&mdash;buy me some of
  them. That Lama played a dirty trick on me. He has vanished. I found his
  chela Samding, and I told him the Lama owes me two months' pay; and I said
  'Where is the Lama?' But Samding, standing by a covered bullock-cart (but the
  cart was empty, for I looked) laughed at me and said nothing. I would have
  killed him if I had not thought of that letter, which you said the Lama must
  receive. So I slapped Samding's face with the letter, and threw it on the
  ground in front of him, and bade him pick it up and find the Lama or take the
  consequences. And he said, with that mild voice of his, that I had become
  very reckless all at once, so I hustled him a time or two, hoping to make him
  strike me, that I might with justice strike him back. But he has no fight in
  him. He picked up the letter, holding it thus, because there was dirt on it
  and he hates to soil his hands. And he said to me, 'The Lama has no further
  use for you!' Do you hear that, thou&mdash;what is thy new name? &mdash;Gupta
  Rao? Did you ever hear the like of it for impudence? You wonder, I suppose,
  why I didn't smite Samding there and then, so that the Lama would have no
  further use for him. Trust me, I would have done; but two great devils of
  Tibetans came out of a doorway and seized me from behind. Lo, before I could
  draw my knife they had hurled me into a party of Sikh soldiers who were
  passing, so that I broke up their formation, they blaming me for it, which is
  just like Sikhs. And it isn't wise to argue with too many Sikhs, so I ran.
  Now&mdash;what is thy name again? Gupta Rao? Well&mdash;it would now be
  fitting to disguise me, so that I may come on that Lama and his chela and the
  whole brood of them unawares. Then let us see what one man can do to
  half-a-dozen!"</p>

  <p>Ommony got up and began to pace the floor again. It would be difficult to
  disguise Dawa Tsering, even if that were advisable, for the man had a swagger
  that was as much a part of him as his huge frame, and a simplicity that
  underlay and would inevitably shine through all cunning. Yet the man would be
  useful, since he knew more than a little about the Lama's goings and comings;
  and, once in the Hills, where a man without an armed friend has a short life
  and a sad one as a rule, he would be almost indispensable.</p>

  <p>He had not made up his mind what to do when one of Benjamin's assistants
  hammered on the shop door and announced Maitraya. Dawa Tsering sat down
  beside Diana, who seemed to have decided he was tolerable, and Maitraya
  entered stagily, as if he thought he were a god, or wished other people to
  believe him one. He was not a very big man, but he had a trick of filling up
  the doorway and pausing there before he strode into the room to seize by
  instinct the most conspicuous position and command all eyes.</p>

  <p>His face was rather wrinkled, but he was richly clothed in new Tussore
  silk, with a gorgeous golden cummerbund, and his gallant bearing tried to
  give the lie to fifty years. There were marks on his handsome face that
  suggested debauch, but might have been due to former hardship; his manner on
  the whole was one of dignity and conscious worthiness. One could tell at a
  glance what were his views on the actor's art and on the position that actors
  should hold in the community; in another land he would have pestered the
  politicians for a knighthood. A pair of gorgeous black eyes, that he knew how
  to use with effect, glowed under a heavy lock of black hair that he had
  carefully arranged to fall in apparent carelessness beneath his turban.</p>

  <p>"You wished to see me, Benjamin?"</p>

  <p>His voice was tragic, his language Urdu, his diction refined to the verge
  of pedantry. Benjamin signed to him to be seated on a heap of blankets, but
  he declined the invitation like Caesar refusing a throne (except that Caesar
  could not have done it with such super-modesty).</p>

  <p>"May all the glorious gods, and above all friendly, fortunate Ganesha,*
  have worked on you and made you change your mind, O stubborn Benjamin! Father
  of money-bags! Provider of finery for entertaining fools! Patient, but too
  cautious Benjamin! May all the gods melt butter on you for your former trust
  in me, Maitraya,&mdash;and may they also melt your heart! I need you,
  Benjamin. I have a bargain with that Lama struck and bound. The man is crazy,
  and a traitor to all his gods, but he knows a little. God knows they will
  tear him between wild asses for debauching his religion, when he gets back to
  Tibet! Believe me or not, Benjamin&mdash;although I hope my word rings
  unsuspicious in your ears&mdash;he leans toward modern views! Can you imagine
  that&mdash;in a Ringding Lama from Tibet? He proposes just what I have always
  preached&mdash;to modernize the ancient plays, retaining their charm and
  morality, but making them comprehensible! The man is mad&mdash; mad as an
  American&mdash;but genuinely gifted with imagination. It will make me famous,
  Benjamin."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Ganesha</i> (Sanskrit/Hindi)&mdash;The god of
  wisdom and the remover of obstacles, son of Shiva and Parvati, depicted as a
  short fat man with an elephant's head. <i>American Heritage
  Dictionary</i>.]</p>

  <p>"Does he offer to pay you?" Benjamin asked dryly. "Richly! Princely! Like
  a maharajah&mdash;with the difference&mdash;aha!&mdash;that he will settle
  regularly, instead of forcing me to borrow from his special money- lenders
  (as the rajahs do) while I await his slow convenience. I tell you, Benjamin,
  the Lord Ganesha surely smiled on me in the hour of this Lama's birth!"</p>

  <p>"Did you ask for money in advance?" asked Benjamin.</p>

  <p>"Not I, Benjamin. What do you mistake me for&mdash;a parasite? A beggar? A
  man without dignity? A hanger-on of some courtesan? Nay, nay! I remembered my
  blessed friend Benjamin, who likes to do business at a reasonable profit, and
  who will be glad to advance me a little more, in order that I may pay what I
  already owe. Are we not good friends, Benjamin? Have I ever defrauded you or
  told you a word of untruth?"</p>

  <p>"A man's word and his deed should be one," Benjamin answered. "I hold your
  hundis that you have not paid. There is interest due on them."</p>

  <p>"True, Benjamin, true. I have been unfortunate. Who could have foretold
  smallpox, the death of three actors, and the burning of a theater? But
  another might have repudiated, Benjamin. Another might have told you to hunt
  for your money where the smallpox and the fire are born! Kali* can care for
  her own! Did I repudiate? Did I not come and tell you I will pay in
  time?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Kali</i> (Hindi: "the black one")&mdash;important
  goddess in popular Hinduism and Tantra. Known also as Durga (the
  Inaccessible) and as Chandi (the Fierce), Kali is associated with disease,
  death, and destruction. As Parvati she is the consort of Shiva. Although
  often represented as a terrifying figure, garlanded with skulls and bearing a
  bloody sword in one of her many arms, she is worshiped lovingly by many as
  the Divine Mother. Her cult, popular among many lower caste Hindus...
  frequently includes animal sacrifice. Kali was patroness of the Thugs.
  <i>Columbia University Encyclopedia</i>. In his own footnote Mundy remarks
  that Kali is the "Goddess, among other horrors, of the smallpox."]</p>

  <p>"The worst is, you are not the only one," said Benjamin. "I have another
  here, who is heavily in my debt, although a famous actor, more famous than
  you, and a much finer artist. This is Gupta Rao sahib, of Bikanir."</p>

  <p>"I never heard of him," said Maitraya, looking slightly scandalized
  although prepared to condescend.</p>

  <p>"He is a very great actor," said Benjamin. Whereat Ommony bowed with
  becoming gravity, and Maitraya took his measure, up and down.</p>

  <p>"Does he act in that beard?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"I have lately been acting the part of an Englishman," said Ommony; and
  his Urdu was as perfect and pedantic as Maitraya's.</p>

  <p>"An Englishman? There are few who can do that with conviction." Maitraya
  stepped back a pace. "You don't look like an Englishman. No wonder you grew a
  beard. That is the only way you could have carried off the part at all
  without looking foolish. It takes a man of my proportions to play an
  Englishman properly. I have been told that I excel at it. I played once
  before the officers of a cavalry regiment at Poona, and they assured me they
  believed I was an English gentleman until I stepped down off the stage. Watch
  this."</p>

  <p>Maitraya inserted an imaginary monocle and gave an outrageous caricature
  of a stock Englishman as portrayed in comic papers on the European
  continent.</p>

  <p>"God-dam fine weather, eh? Not bad, eh? What?"</p>

  <p>"I see you are a genius," said Ommony. "I could not do it nearly so well
  as that."</p>

  <p>"No, I dare say not. The actor's is an art that calls for technique.
  However, I dare say you are good in conventional parts," said Maitraya,
  mollified.</p>

  <p>"I have seen him and I am a good judge of such matters," said Benjamin.
  "What I have to say to you, Maitraya, is that I am anxious about the money
  which you and Gupta Rao owe me."</p>

  <p>Benjamin put on his extra-calculating air, that Jews use to make their
  customers believe there is something as yet undecided&mdash;an alternative
  course, less profitable to the customer. It is the oldest trick in the world
  &mdash;much older than Moses. Maitraya showed furtive alarm.</p>

  <p>"My son-in-law is away on a long journey. It is costing too much. I need
  the money," Benjamin went on. "I will not advance you more&mdash;no, not a
  rupee more&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Unless?" said Maitraya. He was watching the old Jew's face, flattering
  himself that he could read behind the mask and swallowing the bait as simply
  as a hungry fish.</p>

  <p>"Unless you take Gupta Rao with you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I could give him small parts," said Maitraya, cautiously yet with a
  gorgeous magnanimity.</p>

  <p>"As leading actor," Benjamin went on, "on a leading actor's salary, so
  that he may have a chance to pay me what he owes."</p>

  <p>"But I must first see him act," Maitraya objected. "I promised the Lama a
  company of actors second to none, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And on this new hundi both your names must go," said Benjamin, "so that
  you are both responsible, and I can take a lien on Gupta Rao's salary if I so
  wish."</p>

  <p>That stipulation started a long-winded argument, in which Ommony joined
  sufficiently to add confusion to it and support Benjamin by pretending to
  support Maitraya. Benjamin's investment in costumes, theatrical properties
  and cash might be considerable, and there was no reason why the shrewd old
  merchant should not protect himself. At the end of an hour of expostulation,
  imprecation, gesticulation and general pandemonium Benjamin had his way,
  vowing he had never made a more unprofitable bargain in his life, and
  Maitraya was convinced that Gupta Rao had at least a rich vocabulary.
  Moreover, as fellow victims of necessity, with their names on a joint
  promissory note, they had an excuse for friendship, of which Ommony took full
  advantage.</p>

  <p>"Being of Brahmin origin, of course I have access to inner circles, and
  enjoy privileges that are denied to you; and if I were an ordinary Brahmin I
  would not join forces with you. But we Bhats consider ourselves above caste,
  and when we find an outcaste of merit and distinction, such as you evidently
  are, we believe it no dishonor to befriend him. You will find it a great
  advantage to have me in your company, and for many reasons."</p>

  <p>Maitraya was readily convinced of that. A Bhat enjoys more privileges than
  any scald* did in the Viking days, for there is none who dares to call him in
  question and nowadays, at least in Northern India, there is no authority that
  can discipline him. An orthodox Brahmin is very easily kept within bounds,
  and it is next to impossible for a man of lower caste to pose as a Brahmin
  successfully because at the first suggestion of suspicion he would be
  questioned narrowly and be required to give substantial proofs; if the proofs
  were not forthcoming the Brahmins would simply close their ranks against him.
  But who shall challenge the College of Heralds on points of etiquette?</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>scald, skald</i> (Icelandic)&mdash;one of the
  ancient Scandinavian poets and historiographers; a reciter and singer of
  heroic poems, eulogies, etc., among the Norsemen; more rarely, a bard of any
  of the ancient Teutonic tribes. <i>Webster's 1913 Dictionary</i>.]</p>

  <p>The very Pundits themselves, who are the fountainheads of orthodoxy, are
  at the mercy of the Bhats. A Pundit who should challenge a Bhat's veracity or
  privilege would lay himself open to such scurrilous attack, in song and jest
  and innuendo, as he could never stand against. He would be in the position of
  a public man in Europe or America who should dare to defy the newspapers. The
  only limits to a Bhat's audacity are imposed by his own intelligence and his
  own gift of invective. He may act, sing, dance in public and be undefiled; he
  may accept gifts whose very shadow no orthodox Brahmin would dare to let fall
  on his door-step; and that source of strength is the secret of his weakness
  at the same time, since, like the Press that accepts paid advertising, he has
  to be careful whose corns he crushes.</p>

  <p>Maitraya, finding himself linked with this Gupta Rao by a contract, which
  Benjamin would certainly enforce, began at once to take good care to
  establish cordial relations. He was even deferent in his remarks about the
  beard.</p>

  <p>"Beautiful it is, and manly&mdash;good to see, Gupta Rao, but&mdash; for
  certain parts and certain purposes&mdash;will it not be inconvenient?"</p>

  <p>Ommony conceded that point. He withdrew to a little dark room and removed
  the beard by candle-light, using a razor belonging to one of Benjamin's
  assistants and, since the skin was paler where the hair had been, rubbing on
  a little dark stain afterward. While that was going on, Maitraya was regaled
  by Benjamin with accounts of Gupta Rao's audacity and influence.</p>

  <p>"Then why is he not rich?" Maitraya asked. "These Bhats are notorious for
  luxury. Everybody gives them presents, to keep their tongues from
  wagging."</p>

  <p>"That is just it," Benjamin explained. "Too much luxury! Too many gifts!
  It spoils them. This one is a gambler and a patron of the courtesans, who
  favor him exceedingly. Tshay-yay-yay! What a weakness is the love of women!
  But he is on his good behavior at present because, says he, a Bikaniri broke
  his heart. But the truth is, she only emptied his pockets."</p>

  <p>"And that great dog?" Maitraya asked. "To whom does that belong?"</p>

  <p>Benjamin stroked his beard and hesitated. But Ommony had heard every word
  of the conversation through the thin partition.</p>

  <p>"And that great savage beside the dog&mdash;that Northerner&mdash;who is
  he?" asked Maitraya.</p>

  <p>Ommony emerged, having reached a conclusion at last as to what should be
  done with Dawa Tsering and Diana. "I must count on your honor's sympathy and
  good will," he said, smiling at Maitraya rather sheepishly. "That hound is
  the agent of Hanuman.* The man from Spiti is a simpleton, whose service is to
  keep the hound in good health and to assist with occasional amorous errands.
  Our friend Benjamin has not told all the truth. Whose heart is broken while
  he can communicate with his beloved?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Hanuman (Sanskrit)&mdash;the Hindu monkey-god and
  helper of Rama; the god of devotion and courage; also the patron of love-
  affairs.]</p>

  <p>Maitraya smiled. He had acted in too many plays, in which the plot
  consisted of intrigue between man and woman, not to accept that sort of story
  at face-value. Life, to him, was either drama or else mere drudgery. Ommony
  excused himself, to go and talk with Dawa Tsering.</p>

  <p>"Now this dog is used to a dog-boy," he said sternly. "Moreover, she will
  do as I say, and if you are kind to her, she will be tolerant of you."</p>

  <p>Diana smelt Ommony over inquisitively. The strange clothes puzzled her
  but, having nosed them thoroughly, she lay down again and waited.</p>

  <p>"She is an incarnation of a devil," said Dawa Tsering. "I am sure of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Quite right. But she is a very friendly devil to her friends. I am going
  to tell her to look after you; and she will do it. And I order you to look
  after her. Keep the fleas off her. Attend to it that she is clean and
  comfortable."</p>

  <p>"What then?"</p>

  <p>"The Jew shall provide you with new clothing, after you have cleaned
  yourself. When I go presently, with that man Maitraya, you are to remain
  here, and you will see that the dog will remain with you willingly. At the
  proper time you are to come and find me."</p>

  <p>"But how, Ommonee? How shall I find you?"</p>

  <p>"Don't call me Ommony! Remember that. My name is Gupta Rao."</p>

  <p>"That makes you even more difficult to find!"</p>

  <p>"You are going to learn what the dog can do. When I send a messenger, the
  dog will follow him, but you are to remain here, do you understand? You are
  not to move away on any condition. When it suits my convenience the dog will
  return to this place alone and will bring you to wherever I may happen to be.
  Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't understand, but I will wait and see," said Dawa Tsering. "I
  think you would make a good thief on the te-rains, Om&mdash;I mean, Gupta
  Rao!"</p>

  <p class="quote">Men agree that prostitution is an evil, and they who know
  more than I do have assured me this opinion is right. But there are many
  forms of prostitution, and it may be that among the least of them is that of
  women, bad though that is. I have seen men sell their souls more inexcusably
  than women sell their bodies&mdash;and with more disastrous consequences
  &mdash;to themselves and to the buyer.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">IT TOOK five minutes to convince Diana that she was
  henceforth responsible for Dawa Tsering, but once that fact had been absorbed
  she accepted the duty without complaint. There was no whimper from the hound
  when Ommony accepted Maitraya's invitation to go in search of the Lama. He
  and Maitraya, side-by-side in a tikka-gharry* drove through the crowded
  streets, now and then passing Englishmen whom Ommony knew well. Members of
  the mercantile community, Moslems as well as Hindus, bowed to Maitraya from
  open shop-windows or from the thronged sidewalk as if he were a royal
  personage. Men who would not have let his clothing touch them, because of the
  resulting caste-defilement, were eager to have it known that they were on
  familiar terms with him; for a popular actor is idolized not only in the
  West.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>tikka-gharry</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a one-horse open
  cab.]</p>

  <p>"You see, they know me!" said Maitraya proudly. "Men whose names I can't
  remember pay me homage! Actors are respected more than kings and priests
  &mdash;and justly so. They rule badly and teach nonsense. It is we who
  interpret&mdash;we who hold example up to them!"</p>

  <p>The man's vanity delivered him tied and bound to Ommony's chariot wheels.
  There was nothing to do but flatter him, and he would tell all he knew,
  accepting the flatterer as guide, philosopher and friend appointed for his
  comfort by the glorious gods.</p>

  <p>"I am surprised that a man of your attainments should condescend to
  employment by this Lama person," said Ommony. "Of course, if you are willing,
  so am I, but how did it come about?"</p>

  <p>"You would never believe. He is a very strange Lama&mdash;more unusual
  than rain in hot weather or the sun at midnight; but I have a gift for
  attracting unusual people. By Jinendra,* Gupta Rao, I have never seen the
  like of him&mdash;even in these days, when everything is upside down! He has
  a chela by the name of Samding, who has more genius in his little finger than
  any dozen statesmen have in their whole bodies. Not that it would do to tell
  him so&mdash;I don't believe in flattering beginners&mdash;they can't stand
  it. And he lacks experience. That Lama must be a very expert teacher.</p>

  realised one; the Enlightened One; Tirthankara the Supreme Soul, Arihant, who

  <p>The first time I met him, he was one of a crowd who watched me act
  'Charudatta' in The Toy Cart*&mdash;a part that I excel in. Afterward, he
  invited me to witness a performance in private by his chela, and I went with
  him to a mysterious place kept by some Tibetans at the end of a stone
  courtyard&mdash;the sort of place where you would expect to be murdered for
  your shoe-leather&mdash;a place that smelt of rancid butter and incense and
  donkey stables. Whoof! I shudder now, to think of it! But the chela was
  marvelous. Calm&mdash;you never saw such equipoise&mdash;such balance of all
  the faculties! And a voice as if a god were speaking! The middle note, true
  as a bell, like a gong to begin with every time, rising and lowering from
  that with utter certainty&mdash;half-tones&mdash;quarter-tones
  &mdash;passion, pathos, scorn, command, exhilaration&mdash;laughter like a
  peal of bells&mdash;wait until you have heard it, Gupta Rao! You will be as
  thrilled as I was. You will say I did not exaggerate. Perfect! If only
  success doesn't turn the boy's head!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>The Toy Cart</i> (Sanskrit: "Mrichchhakati")
  &mdash;a drama in ten acts by King Sudraka, supposed to be the oldest
  Sanskrit drama extant and to have been written in the first or second century
  BCE. www.blessingsonthenet.com/glossary. The following synopsis is taken from
  http://server1.fandm.edu/departments: "The Toy Cart" is an epic drama full of
  adventure, political intrigue, comedy and romance. The story revolves around
  a love affair between a beautiful courtesan and a virtuous Brahmin merchant
  (Chardutta). Their private story becomes intertwined with affairs of state
  when the courtesan (Vasantasena) is pursued by the king's brother-in-law, who
  is obsessed with her... It is attributed to the playwright Sudraka who, in
  the preface to the play, describes himself as "a king, a mathematician,
  knowledgeable in love and skilled in the training of elephants".
  <i>Wikipedia</i> notes that the play was met with "widespread admiration when
  staged in New York in 1924" and that, in 1984, is was made into a Bollywood
  movie titled "Utsav" and directed by Girish Karnad.]</p>

  <p>"What language?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Prepare to be amazed! Ancient Sanskrit&mdash;modern Urdu&mdash;with equal
  fluency and equal grace! Distinct enunciation&mdash;and a command of gesture
  that expresses everything, so that you know what he will say before he
  speaks! But that is not all. I tell you he is marvelous! He has the modern
  touch. He understands how to play an ancient part so that it means something
  to the uninitiated. I am already jealous of him! I tell you, when that boy
  has had the advantage of my instruction for a while, he will be great&mdash;
  the greatest actor in the world!"</p>

  <p>"What proposal did the Lama make?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"A crazy one. I told you the man is mad. He proposes to give free
  entertainments&mdash;on tour&mdash;at places selected by himself&mdash; for
  an indefinite period. I am to provide a troupe of excellent actors, for whom
  I am to be responsible. There are to be three women among them, but the
  dancers will be provided by the Lama, as also the music, and Samding the
  chela is to play the leading female parts."</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised he takes any women at all," said Ommony. "There's a
  prejudice against actresses. They're always a nuisance. Properly trained boys
  are better. If a man plays leading woman, the women will only make him look
  absurd by contrast."</p>

  <p>"Well, that is his affair. I suggested that, but the Lama insisted. And
  mad though he undoubtedly is, he knows his own mind, and is shrewd in some
  respects. I lied to Benjamin when I said I had not asked for money in
  advance. I did my best to hold out for that&mdash;naturally. But I suspect
  the Lama knows a lot about me, and he certainly knows Benjamin; he told me to
  go to Benjamin and to get what credit I may need from him. Do you see the
  idea? If he and Benjamin have a private understanding, that gives him an
  extra hold over me&mdash;it makes me practically powerless to oppose him in
  anything, however ridiculous his demands may turn out to be. You see, I have
  to pay Benjamin's bill. However&mdash;here we are."</p>

  <p>And where they were was not the least surprising feature of the mystery.
  The tikka-gharry drew up at an arched gate in a high wall, over which trees
  leaned in well cared for profusion. There were cut flowers tucked into the
  carving on the arch, and blossoms strewn on the sidewalk. A dozen carriages,
  most of them with thoroughbred horses, waited in line near the gate, and the
  dazzling sun projected on the white wall shadows of thirty or forty men in
  turbans of every imaginable color, who seemed to have nothing to do but to
  lounge near the entrance. Some of them nodded at Maitraya; several salaamed
  to him; one or two were at pains to stare insolently.</p>

  <p>In the gateway was a fat chuprassy with a lemon-colored silk scarf, and
  the whitest clothes that ever any man wore&mdash;whiter than the wall, and
  starched stiff. He stood guard over about fifty pairs of slippers, most of
  which were expensive, and nearly all of which looked new. There was no
  question as to what kind of a house it was&mdash;or rather, palace; and there
  was music tinkling in a courtyard, which confirmed the general
  impression.</p>

  <p>"Vasantasena's birthday," said Maitraya. "They began to celebrate at dawn.
  But what does that matter? We are not rich fools who have to race to do the
  fashionable thing. Our presence honors her, however late we come. Have you a
  present ready? Lend me a piece of gold, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Where should I get gold?" asked Ommony&mdash;instantly aware that he was
  teetering on the edge of his first mistake. Maitraya cocked a wondering eye
  at him; it was quite clear that he knew all about a Bhat's resources, even if
  the Bhat himself, for unimaginable reasons, should choose to have forgotten
  them.</p>

  <p>"I will improvise a poem in her honor," Ommony explained. "Women enjoy
  poems, and I am good at them. Give me a glimpse of her, and then see."</p>

  <p>"Ah, but they like the poem gilded! Women are practical! Moreover, I am no
  poet," said Maitraya. "Now one gold piece from each of us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ommony smiled. Without the beard he looked as obstinate as ever, but
  humorous lines were revealed at the corners of his mouth which the beard had
  hidden. He decided to put his disguise to a severe test now, while the
  consequences of detection might not be too disastrous.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, kicking off his slippers under the archway and
  accepting the chuprassy's salaam with a patronizing nod, as if the fellow
  were dirt beneath his sacred feet, "I will attend to it."</p>

  <p>Beyond the arch there was a small paved courtyard, around the walls of
  which were flowers growing in painted wooden troughs. There were several
  tradesmen squatting there with trays of jewelry in front of them, silver and
  even golden images of gods, and all sorts of valuable gifts that a visitor
  might buy to lavish on the lady who kept house within. The tradesmen were
  noisy, and sarcastic when not patronized. Maitraya bridled, his vanity not
  proof against insinuations that he probably had squandered all his fortune
  long ago on much less lovely women. But one hard stare from Ommony and the
  banter ceased.</p>

  <p>"I will sing a song to Vasantasena about the jackals at her gate!" he said
  sternly; whereat one of them offered him money, and another tried to thrust a
  silver image of a god into his hands. But he brushed all those offers
  aside.</p>

  <p>"Shall a Bhat-Brahmin take gifts from such as you?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Pranam!* Pranam! Paunlagi!&dagger;" they murmured, raising both hands to
  their foreheads; whereat he blessed them, as a Brahmin is obliged to, with a
  curt phrase that means "Victory be unto you," and he and Maitraya passed on,
  through another arch, into a courtyard fifty feet square. There was a
  fountain in the midst, around which about a dozen well dressed Hindus were
  gossiping.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>pranam</i> (Hindi)&mdash;1) a deep obeisance; 2) a
  reverential greeting.]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[&dagger; <i>Paunlagi</i>&mdash;a title of respect.]</p>

  <p>"I would have taken the fool's money," said Maitraya. "Are you not
  entitled to it?"</p>

  <p>Ommony glanced at him contemptuously. "A tiger, if he wishes, may eat
  mice!" he answered. "A bear may eat frogs&mdash;if he likes them! A pig eats
  all things!" Maitraya looked chastened.</p>

  <p>There came across the courtyard, swaggering toward them, an heir to an
  ancient throne, in rose-pink turban and silken breeches, with silver spurs
  nearly six inches long, and a little black mustache on his lazy face that
  looked as if it had been stuck on there with glue. He whacked his long boots
  with a rhino-hide riding whip and rolled a little in his gait, as if it were
  almost too much trouble to support his vice-exhausted frame. He was for
  passing without notice, but Ommony stood by the fountain and mocked him. He
  knew that youngster&mdash;knew him well.</p>

  <p>"Do they still wean young princes on camel's milk and whisky in
  Telingana?" he asked tartly. "I have heard tales of changelings. Return, O
  treasure of a midwife, and hear me sing a song; I know a good one!"</p>

  <p>The gossipers around the fountain pricked their ears. The prince seemed to
  come out of a day-dream. "Ah! Oh! I kiss feet!" he exclaimed, and made as if
  to pass on. But Ommony was determined to try his hand to a conclusion.</p>

  <p>"Those boots are not respectful. They offend me!" he sneered. "Are they
  cow-skin? They look like it!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, damn!" remarked the prince in English. "Here, take this and confer a
  blessing," he went on in Urdu, diving into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Gold!" warned Ommony. "I declare you gave gold to the woman in there. All
  fees are payable in gold!"</p>

  <p>"Gold? I have none. You must take this," said the prince and passed a
  handful of crumpled paper money. "Pranam."</p>

  <p>"Victory be unto you," said Ommony, accepting it, and the prince made his
  escape, muttering under his breath at the insolence of Brahmins, and of Bhats
  in particular.</p>

  <p>"But paper money is no good," Maitraya objected. "I have paper money," he
  added, lying for vanity's sake.</p>

  <p>But Ommony was creeping into the Bhat-Brahmin part.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you say so? Go and buy mohurs* then from the sonar&dagger; at
  the gate," he retorted.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>mohur</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a gold coin.]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[&dagger; <i>sonar</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a goldsmith]</p>

  <p>"Nay, Gupta Rao, you said you would provide the presents. It is only fair.
  You owe me a consideration. And besides, now I come to think of it, I left
  most of my money at home."</p>

  <p>Ommony thrust the paper money contemptuously into Maitraya's hands,
  smiling in a way that spared the actor no embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Go and buy mohurs at the gate," he said. "I wait here."</p>

  <p>Maitraya returned presently with four gold coins and offered two of
  them.</p>

  <p>"The sonar cheated me&mdash;he cheated like a dog!" he grumbled, but
  Ommony shrugged his shoulders and waved the coins aside.</p>

  <p>"Give them all to the woman. I have another way to make her smile," he
  said, looking important.</p>

  <p>Maitraya approached humility as closely as professional pride would
  permit.</p>

  <p>"It occurs to me I did not ask a blessing when we first met. I crave
  forgiveness. Your honor was so unusually free from false pride that I
  overlooked the fact you are a Brahmin. Pranam."</p>

  <p>Ommony murmured the conventional curt blessing, and dismissed the apology
  as if it were beneath notice. They passed into another courtyard on which
  awninged windows opened from three sides. In a corner a dozen musicians were
  raising Bedlam on stringed instruments, their tune suggestive of western jazz
  but tainted, too, like Hawaiian music, with a nauseating missionary lilt.
  Fashionable India, in the shape of thirty or forty younger sons of over-rich
  Hindus and a sprinkling of middle-aged roses, was amusing itself in a bower
  of roses and strong-smelling jasmine, while in a corner of the courtyard
  opposite the music three girls were dancing more modestly than the scene
  would have led a censor of morals to expect.</p>

  <p>It was a gorgeous scene, for the sun beat down on a blaze of turbans and
  the awnings cast purple shadows that made it all seem unreal, like a vision
  of ancient history. Maitraya was greeted noisily by a dozen men; he bowed to
  them right and left, as if accepting applause as he entered a stage from the
  wings. The girls danced more vigorously, under the eyes of an expert now,
  whose approval might be of more than momentary value. Professional zeal took
  hold of the musicians; the tune grew louder and less careless.</p>

  <p>"Beware! Vasantasena is in a Begum's* fury!" someone shouted. "None can
  satisfy her. Prince Govinda of Telingana gave her a quart of gold mohurs, and
  she sent him away because he had dared to call on her in riding boots! I
  advise you to try her with two quarts of gold, and to crawl on your
  belly!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Begum</i>&mdash;a title given to women of rank in
  South Asia. It used to be conferred upon women of royalty or aristocracy at
  special moments in life including the birth of a son. It derived from Arabic
  and Urdu signifying that they are void of care. <i>Wikipedia</i>.]</p>

  <p>A stone stair gave on to the courtyard, through a doorway guarded by two
  tall serving-men&mdash;immaculate, proud images of stern propriety, turbaned
  and sashed with blazing silk. They looked incapable of smiling, or of
  anything except the jobs they held, but as gilt, as it were, on the surface
  of sin they were unsurpassable. Ommony's disguise and manner aroused no
  suspicion, although swift suspicion was what they drew wages for, and they
  would have thrown him out into the street if as much as a suggestion had
  crossed their minds that he might be a European. They scrutinized Maitraya
  and Ommony and passed them as autocratically as if they were Masters of
  Ceremony passing judgment on attendants at a royal levee.</p>

  <p>But royal levees are easier for outsiders to attend than that one was, and
  royalty, even in India, is shabby nowadays because its power is at most a
  shadow of the past and its forms mean nothing more than a cheap desire by
  unimportant folk to strut in a reflected pseudo-glory. Kings and conquerors
  go down, but whoever thinks that the power of the Pompadours has waned knows
  very little of the world or human nature. Vasantasena wielded more influence,
  and could pull more hidden wires than any dozen maharajahs, and the court she
  kept, if rather less splendid than a royal one, was alive with the mysterious
  magnetism of actual personal power. It was almost tangible, and much more
  visible than if she had been surrounded by men in armor.</p>

  <p>Upstairs there was no attempt at glittering display, but art and Old-
  World luxury in every considered detail. A hall, paneled in carved teak and
  hung with Rawalia woven curtains and a silver lamp on heavy silver chains,
  conveyed no suggestion of wickedness; a Christian bishop could have trodden
  the soft Persian rug (had he dared) and have imagined himself in the midst of
  sanctity. But as Ommony and Maitraya reached the stair-head the curtains
  facing them across the hall were parted, and a girl peeped through whom
  hardly a Wahabi* ascetic would associate with thoughts of Paradise. She was
  much too paganly aware that life is laughter, and that men are amusing
  creatures, to be criticized by standard formula; and she looked like a mother
  o' pearl Undine faintly veiled in mist&mdash;one of those fabled spirits who
  may receive a human soul, perhaps, someday, by marriage with a mortal
  &mdash;when she slipped out through the curtains and stood more or less
  revealed. She was clothed, and from head to foot, but not in obscurity.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Wahabi</i> (Arabic)&mdash;a member of a Moslem sect
  founded by Abdul Wahhab (1703&mdash;1792), known for its strict observance of
  the Koran and flourishing mainly in Arabia. <i>American Heritage
  Dictionary</i>.]</p>

  <p>She greeted Maitraya with a smile of recognition that suggested no
  familiarity. She was friendly, but perfectly sure of herself, and as sure of
  his unimportance. Then she glanced at Ommony, observed the caste-mark on his
  forehead, and made him a little mock-salaam, covering her eyes with both
  hands and murmuring "Pranam."</p>

  <p>"This is Gupta Rao sahib. The Joy of Asia will be pleased to see us both,"
  said Maitraya, assuming his courtliest air; whereat the girl laughed at
  him.</p>

  <p>"She is not so easily pleased," she answered, glancing at Maitraya's hand.
  There was not much that her dark eyes missed. He gave her one of the gold
  mohurs, and then she stared straight at Ommony. Maitraya nudged him, trying
  to slip a mohur into his hand; but if you are to act the part of a
  Bhat-Brahmin it is as well not to begin by bribing anyone who can be
  overawed.</p>

  <p>"I have a song to sing!" said Ommony. "Shall I include you in it? Shall I
  add a verse concerning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Swiftly she drew the curtain back and, laughing impudently over-shoulder
  at him, signed to him rather than to Maitraya to follow her down a short wide
  corridor to a door at the end that stood slightly ajar and through which came
  a murmur of voices. Through that she led without ceremony into a square room
  in which half a dozen men were seated on a long cushioned divan beneath a
  window at the farther end. They were wealthy, important-looking men, one or
  two of middle age. Girls, dressed as unobscurely as the one who had acted
  guide, were passing to and fro with cigarettes and sitting down between
  whiles on heaped cushions near the men's feet. In the center of the room a
  white-robed Hindu was making two costumed monkeys perform tricks, solemnly
  watched by the men in the window, who took scant notice of Ommony and
  Maitraya.</p>

  <p>Vasantasena was not there. Her richly draped divan under a peacock-
  colored canopy at the end of the room facing the window was vacant, although
  two girls with jeweled fans lounged on cushions, one on either side of it, as
  if she were expected to come presently. The sharp cries of the man with the
  monkeys and the occasional giggle of a girl punctuated an under-hum of
  murmured conversation from the men by the window. The atmosphere was loaded
  with dim incense and cigarette smoke, blown into spirals of bluish mist by a
  punkah* that swung lazily, pulled by a cord through a hole in the wall.
  Ommony sat down cross-legged on a cushioned couch against the wall midway
  between the window and Vasantasena's divan, and Maitraya followed suit. Two
  girls, possessed of patronizing smiles, brought cigarettes and a little
  golden lamp to light them by.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>punkah</i>&mdash;a large fixed and swinging fan,
  formed of cloth stretched on a rectangular frame, and suspended from the
  ceiling, which is used to agitate the air in hot weather. <i>The Hobson
  Jobson Dictionary</i>.]</p>

  <p>It was sixty seconds before Ommony grew aware of the essential fact. He
  lit a cigarette and blew smoke through his nose before he dared to look a
  second time, for fear of betraying interest. Having satisfied himself that
  Maitraya was studying the girls with an air of professional judgment assumed
  for the perfectly evident purpose of disguising a middle-aged thrill; and
  that after one glance none of the men in the window was in the least
  interested in himself, Ommony let his eyes wander again toward the darkest
  corner of the room beyond Vasantasena's divan. There, on a mat on the floor,
  sat no other than the Ringding Gelong Lama, Tsiang Samdup, with his chela
  Samding beside him.</p>

  <p>They sat still, like graven images. The Lama's face was such a mass of
  unmoving wrinkles that it looked like a carved pine-knot with the grain
  exposed. He was dressed in the same snuff-colored robe that he wore when
  Ommony first saw him in Chutter Chand's back room, and if he was not
  day-dreaming, oblivious to all surroundings, he gave a marvelous imitation of
  it.</p>

  <p>The chela was equally motionless, but less in shadow and his eyes were
  missing no detail of the scene; they were keen and bright, expressing alert
  intelligence, and each time Ommony looked away he was aware that they were
  watching him with a curiosity no less intense than his own. But they refused
  to meet his. Whenever he looked straight at the chela, although he could not
  detect movement, he was sure the eyes were looking elsewhere.</p>

  <p>He was also very nearly sure that Samding whispered to the Lama; the calm
  lips parted a trifle showing beautifully even white teeth, but the Lama made
  no acknowledgment.</p>

  <p>"What is the Lama doing in this place?" he asked. "I don't know," said
  Maitraya, "but he told me to meet him here. Many important plans are laid in
  this place. Ah! Here she comes!"</p>

  <p>Maitraya was nervous, suffering from something akin to stage-fright, which
  consumes the oldest actors on occasion. It was clear enough that, though he
  had been in the place before it was rather as an entertainer than a guest,
  and he was not quite sure now how to behave himself. He tried to shelter
  himself behind Ommony&mdash;to push him forward as every one rose to his feet
  (every one, that is, except the Lama and Samding, who appeared to be glued to
  the mat).</p>

  <p>But Ommony was no man's fool, to rush in where Maitraya feared to tread.
  He wanted time for observation. He laughed aloud and swung Maitraya forward
  by the elbow, arousing a ripple of merriment from the women, as a door opened
  behind where the Lama was sitting and Vasantasena entered to a chorus of
  flattering comment from every one.</p>

  <p>She was worth running risks to see; as gracious, modest to the eye and
  royal-looking as her attendant women were the opposite. Her dress was not
  diaphanous, and not extravagant; she wore no jewelry except a heavy gold
  chain reaching from her shoulders to her waist, long earrings of aquamarine,
  plain gold bangles on her wrists, and one heavy jeweled bracelet on her right
  ankle. From head to knees she was draped in a pale blue silk shawl that
  glittered with sequins.</p>

  <p>By far her most remarkable feature was her eyes, that were as intelligent
  as Samding's, or almost; but her whole face was lit up with intelligence,
  though as for good looks in the commonplace acceptance of the term, there was
  none. She was too dynamic to be pretty; too imperious to arouse impertinent
  emotions. She was of the type that could have ruled a principality of
  Rajasthan, in the days before those hotbeds of feudalism went under in a
  cycle of decay.</p>

  <p>She took her seat under the canopy, settled herself on one elbow among the
  cushions, with one small henna-stained foot projecting over the edge of the
  divan, noticed Maitraya and suddenly smiled. That explained her. Her smile
  was the miracle of Asia&mdash;the expression of the spirit of the East that
  so few casual observers catch&mdash;a willingness to laugh&mdash;a knowledge
  that the whole pageant of life is only maya* after all and not to be taken
  too seriously&mdash;satisfaction that the sins of this life may be wiped out
  in the next, and the next, and that all inequalities adjust themselves
  ultimately. The true philosophy is sterner stuff than that; but it was
  impossible to see that smile of hers and not understand why men of the world
  paid her homage and tribute; she could see through any make-believe, and
  pardon any crime but impudence. One could see how she wielded more power than
  a thousand priests, and would very likely work less evil in the end, although
  fools were likely to go to swifter ruin in her company than elsewhere. She
  had force of character, and that is very bad for fools.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>maya</i>&mdash;a delusion]</p>

  <p>Maitraya bowed and stepped forward (for Ommony shoved him). The birthday
  tribute she had levied already that morning lay in a silver bowl on a little
  table to her right; Maitraya advanced to add his mite to it, bowed to her
  profoundly as he passed, and dropped his coins on top of the yellow heap,
  murmuring platitudes.</p>

  <p>"Three mohurs!" exclaimed one of the fan-girls, and the men near the
  window laughed.</p>

  <p>"Liar!" Maitraya cried indignantly. "I threw in five!"</p>

  <p>"Three!" the girl repeated, laughing scornfully, whereat every other woman
  in the room except Vasantasena, who ignored the whole transaction, mocked him
  and he went and sat down on the floor near the Lama with his back against the
  wall, scowling as if poison and daggers were his only joy.</p>

  <p>That left Ommony on his feet, wondering whether the Powers, that had
  treated him exceedingly well in all emergencies until that moment, would
  still stand by. It would not be correct to say his heart was in his mouth; it
  was pumping like a big ship's engines, humming in his ears, and if it had not
  suddenly occurred to him that this woman was possibly one of the Lama's
  agents for the traffic in white children he might have surrendered to
  nervousness. He forgot that she was too young to have had any hand in the
  incidents that Benjamin had told about&mdash;remembered only that the Lama
  was there in her house, and that a Bhat-Brahmin's tongue should be readier
  than nitroglycerine to go off and shake the pillars of any society.</p>

  <p>"O Brighter than the stars!&mdash;O Shadow of Parvati*&mdash;O Dew upon
  the Jasmine blossoms!" he began. "I bring a greater gift than gold."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Parvati</i> (Sanskrit)&mdash;a Hindu goddess; one
  of the major aspects of Devi, the universal goddess. She is known as one of
  the benevolent forms (while Durga and Kali are the wrathful forms). She
  appears as Shiva's consort, and is considered in this form to be a mountain
  goddess. www.siamese-dream.com/reference/parvati.html.]</p>

  <p>He was surprised by the ringing arrogance of his own voice. Vasantasena
  smiled. No man that day had dared to come empty-handed, yet with his mouth so
  full of brave words. The company had bored her. Here was a man who held out
  promise of amusement.</p>

  <p>"What is greater than gold?" she inquired in tones that came rolling from
  her throat like organ-music. And on the instant he challenged her.</p>

  <p>"Reputation!" he answered. "Shall I sing thine? For thou and I are both
  from Rajasthan, O Moon of men's desire!"</p>

  <p>She frowned and did not answer for a moment. It is quite in order to sing
  poems to a lady on her birthday, but it is not bad policy sometimes to know
  the words of the poem before giving a Bhat-Brahmin leave to sing; what
  scandal they don't know they are almost always willing to invent.</p>

  <p>"What is thy name?" she inquired, smiling again.</p>

  <p>"Gupta Rao."</p>

  <p>Her brows grew reminiscent, as if the name suggested vague connection with
  the past. She seemed not quite able to place it, but the men in the window
  scented a delicious piece of scandal and began calling for the song, and that
  naturally settled it; she was not going to be made foolish before a
  crowd.</p>

  <p>"Did you not come with Maitraya?" she asked quietly. "Is your business not
  with Tsiang Samdup?"</p>

  <p>"Subject to the Mirror of Heaven's smile," said Ommony, making an
  obeisance that verged on the brink of mockery.</p>

  <p>She raised her voice, not very loud, but so that it vibrated with
  power:</p>

  <p>"The noblemen who have honored me will find good entertainment in the
  inner courtyard. I will send down word as soon as I crave to rejoice in your
  lordships' smiles again!"</p>

  <p>Without a murmur the guests got to their feet and bowed themselves out; if
  she had been an empress they could not have been more complacently obedient.
  They went with side-glances at Ommony and nods to one another, implying that
  a great deal went on at times in that room that they would give their ears to
  know, but on the whole they more resembled overgrown children turned out to
  play than middle-aged, bearded courtiers given temporary leave of
  absence.</p>

  "All this in the space of one night."</h2>

  <p class="quote">The most important thing is Silence. In the Silence Wisdom
  speaks, and they whose hearts are open understand her. The brave man is at
  the mercy of cowards, and the honest man at the mercy of thieves, unless he
  keep silence. But if he keep silence he is safe, because they will fail to
  understand him; and then he may do them good without their knowing it, which
  is a source of true humor and contentment.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THE GIRLS took the seat in the window the men had vacated,
  and sprawled there like sirens on a rock. Even the fan-girls joined them. It
  was quite clear there was a secret in the air; the ostentatious way in which
  the girls kept up a low-voiced chatter to show they were not listening was
  proof enough of that. Vasantasena lay on the wide divan with a cushion
  beneath her breast and her chin on both hands, considering Ommony for several
  minutes before she spoke, presumably curious to know why he had come with
  Maitraya; possibly she thought the silence and the stare would break him down
  and make him offer an explanation, but he met her eyes with challenging
  indifference. Silence is the only safe answer to Silence.</p>

  <p>"Tsiang Samdup," she said at last, "let the girls put your mat here in
  front of me."</p>

  <p>But the Lama would not move. He shook his head. And Samding spoke:</p>

  <p>"The holy Lama knows where it is best to sit. He is not to be moved for
  convenience."</p>

  <p>The voice was no more astonishing than is anything else that sets a
  keynote. It was like the rhythm of a tuning-fork. It changed the key&mdash;
  the very atmosphere, asserting fundamental fact, to which everything else
  must adjust itself or be out of harmony. Vasantasena raised her eyebrows, but
  yielded and changed her position so as to face the Lama, signing to Ommony to
  squat down on a cushion beside Maitraya; which was disappointing, because it
  prevented him from watching the Lama's face. He could see Samding's profile
  beyond Maitraya's only through the corner of his eye, but he marveled at
  that; it was as beautiful as a figure of the Buddha done in porcelain.</p>

  <p>"If I am to let my piece of jade go," Vasantasena asked at last, "what
  reward have I?"</p>

  <p>"None," said the Lama; and that was another fundamental statement, issuing
  in a voice like the gong that starts the engines. It left nothing whatever to
  argue about.</p>

  <p>"Then why should I do it?" Vasantasena asked.</p>

  <p>"Because you wish to do it, and the wish is wise," the Lama answered, as
  if he were replying to the question of a little child.</p>

  <p>"How do you know I wish to do it?"</p>

  <p>"How do you know you are alive?" the Lama retorted.</p>

  <p>Vasantasena laughed. "I believe you know where you can sell it!" she said,
  in an obvious effort to lower the conversation to a plane on which she might
  have the advantage.</p>

  <p>"I know you do not believe that," said the Lama.</p>

  <p>Vasantasena sighed. "How do you learn such knowledge?" she asked. "You
  seem to know everything. I am not ignorant. A hundred men come here, and none
  of them can make a fool of me, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are not a fool," the Lama interrupted.</p>

  <p>"No, I am not a fool. I can whisper a word here and a word there, and some
  of the evil that would have been done dies still-born&mdash;and some of the
  good that might never have been born has birth. And as for me, what does it
  matter? And yet&mdash;sometimes I think it does matter about me. And
  sometimes I think I will give all my money to the poor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And rob them," said the Lama.</p>

  <p>"Rob them of what?" She stared at him blankly.</p>

  <p>"Of the moment. It is not wise to deprive them of the moment. At the
  moment of our utmost need, we learn."</p>

  <p>"Yours is a heartless creed," she retorted, glancing at the money in the
  bowl beside her. "That money would feed a thousand people."</p>

  <p>"Nothing is heartless," said the Lama. "It is better to eat consequences
  now than to put off the day of retribution. Better the sting of an insect now
  than a serpent's bite a year hence. Better an experience in this life than a
  thousand-fold the bitterness in lives to come."</p>

  <p>"What says the Bhat to that?" she asked suddenly, glancing at Ommony, and
  Samding came out of his immobility to give one swift searching glance
  sidewise.</p>

  <p>Privilege has its disadvantages. It is one of the obligations of a Bhat
  that when appealed to he must say something; and the quicker he says it, the
  better for his reputation.</p>

  <p>"I am not your priest. You would like to quote me against him, but I am
  only interested in learning why I was brought here," Ommony answered.</p>

  <p>Vasantasena sneered. "Just like a Bhat! You think of nothing but your own
  convenience. Well, I am glad there is none of your money in my birthday bowl.
  Rather I will give you some of it. Here&mdash;help yourself."</p>

  <p>"It is unclean money," said Ommony, falling back on the caste-rules that a
  Bhat may observe if he chooses, even if the other Brahmins refuse him
  recognition.</p>

  <p>"Is that true?" she asked the Lama. "This is not all. I am rich. I have
  lakhs and lakhs."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>lakh, lac, laksha</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a unit in a
  traditional number system, still widely used in India and Bangladesh, equal
  to a hundred thousand. A hundred lakhs make a crore. <i>Wikipedia</i>.]</p>

  <p>"It is yours," the Lama answered. "It is your responsibility."</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "as I told you before, if you will take it all, you may
  have it. I am about to become Sanyasin.* I think the piece of jade will help
  me more than all my money. I will keep the jade."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* In a sense this means "taking the veil," although the
  process is almost exactly the opposite. Just as men so often do in India,
  women sometimes renounce all worldly possessions and become wandering
  hermits, living in caves and practicing inhumanly severe austerities. Such
  women, whatever their previous occupation may have been, are deeply
  venerated. Original footnote.]</p>

  <p>"I will not take your money," said the Lama. "Nor can you escape
  responsibility. There is a Middle Way, and the middle of it lies before
  you."</p>

  <p>Vasantasena frowned, her chin on both hands, studying the Lama's face. His
  bright old eyes looked straight back at her out of a mass of wrinkles, but he
  did not move; if he smiled, there were too many wrinkles for anyone to be
  quite sure of it.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I will call the girls," she said at last. "I will test you.
  You must tell me from which of them I received the piece of jade."</p>

  <p>She clapped her hands and the girls came hurrying from the far end of the
  room, standing in a line self-consciously. They were used to being admired,
  and it was quite in keeping with the probabilities that every one of them had
  been bought and sold at some early stage of her career, but there was novelty
  in this ordeal, and they did not seem to know what to make of it.</p>

  <p>"That one," said Vasantasena, nodding at the nearest, "is much the most
  popular."</p>

  <p>"She has no other merit," said the Lama, and the girl looked bewildered
  &mdash;piqued.</p>

  <p>"And that one at the other end is the cleverest. She has the quickest wit
  of all of them. She might have stolen it."</p>

  <p>"If so she would have kept it," said the Lama, watching the girls' faces.
  "The fourth from this end. She is the one. Let the others go."</p>

  <p>At a nod from Vasantasena eight girls returned to the window-seat and one
  stood still. She was the same who had admitted Maitraya and Ommony, only now
  all her self-possession had departed; she seemed to fear the Lama as a
  cornered dove fears a snake. She was trembling.</p>

  <p>"Why are you afraid?" the Lama asked, as gently as if he were talking to a
  woman he would woo; but the girl made a gesture to her mistress for
  protection from him.</p>

  <p>"She is afraid because you have read rightly," said Vasantasena. "I, too,
  am afraid. Are you in league with gods or devils?"</p>

  <p>"That is not well," said the Lama. "Whom have I harmed?"</p>

  <p>"You are too wise," said Vasantasena.</p>

  <p>"Macauley the Eurasian had the stone," the Lama went on in a booming
  voice. "A certain person gave it to him in a package yesterday, to take it to
  Simla and thence to Tilgaun. That would have been well. But Macauley the
  Eurasian was weak and dallied with a woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No Eurasian has ever been in my house!" Vasantasena interrupted,
  flaring.</p>

  <p>"And the woman had a husband; and the husband was a Sudra* who was seeking
  education from a Brahmin, so he gave the piece of jade to him. And the
  Brahmin came hither, and boasted&mdash;and took opium&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Sudra</i>&mdash;the lowest of the four great Hindu
  castes, which in fact, although not always in theory, includes many of the
  merchants and artisan classes, and some agriculturists. Some Brahmins consent
  to teach members of the Sudra caste because of the enormous "gifts" they
  receive for doing so, but the practice is frowned on by the pundits and the
  guilty Brahmins are considered degraded, although not outcasts.]</p>

  <p>"He brought the drug with him. I never gave any man opium!" Vasantasena
  interrupted.</p>

  <p>"And she took the stone from him and brought it to you. All this in the
  space of one night," said the Lama.</p>

  <p>"But how do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I do know."</p>

  <p>"How do you know it was this girl?"</p>

  <p>"She is the only one who would have given it to you. Any of the others
  would have kept it."</p>

  <p>Ommony managed to master his emotions somehow, but it was not easy, for
  here was proof of a system of spying that out-spied the Secret Service. How
  had the Lama learned that the stone had been entrusted to McGregor, to be
  given in turn to Macauley, to be taken to Tilgaun? Given that much
  information in the first place it might have been comparatively easy to trace
  the stone afterward, but&mdash;McGregor had surely not talked. Macauley and
  McGregor's sais were the only possibilities.</p>

  <p>Vasantasena groped under the cushions and brought out the piece of jade
  &mdash;the same piece that had been in Ommony's possession; there was no
  mistaking its peculiar shape, or the deep-sea green translucence. The
  expression of Samding's face changed for a moment; he actually blinked and
  smiled, and the smile was as attractive as the marvel of the stone.
  Vasantasena noticed it.</p>

  <p>"Give me your chela in exchange!" she said suddenly. "I could endure that
  chela! He is almost fit to be a god. He needs only passion to awaken him. I
  cannot understand this stone, which makes me dizzy to look into it, and dark
  with fear of myself. The chela makes me feel there is a future. I can look
  into his eyes and know that all wisdom is attainable. I will teach him
  passion, and he shall teach me pure desire."</p>

  <p>The Lama chuckled engagingly. His wrinkles multiplied and his smile was as
  full of amusement as a Chinese fisherman's. "Ask him," he said.</p>

  <p>Vasantasena smiled at Samding&mdash;that same smile that had explained the
  secret of her influence. It promised unrestraint, indulgence without limit,
  and thereafter forgiveness. She held up the stone in her right hand, ready to
  exchange.</p>

  <p>"A bargain?" she asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"No"&mdash;one monosyllable, abrupt and clear&mdash;F natural exactly in
  the middle of the note. A golden gong could not have answered more finally or
  with less regard for consequences.</p>

  <p>Vasantasena started as if stung. Her eyes flashed and her mood changed
  into savagery like a stirred snake's. The girl who was still standing before
  her shrank and half-smothered a scream. Maitraya ducked instantly with his
  face behind his hands. Vasantasena flung the stone at Samding straight and
  hard. It struck him in the breast, but if it hurt, he gave no sign. He
  covered the stone with both hands for a moment, as if caressing it, wiped it
  carefully on a corner of his robe, and passed it to the Lama, who secreted it
  in his bosom as matter-of-factly as if the entire proceeding were exactly
  what he had expected.</p>

  <p>"Go!" Vasantasena ordered hoarsely. "Begone from here! Never darken my
  door again! Go, all of you&mdash;you, and you&mdash;what is a dog of an actor
  doing here? A Bhat! A Bhat&mdash;a casteless Brahmin! You defile my house! A
  gang of devil-worshipers! Girls&mdash;call the men-servants and throw them
  out!"</p>

  <p>But the Lama was quite unhurried. He got up from the mat and blessed
  Vasantasena sonorously in Tibetan, which she did not understand; it might
  have been a curse for all she knew. Samding rolled up the mat. Maitraya got
  behind the Lama for protection; and the girls hesitated to obey the order to
  use violence on anyone as sacred as a Lama, or as dangerous as a Bhat. The
  Lama led the way out of the room with his skirts swinging majestically, and
  Ommony brought up the rear, aware that the danger was by no means over. He
  paused in the door and met Vasantasena's furious stare.</p>

  <p>"Shall I summon the guests from below?" he inquired; for that was the one
  risk he wanted to avoid. If he proposed it, she might forbid. "They would
  like to hear me sing a song of this!" he added.</p>

  <p>"Go!" she screamed. "I will have you stabbed! I will have you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shall I sing to them in the courtyard?" he asked; and as she choked,
  trying to force new threats out of her throat, he shut the door behind him
  and hurried to follow the Lama, dreading what mood might overtake her during
  the minute or two before they could reach the street.</p>

  <p>But the Lama would not make haste, although Maitraya urged him in sibilant
  undertones. In the courtyard he chose to think the greetings called out to
  Maitraya were intended for himself and bowed, bestowing blessings right and
  left. Then solemnly and very slowly, as if walking were as mathematically
  exact a process as the precession of the equinox, he led the way into the
  outer courtyard, where he stood for a moment and studied the fountain as if
  it contained the answer to the riddle of the universe. The sound of running
  footsteps did not break his meditation, or upset the equanimity of Samding,
  but Maitraya, glancing over-shoulder, started for the gate, and Ommony,
  muttering "Oh, my God!" had to steel himself not to follow. The two enormous
  sashed and turbaned janitors who kept the stairway to Vasantasena's upper
  room came shouting from the inner court&mdash;shouting to the man on guard at
  the outer gate; and Ommony's blood ran cold.</p>

  <p>But they stopped shouting when they caught sight of the Lama&mdash;
  stopped running&mdash;stopped gesticulating. Very humbly they approached him,
  offering a present from Vasantasena&mdash;gold in a silken bag, and a smaller
  bag of gold for Gupta Rao the Bhat, with a request that he should remember
  the donor kindly. They pressed the presents&mdash;followed to the gate,
  imploring, swearing their mistress would take deep offense and think it an
  ill-omen if the gold were not accepted. When the Lama and Ommony persisted in
  refusing they tried to force both presents on Samding, and even followed to
  the street; where they snatched the flowers that were tucked into the carving
  of the arch and thrust them into the Lama's hands. Not until a strange, old
  -fashioned one-horse carriage with shuttered sides drew up at the gate and
  the Lama and Samding stepped into it, signing to Ommony and Maitraya to
  follow, was it possible to escape from the clamorous importunity; and even
  when the carriage drove away the voices followed after.</p>

  "All things end&mdash;even carriage rides."</h2>

  <p class="quote">The man who knows he is ignorant is at no disadvantage if he
  permits a wise man to do the thinking; because the wise man knows that
  neither advantage to one or disadvantage to another comes at all within the
  scope of wisdom, and he will govern himself accordingly. But he who seeks to
  outwit wisdom adds to ignorance presumption; and that is a combination that
  the gods do not love.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THE HEAT inside the carriage was stifling. No breeze came
  through the slats that formed the sides, but they had the advantage that one
  could see out, and sufficient light streamed through to show the Lama's face
  distinctly at close quarters. The Lama sat perched on the rear seat with
  Samding beside him, both of them cross-legged like Buddhas, but the front
  seat was as narrow as a knife-board, and in the space between there was
  hardly room for Ommony's and Maitraya's legs. Faces were so close that the
  utmost exercise of polite manners could hardly have prevented staring, and
  Ommony took full advantage of it.</p>

  <p>But the Lama seemed unconscious of being looked at, making no effort to
  avoid Ommony's eyes, although Samding kept his face averted and stared
  between the slats at the crowd on the sidewalks. The Lama's eyes were
  motionless, fixed on vacancy somewhere through Ommony's head and beyond it;
  they were blue eyes, not brown as might have been expected&mdash;blue aging
  into gray&mdash;the color of the northern sky on windy afternoons.</p>

  <p>The horse clop-clopped along the paved street leisurely, the clink of a
  loose shoe adding a tantalizing punctuation to the rhythm, and a huge
  blow-fly buzzed disgustingly until it settled at last on the Lama's nose.</p>

  <p>"That is not the right place," he remarked then in excellent English, and
  with a surprisingly deft motion of his right hand slapped the fly out through
  the slats. He smiled at Ommony, who pretended not to understand him; for the
  most important thing at the moment seemed to be to discover whether or not
  the Lama had guessed his identity and, if not, to preserve the secret as long
  as possible. From a pouch at his waist that Benjamin had thoughtfully
  provided he produced pan* and began to chew it&mdash;an offensive habit that
  he hated, but one that every Brahmin practices. The Lama spoke again, this
  time in Urdu:</p>

  <p>"Flies," he said, in a voice as if he were teaching school, "are like evil
  thoughts that seem to come from nowhere. Kill them, and others come. They
  must be kept out, and their source looked for and destroyed."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>pan</i>&mdash;a preparation of betel-nut.]</p>

  <p>"It is news to me," said Ommony, in his best Bhat-Brahmin tone of voice,
  "that people from Tibet know the laws of sanitation. Now I have studied them,
  for I lean to the modern view of things. Flies breed in dunghills and rotten
  meat, from larvae that devour the solids therein contained."</p>

  <p>"Even as sin breeds in a man's mind from curiosity that devours virtue,"
  said the Lama. He did not smile, but there was an inflection in his voice
  that suggested he had thought of smiling. Ommony improvised a perfectly good
  Brahmin answer:</p>

  <p>"Without curiosity progress would cease," he asserted, well knowing that
  was untrue but bent on proving he was someone he was not. The Lama knew
  Cottswold Ommony for a thoughtful man (for twenty years' correspondence must
  have demonstrated that) and, if not profound, at least acquainted with
  profundity; and it is men's expressions of opinion more often than mechanical
  mistakes that betray disguises, so he didactically urged an opinion that he
  did not entertain.</p>

  <p>"Without curiosity, nine-tenths of sin would cease. The other tenth would
  be destroyed by knowledge," the Lama replied. Whereat he took snuff in huge
  quantities from a wonderful old silver box.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going?" asked Ommony suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I have disposed of curiosity." The Lama dismissed the question with one
  firm horizontal movement of his right hand.</p>

  <p>"I have a servant, to whom I must send a message," Ommony objected.</p>

  <p>"The chela may take it."</p>

  <p>Ommony glanced at Samding and the calm eyes met his without wavering; yet
  he did not have the Lama's trick of seeming to look through a person. Perhaps
  youth had something to do with that. His gaze betrayed interest in an object,
  whereas the Lama's looked behind, beyond, as if he could see causes.</p>

  <p>Ommony sat still, grateful for the silence, thinking furiously. He had
  witnessed proof that the Lama commanded a spy-system perfectly capable of
  discovering even the secret moves of McGregor. The odds were therefore ten to
  one that he knew exactly who was sitting in the carriage facing him. Samding
  had read the name Ommony on Diana's collar in Chutter Chand's shop. The
  letter from the Lama had been delivered to Mrs. Cornock-Campbell's house.
  Benjamin was the Lama's secret agent, as well as more or less openly his man
  of business. Viewed in all its bearings, it would be almost a miracle if the
  Lama did not at least suspect the real identity of the Bhat-Brahmin who sat
  chewing betel-nut in front of him.</p>

  <p>And the Lama now had the piece of jade for which ostensibly he had come
  all the way to Delhi. Moreover, he had known where it was, at least for
  several hours. Then why did he continue to submit to being spied on? Why had
  he not, for instance, stepped into the carriage and driven away, leaving
  Ommony on the sidewalk outside Vasantasena's? That would have been perfectly
  easy. Or he could have denounced Ommony in Vasantasena's presence, with
  consequences at the hands of the assembled guests that would have been at
  least drastic, and perhaps deadly. If the Lama really did know who was
  sitting in the carriage with him, the mystery was increased rather than
  clarified.</p>

  <p>And now there was the problem of Dawa Tsering and the dog. Ommony wished
  for the moment he had made some other arrangement&mdash;until he realized the
  futility of making any effort to conceal what the Lama almost certainly
  already knew. He might have left the dog with McGregor, and have had Dawa
  Tsering confined in jail, but he would have lost two important allies by
  doing it. A man with a "knife" and a dog with a terrific set of teeth might
  turn out to be as good as guardian angels.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Lama might be planning to disappear along the
  mysterious "Middle Way" that baffles all detection. If so, the dog and Dawa
  Tsering might be exceedingly useful in tracing him. If the offer to send
  Samding with a message were not a trick, it would at least acquaint the dog
  with Samding's smell; and it might be that the Lama was ignorant about a
  trained dog's hunting ability.</p>

  <p>Finally, as the carriage dawdled through the sun-baked, thronging streets,
  Ommony reached the conclusion that he had been guided by intuition when he
  gave orders to Dawa Tsering. A man who has lived in a forest for the greater
  part of twenty years, and has studied native life and nature in the raw as
  methodically as Ommony had done, achieves a faith in intuition that persists
  in the face of much that is called evidence. He decided to carry on, at least
  one step farther, trusting again to intuition that assured him he was not in
  serious danger and wondering whether the Lama was not quite as puzzled as
  himself. He glanced at the Lama's face, hoping to detect a trace of
  worry.</p>

  <p>But the Lama was asleep. He was sleeping as serenely as a child, with his
  head drooped forward and his shoulders leaning back into the corner. Samding
  made a signal not to waken him.</p>

  <p>The carriage dawdled on. The Lama stirred, glanced through the slats to
  find out where they were, and dozed away again. The streets grew narrower,
  and then broadened into unpaved roads that wandered between high walls and
  shuttered windows, in a part of Delhi that Ommony only knew by hearsay and
  from books. It was shabbily exclusive&mdash;drab&mdash;with plaster peeling
  from old-fashioned houses and an air of detachment from excitement in all
  forms. Here and there a Moslem minaret uprose above surrounding flat roofs,
  and trees peeped over the wall of a crowded cemetery. They were going
  northward, toward where the ruins of really ancient Delhi shelter thieves and
  jackals in impenetrable scrub and mounds of debris; a district where anything
  might happen and no official be a word the wiser.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the carriage checked and turned between high walls into an alley
  with a gate at the farther end. The driver cried aloud with a voice like a
  prophet of despair announcing the end of all things; the double gate swung
  wide, not more than a yard in advance of the horse's nose; paved stones rang
  underfoot; the gates slammed shut; and the Lama came to life, opening first
  one eye, then the other.</p>

  <p>"All things end&mdash;even carriage-rides," he said in English, looking
  hard at Ommony. But Ommony was still of the opinion it was better to pretend
  he did not understand that language.</p>

  <p>Somebody opened the carriage door from outside&mdash;a Tibetan, all smiles
  and benedictions, robed like a medieval monk&mdash;who chattered so fast in a
  northern dialect that Ommony could not make head or tail of it. Samding cut
  short the flow of speech by pushing past him, followed by Maitraya. Ommony
  got out next, his eyes blinded for the moment by sunlight off the white stone
  walls of a courtyard; and before he could take in the scene the carriage
  containing the Lama moved on again and disappeared through a gate under an
  arch in a barrack-like building: the gate was pulled shut after it by someone
  on the inside.</p>

  <p>It was a four-square courtyard, dazzling white, paved with ancient stones,
  surrounded on three sides by a cloister supported on wooden posts, on to
  which tall narrow doors opened at unequal intervals. There was no attempt at
  ornament, but the place had a sort of stern dignity and looked as if it might
  originally have been a khan for northern travelers. The windows on the walls
  above the cloister roof were all shuttered with slatted blinds, and there
  were no human beings in evidence except Samding, Maitraya and the Tibetan who
  had opened the carriage door; but there were sounds of many voices coming
  from the shuttered window of a room that opened on the cloister.</p>

  <p>Samding stood still, facing Ommony, silent, presumably waiting for the
  message he was to take. Ommony spoke to him in Urdu:</p>

  <p>"Is this our destination? Or do we go elsewhere from here?"</p>

  <p>"Here&mdash;until tomorrow or the next day," said the quiet voice.</p>

  <p>"Do you know your way about Delhi? Can you find your way to Benjamin, the
  Jew's, in the Chandni Chowk? Will you take this handkerchief of mine and go
  to Benjamin's, where you will find a very big dog. Show the handkerchief to
  the dog, and let her smell it. She will follow you to this place."</p>

  <p>Samding smiled engagingly, but incomprehensibly; the smile seemed to
  portend something.</p>

  <p>"Speak louder," he suggested, as if he were deaf and had not heard the
  message.</p>

  <p>Ommony raised his voice almost to a shout; he was irritated by the
  enigmatic smile. His words, as he repeated what he had said, echoed under the
  cloister&mdash;and were answered by a deep-throated bay he could have
  recognized from among the chorus of a dog-pound. A door in the cloister that
  stood ajar flew wide, and Diana came bounding out like a crazy thing, yelping
  and squealing delight to see her master, almost knocking him down and
  smelling him all over from head to foot to make sure it was really he inside
  the unaccustomed garments. And a moment later Dawa Tsering strode out through
  the same door, knife and all, blinking at the sunlight, looking
  half-ashamed.</p>

  <p>Ommony quieted Diana, stared sharply at Dawa Tsering, and turned to
  question Samding. The chela was gone. He just caught sight of his back as he
  vanished through a door under the cloister, twenty feet away. He questioned
  the Tibetan, using Prakrit, but the man appeared not to understand him. Dawa
  Tsering strolled closer, grinning, trying to appear self-confident.</p>

  <p>"O Gupta Rao," he began. But Ommony turned his back.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where we are?" he asked Maitraya.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. This is where my troupe was to assemble. Let us hope they are
  all here and that the Jew has delivered the costumes."</p>

  <p>"O you, Gupta Rao," Dawa Tsering insisted, laying a heavy hand on Ommony's
  shoulder from behind to call attention to himself, "listen to me: that dog of
  yours is certainly a devil, and the Jew is a worse devil, and that man there
  &mdash;" (he pointed at the Tibetan) "&mdash;is the father of them both! You
  had not left the Jew's store longer than a man would need to scratch himself,
  when that fellow entered and talked with the Jew. I also talked with the Jew;
  I bade him supply me with garments according to your command, and two pairs
  of blankets and a good, heavy yak-hair cloak; and there were certain other
  things I saw that I became aware I needed. But the Jew said that this fellow
  had brought word that you had changed your mind regarding me, and that I was
  to go elsewhere with him. I gave him the lie. I told him who was father of
  them both, and what their end would be, and they said many things. So I
  helped myself to a yak-hair cloak, a good one, and lo, I have it with me; and
  I also picked out one pair of blankets of a sort such as are not to be had in
  Spiti; and with those and the cloak and some trifles I encumbered myself, so
  that neither hand was free.</p>

  <p>"And while I was looking to see what else was important to a man of your
  standing and my needs, lo, the Jew took the socks you had left behind and
  gave them to this rascal; and the son of unforgivable offenses showed them to
  the dog, who forthwith followed him, notwithstanding that I called her many
  names. He led her out of the shop, and I after him with both arms full, and
  the Jew after me because of the blankets and what not else. And lo, there was
  a cart outside having four wheels and sides like the shutters of a te-rain
  only not made to slide up and down. And the door was at the rear. And there
  into he led the dog, she following the socks, and I after both of them to
  bring the dog back. And lo, no sooner was I within the cart&mdash;not more
  than my head and shoulders were within it&mdash;than two men like this one,
  only bigger, seized me and wrapped me in my own blankets and bound me fast,
  taking my knife.</p>

  <p>"So they brought me to this place, where they dragged me into that room
  yonder and released me, returning my knife to me and saying such was your
  order. And if they had not returned my knife I would have fought them; but as
  they did return it, and said it was your order, and as the dog appeared
  satisfied, because they threw the socks to her to guard, it seemed to me
  there might be something in it after all. Did you give such an order? Or
  shall I slay these men?"</p>

  <p>"Have you been here before?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, two or three times. This is not a bad place, and there is lots
  to eat, well buttered, with plenty of onions. This is a place where they
  think the Lama Tsiang Samdup is of more importance than a belly-full. But
  they eat notwithstanding&mdash;thrice daily&mdash;and much. But tell me: did
  you give such an order&mdash;to have me brought here?"</p>

  <p>Ommony had a flash of inspiration. "The man mistook the order," he
  answered. (Maitraya was listening; he did not want to take Maitraya into
  confidence.) "I will tell you later what I intend to do about it. Meanwhile,
  keep silence, keep close to the dog, and keep an eye on me."</p>

  <p>But Maitraya was growing more than curious, although he did not understand
  the Prakrit dialect that Dawa Tsering used.</p>

  <p>"What is a Bhat-Brahmin doing with such a servant?" he asked, stroking his
  chin, cocking his head to one side like a parrot that sees sugar.</p>

  <p>Ommony fell back on the excuse that Benjamin invented:</p>

  <p>"You were told. He attends to my little affairs of the heart. Isn't the
  real puzzle, what is he doing with such a master? Why are we standing here?
  The sun overpowers me."</p>

  <p>Maitraya led the way toward the room whence the voices emerged and the
  Tibetan, seeing they knew where to go, took himself off in the opposite
  direction. Excepting Dawa Tsering, there were no armed men in evidence; the
  double gate that opened on the alley was barred, but there was no padlock on
  the bars, and no guard; it looked as if escape, if once determined on, would
  be simple enough. If the place was a prison, its system for detaining
  prisoners was extremely artfully concealed; there did not appear to be even
  the sort of passive vigilance employed in monasteries.</p>

  <p>Maitraya crossed the cloister, opened a door near the window whence the
  voices came, kicked it so that it swung inward with a bang against the wall,
  and made an effective stage-entry into a dim enormous room. There was a long
  row of slippers on the threshold, and he kicked those aside to make room for
  his own with a leg-gesture that was quite good histrionics.</p>

  <p>Six men, three women and two boys, who had been sitting with their backs
  against a wall, stood up to greet him. They were a rather sorry-looking
  group, dowdy and travel-worn, without an expensive garment or a really clean
  turban among them; but that was another form of histrionics; there were
  bundles on the floor containing finery they did not choose to show yet, lest
  the sight of it might prevent their paymaster, for his own pride's sake, from
  fitting them out with new, clean clothing. Maitraya looked disgusted. He knew
  that ancient method of extortion and assessed it for what it was worth.</p>

  <p>"Such a rabble! Such a band of mendicants!" he exclaimed. "I am ashamed to
  present you to his honor the learned Brahmin Gupta Rao, who will play leading
  parts in our company! He will think it is a company of street-sweepers!"</p>

  <p>They bowed to Ommony, murmuring "Pranam," and he blessed them
  perfunctorily. It was more important at the moment to examine the room
  carefully than to make friends with outcaste actors, who pretend to
  themselves that they despise a Brahmin, but actually fear one like the devil
  if he takes, and keeps, the upper hand.</p>

  <p>The room was about thirty-five feet broad by ninety feet long, extremely
  high and beamed and cross-beamed with adze-trimmed timbers as heavy as the
  deck-beams of a sailing ship. There was a faint suggestion of a smell of
  grain and gunny-bags. Along one end, to the right of the door, was a
  platform, not more than four feet high nor eight feet deep, with a door in
  the wall at the end of it farthest from the courtyard; on the platform was a
  clean Tibetan prayer mat.</p>

  <p>The walls were bare, of stone reinforced by heavy timbers, and the only
  furniture or ornaments consisted of heavy brass chandeliers suspended on
  brass chains from the ceiling and brass sconces fastened to the timbers of
  the walls. The place was fairly clean, except for wasp's nests and grease on
  the floor and walls where the illuminating medium had dripped. There were no
  prayer-wheels, images of gods, or anything to suggest a religious atmosphere,
  which nevertheless prevailed, perhaps because of the austerity.</p>

  <p>Ommony decided to try the platform; as a Bhat-Brahmin he had perfect
  authority for being impudent, and as a man of ordinary good sense he was
  justified in taking Dawa Tsering with him, to keep that individual out of
  mischief; so he beckoned to the dog and Dawa Tsering, climbed to the platform
  by means of some pegs stuck there for the purpose, and checked an exclamation
  of surprise. The trunk full of clothes that he had ordered from Benjamin
  stood unopened in the far dark corner of the platform, where almost no light
  penetrated. It was strapped, locked, sealed with a leaden disk, and the key
  hung down from the handle.</p>

  <p>He determined then and there to waste no further effort on conjecture. The
  Lama knew who he was. Benjamin was the informer. Probably on one of the
  occasions when Benjamin went shuffling along the passage by the staircase in
  front of his store he had sent a message to the Lama. Luck must favor him now
  or not, as the Powers who measure out the luck should see fit. He sat down
  cross-legged in deep shadow on top of the trunk, which creaked under his
  weight, signed to Dawa Tsering to be seated upon the floor, watched Diana
  curl herself in patient boredom in the shadow beside him, leaned into the
  corner, listened to the chattering of the actors and to Maitraya's pompous
  scolding, and presently fell asleep. Not having slept at all the previous
  night, he judged it was ridiculous to stay awake and worry. Opportunity is
  meant for wise men's seizing.</p>

  are supposed to be descended. ]<br>
  [ &dagger;Karma&mdash;The Law of Cause and Effect, governing the consequences

  <p class="first">HOW LONG Ommony slept he did not know, but probably for at
  least an hour. At first his doze was broken by the sound of the actors'
  voices, but after a while they may have slept too for lack of better
  entertainment; the buzz of conversation ceased and he was left to the pursuit
  of unquiet dreams, in which the Lama plotted and disputed with Vasantasena
  for possession of Samding in a place in which there was a fountain brim-full
  of golden mohurs.</p>

  <p>He awoke quietly after a while, that being habit, and noticed that Diana's
  tail was thumping a friendly salute on the platform floor. The next thing he
  saw was the Lama sitting motionless on the prayer mat, with Samding as usual
  beside him. Below them, on the floor of the room, stood Maitraya looking
  upward. The gabble of angry argument that he caught between sleeping and
  waking made no clear impression on his brain. The first words he heard
  distinctly were the Lama's, speaking Urdu:</p>

  <p>"My son, you are convinced of a delusion. That is not good. You believe
  you are answerable for results, whereas you are not even connected with the
  cause. You have but to obey. It is I who am burdened with the tribulation of
  deciding how this matter shall be managed, since I conceived it. From you
  there is required good will and whatever talent you possess for your
  profession."</p>

  <p>The voice was kind, but it did not allay Maitraya's wrath. He scolded
  back.</p>

  <p>"I am famous! I am known wherever we will go. Men will mock me! Am I to be
  a common mountebank? Vishnu! Vishnu! Why engage me, if you won't listen when
  I tell you the proper way to do a thing, and what the public will accept and
  what it will not accept?"</p>

  <p>The Lama listened patiently, not changing his expression, which was bland
  and gently whimsical.</p>

  <p>"All ways are proper in their proper place. Men will usually take what
  they receive for nothing," he answered after a pause. "As for your
  dissatisfaction, you may go, my son. You may go to Benjamin, and he shall pay
  you one week's money."</p>

  <p>"I have a contract!" Maitraya retorted, posturing like Ajax defying
  lightning.</p>

  <p>"That is true," said the Lama gently. "There would be merit in observing
  the terms of it."</p>

  <p>Maitraya smote his breast, disheveled his turban desperately and turned to
  throw an appealing gesture to the troupe. But they were a hungry-looking lot,
  more interested in being fed and paid than in Maitraya's artistic anxieties.
  The Lama looked kind and spoke gently. In silence, with eye-movements, they
  took the Lama's side of the dispute.</p>

  <p>"Prostitutes!" exclaimed Maitraya in a frenzy. "You will make apes of
  yourselves for the sake of two months' wage! Oh, very well. I will out-ape
  you! I will be a worse ape than the one who ate the fruit out of the Buddha's
  begging bowl! Behold me&mdash;Maitraya, the prostitute! I will be infamous,
  to fill your miserable bellies!" Then, facing the Lama again with a gesture
  of heartbroken anguish: "But this that you ask is impossible! It is not done
  &mdash;never! My genius might overcome a difficulty, but how can these fools
  do what they have never learned?"</p>

  <p>"How does the wolf-cub know where to look for milk?" the Lama answered,
  and all laughed, except Maitraya, who tried to rearrange his turban. A woman
  finished the business for him, grinning in his face as boldly as if there
  were the slats of a zenana* window in between.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>zenana</i> (Hindi)&mdash;the part of a house in
  Asian countries reserved for the women of the household.]</p>

  <p>"Do you observe that woman?" Dawa Tsering whispered to Ommony. "Now if she
  were in Spiti there would be knife-work within the day. She lacks awareness
  of what might be!"</p>

  <p>Aware that he, too, lacked that most desirable of assets at the moment,
  Ommony frowned for silence. There was just a chance that he might pick up a
  clue to a part of the mystery if he should attract no attention to himself.
  Maitraya&mdash;supposing he knew anything&mdash;was in a frame of mind to
  explode a secret at any moment. He was blowing up again.</p>

  <p>"Krishna! By the many eyes of Krishna, I swear to you that some of them
  cannot read!" he shouted, strutting to and fro and pausing to throw both arms
  upward in a gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"Krishna is a comprehensive Power to swear by," said the Lama mildly. "How
  many cannot read?"</p>

  <p>Two women confessed to disability; the third boasted her attainment
  proudly.</p>

  <p>"Not so insuperable!" said the Lama. "That one woman shall read for the
  three. Thus the two will learn. Give their parts to them. They have almost
  nothing to say in the first act."</p>

  <p>Samding picked up a dozen wooden cylinders with paper scrolls wrapped
  around them and bundled the lot into Maitraya's hands.</p>

  <p>"We must cast them," said Maitraya. "The cast is all-important. Who shall
  play which part? It is essential to decide that to begin with."</p>

  <p>"No," said the Lama, "the essential thing is that every one shall
  understand the play. Give the women's parts to that woman. Distribute the
  others at random."</p>

  <p>Maitraya, with a shrug, chose the biggest scroll for himself and
  distributed the others. Samding beckoned to Dawa Tsering, who got up
  leisurely as if in doubt whether obedience was not infra dig, now that he had
  changed masters. Samding gave him a scroll, which he carried to Ommony, but
  neither Samding nor the Lama gave a glance in Ommony's direction.</p>

  <p>The scroll was written in Urdu in a fine and beautifully even hand,
  heavily corrected here and there by someone who had used a quill pen. It
  looked as if Samding might have written and the Lama, perhaps, revised. There
  was no title at the head, but the part was marked "The Saddhu,"* and the cues
  were carefully included. To get light enough to read by Ommony sat at the
  edge of the platform with his face toward the Lama, and presently began to
  chuckle. There were lines he liked, loaded with irony.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>saddhu, sadhu</i> (Hindi)&mdash;In Hinduism, an
  ascetic or practitioner of yoga (yogi) who has given up pursuit of the first
  three Hindu goals of life: kama (pleasure), artha (wealth and power) and even
  dharma (duty). The sadhu is solely dedicated to achieving moksha (liberation)
  through meditation and contemplation of God. Although the term Sadhu has its
  roots in Hinduism it is also used for followers of other religions, if they
  live a Sadhu life. <i>Wikipedia</i>.]</p>

  <p>There followed a long silence while Maitraya glanced over his own fat part
  and consulted stage directions in the margin; it was he who first broke
  silence:</p>

  <p>"O ye critical and all-observing gods!" he exclaimed. "This is modernism,
  is it! Who will listen to a play that only has one king in it, and no queen,
  and no courtiers&mdash;but a shoe-maker, and a goat-herd, and a seller of
  sweetmeats, and three low-caste-women with water-jars, and only one soldier
  &mdash;he not a general but a sepoy, if you please!&mdash;and a wandering
  saddhu, and no vizier to support the king, but a tax-gatherer and a camel-
  driver, and a village headman, and two farmers&mdash;and for heroine
  &mdash;what kind of a heroine is this? A Chinese woman! And what a name!
  San-fun-ho! Bah! Who will listen to the end of such a play?"</p>

  <p>"I will be the first to listen," said the Lama dryly. "Let us begin
  reading."</p>

  <p>"And not even a marriage at the end!" Maitraya growled disgustedly. "None
  marries the king&mdash;not even the Chinese woman and her pigtail! No gods
  &mdash;one goddess! Not even a Brahmin! How do you like that, Gupta Rao? Not
  as much as one Brahmin to give the play dignity! What part have you? The
  saddhu's?Let us hope it is a better part than mine. Listen to this: I am a
  king. I enter right, one sepoy following. (O Vishnu! Thy sharp beams burn! A
  king, and one sepoy for escort!) The sweetmeat seller enters left. Back of
  the stage the Chinese woman is beside a well under a pipul-tree, talking with
  three women who carry water-jars&mdash;and may the gods explain how a Chinese
  woman comes to be there! I address the sweetmeat seller. Listen:</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>pipul, pipal</i>&mdash;a fig tree (Ficus religiosa)
  native to India, having broadly ovate leaves with a long terminal projection.
  It is regarded as sacred by Buddhists. Also called bo tree. <i>American
  Heritage Dictionary</i>.]</p>

  <p>"'Thou, who sellest evanescent joy&mdash;and possibly enduring bellyache
  &mdash;to little ones, what hast thou to offer to me, who am in need of many
  things?'&mdash;What do you think of that for a speech for a king to make his
  entry with?"</p>

  <p>"To which, what says the sweetmeat seller?" asked the Lama. "Who has the
  sweetmeat seller's part? Read on."</p>

  <p>They sat down in a semicircle on the floor, Maitraya standing in the midst
  of them, and one of the men read matter-of-factly:</p>

  <p>"'Mightiest of kings, thy servant is a poor man, needing money to pay the
  municipal tax. May all the gods instruct me how to answer! Who am I that I
  should offer anything to the owner of all these leagues of forest and flowing
  stream and royal cities? An alms, O image of the sun?'"</p>

  <p>"If he were a real king, and this a real play," Maitraya exclaimed,
  consulting the directions, "he would order that sweetmeat seller into jail
  for impudence! But what does he do? He looks sad, gives the fellow an alms,
  and turns to face the women at the well. How can he do that? I tell you, he
  must face the audience. Are they interested in his back? And this is what he
  says:</p>

  <p>"'Bearers of refreshment! Ye who walk so straight beneath the water-jars!
  Ye who laugh and tell a city's gossip! Ye who bring new men into the world!
  What have ye to offer me, whose heart is heavy? Lo, I bring forth sorrow amid
  many midwives. Wherewith shall I suckle it?'&mdash;It is just at this point
  that the audience begins to walk out!" said Maitraya.</p>

  <p>"A woman speaks. What says the woman?" boomed the Lama; and the woman who
  could read held her scroll to the light, speaking sidewise, jerking her head
  at the Lama, as if he were the king.</p>

  <p>"'O Maharajah, thy servants are but women, who must toil the day long; and
  the water-jars are heavy! If we bring no man into the world, we are
  unfortunate; but if we do, we must suckle him, and cook, and keep a house
  clean, and go to the well thrice daily notwithstanding. Lo, the young one
  robs us of our strength and increases our labor. We are women. Who are we to
  offer comfort to a king?'"</p>

  <p>"Enter the saddhu," read Maitraya. "He leans on a staff and salutes the
  king with quiet dignity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The saddhu shall have a dog with him," the Lama interrupted. "Samding,"
  (he glanced sidewise at the chela) "there is merit in the dog. Consider well
  what part the dog may play."</p>

  <p>The chela nodded. He and the Lama seemed to take it quite for granted that
  the dog and her master were obedient members of the troupe.</p>

  <p>"Whoever heard of a dog in a play?" Maitraya grumbled. "Krishna! But the
  very gods will laugh at us! Read, Gupta Rao. What says the saddhu?"</p>

  <p>"'O King, thou art truly to be pitied more than all of these. Mine&mdash;
  the path I take&mdash;is the only way from misery to happiness. Alone of all
  these, I can give advice. Forswear the pomp and glory of a kingdom
  &mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"Pomp&mdash;and one sepoy!" Maitraya exploded.</p>

  <p>"Silence!" commanded the Lama, in a voice that astonished everybody. His
  face was as mild as ever. Ommony continued:</p>

  <p>"'&mdash; Discard the scepter. Let the reins of despotism fall, and follow
  me. I mortify the flesh. I eat no more than keeps the body servant to the
  soul. No house, no revenues are mine, no other goods than this chance-given
  staff to lean on and a ragged robe. None robs me; I have no wealth to steal.
  None troubles me, for who could gain by it? I sleep under the skies, or crawl
  into a cave and share it with the beasts; for they and I, even as thou and I,
  O King, are brothers.'"</p>

  <p>"Now the king speaks," said Maitraya. "Listen to this! 'Brothers? Yes; but
  someone has to beat the ox. And who shall rule the kingdom, if the ass and
  the jackal and the pigeon and the kite are reckoned equals with the king?
  Answer me that, O Saddhu.'"</p>

  <p>"'Rule?'" read Ommony. "'Are the gods not equal to the task? What is this
  world but a passage to the next&mdash;a place wherein to let the storms of
  Karma pass and store up holiness? Beware, O King!'"</p>

  <p>"The saddhu passes on, turns and stands meditating," Maitraya read,
  consulting his scroll. "A shoemaker approaches. What says the shoemaker?"</p>

  <p>"He salutes the king," said the Lama, "and walks up to the soldier. Now,
  let the shoemaker speak."</p>

  <p>A voice piped up from the floor; "'Thou with the long sword, pay me or
  kill me!'"</p>

  <p>"He turns to the king," the Lama interrupted, "read on."</p>

  <p>"'&mdash; O mighty king, O heaven-born companion of the gods! This sepoy
  owes me for a pair of shoes. Nor will he pay. Nor have I any remedy, since
  all fear him and none will give evidence against him. I am poor, O prince of
  valor. May the gods answer if there is any justice in the world! As I am an
  honest laborer, there is none!'"</p>

  <p>"To which the king answers," said Maitraya, "'True. And if you were king,
  what would you do about it?'"</p>

  <p>The shoemaker: "'Ah! If I were king!'"</p>

  <p>"Now," said the Lama, "a crowd collects. They enter left and right, the
  tax-gatherer, the goatherd, the farmers, the camel-driver and the village
  headman. They all make complaints to the king."</p>

  <p>"A crowd of seven people!" sneered Maitraya.</p>

  <p>"There are dancing women also," said the Lama. "They are not wanted to
  dance until later; therefore they may take part in the crowd in various
  disguises. They have nothing to say. Read on."</p>

  <p>Maitraya read: "'The crowd salutes the king, and the saddhu watches
  scornfully; the saddhu speaks.' Read on, Gupta Rao."</p>

  <p>"'So many men and women, so many fools! Waves crying to an empty boat to
  guide them! O ye men and women, children of delusion and blind slaves of
  appetite, how long will ye store up wrath against the hour of
  reckoning?'"</p>

  <p>"Now the shoemaker," said the Lama.</p>

  <p>"'Tell us how to collect our debts, thou Saddhu! Tell us how to feed our
  young ones! To that we will listen!'"</p>

  <p>"Now the tax-collector."</p>

  <p>"'Tell me how to get the tax-money from men who declare they have nothing!
  Tell me how to conduct a government without a revenue! Tell me what will
  happen if I fail, O mouther of Mantras!'"*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>mantra</i>&mdash;a verse from the Vedas; any spoken
  charm or religious formula.]</p>

  <p>"The king," said the Lama, and Maitraya spoke with the scroll behind him,
  to prove how swiftly he could memorize.</p>

  <p>"'Peace, all of you! Ye little know how fortunate ye are to have a king
  whose only will is that the realm shall ooze contenting justice. Day and
  night my meditation is to spread contentment through the land. Is this your
  gratitude?'"</p>

  <p>The Saddhu: "'To whom? For what?"' Ommony's voice charged the line with
  sarcasm that made the Lama glance at him.</p>

  <p>"A farmer," said Maitraya.</p>

  <p>"'The locusts spread through the land, and there is no ooze of dew, nor
  any rain. The crops have failed; and nevertheless, the tax-gatherer! He fails
  not with his visits! Meditate a little on the tax-gatherer, O King.'"</p>

  <p>The Saddhu: "'Aye, meditate!'"</p>

  <p>"A camel-driver," said Maitraya.</p>

  <p>"'O King, they wait beside the mother-camel for the unborn calf. They take
  from us in taxes at the frontier more than the freight is worth. We fetch and
  carry, but the profit of the labor goeth to the rich. Our very tents are worn
  until the women can no longer patch them."</p>

  <p>The Saddhu: "'Live in caves, O brother of the wind!'"</p>

  <p>"The shoemaker," said Maitraya.</p>

  <p>"'And the owner of goats charges twice as much as formerly for
  goatskins!'"</p>

  <p>"The goatherd."</p>

  <p>"'Maybe. But he pays me less than half of what is right for herding
  them!'"</p>

  <p>"The soldier."</p>

  <p>"'Listen, all of you! Behold your king&mdash;a great king and a good one!
  Know ye not the nature of a king? Lo, ye should rally to him and support him!
  A realm is ruled by force of discipline, wherein is strength; and to the
  strong all things are possible! Rally to your king and bid him lead you to a
  war on foreigners, who nibble at our wealth like rats and give us no
  return.'"</p>

  <p>"A woman," said the Lama.</p>

  <p>"'Tell us first, whose sons shall fight this war!'"</p>

  <p>"Another woman."</p>

  <p>"'And who shall console the widows!'"</p>

  <p>The Saddhu: "'The widows of the conquered nation will console them. They
  will naturally see the justice of the war!'"</p>

  <p>"The soldier," said Maitraya. "He shakes his sword at the Saddhu."</p>

  <p>"'Peace, idiot! They will invade us, unless we first attack them. Then in
  which cave will you hide? If I had my way, I would send you in the front rank
  to the war to show us whether your sanctity isn't really cowardice after
  all!'"</p>

  <p>"All laugh at the saddhu," said the Lama. "Now the king." And Maitraya
  postured splendidly.</p>

  <p>" 'Ye men and women, know ye not that I have neither will nor power to
  make war unless ye brew the war within you as a snake brews venom in its
  mouth?'"</p>

  <p>The Saddhu: "'Yet a snake slays vermin!'"</p>

  <p>Maitraya read on: "'Peace, Saddhu! There is merit everywhere. Am I not
  king? And how shall I please all, who so unfairly disagree? Ye see these
  lines that mark my worried brow; ye see this head that bends beneath the
  burden of your care; and ye upbraid me with more tribulations? What if I
  should wreak impatience on you all? Am I alone in travail? Is none among you,
  man or woman, who can offer me a counsel of perfection?'"</p>

  <p>"I!" It was Samding's voice, resonant and splendid yet peculiarly
  unassertive. It was as if the tone included listeners in its embrace. All
  eyes turned to Samding instantly, but he sat motionless.</p>

  <p>"The crowd divides down the midst," said the Lama. "San-fun-ho steps
  forward from beside the well beneath the pipul-tree. She speaks."</p>

  <p>"'O King!'" The chela's voice was not unlike a woman's, although its
  strength suggested it might ripen soon into a royal baritone. "'I come from a
  far land where wisdom dwells and all the problems that can vex were worked to
  a solution in the birth of time. Well said, O King, that there is merit
  everywhere! Well said, ye men and women, that ye have no words nor wealth to
  offer to your king. Nor could he understand, nor could he listen, since the
  ears of kings are deaf to common murmurings, even as your ears are deaf to
  royal overtones. But lo! I bring a talisman&mdash;a stone enchanted by the
  all-wise gods&mdash;whose virtue is to change from dawn to dawn the rank,
  condition, raiment and degree of all who look on it! Avert thine eyes, O
  King! I would not change thy rank, not even while a day and night shall pass.
  Look, Saddhu&mdash;soldier&mdash;goatherd&mdash;women&mdash;all of you!'"</p>

  <p>"She holds up the stone," said the Lama, "and they stare at it in
  superstitious awe. They show astonishment and reverence. Then San-fun-ho
  intones a mantra."</p>

  <p>The chela began to chant in a voice that filled the huge room with golden
  sound, as solemn, lonely and as drenched with music as a requiem to a
  cathedral roof. Without an effort Ommony imagined stained-glass windows and
  an organ-loft. Maitraya bowed his head, and even the other actors, outcaste
  and irreverent, held their breath. It sounded like magic. All India believes
  implicitly in magic. The words were Sanskrit, and probably only Ommony,
  Samding and the Lama understood them; but the ancient, sacred, unintelligible
  language only added to the mystery and made the spell more real.</p>

  <p>None, not even Maitraya, moved or breathed until the chanting ceased. The
  Lama glanced at Ommony, who was so thrilled by the chela's voice as to have
  forgotten for the moment that he held the saddhu's scroll. He looked at it
  and read aloud in solemn tones:</p>

  <p>"'I did not look! I turned mine eyes away!'"</p>

  <p>The King: "'I looked!'" Maitraya put a world of meaning into that
  line.</p>

  <p>"And that," said the Lama, "ends the first act."</p>

  <p>"Too short! Much too short!" exclaimed Maitraya.</p>

  <p>"Too long," said the Lama. "I may have to cut one of your speeches. Now
  there would be merit in the learning of your parts until the gong sounds for
  dinner. After dinner we will take the second act. Peace dwell with you.
  Samding!"</p>

  <p>The chela helped him to his feet, rolled up the mat, and followed him out
  through the door at the end of the platform, where neither of them paused;
  someone on the far side of the door opened it as they drew near, pulled back
  a curtain, admitted them, slammed the door after them, and locked it
  noisily.</p>

  <p>For a moment after that there was no sound. All stared at one another.
  Ommony felt snubbed. He had intended to force an interview with the Lama at
  the end of the rehearsal, but the calm old prelate seemed to have foreseen
  that move!</p>

  <p>"What do you think of it, Gupta Rao?" asked Maitraya.</p>

  <p>"Crafty!" answered Ommony, still thinking of the Lama. "I mean, full of
  craft&mdash;I mean, it is a good play; it will succeed."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps&mdash;if he neglects to charge admission!" said Maitraya. (But he
  seemed tempted to share Ommony's opinion.) "If he would let me give him the
  benefit of my experience, it might be made into a real play," he added. "And
  the chela? What do you think of the chela?"</p>

  <p>"I know!" said Ommony. "He will make all the rest of us, except the dog,
  look and sound like wooden dummies!"</p>

  <p>"There again!" said Maitraya. "The dog! Before you know it he will order
  the chela to write a part for that knife-swinging savage of yours from
  Spiti!"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be surprised. By Vishnu's brow, I wouldn't be surprised at
  anything!" said Ommony, and cut off further conversation by returning to the
  trunk and squatting on it with his back to the light, to study the scroll of
  the saddhu&mdash;or rather, to pretend to study it. He was too full of
  thoughts of the Lama and the chela, and of his own good fortune in having
  stumbled into their company, to study anything else.</p>

  <p>"The Lama knows I'm Cottswold Ommony. He knows I know who he is. Is he
  using his own method of showing me what he knows I want to see? Or is he
  keeping an eye on me while he attends to his own secrets? Or am I trapped? Or
  being tested?"</p>

  <p>He had heard of the extraordinary tests to which Lamas put disciples
  before entrusting them with knowledge. "But I have never offered to be his
  disciple!" he reflected. And then he remembered that Lamas always choose
  their disciples, and that thought made him chuckle. It is notorious they do
  not choose them for what would pass for erudition according to most
  standards.</p>

  <p>"I'd better see how stupid I can be," he decided. "I chose Diana without
  asking her leave," he remembered. "She likes it all right. Maybe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the thought of becoming an ascetic Lamaist was too much like burlesque
  to entertain, and he dismissed it&mdash;puzzled more than ever.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br>
  The Second Act</h2>

  <p class="quote">The ways of the gods are natural, the ways of men unnatural,
  and there is nothing supernatural, except this: that if a man does a useless
  thing, none reproves him; if he does a harmful thing, few seek to restrain
  him; but if he seeks to imitate the gods and to encourage others, all those
  in authority accuse him of corruption. So it is more dangerous to teach truth
  than to enter a powder magazine with a lighted torch.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">ALTHOUGH the first act was no more than a prologue, the
  second was long, constituting almost the entire play, followed by a short
  third act which was not much more than epilogue. For more than half an hour
  Ommony studied his part in silence, and the more he studied it the more its
  grim irony appealed to him. The saddhu typified intolerant self-righteousness
  and the beautifully written lines were jeremiads of abortive sanctity.
  Whatever else the Lama, or whoever wrote the play, might be, he was witty and
  aware of all the arguments of the accusers of mankind.</p>

  <p>It appeared that, having refused to look at the magic jade while the
  mantra was being chanted, the saddhu alone went through the second act
  unchanged. The king, who had looked although warned not to look, became
  turned for a day and a night into an incredibly wise man (which was just what
  he wanted to be) but surrounded by the sweetmeat seller, shoemaker and so on,
  transformed into members of his court, whose ignorance exasperated him to the
  verge of insanity. The soldier had become a general, who prated about
  patriotic duty. The camel-driver was a minister of commerce, who believed
  that the poor were getting their exact deserts and would be ruined by
  paternalism. The village headman was a nobleman with vast estates, who
  rack-rented his tenants and insisted that he did it by divine right. The
  farmers had become a minister of finance and his assistant, who conspired to
  bring about a better state of things by wringing the last realizable rupee
  from the merchant classes. The goatherd, strange to say, became a courtier
  pure and simple, who had no ambition but to make love to every woman who came
  within his range. The sweetmeat seller was a chancellor whose duty was to
  invent laws, and the shoemaker was a judge who had to apply them.</p>

  <p>San-fun-ho, it seemed, had also looked into the magic jade, and had become
  a goddess, with her name unchanged, who came and went, heaping Puck-like
  irony on every one, king included, and engaging in acid exchanges of wit with
  the saddhu, who had much the worst of it.</p>

  <p>The women with the water-jars had all become court favorites, who lolled
  on divans and complained of their tedious, unprofitable fate, inclining
  rather to the saddhu's view of things but unwilling to give up sinecures for
  austerity (which they declared had gone out of fashion long ago) and
  cynically skeptical of the morals of the dancing women, who entered early in
  the second act to entertain the court. The long and the short of it was, that
  nobody was any happier for being changed, and least of all the king, who had
  only implored the Powers to make him fabulously wise, and who found his
  wisdom sterile because foolish people could not understand it.</p>

  <p>The second act was supposed to take place at night, after a long day's
  experience of the results of the sudden change of character, and at the close
  they all departed to the well, to greet the dawn and welcome a return to
  their former condition.</p>

  <p>The third act found them at the well-side, changed again, and San-fun-ho,
  once more a Chinese woman, took them to task for having failed to see the
  future seeded in themselves, depending for fruition solely on their own use
  of each passing moment. Because the saddhu had to interject remarks, the
  whole of San-fun-ho's last speech was written on Ommony's scroll, and as he
  read he chuckled at the saddhu's vanquishment. He loved to see cant and
  pseudo-righteousness exploded. He could imagine the saddhu, typifying all he
  most loathed, slinking off-stage, brow-beaten, ashamed&mdash;and just as bent
  as ever on attaining Heaven by the exercise of tyranny, self-torture and
  contempt of fun.</p>

  <p>Then San-fun-ho's last lines&mdash;a mantra&mdash;sung to Manjusri,* Lord
  and Teacher, "free from the two-fold mental gloom," as redolent and ringing
  with immortal hope as sunshine through the rain.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Manjusri</i>&mdash;The Bodhisattva of keen
  awareness in Buddhism. A disciple of the historical Buddha Shakyamuni, he
  represents wisdom, intelligence and realization... Together with Shakyamuni
  and fellow disciple Samantabhadra he forms the Shakyamuni... In Tibetan
  Buddhism he is sometimes depicted in a trinity with Avalokiteshvara and
  Vajrapani. <i>Wikipedia</i>.]</p>

  <p>He was reading that when the gong sounded&mdash;a reverberating, clanging
  thing of brass whose din drowned thought and drove the wasps in squadrons
  through the window-slats. And that brought another problem that invited very
  serious attention. As a Brahmin&mdash;even a Bhat-Brahmin, who is not
  supposed to be above committing scores of acts the orthodox would reckon
  unclean&mdash;he might not eat in company with actors, nor even in the Lama's
  company, nor in any room in which non-Brahmins were. He began to exercise his
  wits to find a way out of the difficulty&mdash;only to find that the Lama had
  foreseen it and had provided the solution.</p>

  <p>Long-robed servants entered from the courtyard bearing bowls of hot food
  for the actors, but none for Ommony or Dawa Tsering or the dog. Instead, a
  tall Tibetan came, announcing that a meal cooked by a Brahmin would be served
  in a ritually clean room, if his honor would condescend to be shown the way
  to it.</p>

  <p>The room turned out to be a small one at the far corner of the cloister,
  and no more ritually clean than eggs are square, nor had the meal been cooked
  by a Brahmin; but the actors were none the wiser. Dawa Tsering's food was
  heaped in a bowl on a mat outside the door, and he, having no caste
  prejudices, squatted down to gorge himself, with a wary eye on Diana. Ommony
  relieved his mind:</p>

  <p>"She eats only at night. She won't touch food unless I give
  permission."</p>

  <p>Dawa Tsering promptly tried to tempt the dog, but she turned up her nose
  at the offer, and the Hillman grinned. "I think you have more than one devil
  in you, Gupta Rao! However, maybe they are not bad devils!" He nodded to
  himself; down in the recesses of his mind there was an evolution going on,
  that was best left to take its own course.</p>

  <p>Ommony left him and the dog outside and shut himself into the small square
  room. There was only one door; one window. He was safe from observation.
  There was a plain but well-cooked meal of rice and vegetables laid out on a
  low wooden bench with a stool beside it, and a pitcher of milk that smelt as
  fresh as if it had come from a model dairy; also a mattress in a corner, on
  which to rest when the meal was finished&mdash;good monastic fare and greater
  ease than is to be had in many an expensive hostelry.</p>

  <p>He finished the meal and sprawled on the mattress, confessing to himself
  that in spite of the Lama's having avoided him for twenty years, in spite of
  the evidence of an astonishingly perfect spy-system that had enabled the Lama
  so infallibly to trace and recover the jade, and even in spite of Benjamin's
  confession, it was next to impossible to believe the old Lama was a
  miscreant. Because of the story of traffic in white children, reason argued
  that the Lama was a fiend. Intuition, which ignores deduction, told him
  otherwise; and memory began to reassert itself.</p>

  <p>There was, for instance, twenty years of correspondence from the Lama,
  mostly in English, with reference to the business of the Tilgaun Mission; not
  one word of it was less than altruistic, practical and sane; there had never
  been a hint of compromise with even those conventional lapses from stern
  principle that most institutions find themselves compelled to make. In fact,
  he admitted to himself that the Lama's letters, more than anything else
  during his life in India, had helped him to see straight and to govern
  himself uprightly.</p>

  <p>And now this play. And Samding. Could a man who made victims of children
  so educate a chela as that one evidently had been educated? Youth takes on
  the taint of its surroundings. Samding had the calm self-possession of one
  who knew the inherent barrenness of evil and therefore could not be tempted
  by it.</p>

  <p>And would a man, who permitted himself to outrage humanity by hypnotizing
  children, write such a play as this one, or approve of it, or stage it at his
  own expense? The play was not only ingeniously moral, it was radically sound
  and aimed equally at mockery of wrong ideals and the presentation of a manly
  view of life. A saint might have written it, and a reckless "angel" might
  finance it, but a criminal or a man with personal ambitions, hardly.</p>

  <p>Then again, there was the mystery of the Lama's treatment of himself. How
  much had Benjamin told? The old Jew had sent the trunk, so there had been
  plenty of chance to send a message with it. Benjamin might have brought the
  trunk in person. Anyhow, the Lama now unquestionably knew who the
  Bhat-Brahmin was; and he was evidently willing for the present not only to
  submit to espionage but to protect the spy!</p>

  <p>It might be, of course, that the Lama had views of his own as to what
  constitutes crime. He had radical views, and was not averse to voicing them
  before strangers. But if his conception of morality included smuggling
  children into the unknown Hill country, how was it that he was so careful for
  the Tilgaun Mission and so insistent on safeguards against mental
  contamination?</p>

  <p>Above all, why was he so careful to avoid an interview? What did he
  propose to gain by pretending not to see through the Brahmin disguise? True,
  he had spoken English once or twice, but he had made no comment when the
  Bhat-Brahmin pretended not to understand him. Was he simply amusing himself?
  If so, two could play at that game! For the present Ommony had to let the
  problem go unsolved, but he dismissed the very notion of not solving it and
  he determined to get at least as much amusement out of the process as ever
  the Lama should enjoy.</p>

  <p>He had about reached that conclusion, and was contemplating a siesta, when
  the same attendant who had brought him to the room came to announce that "the
  holy Lama Tsiang Samdup" was expecting him in the great hall. When he reached
  the hall rehearsal of the second act was already under way; Maitraya was
  getting off a speech he had already memorized, strutting, declaiming, trying
  to impress the Lama and the troupe with his eloquent stage personality. The
  Lama took no notice as Ommony entered with the dog and Dawa Tsering, but told
  Maitraya to repeat the lines. Maitraya, rather nettled, gave a different
  rendering, more pompous, louder and accompanied by gestures more emphatic
  than the first. The troupe applauded, since Maitraya plainly expected it, but
  the Lama broke into a smile that disturbed his wrinkles as if they had been
  stirred with a spoon.</p>

  <p>"My son," he said quietly, "the whistle does not pull the train."
  Maitraya's jaw dropped. "Samding, show him how I like to have those lines
  read."</p>

  <p>Samding spoke the lines from memory, not moving his body at all, and the
  amazing thing was that while he spoke one forgot he was a chela and almost
  actually saw a king standing where he was sitting&mdash;a king who was bored
  to distraction and trying to explain kindly to stupid people why their
  arguments were all wrong. One felt immensely sorry for the king, and saw the
  hopelessness of his attempt. But all that was between the lines, and in the
  wonderful inflection of the voice.</p>

  <p>"And now, my son, try once more," said the Lama. "Imagine the audience is
  on the stage, and speak to them as you would like a king to speak to you; not
  as you yourself would speak if you were king, but as a king should speak to
  unwise people."</p>

  <p>Maitraya swallowed pride, tried again, and so surprised himself with his
  second effort that he tried a third time without invitation; and the third
  rendering was almost good. The man had imitative talent.</p>

  <p>The whole of the afternoon was given up to the reading and re-reading of
  the second act, and Dawa Tsering slept&mdash;and snored&mdash;throughout the
  entire performance. Several times the Lama obliged Ommony to repeat his
  lines, without once calling him by name, and once he made Samding repeat them
  for him, the chela doing so from memory, apparently knowing the whole play by
  heart. The Lama was as exacting with Ommony as with Maitraya and the rest.
  Once he said:</p>

  <p>"My son, you know the saddhu is a false philosopher. You like to see him
  ridiculed by San-fun-ho. And that shows wisdom. There is merit in
  appreciation. But it is not good to forget that you are the saddhu. Those who
  listen must not be aware that you expect to be worsted in argument. Now speak
  the lines again."</p>

  <p>Ommony complied, and did his best, for he was enjoying the game hugely;
  and that put Maitraya in a somewhat similar frame of mind; Maitraya imitated
  anything, including mental attitudes, and the rest of the troupe took example
  from him. When the East sets forth to play a part in earnest, it becomes
  audience as well as actor, and accepts the drama for reality. Even the Lama
  was pleased. He praised them after a fashion of his own.</p>

  <p>"Because you are doing well, it would not be good to believe you cannot do
  better. Even the sun and stars are constantly improving. Let vanity not slay
  humility, which is the spirit reaching upward."</p>

  <p>Then, as if that perhaps were too great praise, which might deceive them,
  he picked out an actor here and there for comforting rebuke:</p>

  <p>"You must remember that to play the part of a stupid character requires
  intelligence. You will grow more intelligent as you endeavor. Now let us
  begin again at the beginning, trying to forget how stupid we have consented
  to be hitherto. Let us consent to be intelligent."</p>

  <p>He did not once betray impatience. When he needed an example he commanded
  Samding, and the chela spoke at once from memory, occasionally descending to
  the floor to act as well as speak the lines. Once the chela acted the same
  part in the same way twice in succession, and then he came in for
  reprimand:</p>

  <p>"Samding, no two atoms in all nature are alike. No day is twice repeated.
  No second breath is like the first. Do that a third time. Do it
  differently."</p>

  <p>Tyrant, however, was no right name for the Lama. There was no sense of
  oppression, even at the end of a long afternoon, when every faculty,
  Samding's apparently included, ached from exercise. Samding worked harder
  than them all together, because all through the second act, in the role of a
  goddess, he had to come and go and speak the all-important lines on which the
  action hinged. But when darkness came, and tall monk-like Tibetans, armed
  with tapers, lit the hanging lights and set candles in the wall-sconces, the
  chela was as self-possessed and full of life as ever, which he hardly would
  have been if he had felt imposed on.</p>

  <p>At last the Lama dismissed the troupe to the far end of the hall, where
  they sprawled wearily on the floor and awaited supper. Not moving from the
  mat, he beckoned Ommony and Dawa Tsering to come and squat on the floor in
  front of him, not on the platform. They had to look up.</p>

  <p>"Now for the show-down! Good!" thought Ommony, stroking Diana's head as
  she crouched on the floor beside him. But the Lama spoke to Dawa Tsering,
  using the northern dialect:</p>

  <p>"Why did you say to Samding that I owe you two months' pay?" he asked, not
  offended, curious.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I had to say something. I had to have an excuse for seeing you. I had
  a letter to deliver."</p>

  <p>The Lama nodded, but his voice became a half-note sterner: "Why did you
  use violence to Samding?"</p>

  <p>"I am a violent man, and the chela offended me."</p>

  <p>"What offense did the chela commit?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he looked too satisfied. He was a fool to stir the devil in me. Also
  I was disgusted."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because he did not look afraid. And I knew he was afraid&mdash;of me!
  Therefore he was a liar. Therefore I smote him with the letter, and hustled
  him a time or two. He was afraid to hit back. Let him hit me now, if he is
  not afraid to!"</p>

  <p>The Lama meditated for a moment&mdash;seemed to fall asleep&mdash;and then
  to come out of a dream as if emerging from another universe.</p>

  <p>"There is a certain merit in you," he said quietly. "Are you now the
  servant of this Brahmin?"</p>

  <p>"I am keeper of the dog. I pick the fleas from her. She is a very wise and
  unusual devil."</p>

  <p>Dawa Tsering glanced at Ommony, who rather hoped he would say something to
  the Lama about the Bhat-disguise and thus bring that subject to a head; but
  he was disappointed. Nothing was farther from Dawa Tsering's intention; he
  was thoroughly enjoying what he thought was a perfect imposition on the
  Lama.</p>

  <p>"This Gupta Rao," he went on, "is a devil even greater than the dog. I
  like him. He and I are friends."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the Lama, "that seems to be excellent, because friends must
  stand together. There is a devil needed in this play of mine, and you shall
  act the devil. You will like that. But remember: there must be no offense to
  Samding, or to anyone. You and Gupta Rao are together, being, as you say,
  friends. If I should need to dismiss you, because of wrong-doing, I will
  dismiss him also. Therefore his safety&mdash;do you hear me?&mdash;his safety
  will depend on you, and you must behave accordingly."</p>

  <p>The word safety was plainly intended for Ommony's ears and the chela
  glanced at him, but the Lama's eyes did not move. After a slight pause he
  continued:</p>

  <p>"You and the dog will both receive instruction." Then at last he looked at
  Ommony: "Will the dog open her mouth when she is told?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Ommony ordered Diana to sit upright. He did not need to speak. At a sign
  from him she opened her mouth wide and yawned.</p>

  <p>"That is good," said the Lama. "That will do. Peace dwell with you, my
  son. Samding!"</p>

  <p>The chela helped him to his feet, rolled up the mat, and followed him to
  the door exactly as on the first occasion, leaving Ommony and Dawa Tsering
  looking at each other until the Hillman threw his shoulders back and
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"Now you see why I have served him all these months! I, who have a devil
  in me! I, who mean to slay a man in Spiti! I, who hate a long-faced monk as
  an ape hates the river!" Then another thought occurred to him. "You must pay
  me more money, Gupta Rao, else I will offend the old Bag of Wisdom and he
  will discharge the two of us!"</p>

  <p>But instead of answering Ommony got up and found his way to the little
  room reserved for him. Through the slats of the window he could hear Dawa
  Tsering, squatting beside Diana, taking her into confidence:</p>

  <p>"It would be amusing, thou, to betray this Ommonee and see what happens.
  But I am afraid that what would happen might be serious. I think I had better
  say nothing, because what may happen then will probably be amusing. Thou, I
  think a person who can teach thee such obedience might be a bad enemy and a
  good friend!"</p>

  <p>Tibetans brought the evening meal, with a huge bowl of rice and a bone for
  Diana, but Diana refused to touch the food although the man set the bowl down
  in front of her and Dawa Tsering urged. It was not until Ommony gave her
  permission that she fell to greedily.</p>

  <p>"Thou, Gupta Rao, put no such spell upon me!" Dawa Tsering urged solemnly.
  "I am used to eating when my belly yearns for it!"</p>

  <p>Ommony finished his meal and decided to find out whether or not he was
  under any personal restraint. He crossed the courtyard and approached the
  double gate through which the carriage had entered that morning. There was a
  Tibetan standing near, who bowed, saw his intention, and opened the gate
  civilly to let him through! Diana followed, but he sent her back, making her
  jump the gate, which she managed at the third attempt, and he could hear the
  Tibetan on the far side laughing good-humoredly. He knocked on the gate from
  outside and the Tibetan opened it. Plainly there was no restriction on his
  movements; so he whistled Diana and started strolling down the alley,
  considering Benjamin and wondering whether the old Jew had lied about the
  smuggled children&mdash;and if so, why? What did Benjamin stand to gain by
  telling such a tale if it were not true? "The more you know of India the less
  you know!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>It was Diana who transferred his thoughts to another angle of the problem.
  She had paused at the end of the alley and was signaling in the way she used
  to in jungle lanes when she detected a human who had no ostensible right to
  be there.</p>

  <p>Ommony stood still, which obliged her to glance around at him for orders.
  He signed to her to come to heel and then walked very quietly to the end of
  the alley, where the corner of a high wall intensified the gathering
  darkness. No lamps were yet lighted, although there was one fixed on an iron
  upright at the angle of the masonry above him; it was almost pitch-dark where
  he sat down, with his back against the wall, giving no orders to Diana,
  simply watching her.</p>

  <p>The hair on the scruff of her neck began to rise; she could hear voices,
  and so could he presently. He pulled her closer against the wall where she
  crouched obediently, trembling because she added his alertness to her own.
  She was quite invisible in the depth of the shadow; Ommony was between her
  and the road into which the alley opened; but he knew his own figure could be
  seen, something like a wayside idol, by anyone with sharp eyes who should
  pass close to the corner.</p>

  <p>There were two men approaching very slowly, deep in conversation. One wore
  spurs. Unexplainably (without delving into such science as Chutter Chand
  expounds in his room behind the jewelry store) Ommony received an impression
  that they had been pacing to and fro for a considerable time. They came to a
  halt around the corner within three steps of where he sat, and when he held
  his breath he could hear their words distinctly:</p>

  <p>"You see, Chalmers, if we raid the place without being sure of our ground,
  all we'll do is make trouble for ourselves and serve them notice to cover
  their tracks. We must have evidence that'll make conviction certain, or
  they'll hold us up as another horrid example of official tyranny."</p>

  <p>"I tell you, sir, I know the women are in here."</p>

  <p>"But do you know they are the women? We can't interfere with religion.
  We'd be in a fine mess if we haled a bevy of legitimate nautch-girls into
  court. We've got to have proof."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, sir. Lamaism doesn't run to nautch-girls. These people are
  Tibetans. They've no proper business in Delhi, and absolutely no excuse for
  lugging unexplainable women around the country. The Lama was seen to enter
  Vasantasena's place, and I myself saw him come out and drive off with his
  chela and two other people. I had him followed, and I know he drove in here.
  He hasn't come out since. You know what kind of a place Vasantasena
  keeps."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but we also know every member of her household. And she's another
  individual it's deadly dangerous to monkey with unless we're certain of our
  facts."</p>

  <p>"We've got circumstantial evidence enough to hang a rajah, sir."</p>

  <p>"Circumstantial won't do, Chalmers. I spoke with McGregor about it today;
  he assured me there isn't a thing on the Lama in the Secret archives. He
  admits there's slavery on the Assam border,* and that slaves are sold into
  Nepal and Tibet. But that doesn't justify us in raiding this place, warrant
  or no warrant. We'd be inviting a riot. The way things are at the moment,
  Moslems and Hindus 'ud get together and make common cause even with
  Christians if they thought they could jump on us by doing it&mdash;and slit
  one another's throats afterward! They'd call it another Amritsar. I'll tell
  you what you may do if you like: surround this place and shadow every one who
  leaves it. That way we may get evidence."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* See United States daily papers, 1923; also official
  Indian Government reports.]</p>

  <p>There was silence while someone suppressed ill-temper. Then a voice:</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir."</p>

  <p>A piece of mortar from the top of the wall fell to the ground beside
  Ommony. He glanced up. It was growing very dark, but he thought he saw the
  shadow of a man's head, vague against the colored gloom of an overhanging
  tree. The men who were talking moved on, toward the alley-mouth&mdash; passed
  it&mdash;turned, and started back again.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" said one of them, the taller, he with the spurs. "Do you notice
  the audience? Wait! Don't go down there&mdash;that's a nasty, damned dark
  alley&mdash;might be an accident.&mdash;Good evening!" he said, coming to a
  stand six feet away from Ommony. "I hope we haven't disturbed your
  meditations."</p>

  <p>Ommony's hand closed on Diana's muzzle. She crowded herself closer against
  the wall.</p>

  <p>"I say, I hope we haven't disturbed your meditations!"</p>

  <p>Ommony did not move.</p>

  <p>"Maybe he doesn't know English, sir."</p>

  <p>"Dammit, I can't see his caste-mark. He looks like a Hindu. Haven't a
  flashlight, have you?"</p>

  <p>The younger of the two men struck a match; its yellow glare showed Ommony
  in high relief, but darkened the shadow behind him.</p>

  <p>"By gad, sir, that's the Brahmin who came out of Vasantasena's with the
  Lama!"</p>

  <p>The last thing Ommony wanted was police recognition; with the best will in
  the world the police may bungle any intricate investigation, through over-
  zeal, and because they must depend on under-qualified subordinates. He was
  satisfied to learn that McGregor had kept his promise not to unleash the
  Secret Service on the trail; disturbed to learn the police on the other hand
  were busy. During thirty seconds, until the match went out, he cultivated the
  insolent stare to which Brahmins treat "unclean" intruders.</p>

  <p>"Brahmin and a Lama keeping company? That's strange."</p>

  <p>"I'd call it suspicious, if you asked me, sir! What's he doing here? He's
  not even sitting on a mat. That corner's ritually unclean&mdash;fouled by
  dogs and God knows what else."</p>

  <p>"I'll try him in the vernacular.&mdash;I'm curious to know why you are
  sitting here," said the man with spurs. "Is there anything wrong? Are you
  ill? Can I help you in any way?"</p>

  <p>"Leave me to my meditation!" Ommony answered in a surly tone of voice.</p>

  <p>"Why meditate just here, O twice-born? This is a bad place&mdash;
  dangerous&mdash;thieves, you know. Don't you think you'd better move on?"</p>

  <p>Ommony was in doubt whether or not to answer, but he was afraid Diana
  might betray her presence unless he could get rid of the inquisitors. He made
  up an answer on the spur of the moment and growled it indignantly:</p>

  <p>"A year ago my son died on this very spot, slain by a bullet from a
  soldier's rifle. Therefore I choose this place to meditate. I abase myself in
  dirt before the gods who visited that evil on me."</p>

  <p>"Damned unlikely story, sir, if you asked me!"</p>

  <p>"Everything in this damned country is unlikely! Have him watched. You'd
  better stand at that corner, and if he moves off, have one of the men follow
  him. I'll go back and send you twenty or thirty men to surround the place.
  &mdash;Good night, O twice-born! Meditate in peace!" Ommony listened until
  their footsteps died away in the near distance. Then, taking very great care
  that Diana should understand she was still stalking danger, not defying it,
  he crept on tiptoe to the gate at the other end of the alley and drummed on
  it with his knuckles.</p>

  <p>There was no answer. He tried the gate, but it was fastened on the inside.
  So he made Diana jump it, and in less than a minute after that Dawa Tsering
  came and undid the bars.</p>

  <p>"O thou, Gupta Rao, there are happenings!" he said, showing white teeth
  that gleamed in the dark.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER XV.</a><br>
  The Roll-Call by Night</h2>

  <p class="quote">To him who truly seeks the Middle Way, the Middle Way will
  open. One step forward is enough.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">WITHIN the courtyard there was not confusion but a silent
  flitting to and fro as purposeful and devoid of collision as the evening
  flight of bats. Tall, specter-like figures, on the run, were carrying out
  loads and arranging them in a long row under the cloister. There was no sign
  of the Lama, nor of Maitraya, and only one dim light was burning&mdash;a
  guttering candle set in a sconce under one of the arches.</p>

  <p>"They go!" said Dawa Tsering. "They go!" He was excited&mdash;thrilled by
  the atmosphere of mystery. "There was a fellow on the wall, along there at
  the corner of the garden, where the tree is. He came running; and another
  summoned the Lama; and there was an order given. May devils eat me if they
  weren't quick! They are like ants when the hill is damaged!"</p>

  <p>Ommony approached the cloister where the candle-light threw dancing
  shadow, and the first thing he recognized was his own trunk, with the bags
  and bundles of the other actors laid alongside it, in a line with scores of
  other loads all roped in worn canvas covers. There was every indication of
  orderly but swift and sudden flight; and only one reasonable deduction
  possible. Dawa Tsering voiced it:</p>

  <p>"Women-trouble! Trouble-women! It is the same thing! They bring a man to
  ruin in the end!"</p>

  <p>Ommony sat down on the trunk, and suddenly jumped up again. A woman's
  voice cried out of darkness from an upper story.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that?"</p>

  <p>"So screams a woman when the knife goes in!" said Dawa Tsering pleasantly.
  He was having an entirely satisfying time. "Look to thyself! There is room to
  hide dead men in this place, and none the wiser!"</p>

  <p>But Ommony was not quite sure the woman's cry did not hold a suggestion of
  laughter.</p>

  <p>A Tibetan unlocked the door of the great hall in which the rehearsals had
  taken place, and Maitraya emerged in a tantrum.</p>

  <p>"Krishna! This is too much!" he snorted. "Is that you, Gupta Rao? What do
  you think of it! To lock us in like criminals! To take our luggage&mdash;by
  the Many-armed Immaculate&mdash;what is happening?"</p>

  <p>The other actors trailed out after him, the women last, peering over the
  shoulders of the men in front. One of them was half-hysterical and, seeing
  nothing else to be afraid of, screamed at the dog. Ommony retreated into
  darkness. Dawa Tsering followed him, immensely free as to the shoulders, like
  an old-time mercenary fighting-man who foresaw trouble of the sort that was
  his meat and drink.</p>

  <p>"Have you a weapon, Gupta Rao? If you asked me, I should say you would
  need one presently!"</p>

  <p>Ommony dragged the Hillman down beside him and the three&mdash;he, Dawa
  Tsering and the dog&mdash;sat with their backs against the wall in
  impenetrable shadow, out of which they could watch what was passing in the
  ghostly candlelight.</p>

  <p>"How many women has the Lama with him?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Oh, lots! I never counted. There were one or two I had my eye on, but the
  crafty old Ringding looks after them more carefully than an Afghan watches a
  harem. He and the chela are the only ones who can get within talking
  distance. Never mind. We will have our opportunity now, unless I am much
  mistaken."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell me about these women before?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I thought you knew everything. Besides, you are probably a gay fellow
  yourself. I don't like interference. If you and I should love the same
  one&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Lama stepped into the circle of candle-light, entirely unexcited, and
  as usual Samding was with him. Samding counted all the loads twice over.</p>

  <p>"Wait until I get my yak-hair cloak and the other things," said Dawa
  Tsering, and disappeared.</p>

  <p>The Lama said one word and Samding promptly commenced a roll-call, from
  memory, in a clear commanding voice, beginning with a string of northern
  names, following with Maitraya and all his actors, Ommony's almost last. It
  was as thrilling as a roll-call on a battle-field.</p>

  <p>"Gupta Rao!"</p>

  <p>"Here."</p>

  <p>"Dawa Tsering?"</p>

  <p>"Coming!"</p>

  <p>"And the dog?"</p>

  <p>Ommony whispered to Diana and she bayed once. Everybody laughed, including
  the Lama, who stood so upright that he could have passed for a young man
  until Samding came and stood beside him, when the contrast exposed the
  trickery of darkness.</p>

  <p>The Lama spoke in low tones to a Tibetan, who repeated the order to
  others, and in a moment all the loads were on men's heads. There was a
  prodigious number of them; men had arrived like ghosts, apparently from
  nowhere, and the discipline was perfect. Not a man spoke. There was no sound
  except for a grunt now and then and the rutching of heavily loaded bare feet
  on the paving stones; and not a woman yet in evidence except Maitraya's
  actresses, who seemed too frightened to make a fuss, or too interested to be
  frightened; it was hard to tell which.</p>

  <p>If there was another order given Ommony did not hear it. The procession
  started across the courtyard, in through the stable-door into which the
  Lama's carriage had vanished when they first drove in that morning; someone
  opened the door from inside. The Lama stood in the courtyard watching,
  Samding beside him counting, and they two entered last, a dozen paces behind
  Ommony; and the moment they entered the echoing arch the door slammed shut at
  their backs.</p>

  <p>One candle on an iron bracket showed the shadowy outlines of three
  carriages on the right, and three horses in stalls beyond that. The place
  seemed clean, with plenty of fresh air, and the stable-smell was not
  overpowering.</p>

  <p>"Have you been here before?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Not I," said Dawa Tsering. "Maybe it is here he keeps the women! This is
  one of those places the police dare not look into lest men accuse them of
  committing sacrilege. In my next incarnation I will study to be a priest,
  because then I can laugh at the police instead of being inconvenienced by
  them."</p>

  <p>Diana trotted right and left into the shadows, sniffing, interested but
  not suspicious. It was she, three or four yards ahead who presently gave
  warning of danger in the form of steps descending into absolute obscurity.
  The candle-light did not penetrate to that point and it was impossible to see
  whether there was a door to conceal the steps when not in use. The voices of
  three women added to Maitraya's complaining of darkness and danger, answered
  by cavernous rumbling as someone reassured them, proved that the steps did
  not go very deep, but there was nothing else to judge by, until, twenty paces
  beyond the foot of the steps, the tunnel turned and another solitary candle
  burning at a corner in the distance showed the long procession shuffling
  toward it.</p>

  <p>There were no rats, no dirt, and it was not particularly damp. The tunnel,
  which was floored and lined with heavy masonry, was roofed in places by the
  natural rock, but there were spaces beamed with heavy timber and other spaces
  filled with what looked like fairly modern concrete. The floor and walls
  seemed very ancient, but the roof had undoubtedly been repaired more than
  once within the century. The level could not have been more than thirty or
  forty feet underground, and there was a distinct draught of cool air passing
  through.</p>

  <p>It was not until he came within a dozen paces of the candle that Ommony's
  ears, growing accustomed to the echoing shuffle of about two hundred feet,
  detected that not all that noise came from in front. He looked back, and saw
  shadowy, black-draped figures behind the Lama and Samding. It was impossible
  to guess how many, since he looked with the light behind him, into darkness,
  and when he passed the candle the tunnel turned again rather sharply to the
  right. He stood still at the corner, looking backward, but the Lama boomed to
  him to go on&mdash;boomed so cheerfully and confidently that it would have
  been churlish to refuse.</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose those are women behind us?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I know they are," said Dawa Tsering. "For a jest, O Gupta Rao, send thy
  she-dog to them. There will be a happening!"</p>

  <p>There was more in that notion than its propounder guessed. Ommony snapped
  his fingers for attention, and spoke to Diana as loud as he could without
  letting the Lama hear:</p>

  <p>"Friends! Go and make friends!"</p>

  <p>He waved his hand toward the rear. Diana turned and darted past the Lama,
  who tried to intercept her; failing, he made a curt exclamation whose meaning
  Ommony could not catch.</p>

  <p>"What did he say?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It means to be silent because they are not afraid," said Dawa
  Tsering.</p>

  <p>And whoever they were, they were not afraid, which was sufficient cause in
  itself for much hard thinking. Diana was as high at the shoulder as a Great
  Dane; as shaggy and lean and active as a monster from the folklore legends.
  As an apparition suddenly emerging out of darkness with her eyes aglare in
  candle-light she was enough to have thrown old hunters into panic. But
  instead there was nothing but laughter, much snapping of fingers and enticing
  noises made between the lips, and the laughter was as merry and appealing as
  the sudden view-hallo of children when a circus-clown kisses a pig. The Lama
  had to boom a second time for silence, although why he called for silence
  after that ringing revelation was not exactly clear; surely there was no
  risk, down there in the tunnel, of the noise being heard by the police. And
  another thing: his voice was not alarmed, not even anxious or offended; it
  more resembled that of an engineer who orders steam turned off, or of a clerk
  convening court&mdash;quite matter-of-fact, with hardly the suggestion of
  command in it.</p>

  <p>Ommony let Diana stay behind there making friends. He chuckled to himself.
  There were few but he who knew the possibilities of that dog. Having once
  established in her mind that certain individuals were friends, he would have
  no particular difficulty in using her to penetrate any screen the Lama might
  contrive. There was no further need to risk an issue with the Lama by
  appearing over-curious; he could wait for opportunity and let Diana open up
  communications.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, it would not have helped him in the least to be inquisitive
  just then. The tunnel turned again and grew pitch-dark&mdash;became a stream
  of echoing noise in which a man could only feel his way by touching the man
  next to him or elbowing the wall, letting himself flow forward as it were in
  the general movement, which some forgotten sense reported to the brain.</p>

  <p>Then dim light, far ahead, and at last a glimpse of sky, framing half a
  dozen stars, that made the tunnel seem even darker and a backward glimpse
  impossible. Diana came sniffing for Ommony and shoved her nose into his hand.
  Then she suddenly bayed at the sight of the sky in front and raced away to
  investigate.</p>

  <p>Ommony did his best to memorize the details of the tunnel opening, but
  failed. There were steps, but not many of them. Then he found himself in a
  courtyard about thirty yards square, with stars overhead and the shadowy
  columned entrance of a place that looked in the dark like a temple behind
  him. He was aware that a stone floor had come sliding forward to conceal the
  flight of steps; a man had shouted to him to hurry lest he be caught in the
  gap, and he had seen that the sliding stone was two feet thick. There was no
  sign of the Lama, or of Samding, or the women.</p>

  <p>There were camels in the courtyard; he knew that by the smell before he
  saw them kneeling in two uneven rows. Diana, who hated camels, came to heel,
  growling to herself in undertones, and Dawa Tsering laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"I smell travel and the road that runs north!" he said triumphantly. "The
  devil may have these hot plains! Wait while I pick us two good camels&mdash;
  wait here!"</p>

  <p>He disappeared and within the minute there were sounds of hot dispute
  &mdash;three voices. A camel rose like an apparition from another world, and
  snarled as if this world were not satisfying. A heavy thump&mdash;a louder
  oath&mdash;and Dawa Tsering limped back.</p>

  <p>"In the belly! Kicked me in the belly!" he gasped, unable to stand upright
  but with enough wind left in him for agonied speech. "I would have hamstrung
  the brute, but&mdash;those Tibetan-devils&mdash;eh, but it hurts!&mdash; they
  pushed me toward his hoof again and&mdash;yow! let me sit so&mdash; stand
  beside me&mdash;yah-h, I have a bellyache!"</p>

  <p>The courtyard was alive with movement, but there was hardly a spoken word.
  The camels moaned and gurgled, as they always do when loads are being heaped
  on them, and now and then someone called out for an extra package to balance
  an animal's burden; but on the whole there was even less noise than when
  Bedouins strike tents and vanish. After a while, as his eyes grew accustomed
  to the gloom, Ommony could make out men who certainly were not Tibetans; they
  wore turbans and were more like Bikaniri camel-men. Then, huge and shadowy
  against the sky, there loomed seven elephants with curtained howdahs,* making
  no noise, effortless, coming through an open gate like phantoms in a
  dream.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>howdah</i> (Arabic)&mdash;a seat, usually fitted
  with a canopy and railing, placed on the back of an elephant or a camel.]</p>

  <p>Next there came from behind Ommony, a man in a turban and long cloak,
  followed by a younger man whose stride seemed familiar, who wore a scimitar
  at his waist and the dress of a chieftain. Diana knew them instantly and
  wagged her tail. They were the Lama and Samding, changed almost out of
  recognition! Ommony followed them wondering at the Lama's strength of gait
  that he seemed to have acquired along with the change of costume; but they
  were presently surrounded by Tibetans, who seemed to be receiving whispered
  instructions. Unable to get close enough to hear what was being said, Ommony
  turned his attention to the elephants, and noticed that they bore the
  trappings of a rajah, although he did not know which rajah. He asked one of
  the mahouts,* who told him gruffly to mind his own business.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>mahout</i> (Hindi)&mdash;an elephant-driver.]</p>

  <p>He walked up close to one of the camel-men, but it was too dark just there
  under the wall to see his features.</p>

  <p>"Whose man are you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Mine own man!" the fellow answered in a plucked, flat harp-string tone of
  voice. "Have a care! This camel bites!"</p>

  <p>Ommony jumped in the nick of time to avoid the vicious teeth. Diana flew
  at the camel;&mdash;the heavily loaded brute struggled to its feet, tried to
  kick four ways at once, and bolted. Ommony grabbed Diana. Nine or ten men
  chased the camel into a corner, managed it amazingly with forked sticks and
  compelled it to kneel. It was plainly enough a desert outfit, used to meeting
  all emergencies without fuss.</p>

  <p>Then the shadowy elephants moved in single file across the yard and
  halted, swaying, at a door beside the one that Ommony had come through; he
  could see the top of a ladder laid against the first one from the far side,
  but could not see who mounted it. A moment later, however, he caught sight of
  the Lama and Samding, the Lama walking like a warrior, skirted, pantalooned,
  seeming to have thrown off thirty years; they climbed on to the last of the
  elephants, and moved off first, the others following.</p>

  <p>After that there was confusion for about a minute; several more elephants
  came through the gate, colliding with the loaded ones, and for reasons that
  were doubtless logical to them, the camels all got up at once and stampeded
  into the jam. But a little, low-muttered swearing, some sharp cries and a lot
  of stick-work straightened that out. The camels were herded out into the open
  behind the elephants; the second lot of elephants came in, and a Tibetan
  seized Ommony's arm.</p>

  <p>Not a word. No explanation. Two other men seized Dawa Tsering, taking no
  chances with him, pouncing on him from behind and shoving him along toward
  the same elephant to which the first man led Ommony. Maitraya's voice was
  raised in protest somewhere in the dark and a woman cried out hysterically,
  but none answered either of them. The whole party of actors was hauled into
  curtained howdahs like so much baggage. Diana jumped&mdash;Ommony caught her
  by the scruff of the neck, hauled her in after him, and found himself in a
  howdah with Dawa Tsering and one Tibetan, who leaned forward, touched Dawa
  Tsering on the shoulder and shook a finger at him meaningly. For answer the
  Hillman made a gesture toward his knife.</p>

  <p>But they were off, swaying like insects on an earthquake, before that
  argument could ripen into happenings, and in less than two minutes the
  Hillman was seasick, hanging on and moaning that he could smell death.</p>

  <p>"That camel kicked my belly into ruins! Peace! I will get down! I have had
  enough of this!"</p>

  <p>But the Tibetan leaned forward and lashed him very neatly to the howdah
  with a rope.</p>

  <p>"Cut me loose, Gupta Rao&mdash;or I call thee Ommonee!"</p>

  <p>"Nay," lied Ommony, "it was my order."</p>

  <p>"Thou? Oh, very well! OMMONEE!" he yelled. Then again between spasms of
  vomiting, "OMMONEE! OMMONEE!"</p>

  <p>It did not seem to matter. The Tibetan took no notice of it. Such a cry by
  night, smothered by howdah curtains, was not likely to mean much to chance
  passers-by. Perhaps Maitraya could hear it on the elephant ahead, but he
  would not know what it meant. Ommony let his name be yelled until the Hillman
  wore himself out, hoping the Tibetan would be too disturbed by it to notice
  anything else. He had his finger through a small hole in the curtain and was
  tearing it for a better view.</p>

  <p>He did contrive to snatch one hurried glimpse before the Tibetan saw what
  he was doing; but it was dark, there was no moon, and all he saw was a broken
  wall with trees beside it&mdash;nothing that would help him identify the
  route. The Tibetan touched him on the arm and shook a warning finger, then
  climbed over to Ommony's side of the howdah and tied up the hole carefully
  with thread torn from a piece of sacking. He did not seem in the least afraid
  of the dog, nor did she object to him. On the principle that good dogs know
  what their masters think subconsciously about a stranger, Ommony decided the
  Tibetan was quite friendly.</p>

  <p>And the process of self-adjustment to mysterious conditions consists
  rather in keeping adventitious friends than in losing them. It seemed much
  more important to disarm suspicion and to create a friendly atmosphere than
  to find out which direction they were taking.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Ommony did not much care where he was going. He
  guessed he was on the "Middle Way," and that, if true, was the all-important
  fact. Details of the route, he knew, might change from hour to hour; the key
  to it was probably a string of individuals extended all across the country,
  bound together by a secret interest in common. He decided not to try to
  memorize the route, but to look out for and identify those men.</p>

  <p>However, he made one casual attempt to draw the Tibetan, in the hope of
  further disarming suspicion by appearing naturally, frankly curious.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going?" he asked in Prakrit.</p>

  <p>"Wherever the holy Lama Tsiang Samdup wishes," the man answered, almost to
  himself, as if he were repeating prayers. After which there was long,
  swaying, hot silence, broken only by the groans of Dawa Tsering and the soft,
  exactly regular footfalls of the elephant.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI.</a><br>
  "Where are we?"</h2>

  <p class="quote">Treason, as between men, is considered worse than theft; for
  even thieves despise it. He who betrays his country is considered fit for
  death. But I tell you: he who betrays his own soul has no longer any link
  with honesty, and there is nothing sure concerning him, except that he will
  go from bad to worse. And evil grows little by little; he who is faithless in
  small things will ultimately lose all honor. Therefore, strive eternally to
  keep faith, not telling secrets nor inquiring uninvited into those of others;
  for the Great Offense is grounded on an infinite variety of little ones
  &mdash;exactly as Great Merit is the total of innumerable acts of
  self-control.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">EACH to his own heaven. Some men prefer golf. To Ommony, the
  seventh heaven of delight&mdash;the apex of a heterodox career was reached
  that hour in a curtained howdah, lurching into unknown night. And the best of
  it was that he knew the future must hold even more thrilling mysteries. There
  was going to be no anticlimax.</p>

  <p>He was uncomfortable, sweating so that his dripping cotton garments clung
  to him, breathing the smell of elephant and dog and Dawa Tsering (which is no
  boudoir mixture), possibly in deadly danger. And he was utterly contented,
  having no regret, no backward yearning.</p>

  <p>The curtains that cut off the view could not limit imagination. He enjoyed
  a mental picture of the string of camels leading and the elephants
  mysteriously padding in the wake, beneath colored stars and a blue-black sky,
  between broken walls and shadowy trees, toward an obscure horizon. The dusty
  footfalls were as music. The mahout's occasional expletives were an open
  sesame to mystery beyond the reach of ordinary men&mdash;and that, perhaps,
  explained nine-tenths of the delight. It is doing what the other fellows
  cannot do, that satisfies; and so, through vanity, the gods make use of us.
  No millions, nor fame, nor offers of a sterilized and safety-infested Heaven
  could have tempted Ommony to forego that journey in the howdah, although
  there were not wanting opportunities to steal away.</p>

  <p>Now and then there were halts, when muffled voices of unseen men on foot,
  who turned up out of the night, delivered terse commands that were barely
  audible and quite incomprehensible through the howdah curtains. Time and
  again he could have tumbled out of the howdah and lowered himself to the
  earth by the elephant's tail. But he preferred to act Jonah in a whale's
  belly, especially since the whale was willing.</p>

  <p>He knew that with the dog's help he could have tracked the caravan to its
  destination and so have learned the details of the course it took. But he
  also guessed that none who saw it pass would answer questions; and at the
  other end there was the risk that he might find a blank wall, silence, and
  perhaps a knife's edge for inquisitive intruders. To play for safety&mdash;
  to look for it&mdash;to expect it, would be ridiculous. He must run all risks
  without a gesture of self-protection. He was glad he had not even a revolver
  with him, for a hidden weapon might betray him into rashness of the wrong
  kind. He made up his mind, if he were threatened, to rely solely on whatever
  wits the gods of emergency might sharpen for him at the moment.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, he felt reasonably sure of one thing: that the elephants were a
  rajah's property. The camels might possibly belong to someone else, but it
  was more likely they were also the same rajah's. There might be a rajah who
  would not ask questions, but who was linked in some chain of more or less
  esoteric brotherhood, akin perhaps to Masonry. If so, the procession would
  arouse no comment on the countryside, for it is no man's business and to no
  man's profit to inquire too closely into a rajah's private doings; he who
  does so may count with almost absolute precision on what the jury will
  subsequently call an accident. "I don't know, I didn't see" and "I forget"
  are difficult, exasperating pegs on which to hang a chain of evidence.</p>

  <p>At the end of two hours' swaying Dawa Tsering's stomach, void of
  embarrassing content, began to recover. His sunny disposition followed
  suit.</p>

  <p>"Loose me, Gupta Rao. I am sorry I bawled out thy other name. I will slay
  this fool who heard me. Then none will be the wiser, and thou and I are
  friends again."</p>

  <p>"Do you hope ever to see Spiti?" Ommony inquired.</p>

  <p>"By the wind that blows there, and the women who laugh there, surely! I
  have a treasure tucked away in Spiti&mdash;earned on the te-rains. Loose me,
  Gupta Rao, or I call thee by thy other name again! I can shout louder, now my
  belly aches less."</p>

  <p>"Shout, and let us see what happens," Ommony suggested.</p>

  <p>The small boy's mind that had its kingdom in the Hillman's bulk considered
  that a moment.</p>

  <p>"Nay," he said presently, "I think that an evil might happen. The luck is
  not good lately. Who would have thought a camel would kick me? The devils who
  live in the hills around Spiti owe me for many a good turn I did them. The
  devils of these parts seem very mischievous. I had better behave myself."</p>

  <p>"How about a promise?" Ommony suggested.</p>

  <p>"You mean, a promise between me and you? But I would have to keep it. That
  might be inconvenient."</p>

  <p>"I would promise for my part to assist you to return to Spiti at the
  proper time."</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well. Only I shall judge the proper time by when the devils have
  turned friendly. Loose me. I will behave myself."</p>

  <p>Ommony undid the rope and the Tibetan, far from objecting, stuck a stump
  of candle on the bare wood of the howdah frame, lighted it, produced a pack
  of cards, and challenged Dawa Tsering to a game. They played interminably,
  both men cheating, both appealing to Ommony to settle constant arguments,
  although there was no money involved.</p>

  <p>"My honor is at stake," Dawa Tsering grumbled after about a dozen furious
  disputes. "This ignorant Tibetan says I am a liar."</p>

  <p>"So you are," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"That may be. But he has no right to give himself airs. He is the greater
  one. Look! He has five cards tucked under his knee, whereas I had but
  two!"</p>

  <p>He shoved the Tibetan so that his knee moved and uncovered the missing
  cards, two of which slipped down between the howdah and the elephant's flank,
  thus putting an end to the game.</p>

  <p>"But I have dice!" said Dawa Tsering; and from then until dawn they
  murdered time and peace with those things, while Diana, her tongue hanging
  out with the heat, panted and shifted restlessly, but Ommony snatched scraps
  of sleep, dimly aware that Dawa Tsering was losing more often than he won,
  growing more and more indignant with devils who refused to bring him
  luck.</p>

  <p>"I will obey thee, Gupta Rao, until the luck changes," he said at last.
  "My dice are loaded, yet even so I cannot win! Luck is funny stuff."</p>

  <p>It was about ten minutes after dawn, the choicest hour in India, alive
  with cock-crow and the color-drenched solemnity of waking day, when the tired
  elephant came to a final halt in some sort of enclosure, and shuffled a slow
  measure to call the mahout's attention to sore feet. At a sharp word of
  command the beast lay down, like a hillside falling. Diana sprang out through
  the curtains and Ommony followed, yawning and sitting down on the elephant's
  forefoot to pretend to watch the mahout's ingenious ministrations to a corn,
  while he surveyed the scene from under lowered eyelids.</p>

  <p>The other elephants, already off-loaded, had shuffled away to a roofed
  enclosure at the far end of a compound, where great heaps of food awaited
  them and equally huge vats of water. The camels, still burdened, were lying
  down in picturesque confusion, carrying on a camel conversation, which
  consists in snarling at the world in general. Along one side of the compound
  was a row of mules, tied by the heel with their rumps toward the wall,
  squealing for breakfast, which was being brought by naked boys, and by a
  bhisti,* who poured water into buckets from a goatskin bag. The opposite side
  of the compound was formed by a low two-storied building with a double-decked
  veranda supported on square wooden posts running the entire length. There
  were flies, much litter and a most amazing smell.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>bhisti</i> (Hindi)&mdash;a water-carrier.]</p>

  <p>Over the roof of the building, where a long line of crows formed a
  mischievously interested audience, there appeared a jumble of other roofs
  that made no pretense to architecture. Small-town noises, such as a smithy
  bellows and the hammer-ring on iron, the patter of goats' feet and the
  heavier tread of cattle being driven forth to graze, arose on all sides.
  There was one minaret in sight, and one Hindu temple-roof ornate with
  carvings of deific passion. The compound gate was locked and there was a
  guard of two men standing by, not evidently armed, but obviously sullen and
  alert. There was no sign of the Lama, nor of any women.</p>

  <p>After a minute or two Maitraya looked out from a door midway under the
  long balcony and greeted Ommony with the familiarity of boon companionship
  established by journeying together. It only needs one night of shared
  discomfort on the road to produce that feeling, or else its opposite. One
  either hates or likes one's fellow traveler; there is no middle ground on the
  dawn of the second day out.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where we are?" Maitraya asked cheerfully.</p>

  <p>Ommony did not know, but he was no such fool as to admit it. In his
  capacity of wiseacre he gave the mahout good advice regarding elephants'
  corns, about which he knew nothing; in his role of privileged extortioner he
  demanded arrack from a man who seemed to be the master of the stables, and
  established friendship with the elephant by giving the grateful beast
  two-thirds of a bottle full of the atrocious stuff.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Diana was exploring on her own account, alarming many mules,
  offending camels, and reducing elephants to a state of old-maidish
  nervousness, at which their mahouts yelled in chorus, offering to throw
  sticks, dung and missiles of all sorts, but daring no more than the threat.
  Diana, solemnly indifferent to abuse, and contemptuous of elephants since she
  had ridden on the back of one, snooted around in corners until she reached
  the end door under the balcony; and finding that open, she entered. There was
  an instant chorus of women's voices. Maitraya grinned.</p>

  <p>"Gupta Rao," he said, "I have seen a many curiosities in my day, but those
  dancing girls surpass all! If they are Tibetans, Krishna! I will risk my life
  and go to Tibet! I saw them descend from the elephants, and Vishnu! Vishnu! I
  assure you my heart thumps! Such beauty! Such chastity redeemed by mirth!
  Such modesty of manner uncontaminated by humility! I foresee adventures,
  Gupta Rao! That divinity of yours who broke your pocketbook in Bikanir will
  have a dozen strong competitors! Krishna! I am impassioned! I am enflamed
  with love! If I can find a shrine of Hanuman, I will make gifts and a
  sacrifice this morning!"</p>

  <p>Diana emerged, led out through the door by Samding, who held her collar;
  seeing Ommony, the chela signaled to him with a smile to call the dog.</p>

  <p>"I hate that chela!" said Maitraya, grinning. "Did I not tell you I had an
  intuition to be jealous of him! Is it possible those twice-born creatures are
  the chela's wives?"</p>

  <p>"Whom are you calling twice-born?" Ommony demanded, instantly assertive of
  a Brahmin's rights.</p>

  <p>"Pranam!" said Maitraya. "But wait until you have seen them!"</p>

  <p>Impelled by a feeling that perhaps the luck might favor him, and partly in
  order to live up to his Bhat reputation, Ommony strolled toward the door
  whence Samding and the laughter had emerged. It was slightly ajar. But he had
  scarcely reached it when the Tibetan who had been fellow traveler during the
  night touched him on the shoulder, led him back to a door at the extreme
  opposite end, and almost violently shoved him into a room furnished with a
  clean wooden table and a bench. Food was on the table&mdash;loads of it
  &mdash;fruit, milk, chapatis, honey, butter, boiled rice, and flowers enough
  to have graced a wedding feast. The Tibetan slammed the door, and Ommony
  heard him turn a key on the outside.</p>

  <p>However, there were two doors to the room, and the window was not
  fastened. He went first to the window and made sure that Diana was within
  hail; she was watching Dawa Tsering gorge his breakfast from a bowl in the
  shade of the compound wall not fifteen feet away. Having satisfied himself on
  that score, he discovered that the inner door was not locked, so he attacked
  the food, that being an important consideration when you don't know what the
  next five minutes may bring forth. The locked outer door, and the guard on
  the compound gate were not exactly reassuring.</p>

  <p>The Lama came in through the inner door just as Ommony finished eating. He
  was alone, no longer dressed in the warrior-like garb of the night before,
  and looking old again&mdash;immensely old, because the morning light streamed
  through the slats of the window and showed all his wrinkles. The snuff-brown
  color of his robe was streaked with old-gold by the sunlight. In that moment
  one could believe he was a rather world-weary, very wise old saint; it was
  next to impossible not to believe it.</p>

  <p>Yet there was humor in his eyes and a gaze unconquerable&mdash;blue-
  gray&mdash;very wide awake. His frame for the moment seemed shrunken, yet his
  height, though he stooped from shoulders that seemed almost too weary to
  support his head, was considerably more than Ommony's.</p>

  <p>"Peace perfect you in all her ways!"</p>

  <p>The blessing was solemn but the voice rang with assurance, as if he knew
  that his will to bless was infinitely overpowering.</p>

  <p>"And to you, my father, peace," said Ommony. He had stood up when the Lama
  entered.</p>

  <p>"And the food was enough? And good enough?" the Lama asked. "The journey
  not distressing?"</p>

  <p>"Where are we?" Ommony retorted bluntly. But the Lama merely smiled, until
  his wrinkles were all in movement, and the fearless old eyes shone with
  kindly humor:</p>

  <p>"My son, he who knows where he is knows more than all the gods. He who
  knows what he is knows all things. Is it not enough that each moment we are
  where we should be? Is not the whole universe a mystery! How shall the part
  be more comprehensible than the whole, since it must partake of the quality
  of the whole?"</p>

  <p>But Ommony did not propose to be put off by wise conundrums. His jaw came
  forward obstinately.</p>

  <p>"I was locked in here," he said. "I have a right to know why."</p>

  <p>"To keep out those whose ignorance might cause them to intrude," the Lama
  answered, exactly as if he were teaching school. "It is not good to place
  temptation in the path of the inquisitive."</p>

  <p>Feeling as if stilts had been kicked from under him, Ommony tried again,
  more bluntly:</p>

  <p>"You know who I am," he began, speaking English; but the Lama interrupted
  in Urdu:</p>

  <p>"My son, if I knew that, I should be wiser than all those whose duty is to
  rule the stars! You have answered to the name of Gupta Rao."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake," said Ommony, again in English, "why not tell me outright
  what your business is? I'll begin by being frank. I'm spying on you! I would
  like to believe you are above suspicion. I'm in doubt."</p>

  <p>"My son," said the Lama, answering in Urdu, "no man is above suspicion.
  The sun and the moon cast their shadows, and therein the destroyers lurk.
  Doubt is the forerunner of decision. Shadows move. All revelation comes to
  him who waits."</p>

  <p>That sounded like a promise. Ommony jumped at it. "We have one interest in
  common&mdash;Tilgaun. Why treat me as an enemy? Why not clear the air now by
  telling me the truth about yourself?"</p>

  <p>"My son," said the Lama, in Urdu again, "no man can ever be told the
  truth, which either is in him, or it is not in him. If it is, he will see the
  truth. If it is not, he will see delusion and will confuse himself with
  surmise. He who looks for negation beholds it. He who looks for truth beholds
  negation also, but perceives the truth beyond. Wherein have I shown you
  enmity?"</p>

  <p>For a moment there was silence. Ommony tried to think of another way of
  getting past the Lama's guard, but the old man's impersonal dignity was like
  armor.</p>

  <p>"There are things you may see, but you must put your own interpretation on
  them," said the Lama. "One by one we attain to understanding. The wise ponder
  in silence, but the fools are noisy, and the noise precedes them to their
  doom."</p>

  <p>That sounded like a threat, but his face was as kindly as ever, rippled
  again with quivering wrinkles, as a smile broke and vanished into the
  recesses of brown-ivory skin.</p>

  <p>"Come!" he said; but instead of opening the door behind him he strode
  first to the window, threw the shutters back, glanced out and made a clucking
  noise. Diana jumped in, and Ommony wondered; she was trained to be wary of
  strangers, and was not given to obeying even her master's friends unless
  carefully charged with that duty by Ommony himself. She thrust her nose into
  the Lama's hand before she came and fussed over Ommony.</p>

  <p>The Lama led the way into a narrow passage on to which many doors opened
  to right and left, it extended from end to end of the long building, its
  walls forming a double support for the heavy beams of the floor above.
  Two-thirds of the way along it he opened a door on the right and a chorus of
  women's voices burst through the opening. But there were no women to be seen
  yet, because the door opened on to a gallery; there was a lower story on that
  side of the building, and the gallery ran around two sides of a large room,
  screened from it by a breast-high balustrade. The Lama led the way to the
  farther end, where the gallery was twenty feet wide and Samding waited,
  standing beside a spread Tibetan prayer mat, marvelously dressed in ivory
  white and looking like a young god. However, god or no god, he had to alter
  the position of the mat by an inch or two before the Lama would sit down,
  after which he motioned to Ommony to be seated on the floor in the farther
  corner, where he could see through a slit in the wooden panel and look down
  on the floor below.</p>

  <p>It was a surprising room to discover close to mule- and elephant-stables,
  but not so surprising as its occupants. The walls were hung with painted
  curtains, and the floor was strewn with cushions on which Indian women, many
  of them high-caste ladies, sat chattering with girls who resembled no caste
  or tribe that Ommony had ever seen anywhere. They were lively, full of
  laughter, young, but no more beautiful, as far as actual features went, than
  any gathering of normally good-looking women anywhere. Six or seven of them,
  if not Tibetans, were at any rate of part-Mongolian origin; but Ommony
  counted fourteen who fitted into no mental pigeon-hole of races he had seen
  and studied.</p>

  <p>In more than one way those fourteen and the Tibetans were all alike. They
  were dressed in the same loose, almost Greek, white cotton robes; they all
  wore stockings, which the native Indian women in the room did not wear; and
  they used more or less the same gestures, were alert with the same vivacity.
  But there the resemblance ended.</p>

  <p>The fourteen were fair-complexioned; one had golden hair that hung in long
  plaits&mdash;she would have looked like a German Gretchen, if it had not been
  for the dress and something else&mdash;something quite indefinable.</p>

  <p>The whole proceedings, the whole scene was like a weird figment of
  imagination. There was nothing natural about it, simply because it was too
  natural. It was not India. There were Moslem as well as Hindu ladies in the
  room, betraying no self-consciousness and no objection to one another's
  presence; and there were actually low-caste women&mdash;sudras&mdash;
  chatting with the rest apparently on equal footing. True, there was no food
  being passed around, but every other caste rule seemed to be forgotten or
  deliberately flouted; yet there was no sign of self-consciousness or
  strain.</p>

  <p>They were talking Urdu, a few of them with difficulty, but it was next to
  impossible to catch the conversation from the gallery because there was so
  much of it&mdash;so many chattering and laughing all at once.</p>

  <p>The fourteen girls in white kept glancing up at the gallery apparently
  expecting some sort of signal, so Ommony had plenty of opportunity to scan
  their features. He did not doubt they were the smuggled children Benjamin had
  spoken of, only there were fourteen instead of seven. There were therefore
  other agents besides Benjamin. But the fact in no way simplified the mystery;
  rather it increased it. Their ages ranged at a guess from seventeen to
  twenty-three or twenty-four which, allowing for the years elapsed, tallied
  with Benjamin's description near enough; and they had grown to
  wholesome-looking womanhood. Not a trace of shyness. No awkwardness. No
  vulgarity. Not one symptom of forced manners or repression. The whole thing
  was incredible; yet there they were. And who had educated them? The Lama?
  That seemed more impossible than for a river to flow up-hill; he might have
  made priggish nuns of them, or downright Tibetans, but not that. It began to
  be evident that there was something worth investigating in the Ahbor country,
  or wherever else the Lama kept his secrets!</p>

  <p>It was the Lama who at last cut short the flow of talk. Sitting still on
  the mat, where his head was not visible from below, he boomed a word in
  Tibetan, as commanding as the gong that brings sea-engines to a halt, and
  there was instant silence as in an aviary when the chattering birds are
  frightened. Whatever he might be, the old man knew what drama meant&mdash;
  and discipline. He whispered to Samding, and the chela, opening a swinging
  door in the front of the gallery, walked down a carpeted flight of steps to
  the floor below.</p>

  <p>He was received in silence. He took from his breast the broken piece of
  jade that Ommony had lost and that the Lama had recovered from the courtesan,
  and holding it in both hands on a level with his shoulders passed among them,
  pausing to let each woman in turn devour it with her eyes. Some of them
  appeared to fall into a state of superstitious rapture; others were curious;
  all were respectful almost to the point of worship. And the Lama watched them
  through a slit in the swinging gate as if all destiny depended on the
  outcome, every tendon in him rigid; the neck tendon stood out like a
  bow-string. Then suddenly, as if to calm himself, he took snuff and rubbed
  his nose violently with his thumb.</p>

  <p>The chela said nothing, but the women were allowed to touch him and
  appeared to think the touch conferred a priceless boon. They laid a finger of
  the right hand on his shoulder as he passed, and one woman, a Moslem, who
  laid both hands on him and clung almost passionately, was quietly reproved
  for it by two of the girls in white.</p>

  <p>"The game begins to look political," thought Ommony, watching the Lama
  clean a snuff-filled nostril with a meditative forefinger. "Vasantasena
  &mdash;umm! Now these women&mdash;I've always wondered why some genius didn't
  try to conquer India by winning the women first! They rule the country
  anyhow."</p>

  <p>The Lama just then looked as calculating as a medieval cardinal, but
  despite that air of playing a deep game for tremendous stakes, there was now
  something almost Puck-like in his attitude. Ommony noticed for the first time
  that his ears did not lie close to his head, were large and slightly pointed
  at the top. Seen sidewise in the rather dim light there was a faint
  suggestion about him of one of those gargoyles that survey the street from a
  cathedral roof. He was even more interesting to watch than the proceedings on
  the floor below.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the Lama spoke again. When he did that his leathery throat moved
  like a pelican's swallowing a big fish, and the noise that came out was
  hardly human&mdash;startling&mdash;so abrupt that it completely broke the
  sequence of all other sounds. It monopolized attention. In the ensuing
  silence he sat back, took snuff again, and seemed to lose all interest in the
  proceedings.</p>

  <p>But to Ommony the interest increased. The girls in white threw black
  cloaks over their shoulders. The Hindu and Moslem women smothered themselves
  in the impenetrable veils without which it is pollution to face men-folk
  out-of-doors; and all of them, in groups of three or four, each little group
  in charge of one of the Lama's female family, who shielded their faces in
  masked hoods that formed part of the black cloaks, departed toward the
  street.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that they did go to the street; a door opened on to a
  vestibule, and sunlight shone through a street door at its farther end.</p>

  <p>Samding returned up the steps and gave the piece of jade to the Lama, who
  stowed it somewhere in his bosom without glancing at it. Ommony watched the
  chela narrowly. Was he a European boy? There was something in the clean
  strong outline of his face and in the lithe athletic figure that might
  suggest that. But he was too abstract-looking&mdash;altogether too impersonal
  and (the word was as vague as the impression Ommony was trying to fix in his
  mind) too fascinating. No European youngster could have looked as he did
  without stirring resentment in whoever watched. Samding aroused in the
  beholder only admiration and an itching curiosity.</p>

  Know then, your purest thoughts deny the Truth ye never saw!<br>
  If ye resent in discontent the searchlight of reproof,<br>
  Preferring praise, ye waste your days at sin's not Soul's behoof!<br>
  Each gain for self denies the Self that knows the self is vain.<br>
  Who crowns accomplishment with pride must build the whole again!<br>
  But if, at each ascending step, more clearly ye perceive<br>
  That he must kill the lower will, who would the world relieve<br>
  And they are last who would be first, their effort thrown away;<br>
  Be patient then and persevere. Ye tread the Middle Way!<br>
  &mdash;<i>The Lama's Law</i></p>

  <p class="first">THE MOMENT the last woman had vanished from the room the
  Lama let Samding help him to his feet and clucked, snapping his fingers to
  Diana. She glanced at Ommony, he nodded, immensely curious, and promptly she
  trotted to the Lama's side as matter-of-factly as if she had known him all
  her life.</p>

  <p>The Lama and the chela went down to the room below, taking Diana with
  them. The chela spread out the mat, rearranged it in accordance with the
  Lama's instructions, and the two sat down on it facing the balcony,
  conversing in low tones, evidently waiting for something preordained to
  happen. Diana sniffed around the room, inspecting cushions curiously, but
  they took no apparent notice of her. After a minute or two she sat down and
  looked bored. Instantly the Lama called to Ommony:</p>

  <p>"Can you cause the dog to open her mouth, from where you are, without
  speaking?"</p>

  <p>Ommony stood up, his head and shoulders visible above the rail, and seeing
  him Diana pricked an ear. The trick was simple enough; ever since she was a
  puppy she had always dropped her jaw when he held up a finger at her; by
  education, for his own amusement, he had simply encouraged and fixed a habit.
  Her mouth opened, closed and opened wide again.</p>

  <p>Samding laughed delightedly, but the Lama very seriously beckoned to Diana
  to come nearer and she obeyed at a nod from Ommony. She wanted to sit on the
  mat, but the Lama would not allow that; he pushed her away and she squatted
  down facing the balcony, watching Ommony, awaiting orders.</p>

  <p>"Now again!" said the Lama.</p>

  <p>Ommony raised his finger. The ear went up, the mouth opened and stayed
  open until the finger was lowered.</p>

  <p>The Lama was as pleased as a child with a toy. Diana would have been
  satisfied to go through all her tricks, but a Tibetan entered through the
  door the women had used. The Lama froze into immobility and Samding followed
  suit.</p>

  <p>There entered a man whom Ommony knew from his photographs&mdash;Prabhu
  Singh&mdash;the almost middle-aged but younger son of a reigning rajah. He
  knew him well by reputation&mdash;had admired him in the abstract because he
  was notorious for independence and for fair, intelligent, outspoken and
  constructive criticism of foreign rule. He was said to be an intimate of
  Gandhi and was, in consequence, about as much appreciated by the ruling
  powers as a hornet at a tea-party.</p>

  <p>He was tall, lean, lithe, big-eyed under a plain silk turban and extremely
  simply dressed in tussore stuff that showed every line of his athletic figure
  &mdash;not very dark-skinned&mdash;clean-shaven except for a black mustache.
  He wore no jewelry, strode barefooted with manly dignity to a point midway
  between the Lama and the door, bowed low, and stood still. Diana went up and
  sniffed him. He showed surprise, but laid his hand on the dog's head and
  rubbed her ear.</p>

  <p>"Peace be with you. Peace perfect you in all her ways," the Lama
  boomed.</p>

  <p>"And to you, my father, peace," he answered. "Was it well done? Was
  anything lacking for your comfort? Have my servants failed in anything? Were
  there enough elephants?"</p>

  <p>"It is all good," said the Lama.</p>

  <p>"And the mission succeeded?"</p>

  <p>"The first part."</p>

  <p>The Lama's hand went into his bosom and produced the piece of jade. Prabhu
  Singh approached to the edge of the mat, received the jade into his hands,
  and stepped back to examine it, holding it to the light from a window. He did
  not appear to have any superstitious reverence for it, but handled it as if
  it were a work of art, rare and valuable.</p>

  <p>"I am glad," he said simply after about two minutes, handing it back to
  the Lama, who returned it to his bosom. The chela's eyes were missing
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"San-fun-ho!" said the Lama suddenly; and the chela stood up on the mat.
  Was the stage-name his real one? The mystery increased. Prabhu Singh's
  attitude underwent an instant change. He became embarrassed. He bowed three
  times with much more reverence than he had shown the Lama, and when the chela
  smiled the lineal descendant of a hundred kings was as nervous as a small boy
  being introduced to a bishop. Samding said something to him that Ommony could
  not catch, and the murmured answer seemed to be no more than a conventional
  formula of politeness. The chela was as perfectly at ease as if he had been
  receiving the homage of princes all his life.</p>

  <p>Prabhu Singh bowed again three times and retreated backward, stumbling
  against Diana and recovering his balance awkwardly. He appeared almost
  physically frightened; yet he was famous on polo fields from end to end of
  India, and was notorious for speaking his mind bluntly to viceroys at real
  risk of personal liberty. His back to the door at last, he made his escape
  with better grace, recovering presence of mind and remembering to salute the
  Lama.</p>

  <p>The moment the door shut the Lama turned on Samding and rebuked him in
  Tibetan; Ommony could only catch occasional sentences; but it seemed that the
  Lama was angry because Samding had not put the visitor at ease.</p>

  <p>"That is only vanity&mdash;self-approval. Worshipers are mockers... turned
  your head... I would rather see you pelted with stones... better for you and
  for them... break the shell of the egg before the chicken hatches ...
  sclaappkapp! (whatever that meant)... dirt under your feet will someday cover
  your grave... all these years and yet you know so little... if you are going
  to fail you had better not begin... presumption... "</p>

  <p>It was a wonder of a discourse. Samding listened, standing for a while,
  then sat down cross-legged&mdash;off the mat&mdash;facing the Lama
  &mdash;head bowed humbly&mdash;not once moving until Diana came and sniffed
  his neck to find out what the matter was.</p>

  <p>That stopped the Lama's flow of speech. He glanced up at the gallery and
  called to Ommony in an absolutely normal tone of voice, as if he had entirely
  forgotten the whole incident of Prabhu Singh's visit and the rebuke and all
  connected with it.</p>

  <p>"Now again, my son. Make the dog do the acting again."</p>

  <p>Samding resumed his position on the mat at the Lama's right hand; he, too,
  seemed to dismiss the lecture as if it had never taken place; and Ommony,
  directing from the gallery, made Diana open and shut her mouth. The Lama
  insisted on her doing it again and again and at last he and Samding chuckled
  together over it as if it were the greatest joke that ever happened. Still
  chuckling, they got up and left the room by the door leading to the street,
  taking the mat with them and locking the door as they went out. No
  explanation; not a word to Ommony as to what was expected of him; not even a
  backward glance at the gallery to suggest that they had him in mind. Ommony
  sat still for a while; then, whistling Diana, he made his way to the gallery
  door, found that open, and proceeded to explore; but he found all the other
  doors along the passage locked, except the one at the end that opened into
  the room assigned to himself.</p>

  <p>He looked through the window into the compound, where there were all kinds
  of noise and confusion. Four men were trying to throw a mule and several
  other mules had broken loose; an elephant was lying on its back near a water-
  butt while two mahouts scrubbed its belly; and two bull camels were fighting
  with everything except their tails while twenty onlookers heaped humorous
  advice on rather bored-looking experts who were watching for a chance to rope
  the brutes by the leg and separate them.</p>

  <p>And in the midst of all that riot, with the sun pouring down on them and
  crows and sparrows hopping about among them, Maitraya and his troupe sat on
  boxes, repeating their lines to one another.</p>

  <p>It appeared that the devil's part already had been written. Maitraya held
  a small scroll in addition to his own, and was trying to teach the lines to
  Dawa Tsering, who was disposed to believe he could play the devil better if
  left to his own resources.</p>

  <p>"I tell you, a devil is devilish!" he shouted. "A devil is like one of
  those bull camels&mdash;you never know what he'll do next! Or like a mule
  &mdash;you have to look out for his teeth and heels! This devil of yours is
  like a pretty gentleman. Here, let me show you how to act the devil!"</p>

  <p>But Maitraya stuck to it, patiently correcting the Hillman's
  mispronunciation of the Urdu words. Catching sight of Ommony through the
  window, he called to him to come out and take part in the rehearsal; but the
  door was still locked, and though he could have climbed through the window
  easily enough Ommony hardly liked to confess that he was locked in, not
  knowing what effect that news might have on Maitraya. After a moment's
  hesitation he excused himself on religious grounds:</p>

  <p>"I must recite the mantras."</p>

  <p>Even Maitraya, possessed by the almost absolute of religious cynicism,
  respected that Brahmin's privilege, so Ommony was left to his own
  meditations, which were mixed, amused and mystified in turn.</p>

  <p>His thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door behind him. The chela
  came in. He had changed his clothes again and was in the same snuff-colored
  robe in which Ommony first saw him in Chutter Chand's back room. His face was
  an enigma&mdash;a mask with a marvelous smile on it; but the eyes, to Ommony,
  suggested excitement; or, it might have been, extremely keen amusement; at
  any rate, some strong emotion was shining through the self- controlled
  exterior. The remarkable thing was, that the youngster's calm did not suggest
  fanatical asceticism or conceit. He seemed human, curious and not
  unfriendly.</p>

  <p>Diana's tail thumped on the floor. Flies buzzed in and out through the
  window. There was nothing in the situation to cause nervousness, and yet
  Ommony confessed to himself that he felt an inclination to shudder; the sort
  of inclination that forewarns a man of something that his eyes cannot see. He
  spoke first, purposely in English, hoping to catch the chela off- guard:</p>

  <p>"Maitraya has suggested that those young women who are with the party are
  your wives. That seems improbable. Tell me the truth about it."</p>

  <p>If eyes mean anything, the chela understood; he was laughing. No muscle of
  his face moved. He pretended to assume that the words were some form of
  greeting, and answered in kind, in Tibetan, then broke into Urdu:</p>

  <p>"Tsiang Samdup sends a blessing. He is unwilling that you should speak of
  what occurred this morning."</p>

  <p>"You mean, of the performance of the dog?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>But the chela appeared to be an expert in dealing with stupidity. "Of
  anything that occurred." Ommony chose another angle of assault:</p>

  <p>"Whatever the holy Lama wishes. Kindly tell him so. As long as I am his
  guest, I will be silent. Wait!"</p>

  <p>The chela had started to go, but Ommony stepped between him and the door
  and stood with his back to it.</p>

  <p>"Don't be alarmed."</p>

  <p>But the chela had only retreated a pace or two. Excepting that, he seemed
  hardly more than curious to know what would happen next. It was Ommony who
  felt uncomfortable. "I want you to tell me," he said, "whether it was Tsiang
  Samdup or someone else who educated you and those young women."</p>

  <p>The chela, still standing erect, did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Come on, tell me. There must be someone else besides the Lama."</p>

  <p>"Is that why you stand between me and the door?" the chela asked. The
  voice was ironic&mdash;amused. Ommony tried emphasis:</p>

  <p>"I won't let you go until you answer a few questions. Tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the chela had already gone. He had crossed the room in three strides,
  laid a hand on the window-ledge, and vaulted through, tucking his legs up
  neatly under his chin and landing almost noiselessly on the veranda. He
  contrived the whole swift maneuver without a moment's loss of dignity, and
  walked away unruffled, not glancing behind him.</p>

  <p>Ommony strode to the window feeling cheap, wishing he had gone about
  things differently; he supposed it would take an interminable time now to
  establish himself in the chela's confidence; he had possibly totally ruined
  his chance of doing that. The chela was sure to go straight to the Lama and
  tell him.</p>

  <p>But there stood the Lama, in the midst of the group of actors, with
  Samding already beside him; and apparently Samding was talking about the play
  to Maitraya; the Lama seemed to be encouraging Dawa Tsering to rehearse his
  lines. They did not glance in Ommony's direction. But a minute or two later a
  Tibetan came and unlocked the door, and when Ommony stepped out under the
  veranda the Lama turned and beckoned to him.</p>

  <p>However, the Lama had nothing to say. He led the entire troupe at once
  toward the elephant stalls, down a gangway between two of the big beasts,
  whom he saluted in passing as if they were human beings, and through a gate
  at the rear into an alley fifty yards long. The alley seemed to have been
  used as a sheep-corral the preceding night; there were some loose boards that
  probably served to enclose it. Across its end ran a street, in which a dozen
  or more nondescript humans lounged in front of back doors. It was a back
  street; all the houses faced the other way, their rears were an irregular
  jumble of yards and walls, with empty kerosene cans, rubbish heaps and faded
  cotton purdahs* much in evidence.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>purdah</i>&mdash;a curtain, a veil; any kind of
  screen. Women who keep out of sight of men are known as purdah-nashin.]</p>

  <p>The Lama led straight across the street into a doorway, and down a long
  passage that admitted to the wings of a fair-sized theater, almost modern in
  some of its details.</p>

  <p>Someone had been busy, for the stage was set. A hideous back-drop had been
  almost concealed by branches up-ended, that gave a very good suggestion of a
  clump of trees; and in front of those, in mid-stage, was a wickerwork affair
  covered with cotton cloth that had been painted to look like the stone-work
  of an old well; a beam with a rope thrown over it, supported on two uprights
  completed the illusion well enough. The flies had been very simply painted to
  resemble house corners at the end of a street, and the whole scene suggested
  the extreme fringe of a village, with the audience looking out through it
  toward the open country.</p>

  <p>For a wonder, there was electric light, although none too much, and the
  switchboard was a mystery, painted red and labeled in English "Keep
  away!"</p>

  <p>At the rear of the theater and along both sides was a balcony for women,
  screened off with narrow wooden slats that left openings about four inches
  square. The orchestra "pit" was a platform, three feet lower than the stage,
  in full view of the audience. The musicians were already squatting there
  &mdash;Tibetans to a man; four were armed with radongs;* four more had
  tomtoms; the remaining dozen were provided with stringed instruments. The
  radongs blew a fog-horn blare to greet the Lama as he stepped on to the
  stage.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>radong</i> (Tibetan)&mdash;a sort of trumpet; very
  long, with the bell-shaped end set at an angle to the tube.]</p>

  <p>In the opposite wing, no longer in white or in stockings, protected by
  three stalwart Tibetans, who lounged in the flies, were the women of mystery.
  They were in costume, which so orientalized them that Ommony almost doubted
  recognition. Memory plays strange tricks; his took him back to the day when
  he and Benjamin had played a part at Chota Pegu and the nautch girls had been
  wild with inquisitive mischief&mdash;ready to betray the chief-priest at a
  nod. These girls now, in gauzy draperies, less naked, but as subtle in their
  motions, so resembled those nautch-girls at first glance that he was not sure
  they were the same he had seen in the room among the Hindu ladies until he
  noticed that they laughed and chattered on a comparatively low note instead
  of a high-pitched dissonance.</p>

  <p>The Lama clapped his hands and sat down inside the well, where he could
  see out through holes in the painted cloth. Then he told Ommony to make Diana
  sit down almost exactly in front of the well, and the rehearsal began at
  once, as if preordained from the beginning of time, the girls in their Indian
  costume mingling with the stage crowd, and so well versed in their part that
  they pushed the other actors into place, needing no direction by the
  Lama.</p>

  <p>Ommony had plenty of chance to observe some of them closely, for three had
  been told to engage the saddhu in mock-conversation during parts of the first
  act. One&mdash;the Gretchen-girl&mdash;put an offering into his begging-bowl.
  But though he missed his cue twice through trying to engage her in real
  whispered conversation, he failed; she was as evasive as abstract
  thought&mdash;as apparently engaging and as actually distant as a day-dream.
  She turned every advance he made into an excuse of by-play for the imaginary
  audience's benefit, and all Ommony accomplished was to draw the Lama's irony
  from behind the well:</p>

  <p>"Some saddhus hide lascivious hearts under robes of sanctity, but you are
  supposed to be one who has truly forsaken the pursuit of women, Gupta
  Rao!"</p>

  <p>When the laugh that followed that rebuke had died down Ommony was still
  not sure of the Gretchen-girl's real nationality. He had tried her with
  English, French, German and two or three Indian languages, watching her face,
  but detecting no expression that suggested she had understood him. As for the
  others, one might be a Jewess; but there are many well-bred women, for
  instance in Rajputana, and in Persia, who are fair-skinned and who resemble
  Jewesses in profile. Even fair hair was no proof of their origin; most
  eastern women, but by no means all, have dark hair.</p>

  <p>The only really convincing evidence that they were Europeans was their
  behavior, and even that was offset by the fact that some of them were
  certainly Tibetans, whose manner was equally unembarrassed in the presence of
  men, yet equally free from familiarity. The difference from their behavior
  and that of Maitraya's actresses grew more and more noticeable as the
  professionals became aware of an atmosphere to which they were utter
  strangers. They tried at first to imitate it; then grew resentful and
  sneered; resorting at last to low jests in loud whispers and attempts to
  scandalize by bold advances to the men&mdash;until at last the Lama stood up
  in the well like a priest in a pulpit and beckoned those three women to come
  and stand in front of him.</p>

  <p>"I could show you your secret hearts," he said, in a kind voice that was
  much more withering than scorn, "and ye would die in horror at the sight. It
  is not good to slay, not even with the rays of truth. So I show you instead
  what ye may become." Mildly, patiently, a little wearily, as if he had done
  the same thing very often, he included all his own mysterious family in a
  gesture that conveyed diffidence and hesitation. "Life after life ye shall
  struggle with yourselves before ye shall come as these. And these are nothing
  &mdash;nothing to what ye may become. The road is long, and there are
  difficulties; but ye must face it. Take advantage of the moment, for it is
  easier to imitate than to find the way alone. Ye cannot undo the past, nor
  can all the gods, nor He who rules the gods, undo it. But now, this moment,
  and the next one, and the next, forever, ye yourselves by thought and act
  create the very hair's-breadths of your destiny.&mdash;Now let us begin
  again, from the beginning."</p>

  <p>They began again so meekened and subdued that for a while the first act
  suffered. But that was overcome by Diana, who produced such peals of laughter
  that the Lama had difficulty in restoring order and had to reprimand the
  musicians for thrusting their heads above the level of the stage to watch. At
  a signal from Ommony standing near the wings, Diana's mouth opened and the
  Lama from inside the well croaked words that sounded, even on the stage, as
  if the dog were speaking them.</p>

  <p>When the shoemaker said "Ah, if I were king!" Diana's mouth opened wide
  and the retort came from behind her:</p>

  <p>"It might be better to be a dog like me and not worry so much!"</p>

  <p>The illusion was perfect because everybody on the stage looked at the dog
  as if expecting her to speak; and the best of it was that Diana cocked an
  ear, put her head to one side, and was immensely interested.</p>

  <p>In answer to the saddhu's, "How long will ye store up wrath against the
  day of reckoning?" there was put into Diana's mouth:</p>

  <p>"For myself I bury bones, but jackals come in the night and make away with
  them!"</p>

  <p>When the king asked, "Is this your gratitude?" and the saddhu replied, "To
  whom? For what?" Diana's retort was:</p>

  <p>"The saddhu is like the vermin on my back; he helps himself but isn't
  grateful. And when he is scratched he just goes to another place!"</p>

  <p>Diana was easy to manage, and Ommony's signals, made with his right hand,
  were invisible from the front of the theater on his left. But Dawa Tsering
  was a hard problem; he was supposed to be one of those wandering clown-fakirs
  who amuse and terrify village gatherings by alternately acting like idiots
  and pretending they are in communication with the underworld of demons and
  lost souls. He could neither remember his lines nor keep his head, but
  blundered in at the wrong cues and then laughed self-consciously. Ommony
  advised the Lama to dispense with him altogether.</p>

  <p>"Nay," said the Lama. "All things are good in the proper place. There is a
  part he can play."</p>

  <p>Whereat he ordered the stage set for the second act, which was a simple
  business. The flies reversed suggested a palace interior. Curtains at the
  rear concealed the greenery. The well was replaced by a carpeted dais with a
  large throne on top of it, inside which the Lama could conceal himself quite
  easily. A few heaps of cushions and settees were carried on the stage and
  while the change was being made the orchestra rehearsed amazing music.</p>

  <p>Tomtoms, radongs and stringed instruments thundered, howled and jingled
  like a storm in the Himalayas with the voices of a thousand disembodied
  spirits carrying on an argument in the teeth of wind and rain. It was
  stunning&mdash;weird&mdash;a sort of cataclysmic din foreboding marvelous
  events, but music, nevertheless, in every quarter-note of its disturbing
  harmonies.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII.</a><br>
  Diana Adopts Buskins</h2>

  <p class="quote">He who would reform the world must first reform himself; and
  that, if he do it honestly, will keep him so employed that he will have no
  time to criticize his neighbor. Nevertheless, his neighbor will be benefited
  &mdash;even as a man without a candle, who at last discerns another's
  light.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">WORK. Ommony had been a worker all his days, but had never
  known the real meaning of the word until that afternoon. The Lama, as placid
  as a temple idol, as exacting as fate, as tireless as time itself, kept
  everybody occupied. There was no return to the place across the street where
  the beasts of burden rested; the only pause between rehearsals was at noon,
  when food was brought in baskets and all except Ommony munched greasy
  chapatis in the wings; for him there was special food provided, brought by an
  ostensible Brahmin and served behind a screen.</p>

  <p>A Tibetan make-up man, a master craftsman, spread the tools of his trade
  on the stage behind the well and took every one in hand in turn under the
  Lama's critical supervision. Even Diana had to be touched up; daubs of paint
  were smeared around her eyes to make them look huge and supernatural, and her
  ordinary gauntness was enhanced by dark streaks that made her ribs appear to
  stand out prominently.</p>

  <p>Trunks full of costumes were dumped in the wings by methodical, matter-of-
  fact Tibetans, who seemed to have gone through the same performance scores of
  times and to know exactly what to do, and when, and how. They dressed the
  protesting actors more or less by main force, ignoring Maitraya's protests,
  pulling, adjusting, stitching, until every costume hung exactly as the Lama
  said it should. They provided Dawa Tsering with a devil-mask and a suit of
  dragon-scales&mdash;then showed him himself in a mirror, which entirely
  solved that problem; he liked himself so well in the disguise that he could
  have acted Hamlet in it. But all he was required to do was to laugh like a
  fiend at intervals, and to dance on and off stage whenever the Lama signaled
  from behind the well. He was supposed to be the spirit of the underworld who
  mocked men's efforts.</p>

  <p>There was no supper; nobody remembered it. Rehearsals continued until they
  had to lower the curtain because the audience began to straggle in and squat
  on the matted floor in groups, munching betel-nut. The orchestra tuned up at
  once. Three quarters of an hour before the curtain was supposed to rise the
  house was crowded to suffocation. Stunned by the music, which crashed and
  blared arresting heraldry of doom or something like it (and nothing
  fascinates as much as doom fore-trumpeted) the audience forgot to talk. When
  the curtain went up slowly as if raised by the last resounding boom of the
  radongs there was utter silence, in which the thrill behind the women's
  gallery grating could almost be felt in the wings.</p>

  <p>And at the very last minute, before the king walked on, the Lama, from
  behind the well, signaled to Dawa Tsering to laugh like a ghoul and dance
  across the stage. It was inspiration. In a country that believes implicitly
  in devils, that following the cataclysmic music produced the perfect state of
  mind in which to watch the play; when Maitraya walked on he was heard with
  almost agonied attention. There was not a gasp from the audience until it was
  Diana's turn to speak, when the Lama croaked her line so comically that even
  the actors laughed; and, presumably because the gods who guard coincidence
  approved, she put her head to one side and cocked an ear at the audience.</p>

  <p>It brought the house down. It was so exactly timed to break suspense, the
  marvel that a dog should speak was so astonishing, that an earthquake after
  that could hardly have called the crowd's attention to itself. Every spoken
  word and every move was watched as if earth's destiny depended on the actors'
  lips, and Diana's three short speeches were received as if some god in the
  form of an animal were on the stage. When she had spoken about vermin the
  Lama tickled her with a straw and she scratched herself; and shrill laughter
  from behind the women's grille gave evidence that not a gesture of her left
  hind-foot was missed. When the curtain came down at the end of the prologue
  the applause out-thundered the orchestra.</p>

  <p>"It succeeds!" announced Maitraya, strutting across the stage in the way
  of the scene-shifters. "I told you so! I said it would! Trust me to know.
  Acting&mdash;good acting-technique can accomplish anything!"</p>

  <p>The Lama recognized familiar symptoms and was prompt. He gathered all the
  actors close around him in the wings and what he said was aimed straight at
  Maitraya, although he appeared to be watching Dawa Tsering through the corner
  of his eye:</p>

  <p>"That which is not excellent is not good. There shall be no second act,
  unless I can be sure of more attention to my signals. I am disappointed. If
  we can do no better before such an audience as this, what could we hope to do
  in the large cities?"</p>

  <p>Dawa Tsering nearly burst the devil-mask with indignation.</p>

  <p>"Thou!" he exploded. "Go back to thy monastery! I will entertain these
  princes and princesses! Hah! This is the greatest success there ever
  was!"</p>

  <p>"You will not be needed," said the Lama, and at a sign from him, as if
  they had known from the first what to expect, three Tibetans seized Dawa
  Tsering and led him away to a small room at the rear where his roars of
  protest were inaudible.</p>

  <p>That was all that was needed. Even the vainglorious Maitraya forced
  himself into a careful frame of mind, and the second act began as the first
  had done, with everybody striving to deliver each line as the Lama wished
  it.</p>

  <p>Quite early in the second act the girls came on to dance and entertain the
  king's court. They were preceded by mysterious music, quiet and rhythmic,
  pulsing with a tomtom under-throb that made the audience breathe in time to
  it and sway unconsciously.</p>

  <p>They floated on to the stage, barefooted, swinging so perfectly in unison
  that each seemed to reflect the other. Lowered lights produced a filmy,
  other-world effect. What little sound they made was swallowed by the pulsing
  subdued music, until one radong boomed an arresting note and they began to
  sing, never changing the dance step, weaving in and out and around and around
  as reflections mirrored in the water weave interminably. Song, step and
  dimness were all in harmony. There was one mysterious, monotonous refrain
  that held a hint of laughter, and yet such sadness as is felt when the
  wild-fowl cry across treeless wastes under a rainy sky.</p>

  <p>And there was no more than just enough of it to make the audience feel
  that it had not had enough&mdash;no encore, although the stifling theater
  became a pandemonium of acclamation and the king's next speech had to be
  twice repeated from the throne (the Lama, underneath the throne, insisted on
  it, lest the audience should miss one word of the thought-laden lines).</p>

  <p>Diana had only one line in the second act. When the king, worried and
  perplexed by the ignorant disputing of his courtiers, exclaimed, "Oh, who is
  wise enough to tell these idiots what to do?" Diana walked up to the throne,
  turned at a signal from Ommony to face the audience, and from under the
  throne the Lama croaked:</p>

  <p>"A wise dog chooses its own master and obeys him. It saves lots of
  trouble!"</p>

  <p>Then she walked off, swaying her long tail contentedly as if she had
  solved the riddle of the Sphinx. Because of the heat, that made the grease-
  paint on the actors' faces run, her tongue lolled out and she seemed to be
  grinning in response to the applause as she vanished into the wings.</p>

  <p>About midway through the second act Dawa Tsering was set free from durance
  vile and allowed to resume his ghoulishness, now somewhat chastened by
  conviction that after all he was not indispensable. There was nothing
  prearranged about his entrances, whenever a line fell flat or the action
  seemed to drag a little the Lama signaled for the devil to dance on and
  arouse laughter. He was particularly useful when Maitraya remembered he was
  an actor instead of acting the part of a king; the devil was immediately
  summoned then to take the conceit out of him by burlesque antics.</p>

  <p>There was nothing in the play an audience could misinterpret, for it
  mirrored their own melancholy to them and their own confusion, while Samding
  in the Chinese robes of San-fun-ho laughed at it triumphantly, his golden
  voice repeating lines that suggested, hinted, vaguely alluded to a way out of
  all the difficulties that he knew all about, even if nobody else did. All
  through the second act Samding's lines were mockingly destructive, as one
  actor after another, from king to saddhu, tortured imagination with his own
  ideas of how to make the world convenient to live in. Between them they
  proposed almost every solution that has ever passed current in the realm of
  politics, and the saddhu seasoned the stew with peppery religious nostrums;
  but when, before the curtain fell, they all decided they were better off as
  shoemakers and goatherds Samding still mocked them. Nevertheless, there was a
  hint in his last line of a solution if they chose to look for it:</p>

  <p>"Ye mortals, there is no success in jealousy. There is no comfort in
  complaint. Ye win no excellence by finding fault."</p>

  <p>The applause made the curtain swing and sway but it did not drown the
  orchestra for quite so long as after the first act. It changed into a buzz of
  conversation, syncopated, rising from a low note to a higher one in choppy
  sound-waves of expectancy; and when the curtain rose on the scene by the well
  at dawn there was silence in which the mouse-note creaking of a door moved by
  a draught of hot air sounded like whip-cracks.</p>

  <p>The rising sun would hardly have passed muster with a western audience. It
  was a thing of gilded wood, on which the strongest electric light available
  was focused from the wings, but to the eastern mind, long versed in
  symbolism, it was intelligible, and the fact that mystic signs were painted
  on its face enhanced its effect. There was no need to tell anyone that
  San-fun-ho had used the magic jade at dawn to restore every one to his
  original condition. There they all were, grouped before the well, with the
  dancing girls costumed as members of a village crowd and some Tibetans in the
  background helping to swell the number.</p>

  <p>The whole of that last act belonged to San-fun-ho, who stood before the
  well with the magic jade in his right hand and, with the rising sun behind
  him, revealed the mystery of hope and courage. The jade gleamed like a living
  thing whose light came from within. His voice was like a peal of magic bells
  rung by the gods who keep the secrets of the dawn. His face was lit with
  reassuring laughter. His manner was as one who had experienced all emotions
  and had conquered fear.</p>

  <p>It was a long speech; its delivery required ten minutes, but the audience
  received it as the East receives a benediction always, straining breathlessly
  to catch the subtleties of meaning, preferring allegories and a proverb now
  and then to meat and drink.</p>

  <p>"... Does dawn die? Nay, it passes on. It lives forever. Dawn is dawn, and
  never changes. Discontent is discontent; its fruits are of the elements of
  discontent&mdash;all bitter&mdash;none can sweeten them. Who wallows in the
  mire of jealousy, and blames another for the want he feels, may load his bins
  aburst with golden goods, but he shall know more smarting jealousy and ache
  with gnawing wants he never guessed.</p>

  <p>"But hope&mdash;is hope not sweet? And is the fruit of sweetness bitter!
  Nay. I tell you, Hope is a creative force whose limitless dimensions lie
  within the boundary of each existing minute. Irresistible, Hope's magic is
  accomplished now. It comprehends no lapse of time. Nay! Instant are its dawn,
  its noon and its accomplishment! Hope, if it is true hope, fills the mind,
  affording malice and deceitful dread no room. Hope lives in action. All the
  elements of hope are deeds done now!</p>

  <p>"Deeds&mdash;the very echoes are the fruit of deeds! One stone laid on
  another in Hope's name is greater service to the gods than all the pomp of
  conquest and the noise of prayer! A deed&mdash;who measures it? Who knows the
  limits of a mended wheel or reckons up the leagues it shall lay
  underfoot?&mdash;what burdens it shall bear?&mdash;whose destiny it shall
  await and serve? A new-born Krishna may descend into the world&mdash;and ride
  on it to glories such as earth has never known!</p>

  <p>"O people, ye have over-praised calamity! Too much ye have considered
  night; and not enough have ye observed the dawn! Your hope has died because
  ye starved it like a pot-bound plant within the shell of envy, in the drought
  of greed! Too truly ye have longed to gain and to possess; too little ye have
  hoped to add one gift to each gift-laden moment as it comes!</p>

  <p>"Lay one stone on another, and give thanks! Add one deed to another and
  sing praises to the lords of tide and time who measure the ant's labors and
  record kings' idleness! Sing! Your very song shall vibrate in the universe
  when ye return to earth a thousand lives from now!"</p>

  <p>The orchestra stole its way into his last half-dozen sentences and, as he
  finished, burst into the splendid opening bars of a hymn that was already
  ancient when the Hills were young. Conquering, it sounded, rising,
  overturning, splendid with the bloom of life and Hope that knows it is
  immortal.</p>

  <p>And how those girls, and the trained Tibetan chorus massed behind them,
  sang! They swept the audience along with them into a surging spate of sound
  whose melody was like the rolling wonder of long rivers.</p>

  <p>The curtain came down amid such deafening applause that not even the
  radongs could blare above the thunder of it and the Lama had to shout like a
  mountaineer to make himself heard behind the scenes. Ommony had seen no
  messenger arrive, no consultation held, but the word the Lama shouted rang
  with a strange note of anxiety, and though the audience was yelling for more
  song, and to see the dog again, the stage and the wings took on the aspect of
  a stricken camp&mdash;all haste, all running to and fro, but strangely no
  confusion.</p>

  <p>Ommony was seized and stripped of his saddhu's costume&mdash;left to dress
  himself in Brahmin clothes as best he might, while Maitraya fought against a
  similar indignity with as much effect as if he were a scarecrow struggling
  with a Himalayan wind. The other actors threw their costumes off before the
  wardrobe men could get to them; and before they could pull on their ordinary
  clothes the framework of the well and every detail of stage furniture had
  vanished. The girls had disappeared almost before the echo of the Lama's
  warning cry had ceased, and within five minutes from the time the curtain
  came down Ommony found himself alone in the wings with Diana and Dawa
  Tsering, who wanted to stay there and brag of his performance.</p>

  <p>"I have made up my mind I will be an actor, Gupta Rao! I am good at it!
  Did you hear how they laughed when I showed myself! That play would have
  failed but for me! Ha-hah! The Lama knew it, too! He had to tell his lousy
  Tibetans to let me out of that room back there, so that I might come and save
  the day!"</p>

  <p>Ommony did not waste time to disillusion him, but even so they were nearly
  caught by a tide of men who tried to surge in through the stage door,
  sweating, laughing, shouting questions, wanting to know when the next
  performance would take place, wanting to see the dog and to hear her talk
  again, demanding to be shown the Chinese actor and to know whether he was
  really Chinese&mdash;above all, when would the next performance be?</p>

  <p>Ommony had to shove his way through the midst of them, holding Diana by
  the collar and hustling Dawa Tsering, who wanted to stop and wallow in
  flattery. Not even loud commands to keep their unclean fingers off a "twice-
  born" served to keep the crowd from getting in the way; and they would have
  followed across the street to the elephant stable if Ommony had not thought
  of telling them that the dog must be fed before she could possibly go to the
  temple of Siva and speak a couple of mantras from the street near the temple
  porch. (It was quite safe to mention the temple of Siva; there is always one
  where there are Hindus.) They stampeded toward the temple to take up good
  positions, and only a few small boys saw Ommony, Dawa Tsering and the dog go
  into the elephant compound by way of the alley, which was full of sheep
  through which they had to thread their way.</p>

  <p>The pitch-dark compound was in quiet confusion. There were camels being
  loaded, and the elephants were all in line beside the balcony, from whose
  upper deck the girls, already masked in black, were stepping down like
  goblins into the curtained howdahs. Ommony found the Lama, Samding beside
  him, standing near the last elephant of the line; and as he drew near, some
  one whose outline suggested Prabhu Singh returned thanks for the Lama's
  blessing and disappeared into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Why the hurry?" Ommony demanded. "They came crowding to the door to
  insist on another performance. Why not stay and give it?"</p>

  <p>"My son," the Lama answered, with the slightest trace of tartness in his
  voice, "no course is good unless there are seven reasons for it, even as no
  week is whole that has not seven days. You may ride on that elephant&mdash;
  that third one. May peace ride with you."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">CHAPTER XIX.</a><br>
  A Message from Miss Sanburn</h2>

  <p class="quote">He who is wise is careful not to seem too virtuous, lest
  they who dislike virtue should exert unceasing energy to demonstrate that he
  is viler than themselves. True virtue suffers from advertisement.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">A TUMULT in the street announced that Ommony's ruse had only
  gained a moment's respite. The night was alive with curiosity; a voice that
  bellowed like a fog-horn asked who the actors were&mdash;when they would
  perform again&mdash;whether San-fun-ho was a Mahatma&mdash;if so, which of
  all the pantheon he favored. Another voice shouted for San-fun-ho to come out
  and speak.</p>

  <p>However, it appeared the Lama had foreseen all that. The bleating sheep
  gave notice that the barrier was down and the crowd swarmed into the alley.
  But a string of elephants to all appearance loaded filed down the alley from
  the compound and the crowd had to retreat; those elephants paraded through
  the town streets, drawing the crowd after them, and there were no spectators
  when the gate at the opposite end of the compound opened and the Lama's long
  procession&mdash;camels, elephants and this time mules as well&mdash; swayed
  toward open country.</p>

  <p>The same Tibetan shared a howdah with Ommony, Dawa Tsering and Diana, and
  was just as uncommunicative as before. They crossed a railway line; an engine
  whistled and they had to cling to the howdah when the elephant climbed an
  embankment and descended on the far side; and once there was hollow thunder
  underfoot as the procession crossed a long bridge. The pace was much more
  leisurely than on the first night, and there were fewer interruptions; but
  twice out of the darkness, once in the gloom of overhanging trees, and once
  where the crimson glow of a bonfire shone through the howdah curtains,
  muttered orders came from men on foot and the direction changed.</p>

  <p>About two hours before dawn a halt was called in what appeared to be some
  kind of royal park; there was a wall all around it and there were peculiar
  walled subdivisions, but nothing to show who the owner might be. The
  elephants, camels and mules returned by the way they had come, leaving the
  baggage heaped in a clearing between trees. Somebody shouted a long series of
  incomprehensible commands, repeating it all three times, and Ommony was
  hurried away to a tent in a triangular space with a stone wall on either hand
  and trees in front. There was a good bed in the tent, and a generous meal all
  ready on a linen-covered table.</p>

  <p>When Ommony had finished eating Samding emerged out of the darkness like a
  ghost and stood framed in the tent opening, looking like a cameo against the
  sky.</p>

  <p>"Tsiang Samdup sends a blessing," he said calmly. "He requests that you
  will not leave this enclosure. Kindly do not go beyond the trees."</p>

  <p>He disappeared again. It was not until he had gone that it occurred to
  Ommony the language he had used was English. Speaking, thinking in two
  languages concurrently, occasionally listening to a third, one does not
  identify them without an effort. For a minute or two Ommony sat still, trying
  to recall the chela's voice, intonation and accent; it seemed to him that if
  the words had not been perfectly pronounced he would have noticed instantly
  that the chela was talking English, not Urdu. He recalled the exact words one
  by one. "Blessing," "enclosure" and "the" were key-words that would
  inevitably have betrayed a foreign accent had there been one; as far as he
  could remember all three words had been stressed exactly as a well educated
  Englishman would use them; he was sure there had been no accent on the vowel
  in "the"&mdash;a shibboleth that everlastingly betrays the Asian born.</p>

  <p>"I'll swear that youngster is European," he muttered&mdash;and then
  laughed at himself. No European&mdash;certainly no English youth ever had it
  in him to seem so saintly and at the same time to be so inoffensive. There
  would have been an almost irresistible impulse to kick any western youth who
  dared to look as virtuous as that. One did not want to kick Samding.</p>

  <p>Ommony turned Diana loose to roam wherever she pleased; no inhibition had
  been laid on her. He hoped natural canine curiosity might lead her to make
  new acquaintances who in some way would help to throw light on the mystery;
  for as he threw himself on the bed to sleep the whole thing seemed a deeper
  mystery than ever. Was it propaganda intended to foist Samding on the country
  as a new mahatma? A political mahatma, who should bring on revolution? If so,
  why the sudden flight? What could be the advantage of creating intense
  enthusiasm and then running away from it?</p>

  <p>He was awakened late in the morning by a man who removed the dishes and
  spread a fresh meal on the linen-covered table. The man was someone he had
  not seen before, as silent as an oiled automaton. Diana was coiled up asleep
  on her sacking. Dawa Tsering, smelling hot food, awoke with a start to devour
  it, and it was he who first noticed the silence.</p>

  <p>"Gupta Rao, we are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He left his bowl of food and ran to the trees that screened the end of the
  enclosure, peered between them, and came hurrying back with a grin on his
  face.</p>

  <p>"It is true. They have gone and left us!"</p>

  <p>Ommony's obstinate jaw came forward with a jerk. An insult from the Lama's
  lips could not have produced a tenth of the effect.</p>

  <p>"Damn him after all!" he muttered. "I admitted I was spying. If he'd
  simply asked me to clear out, I'd have gone and waited for him at Tilgaun.
  I'll be blowed, though, if I'll let up now. I'll trace him if I have
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He sat down on the bed, glancing in the dog's direction, wondering how
  much she had seen in the night and wishing she could really talk. She was
  curled up fast asleep, but his eye detected something on her collar. He
  called her, and removed a piece of paper that had been wired to the brass
  ring; it was twisted and soiled, but the writing on the inside was perfectly
  legible, English, and done in heavy quill pen strokes that he believed were
  the Lama's, although there was no signature.</p>

  <p>"There is a time for silence and a time for speech; a time for seeing and
  a time for covering the eyes. This is the time for silence and not seeing.
  Obey him who will attend you."</p>

  <p>But the man in attendance had vanished. The only living creatures in sight
  outside the tent were crows on the top of the near-by wall and kites wheeling
  lazily overhead. There was almost perfect silence&mdash;no roofs&mdash;no
  smoke&mdash;nothing to suggest that there were human beings within ten
  miles.</p>

  <p>"I will explore," said Dawa Tsering. "That old Lama is a great one at
  writing letters that mean nothing. Maybe I shall find that fellow who brought
  the breakfast. If I beat him he may interest me with some news."</p>

  <p>Ommony sat still and read the note again. The Lama might be simply
  inducing him to waste time instead of starting in pursuit; but there were
  several other possibilities, not the least that the Lama's route might be
  leading somewhere where it would be dangerous for a foreigner to go
  disguised. There are individuals, in India as elsewhere, who would dare to
  ask the devil or even a Bhat-Brahmin for his identification papers.</p>

  <p>Another not unreasonable theory was that the Lama might be willing to be
  spied on at just such times as his actions were not mischievous, but would
  prefer to keep the spy at a distance when events of true importance were
  under way.</p>

  <p>At any rate, the wording of the note might be held to imply a diplomatic
  threat that disobedience would terminate all communication. And on the other
  hand, he supposed the Lama&mdash;a remarkably good judge of human nature
  &mdash;knew that he, Ommony, would not permit himself to be dropped into the
  discard quite so easily as that. If it was a trick, there would be more to it
  than merely leaving him behind; the best course was to sit still and await
  developments.</p>

  <p>He awaited them for fifteen minutes, and then Dawa Tsering came, but not
  as a free agent. He was being led by the ear, although his huge "knife" was
  in his right hand and there seemed to be nothing to prevent plunging it into
  his custodian's stomach. Diana growled a challenge and ran forward to sniff
  quarrelsomely at the legs of the stranger, who ignored her as if she were not
  there; after a few sniffs she seemed to recognize him and returned to the
  tent, where she lay down close to Ommony and watched. She had ceased
  growling. The hair on her neck was no longer on end.</p>

  <p>The stranger appeared to be a Sikh, but was possibly a Rajput. He was more
  than six feet tall, wore his black beard parted and brushed upward, looked
  extremely handsome in a gray silk turban whose end fell down over his
  shoulder, and was dressed in almost military looking khaki-jacket and
  trousers, with a gray silk cummerbund around his waist. He strode with
  consummate dignity that appeared to be natural, not assumed.</p>

  <p>He let go Dawa Tsering's ear when he came within three strides of the
  tent, and took no further notice whatever of the Hillman, who stood a couple
  of paces away and thumbed the edge of his weapon, making grimaces that were
  nearly as inhuman as the grin on the devil-mask he had worn on the stage.
  There was nothing to show there had been a struggle; both men's clothes were
  in order; neither man was breathing hard. The stranger's dark-brown eyes
  looked steadily into the gloom within the tent and he presently saluted after
  a fashion of his own, quite unmilitary, something like the ancient Roman,
  raising his right hand, palm outward.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ommony?" he asked, in English.</p>

  <p>"No!" roared Dawa Tsering. "Gupta Rao, thou ignorant idiot! A Bhat-
  Brahmin from Bikanir&mdash;a man who has a devil in him, who can teach thee
  manners!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm Ommony."</p>

  <p>There was something in the voice and in the eyes that warned Ommony there
  was nothing to be gained by evasion. He stood up and returned the salute,
  also in his own way, adding to the gesture of his right hand an almost
  unnoticeable finger movement. The other man smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am Sirdar Sirohe Singh, of Tilgaun."</p>

  <p>Ommony laughed sharply, the way a deep-sea captain coughs sarcastic
  comment when a pilot has missed the tide. Here was the Secret Service after
  all! It was Sirdar Sirohe Singh who had sent the written report of the
  missing piece of jade to McGregor.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he said abruptly, and made room on the bed for the sirdar to
  sit down. He did not try to pretend to be glad to see him, but the sirdar's
  next words altered the whole aspect of affairs.</p>

  <p>"I do hope my letter to Number One did no harm," he began, stretching out
  long legs in front of him and speaking at the tent wall. His English was
  almost perfect, but guttural and a trifle aspirated. "I was in a difficult
  position. As a member of the Secret Service I was obliged to report. As the
  Lama's friend I felt&mdash;naturally&mdash;other obligations. It was not
  until I learned that you were assigned to investigate that I ceased to
  worry."</p>

  <p>"Who told you?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I heard it. News travels, you know. No, I have not been in Delhi."
  (He had answered Ommony's thought; the question was unspoken.) "I arrived
  last night from the north. The Lama asked me to submit myself to your
  disposal."</p>

  <p>"Does this place belong to you?" asked Ommony, examining the calm strong
  profile against the light. He had heard that the sirdar was a wealthy
  landowner.</p>

  <p>"No. The Lama has the temporary use of it."</p>

  <p>"It was kind of you to&mdash;how did you express it?&mdash;submit yourself
  to my disposal. What I most need is information," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Ah. That is elusive stuff."</p>

  <p>"Not if you keep after it. Tell me what you know about the Lama."</p>

  <p>The sirdar turned his head quickly and looked straight at Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Did you receive a note from him?" he asked. "It was tied to the dog's
  collar."</p>

  <p>Ommony looked into the baffling dark eyes and could read nothing there
  except that the sirdar knew much more than he proposed to tell. He was also
  conscious of dislike, and knew that it was mutual.</p>

  <p>"Just to what extent are you at my disposal?" he asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>"I am to convey you to another place. Of course, that is, at the proper
  time and if you wish to go; not otherwise."</p>

  <p>"Will the Lama be there?"</p>

  <p>"Possibly."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you know of Samding."</p>

  <p>"Did you read the note?" asked the sirdar, again meeting Ommony's stare.
  "I have a message for you from Miss Sanburn at the Tilgaun Mission. She
  entertained me the night I left Tilgaun. I admitted to her it was possible I
  might meet you somewhere. She asked me to convey affectionate regards and to
  say that she would appreciate notice of exactly when she may expect you."</p>

  <p>Ommony turned that over in his mind for half a minute. He could imagine no
  legitimate reason why Hannah Sanburn should ask for notice in advance. As a
  trustee it was his duty to pay surprise visits. Mrs. Cornock-Campbell's story
  of a girl named Elsa of whose very existence he had never previously heard,
  was a perfectly good reason for paying his next visit unannounced.</p>

  <p>"When will you be seeing Miss Sanburn again?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite soon."</p>

  <p>"Will it be necessary to admit to her that you have seen me?"</p>

  <p>"Just as you like."</p>

  <p>"Please don't admit it then."</p>

  <p>The sirdar nodded; he seemed to regard the message as quite unimportant.
  Ommony followed the train of thought, however, and tried to catch him off
  guard with a question asked casually, as if he were merely making
  conversation:</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Miss Sanburn's friend Elsa lately?"</p>

  <p>But the sirdar was not to be caught. It was impossible to tell whether or
  not he knew any girl of that name.</p>

  <p>"Elsa?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I see you don't know her," said Ommony, unconvinced but judging it would
  be useless to pursue the subject. He did not see how a man who lived on the
  outskirts of such a small place as Tilgaun could very well be ignorant of the
  existence of Hannah Sanburn's remarkable protege, more especially since he
  was a trained and trusted member of the Secret Service, whose duty it would
  be to report any unusual circumstance. He did not doubt that the sirdar had
  been retained in the Secret Service roster as much to keep an eye on the
  Mission as for any other reason.</p>

  <p>"When are we to leave this place!" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Tonight. The Lama asked me to suggest to you the wisdom of not leaving
  the tent until I come for you&mdash;after the evening meal."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Ommony, standing up to cut short the interview. There
  was no sense in talking to a man who was determined to say nothing. "I'll be
  here when you come."</p>

  <p>The sirdar bowed with dignity and strode away. The moment he was out of
  earshot Ommony called Dawa Tsering into the tent.</p>

  <p>"Is my trunk in sight?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Nay, everything is gone. My yak-hair cloak is gone, and my good blankets.
  Those Tibetans&mdash;"</p>

  <p>That looked as if the Lama intended to await them somewhere. Ommony
  interrupted with another question:</p>

  <p>"How did that sirdar manage you so easily?"</p>

  <p>Dawa Tsering looked sulky. "I will lay him belly-upward one of these
  days!"</p>

  <p>"How did you come to let him lead you by the ear then?"</p>

  <p>"Huh! He lives at Tilgaun."</p>

  <p>"What of it?"</p>

  <p>"He is the friend of Missish-Anbun at the Mission."</p>

  <p>"What of that?"</p>

  <p>"He is also the friend of the Rajah of Tilgaun; and of the monks in the
  hills around Tilgaun; and of all the rascals who make Tilgaun a byword all
  the way from Lhasa to Darjeeling. He has a servant with him, who would have
  seen, and would have told tales, if I had done more than draw my knife; and I
  tell you, Ommonee, that dog of a sirdar's influence reaches all the way to
  Spiti. I don't want too many enemies; I have enough of them in Spiti as it
  is."</p>

  <p>"Why did you draw your knife?"</p>

  <p>"Because I saw him, and he saw me, and I said to him, 'Thou! We are not in
  Tilgaun. Have a care; the kites in this part are just as hungry as those that
  live farther to the north!'</p>

  <p>"And to that he said, 'Maybe. But the kites must say prayers to Garudi*,
  it is not I who must feed them.' And at that he took me by the ear and led me
  hither. He is altogether too despotic."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Garudi, Garuda</i> (Sanskrit: "eagle")&mdash;a
  lesser Hindu divinity, the mount (vahanam) of Vishnu, one of the main forms
  of God in Hinduism. Garuda is depicted as having a golden body, white face,
  red wings, and an eagle's beak and wings but a man's body. He wears a crown
  on his head like his master, Vishnu... <i>Wikipedia</i>.]</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you'll be a poor friend to rely on in a tight place," said
  Ommony, smiling.</p>

  <p>"I? I am a terror in a tight place! That is just what I am good at. But I
  like first to be sure it is a tight place, and that the luck is reasonable.
  Lately I have had bad luck. But wait and see!"</p>

  <p>He sat down to sharpen his knife with a small imported hone that he had
  stolen somewhere, humming to himself a song about the feuds of Spiti,
  where:</p>

  <p>"A white mist rolls into a valley and sleeps, O-ayee-O-ayee-O-ah! There's
  a knife in the mist, and a young widow weeps, O-ayee-O-ayee-O-ah!"</p>

  <p>Ommony lay on the bed in the tent and forced himself to accept the
  situation calmly. There was no use in racking his brains; the mystery now had
  become still more involved by the fact that Sirdar Sirohe Singh was a member
  of the Secret Service, who considered himself obligated to report unusual
  incidents to McGregor and yet did not hesitate to lend a hand in obscuring
  the very trail he had requested McGregor to investigate; who instantly
  returned the secret identification signal, and yet refused to give
  information; who had been ordered by McGregor to remain in Tilgaun and
  observe events, and yet did not mind showing himself within two days' march
  of Delhi (nearly a thousand miles from Tilgaun) to a fellow member of the
  Secret Service, who he had no reason to suppose would not report him!</p>

  <p>The mystery increased again when night fell. The same dumb, nondescript
  servant who had brought breakfast came with supper and hovered twenty yards
  away, signaling with a white cloth when Ommony had finished eating. Promptly
  in answer to the signal the sirdar stepped out from the trees with a lantern
  and called for Gupta Rao in a loud voice, retreating as Ommony advanced
  toward him until, on the far side of the belt of trees, Ommony was aware of
  shadowy forms of men&mdash;horses, at least a dozen of them in a long line,
  with gaps between&mdash;great shadowy carriages that filled the gaps as he
  drew nearer&mdash;and at last, smiling as placidly as if the new moon that
  shone like a sliver of pure gold over his shoulder were a halo he had just
  discarded, the Lama himself.</p>

  <p>Samding was in attendance, moving about among the horses, patting them;
  Ommony noticed him ease a bearing rein. The Lama nodded to Ommony, stepped
  into the foremost carriage followed by Samding, and drove away at a gallop,
  the carriage swaying like a big gun going into action. Sirdar Sirohe Singh
  pushed Ommony into the next carriage (which had only four horses, whereas the
  Lama's had six) allowed Diana just sufficient time to jump in behind him, and
  slammed the door, almost shutting it on the dog's tail. A whip cracked
  instantly and the carriage started rocking and bumping in the Lama's wake. A
  moment later a third and a fourth carriage followed.</p>

  <p>Within was almost total darkness. There were two windows made of slats,
  forming part of the doors; Ommony tried them both, but the slides were nailed
  in position. He opened a door and swung himself out on the footboard to get a
  view of the following carriages, which he could just discern through the
  gloom and the cloud of dust, their drivers swaying on the high box-seats and
  shouting as they plied the whip. There was no way of guessing whether Dawa
  Tsering had been left behind or not. He climbed back into the carriage,
  holding the door open, but could not see much except dust, darkness and
  occasional shadowy tree-trunks.</p>

  <p>The pace was furious. The flight was evidently prearranged, and managed
  perfectly. Horses were changed every ten miles or so, but whenever that
  happened men came to either side of Ommony's carriage and held the doors
  shut, riding on the footboards afterward until the place where the change was
  made was out of sight. The route, except at intervals, did not lie along
  macadamized roads; once they lurched into a dry stream-bed and followed that
  for a mile or two, the wheels sinking in sand. But that, too, had been
  foreseen; men were waiting there, who ran alongside and seized the wheels
  whenever they sunk too deep, toiling as silently and smartly as a gun
  crew.</p>

  <p>It was almost dawn when they rumbled over the paved streets of a fair-
  sized town, but there was nothing to show what town it was. At last squared
  stones rang underfoot, a great gate slammed, and a Tibetan opened the
  carriage door. Ommony found himself in a courtyard in front of what looked
  like a temple door, only there seemed to be no temple at the back of it
  &mdash;nothing but a wall and a dense thicket of trees on ground that sloped
  up-hill for more than a mile.</p>

  <p>The Tibetan, taking him by the elbow, led him up steps through the
  entrance and down again into a cavern that was lighted with little imported
  kerosene lamps set in niches in the hewn rock walls. There was a maze of
  passages to right and left, and one wide tunnel that wound snake-wise until
  it opened into a vault, part natural and part very ancient masonry, that
  would have held five thousand people.</p>

  <p>The Tibetan led him across that great crypt, down a passage at the far
  end, through a short tunnel into a shaft about fifty feet square at the base.
  Its sides sloped inward so as to be utterly unclimbable and seventy or eighty
  feet overhead was a patch of sky not more than twenty feet across.</p>

  <p>In the midst, exactly under the square patch of daylight was a tank, brim-
  full of clean water. On every side of the enclosure there were square
  openings half-concealed by curtains made of matting. Ommony was led through
  one of those into a cave about twenty feet long; very plainly but quite
  comfortably furnished, and there the Tibetan left him without a word.</p>

  <p>There was no restraint placed on him; he went and sat down in the opening,
  watching the dawn gradually fill the place with light until the clouds shone
  clearly reflected in the shallow tank.</p>

  <p>After a while the Lama entered, followed by Samding and several Tibetans,
  or men who looked like Tibetans; they crossed to the far side and disappeared
  through one of the curtained openings. Not long after that great quantities
  of food&mdash;enough for twenty or thirty people&mdash;were brought in
  earthenware bowls; enough for two men was set down beside Ommony and the
  remainder was carried through the opening through which the Lama had
  disappeared. Ommony was left entirely to himself. After a while he sent Diana
  to explore, but though she disappeared through the Lama's entrance and stayed
  within for more than half an hour, nothing came of it; she returned and lay
  down beside him with her head on her paws, as if she had no information to
  convey.</p>

  <p>So he proceeded to explore on his own account, commencing by merely
  walking around the tank. Nothing happened, so he peered into one opening that
  had no mat in front of it, walked in and found a cave almost exactly like his
  own, leading nowhere. He stayed in there a minute or two examining a very
  ancient carving on the wall, that bore no resemblance to any monument he had
  ever seen and yet was vaguely familiar; he could not guess its significance;
  it was extremely simple, almost formless, and yet suggestive of an infinite
  variety of forms; he tried to memorize it, for future reference, and then
  remembered that the glyph, with which the letter to McGregor in a woman's
  handwriting had been signed, was almost, if not quite the same shape.</p>

  <p>He was on his way out when Samding met him in the door, his brown turban
  and cloak outlined in gold by the daylight at his back. More than ever the
  chela seemed like someone from another world, and as usual he spoke without
  preliminary, in a voice no man could quarrel with:</p>

  <p>"Tsiang Samdup desires you should not ask questions." The words were
  English, beautifully spoken. "If anything is lacking for your comfort you are
  to command me."</p>

  <p>Ommony laughed. "All right. I command you. Explain what all this
  means!"</p>

  <p>Samding's face became lit with sudden laughter&mdash;not aggravating
  &mdash;friendly&mdash;wise&mdash;humorous:</p>

  <p>"Tsiang Samdup says, knowledge comes from within, not from without," he
  answered. "As a man thinks, so are his surroundings. Tsiang Samdup says, the
  eyes of curiosity see only what is not so, and it is not only a man's lips
  that ask questions; the eyes and the taste and the touch are all inquisitive,
  seeking to learn from without what shall deny the truth within. He who would
  see the dawn must wait for it; and even so, if he is blind, it will be
  darkness to him."</p>

  <p>"Where did you learn English?" Ommony demanded.</p>

  <p>"From within," said the chela. "All knowledge comes from within."</p>

  <p>Ommony laughed back at him. "All right. Tell me from within where Dawa
  Tsering is."</p>

  <p>"He shall tell you himself," said the chela.</p>

  <p>He stepped back and pointed to Ommony's cave. There sat Dawa Tsering in
  the doorway, scratching his back against the rock. The chela walked away,
  stroking Diana's head, who followed him as far as the entrance to the Lama's
  cave.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been?" asked Ommony, going over and standing in front of
  the Hillman.</p>

  <p>"Nowhere. I rode in the carriage behind you, with a lot of Tibetans. They
  are fools, and I won their money playing dice. Thinking to follow the luck,
  when I reached this place I discovered where those girls are&mdash;all in a
  big cave together&mdash;may it fall in and destroy them! They were too many,
  and they made a mock of me. But wait until I get them one at a time! I am not
  one to be mocked by women, Gupta Rao!"</p>

  <p class="first">DAWA TSERING would say no more about his adventure among the
  women, but it was plain enough that he had been made ridiculous. He was
  fortunate not to have been caught and manhandled; he realized it.</p>

  <p>"If it had not been for some Tibetans," he grumbled, and then lapsed into
  moody silence, sharpening his knife on the edge of the entrance to Ommony's
  cave.</p>

  <p>They were left entirely alone, watching birds that moved like specks on
  the infinite blue through the opening overhead, until night fell and the
  gloom within the shaft grew solid. Sound died with the light, and one lantern
  that a man set over the entrance to the Lama's cave made hardly any
  difference.</p>

  <p>They brought food again, with some bones for the dog, and a candle to
  stick on the floor of the cave; but nothing else happened until the Lama's
  sonorous voice called through the darkness and Ommony followed him down the
  tunnel into the vast cavern he had crossed that morning. It was already
  thronged with people seated on mats or on the bare floor, who filled the
  place with whispers; a shuffling of feet like the sound of wind and running
  water came from the entrance, where hundreds more were coming down the long
  tunnel.</p>

  <p>Such light as there was, came from little smoky lamps set on ledges in the
  rock walls. A bell rang when the Lama appeared and the orchestra, almost
  invisible in shadow, burst into tune such as Stravinsky never dreamed of,
  filling the cavern with din that made the hair rise&mdash;restless yearning
  noise, accentuated by the hoarse radongs. Across one end of the cavern a
  strong stage had been erected and a very rough curtain. The Lama led the way
  behind it, where the stage was already set and the makeup man was busy with
  the last of the actors. Tibetans pounced on Ommony and dressed him for his
  part by candlelight, but in the improvised wings, where the girls waited,
  whispering and laughing, there were batteries of acetylene lights all ready
  to be turned on, in charge of a man who looked like a Parsee.* Where the
  footlights should have been there were mirrors arranged to throw the light
  back in the actors' faces. Everything was make-shift; yet everything appeared
  to have been done by men who knew precisely what was wanted and who had
  worked without confusion to provide it.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Parsee, Parsi</i> (Persian)&mdash;a member of a

  earth, or water, the Parsis dispose of their dead by exposing the bodies in

  stone courtyard) where vultures devour them... <i>Columbia University
  Encyclopedia</i>.]</p>

  <p>Just before the play began the Lama went before the curtain and the music
  ceased. There was no light where he stood; to the audience he must have
  resembled a shadow dimly outlined on the dark cloth.</p>

  <p>He told a story interspersed with proverbs, and the only sound from the
  enormous audience was in the pauses, when they caught their breath. The
  moment his make-up was complete Ommony stood at the edge of the curtain,
  where he could hear and look out at the thousands of eyes, on which the faint
  light from the lamps shone like starlight on still water.</p>

  <p>"... So they spoke to the god who had come among them. And the god said,
  'Ye have a government; what more do ye want?' Whereto they answered. 'But the
  government is bad, nor is it of our choosing.' And the god said, 'Is the
  weather of your choosing?' And they said, 'Nay.' Whereat the god laughed
  pleasantly, for he was one who knew the cause and the effect of things. 'As
  for the weather,' he said, 'ye make the most of that. When it is hot ye wear
  lighter garments; and when it is cold ye light fires. When it rains ye stay
  indoors, and when it is dry ye sally forth. If a man complains about the
  weather, ye say he is a malcontent who should know that all sorts of weather
  are of benefit to some folk, and that all communities in turn receive their
  share of heat and cold and drought and moisture. Is that not so?' the god
  asked; and they answered, 'Yea.'</p>

  <p>"So the god asked them another question. 'If ye so adapt yourselves to
  what ye say is not of your contriving, how is it that ye say the government
  cannot be borne? Can ye say that the rain and the snow and the heat are good,
  but the government is not good?' And the god laughed loud at them saying,
  'Out of mischief and destruction no improvement comes. Like comes from like.
  Improvement is the product of improvement, not of violence. Ye have the
  government ye earn, exactly as the earth receives the weather it deserves.
  For the weather, which comes and goes, came and went before your time.
  Indeed, and also there were governments before your time. The weather has
  altered the hills and the plains. The governments altered your fathers and
  will alter you, and your sons after you.'</p>

  <p>"Thus said the god. And they answered, 'Aye. But what if we alter the
  government?' And the god said, 'Ye can change the name by which ye call it,
  and ye can slay those in authority, putting worse fools in their place, but
  change its nature ye cannot, ye being men, who are only midway between one
  life and another. But as the hills are changed, some giving birth to forests,
  some being worn down by the wind and rain, the weather becomes modified
  accordingly. And it is even so with you. As ye, each seeking in his own heart
  for more understanding, purge and modify yourselves, your government will
  change as surely as the sun shall rise tomorrow morning&mdash;for the better,
  if ye deserve it&mdash;for the worse if ye give way to passion and abuse of
  one another. For a government,' said the god, 'is nothing but a mirror of
  your minds&mdash;tyrannical for tyrants&mdash;hypocritical for
  hypocrites&mdash;corrupt for those who are indifferent&mdash;extravagant and
  wasteful for the selfish&mdash;strong and honorable only toward honest men.'
  And having spoken to them thus, the god departed, some remembering his words
  and some forgetting them. To those who remembered, life thereafter was not so
  difficult, because of hope that brought tolerance so that they minded each
  his own business, which is enough for any man to do. But to those who forgot,
  there was trouble and confusion, which each created for himself, but for
  which each blamed the government, which therefore persecuted him. Because a
  government is only the reflection of men's minds. May peace, which is the
  fruit of wisdom, perfect you in all your ways."</p>

  <p>The radongs roared, drowning the last echo of the sonorous benediction.
  The orchestra crashed into the overture. The Lama stepped behind the curtain
  with a glance to right and left to make sure every one was in his place, sat
  down behind the well and signaled for the play to begin.</p>

  <p>As before, Dawa Tsering danced on first, but in no other respect was the
  play quite the same as on the previous night. The Lama's signals, made at
  unexpected moments, changed things as if he were making music with the actors
  for his instrument. Sotto voce he prompted, and no one on the stage dared to
  slacken his attention for a moment for fear of missing a changed cue. He
  seemed to know how to adapt and modify the play to fit the different
  environment and, in keeping with the solemn gloom of the huge cavern, he
  subtly stressed the mystery. The acetylene lights threw a weird, cameo-like
  paleness over everything; the Lama made the most of that, instead of
  struggling to overcome it.</p>

  <p>Toward the end of the last act the audience was spellbound, for the moment
  too interested to applaud; and the Lama took advantage of that, too. He
  hurried in front of the curtain and stood with both hands raised, the
  messenger of climax.</p>

  <p>"Peace!" he boomed. "Peace is born within the womb of silence! Go in
  silence. Break not the thread of peace! Ye have conceived it! Bring it
  forth!"</p>

  <p>The orchestra played softly, blending sounds as gentle as falling rain
  with the burble of streams and the distant boom of waterfalls. There were
  bird notes, and the sighing of wind through trees&mdash;half-melancholy, yet
  majestic rhythm with an undernote of triumph brought out by the muffled
  drums.</p>

  <p>"And if they would not talk for a day or two, they might perhaps
  remember!" said the Lama, pausing as he walked past Ommony, who was being
  stripped of his saddhu's costume. "There is virtue in silence."</p>

  <p>"Listen, O Captain of Conundrums!" said Ommony, trying to speak with
  emphasized respect but failing, because a Tibetan was rubbing his face with a
  towel to remove grease-paint. "I can see I was too hasty to suspect you of
  wrong-doing. I capitulate. From now on, I'm your friend for all I'm worth."
  It was the most emotional speech he had made in twenty years, but emotion
  gripped him; he could not help himself.</p>

  <p>The Lama smiled, his wrinkles multiplying the shrewd kindness of the
  bright old eyes.</p>

  <p>"For all you are worth! If you knew, my son, how much that is, you might
  be less extravagant. Jump not from one emotion to another, lest you lose
  self-mastery!" He passed on, beckoning to Samding.</p>

  <p>There was the same swift, exactly detailed rush to pack up and depart; the
  same apparent flight for no apparent motive&mdash;this time in covered
  bullock-carts that creaked through dimly lighted streets, until they came to
  a pitched camp on the outskirts of town, where camels and horses waited.
  Thereafter, cloaked beyond recognition, everybody except the Lama rode
  horseback, he sitting on a camel at the head of the procession looking like
  an old enormous vampire, his head drooped forward on his breast.</p>

  <p>The girls rode surrounded by hooded men, who let no other men except
  Samding come near them. Ommony tried to draw abreast to see whether they sat
  their horses skillfully or not, but two Tibetans rode him off and, saying
  nothing, held his rein until the girls had a lead of a hundred yards. After
  that they kept two horses' lengths ahead of him, and even drove Diana back
  when Ommony sent her forward just to see what would happen.</p>

  <p>There was only a thin new moon, and the road ran for most of the distance
  between huge pipul trees that rendered the whole caravan invisible. Two hours
  after midnight they reached a village, where a change was made back to
  bullock-carts, which conveyed them to a town that they entered shortly after
  daylight and now, for the first time, no precautions were taken to prevent
  Ommony from learning where he was. The Lama had taken him at his word.</p>

  <p>Ommony laughed as he recognized the inevitable effect of that. He would
  almost have preferred continued mistrust. He must now regard himself as the
  Lama's guest. Intensely curious still, immensely interested, as much puzzled
  as ever, but satisfied that the Lama was, as he expressed it to himself, "a
  pukka* sportsman," he had to make up his mind to learn nothing that he might
  be called on to explain (for instance to McGregor) later on.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>pukka</i> (Hindi)&mdash;genuine, authentic;
  superior, first-class.]</p>

  <p>"I hate this business of condemning a man on mere suspicion. The old boy's
  entitled to the benefit of doubt. From me, from now, he gets it. I'm ashamed
  of having doubted him. Damn! I hate feeling ashamed!"</p>

  <p>Obstinacy has its good side. Having made up his mind that the Lama was
  entitled to respect, Ommony could no more have helped respecting and
  protecting him than he would have dreamed of not protecting, for instance,
  Benjamin in the old days when Benjamin was a fugitive from rank
  injustice.</p>

  <p>He began deliberately to shut his eyes to information. The advice of the
  Chinese prince-poet, not to watch your neighbor too closely when he is in
  your melon patch, about defined his attitude. And it is surprising how much a
  man can avoid seeing, if he is determined not to expose another's
  secrets.</p>

  <p>He laughed at himself. He could not resist the impulse to continue in the
  Lama's company, although it was likely enough that sooner or later his
  presence in disguise might endanger the lives of the entire troupe. He was
  perfectly aware that he had received no definite proof of the Lama's honesty,
  pretty nearly sure that his own change of attitude was due to the same
  psychology that had won the applause of the crowd, and finally excused
  himself (with a laugh at his own speciousness) on the ground that he and Dawa
  Tsering and the dog were indispensable.</p>

  <p>But when he had been shown into a small room at the rear of a temple
  enclosure, that seemed to have been deserted by its Hindu owners and, by some
  mysterious means, reserved for the Lama's use, the Lama came to him,
  accompanied as usual by Samding, and after looking at him for a moment seemed
  to read his mind, and promptly blew the argument to pieces.</p>

  <p>"My son, I do not need you, or the dog or Dawa Tsering. All three are
  good, but I am not the molder of your destiny. Is there another way you would
  prefer to take?"</p>

  <p>"I'll go with you," said Ommony, "if you'll accept my word that I'm not
  spying on you."</p>

  <p>The Lama looked amused. His wrinkles moved as if he had tucked away a
  smile in their recesses.</p>

  <p>"My son, to spy is one thing; to absorb enlightenment is something else. A
  man might spy for all eternity and learn nothing but confusion. For what
  purpose did you spy on me in the beginning?"</p>

  <p>Ommony jumped into that opening. Here was frankness at last!</p>

  <p>"I think you know without my telling. I began with the sole intention of
  finding my way into the Ahbor Valley to look for traces of my sister and her
  husband, who vanished in that direction twenty years ago. The piece of jade
  fell into my hands, and you know how that led to my meeting you. Then I heard
  a story about little European girls smuggled into the Ahbor Valley. I have
  seen these girls you have in your company. Explain them. Clear up the
  mystery."</p>

  <p>The Lama seemed to hesitate. "I could talk to you about the stars," he
  said presently. "Yet if you should meditate about them, and observe, you
  would learn more than I could tell you. My son, have you meditated on the
  subject of your sister?"</p>

  <p>"On and off for twenty years," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"And you now pursue the course your meditation has discovered? It appears
  to me that is the proper thing to do."</p>

  <p>"You mean, if I follow you I'll find out?"</p>

  <p>"I am no fortune-teller. Electricity, my son, was in the world from the
  beginning. How many million men observed its effects before one discovered
  it? Gold was in the world from the beginning. How many men pass where it lies
  hidden, until one digs and finds it? Wisdom was in the universe from the
  beginning, but only those whose minds are open to it can deduce the truth
  from what they see."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what became of her?" Ommony asked abruptly. The tone of his
  voice was belligerent, but the Lama ignored that. He answered with a sort of
  masked look on his face as if he himself were still pondering the
  outcome:</p>

  <p>"If I were to tell you all I know, you would inevitably draw a wrong
  conclusion. There are pitfalls on the way to knowledge. Suspicion and pride
  are the worst; but a desire to learn too quickly is a grave impediment."</p>

  <p>During about three breaths he seemed to be considering whether to say more
  or not; but he leaned an arm on Samding's shoulder and walked out of the room
  without speaking again.</p>

  <p class="quote">Sooner or later we must learn all knowledge. It is therefore
  necessary to begin. And for a beginning much may be learned from this: that
  men in pain and men in anger are diverted from either sensation by a song
  &mdash;and very readily.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THEREAFTER life for two months was a dream of many colors,
  through which the Lama led without explaining any of it. At times Ommony
  abandoned hope of ever learning what the Lama's purpose was; at other times
  he dimly discerned it or thought he did, midway between the rocks of politics
  and the shoals of some new creed. And whether he guessed at the truth, or
  believed he never would know it, he reveled in the swiftly moving, nigh
  incredible procession of events.</p>

  <p>No day was like another. No two receptions were alike in any town they
  came to. They put on the play in ramshackle sheds at country fairs with the
  din of sideshows all around them, in pretentious theaters built of corrugated
  iron, in temple courtyards, in more than one palace garden,&mdash;once in an
  empty railway godown* from which a greatly daring Eurasian clerk had removed
  stored merchandise,&mdash;in a crypt under a pagoda (and there was a riot
  that time, because some Brahmins said the place had been rendered unclean by
  the actors, and Ommony came within a hair's breadth of exposure) &mdash;in
  the open, under trees, where roads led to seven villages and a crowd of at
  least three thousand people gathered silent in the bonfire light that shone
  between enormous trees. Once they played in an empty tank, from whose bottom
  an acre of sticky mud, two inches thick, had to be cleaned out before the
  crowd could squat there; once in a cave so stuffy that Maitraya's women
  fainted.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>godown</i> (Malay)&mdash;in India and East Asia, a
  warehouse, especially one at a dockside. <i>American Heritage
  Dictionary</i>.]</p>

  <p>They traveled by elephant, camel, horse, mule, cart, in litters, for fifty
  miles by train, and once, for a day and a night, in barges along an
  irrigation ditch, concealed under hurdles on which vegetables were heaped to
  look like full boat-loads. They went alternately like hunted animals, and
  like a circus trying to attract attention.</p>

  <p>There were places where the Lama seemed to go in fear of the police; other
  places where he ignored them as if non-existent. He always seemed to know in
  advance what to expect, and whether it was wise to move by daylight. Most of
  the traveling was done by night, but there were some places where crowds gave
  them an ovation as they passed through streets at noon.</p>

  <p>Once, when a man who looked like a rajah's son arrived breathless on a
  foaming horse and talked with the Lama under a wayside baobab, the party
  separated into four detachments, and Ommony lay hidden for a whole day under
  the blistering iron roof of an abandoned shed. There was never any
  explanation given. None of the apparently chance-met providers of food and
  transportation asked questions or gave Ommony any information.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the Lama himself did not seem to know the right direction. On
  those occasions he would call a halt by the roadside and wait there until
  some mysterious individual arrived. Sooner or later someone always came. Once
  they waited for a whole day within sight of a fenced village. But they never
  lacked for food, or for the best the country could provide in the way of
  accommodation.</p>

  <p>In one large town of the Central Provinces, in which three thousand people
  packed an assembly hall, there were police officers on chairs near the stage,
  who made notes ostentatiously. The Lama's speech before the curtain on that
  occasion was rather longer than usual and Ommony, watching the policemen,
  recognized the insanity that impels men to interfere with what they cannot
  understand. That night he slipped off the stage before San-fun-ho's last
  speech was finished, hurried into his Bhat-Brahmin clothes, and was standing
  close to the police officers when the crowd began to leave the theater. There
  was one man with whom he had dined in the club at Delhi, another who was
  notorious for drastic enforcement of the "Seditious Practices" Act, and a
  third whom he did not know. They were all three very hot under the collar.
  Said one:</p>

  <p>"A damned nasty seditious play&mdash;obviously propaganda to prevent
  enlistment. They've chosen this place because recruiting's going on here for
  the army. It's anarchistic."</p>

  <p>"Oh, decidedly. Part of Gandhi's non-cooperation tactics."</p>

  <p>"Financed in America, I'll bet you. That's where all the propaganda money
  comes from."</p>

  <p>"Anyhow, we've a clear case. Seditious utterances&mdash;uncensored play
  &mdash;no permit. Step lively and bring the squad, Williams; we'll lock 'em
  all up for the night and find out who they are."</p>

  <p>But an obstinate Bhat-Brahmin stood in Mr. Williams' way and spoke in
  English, curtly:</p>

  <p>"No, you don't! I'm detailed to this investigation by McGregor! I won't
  have police interference! Keep your constables out of sight!"</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" asked the senior officer, pushing himself forward.</p>

  <p>"Never you mind."</p>

  <p>"Show me your credentials."</p>

  <p>"At your risk! Come with me to the telegraph office if you like and watch
  me get you transferred to the salt mines! You'll enjoy a patrol up there
  &mdash;you'll get one newspaper a month!"</p>

  <p>"At least tell me your name."</p>

  <p>"My number is 903," said Ommony. His number on the Secret Service roster
  was not 903; but one does not squander truth too lavishly on men who will
  surely repeat it. He was not anxious that McGregor should have an inkling of
  his whereabouts. The mere mention of a number was enough; the policemen
  walked out, abusive of the Secret Service, conscious that the "Bhat-Brahmin"
  was grinning mischievously at their backs.</p>

  <p>The Lama saw, but said nothing. That night he directed the departure more
  leisurely than usual, as if satisfied that Ommony had made him safe from the
  police; but from that time on he kept himself more than ever aloof, and
  during two whole months of wandering Ommony did not succeed in having two
  hundred words with him.</p>

  <p>However, the Lama and chela reciprocated in due time. They reached a town
  in the Central Provinces where not even certified and pedigreed Bhats would
  have been welcome, and an uncertified one who traveled in doubtful company
  was in danger of his life. A committee of "twice-born" demanded his presence
  for investigation in a temple crypt, and Ommony's retort discourteous, to the
  effect that he recognized no superiors, aroused such anger that the self-
  appointed judges of sanctity resorted to the oldest tactics in the world.</p>

  <p>Those who hate the Brahmins the most are most amenable to skillful
  irritation by them and most careful to insist after the event that Brahmins
  had nothing to do with it; so it is just where the Brahmins are most detested
  that they are most difficult to bring to book; and a mob can gather in India
  more swiftly than a typhoon at sea.</p>

  <p>It was a hot, flat, treeless city, as unlovely as the commercialism, that
  had swept over it these latter years, was cruel. The streets ran more nearly
  at right angles than is the rule in India, and the temples faced the streets
  with an air of having been built by one and the same contractor, he a cheap
  one. The quarters the Lama's party occupied consisted of a hideously ugly
  modern theater that backed on a cellular stack of ill-built living-rooms, the
  whole surrounded by four streets, three of which were as narrow as village
  lanes.</p>

  <p>That night the packed audience was restless, and whenever the saddhu spoke
  his lines there were noisy interruptions, cat-calls, jeers. Someone threw a
  rotten orange that missed Ommony but put Diana in a frenzy, and for minutes
  at a time it looked as if the curtain would have to be rung down before the
  close; but the Lama's quiet voice from behind the well and from under the
  throne kept up a steady flow of reassurance inaudible beyond the footlights:
  "Patience! Forbearance! There is strength in calmness. Proceed! Proceed! You
  are a king, Maitraya; you are not affected by ungentleness! Proceed!"</p>

  <p>But even San-fun-ho's long speech was received with irritation; someone in
  authority had told the crowd it was a trick to destroy their sacred religion.
  The chela's voice rang through the theater and overcame the murmurings, but
  the hymn to Manjusri that followed was drowned in a babbling tumult as half
  of the audience poured in panic out of one door while a mob stormed another,
  breaking it down and surging in with a roar that shook the theater.</p>

  <p>The stage-hands stripped the actors faster than usual and herded them out
  through the back door to the living rooms. They tried to make Ommony go too,
  but he fought them off when they seized him by the arms; he had hard work to
  keep Diana from using her teeth to protect him while he hurried into his
  Bhat-Brahmin clothes, wondering what solution the Lama would discover for
  this predicament. "I'll bet the old sportsman won't surrender me to the mob!"
  he muttered. "If I live through this, I'll know exactly what to think of him!
  If he's a&mdash;" But there was no word for what he might be. The crowd was
  yelling, "The Bhat! The Bhat! The spy! The imposter. Bring out the unclean
  ape who poses as a twice-born!" Two scared-looking "constabeels" who had
  appeared from somewhere, standing at either corner of the stage with their
  backs to the curtain, were valiantly preventing the mob from swarming behind
  the scenes. The Lama seemed to have disappeared, and Ommony felt a sudden,
  sickening sensation that the old man and his chela were only fair-weather
  intriguers after all.</p>

  <p>But suddenly the mob grew quiet&mdash;seemed to hold its breath. The
  Lama's voice, not very loud, but unmistakable and pitched like a
  mountaineer's to carry against wind and through all other sounds, was holding
  their attention from behind the footlights.</p>

  <p>Then Samding passed across the stage and slipped in front of the curtain;
  he had changed into that ivory-white costume in which he had received Prabhu
  Singh, and was smiling as if the prospect of a battle royal pleased him.
  Ommony went to the edge of the curtain to watch, holding Diana's collar,
  ready to loose her in defense of the Lama in case of need.</p>

  <p>"Bring out the Bhat!" yelled someone. There was a chorus of supporting
  shouts, but that was the last of the noise. The mob grew still again, spell-
  bound by curiosity.</p>

  <p>Samding took the center of the stage and the Lama squatted down beside
  him, eyes half-closed, apparently in meditation. The chela spoke, and his
  voice held a note of appeal that aimed straight at the heart of
  simplicity.</p>

  <p>"O people, if ye have been wronged, it is we ourselves who first should
  put the matter right. Ye, being pious, unoffending people, will afford us
  that privilege. We ask no trial. That is unnecessary. Which among you are the
  individuals who have suffered at our hands? Unwittingly, it may be we have
  done you harm. You will agree it is the injured one to whom redress is due.
  Let the injured stand forth. Let him, who of his own body or possessions has
  suffered harm at our hands, step forth and name his own terms of
  settlement."</p>

  <p>He dared to pause for thirty seconds, while the mob glared, each expecting
  someone else to hurl an accusation. But the original instigators of violence
  are careful to keep out of reach when the trouble begins, and there was no
  spokesman ready with a definite accusation&mdash;nothing but a disgusting
  smell of sweat, a sea of eyes, and a hissing of indrawn breath. The Lama
  whispered, not moving his head, and the chela continued:</p>

  <p>"It is possible the injured are not here. Let someone bring the men for
  whose injury we are in any way responsible!"</p>

  <p>There was another pause, during which the Lama got up and walked
  meditatively toward the edge of the curtain, where he came face to face with
  Ommony.</p>

  <p>"My son, can you act the Bhat as well as you can the saddhu?" he inquired.
  "Otherwise escape while there is opportunity! Be wise. There is no wisdom in
  attempting what you cannot do."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can act the Bhat," said Ommony. His jaws were set. He had been a
  last-ditch fighter all his life. Of all things in the world, he most loved
  standing by his friends with all resources and every faculty in an
  extremity.</p>

  <p>The Lama returned to the chela's side, whispered and squatted down. The
  chela went on speaking:</p>

  <p>"It may be ye have been misguided. There are always unwise men who seek to
  stir up indignation for their own obscure advantage. Are there any Brahmins
  in your midst?"</p>

  <p>There was only one possible answer to that question. No "twice-born" would
  risk personal defilement by mingling with such a mob of "untouchables." A
  laugh with a suggestion of a sneer in it rippled across the sea of upturned
  faces.</p>

  <p>"It would seem then that the Brahmins have sent you to pass judgment on a
  Bhat who is one of their own fraternity," said the chela calmly. "It appears
  they trust you to conduct the investigation for them. That is a very high
  compliment from Brahmins, isn't it? If they are willing to accept your
  judgment on such an important point, who are we that we should not abide by
  it? The Bhat shall give you his own account of himself. Henceforth ye may say
  to the Brahmins that they are no longer the sole judges of their own
  cause."</p>

  <p>There was a laugh&mdash;a laugh of sheer delight that grew into a good-
  tempered roar. There was doubtless not a member of the mob who had not
  suffered scores of times from the blight of Brahmin insolence. The Brahmin's
  claim to be a caste apart and an unindictable offense forever soothes his own
  self-righteousness but does not exactly make him popular.</p>

  <p>"I pray you to be seated," said the chela; and after a few moments'
  hesitation the mob sat down on the floor, first in dozens, then in
  droves.</p>

  <p>There was no more danger, provided Ommony could play his own part; but if
  he should make one mistake the situation would be worse than ever. He
  beckoned one of the musicians, who was guarding the door at the rear of the
  stage, signed to him to bring his instrument, stepped out in front of the
  curtain and sat down beside the Lama. Hostile silence broke into a sea of
  grins and chuckles when Diana, still in her grease-paint, followed and
  squatted on his left hand between him and the musician. The musician was
  deathly scared, but unfroze and tuned his instrument when the Lama looked at
  him. Ommony surveyed the crowd with the best imitation of insolence his
  strained nerves could muster, taking his time, absorbing the feel of the
  Lama's calmness. He needed it; he sensed that the old man's courage was a
  dozen times as great as his.</p>

  <p>"And now, my son," the Lama whispered, "we are face to face with
  opportunity."</p>

  <p>That was a brave man's view of danger! Ommony laughed, cleared his throat
  and thrust his lips out impudently:</p>

  <p>"People who don't know enough to ask a blessing, may expect to get&mdash;
  what?" he demanded tartly.</p>

  <p>"Pranam," said two or three voices, and the murmur caught on. It was not
  unanimous, but it sufficed to put him in countenance. He blessed them with an
  air of doing it because he had to, not for any other reason.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said in the nasal, impromptu, doggerel singsong of the minstrel,
  "I could sing for you a ballad of your own abominable shortcomings, and it
  would serve you right; but it would not make your souls white, and it would
  take all night. It would give me much delight, but it would put you all to
  flight, and I'm compassionate. Or I could sing you a few measures about the
  Brahmins of this place, who are a lousy lot, but if I sang of their disgrace,
  not a one would show his face again among you. You need the Brahmins to keep
  you from thinking too much of yourselves! They're bad, but you're worse;
  you're the sinners and they're the curse. Take that thought home and think
  about it!&mdash;Is there anybody here," he asked with his head to one side,
  "who would like me to sing about him personally? No? You're not anxious?
  Don't be backward. Don't think it's too difficult. Stand up and tell me your
  name, and I'll tell you all about you and your father and your uncles and
  your son, and what mischief you were up to this day fortnight. Nobody
  curious? Oh, very well. Then I'll sing you the Lay of Alha."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Lay of Alha</i>&mdash;an epic poem of Rajput
  chivalry sung by minstrels in northern India. www.alibris.com.]</p>

  <p>India will listen to that song hours without end. It is a saga of Rajput
  chivalry, and men who know no chivalry nor ever were in Rajputana love to
  hear it better than the chink of money or the bray of the all-conquering
  gramophone. Since the white man first imposed himself on India there have not
  been half a dozen who have learned that lay by heart from end to end, not
  three who could have sung it, none but Ommony who could have skipped long,
  tedious parts so artfully and have introduced in place of them extempore
  allusions to modern politics and local news. He outdid any Bhat they had ever
  heard, because he did not dare to count, as Bhats do, on the song's
  traditional popularity and so to slur through it anyhow. He had to win the
  audience. But what obsessed him most was a desire to win the Lama's praise;
  the harder he tried, the more he admired the Lama, sitting as calm as a
  Buddha beside him.</p>

  <p>Regarded as music his effort was not marvelous. As a feat of wit and
  memory it was next thing to a miracle. His voice, not more than fair-to-
  middling good and partly trained, survived to the end because he pitched it
  through his nose, relieving the strain on his throat, and his manner grew
  more and more confident as he realized that memory was not playing tricks and
  he could recall every line of the long epic. He sang them into a merry frame
  of mind; he sang them thrilled, compassionate, intrigued, excited,
  sentimental, bellicose and proud in turn. He had them humming the refrain
  with him. He had them swaying in time to the tune as they sat, their
  laughing, up-turned faces glistening with sweat. He had them throwing money
  to him before the lay was half sung; and it was then that the Lama
  whispered:</p>

  <p>"Enough, my son. Forget not to put skill in the conclusion."</p>

  <p>Ommony stopped singing, and gagged at the crowd, with his tongue between
  his teeth, pretending that his voice had given out.</p>

  <p>"Did any Brahmin in this city ever do as much for you?" he croaked, and
  they roared applause.</p>

  <p>"I am a Bhat, and I can bless or I can curse more efficaciously than any
  thousand Brahmins in the province! Watch!"</p>

  <p>He turned to Diana and made her sit up on her haunches.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of the Brahmins of this city?" he demanded, and Diana
  growled like an earthquake.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of these people in front of you?" She barked and got
  down on all four feet to wag her tail at them.</p>

  <p>"There! There you are! Even a dog knows you are well-meaning folk who have
  been fooled by rascally Brahmins, who mouth mantras and do unclean things
  when none is looking! Get out of here, all of you, before I curse you! Go
  while I am in a good temper&mdash;before I put a blight on you! Hurry!"</p>

  <p>They yelled for more song, but it was after midnight and the Lama had
  other plans. He hustled Ommony off the stage, himself remaining at the corner
  of the curtain for a minute to make sure of the crowd's mood. Ommony heard
  the chink of money as he rewarded the two "constabeels." Then, as placid as
  Ommony had ever seen him, but a little stooped and tired, he led the way to
  the stage door, saying over his shoulder to Samding:</p>

  <p>"Did you study that lesson? Have you learned it?" Ommony did not catch the
  chela's answer. He felt the floor jerk underfoot and stepped off a trap-
  door. It moved, and a hand came through, then the outline of a face that
  appeared to be listening. He bent down to lift the heavy trap and Dawa
  Tsering climbed out on hands and knees, sweating profusely and rubbing dust
  out of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yow, there are rats in that place, Gupta Rao&mdash;big ones, and it is
  dark! Go down and look if you don't believe me."</p>

  <p>"What were you doing down there ?" Ommony inquired.</p>

  <p>"I? Down there? Oh, I was looking to see if there was a passage by which
  that mob could reach you from the rear. Yes, I was! Don't laugh at me, or I
  will call you by your right name! Why didn't you turn me loose with my knife
  to drive the mob forth, instead of singing to them like a nurse to a lot of
  children? I could have cleaned the place of that rabble in two minutes. You
  should have left it to me!"</p>

  <p>"Did you kill any rats? asked Samding, grinning mischievously. He was
  holding the door open, waiting for them.</p>

  <p>"Thou! I will kill thee, at any rate!"</p>

  <p>The Hillman rushed at the chela, but Ommony tripped him. Samding slipped
  through the door and let it slam.</p>

  <p>"There, did you see that?" Dawa Tsering grumbled, picking himself up.
  "That chela uses the black arts! He threw me to the floor with one wink of
  his eye. Did you see? He is no good! He is a bad one! Now I am never tempted
  to slay the Lama, which is why I endure his objectionable righteousness; but
  that chela&mdash;I never see him but I want to squeeze his throat with my two
  thumbs, thus, until his eyes pop out!"</p>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22">CHAPTER XXII.</a><br>
  Darjeeling</h2>

  <p class="quote">The secret of the charm of the lotus is that none can say
  wherein its beauty lies; for some say this, and some say that, but all agree
  that it is beautiful. And so indeed it is with woman. Her influence is
  mystery; her power is concealment. For that which men have uncovered and
  explained, whether rightly or wrongly, they despise. But that which they
  discern, although its underlying essence is concealed from them, they wonder
  at and worship.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THE STANDING MIRACLE was the Lama's skill in having his own
  way and in keeping his own secrets without any discoverable method. His way
  seemed more alertly excellent, his secrets more obscure, from day to day. For
  instance those mysterious young women. Not for one minute during two months
  and eleven days did Ommony or Dawa Tsering find an opportunity to speak with
  them alone, not though Diana grew dangerously fat on sticky sweetmeats that
  they gave her, she construing orders to go and make friends with them into
  permission to accept food.</p>

  <p>The only key that seemed to fit the mystery was that the girls had been
  too well trained to be tricked into indiscretion. Tyranny could never have
  accomplished it. Once, Ommony picked up an amethyst earring, dropped in a
  corridor: he wrapped it in paper on which he scribbled a humorous verse,
  tucked it into Diana's collar, and sent her nosing around in the girls'
  quarters. The dog returned after an hour or so with a caricature of himself
  drawn on the paper in charcoal, extremely clever but not flattering. On
  another occasion he sent Diana with a note asking for the words of the song
  that the girls chanted on the stage; he saw the Lama read that note on the
  stage the same night and, after a quiet glance at him, deliberately tear it
  up. The following morning he received the words of the song in the Lama's
  heavy handwriting. He was acutely aware that the girls discussed him with a
  great deal of amusement, but he could never get them to exchange glances or
  make any response to his overtures.</p>

  <p>Dawa Tsering made a dozen attempts to invade the women's quarters. Several
  times he was caught by the Tibetans and disposed of cavalierly, usually
  simply chucked into the nearest heap of garbage. Three times he managed to
  get into a room in which the girls were, but he would never tell afterward
  what had happened to him; once he emerged so angry that Ommony really
  believed for an hour or two that he might murder someone, and took his knife
  away, but returned it at the Lama's instigation.</p>

  <p>"It is not always wise to prohibit," said the Lama. "His imagination needs
  an outlet. Give him his toy."</p>

  <p>It was a baffling conundrum why the Lama should go to such pains to
  present his play in more than sixty towns and villages, and always escape
  immediately afterward. It was not always the police; he treated the
  occasional difficulties they presented pretty much as a circus director
  regards bad weather. He appeared to be much more afraid of the results of his
  own success, and to run away from that as from a conflagration. Offers of
  money, prayers, nothing could persuade him to repeat a performance anywhere.
  The greater a crowd's importunity, the swifter his flight.</p>

  <p>By the time they reached Darjeeling Ommony was convinced of two things:
  that the "Middle Way" is undiscoverable to outsiders, being opened, closed
  and changed in detail by unknown individuals, obeyed implicitly, who do their
  own selecting; and that the Lama was himself in receipt of orders from a
  secret hierarchy.</p>

  <p>The latter was almost certainly true. A Ringding Gelong Lama does not rank
  as high in the Lamaistic scale as a cardinal does in the Roman Catholic
  Church. Even supposing Tsiang Samdup, as was rumored, was an outlaw who had
  been turned out of Tibet for schism, that would make it even more unlikely
  that he could command an extensive spy system and mysterious service along
  the "Middle Way" without some long established hierarchy to support him.</p>

  <p>And if he were an outlawed heretic, why was it that in Darjeeling he went
  straight to a Tibetan monastery, that opened its doors to the whole party?
  They arrived at dawn, having ridden all night on mule-back up a winding path
  that crossed and recrossed the circling railway track, ascending through
  clouds that wrapped them in wet silence, until dawn shone suddenly through
  pine trees and the monastery roof glistened a thousand yards ahead of
  them.</p>

  <p>The roar of radongs came down the chilly wind, announcing they were seen.
  A procession of brown-robed monks filed out to meet them, each monk spinning
  a prayer-wheel and grinning as he mumbled the everlasting "Om Mani Padme Hum"
  that by repetition bars the door of the various worlds of delusion and
  permits pure meditation. It seemed to give no offense that Tsiang Samdup and
  his chela had no prayer-wheels. Maitraya and his actors were as welcome as
  the rest. Ommony was greeted with child-like grins from oily, slant-eyed
  Mongolian faces that betrayed no suggestion of suspicion. The dog was
  chuckled at. Maitraya's actresses were greeted no more and no less cordially
  than the rest.</p>

  <p>But the chela's reception was peculiar. The Abbot blessed him solemnly,
  then stared at him for a long time. From the others there was an air of
  deference; a peculiar form of treating him as a mere chela, with an attitude
  of deep respect underlying it and not nearly concealed. They exchanged
  glances and nodded, formed a group around him, regarding him with curiosity,
  and with something akin to awe. The chela appeared more disposed to be
  friendly than distant, but kept a deliberate course midway between the two
  extremes, watched all the while intently by the Lama, who finally leaned on
  his shoulder and almost hustled him in through the gate.</p>

  <p>Once within the monastery wall Ommony was led away to a cell high up under
  a gabled roof, where a smiling old monk brought breakfast, laughing and
  snapping his fingers at Diana, not in the least afraid of her, but dumb when
  asked questions. He knew Ommony was no Brahmin&mdash;laughed at the caste-
  mark&mdash;touched his own forehead comically&mdash;and went out spinning a
  prayer-wheel that he kept tucked into his girdle whenever both hands were
  occupied; he seemed anxious to make up for lost time.</p>

  <p>The unglazed window provided a far view of Kanchenjunga, twenty-eight
  thousand feet above sea level&mdash;twenty-one thousand feet higher than the
  monastery roof&mdash;a lonely, lordly monarch of the silences upreared above
  untrodden peaks that circled the whole horizon to the north. Six thousand
  feet below, the Rungeet River boiled through an unseen valley. For a moment
  all the boundaries of Sikkim glittered in every imaginable hue of green, and
  between and beyond colossal snow-clad ranges the eye could scan the barren
  frontiers of Tibet. Then, as swiftly as eyes could sweep the vast horizon,
  mist of a million hues of pearly gray, phantom-formed, changing its shapes as
  if the gods were visioning new universes in the cloud, rolled and descended,
  stunning imagination with the hugeness that could wrap that scene and hide it
  as if it never had been.</p>

  <p>Then rain&mdash;cold dinning rain that drummed on roof and rock, and
  splashed in cataracts to mingle with the spate of the Rungeet River crowding
  through a mountain gap toward the rice-green, steamy lushness of Bengal; rain
  that swallowed all the universe in sound, that beat the wind into subjection
  and descended straight, as if the Lords of Deluge would whelm the world at
  last forever. Rain, and a smell of washed earth. Rain pulsing with the rhythm
  of a monastery bell, like the cry of a bronze age, drowning.</p>

  <p>That bell seemed to clamor an emergency and Ommony hurried along cold
  stone corridors until he found his way into a gallery from which he could
  peer down into a dim hall through swimming layers of incense smoke. Silken
  banners, ancient but unfaded, hung all about him; images of the Gautama
  Buddha and disciples were carved on shadowy walls; the gloom was rich with
  color-alive with quiet breathing. He could see the heads of monks in rows,
  but could distinguish no one for a while because the heads were bowed and
  most of the light was lost in baffling shadows.</p>

  <p>At one end was an altar, gilded and most marvelously carved, backed by an
  image of Chenresi.* All the altar furniture was golden, and the monastery's
  pride&mdash;the book named <i>Zab-choes-zhi-khro-gongs-pa-rang-groel-las-
  bar-dohi-thoes-grol-chen-mo</i>&dagger;&mdash;lay in the midst on a golden
  plate before Chenresi's image.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Chenresi, Chenresig, Chenrezik</i> (Hindi)&mdash;

  free and decidedly doubtful rendering of the manuscript's shorter title:

  <p>Dim music began and a chant, long grown familiar&mdash;that hymn to
  Manjusri that had thrilled so many audiences&mdash;and at last through the
  layering incense Ommony could make out the forms of the Lama and Samding. The
  chela was holding the fragment of jade in both hands and was walking solemnly
  toward the altar, where the Abbot and the Lama waited to receive him.</p>

  <p>The drumming of the rain on roof-tiles ceased. One shaft of sunlight,
  beaming through a narrow window, shone on the jade as the chela laid it on
  the altar, making it glow with green internal fire. The radongs roared. The
  hymn changed to a chant of triumph, swelling in grand chords that shook the
  roof-beams. But Ommony hardly heard it. Something else, as the chela, almost
  exactly underneath him, moved into the beam of sunlight, held his whole
  attention.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be blowed!" he muttered. He rubbed his eyes, made sure they
  were not lying to him by glancing at the image of Chenresi and at the rows of
  monks' heads, then stared again. "May I be damned, if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He looked at Diana, crouching in the gallery beside him, her head full of
  information that lacked only power of speech.</p>

  <p>"I suppose if you could talk, Di, you'd lose your other gifts," he
  muttered. Then he whistled softly to himself. Not for a fortune and a hundred
  years of life would he let up now! Let the Ahbor country be as savage as the
  fringe of Dante's hell, as inaccessible as Heaven, and as far away as
  righteousness, he would go there, if he must die for it!</p>

  <p>"Di, old lady, this is the grandest scent you ever laid nose on! Mum's the
  word. I'll take a feather out of your cap!"</p>

  <p>The service no longer interested him. He did not wait to see what they did
  with the piece of jade&mdash;no longer cared a rap about it. He was almost
  drunk with new excitement and a mystery compared to which the jade was mere
  mechanics&mdash;a mystery half-unraveled that set his brain galloping in wild
  conjecture, so wild that he kicked himself and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I'm mad. They say India gets us all sooner or later." But he knew
  he was not mad. He knew he had strength enough and sense enough to hold his
  tongue and to keep on the trail with every sharpened faculty he had. He was
  itching now to get to Tilgaun, partly because that was midway to the Ahbor
  country, but for another reason that made him laugh because he knew he held a
  secret key that would unlock more secrets.</p>

  <p>He returned along draughty corridors to the cell that was full of white
  mist pouring through the unglazed window, and sat down to consider whether he
  should keep up the Bhat-Brahmin role or let his beard grow and resume the
  garb of an unimaginative Englishman.</p>

  <p>He had not made up his mind when a rap came on the door and the Lama blew
  in on a gust of rising wind, his long robe fluttering clear of the strong
  brown legs. The chela followed him and slammed the door, unrolled a
  prayer-mat and presently sat down on it beside the Lama. Ommony fought hard
  to suppress the triumph in his eyes as he stood, and then sat down on the
  truckle bed in obedience to the Lama's gesture.</p>

  <p>"It is cold," said the Lama. "You must have a sheepskin coat, my son. We
  mountaineers are too prone to forget that others suffer from what we consider
  comfort. Samding, see that Gupta Rao is provided."</p>

  <p>He did not glance at the chela. His eyes were on Ommony's.</p>

  <p>"And what have you learned, my son?" he asked presently.</p>

  <p>"Very little," said Ommony. "I have learned that all my power of
  observation isn't much more than a beetle's."</p>

  <p>"But that is a great deal to have learned," the Lama answered. Then,
  without a pause: "And you are not yet satisfied?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary. I hold you to your promise to let me pursue whatever
  course my meditation opens up."</p>

  <p>"My son, I am not the appointed keeper of such permits!"</p>

  <p>"You can make things difficult or make them easy for me. Which are you
  going to do?" asked Ommony; and it seemed to him that the chela was smiling
  behind that marvelously molded face.</p>

  <p>"What is it you wish to learn most?" asked the Lama; and Ommony, after one
  hard look at the chela, closed his eyes to think. It would be useless to tell
  anything but raw truth; he had a feeling that the Lama could detect the
  slightest taint of falsehood; yet he was determined not to confess to what he
  now knew, because in all likelihood that would shut all doors against him. "A
  little knowledge" is usually doubly dangerous, if the other fellow knows you
  know it.</p>

  <p>"I wish to demonstrate that I was really right to decide to trust you," he
  said at last.</p>

  <p>"But you know that," said the Lama. "Your heart tells you you were right.
  A man's heart does not lie to him; it is the brain that lies, imagining all
  kinds of vanities."</p>

  <p>Ommony took thought again. He sensed that he was on trial, not for his
  life but for something more important leave to go ahead and find out for
  himself the whole solution of the mystery. He had to find an answer that
  should not be false, that should not betray the knowledge he already had, and
  that should nevertheless appeal to the Lama's sense of fitness.
  Superficiality would receive a superficial answer. Deep was asking deep for a
  disclosure of ultimate motive.</p>

  <p>"My job in the forest is gone. I want to find work worth doing," he said
  at last.</p>

  <p>"And do you think I can show you that?" asked the Lama, looking straight
  at him. One moment he looked very old, the next not more than middle-aged. It
  was as if he hovered between this world and another, in which were visions
  that he could bring back with him to earth. Ommony threw evasion to the
  winds.</p>

  <p>"I want to learn your secret!"</p>

  <p>"Ah! But to obey? Not me, but to obey your own heart, if I help you to see
  what none of your race has ever yet seen?"</p>

  <p>"I'll do what I believe is right," said Ommony, and the Lama nodded,
  glancing sharply at Samding, as if to see whether the chela confirmed his
  opinion. The chela smiled inscrutably.</p>

  <p>"You should go to Tilgaun," said the Lama, "where you might have gone in
  the beginning. If you wish, you may follow me to Tilgaun, and await what
  comes of it."</p>

  <p>He had a way of ending a discussion as abruptly as he had begun it, his
  mind almost visibly closing, vaguely suggestive of the way a tortoise draws
  in its head. One realized it would not be the slightest use to speak another
  word to him on the subject. The chela got up and helped him to his feet,
  rolled up the mat and followed him out of the room almost mechanically, but
  turned in the doorway suddenly and looked back. It was dark there, for the
  door was set in a stone arch six feet deep and there was no window at the end
  of the draughty corridor. But Ommony could almost have sworn the chela
  laughed silently. There was a momentary glimpse of white teeth and a movement
  of the head that certainly suggested it.</p>

  <p>"It beats the deuce!" he reflected. "That chela knows now that I know
  she's a girl, although I can't imagine how she knows it; and that means that
  the Lama knows I know it&mdash;for they haven't a secret apart. And the
  strangest part is that they don't seem to give a damn&mdash;either of
  'em!"</p>

  <p class="quote">If a vain man should value your virtue, beware! For he will
  steal it in the name of God, and he will sell your reputation in the market-
  place.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THERE was no more rain that day, but mist that wrapped
  Darjeeling in a dripping shroud. Beads like perspiration gathered and
  trickled down interior walls, and there were no fires; the monks led the
  austere life that includes indifference to such minor afflictions as ague,
  and through indifference they seemed to have become immune. But Ommony
  suffered.</p>

  <p>A monk brought him a long sheepskin coat, and in that he paraded the
  corridors to keep his blood circulating. He begged more sheepskins and set
  Dawa Tsering to work making a coat for Diana, because animals used to the
  plains die of pneumonia in those altitudes more readily than human beings. He
  tried to decide whether or not to go into Darjeeling and buy European
  clothes, while he leaned over a parapet to watch strong-legged Sikkim women
  looming out of the mist loaded like camels with huge piles of cord-wood for
  the monastery kitchen, until that bored him.</p>

  <p>He was feverish with impatience. At noon he made up his mind to go and ask
  the Lama's advice about disguise, supposing he could find him. But as he left
  the cell to hunt for the Lama a monk came with the midday meal and stood by
  to watch him eat&mdash;a cheery old monk, who laughed when questioned and
  talked about everything under the sun except what Ommony wanted to know,
  spinning his prayer-wheel furiously as if to immunize himself against
  heretical contagion.</p>

  <p>And when the monk had shuffled away with the empty platters and Ommony set
  forth again to hunt for the Lama, Maitraya met him midway along the first
  draughty corridor&mdash;Maitraya smothered in a sheepskin coat like Ommony's
  and blowing great clouds of breath in front of him.</p>

  <p>"I am paid, O Gupta Rao! I have a draft on Benjamin and money for the
  railway fares to Delhi&mdash;enough for first-class fares for all of us and
  liberal provision for the way. Would that there were more men like Tsiang
  Samdup! May the generous gods bless him! No argument, Gupta Rao; no
  deductions; no delay; a bag of money, an order on Benjamin, and such
  courteously worded thanks as Vishnu never received from a mother just
  delivered of a son! I feel as if my whole body had been drenched in thanks
  from inside outward! Are you on your way to your cell?"</p>

  <p>"I am on my way to find the Lama. Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Gone! Didn't you know that? He left an hour ago, he and all the women and
  Samding, on little Tibetan ponies. There was no ceremony. They rode away like
  ghosts into the mist."</p>

  <p>Maitraya took Ommony's arm in rank defiance of caste decorum.</p>

  <p>"Come along, Gupta Rao. I know you are no Brahmin. You are possibly a
  Kshatriya like me, but what the devil has caste to do with our profession!
  Whatever you are, you have the approval of me, Maitraya! You are a great
  actor. You are a man after mine own heart&mdash;a little conceited possibly
  &mdash;a trifle grumpy on occasion&mdash;but we all have faults. I know a
  first-rate actor, when I see him! I forgive the little insignificances. I
  respect the strength of character&mdash;the genius! Come, let us go along to
  your cell; I have a proposal for you."</p>

  <p>Ommony led him to the cell and sat down on the truckle bed. Maitraya would
  not sit; he threw an attitude and paced the floor, striving to create an
  atmosphere of tremendous drama, that somehow refused to materialize between
  those dripping walls. He shuddered at the cold when he should have gestured
  like a Mogul chieftain, and coughed, which rather spoiled the grandeur of his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Gupta Rao&mdash;let us accept our destiny! If two men, mutually worthy of
  respect, were ever brought together for immortal purposes, those two are we!
  Consider! Have we not a task in common? Have we not a great ideal to espouse
  together? Is it not our duty to inspire the stage of Hind?* Have we not a
  ripe field waiting for us? Should we not revisit all the scenes of our
  success and stage such plays as shall uplift the drama of this land of Hind
  forever? Think of those audiences, Gupta Rao! Think of the profits! Charge no
  more than one-half rupee admission, and we make our fortunes!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Hind</i>&mdash;India.]</p>

  <p>Ommony cast about for an excuse for refusing, that should not turn a
  friend into an enemy.</p>

  <p>"Who do you propose should write the plays?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We have a play! Ye Rulers of the Upper Spheres&mdash;a play, I tell you!
  I have memorized the whole of it! Let the Jew finance us, Gupta Rao! Let us
  go to Benjamin and use our joint persuasion to wheedle a decent contract out
  of him. I offer you a one-third interest! Commercialism-pah! The Jew is a
  commercialist, so we must feed him with rupees. The Lama, on the other hand,
  is ignorant of money's value; he fails to see that it is good for the
  audience to pay a fair price for its education. As for us, let us take the
  middle way between two crass extremes. And if in the process we make a
  fortune, that will be no more than what is due to us. Have you heard that
  Christian adage, that the laborer is worthy of his hire?"</p>

  <p>"I seem to have heard another one about stealing," said Ommony dryly. "The
  play is the Lama's."</p>

  <p>"Bah! It isn't copyright. He should have taken elementary precautions.
  Besides, he has no right to keep for his own use an idea that has universal
  application. The play is religious; who can copyright religion?"</p>

  <p>"Did you think of obtaining the Lama's permission?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"No, I confess, I never thought of that. But it's too late now; he's gone.
  Let us go to Benjamin. The Jew will see the point of not letting a good
  profitable play lie idle for the sake of a bit of squeamishness. Come along.
  Let Benjamin convince you."</p>

  <p>Ommony jumped at that solution. He knew Benjamin.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said. "You make the proposal to him. If Benjamin agrees, I
  will then consider it. And don't forget, you'll need a genius to act the part
  of San-fun-ho!"</p>

  <p>"Aha !" exclaimed Maitraya. "Genius? I can act that part much better than
  the chela did! Not that he was bad, mind you&mdash;not that he was bad. I
  will play San-fun-ho, and you the king. Together we will create dramatic
  history!"</p>

  <p>"First create confidence in Benjamin! I'll answer yes or no when you have
  persuaded him," said Ommony. He got rid of Maitraya with difficulty. No
  argument availed until it dawned on Maitraya that he could pocket the cost of
  transportation by leaving Ommony behind; then he permitted himself to be led
  along the corridor and lost in the maze of passages and stairways.</p>

  <p>Ommony went in search of the Abbot, and found a monk at last who did not
  shake his head and grin when spoken to, but led up an outside stairway to a
  grimly austere cell just under the roof, where the Abbot sat cross-legged on
  a stone platform at one end, meditating. He opened his eyes and gazed at
  Ommony for several minutes before a smile at last spread over his Mongolian
  face and he passed one lean hand down the length of his scrawny gray beard.
  He appeared to be well pleased with the result of his inspection.</p>

  <p>"The spirit of restlessness is difficult to overcome," he said at last.
  "It is sometimes wise to yield to it. There are many lives. Not all knowledge
  can be acquired at once. In what way can I help, my son?"</p>

  <p>Ommony thought of asking a dozen questions, but discerned that the gentle
  courtesy concealed an iron aptitude for silence. He came straight to the
  point.</p>

  <p>"I beg forgiveness for intrusion. I return thanks for food and lodging.
  Did the holy Lama Tsiang Samdup make a statement of his wishes with regard to
  me?"</p>

  <p>The Abbot's face became wreathed in smiles again. He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Where do you wish to go, my son? To Tilgaun? When?"</p>

  <p>"Now!"</p>

  <p>The Abbot struck a gong that hung on the wall beside him; before its
  overtones had died a young monk appeared in the doorway and received swiftly
  spoken singsong orders in a language Ommony did not understand. The monk gave
  guttural assent, and waited in the door for Ommony to go with him, but there
  was two or three minutes' delay while the Abbot amused himself by playing
  with Diana almost childishly, laughing at her new sheepskin coat and using
  his staff to measure her height at the shoulder and her length from the tip
  of her nose to the end of her tail. Ommony made Diana sit up and salute him,
  whereat he blessed the dog solemnly. Finally he gave seven turns to a
  prayer-wheel fixed in an iron bracket within comfortable reach, nodded to the
  monk, and smiled farewell at Ommony, dismissing him with a blessing that
  sounded like the first bars of an anthem to eternal peace.</p>

  <p>Followed laughter, bustling, friendliness, and no delay. They speeded the
  departing guest: A dozen monks made themselves agreeable; two of them carried
  out Ommony's trunk into the courtyard; some led out little sturdy Tibetan
  ponies and held them while others lashed the loads in place with the
  unhurried speed of old campaigners. There was ample supply of provisions,
  including grain for the ponies, and when Ommony suggested paying for it all
  they laughed. They seemed amused at the idea that any guest of theirs should
  pay for anything.</p>

  <p>However, he noticed that two sturdy-looking Tibetans who were certainly
  not monks, had been told off to accompany him; they were listening to
  instructions from the young monk who had received the Abbot's
  incomprehensible orders; standing at a little distance apart, they kept
  nodding as the instructions were repeated again and again.</p>

  <p>There were in all eight ponies and the party was on the way, filing
  through the wide gate with one Tibetan leading and the other Tibetan bringing
  up the rear, within thirty minutes. Dawa Tsering burst into song as he rode
  under the arch behind Ommony and they were all swallowed in a drifting bank
  of cloud that even hid the monastery wall as they turned sharp to the right
  and followed the track that ran beside it. The sturdy little ponies put their
  best foot forward as they always do when they are headed northward.</p>

  <p>The ninety miles to Tilgaun meant four days of strenuous going, for the
  miles are reckoned as the crow flies, whereas men and their mounts must climb
  and descend over the shoulders of hills heaped on one another by the gods to
  keep away intruders. The trail wound down through phantom deodars* and dipped
  into a fleecy white fog that condensed in dew on everything warm that it
  touched, descending seven thousand feet into the Rungeet Valley before they
  crossed a long bridge and commenced to climb again.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>deodar</i>&mdash; a tall cedar (Cedrus deodara)
  native to the Himalaya Mountains and having drooping branches and dark
  bluish-green leaves, often with white, light green, or yellow new growth in
  cultivars. It is an important timber tree in India. <i>American Heritage
  Dictionary</i>.]</p>

  <p>Most of the time it was like sitting on an earthquake; there was nothing
  to do but cling tightly and watch the pony's ears in the mist as the nimble
  legs slid, struggled and recovered. There was no chance for anything but
  single file among the rocks and rhododendrons; even Diana had to trot behind
  the pony to escape being trodden on. It was not the surfaced highroad they
  were taking, but presumably a short-cut, which the Tibetan guide appeared to
  know as intimately as a mole knows tunnels.</p>

  <p>They climbed nine thousand feet and slept in a windy hut above the clouds,
  where the Tibetans cooked greasy supper and sang plaintive songs in which
  Dawa Tsering joined. There was no sign of the Lama's party, nor any answer to
  Ommony's questions as to how far ahead the Lama might be; nor was there any
  indication that the Lama's party had crossed that pass ahead of them. But at
  dawn, when Ommony wanted to make an early start the Tibetans had scores of
  excuses that ended with blunt refusal. They were not impudent or surly; they
  smiled as cheerfully as Chinese statues and simply did not load the
  ponies.</p>

  <p>"If I slew them, as they deserve, there would be none to do the work,"
  said Dawa Tsering. "Why not offer them money, thou? Never fear&mdash;I will
  win it back from them at dice!"</p>

  <p>Ommony offered money, but the Tibetans only showed their teeth in wider
  grins than ever. There was nothing to do but wait until they were pleased to
  move, and they did not do that until the sun was over the highest ridges by a
  full hour and a wind had blown new banks of mist into the ravines. Then
  suddenly, as if they had received a message through the ether, they began to
  pack the ponies and were off in no time without a word of explanation.</p>

  <p>The hills lay in parallel waves that must be crossed diagonally, as a boat
  offers its shoulder to a rising sea. To the northward the huge range of the
  Himalayas made itself felt but was invisible; there was a sense of impending
  immensity, increased by the curtain of cloud that drifted between earth and
  Heaven. Wherever passes gaped between the shoulders of the mountains, dense
  white clouds flowed down along them, looking like incredibly swift glaciers.
  Half of the time the rump of the pony ahead was just discernible through the
  mist, but once in a while some trick of wind would reveal enormous vistas
  that a man could hardly contemplate and keep his balance.</p>

  <p>But the ponies were content to climb hour after interminable hour, and
  Dawa Tsering sang about the wind-swept hills of Spiti as they rose and
  descended through every imaginable plane of vegetation, from steamy bottoms
  where dense jungle stifled them, up through bamboo and rhododendron to where
  oaks and maples flourished&mdash;up beyond those to the fir-line&mdash;up
  again until the firs gave out and raw wind rolled the clouds around them
  straight from Kanchenjunga&mdash;then down again into the suffocating
  tropics, where wood-ticks fell on them and a man's hands were kept constantly
  busy picking leeches off the ponies and Diana had to be gone over carefully
  three times within the hour.</p>

  <p>They crossed rock-cluttered torrents over bamboo bridges that swayed and
  danced under the weight of one pony at a time, and bivouacked again at
  midnight in the clouds, where icy wind shrieked through the chinks of a
  deserted herdsman's hut; then descended two hours after dawn into a steaming
  cauldron where black water quarreled on its way through aromatic jungle.</p>

  <p>Never a sign of the Lama's party, although they passed stone chortens*
  every mile or so, and cairns built by pilgrims, to which every passer by had
  stuck little prayer-flags to flutter the eternal formula "Om mani padme hum."
  There were messages on bits of paper from one pilgrim to another, weighted
  down with stones near some of the chortens, but none that the Lama had
  left.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>chorten</i>&mdash;synonym for <i>stupa</i>
  (Sanskrit), a vase-shaped stone monument of Buddhist origin.]</p>

  <p>And there were unaccountable delays. At times the two Tibetans seemed to
  think they had come too fast and, after a whispered consultation, unloaded
  the ponies whether they appeared to need a rest or not. The ponies rolled on
  sky-hung moss-banks within a dozen feet of the edge of an abyss, and the
  Tibetans chewed oily seed by the handful, offering Ommony some, and pointing
  out good places to sit down when he showed impatience. Dawa Tsering flicked
  at the edge of his knife with a suggestive thumb-nail, but they laughed at
  that, too, showing him a tough tree, dwarfed by the wind, that he could cut
  down if he needed exercise. In their own good time they started off again
  without excuse or argument, usually singing hymns to pacify the spirits of
  the mountains.</p>

  <p>As he drew near Tilgaun Ommony's thought dwelt more on Hannah Sanburn than
  on the Lama and Samding. Aware now that for twenty years she had kept a
  secret from him, in spite of mutual respect and confidence that in every
  other way he could think of had been almost absolute, he wondered how to
  tackle her about it. He did not care to know even a part of her secret
  without letting her know that he knew it.</p>

  <p>There had been times when he had seriously thought of asking Hannah
  Sanburn to become his wife; other times, when the thought that he could
  hardly live at the mission without marrying her had been all that kept him
  from resigning his forestry job and spending the remainder of his life in
  active duty as a trustee at Tilgaun. He was too confirmed a bachelor not to
  flinch from matrimony when he reasoned out all the pros and cons, but in the
  back of his head there was a conviction that Hannah Sanburn would not refuse,
  if he should ask her. But he also had known, any time these past ten years,
  that he never would ask her to marry him unless&mdash;he wondered what the
  reservation was; he had never quite defined it.</p>

  <p>Hunted through his mind and pinned at last into a corner, up there
  thirteen thousand feet above sea-level with a view of Kanchenjunga to adjust
  mere human problems to their right proportion, he realized that he would
  marry Hannah Sanburn&mdash;gladly enough&mdash;at any time&mdash;if by doing
  so he could solve a difficulty from which she could not otherwise escape.</p>

  <p>He was almost convinced that there was a page in Hannah Sanburn's life
  which needed very careful protecting; something which called for limitless
  generosity. He had no use for generosity that hedged itself within
  conventional limits. He liked his freedom and the habit of consulting no
  one's inclinations but his own in private matters, that becomes almost second
  nature in an independent man of forty-five, but he knew he could forego all
  that and be a reasonably companionable married man, if his interpretation of
  the law of friendship should impose that course on him. To Cottswold Ommony
  friendship was the highest law; no conceivable claims could outweigh it;
  Hannah Sanburn was his friend; there was nothing to argue about. But he hoped
  &mdash;without much confidence, but he hoped&mdash;that she was not in the
  predicament he guessed her to be in; suspecting that, since she had kept him
  in the dark for twenty years, she could quite easily have fooled Mrs.
  Cornock-Campbell, who notoriously believed the best of every one.</p>

  <p>He rather dreaded meeting her&mdash;very much dreaded the inevitable
  interview; and although he fretted to overtake the Lama he was much more
  patient with delay than he might otherwise have been, leaving untried a good
  many methods with which he might have persuaded the Tibetans to hurry. He
  salved his conscience by grumbling aloud to them and sotto voce to Dawa
  Tsering, but there was not much energy in his complaints.</p>

  <p>At last, toward the end of the fourth day out, they topped a fifteen-
  thousand-foot rise and looked over a sheer ravine, where eagles perched,
  toward Tilgaun that nestled in a valley with a Lamaist monastery perched on a
  crag three thousand feet above it. The mission buildings glowed warm in the
  westering sun&mdash;one instance where a rich man's money had been spent on
  art as well as altruism, with good manners and respect for other men's
  historical associations, such as missionaries commonly dispense with. The
  graceful contour of the buildings and the color of the carved stone matched
  the panorama. There was no assertiveness, no challenge. The Tibetan
  roof-lines paid acknowledgment to older art on crag and cliff around them.
  Without beauty there is no beatitude. Old Marmaduke, who tortured thirty
  million dollars from protesting pigs, had somehow learned that; so the
  mission buildings were a monument to beauty, not to his ambition or his
  zeal.</p>

  <p>Ommony was thrilled by the sight, as always on his rare visits. All the
  way down the winding track, that looked so short and actually was a
  half-day's journey, he recalled the days when Marmaduke had hurled Chicago
  business methods into battle with obstruction, subtly raised against him by
  foes that were easy enough to identify but undiscoverable when it came to
  issues. Rajahs, all the missionaries, all the Indian priesthood, politicians
  and the press had joined in opposing the project, occasionally praising,
  always preventing.</p>

  <p>Even the banks, that levied toll on Marmaduke's long purse, had invented
  difficulties. There were strikes of labor-gangs (imported in the teeth of
  government obstruction) because money for the pay-roll did not arrive
  punctually. There had been personal attacks on Marmaduke&mdash;three bullets,
  and a dose of ground glass in his food, in addition to assaults on his
  reputation. Missionaries had declared (and perhaps believed) that he was a
  satyr who sought to corrupt young innocents. Consignments of supplies,
  machinery and what-not else had failed to reach the destination, or had
  arrived so smashed as to be useless. Marmaduke had grinned, continued
  grinning, and had won, dying with his boots on six months after Hannah
  Sanburn was installed in charge, hoping, as they laid him on a stretcher,
  that the pigs he had slain for sausage-meat might have most of the credit;
  since it was they who made the mission possible.</p>

  <p>His will, in which he appointed a Tibetan Lama chief trustee, had been a
  nine days' wonder, partly because of its novelty, but mostly because that
  masterly provision introduced an international element, which made it next to
  impossible for politicians to undo the work. Tibet as a military power cannot
  be taken seriously: but it is noteworthy that not even "big business" has
  succeeded in controlling its government or in penetrating its frontiers. The
  backing of the Dalai Lama is worth more, in some contingencies, than a
  billion dollars and a million armed men. (There is a European parallel.)</p>

  <p>And the Tashi Lama* is to the Dalai Lama as is the differential calculus
  to the simple rule of three, only if anything rather more so.</p>

  <p class="first">THERE is a narrow bridge, swung high above a noisy stream,
  that forms the only practicable gate to Tilgaun. On the Tilgaun side is a
  high mound that resembles a look-out post, with a big prayer-flag on top that
  might be the defiant emblem of an army. The track leads below that mound,
  across a hollow, and climbs again toward the mission, more than a mile
  away.</p>

  <p>As Ommony rode across the bridge behind the leading Tibetan he was aware
  of faces peering from the top of the mound beside the prayer-flag. When he
  was midway over the bridge the faces disappeared. When he reached the foot of
  the mound there were six Bhutani mission girls standing in a row on the rim
  of the hollow.</p>

  <p>They wore the Marmaduke Mission costume, which is made from one piece of
  daffodil-yellow fabric woven on the mission looms. Their hair was decked with
  flowers, and they were laughing, that being a part of old Marmaduke's legacy,
  he having had a notion that to laugh with good reason, is two-thirds of an
  education. The other third is harder to acquire, but comes much easier
  because of laughter; or so said Marmaduke, who had considered many pigs, that
  perished.</p>

  <p>They were not so poised and self-reliant as the Lama's dancing girls, but
  they looked marvelously better than the common run of Hill women, and as
  different from ordinary mission converts as a live trout is from a dead
  sardine. At a glance it was obvious that nobody had told them they were
  heathen in their blindness; somebody had shown them how to revel in the
  sunshine and to wonder at the wine-light of gloaming. It was conceivable that
  they had studied nature's mirth instead of watching frogs dissected with a
  scalpel, and had learned to be amused with each existing minute rather than
  to meditate on metaphysical conundrums.</p>

  <p>But they had their heritage nevertheless. Their eyes were on Dawa Tsering.
  It was just as well that there were six of them together.</p>

  <p>Dawa Tsering, gasconading on pony-back with his feet within nine inches of
  the ground, called two of them by name, inquired about a third who was not
  there, and asked whether they had forgotten him.</p>

  <p>"I know a good way to remind you who I am!" he boasted, and got off the
  pony to act the satyr among wood-nymphs. Ommony checked him curtly. He
  protested:</p>

  <p>"I tell you, Ommonee, the gods make free with women and the devils do the
  same! It is ridiculous to pretend we are better than gods and devils. What
  are women for, do you suppose?"</p>

  <p>It was so that they discovered who Ommony was. In that Bhat-Brahmin
  costume covered by a sheepskin coat and without his beard they had not
  recognized him. All six looked at him sharply, hesitated, glanced at the sky,
  accepted that as an excuse, and ran, gathering up the yellow robes and
  showing copper-colored legs, their long hair streaming in the wind behind
  them.</p>

  <p>"Why are they afraid of you?" asked Dawa Tsering. "Are you such a terror
  among women as all that?"</p>

  <p>"It was the rain," said Ommony. But he knew better. The girls were
  giggling.</p>

  <p>The sky had clouded over suddenly, and in a moment, on a blast of icy
  wind, the rain came down in sheets that cut off the view of the mission
  buildings. The ponies turned their rumps to it and stood, heads down, tails
  blown tight under. Diana whimpered and took refuge under the end of the
  bridge, where Ommony joined her; there was no hope of getting the ponies to
  move until the storm passed. It turned to hail and swept the bridge like
  concentrated musketry, lightning and terrific, volleying thunderclaps
  heightening the illusion.</p>

  <p>Twenty minutes later, when the sky cleared as suddenly as it had clouded
  and the setting sun shone on drifts of melting hail, Ommony saw the drenched
  girls leave the shelter of a rock and scamper for the mission gate. He did
  not doubt for one fraction of a moment that they had been sent by Hannah
  Sanburn to the bridge-end to keep a look-out for him. Discontented&mdash;it
  was aggravating to be treated as a potential enemy&mdash;he rode on prepared
  to see the Lama hurrying away ahead of him.</p>

  <p>However, Hannah Sanburn met him in the gate and laughed at his disguise.
  He judged she was relieved, not annoyed to see him. There was all the old
  friendliness expressed on her New England face. Boston, Massachusetts&mdash;
  Commonwealth Avenue or Tremont Street&mdash;stood out all over her, even
  after twenty years of Tilgaun. She was dressed in tailored serge with a
  camel-hair overcoat turned up to her ears. A wealth of chestnut hair,
  beginning to turn gray, showed under a plain deerstalker hat. She had not
  lost one trace of her New England manner&mdash;not a vestige of her pride. No
  weakness, but a firm and comprehending kindness dwelt on the almost manly
  forehead, at the corners of her mouth and in the grand gray eyes.</p>

  <p>"All alone?" asked Ommony, dismounting, shaking hands. He liked her
  laughter; it was wholesome, even if she did look quizzically at his jaw and
  chin that she had never seen before without the modifying beard.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Cottswold. You're a day late. Tsiang Samdup left this morning."</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>She did not answer but looked straight at Dawa Tsering, nodded, smiled at
  his sheepish grin, and walked straight up to him.</p>

  <p>"Give me your knife," she said quietly, and took it from him almost before
  he guessed what she intended. He made no effort to prevent, but sat still on
  his pony, looking foolish. "You shall have that back if you behave yourself,
  not otherwise. If you look twice at one of the mission girls I will order the
  blacksmith to break your knife in two. You understand me?"</p>

  <p>She made friends with Diana next, saying hardly a word but lifting her by
  the forelegs to see whether the feet were injured by the long march. The
  hound accepted her authority as promptly as Dawa Tsering did.</p>

  <p>Stroking Diana's head with one shapely, rather freckled hand, ordering the
  Tibetans to lead the ponies to the stable, she led the way into the stone-
  paved courtyard. Cloistered buildings of worn gray stone formed three sides
  of it, and in the midst there was an oval mass of flowers, damaged by the
  hail but gorgeous in the last rays of the setting sun.</p>

  <p>There was a room reserved for Ommony's exclusive use, in a corner facing
  that front courtyard, and though he had never used it oftener than once in
  three years it had always been kept ready for him. Another room, used less
  seldom, was reserved for Tsiang Samdup in the corner opposite.</p>

  <p>"Mr. McGregor sent your clothes by messenger. You'll find them all
  unpacked and cared for&mdash;lots of hot water&mdash;I'm sorry you can't grow
  a beard in fifteen minutes! Come to my room when you're ready. I'll take the
  dog."</p>

  <p>Ommony shut himself into the room to smoke and think. He dreaded the
  coming interview more and more, the longer he postponed it&mdash;realized
  that what he most detested, in a world full of discordances, was to have to
  account for his actions to anyone else. "Marriage might be all right," he
  muttered, "if women would govern themselves and concede men the same
  privilege."</p>

  <p>He let an hour slip by before he presented himself in Hannah Sanburn's
  private room&mdash;a long room over an archway leading to an inner cloister,
  bow-windowed on both sides, paneled in teak, with a blazing fire at one end.
  The crimson curtains had been drawn; the shaded oil lamps cast a warm glow
  over everything; a square table had been spread near the fire and Hannah
  Sanburn was making toast, stepping back and forward cautiously across Diana,
  who had made herself thoroughly at home on the hearthrug. Old Montagu's
  portrait, life-size, head and shoulders, smiled at the scene from the
  end-wall, the flickering firelight making his shrewd, peculiarly boyish
  features seem almost ready to step out of the frame and talk.</p>

  <p>It was more difficult than ever to put her to the question in that
  atmosphere. She had changed into a semi-evening dress, that aged her a little
  but added an old-worldly charm. It would be difficult to imagine a hostess
  whom one would less like to offend, and the arrival of bacon and eggs on a
  silver tray carried by a seventeen-year-old Bhutani girl provided welcome
  excuse for delay.</p>

  <p>Hannah Sanburn seemed entirely unembarrassed and, if she noticed Ommony's
  air of having something on his mind, she concealed the fact perfectly,
  talking about the events of the mission in a matter-of-fact voice, relating
  difficulties she had overcome, outlining plans for the future, avoiding
  anything that might lead to personal issues.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how much good we're doing-sometimes I think scarcely any,"
  she said at last. "We rear and educate these girls. The best ones, of course,
  stay on for a while as teachers. But they all get married sooner or later and
  lapse into the old ways. It will be a century at least before this school
  begins to make much visible impression."</p>

  <p>Ommony stared at the fire. "Thank goodness, we'll be dead then, with
  something different to fret about," he grumbled, angry with the destiny that
  he felt compelled him to probe a gentlewoman's secrets. She noticed the tone
  of his voice&mdash;could not very well ignore it.</p>

  <p>"What is troubling you, Cottswold? I supposed you were the most contented
  man on earth. Have you lost your interest in your forest?"</p>

  <p>"I've resigned from the forestry." He stared at her, and broke the ice
  suddenly, doing the very thing he was determined not to, blurting a blunt
  question without tact or even a preliminary warning. "Who is this girl Elsa,
  who is never at the mission when I'm here, but who has been to Lhasa, talks
  English and Tibetan, and can draw like Michael Angelo?"</p>

  <p>He jerked his jaw forward to conceal the contempt that he felt for himself
  for having blundered in so clumsily, all the while watching her face but
  detecting no nervousness. To his surprise and relief she laughed and leaned
  her head against the high chair-back, looking at him humorously from under
  lowered eyelids, as she might have listened to a lame excuse from someone in
  the school.</p>

  <p>"Poor Cottswold! How you must have felt uncomfortable!&mdash;you're so
  faithful to your friends. No, Elsa is not my daughter. I have never had that
  experience. If she were my daughter I know quite well I would have said so
  long ago. I can imagine myself being proud of her, even&mdash;even in those
  circumstances."</p>

  <p>"I confess I'm mightily relieved," said Ommony, grinning uncomfortably.
  "Not, of course, that I'd have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, I know you wouldn't," she interrupted. "You are the last person on
  earth I would hide that kind of secret from."</p>

  <p>"Why any kind of secret, Hannah? Am I not to be trusted?"</p>

  <p>"Not in this instance. You're the one man who couldn't be told." Then,
  after a dramatic pause: "Elsa is your niece."</p>

  <p>"Niece?" he said, and shut his teeth with a snap. That one word solved the
  whole long riddle.</p>

  <p>"Her name is Elsa Terry."</p>

  <p>He did not speak. He leaned forward, staring at her under knitted brows,
  his eyes as eloquent as the silence that lasted while the Bhutani girl came
  in and removed the supper table. Even after the girl had gone, for two or
  three minutes the only sounds were the solemn ticking of a big clock on the
  mantelpiece, the cracking of a pineknot in the fire, and a murmur of song
  from a building fifty yards away.</p>

  <p>"You and almost everybody else have always believed Jack Terry and your
  sister Elsa vanished twenty years ago without trace," she said at last. "They
  didn't."</p>

  <p>"Didn't they go to the Ahbor country?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You mean they're alive and you've known it all these years?"</p>

  <p>"They have been dead nearly twenty years. I learned about it soon
  afterward. You know now why they went up there?"</p>

  <p>"I've no new information. Jack Terry was as mad as a March hare&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"I think not," Hannah Sanburn answered, her gray eyes staring at the fire.
  "Jack Terry was the most unselfish man I ever heard of. He adored your
  sister. She was a spiritual, other-worldly little woman, and that beast
  Kananda Pal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I blame Jenkins," said Ommony, grinding his teeth. "Kananda Pal was born
  into a black-art family and knew no better. Jenkins&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind him now. Jack Terry did his best. Your sister Elsa used to
  have lapses; she would cry for days on end and write letters to Mr. Jenkins
  begging him to give back the mind he had stolen from her. No, she wasn't mad;
  it was obsession. I did my best, but I hadn't much experience in those days
  and she was difficult to understand; the phases of the moon seemed to have
  something to do with it; Jack Terry and I were agreed about that. You've met
  Sirdar Sirohe Singh of Tilgaun?"</p>

  <p>Ommony nodded.</p>

  <p>"He has always been a friend. He appears to be a mystic. He knows things
  that other people don't know, and hardly ever talks of them. Jack Terry
  learned from him&mdash;Jack set his arm, or a collar-bone, I forget which
  &mdash;anyway he told Jack about the Crystal Jade of Ahbor."</p>

  <p>Ommony's lips moved in the suggestion of a whistle and Diana opened one
  eye.</p>

  <p>"All the people hereabouts seem to have heard of the jade," Hannah Sanburn
  went on, "but the sirdar seems to be the only one who really knows anything
  about it. All I know is that I have had a piece of it in my hands in this
  house. It nearly drove me frantic to look into it, so I locked it away in
  that cupboard over there. It was stolen by a girl I should never have
  trusted; and I'm nearly but not quite sure it was the sirdar who bribed her
  to steal it from me. She was murdered, apparently while on the way to the
  sirdar's house a few miles from here. Tsiang Samdup was here last night and
  showed me the piece of jade; he said he had recovered it in Delhi."</p>

  <p>"What else did he say?" asked Ommony, but she ignored the question,
  continuing to stare into the fire, as if she could see in it pictures of
  twenty years ago.</p>

  <p>"Jack Terry told me," she went on presently, "that he believed the Crystal
  Jade of Ahbor had magic properties. You know how he believed in magic, and
  how he always insisted that magic is merely science that hasn't been
  recognized yet by the schools. He said mineral springs can heal the body, so
  there was no reason why there shouldn't be a stone somewhere, possessed of
  properties that can heal the mind in certain conditions. I didn't agree with
  him. It seemed to me utter nonsense, although&mdash;I'm less inclined than I
  was then to say things can't be simply because we have been taught the
  contrary. I have held a piece of the Jade of Ahbor in my hands and&mdash;
  well, I don't know, and that's all about it."</p>

  <p>She paused again, perfectly still. Ommony got up, heaped wood on the fire,
  and sat down again. The cracking pine-knots and the ascending sparks broke
  her reverie.</p>

  <p>"It was no use talking to Jack Terry," she continued, "and your sister
  would have gone to the North Pole with him, or anywhere else, if he had as
  much as proposed it. The two set off like Lancelot and Elaine into the
  unknown. You know, the very heart of the Ahbor Valley isn't more than fifty
  miles from here, although they say nobody has ever gone there and returned
  alive. Jack Terry&mdash;you remember how he always laughed at the
  impossible&mdash;said they would probably be gone not more than three or four
  weeks. They took scarcely any supplies with them&mdash;just a tent and
  bedding&mdash;half a dozen ponies&mdash;two servants. The servants deserted
  the third night out and were killed by Bhutani robbers."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ommony. "That was all I could ever find out, and that cost a
  month's investigation."</p>

  <p>"I knew the whole story two or three weeks before you got permission to
  leave your forest and come to investigate; I wasn't allowed to tell."</p>

  <p>"Weren't allowed. Who in thunder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tsiang Samdup came down from the Ahbor Valley and in this room, sitting
  on that hearthrug where the dog lies now, told me the story. I remember how
  he began&mdash;his exact words"</p>

  <p>"'My daughter, there is danger in another's duty. There is also duty in
  another's danger. There is merit in considered speech, but strength consists
  in silence. Truth, that may be told to one, may lead to evil if repeated. I
  am minded to speak to your ears only.'</p>

  <p>"Offhand I told him I would of course respect his confidence, but he sat
  still for about half an hour before he spoke again. Then he took at least
  half an hour to commit me to a pledge of secrecy that I could not possibly
  break without losing my own self-respect. I discovered before he was through
  that he had been quite right to do that, but I confess there were moments
  that evening when it looked as if he had trapped me into something against
  which every moral fiber in me rebelled instinctively. For an hour I hated
  him. And there have been times&mdash;many times since&mdash;when it has been
  extremely difficult to keep the promise. However, I have kept it. It was only
  yesterday that he gave me leave to tell you as much as I know."</p>

  <p>"He might have confided in me in the first place," said Ommony, but Hannah
  Sanburn shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I did suggest that to him. I urged it. But he made me see that he was
  quite right not to. It would have placed you in an impossible position. What
  had happened was this: the Terrys did succeed in entering the Ahbor Valley.
  They seemed to have undergone frightful hardships, and nobody knows how they
  found the way, but they did. They were hunted like animals, and when Tsiang
  Samdup rescued them Jack Terry was dying from wounds, hunger and exposure; he
  had managed somehow to find enough food for his wife, and he had persuaded
  her to eat, and to let him go without."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure of your information?" Ommony asked. "That doesn't sound like
  Elsa."</p>

  <p>"There was a baby coming."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!"</p>

  <p>"Tsiang Samdup took them to his monastery, which is somewhere in the Ahbor
  Valley. The only way he was able to protect them from the Ahbors, who have
  never allowed strangers in the Valley and vow they never will, was by
  prophesying that the baby shortly to be born would be a reincarnation of an
  ancient Chinese saint, named San-fun-ho. There was no hope of saving Jack
  Terry, but Tsiang Samdup hoped to save the mother's life. However, she died
  giving birth to the child, and Jack Terry followed her the same night."</p>

  <p>"Did they leave anything in writing?"</p>

  <p>"I have letters I'll show you presently, written and signed by both of
  them, in which they speak of the Lama Tsiang Samdup as having risked his own
  life to save theirs. Jack Terry wrote that he was dying of wounds and
  exposure. The Lama gave me both letters after he had told the story. But I
  would have believed him without that. I have always believed every word that
  Tsiang Samdup said, even while I hated him for having pledged me to
  silence."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead. I mistrusted him not long ago&mdash;and changed my mind."</p>

  <p>"Tsiang Samdup is not to be doubted, Cottswold. He lied to Ahbors, but
  that was to save life. It was an inspiration&mdash;the only way out of it
  &mdash;to tell those savages that the unborn baby was to be a reincarnation
  of a Chinese saint. I admire him for the lie. Imagine, if you can, old Tsiang
  Samdup&mdash;for he was old even then&mdash;rearing and weaning that baby in
  a monastery in the midst of savages. The Terrys' death seems to have made it
  easier in one way: the natives saw them buried, which satisfied their law
  against admitting strangers, and Tsiang Samdup prevented them from digging up
  the bodies to throw them in the river, by casting a halo of sainthood over
  them on the ground that they had brought a saint into the world. You know how
  all this country to the north of us believes implicitly in reincarnations of
  saints&mdash;the Tashi Lama is supposed to be the reincarnation of his
  predecessor; and so on. Do you see how Tsiang Samdup became more and more
  committed?"</p>

  <p>There was a long silence. Ommony poked the fire restlessly. A native
  teacher came in, offered a report for signature, and went out. Hannah Sanburn
  went on with her story:</p>

  <p>"He had promised those savages a baby saint. He had produced the baby. Now
  he had to educate the saint, and its being a girl made it all the more
  difficult. But it seems there are people to whom Tsiang Samdup can go for
  advice. I don't know who they are, or where they are; he mentions them
  rarely, and very guardedly; I think he has referred to them twice, or perhaps
  three times during all the years I have known him, and then only for the
  purpose of suggesting that he isn't exactly a free agent. The conclusion I
  drew from his guarded hints was, that he acts, and is responsible for what he
  does, but that he would lose the privilege of conference with these unknown
  individuals if he should allow personal considerations to govern him. At
  that, I'm only guessing. He said nothing definite."</p>

  <p>"The Masters!" said Ommony, nodding. "I'll bet you he knows some of the
  Masters!" But if Hannah Sanburn knew who they were she gave no sign. She went
  on talking:</p>

  <p>"It seems that the Ahbors trust him implicitly within certain limits. They
  would kill him and burn his monastery if they caught him practicing the least
  deception; and they watched that baby day and night. The wife of an Ahbor
  chieftain became the wet-nurse, and the child throve, but it very soon dawned
  on Tsiang Samdup that however carefully he might educate her&mdash;(you knew
  he had an Oxford education?)&mdash;she would grow up like a half-breed,
  unless he could have skillful assistance from someone of her own race. So he
  consulted these mysterious authorities, and 'they,' whoever they are, told
  him that a way would open up if he should take me into confidence.</p>

  <p>"As I told you, he first bound me to secrecy. He didn't make me swear, but
  he gave me a lecture on keeping faith, that was as radical as the Sermon on
  the Mount, and he tested me every inch of the way to make sure I agreed with
  him. I have used that sermon over and over again in teaching the teachers of
  this school.</p>

  <p>"When he had me so tied up in my own explanations of what keeping faith
  really means, that there wasn't any possible way out for me, he told me the
  story I have just told you, and made me an astonishing proposal. I have
  sometimes wished I had accepted it."</p>

  <p>Hannah Sanburn paused for a long time, staring at the fire.</p>

  <p>"He offered," she said at last, "to find someone else for my position
  here; to smuggle me into the Ahbor Valley; and to teach me more knowledge
  than Solomon knew&mdash;if I would give unqualified consent, and would agree
  to stay up there and help him educate that baby."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"And I refused," she said quietly. "Won't you put some more wood on the
  fire?"</p>

  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">OMMONY stacked up the fire and resumed his seat in the
  leather armchair that Marmaduke had always used. Diana, belly to the blaze,
  barked and galloped in her sleep. Hannah Sanburn went on talking:</p>

  <p>"Tsiang Samdup said last night that you have been with him two months. Do
  you know then what I mean when I say one can't argue with him? He just sat
  there on the hearthrug and&mdash;it's difficult to explain&mdash;he seemed to
  be listening for an inside message. It may sound idiotic, but I received the
  impression of a man waiting for his own soul to talk to him. He was perfectly
  silent. He hardly breathed. I felt absolutely sure he would find some way out
  of the difficulty. But the strange thing was, that the solution came from me.
  I suppose ten minutes passed without a word said, and I felt all the while as
  if my mind were being freed from weights that I had never known were there.
  Then suddenly I spoke because I couldn't help it; I saw what to do so clearly
  that I simply had to tell him.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't hypnotism. It was just the contrary. It was as if he had de
  hypnotized me. I saw all the risks and scores of difficulties. And I saw
  absolutely clearly the necessity of doing just one thing. I told him I would
  take the child for six months out of every year and treat her as if she were
  my own. He might have her for the other six months. Every single wrinkle on
  his dear old face smiled separately when I said that. I had hardly said it
  when I began to wish I hadn't; but he held me to my word.</p>

  <p>"He brought me the baby the following week, and she was here in this
  building all the while you were ranging the hills for some word of the
  Terrys. The hardest work I ever had to do was to keep silent when you
  returned here worn out and miserable about your sister's fate. But, if you
  had been let into the secret,&mdash;you would have interfered&mdash; wouldn't
  you? Am I right or wrong, Cottswold?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. I would never have dreamed of letting my sister's child go
  back to the Ahbor Valley."</p>

  <p>"Yet, if Tsiang Samdup hadn't taken her every year for half a year, the
  Ahbors would have killed him. And remember: I had bound myself in advance not
  to tell anyone&mdash;and particularly not to tell you. The Lama was only able
  to loan her to me for six months of every year by consenting to the Ahbors
  watching her all the time she was with me. Whenever she has been with me
  Ahbors have watched day and night. The excuse Tsiang Samdup gave to them was
  that unless she should be with me for long periods she would die and the
  Ahbors would find their valley invaded by white armies in consequence. They
  fear invasion of their valley more than anything else they can imagine. On
  the other hand, they regard the child as a gift from Heaven and the old Lama
  as her rightful guardian. I don't quite understand the situation up there;
  the Ahbors don't accept Tsiang Samdup's teachings, they have a religion of
  their own; and he isn't one of them; he's a Tibetan. But they recognize him
  as a Lama, protect his monastery, and submit to his authority in certain
  ways. Perhaps I'm stupid; he has tried very hard to explain, and so has Elsa.
  Privately I called her Elsa, after her mother, of course. Tsiang Samdup gave
  her the Chinese name of San-fun-ho. The word is supposed to signify every
  possible human virtue."</p>

  <p>"Who called her Samding?" Ommony asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>Hannah Sanburn stared. "You know then? This isn't news? I remember now:
  Tsiang Samdup said last night: 'That of which a man is ignorant may well be
  kept from him, but that which he knows should be explained, lest he confuse
  it with what he does not know.'"</p>

  <p>"I'm putting two and two together," Ommony answered. "I leaned over a
  monastery gallery in Darjeeling. The chela was straight underneath me. A beam
  of sunlight showed a girl's breasts. Am I right? Are San-fun-ho, Samding the
  chela and my sister's child Elsa one and the same person?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I wonder you never recognized your sister's voice&mdash;that almost
  baritone boyish resonance. You didn't?"</p>

  <p>"Who are those other girls?"</p>

  <p>"Companions for her! Don't rush me. Wait while I explain. Elsa developed
  into the most marvelous child I have ever known. It was partly Tsiang
  Samdup's influence; he gave up his whole life to training her; and he's wise
  &mdash;I can never begin to tell you how wise he is. But it was partly due to
  her heredity. You see, she had your sister's spiritual qualities, and
  something of Jack Terry's gay indifference to all the usual human pros and
  cons&mdash;the courage of both of them&mdash;and something else added,
  entirely her own. I wish she were my child! Oh, how I wish it! And yet, d'you
  know, Cottswold, down in my heart I'm glad she isn't, simply because, if she
  were mine, she would have missed so much!"</p>

  <p>Hannah Sanburn stared into the fire again, silent until Ommony grew
  restless.</p>

  <p>"There's so much to tell!" she said at last. "I knew from the first, and
  Tsiang Samdup soon discovered that the odds would be all against her unless
  she could have white children of her own age for companions. When he came and
  spoke of that I tried to persuade him to let me send her to America; but at
  the very suggestion he looked so old and grieved and disappointed that I felt
  it would kill him to lose her. I suggested that he should go with her, but he
  said no, he had a duty to the Ahbors. I thought then he was afraid the Ahbors
  would torture him to death and burn his monastery if he should let her go;
  but he read my thoughts and assured me that consideration had no weight. I
  believed him. I believe he is perfectly indifferent to pain and death. He sat
  still for a long time, and then said:</p>

  <p>"'It is better not to begin, than to begin and not go through to a
  conclusion. Then we should only have deprived ourselves of opportunity. Now
  we should rob the child.'</p>

  <p>"He asked me to obtain white children for companions for her. I refused,
  of course, at once to have anything to do with it. We quarreled bitterly
  &mdash;or rather, I did. He sat quite still, and when I had finished scolding
  him he went away in silence. I did not see him again for several months, and
  he never told me how he obtained white children. I can't imagine how he did
  it without raising a scandal all over the world. I have been in agonies over
  it, for fear this mission would suffer. You know, if word once got around
  that we were importing white children into the Ahbor Valley, no proof of
  innocence would ever quiet the suspicion. Just think what a chance the
  Christian missionaries would have for destroying our good name! Can you
  imagine them sparing us?"</p>

  <p>Ommony grinned and nodded. As trustees of a Buddhist mission to the
  Buddhists, he had tasted his share of that zealotry.</p>

  <p>"He obtained the children through the agency of a Jew named Benjamin," he
  said. "They were all orphans. They were saved from God knows what. Go
  on."</p>

  <p>"I have only seen the other children rarely. Now and then they would come
  here in twos and threes, and I used to question them, but they all seemed too
  happy to remember their past, and they only had the vaguest notions as to how
  they ever reached the Ahbor Valley. The general plan was for me to do my best
  with Elsa during the six months of the year she was with me, and for her to
  teach them. Tsiang Samdup said it would be good for her to have to teach them
  &mdash;that she would learn more in that way than any other; and as usual he
  was entirely right.</p>

  <p>"To help the other girls he made them pass their teaching on to Tibetan
  children. But he hasn't had quite the success with the others that he has had
  with Elsa; they hadn't her character to begin with. He never punishes. Have
  you any idea what patience it calls for to educate growing children without
  ever inflicting punishment of any kind&mdash;what patience and skill?"</p>

  <p>Ommony glanced at Diana. "It's the only way. I never punish," he said
  quietly. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"My own share in Elsa's education has been very slight indeed," Hannah
  Sanburn went on. "I had to teach her Western conventions as to table manners
  and so on, and to explain to her what sort of subjects are taboo in what we
  call civilized society. I have taught her to wear frocks properly, have
  corrected her English pronunciation and have given her music lessons. I can't
  think of anything else. The real education has been all the other way; it is
  I who have learned&mdash;oh, simply countless things&mdash;by observing her.
  She never argues. You can't persuade her to tell more than a fraction of what
  she knows. She is afraid of nothing and of nobody. And she is as full of fun
  as the veriest young pagan that ever lived."</p>

  <p>"Is she affectionate?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Intensely. But not demonstrative. I should say she loves enormously, but
  without the slightest jealousy or passion. She has learned Tsiang Samdup's
  faculty of divining people's weakness, and of playing up to their strength
  instead of taking advantage of the weakness or letting it annoy her. The
  result, of course, is that she is instantly popular wherever she goes."</p>

  <p>"How in the world have you kept these mission girls from talking about
  her?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"That was quite easy. They adore her. She is their special secret; and
  they quite understand that if they talk about her outside the mission she
  will stay away. Besides, the mission girls don't have much opportunity to
  talk with outsiders, and those to whom they do talk are superstitious people,
  who speak with bated breath of San-fun-ho of Ahbor. There have been much
  harder problems than that."</p>

  <p>Hannah Sanburn stared into the fire again. It appeared there were painful
  memories.</p>

  <p>"You see, there have been European visitors at times. Some of them came
  unannounced, and sometimes Elsa was here when they came. There were times
  when I could pass her off as a teacher, but sometimes she was discovered in
  boy's clothes, which made that impossible; and whether she was dressed as a
  boy or girl she aroused such intense curiosity that questions became pointed
  and very difficult to answer. I have dozens of letters, Cottswold, from
  friends in Massachusetts asking whether it is true, as they learn from
  missionary correspondents, that I have a child. Some ask why I kept my
  marriage secret. Some insinuate that they are too broad-minded to hold a
  lapse from virtue against me, as long as I don't come home and make it
  awkward for them. Others preach me a sermon on hypocrisy. Quite a number of
  my friends have dropped me altogether. I suppose the strict provisions of the
  penal code have kept people from libeling me in India, but that has not
  prevented them from writing scandal to their friends abroad."</p>

  <p>"What was the idea of boy's clothes?"</p>

  <p>"Education. Tsiang Samdup insists she must know everything he possibly can
  teach her. She has been to Lhasa, far into China, and down into India. He
  could not have taken her to some of those places unless she were disguised as
  his chela; a girl chela would have aroused all sorts of scandal and
  difficulties. Then again, he says all human life is drama and the only way to
  teach is by dramatic presentation; but who, he asks, can present a drama
  unless able to act all parts in it? He says we can only learn by teaching,
  and can only teach by learning; and he is right, Cottswold, he is absolutely
  right."</p>

  <p>"Does he propose that she shall preach a crusade or something like that in
  India?" Ommony asked, frowning.</p>

  <p>"He proposes she shall be an absolutely free agent, possessed of all
  knowledge necessary to freedom. That tour into India was only a part of her
  education."</p>

  <p>"But I saw her as Samding receiving princes of the blood and being almost
  worshiped," Ommony objected.</p>

  <p>"Education. Tsiang Samdup says she will be either flattered or hated
  wherever she goes. He says the hatred will strengthen her. He wants to be
  sure no flattery shall turn her head."</p>

  <p>"And those other girls?"</p>

  <p>"They are to go free also, as and when she goes. Tsiang Samdup is
  fabulously rich. He pays foreverything in gold, although I don't know where
  he gets it. He has secret agents all over India&mdash;sometimes I think
  they're all over the world. He says wherever Elsa goes, she and the other
  girls will be provided for and will find friends."</p>

  <p>"Where does he propose to send them?" Ommony asked, a wave of rebellion
  sweeping over him. He was well schooled in self-control, but all the English
  in him rose against the notion of his sister's child being subject to an
  Oriental's whim. Education was one thing: heritage another.</p>

  <p>Hannah Sanburn laughed. The expression of her face was firm, and yet
  peculiarly helpless.</p>

  <p>"I am not to tell you that."</p>

  <p>"Why in thunder not? You have told so much, that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you were as used as I am, Cottswold, to trusting that grand old Lama,
  and always discovering afterward that his advice was good, you wouldn't press
  the point."</p>

  <p>"My sister's child&mdash;" he began angrily; but she interrupted him.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget: Tsiang Samdup saved the mother from death at the hands of
  savages. It is thanks to him, and to nobody but him, that the baby was born
  alive."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tsiang Samdup told me, and I believe him, that your sister put the new-
  born baby into his arms and begged him to care for it as if it were his own.
  She gave him the baby with her dying breath."</p>

  <p>"What else could she do?" asked Ommony. "Poor girl, she was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But she did it," said Hannah Sanburn. "Can you name one instance in
  which Tsiang Samdup has failed to keep trust to the limit of his power?"</p>

  <p>There followed a long silence, broken only by the faint murmur of singing
  in a hall across the rear courtyard, the falling of burned wood on the
  hearth, and the muttered barking of Diana chasing something in her dreams. It
  endured until Diana awoke suddenly, sat up and growled. There came a man's
  voice from the front courtyard. Two or three minutes later there was a knock
  at the door and a toothless old Sikkimese watchman announced a visitor,
  mumbling so that Ommony did not catch the name. A moment later Sirdar Sirohe
  Singh strode into the room, greeted by thundering explosions from Diana, who
  presently recognized him and lay down again.</p>

  <p>The sirdar without speaking bowed profoundly, once to Hannah Sanburn, once
  to Ommony, then crossed the room and sat down cross-legged on the floor, with
  his back to a corner of the fireplace at Hannah Sanburn's right hand, where
  his own face was in shadow but he could see both hers and Ommony's. Diana
  went up and sniffed him but he took no notice of her.</p>

  <p>"I have word," he said gruffly, at the end of three or four minutes'
  silence.</p>

  <p>He seemed to expect comment.</p>

  <p>"From whom? About what?"</p>

  <p>The sirdar's amber eyes met Ommony's. "You remember? When we met the first
  time I said I was at your disposal to escort you to another place."</p>

  <p>Ommony nodded.</p>

  <p>"But I am not your superior." (The sirdar used a word that conveys more
  the relationship of a guru to his chela than can be expressed by one word in
  English; but at that, the significance was vague.) "Do you wish to come with
  me?"</p>

  <p>In the West it would have been the part of wisdom to ask when, why,
  whither? Twenty and odd years of India had given Ommony an insight into
  arguments not current in the West, however. He did not even glance at Hannah
  Sanburn.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I am ready."</p>

  <p>The sirdar stood up. There was magic in the air. Diana sensed it; she was
  trembling. Hannah Sanburn rose and placed herself between the sirdar and the
  fire, so that he could not pass her easily.</p>

  <p>"Do you accept responsibility?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The sirdar nodded.</p>

  <p>"Will he return here?"</p>

  <p>"As to that I am ignorant. He will arrive there."</p>

  <p>"You will escort him safely to the Lama?"</p>

  <p>Again the sirdar nodded.</p>

  <p>Hannah Sanburn moved and the sirdar strode past her toward the door.
  Ommony started to follow him, but turned, walked deliberately up to Hannah
  Sanburn and kissed her, hardly knowing why, except that he admired her and
  possibly might never see her again. She seemed to understand.</p>

  <p>"Good-by," she said quietly. "If you reach the Ahbor Valley you'll be safe
  enough&mdash;only do what he tells you." Then, divining his intention: "No,
  take the dog. I would like her, but you may need her. The Lama said so.
  Goodbye."</p>

  <p>It was cold outside. Ommony tied on Diana's sheepskin jacket, which was
  hanging, cleaned and dried, from a peg in the hall. Below in the courtyard
  the sirdar turned and said abruptly:</p>

  <p>"To your own room first."</p>

  <p>It was like being led out to be shot. In the gloom in the corner near
  Ommony's door a brown-robed Tibetan waited, carrying something on his arm;
  Ommony seized Diana's collar to keep her from flying at him. He and the
  sirdar followed Ommony into the room and waited while he lit the candles;
  then the sirdar struck a match and lit the overhead oil lamp.</p>

  <p>"Where is Dawa Tsering?" Ommony asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>The sirdar smiled, showing wonderfully even teeth that suggested not
  exactly cruelty, but the sort of familiarity with unavoidable unpleasantness
  that surgeons learn.</p>

  <p>"He will come with us part of the way," he said in a dead-level tone of
  voice.</p>

  <p>Ommony bridled at that. It touched his own sense of responsibility.</p>

  <p>"The man is my servant. What do you propose to do to him?"</p>

  <p>"I am not his master."</p>

  <p>"You said 'part of the way.' What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"Wait and see," said the sirdar.</p>

  <p>"No," Ommony answered. "I will lead no man into a trap. What do you
  intend?"</p>

  <p>The sirdar spoke in undertones to the Tibetan, who tossed a bundle of
  garments on the bed and left the room.</p>

  <p>"You might save time," the sirdar suggested, pointing to the bundle on the
  bed. His manner was polite, and more mysterious than commanding; he undid the
  bundle himself and spread out a Tibetan costume.</p>

  <p>"How about you?" asked Ommony, beginning to undress.</p>

  <p>"I go as I am."</p>

  <p>Ommony put on the warm Tibetan clothes and examined himself in the mirror
  &mdash;laughed&mdash;remarked that he looked like a monk whose asceticism
  consisted in at least three meals a day. But he looked better when he pulled
  on a cloth cap and threw a dark shawl over it. The sirdar, walking around
  him, viewing him carefully from every angle, appeared satisfied.</p>

  <p>Then Dawa Tsering came, unaccompanied by the Tibetan, standing burly and
  enormous in his yak-hair cloak, almost filling up the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Thou!" he said, grinning as his eyes met Ommony's. "Say to Missish-Anbun
  she should return my knife to me. We go where there might be happenings."</p>

  <p>"Where do you suppose we are going?" Ommony asked.</p>

  <p>"To that old Lama's roost, I take it. Between you and me, Ommonee, I am
  glad to go anywhere, so be I get away from this place. My wife is in Tilgaun
  and has sent two of her husbands to catch me and bring me to her!"</p>

  <p>The sirdar grinned, watching Ommony's face. "They practice polyandry in
  these hills," he remarked.</p>

  <p>That was no news, although there was less of it around Tilgaun since the
  Marmaduke influence had begun to make itself felt.</p>

  <p>"Seven husbands are enough for her," said Dawa Tsering. "I grew weary of
  planting her corn-fields and being beaten for my trouble. I am for Spiti,
  where a man can have as many wives as he can manage and they fear him! Let us
  be off before that she-wolf's husbands catch the two of us, thou!"</p>

  <p>Ommony nodded. The sirdar put the lights out and led the way to the outer
  gate, Dawa Tsering following, complaining bitterly about his knife.</p>

  <p>"I am ashamed, Ommonee&mdash;I am ashamed to go back to Spiti without my
  belly-ripper! Where shall I find such another as that? Get it for me! I would
  pay its weight in gold for it&mdash;if I had that much gold," he added sotto
  voce.</p>

  <p>Once outside the gate, though, he was much too eager to be going to fret
  about anything else. The whites of his eyes showed alert in the darkness.
  There were two ponies; he held Ommony's, urging him to mount in haste, then
  ran behind, slapping the pony's rump, pursuing the sirdar's beast, that
  cantered with a Tibetan clinging to its tail. Diana circled around and around
  the party, barking.</p>

  <p>"Thou! Command thy she-dog!" Dawa Tsering panted. "We go through the
  village&mdash;she will awake my wife's husbands&mdash;command her to be
  still, or we are lost!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI.</a><br>
  Ahbor Valley Gate</h2>

  <p class="verse" style="margin-left:20%">Oh, I went where the Gods are, and
I have seen the Dawn<br>
  Where Beauty and the Muses and the Seven Reasons dwell,<br>
  And I saw Hope accoutered with a lantern and a horn<br>
  Whose clarion and rays reach the inner rings of hell.<br>
  Oh, I was in the storehouse of the jewels of the dew<br>
  And the laughter of the motion of the wind-blown grass,<br>
  The mystery of morning and its music, and the hue<br>
  Of the petals of the roses when the rain-clouds pass.<br>
  And so I know who Hope is and why she never sleeps,<br>
  And seven of the secrets that are jewels on her breast;<br>
  I stood within the silence of the Garden that she keeps,<br>
  Where flowers fill the footprints that her sandals pressed;<br>
  And I know the springs of laughter, for I trod the Middle Way,<br>
  Where sympathies are sign-posts and the merry Gods the Guides;<br>
  I have been where Hope is Ruler and evolving realms obey;<br>
  I know the Secret Nearness where the Ancient Wisdom hides.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THEY cantered down the village street and over an echoing
  plank-bridge beneath which starlit water growled over a gravel bed. Only a
  rare light or two shone through the chinks of shuttered windows. Village dogs
  yelped at Diana's heels, but fled when she turned on them. The sirdar never
  glanced backward but rode like a shadow, bolt-upright, vanishing, vanishing,
  forever vanishing into the darkness, yet never more than half a dozen ponies'
  lengths ahead. The sound of his pony's feet was all that made a human being
  of him; otherwise he was a specter.</p>

  <p>The track rose sharply after they crossed the bridge and the ponies slowed
  to a walk, the sirdar maintaining the lead. Dawa Tsering, utterly winded, sat
  down on a rock, swaying his body back and forward to ease the stitch in his
  side. Ommony drew rein to wait for him, peering over a cliff-side into hollow
  darkness filled with the booming of water among rocks two hundred feet below.
  The sirdar shouted from around a bend a little higher up the trail, and
  stones fell into the track as if his voice had loosed an avalanche.</p>

  <p>A dark figure shrouded in black cloth slid down following the stones and,
  before Ommony could move, had jumped to his rein. A young woman's face peered
  up at him, flashing white teeth, but the smile vanished instantly.</p>

  <p>"Dawa Tsering," she muttered, and then began talking so fast that Ommony
  could hardly understand her. Dawa Tsering was in danger; that seemed clear
  enough. Also, she, her own self, wanted him, desired him desperately. She had
  a baby wrapped in a shawl slung over her shoulder and had laid another bundle
  on the ground.</p>

  <p>Ommony pointed down the track, and as he moved his arm two men leaped out
  of a shadow and rushed uphill at Dawa Tsering. Diana flew at them and they
  backed away. They had weapons, but appeared afraid to use them. Dawa Tsering
  ran uphill toward Ommony, feeling for the knife that was not there, and
  Ommony whistled to Diana. The two men followed her cautiously, advancing step
  by step as she retreated, snarling. From the opposite direction around the
  bend, the sirdar came cantering back downhill, sending stones scattering over
  the cliff-side. The girl flung herself at Dawa Tsering, seizing him around
  the neck and pouring out a stream of words, half-intelligible, choked with
  anger, grief, laughter, command, and emotions unknown to those who have not
  loved and do not still love an adventurer from Spiti.</p>

  <p>"Sooner than expected!" the sirdar grunted, drawing rein.</p>

  <p>The sirdar seemed pleased, and to have changed his mind about being in a
  hurry. He sat bolt-upright on his pony and waited in silence for something to
  happen; but the Tibetan behind him drew a long knife and showed it to the two
  men who were standing in the attitude of wrestlers. Dawa Tsering seemed to
  want to run, but the woman clung to him. Diana growled thunderously but
  awaited orders.</p>

  <p>"Who are these men?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"My wife's husbands!" Dawa Tsering shook the girl off and stepped between
  Ommony and the sirdar. It appeared he meant to slip away, but the sirdar's
  pony made a sudden half-turn, and there was nothing left for him but to stand
  or jump over the cliff. "Protect me, Ommonee! I have been a friend to you.
  That dog hasn't a flea on her. Moreover, Missish-Anbun has my knife."</p>

  <p>"Who is this young woman?" Ommony demanded. The sirdar answered. The two
  husbands were about to speak, but waited, open-mouthed. The woman was
  watching the sirdar as if destiny hung on the movement of his lips.</p>

  <p>"She is his. It is his child. Choose!" he commanded, shoving Dawa Tsering,
  making him turn to face him. "Go with her to Spiti, or go with them to
  Ladakh* and the wife of many husbands. Which?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Spiti and Ladakh are Hill States separated by huge
  ranges, and their customs are as different as their climate and geography,
  although their actual distance apart is not great. Mundy's footnote.]</p>

  <p>"But how do I know it is my child?" Dawa Tsering grumbled.</p>

  <p>The sirdar's face was in darkness from the shadow of the overhanging
  cliff. He did not laugh, but his smile was almost audible. "She knows. You
  may learn from her. Choose quickly!"</p>

  <p>"Is it a man child?" Dawa Tsering asked; and the woman burst into excited
  speech, beginning to unwrap the bundle that swung at her back.</p>

  <p>"Well, that is different," said Dawa Tsering. "If it is a man child
  &mdash;there is need of men in Spiti. Very well, I will take the woman."</p>

  <p>"To Spiti!" the sirdar commanded. "Understand: I will write to the Rajah
  of Spiti. You will stay in Spiti and obey him. If you ever again cross the
  boundaries of Spiti without a letter from your rajah giving permission and
  stating the reason for it, you will deal with me!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well!" said Dawa Tsering, shrugging his broad shoulders. "Must I go
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Now!" said the sirdar.</p>

  <p>"Good-by, Ommonee. Now you must pick your own fleas off the dog. I will be
  sorry for you when I think of you without a servant, but I am too well born
  to be any man's servant for long, and this woman is a good one. I will sing
  songs of you in Spiti after you are dead. I think you will die soon. Look out
  for that sirdar; he is a tricky fellow."</p>

  <p>He kicked the bundle the woman had dropped, as a signal for her to pick it
  up and follow him. In another moment he had vanished, clambering by a goat-
  track up the cliff, humming cheerfully through his nose each time he paused
  to let the laden woman overtake him.</p>

  <p>The sirdar faced the discontented husbands, lifting his right hand for
  silence.</p>

  <p>"Go back to that woman in Ladakh, and to her say this from me," he
  ordered. "That it may be I will come to Ladakh. If I come, and when I come,
  it will be well for her if I have no reason to concern myself about her. Turn
  neither to the right nor to the left, nor delay on the road to Ladakh, but
  hasten and tell her my message. And when she has beaten you, tell her a
  second time, and add this that if again she sends men across the boundaries
  of Ladakh, she shall lose them! Go!"</p>

  <p>They went, retreating backward downhill toward Tilgaun, whence another
  track led over a seventeen-thousand foot pass toward their polyandrous
  neighborhood. The Tibetan followed them, presumably to see the order was
  obeyed. The sirdar turned and rode uphill in silence, keeping the middle of
  the track so that Ommony had no room to draw alongside. On the left a cliff
  fell sheer into the darkness; on the right it rose until it seemed to
  disappear among the stars.</p>

  <p>Ommony rode with his woolen clothes wrapped closely against the
  penetrating wind that moaned from over the ravine on his left-hand. Mystified
  by the sirdar's confidently used authority, that could not possibly have been
  vested in him by the British or by any other government (for it seemed to
  extend into several states), his sensations began to be mixed and
  bewildering.</p>

  <p>Suggestions of fear are assertive on a dark night, riding into the
  unknown, without a weapon; and the sirdar's mysterious silence was not
  reassuring. Hannah Sanburn had said he was "always a friend"; but a woman all
  alone in charge of a mission, surrounded by potential danger, would be likely
  to overestimate the friendship of anyone who was not openly hostile.</p>

  <p>It occurred, and kept on recurring, however hard he tried to dismiss the
  thought, that, with the exception of Hannah Sanburn, he alone knew the secret
  about Elsa Terry&mdash;he and probably that sirdar just ahead of him; and the
  sirdar might be one of those dark fanatics whom jealousy makes murderers.
  What if the sirdar were leading him now to his death in the unknown?</p>

  <p>For what purpose had Elsa been educated? Why had she been taken into India
  on that weird dramatic venture? Why had she been to Lhasa, the "forbidden
  city?" Who were the men to whom Hannah Sanburn said the Lama went for advice?
  Mahatmas? Masters? Or something else? What was their purpose? The Lama might
  easily be a saint and yet their tool&mdash;an unworldly old altruist in the
  hands of men who had designs on India; as pliable in their hands as the girl
  appeared to be pliable in his. That journey into India might have been a
  trial venture to discover how far the girl's trained personality could be
  counted on to turn men's (and women's) heads. Gandhi in jail, all India was
  ripe and waiting for a new political mahatma.</p>

  <p>Why, if not to spy on Ommony, had the Lama tolerated Dawa Tsering in his
  company? Dawa Tsering's suspiciously prompt obedience to the sirdar rather
  looked as if the whole thing had been prearranged. In fact, it certainly was
  prearranged; the sirdar had admitted he expected something of the sort. And
  Ommony remembered now that back in Delhi Dawa Tsering had been remarkably
  complaisant about transferring allegiance from the Lama to himself.</p>

  <p>Then&mdash;the Ahbor Valley. Was it likely that the sirdar could be
  leading him into that forbidden country for any other purpose than to make
  sure of his death or possibly to keep him prisoner up there? No white man, no
  government agent, not even one trained Nepalese spy who had penetrated the
  Ahbor Valley had ever returned alive. The only one who ever did return had
  floated, dead and mangled, down the Brahmaputra River. Thirty-five miles
  &mdash;not a yard more&mdash;from the boundary of Sikkim; perhaps thirty
  miles from where they were that minute, the Upper Ahbor Valley was as unknown
  as the mountains of the moon. Why should he suppose that he was to be
  specially favored with permission to go in there and return alive!</p>

  <p>But there was no turning back now&mdash;nothing, of course, to prevent but
  nothing further from intention. Afraid, yes. Faint-hearted, no. The two
  emotions are as the poles apart. Fear acted as a spur to obstinacy, the
  unknown as a lure that beckoned more compellingly than safety; habitually,
  since his school-days, personal safety had been Ommony's last, least
  consideration. He told himself it was the cold wind that made the goose-flesh
  rise, and all that night, shivering, he forced himself to believe that was
  the truth, following the sirdar's pony along trails like a winding devil's
  stairway that led alternately toward the sky and down again into a roaring
  underworld.</p>

  <p>It was pitch-dark, but the deepest darkness lay ahead, where the enormous
  range of the Himalayas was a wall of silence ridged with faint silver where
  the starlight shone on everlasting snow. Darkness may be a substance for all
  that anybody knows about it; it lay thick and somber, swallowing the sounds
  &mdash;sudden, crashing sounds, that volleyed and were gone. A tree fell into
  a watercourse. A rock went cannoning from crag to crag and plunged into an
  abyss. Silence; and then a howl along the wind as a night-prowler scented the
  ponies.</p>

  <p>Bats&mdash;unimaginable thousands of them, black, and less black than the
  night&mdash;until the air was all alive with movement and the squeak and
  smell. Chasms into which the ponies' hoofs struck stones that seemed to fall
  forever, soundless. Dawn at last, touching untrodden peaks with
  crimson-gleaming gold, and stealing lemon-colored down the pillars of the
  sky, to awaken ghosts of shadows in the black ravines. Tree-tops, waist-deep
  in an opal mist, an eagle&mdash;seven thousand feet below the track&mdash;
  circling above those like a fleck of blown dirt. A roar ascending full of
  crashing tumult; and at last a flash of silver on the waves of Brahmaputra, a
  mile and a half below, plunging toward Bengal through the rock-staked jaws of
  Ahbor Valley Gate.</p>

  <p>Downward then, by a trail that seemed to swing between earth and sky, the
  ponies sliding half the time with their rumps against the rock or picking
  their way cautiously with six-inch strides along the edge of chasms, over
  which the riders peered into fathomless shadow that the sunlight had not
  reached. Down to the eagle-level, and the treeline, where the wet scent of
  morning on moss and golden gravel made the ponies snort and they had to be
  unsaddled and allowed to roll.</p>

  <p>Not a word from the sirdar, although he stroked Diana's head when she
  approached him, and laughed at the ponies' antics. On again downward, and a
  hut at last, built of tree-trunks, perched on a ledge of rock above a
  waterfall, on the rim of a tree-hung bowl through which the Brahmaputra
  plunged.</p>

  Under the Brahmaputra</h2>

  <p class="poem">When that caressing light forgets the hills<br>
  That change their hue in its evolving grace;<br>
  When, harmony of swaying reeds and rills,<br>
  The breeze forgets her music and the face<br>
  Of Nature smiles no longer in the pond,<br>
  Divinity revealed! When morning peeps<br>
  Above earth's rim, and no bird notes respond;<br>
  When half a world in mellow moonlight sleeps<br>
  And no peace pours along the silver'd air;<br>
  When dew brings no wet wonder of delight<br>
  On jeweled spider-web and scented lair<br>
  Of drone and hue and honey; when the night<br>
  No longer shadows the retreating day,<br>
  Nor purple dawn pursues the graying dark;<br>
  And no child laughs; and no wind bears away<br>
  The bursting glory of the meadow-lark;<br>
  Then&mdash;then it may be&mdash;never until then<br>
  May death be dreadful or assurance wane<br>
  That we shall die a while, to waken when<br>
  New morning summons us to earth again.<br>
  &mdash;<i>Chant Pagan</i></p>

  <p class="first">SMOKE came from the hut, through a hole in the roof, giving
  the sharp air a delicious tang, all mixed with the aroma of fallen leaves and
  pine trunks. Over beyond the hut spray splashed from the waterfall&mdash;
  rose-colored diamonds against moss-green. The air was full of bird-music,
  that the ear caught after it was once used to the ponderous roar of
  water.</p>

  <p>A man who was undoubtedly an Ahbor&mdash;black hair low down on his
  forehead, high up on his cheeks&mdash;Mongolian cheek-bones&mdash;
  glittering, dark, bold eyes&mdash;hairy legs showing beneath a leather-
  colored smock&mdash;waist girdled with a leather belt, from which a kukri
  like a Gurkha's hung in a wooden scabbard&mdash;peered from the hut door. He
  stared at the sirdar in silence, curiously, as at someone he must tolerate;
  it was the half-shy, half-impudent stare of a yokel at a wealthy man from
  town.</p>

  <p>He took the ponies and was very careful of them, unsaddling, leading them
  to drink, dragging out a sack and spilling grain in the hollow of a rock,
  feeling their legs and rubbing them down with a piece of bark while they
  munched contentedly.</p>

  <p>The sirdar led the way into the hut, but laid a finger on his lips for
  silence. The reason for silence was not evident; there was nobody else in
  there. The place was clean, but almost bare of furniture; there was a hearth
  of rough stones in the midst, a rough table, and a bunk in one corner,
  littered with blue trade-blankets. There was no bench&mdash;no chairs or
  stools&mdash;but there were wooden platters on the table, with big silver
  spoons beside them, and on the hearth imported cereal was cooking in an
  earthen vessel set in a brass one containing water. There was honey in a
  white china bowl, and a big glass pitcher full of milk, which looked as if it
  had stood there overnight; the layer of cream was more than an inch thick.
  There were two cups, without handles, made of alabaster.</p>

  <p>In silence, as if it were a ritual, the sirdar served the meal and they
  ate it standing. Then he walked out and sat on a rock that overhung the
  waterfall. He was not cross-legged in the usual Indian attitude of
  meditation; his long booted and spurred legs were out in front of him, the
  way a white man sits, and he leaned an elbow on one knee, his chin on his
  right fist; motionless in that attitude he stared at the bewildering view
  until he seemed almost physically to become a part of it.</p>

  <p>Ommony watched him from the hut door, now and then losing sight of his
  form in the spray as he wondered what sort of thinking it might be that could
  so absorb the man, and as he watched, wondering, his own inclination was to
  take his shoes off; he felt a pagan reverence possess him, as if that
  dew-wet, emerald and brown immensity, with the thundering river below and the
  blue sky for a roof, were a temple of Mother Nature, in which it were
  impertinence to speak, imposture to assert a personality.</p>

  <p>Diana was watching fish in a pool above the waterfall; the aborigine from
  Ahbor was using his kukri to fashion a wooden implement with which to comb
  the ponies' manes and tails; the birds were hopping on tree and rock about
  their ordinary business, and an eagle circled overhead as if he had been
  doing the same thing for centuries. But there began to be a sensation of
  having stepped into another world.</p>

  <p>Things assumed strange and strangely beautiful proportions. The whole of
  the past became a vaguely remembered dream, in which the Lama, Samding and
  Hannah Sanburn stood out as the only important realities. The present moment
  was eternity, and wholly satisfying. Every motion of a glistening leaf, each
  bird-note, every gesture of the nodding grass, each drop of spray was, of and
  in itself, in every detail perfect. Something breathed&mdash;he did not know
  what, or want to inquire&mdash;he was part of what breathed; and a universe,
  of which he was also a part, responded with infinite rhythm of color, form,
  sound, movement, ebb and flow, life and death, cause and effect, all one, yet
  infinitely individual, enwrapped in peace and wrought of magic, of which
  Beauty was the living, all-conceiving light.</p>

  <p>The enchantment ceased as gradually as it had begun. He felt his mind
  struggling to hold it&mdash;knew that he had seen Truth naked&mdash;knew that
  nothing would ever satisfy him until he should regain that vision &mdash;and
  was aware of the sirdar walking toward him, normal, matter-of-fact, abrupt,
  spurs clinking as his heels struck rock.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready?" asked the sirdar.</p>

  <p>Ommony whistled and Diana followed them along a fern-hung ledge. There was
  opal air beneath them; crags and tree-tops peered out of slow-moving mist
  that the sun was beginning to tempt upward. Presently, leaping from rock to
  rock, until they could hear the river laughing and shouting, sending echoes
  crashing through a forest that had looked like moss from higher up, they
  descended breathless, downward, and forever downward, leaping wild water that
  gushed between worn boulders, swinging by tree-roots around outleaning
  cliffs, Diana crouching as she hugged the wall along a six-inch ledge,
  crossing a yelling cataract by a fallen tree-trunk, whose ax-marks were the
  only sign that the trail was ever used before. They came at last to a bank
  with a cliff behind it, still more than a thousand feet above the
  Brahmaputra, whose thunder volleyed as if a battle were being fought for
  right of way through a rock- and tree-staked gorge defended by all the
  underworld.</p>

  <p>Ommony threw himself down, panting, his clothes sodden with sweat and his
  head in a whirl from the violent exertion and the change in altitude. Every
  sinew in his legs was trembling separately, and his heart thumped like a
  steam-injector. Diana lay still at his feet. The sirdar appeared calm and not
  particularly out of breath; he sat down on a rock near by with an air of
  concentrated attention.</p>

  <p>Presently Ommony began to feel the chill of damp earth under him. He got
  to his feet to look for a better place closer to the cliff, and stood for a
  moment craning upward trying to gauge with his eye the distance they had come
  from the lip of the ravine that showed at one point sharp as a pencil-line
  against the sky. He realized he could never find the way back if life
  depended on it, and guessed there must be another way than that into the
  Ahbor Valley, or how could men and animals find egress? He turned to speak,
  leaning one hand against the cliff.</p>

  <p>"This way!" said the sirdar's voice on his left hand; and before he could
  turn he felt himself shoved violently. His head still singing from the strain
  of the descent, a vertigo still swimming through his brain, he was sure, but
  only dimly, that he had been pushed, then pulled through a narrow fissure in
  the shadowy corner of a projecting spur. He had scarcely noticed the opening
  &mdash;had not observed that the lower portion of the spur was split away,
  like the base of a flying buttress, from the wall itself. Within, the opening
  turned and turned again, a man's breadth wide each shoulder against the wall,
  a zigzag passage driven (there were tool marks) into a granite mountain; and
  when he turned to look, there was nothing to see but the outline of the
  sirdar's head against dim light behind him.</p>

  <p>Diana forced her way between his legs and ran ahead to explore; he could
  hear her hollow barking&mdash;"All's well so far&mdash;marvelous! mysterious!
  exciting!"&mdash;and then the sirdar shoved him forward, saying not one word.
  He could not see, but felt the whirring of bats, and knew by the sound that
  he had stepped into a cavern. The sirdar groped and found an oil lantern with
  a bail. Lighting it, and swinging it until the shadows leaped like giant
  goblins and enormous bats streamed in panic toward the open air, he led the
  way to a low tunnel at the rear through which it was just possible to walk by
  bending nearly double.</p>

  <p>At the end of fifty yards of that uncomfortable going, there was vastness,
  black as pitch, and such empty silence that the ear-drums ached. The lantern
  light shone into nothing and was swallowed&mdash;ceased, except where it
  struck the natural, dark-granite wall and the end of the hewn tunnel. They
  were standing on a platform ten feet wide, from which hewn steps descended
  forever and ever for all the brain could guess. The roof was utterly
  invisible; the space beneath it was alive with whirling bats. The air was
  breathable but stuffy. Sweat began to stream from every pore.</p>

  <p>"What next?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"What next&mdash;ot nex&mdash;ot nex&mdash;ot nex&mdash;ot nex!" the
  echoes answered, dying away in a grumble at last somewhere in the bowels of
  the world.</p>

  <p>He did not care to speak again. He tried to suppress thought, lest the
  echoes should learn that and multiply and mock it in the solemn hugeness of
  the underworld. Diana was afraid now&mdash;crouched against his legs and
  howled when the sirdar started down the smooth stone steps, that looked
  dark-green in the lantern light.</p>

  <p>The howl let loose the hounds of Pandemonium. A phantom pack gave tongue
  in full cry down the valley of hell&mdash;pounced on their quarry leagues
  away&mdash;worried it&mdash;and vanished into silence. The sirdar laughed,
  and the laugh went after them, until a thousand devils seemed to mock the
  ghost the hounds had slain. Diana was seized with panic and had to be dragged
  by the collar. Ommony did not dare to speak to her for fear of the echoes. He
  tried whispering once, but only once; it turned into a hiss that made Diana
  tremble in abject misery.</p>

  <p>The echo of their feet was bad enough. Each downward step was repeated
  until the darkness became full of a din like the clapping of unseen hands;
  the clink of the sirdar's spurs was multiplied into the jingle and clank of
  ghostly squadrons, and the whirring of unseen bat-wings grew into the snort
  of the war-horses charging line on line. It was easy enough to imagine lance
  and pennon, and the dead from a thousand battle-fields repeating history.</p>

  <p>Ommony began trying to count the steps, but lost the reckoning at the
  sixth or seventh turn; the stairway zigzagged to and fro across the face of a
  wall that seemed from its smooth, yet irregular feel to have been hewn by
  giants from the virgin rock. And when they did at last reach bottom there
  appeared by the swinging lantern light to be a causeway running right and
  left, gay-white and firm with a million years accumulation of the bats'
  excreta.</p>

  <p>The sirdar hesitated&mdash;took the right-hand way, and led with a
  swinging stride that it took all of Ommony's strength to follow. There was
  hardly any echo now, because the bat-dirt underfoot consumed the sound (and
  filled the air, too, with acrid dust), but there began to be a weird, very
  far-away rumbling, at first not more than a peculiar, irregular pulsation of
  the silence, gradually increasing until it sounded as if all the echoes in
  the world were hiding in the cellar of a mountain, crowding one another to
  find room.</p>

  <p>A roof became vaguely visible at last. They were entering a tunnel, whose
  floor sloped downward. It appeared to have been originally a natural fissure
  in the base of a granite mountain; Titans had hewn and enlarged it, leaving
  buttresses six feet square of natural rock, that curved overhead until they
  met to support the roof. They were spaced about twenty feet apart, and every
  gap between was occupied by an enormous image, hewn out of the wall,
  resembling nothing in the world that Ommony had ever seen. Vaguely, but only
  vaguely, they suggested temple images of ancient Egypt. No two were alike.
  Due to the moving shadows, they appeared to change position as the lantern
  passed them, and the weird sounds that filled the tunnel suggested
  conversation in the language of another world.</p>

  <p>The only remark the sirdar made of any kind was midway down the tunnel,
  more than a quarter of a mile from the point where its roof had first become
  dimly visible. He paused for a moment, seemed to hesitate whether or not to
  speak, then pointed upward.</p>

  <p>"We are under the Brahmaputra."</p>

  <p>His voice sounded muffled. The noise of the tremendous river galloping and
  plunging overhead absorbed all other sounds.</p>

  <p>"How thick is the roof?" Ommony asked. But he did not know how to pitch
  his voice; the words died on his lips; his own ears could not hear them.</p>

  <p>In one place there was water; it appeared to be an artificial drain; there
  was a trickling, sucking sound where it disappeared through a hole in the
  wall into obscurity. The floor for twenty yards was built of very heavy
  timber spiked on to transverse beams laid in slots in the rock wall; the
  slots were very ancient and the timbers not a generation old, marked here and
  there with the print of ponies' hoofs&mdash;which seemed to Ommony to prove
  one point at any rate: there must be another way out from the Ahbor Valley
  than that goat-path down the side of the ravine. No pony, laden or unladen,
  could negotiate the trail by which he and the sirdar had come.</p>

  <p>Once they had crossed the wooden bridge the track began to rise, but the
  sirdar continued leading at the same speed, neither heat nor stuffiness
  impeding him. He swung the lantern in his right hand with an air of
  indifference, as if he had long ago ceased wondering at the Titan labors of
  the men who hewed the tunnel. There was no air of haste about him; his
  natural speed appeared to be more than four miles an hour, just as his
  natural mood was silent, and his natural condition fearless, unsurprised,
  indifferent to circumstance.</p>

  <p>The air began to improve at last, as they emerged into a cavern into which
  one shaft of sunlight shone through an opening so high overhead that its
  milky-whiteness, spreading and dispersing, formed a layer, below which the
  gloom grew solid. The sensation was of being in a grotto under water and
  looking upward through a cave-mouth toward the surface of the sea. One almost
  expected to see fish swimming across the zone of light.</p>

  <p>The sirdar allowed Ommony to rest at last. He sat on a rock that resembled
  an altar, set the lantern on another, and motioned to Ommony to be seated on
  a third. There were seven stones, exactly similar in shape and size, arranged
  so as to suggest the constellation of the Pleiades;* the seventh, which might
  be Merope, was surrounded by a circle of masonry, perhaps to suggest that
  that one is invisible to the naked eye. About and among the big stones there
  were hundreds of smaller ones, all of the same shape but of different sizes,
  arranged in no evident pattern, but nevertheless sunk into place in hollows
  cut deliberately in the rock floor. It looked as if whoever set them there
  knew a great deal more about the stars than any naked eye reveals.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Pleiades</i>&mdash;the ancient Greek legend of the
  Pleiades is that they were the daughters of Atlas and Pleione, and that the
  seventh, Merope, concealed herself out of shame for having loved a mortal.
  But the legend is doubtless vastly older than the Greeks and has an esoteric,
  or hidden meaning. A telescope reveals hundreds of stars in the
  constellation.]</p>

  <p>As Ommony grew gradually used to the dim light the shapes of enormous
  carvings revealed themselves on walls so high that imagination reeled in the
  effort to measure them. The shape of the cavern was that of the inside of a
  hollow tree-trunk, broad at the base, narrowing toward the top until it
  vanished in impenetrable gloom somewhere above the shaft of light. The walls
  were all irregular, almost exactly resembling in rough outline the interior
  of a hollow tree; and wherever there was space a figure had been carved,
  half-human, ponderous, as contemplative as the Sphinx.</p>

  <p>Wherever the eye rested long enough a figure would develop in the gloom,
  until the darkness appeared full of awful faces that had been there,
  pondering immensity, since time began.</p>

  <p>As well as Ommony could judge, they were in the core of a hollow granite
  mountain. He turned to question the sirdar, but as he moved a sound like a
  distant trumpet blast came from above and, glancing upward, he saw a speck
  that might be a human being, moving on the lip of the opening through which
  the shaft of light came. Diana howled at the sound, but the howl was lost in
  the enormous space; there were no echoes.</p>

  <p>The sirdar made no comment, but got to his feet at once and holding up the
  lantern examined Ommony's face for a moment intently. His expression was of
  exercising judgment, but he said nothing, did not even nod. His amber eyes
  looked hardly human in the dimness, and glowed with a reddish light behind
  them&mdash;leonine, but curiously passionless. Swinging the lantern again, he
  turned and led the way toward a projection outflung like a buttress from the
  nearest wall.</p>

  <p>There began then an ascent that almost conquered physical endurance.
  Steps, whose treads, hewn from the rock, were eighteen inches high, followed
  the outline of the ragged walls and circled the whole huge cavern three times
  toward the opening through which the light poured in. There were places, but
  not many of them, where the way ran almost level along a ledge for fifty feet
  or so, and thigh muscles had a chance to rest from the agony of climbing. The
  only other resting places were the crowns of smooth gigantic heads that gazed
  forever into vastness. There was no rail, no balustrade; the steps were
  nowhere more than three feet wide, with nothing on their outer edge but
  darkness and a terrifying certainty of what would happen if a foot slipped or
  if vertigo prevailed. Diana, thrusting herself between the wall and Ommony,
  pressed herself against him for the sake of human company, adding to the
  terror of the long ascents where no huge head projected to afford a sense of
  something solid between the wall and the abyss.</p>

  <p>The sirdar seemed tireless. Ommony ached in every sinew of his being.
  Blood sang in his ears and eyes. Thirst began to torture him. A stitch like a
  knife-jab gnawed under his ribs. Repeatedly he had to lie face-downward on a
  level place, pressing both hands tightly on the stone while the whole cavern
  and all the silent heads seemed to whirl and whirl around him. Then Diana
  licked the back of his neck, and the sirdar waited twenty or thirty yards
  higher up, swinging the lantern as if its constant rhythmic movement were in
  some way necessary. He never spoke once, made no sound other than his
  footsteps and the clink of spurs, all the way up; but now and then he stood
  on the crown of a head overhanging the cavern and swung the lantern in wider
  sweeps, as if he were signaling to someone.</p>

  <p>The shaft of light faded and almost disappeared before they reached the
  opening. Ommony was in no condition then to reckon up the hours or to guess
  at the height he had climbed. Not more than barely conscious, he collapsed on
  a smooth platform that sloped dangerously outward, his fingers trying to grip
  the rock and his feet continuing to climb. He felt the sirdar (or somebody)
  seize him by the armpits, heard Diana growl, and the next he knew he was
  lying face-upward with cool water on his lips, a cool breeze on his face, and
  a star-lit sky overhead. He felt Diana nosing at his hair, and knew nothing
  after that for several hours.</p>

  The Lama's Home</h2>

  <p class="quote">In this sense we are our brothers' keepers: that if we
  injure them we are responsible. Therefore, our duty is, so vigilantly to
  control ourselves that we may injure none; and for this there is no
  substitute; all other duties take a lower place and are dependent on it.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">WHEN Ommony recovered consciousness it was some time before
  he was sure he was not dreaming. There was no sense of stability. The
  universe appeared to sway beneath him, and the sky, when he opened his eyes
  at last, swung like a compass-card. He closed his eyes, heard voices, and
  presently discovered he was in a stretcher being borne on men's heads. When
  he opened his eyes again the first thing he saw was Diana looking down at him
  from a rock. She barked when he moved his hand.</p>

  <p>It was a very rough stretcher made of poles and hide. His feet were
  loosely tied to it and a rope was passed over his breast, but he could get
  his hands under the rope, and its purpose was explained when the stretcher
  became tilted at an acute angle and he rode for a while with his feet pointed
  at the sky. On either hand were sloping limestone cliffs and he was being
  carried up a dry watercourse between them.</p>

  <p>He felt no impulse to ask questions, but was curious about his own
  condition. He recalled rather vividly a time, ten years ago, when he was
  carried to an operating room. When the stretcher returned to the horizontal
  and he cautiously tested each muscle, he discovered that his leg-sinews were
  so stiff that he could hardly bear to move them. Then he remembered; every
  step of the climb up that titanic stairway came back to him like a
  nightmare.</p>

  <p>He craned his neck looking for the sirdar, but failed to discover him. He
  could not see the stretcher-bearers, but there were eight Ahbors walking
  behind, ready to relieve them&mdash;hairy, savage-looking men, possessed of
  that air of deliberate indifference that usually hides extreme fanaticism;
  their eyes were large, like those of deer, and the hair came close up to
  their cheek-bones. They all had weapons; two were armed with bow and arrows;
  but no two weapons were alike, and no two were dressed exactly alike.</p>

  <p>Presently the path began to follow the edge of a cliff five or six
  thousand feet above a river&mdash;undoubtedly from its size the Brahmaputra
  &mdash;that galloped and plunged among rocks in the bed of a valley on the
  left hand. Incredible, enormous mountains leaned against the sky in every
  direction, suggesting barrenness and storms, but the valley lay golden and
  green in the sunlight, patched with the vivid green of corn-fields, dotted
  with grazing cattle and with the dark-brown roofs of villages. It looked like
  an exceedingly rich valley, and well populated.</p>

  <p>After a mile or two of gorgeous vistas the track turned to the right and
  passed between miles of tumbled ruins, whose limestone blocks, weighing tons
  apiece, had turned to every imaginable hue of green, gray, brown and yellow.
  Blue and red flowers were growing in the crevices, and trees had forced
  themselves between tremendous paving stones that now lay tilted with their
  edges to the sky. Ommony untied the rope across his breast and sat up to
  observe the ruins, laying both hands on his thighs to ease their aching; and
  presently he gasped&mdash;forgot the agony.</p>

  <p>The track passed between two monolithic columns more enormous than the
  grandest ones at Thebes, and emerged on the rim of a natural amphitheater,
  whose terraced sides descended for about two thousand feet to where a torrent
  of green and white water rushed from a cave mouth and plunged into a fissure
  in the limestone opposite. The air was full of the noise of water and the
  song of birds, intoxicating with the scent of flowers and vivid with their
  color.</p>

  <p>Every terrace was a wilderness of flowers and shade trees, strewn with
  boulders that broke up the regularity, and connected one with another by
  paths and bridges of natural limestone where streams gushed from the
  fern-draped rock and fell in cascades to the torrent in the midst. There was
  an atmosphere of sunlit peace.</p>

  <p>Above the topmost terrace, occupying about a third of the circumference,
  were buildings in the Chinese style; the roofs were carved with dragons and
  the rear walls appeared to be built into the cliff, which rose for a thousand
  feet to a sheer wall of crags, whose jagged edges pierced the sky.</p>

  <p>There were no human beings in evidence, but smoke was rising from several
  of the buildings, which all had an air of being lived in. The track, which
  was paved now with limestone flags, led under an arch in the midst of the
  largest building. The arch turned out to be the opening of a tunnel, twenty
  feet high at lowest and as many wide, that pierced the mountain for more than
  a hundred yards, making two sharp turns where it crossed caverns and followed
  natural fissures in the limestone before it emerged on the edge of a sheer
  ravine, overlooking another valley that appeared to approach the gorge of the
  Brahmaputra at an angle of nearly forty-five.</p>

  <p>Away in the distance, like a roaring curtain, emerald green and diamond
  white, blown in the wind, the Tsang-po River, half a mile wide, tumbled down
  a precipice between two outflung spurs that looked like the legs of a seated
  giant. The falls were leagues away, and yet their roar came downwind like the
  thunder of creation. Below them, incalculably far below the summit, the
  rising spray formed a dazzling rainbow; and where, below the falls, the
  Tsang-po became the Brahmaputra, there were rock-staked rapids more than two
  miles wide that threw columns of white water fifty feet in air, so that the
  rocks looked like leviathans at war.</p>

  <p>The path led up the side of the ravine, curved around a projecting
  shoulder, and entered another tunnel, which emerged at the end of fifty yards
  into a natural cavern. There the bearers set the stretcher down and two of
  them offered to help Ommony up a long flight of steps hewn from the limestone
  rock. However, he managed to walk unaided and Diana followed him through a
  great gap in the wall into what was evidently the basement of a building.</p>

  <p>There he was met by a brown-robed monk&mdash;not an Ahbor, a Tibetan
  &mdash;who smiled but made no remark and led him up winding stairways between
  thick masonry walls to a gallery that overhung the valley from a height which
  made the senses reel. It was the upper of two galleries that ran along the
  face of a building backed against a cliff; doors and small windows opened all
  the way along it, but the Tibetan led around the far corner, where the wooden
  planking came to an end at a stone platform and there was one solitary door
  admitting to a room about thirty feet by twenty, that had a window facing the
  tremendous Tsang-po Falls.</p>

  <p>It was in all respects a comfortable room, with a fireplace at one end and
  a bright fire burning. On either side of the fireplace there were shelves
  stacked with European books in several languages. The stone floor was covered
  with a heavy Chinese rug. There was no glass in the window, but there were
  heavy shutters to exclude wind and rain, as well as silken Chinese
  curtains.</p>

  <p>The monk went away and returned presently with a pitcher of milk and some
  peculiar cakes that tasted as if made from a mixture of flour and nut-meat,
  raised with butter. He signed to Ommony to eat and, when he had finished,
  took the pitcher and plate away again.</p>

  <p>Ommony warmed his legs at the fire, rubbed them to reduce the stiffness,
  and chose a book at random&mdash;Kant's Critique of Pure Reason; it was well
  thumbed. He sat down in a chair before the fire to read, regarding the book
  as no more incomprehensible than his own predicament and likely to keep his
  mind off profitless conjecture. He was too tired to think about his own
  problem&mdash;too sore in every muscle to consider sleep. One fact was clear:
  he had been admitted to the Ahbor Valley, and there must be some reason for
  it. For the time being, that was enough&mdash;that, and the comforting sense
  that all motion had ceased and he could sit still within four walls that shut
  off the stunning hugeness of the scenery. He had no geographical
  curiosity&mdash;was not qualified in any event to make a map that would be of
  any real value, and was not sure it would be courteous to try to do it.
  People who don't invade other people's countries have a right to their own
  privacy. Besides, he was quite sure he could never retrace the way into the
  valley, and doubtful whether he could find a way out of it, except down that
  thundering river. He was absolutely at the Lama's mercy, and entirely sure
  the Lama was a man of superb benevolence, if nothing else.</p>

  <p>Finding he could not make head or tail of Kant in the original German (he
  spent ten minutes trying to find the subject of one verb) he laid the book
  down and began to wonder whether this was the place in which his sister and
  Jack Terry had died. Time vanished. Thought took him back to the days when he
  had sent for his sister Elsa, then seventeen, to come to India and keep house
  for him. He frowned, blaming himself for having been the cause of all she
  suffered. They had had so much in common, and he had understood so well her
  craving for knowledge that is not in any of the textbooks, that he had
  tacitly encouraged her to make acquaintances which his better judgment should
  have warned him to keep out of her reach. He wondered just to what extent a
  man is justified in guiding or obstructing a younger sister's explorations
  into unknown realms of thought&mdash;knew that he himself would resent any
  leading-rein&mdash;knew nevertheless, that he felt guilty of having neglected
  to protect his sister until protection and precaution were too late. He had
  done his best then, but&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Dammit, are we or aren't we free agents?" he asked aloud, staring at the
  fire; and then he heard Diana's tail beating the Chinese rug. It sounded as
  if the dog were laughing at him! He turned his head sharply&mdash;and saw the
  Lama standing in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"We are free&mdash;to become agents of whatever power we wish," said the
  Lama, smiling. "Don't get up, my son. I know how thighs ache after a climb up
  the stairs of the Temple of Stars. The sirdar does not know the other
  entrance to the valley."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" asked Ommony, staring. He was not particularly interested
  in the sirdar. A suggestion as to who and what the Lama might be, had
  occurred to him suddenly. He was sparring for time to follow up that
  thought.</p>

  <p>"He returned," said the Lama, sitting on a chair before the fire,
  betraying an inclination to tuck his legs up under him but resisting it. "The
  Ahbors would have killed him if he passed beyond the opening. They would have
  killed you&mdash;if it were not for Diana the dog. My son, you wonder why I
  left you in Darjeeling? There were seven reasons; of which the first is that
  I have no right to lead you out of your environment; and the second, that you
  have the right to make your own decision. The third reason was that these
  Ahbors guard their valley very strictly; it is their valley; they also have
  their rights. The fourth reason was, that an excuse must be presented to the
  Ahbors for admitting you. The fifth, that I alone could do that. The sixth,
  that I must make the excuse in advance of your coming, since they would not
  listen unless given time to consider the matter. And the seventh reason was,
  that it was fitting you should learn why this has been kept from you for
  twenty years, before you learn as much of the secret as I can show you.
  Behind each of those seven reasons are seven more beyond your comprehension.
  You spoke with Miss Sanburn?" Ommony nodded. Suspicion was approaching
  certainty. He wondered that the thought had not occurred to him long
  before.</p>

  <p>"Where is the chela&mdash;Samding&mdash;Elsa Terry&mdash;my niece?" he
  asked. There is no foretelling which emotion will come uppermost. He felt a
  bit humiliated. It annoyed him to think he had lived for two months in almost
  constant association with his sister's child and had never guessed it;
  annoyed him more to think that the Lama should not have trusted him from the
  beginning; most of all that he had not guessed the Lama's identity. He felt
  almost sure that he had guessed right at last. Nothing but a western dread of
  seeming foolish restrained him from guessing aloud.</p>

  <p>But the Lama read his thoughts, and answered the unspoken question first
  in his own way, his bright old eyes twinkling amid the wrinkles.</p>

  <p>"Those who are trustworthy, my son, eventually prove it&mdash;always, and
  it is only they to whom secrets should be told. It is not enough that a man
  shall say, 'Lo, I am this, or I am that.' Nor is it enough that other men
  shall say the same of him. Some men are trustworthy in some respects, and not
  in others. He who trusts, and is betrayed, is answerable to his own soul.
  &mdash;Do you think it would have been fair to trust you with the secret of
  my chela?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>Ommony side-stepped the question by asking another: "Why do you call her
  San-fun-ho?"</p>

  <p>"It is her name. It was I who gave it to her. She accepted it, when she
  was old enough to understand its meaning. Do you know Chinese? The word means
  'Possessor of the three qualities,' but its inner meanings are many&mdash;
  righteousness, virtuous action, purity, benevolence, moral conduct,
  ingenuousness, knowledge, endurance, music&mdash;and all the qualities that
  lie behind those terms."</p>

  <p>"You think she has all of them?" Ommony asked. His voice held a hint of
  sarcasm. He intended that it should.</p>

  <p>"My son, we all have them," said the Lama. "But she is the first ordinary
  mortal I have known, who could express them."</p>

  <p>Ommony pricked his ears at the word "ordinary."</p>

  <p>"You know&mdash;you have seen the Masters?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>The Lama blinked, but otherwise ignored the question, exactly as every one
  Ommony had asked, who was likely to know, always had avoided it. There is a
  legend about mysterious "Mahatmas,"* whom all the East believes in, but whom
  none from the West has ever met (and talked much about afterward).</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The legend persists; mocked by the missionaries and
  denied by governments, but believed, nevertheless, by multitudes of ignorant
  people and by an increasing number of thoughtful investigators. There is much
  vague rumor and some corroborated detail, but whoever really knows the facts
  is silent. Mundy's footnote.]</p>

  <p>"No man ever had such a chela," said the Lama, changing the subject and
  betraying the first hint of personal emotion Ommony had ever noticed in
  him.</p>

  <p>"Are you one of the Masters?" Ommony demanded, sitting bolt upright,
  studying the old man's face.</p>

  <p>But the Lama laughed, his wrinkles dancing with amusement.</p>

  <p>"My son, that is a childish question," he said after a moment. "If a man
  were to tell you he is one of the Masters, he would be a liar and a boaster;
  because it must be evident to anyone who thinks, that the more a man knows,
  the more surely he knows there are greater ones than himself. He is a Master,
  whose teaching you accept. But if he should tell you there is none superior
  to himself, it would be wise to look for another Master!"</p>

  <p>But Ommony felt more sure than ever. He knew that Pythagoras, for
  instance, and Appolonius, and scores of others had gone to India for their
  teaching. For twenty years he had kept ears and eyes alert for a clue that
  might lead him to one of the preservers of the ancient wisdom, who are said
  to mingle with the crowd unrecognized and to choose to whom they will impart
  their secrets. He had met self-styled Gurus by the dozen&mdash;a perfect host
  of more or less obvious charlatans&mdash;some self-deceived dabblers in the
  occult, whose motives might be more or less respectable&mdash;but never a
  one, unless this man, whose speech and conduct had appeared to him consistent
  with his idea of what a real Mahatma might be.</p>

  <p>"Hannah Sanburn told me," he said slowly, "that there are individuals to
  whom you go for advice. Did she tell the truth?"</p>

  <p>"She received that truth from my lips," said the Lama, nodding.</p>

  <p>"Are they the Masters?"</p>

  <p>"The Masters are only discoverable to those, who in former lives have
  earned the right to discover them," the Lama answered. "There is a Higher Law
  that governs these things. It is the Law of Evolution. We evolve from one
  state to another, life after life, being born into such surroundings as
  provide us with the proper opportunity. It was not by accident, my son, that
  San-fun-ho was brought into the Ahbor Valley to be born."</p>

  <p>"Do the Masters live here?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the Lama, smiling again.</p>

  <p>"Then what is the particular advantage of the Ahbor Valley?"</p>

  <p>"My son, I do not rule the Universe! It was not my province to arrange the
  stars! There is no place, no circumstance that does not have particular
  advantages. The Ahbor Valley is more suitable to some than to others, but I
  am not the one who selects those who shall come here."</p>

  <p>"Who does?"</p>

  <p>"There is a law that governs it, just as there is a law that rules the
  stars, and a law that obliges one to be born rich and another poor. When did
  cause begin? And when shall effect cease? Can you answer that?"</p>

  <p>"At any rate, you were the cause of my coming here," said Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Nay, my son! No more than I was the cause of your coming into the world.
  If I should have caused you to come here, I should be responsible for all the
  consequences; and I do not know what those might be. I have permitted you to
  come here. I have removed some difficulties."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I sought to remove other difficulties from the path of someone
  else, and it seemed to me possible that you might be the one who can assist.
  Remember: it was not I who caused you to resign your position under the
  Indian Government; not I who appointed you a Trustee at Tilgaun; nor I who
  invited you to disguise yourself as a Bhat-Brahmin. Have I ever given you
  advice on any of those matters?"</p>

  <p>"No," Ommony admitted. "But you have corresponded with me ever since
  Marmaduke died, and if your letters weren't educative, what were they?"</p>

  <p>"Evocative!" the Lama answered. "Shall I show you the copies of all the
  letters I have written to you? I believe you will not find one word in them
  that might evoke from you anything except your higher nature, nor one word
  that you could twist into inducement to do this, or to do that. I have taught
  you nothing. You have tried to understand my letters, and have found a
  guiding force within yourself. I am not your guide."</p>

  <p>"Well then&mdash;why the interest in me?" Ommony retorted.</p>

  <p>"My son, you are immensely interesting. You were forced on my attention. I
  have my work to do, and I have nearly finished it."</p>

  <p>The old man paused, and suddenly he seemed so old and tired that all his
  previous exertions&mdash;night-long rides on camel-back, two months of
  journeying in the heat of the Indian plains, patient control of a dramatic
  company, and (not least) the return across the mountains to his home&mdash;
  appeared incredible. For a moment sadness seemed to overwhelm him. Then he
  smiled, and as if his will shone through the cloud and warmed the worn-out
  flesh, he threw off fifty years.</p>

  <p>"For what purpose are we in the world?" he asked. "The purpose lies in
  front of each of us. It is never more than one step in advance, and whither
  it leads, who knows? It is the best that we can do at any moment that is
  required of us. A tree should grow. Water should run. A shoemaker should make
  shoes. A musician should make music. A teller of tales should tell them. Eyes
  are to see with. Ears are for hearing. Each man's own environment is his own
  universe, and he the master or the victim of it in exactly the degree by
  which he governs or is governed by himself. Could you have patience with me,
  if I should tell a little&mdash;just a little of my own experience?"</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Ommony. "I'd rather hear it than find a fortune! Ears are
  to hear with!" he added, grinning, settling himself back into the chair to
  listen.</p>

  <p>"Some men listen to the wrong sound," said the Lama. "It is good to listen
  carefully, and to speak only after much thought. I will not tell more than is
  required to make a certain matter clear. Thereafter, you must use your own
  judgment, my son."</p>

  The Lama's Story</h2>

  <p class="quote">I have conversed with many priests; and some were honest
  men, and some were not, but three things none of them could answer: if their
  God is all-wise, what does it matter if men are foolish? And if they can
  imagine and define their God, must he not be smaller than their own
  imaginations? Furthermore, if their God is omnipotent, why does he need
  priests and ritual?<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">"I AM a Ringding, of the order of Gelong Lamas. That is
  neither a high rank nor a low one; but high enough to provide the outer forms
  of dignity, and low enough to avoid the snares of pride. I have ever found
  contentment in the Middle Way. I was born in Lhasa," Tsiang Samdup began, and
  then paused and got down on the rug, where he could sit cross-legged and be
  comfortable. Diana went and laid her great head on his knee.</p>

  <p>"Just a minute," said Ommony. "How old are you?"</p>

  <p>But Tsiang Samdup smiled. "My son," he answered, "we live as long as we
  are useful, and as long as it is good for us to live. Thereafter we die,
  which is another form of living, even as ice and water and rain and dew are
  the same thing in different aspects. When the appointed time comes, we
  return, as the rain returns, to the earth it has left for a season. As I told
  you, I was born in Lhasa." He rubbed the dog's head as if he were erasing
  unnecessary details from the tablets of memory. Then he laid a stick of
  pine-wood on the fire deliberately, and watched it burn. It was several
  minutes before he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"The Dalai Lama is a person who is mocked by Western thinkers. The few
  Europeans who have been to Lhasa have hastened to write books about him, in
  which they declare he is the ignorant head of a grossly superstitious
  religion. To which I have nothing to say, except this: that it is evident the
  writers of those books have been unable to expose the Dalai Lama's secrets.
  An army which invaded Lhasa failed to expose them with its bayonets. I, who
  took the highest possible degrees at Oxford and have lived in Paris, in
  Vienna, and in Rome&mdash;so that I know at least something of the western
  culture&mdash;regard the Dalai Lama with respect, which is different, my son,
  from superstitious awe. The Tashi Lama, who does not live in Lhasa, is as
  high above the Dalai Lama as a principle is higher than a consequence.</p>

  <p>"There was a Tashi Lama who selected me, for reasons of his own, for
  certain duties. I was very young then&mdash;conscious of the host of lower
  impulses and far from the self-knowledge that discriminates between the
  higher and the lower. To me in those days my desire was law, and I had not
  yet learned to desire the Middle Way, which leads between the dangers of
  ambition and inertia."</p>

  <p>Tsiang Samdup paused again and stared out of the window at an eagle which
  soared higher and higher on motionless wings, adjusting its balance
  accurately to the flukes of wind.</p>

  <p>"We learn by experience," he went on after a while. "Few of us remember
  former lives and those who say they do are for the most part liars, although
  there are some who are deceived by imagination. But the experience of former
  lives is in our favor&mdash;or against us, as the case may be. Its total is
  what some call instinct, others intuition; but there is a right name for it,
  and there are those whose past experience equips them with ability to
  recognize that stage in others at which the higher nature begins to overwhelm
  the lower. They are able to assist the process. But such men are exceedingly
  rare, though there are hosts of fools and rogues who pretend to the gift,
  which comes not by desire but by experience endured in many lives.</p>

  <p>"That Tashi Lama said to me: 'My son, it may amuse you to linger for a few
  lives on the lower path; for you are strong, and the senses riot in you; and
  it is not my duty to impose on you one course of conduct, if you prefer
  another. It is very difficult to rise against the will, but very easy if the
  will directs.' And I, because I loved him, answered I would do his bidding.
  But he said: 'Nay. Each man must, each minute, make his destiny. It is your
  own will, not mine, that directs you. Shall I fight your will, and force you
  to attempt the better way? Not so; because in that case you would surely
  fall, for which I should be responsible. But I perceive that the time has
  come when you may choose, and that your will is strong enough to make the
  choice and hold to it. You may be a benefactor or a beneficiary&mdash;a man,
  aware of manhood, or a victim of the lower senses, bound to the wheel of
  necessity. Which shall it be?'&mdash;And because he had discerned, and had
  chosen the right moment, there was a surging of the spirit in me, and as it
  were an awakening.</p>

  <p>"I said to him: 'I have chosen.' And he asked me 'Which way?' To which I
  answered at once: 'The higher.' Whereat he laughed; for I do not doubt that
  he saw the pride and the ambition that were cloaked within the answer.</p>

  <p>"Thereafter he considered me for a long time before he spoke. And when I
  had waited so long that I supposed he would say no more at all, he said this:
  'They who take the higher way in the beginning are consumed with arrogance;
  they mortify the flesh and magnify the will until there is no balance left;
  and when, after their period of death, they are born again, it is into a
  feeble body possessed by a demon will that tortures it; even as they who
  choose the lower way are reborn into brutal bodies with feeble wills.'</p>

  <p>"Whereat I asked him: 'How then shall I choose between the higher and the
  lower, since both are evil?' And he considered me again, a long time.</p>

  <p>"At last he said this: 'There is the Middle Way; but there are few who
  find it, and yet fewer who persist in it, because pride tempts one way and
  sloth the other.'</p>

  <p>"And I said: 'I have chosen.' And he said: 'Speak.' And I said: 'Let it be
  the Middle Way.' Whereat he did not laugh, but considered me again for many
  minutes; and at the end of it, he said: 'My son, you have much strength. If
  you persist and keep the Middle Way, you have a destiny and you shall not die
  until you have fulfilled it. But beware of pride; and above all, seek no
  knowledge for your own sake.'</p>

  <p>"At that time he said no more, but I became his chela. I washed his feet,
  and I swept the floor of his chamber, which was less than this one and less
  comfortably furnished. He taught me many things, but mainly patience, of
  which I lacked more in those days than a snake lacks legs. I supposed that
  before his time should come to die he would prefer me to high office. But
  nay. On a certain day he sent for me and said: 'I shall die on the eleventh
  day from now, at noon. Tomorrow at dawn take the road into India, and go to
  Delhi, to a certain house in a certain street, and there learn the tongue of
  the English. Thence, I having made provision for it, journey to England, to a
  University called Oxford; and there learn all that the University can teach
  &mdash;and particularly all they think they know about philosophy and
  religion.'</p>

  <p>"I said to him: 'Why?' And he said: 'I know not why; but I tell you what I
  know it is good for you to do. There is a destiny which, if you fail not, you
  shall fulfill. But beware of the Western knowledge, which is corrupt and
  strained through the sieve of convenience. I do not know, but it may be that
  you must learn the Western teachings for another's sake. Who can teach a
  horse unless he understands the way of horses? Who can make a sword unless he
  understands the qualities of steel?'</p>

  <p>"And I said to him, 'Shall I be a swordsmith?' But he answered: 'Nay. I
  said you have a destiny to fulfill.' So I asked, 'When?' But he said, 'I know
  not. However, I know this: if you seek your own advancement, you will fail.
  And there is a certain condition in you that will inevitably bring you to a
  death by violence, because of lies that you yourself will tell; but because
  of your strength that may not come to pass until your work is finished.'</p>

  <p>"So I said to him, 'How shall I know what my work is?' And he answered,
  'That will appear.' But I said, 'If you, my great and very holy master, are
  to die, who then shall show me how to fulfill this destiny?' And he answered:
  'It is for you to become fit to be the tool of destiny, and to hold yourself
  at all times ready. There are those from whom, at the proper time, you may
  receive the right advice.' So I asked: 'How shall I find them?' And he
  answered: 'They will find you.'</p>

  <p>"Thereafter I besought him earnestly that I might remain with him in Lhasa
  until his death, because I was his chela, and that is no commonplace
  relationship. Its roots lie deeper than the roots of trees. But he answered
  'The first duty of a chela is obedience.'"</p>

  <p>Tsiang Samdup paused and stared through the open window at the sky for
  several minutes. Eyes and sky were so exactly the same color that it looked
  as if the substance of the sky had crept within him and appeared through
  slits amid the walnut wrinkles of his face.</p>

  <p>"It was midwinter," he said after a while, "and no light task to cross the
  passes. But the route the Tashi Lama gave me was this way, through the Ahbor
  Valley, and I lay for a month in this monastery, recovering from frost-bite
  and exhaustion. And as I lay between life and death, one came to me who had a
  pilgrim's staff, and no outward appearance of greatness, who considered me in
  silence for a long while; but the silence appeared to me like the voice of
  the universe, full of music, yet without sound. He went away. But in three
  days' time, when I was already far recovered (for I was ever strong), he
  returned and led me to what I will show you tonight and tomorrow. And I saw
  myself within myself."</p>

  <p>He paused again, and again the far-away look in his eyes searched the sky
  and seemed to blend with it:</p>

  <p>"He carried me forth," he said presently, "I lying like a dead man in his
  arms. His voice in my ear was as a mother's speaking to a child. 'It is
  well,' said he. 'Now set forth on your journey, and remember. For you know
  now what you have to overcome, and also what is yours wherewith to
  overcome.'</p>

  <p>"So after certain days I set forth, and in due time I came to Delhi, where
  I studied English. Thereafter I went to England."</p>

  <p>The wrinkles moved in silent laughter, and the old eyes twinkled
  reminiscently as they looked into Ommony's.</p>

  <p>"My son, that was no light experience! It was warfare, and myself the
  battle-field. Warfare, and loneliness. Curiosity, contempt,&mdash;courtesy,
  discourtesy, indifference&mdash;all these were shown toward me. And there
  were very generous men at Oxford, whose pride was racial, not intellectual,
  who were as patient in the teaching as the sun is patient to the growing
  grass&mdash;most worthy and laughter-loving men, mistaken in much, but as
  sure of the reward of generosity as there is surely good will in their
  hearts. They did not know I was Tibetan; they believed I was Chinese, because
  I speak and write that language, and none knew anything about Tibet.</p>

  <p>"I came to understand that the cycles of evolution are moving westward,
  and that the West is arrogant with the strength it feels within itself. I
  saw, my son, that the West is deceived by the glitter of results, knowing
  nothing of causes, and that the East is in turn deceived by the wealth and
  ostentation of the West&mdash;for this is Kali Yuga,* when delusion and a
  blindness overspreads the world. I knew&mdash;for none had better right to
  know&mdash;that strength can be guided into the grooves of destiny, and that
  knowledge is the key. But I perceived that great harm can be done by
  interference. There is danger in another's duty. Also I saw that my voice,
  however reasonably raised, could accomplish nothing, because of the racial
  prejudice. The West is curious about the East, but proud&mdash;contemptuous
  &mdash;and most cruel when it most believes it is benevolent. The West sends
  missionaries to the East, who teach the very culture that is poisoning the
  life-springs of the West itself. The strength of the West and its generous
  impulse must be guided. Its rapacity must be restrained. But it was clear to
  me that I could not accomplish that, since none would listen to me. The few
  who pretended to listen merely sought to use my teaching for their own
  enrichment and advantage."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Kali Yuga</i>&mdash;the Age of Darkness]</p>

  <p>"I met a certain one in London. He appeared to be English, but that meant
  nothing. He had the Ancient Wisdom in his eyes. I had taken my degrees at
  Oxford then, and I was sitting in the Stranger's Gallery of the House of
  Parliament. I remember I grieved; for I saw how eager those debaters were to
  rule the whole world wisely&mdash;yet how ignorant they were of the very
  rudiments of what could possibly enable them to do it. I said to him who was
  in the corner next to me: 'These men boast of what is right, and they believe
  their words; but they do not know what is right. Who shall save them?' And he
  answered, after he had considered me a while in silence 'If you know what is
  right, you will attend to your own duty.'</p>

  <p>"So I went and lived in Paris for a while, and in Vienna and in Rome,
  because it was my duty to learn how the West thinks, and in what way it is
  self-deceived. And thereafter I returned to Tibet, wondering. It did not seem
  to me that I was one step forward on the path of destiny. I could see (for I
  had walked the length of India with pilgrim's staff and begging bowl) that
  the West was devouring the East and the East was inert in the grip of
  superstition, inclined, if it should move at all, to imitate the West and to
  corrupt the Western energy by specious flattery, hating its conquerors, yet
  copying those very methods that made conquest possible.</p>

  <p>"An unfathomable sadness overwhelmed me. It appeared to me that all my
  knowledge was as nothing. I doubted the stars in the sky; I said 'These, too,
  are a delusion of the senses. Who shall prove to me that I am not deceived in
  all things?'"</p>

  <p>Tsiang Samdup paused and thought a while, stroking Diana's head.</p>

  <p>"My son," he said presently, "it was as if the knowledge that was born
  within me, and all the false Western doctrine I had studied, were as waters
  meeting in the basin of my mind, and in the whirlpool my faith was drowning.
  It is ever so when truth meets untruth, but I did not know that then.</p>

  <p>"I went to the Tashi Lama&mdash;the successor of my teacher. He was but a
  child, and I was ashamed to lay my heart before him, though I laid my
  forehead on the mat before his throne, for the sake of the traditions and my
  master's memory. And to me, as I left the throne-room sadly, one of the
  regents, drawing me aside said: 'I have heard a destiny awaits you.' I asked:
  'From whom have you heard that?' But he did not say. To him I laid bare the
  affliction that was eating out my heart; and to me he said: 'Good. This is a
  time of conquest of self by the Self; I foresee that the higher will win.'
  Thereafter he spoke of the folly of stirring molten metal with a wooden
  spoon. He bade me let my thoughts alone. And because he saw in me a pride of
  knowledge that was at the root of my affliction, he appointed me a temple
  neophyte. He who was set over me had orders to impose severe tasks. I hewed
  wood. I carried water. I laid heavy masonry, toiling from sunrise until dark.
  I labored in the monastery kitchen. I dug gold on the plateau, where for nine
  months of every year the earth is frozen so hard that a strong man can with
  difficulty dig two baskets-full. By day I toiled. By night I dreamed dreams
  &mdash;grand dreams full of quiet understanding&mdash;so that to me it seemed
  that the night was life, and the day death. I was well contented to remain
  there in the gold-fields, because it seemed to me I had found my destiny; the
  miners were well pleased to listen to me in the intervals when we leaned on
  the tools and rested, and when the blizzards blew and we were herded very
  close together for the warmth, with the animals between us in the tents.</p>

  <p>"But when the Tashi Lama, who succeeded him whose chela I had been, came
  to man's estate he sent for me. And after he had talked with me a while on
  many matters he promoted me. I became a Lama of the lowest rank, and yet
  without the ordinary duties of a Lama. I had time to study and arrange the
  ancient books; of which, my son, there are more than the West imagines; they
  are older than the West believes the world to be, and they are written in a
  language that extremely few can read. But I can read them. And I learned that
  my dreams were realities&mdash;although the dreams ceased in those days.</p>

  <p>"Once, that one who had come to me when I lay sick in this place on my
  journey southward, came to me in Lhasa, where I was pondering the ancient
  books and rearranging them. And to him I said, 'Lo, I have met my destiny! I
  see that it is possible to translate some of these into the Western tongues.'
  But he answered: 'Who would believe? For this is Kali Yuga. Men think that
  nothing is true unless they can turn it into money and devour what they can
  purchase with it. If you give too much food to a starving horse, will he
  thrive? Or will he gorge himself to death?'</p>

  <p>"Said I; 'Light travels fast.' Said he; 'It does. But it requires a
  hundred million years for the light of certain stars to reach the earth. And
  how long does it take for the formation of coal, that men burn in a minute?
  Make no haste, or they will burn thee! They have Plato and Pythagoras and
  Appolonius&mdash;Jesus, the Buddha, Mohammed&mdash;and others. Would you give
  them a new creed to go to war about, or a new curiosity to buy and sell for
  their museums? Which?'</p>

  <p>"Thereafter the Tashi Lama sent for me, and I was given no more time to
  study the ancient books. But I was promoted to the rank of Gelong, and became
  a Ringding, whose duty was to teach the people as much as they could
  understand. I discovered it was not much that they could understand. They
  knew the meaning of desire, and of the bellyache that comes from too much
  eating. I found that if one man learns more than another, he is soon so
  filled with pride that he had better have been left in ignorance; and I also
  found that men will accept any doctrine that flatters their desires or
  excuses ignorance, but that they seek to vilify and kill whoever teaches them
  to discipline the senses in order that their higher nature may appear and
  make them wise. There is no difference in that respect, although men are fond
  of saying that the West is quite unlike the East. East or West they will
  murder anyone who teaches them to think except in terms of the lower
  self.</p>

  <p>"There was an outcry against me in Lhasa, and there were many Lamas who
  declared I should be put on trial for heresy. I was stoned in the streets;
  and the great dogs that devour the dead were incited to attack me. So I said:
  'Lo, it may be then I have fulfilled my destiny. For he who was my teacher
  prophesied that there is that in me which must inevitably bring me to a
  violent end. Nevertheless, I have told no lies yet, that I know of!'</p>

  <p>"But the Dalai Lama sent men&mdash;they were soldiers&mdash;who, under
  pretense of throwing me in prison, hid me in a certain place. And escaping
  thence by night, with one to guide me, I went on a journey of many days, to a
  village where none knew me, where I dwelt safely; so that I thought that my
  teacher had prophesied falsely, and for a while again I doubted.</p>

  <p>"But there came to me that same one who had come when I lay sick in this
  place on my journey southward, and he said to me; 'Have you learned yet that
  the stars and the seasons keep their course and the appointed times, and that
  no seed grows until the earth is ready?' And I said: 'How shall I know when
  it is ready? And who shall tell me the appointed time?' For I was full of a
  great yearning to be useful. But he answered: 'Who rules the stars? Until you
  can control yourself, how shall you serve others?' But I was burning with
  desire to serve, and moreover indignant at persecution, for in those days I
  had very little wisdom. I was a fool who puts his face into a hornets' nest
  to tell the hornets of the Higher Law. And I said to him: 'I am beginning to
  doubt all things.' 'Nay,' said he, 'for you began that once before, and made
  an end of it. You are beginning now to doubt your own impetuosity, and that
  is good, for you will learn that power lies in patience. He who will play in
  the symphony awaits the exact moment before he strikes his note. You forget
  that the world existed many million years, and that you lived many scores of
  lives, before you came to this pass. Will you sow seed in midwinter because
  it wearies you to wait until the spring?'</p>

  <p>"And when he had considered me again for a long while, he went away,
  saying that he would doubtless speak with me again, should the necessity
  arise. And before many days there came a message from Lhasa, saying that one
  was dead who had charge of this monastery in the Ahbor Valley, and that the
  Dalai Lama had appointed me to take his place.</p>

  <p>"So hither I came, and was at peace. And many years, my son, I lived here
  studying the ancient mysteries, considering the stars, and not seldom
  wondering what service to the world my destiny might hold in store. I made
  ready. I held myself ready."</p>

     id="ch30">CHAPTER XXX.</a><br>
  The Lama's Story (Continued)</h2>

  <p class="quote">And I have asked this of the priests, but though they
  answered with a multitude of words, their words were emptiness: If it is true
  that a priest can pacify and coax God, or by meditation can relieve another
  from the consequences of his own sin, why should anyone be troubled and why
  do the priests not put an end forever to all sin and suffering? If they can,
  and do not, they are criminals. If they cannot, but pretend that they can,
  they are liars. Nevertheless, there is a middle judgment, and it seems to me
  that some of them may be mistaken.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">A MONK brought food and set it on a stool between Tsiang
  Samdup and Ommony. They ate in silence&mdash;the monk watching&mdash;the Lama
  tossing scraps to Diana, his wrinkles rippling into a smile each time she
  caught a piece of meat in mid-air. Then, when the monk went away with the
  remnants, he resumed his story abruptly, before Ommony could start to
  question him.</p>

  <p>"My son, since the beginning of the world&mdash;and your brain cannot
  imagine how long ago that was&mdash;there has never been one minute when the
  knowledge that was in the beginning has been utterly forgotten. There have
  always been men who possessed and guarded the secrets; and there always will
  be such men. There is not a religion in the world that is not based on the
  tradition that such secrets do exist; there is not a philosophy that is not
  founded on the ancient mysteries; there is not a modern science, however
  perverted and material, that is not an effort to discover and to put to use
  some aspect of the ancient knowledge and the Higher Law.</p>

  <p>"There is a Law of Evolution. Scientists have touched the fringe of it,
  and what do they tell you in consequence? That man has evolved from the
  worms! There is a Law of Cause and Effect, of which one infinitely tiny
  fraction has been dimly sensed. To what use do they put it? They brew
  poison-gas, with which to murder one another! There is a Law of Cycles, as
  the astronomers can tell you, and as financiers begin vaguely to understand.
  But those who think they understand it use the secret to enrich themselves
  &mdash;by each enrichment of themselves afflicting others. Men dig in the
  ruins of Egypt and Babylon, but buy and sell the trophies and draw the absurd
  deduction that they know more than all the ancients did&mdash;even as worms
  digging in a carcass may imagine themselves superior to the life that once
  used that body for a while.</p>

  <p>"Do you begin to see, my son, why it would be unwise to reveal the ancient
  wisdom by more than infinitesimal fragments at a times? I heard, when I was
  in Delhi, that the men of the West are studying the construction of the atom,
  and have guessed at the force imprisoned in it. Wait until they have learned
  how to explode the atom, and then see what they will do to one another.</p>

  <p>"But you will notice this, as you grow wiser. There is a fitness in
  things. There is a balance in the universe and an intelligence that governs
  it. No man can escape the consequences of his own act, though it take him a
  million lives to redress the balance. Justice is inevitable. Evil produces
  evil, and is due to ignorance. But Justice being infinite in all its ways,
  there is a Middle Way by which we may escape from ignorance. I, who saw the
  world increasing its downward impetus, while it believes itself to be
  progressing upward through the invention of new means for exploiting
  selfishness; I, who saw the ruins of Egypt, and of Babylon; of Rome and
  Greece; of Jerusalem; of Ceylon; of India; I, who have lived for fifty years
  within a stone's throw of a city ten times older than Babylon; I knew that
  day follows night, and I waited for the dawn, not knowing the hour. I
  waited.</p>

  <p>"I knew there are those who have won merit in their former lives, whose
  time comes to be born again. I knew that the key to evolution is in
  character, not in numbers or material increase&mdash;in the character of the
  soul, my son! I knew that at the right time those would begin to be born,
  whose character would influence the world as mine could not. And I waited,
  studying the Jade of Ahbor.</p>

  <p>"For the Jade, my son, was set here in the dawn of time by men who
  understood how to make a mirror for the soul, even as men nowadays make
  mirrors that reflect stars which no eye can detect. You laugh? That is not
  wise! Men laughed, remember, at Galileo. They laughed at Newton. I had not
  thought you were one who mocks what is contrary to common superstition."</p>

  <p>"My father," said Ommony, "you are confirming rumors I have heard on and
  off for twenty years. I was laughing at the men who told me I was a fool to
  pay any attention to such madness."</p>

  <p>"Nor was that wise!" the Lama answered. "It is foolish either to laugh or
  to grieve over other men's ignorance; the hidden motive of that laughter or
  grief is pride, which blinds the faculties." He looked at Ommony a very long
  time in silence, studying him.</p>

  <p>"It is also unwise to speak of truths to men who prefer untruths," he said
  at last. "They proceed to indiscretions, for which the speaker is in part
  responsible. But I think, my son, you see the error of that way. The Jade of
  Ahbor is a mirror of the human soul. Whoever looks in it beholds his lower
  nature first; and there are few who can look long enough to see the first
  gleam of their higher nature shining through the horrors that the Jade
  reveals. When I first looked into the Jade, he who led me to behold it
  carried me forth like a dead man. And I had been the chela of the Tashi Lama!
  I will lead you to the Jade; but will you dare to look?"</p>

  <p>He paused, his bright old eyes observing Ommony's with that disturbing
  stare with which an artist studies the face of one whose portrait he is
  painting.</p>

  <p>"There was a time," he went on, "when those who professed to be teachers
  were stood before the Jade of Ahbor, that their own characters might be
  revealed to them. Those who could endure the test (and they were few) might
  teach; and those who failed, might not. For it is character that must be
  taught; all else depends on it. That time will come again, but not yet.
  Today, if men knew of the Jade of Ahbor they would seize upon it. They would
  test their rulers by it, as they try their criminals. They would overthrow
  whoever failed the test and all would fail. Thereafter intellectual men would
  seize power, who would destroy the stone, asserting its magic property was
  superstition, and that one fragment of the ancient knowledge would be
  lost.</p>

  <p>"And now," he paused again, "I read temptation in your mind. You think
  that I, who have enabled you to reach this valley, will enable you to leave
  it; and that is true, you shall return to India unharmed. But you think that
  you, and certain other men, might use that stone discreetly. Imagination
  tells you that to return to the Ahbor Valley; that to occupy it by force or
  trickery, and so to obtain access to the stone would be a good thing, which
  should benefit the human race. Nay, my son, waste no words on denial, for I
  saw the thought!</p>

  <p>"Therefore, I tell you this: the ancient wisdom is more wise than your
  imagination. They who know cause and effect can foretell consequences. Lest
  the evils should befall, that must inevitably follow if such an instrument
  were placed too soon into men's hands, the means to hide the stone, if
  necessary for another million years, has been placed in the hands of those
  who guard it. My son, men fight to the death over the Golden Rule. What would
  they not do with the Jade of Ahbor?</p>

  <p>"You have heard that the Tsang-po River holds more water than the
  Brahmaputra, which is the same river lower down? Part of the Tsang-po pours
  into caverns, which have an outlet below Bengal to the sea. One man (and
  there are more than one who know the secret) can in one moment admit a mighty
  river into caverns that are now dry. Then not an army of engineers could find
  the Jade of Ahbor in a thousand years.&mdash;But," he spoke very slowly, "he
  who had deliberately made that act necessary&mdash;having been warned, as you
  are warned&mdash;would be responsible. You cannot foresee the consequences,
  but it may be that in a million lives you cannot outlive them, because all
  the harm that, through you, befalls others must inevitably return to you for
  readjustment. It is well not to deceive yourself that this life is the
  last."</p>

  <p>Ommony had sat still, lest interruption break the thread of the Lama's
  story. But it appeared to be broken. His own personal relation to it stirred
  impatience.</p>

  <p>"How, where, when did my sister and Jack Terry die?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Bear with me, my son. I have a great deal to tell, and not much time in
  which to tell it. My hour comes soon. There is a death awaiting me, and I am
  nearly ready."</p>

  <p>The Lama closed his eyes, his right hand patting Diana's head, as if he
  were eliminating detail and remembering the thread.</p>

  <p>"I studied the Jade of Ahbor," he resumed after a long while. "Which is
  the same as to say that I studied my own failings and my own strength, using
  the one with which to conquer the other, so that light might flow into my
  mind. And many times that one came to me, of whom I spoke before&mdash;he who
  first led me to the Jade. Many times I journeyed into India. Many men I spoke
  with. And there came Marmaduke the American to Darjeeling, much wrought up
  about the future of the world and very angry with the Christian missionaries.
  And as you know, he founded the Marmaduke Mission at Tilgaun and endowed it.
  He wished me to be a trustee, but I refused, until that one came to me, of
  whom I spoke before, and said it was not good to refuse the work that destiny
  had given me to do. Then I accepted, although it did not appear to me then
  that my act was wise.</p>

  <p>"And you and Hannah Sanburn became the other trustees. And you and I
  corresponded, from which it became clear to me that you are a determined man,
  of good faith, having courage, but possessed by indignation against those
  whose vision of right and wrong is shorter than your own. And in indignation
  there is not much wisdom; so I avoided meeting you.</p>

  <p>"And then came Doctor Terry and your sister to this valley&mdash;
  children!&mdash;hand in hand&mdash;as innocent as lambs&mdash;as brave and
  simple as two humming-birds&mdash;in search of me, because, forsooth, they
  had been told I knew the secret of the Jade of Ahbor. She far-gone with
  child; he dying of wounds; the Ahbors hunting them&mdash;for the Ahbors guard
  this valley as cobras guard ancient ruins."</p>

  <p>"How did they get into the valley?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"None knows. Not even I, nor the Ahbors. They suffered; they had no
  memory, except of caverns and of being washed along an ancient conduit
  underground. I heard of them, because the Ahbors asked me whether it were
  best to crucify them living or to cut them up and throw them into the
  Brahmaputra. The Ahbors said they seemed such unoffending people that it
  might be the gods would be angry if they should put them to further pain.
  They also said there was a baby to be born, and it is against the Ahbors' law
  to slay the mother until one month after childbirth; nevertheless, it is also
  against their law to admit strangers and to let them live.</p>

  <p>"Therefore I lied to the Ahbors, inventing an ancient prophecy that a
  saint was to be born of strangers in this valley. Thus I rescued those two
  innocents, there being&mdash;as that Tashi Lama, whose chela I was, said
  &mdash;a condition in me, due to faults in former lives, that, though I may
  fulfill a useful destiny, I must come to a violent death through lies of my
  own telling.</p>

  <p>"I lied to the Ahbors, and I had to keep on lying to them. But he who lies
  does well, my son, who gladly eats the consequences when he may, and ends
  them. Better a little self-surrender now than unknown consequences in the
  lives to come! I am answerable to the Ahbors. I would rather receive their
  judgment than that of the Unseen! It pays not to postpone the reckoning.</p>

  <p>"The baby was born here, in this room, and those two children who were its
  parents died, though I did what might be done for them. I eased their death
  as well as I was able, giving them comfort in the knowledge that there are
  many lives to come, in which there is recompense forevery thought and deed,
  as also opportunity to undo all the evil of the past. They died in peace, and
  I buried their bodies yonder; you can see the grave below this window&mdash;
  that mass of rocks, over which the purple flowers trail.</p>

  <p>"Before she died, that child who was your sister gave her baby into my
  hands. It was her last effort. She gave the baby to me, not at my request. In
  the clarity of vision and the peace that precedes death, she gave her baby
  into my hands, smiling, saying: 'I see that this is as it should be. It could
  not have been otherwise.'"</p>

  <p>For five minutes the Lama was silent, remembering, his sky-blue eyes on
  vacancy, his wrinkles motionless. "And so I understood my destiny," he went
  on presently. "I understood that in my hands lay one who was greater than
  myself&mdash;whom I might serve, that she might serve the world, as I cannot
  by reason of my limitations. That little spark of life, if I should do my
  duty, should be fanned into a flame, whose light should blaze across the
  world, and bless, and brighten it.</p>

  <p>"And I have served, my son. I know of no regrets. Day in, day out, for
  more than twenty years I have fanned that flame, and nursed and fed it,
  letting no consideration hinder, omitting no experience that might serve,
  sparing her no duty, killing out my own pride, and my own weakness, lest it
  rob her of one element of virtue, inflicting no punishment (for who am I that
  I should dare to punish?), omitting no reproof (for who am I that I should
  dare to let the child deceive herself?)</p>

  <p>"I obtained a wet-nurse, who was doubtless born into this valley to that
  very end, the wife of an Ahbor chieftain, whose recent ancestors were
  healthy, whose mind was modest, unassuming, calm. I made that wet-nurse stand
  before the Jade of Ahbor, before I trusted the flow from her breasts.</p>

  <p>"And I received advice, as he whose chela I had been prophesied. He, who
  had come to me in this place and in Lhasa, came again. From him I learned
  that Hannah Sanburn might be trusted, and that if I should see fit to trust
  her no harm would come of it. I think she has told you, my son, what share
  she had in mothering the child."</p>

  <p>Ommony nodded. "Hannah is a noble woman," he said gruffly. "I imagine she
  sacrificed more than&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the Lama interrupted with a gesture of his hand. "My son, there is no
  such thing as sacrifice, except in the imagination. There is opportunity to
  serve, and he who overlooks it robs himself. Would you call the sun's light
  sacrifice? But you are right when you say Hannah Sanburn is a noble woman.
  Her nobility is part of her. It works. It overcomes the fear of what the
  world might say. It conquers pride. It leaves adjustment of all consequences
  to the Higher Law. It keeps faith. It knows no malice. It is brave. My
  burden, when I took that child to Tilgaun, was all that I could bear, because
  I loved her and I feared for her: but Hannah Sanburn's was no less&mdash;no
  atom less&mdash;when she returned the child to me.</p>

  <p>"My hardest task has been to provide children of her own age, with whom
  she might play and be happy without besmirchment from their ignorance. For,
  though she is able now to stand alone, and to burn up trash in the pure flame
  of her own character, she was then only a little, very clear flame, needing
  care&mdash;my son, I wonder if you guess how much care she has needed. The
  Tibetan children would have dimmed her light. They might have smothered it;
  because the lower yearns toward the higher. And though yeast is plunged into
  the dough and leavens it, the yeast is spent. It is not good to clean
  corruption with a golden broom, nor is it wise to take sap from the growing
  tree.</p>

  <p>"But I have agents&mdash;agents here and there. We, who pursue the Middle
  Way, are not without resources. There was Benjamin, who is a man of very
  faithful pertinacity in some respects; and there are certain others, whom I
  employed. It is easy to find children who need saving from the rapacity of
  the world's convenience; but it is very difficult to make
  selection&mdash;much more difficult when agents do the choosing&mdash;and
  impossible, my son, to find such another child as San-fun-ho, because there
  is none like her in the world. I tell you, great ones are not born many at a
  time.</p>

  <p>"I obtained children. I obtained many children, hoping that among the many
  one or two might excel, as indeed it happened. The others are incapable in
  this life of much advancement, because of karma and the circumstances into
  which they had been born. It is very difficult to help some individuals,
  because those who are born into an heredity are so born in order that they
  may make that experience, and battle with it, and acquire strength for the
  lives to come. But they have served; they have done royal service. For, as I
  have educated my chela, in turn she has educated them, learning through them
  how to practice the wisdom, which is nothing unless put to use. And, lest
  they lose one rightful opportunity, I found Tibetan girls for them to teach.
  You have seen for yourself that those children have grown into women, who are
  not without nobility. Some may make good teachers at Tilgaun."</p>

  <p>"How many laws did you break in obtaining those children!" asked Ommony,
  smiling. He felt less critical than curious to know how the Lama would defend
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Many, perhaps. I do not know, my son. There is that which, because of
  errors in past lives, makes it impossible for me to do good without
  inflicting evil on myself. But it is better to do good than to fear evil. It
  is he who breaks the laws who must accept the consequences. It appears to me
  that I have injured none except myself and, although I must meet in lives to
  come the consequence of having broken even human laws, I do not doubt that
  the service I have rendered will provide me strength with which to meet and
  overcome the karma. We cannot do all the self-cleansing in one life. It is
  enough that we do what we can, and serve others."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry I spoke. I beg your pardon."</p>

  <p>The Lama looked keenly at Ommony. "My son, it is not within your power to
  offend me, even if you had the wish to give offense, which I perceive is not
  so. I would not impose on you an account of my fumblings with duty, if it
  were not that you are entitled to sufficient facts on which to base your
  judgment of what your duty may be. I endeavor to be brief.</p>

  <p>"Life&mdash;right living is Art, my son, not artifice, and not an
  accumulation of possessions, or of power, but a giving forth of inner
  qualities. San-fun-ho has had encouragement to exercise herself in all the
  arts; she will not be deceived by the many who will deny the merit of her art
  &mdash;no more than the lamp's flame is deceived by darkness.</p>

  <p>"Above all, drama! Drama is the way to teach. All life is drama; and by
  allegories, parables and illustrations men learn easily what no amount of
  argument will drive into their understanding. Because of sympathy, compassion
  and a knowledge of what difficulties and what ignorance the greatest and the
  least most face, my chela can play all parts. She understands. She knows the
  difference between the higher and the lower, and is not to be deceived by
  noise, or fear, or any man's opinion.</p>

  <p>"Nor can her head be turned by flattery; for I have let men tempt her in
  the subtlest ways, they not knowing that they tempted. The superstitious
  worship those whose art excels their own&mdash;until the time comes when they
  meditate murder, and slander, (which is more cruel than murder) because they
  grow weary of emulation. And worship is the most poisonous of all corruption,
  to him who is the object of it. When an Ahbor, who was bribed by some
  ambitious men, broke away and stole a fragment of the Jade of Ahbor, and I
  learned that there were plans on foot to seduce men into all kinds of
  superstition with its aid, I seized that opportunity.</p>

  <p>"I let word go forth through secret channels into India that she who is
  the rightful priestess of the Jade will come and find it. For there was never
  a doubt about that, my son. I knew I could trace the fragment and lay my hand
  on it. I seized that opportunity. I led my chela, clothed as a boy, for she
  can play all parts, on a journey into India, as you know. And, my son, I have
  made many errors in my day; I am but an old man seeking, through the cloud of
  ignorance, to do my duty, knowing what the duty is, but often misled by my
  own unwisdom. There were times, while my chela was growing, when I dreamed of
  triumphs for her among India's millions. In those deluded moods it had
  appeared to me&mdash;although none had better right than I to know the
  contrary&mdash;that if she should seize on the imagination of the East, which
  might very easily be done, the East would rise out of its ignorance and teach
  the West. I did not see, in those deluded hours, that the East would become
  filled with a self-righteousness that would be even worse, if that were
  possible, than what consumes the West and, seeking to throw off its
  conquerors, would plunge the whole world into war. You have heard of Gandhi?
  That is a man of singleness and merit, seeking, as it were, to hasten the
  precession of the equinox.</p>

  <p>"Even as Gandhi has made mistakes, I made them, though with less excuse.
  During the lonely months when San-fun-ho was with Hannah Sanburn at Tilgaun I
  used to journey into India with staff and begging-bowl, making my
  preparations for the day when San-fun-ho should teach an awakening multitude.
  Unwise&mdash;and the unwisdom multiplied by zeal! I raised too many
  expectations.</p>

  <p>"He, who had come to me before, came once again rebuking me. I told him of
  this and that which I had done, expecting praise. He said to me: 'Blood will
  flow. It will be you to whom the dead may look for recompense. How soon can
  you repay them all?' And I said: 'But I have promised. If I fail, will they
  not look to me for the fulfillment?' But he said: 'Which is better? To fail
  to do evil, and to eat the fruit of disappointment; or to do great evil, and
  to interfere with destiny, and then to eat the fruit of that? I tell you,
  San-fun-ho will light a flame too fierce for India; but in the West she may
  do some good; and the East may imitate the West, but the West will not
  imitate the East for many a year to come, being too proud and too full of
  energy.'</p>

  <p>"And then I asked him: 'Who shall shield her in the West? Lo, I have made
  these friends for her in India, that she may have a foundation to begin with
  when the time comes.' To which he answered: 'Is a dollar without friends? And
  is she less than a dollar? Moreover, there will come to you a man of her own
  race, who can serve her better than you when his turn comes. He will know
  less, but he will have the qualities she needs. Be on the watch for him, and
  when you think you have found him, put him to many tests.'</p>

  <p>"So, as I told you, I took my chela into India, recovering the piece of
  jade, and making use of my mistakes for the testing of San-fun-ho, since even
  a man's mistakes are useful, if he has the will to conquer false pride. And
  you have seen, my son, that my chela's head was not turned, even though we
  traveled with great evidence of secret influence, which is a very subtle
  agent of corruption. You have seen how women broke the rules of caste to
  approach her; how men of high position trembled in her presence; how the
  crowd shouted to see more of her; how her voice stilled anger and turned
  violence into peace. Yet she was always my patient and obedient chela, was
  she not? And you shall see&mdash;at dawn tomorrow you shall see whether all
  that glamour of success has or has not dimmed her character by as much as the
  mist of a man's breath on a mirror."</p>

  <p>The Lama looked at Ommony for a long time, repeatedly almost closing his
  eyes and then opening them suddenly, as if to catch some fleeting expression
  unawares.</p>

  <p>"And when you came, my son, hiding in Chutter Chand's shop. When I knew
  the piece of the jade had reached your hands. When Benjamin sent word that
  you were spying on me. Then, it seemed to me that in spite of many faults you
  might be the man whom I must test. I have tested you in more ways than you
  guess, and I have seen all your faults, not least of which is a certain pride
  of righteousness. But San-fun-ho knows how to deal with that. Now think.
  Answer without self-seeking and without fear, truly. For I offer you my
  place, as San-fun-ho's protector and servant, to guard her that she may serve
  the world. My time has come to die."</p>

  The Jade of Ahbor</h2>

  <p class="quote">A man is what he is. He starts from where he is. He may
  progress, or he may retrogress. All effort in his own behalf is dead weight
  in the scale against him. All effort in behalf of others is a profit to
  himself; notwithstanding which, unless he first improve himself he can do
  nothing except harm to others. There is no power in the universe, nor any
  form of intercession that can separate a cause from its effect, action from
  reaction, or a man from retribution for his deeds.<br>
  &mdash;from <i>The Book of the Sayings of Tsiang Samdup</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">OMMONY sat still. Diana growled and chased some creature of
  imagination in her dreams. The Lama threw wood on the fire, and watched it as
  if he were much more interested in the outcome of that than in what answer
  Ommony might make.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think I could do it?" Ommony asked, half stunned by the
  suggestion, vaguely and uncomfortably conscious that he was being invited to
  make himself the butt of half a world's ridicule, if of nothing worse.</p>

  <p>"A flea&mdash;a mouse&mdash;a drop of water&mdash;a piece of wood
  &mdash;can do its duty," said the Lama. "Is a man less!"</p>

  <p>"I will do mine," said Ommony, "if I can see it. But good God, man&mdash;
  how can I take your place?"</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;and they&mdash;can go to India very easily, my son, without
  you. They are all provided for. They will never lack for money. It may be you
  are not the right man to be my chela's friend and in that case it is better
  for you, and for her, and for the world that you accept no burden you cannot
  bear.</p>

  <p>"Do not deceive yourself, my son. There will be no personal ease, no
  basking in the stupefying rays of flattery. You will be accused of all the
  evil motives that lurk in the minds of your accusers. Lecherous men will
  accuse you of lying when you say she is your niece; and you cannot prove the
  relationship. Thieves will accuse you of theft. Ambitious men will denounce
  your ambition. Traitors will accuse you of treachery toward the human race.
  Bigots will charge you with unpatriotic scheming. Men of outwardly
  unblemished aspect, but whose secret thoughts are viler than the froth of
  cesspools, will accuse you of secretly immoral practices. They will leave you
  not a shred of reputation. They will try to impoverish you; they will try to
  prove you insane; they will try to put you in prison."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Ommony. "I will do my best." He nodded, thrusting his
  stubborn jaw forward. The Lama could have said nothing better calculated to
  persuade him.</p>

  <p>"And you will find," the Lama went on, nodding back at him, "here and
  there are men and women, who will accept what San-fun-ho can teach. Some of
  those will be traitors, who will try to learn in order that they may set up
  themselves as teachers and accumulate money and fame. Those will be your most
  dangerous enemies. But some will be honest and steadfast, and they will
  encourage others; for the West is moving forward on a cycle of evolution; and
  moreover, it is growing very weary of its own creeds and politics and
  competition. It begins to be ready at last to put the horse before the cart,
  instead of the cart before the horse as hitherto. There is a great change
  coming&mdash;although this is Kali Yuga, and it is not wisdom to expect too
  much. The harvest takes care of itself&mdash;none knows how many generations
  hence. This is a time for the sowing of the seeds of thought on which a whole
  world's destiny depends. I have sown my handful. I can sow no more."</p>

  <p>"What makes you so sure you are going to die?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"The Ahbors, my son, will attend to it, for I have broken their law. I
  made them promises which I intend to break; I knew that I must, when I made
  the promises. There is that in me that blinded me to any other way out of the
  difficulty, and although I did my duty, that does not preserve me from the
  effects of wrong-doing. The Ahbors have their rights. This is their country.
  They protect this monastery and its secrets. They have protected me. Of my
  own free will I have availed myself of their protection and their law against
  admitting strangers. Do you remember Socrates, who broke the law of the
  Athenians, although he did his duty? He might have escaped after they
  condemned him, but he refused, although his friends insisted. And Socrates
  did well, my son; he had no right to avoid the consequences of his own acts;
  it was enough that he had told the Athenians some great truths, for he knew
  those truths, and it was the proper time to tell; if the Athenians had a law
  against telling the truth, that was their affair, not his. Socrates drank his
  poison, which was a simple little matter, and soon over with. Does it appear
  to you that the Athenians have even yet finished suffering from the injustice
  they inflicted?"</p>

  <p>"But the Athenians could think. These Ahbors are mere savages," said
  Ommony.</p>

  <p>"The Ahbors have their rights," the Lama answered. "They work out their
  own destiny. I work out mine. If I had been a wiser man, less blinded by my
  lower nature, I could have found a better way to save my chela than by
  deceiving the Ahbors. But I was blind, so I took the only way I could. When I
  return to earth again, I am convinced I shall be less blind; and at least I
  shall owe no debt to the Ahbors, for I will pay it now."</p>

  <p>"Why not leave all that to destiny?" Ommony objected.</p>

  <p>"My son, there is no other judge in whose hands I can leave it! But
  destiny judges a man's unwillingness to pay, as surely as it judges his
  mistakes&mdash;as surely as it rewards his hidden motives and his honesty.
  There is no thought hidden from the Higher Law, and no escape from rebirth,
  time and time again, until each individual learns wisdom by experience. The
  Ahbors will learn wisdom, some sooner than others; but they will not learn it
  by being deprived of opportunity to use their own judgment. If they choose to
  kill me, they must inevitably suffer; but I would rather they should kill me
  than that they should have killed that child, and for more than one reason.
  They can do very little harm by killing me; the wrong will not amount to
  much, because I bear no resentment. If they had killed her, they would have
  robbed the world."</p>

  <p>"You have your rights," Ommony objected. "You're worth more than the
  Ahbors."</p>

  <p>But the Lama's eyes twinkled humorously. "My son, you argue ignorantly,
  meaning well enough, but reckoning without the facts."</p>

  <p>"For instance?"</p>

  <p>"You would not understand. My course is necessary&mdash;never mind why, my
  son. It was entirely necessary for you to come to this place of your own free
  will; otherwise it would have been impossible for me to open your mind. I
  could have talked to you for ten years in India, and you would never have
  understood. But it was also necessary to provide for your admission to the
  valley, and for your safe return to India after I am dead. You were admitted
  because I told the Ahbors about your talking dog, and because I gave my own
  life as hostage, saying they might slay me if you should ever escape from the
  valley alive. I did that, knowing they would slay me in any event, when they
  should learn that San-fun-ho and the others have left the valley forever. You
  see, my son, it is necessary I should die, in order to consume as soon as
  possible the consequences of an untruth. As for the Ahbors; they are very
  ignorant, but faithful to their valley and their own law, generous toward
  this monastery: it is better that they should kill me, than that they should
  be faithless to their laws and to their trust. I will do all I can to
  minimize the consequences for them."</p>

  <p>A monk came in again with food, and once more the Lama amused himself by
  feeding Diana. "Make her do tricks," he insisted, and rewarded her with
  handfuls of food after each performance, he and the monk laughing as if it
  were the most interesting and amusing business in the world. The sun had gone
  down over the mountains and there was a gloom within the chamber that
  affected Ommony's nerves, for it seemed to foretell tragedy, but the Lama
  apparently had not a trouble on his mind. The moment the monk had gone Ommony
  began questioning:</p>

  <p>"Does Elsa&mdash;I mean, does San-fun-ho know anything about your
  plans?"</p>

  <p>"Enough, my son. A little. She understands she has a destiny. She
  understands she is to take you with her into India."</p>

  <p>The Lama rose to his feet, as if to avoid further conversation; but Ommony
  shot one more question at him:</p>

  <p>"Does she know you expect to be killed?"</p>

  <p>The Lama did not answer. His wrinkled face became expressionless.</p>

  <p>"Where is she now?" asked Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Come."</p>

  <p>The Lama led the way, in deepening gloom, along the wooden gallery that
  overhung the ravine, and through a door into the monastery, which appeared to
  be a patchwork nest of caves and buildings connected by passages hewn in the
  rock. Some of it appeared as old as time, but parts were medieval; some was
  almost modern. There was an air of economically conserved affluence and
  studied chastity of design&mdash;beauty everywhere, but less laid on than
  inherent in proportions and the almost exquisite restraint.</p>

  <p>Pictures were hung on the plastered corridor walls at widely spaced
  intervals, apparently all drawn by the same hand. The Lama stopped for a
  second in front of one of them, done in pastel on paper: a study of an eagle
  soaring, balancing himself to catch the uplift of the changing wind. It might
  have been done by a Chinaman a thousand years ago, it was so full of life,
  truth and movement and, above all, so superbly beautiful.</p>

  <p>"My chela!" he said, and smiled, and passed on.</p>

  <p>At one place, where the corridor turned at right angles and a lamp hung in
  chains from the ceiling, there was another pastel drawing, a portrait this
  one, of the Lama himself.</p>

  <p>"Wrinkles and all!" he said, chuckling.</p>

  <p>He stood beside Ommony and studied the portrait for more than a minute; it
  seemed to amuse him as much as it astonished Ommony, who caught his
  breath.</p>

  <p>"My God!" Ommony exclaimed. "That's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the Lama, chuckling. "That old person was my God once. It
  takes us long to learn. But San-fun-ho drew the picture, and I saw myself
  through the eyes of my chela, which are very interesting. Notice, my son, how
  affectionate she is, and yet how truthful. Not one hidden foolishness escapes
  her; and she sets it all down. Yet she is as gentle as the rain on dry
  hills."</p>

  <p>He passed on, opened a door, glanced in, and motioned Ommony to enter.</p>

  <p>"School-room!" he said, and chuckled again, as if remembering a chain of
  incidents.</p>

  <p>It looked about as much unlike a school-room as it would be easy to
  imagine. There was nobody in there, but it was lighted with kerosene lamps as
  if visitors were expected. Across the full width of the room at one end was a
  stage, provided with curtain, footlights, wings and painted scenery. There
  were comfortable seats and small, square, solid tables on the floor for
  twenty or thirty people; and there was a gallery, at the end opposite the
  stage, for twenty or thirty more. The place was scrupulously clean and
  tidy.</p>

  <p>"Life, my son, is drama. Why teach how to drug the mind, when the purpose
  of life is to render it alert and active? Shakespeare was right. You
  remember? 'All the world's a stage.' No learning is of any value unless we
  can translate it into action. Bad thoughts produce hideous action; right
  thinking produces grace and symmetry; and the audience is almost as important
  as the play. Let the child act the part of a villain, and it learns to strive
  to be a hero; let the hero's part be a reward for genuine effort, and lo!
  sincerity becomes the goal. There have been plays enacted here that would
  have thrilled Shakespeare to the marrow of his manhood. San-fun-ho wrote most
  of them."</p>

  <p>"Who were the audiences" asked Ommony. "Monks&mdash;Ahbors. The stupider
  the better. Let the actors strive to act so simply and sincerely that even
  monks and savages can understand. There have been plays acted on this stage
  that I think would have converted even Christian missionaries from the error
  of their own self-righteousness."</p>

  <p>He led the way out again along the corridor, and now he began to hurry,
  striding with the regular, long movements of a mountaineer. He had suddenly
  thrown off fifty years again, in one of those strange resurrections of youth
  that seemed to sweep over him at intervals. Ommony, with Diana at his heels,
  had all he could do to keep pace.</p>

  <p>However, there were pauses. He opened doors here and there along echoing
  corridors, giving Ommony a glimpse of rooms, each one of which had some
  connection with the beloved chela. There was a bedroom, as plain and almost
  as severely furnished as a monastery cell, only that every single item in it
  was as perfect as material and craftsmanship could contrive, and the
  proportions, the color, and something else that was indefinable, produced an
  atmosphere of unconditioned peace. There was nothing out of place, and no
  unnecessary object in the room. The walls were pale daffodil yellow; the
  Chinese rug was blue; the bed-spread was old-rose. There were flowers in a
  Ming vase on a small square table, but no other ornament.</p>

  <p>"These walls will not forget her," said the Lama. There was an agony
  within him, as his voice betrayed.</p>

  <p>He led the way along a corridor, opening doors of rooms where the chela's
  companions had slept, making no comment. Those other rooms were more ornate
  than the chela's and vaguely, indefinably less beautiful;&mdash;there was
  more furniture&mdash;less character but tidiness and cleanliness beyond
  belief.</p>

  <p>The monastery was honeycombed into a limestone mountain's heart. It was
  enormous. There was possibly accommodation for a thousand people, with
  perfect ventilation and no dampness, although how that was contrived did not
  appear. Nor was there any sign of its inhabitants, nor any sound, except the
  shuffling of Ommony's loose shoes and the solid thump of the Lama's bare feet
  as he strode with bowed head and the skirts of his long robe swinging.</p>

  <p>They descended a long, hewn stairway presently and emerged, through a door
  a foot thick that was carved on both sides with dragons, into the open air.
  The rush and roar of water pouring into hollow caverns greeted them. They
  were now on that side of the monastery that Ommony had first seen, with the
  terraced amphitheater below them, but it was too dark to peer into its
  depths. The stars blinked down above a rim of mountains. "There will be a
  full moon," said the Lama, a propos, apparently, of nothing.</p>

  <p>He led down into the dark amphitheater, by paths and steps that linked the
  circling terraces, and turned, midway, into a tunnel whose dark opening was
  like an ink-blot in the shadow of rocks and trees. Ten yards along the tunnel
  Ommony heard him fumbling with a lock; a door swung almost silently; the Lama
  took him by the hand and pulled him forward, closing the door but not locking
  it. Then, in such utter darkness that all the senses were almost swallowed by
  it and Diana whimpered, the Lama led, pauseless, holding Ommony's hand as if
  it were a child's. The old man's grip was like a swordsman's, as if his
  vanished youth, reborn for the moment, were burning him up. The strange
  thrill that was consuming him communicated itself to Ommony through the
  linked hands.</p>

  <p>At the end of an immeasurable distance&mdash;(there was no sense of time
  or space in that impenetrable darkness)&mdash;they emerged into gloom under
  an oval patch of starlit sky, on a ledge, an incalculable distance down the
  inside of a limestone pit&mdash;somber, irregularly circular, enormous. The
  Lama sat down on a mat that somebody had placed for him&mdash;signed
  &mdash;and Ommony sat down beside him, on the same mat.</p>

  <p>"Let the dog not wander away. Bid her lie here," he said, in a normal
  voice.</p>

  <p>As Ommony's eyes grew gradually used to the gloom he discerned that they
  were very near the bottom of the pit, whose almost perpendicular flanks rose
  so high that the stars appeared like bright dots on a dark-blue dome that
  rested on the summit. His own breathing seemed abominably noisy in the
  silence.</p>

  <p>In front of where they sat there was a sheer drop, but the bottom did not
  seem to be more than fifty feet below; and somewhere in the midst of the
  almost circular space into which he gazed there was an object, bulky, of no
  ascertainable shape, and apparently raised on a platform of rock so as to be
  almost on a level with the ledge on which they sat. Diana lay still,
  sniffing, one ear raised; there were humans not far away.</p>

  <p>Presently there was a sound below&mdash;apparently a footstep, and Diana
  growled at it. A lantern appeared, but it was impossible to tell whether the
  individual who carried it was man or woman. There were several more
  footsteps, and one word in a clear voice&mdash;instantly recognizable
  &mdash;the chela's. There began to be a prodigious phantom movement in the
  gloom. Something&mdash;a great black cloth apparently&mdash;was pulled by
  many hands and the shape of the object in the center changed. The
  lantern-light was reflected in a sea-green pinpoint that spread and increased
  as the moonlight spreads on water, but much more fiery, and full of weird
  movement. The lantern suddenly went out, but the peculiar green glow had made
  such an impression that with his eyes shut, Ommony could still see evolving,
  glowing green.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The Jade of Ahbor."</p>

  <p>The Lama's voice was solemn. He seemed almost to resent the question.
  However he went on speaking in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"That fragment, that was broken off and stolen by an Ahbor, has been set
  back, but there is none nowadays who knows how to heal the break. There is a
  blemish. Thus one ignorant fool can spoil the product of a thousand wise
  men's labor. But that Ahbor was no better and no worse than they who ruin
  reputations, to possess an hour's self-righteousness. Others who should know
  better, will try to break my chela's spirit when the time comes&mdash;some
  for their own amusement, some for profit, some because they hate the truth.
  But she is made of stronger stuff than stone."</p>

  <p>His self-control was not so perfect as it had been. The last few words
  were in a tone of voice that fought with overwhelming sadness.</p>

  <p>Ommony was about to ask a question when the Lama spoke again:</p>

  <p>"My son, remember this: the highest motive is of no avail without
  proportion and a sense of fitness; because these are the life of wisdom. Time
  is a delusion. All is the eternal Now. But in a world in which all is
  delusion, of which time is a controlling element, there is a proper time for
  all things. We cannot mount the camel that has passed us, nor the camel that
  has not yet come. Neither does the water that has gone by turn the
  mill-wheel. He who feels the force of destiny within him, waits, as birds
  wait for the sunrise&mdash;as the seed waits for the spring. It is not enough
  to do the right thing. If the full moon shines at midday, what does it
  accomplish? If the drum beats out of time, what happens to the symphony? To
  discern the right time, and to act precisely then, is as important as the
  knowledge how to act. But discernment does not come by reason of desire; it
  comes by observation of essential truths&mdash;as that the sun, the moon, the
  stars, the seasons and the tides keep their appointed path, and when they
  fail there is disaster. This is an appointed time. Mark well."</p>

  <p>The somber silence and the ragged flanks of the pit, that towered upward
  through a million shapeless shadows to the star-pierced oval summit, combined
  to inspire dread&mdash;but of what? Ommony could feel Diana trembling.</p>

  <p>The Lama spoke again after a long pause, as dispassionately as a big clock
  ticking in the dark&mdash;asserting measured, elemental facts.</p>

  <p>"Remember. Remember each word, my son. I speak with death not far from me.
  At dawn the Ahbors go to the northern end of the valley, by the Tsang-po
  Falls, to await my coming. At noon I meet them."</p>

  <p>He was silent for many minutes. Not until the silence had grown almost
  unendurable did he go on speaking. "Lest the Ahbors harm themselves by
  slaying more than me, who am responsible, I have sent into Tibet all but a
  few of my monastery people. At noon I will try to reach agreement with the
  Ahbors, that if they slay me, for having broken their law, they shall permit
  the others to return to the monastery, and a new Lama to be sent to hold
  authority. But as to the outcome of that I know nothing. It may be that the
  Jade must be hidden by the Tsang-po waters. There is a time for all things;
  it is not my province to know the time for that; there are others whose
  province it is."</p>

  <p>He stared into the dark in front of him. When he spoke again, at the end
  of five minutes, his voice sounded almost as if he had left his body and were
  speaking to it and to Ommony.</p>

  <p>"Remember every word. Those few, who have remained, are chosen men, who
  know the secret way. They will take you into India&mdash;you, San-fun-ho and
  all the European chelas to Tilgaun&mdash;the Tibetan chelas into Tibet by the
  route that leads through Sikkim, because they have a destiny that they can
  best fulfill in Tibet."</p>

  <p>Followed another tense silence, broken by the long-drawn howl of an animal
  somewhere on the ledges half a mile above them. It sounded lonelier than the
  wail of a forgotten soul.</p>

  <p>"I am not the guardian of Hannah Sanburn. Even as you and I, my son, she
  governs her own destiny. But she is good. No harm can come if she should
  leave Tilgaun, because she has done her work there, and it is another's turn.
  There is one who will take my place as trustee; he will present himself; I
  have written his appointment. There is one who will take her place; perhaps
  she is that one at whose house you were in Delhi; but that is Hannah
  Sanburn's business. There is one who will take your place; but that is your
  affair. No man is indispensable. He who clings to the performance of a duty
  when the work is done and another waits to carry evolution forward, is as the
  fungus on the living tree. He rots. The tree rots under him."</p>

  <p>Silence again. A wedge of silver, creeping down the western side of the
  pit, dispersed the shadows and threw great fangs of limestone into high
  relief; but that was very far above them. Where they sat it seemed darker
  than ever.</p>

  <p>"Remember every word, my son. I speak in the portal of death. I do not say
  that Hannah Sanburn shall go with you to the West. That may, or it may not
  be. I do say, tarry not in Tilgaun, because this is an appointed time. Three
  of the lesser chelas will go with San-fun-ho to the West. Let her select
  them. Let the others stay in Tilgaun, where as much awaits them as they have
  the character to do."</p>

  <p>The beast in the dark loneliness above them howled again. Ommony sat
  watching the forerunner of the moonlight chasing shadows down the pit-side
  &mdash;wondering. After nearly a quarter of a century in India he and Hannah
  Sanburn would be almost as much strangers in the West as San-fun-ho would
  be.</p>

  <p>"There is a fitness in all things and a time for all things," said the
  Lama, as if he had read Ommony's mind. "But a great faith is required, and a
  sincerity that like the temper of the steel turns faith into a ready weapon
  and impenetrable armor. Hannah Sanburn has nobility. It may be, she may help
  you to serve San-fun-ho. But beware, my son, of the snare of personality. If
  ye two seek to serve each other, ye are like the two sides of a triangle that
  has no base, nor any purpose. But if ye both serve San-fun-ho, and she the
  world, the triangle is perfect." He paused again, then slowly turned his head
  and looked into Ommony's eyes. His own were like blue jewels burning in the
  dark.</p>

  <p>"Without you," he said, "or without her, San-fun-ho will find others. She
  is my chela, and I know the power that is in her. But beware of being false!
  Better for you never to have been born! Better to die ten thousand deaths
  than to betray her through self-seeking! Let her alone, my son, unless you
  can follow all the way! Then, if she should lead you wrong, that will be her
  affair; in after lives you will have karma of sincerity, and she the fruit of
  false teaching&mdash;if she should teach falsely.&mdash;But I know my chela.
  She will lead upward, as an eagle, and all the enemies of light will spread
  their nets for her in vain!"</p>

  <p>As he ceased speaking the whole western wall of the gigantic pit became
  suffused in silver, as the moon's edge crossed the eastern rim. Wan, scrawny
  crags of limestone yearned like frozen ghosts toward the light. The pit's
  awful nakedness lay revealed, its outlines dimmed in shadow, as mysterious,
  as silent and as measureless as the emotion born of gazing.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, as the moon's disk appeared, there shone a green light in the
  midst of the pit&mdash;a light that swirled as if in moving water, and
  increased in size, as if it multiplied itself within the substance it had
  touched. It grew into a pool&mdash;a globe&mdash;a sphere&mdash;an ovoid mass
  of liquid green light, all in motion, transparent, huge-afloat, it seemed, in
  black precipitated silence, two, or perhaps three hundred feet away. Slowly,
  very slowly, it became apparent that the egg-shaped mass was resting on seven
  upright stones, of the same color as itself, that were set beneath it on a
  platform of dark rock that rose exactly in the middle of the pit.</p>

  <p>As the full moon floated into view the enormous mass of jade so caught the
  light that it seemed to absorb all of it. And suddenly a figure stood before
  the livid jade&mdash;a girl's; she was the Gretchen-girl, with whom Ommony
  had spoken on the night when he first saw San-fun-ho's companions on the
  stage. She was draped in white, but the stuff glowed green in the jade's
  reflection, and as she peered into the enormous stone she held the end of the
  loose drapery across the lower portion of her face, like a shield, with her
  elbow forward. She gazed for about a minute, and then disappeared. Another
  took her place.</p>

  <p>"It is only San-fun-ho who dares to look into the Jade for long," said the
  Lama solemnly. "It shows them all the horror of their lower selves. They look
  by moonlight. They must drape themselves, for they have much to overcome, and
  there is magic in the Jade. None but my chela&mdash;none but San-fun-ho
  &mdash;dares to face it in the full light of the sun."</p>

  <p>One by one the seventeen girls appeared, looked deep into the Jade, and
  vanished into darkness.</p>

  <p>"They are not bad," said the Lama. "Not bad, my son. There are not so many
  better women. Do you dare to look?"</p>

  <p>But Ommony sat still.</p>

  <p>"Better so," said the Lama. "In curiosity there is no wisdom. He who
  cannot look long enough to see his higher nature shining through the lower,
  had better have seen nothing."</p>

  <p>There commenced a chant, of women's voices, rising from the fathomless
  darkness below the Jade. It began by being low and almost melancholy, but
  changed suddenly into faster tempo and a rising theme of triumph, ending in a
  measured march of glory. There was no accompaniment, no drum-beat, but the
  final phrases pulsed with power, ending on a chord that left imagination
  soaring into upper realms of splendor. Then, in silence, as sublimely as the
  moon had sailed across the rim of the dark pit, the girls emerged out of the
  black night as if they had been projected by a magic lantern. No sound of
  footfall or of breathing reached across the intervening gap as, with
  restraint that told of strength in hand and limitless lore of rhythm, they
  danced their weaving measure seven times around the stone, as lovely to the
  eye as Grecian figures, cut in cameo on green and conjured into life. It was
  sheer spiritual magic.</p>

  <p>There was not a wasted motion, not a step but symbolized the ordered,
  infinitely beautiful evolving of a universe; and as they passed behind the
  glowing jade their figures seemed to swim within the stone, as if they were
  nymphs afloat in moonlit water. But there was no sign yet of San-fun-ho.</p>

  <p>"They shall remember this night!" said the Lama. The fire within the Jade
  grew dim and died as the moon's edge passed beyond the crags. The girls
  vanished in black darkness.</p>

  <p>"And so, you have seen the Jade. Few have seen that," said the Lama. "And
  you will find that there are very few who will believe you have seen it; but
  that is no harm, because most of those who would believe are merely
  credulous, of the sort who hunt miracles and seek to make themselves superior
  by short-cuts. Whereas there are no short-cuts, and there is no superiority
  of the sort they crave, but only a gradual increase of responsibility, which
  is attained by earned self-mastery."</p>

  <p>Suddenly a voice came from the pit beneath them, clear and confident,
  &mdash;the chela's:</p>

  <p>"O Tsiang Samdup!"</p>

  <p>The Lama answered with a monosyllable, his body rigid with emotion. His
  dim outline was like an eagle's startled from his aerie in the night.</p>

  <p>"O Tsiang Samdup, the Ahbors have come for a conference. They ask for word
  with you."</p>

  <p>"Cover the Jade," he answered.</p>

  <p>There was presently a phantom movement, shapeless and billowy, as if a
  huge black cloth were being hauled back into place; and then the rain came,
  softly, steadily, until the air grew full of music made by little cataracts
  that splashed from rock to rock. The Lama sighed and, for a moment, his
  outline seemed to shrink as old age claimed him, but he threw that off and
  stood up, motioning to Ommony to move back under shelter of the rock.</p>

  <p>"Wait there," he commanded, and vanished. Ommony could hear him climbing
  down into the darkness&mdash;and presently two voices as he talked in low
  tones with the chela. Then silence, for a very long time, only broken by the
  music of the rain and a weird wind sighing on the upper ledges until wind and
  rain ceased, and there was only the tinkle of dripping water.</p>

  <p>The dog crept close to Ommony for warmth, shivering at the loneliness.
  Ommony tried to memorize the Lama's conversation. He had almost forgotten the
  Jade. It was nothing as compared to the tremendous issues that the Lama dealt
  in. Thought groped in an unseen future. The sensation was of waiting on the
  threshold of a new world&mdash;waiting to be born. The past lost all reality.
  The world he had known&mdash;war&mdash;selfishness&mdash;
  corruption&mdash;was a nightmare, wrought of hopelessness and full of useless
  aims. The future? It was his&mdash;his own&mdash;immensely personal to him.
  He was about to be born again into the old world, but with an utterly new
  consciousness of values. He knew he had a duty in the world; but he could not
  formulate it&mdash;would not know how to begin&mdash; only knew it was
  immensely dark and silent on the threshold.</p>

  <p>The Lama's voice broke silence, speaking to the chela somewhere in the pit
  below:</p>

  <p>"The first duty of a chela is obedience!"</p>

  <p>Silence again. Not even wind or rain to break the stillness. At last the
  Lama's figure, like a shadow issuing from nothing, approaching along the
  ledge and sitting down near him&mdash;but not near enough for conversation.
  Then, after a very long pause, the chela's voice, resonant and clear from
  somewhere in the distance:</p>

  <p>"O Tsiang Samdup! I obey. And they obey me. May I wait until the dawn? It
  is not long."</p>

  <p>The Lama gave assent&mdash;one monosyllable&mdash;then groaned, and came
  and sat closer to Ommony.</p>

  <p>"My work is done," he said. "There is a limit to endurance."</p>

  <p>He glanced up at the sky, but there was no sign yet of dawn.</p>

  <p>A low chant came from the distance&mdash;almost like the humming of a
  swarm of bees, but the Lama took no notice of it.</p>

  <p>"She will go with you, thinking I come later. You may tell her in Tilgaun,
  and she will understand. She will be brave then. She will not forget she was
  my chela."</p>

  <p>There was only the sound of humming after that until the crags around the
  rim of the great pit grew faintly luminous before the coming of the dawn, and
  the stars grew paler. Then the hum swelled into song, whose music sounded
  like the mystic evolution of new worlds; they were all girls' voices,
  thrilling with courage and exultation. Ommony strained his ears to catch the
  words, but the distance was too great. Somehow, although he could not
  penetrate the darkness, he felt as if a veil were lifting.</p>

  <p>The song ceased, and in the hush that followed Tsiang Samdup rose to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"I go," he said quietly. "I am old, my son. I cannot bear to say good-by
  to my beloved chela. May the gods, who guard your manhood, give you strength
  and honesty to serve her. She will ask for me. You may say to her: 'The first
  duty of a chela is obedience.'"</p>

  <p>He turned into the tunnel, walking swiftly, and was gone. A silver bell
  rang, over in the distance, opposite, seven times, slow and distinct; then a
  pause, in which the overtones spread off into infinity; then seven times
  again. And as the last note faded into silence, dawn touched the crags with
  silver and the chela's voice rose young and glorious, intoning the oldest
  invocation in the world:</p>

  <p>"O my Divinity, blend Thou with me... that out of darkness I may go forth
  in Light."</p>

  <p>Daylight spread swiftly down the crags until it touched a ledge on which
  the chela stood, and all beneath that was darkness, like a pool of ink. Her
  right hand was raised. The other girls, beneath her, were invisible. Dawn
  glistened on her face.</p>

  <p>Her lips moved and her breast swelled as she drew breath to intone the
  Word. And then, in chorus from the mist and darkness that enwrapped her feet,
  and from her own lips, came the magic, long-drawn syllable that has been
  sacred since before Atlantis sank under the ocean and new races explored new
  continents&mdash;the Word that signifies immeasurable, absolute, unthinkable,
  all-compassing, forever infinite and unattainable, sublime and holy
  Essence&mdash;the Beginning and the End.</p>

  <p>"O-O-O-O-O-O-o-o-om-m-m-m-m&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It rose, and rose, and died away among the crags, until the last
  reverberation echoed faintly from the upper levels and there came an answer
  to it, sonorous and strong, in a man's voice, from a crag beside a cave-mouth
  three hundred feet above the ledge where Ommony stood, nearly midway between
  him and the chela. "O-O-O-O-O-O-o-o-om-m-m-m-m!"</p>

  <p>The Lama raised his right hand in a final benediction, turned into the
  cave and vanished. Then the chela's voice&mdash;calling to Ommony as dawn
  sank deep into the pit, revealing her companions on a ledge below.</p>

  <p>"O Gupta Rao&mdash;change your name now! Wait for me. I am coming
  &mdash;Tsiang Samdup bids us go forth together!"</p>
  <hr>
