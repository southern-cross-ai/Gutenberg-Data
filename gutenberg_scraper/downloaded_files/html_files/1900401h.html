<p>IT is almost unnecessary to state that, though published
anonymously, the truth of the accounts given in this little work
may be fully depended upon; and the Author can substantiate all the
great facts by an exact reference to the names, dates, and places.
Of course this would be unwillingly done, on account of the
ill-feeling that it would inevitably engender. He has carefully
endeavoured to avoid the possibility of the identification of the
parties whose actions are the subject of his remarks. His object
has been rather to draw attention to a system than to interest by
the detail of his mere private adventures.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter I. Arrival at Sydney.</h2>

<p class="newspaper">Perambulation of Sydney&mdash;The market&mdash;Dungaree settlers
over their pipes&mdash;The wharfs&mdash;The harbour by
moonlight&mdash;The St. Giles's of Sydney</p>

<p>IN 33° 48' S. lat. and 151° 17' E. long. the precipitous
mountain-like wall of rocky coast of New South Wales is broken by a
gigantic chasm; the crags on the south side are called the South
Head, those on the north the North Head. Passing between the two,
the voyager finds himself navigating a capacious arm of the sea,
with both the banks picturesque as fairy land. Here points bare,
grey, and bolder heaped jut out into the stream; and there the
waters retire back into deep bays, mazing off among shores clad
with evergreens and winding away into far-off tortuous channels,
that to the mariner's glass yield back nothing but a tale of
thwart-currents and impenetrable shadows. Piloted dexterously up
the main inlet, passing the Sow and Pigs (a larger and some smaller
sunken rocks dangerously scattered in the channel), and sailing on
past Garden and Pinchgut islands (two small scrub clad piles of
hoary stones, each standing solitary amidst the whistling winds of
the Stream), you come, after several miles, to the town of Sydney.
The main stream goes onward, forming the Paramatta, and, in a minor
branch, the Lane Cove rivers: over a great ridge-backed promontory,
that stands out in no easily describable shape among the irregular
waters on the left, is scattered the town of Sydney; adjacent to
which in the broad waters of the harbour is Goat Island, an
insulated rock famous in the records of convict discipline. On
getting sight of Sydney you see a waterside town scattered wide
over upland and lowland, and if it be a breezy day the merry
rattling pace of its manifold windmills, here and there perched on
the high points, is no unpleasing sight. It gives, even from the
distance, a presage of the stirring, downright earnest life (be it
for good or evil) that so strongly characterizes the race that
lives, and breathes, and strives around: a race with whom it is one
of the worst reproaches to be <i>a crawler</i>. Looking a little
more narrowly at the town you observe that it has several very
large piles of building; the most of these, as may be supposed, are
offices erected by the Government with the profusion of convict
labour which it has had at its command, and with no stint of an
excellent free working sandstone, which breaks up in masses through
the ground in every quarter of Sydney, and on every shore of the
hill bound bays of the adjacent country. Toward the extremity of
the promontory on which Sydney is built the ground is very steep
and lofty in the middle; and this, together with a concurrent
tendency in the flats presented in places by the freestone strata,
has led to ranging the houses in this part of the town in a series
of terraces rather than streets. Anchoring just under the
<i>south</i> side of this acclivity, off the King's Wharf, you
observe most of the rows of houses looking down upon you from above
one another's roofs. A moderately wide street is left in front of
each row, but so full of shelves and jump-ups as to be of little
use except to foot-passengers; and even to require for their
accommodation, in many places, sets of steps cut in the rock or
laid more regularly by the mason.</p>

<p>It was just as twilight darkened into the night of an evening in
early summer of the year 182-,* that the good ship &mdash;&mdash;,
in which I had made my passage from London, dropped anchor in the
very spot I have indicated, a few fathoms off shore abreast of the
King's Wharf. My apprenticeship to a &mdash;&mdash;, in the city of
London, had just terminated, and I had a very good knowledge of
house-carpentering beside. Of course my reason for emigrating to
New South Wales was the hope of bettering my condition. I had been
informed, and I found it correct, that very much higher wages than
those given in England were earned by mechanics in this colony:
consequently I had no occasion, upon arrival, to regret on this
account the step I had taken. My last near relative had died a few
months before my indentures expired, and had left me something more
than 130l. in cash, to be paid on my reaching the age of
twenty-one: this was only three months after my apprenticeship
expired. After laying out about 40l. in clothing, a few standard
books to read on the voyage, and such sea-necessaries of the
eatable and drinkable sort as were not supplied by the ship, I
thought myself very fortunate in obtaining a good passage in the
steerage for 25l. By the advice of the person who negotiated my
passage, I took a letter of credit for the remainder of my money on
a gentleman who was represented to me as being one of the most
respectable settlers in the colony. My disappointment and
disquietude may be easily imagined when, on going on shore the
evening of my arrival in Sydney, and making inquiries at the
Australian Hotel for the address of this individual, I was informed
that he was an insolvent, and that, from what was as yet publicly
known of his affairs, it was expected he would pay but a very small
dividend. If I had not the reflectiveness of age, however, I had
the hopefulness of youth; and as I happened to have made inquiries
about the condition and remuneration of my trade in the colony,
previously to those which met so discouraging an answer, the blow
from one source was, to a certain extent, compensated by the
support derived from the other. Partly also I was a little ashamed
to show all I felt, for I had a companion ashore with me who was
rather more fond of laughing at people's misfortunes than of
consoling the sufferers under them. After smoking a couple of
cigars and being initiated into that frightfully pernicious but
common habit of the colony, drinking rum neat out of wine-glasses,
we went out, dark as it was, for a stroll down the town. My
companion was the second mate of the vessel, and had visited Sydney
twice before; and as ships generally stopped five or six weeks
there, he had had every opportunity of becoming well acquainted
with the place. At this period Sydney was but ill lighted: only a
few lamps were scattered throughout the whole length of George
Street (the main thoroughfare), which, from the King's Wharf to the
end of the houses at the foot of the Brickfield Hill, can scarcely
be less than a mile and three-quarters.</p>

<p>[* In order to avoid giving any personal offence, blanks are
left in this and all similar cases, so as to avoid any
identification. The <i>facts</i> are all with which the public are
interested.]</p>

<p>As we walked down George Street we found Sydney, according to
custom during the first hour of a summer's night, all alive,
enjoying the cool air. The street was clear of vehicles, and
parties of the inhabitants, escaped from desk and shop, were
passing briskly to and fro, in full merriment and converse. At the
main barrack-gate the drums and fifes of the garrison were sounding
out the last notes of the tattoo. In Sydney the barracks occupy a
noble sweep of ground in the very centre of the town; the best
spot, in fact, for general commercial purposes that it a spot that
really ought, without further delay, to be resigned to the
corporation for those many important uses to which it could under
their direction be applied. Leaving the long line of barrack-wall
behind us we at length reached the market-place. The fine building
that now occupies the spot under the same name, was then not even
in projected existence; but the settlers drove their drays into the
open area amidst the old shedlike stalls that here and there stood
for the occupation of dealers; and the whole was surrounded by the
remains of a three-rail fence. As we wandered through the rows of
drays and carts I could not but remark a striking difference
between them and the contents of the carts of any general market
for the produce of the land at home. There was no hay, but its
place was abundantly supplied by bundles of green grass, much of it
almost as coarse as reeds, and evidently produced by a very wet,
rank soil. In other carts we found loads of such vegetables as the
country and the season yielded; some of these, we were given to
understand, were grown in the Curryjong Mountains, no less a
distance from Sydney than forty miles. In several carts we found
sacks of last year's maize; and in a very few, some sacks of last
year's wheat. Two drays only were loaded with new wheat, and these,
we were told, were the property of rich settlers. It was very much
the custom of the poorer settlers at this time, and indeed is so
still, to sell all or the greater part of the wheat they grow, and
live upon their Indian corn. This I was much surprised at before
necessity, at a future period, had compelled my palate to reconcile
itself to the peculiar flavour of maize-flour, cooked in its
various modes; but once used to it, I have always since eaten it
with much relish, and have consequently ceased to wonder at its
common use by others. It is a common assertion, that the poor
Australian settler (or, according to colonial phraseology, the
Dungaree-settler; so called from their frequently clothing
themselves, their wives, and children in that blue Indian
manufacture of cotton known as <i>Dungaree</i>) sells his wheat
crop from pure love of rum; and having drank the proceeds, then of
necessity lives the rest of the year on maize. But this seems to be
only partially true. The fact appears rather, that wheat being the
most costly grain, many eat maize from economy, selling the wheat
to procure meat, tea, sugar, tobacco, and clothing; and few persons
who have tasted the deliciousness of a corn-doughboy eaten with the
salt pork which constitutes so large a portion of their animal
diet, will consider their taste altogether perverted.</p>

<p>After our cursory look at the market&mdash;if look it could be
called which was performed in the dark&mdash;we went into "The
Market-house." I really forget whether this was its name by licence
or whether it was merely so called on account of being the
principal rendezvous of the market-people. It, however, was a
regular licensed public-house; but I should suppose at this time
there were nearly twice as many unlicensed grog-shops as licensed
public-houses in the town of Sydney, in despite of the constables
and a heavy fine. In the large tap-room of the Market-house (which
we entered more for the purposes of curiosity than anything else)
we found a strange assemblage; and stranger still were their
dialect and their notions. Most had been convicts: there were a
good many Englishmen and Irishmen, an odd Scotchman, and several
foreigners, besides some youngish men, natives of the colony.
Amongst them was present here and there a woman, apparently the
wife of a settler. The few women were all sober and quiet, but many
of the men were either quite intoxicated or much elevated by
liquor. The chief conversation consisted of vaunts of the goodness
of their bullocks, the productiveness of their farms, or the
quantity of work they could perform. Almost everybody was drinking
rum in drams, or very slightly qualified with water; nor were they
niggard of it, for we had several invitations from those around us
to drink. I could not however, even at this early period of my
acquaintance with this class of people, help observing one
remarkable peculiarity common to them all&mdash;there was no
offensive intrusiveness about their civility; every man seemed to
consider himself just on a level with all the rest, and so quite
content either to be sociable or not, as the circumstance of the
moment indicated as most proper. The whole company was divided into
minor groups of twos, threes, and fours, and the <i>dudeen</i> (a
pipe with stem reduced to three, two, one, or half an inch) was in
everybody's mouth. I think there was not an individual in the room,
but one female, who did not smoke more or less, during the brief
time we sat there. Their dresses were of all sorts: the blue jacket
and trousers of the English lagger, the short blue cotton
smock-frock and trousers, the short woollen frock and trousers,
fustian jacket and trousers, and so forth, beyond my utmost power
of recollection. Some wore neckhandkerchiefs; some none. Some wore
straw hats, some beavers, some caps of untanned kangaroo-skin. And
not a shin in the room that displayed itself to my eyes had on
either stocking or sock. Of course I speak here only of the very
lowest class; such as were derived from the lowest rank at home,
and who, whatever advantages they had had in the colony, still
continued unexalted by improved opportunities, unstimulated by
hope, and making no efforts beyond what were necessary to supply
their mere animal wants. To the same mart came down others in
various degrees superior; many, particularly among the young
natives, of plain but solid worth: but this was not the place to
meet with them.</p>

<p>In traversing George Street to this point we had, to speak
without very great exactness, run down the middle of the neck of
land on which I have (for want of a better term) described Sydney
as being built. Having started with the vessel on our left hand, my
friend proposed that we should now strike right across from George
Street to the other principal wharf, the market wharf. For as the
King's wharf lies toward the seaward end of the promontory on the
one side, so the market wharf lies nearly at the landward end on
the opposite; just below the higher ground where the market is
held, and within good bow-shot of it. To it come great numbers of
market boats to unload the various produce of the settlers' farms
on the Paramatta and Lane Cove rivers, and the circumjacent
country. The boats also that come from up and down the coast,
outside the harbour, unload here. Amongst the chief cargoes to this
wharf is timber, of which great quantities always lie stacked upon
the quay. It may be said generally, that it is the wharf for
articles of home produce, and, therefore, clear of duty; whilst to
the King's wharf more usually comes foreign merchandise. One of the
excellences of the site of Sydney is that either deep water washes
the rock on which it is built, or, where it does not, a good depth
can with very little difficulty be artificially obtained by a short
jetty. And as the circumference of the promontory, without going
minutely into bays and inlets, must be at least 2½ miles, this
really amounts to the town having a wharf of that length; at the
same time the vessels are sheltered very nearly as entirely as if
in dock, and there is good anchorage. All this, however, I knew not
then; but it gave me no little delight at the time, to find that I
had come across the land to what seemed another sea. There was not
a creature on the wharf but ourselves, and the continual melancholy
plash of the flooding tide, among the boats that lay moored in
numbers close together, made the hour and the scene appear more
lonesome still. The moon was just glinting over the dark wooded
hills, so that I could plainly enough see the masses of forest on
the opposite shore. What a wonderful advance had this same locality
experienced when, a few years afterwards, I bade adieu to it for
England! This solitary landing-place had become a street, and busy
steamers at the same hour came roaring past with their teeming
cargoes from the northern and southern settlements. The British
Government cannot understand the value of the Australian colonies,
or it would never treat them as it does.</p>

<p>My guide and self now pursued our way, in a retrograde
direction, along the side of the waters of Darling Harbour, then
called Cockle Bay, until we reached a position parallel to which,
on the opposite side, our vessel lay anchored. We then struck right
up across the ridge toward it, or rather, as nearly straight across
as crags and quarries, and rows of houses would allow. My guide had
brought me this way, to point out to me another of the low-life
sections of Sydney; in fact, its St. Giles's and Wapping in one.
From the earliest times of the settlement there congregated on the
steep ridge above the King's wharf all the worst characters of this
penal colony&mdash;the felon, whose ill-directed punishment had
only rendered him more obdurate, cunning, and slothful; the
prostitute, who (if such a thing can be) had sunk yet lower; the
<i>fence</i>, watching for a livelihood by plundering the
plunderer; many who, without great positive vices, a sort of
brutelike ignorance and uncouthness had rendered it impossible for
more orderly and rational society to amalgamate with itself; and
many drawn into the vortex of ruin through their mere want of
direction, or energetic resolve for either good or evil. To these
it is painful to be compelled to add British sailors, who, admitted
into no respectable company in the ports where they land, naturally
seek female society, where only they can find it, in the brothel.
Such were the inhabitants of the section of the town we here passed
through. We went into two houses, the one called "The Black Dog," a
licensed house, the other close beside it, an old dilapidated
place, properly enough called "The Sheer Hulk," which had been
deprived of its licence on account of the practices and characters
admitted by its landlord; it was, however, still occupied, and as
the occupier was no longer under the apprehension of losing his
licence, the scenes displayed nightly were of tenfold worse
character than ever. So that detection and legal evidence were
evaded, all that was cared for by the scoundrel who held it was
attained. At the present time I shall not enter into further
description of this den, than by remarking that we found it full to
suffocation of the lowest women, sailors, and ruffians, who
supported themselves by waylaying and robbing and often murderously
wounding any intoxicated sea officer, newly-arrived emigrant, or
up-country settler, who might chance to wander into their infernal
precinct; and as part of the occupation of the women was to act as
lures, of course this was no rare occurrence. The door was kept
barred, and there was an outlet behind up the rocks. Hereafter, an
incident in the course of my narrative will render it necessary for
me to give a more particular account of the forlorn and infamous
abodes of this part of the town. This night we soon left them, and
passed down into George Street: here we parted&mdash;my companion
to his duties on board the ship, as he had only obtained leave for
four hours; I to the bed I had engaged at the Australian hotel, a
few yards from the wharf.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter II. Convict Discipline.</h2>

<p class="newspaper">Magistrates' law in former times&mdash;Dark doings at
iron-gangs&mdash;Military justices&mdash;A flogging-scene at
Bathurst Gaol&mdash;Flogging to extort confession&mdash;A
prosecutor and judge all in one</p>

<p>BEFORE proceeding with the account of my personal adventures, it
is necessary that I should inform the reader of a circumstance
which gave me my first and ineradicable impression of the system of
convict discipline maintained in the Australian colonies at this
time. A gentleman, through misfortunes reduced to the inferior
condition of a farm overseer, who had originally come to the colony
in possession of a very good property, breakfasted in the same room
with me at the Australian hotel. As I was looking over the police
reports in 'The Sydney Gazette,' our conversation was led to the
subject of convict discipline, and then took in substance the
following turn. This gentleman is still alive, though very aged.
His character for perseverance and integrity obtained for him,
about three years subsequently, a lucrative situation, and finally
extensive credit, from his employer, a Sydney merchant. These
advantages he so well husbanded that he will in all probability
leave his family in independence. My knowledge of the man therefore
would put it out of my power to doubt the trustworthiness of his
statements, if even I had met no confirmation of them from my own
observations.</p>

<p>"You may wonder, my lad," he said, "at what you read about the
treatment of prisoners: most people do when they first come. But
you'll see things yet up the country that these Sydney doings are
only child's play by the side of."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say," I replied, "that I shall meet with
anything worse than this case I have just read? Here is an offence
called by three different names; three several charges are made
upon it; three several trials, three several sentences, and three
several punishments following! A man gets drunk, has his clothes
stolen, and is afraid to go home to his master: he is tried first
for drunkenness, a second time for making away with his clothing,
and a third time for absconding. His sentence is in sum total one
hundred lashes, which with the cat-o'-nine-tails is really nine
hundred lashes."</p>

<p>"Why, I have known the same act to be called by <i>five</i>
different names, and <i>five</i> sentences passed upon the prisoner
for it. It was in the case of a government servant belonging to a
magistrate near me. The man, as in the case you read, had got a
drop of liquor from a travelling dealer; his master's son, a very
pert young fellow, began to curse at and threaten him; the man
retorted; a constable was sent for, whom he knocked down and
escaped from. He then ran off into the bush, taking with him, as he
passed his own hut, about three parts of a cake he had by him ready
baked. The young fellow prosecuted him for drunkenness, insolence,
theft (the piece of bread, for rations are considered the master's
till used), and bushranging; and then the magistrate made the
constable swear the assault against him. He got twenty-five lashes
for drunkenness, twentyfive for insolence, fifty for bushranging,
six months to an iron-gang* for stealing the cake, and three months
for assaulting a peace-officer in the execution of his duty. The
flogging he got before going to the iron-gang frightened him; and
on receiving sentence for some trivial offence at the iron-gang, he
escaped before the punishment was inflicted, took the bush, joined
a gang of bushrangers who had arms, committed several robberies
with them, was taken with arms in his hands, and hanged. The man
was a quiet, hardworking, honest fellow; but he could not stand
flogging, and he was fond of liquor. The crime he was sent here for
he committed when drunk, and it was perhaps the only one he had to
answer for. That man was murdered! And so hundreds upon hundreds
have been, and are being, every year in this cursed country. But
the system is not now so bad as it used to be. Since Dr. Wardle and
young Mr. Wentworth came out, and began to look after the
government and the magistrates, there are not such dreadful doings
as there used to be in former times."</p>

<p>[* Prisoners working in irons.]</p>

<p>"How long have you been here then, Sir?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Nearly a score years. I have seen a good deal with my own eyes,
and that makes me believe other things that I have only been told.
And then, again, I have often heard men, after they became free,
throw into the teeth of overseers the usage they had received at
their hands. I recollect once, in coming over the Blue Mountains,
it set in to rain very hard, and by the time we got to the punt at
Richmond the Hawkesbury River was up, and there was no getting
over. Nearly a hundred of us were gathered together about the
public-house at the ferry. And here one of the labouring men
recognised an overseer who had been over him at the lime-burners'
gang at Newcastle. The overseer stoutly contended that he was not
the person; but it was of no use. I made sure he'd have got his
brains knocked out, and no doubt he would, had not the landlord
shut him up in his room."</p>

<p>"What had he done?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing more than the other overseers, so far as I heard;
but certainly that was enough, when we come to consider; for men
are men, and not beasts, let'em be ever such thieves. From all
accounts there were some dark doings at that lime-burners' gang. I
have heard from twenty sources that Red &mdash;&mdash;, the
overseer, was known to have killed a man with a handspike, and was
never tried for it. The commandant was as big a brute as he was,
and so was not likely to bring him to justice; and the men were all
afraid to say anything. It is a well-known fact that they used to
ronse up the poor half-starved skeletons of fellows at midnight to
load lime, when the boats happened to come in with a night's tide.
They used to have to carry the baskets of unslacked lime a great
way into the water in loading the boats; by which means many of
their backs were raw, and eaten into holes. But that made no
difference. The work they must do. The shed they had to sleep in
was close by the water-side; and the slabs were so wide apart that
you might almost have galloped a horse through. Many of them, at
one time, had scarcely a rag of clothes; nothing more indeed than
some piece of an old red shirt that they tied round their middle,
and neither bed nor blanket. A man who worked for me told me that
such was his case for a long time; and that for warmth they used to
gather sea-weed off the beach, and spread it some inches thick on
the floor of the hut; and numbers of them would turn in together,
covering themselves over with it, and getting warmth from the
fermentation of the sea-weed: you may say, in short, they buried
themselves in a dunghill to keep warm."</p>

<p>"Still, even this was better than so much flogging."</p>

<p>"Ha! but you must understand that the flogging went on full
swing along with all this. But the fact is, flogging in this
country is such a common thing that nobody thinks anything of it. I
have seen young children practising on a tree, as children in
England play at horses. I have now got a man under me who received
2600 lashes with the cat in about five years, and his worst crime
was insolence to his overseer. The fact is, the man is a red-hot
Tipperary man; and when his blood gets up, you could not make him
hold his tongue if you were to threaten to hang him. Since I have
had him he has never had a lash, just because I take no notice of
what he says. The consequence is, there is nothing in the world
that man would not do for me if be could. Some years ago, a little
way up the country, a man actually died under the eat: of course it
was all quietly hushed up."</p>

<p>"But do you really think such things can be true?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, when I see the very like of them under my own
eyes. For instance, there is a lieutenant (a mere boy), who is now
magistrate over a gang that are making a road not three miles from
the farm where I stop. Whenever this lad means to send a man to the
lock-up for the night, he makes the lock-up keeper start three or
four buckets of water over the floor, under pretence of keeping it
free from vermin, but really for the purpose of tormenting the
culprit by compelling him to walk about all night; and then he will
have the poor wretch tied up to the triangles the first thing in
the morning, before breakfast. This I know to be true, because I
have it from the lock-up keeper himself. The fact is that officers,
and especially young officers, when made magistrates, get irritated
at the hardihood of a class of men whom they have made up their
minds to despise; and the cat being a soldier's natural revenge,
they fly to it directly. It is as common, you know, for one soldier
to revenge himself upon another by getting him flogged, as it is
for women, when they fight, to pull one another's hair."</p>

<p>"One can hardly conceive such things possible."</p>

<p>"Ah! you must not judge of this country by England. What I tell
you now, I tell you on the authority of my own eyes. I was sent for
to Bathurst Court-house to identify a man supposed to have taken
the bush from the farm I have charge of. I had to go past the
triangles, where they had been flogging incessantly for hours. I
saw a man walk across the yard with the blood that had run from his
lacerated flesh squashing out of his shoes at every step he took. A
dog was licking the blood off the triangles, and the ants were
carrying away great pieces of human flesh that the lash had
scattered about the ground. The scourger's foot had worn a deep
hole in the ground by the violence with which he whirled himself
round on it to strike the quivering and wealed back, out of which
stuck the sinews, white, ragged, and swollen. The infliction was a
hundred lashes, at about half-minute time, so as to extend the
punishment through nearly an hour. The day was hot enough to
overcome a man merely standing that length of time in the sun; and
this was going on in the full blaze of it. However, they had a pair
of scourgers, who gave one another spell and spell about; and they
were bespattered with blood like a couple of butchers. I tell you
this on the authority of my own eyes. It brought my heart into my
mouth."</p>

<p>"Well, I can only say that, for disgusting brutality, it exceeds
anything I ever yet heard of as practised under the sanction of
British law."</p>

<p>"It is nevertheless true; and many much worse things than any I
have yet enumerated are true. For instance, there are some
magistrates who habitually flog to compel men to confess anything
of which they suppose them guilty. I heard of a case only the other
day where a man had several 'fifties,' on several consecutive days,
to compel him to confess a robbery. No doubt in many such instances
there is a sort of certainty of the man's guilt; but then again
there have been very many cases where it turned out that the
suspicion was totally unfounded. I know of several poor creatures
who have been entirely crippled for life by these merciless
floggings; and, which is worst of all, oftentimes for offences
which no considerate and right-thinking person would dream of
considering heinous and unpardonable. I will give one instance more
of the summary jurisdiction of magistrates. The commandant at
&mdash;&mdash;, a police station near my hut, was walking out one
summer-evening about twelve months ago with his lady; he was in
plain clothes, all but his military foraging cap, an article of
dress that many private gentlemen wear. Two men accosted him, and
asked the way to a farm in the vicinity, to whose owner they had
been assigned. Considering they did not address him quite
respectfully enough, he gave them some sharp language, which they
returned: here-upon, but still without telling them that he was a
magistrate, he laid hands on one of them, who immediately tripped
him up. On this his lady began to shout out most lustily, which
brought the soldiers of the party under his command out of their
hut close by. The men were presently seized and confined. The next
day the worshipful peace-breaker deposed against them himself,
before himself, pronounced them guilty himself, and sentenced them
himself to twelve months at an iron-gang."</p>

<p>At the present stage of my narrative I shall make no remarks of
my own upon this subject: proper opportunities for such remarks
will, I am sorry to say, but too frequently present themselves to
allow the subject to be forgotten.</p>

Colony.</h2>

Wales&mdash;Terms of agreement&mdash;Journey up the
country&mdash;Conflagration of the Bush&mdash;A workingman's
hut&mdash;Musktree&mdash;Descent of the Illawarra range&mdash;A
settler's hut, with travellers lodged for the night&mdash;Romantic
scenery&mdash;Awkward bridge&mdash;A stock-station hut&mdash;A
sample of the population</p>

<p>IMAGINE the delight with which, after being unsuccessful for
about three weeks, I got my first job in the colony. At the period
of my debarkation most of the large settlers were up the country on
their farms, it being the season for important farm operations,
such as sheep washing, sheep shearing, wool pressing for
exportation, reaping, cattle muster, &amp;c.; and besides, I had no
acquaintance in Sydney from whom I could hear of employment, or to
whom I could make myself known. My engagement at last was more a
matter of accident than the result of my own endeavours. The
landlord of the public house, where I went every morning to look
over the advertisements in hope of finding something that would
suit me, had been brought up to the same trade as myself; knowing
what kind of work I was seeking, he recommended me to a customer of
his who had come up from the Five Islands with a boat load of
cedar, and wanted a snug little hut put up for his family; they had
been there some time, but had been living, hitherto, under a few
sheets of bark.</p>

<p>The Five Islands (by the aborigines much more euphoniously
called Illa Warra) is a tract of New South Wales, a short distance
south of Sydney, on the sea-coast, and so called from five small
islands which lie a short distance off, immediately abreast of it.
It may be described loosely as a plot of the richest soil, bounded
on one side by the sea, and on the other by enormous masses of
mountain, confusedly heaped together. These are covered either with
dense dark forests, or low bushy scrub, knee high or higher, with
flats of swampy table-land, and gloomy ravines, into whose depths
the eye cannot reach. The soil is excellent. I have heard some of
the settlers say, that they could dig down 40 feet through the soil
of their farms on this seaside tract without finding a stone as
large as a pea. Little crystal brooks of the coldest and purest
water, making their way out of the mountain reservoirs above,
traverse the ground at all seasons of the year, in their passage to
the sea. It was therefore one of the most amiable features of the
policy of the best Governor this colony ever had, to give out in
this district farms to a number of little settlers; for a poor
man's use of land is of course first agricultural, and a fertile
soil must be an immense advantage. Amidst the wild dark gullies of
the mountain, and along the solitary course of the cool shadowy
streams, grew at that time great numbers of rich and massive
cedars, the price of the timber of which was so high as to
counterbalance in the minds of the hardy working men of the colony
the difficulties, toils, and perils of procuring it for the Sydney
market.</p>

<p>My agreement with Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (the settler who now wanted
a hut put up) was soon made, for I knew so very little of the
customs of the colony that I saw no objections to any thing he
proposed. It was stated in the agreement, which was a written one,
that I was to proceed to Illa Warra and erect for Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; a house of such or such timber, of so many feet
length, so many breadth, and so many height, &amp;c. &amp;c.; in
consideration whereof, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was to pay me the sum of
75<i>l.</i>; supply me with rations at a rate specified for each
article; lend me one of his convict servants to assist in cutting
down and splitting the timber, and other work requiring two hands;
and draw out of the bush the split stuff, &amp;c. as soon as it was
ready. The bargain thus far concluded, he told me I could have if I
chose an advance of 5<i>l.</i> before leaving Sydney, to buy any
extra tools I wanted. I then found I should need to buy a cross-cut
saw and some other small articles, which however I did with my own
money, still having sufficient by me for that purpose; and having
seen the tools, my own tool chest, and clothes, &amp;c. aboard the
boat, started along with one of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s men by land
for the Five Islands.</p>

<p>This man was the convict who was to be my mate. In New South
Wales it is not thought any derogation to travel with convict
servants; in fact it is often unavoidable. It was a very hot
morning, and as we had each a small bundle, our jackets were off
before we were two miles over the red dusty hills just out of
Sydney. At one or two creeks where we attempted to drink, the water
was so dreadfully brackish as to be too nauseous to swallow; and
into one of them, from a little branch just above my head, as I was
tasting, dropped a yellow snake about a foot long, and as soon as
he had accomplished this feat swam over to a hole in the opposite
bank, apparently as well pleased to have escaped me as I certainly
was to have escaped him. Finding so little relief from the creeks,
we resolved to push on to the half-way house and have some
refreshment and a smoke. A good heart soon gets through its task;
so in little more than a couple of hours we reached our
destination. But here, instead of the refreshing beer of Old
England, I found I must put up with rum and water; the rum most
execrable Bengal. After stopping about half an hour we lighted our
short pipes (for such is the usual travellers' pipe in New South
Wales, where every body smokes except ladies) and started again,
when less than three hours' walking brought us to Liverpool, beyond
which, however, we had still thirteen miles to go to complete our
first day's stage. I never wish to have such another walk; by the
time we reached Liverpool I had actually ceased to perspire, and
was in a high fever; moreover, as is mostly the case, long
confinement on shipboard had so unfitted my feet for walking, that
they had swelled even to above the ankles so much that at night I
could hardly get my half-boots off. At the suggestion of my
companion, we deferred our further journey till the cool of the
evening. After dinner, tired and jaded as I was, I could not help
taking a stroll round the township, as it was then called. Thirst
after knowledge I have always through life found to be one of the
most self-rewarding tendencies of our nature; it is one which I
would recommend the young to subordinate to nothing but the moral
and religious attributes of their minds: but let all who value
their virtue, their worth, and the inborn rewards of the mind, take
no less care, on the other part, that not the desire of knowledge
only, but knowledge itself, be held in watchful and perpetual
subservience to the interests of men, and the honour of our Divine
Creator. My reader will doubtless say that these are the
ruminations of a later day; and he will say aright: they are
so&mdash;would they were not. But to return: Liverpool was at this
time a straggling and pretty little country town, built, one might
say, on a green, and with a cool stream gliding along between
deep-sloping banks at its side.</p>

<p>Before our departure from the township, about seven in the
evening, I heard the people talking of the fire that was burning in
the bush, and saw numbers of them assembled in groups, pointing out
to each other its progress across the adjacent country. In New
South Wales, as the winter days are much longer than they are in
high latitudes, so the summer days are much shorter: thus when we
were two hours on the road it had become quite dark, and as we were
intersecting by that time a tract of bush that the fire had already
swept through, I had a full opportunity of examining this, one of
the finest sights which tropical countries display. Our road was
about the width of an English second-rate turnpike road. Above us
the sky was gloomy and still; all round us the far-stretching
forests exposed a strange and varied pageant of darkness and fire,
accompanied by the crackling of flames and the crash of falling
trees. Here was a bridge over a deep creek, now empty with summer
drought, with all its huge sleepers glowing in red charcoal and
tumbling together into heaps in the channel, and carrying down with
them the top layer of slabs that, covered with earth, had been the
roadway; over these we had to leap and clamber as we could, unless
there was some track down across the creek-bed, by the side of the
bridge. Once my companion was very nearly in a furnace of red
charcoal up to his middle, or rather he was in; for the ground sank
beneath his feet, and with that admirable presence of mind which a
rough life so generally engenders, he flung himself, while sinking,
forward on his hands on to a solid spot, and instantaneously drew
his legs up after him and sprang forward. Here, again, some huge
old tree came thundering down right across the road, and its boughs
kindling from the opposite side were in full roaring blaze,
lighting up every thing nigh with ruddy brilliance, and throwing
into the dense volume of smoke above a red semi-transparency.
Farther on again, where the bush was thinner and the materials for
ravage more scanty, the fire had nearly subsided; all was obscure
and silent, except some single trunk, off in the bush, hollow and
old, and headless, through whose chimney-like barrel went upwards
with fierce steady roar a volume of flame and crowds of sparks into
the blackness of night; and then, all on a sudden, the fire would
reach a cluster of tree-heads as yet untouched, and go blazing and
crackling and leaping through them until nothing was left for it to
devour. The heat was in many places intense, and the smoke in
others suffocating; whilst snakes, guanas, bandicoots, opossums,
&amp;c. were crossing the road in every direction, each in its
natural dumbness or with its wild weak cry of fear. In one place we
saw a very large opossum (in the language of the country an old man
'possum) on the edge of a lofty hollow tree trunk, that had been no
doubt his home, out of which and alongside him, as he moved to and
fro to avoid it, the increasing fire kept ever and anon shooting up
its pointed tongues: we stood watching him until the poor animal,
no longer able to endure the torture, leaped to the ground, a
height of full 40 feet, where to my astonishment, after lying an
instant motionless, he picked himself up suddenly, then fell again
and rolled over and over three or four times, and finally went off
like mad across the bush. I have since found that the gift of these
animals in this way is perfectly wonderful; certainly if there is
in this world an unconquerable dare-devil animal, it is the old man
'possum, and indeed all his family, mother, sons, and daughters,
after their sucking days are over: until then you may tame them.
Before we got into Campbell Town, our destination for the night, we
met with another and different exemplification of the effects of
the fire on dumb animals. One of the commissaries of the colony had
ridden his horse out from Campbell Town towards Liverpool, where he
resided, as far as where the fire was pretty fierce on each side of
the road, and to some distance onward through it; but here the
horse became frightened, then restive, and then unmanageable; and
when we came up, horse and rider were literally pirouetting
together in circles about the road, the commissary on foot, holding
the bridle with both hands, and the horse for the most part on two
legs also, leading the dance. With a good deal of exertion we
succeeded in driving the terrified animal in the same direction as
his rider wished to lead him in, until quite clear of the fire, and
then left them. At nearly twelve o'clock at night we reached our
journey's end, a little hut by the road-side just entering the
township. Here my fellow-traveller had a brother living, whose
lagging (transportation) having occurred some years before his own,
he was now free; and had a job of splitting and fencing from the
settler to whom the ground belonged. My companion's well-known
voice soon aroused the sleeper, who came to the door in his shirt:
in his shirt lit the fire; in his shirt got us supper; in his shirt
joined us in a feed and a smoke; and in his shirt made our bed, and
tumbled into it with us.</p>

<p>But here I must remember that the mysteries of an Australian
bedmaking demand somewhat explicit description. I shall not
generalise, but speak here of the particular instance alone. The
hut itself, which was merely a few sheets of bark stripped from
trees, and each varying from the size of a common door to that of
double that width by the same length, was but a single area of
about 9 feet one way by 6 the other: the roof too was of bark, and
of the usual shape. One of the 6-feet ends was a chimney,
throughout its whole width, in which the fire was made by logs of
any length and thickness available; on the earthen hearth, at the
other 6-feet end, was a sort of berth, also of bark, like the bunks
on board ship, fixed at about 3 feet from the ground; whilst at the
9-feet side next the road was the door, which likewise was of bark;
and at the opposite parallel side was a little table, and that too
was of bark, to wit, a sheet about 3 feet one way by 2 the other,
nailed on to four little posts driven into the ground, and having
of course its inner or smooth side upwards. The architect of the
building had used all his materials whilst they were green, so that
in seasoning they had twisted into all manner of forms except
planes; and as is usually the case the worst example came from the
most responsible quarter; the table was the crookedest thing in the
whole hut, not excepting the dog's hind leg. Standing about the
floor were sundry square-ended round blocks of wood, just as they
were first sawn off the tree transversely: they were each about
eighteen inches long, and their official rank in the domestic
system was equivalent to that of the civilized chair. After a good
supper of hot fried beefsteaks, damper bread and tea, which our
host, who was a free-hearted, hardworking bush-man, gave with many
a "Come, eat, lad, don't be afraid; there is plenty more where this
came from," &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. according to the custom of
the colony and especially of his class, we betook ourselves to a
smoke of good old Brazil, over the latter part of our quart pots of
tea; and then at nearly two o'clock my companion reminded his
brother that it was "time to pig down." Accordingly our entertainer
clearing the floor by making us stand in the chimney, putting the
blocks under the table, and giving his dog a kick, which I thought
the thing least to his credit that I had seen him do, began to
"make the dab." This was accomplished by stretching his own bed,
which was only adapted for a single person, lengthwise across the
hut, at about 6 or 7 feet from the fire-place; then laying down
across the hut in the same manner between the bed and the
fire-place all the old clothes he could muster of his own; and
finally over these he spread about half a dozen good sized dried
sheepskins with the wool on. These, with a blanket spread over the
whole, really made a very tolerable bed. Certainly towards morning
I began to feel a good deal as if I were lying with my body in a
field and my legs in the ditch beside: however, I have had many a
worse lodging between that night and this. For pillow we each had
one of the wooden blocks. The blankets were the most patrician
class of the accommodations; of these we had three very good ones
for covering, but it was not long before the heat of the night
compelled us to throw them off, nor much longer before the
musquitoes compelled us to draw one of them on again. Small as
these insects are, their sting is so annoying that I do not think
either of us would have slept till daylight had not our host at
length gone out, in his shirt as ever, and brought in a piece of
dried cowdung, which being lit and laid at the further end of the
hut kept smouldering on and throwing out a dull peculiar scented
smoke for hours. This proved a complete remedy, and one which I
never afterwards forgot. I do not know what is the reason, but
musquitoes are proof against strong wood smoke, yet not against
this; while at the same time it is not at all seriously offensive
to man, but wood smoke is. By about four o'clock in the morning we
were fast asleep.</p>

<p>I was awakened by our host coming in from his work to breakfast.
It was about eight o'clock, and his brother, who had also been up
some time, had lit the fire, boiled a piece of salted beef, baked a
cake on the hot hearth, and made the tea. This sort of readiness
and activity is a remarkable feature in the character of the
working population of the Australian colonies.</p>

<p>After breakfast we lit our pipes, and bidding our hospitable
acquaintance good bye, started once more. To his hospitality was
added a pressing invitation to me to stop at his hut at any time I
might be coming by that way. Our next stage was to Appin, which,
the excessively hot day before being succeeded as is often the case
in this country by a cloudy and rather bleak one, we accomplished
easily by noon: our way still lay between forests in some places,
and in others over fine, lofty, cleared, and cultivated hills,
along a good turnpike road. After dinner, which we took at the
little inn of the settlement, we struck off along a wild bush
track, direct for the coast mountains; for it should be stated,
although our journey was from one sea-side place to another, we had
made it by a wide sweep inland, and not in a direction parallel to
the coast; the country immediately behind which, in this part of
New South Wales, being so broken and mountainous as to afford no
practicable track.</p>

<p>Indeed, I could not but wonder how the road we were now pursuing
from Appin towards the coast had been discovered. I was not then
aware that the aborigines are so well acquainted with the bush as
to be able to point out the most practicable tracks in any
direction. After travelling through dense and lofty forests on rich
soil, over dwarf brush and scrub on stony hills and sandy plains,
bare rocks and rushy swamps, in fact after traversing a line of
country as varied in character as can be imagined, we came toward
sundown to the entrance of the thick brush of the Illa Warra
mountain above Bullie. I recollect one incident that struck me very
forcibly as we made our way to the brink of the descent: I suddenly
became sensible of a most delicious scent of musk, and on calling
my companion's attention to it he stopped and plucked a leaf from a
beautiful slender shrub, whose long shoots overhung our path, and
gave it me to smell. It was a tree musk-scented, and to such a
degree that the leaves I put in my pocket-book and carried away
with me retained their agreeable odour when I examined them many
months afterwards. We now soon came to the edge of the mountain. At
one spot we stood on the brink of a precipice of vast depth, and
saw down below us the mighty sea diminished into insignificance,
most like the waters of a lower world. The mountain, at the spot
where we went down, is pretty closely timbered, and the trees are
lofty: no grass grows beneath them, as is usually the case where
the forest is sufficiently dense to keep the ground under continual
shadow. In the midst of our descent, which was so steep as to
compel us in some places to stop ourselves against the trees, I was
surprised to recognise the tracks of dray-wheels (drays being the
common luggage conveyance of the colony); for it was evidently
impossible that any beast could back a dray-load down such a steep.
My fellow-traveller however informed me that it had been let down
by ropes fixed to the dray, and passed round the trees; the shaft
bullock (for oxen are the draught beasts in common use) merely
holding up the shafts. I was glad at length to find myself at the
foot of the mountain. I think I never felt anything more difficult
to bear than the strain on the knee joints, occasioned by this
descent; it was not exactly pain, but something worse.</p>

<p>The Australian twilight is short; and it was now become almost
dark. Happily we had but a short way to travel before reaching our
restingplace for the night. We were now on that flat bordered on
the one side by the sea, and on the other limited by the mountain,
which I have already mentioned as being the Illa Warra district;
and at this particular point it is scarcely a gunshot across. We
consequently could hear the measured wash of the sea distinctly
through the solemn stillness of the evening forest. A feeling of
breathless awe steals over the spirit in traversing these grand and
solitary forests amidst the thickening obscurity of evening: and
buoyant as my spirits then were, I could not help being sensible of
this influence. Suddenly the quick, cheerful bark of a dog startled
the echoes; and in another instant a voice of Irish accent called
him back as he came bounding towards us from round the corner of a
square low building that was just discernible in the dark. A few
more steps and turning the corner of this building we stood at the
door of the settler's hut, where we were to stop for the night. It
was one of those huts which must be ranked among the remarkable
objects of Australian life. Situated on some main track and alone
in the midst of the wilderness, one of these little "cribs"
necessarily becomes the nightly rendezvous of numbers of
travellers. If the traveller have no food with him, a share of what
there is is always freely offered him; whether any remuneration is
given, depends entirely upon the circumstances and disposition of
the parties. If it be a poor man whose hut the wayfaring public has
thus invested with the dignity of an inn, persons in good
circumstances always make him some present for the accommodation:
if it be a settler in tolerably good circumstances who is thus
situated, remuneration is not thought so imperative; but in either
case if the traveller be a poor man, he is welcomed to whatever
there may be, and nothing is expected from him in return. The same
hospitality is maintained in accommodations for rest. Those who
have a blanket with them contribute it to the general stock; those
who have none have equal share with those who have. These customs
lead very naturally to a great degree of frankness and cordiality
among the persons, most of whom are thus meeting for the first
time, and the evenings consequently are for the most part spent in
cheerful conversation and merriment. This species of arrangement
extends throughout the colony; with this difference, that off the
main lines of road, and still more so the farther you advance into
the bush, the usual run of travellers are not only not expected to
make any recompense, but in many places it would be treated as an
insult to offer it. As full twothirds of the labouring population
of the country are in perpetual migration, the custom is a very
proper one. It probably originated in the first place from the
smallness of the community, almost every one knowing almost every
other; and there is no doubt that the great scarcity of cash in the
up country parts has principally maintained it.</p>

<p>Meantime such in this respect were our night's quarters. The hut
was well built of slabs split out of fine straight-grained timber,
with hardly a splinter upon them; and consisted of several
compartments, all on the ground floor. The only windows were square
holes in the sides of the hut, and a good log fire was blazing in
the chimney. On stools, and benches, and blocks about the hut sat a
host of wayfarers like ourselves; and several lay at their ease in
corners on their saddlecloths or blankets, whilst saddles and packs
of luggage were heaped up on all sides. Supper was over, and the
short pipes were fuming away in all directions. Our hosts were two
Irishmen, brothers, who had got a little bit of good land cleared
here in the wilderness, and refused nobody a feed and shelter for
the night. They soon put down a couple of quart pots of water
before the blazing fire, made us some tea, and set before us the
usual fare, a piece of fine corned beef, and a wheaten cake baked
on the hearth. And here I should inform the reader how a damper is
made. Flour is mixed up merely with water, and kneaded for about a
couple of minutes; the dough is then flattened out into a cake,
which should never be more than an inch and a half or two inches
thick, and may be of any diameter required; the ashes of the wood,
which is burnt almost everywhere in great profusion, owing to its
plentifulness, are then drawn off the hearth (for the fire is on
the ground, not in a grate) by a shovel; and on the glowing smooth
surface thus exposed the cake is lightly deposited, by being held
over it on the open hands, and the hands suddenly drawn from under
it. The red ashes are then lightly turned back over the cake with
the shovel. In the course of twenty minutes or half an hour, on
removing the ashes, the cake is found excellently baked; and with a
light duster, or the tuft of a bullock's tail, every vestige of the
ashes is switched off, and the cake, if the operations have been
well conducted, comes to table as clean as a captain's biscuit from
a pastry-cook's shop. Merrily sped the couple of hours betwixt our
arrival and going to bed. One sang a song, another told some tale
of the olden time, when but few white men were in the colony,
another repeated the news he had just heard of the bushrangers,
another described a new tract of land he had just found out for a
cattle-run, and others contented themselves with that endless
subject of dissertation among the colonists, the relative
excellences of their working bullocks. My share was to answer all
the questions (rather all that were answerable) which any and all
thought proper to put to me on the subject of affairs in England;
and to pocket with the best grace I could (for most of these men
had been convicts) the jokes they not very sparingly, but I must
say with very good humour, cut on me for having come to the colony
"to make a fortune," or for being "a free object" (subject), or for
having "lagged myself for fear the king should do it for me." All
these little matters notwithstanding, the evening passed away very
pleasantly; if there were many things in these men which I could
not approve, there was much more that I could not but admire. There
was a sort of manly independence of disposition, which secured
truthfulness and sincerity at least among themselves. If the
penalty for the practice of that truthfulness toward the superior
classes had been fixed too high, I felt that allowance ought to be
made for it in estimating their character. Some time before
midnight a general collection of bedding took place, as usual; the
customary belt of bed was constructed all across the hut in front
of the fire; and as in this instance the hut happened to be about
12 or 15 feet across, and we mustered nearly a man to each foot of
the diameter, a very pretty row of capless heads and bare feet soon
displayed themselves beyond the opposite ends of the blanketing. On
blazed the merry fire made up for the night; loud snored those who
were so disposed; and louder grumbled ever and anon those who were
not; hither and thither bounded and barked the dog around the hut,
till he thought his master was asleep, and could no longer take
notice of his vigilance; and dreams came and realities went; and
memory had no more added to her task of the day.</p>

<p>With the dawn all was bustle, for Jem and Pat Geraghty were
early risers and hard workers. The latter of them, poor fellow, was
killed two or three years afterwards by a pistol going off in his
pocket. Many a kind word has there been uttered over his memory by
the traveller when passing the hut where his good-natured voice is
heard no more! Bad habits are easy to learn; and here it was I
recollect the following example: I first lit my pipe as I dressed
myself. The horsemen were not long in finding their horses, for it
is usual for every horseman to carry his hobbles slung on his
horse's neck, and putting them on the beast's forelegs at night
turn him out in the open forest to shift for himself. Most horses
live on grass in this way for months together, and it is almost
incredible what work they can perform. For instance, I have known a
stockman ride his horse sixty or seventy miles a-day, and with
little abatement continue this for five or six days together; the
horse all the time feeding only on grass and stabling in the bush.
Of course I do not mean to state this as the average; I merely cite
it as a single case that came within my knowledge to show what a
horse <i>can</i> do without artificial food and housing. It is
however nothing at all uncommon for a stockman to jog fifty miles a
day for several days together. When turned out for the night the
horses seldom stray far; they are hungry and tired, and like to
make the most of their time on any patch of good grass they come
to. But if a young horse does happen to walk off, he is easily
tracked by the experienced eye of the bushman; and hobbled as he
is, as easily overtaken. It sometimes, however, happens that a
horse breaks his hobble chain, and then good-bye. It may be months
before he is heard of again; by which time he has got hardly
recognizable with good looks, sleek and pursy, and retires into
some snug gully of the mountains, enjoying his leisure with
dignity.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, first one and then another started. Most were
going up the mountain we had come down. A few hundred paces brought
us out on to the sea beach; and here my fellow-traveller taking off
his boots (for the labouring class wear neither stockings nor
socks), began to pace lightly along the wet sand from which the
tide was retreating, and observing how much more easily he seemed
to walk thus than in his half boots, I followed his example, which
proved to be a very good one. Our walk was now for some miles a
most delightful one; here we kept the tide-washed sand; there,
where a long point shot out into the sea, we struck through the
grassy bush across it to the next beach. At length we struck
entirely into the bush, and passing through the most novel and
beautiful scenery made our way toward the Yalla-Lake. In one spot I
recollect we came suddenly on the most beautiful little natural
meadow in the midst of the tall gloomy forest. So green was the
sward and so level the surface that I could not for a long time
yield belief to the assurance that it was not of artificial
construction. It had obtained the name of "<i>Fairy Meadow</i>."*
In other places we passed along avenues overarched with the boughs
of trees and vines, so dense that no sunbeam penetrated; the soil
was damp as in winter, and bare of all herbage. Here for the first
time I saw the lofty cabbage tree, shooting up its slender barrel,
seldom more than a foot in diameter at the height of three feet
from the ground, to a height of 100 or 150 feet, and spreading out
its umbrella-shaped top, swayed to and fro by every breeze. Some of
the creeks we had to pass were rather queer-looking places to be
crossed by such bridges as alone offered themselves. The Mullet
creek where we passed it must have been nearly five and thirty feet
wide; and the bridge was one of these slender cabbage trees grown
on the bank and flung by some bushman or black across the creek
with his axe, either with a view to using it as a bridge or for the
sake of the interior part of the head, which is very similar when
dressed to cabbage, and is a favourite article of food with many. I
confess that it was with no slight trepidation that I made my first
attempt to walk betwixt 30 and 40 feet upon a small round surface,
the middle of which was curved down nearly to the very water's
edge, with its own weight merely, and with the weight of the
passenger was actually under water two or three inches; and which
all the while kept springing and plashing the water at every step
that was taken. But as my guide, who was used to these feats, as I
also soon became, made his way across without expressing any doubt
about my nerve, I scarcely had any alternative but to follow him.
Again pulling off my boots and stockings, I began to edge myself
slowly across sideways, but I quickly found that would never do; I
was nearly gone, when the thought struck me to imagine myself
walking along the joist of an unboarded house, which I was pretty
well used to, and following the thought by the practice I turned
face forward and stepped carelessly and firmly on. I found I could
do it this way very well, only the spot that was under water in the
middle rather baulked me. However, it was but a single step, and
that over I felt myself so bold that I did the remainder with the
utmost assurance. The agility and ease with which the blacks trot
across these cabbage tree bridges is quite astonishing; even the
gins (women) with their pickaninnies on their backs seem to cross
quite at their ease.</p>

<p>[* Originally, I believe, Faro's Meadow.]</p>

<p>We now betook ourselves to a narrow path or track, and following
it at length arrived at a cattle station on the border of the lake,
where a good dinner of hot beef-steaks, bread, and tea was soon set
before us. Here I saw, for the first time, a man (whom I saw many
times afterwards), one of those whose melancholy end is narrated in
the number of Chambers's Tracts upon the subject of Norfolk Island.
He was a merry, free-hearted fellow, still a prisoner of the crown,
and employed by his master in taking care of stock (horned cattle).
And here it may not be out of place to make a few remarks upon this
occupation and the class of men engaged in it. In New South Wales
large settlers possess some thousands of horned cattle; these are
divided into convenient numbers, and stationed in various parts as
their owner may happen to possess land. Each is branded, generally
before six months old; and is then suffered to ramble at large over
the pasture or technically the run assigned to the herd it belongs
to: and these runs are unenclosed. Where, therefore, there are
several of these runs adjoining, the various herds often mingle;
but as one part of the stockman's duty is continually to search up
and restore his cattle to their own run, and as these men always
assist each other, the different herds are kept tolerably distinct.
It however is an unavoidable incident of the system that some get
lost. Either they wander away into the mountains, or die in some
unfrequented creek, or, without design on any one's part, attach
themselves to some passing herd that is shifting its station,
&amp;c. Hence it is impossible to make stockmen accountable for
every beast; especially in some of the mountainous or
mountain-bordered runs; one of which last was that we had arrived
at. It will readily be understood what strong temptation was thus
put in the way of men whose honesty had been subverted by a thief's
life from infancy upwards, to sell an odd beast or two when they
considered they could do so without detection; and it would be a
very imperfect notion of the population of New South Wales that
should fail to include the fact that there are scores of the free
to be met with who are just as ready for a good purchase on the
cross as the bond for a sale. For a beast that would fetch
8<i>l</i>. or 10<i>l</i>. of the butchers in Sydney (who, by the
bye, were at this time not very particular in buying every head
they killed from the right owner), for such a beast the
cross-dealer would give the stockman 3<i>l</i>. or 4<i>l</i>. in
ready dollars. Common sense could not expect the convict stockman,
kept by his master without wages and often most miserably fed and
clad, to remain true to his trust under such temptation. Thus
sometimes a bullock was turned over to the travelling
cattle-jobber: sometimes three or four young calves were driven
away before branding into a snug bight of the mountain and never
brought to light till they were branded with a false brand and
would no longer follow their mothers, and so lead to detection.
Sometimes the brands of beasts, not very remarkable otherwise, were
obliterated by branding with fresh brands; and in latter days it
has been found that sometimes the beast has been thrown and the
branded section of the hide actually flayed off. Let the reader in
short imagine what was likely to take place on a run of perhaps ten
miles each way, inhabited only by ten or twelve convicts in charge
of five or six herds of cattle. This game, it was afterwards known,
was going on pretty smartly at the stations on the Yalla Lake,
where we had arrived; and one of the most active hands in it was
the unhappy fellow I have referred to, who, however, was only
temporarily engaged there. Not knowing all this at the time, I took
a great liking to the man: I may also say that I did not even
suspect him to be a prisoner of the crown. He was well dressed, had
plenty of money, had a good horse at the door, and seemed quite his
own master. As we came in sight of the hut the dogs gave the alarm,
and the stockman belonging to the station came out and kept the
dogs off while we got into the hut. It appeared in the course of a
few minutes that we had disturbed them at a game at cards for <i>a
shilling a game a head</i>. They were all, as I learned afterwards,
still prisoners. On my mate telling them, with reference to me,
that it was "all right," the cards were brought to light again, and
the game went on. Little did I imagine, as that goodnatured,
thoughtless gambler joined the stockman belonging to the hut in
pressing me to eat heartily, and cut his jokes upon the plenitude
of beef they enjoyed in that part of the country,&mdash;little did
I imagine that he would very nearly involve me in the meshes of the
law at a future period; or that I should, many years afterwards,
when hard labour had placed me in independence, read the tale of
his melancholy end in an English periodical, or write these remarks
upon one of the earliest scenes of his fatal career.</p>

<p>The last stage of my journey (the third day's from Sydney) it is
not my intention to describe minutely, as it would lead to too
exact an identification of the spot where it terminated; and that
again would indicate the individual whose job I had undertaken much
too exactly. Suffice it, that that evening we supped in safety at
our journey's destined end.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter IV. Bushrangers as They
Are.</h2>

<p class="newspaper">A splitter's hut and timber&mdash;The face of the
mountain&mdash;Rainy weather in a bark-hut&mdash;Cedarsawyers in
the gullies&mdash;A scene from our
hut&mdash;Bushrangers&mdash;Plunder of the settler's
stores&mdash;Conversation on their return&mdash;Their
departure&mdash;Futile attempt to track them</p>

<p>IN two days' time I had found a fall of timber (as a group of
trees is termed), which, with due information from my quondam
guide, now my mate, I had no doubt would suit my purpose. They were
fine tall black butts, even as a gun-barrel, and as straight in the
grain as a skein of thread. We "tumbled" two or three for trial,
taking off and splitting up a cut the required length of the slabs:
these were to be let into groundplates below and wall-plates above,
all round, to form the sides of the hut. The slabs all ran out
beautifully; you could scarcely tell them from sawed stuff; there
was hardly a splinter on half a dozen of them. When work goes like
this it is rather a pleasure than a toil, and for about another
week or so we went rattling on like sticks a cracking. It was a new
kind of work to me, certainly, but still so similar to what I had
been used to, that I understood <i>how</i> to do every part of it
directly I saw it before me. This is generally the case in a
variation of work where the same tools are still used. We were up
by day-break, worked for about two hours, and then had our
breakfast, which was of damper, salt pork fried, and good
tea,&mdash;for tea and sugar are used among bushmen very
prodigally. My mate and myself often used a pound of tea and six
pounds of sugar between us in a week. The same is the case with
tobacco. I mostly used close on half a pound weekly, till I found
its undermining effect on my constitution, and began to try to
leave it off. After breakfast we pelted away again till twelve
o'clock, and then had dinner, which was damper, pork, and tea
again, and laid down till the heat of the day was over, which was
about three o'clock where we were: we then worked for another hour,
had a lunch of damper, and tea, and pork, and knocked along till
night. About 8 P.M. we had our supper, pork, tea, and damper, and
soon after 9 were under the blankets.</p>

<p>My mate quickly slept; I did not. It soon became quite a custom
to lie and ruminate. Everything was so new and so strange, and I
seemed so independent. These ruminations originated in me habits of
reflection which never left me, and have been serviceable in all my
subsequent life. The spot where we had pitched our tent was a small
grassy forest on the hill side; and everywhere around it, down
below in the endless ravines, and up above towards the
insurmountable heights of the range, was thick tangled brush
growing amidst lofty trees, so thick set that beneath them was
perpetual shadow, or rather something more gloomy still. The ground
was covered with decaying leaves and old water-logged windfall
trees, so rotten that the foot could break its way deep into the
substance of that gnarled wood which at one time would have stopped
a cannonball. Wherever you went, creeks of crystal ice-like water,
plunging down the mountain side, each in its stony bed, kept up a
murmur day and night; never changing save when increased by rains
into the roar of a torrent. This mountain, or, more properly, heap
of mountains, ran down, where we were at work, nearly into the sea,
and for many miles every way the character of the vegetation was as
I have described. Here and there certainly a little patch of grassy
forest would assert a place for itself on the shoulder of a hill,
and partly down the side; but generally the entire surface of this
mountain, for many miles up and down the coast every way, was
clothed with this thick brush; besides which so irregular and
broken and confused was the surface of the range itself that even
the best bushmen felt timid of committing themselves to it. Thus,
in one of these little grassy forests in the midst of the bush, on
the shoulder of an easy ridge about two miles back from the sea,
and so far up that we could see the sea like a broadish sheet of
water below us, was pitched our little hut. It was no more than a
few sheets of the bark that we had stripped off our black butts,
leaned together, top to top, tent like, with one end stopped by
another sheet, and the fire a few feet in front on the ground at
the other. Here we had been, say ten days, when it began to rain;
and, as is the case generally at this season of the year in
Australia, when it sets in for a week's rain, it rained with a
will. I began to be initiated into the disasters of a bush life.
The rain came through the roof of the hut as if we had been making
arrangements in its favour; and no sooner had we stopped it there
than, coming down the hill, it began to run through the bottom of
the hut like a mill-stream; and as we had, in our confidence of
fine weather, laid our beds on the ground, they got thoroughly
soaked. Scarcely had we in the pouring rain dug a trench round the
back of our hut, to turn the water, when we found the rain had put
the fire out; and as we happened to have come out without
tinder-box, flint and steel (an omission for which, when a more
practised bushman, I should never have forgiven myself), Dick had
to go to the farm to get one. When he came back it was dark and
still raining, and I, in my inexperience, had not been mindful to
get any dry wood; which he had then to take his axe and get as well
as he could in the dark. Had I been left to seek it, I suppose my
search would have been a long one, but Dick went straight to a tree
whose butt the bush-fires had hollowed out, and soon knocked off a
lot of dry splinters from the inside. Nobody but he who has
experienced it has any comprehension of the enjoyment of supper
when it does come after these bush troubles throughout some dismal
rainy day, and of that nerve-tuning smoke, when supper is over,
that puts an end to even the bare recollection of them.</p>

<p>And here I must tell the reader that we were not altogether
alone in these savage solitudes. As I have already hinted, the
costly and fragrant cedar was at this time a common forest tree in
the shady recesses and beside the cool stony creeks of this vast
old mountain. When I add that at the time of which I write, nearly
a hundred pair of sawyers had gradually come down from Sydney and
gathered into this mountain, and were (as they also continued to be
for years afterwards) slaughtering away in all directions, it will
not be wondered at that the pride of the Five Island Cedar Brush is
long since gone; and especially when it is considered that no more
is done by the brush-sawyer than just to break the logs down into
planks, many of which contain four, five, six hundred square feet.
These logs being then freighted to Sydney and on to England are cut
up in timber-yards as they are wanted. It is far from unlikely,
reader, that the very table thou art now reading on is a part of
the thewes and sinews of one of these stately gallants of my old
mountain woods. Meantime imagine that, scattered at various
distances from us all over the seaward side of the range where the
cedar grows, were these hundred pairs of sawyers, each pair
(usually) having its one or two labourers or axe-men, whose
business was to save the sawyers' time by falling the trees,
crosscutting them into logs, building scaffold-pits, making roads
and bridges, and helping at any heavy lifts. Some of these gangs
were within less distance of us than the farm was, but there was no
road from their huts to ours, and to travel the cedar-brush in the
twilight of a rainy day is next to impossible. So my mate had gone
to the farm. Another point was, that Dick was nearly due for his
ticket of leave (a permission given by government to well-behaved
convicts to work for themselves several years before their sentence
expires); and as at this period great numbers of the labourers
employed by these sawyers were bushrangers, and to have been known
to have had any communication with such would have caused the
forfeiture of his ticket, poor Dick was very cautious of going
where any of them were. He had seen a deal of trouble, and, I
firmly believe, would rather have gone twenty miles another way for
a firestick than half a mile to where there was a bushranger.</p>

<p>The reader may suppose this first wet day over, and may imagine
it going on patter, patter, patter all night, as we lay not very
comfortably on our wet beds, with, however, the dry side turned
upwards, and all the old clothes and blankets we could spare laid
on the top to keep the damp from soaking up to us: and he may
suppose the next day passing and passed; our fire kept good; our
pipes filled and emptied again, and again, and again; several extra
pots of tea drank out of a sheer want of occupation; and ourselves
venturing out two or three times in the course of the day to look
if it were likely to clear up, but discerning nothing with our eyes
but trees upon trees below, around, above, with an occasional
little column of smoke curling slowly up from where they were
freshening the fire at some sawyer's gunyah in a gully; and feeling
no breath of air, but only the constant sprinkle of the rain; and
hearing nothing but the sudden dead crash down of the big limb of
some fast decaying tree breaking off soddened and overweighted by
the wet; or it might be at distant intervals a something like the
low harsh sound of the sea rattling the pebbles of a pebbly beach a
little down in the woody depth to the left, but as faint and soon
gone as the sigh of the dying. And, furthermore, let the reader
suppose the day closed, supper over, a good pile of logs on the
fire for the night (over which by this time we had got a couple of
sheets of bark placed so as to turn the rain), a cheerful blaze
mounting silently upwards, and us in bed.</p>

<p>Arrived at this stage, let me caution my reader not to expect
from the title of this chapter some dismal record of a night of
horrors. My object in this publication is to convey an idea of
facts as they occur in Australian every-day life; in short, to
correct the erroneous statements that are abroad, not to add to
them. I spent nearly twenty years of a bushlife in New South Wales,
during the whole of which time I never sustained the slightest
bodily injury from a bushranger; nor did I ever suffer from
aggression of higher enormity than some slight theft. So that when,
since my return to England, I have met with the tales that are so
prevalent respecting their sanguinary acts, I have always felt them
to be virtually exaggerations. The insulated facts might be true
enough, but then they are the exceptions, not the usual custom; and
this should have been stated in the narration of them, otherwise
that impression comes to be attached to every-day life which really
and properly belongs only to its rarest and merest exceptions.</p>

<p>It might be about half-past ten, but was not more than eleven
o'clock, my mate snoring as usual, I thinking over the novel world
around me, when I suddenly heard, first the clatter of horses' feet
on a stony corner of the hill just above us, and then the voices of
men talking; and the dog, which was a rare old fellow of the bull
breed, rushed off almost without stopping to open his eyes in the
direction the sound came from; the next instant I heard him at bay,
and then came a volley of oaths that if we did not call off the
dog, the speaker would shoot him. Of course I jumped out of bed and
ran out in front of the hut and called the dog in; but Bully knew
his customers better than I did, and not a foot would he come away;
and I could hear him plunging about in the brush trying to get an
opportunity to lay hold. By this time Dick was awake and out with
me, and snatching up a fire-stick he went directly to where the dog
was barking, and I followed him. We found him darting round four
men and two pack-horses, who had got within about a hundred yards
of the hut before Bully checked them, but had ever since halted,
having quite as much as they could do to take care of the calves of
their legs. On our reaching them, one of the men, a little short
fellow as broad as he was long, said, "Now, my lads, call off your
dog unless you want him shot; we don't want to do you any harm, but
we want a guide, and one we mean to have:" at the same time that he
said this, however, he covered me with his piece, and one of his
pals (companions), seeing this, did the same by my mate. Necessity,
wherever it shows its head, is your only lawgiver, so we complied
without the least hesitation; and Bully once called off and ordered
away to the hut fire, took no further active part in the affair
beyond every now and then manifesting a quite uncontrollable
inclination to sneak up towards one or other of our visitors'
legs.</p>

<p>The custom of the bush led to our immediately putting down three
quart pots of water (we had not a fourth) to make tea for them, and
they filled and lit their pipes, but nothing particular was said on
either side; for I had come to the conclusion that they were
bushrangers from their arms and the meanness of their dress, and
their unshaven beards, whilst they on their part seemed to think it
quite unnecessary to give us any explanation whatever. At length
the short man who was the former spokesman said, "How far is it to
your cove's?" (master's.) "About a mile and a half," my mate
answered; "but the road is very bad of a night&mdash;there is no
beaten track, only a marked tree line;" (it is the custom in new
countries to take a good-sized chip, say as large as a sheet of
note paper, out of both sides of trees within easy sight of each
other, and that range true along the shortest line to any place
whither it is desired to make a road:) "we just marked the line the
day we came out here to split, but there's no beaten track."</p>

<p>"Well, one of you knows it well enough to find it in the dark;
we have been told so by them that know in the mountains."</p>

<p>"My mate," said Dick, "is hardly a month in the country."</p>

<p>"Oh! we know that; he's one of the free objects&mdash;bad luck
to 'em! what business have they here in the prisoners' country? But
after all, it's prisoners that's worse to one another than these
emigrants are to them."</p>

<p>"To be sure," said another; "there's bad and good of all sorts,
mate. I never think a bit worse of a man for being of one country
than for being of another; there's bad and good of all sorts as
there is of all religions. If you act as a man, lad (addressing
me), you will be respected by every man that knows himself, let you
be free or bond."</p>

<p>"Well," continued the first spokesman to Dick, "if you are
&mdash;&mdash;'s government man, we are told you know every inch of
this bush, and you must go with us and show us your cove's farm; we
want to see what he's got in his stores. There was a boat load for
him at the boat-harbour last week, for I saw it landed; has he got
any of the grog left?"</p>

<p>These few words supplied a link in my mind. I thought from the
first I had seen this short sailor-looking man before, and now I
recollected to have noticed him among the sawyers at the
boat-harbour a few days previously. At this period the little
horse-shoe bay that constituted &mdash;&mdash; boat-harbour often
presented a scene more like what may be imagined to belong to a
pirate's isle than anything else. It was a little bay with a sandy
beach, backed by a flat covered with grass, flags, and herbs, which
again gave way to thick brush, and not very far off began the rise
of the range. On this green sward might be seen, sometimes, half a
dozen groups, each gathered round a keg of rum, often of ten,
seldom of less than five gallons; for the boats which came for the
cedar plank generally brought for the various pairs of sawyers, who
supplied the freights, kegs to order. A more unlicensed and
reckless mob than was thus sometimes gathered on that else lonely
beach, prolonging day and night their carousal until all the liquor
was gone, it would be impossible to find anywhere. The bushrangers
often mingled with the boisterous assembly, and took their tithe of
the revel; the police at this time rarely penetrated hither in
search of them, and if they had done so it would have been with but
small success, for nobody was inclined to aid them. Partly this was
because the bushrangers laboured for the sawyers at a lower rate
than other men could, partly because a bush-working man is always
from his solitary situation quite at the mercy of the bushranger,
and partly because, having mostly been prisoners themselves, it was
a point of honour among the sawyers to help them as much as they
could. In the lawless scene of Bacchanalianism that I had witnessed
a few evenings before, when I had run down to the boat-harbour to
ascertain if some things I expected from Sydney had come in Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;'s boat, I now recollected that I had seen our
present guest, and truly enough, as he said, by the same boat
(schooners and sloops chiefly carry on this trade) had come down
from Sydney for my employer a large keg of rum, another of wine, a
basket of tobacco, a couple of chests of tea, and some bags of
sugar, besides blankets and clothing; and this was the luggage for
their share of which our visitors had brought the two
pack-horses.</p>

<p>It was with great reluctance that poor Dick submitted to make
the inevitable acknowledgment that there was indeed safe lodged in
the stores at the farm this object of their marauding journey. He,
however, endeavoured to make the best of his predicament by
bargaining that he should not be taken within sight of the house,
promising to wait faithfully at the corner of the fence until their
end was attained, to conduct them back again the same way; and it
appeared they had another guide a little way off in the bush,
behind our hut, who would not come forward, and who was to take
them back to a spot they were better acquainted with in the
mountain. Probably this was some free man, working near, who was in
league with them; such things are too often known in this
colony.</p>

<p>The tea was some time boiling, so one of them proposed to have
it in coming back, and the others agreeing, they left one in charge
of me, which was quite unnecessary, for I could not have found my
way from our hut to another by myself at that time of night. They
then set off. From my mate's account afterwards, I learned that on
arriving at the farm they left him according to promise at the
corner of the paddock fence, but with his hands tied to a rail, in
the midst of the pouring rain, and went on to the master's hut by
themselves. They got close up to it before the dogs barked, and
when they did bark that was all, for they were mostly young dogs
and sound sleepers, and not much good as watch dogs. A knock at the
door summoned Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, who was told some travellers who
had lost their way were in want of shelter. But the improbability
of travellers being lost at that time of a pouring rainy night, in
a part where it was almost impossible to get off the high road for
the thickness of the brush on each side, with the peremptory tone
in which the demand was made, raised his suspicions, and he civilly
declined to let them in. This at once provoked them to throw off
the mask, and he was told to open the door in such terms as left
him no further prudent plea for refusal. Attempting resistance no
longer, he unbarred the door, and the marauders then despatched one
of their number to the government men's hut to keep guard over them
with a loaded piece, whilst the remaining two helped themselves to
whatever they pleased from the stores. They conducted their
operations like men of business; went straight about what they had
determined to do; and when it was done, lingered not a minute on
the premises. On going away they told the cove they should leave a
man on the look-out, in the bush at the edge of the farm; and if he
offered to stir a step himself, or send any of his men for help
until eight o'clock in the morning, it would be a bad job for him.
This, however, was all bounce. About two o'clock, or a little
after, the man who had been left at our hut with me, on hearing our
dog bark, ordered me to call him off, giving at the same time that
shrill clear coo-eeh which the whites have learnt from the blacks,
and which conveys the human voice to so great a distance. I think I
have made myself heard with it, of a still night, nearly a mile
off. This bushranger's, however, was purposely restrained, and
modulated so as to be barely audible at the little distance he
supposed his pals to be off; in another minute the short
sailor-looking man came lightly and sharply up, into the light of
the fire, as a sort of advanced guard, and finding all square, he
repeated the coo-eeh in a more careless manner, and presently the
other two with Dick and the pack-horses came up. Without the
smallest appearance of trepidation or want of composure, the tall
man walked up to the fire, put a coal on the top of his pipe, and
began to draw away, saying to me, "Come, lad, now let's have this
tea; I'm sure we've earned it." I said nothing, for I really did
not know what to say; but I sweetened the three pots of tea for
them, and put down, on the little stool we used for a table, our
damper and a piece of corned pork, which, for a change, we had
boiled before going to bed; and after they had had a short whiff of
the pipe apiece, they pulled out their knives and helped themselves
to a good junk of bread and meat each. During their meal, the man
who was left with me, and who, I should have mentioned, had
employed himself for a very busy half-hour of his watch in stowing
away some of our eatables and drinkables, inquired what luck they
had had.</p>

<p>"Luck, lad," said my long friend, "why, the very best of luck;
there's a couple of five gallon kegs full of the right stuff slung
across Old Bobby, and half a dozen pair of blankets spread over all
to keep any water from getting to it; besides a coil of Brazil
tobacco between the kegs, as long as all the running rigging of a
schooner: and on the mare we've got about sixty weight of sugar and
twenty pounds of tea, a nice little bag of flour, I dare say eighty
pounds or more, and a few slops."</p>

<p>"Any boots?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lad. I didn't forget you. There's a pair tucked into the
mouth of the flour-bag. They're just your fit. I saw them just as I
was putting the flour on the horse, and I looked every way for some
more, but it was no go. The fat fellow's got a pair for himself,
though," he said; at the same time that the individual whom I have
described before as having been at the boat harbour, held out one
of his feet, displaying a snug Wellington boot of Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;'s.</p>

<p>"I don't believe," he said, "the poor beggar's got another pair
to put on to go to court in: he'll have to ride down to Wollongong
to fetch the lobsters (soldiers) in his stockings' feet."</p>

<p>"Well, be alive, mates," said he who had remained with me; "we
shall be none too soon into the mountain. It'll soon be daylight,
and if we don't give the rain time to wash out the horsetracks we
shall be done like a dinner. I shall get out these boots and ding
(throw away) mine, for I can't walk any farther in them."</p>

<p>The speaker accordingly proceeded, after shaking the logs
together so as to make a stronger blaze, to where the mare was
quietly picking a few mouthfuls of grass; and, leading her to the
fire, he undid the fastenings, and lifting off the bag of flour,
brought to light the coveted boots, a pair of common lace-ups.
Knocking the flour out of them, he soon had them on his feet,
evidently esteeming them a treasure, as they no doubt must have
been on those stony ranges, and among so much broken wood, in the
dark. After a minute's experiment of their fit and feel, he broke
out into a torrent of burlesque gratitude to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,
for having brought him the "fine boots all the way from Sydney." It
was perfectly impossible to resist the current of drollery with
which the scamp carried on this farcical exhibition for several
minutes. His companions laughed, and then I laughed, and at last
poor Dick, shivering as he was with the cold and wet, joined the
irresistible peal till the tears came in our eyes all round.</p>

<p>It is, I suppose, a property of laughter to reconcile people,
for I found after this was over that much of my ill-feeling towards
these fellows was gone; and when they drew out a bottle that they
had taken care to provide for the night, because the kegs would be
difficult to get at, and poured out about a couple of glasses for
each in turn, I could not help drinking with them, wishing them at
the same time "some better kind of life." At length they packed all
up snug again, lit their pipes, gave us very particular
injunctions, and struck off into the bush, the rain still falling
in torrents. Before they were long gone we heard their suppressed
<i>coo-eeh</i>, which we supposed to be the signal for the guide
they had boasted they had in waiting for them at a few hundred
yards off in the brush. Dick had come off worst of the lot. He had
been tied by the wrists to a rail of the fence, and left there
during the whole time the bushrangers were ransacking the master's
hut, a full hour and a half. It was a southerly gale that was
blowing, and the spot where he stood was exposed to its full sweep
from the sea. I wondered how he could stand it so long. He told me
that, after standing still for about a quarter of an hour, watching
the lights moving about at the hut as the bushrangers carried on
their search, his teeth began to chatter, and the cold, as he
expressed it, began to get to his heart; whereupon he set to
dancing to keep himself warm, which he did very industriously, with
short intervals, for more than an hour, till he was untied. And
surely enough so we found the next day that he had, which indeed
was the means of preventing the poor fellow getting flogged and
losing his long-expected ticket of leave; for the horses were
tracked to and from our hut, notwithstanding the rain; and Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;'s rage at his loss, which was about twenty pounds,
was such that I really believe he would have given another twenty
to have criminated either the unfortunate fellow who had already
been so ill used or myself. The commandant, who was a magistrate
also, came up from Wollongong the next day, and he soon saw that we
were both entirely guiltless. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; would not so much
as listen to Dick's protestations and defence of himself; but the
shrewdness and tact of the commandant (who, however, was one out of
a thousand of his cloth) very soon extricated us from all
difficulty and suspicion. He said, "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, if they
tied up the government man, it is not likely they left the free man
at liberty: and whether they did tie up the government man, as he
says, we can soon ascertain; for a man could not caper about in a
pair of heavy boots, as your man says he did, on one spot for a
good hour on such a night without making a pretty good puddle."
Examination at once affirmed poor Dick's veracity; there was a hole
full of water there six inches deep; so the matter, as far as we
were concerned, dropped. Our great error was, forgetting in our
confusion that the bushrangers' passing our hut, both in going and
coming, was likely to fix suspicion of participation on us, we had
neglected to go in and report the whole affair just as it happened,
before the tracks were run down. This was Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s
grand problem. "If we were not in league with them," he said, "why
had we not come in directly they were gone, or at least at
daybreak, and reported all about it?" We, on our part, who did not
know that the bushrangers had given him such forcible directions
not to move out of his hut till eight o'clock, continued expecting
him out at our hut every minute till breakfast-time, cautiously
adhering ourselves to the no less stringent instructions left us.
At the same time we might, no doubt, have gone in without incurring
any risk; for they would scarcely have left one of their party
behind to watch us in a part of the bush they all knew so little of
as to require a guide. Their <i>ruse</i> was altogether a very
complete one, if indeed it did not partake as much of fortunate
accident as of able intention. In coming and going their track
varied little up to a certain creek; but this creek they had both
come out of and gone into again at an identical spot. It was a fine
level-channelled creek, generally not above six inches deep and
perhaps twelve feet wide, and very clear of fallen timber for a
brush-creek. With these rains, however, it was running about
eighteen inches deep; nevertheless they had kept its channel, so
far as we could judge, for a full half-mile to where a main
cedar-road crossed it; for nowhere could we find anything that
looked like tracks up the bank out of it, either before reaching
this road or afterwards; and if they took this main road, all their
tracks on it must have been completely obliterated by nine o'clock
in the morning; for not only was it, as most cedar brush-roads are,
from the richness of the soil, one long ditchlike line of sludge
and water, but by nine o'clock six or seven cedar-drays, each drawn
by two or three yoke of bullocks, had passed along it; and as there
were no blacks nigh at hand to search the bush for the continuance
of the tracks, and the rain still kept falling in torrents all next
day, every trace of their point of departure from the main
cedar-road, which they had in all probability taken at the creek,
was no doubt entirely obliterated before the next morning.</p>

Cedar-Brush.</h2>

<p class="newspaper">The site for a settler's hut&mdash;How to erect a good
hut&mdash;Settlers' shop-keeping&mdash;Termination of
job&mdash;Fresh journey in search of work&mdash;Beginning to saw in
the
Cedar-brush&mdash;Cedar-wood&mdash;Cedar-cutting&mdash;Cedar-sawyers
described&mdash;Dangerous trip by sea</p>

<p>THE adventure related in the last chapter was the only one of
the kind we met with while we were getting our stuff, which was
about two months. The succeeding three months again were taken up
in erecting the building, which, as it may be an object of some
curiosity to the English reader, I shall briefly describe. Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;'s farm was close to a saltwater inlet lying between
two low flats, in their natural state covered with a perfectly
impervious brush. The soil was of the richest description. On each
side of this low tract the country was very mountainous, and in
some places timbered with fine tall forest trees; in others, clad
with brush and scrub. Where the foot of one of these ranges ran
down with an easy slope into the flat, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; had fixed
his first huts; and, as the point of the hill altogether contained
three or four acres, there was plenty of room for the new buildings
as well as the old. At the most elevated spot he had had about an
acre and a half cleared and stumped for the erection of his new
house. Thus it stood in a little hollow square, backed and flanked
on each side by the forest, and looking down from the front on the
old farm buildings and the cultivated land. It was some thirty-five
feet in length by twenty in depth. Like all bush-houses it was only
one story high, and, like almost all, had a verandah in front of
about six feet deep. The first step of its erection was digging
post-holes, of about two feet deep, at various distances round the
circumference, and along the interior divisions, in which were
placed posts ten feet high, squared on the four sides with the axe,
excepting the two feet let into the ground, where the whole
strength of the timber was left. Along the ground between these, as
well as along the tops, wherever there was to be a wall, were laid
ground-plates and wall-plates, of about the same size, and squared
on the sides facing each other, and having a groove of about an
inch and a half wide and two inches deep mortised into the flat
sides their whole length. Into these grooves were fitted the two
ends of the eight-feet slabs we had split with the maul and wedges.
The roof was made much in the usual way, only, being for some time
to come to continue covered with bark, the battens were not put so
close together as they would have been if the roof had had to be
shingled. The flooringboards, according to the custom of the
country, were six inches wide and one thick; timber being used so
green, and the heat being so great, boards of any greater width
turn up at the edges, so as in time to look like a row of spouts.
The rooms were all joisted at top, and on the joists was spread a
floor of bark, so as to form, over the whole top of the house, the
settler's usual first rude granary. Squares of a couple of feet
each way were left open in the wall in various places for windows;
at present, however, they were only fitted with shutters. The
chimneys were large, like those of old farm-houses, and, for
security, had a little wall of rough stone and mortar run up inside
about three feet; and in the middle of the fire-place was a large
flag-stone, of a sort capable of resisting the fire, which
constituted the hearth and baking-place. This, of course, is only a
general outline, and that portion of the work which really consumed
the smallest portion of the time.</p>

<p>Many things occurred during the performance of my contract to
make me very much dissatisfied with my employer; but I should not
be acting fairly if I were to omit adding that the experience and
reflection of later years have led me to consider them rather the
faults of a particular class of Australian institutions than of the
man. The Australian settler undertakes, as a matter of course, to
supply his labourers with rations; but he never thinks there is the
slightest obligation on himself to make that supply a constant one.
Sometimes there is no tea, sometimes no sugar, sometimes no
tobacco. When it suits his convenience to look after a fresh
supply, he does so; otherwise all the free men on the farm may
leave their work and lose their time in going ten or twenty miles
to get it for themselves; and on men who are very much the slaves
of tobacco or tea or sugar this bears in some cases very
heavily.</p>

<p>But the work was at length completed; and after some days of
what I considered very unnecessary delay, the chief of which Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; spent in walking round and round, and in and out his
new habitation, and looking at it from all mentionable distances
and at all possible angles, I got a cheque for the balance due to
me, 43<i>l</i>.</p>

<p>I now, for the first time, found myself up the country without a
job. The immediate question was, what to do next. At length it
struck me that if I did as others did, whatever they got I should
get. It was now near winter, and having disposed of such of my
tools as I could not well carry with me, I set off one morning
after breakfast for the more settled parts of the country. My route
lay partly along the sea beach, and partly through the tangled and
gloomy masses of the cedar-brush. I felt very forlorn at starting;
but the load of tools, and clothes, and provisions, was really so
serious a matter that it presently outbalanced the weight
within.</p>

<p>I felt that if I meant to get to &mdash;&mdash; to supper, I
must betake myself to my heels instead of my head: so after
settling my load as comfortably as I could, I walked off in good
earnest for my destination. About noon I got to a sawyer's hut in
the very middle of the brush, where I had been told it would be
best for me to stop and have my dinner. No work was going on; only
the dog greeted me with some lusty growls as I came up. It was a
tent hut, thatched with the fanlike leaves of the cabbage tree;
open at one end, with the fire in front. On coming up to the fire,
I could see the only occupant of the hut for the time was the dog
who stood in the entrance, and very plainly told me I must come no
farther. I therefore contented myself with unslinging my load,
filling my quart pot at the creek below, freshening up the fire,
and taking possession of the back of it for my kitchen; to which
arrangement my four-legged friend offered no further resistance.
When I had had my dinner and was just about to shoulder my load and
start again, two little boys came, barefooted, along a track out of
the bush. These were the sons of the sawyer that the hut and pit
belonged to. They told me their father was gone round among the
other pits to look for a mate; after which, dismissing Ponto very
summarily with something not much short of a broken back, they made
me come in. By this time I was quite cool, and felt so stiff with
having overweighted myself, that I was inwardly consulting whether
I had not better make three days' stage of my journey, stopping
where I was for the night; which, always feeling much more at home
in the company of children than in any other, I was not long in
determining to do. The shadows of evening take possession of the
cedar-brush an hour and a half earlier than they do of the open
country; especially in the deep, winding, hollow ways of the
ravines of the coast mountain; a little within the entrance of one
of which was the hut. The lads' father came home between three and
four o'clock, by which time it was getting very dusk. He was a
merry, strong Lancashire man: his wife had been dead some years;
and he had brought up these two little boys in the wild brush all
by himself, except that he always had a mate for his work. The
consequence was, that the little chaps at nine and ten years of age
could take their axe and fall a moderate sized tree as well as any
sawyer's labourer in the brush. In the course of the evening when
he found out that I was tolerably handy with timber tools of one
sort and another, he made an offer of taking me for a mate, which
offer I immediately accepted: the next day saw us at work. He was
in the midst of a very good fall of timber; but the ground was so
rough and thickly wooded that we had to build a fresh pit to almost
every tree. These pits were merely scaffold side-strikes lodged on
posts against trees, with long easy skids leading up to them for
pitting the log. Sometimes six inches or even a foot of earth might
be excavated; but to have dug regular ground pits would have been
much too tedious a job; besides which in many places it was so
rocky that it would have been impossible. Usually the pits were
made very solid; but at other times I felt, I must acknowledge, not
quite easy while working under a log of two or three tons weight
lodged on side-strikes so small and limber that they sprang up and
down two or three inches at every stroke of the saw. Some of these
trees were noble-looking objects, with their great spurs running
out at the butt like the buttresses of a castle; and when one of
them fell before the axe, what a body of timber it crushed down
before it, and what an opening it made in the brush! It was seldom
we cross-cut the logs off longer than ten or twelve feet, but our
planks were sometimes a couple of feet square on the end, or three
and four feet in depth, by six, eight, or ten inches in thickness.
These planks were always taken out on either one side or the other
of the heart, that part of the log being too porous and spongy for
use. As the various planks came off the pit, they were rolled over
into one large stack in some convenient spot a few feet off; and
when the whole tree was cut up, this heap was covered over with
cabbage tree leaves, on the outside, to protect the timber from the
weather. The wood of the trees generally where we were cutting was
very flowery and variegated, and the colour very good: when first
cut, nothing could exceed the splendid crimson of some of the
planks. There is a very fragrant scent from it, of which, however,
a person working among it soon ceases to be sensible. Another
singular and beautiful peculiarity is, the flame it yields in
burning. Laying on the fire of a night sometimes a heavy outside
slab in its green state, I used to observe it, as it were, melt
gradually away in an almost imperceptible flame of indescribably
beautiful pink; the flame itself looking more like mere light than
fire.</p>

<p>We used to get up in the winter and have our breakfast before
going to work, on account of the day being so short in the
cedar-brush. But when we did begin to work it was pretty solid
eye-balling. A cedar-sawyer's cuts are very deep, and a deep cut
makes the saw move stiff. Again the lifts in a cedar-brush are very
heavy. I have often worked for half a day together with a lever
that I could barely lift into its place. Besides this, the only
intermission through the day is one hour at noon for dinner, and
perhaps twenty minutes towards the latter part of the afternoon,
fifteen of which the topman employs in brightening up his saw, and
the pitman in boiling a couple of pots of tea, and throwing the
dust out of his pit; the other five are occupied in a very active
lunch. Both men, if they are smokers, just light their short pipes
and turn to with them in their mouths. If any man can without
exaggeration at night say he is as tired as a dog after a hard
day's run, it is the cedar-sawyer. A striking peculiarity of the
class is their colour, or rather deficiency of all colour. A few
months' residence and hard work in the brush leaves most men as
pallid as corpses. Probably this is chiefly the effect of shade,
but promoted further by excessive perspiration; for it is not
necessarily attended by any sensation of illness.</p>

<p>It is during the three or four evening hours that elapse after
his work that the sawyer enjoys himself. The success of the day,
the prospect of a good cutting or an advantageously shaped log on
the morrow, the pleasant perfume of the pipe, the cheering pot of
tea again and again repeated, with each new yarn, or joke, or
laugh, the busy and pompous excursions and barkings of the dog, the
pattering shower, the clouds of fireflies that dance along in their
countless angular courses where the cold stream tumbles among great
stones in the bed of the creek&mdash;such are the objects which
occupy his senses and his thoughts; and it were well that all
things that can occupy our attention and our thoughts had as little
in them to excite unwise desires or fears.</p>

<p>In much about the same time that I had been occupied about my
last job, this also came to a close, by my mate having finished up
cutting the quantity of timber he had contracted for with a Sydney
timber merchant. All the time we were cutting, our employer had
bullocks and teams drawing the plank down to the boat harbour, and
boats conveying it to Sydney; so that we had no more to do than go
aboard after our last boat load was shipped, and proceed with it to
Sydney. Our voyage was not one of the most agreeable possible; but
the unpleasant circumstance of it is such a very common one with
these little coasting boats (sloops and schooners), that common
consent among the parties usually concerned seems to have decreed
that it is not to be at all gravely treated. When we were some
considerable distance on our voyage, it came on to blow a perfect
hurricane off shore, and it was not until it had done so for two
days and two nights that we could again venture to steer for Port
Jackson. According to the custom of these reckless men they had no
compass on board, and had started without refilling their
water-keg, and with no more in it than remained from the last trip.
To the boatmen, I suppose, use had become a second nature; but both
my mate and I agreed, that as it was our first, so it should be our
last treat of the sort. I never went on board one of these small
craft again for a coast trip, however short, without seeing that
there was both compass and water-keg aboard. My sufferings during a
portion of the four days we were at sea, although what water we had
was carefully apportioned out both as to quantity and time, were
such as I cannot describe.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter VI. The Rocks.</h2>

<p class="newspaper">A sly grog-seller's den&mdash;Dennis
M'Carthy&mdash;Gamblers&mdash;Ruffianism in its glory&mdash;An
unfortunate's tale, and death&mdash;Black scorpions&mdash;The
Sand-hills, or the grave yard of Sydney&mdash;A word on
prostitution, and its remedy&mdash;Desperadoes of the Rocks&mdash;A
narrow escape</p>

<p>To our unspeakable joy at dawn of the second day after we had
headed our boat toward land, and the fourth after the breeze came
on, a darker and more uneven margin line was described from our
deck for some length along the western horizon, through the thin
grey air of the morning. It was plainly enough land, and was just
where we expected it; but it turned out that we had got down much
farther to the southward than we had reckoned we were&mdash;so we
had to run the same track of coast up again. It was not till past
midnight that we made our way good into Port Jackson and dropped
anchor off the market wharf (of Sydney), where the timber and
fire-wood boats unload. Thirsty as we were, we were not long in
putting our dingy out and going ashore to where a little spring
oozed out of the rock that walls the back of the wharf platform.
There each man slaked his thirst with not a whit less haste than
good fellowship demanded; for only one at a time could drink. Our
next movement was to a house on the rocks much frequented by
boatmen, and known as "The Sheer Hulk," already mentioned. It was
kept at this time by a man of the name of D &mdash;&mdash;, a
convict free by servitude (so convicts are designated whose term of
sentence has expired), as a lodging house for sailors. He had a
partner in the speculation who still further cloaked the character
of the house by putting up a barber's pole at the door. There is no
doubt nevertheless that such a nest would have been rooted out long
before but for the handsome "sweeteners" (bribes) which old D
&mdash;&mdash;'s profits enabled him to give the constables. At
this time almost every constable in Sydney and indeed in the colony
had been a prisoner of the crown; I believe there were two or three
old soldiers in the force, but their principles were not a whit
superior, so far as I heard and observed, to those of the convict
class. These sly grog shops sold rum only, or rather grog; though,
adulterated as it was, it hardly deserved even that name. The trade
of the Sheer Hulk was often a couple of gallons a night at
1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per half pint, or by gross receipts about
2<i>l.</i> Of this 2<i>l.</i> it possibly cost old D &mdash;&mdash;
10<i>s.</i> or 12<i>s.</i> for rum, a few pence for burnt sugar,
the same for tobacco, which together with the water (and some said
a dash of vitriol) made up the beverage. At this period in Sydney a
sly grog seller could always afford to pay the fine, heavy as it
was, out of his profits for three months; and the police then were,
and I suppose are, always pretty considerate on these points; they
know they cannot skin a flint, and avoid expending their exertions
and the magistrate's time on fine cases where the grand element of
the case, the cash, is wanting. Thus sly grog sellers at the period
I describe used quite to reckon how long the police would let them
alone before laying an information. It struck two as we crossed the
high bare green by the windmill above St. Philip's church, and
walked or rather tumbled and climbed alternately along Gloucester
Street to our destination. At this time there could hardly be said
to be a street; it was merely the space between two straggling
lines of houses ranged along the side of a very rough rocky
declivity, and these were turning their backs or their sides or
their faces toward each other, as one would say houses could do
only in a convict colony.</p>

<p>The noise of the carousal we began to hear when we were within
about a hundred yards of the Sheer Hulk might fairly have led to
the belief that there was nothing there to be concealed from the
police, particularly as one old constable in his blue coat and red
collar stood bâton under arm at the corner of Frazer's Lane
listening to it in all the appearance of serene reflectiveness.
Full a score of voices were singing each its own song in its own
tune and its own time. Now there was a bellowing volley of men's
voices, then sounds such as the voices of women can make only from
the stimulus of intoxicating drink. It was a perfect frenzy of
drunken vociferation. From the lofty terraced ledge of rock along
which we walked we could see the dark blue waters of the harbour,
all life, as a strong tide came flooding, dancing, glittering in
under the beams of the full moon. At times in Australia the moon
may be seen to look perfectly globular to the naked eye, and so it
was to-night. No two things ever were in greater contrast than the
sounds within and the scene without. My companions were less
curious in such contrasts than myself, I suppose; for while I was
standing with my back to the door, half determining not to go in,
the preliminary of "giving the office" (token) had been gone
through; we had been scrutinized through the slightly open door,
and my companions being recognised as "old hands," it was thrown
open, and without further ado in we went. Slap went to the door,
and down went the heavy bar; and there we stood in an atmosphere of
tobacco smoke within a large, low, dilapidated, half-lit room, with
benches affixed to the walls all round except where there was a
door or chimney; in front of these benches were long narrow greasy
dark tables covered with glasses and pipes; and on the outside of
these again, rude wooden forms. In the farthest corner sat old
Dennis M'Carthy in his old red soldier's jacket and one-eyed
spectacles. Industriously as if he had had to live some three score
years to come, this singular old man used to mend shoes all day
long, and as industriously employ his evenings and his nights at
his favourite game of "all fours." As my curiosity led me to
acquaint myself more particularly with the habits of this strange
and lawless class on the rocks, it became to me a perfectly
unresolvable problem whether Dennis M'Carthy ever slept. Along with
him were several of the noted Sydney gamblers; men who one day had
a couple of hundred pounds and the next no dinner, and who not very
long afterwards were transported under a colonial sentence "to the
nor'ard" settlements additionally punitive, to the north of Sydney.
All these except old Dennis were at this very time prisoners of the
Crown, but got out of barracks by "tipping" (bribing) the watchman
and constables. This night their "job" was easing a couple of
sailors of the proceeds of a sealing voyage. Dennis was not playing
a hand himself, but he was playing both the sailors' hands for
them: he was seated more unsuspected than innocent where he could
give his "pals" "the office" what cards the sailors held; both of
whom were so much in liquor as not to have the slightest notion
what was going on. Before the morning light began to show through
the shutters about 40<i>l.</i> had changed hands.</p>

<p>The remainder of the company was broken into larger or smaller
groups, from one or other of which every few minutes came the shout
of "Another half-pint here;" which was no sooner delivered in a
tumbler than it was dealt out into wine glasses and drunk neat. Our
little party, whose entrance neither attracted the attention nor
disturbed the current of carousal of the general body for a second,
was speedily supplied with some cold meat and bread, of which we
were glad enough.</p>

<p>The reader will, I doubt not, permit the introduction here of a
little episode, or I should rather say of its beginning. It has
reference to a subject which I have all my life since this time
felt that I should like to say half a dozen words about to the
community at large. The topic is generally, perhaps, a difficult
and delicate one; but in the present case its events were of far
too painful and melancholy a character to be deemed offensive. When
our meal was over, I, who had no inclination to join in the
frightful doses of raw spirit which those who came in with me were
swallowing, fell into conversation with a young woman who was
sitting beside me. She was quite sober, and on my coming in had
made room for me beside her, by an act of natural and unobtrusive
courtesy; and when several times I offered her the glass during
supper, merely sipped and put it down. She was sallow and thin, and
coughed almost incessantly. She told me she was given over by the
doctor; and when I asked her how she could think of coming to such
a place under such circumstances, she said she knew it was not
right, but she could not sleep of a night, and wanted company: when
"her sister" (so they usually speak in the <i>sisterhood of
sorrow</i>) came here, she came too; her breath was very bad, and
she was afraid some night or other she should die while she was
alone. She was a native of London; and had been here nearly seven
years, <i>but should not be here much longer</i>. How long had I
been here? Was not I a Towny too?&mdash;"An emigrant: here about
twelve months, and a Londoner." Indeed. Where was I working? "Come
to Sydney with a load of cedar from the Islands." Did I mean to
stay in Sydney? I must mind what I drank in that house, for old
George was always hocussing some poor lagger (sailor) or another,
and leaving him without a feather to fly with when he waked in the
morning. My attention became wholly abstracted from the fierce riot
around; I heard nothing but the broken voice that was answering my
questions; I saw nothing but my own mental visions of the woes it
told, till some one threw open the window shutters and said it was
sunrise.</p>

<p>Sunrise seemed the signal for a general dissolution of the
assemblage. The sailors went to their ships; the convicts sneaked
off to their gangs; and the wretched half-frantic women that had
completed the groups staggered away to any doghole where they could
find a temporary lurking-place to sleep off the effects of the
drink. When old D &mdash;&mdash; and his partner found that I had
come up from the Islands with a quantity of plank for sale, nothing
was too good for me. Among other attentions was that of installing
me into their own sleeping room till the town was up; but here, as
I was fully convinced I was only brought in to be robbed, I took
care not to sleep at all. I had not indeed much cash about me to
lose, and I might have recollected that they were sure not to try
for such a paltry stake as that, but wait till I sold the cedar.
But that not occurring to me at the time, I contented myself with a
mere rest on the bed; and after a couple of hours went down to the
wharf.</p>

<p>In the course of the morning I made a tolerably good bargain for
my share of the cedar. I found I had cleared, after paying all
expenses, fiftyseven pounds. Here I must digress a moment to remark
upon the enormous extent to which government was cheated of the
duty it imposed on this article. Valuable as the timber was, the
duty of one halfpenny per foot on all cut on Crown land could by no
means be considered an extortionate impost; and yet some of the
first "nobs" in the colony used to "swallow bobby" (make false
affidavits) to an enormous extent. The cedar being exempted from
duty by an affidavit that it was cut on a private estate and not on
Crown land, some of the police courts continued for years to be
scenes of the most barefaced perjury in this particular; and the
magistrates knew it very well, but would not interfere because some
of their own rank were among the principal culprits. I could point
out one person from actual knowledge of his cedar grounds and his
trade, who must have cleared some thousands of pounds in this
nefarious way.</p>

<p>Having sold my cedar for ready money, I lodged this fresh sum
with Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, a very substantial and well-respected
publican, who I have already mentioned as having interested himself
to get me work on my first coming to the colony. In the afternoon I
wandered round the town in search of a lodging, which at last I
found in York Street. In the middle of the night I was roused out
of my sleep by a violent smarting sensation on the outside of the
thigh; and putting my hand to the spot the same pain struck me in
the forefinger, inflicted I could feel at several distinct strokes.
My instantaneous impression was, that I was bitten by a snake; but
I could feel nothing of such size. Throwing the clothes in a heap
on the spot, to retain whatever might be there, I got a light. On
removing the bedclothes, I found one of the small black scorpions
of the colony. My leg and arm became quite numb for a short time,
but no further ill effect followed.</p>

<p>The Rocks, being so elevated and almost surrounded by the waters
of the harbour, are the pleasantest part of Sydney. When George
Street (the main business street) is like an oven, a fine soft
breeze may generally be felt moving on that high ground. Having
nothing to do, I often strolled up there; and whenever I happened
to meet with Jane, the poor invalid I have mentioned, I went into
the Sheer Hulk and sat down with her; for she was generally, if out
at all, sitting in the shade somewhere about that spot. She would
never drink anything but tea, so I used to make old D
&mdash;&mdash; provide us with some. A remarkable and admirable
religious instinct had led her companions of her own sex to insist
on her living at their charge for some time before. The cost might
not be great, but still it was human nature standing forward in its
heroism between its kind and the enemy. Their expression was, "She
should not die in her sin." I thought it very beautiful. It had not
occurred to me, who had plenty of money, and strength and right to
earn more; but these outcasts, whose earnings were a crime, and
whom men trampled upon as the worthless ones of the earth, were
steady in their reckless kindness, never forgetful, and often
giving half of all they possessed beyond mere clothing to her, who
would not be long able to give even the simple remuneration of her
thanks. At last I insisted on her taking a rupee or a dollar from
me every few days. Some days passed, at length, without my seeing
her. I made no inquiries, expecting every day to meet her. But the
fourth or fifth afternoon her particular associate met me, and
asked me to go with her to "her sister," for she was very ill. She
conducted me to one of the worst parts of the Rocks, and then up
the steps of an old house, with the window-shutters nailed up, and
a shattered door without fastening. The joists were still ranged
along the ground-floor, but the boards were all torn off, probably
to burn. Stepping from one joist to another through the front and
back rooms, which were both in the same condition, we went into a
little weather-boarded shed, not much bigger than a large chest of
drawers, built up to the back of the house for a sort of washhouse.
Here the two occupied one small bed on the bare ground. They had
some time before been turned out of doors to make room for a better
lodger, because they were too poor to pay their rent regularly; and
the sad impulse of necessity had conducted them to this empty
house, where the bare joists preventing their using the rooms, and
the staircase being too broken to go up and down at night, they had
taken possession of the shed. It had an earthen floor, and the sun
being on that side all the middle of the day, the heat beat through
the low roof of wood, only half an inch or so thick, with an
intolerable force. What a feat for man to triumph in&mdash;to have
brought simple confiding woman to such a doom as this! The poor
sufferer was too hoarse to speak, or rather could make no sound.
She had caught the influenza, which was then about, and is the only
fatal epidemic of the colony. Added to her previous complaint, it
had made perfect havoc of her little remaining strength. Her eye
was lustrous and wild, her face clammy all over with the heat, and
her breathing one protracted struggle. If my Lord &mdash;&mdash;,
who took her from her father and mother and brothers ten years ago,
at sixteen years of age, could have looked from amidst his luxury
into this shed, he must have hated his mocking escutcheon. As I
could not understand what she was trying to say, I went out and got
a pencil and paper, for she had had a first-rate education. An old
Italian, who had been a prisoner, but was now boating on the river,
told me she understood his language as well as he did himself, and
"talked it like a lady." She must also have had a good knowledge of
music, for she knew the names of almost all the pieces played by
the military band. She wrote on the paper that she should like to
have a doctor, that she thought she should get better, and would I
come and see her every day? From the instant I went in, as soon as
I saw the piece of buttered bread that lay untouched beside her,
quite crisped with the heat, and the butter melted right through
it, I had quite settled that point. I said that I would fetch a
doctor directly. Off I went down the Rocks, across George Street,
past the Tanks, to Dr. Bland's&mdash;the first medical practitioner
in the colony. I met him at his own door. Like himself, when I
described the case, that good man turned and went with me at once.
After seeing Jane he told me there was no hope of her living more
than six or seven weeks, and he urged her being sent up to the
hospital. But this she would not hear of. She informed me that she
had once been a patient there, but was so terrified by seeing the
scarcely dead dragged off their beds whilst yet warm, and, covered
with some scant rag, borne off to the cold and solitary dead-house,
that she had come out half cured, and would sooner die than go
there again. The next thought was what ought to have been the
first. I went out and took a large firstfloor room that looked down
on the water for her, a nice cool shady place, on the side of the
house not exposed to the mid-day sun; and as soon as it grew a
little cool we removed her, the companion of her poverty, who had
given her half her narrow bed, going with her as volunteer nurse.
That night, when the moon got up, I had the happiest, and yet the
saddest, walk I have ever had in my life. Its sensations remain to
this hour. I had left <i>her</i> in a quiet house, nursed tenderly,
medicated wisely, fanned by the sweet sea breeze, and, more than
all the rest, confiding in, depending on, <i>me</i>. But this was
the end of all, that it was to be but for a few days. So thinking
and feeling, I rambled on to near Paramatta and back before
morning. At this distance of time it seems to me very strange; but
I felt then as if I had never been in such perfect tranquil
enjoyment of all the highest faculties of my being. Perhaps it was
so. Perhaps this first downright outburst of my soul set me
thenceforth thinking, and feeling, and knowing, and willing, and
enjoying, and daring, and gaining, and desiring, as I never had
done before. Forgetfulness of self is surely the gate into the
divine places of the universe; and thus this night, for a little
while, I was allowed to walk with God.</p>

<p>In about ten days the influenza, which Jane had been labouring
under, was subdued; but she was very weak. She however did get up,
and for some days walked about; but her weakness became greater,
and she again took to her bed. She rose no more. I sat up with her
the chief part of the nights myself. Oh, how tending the dying
makes us love them! During these hours I read to her nearly the
whole of the Testament, of which she became more and more fond.
About a week before she died she gave me directions to take from
her pocket a packet of letters, which as soon as she was dead I was
to sink in the middle of the harbour, I could have been better
pleased than with my commission; I imagined they were the letters
of her destroyer, and I abhorred their contact. Sitting the same
night in the old arm-chair by the bedhead reading as usual, I fell
asleep about two or three o'clock in the morning. When I awoke it
was broad daylight. My right hand had fallen over on to the pillow:
she had clasped it in both hers, pressed it to her lips, and fallen
asleep. Tear spots were still damp upon the pillow. A few days
after this she died. I did not see her die, but they said it was
the mere change of a minute&mdash;a gentle wandering of thought
into bewilderment&mdash;bewilderment becoming
unconsciousness&mdash;unconsciousness settling into death.</p>

<p>Just outside Sydney, south, there is a large uneven tract of
sand, the Sand-Hills. Every body in New South Wales knows the
import of the phrase <i>the Sand-Hills</i>. It is one of the still
trophy yards of death&mdash;one of the stillest&mdash;one of the
saddest. Here in a cloudy winter day, a chiller and more waillike
breeze goes stealing along each little knoll that breasts up along
the barren hollow; and here too in the summer's prime the sand,
gathering the solar heat, glows upward again into the descending
beams, intensifying them till it is faintness and blindness and
something near suffocation to stand still anywhere within the dread
precinct. If the world were searched from end to end, nowhere could
you find such another volume of unutterable woe as is bound up in
this little spot. In yonder corner lie the Jews, in this the
Protestants; here the Presbyterian, there the Catholic: but
<i>all</i> wanderes far from home and kin. Take any group of those
masses and analyze it. What elements!&mdash;Misfortunes
wonderful&mdash;incredible delusions&mdash;pure suffering&mdash;and
direst criminality. To such a home they carried the woebegone
creature whose truest friend had met her all too late. I could not
properly follow her to the grave, but some of her own sort did; and
when all was over, and the town still, I went out alone and paid my
last melancholy tribute to her remains.</p>

<p>I have often thought I should like to ask the better portion of
society, especially the female sex, whether they ever considered
the frightful retribution that attends their neglect of this
miserable class of women. The betrayed, driven from society, has
become the betrayer from the sheer necessities of hunger and
thirst, weariness and cold. "In the twilight, in the evening, in
the silent and dark night, she lieth in wait at every corner."
Man's very immunities are his snare; no necessary exposure follows
his transgression. And thousands&mdash;tens of
thousands&mdash;hundreds of thousands, from the greybeard to the
stripling, follow the steps of "the strange woman" to her "chamber
of death." Night and solitariness and the interests of the class
are a triple cloak of concealment. No one warns the mother where
the son has been; no one hints to the sister the first downward
steps of a beloved brother; no one solves the dark enigma of
unrequited affection to the wonderstruck ear of the wife. The
mighty mischief ramifies through all society. The fountains of a
nation's life are envenomed; and pure and spotless as are the
mothers, the poison of a fiery taint is in the blood of the
children from age to age renewed. All undetected does the deadliest
monster that ranks among our foes pursue his fatal ravages.
Conscience only&mdash;the conscience of one half the race&mdash;is
the only volume of his statistics. For all this there is but a
single remedy. You can add nothing to it; you can take nothing from
it.&mdash;<i>Women! extirpate this foe-class by your love</i>. And
it must be <i>your</i> love&mdash;<i>your own</i> love. Man's will
not do. He only sinks himself in his attempt to save. Every section
of society has its own philanthropic function. Here is yours. Shall
it alone remain undone?&mdash;undone to your own undoing?</p>

<p>It was an amusement to me for a little while after Jane's death
to ramble now and then up the Rocks, for I liked to hear one and
another talking about the deceased; and I saw and heard every day
things in the lives of this lawless race, which I should have had
great difficulty in believing except on the evidence of my own
senses As I have gone in and out among them, I have heard
conversations passing which literally foreshowed deeds of
dishonesty and violence, not then indeed acted, but acted
eventually. I knew too that some of these men were runaway
convicts, who were in strict "hiding" in the day-time, and only
"showed out" by stealth at night, creeping through the darkness up
and down those intricate streets to the place of assignation for
some desperate deed, or thence to the place of its fulfilment. I
believe, from what I have learned in subsequent years, that almost
every house of the lower sort in this district of the town partook
at this period more or less of the same lawless character. It is
astonishing what numbers of them still sell grog on the sly; what
numbers again of these sly grog shops are kept by "fences," or
receivers of stolen property; and what numbers again of these
either harbour and conceal bushrangers on the premises, or receive
them and purchase their plunder at night. Instances have occurred
of men being householders for several years, maintaining an
excellent outward repute, being extensively trusted by merchants
with goods, and shunning no publicity whatever; and yet being
finally discovered to be convicts illegally at large. So that this
whole field of society may be said to be as it were an undermined
and hollow tract, where the superficial and visible life, bad as it
is, conceals another unspeakably worse. The very constabulary
themselves are of a piece with the rest; for it is quite undoubted
that numbers of them consider their only business with any drunken
man they may find lying about, to be to empty his pockets and leave
him. Perhaps, however, I should not speak in the present tense; my
knowledge has only reference to the past. Of late years the Sydney
police is said to be of a much more reputable character.</p>

<p>Moored at a considerable distance out in the waters of the
harbour is the old ship used as a hulk for some classes of
convicts. One fierce, rainy, windy night while I was there, about
eleven o'clock, a well-known frequenter of D &mdash;&mdash;'s
knocked at the door, and being recognised by his voice, immediately
procured admission. A fine, ruddy, rawboned fellow, six feet high,
followed him closely in. He seemed very little daunted, but it
appeared that he had jumped overboard and swam ashore from the hulk
during the evening, having had three shots fired at him by the
sentries, none of which took effect. Old D &mdash;&mdash; was
afraid of the police if he kept him in the house; and he was no
less afraid to tell the man himself personally that he must go. The
consequence was that he stayed; the lights, however, were all put
out, and everything hushed for the night. The new comer was put
into a back room to sleep, from which there was a method of escape
up the rock behind. I, who had lingered to see the upshot of the
matter, was filling my last pipe when loud voices on all sides of
the house were heard demanding entrance. Old D &mdash;&mdash;,
after making as much delay as he could under pretence of getting a
light, at length opened the door: a whole host of constables came
crowding in, while at the same time those who had been stationed at
the back jumping into the yard and trying the latch of the
back-door (which the runaway had purposely left open for his own
escape, never thinking of that entrance being used against him),
and finding it yield, had walked in and taken him. And now another
scene commenced: the chief constable, who was present, directed his
subordinates to take into custody everybody in the house as
confederates. Not supposing myself at all concerned in the affair,
I had hitherto kept quietly aloof, but the prospect of such an
adventure soon altered my mood. I could not get past them and get
away by the door; and what was worse, I knew that two if not three
of them knew and had recognised me. Once more my good fortune
befriended me. In old D &mdash;&mdash;'s room was another small
window, and long before the scuffle in the front room had
terminated (for the lights were knocked out, and there was a
regular pell-mell in the dark, the constables dragging one and
another into the street as they could find them), I was out of the
window and away up the Rocks and in safety. I made the best of my
way into the thick scrubby bush of the Government domain, where I
stopped shivering till the morning, but quite content to be where I
was rather than where I might have been. I should have gone home,
but thought the "traps" might know my residence, and follow me. As
soon as I knew the people in Sydney were stirring in the morning
and the houses open, I ventured, not without most cautious glances
and hasty steps, to my old friend Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, the publican.
As he told me that I was perfectly correct in thinking that it
might turn out a rather serious adventure if I should be identified
as one of the company, I got a couple of pounds from him, bade him
secure my box and pay my lodgings, and was full four miles out of
Sydney on the road to the Hawkesbury River before I even stopped to
breakfast.</p>

<p>BY the time I reached the top of the hill where the Great
Western and Southern roads diverge from each other, I was ready for
my breakfast: so, going into the public-house, I joined a party of
travellers to whom that meal was just being served up. These
travellers were principally Hawkesbury settlers who had attended
Sydney market on the previous day; and, not having disposed of
their loads till late, had stayed in town all night. After
breakfast, while the pipes were being filled and lighted, one of
them read aloud from the paper an advertisement of the sale of a
lot of impounded cattle, to take place at a pound near the
township, or, more correctly, town, of Windsor on the next day.
Just at this time a very severe drought of many months' duration
was at its height, without any prospect of termination. Cattle were
dying in all directions throughout the colony for want of "feed,"
the pasture being eaten quite down to the roots, and the whole
country, for hundreds of miles, presenting nothing but a surface of
bare grassless earth. Stock consequently had fallen ruinonsly in
price; so that beasts which formerly had sold at 8<i>l.</i> and
10<i>l.</i> per head were now worth not above 2<i>l.</i>
10<i>s.</i> or 3<i>l.</i>, and people whose cattle had got into
pound often cared not to release them. The poor beasts were thus
left to depend for subsistence, and for the <i>personal
appearance</i> that goes along with it, on the tender mercies of
the poundkeeper. As these men's interest in the matter extended no
further than keeping up the beasts in order just so far as to
ensure the disbursement of their own claims, the result may be
imagined. They very often sold for the worth of their hide. That,
in Sydney, at this time varied from 5<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> Of
course beasts which got impounded whilst in good order suffered
less: some of these would sell at 30<i>s.</i>, 40<i>s.</i>, or even
60<i>s.</i>; very few fetched more.</p>

<p>Up to this time I had no settled intention which way to travel.
My determination was now formed by the influence of one of those
outward circumstances which so commonly, and oftentimes so
unexpectedly, control the inward mind. One of the company made the
remark, that the lot of cattle advertised, to his knowledge,
comprised several head of the best-bred beasts; and that they were
so low in condition, but without any serious injury, that they
could "hardly crawl, and were sure to go dirt cheap." Here was a
"fine chance," he said, for anybody that had a little "ready
blunt." It instantly struck me, that without any job in hand, and
nearly 80<i>l.</i> in the hands of my acquaintance in Sydney, I
might as well have the chance myself. I did not think a second time
about it: my conviction was quite perfect at once. So I told the
man I had been talking with, a young Australian, that I thought I
should go up the road with him, if he would have my company: this
he assented to willingly, we having become quite intimate in the
single hour we had known each other.</p>

<p>After partaking of the usual starting glass (a half-pint of rum)
between us, we set off. A single fine old shaft bullock was all my
fellow-traveller was driving, and our pace was pretty good. I dare
say the "old Trojan" walked off at the rate of nearly 3½ miles an
hour. I got a good deal of information from this young
"Native,"&mdash;as the white Australian-born race are called. He
told me,&mdash;and I saw plenty of evidences of it as we went
along,&mdash;that the heat on the previous market-day had been so
great that between twenty and thirty head of draught-cattle, of one
sort or another, had sunk under it between Sydney and Windsor, a
distance of 35 miles; and he had been informed during the week
since, that birds had been found, by several persons, dead on the
ground in the bush, from no other cause that could be thought of
but the heat of that day. I certainly recollected the intense heat
of the day very well when he mentioned it; but it had no violent
effect on me beyond causing the most profuse perspiration. Three or
four times since I have noticed similar days, and must say that
each time I have felt them more severely, no doubt on account of
gradually decreasing vigour. It should at the same time be
carefully stated, that these occasional hot days are not by any
means feared or considered dangerous to health by the colonists
generally. Peculiar constitutions only, I think, suffer from
them.</p>

<p>I inquired what means I must take, if I were to buy the cattle
we had been hearing of, to procure pasture for them. Any large
settler, he said, would in general take charge of another person's
cattle on the terms of receiving in remuneration one third of the
increase; but at present "the feed" was so bad that scarcely
anybody had enough for his own. But he knew of one settler, a
magistrate, who had a fine run over the Hawkesbury River among the
mountains, who had very few cattle on it, and was taking any he
could get to graze on the thirds. This determined me to make the
purchase if everything beside should seem to make it advisable. One
further difficulty struck me: I hardly fancied giving my cattle up
into the hands of a stranger, and going away to perhaps a
twelvemonth's job in a distant part of the colony. But on
mentioning that point I was told I should get plenty of jobs about
the Hawkesbury, for that there were not many sawyers about that
part, and sawed timber was coming into demand more and more every
day. He could not inform me of any settler needing a pair of
sawyers; but thought if I walked about among them on the banks of
the Hawkesbury for a few days, I was sure of meeting with what I
wanted. My course seemed so clear, that on reaching Paramatta, 15
miles from Sydney, I determined to go back to Sydney by the evening
coach, and draw some money from my banker; returning by any
conveyance I could get.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day, till coach-time, I spent in surveying
Paramatta. I found it a large straggling town on each side a small
river, over which is a common bridge, remarkable, so far as I know,
for only one circumstance: viz. that some years before, when the
people rose in the morning, there was found on it, and killed, a
diamond snake of 27 feet length. There is a very good church: a
court-house also, chiefly famous for the illegal conduct of some
members of its bench about this period. One of their practices was
the infliction of torture on convict malefactors to compel
confession where they suspected crime, but were without evidence.
In the investigations instituted by the government it turned out
that one or two of these justices in particular had been in the
habit of ordering a given number of lashes to be inflicted on
prisoners morning after morning, till they confessed what was
required. No doubt many a poor wretch has since died at some penal
settlement who was sent there on the strength of his own
confession, thus obtained by the insupportable torture of "the
cats" morning after morning on his lacerated and ulcerated back.
This is the same bench which also put that astounding construction
on the 'Hired Servants Act' in the case of the Rev. Mr. Walker,
which the Supreme Court of the colony eventually expressed itself
so severely about. The case was this:&mdash;The Archdeacon, then
the chief ecclesiastic of the colony, engaged the Rev. Mr. Walker,
a most respectable man, as master of the Female Orphan School,
together with his wife. In course of time Mr. W. found himself
compelled, by his feelings as a gentleman, suddenly to decline, on
Mrs. W.'s account, any further connexion with the institution.
Hereupon the Archdeacon brought both Mr. and Mrs. W. before the
Paramatta Bench, under <i>The Hired Servants Act;</i> and under
that Act the magistrates tried and sentenced them. The Supreme
Court decided that the Act had no reference to the case, and public
opinion added that, even if it had, Mr.</p>

<p>W., under the circumstances, <i>could not have acted
otherwise</i>. This will be to the reader another token of what
sort of materials the Australian magistracy at the period in
question were composed.</p>

<p>Among the other buildings that attracted my observation was the
Female Factory, a splendid edifice of white squared stone, standing
a little way off from the town in a low sandy flat of short
under-wood: it is in the middle of a yard, walled round to the
height of some twelve feet; in it are confined all the female
convicts in the colony not actually assigned out to private
service, together with such as are under imprisonment, &amp;c.
&amp;c. for bad conduct. These last are generally punished by
having their hair cut very short, by being confined in solitary
cells, inferior rations, &amp;c. Another building which struck me
very much was the Darling Steam Mills, just completed about this
time. They are of fine cut stone, on the bank of a creek about a
mile from the heart of the town. The townsfolk seemed busy in
various occupations, and generally well dressed. The little mobs of
dogs that were to be seen gathering instantly whenever a bark was
heard, were quite amusing: I several times counted above twelve,
little and big. I was told that it was quite impossible for a
nervous person to go to sleep till long past midnight through their
incessant yelping till the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Evening at length came, and I retraced my course back to Sydney.
I got off the coach a couple of miles out of town, and walked in
after dark. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was at home, but had not the money I
wanted in the house. He however made it up by bed-time. All
attempts to find anybody going toward Windsor next morning at a
sufficiently speedy pace for my purpose were unavailing: so I had
at last to engage a horse and gig, which Mr. &mdash;&mdash; sent
his government man with me to bring back. The expense was
10<i>s.</i> We got off by about four in the morning, and were at
our journey's end, at &mdash;&mdash; Pound, by breakfast time;
which, as it came on a very sultry day, I was by no means sorry
for.</p>

<p>The sale began soon after 11 in the forenoon. I had previously
examined the cattle, and had taken the opinion about them of my
friend the young native with whom I had travelled the day before,
and who had stopped at the adjacent public house all night. Some of
them were in a dreadful state of "poverty" as graziers call it,
with their bones literally forcing their way through the skin, and
so weak that they could not walk, but only stagger and stop and
stagger along again like a drunken man. Others were in pretty fair
condition. Some were quite young cattle, some old. There were
working bullocks, unbroken-in steers, and cows and calves. I bought
thirteen head of one sort and another; for which I gave 10<i>l.</i>
15<i>s.</i> Several, indeed most of them, were very well bred
cattle, so that my bargain, as they all lived and throve when they
got on good grass except one, was a very good one. The landlord of
the house where I put up agreed to take charge of them for me, find
a boy to herd them, keep them on good grass, and yard them in his
own stock-yard every night till I got "a run" for them, at
1<i>s.</i> a head per week. Everybody said I had made a good
speculation; so that I really began to think myself quite a shrewd
cattle jobber. On consideration too it seemed to me that the
trouble of making arrangements for these thirteen head would be
nearly as great as that of making those required for several score.
Thus prepared I was induced in the evening to answer to the offer
made by one of the guests who was drinking very freely to sell a
lot of all sizes at 2<i>l.</i> a head. He had nearly sixty head,
and was selling them as I heard to get ready money, having once
been very well off, but now being quite impoverished by habits of
intoxication, the great moral disease of the colony. The reader may
judge for himself of the force of this habit in this hot climate
when he has been informed, that during my residence in Australia I
knew scores and scores of men who, reformed for a time by the
moneyless condition of a prisoner, had gone on, after they became
free, gradually accumulating wealth for many years, till once more
getting to make free with this deluding luxury they fell back into
their old habits, became inveterate habitual drunkards, and died,
some in the most miserable destitution, and others still possessed
of wealth, but bankrupt in all moral respectability. I have known
instances where these wretched men have accustomed themselves to
lie in bed and drink brandy all day for weeks before the awful
process of self-destruction was completed. The unfortunate fellow I
now refer to, after spending everything, went to one of the South
Sea Islands in some very subordinate capacity, and I never met with
any one who knew anything about him afterwards. Not liking to deal
with a drunken man, I said nothing to him that night, but next
morning when he was tolerably sober I asked him if he remembered
his offer the night before. As I found he had come to the
determination to part with the cattle to the first purchaser he
could find on the terms he stated, I agreed to go over to breakfast
with him at his farm and look at them. We had a walk of about six
miles thither, and by the time it was performed he was got pretty
well round. He had a wife and five young children, and it was quite
shocking to see the shy, downcast looks with which they received
us; even the baby in arms seemed infected with the blank, hopeless
look of the family. The cattle were all standing in the yard, and
had been there for two days before. He had got them in out of the
bush, and swore they should never go out again till he got the
money for them. I made a bargain with him to take twenty at his own
price, cows, calves, and young bullocks. I could have got them at a
lower rate if I had beat him down; but I really had not the heart.
He made me stop to dinner with him; and I prevailed on him to let
the eldest boy take the whole herd out to feed for a few hours. But
he was intoxicated and quite unreasonable again long before
evening. When the cattle came home we drafted off my lot, and he
sent his boy with me to help drive them to where my previous
purchase were yarded. During the night I recollected for the first
time that with these three and thirty head I was standing at a
grazing rent of 1<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> per week; much too large a
sum for me to feel easy about. I therefore resolved to set off in
the morning along the Hawkesbury River, as I had been advised, and
endeavour to make some arrangement for the care of my little herd
on the thirds, and at the same time get a job to support
myself.</p>

<p>Morning came, shining brightly, as the morning can shine in New
South Wales. I set off about 9 A.M. on my new expedition.
Traversing the long viaduct that conducts the road across the low
land bordering the creek on the Sydney side of Windsor Township,
and over the bridge across the creek, and up the hill and past the
barracks and across the main street, I for the first time looked
down on the celebrated Australian river the Hawkesbury as it rolled
smooth and deep at the other side of the eminence on which the
settlement stands. Wide, and deep down between its sloping grassy
banks, it was a very different spectacle from the cragbound
torrents I had been used to in the Cedar Brush, and at once
prepared me for a pastoral and agricultural country. I believe (but
am not sure to a few miles) that at Windsor this river has yet a
hundred miles to travel to the sea; and the whole of the distance
is navigable for sailingboats. One was quietly gliding up to the
wharf beneath where I stood, filled with shells for burning into
lime. As this was not the part of the river which I had been
directed to traverse, I turned along the main street, and following
it past the church, a fine large brick edifice, bent my steps
toward the little township of Richmond, three quarters of an hour's
walk distant. Here there is a punt ferry across in the direction of
the Blue and Curryjong Mountains, immense masses of lofty country,
intersected by vast gullies and chasms in all directions&mdash;so
much so indeed that the chief impression on one's mind in
travelling through the region is wonder how a road was ever found
across it. When I reached the edge of the high lands at Richmond,
and looked across the alluvial tract, which, in the language of the
settlers, is called the lowlands, and saw the fine expanse of rich
cultivated ground with the river on the farther side and the dark
blue misty mountain outline beyond, I felt at once that I was in
the land of the husbandman. Whichever way I looked I could see
fields of the tall green Indian corn (maizc), with its tassel tops,
bending and waving under the fresh breeze that was sweeping over
it. Here again a square of orchard loaded with splendid peaches
broke the uniformity of the surface; there a piece of ground new
ploughed or with the teams at work upon it, and here a square of
wheat stubble on which a boy tended a herd of pigs as they picked
up the scattered grain, still further varied the prospect&mdash;and
every few fields apart some more or less simple edifice marked the
homestead. In some places it was no more than the bark hut of a few
feet area, with its own dungheap and stack; in others it was the
capacious and costly mansion surrounded by farm buildings of all
sorts, and abundance of grain. My way to the farm of the first
settler I had been advised to go to, a miller, lay along the
lowlands ascending the river. On making my way down into this tract
I found all sorts of vegetables and fruit trees flourishing; at
least all the settlers troubled themselves to plant. There were
excellent figs, gooseberries, currants, lemons, oranges, melons,
peaches as large as a good sized breakfast cup and of the most
exquisite flavour; potatoes, pumpkins as big as a large bucket,
cabbages, radishes, onions, beans, pease; in short everything of
the kind profusely produced and of the most superior quality. In
one place I saw a whole cart-load of the most delicious peaches
going along the road; and on asking the driver where he was taking
them to market, he told me they were for the pigs, and that all the
season through they gathered a similar load every other day from
under the trees in the orchard for the same purpose. In another
place I found a large tract planted with what at first glance
seemed to be a species of cabbage; but on inquiring of some men who
were working among the plants hilling them up, I found it to be
tobacco. They said there would be about twelve hundredweight to the
acre, and that, if well cured, it would be worth 150<i>l</i>. per
acre; and that really well cured Australian tobacco would sell
about that part as well as American; but few people could succeed,
from want of a knowledge of the true process, in effecting a good
cure of their leaf. These men I discovered were all convicts, lent
by the government to the settler on whose land they were at work.
There was no restraint on their personal liberty beyond that of
fear of consequences if they left the farm or neglected the work;
their huts were at the edge of the piece of tobacco ground, and
were merely a few upright sheets of bark with interstices of many
inches, and only part of a roof&mdash;in short many a countryman in
England provides his pig a snugger shelter. In fine weather this
would matter but little, but in wet it must have been the source of
much discomfort. They received no wages, but were provided with a
scanty suit of slop clothing at certain seasons specified by law;
and also every Saturday afternoon with as much coarse beef and
flour as would just keep them till the same period of the
succeeding week. Occasionally their master opened his heart so far
as to give them a little tobacco, tea, and sugar beyond the
allowance ordered by law. Altogether their cost might be about half
that of free labourers; whilst between fear of being flogged and
hope of getting a little indulgence in the matter of ration, their
labour was nearly or quite equal&mdash;so that the master's clear
gain was just the wages a free servant would have been paid over
and above his ration at the same kind of work. Travelling on I
found very few free labourers in this district; almost all the work
seemed done by the settlers, their sons, and their convict
servants. Of course there were a few free men, but the proportion
was much less than in the non-agricultural parts.</p>

<p>As I have not yet mentioned it, it may be as well to notice here
a peculiar characteristic of the free labouring population of
Australia: it is in a state of constant migration. The man who has
a contract job or is a hired servant here this year, probably
spends the next at the other end of the colony. It is less so about
the Hawkesbury than elsewhere, occasioned, I have always had a
strong surmise, by so many of the little settlers having daughters.
Some stalwart young Briton transported at fifteen weathers his
seven years, and at two and twenty gets his certificate of freedom
and goes off to seek his fortune. The Hawkesbury arrests his weary
footsteps; some crabbed old emancipist offers him a job, which, too
new in liberty to be fastidious, he takes; there is but one hut,
and man and master eat together; a few days domesticates the
stranger; and every night when the "laughing jackass," the
settler's clock, a common bush bird, calls him home from the field,
the pleasant piano-voice of Nance or Nelly sends him unresisting to
the river for a bucket of water or to the bush for a log; till joke
gets transformed into serious earnest, and the wandering servant
owns the heiress of the soil.</p>

<p>The first settler to whom, as advised, I made application for a
job was a miller. He was an old man, who had come to the colony a
prisoner in early life, but by probity and industry had gradually
assumed a much better position in society than he could have
attained if he had never become obnoxious to the penal laws of his
country. He had a fine farm, and a fine family, chiefly sons. At
the extremity of his farm, bounded by the river, and worked by it,
he had also a very fair mill. When I got there it was just
dinner-time, and his lads were just coming in out of the adjacent
bush from felling and cutting up into fire-logs a noble iron-bark
tree. They brought me in with them as soon as they heard what my
errand was. It appeared, however, that the old man had given the
order for the sawed stuff he wanted to a neighbour's son a few days
before, and that it was already partly executed. But my
disappointment was qualified by being made to sit down with them
and partake of a hearty dinner of excellent bacon and greens. In
the afternoon, before I set forward again, the old man took me
round his garden and farm-yard, and through his cultivated ground
to the mill; and all the way we went, as if he had a mind to
encourage me by showing what patient industry and uprightness could
do, he kept detailing to me the hardships and privations and perils
of his early career in the colony&mdash;the oppression he had had
to put up with without daring to demur, the toil he had had
perseveringly to sustain for many years in possessing himself of
the first seeds of his present wealth, and the many heart-sinkings
he had struggled through before anything like a continuous tide of
prosperity set in. When I was about to leave him he recommended me
to go over to another miller in the vicinity, who was about to
extend his buildings, and try for a job. This led me back partly in
the same direction I had come. The journey took me till late in the
evening, and was equally unsuccessful. As this person, in addition
to his mill business, kept a public-house, I stopped there for the
night. He also was an old man, and was said to be pretty well off,
although a few years before in quite straitened circumstances. Like
the individual last mentioned, and indeed like most of those who
have risen from the ranks of the prison population by their own
efforts, there was a sort of open sturdy manliness about his
character which was very agreeable. He had several
convict-servants, who I could see were governed in quite a
different manner from those I had met with in my Illa Warra jobs
under free settlers. The free settlers governed their men with
capriciousness and by terror, and so could never trust them beyond
their sight; whilst these settlers, who had once been prisoners
themselves, seemed rather to obtain a willing obedience, founded on
respect for their judgment and fairness; and consequently they
could trust their men as well out of their sight as in. In the
morning I set off again, once more retracing my steps in the former
direction, and pursuing the same course as far as the Nepean River.
This time my application was to an officer connected with the
government establishment at Emu Plains, who I was told was about to
build a cottage. The information was founded on mistake: he
received me politely, but said he had never had any such intention.
It was at the Court-house I found him; and there was thus afforded
me an opportunity of becoming acquainted, by personal observation
and inquiry, with the real character of our British penal
institutions in New South Wales. There was one man being flogged
for theft, whose crime it was acknowledged was the consequence of
the hunger of a three days' fast. His miserable pittance had been
stolen, and, after enduring his hunger as long as he could, he had
swum the river in the night, and broken into an adjacent settler's
granary. Another poor wretch had a sentence of twenty-five lashes
for laziness in not doing his task. The fact was, it would not have
been laziness in the same man, in the condition he was in, to have
lain abed for a month. Beside these, a number of men received
twenty-five lashes each, on the charge of disobedience of orders.
That disobedience was, that, their rations not having come by the
proper time, they had refused to go to work till they got them,
under the very natural impression that they could not be compelled
to work when they were not fed. It would be in vain to try to
depict the looks of mingled astonishment, indignation, and dogged
sullenness that they exchanged as they came out of the Court-house
door after hearing their sentence, and as they filed off into the
prison-yard to be tied up to receive it. The constable who went in
last left the gate partly open. I heard the flogger say, "Well,
who's the first?"</p>

<p>After an instant or two I heard the answer; it seemed to be the
voice of a Scotch lad: "Here, I'm the first, you &mdash;&mdash;;
but &mdash;&mdash; my eyes if I don't have satisfaction one way or
another, if I get hanged for it." I heard, awhile after, the dull,
heavy fall of the cat on the flesh, and the constable's
count&mdash;ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, &amp;c., mingling with the
flogger's <i>hiss</i> each time, as he sent the blows home,
dallying between each to spin out the punishment to the utmost. But
there was no cry, no groan, no prayer for mercy. It was not long I
listened. My heart began to beat chokingly, and I got away from the
legalised abomination as fast as I could. I often heard people in
Sydney afterwards expressing their astonishment and horror when
some of these iron-gang overseers were killed by the men; but from
this time I never found any difficulty in comprehending the how and
why.</p>

<p>Before I had collected myself I was a good way past the
public-house. I had been hungry a few minutes before, but my hunger
was as completely gone off as if I had been at a lord mayor's
dinner; so I turned off into the bush the way I came, meaning to go
back to Windsor. But when I had got some distance on the road it
began to rain. On the right, at a little distance, situated on a
hill among some paddocks, I saw a farm-house and buildings of a
superior order. The rain came faster and faster, and it had become
so cloudy as to appear much later than it was. The wind, too, as is
often the case in these sudden changes in New South Wales, was
excessively chilly. The hospitality which I found everywhere
prevailing, even among the poorest, assured me that I should not be
denied a night's entertainment if I went across to this farm; so I
settled it with myself that I would go no further that night. My
expectation did not mislead me. To my surprise I found I had got to
<i>one</i> of the farms (for how many he had in all I believe few
people know) of the celebrated Mr. Samuel Terry. This individual
had once been a convict, but at the time in question was become one
of the principal merchants in Sydney, and I believe no one who knew
him well personally grudged him his good fortune. At this farm he
had merely an overseer and a few men. The overseer received me very
civilly, made me have my supper with himself, and gave me a very
snug bed. I knew the part of the country he came from in England,
and we had a long yarn about <i>home</i>, that ever ready theme by
day and dream by night of all, emigrant and outlaw alike. We were
in a more weather-tight room than any I had been used to since
coming to the colony; and, as the wind ruffled and moaned about
among the buildings scattered on the hill, and the rain pattered
against the door, or fell hissing into the fire through the
chimney, and the bright flickering wood-fire burnt steadily on, I
could have fancied myself back in old England again, in some
farmer's kitchen, far away in a quiet country village.</p>

<p>In the morning after breakfast, declining the invitation to stop
and rest all that day and proceed on the next, I directed my steps
back again toward the punt ferry, at that part of the Hawkesbury
where I had come down on to the lowlands. Wandering leisurely along
I could not but feel my disappointment considerably ameliorated by
the pleasurable feelings that attended what I saw of the general
condition and character of the population. A beautiful river
covered on its farther bank with mighty woods, backed by majestic
ranges of mountain, and bordered on this side by wide alluvial
flats parcelled out by the earlier governors into little useful
farms, not calculated for fortune-making, but for affording
necessary sustenance to the families of deserving individuals of
the class of convicts; one wide expanse of cleared and generally
cultivated land; every quarter of a mile or less a homestead alone
at the river's edge, or embosomed in a rich orchard; here cattle
standing sheltering themselves from the sun under a tree, there
horses steadily dragging on the wellguided plough; then a group of
children more carefully or rudely clad as the parents were less or
more removed from habits of sloth and dissipation; each individual
and each farm busy in itself, but nothing of that general
intercommunication we meet with in the motion of tangled cities,
where each part is perpetually threading the intricate mazes of the
whole:&mdash;such was the scene through which I passed. Every house
and hut had its wheaten or maize cake, its joint of pork or beef,
and its fragrant pot of tea ready for the traveller. Occasionally a
niggard or a helpless spendthrift was found; but such were the
exceptions to the rule. The chief vegetable was the pumpkin, which
I preferred to any vegetable we use in England; and the chief fruit
was watermelons, the size, colour, and delicious refreshing
coolness of which, eaten during the three hours of mid day heat
when most farming people pause for a time from their field labour,
it would be impossible for me to describe by mere words. The very
general prettiness of the native white girls struck me very
forcibly. I do not know how to account for it, but there is common
to them, in all points, a singularly marked feminine character; a
gentle, simple womanliness that is peculiarly agreeable. You do not
feel afraid of their sneering at you or suspecting you. You feel
that if you need help they will help you if they can. In a society
where the prime law of life is suspicion and vigilance this is
quite a little oasis. The best feelings of the heart and the
noblest sentiments of the mind bound fearlessly forth to rest upon
it. Perhaps this is just what woman tends to in proportion as she
is made Jess amenable to the artificial standards of society and
left to subside into the impersonation of her own intriusie
qualities.</p>

<p>I got to "Tommy Parnell's," the public-house at the ferry, just
at dinner time; and soon made myself quite at home. Mr. Parnell is
a native, and, like all his caste, a free-hearted fellow, very easy
to scrape acquaintance with. Here I stopped several days, for I
really knew not which way to turn. I could not go into the
interior, leaving my cattle at such a rent; they would soon, to use
a common phrase of the country, have "eaten their heads off." Being
told, after the lapse of about a week, that Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, a
settler and one of the magistrates of the colony, would be very
likely to give me work, I went over to him. To my great
satisfaction I was successful; and before I came away, signed an
agreement with him for a large quantity of split stuff; for as much
indeed as, together with the setting it up as a fence, occupied me
for twelve months. At the same time I made a bargain with him to
take my cattle on the thirds.</p>

<p>I then gave Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s stockman, who was going to
Sydney, an order to the man who had my little herd to deliver them
to him as he came back; and in the course of another week they were
on their way over the Blue Mountains, on the opposite side of the
Hawkesbury river, to the cattle station in the interior, where they
were to "run." Their "spell" on better grass had improved them so
that they travelled very well; and I had a message by a man who
came down from the station after they got up, that not even one of
the calves "dropped" by the way. The magistrate I was now employed
by was an old gentleman very much respected and very well off. Like
almost all the old settlers he had a great many farms, as well as
cattle and sheep stations, in various parts of the colony, hundreds
of miles apart from each other; he also, as usual, had at the home
farm his smithy, flour-mill, tailors', shoemakers', harnessmakers'
and carpenters' shops, tannery, cloth-factory, tobacco sheds;
beside stables, dairy, barn, wool-sheds, brick-kilns, saw-pits,
&amp;c., &amp;c., and all the necessary tradesmen for these various
occupations. Probably on his establishments there were altogether
nearly or quite 200 men; some free, some bond. My work went on much
as usual. It was some days before I got a mate. He had no prisoner
that he could spare; otherwise, it being a very general custom at
that time for a master to find a free tradesman a prisoner for a
mate, charging a dollar a-day for him and finding his ration, I
should probably have had one of his own men. I at last met with a
free man who was walking about in search of a job; and as he was a
willing agreeable chap I had no occasion for any change afterwards
throughout the job. We met with a fall of excellent box and
iron-bark trees. In splitting the tree is sawn off the stump at
about two feet above ground; a length of the barrel, answering to
the length of the posts or rails, is then sawn off. When the tree
is alive the bark will often come off all round in a single sheet,
which is spread out and flattened for covering huts, &amp;c., if of
a species sufficiently pliable. The log, thus barked, is split
lengthwise with wedges and maul into quarters, these again into
billets, and the billets into rails or posts or slabs. By the time
we had got all our stuff split it was nearly the middle of the
following winter; so that when we came to dig the post-holes the
ground was so well saturated with rain that the digging was very
easy, and we got on fast. It had, however, this disadvantage, that
we could not ram the earth as hard round them as if the temper of
the clay had been stiffer; and as it is the practice of the
overseers, before giving the order for the payment for a fence, to
do all that their utmost strength can do to shake it down in
various places and thus test its solidity and permanence, there is
very great danger of having a fence, put up in either very wet or
very dry weather, loosened and objected to; for if once a single
post moves, they shake on till down go half a dozen panels. With
the overseer, however, we got on very well. The entire length of
the fence was something more than two miles, and we had to set on a
couple of hands in addition to ourselves at the putting up; but
there were only found three panels seriously faulty. These three we
renewed, and went in to the head farm for our money. I had
87<i>l</i>. coming to me; but my mate, who was very much addicted
to drinking whenever he could get it, and never went in to the farm
without drawing out of the stores a bottle and sometimes two of
rum, had only 53<i>l</i>. due to him. The clerk whose business it
was to settle with us we found, as we had always heard him
represented, a perfect scoundrel. He was a prisoner of the Crown,
but had been brought up to one of the liberal professions. Self was
his god, and every act of his life self-service. Without any strong
mental faculties there was such an entire self-possession and
uniformity of aim and feeling about him that his every act was
instinctively in perfect keeping with the whole. He cheated the men
for the master, and then he cheated the master for himself; and he
did it so well that the master when informed of it, and with proof
positive offered him, would not believe it. To look in his face one
would doubt whether he believed it himself: he is now free, and
comparatively a rich man. The first point he contended for was to
sink the charge for all above the two miles (about 8<i>l</i>.); but
when I showed him the overseer's ration bill, containing the charge
for rations for the <i>whole</i> job, he gave that up. The next was
neither more nor less than making a mistake of 1<i>d</i>. per
pound, on his own side, on all the meat we had drawn during the
twelve months for ourselves and part of that time for the other two
men; but, as I had already made my own calculation of the items, he
was again disappointed. He next insisted that we must, he was sure,
want to renew our stock of clothing after being twelve months in
the bush; which clothing would have been charged at least double
the Sydney price. My mate was easy enough to take about 10<i>l</i>.
worth. I wanted none, and none I would have. On the last point, and
that, after all, the most serious one, the clerk was perfectly
immovable, and I had to give way&mdash;it was no less than
insisting that I should take one-half of what was coming to me in
cash and the other in cattle; of course at their own prices. I
stood out for three days, but it was of no use. Not a penny would
he give me till I came to his terms. I had therefore at last to
take four cows for 40<i>l</i>. The same four beasts I could
certainly have bought anywhere else, with the ready money, for half
that sum. He therefore cheated me out of full 20<i>l</i>. I had no
resource but going to law; and I was told that if I did that in
such a matter in New South Wales, where everybody knows everything
that occurs in the Sydney courts through the papers, I need never
look for another job from a settler. I was very glad in after years
that I took advice, and put up with this robbery quietly, for I
found what I was told true. The representation of a single settler
that some free man <i>will</i> have his rights is always enough to
throw that man out of all chance of work along a whole river. The
four head of cattle that I got (I was allowed to choose from the
whole herd, a few particular ones excepted) were fine beasts: in
fact, at any other time than that, when cattle were so cheap, they
would have been worth the money. As soon as I had got them branded
I took the earliest opportunity of sending them on up the country
to where the others were, together with the branding iron and
directions to the stock-overseer there to brand all the rest as
soon as he could. My mate left his cattle still with Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;'s herd; and took the check for his money over to the
adjacent public-house to get it cashed, and then came back to pay a
few small debts he owed among the men. But after he got to the
public-house he never left it till he had spent every penny, and
then in a state of half-intoxication he came back with another man,
whom he had picked up to help him; took the cattle, drove them over
to the township, and sold them for 3<i>l</i>.10<i>s</i>. a-head.
Thus he got in the long run 7<i>l</i>. for 20<i>l</i>. worth of
work. Surely of all men living the drunkard is the most
unfortunate. Others have to contend against the inimical forces
around them, but he superadds to this that he is perpetually
inimical to himself.</p>

Act&mdash;Remarks</p>

<p>IT was now above twelve months since I had been to Sydney; and
although I had frequently heard from travellers who stopped at our
hut of the landlord of the &mdash;&mdash;, whom I had entrusted to
be my banker, and had really no reason for altering my opinion of
him, I yet began to be anxious to know whether the remainder of the
money I had left with him was safe. Since seeing him I had had my
notions of men much modified by what I had seen and heard of
various individuals in the colony: in short, I was become much more
cautious and suspicious. Meeting with another man belonging to the
farm whose work was done a day or two before my business was so far
arranged as to enable me to leave, I agreed to go down the country
with him. We set off early, intending to make but one day's stage,
but the weather was so sultry that we made two. The first day, soon
after we were through Windsor, a transaction presented itself to me
which, to give the English reader a correct notion of New South
Wales, I must connect with a series of others of its own class, and
shall therefore give this chapter up to that purpose; leaving my
narrative to recommence in the next.</p>

<p>About three miles beyond Windsor, towards Sydney, we came up to
a group of constables, all armed and gathered round a young man,
who evidently by his English dress had not been long in the colony.
This of course they could see as well as I could, and as there was
not the slightest indication in any other point of his being a
bushranger, there was in fairness and common sense no ground for
supposing him anything else than a free emigrant. They however
insisted that, as he had "no protection," they would take him into
custody to be sent to Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney, the head convict
office, "for identification." It was in vain that he remonstrated:
their resolution remained unshaken. The chief constable of the
Windsor bench was at the head of the party, and as he knew me well
by often seeing me at Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s, he asked me no
questions; otherwise I suppose I should have shared the same fate.
They marched the poor fellow to Paramatta gaol that night, and next
morning, as my fellow-traveller and myself walked leisurely on
between Paramatta and Sydney, one of the constables of the former
town overtook us, having him in charge for lodgment at the Sydney
police-office. As we walked on together I had a long conversation
with him; and with my little discrimination in such matters, was
soon quite sure that his tale was a true one. He had come out to
the colony to an old friend of his family, who had emigrated some
years before to hold a respectable public situation, but on arrival
found him to be dead. After trying to get employment till
everything was gone but the clothing he stood in, he had wandered
on up the road toward the interior, more from the impulse of hope
than of any precise expectation; and had had his journey cut short
in the way described. I felt curious to know how the magistrates
would deal with the case, for to me it seemed a most flagrant
outrage, whilst the constables maintained it was quite legal, and
in the common course of things. I had heard of such things before,
but did not quite credit them. I also felt interested in the poor
fellow, for I recollected how my own heart had often sunk on my
first arrival, when I tried day after day to get a job without
succeeding. The magistrate, Captain Rossi, long the chief
superintendent of the Sydney police, sent him first to the
prisoners' barracks, where the documents descriptive of all
individuals transported are kept, but he was returned from thence
as unknown. He was next sent to where he himself said he was known
in the town, and where it seemed to me he might have been better
sent first; from thence he was brought back by the constable, with
the merchant's certificate that he had come out a free emigrant to
the colony a few months previously, in a ship consigned to his
house. Captain Rossi then informed him that he was discharged. The
young man asked what he must do if he were again taken into
custody. Captain Rossi said he should then know him again himself,
and would at once liberate him. The young man said this was not
what he meant; suppose he were arrested again, many miles from
Sydney, what was he to do? Could not Captain Rossi give him "a
pass" to protect him, as he now knew him to be free? Captain Rossi
said, No, that was beyond his province: he would recommend the
young man to apply to the colonial secretary. The poor fellow was
about to reply, when a couple of constables had him turned round,
marched off, and set at liberty at the court-house door, before one
could count half-a-dozen. I confess I was puzzled to credit the
honesty of referring a man in immediate necessity of such an urgent
kind to an official whose aid it would certainly require several
weeks to obtain, especially as the poor fellow had no home for the
communications to be addressed to; and I was equally puzzled to
detect the difference between the manner in which this son of
misfortune had been treated under the magistrate's eyes with his
tacit consent, and a common assault, that it was the magistrate's
duty to take cognizance of judicially.</p>

<p>After this affair I began to think myself very fortunate in
having never yet met with the like treatment; which was no doubt
owing partly to accident, and partly to my having always gone well
dressed. Previously to this I had seen portions of such cases, but
this was the first I had had an opportunity of observing
throughout. As I am very careful on so serious a point to state
only what I am positive of, I shall pass over plenty more where
again I merely saw portions of the affair, to go on to such as I
can speak positively to throughout.</p>

<p>The next was in my journey, hereafter detailed, up the New
Country. In passing through Stone-quarry I went into a hut, which
turned out to be a constable's to rest. A few minutes afterwards a
middle-aged man stopped at the door and asked the way toward Bargo
Brush, which was shown him; and he went on. About a quarter of an
hour afterwards a gentleman rode up to the door, and calling the
constable out, inquired if he knew the man who had just passed. The
constable replied very deferentially that he did not; the horseman
I found afterwards was one of the magistrates of the New Country
travelling to Sydney. After designating the poor constable by
several rather singular names, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; ordered him to
"be off after the fellow and bring him back." Without any further
directions as to what was to be done with the man, Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; pulled his horse's head round and cantered off
toward Sydney. The man was accordingly brought back and lodged in
the gaol, where, as it was Saturday, and the court of the district
over for the day, he would certainly have to remain till Monday.
Some years afterwards I happened to meet with this old constable in
a distant part of the colony, and on calling to mind with some
difficulty where I had known him before, I asked him what the man
had turned out to be; he said, a free emigrant. He had been brought
before the Stone-quarry bench on the Monday, and after being
detained several days for the reply of a gentleman in Campbell Town
whom he referred to as knowing him and able to recognise him by his
handwriting, he was discharged; but just as in the other case I
have related, without anything to protect him against the
repetition of a similar outrage by some other constable the very
next day.</p>

<p>The next case is one of my own personal experience, and I relate
it here rather than in the order of its occurrence, because of the
remarks I wish to offer on the subject at large at the close of
this chapter.</p>

<p>I cannot conceive how writers on New South Wales reconcile it
with common honesty <i>invariably</i> to conceal this great fact.
If their object were different from what it is, one might think it
an oversight; but when we know that their grand aim is the
promotion of emigration, it appears a piece of cunning at once base
and puerile. Surely no honourable man could make such an omission,
revealing, as the act does, a consciousness that if emigrant
labourers were aware of what awaits them, they would never make one
step toward the country. If the practice cannot be given up, at all
events let men be told what they are to expect.</p>

<p>I was travelling, at a future period of my colonial life,
towards Sydney from Wallis's Plains by the Great Northern Road,
then being cut by the iron gangs, &amp;c. It was excessively hot
weather, and one of the Hawkesbury natives, whom I knew, was going
thither with a team of bullocks in their harness, but without a
dray; and as I was walking he took every thing I did not want, of
clothes, &amp;c., and slung them with his own things across the
cartsaddle of his shafter. Thus we were both travelling dressed
merely in our boots, hats, shirts, and trousers. After dinner the
second day, I went off the road to an adjacent farm, to a person I
had some business with, and my fellow-traveller went on toward
where we were to camp for the night. My business detained me so
much longer than I had expected, that it was nearly nightfall when
I came off the bush track into the high road again. I looked round
and saw, with astonishment, the nearly setting sun; and, of course,
began to walk as fast as I could after my friend. At this instant I
heard the clatter of horses' hoofs and the rattle of arms, and
looking back saw a couple of mounted dragoons, headed by their
officer, galloping after me. The officer shouted to me to stop;
which I did. He came up, and in a most offensive way asked who and
what I was. I told him, a free emigrant. "Had I any pass? anything
to show?" It happened that I had, and moreover had it with me; for
some time before, feeling rather in danger of being one time or
other placed in this predicament, I had requested a gentleman in
the commission of the peace, who knew me at the Hawkesbury, and had
farms in this part of the colony, to give me "a pass." I took out
"the pass," and gave it to the officer. He glanced at it quite
cursorily, told me he knew Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s signature very
well, and was sure this was a forgery. Nothing I said in reply was
of the slightest avail: indeed, both he and his men seemed to
regard this proceeding as a sort of joke that passed away the time
mighty pleasantly. I was compelled, on pain of being handcuffed to
one of their stirrup-irons and dragged along, to walk before them
about five miles forward till they met a constable; into whose
custody they put me to be taken thirty-five miles back to Wallis's
Plains, where I had the day before come from. The first night we
stopped at an iron-gang camp. Here I was put into the lock-up, a
little roofed enclosure of a few feet square, very strong, but
having the slabs in many places half an inch apart. The ground was
quite wet, though there were men confined there almost every night.
During the night it set in to rain and blow hard; the water running
off the higher ground outside to the floor inside, it having been
lowered by occasional sweeping. Some time in the week before an old
working bullock of one of the teams at the gang had died, and his
hide in a half putrified and stinking state was my only furniture.
But bad as it was, I was glad at last to spread it on the floor of
the hut with the hair side next me, sit on one end and draw the
other up over my shoulders to keep the wind off. Here I sat till
morning, whistling, shivering, and vowing vengeance. I had nothing
given me to eat (such is the law) till the next morning, when they
gave me a pound of "tommy;" but its colour and scent were enough.
That day I was marched on to Wallis's Plains, and lodged in the
lock-up with a man charged with murder. Here I was kept four days
without ever being examined further; when to my astonishment, just
at dusk in the evening of the fourth dreary day, I heard the
military officer who had arrested me, and who was the justice at
the head of the police at the adjoining Court-house, ordering the
gaoler to open the door and bring out "that emigrant young man
there had been a mistake about." Indignantly enough I walked out
into the yard. Captain &mdash;&mdash; informed me, "That he was
very sorry he made such a mistake: he had been over to-day to one
of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s farms and taken 'the pass' with him; and he
had been assured by one of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s overseers, that it
was that gentleman's writing." I suppose some of the officials had
told Captain &mdash;&mdash; of my expressed determination to seek
legal redress; for a course of more cringing apology no man could
utter. My first impulse was to threaten him with proceedings; my
next to ask him what amends he intended to make me; but my last was
to go away without a word. The fawning, cringing meanness of the
apology was in such striking contrast with the red jacket and gold
epaulettes, that it so completely took me aback, that I really did
not know what to say or do in reply. My anger had lost all its
violence in my contempt by the time I got home; and I thought no
more about it. It remained in my memory only, as one of the many
proofs I have met with how exceedingly unfit a military education
renders even gentlemen for posts of judicial trust; and how
particularly so for any office where laws of great latitude of
interpretation are to be administered. But when the governors of
colonies are military men, how can anything else be expected than
that they will extend their own leaven through the whole lump,
wherever there is a delegate to be empowered or a salary to be
absorbed?</p>

<p>Another case of similar, or even worse character, fell under my
notice at that period when General Darling sent parties of troops
to scour the whole country, on the ground that an unusual number of
bushrangers were out. I saw a lieutenant of one of the regiments
accost and arrest two men, one of whom was an emigrant, the other a
prisoner free by servitude. The chief constable of the district was
with the military party, and I heard him tell the officer that he
knew both men to be free: the man free by servitude had long been a
settler; and the free man had originally come to the district as
the previous magistrate's free servant, so that there was not the
slightest reason for suspicion in either case. However, the officer
maintained that he had, according to the requirement of the law,
"reasonable cause of suspicion," and after keeping them all night
in custody in a blacksmith's outhouse on the roadside, sent them on
the next morning to the adjacent police office for examination,
where on arrival they were, of course, immediately discharged; with
some rather strong intimations from the presiding magistrate to the
corporal who took them, that a little more discretion on the part
of his superior was desirable. The emigrant was a hardworking quiet
man, and the freed man was both poor and ignorant; so the matter
blew quietly over. Such, however, are the daily and hourly
adventures of the labouring class.</p>

<p>I come to a much later period of my residence in the colony for
a case: not that no intermediate ones present themselves, but to
show that only so lately within the last four or five years matters
were becoming much worse on this point, instead of better, as one
would suppose should be the case as the free population came to
outnumber in immense proportion the bond. In travelling through the
upper part of the Hunter, I stopped a few days at one of the
principal farms. During dinner the first day, the farmconstable
arrested a traveller on suspicion of being a bushranger, and put
him in confinement in a private lock-up built on the farm. The man
was kept there several days before any magistrate sat at the
adjacent court to hear cases; and it then turned out that the man
had worked for that gentleman some years before, who recognised and
discharged him. The poor fellow said, he had come free to the
colony twelve or thirteen years before; and was generally arrested
twice every year, under the Bushranging Act. He had made
application in one quarter and another for some protective
document, till he was quite tired and had given it up. He had now
made up his mind to it, and it did not affect him as it did at
first. He slept the time away as well as he could, and was all the
readier for work when he got out.</p>

<p>A native lad once told me he had some time before passed seven
weeks out of three months marching in handcuffs under the
Bushranging Act. Having been born in the colony he had no
protective document whatever. Some busy farm constable (a branch of
the police I shall describe directly) arrested him, on suspicion of
being a bush-ranger, at one of the farthest stations of Hunter's
River, where he was looking for work. After being taken in
handcuffs to Sydney, full 250 miles, and discharged, he went to the
Morrumbidgee on the same errand, where he was again taken into
custody by a soldier and forwarded in handcuffs to head quarters
under the same law.</p>

<p>As to the practice of the mounted police (dragoons employed on
the roads under the magistracy) of handcuffing men to their
stirrup-iron and so making them march or rather run, it was at one
time quite common. I have several times heard it stated that it was
at last discontinued through a trooper leaving his prisoner thus
confined at a public house door, while he went in to drink, and the
horse, startled by something, dashing off and killing the man. This
however I state not from knowledge, but from report. On the other
hand it is quite certain that I have not related one hundredth part
of the shameful things that take place under authority of this
enactment&mdash;for an authority it quite unquestionably is. There
is no need of overstraining the act to make it most oppressive; its
most lenient operation is flagrant enough. Under it a general
authority is given to arrest on "reasonable" grounds of suspicion.
Now it is certain that the settler magistrate and the chief justice
decide very differently as to what "reasonable" cause of suspicion
means. The settler magistrate takes it to be the "reasonable" of
<i>his</i> reason, and that too very likely whilst under the
influence of some strong bias of feeling or interest, and perhaps
half drunk; on the contrary the chief justice holds it to be the
"reasonable" of fair common sense. There is scarcely one case out
of ten but would be decided against the captors in a civil suit.
But then the injured is almost invariably a poor labouring man, and
generally far from legal advice. Besides which, it has really
become such an established custom of the colony, that men do not
even think about going to law, be the case as gross as it may.
Whole shoals of men, both emigrant and freed, are daily passing to
and fro from one police office to another "for identification." Yet
I have never seen one syllable on the subject in any "tour," or
"statistical account," or "journal of residence," or "history" of
New South Wales that I ever yet met with, and I have had the
curiosity to examine many on this very point.</p>

<p>The farm-constables I have promised to describe are prisoners of
the crown actually serving their sentence, who have been authorised
to act ostensibly for the purposes of convict restraint on the
farm. But no one ever questions (so that I suppose it cannot be
questioned) their right to arrest under the Bushranging Act; and
now that the settlers have commenced building private lock-ups on
their own farms this really becomes a very serious matter. I could
point out plenty of estates which are always short of free labour
for no other reason than that free men travelling for work are
afraid to go to them, on account of the intolerable conduct of
their farm-constable; indeed this is one of the reasons why some of
the settlers who have been examined before public committees have
been able to give such very explicit evidence of their own want of
labourers. Free men do not like being continually called upon by
prisoner constables to "show their freedom;" and emigrants very
often have nothing to show, while at the same time their bare word
will not go for a straw; and thus, after going a couple of hundred
miles up the country for work, they may be marched back in
handcuffs, and eventually turned adrift in Sydney with not a penny
in their pockets. At the same time, if it has all been regularly
done under "The Bushranging Act," there is no redress.</p>

<p>One of the worst points of the system still remains to be told:
diminution of sentence is held out to prisoners as an incentive to
the capture of bushrangers. Thus there is a direct premium to the
convict farm-constable to arrest all individuals he can affix any
suspicion to by the most active ingenuity; for it will be hard if
out of ten or a dozen cards there does not turn up one trump. Hence
some of these fellows' entire occupation is going about peering
after every labouring man they can get sight of, and demanding his
name, business, and pass; in short, putting him through as rigid
and often as lengthened an examination as would a justice of peace
if he were charged with theft. And as they often do this, whether
by government authority or not I cannot say, on some unfrequented
bushroad with a horse pistol in hand, there is nothing can be done
but putting up with it.</p>

<p>Altogether the system must be altered, if New South Wales is to
be the scene of emigrant settlement. Those who made and have
maintained such a law as the Bushranging Act must have ill
understood their science. The master, who enjoys the benefits of
convict labour, is the party to be made answerable for the
convict's safe custody; not the free labourer, who is already so
seriously disadvantaged by the competition. The true principle of
the case would be to fine the convict master for the convict's
escape; as an animal's owner is fined for its trespass. Certainly
nothing could be at once more unjust and more absurd than to make
it penal not to be in a penal condition:&mdash;to make the free
emigrant (especially) liable to arrest, because he cannot produce,
as freed men can, a document to prove that he was once a prisoner:
under the Bushranging Act it is in positive effect penal to have
come free to the colony. If the reader reflects upon what has been
just described&mdash;the Act itself, the farm-constable system, the
extraordinary institution of private lock-ups&mdash;he will more
easily conceive than I could describe the extensive and galling
inconvenience to which the labouring class is subjected in this
colony. Should any amendment of the system have been effected since
my return to England, I would be the first to give it its due
weight, and to the class subject to such long-continued and serious
maltreatment my hearty congratulation.</p>

<p>MY narrative proceeds from the period of my journey to Sydney
after completing my twelvemonth's job in the Hawkesbury district. I
continued several weeks in Sydney without feeling much inclined to
go to work; for fifty or sixty weeks of unremitting exertion of the
most laborious kind in a warm climate exhausts the system in a way
scarcely to be conceived from the experience of a cold climate. An
invincible lassitude takes possession of the whole frame; and
without anything like illness one feels destitute of all that
alacrity that is usually associated with health. One evening about
sunset I was loitering at the edge of the market wharf, when a lad
standing in one of the wood boats that had discharged its load
hailed me and asked me to cast off the painter of his boat from a
log of wood it was fastened to on shore. As I did this, and flung
it into the boat, he said, if I was going up the river, he would
give me a passage. The thought directly struck me that I would do
so; and the whole course of my future life was I may say
immediately marked out by a single step. This little event was the
first of the particular train of circumstances which has
constituted my whole subsequent adventures and settled my
character. It led, in the first place, to my becoming passionately
fond of books; and again to my meeting with perhaps the only woman
I should ever have fallen in with whose character could have
permanently attached me. We pushed off from the wharf, and in five
minutes were in the middle of the bay and cracking along with a
pretty fresh breeze under all the sail (and rather more) that the
boat would carry. She was one of those snug little 2½ or 3 ton
boats that the Lane Cove settlers manage to stow with top-heavy
loads of wood, and yet bring safely down the stream to Sydney. She
had about 3 cwt. of beef together with a couple of bags of flour
weighing perhaps 4 cwt. in the bottom; and this ballasted her so
that we could afford to carry on sail pretty well. We had the tide
with us. A whole fleet of the Lane Cove and Paramatta River boats
were a-head of us; some of which had got a large bough stuck up to
catch the wind and help the oars; others we noticed where the
boatmen for want of a sail had set up their blankets; one chap had
his jacket with a stick passed through the arms for a sail. It must
have done about as much good as his hat would, for his boat was
full three tons burden. As we neared the flats, by which time it
was pretty nearly dark and had begun to rain quite hard, we
discovered a couple of lime boat men in their boat aground, half
intoxicated; they had rowed themselves on a shoal, and before they
had gathered their wits about them enough to shove the boat off
again (and it was heavily loaded with rations), the tide had run
down so much farther that there was no getting afloat till its
return. So there they had to sit and exercise themselves in the
virtue of patience for about three of four hours; which was a
tolerably appropriate substitute for the stocks.</p>

<p>Until then I was not aware how thickly the bush around Sydney
was at the time peopled by sawyers and splitters. The lad who was
giving me a passage up the river in his boat told me he was a
convict servant belonging to one of the many timber merchants who
have establishments up these rivers, and that if I wanted
employment as a bushman I could not miss it here; as there were
sawyers, splitters, squarers, firewood getters scattered through
the bush hereabouts in all directions. I landed at Tom Small's, a
native of the colony, who had very large timber concerns in the
bush and a good public-house on the river bank. The evening was so
far advanced and so dark that I could see no farther than the
landing place where I got ashore; but the sounds that came from
some little distance quite clearly indicated in what direction I
must look for the public-house. I should have remarked that it was
Saturday night, a general gathering time for all thirsty souls in
the locality. On Saturday afternoon and evening all bushmen come in
to the head stations for their next week's rations; and when this
happens to be also a place where liquor is sold, it may easily be
imagined that many of them do not go out again without those
excesses to which bushmen are so universally prone. It is a saying
among themselves that they "earn their money like horses and spend
it like asses." Reaching the little snug homestead I found a
company of about twenty men of all sorts, sizes, aspects, and
degrees of sobriety in the taproom; as usual almost everybody was
smoking, only leaving off to shout and sing and beat the table with
the quart pots, and get up a "scrimmage." It soon got spread abroad
that I was a free emigrant, and looking for work; neither one nor
the other of which pieces of news made me, as I could both see and
hear, any the more welcome. Nothing, however, passed beyond a few
sharp jokes. By degrees one and another individual or pair took up
their ration bags and started for their hut, Only myself and a few
too much intoxicated to find their way home were at length left.
The mistress found me a very good bed (of course, it being a
licensed house) for payment; and the remnants of the party went
some to beds, and others less tractable to whatsoever parts of the
floor they found most convenient. I was shown one old boatman who
had never slept in any other way than in his day clothes for years.
Of a rainy night like this he did not object to stow himself by the
fire-side of any house or hut he might be near, or under the
"gibbers" (overhanging rocks) of the river; but more frequently he
slept in his open boat without even a blanket. During my residence
in the colony I met with several such individuals. I recollect in
particular one, an old stockman near Maitland, who used to go out
with his dogs, a tomahawk, and a tinderbox, for weeks together. The
dogs provided him animals for food; with his tinder-box he made a
fire, and the tomahawk was probably a sort of protective weapon. He
took no blanket, but slept in his clothes on the ground, mostly
having one old favourite dog for a pillow. The journeys he used to
make into the uninhabited interior were quite surprising, and many
a pound did he get from fresh settlers for showing them a good new
farm, or a well-watered run.</p>

<p>To return: on the Sunday morning, I did what I now would not do;
I walked round among the huts in the bush after breakfast with the
view of meeting some one to set in to work with. It is quite a
common saying among these men, "That there's no luck attends Sunday
work." I certainly found it so; for a day of more cheerless,
unmingled disappointment I never experienced. The whole bush in
this part of the country was then thronged, as indeed it was also
almost all round Sydney, with men who get their living by various
kinds of bush work; some felling and squaring whole trees with the
squaring axe for girders, &amp;c., &amp;c., to use in the colony or
export, some splitting out of wood the slatelike shingles with
which the houses are here covered in; some splitting posts, rails,
paling, for fences; some sawing the various sorts of building
stuff, and some cutting and splitting firewood for domestic
purposes at Sydney, or for the use of the various steam-engines
that were already in operation on water and on land. Each of these
pairs of bushmen (for owing to the nature of the work it is best to
work in pairs) knocks up a little temporary hut on setting in to
work; shifting only as the job is finished or as it becomes
necessary to move on for fresh timber. But sawyers who have their
logs drawn by timber-carriages to their pits often remain a long
time at the same hut. Indeed in many places you come across
"camps," as they are termed, of sawyers: these are where some large
timber-dealer holds his head station; and comprise the huts and
pits of three, five, six, or more pairs of sawyers. Some of these
men have wives, some have not. It is generally considered that "a
woman keeps a hut more comfortable." But really a sawyer's life is
one of such incessant labour out of doors that the difference to
him must lie chiefly in the carrying of the idea in his mind that
his hut is so provided. He is so little in the hut except at meals
that the actual difference of comforts can be but small. My own
sense was never so much that of absence of comforts and
conveniences when living where there was no individual of the
female sex, as that I was living an unnatural and incomplete
life&mdash;that work which robbed me of female society was work
which defeated its own end&mdash;that the positive loss was far
beyond the gain. Still while I could not help myself I was fain to
put up with it like the rest.</p>

<p>In many of the huts I found the men washing their shirts; some
few, but very few, had had them washed by their mates' wives the
week before and had them on. Many were sharpening their saws; a pit
saw wanting an extra running down &amp;c. once a week. In other
places, little knots were sitting on their piles of timber or under
the shade of a tree, smoking. Some again I met wandering twos and
threes together through the bush looking for "good trees" for the
coming week. The general style of dress was lace-up boots, duck
trousers, check shirt, coloured silk neckerchief, and straw hat.
One or two had got so far as whity brown socks and pumps, with a
stylish blue jacket and waistcoat and black hat for Sundays. They
all behaved very civilly and hospitably to me: but there was
unmistakeably a general disinclination to work with a free
emigrant. I suppose there is no class of tradesmen or indeed of any
men who entertain such a brotherly feeling toward one another as
sawyers, yet so strong was the spirit of caste at this period among
these that they could not forget that I was a free emigrant. The
galling sense of my superiority in this particular was not to be
neutralized even by the strong law of fellowship inherent in the
trade.</p>

<p>With this conviction on my mind and a good deal mortified by it,
I on Monday morning bent my steps back again toward Sydney. For
curiosity's sake I went by land to where a ferry leads from the
north shore across the waters of the harbour to Sydney. In
travelling thither I could not but take notice of the immense
numbers of tree stumps. Each one of these had supplied its barrel
to the splitter or sawyer or squarer: and altogether the number
seemed countless. Several times I was induced to wander off the
road down a grassy slope overshadowed by oak or gum or ironbark, to
where I saw the form of a hut, in the hope of getting a light for
my pipe: but found only some deserted pit or falling hut, with
docks and other such plants growing all around, as is usually the
case when the grass has been destroyed to the very roots; the spot
where the fire had been, and in the pit where the earth is covered
with sawdust, are the only exceptions. They are always bare.</p>

<p>When I had nearly reached the old ferryman's (Billy Blue; so
called, I suppose, because he was a very black black) a traveller
overtook me. I saw in an instant, from his tall slender make, fair,
colourless complexion, and light hair, that he was an Australian.
We soon freely entered into conversation; he informing me that he
was going into Sydney to try to meet with a mate and to buy a saw.
As I had by no means recovered from the mortification that my late
ill success had given me, I did not directly offer myself. I knew I
could easily get a mate in Sydney and go to the cedar grounds. And
as I always cut a first-rate week's work (in hard wood never less
than 1000 feet), I did not consider myself at all in need to be
under a compliment to anybody for working with me. We soon got into
conversation. Young R &mdash;&mdash; no sooner heard how I had been
running the gauntlet through Lane Cove and Pennant Hills, and to
what reason I attributed it, than he asked me to go and work with
him. It was a good job, good price, good timber: and he wanted a
topman for a mate rather than a pitman, as he was not yet a good
hand at the file and set (tools used in keeping the saw in order),
which is really the grand point of the workmanship. He ended by
telling me that one of his parents came free to the colony quite in
its early stage; the other had been a prisoner. The fall of timber
he was going to set into was about three miles from their farm; he
had one brother much older than himself, a stockman up the country,
and one sister at home: and we could either go backward and forward
every day to our work or knock up a temporary hut and go home only
once a week. The offer was made in that free-hearted way that so
agreeably distinguishes the Australian in social life. I told R
&mdash;&mdash; at once that I accepted his offer, and felt obliged
to him for it. By this time we had reached Billy Blue's. The old
man&mdash;who had a little grant of land at the water's edge
opposite Sydney, given him, I believe, by one of the governors in
those early days when it was considered that a poor man was as much
entitled to his small grant as the rich one to his proportionably
larger&mdash;was just come over from the Sydney side with a
passenger. He told us, with quite a fatherly sort of authority,
that he had been across a good many times that day; that we must
pull him over to the other side, and he would take the boat back.
The "Old Commodore" being considered to possess a sort of universal
freedom of speech to everybody, no demur was made. We pulled him
across in his own boat, and paid him our fares for pulling himself
back again.</p>

<p>With my new mate I spent a very pleasant day in Sydney. I found
him, as all the young Australians are, shrewd and good-natured. We
selected a seven-feet plate pit saw, which turned out a real good
one. After taking it to where we meant to sleep that night,
Humphreys's, by the market-place, we strolled down to the King's
Wharf. The great quantities of sales by auction, both of new and
second-hand property, at this time in Sydney was to a new-comer not
the least remarkable circumstance that presented itself. There had
been one this day at the rooms of one of the principal auctioneers:
and an old superannuated sawyer, with whom my mate had worked with
some years before, was helping to carry home the lots. We stopped
to talk with him at the door of the sale-room. Some young gentleman
had had a lot knocked down to him, but had failed to comply with
some point or other of the terms of sale, nor could he be heard of
at the address he gave. The lot therefore was returned. As R
&mdash;&mdash; and his acquaintance "yarned," I took up one of the
books to amuse myself. Its title was "A Chemical Catechism, by
&mdash;&mdash; Parkes." Happening to open upon the experiments, my
attention became engaged to such a degree that in the next five
minutes a new world lay expanded before me. Of course I now know
that the facts I met with in this volume were novel and wonderful
to me only because I was ignorant. But at the time the curiosity
and interest they awakened in me were such that I think I should
have given 5<i>l</i>. for the book if I could not have secured it
for less. However, I was much more fortunate than that. The
auctioneer asked me the same for the whole lot as it had been
knocked down for, but would not sell the single volume. The sum
required was a few shillings short of 8<i>l</i>., and there were
nearly a hundred volumes, large and small, old and new. Though it
was my first deal in books it seemed clear to me that it was a very
good one; and again, I felt sure I could always sell them again for
the same money after reading them. I saw too that this was the very
thing I had always wanted to make a bush life pleasant. I always
liked my work so much that the day passed before I was aware: but
the evenings, especially in winter, were the same dull thing over
and over and over again, smoking, talking about good or bad trees,
making and drinking tea we did not want, "chaffing," playing at
cards for inches of tobacco; such were our recreations for hours in
the long evenings, or on days when there was no work going on. I
must own, however, that I felt a little intimidated at attempting
this innovation on the manners of my class. I was quite sure I
should get laughed at, and very likely get some not very soothing
nickname for it. But the temptation was irresistible. I went and
fetched the money, and R &mdash;&mdash; and our new comrade helped
me to take them to the Bull's Head. I read till past twelve o'clock
at night: and well remember that I got my brain into such a state
of excitement by it that till nearly daybreak images of crucibles,
alembics, furnaces, &amp;c., mingled with the sound of the words
salt, acid, alkali, nitrate, sulphate, muriate, and innumerable
more, were hurrying through what seemed a vast dark blank all
instinct with sensation within my head. Nothing was amiss with me
in the morning.</p>

<p>By evening the next day we were at &mdash;&mdash;, having left
the books packed in an old tea-chest to come by one of the
neighbour's drays on the following market-day: R &mdash;&mdash;'s
new saw we carried with us, along with a few other small articles
we knew we should need. Before going on to describe my new home,
and my reception by its occupants, I ought perhaps to give the
reader a list of the principal books I got in my purchase: the book
on Chemistry already named; Volney's Ruins of Empires; a number of
the Oxford Encyclopaedia, containing "Astronomy;" Hume's Essays;
several volumes of Byron's and Scott's works; Sibylline Leaves by
Coleridge; a large volume of lectures on Metaphysics by Professor
Browne of one of the Scotch universities; Euclid; a number of odd
volumes of history by Robertson, Hume and Smollett, and others; and
lastly, a quantity of little volumes with and without title-pages,
among which were a Latin Grammar and a very incomplete Latin
Dictionary with the mark of a red-hot poker nearly half through
it.</p>

<p>The reader will probably smile when my first remark mark about
my new abode is, that I was no sooner in it and seated and had
looked about me, than I felt I was at last <i>at home</i>. I have
come fully to the conclusion, and especially do so the older I am
and the more I <i>feel</i> what mind is, that there are certain
presentiments derived from reason, yet in themselves far above what
we conceive of the nature and province of reason. I think we may at
times detect within us the faint tremblings of a power stupendous
in understanding and volition alike, far beyond anything we yet see
in the positive and acknowledged developments of the mind;&mdash;an
instinct, dormant only by force of some unnatural accident of our
present state; that, if it should awaken and come into play, would
reach the future from the present at a single glance, by means of
essential correspondences between the object and the subject, the
thing perceived and the perceiver; as if the secret of its own
nature ultimately realized were a key to the necessary processes of
all things whose qualities were fitted to act upon, and be acted
upon, by its own. However this may be, such as I have described
were my feelings on this occasion. It was an oldish weatherboarded
house at the edge of a thick and lofty forest. The twilight or
rather the night had set in. A whole pack of dogs, little and big,
came yelping at us as we drew near the door, but one after another,
as they found out their master, began to leap up and fawn upon him.
Half-adozen steps after we got over the fence&mdash;for we had
jumped over at the spot nearest the hut instead of going round to
the slip rails&mdash;and we were on the stone step, which was the
half of an old grindstone. All the apartments were on one
floor&mdash;a sittingroom, and a bedroom of the same size as the
sittingroom, occupied by the old couple; and two shed bedrooms,
built against the back as their family had grown up. My mate and
his father spoke to each other quite on terms of equality, but
still with the utmost good feeling. It was a simple consequence of
the son having been always free and the father once a prisoner, and
is quite customary. The old dame was gone to bed, for she was very
decrepit. Few remarks were interchanged; most of the young natives
do their business with as few words as possible. The damper and a
piece of cold corned beef were still on the table, and to them we
betook ourselves: and sundry tin panikins of tea from the iron pot
that was slung at the fire completed our repast. The old man smoked
another pipe, we lit ours; and my mate freshened the fire, for that
was the only light we had, with another log. Still it was evident,
strikingly evident, that there was something wanting. At length R
&mdash;&mdash; got out the inquiry that partly solved the problem;
it came, as the reader may suppose, in the most Spartan fashion:
"Where's M &mdash;&mdash;?" M &mdash;&mdash; was gone to Paramatta
with Helen &mdash;&mdash;. Another quarter of an hour, and R
&mdash;&mdash; got up, and without recognising the least obligation
to give any account of his intentions, put on his straw hat and
walked off; the old man laughed within himself in his quiet way,
and filled his pipe again. As the door shut after my mate, the
voice of his mother came from the inner room: "Is that the girls,
John?" "No, it's R &mdash;&mdash; gone to meet them." It was quite
clear to me that my mate was either one of the best of brothers or
else in love. Among us sawyers it is such a common thing to
deprecate having a mate that is in love, that, notwithstanding my
first good impression, I really began to feel quite out of heart
with my prospects. You never know when you have these fellows: if
you only stop to sharpen your saw, or go into the hut to light your
pipe, provided their "flower of the forest" is within anything of
reasonable distance, they are off, and you may "cooeb" till you are
hoarse without getting any answer. Presently, the period of twenty
minutes, or such other as they calculate your particular genius
will stand, elapsed, back they come, smiling and looking in all
directions except <i>at you</i>, and pretending to be as full of
alacrity for work as if they were just up; and they jump into the
pit and box the saw with a flourish, and with a throw up of it that
goes near knocking two or three of your teeth out with the tiller,
it's "Now, mate!" as if they had been waiting for you all the time
instead of you for them. Often it has cost me half an hour's
jabbing and jolting, and miswooding the saw, till my shoulders were
almost shaken out of joint, before I could get into a good temper
after one of these nuisances. Little did I think, as I despairingly
pictured such forthcoming scenes to myself, that my own turn was at
hand. During the interval I sat waiting for R &mdash;&mdash;, I
have since been given to understand I was the subject matter of a
very lively conversation; but I have never been able to ascertain
its exact particulars; and as things have turned out, perhaps it is
of no great consequence. Meantime the old man got so tired that he
was for going to bed, and he advised me to do the same; this I did,
for I was quite sleepy after my night of reading in Sydney. I was
soon asleep, and heard or saw no more of my mate till morning,
though he came and lay down beside me. We both waked together and
got up. Our first conversation of course was about the pit, but it
was too far to go and come back before breakfast, so M
&mdash;&mdash; was roused to provide for us, whilst we had a turn
round their little farm, a small part only of which was cultivated,
the rest being kept in bush for grazing the cattle. The pit was on
a neighbour's land, to whom we were to pay a small sum for each
tree we used: this I did not object to, for when I came to see it I
found there was some splendid timber. After half an hour's stroll
we went in to breakfast. I found there the very person I had always
wanted&mdash;this was clear to me directly I saw her. When it is
said that matches are made in heaven, it must be meant that there
is a natural and intrinsic qualification of certain persons for
each other; and that there is a clear certainty that they are in
the greatly preponderating number of cases brought together under
this law, and that as the grounds of all such arrangements could
only be taken in by the understanding of the Universal Governor, so
only by his power could the intervening obstacles be overcome. I
imagine there is really much more truth in this axiom than in our
jocular use of it we give it credit for. After this remark, the
reader will not be surprised by my acknowledging that I daily
became more <i>charmed</i> by my new acquaintance, and that I found
myself before long fully in a position to pay my mate with whatever
amount of interest he might think agreeable for any such
performances as I had been in the habit of deprecating. So far as
regarded the progress of our work, one point was lucky for us both;
the farms were too far from the pit to allow of many visits. Many a
merry half hour we used to pass "chaffing" each other about it. One
advantage however he certainly had over me, for which I had to
endure many an expression of provoking sympathy: the pitman can
always "plant" (hide) the portion of the tools which are considered
under his charge, as they are small and not valuable; but the
topman, when working anywhere near the road, as we were, can never
venture to leave the saw. So he was washed and at Helen's while I
was trudging under the jading swingswong of the heavy 7 feet saw to
our home. Still I was always glad to see him off, for I then knew I
should have all the cool of the evening to walk about among the
rows of tall over-shadowing Indian corn with his most agreeable
sister; and thus form an acquaintance, and ascertain a community of
feelings and of interests, whose period it has now become beyond
even the capacity of time itself to circumscribe. Thus we went on
for nearly a whole year. I have always been a very early riser, and
require a remarkably small amount of sleep; thus I used to read for
two and sometimes three hours of a morning before R &mdash;&mdash;
got up. He had a particularly hard way of working, labouring upon
his saw much more than was necessary, and thus was usually very
tired. In the summer too, during the heat of the day, it is
customary to rest a couple of hours; in this interval I used to
take the volume I was going through and stretch myself in the shade
of a tree; and by the time it was cool enough to begin work again,
my whole nature felt renovated. By the time our job was done, I had
read all the books through: several of them several times. M
&mdash;&mdash; too found in them an occupation to which her
naturally observant and reflective mind affixed itself with a
hitherto unexperienced delight. Never before had she met with any
connected dissertations or histories; her books, besides
schoolbooks, were part of a volume of Cook's Voyages, and an old
Gentleman's Magazine, which had been in the family from time
immemorial, and of which I believe every member of the family, and
several of the neighbours, knew half the pages by heart.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of our contract (which was for all large
plank), my mate and I had 51<i>l</i>. coming to us after paying the
ration bill. We had never had an angry word through all this long
job: after men have worked together this length of time, it is
rarely that they do not get tired of one another and separate. But
though the business that brought us together was finished, no
thought was farther from both our minds than that of parting.</p>

<p>SAWYERS are unavoidably a wandering race in new countries. When
the lot of timber required by the settler for his buildings is
furnished, or when the local bush where the contract with a timber
merchant is cut becomes exhausted of sound profitable trees, the
sawyer must shift his camp. Ours was the former predicament: no
further order for the sort of stuff it suited us to cut could be
obtained just there; and house-stuff we neither of us liked working
on.</p>

<p>At this time the cedar-getting was going on at a great rate to
"the Nor'ard" of Sydney, on &mdash;&mdash; river, one of the
tributaries of the Hunter. Thither at length we resolved to
proceed, taking with us, by one of the boats that went as far up
the stream as it was navigable, our own provisions; and so to set
in on the best fall of cedar we could find on government ground
near the river bank, and cut away till our stock of provisions was
exhausted; then bring the plank we had got up to Sydney and sell it
on our own account. And this, after certain leave takings, we
accordingly did; taking with us, moreover, a free man whom we knew
to be a hard-working chap as a labourer, to fall trees with the
axe, build the pits, clear the roads through the brush, bring out
the plank, give us help at heavy lifts, and afford us the needful
assistance in all those other difficulties which render
cedar-cutting too heavy for only a pair of men. We found a good
many pair on the river before us: still we got a very good fall of
timber; for it was a capital brush: the trees plentiful, of the
best size, of an excellent species for the cabinet-maker, and very
good cutters. Some kinds of this timber cut so woolly, that working
in deep cuts is most laborious; the saw clinging in the cut through
the woolliness of the inside, so that it is impossible to move it
up or down with any impetus. As the loss of impetus in the
descending stroke renders necessary the application of much more
personal strength, such timber is quite the dread of sawyers. Ours
this time were fine crisp-cutting trees; and our work went off from
the first as light and cheerful as it could do.</p>

<p>The &mdash;&mdash; river, on the banks of which we now were,
rises and for a long distance winds to and fro among the mountains
of the country of Durham: at length it falls into the Hunter, not a
great way from the mouth of that stream. It is now well settled;
but at the time we were there spoiling it of its cedar, only here
and there amidst the lonely wilderness was there to be found a
settler's farm or stockman's hut. The blacks were occasionally, but
not often, troublesome. The stories they used to tell us about the
brush thereabouts being haunted by a great tall animal like a man
with his feet turned backwards, of much greater, however, than the
human stature, and covered with hair, and perpetually making a
frightful noise as he wandered about alone, made me sometimes doubt
whether they were themselves really terrified, or were merely
endeavouring to scare us away; but I very strongly incline to the
latter opinion. Be it as it may, there was no such consequence. We
were too well used to that lonely tree-guarded silence, broken only
by the clink of the rising saw, and to the damp unsunned ground,
with its thick brown covering of thousandfold rotting rustling
leaves, to have any very important new sensations to acquire
hereabouts. Tree after tree went crashing down before our
labourer's axe, and breaking a broad opening to the sky around its
stump; and pile after pile of square red plank arose in welcome
transformation on the spot, as our saw did its duty; and road after
road stretched straight away from the piles of cedar to the river's
edge, which as yet ran shallow and full of shoals and falls. Our
nearest neighbour of the settler genus was a strange eccentric old
sea captain. Apparently when he first commenced settler he had
plenty of money, with part of which he had bought a herd of cattle.
Wherever he went his sword was his inseparable companion&mdash;he
walked about flourishing it at the trees all day long. He had,
however, more reason for guarding himself from his own people than
from any one else; for his overseer was all the time branding lots
of his young cattle in his own name, whilst the old gentleman gave
him credit for being one of the most honest, trustworthy fellows on
the earth. The finale may be supposed&mdash;he was soon without a
feather to fly with. On the other side we had an old major of the
army, who, I believe, had a family, and was very poor. I heard that
when he first took possession of his land he was very well off; but
had impoverished himself greatly, as gentlemen settlers so very
often do, by expending their capital on everything but that which
really wants doing. They wish to make a complete farm at once, and
spare no cost to do so: consequently great paddocks are fenced in
before there is any stock that needs them; large pieces are
cleared, and next to nothing cropped; cottages with verandahs are
built, and the barn and the dairy neglected; and even carriage
walks are laid out for carriages, whose mere existence is among the
most improbable of dreams. A more melancholy lesson than that
furnished by the abovementioned two gentlemen and their next
neighbour down the river could not be formed by imagination itself.
At length we had exhausted all our provisions, and were obliged to
buy of our better supplied companions, whilst we got down to the
water's edge, whence it was to be rafted, all the plank we had cut.
But the flood which was necessary to float our raft over the falls
and shallows came not: so with no little reluctance we took another
month's provisions into the brush and set to again. This time our
pit was close to the river's side, on a slightly elevated space of
perhaps half an acre. For a few days more nothing of any moment
occurred, until at length the flood came. Those who have not
witnessed one of them can form but an inadequate idea of it from
description. The Australian rivers often rise twelve, twenty, and,
I think I have beard, some even thirty feet in a few hours. When
this happens in the night, a place may be surrounded, perhaps with
deep water, before any one is aware of his danger. A little while
before I came to England, I heard of a gentleman who had taken up
one of the streams beyond Liverpool Plains a large purchase of
sheep, and setting himself down on a slightly rising ground on the
bank, got up his buildings and went on for some time quite
unconscious of the imminent danger he was in. At length a sudden
and heavy flood came on, and he was surrounded by the backwater in
the bollows before he was aware. Gradually the vast deluge closed
in upon him: he got up into a tree, whence, after passing many
hours without food, under alternate rain and violent sunshine, he
was rescued, as the waters subsided, only to die bereft of reason.
These overwhelming floods are looked for annually or half-yearly,
and in some seasons come even oftener still. Though they do not do
so much damage to life as might be expected, the injury they do to
property is immense. Not long since, in the sheep-washing time, I
witnessed the destruction of a flock of sheep worth full
500<i>l</i>. in this way. They were camped for the night after
washing, and until they should get dry, on the large clean pebbles
of a dry part of the bed of the creek where they had been washed.
In the night it thundered heavily, and the storm burst in the
mountains; down came the flood without an instant's warning, and
was eight or ten feet deep in as many minutes, sweeping sheep and
hurdles away together and scattering them over the inundated plains
below.</p>

<p>Similar in kind, though not so deeply disastrous, was the
adventure that next awaited us in the brush. When we went to bed at
night in our little tent hut, we left the fire in front cheerfully
blazing with the pink lambent flame that so beautifully flickers
from the green cedar in combustion. Our tools and cooking utensils
lay strewed as usual within and just without the hut, or hung on
the lower branches of the saplings close about the fire. Our bed,
if indeed a sawyer's accommodations in that respect can be called a
bed, extended across the inner end of the hut, on four or five of
our outside slabs laid on a cross head log and another foot log,
each about six inches thick; where, by the bye, it may not be quite
inappropriate to remark, that they used to get so damp, or, more
correctly, wet, from the moisture of the perfectly soddened ground,
not 10 inches off, that if held to the fire they would steam like a
copper for a good half hour. I always imagined that after an
attempt to dry them at the fire, they felt thrice as wet as
otherwise. Every thing was just as usual when we went to bed; the
book I had been reading by the light of the fire after I had lain
down, I had deposited on the edge of the planks at my side; I went
to sleep with my eyes fixed on the fire, to a lullaby I had got
pretty well used to,&mdash;R &mdash;&mdash;'s composed bass snore.
The day had been sunny, and the night was temperate and still;
there was, in short, no indication whatever where we were of
falling weather. Some such, however, there must have been
somewhere, for about an hour after midnight I was disturbed by R
&mdash;&mdash; shaking me, and felt on the instant of waking a most
<i>unforgetable</i> sensation&mdash;I felt as if I were lying
stretched on a cold dungheap. Wide awake in a moment, I could see
by the light of a small flame that was still playing about an
elevated part of the wood at the fire, water in the hut and out of
the hut. Before I could take a second look, my mate jumped over me
and was in it nearly kneedeep and wading out of the hut. No sooner
was he there than he put his head in again, shouting, "Be alive,
mate; it's coming down as hard as it can come; it'll be over our
heads in half an hour." Out I sprang; my shoes were gone; I had
left them at the front of the hut, and probably they had floated
off among the very first things, my straw hat also bearing them
company. My clothes were safe, for I had put them under my
head&mdash;they are the bushman's pillow; but they were so wet that
putting them on was like getting in among the clothes in a washing
tub. By this time our little remnant of fire was nearly gone: R
&mdash;&mdash;, who was more used to such adventures than I, had
floated up to the hut a very large flat plank of cedar, which,
green as it may be, always swims well; and on it he placed the
little live charcoal that remained, freshening and feeding it with
some dry stuff from the roof of the hut. By his direction I waded
across to the pit, and drawing the saw, which the torrent was
already sweeping against and bending, out of the cut, I hung it up,
and the cross-cut saw with it, as high in a tree as I could reach,
to be fetched at our leisure. Our remaining provisions being on the
ground were all spoiled, we knew; but the blankets we got out; the
bed we left, for it was of wool, and wet as it was would have sunk
us. Drawing our plank up to a tree we got on it, sitting with the
fire between us; the current was so strong, even amidst the thick
brush where we were, that it was all we could do together to hold
on to a sapling apiece and to keep our plank from being swept away.
Where we were no dead timber of any size could be swept against us;
but we could hear it striking together, and grinding and crashing
in the river a few yards off. The little light we had dazzled our
eyes so that the sky seemed a vast dark void. The rats swam boldly
up and got on the plank with us, and numbers of spiders and
centipedes, guided no doubt by the fire, were crawling in all
directions over both us and it. In this state we had to continue at
least three good hours; then day began to down. We knew we were
rising by getting more and more near the branches, but we had no
notion how deep the water had become around us. Our fire was out
for want of fuel; and as the deep obscurity of the brush began to
be dissolved by the dawn, we could discern no vestige of our hut;
and presently, when the light so far increased that we could see as
far as the pit, we discovered that the water was up to the bottom
of the log that was on, so that there was about 6 feet depth.
Although it was now light we were nearly as bad off as ever. The
sounds of such a deluge in the night, in the midst of the brush,
are certainly cowing to the spirits; but one knows so well that the
danger, except from actual drowning, is next to nothing, and there
are such plentiful means for escaping by getting up the trees, that
after all it makes no very serious impression. The loneliness and
fear of starving were what most affected me: we could not tell but
it might last for many days; and as long as it lasted there seemed
no hope of getting across the river. On this side we were so
surrounded by brush, that any attempt to get our plank through to
the high ground was out of the question, and it was much too deep
to wade. The raw chilly air of the morning and the water together
made me shiver until I was quite sick, and my mate was not much
better. We both of us felt that to continue exposed thus, without
food, would soon wear us out, so that we should not be able to make
an effort to save ourselves by swimming the river. In this
undecided and helpless state we passed the time until nearly noon,
the water rising higher and higher. A thought struck me at last,
that the overhanging boughs of the trees on opposite sides of the
river meeting in the middle, we might, by holding on to them,
prevent ourselves from being swept away whilst we floated our plank
across; and then about 100 yards would bring us across the flat on
the other side, which was of forest timber, not brush, to the foot
of the range. This, as my mate suggested, was all very well until
we came to be across the river, but then we should be worse than
ever. The stream was so strong on the forest land, and the trees so
far apart, that we should neither be able to paddle across nor pull
ourselves on by hand from tree to tree. All this was clearly but
too true; what to do we knew not; but we concluded the chance was
better on the other side than where we were, so, as far as we
could, we put our plan into execution, which was a matter of very
little difficulty. What followed has been a memento to me ever
since never to despair. The inundated flat at the part where we
reached it was several hundred feet wide, but we immediately
noticed that about a quarter of a mile farther down there was a
creek with trees all along it running from a gap in the range to
the river. Letting ourselves down the edge of the river from tree
to tree, we then made our way up the creek in the same manner, and
reached the high land as heartily pleased with our escape as men
could be; but so tired of the uneasy saddle on which we had now
been for many hours, and our legs so benumbed that we actually
could not stand on them, but crawled up the range to the high road
on our knees. I was not well for years afterwards; indeed, I
attribute to the wet and cold of this night an illness I had long
subsequently. If I were to say I have never been entirely well
since, I should not misstate the fact, and I know of no other cause
which I could suppose to have brought about so suddenly this change
for the worse in a constitution hitherto uninjured.</p>

<p>As soon as we got to rights we set off down the river to where
our cedar was stacked for rafting. In the brush we knew all was
flooded away but the saws and the iron tools which would not swim.
But we had no apprehensions of any further loss. To our great
vexation we found that the man who had drawn the plank had stacked
it so that nearly one-half of it was carried away. A few planks
only which had got jammed close at hand we recovered; these with
what remained at the stack we got down into the water as soon as it
was sufficiently abated, and forming it into a raft sent it down
the stream to the boat by a good hand at the work, who lost only a
single plank by the way. Knowing nobody would meddle with our saws,
and having nothing else of value in the brush, we did not go back
to the pit, but proceeded to Sydney with our stuff. We could only
take about a third part by the first boat, but gave authority to
the skippers of two other crafts to bring the rest. The whole
arrived in Port Jackson about a fortnight after ourselves. Our
total gain was a little over 30<i>l</i>. apiece.</p>

<p>With that elasticity of spirit which attends a labouring life,
we soon forgot our loss; and nothing else more profitable offering,
we prepared for our return. It is no rare thing for a sawyer to
abandon his tools under such circumstances as ours were if some
more advantageous job presents itself to him whilst away. Our
"spell" meantime was spent very pleasantly with our friends at
&mdash;&mdash;. It was now as much my home as R &mdash;&mdash;'s,
and I have often thought since we were if possible even more like
brothers than we have been since. Whilst I was at &mdash;&mdash;, M
&mdash;&mdash;'s elder brother came down the country with cattle;
and although nearly twenty years older than my mate, and therefore
much older than myself, I liked him very well. There are very few
Australians that one can dislike.</p>

<p>A general manly spirit and fairness of feeling characterize all
except a few bullies of the very lowest class, and a few pampered
half idiots of the very highest. In my new and increasingly
esteemed friend M &mdash;&mdash; a great and evident improvement
had taken place; and it is but fair and reasonable to suppose a
similar improvement would take place under similar circumstances in
the whole body of the Australian females. She had read all the
books I left behind to such purpose that there was no part of any
of them that I happened to mention on reading them subsequently but
she immediately recollected. In a country where no letters pass to
and fro, at least in the rank of life in which we were, such a
change in a friend's mind and general character is very observable.
I must say I felt a little mortified to find myself so much less
benefited. Certainly I had had less leisure, and that which I had
had was generally in hours of weariness and exhaustion. Among the
incomplete volumes was a small 12mo. book of Algebra. This had
greatly excited my curiosity&mdash;perhaps I should give the
feeling some more respectable name. It was not merely the desire to
know what the book was about, but to know that about which the book
treated. A gentleman settler near &mdash;&mdash; had a schoolmaster
for his children who had the reputation of being a very good
scholar. He was a prisoner moreover. To him I applied, and for a
little remuneration the poor fellow came every evening and gave me
instruction in the science in question. He took so much pains with
me, and explained everything initiatory so clearly, that by the
time we set off to the nor'ard again I was advanced sufficiently to
go on by myself. Not to forestall my narrative in any other
respect, I cannot but remark that I found it a never-failing field
for the most exalted exercise of the mind. It also gave me habits
of steady attention, self-possession in thought, and voluntary
consciousness, that have been of great service to me since in
surmounting difficulties in business, as well as in steadily
adhering to the line of the necessary and useful in carrying out my
purposes at large.</p>

<p>Matters of this kind will interest the reader of course but
little in comparison with the transactions and manners of
Australian life. I therefore return to my history. R &mdash;&mdash;
and I resolved to take on this second trip a large quantity of
provisions beyond what we anticipated using ourselves, and exchange
them with the sawyers near us for plank. I think our invoice from
Messrs &mdash;&mdash; and Co., to whom we gave the order, was some
little over 100<i>l</i>. Our stock consisted of rum, tobacco, tea,
sugar, various kinds of ready-made clothing, and clothing material
unmade, together with a few files, knives, razors, &amp;c.; we got
them all in safety by water and by land to the brush; and after one
of those wretched, senseless jollifications at the edge of the
brush which sawyers will have whenever they can get rum, we moved
into the brush, collected our tools and the wreck of our cooking
utensils, built a fresh and better but of cedar slabs, stowed our
goods, and went to work again. Our goods sold very well, and we
again fell upon a very fair cluster of trees. The work went on as
usual, and we this time got the whole of the plank safe to Sydney.
We made 69<i>l</i>. odd a-piece by the lot of cedar, and cleared
about 40<i>l</i>. a-piece by the goods. All this was in about five
months, which we considered very good work. One incident only of a
much more unpleasant than unusual character marks this period: a
lot of sawyers from various pits had met at the old sea captain's
farm, where a large cask of brandy had arrived. After letting them
drink very freely he took it into his head not to let them have any
more. This at first they would not submit to; but the old
gentleman, who by the bye was not at all behindhand with them in
their own way, showed such very strong symptoms of using his sword
such very strong symptoms of using his sword and pistols that they
thought best to decamp. A council of war was then held, and some
one suggesting that I and my mate had a lot of rum still left, down
they came in a body to the amount of about twelve or fifteen. At
first we did not much heed the shouting and shrieking in every tone
and dialect from that of cockneyism to that of the Irish province
which is commonly said to be a mile beyond his Satanic majesty's
residence; but it came nearer and nearer and nearer. At last it
crossed the river, and came up our road through the brush; and by
the time we were out at the fire in our shirts the whole corps
debouched before us: some wore check shirts, some wore woolen; some
were in red ones, and some in blue, and some in none at all; some
had straw hats, some Scotch caps, some old working skull-caps, some
nothing but their own shock heads of hair; some had sticks in their
hands, some the ration-bags they had been to get filled, some the
axe they had been sharpening at the grindstone, and some three or
four ribs of salted beef for to-morrow's dinner; some sung; some
yelled, some said nothing, but the one unanimous demand was the
remainder of our stock of rum. All my remonstrances were
ineffectual. I was told at last that if I did not give it they
would take it, and put me on the fire for a back-log. Of course
further parley was useless; I brought it out, and they set to at it
with all the panikins they could muster. R &mdash;&mdash;, whose
habituation to such emergencies from his infancy rendered him much
more a match for them than I was, employed himself in getting hold
of every vessel full that he could and pouring it out unobserved on
the ground; and as they were filling only pint and quart pots this
proceeding soon lowered their stock; and by sunrise it was all
gone. They then gradually began to disperse: a couple, however,
took possession of our bed and slept all day; and after having
their supper with us at night went home. Such affairs are pretty
well understood to be only jokes, and no ill will is allowed to be
borne about them afterwards. We took nothing for the liquor, though
several offered to pay their "whack." I could not reconcile it to
my conscience to take any payment for it, for it would not do to
tell them how it had been disposed of; and unless we had let them
pay for what they had not had, that seemed unavoidable. There was
likewise another reason of a more serious and painful character.
One of the topmen was a sad brutal fellow when intoxicated; and in
going home he quarrelled with his pitman and gave him a blow from
which he never recovered. The poor fellow had first to leave off
work, then to go to the settlement and put himself under the
doctor's hands, and at last, after lingering a few weeks, died. I
almost felt as if his blood was on my head, and from that day forth
have never either sold or given to anybody spirituous liquors of
any kind. My own consolation was that they had taken it by force;
and that they had done so while in a state in which I would never
have furnished them with it of my own free will. Such unhappy
events will happen to the most guarded. If, when they do occur, we
take them up heartily as cautions, we do all that it can fairly be
said we could do.</p>

<p>As long as the trees continued tolerably plentiful in this brush
we continued in it, sending freights to Sydney and getting back
goods of various sorts for sale; but when good timber began to grow
scarce, and we found ourselves obliged to make a fresh pit to
almost each tree we cut, and even these few were very small, we
resolved to shift at once. Many of the more restless spirits were
off before us to the Manning river, still farther north, and fresh
accounts came daily to those who remained of the richness of the
brushes in that part of the country. Stray hands wandering back
were already dropping in every now and then at some of our pits for
a few days' "bange" (rest) on their way to Sydney, or back again
from Sydney to the Manning brushes, after selling their loads and
spending their money. During the period that had elapsed from our
return to the brush and our leaving it finally, we cleared about
69<i>l</i>. a-piece by the sale of goods after paying freight and
allowing for losses, and, as may be supposed, bad debts&mdash;not
scarce among such customers any more than in other parts of this
our habitable globe. Several ran away without paying us: from most
we had to take cedar in payment. But this latter circumstance was
advantageous rather than otherwise, as we made a timber-merchant's
profit on the cedar also. Barter properly conducted is always the
most beneficial species of commerce, as you get a gain both on the
article you sell originally, and a second in the commodity you have
received in payment. Besides our gain in these transactions we
cleared about 40<i>l</i>. a-piece by our second lot of timber. This
was very little comparatively with what it would have been but for
the increasing scarcity of trees for the last three months of the
time. I heard of one pair of sawyers in this brush during its best
days, who cut 35<i>l</i>. worth of plank in a fortnight&mdash;this
was nearly 9<i>l</i>. a-week each man. But they were both
first-rate workmen and very strong; one an Irishman, and the other
of American negro descent; and I believe there was a sort of
rivalry of strength and hardihood between them, and they were
trying which could knock up the other: these feats are the chief
ambition of sawyers. A few miles below us on the river were a great
many little settlers: we used to stop at their farms in going to
Sydney or Maitland; and strange as our habits in the brush were,
some of theirs, I used to think, were stranger still. At least we
had neither wife nor children to care for; but they not
unfrequently had large families. Several times I have known a
dealing boat come up to a farm on the bank of the stream just after
the new wheat was threshed out, and before it left have the whole
on board in exchange for rum. I have sometimes seen attempts to
represent the majority of the small settlers of New South Wales as
of this character. Such, however, is decidedly the reverse of the
truth, and must have been the representation of either some
superficial tourist, or of one of those individuals (a much larger
number than is usually supposed) who have published accounts of
this colony to subserve the designs of their party on public and
legislative opinion in England.</p>

<p>We were not long in Sydney before we were again out of it on our
way to &mdash;&mdash;. Our friends received us joyfully; but my
mate's father and mother were evidently both of them breaking fast.
The old man still worked on the ground, but Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; was
become quite bedridden and nearly blind. M &mdash;&mdash; attended
her with a ceaseless, quiet watchfulness. It was as if the mother
and the child had changed places: the parent was all
unconsciousness, weakness, want; the daughter vigilance, activity,
and love. I have often thought that I perceived that the roughest
men have the gentlest hearts: my mate furnished me with another
fact. When R &mdash;&mdash;, who by the bye was the favourite,
being the youngest, saw what his sister was become to his mother,
be seemed for some time unable to comprehend it; but at last, after
some time, he quite understood it, and, in singular variation of
his usual custom, he took her in his arms and hugged her. The power
of love is very wonderful. Here was a man nearly six feet high, and
as strong as a young ox, with the tears running down his cheeks
over an old woman and a girl. If, a little while before, as he went
through the town of &mdash;&mdash;, any acquaintance had proposed
it to him by way of recreation, he would have pulled off his jacket
and fought for a couple of hours. Goodness has certainly more
tendency to beautify the countenance than we give it credit for in
our daily scheme of cause and effect. Though I do not easily go in
ecstasies, I could not help loving M &mdash;&mdash; more than ever.
The books, too, seemed to have done wonders for her; so I resolved,
after we had been at home a few days, to go to Sydney and buy a
good collection. My former purchase I had read till I knew them
almost by heart. It never struck me, however, at this time that
there was any one course in acquiring knowledge better than
another, so that my selection could not be expected to be a very
wise one. My notion was simply this: for myself, more books of
history, sufficient to give me a clear and connected view of the
progress of mankind from the earliest period; a treatise on the
more advanced branches of algebra; a new Euclid, my first being
among the books lost in the flood at the brush; and Watts's Logic,
of which a few leaves only had come into my possession among the
fragments in the former lot: for M &mdash;&mdash;, chiefly poetry;
it seemed to me her favourite reading; and probably I was not much
wrong in considering that the actualities of life are so forced on
women in new countries, that they acquire inevitably from them
their education in matters of common sense, and so may properly
enough indulge in book studies of an almost exclusively imaginative
cast. It turned out, however, that I became relieved from the
responsibility of the selection. She got a friend to take charge of
her mother for a day, and went to Sydney with me, and chose quite a
different lot from what I should have chosen for her, and fewer by
far. I bought just what I had laid it down to myself that I would
buy, and, additionally, about fifteen numbers of the Edinburgh
Review. This latter part of my selection was from this time for
some years forward my favourite reading; I find it to be the
authority which directed more or less my views on most
subjects.</p>

<p>After spending between five and six weeks at home, R
&mdash;&mdash; and I went to work; it was the last job we cut
together, making our third year. A friend of R &mdash;&mdash;'s
proposed to him to take a share in a coasting craft, and run it in
the cedar trade. R &mdash;&mdash; again proposed that I should be
taken into the concern, dividing it into three shares. I had my
misgivings; but the profits were very tempting. We joined in the
boat, and in a lot of provisions and other goods for sale. Our
first trip happened at a very opportune juncture. The whole of the
parties cutting on the river had run short of flour, tobacco, and
tea, three most profitable articles. We bought our tea at
2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. and sold it at 6<i>s</i>.; our tobacco (good
Hawkesbury) at 1<i>s</i>. and sold it at 3<i>s</i>.; our flour we
made about sixty per cent. on. As there are always idle men about
these brushes where sawing is going on, either sawyers without
mates, or bullock-drivers out of work, or labourers, we soon
succeeded in getting a good fall of timber pointed out to us. We
had, however, to give our guide 3<i>l</i>. for his information, and
take him on as our faller; but we found him such an unsettled
fellow that we were glad, after a couple of weeks, to give him
2<i>l</i>., beside his wages of 1<i>l</i>. a week, to go away.
Being paid by the piece, men acquire a habit of working so eagerly
that a great proportion are either working on day after day in the
utmost suffering, if they are what are called "good men;" or else
they give in every second or third day, and stroll about till the
covetous fit comes on again. Of this last class was our lad. He was
called <i>J &mdash;&mdash; the Liar</i>. Descriptive titles of a
similar kind are very common, indeed almost universal.</p>

<p>The fall of timber that J &mdash;&mdash; the Liar (I am delicate
about giving the baptismal name of the individual in full. The fact
is there are several sawyers who enjoy the latter part of this
graceful appellative, but their individual names differ. I should
be sorry to wound the feelings of my former friends, or of such of
them as may be yet alive, by too pointed a description); the fall
of timber that <i>The Liar</i> (it is quite a common and
inoffensive abbreviation, dear reader, among ourselves) showed us,
turned out a capital one. Numbers of the trees were 60 feet in the
barrel without a limb, and so thick that as they lay on the hill
side after they were down, I could barely lay my hand on the top of
them at 10 and 15 feet from the butt. They were very generally
sound, and many of them as round as stone pillars, and they lay for
the most part on the hill sides, so that rolling them to the pit
was effected by merely slackening chocks away from them in front,
instead of heaving them along by handspikes and levers as is done
on level ground; though, be it observed, letting logs down hill in
this way is much the most dangerous work; lastly, they lay so
grouped that numbers of logs came to the same pit. There was one
drawback, however, which to civilised ears may seem a serious one;
we had to make most of the pits in creeks, and if it came on to
rain ever so little, the brush ground already saturated turned off
the whole of the falling water into the creeks; thus my mate often
had to work up to his knees in water for several days together. We
kept to one hut all the time, having fixed ourselves deep down the
descent of one of the hill points in a sort of basin, where five
creeks met, so as to be near the water and the work. It was a
lonely place, where you heard nothing but the perpetual plashing of
the creeks, and once or twice a day the thunder of a falling tree,
or sometimes in the still warm noon the startling note of the
coachman-bird, or the no less wonderful mimicry of the mocking-bird
imitating the shrill grating of our files in sharpening the saw so
exactly, that we often could not believe but that some other pair
had come and set in close to us. Countless, and motionless, and
gigantic stood the forest army, up and down all the hill sides
around us; in strong contrast to this, stood the great red piles of
plank, squared with mathematical exactness, which spoke of
<i>man</i> <i>and labour</i>. How simple the lesson that contrast
read, and yet how grave! This toil-bearer must have a motive; he
must want something that he has not;&mdash;he must be unhappy.</p>

<p>In this wilderness we passed more than twelve months, and before
this time my mate too had become a great reader; so between the
work, and the obstacles to be overcome in getting the plank dragged
out of such a hole (which had to be done by spare-chaining it along
the ground, a plank at a time), and the books, we got through the
twelve months pretty well. Near us we found another little group of
trees, which we should probably have stayed to cut, but that a
messenger came to tell my mate (there being no post) that his
mother had died at last rather suddenly. As I could see, though he
could not himself, that he had but little design of coming back, I
took care, after shipping the last of our cedar, to accompany it,
with all our tools and other possessions. Our trip to Sydney was a
pleasant one; and our cedar sold better than any lot we had had:
and nothing but the sorrowful cause of our sudden journey to Sydney
impaired the cheerfulness of our feelings and of our prospects.</p>

<p>SOME months glided away, and found me still at &mdash;&mdash;,
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; was gone, but not forgotten. In the solitary
bush she had never had to drill her children into the many
unnatural habits of old societies, and they had loved her all the
more. Her companion too through many years and various fortunes
walked about among us like an absent man. He was more affectionate
to his children, and more friendly to me; yet there was something
in his manner like that of a man among strangers. As I expected, my
mate had no inclination to go back to the Manning; and no longer
there to look after our interests in the cedar-boat, we considered
it best to part with our shares. For some time we employed
ourselves in helping the old man through the heaviest of the farm
business; afterwards we went all round the farm, mending the
fences. Then I went up the country with R &mdash;&mdash;, to look
at a piece of land he had had offered him for purchase by another
native. And lastly, after several weeks of idleness, I went to
Sydney and ripped cedar plank into boards in a timber merchant's
yard. At this I made very poor wages, and was far from contented.
Our last year's work in the Manning River brash had yielded us
about 2<i>l</i>. each a-week all through. The profit on the goods
we disposed of was about 70<i>l</i>. each; and the net gain by
freights and by the cedar we took in exchange, and in payment for
freight, was rather above 100<i>l</i>. each. The utmost I could
clear by cedar ripping for the timber merchants was about
1<i>l</i>. a-week after paying rations and lodging, and wear and
tear, and all those innumerable gills of rum that a sawyer is
called upon for in Sydney, when he is known to be pretty well off,
by his less thrifty brethren. So circumstanced, I was beginning to
plan no less a thing than the purchase of a piece of land in the
township of &mdash;&mdash;; to cut some stuff in the adjacent bush,
and run up two or three snug little weather-boarded cottages, and
rent them out. I often wonder whether others observe it, but I
certainly have, that whenever I have concocted some well-promising
plan, and even when everything has been finally determined in my
mind, some circumstance, either unforeseen or under estimated, has
presented itself and rendered advisable the relinquishment of my
laboured scheme, and the adoption of another at an hour's notice.
This was the case now. As I proceed more minutely to describe the
circumstances which thus suddenly changed my plans, it will readily
be conjectured that similar events are by no means uncommon in a
great stock country like New South Wales. Cattle were at this
period the staple article of internal traffic; and that traffic
proceeded under all forms, and between all parties, and in every
place where men meet. Sometimes it was simple barter; sometimes a
sale; sometimes it was in the regular course of business; at others
a mere capricious chaffer; sometimes it was with due inspection of
the beasts in the yard or on the run; and occasionally even on bare
description, or to use the common phrase, "unsight, unseen." But
the chief of this dealing went on as may be supposed among the
stockmen or those whose particular business is the herding and
driving of cattle. Great numbers of these men at the time I speak
of, though more particularly in still earlier times, held cattle;
many indeed became large stock-masters. Sometimes for years they
took their wages in cattle; every odd pound they could muster was
laid by to add to the little herd thus accumulating by some good
bargain for cash: and I do think it was by no means an uncommon
occurrence for some kindly beast to stray of a dark night into the
little herd, without any such common-place reasons as rank under
the head of exchange, and never find his way out again. Poor men do
many things by the example of their betters; it would not always be
easy to say which they are. Nor does the question now remain one of
much importance: legislation has well-nigh done its work; almost
every facility for such a process is done away. Where once twenty
poor men rose gradually into substance, I should think scarce one
rises now. At the time referred to, however, almost every third
person in the enjoyment of freedom had a few head of cattle; and
the perpetual system of exchange I have referred to was its grand
concomitant. Of course in such a country and under such
circumstances, plenty of sales were effected that jeopardized alike
the seller and the buyer. Doubtless in many instances the buyer was
fully aware of the illegal character of the transaction; but in
hundreds more he fell into the snare merely through a blind
cupidity, or even was led into it by the unsuspecting uprightness
of his own nature. In the instance more particularly in hand I
believe there was a commixture of the two cases. The victim was a
hard-striving and perhaps greedy man; but in him along with this
worse were mingled (no rare case) the better inclinations of a
strong and unequivocal uprightness of natural character. With these
premises, the reader will be fully prepared to understand what I am
now to give&mdash;the history of such a case.</p>

<p>A messenger came to me in Sydney and called me off the pit, and
told me I was particularly and instantly wanted at &mdash;&mdash;,
and a note from M &mdash;&mdash; accompanied the message, urging me
not to lose a minute. I washed, and telling the man I was working
with to get a mate and go on till I came back, I hired a horse and
was at &mdash;&mdash; within a couple of hours. There I found M
&mdash;&mdash;, amusing a fine little boy eighteen months old, and
with her was a very pretty young woman, its mother. The night
before, as they were going to supper, she came up to the house door
and asked for M &mdash;&mdash;, who knew her immediately as an old
schoolfellow. She and the baby were wet through to the skin, for
she had travelled from &mdash;&mdash; in a settler's cart without a
tilt, and it had been raining almost the whole afternoon. As soon
as she could communicate with M &mdash;&mdash;, she told her that
her husband, whom I had often heard of by the name of Tom
&mdash;&mdash;, was to meet her in the bush at the corner of our
paddock that night; that there was a warrant out against him from
the bench nearest which they lived; that was between 100 and 150
miles from Sydney; and that he had only had just time to escape
before the constables reached their hut to execute it. He had sent
her word by a man he could trust to meet him here on this evening
at eleven o'clock; and it was the atmost she could do through an
unexpected hindrance to arrive by the time. It appeared they had
but one child, and were very fond of one another. He had possessed
himself of a good herd of cattle by his economy and industry, but
one false step had ruined all; and now no chance remained of
retaining his liberty and family but getting away unknown from the
colony. He had come to the corner of the fence according to
appointment the night before, and was now "in plant" (hiding) in
the creek till night again. His journey down the country had been a
sore one, as he had had to keep off the road all day and only take
it by night.</p>

<p>Mrs. D &mdash;&mdash; was the only child of a small settler, and
had had cattle worth about 150<i>l</i>. left her by her father. Her
husband, who had been for many years a stockman at one of the far
out stations after he became free, married her when he was about
thirty-three, only three years before, possessed of about
200<i>l</i>. worth of stock of his own of various kinds. This,
which was a very good beginning, he had improved considerably. From
all I could learn of his character, I am sure D &mdash;&mdash; had
not the most distant design of a dishonest deal in the purchase of
the beast which he was now charged with buying, knowing it to be
stolen. One of the Government hands of a large and influential
settler close to where D &mdash;&mdash; had settled, had been
allowed by his master to accumulate a lot of cattle, and depasture
them on his run; and when his sentence was expired, not having any
other place to take them to, and his master ordering him to take
them off his run, he asked D &mdash;&mdash; to buy them. D
&mdash;&mdash; for a long time refused, and when at last he did buy
them, it was because the man could not get them in off the run for
want of a horse; and of course only somebody who already knew them
in the bush would buy them there. Buying them under these
circumstances, D &mdash;&mdash; gave only about twothirds of their
market price for them; considering that he did the man a favour to
buy them at all. Among them was a cow which D &mdash;&mdash; knew
the man had been in possession of for above two years, and which he
had no more reason for suspecting to be a stolen beast than any of
the others. As soon as the money was paid, the man left that part
of the country, and D &mdash;&mdash; heard no more of him till a
stockman from quite a distant county, in passing through the run in
search of strayed horses, claimed the cow as belonging to his
master; and D &mdash;&mdash; then on inquiry found the seller was
gone out of the country, leaving him to "stand the racket."</p>

<p>This man's master had long wanted D &mdash;&mdash;'s run, which
separated his own from a fine tract in the mountains that was never
likely to be bought by anybody, on account of its being deficient
in water; and according to all I heard upon the subject afterwards,
he now did all he could to get the owner of the beast to prosecute
D &mdash;&mdash;, that by getting him out of the way he might have
his run, and secure the free run on government ground attached to
it. I am sorry to say that it is too common a thing for the great
settlers in New South Wales to endeavour to get rid of the small
settlers near them, for similar reasons, by any means that offer
themselves. If I recollect right, the jury that tried the criminal
cases at &mdash;&mdash; sessions at this time was constituted of
military officers chosen for the occasion from the regiments in the
colony; and these gentlemen dining with D &mdash;&mdash;'s
neighbour the magistrate, whose government man had sold the cow,
would naturally hear of the cause beforehand, and, prejudiced by
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s account of D &mdash;&mdash;, would come to the
court fully prepared to look at the evidence against him in a very
serious light. In short he had no reasonable ground for hoping for
an acquittal.</p>

<p>M &mdash;&mdash;'s object in sending for me from Sydney was
twofold: she knew the cattle would be a great bargain, as they must
be sold for ready money; and she also knew that I had enough in the
&mdash;&mdash; bank for the whole purchase; and was looking for
some mode of laying it out. She also wished me to undertake the
negotiation for &mdash;&mdash;'s passage away from the colony and
to see him off.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;'s offer when I saw him, which was not till after
dark in the evening, was a very good one. He offered me four
capital brood mares, two of which had foals at their sides, for
100<i>l</i>. and the whole of his cattle, large and small, at
2<i>l</i>. a-head. I closed with the offer directly, provided both
horses and horned cattle turned out on inspection as he had
represented them.</p>

<p>Purchasing his stock was far from an entire removal of all the
poor fellow's difficulties and dangers. He had still to go up the
country to the very place where it was most dangerous for him to
muster the cattle and deliver them to me. His wife's being here
again was almost sure to become known to the police; and then he
would be watched for here. But the greatest difficulty was that of
getting clear out of the colony; for accounts are sent to the
Sydney police-office of defaulters from all parts of the colony,
and the constables search every ship that goes out of the
Heads.</p>

<p>As we were to start the very next morning up the country, this
was perhaps the last time he might see his wife and child for many
months, even if successful in escaping. After she had put her child
to sleep, nothing could keep the poor trembling wife away from her
husband. I carried them two large sheets of bark into the thick
scrub beside the creek where &mdash;&mdash; was concealed; for
about midnight it began to rain quite fast. One sheet of bark was
leaned against a tree on the windward side to turn the rain; the
other made a sort of dry flooring for them to sit on. They could
not have any fire on account of the danger of its attracting
notice. But &mdash;&mdash; provided them with some blankets and a
large overcoat, and then sat up all night taking care of her
friend's child. Its plaintive cries were most heart-moving as it
waked at times through the long hours and missed its customary
nurse.</p>

<p>Directly it was light &mdash;&mdash; and I started, leaving
&mdash;&mdash; to arrange whilst we were absent for a passage by a
vessel that was to sail in about twelve days. The poor fellow
seemed as if he could never drag himself away from his wife and
child. When we did set off it rained as if it would blind us; no
comfortable commencement of such a trip. But it had one good
consequence&mdash;it kept the people indoors; so that we arrived at
the Hawkesbury punt almost without meeting an individual. Once over
the river we considered ourselves safe, for we immediately struck
off into the Curryjong Mountains, a vast pile of hills heaped on
hills, and covered with forests and brushes so thickly, that you
walk beneath and amidst them in perpetual shadow, and can only get
along in some places by main force. Here we were past the police of
the thickly settled districts, and off the track they take from the
large interior settlements to Sydney. The Curryjong mountains have
the appearance rather of a multitude of hills piled confusedly
together than of what is more strictly considered mountain. At this
time a few very poor settlers had opened just on one little patch
of country, the faces of the hills, and their fields of yellow
grain were bending, and in some places were already quite flattened
by the torrents of rain that kept pouring down. Here and there a
boy minding some pigs on the road side and with the utmost
difficulty keeping them out of the corn; and once or twice a
settler driving a cow home for the evening milking; and the old
miller with his arms folded and his shoulder against the door-post,
standing looking out of the door of the water-mill that clacks and
rumbles on in the dark hollow, were all the human life we saw. I
knew my guide was a good bushman, and also what reasons he had for
doing his part well, or I should not have followed him very
readily. We went on, on, on up the slippery hill (for the soil is
of the finest description) till it seemed as if we were getting
above the world. Below us on every side was a vast rolling ocean of
vapour. On us still poured the ceaseless rain till we had not a dry
thread about us. At length we came to an abrupt fall of the ground,
down the precipitous declivity of which our descent was effected
with great caution and labour. Here we stood at the commencement of
a long thicket of brushwood, through which the track was in some
places so intricate and bewildering, and so toilsome to travel,
that on hearing its character from &mdash;&mdash; I coincided in
his opinion that it would be best for us to camp for the night in
one of the ghibber-gunyahs. These are the hollows under overhanging
rocks, and afford a most welcome shelter where they are met with in
wet weather. Their aspect is at first rather terrific: of course no
rain penetrates through their roof; but a space equal sometimes to
the area of a very large room is offered to the drenched traveller
to kindle his fire and shelter himself for the night. My
fellow-traveller, who well knew the bush hereabouts, soon led the
way to a capacious and snug retreat of this kind; and lighting a
fire and betaking ourselves to our provisions we soon felt
ourselves quite snug for the night. The rest of the evening was
fully occupied in talking over our business, and in consulting that
ever faithful counsellor the pipe. At length, outworn by travel and
the previous night's watching, we slept. The next morning the
rising sun was slanting in upon us when we awoke. After a hearty
breakfast on we went again. To tell what thickets tangled, thorny,
endless (as it seemed) we went through that day, what damp and
sombre chasms we crossed, what wet and mossy crags we climbed, and
what leaf-strewn solitary woods we made our way through, might
weary the reader, but could give him no adequate notion of the
scenes themselves. &mdash;&mdash;'s acquaintance with the bush here
arose from his having been employed under a surveyor in the
Curryjong and adjacent country before he was assigned to private
service. He pointed out to me one creek accompanied with this
tale:&mdash;"I found two dead men's bones on that creek when I was
here with the surveyor; he sent me and another man to run that
creek up as far as we could, to see what it led to; and after we
had gone about seven miles we came to a lot of bones scattered
about on a little flat. On looking at them we found they were the
bones of two men. They were quite bare, and the native dogs had
dragged them limb from limb, except the ribs, which were still fast
to the backbone. Bits of their woollen garments were still about,
but nothing more except their irons. One man's irons were still on
one of his leg bones, but the other pair of irons were lying apart.
The bones were as white as chalk with the sun and rain. It was the
most shocking sight I ever saw. They were, no doubt, two poor
fellows who had run away from a gang, lost themselves, and had
wandered about till they were starved." Much like this was our
travelling for four whole days. Once only we emerged on to the
regular mountain road at a public house; and after a little
variation of our fare, by a single meal of fresh pork and a couple
of glasses of rum, took to the bush again.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the fifth day we drew near our journey's
end. It was a pleasant sunny day till toward night, when the
weather again grew stormy and wild. We came into the creek on which
D &mdash;&mdash;'s hut was situated several miles below it.
Following the channel up among the hills, we turned at length an
elbow whence we obtained an uninterrupted view up a reach of about
half a mile, at the end of which was the hut and stockyard. These
were built on a little flat, back from the steep edge of the creek;
and the only thing belonging to the station that we could descry
was a very small tent hut on the brink of the lofty bank on the
opposite side, or rather at the end of the vista where the creek
again swept suddenly round to the right. This was the man's hut who
looked after the cattle, and had been built there for the sake of
seeing a long way down the creek, so as to have the milking cattle
in his eye as much as possible. It was now a matter of some concern
whether any unwelcome visitor was staying at the large hut which D
&mdash;&mdash; and his wife usually occupied, or whether any such
was lurking on the watch in the surrounding bush. To ascertain this
I went on alone, D &mdash;&mdash; keeping out of sight among the
wattles of the creek: if the stockman told me all was right, I was
to float my pocket handkerchief in the wind, standing on the edge
of the creek; otherwise I was merely to stand there without doing
so. With beating heart I made my way up to the station; for I had
found D &mdash;&mdash;, though rather too fond of himself in
matters of business, such a free-hearted, manly fellow as a
companion that I felt the greatest interest in his success. On
reaching the stockman's hut I found it empty of inhabitants: but
there was a newly baked cake, indeed not yet cold; the fire also
was not covered over with ashes, which is the usual way of keeping
wood smouldering a long time without burning out. It was therefore
clear that the stockman had lately been here, and would not be long
away. I was therefore obliged to give D &mdash;&mdash; the signal
to remain where he was for the present. In an hour or so Jerry the
stockman came back; and after cautiously effecting an understanding
with him, and ascertaining that all was safe, I told him where his
master was, and he "cooeed" for him and gave the signal for him to
come on. All was certainly safe enough; for one or other of the
&mdash;&mdash; police came every day or two, pretending to be
passing from the settlement to some station farther out; and one
had called "to light his pipe" only an hour before, and Jerry had
walked with him a couple of miles to show him a short cut, which
was the reason of his absence when we arrived. As there was no fear
of any further intrusion that night we congratulated ourselves on
our good fortune, and with more easy minds than we had had for some
hours, took our supper. There was a lot of capital dogs, kangaroo,
bull, mastiff, terrier, and mongrel. These when I reached the hut
were along with Jerry, or I should not have made my entrance as I
did; for when they came back a little in advance of him, and found
me sitting in the tent hut, they ranged themselves across the
entrance and growled most surlily, and seemed well inclined to come
in and pull me out. But now they did us good service, rushing off
every now and then, especially as the night became darker and
darker, in the direction of the slightest noise. Late in the
evening a light mizzling rain came on again; but we still kept to
the little tent hut for the sake of D &mdash;&mdash;'s readier
escape, should escape become necessary. The large hut was
surrounded by a level flat cleared of timber, and might have been
easily surrounded; but the tent hut being on the brink of the creek
afforded a certain means of flight down the bank. D &mdash;&mdash;
tied a couple of his sharpest dogs, one about two hundred yards up
the channel of the creek from the hut, and the other about two
hundred yards down. If any one approached up or down the creek, the
dogs that were tied would give notice before they were within a
quarter of a mile of us; if any one drew near in the bush on the
level of the hut on either bank, the dogs at the fire would be sure
to hear or see or scent them a long way off and give the alarm.
Thus there was always a safe point to fly to where the dogs were
quiet. If any thing could have made our arrangement ineffectual, it
was the complete gale into which the wind blew itself by about
eleven o'clock. These high winds of the colony always produced in
me a state of nervous excitement almost like slight intoxication. I
believe it is the case also with many persons of highly nervous
temperament. During the time they prevail, the blacks consider they
can approach and spear the kangaroo or catch them with their dogs
much more easily than at other times. They seem to have a
bewildering effect on the animal. I thus felt no inclination to
sleep: D &mdash;&mdash; also was more restless to-night than I had
yet seen him. The man finding he could do no good turned in and was
soon fast asleep. Hour after hour we sat by the fire, and smoked,
and listened, and made tea; then walked about, and stood and
strained our eyes to pierce the darkness, and our ears to collect
every sound. The small rain fell spraylike, cool, refreshing, and
with the open breast and bare neck habitual to the working class in
the colony, this is quite a luxury when the skin is fevered with
over-exertion. The sky was starless, black, and still. The bush
kept up that long indefinite sound that it makes beneath the
passage of a mighty wind; something between a roar and a deep hiss,
mingled strangely, and one could fancy, awfully with sudden passing
intonations like a fitful music. The gale ruffled and howled, and
swept away from the fire far across the grass a long train of
sparks, which, viewed from the distance as we walked to and fro,
looked like the tail of some monstrous comet that had fallen and
lay blazing away amidst the darkness on the side of the great slope
of country down which the creek coursed.</p>

<p>At length day dawned, as it seemed, down in a world below us;
for the descent of the country was great. But it soon spread up
over the whole sky. The man was up with the first sensible light;
but instead of going for the milkers, D &mdash;&mdash; despatched
him for the two stockhorses. These are generally good hardy
geldings; and the performances of some of them are really
surprising. Never stabled or stall-fed they seem capable of much
more exertion than most horses that are. It is no uncommon thing,
for instance, for a stockman to ride his horse fifty or sixty miles
a day for several days together; the only food the animal gets all
the time being the native grass, and his only bed the same. D
&mdash;&mdash;'s two stockhorses, however, were old ones. As he let
me have them as cheap as I could have procured them anywhere else,
and as I was sure to need at least one, whatever I concluded to do
with the herd, I bought them, giving 17<i>l</i>. for the two,
bridles, saddles, &amp;c. &amp;c. in. While the man was looking for
them in the bush, we had some breakfast preparatory to beginning to
run the herd in. Meantime it struck me that seeing them in the bush
would be fully as satisfactory, provided we took his stock book (a
book which every stock-holder keeps, with a full and minute
description of every head of horned cattle he possesses entered in
it) and ticked them off as we saw them. Certainly some would be
almost sure not to be found the first or even second day. But I was
to have them at a price that would allow of the loss of one in
every five or six at least; and it seemed cruel to keep the poor
fellow here any longer than was actually inevitable. Moreover, as
the man suggested, the cattle being in the yard would lead to
suspicion that his master was there; and in that case he would be
likely to be taken, and so our whole engagement come to nought.
Beside, it seemed to me that having kept this stock book without
any view of using it for such a purpose, it was very good evidence
what cattle there were. I could trace head after head from muster
to muster along with the calves of each succeeding season. My only
uncertainty was whether any had been <i>sold</i> lately. At length,
it was settled that we should ride round the <i>outside</i> of the
run, and the man in the mean time drive down whatever he could find
<i>on</i> the run into the creek. By six o'clock in the evening we
had seen the four mares, the two foals, and every head but nineteen
of the horned cattle; and many of these were beasts which were the
most unlikely of all to have been made away with, heifer calves,
old bullocks, and cows whose calves we had. I had no further
hesitation in taking them as they were: and we concluded our
bargain in due form; D &mdash;&mdash; delivering up to me the
brands and stockbook, &amp;c. &amp;c., and I giving him a check
payable to R &mdash;&mdash; or bearer.</p>

<p>Without waiting for a night's rest, D &mdash;&mdash; set off by
the same dreary road we had come; what few things he thought it
worth while to take, he packed up before he started; paid the man a
few shillings of wages that were coming to him (he had already
given him a cow and calf), and told me to consider everything else
mine. The land he had no further claim to, having merely occupied
it temporarily.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone I took possession of the big hut, lit my
fire, and endeavoured to get some rest. R &mdash;&mdash; was to
present D &mdash;&mdash;'s check for him and see him off, and Mrs.
D &mdash;&mdash; was to remain for a couple of months to prevent
suspicion of her husband's departure till he was in safety. R
&mdash;&mdash; meantime, as soon as he had executed his part of the
undertaking, was to come up the country to me. All this while it
never struck me that <i>I</i> should be honoured by a visit from
the constables as soon as they found me in possession of D
&mdash;&mdash;'s hut; for hitherto they had been led by the man to
expect D &mdash;&mdash;'s return every day. About noon (the
constables' usual time of visiting in New South Wales at any
station where they think they may get a dinner), probably from some
information that had reached the &mdash;&mdash; police-office that
D &mdash;&mdash; had been seen in the neighbourhood, no less a
personage than the chief constable of the district himself rode up
to the door, and hanging his horse's bridle on the nail, walked in.
The dogs were all away with Jerry in the bush, or he would have
been obliged to use a little more ceremony. One of the very
greatest annoyances of New South Wales is, the freedom with which
the police and military walk into one's dwelling-house. The worthy
functionary had a pair of handcuffs slung on his belt, and a horse
pistol in his hand, but he seemed rather surprised as I threw
myself off the settle and confronted him. From the description I
had heard of him, I immediately guessed who he was. After
stammering out some sort of apology and saying he was the chief
constable, he pointed to the yard, into which about a dozen head
had been driven that morning, and our dialogue went on as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What cattle are those?"&mdash;"Mine."</p>

<p>"What brand is that?" pointing to the brand that had been D
&mdash;&mdash;'s, and which hung up in the hut.&mdash;"Mine."</p>

<p>"How long has it been yours?"&mdash;"Ever since I paid for
it."</p>

<p>"How long is that?"&mdash;"Am I paid to tell you, or you to find
it out?"</p>

<p>"Humph. You mean to say these cattle are yours?"&mdash;"I
do."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall see that."&mdash;"I've no doubt you will, and a
little plainer than you expect."</p>

<p>"Those cattle belong to the man I've got a warrant for; I shall
turn them into the bush."&mdash;"Bullee, bullee, bullee, go and lie
down at the yard gate, old man." Up jumped my old grey-coated
friend and follower nearly ever since I had been in the colony, and
without an instant's delay there he lay crouching under the bottom
bar of the stockyard-gate with his hind quarters in and his great
square head on the ground between his forepaws without. As soon as
things had got thus far, I began to feel rather "jerran," as the
blacks say, (<i>i.e</i>. timorous). Not being anything of a lawyer,
I began to have misgivings that I might in some point or other have
committed myself, for among the least of the threats with which my
baffled new acquaintance assailed me, was that of indictment for
impeding him in the execution of his duty. However, he took himself
off; and when I came to recollect that I neither had done anything
illegal, nor had he even evidence of anything I had done, I was
convinced his "bounce" could come to nothing. I thought it best,
however, till I could take legal advice in Sydney, to hide both the
brand and stockbook; and having warned Jerry to answer no
questions, I knew it would cost these busy and mischievous people
some trouble to prove whether I bought the cattle the day before or
the year before, and previously to the date of the warrant against
D &mdash;&mdash;. Still I felt that I had been very incautious in
not taking advice before the purchase, when, being near Sydney, I
might have done it so easily. Knowing the tyrannical modes of
procedure of the upcountry benches, and their very frequent
mistakes of the law, when even they intend to administer it aright,
I thought it safest, on reflection, to write to R &mdash;&mdash;
without an hour's delay to take advice. Jerry found me a man in
about three hours, and I sent him off on one of the stock horses
directly. After some days' delay in Sydney, from the horse being
knocked up, he returned, bringing me a letter, intimating that D
&mdash;&mdash; was off; and that the lawyer who had been consulted
said I was in no danger, either personally or of the loss of my
purchase. When I got this news I felt like a man that had a patent
of immunity from all care for the rest of his days.</p>

<p>ON preparing to write this chapter, it struck me that the best
form in which to cast it would be that of a journal. I cannot
indeed remember the dates, but the course of incident as occurring
on the first day, or second day, or third day, I recollect with the
utmost precision. Remembering our stages and the period we stopped
at the various stations, I can, of course, refer each circumstance
to the particular day of our journey on which it occurred. By
laying before the reader the train of facts themselves, which came
under my notice, as we traversed a very extensive portion of the
territory, he will form a much more accurate and faithful notion of
the natural aspects of the country and of the various features of
society than he would be furnished by a mere general account of my
own impressions and deductions.</p>

<p>The journey I am to describe took place on the arrival of R
&mdash;&mdash; from Sydney. Our object in taking it was to find a
good run to which we could send the whole of our cattle, his and
mine; employing a stockman of our own to look after them. Besides
what I had just bought, my former purchases and their increase were
now about eighty head, after deduction of thirds for the grazing. R
&mdash;&mdash; also had a snug little herd, which had been
accumulating for years. His father had about seventy head of his
own, and M &mdash;&mdash; had a few; so that altogether there were
upwards of 500 head, plenty to form a herd, beside four mares of
mine and one of R &mdash;&mdash;'s.</p>

<p>The reader will suppose us leaving the creek-hut on horseback,
with our blankets strapped on the saddle before us in long rolls
like dragoons' cloaks; our saddle bags well supplied with tea,
sugar, and tobacco, and quart pot, tomahawks, and tinder-box,
constituting the remainder of our equipment; not forgetting,
however, our horses' hobbles, and a couple of kangaroo dogs of R
&mdash;&mdash;'s, and my old Bullee, who insisted upon keeping us
company.</p>

<p>First day.&mdash;Roasting hot; almost intolerable in fact after
about eleven A.M. until four P.M. Rode right across into the
settlement of Bathurst; the latter part of the way along the high
road from Bathurst to Sydney. The roads excessively dusty, and all
the water-holes where the bullocks usually drink dried up. Many of
the poor animals that we passed in teams of 4, 6, and 8, yoked in
pairs, were panting and hanging their tongues out in a manner most
painful to behold, whilst their drivers flogged, and shouted, and
swore unremittingly. One wretch we passed had stuffed up with grass
the nostrils of a bullock which had lain down, and then kindled a
wisp of dry stringy bark, which blazes like flax, under his belly.
The beast's hide was cut through in all directions with the
greenhide lash of the heavy bullock whip as if by a knife. The
dexterity with which some of these men use the whip is quite
astonishing; the report when it strikes is like a rifle's crack,
and the macerated hair and flesh fly up from the spot in a little
white cloud like spray. In another place a whole team had started
off the road into the bush among the trees, smashed off the
dray-wheel against a tree, and scattered the load in all
directions. Here were the remains of a case of liqueurs; there a
tea-chest, crushed and disgorging a heap of tea among the grass;
here a sugar mat burst open, and what should have been a hat-box
and new beaver hat forced in among the sugar; here were a lot of
ladies' dresses coming out of the broken end of a large
slate-coloured trunk; and meeting them, from the mouth of the
bullock driver's harness cask, a lot of salt junk in a flood of
pickle. We dismounted and helped to release the shaft bullock, who
was partly jammed under the load, and then went on. The bullock
driver was bewailing his hard fortune most bitterly; he said he had
only about seven months more to serve before he was due for a
ticket of leave (to work for himself), but his master had promised
to do all he could to keep him from obtaining it, and this would be
just the very chance he wanted. He was a transport for life. I
could not discover that he was to blame for the accident; it seemed
to have originated solely in the viciousness of a young bullock
running his horn into the one he was yoked to. Very likely this man
would become desperate through the loss of his ticket, take the
bush, be driven by hunger to depredations on the roads, and be
finally hanged&mdash;this has been the course of thousands since
the formation of the colony as a penal settlement. The settlement
of Bathurst stands in the midst of wide levels or plains, totally
untimbered; this causes it to have a dreary, sterile aspect, though
in reality it is not so.</p>

<p>A stream, sometimes small, sometimes quite a deluge, holds its
course along beside the township, and on its banks are some noble
tracts of cultivable ground. The houses are very good in the
township; those in the fields are mostly turf huts, for here in
winter there are heavy frosts and snow, and the wind is so cutting
across this bare and elevated tract, that it is important to stop
up every chink and cranny where it can enter. We stopped for the
night at Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s stock-station, and were kindly
entertained; R &mdash;&mdash; being acquainted with the
stock-keeper, wanted to ask him if he knew of a run, but he knew of
none suitable.</p>

<p>Second day.&mdash;Rode on to a sheep-station a few miles south
of the township, and on the direct track to what is called the New
Country: <i>i.e.</i> the interior S. W. of Sydney. Our way lay
chiefly through open level country, very scantily watered. Here and
there, however, there was a splendid water-hole, like a little lake
amidst the arid waste. We had heard of a piece of unoccupied ground
some distance off the road to the eastward, and rode across to
examine it. Our directions to it (there being no roads across the
country, except the two or three great ones to the principal
points) were up a certain hollow, through a gap in the range, and
then across to a mountain on the distant horizon, by riding over
which at the easiest acclivity we could find, a creek would be
reached, and this creek followed down would lead to the run.
Travellers in England would probably think such directions as these
poor guidance for a distance of many miles; however, we were
successful in our search. Practice in bush travelling gives great
address in tracing such natural land-marks. A good hand at making
his way in the bush is called a good bushman; as is also a good
workman in timber. A man is not entitled to this appellation until
he has acquired a sort of tact of going right instinctively. The
infallible accuracy with which some men will hit a point several
miles off in a dark night, and all the way through thick forest, is
quite astonishing.</p>

<p>The station we reached for the night was merely an enclosure of
branches of trees, just to keep the sheep together. There was but
one flock, and the hut was only a few sheets of bark set up round
an area of about 6 feet square, with a roof of the same, through
which the stars shone down upon us as we lay wrapped in our
blankets on the floor. But we were not many minutes down before we
were obliged to rise and take the ground outside some way off, for
our pallet for the rest of the night. The sandy hut floor was
literally alive with fleas. After a martyr's sufferings, as soon as
the sun rose, I went to the water to wash, and when I took my shirt
off, these terrible persecutors covered it as if scattered by the
hand as the gardener sows seed. One of the men was hut-keeper, the
other shepherd; the shepherd tends the sheep by day, and the
hut-keeper has charge of them by night. Where there are good paling
yards or strong hurdles, the hut-keepers generally venture to
sleep, depending on their dogs, of which there are generally half a
dozen of one sort or another about a station, for keeping off the
warregal or bush dog, an animal very much resembling the fox, but
much more ravenous. The hut-keeper at this station was obliged to
watch all night, for his yard would in many places have suffered
the dog to crawl through; and if one does get in, he bites and
worries sometimes thirty or forty sheep before he is discovered
When the shepherd turned out his flock in the morning, the
hut-keeper having first cleared the floor of the hut, he drove them
in a mass up to it, and they soon crowded in and filled it. On my
asking them why they did this, they told me that by doing so the
fleas all got into the sheep and were carried away into the bush,
and that they often cleared the hut thus. Third day.&mdash;This day
we had the track for the New Country all day under our horses'
feet, and made a good journey; but our fortune at night was not so
good. We stopped at a half-starved station; it was a cattle
station, and the stockman being out, only the hut-keeper was there.
He seemed to make lying on his berth his sole occupation. He was a
great low-lived looking ruffian, not long "lagged" (transported);
he had been too lazy even to wash his wheat, which was smutty
before he ground it at the steel handmill with which most of these
huts are supplied, and it was as black as the back of the chimney.
After a supper of bread without beef, and tea without sugar, we
smoked our pipes and went to bed. After we were all laid down, the
lazy scoundrel told us all on a sudden, that there were a couple of
good milkers down the creek, and if we liked to drive them up with
our horses in the morning, we might milk them for breakfast; but he
did not care for milk himself, and so never milked them, except
when the stockman was at home. In short he was just that one man in
twenty that one finds among prisoners whom you may be sure will
eventually be sent to a penal settlement for life, if not hanged;
"too lazy," to use a common phrase, "to live;" incorrigibly idle
until everybody's hand is against him, and then, rather than amend
and work, turning his hand against everybody; not to be roused
except by severity, and then only into crime. Happily there are few
such.</p>

<p>Our night's quarters were rendered still more memorable and
comfortless by the blacks having had a battle here that afternoon.
Three dead bodies were lying on the flat, with the ghastly grin of
those who have died <i>the hater's death</i>. Two of them had been
killed by body wounds with jagged spears, that had torn their way
out frightfully; the other's was a head-wound with a tomahawk. The
weapon had gone right through his mat of woolly black hair into the
brain; very little blood had flowed, but the "gins" (black women)
told us he died almost instantly. As I came in from looking after
my horse, I passed them as they lay cold and prone in the thin
misty moonlight, each on the spot where he had fallen. The wife of
one of them, a fine, but small Hercules-like figure, sat or rather
reclined by him, sobbing as if her heart would break. Another was
quite a lad, and the other an old grey-bearded man, who had been a
great warrior in his day. Nobody was near either of them. The
reflection struck me very strongly, how strange an instinct is war!
And yet may it not be necessary for the good and even the safety of
the peaceful, that the fierce and bloodthirsty should be thus
attracted toward each other; the mutual destruction of the
destructive leaving the peaceful to their peace?</p>

<p>Fourth day.&mdash;Got to a stock-station this evening, where the
plenty was as remarkable as the dearth where we stopped last night.
It was Sunday, but nobody here keeps the day as anything more than
a holiday. Men wash their shirts, and grind their week's wheat, and
visit, where the huts are not too far apart. Here, however, this
last occupation was pretty well precluded, as the stations are
miles asunder, and there is seldom above one hut on each station.
At the same time it is a saying as common as possible, that no work
done on the sabbath-day prospers. I never travel on this day if I
can help it; but in this case it was almost unavoidable, for we had
got the night before into the very den of hunger and sloth. The
country we passed through to-day was a very fine stock-country,
beautiful flats of open meadow on river banks, and fine gentle
grassy hills. Perhaps it was a little too thickly timbered. We met
with a very welcome reception, and the people wanted us to stop a
day or two with them for a rest, but we did not.</p>

<p>Fifth day.&mdash;Reached a station belonging to a son of one of
the earliest settlers; a singularly wild looking spot. During the
day's ride we crossed some fine high grassy runs, coming at length
to the bank of the Abercrombie river, or rather to the descent to
the bank. Standing at the brink, we looked down a declivity of I
should think nearly half a mile; and along the bottom there ran the
small line of trees that shade the banks of this wild torrent
stream. When we had made the descent, a short distance upwards to
our left was an elbow of the river, occasioned by its shooting
against the base of a vast and almost perpendicular mountain. As I
stood gazing up at it from the river's edge, I felt my own
insignificance in a way I cannot describe; the physical comparison
was perfectly extinguishing. Crossing easily&mdash;for at this time
the drought had nearly emptied the bed of the river&mdash;we set
forward up the opposite acclivity; and here again my astonishment
was not a little excited. It was a long ascent, of, as nearly as I
can remember, three quarters of a mile, and so steep that a person
coming down could not have stayed himself from running without
great difficulty; yet there were dray tracks down it. I could not
have believed, had I not seen it, that a team of bullocks could
have got down in any other way than tumbling or sliding. The
station at which, as I have said, we stopped for the night is, as
you come on it along the road, as if it were down in a mere hole of
the earth. Part of our journey to-day was along the top of an
immense ridge of mountain, with another similar ridge running
parallel to it for some length of way; and between them the gully
was so deep, that though the crowns of the two ridges must have
been miles apart, it really looked as if you could have thrown a
stone across from one to the other. The sight of one immense hill
side on which the sun is shining from another height opposite, is a
magnificent spectacle; especially when the face of it is finely
timbered, as this was. We still heard of no run that could be
recommended for water. At the same time it must be remarked, that
stockmen are very shy of telling of runs even when they know of
them; they of course for their own cattle's sake like to keep
unallotted as much land as they can.</p>

<p>Sixth day.&mdash;Cottlewolly Creek. Some of the stations about
this part of the country are perfect natural Edens. Far apart, each
in its peaceful nook, surrounded by parklike tracts of bush, with
here and there a group of lazy beeves at the creekside; or a flock
of sheep "camping," us the shepherds call it, under the shade of a
tree from the noontide heat; the thin wreath of wood smoke curling
up at meal times from the hut-roof; men who sometimes see no faces
but each other's for weeks together, slowly sauntering to and fro,
and getting all their work done by ten in the morning and so for
years together living on this still and unmolested kind of life,
till the convict nature is mixed with so much of the simple,
harmless herdsman's, that it is no longer recognised:&mdash;such is
the picture of a remote stock-station&mdash;of three in every five.
And yet, alas! they have their own crimes. No one unacquainted with
them would believe how much cattle and sheep-stealing they are the
scenes of; whilst often the lowest class of human vices passes but
for a jest. Inanimate nature is universally lovely amidst these
wildernesses, and a cheerful unprejudiced eye may often observe
strong assimilation going forward, in the human character, to the
faultless still-life around, which God has retained under His own
more immediate control.</p>

<p>Seventh day.&mdash;Stopped for the night at a station at
Breadalbane Plains. We went there something out of our direct road,
to see a mutual friend of ours, who was there for a few days,
looking after some stray cattle, that he had heard had wandered to
this part of the country. The people of the station received us as
usual with the greatest hospitality. We could not eat beef and
damper enough and drink milk and tea enough for them. The first
sound on waking in the morning was the numerous herd of milkers
lowing in the yard, and the first sight we saw was the new milk
going by to the dairy, to be set for cream by buckets full. Eighth
day.&mdash;Goulburn Plains. We stopped to-night at one of the grog
houses. I do not recollect whether or not the proprietor had a
licence at this time: several of the police, however, were
assisting in the spree that was going on. A party of free men had
come here in their way down the country after taking pretty large
sums at the sheepshearing with the full intention (as free men
under such circumstances always have) of having "only one halfpint"
of rum and then going on. Meantime (as ever) that one led to a
second; the second to a third; the third to a fourth, and so on
till the count was lost in the unfathomable obscurities of a
publican's conscience. They were drinking, singing, smoking,
dancing, swearing, yelling, fighting; in short, to use the
expressive simile of the class, after "earning their money like
horses they were spending it like asses." One fellow had hardly
trowsers enough to retain a legal right to walk about; and he spent
there a seventeen pounds check in two days and a half without
purchasing anything. As fast as one batch of the police got
thoroughly soaked at the expense of these foolish fellows and went
out, another batch walked in. The man who had spent so much had
been many years in the colony, and had been free chief part of the
time, most of his sentence being expired before he was sent from
the hulks. On an average he must have earned clear of rations
30<i>s</i> a week all the time. Probably he had earned in wages
alone not less than 700<i>l</i>., which laid out in cattle as he
got it would have enabled him by this time to keep his carriage.
But here he was so debased that, as I looked at his antics and his
aspect, I felt mortified to have to acknowledge that he was a
man.</p>

<p>Ninth day.&mdash;Rode over to Bulla Melita and back, and about
the bush on the coast side of the road from Inverary to Lake
Bathurst; but wherever I went I saw nothing but dried up waterholes
and bare runs. In some places the grass was eaten off so short that
whole tracts looked like the high road. There was not so much as
the root of the grass visible. R &mdash;&mdash; went off in another
direction, but came back with no better success than I had had.
Even the deep water-holes on the runs already taken up were very
much reduced. The blacks say, "Plenty water before white man come,
plenty pish (fish), plenty kangaroo, plenty' possum, plenty
everything: now all gone. Poor fellow now, black fellow! By and bye
that got nothing at all to patter. Then <i>that</i> tumble down"
(then <i>he</i> will die).</p>

<p>Tenth day.&mdash;Gave the horses a day's spell, still continuing
at Goulburn Plains. In the afternoon I walked round some of the
farms at the edge of the plains. These plains, I should inform the
reader, are the Australian prairies. These of Goulburn are many
miles across every way; but some farther up the country are several
days' journey across. Travelling on them is very monotonous; and
the appearance of things very deceptive as to distance. I have set
out to walk to a house which I supposed about four miles distance,
and at the end of eight still found myself not there. The masters
hereabout seem generally in very bad odour with their men,
excepting only the young natives who have land here. At one of the
farms I went to, the government men told me they were almost
starved; and indeed they looked so. What else can be expected under
this system of white slavery? The master's interest is to get as
much as possible for as little as possible. Thus when the thing to
be done is a fixed amount, not liable to increase or decrease, as
shepherding or hut-keeping, the master naturally says, "Well, the
very lowest amount of strength a man can walk about with will
suffice for this work: consequently if I only give this man a diet
that keeps him alive, I get all I want." This leads to bitter,
ineradicable animosity in the men, which year by year gets deeper
and stronger; until at last the magistrate, himself a settler too,
and equally a party in the iniquitous system, is appealed to by the
master. Of course he orders the man a flogging, and I am sorry to
say generally with much such nonchalance as the housewife sends for
a pound of candles. Then come
bushranging&mdash;robbery&mdash;murder&mdash;and capture and
execution.</p>

<p>Eleventh day.&mdash;Sabbath. A day's spell for ourselves and our
horses. I went off into the bush after breakfast, and lying under a
thick shady tree read all day till three o'clock in the afternoon;
then had my dinner; and in the cool of the evening had a "bogie"
(bathe) in the river.</p>

<p>Twelfth day.&mdash;Rode to Parramarrago, an incipient township
east of Goulburn Plains, and consequently coastward. In the evening
we saddled our horses again and took a turn about the bush in the
direction of the Shoalhaven gullies. These are the steep and
tremendous ravines that run down to the Shoalhaven River.
Never-ending forest, with here and there a little meadow-like spot
covered with the coarse grass called "blade of grass;" a
geographical surface so varied, wild, and wonderful, that you seem
to be in another land; great unfathomable gulfs of woody valley,
irregular and bewildering ridges, a flock of kangaroo, or a
scarcely less wild flock of bush-cattle galloping down upon you at
a charge pace to within a few feet, and there standing, encircling
and staring at you, and then at the first motion of an arm or sound
of a voice wheeling and tossing their heads and snorting and
bursting away like a living hurricane through the crashing bush;
such was the scenery. The incidents were more of narrative than of
present fact. We were told of an old gentleman belonging to a
settler's family who used often to wander reading about the bush
near the farm which borders on these intricate wilds. One day when
he had done so he returned not. Search was made in all directions,
but nothing was ever heard of him again. It is supposed that he
lost his way; and still with the flurried speed of fear rushed
farther and farther from his home and familiar places till
exhaustion and death overtook him in some lonely hollow, where the
foot of even the scanty black population of the wilderness is not
accustomed to penetrate for years together. Some years afterwards I
was told of a poor bark-stripper getting mimosa bark, being lost
among these same labyrinths. This man's feelings must have been
most painful, as he could not have been above half a mile from
well-known ground and the spot whence his line of bundles of bark
would have led him almost to his hut door, when he found himself at
fault. To those not acquainted with country of this description I
know such facts will hardly be credible. I can however assure the
reader that on this very occasion it was nearly my own lot; for
only by riding round a single small hill whilst my fellow-horsemen
went over it, I got so bewildered, and so much more bewildered as I
made more efforts to extricate myself, that but for "coo-eehing"
loudly from a hill-top, which was answered by R &mdash;&mdash; and
the stockman with him, I should probably never have found my way;
unless perhaps by the sagacity of my horse on my giving up all
other hope and letting him have his head. In this respect the
horseman is much better off than the footman. A vast many fatal
adventures of this class occur in the colony. Some time afterwards
I heard of a new hand lost on Manaroo Plains merely through their
monotonousness. He went with one of the old hands to the plain to
look for bullocks, and getting out of his sight and out of sight of
the hut was found no more. Again, quite an old hand was lost near
the same place in a snow storm. The snow had covered the road; he
got off it, and could not find it again; but when discovered he was
only a few yards from it. The last case I heard of was somewhere
behind Bathurst. It was that of a bullock driver going with his
team from one bush station to another. It appeared it was a very
sultry day; and he left his mate and team to go down a hollow,
thinking it would lead to a creek and afford him a drink. It was
nine days afterwards before he was found; whether dead or alive I
forget. But I have some faint recollection, either in this case or
some other, about the same part, of a man being found after many
days' search lying dead across a large log, with his legs eaten
away by the native dogs. A very melancholy case I was told of near
Jambecombène; it was that of a poor government man, a tailor, who
went from one farm to another to get cloth and take measure for a
garment, and in coming back lost himself in the deep brushy
Budawong gullies; and when at last the blacks found him, he was
down in a deep creek-bed in the mountain, where only few and faint
fragments of sunshine ever reach the ground; he too was lying
across a log; and it was discovered that he had cut up his cloth
into innumerable little snips and dropped them as he went as a sort
of clue. But what exactly he thought to gain by this expedient when
already lost it would not perhaps be easy to divine. In short, the
multitudes of similar sad accidents that reach one's ear in a few
years' residence in the interior is hardly credible; at the same
time the slightest caution would prevent it. A new hand should
carefully observe objects wherever he goes, and he should take care
never to go too far away from places he is familiar with. The whole
character of the country here was objectionable for our purpose.
The good flats with creeks in them were already occupied; and the
rest of the bush was very deficient of water.</p>

<p>Thirteenth day.&mdash;Yarralla Creek. Occupied. The circumjacent
country broken, and we could see no good water-holes.</p>

<p>Fourteenth day.&mdash;Lake Bathurst. This is a fine plot of
water of several miles in circumference; and there is some good
open and flat forest around it; but it seemed to be pretty well fed
off by one kind of stock and another in all directions.</p>

<p>Fifteenth day.&mdash;Boro Creek. Stockmen evidently unwilling to
give us any information of unoccupied ground.</p>

<p>Sixteenth day.&mdash;Jambecombène. The choicest of the country
again occupied before us; we were, however, afforded very liberal
and welcome entertainment. The face of the district is generally
flattish, and there stands at one part a huge round mountain,
called Jellamatong Mountain, which is a most conspicuous landmark
far round. Dry flats and swamps, creeks and ranges, here alternate
in perpetually varying combination. I rode off alone in the evening
to a range of mountains about four miles distant. At parts, along
the foot of the ridge, lay scattered an army of boulders, great and
small; grey with age, mossy, rounded by the wear of ages, they
seemed almost objects of reverence. As the melancholy wind of
evening fanned the red flame of the fires at the camp of the black,
unclad, stalwart men of the wilderness, who had settled themselves
for the night at the edge of this field of natural ruins, I felt
strongly the primitive simplicity of the scene; I could not help
feeling a sort of astonishment from its contrast with "the busy
hum" of "crowded cities," venting the instinctive query, "Can these
two opposite things, productive as they are of such opposite
effects on the human spirits and feelings, be both true parts of
the creation of the same God? Must they not rather be the abuses of
the true at opposite points? And then how mysterious and how
humiliating this tendency of man to deteriorate! The terrible
fatality follows him, which way soever he progresses; downwards it
is into barbarism, upwards into luxury; either he must have nothing
to enjoy, or he must enjoy nothing that he has. Truly God's
greatest gift, as it was his last, was his model-man, sole
dispenser of that celestial instinct which is the only thing we
cannot possess too much of; whose image voluntarily welcomed to
dwell within the soul, imposes upon it a perfective law as complete
as infallible&mdash;as infallible as complete.</p>

<p>Getting back to the station a little before dark, I unsaddled my
horse, hobbled him, and sent him off to pick up his evening meal
where he could find one. And, by the bye, animals with a bush
education are not bad judges which way to direct their steps. As we
were having our supper it came on to rain fast, and then faster; so
we sat all the evening smoking our pipes and drinking the delicious
tea, and yarning, and now and then treating ourselves to a lounge
on one of the berths, whilst the rest talked on for our amusement
and their own.</p>

<p>Seventeenth day.&mdash;The stockman would not hear of our going
away, as the rain still kept on. Smoking and padding saddles, and
tailoring rents in clothes, and calculating how much longer boots
would last, ehopping knives for handkerchiefs and handkerchiefs for
knives, awarding the palm for straw-hat making to this or that
shepherd or hut-keeper, playing at all-fours for "gombenes" of
tobacco, telling wonderful tales of the goodness of working
bullocks, and the bottom of stock-horses, and the sagacity of dogs,
and the ferociousness of the bush cattle, along with frying and
eating pancakes plentiful of eggs, and the whole class of similar
occupations of body and mind passed away the hours till night. Who
has not felt how agreeable it is sometimes to be thoughtless?</p>

<p>Eighteenth day.&mdash;This was Sunday. Being so well quartered,
we invited ourselves, much to our entertainer's satisfaction, to
stop another day. After finding our horses and heading them back
near to the hut, I got away as usual under a shady tree in the
creek, for it turned out a very warm day, and read till I was so
hungry that I could not stay away from the hut any longer.</p>

<p>Nineteenth day.&mdash;Before we started this morning some of the
blacks that I saw encumped a few evenings ago at the foot of the
mountains came up to the station. They seemed spiritless and fast
verging to the usual fate of the tribes&mdash;extinction. The
stock-keeper told us that when he first came here to live, and
there were as yet no white men about within miles, they were so
savage that on the occasion of one of the tribe being killed in an
affray, they kept his body unburied for months, till they could
take revenge for his death.</p>

<p>The weather delightful. We retraced our course by the way of the
Long Swamp, a splendid cattle run in the neighbourhood: here we
came upon a dealer with three teams of goods, encamped on the edge
of the swamp. He was a merry, free-hearted fellow, and made us have
a drop of capital brandy with him; and our tobacco being nearly
out, we supplied ourselves with a pound of negro-head a-piece; but
his profits were exorbitant, viz., from 100 to 200 and even 300 per
cent. on what the goods cost him. However, in these shopless wastes
there is no help for it; one must either give what they ask or go
without the article, for the supply is so much less than the
demand, that it is rarely they take anything of consequence back to
Sydney. We stopped at the dealer's fire all night; he was a merry
fellow, and kept everybody about him in excellent humour. He was a
Jew.</p>

<p>Twentieth day.&mdash;Rode over to Bungando as it is called on
the spot, or the Bungandon of the maps. Here I saw the finest
specimen of mannashedding trees I had ever met with; the tree is a
species of gum, and the ground beneath the clumps was literally
strewed with pieces as large as pigeons' eggs and downwards, and as
white as the whitest loafsugar. A little of it is very nice, but
much nauseates; and I have a notion, though I cannot vouch for its
accuracy, that its properties are rather the reverse of the manna
that is used medicinally. When they are short of sugar, the men
sometimes gather and use it in their tea. It is most palatable in
tea made of the pennyroyal, which shepherds are so fond of.
Twenty-first day.&mdash;Limestone Plains. The ground all occupied.
On each side of the plains meanders in the most serpentine course a
fine river. Being close to the high road to the great interior
districts of Manaroo Plains or Brisbane Downs, and Omio, and the
White Mountains, it will doubtless become in time a first-rate
settlement.</p>

<p>Twenty-second day.&mdash;Kurraducbidgee. The reader will easily
distinguish the native names of places from English names. I give
them as much as possible, to convey an idea of the language. It
will be perceived that it is, for the most part, exceedingly soft
and euphonious. Twenty-third day.&mdash;Inverary. This is virtually
the same settlement as the one some time back called Parramarrago.
Nothing of any importance occurs to me respecting it. It may not
still be unworthy of remark, as showing how unnecessary it is that
an administrator of the laws should be disliked here any more than
elsewhere, that one of the magistrates, an old medical gentleman,
was very much beloved by all classes. A like prodigious phenomenon
I believe also existed at Goulburn Plains: there, however, it was
the case of an old military gentleman. There are some grievous
contrasts in the neighbourhood: meantime the ladies of these two
gentlemen have the credit, in common opinion, of no little agency
in prompting the action of the benevolent feelings of their
husbands, and counterpoising the unmerciful counsels of their
coadjutors in office. Such facts can never be told too widely;
goodness can never be too well rewarded; active beneficence can
never be too highly honoured; good deeds, done for the saving of
the soul, may be well enough; but the good deeds that flow from the
<i>saved</i> soul are far beyond them. To endow a church they say
is pious; and granting the data of certain modes of religion, so it
must be; but to save some shivering wretch from the triangles is
the piety of a religion of far more illustrious conception: the
votaries of such a faith ought to be spoken of and honoured like
the woman in the Gospel, "this that they have done" "going forth"
far and wide "as a memorial" of them.</p>

<p>Twenty-fourth day.&mdash;Barber's Creek. This creck is named
after the gentleman whose station is situated at the
crossing-place. It is quite a sight to see the hosts of travellers
that sometimes invade this homestead, where nobody is charged
anything.</p>

<p>Twenty-fifth day.&mdash;Sunday. Stopped all day at the farm
which we reached yesterday. We were both of us glad of a day's
spell; R &mdash;&mdash; did not feel this incessant riding as much
as I did, as he has been used to it, off and on, from his infancy.
When one comes to be in the saddle for many days together all day
long, riding is really hard work; but especially is this the case
where much of the way is bush. Some horses are better than others,
but all want watching, when going pretty sharp: here a great fallen
tree lies in your way, which you must go over; there a bough
stretches down, and you must take care it does not sweep you off
your horse: here your horse wheels suddenly, there he has to
descend a hill plentifully scattered over with loose stones;
everywhere and always both legs and arms and thoughts must be in
active exertion.</p>

<p>Twenty-sixth day, Bong-Bong.&mdash;As we neared this settlement
we passed a female prisoner on foot going down, in charge of a
constable, to the Female Factory (Penitentiary) of Paramatta. She
had been giving her mistress what they here technically term
"cheek," and was sentenced to some months' confinement and to be
returned to Government. She was a rough brutal creature, but the
cutting off of her hair, which would be one of the consequences of
her return to Government in this way, she seemed to feel very
acutely.</p>

<p>Twenty-seventh day.&mdash;A stockman who came in this morning as
we were about to mount for the road, told us of a fine run which he
had looked out for his master in the county of Georgiana. As he
appeared to be a man who could be depended on, had not told us for
the sake of gain, and bore a good character at the place where we
met him, and as he assured us that his master had decided on taking
his herd farther into the interior, we determined to ride back and
look at it. After two days' hard riding, after dark on the second
evening we reached the nearest station to it, and put up there for
the night.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter XIII. Twelve Months at a
Stock Station.</h2>

<p class="newspaper">Good cattle-run discovered&mdash;A knot of

country&mdash;Prodigality of working-men&mdash;A
cattle-branding&mdash;Narrow escape&mdash;Snakes
generally&mdash;Beginning a dairyfarm&mdash;Melancholy results of

<p>THE station we had reached was situated in one of the most
solitary parts of the extreme verge of colonization. It was
occupied by one miserable man herding as miserable a flock of
sheep. The man himself seemed one of those beings sometimes met
with in these situations who delight in being quite alone in the
wilderness, without heart and without hope, obliged to do something
for a livelihood, but grudging to do even that little; with
scarcely enough life left in them to die, and yet, strange paradox,
hoarding what they do get hold of with a miser's tenacity. If he
had any food in the hut he took care not to let us see it, but
suffered us to go to bed supperless, or rather to lie down so; for
though we gave him some broad hints, he did not offer us so much as
an old sheepskin to lay under us on the ground before the hut fire,
where we stretched ourselves. As we had only a blanket apiece, and
the hut floor was none of the driest, and our pipes had to serve us
for both supper and breakfast, we were off by daylight for the
horses, and in the saddle again by sun-rise. As a parting courtesy
he gave us such a blundering direction to the next nearest station
as led us full a dozen miles out of our way in finding it; and then
we should not have succeeded but for giving up his directions and
falling back on our own judgment by the lay of the country and the
cattle tracks.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours' ride, however, we first made out the
run we were in search of. It was all that the stockman who told us
about it at Bong-Bong had described,&mdash;a fine tract of flats of
good grass, open timbered, and stretching a good mile and a half
along a creek side, with fine clear downs on the left backing the
flats, and a steep stony ridge rising immediately from the farther
bank of the creek to thick forest land, so peculiarly desirable for
cattle in either very hot or very cold weather. About the middle
there was an excellent broad easy hill for the hut and stock-yard;
and just opposite, on the hilly side of the creek, a gap in the
range leading up another tract of flat, with plenty of water and
open ground for a considerable distance.</p>

<p>After riding about for three-quarters of an hour, and satisfying
ourselves that it was not in possession of any other herd, we made
up our minds to occupy it. This decided on, we began to feel our
hunger, for we had had nothing since noon on the previous day. It
was, however; not till noon again that we succeeded in finding the
nearest stock-station. Here we found a young Australian with his
herd, and a few men, and were welcomed to the best his store
afforded. Once more we turned our stock horses into the bush and
set ourselves down for a couple of days' rest. Our entertainer
appeared to have plenty of visitors of the stock-keeping class; and
we could soon perceive that his doctrines on the point of cattle
were of the most liberal complexion. As names are withheld, the
description I shall give can injure no one's lawful interests, but
may be a caution to new settlers; on that ground I shall not
hesitate in giving it. &mdash;&mdash; was very respectably
connected, but having lived chiefly among stockmen he had imbibed
the principles and habits so common among them; and, if he could
find an unbranded beast in the bush, had no qualms about making it
his own by clapping his brand on it. In this way, by a process
technically called "gully-raking," he had quadrupled the little
herd his father gave him. He had an overseer after his own heart, a
jolly daring fellow, for whom nothing in the shape of a horned
beast was too heavy or too hot. And, besides this, he was
surrounded on all sides with elements of a similar character.
Besides himself and his overseer, there were a couple of Scotchmen,
an Irishman, and several Englishmen located with stock around the
spot, but occupying altogether a very extensive tract; and, as all
these were only either overseers or merely stockmen, he reigned a
sort of little king of lacklaw among them. His hut was the general
rendezvous, and his keg always contained a glass of good rum. If
any of the fraternity made a passing call they were treated to a
half-pint: if they came and set in for a spree it was booked
against them, and they paid for it when it amounted to the price of
a good beast,&mdash;sometimes by one of their own, but generally by
one of somebody else's. This was the single speck in his character:
in every other point he was as trustworthy as most men. Evidently
he did not want us to take up our run, preferring not to be
intruded on; but as he came to be better acquainted with us his
stiffness wore away. He saw we understood these things as well as
he did himself; and concluded that, as we could not be "choked
off," it would be better to have us for friends than enemies. We
however gave him to understand that we did not deal in his way; but
that at the same time we did not feel it concerned us how he chose
to act: that "live and let live" was our principle; and that as
long as our own cattle were safe we should not trouble ourselves
about other people's. And, indeed, this is the sort of tacit
understanding that every stockholder in New South Wales has to
adopt. If he do otherwise, his horses will be lost, his cattle will
disperse, his farm affairs generally will miscarry, and whatever he
may suspect to be the agency, he will find no one hardy enough to
come forward to assist him with any explicit information on the
subject. But it is worth while to observe that an individual placed
in the midst of such a gang, and keeping himself free alike from
meddling on the one part against them, and from participation on
the other, is in one of the securest of positions; for, in
consideration of his forbearance, they will generally do him any
service in their power, heading homeward his stray beasts, giving
tidings of any lost ones, and a hundred other little offices of
like kind.</p>

<p>Our run fixed on we rode straight across to the Bathurst country
for our herd. It took us about a fortnight to gather them; but as
we made no great show, merely heading them all up to a central
place in the run daily, and not bringing them home to the
stock-yard, we had only the customary calls of the various
constables at our hut kept up. The Bathurst police did not as yet
know of D &mdash;&mdash;'s escape from the colony, and could not
make sure of anything about the sale; and were not in a position
legally to touch the herd, whether sold or unsold, from any sworn
evidence yet in their possession. The man we had at the station was
a trusty fellow, but we did not tell him any more than that we were
endeavouring to see what cattle could be gathered; nothing in fact
about our intention to move them. At length when we had got all the
herd pretty well together, one evening after the usual call of the
constable "to get a light of the pipe," we told our man we were
going to move them next day, gave him all the things in the hut
which we could not take away on two pack-bullocks that were among
the cattle, and took him out with us to get the whole herd into the
yard; which we did not do, however, till three hours after
night-fall. But as it was moonlight, and we left the quiet cattle
till the last, we succeeded to within five head. Another hour was
employed in helping our man to "plant" (hide), for the sake of
entire security, the things we had given him. We then made up a
good fire, and passed the night at our ease. At the first glimpse
of day the horses and pack-bullocks were saddled and the cattle
turned out; and off we went, padlocking the door after us: so that
if a constable came he would be no wiser, but only suppose us all
out in the bush for the day. The only possibility of his making out
that we were gone for good was from his looking at the stock-yard
and observing the tracks; and if such had been the case we really
cared very little about it. The worst the police could have done
was by some arbitrary and illegal stretch of power to have given us
a little trouble. Though really these arbitrary and illegal
exercises of power by the police in New South Wales are so very
common, and measures of redress are so very expensive and
inconvenient, that one likes rather to avoid than give occasion for
them. We had fine weather, and drove our "mob" wide of the
settlement (Bathurst township): the man went three days' stage with
us and returned: we would gladly have taken him forward with us as
our stockman, but he preferred sticking to the beds, blankets,
cooking utensils, &amp;c., which we had given him. Besides, though
a good man in other respects, he was a great "Lushington;" and when
these fellows once get disturbed from their regular work, and the
notion of a "spree" gets into their head, they are never easy till
they have their "break out" over, and take the road again to look
for some other service, without a penny in their pockets, or, to
use their own phrase, "without a feather to fly with;" or, again,
"without a mag to bless themselves with." What this blessing
themselves is unless it be getting another glass of rum, I never
could divine. I have known scores of them spend 20<i>l</i>.,
30<i>l</i>., 50<i>l</i>., 70<i>l</i>. in Sydney in the course of a
few days, and then, as in a sort of desperation, take to one of the
great roads up the country, on which there is none of that
hospitable entertainment that there is in the bush, and walk for
two or three days right ahead without a bit to eat or a drop to
drink except the water on the road side; sleeping at night a little
way off in the bush, by a fire that some more fortunate traveller
had left or themselves had kindled, for every working man carries
his tinder-box for lighting his pipe. Such, it is very likely, was
our stockman's next adventure. I never saw him again.</p>

<p>We took the cattle on by easy stages; and when we reached our
new friend's station, he made us welcome, as is usual, to his yard;
and lent us a man to herd them whilst we knocked up a rough
bush-yard of our own, and got a stock-keeper. When cattle are
driven from one part to another they generally try to make back to
their old run; if not all, there are always some that do. Thus it
becomes necessary to keep a man after them all day in the bush,
till they settle, which is called "tailing them;" and also to yard
them every night for some time. On coming into the yard they are
counted as they go through the gate, which to do without mistakes,
rushing in as they often do in a perfect mêlée, is considered one
of the highest accomplishments of an expert stockman; as turning
cattle in and out of a yard several times is a good deal of
trouble. There are generally two to count, and if they differ, out
must come the cattle again; it is therefore a very ticklish post to
occupy; for the correct counter and the other hands never fail to
pay the blunderer some very Flemish compliments: and if he do it
often, though he be the master himself, he soon gets cashiered.
After a few days I rode across (about forty miles) to a blacksmith,
and got a brand with my initials made; and we had a regular
gathering to rebrand the whole herd. All neighbouring stockmen,
unless otherwise much occupied, assist at these times; both because
the quantity of help can only be got thus, and because all want the
same assistance in turn; and because it secures none of their own
herd being branded by mistake; and lastly, because thus becoming
acquainted with their neighbours' cattle, they can assist to keep
them to their own proper run, and head them home if they meet them
going away. At these cattle musters, the cattle are first got into
the stockyard, which is a large square enclosure of very strong
posts properly half a rod apart, and 5, 6, 7, or even 8 feet high
out of ground, and 2 or 3 feet in ground; connected by strong rails
a couple or three inches thick, and from 4 to 12 inches broad. Some
have three of these rails, some six, and a round cap rail over all,
according to the various height of the posts. Outside the yard a
strong wood fire is kindled, into which are put the iron brands,
each having a handle long enough to diminish the heat, so that it
can be held in the hand when red-hot at the letter end. These
letter ends have generally the owner's initials; but some use
circles, or squares, or triangles, or crosses, &amp;c., &amp;c., to
brand with. One man, the best that can be found, then goes into the
yard with a noose rope on the end of a long forked pole, the plain
part of the rope running through his hand and trailing along the
ground; the end, however, if long enough, being held outside the
yard. This noose is then dexterously thrown over the beast's horns
or round his neck, and a turn being taken round one of the round
corner posts of the yard, the herd is driven toward that corner,
and the slack of the rope taken in till the beast that is noosed is
drawn taught up to the post. Then sometimes the animal is branded
standing, his legs merely being confined by a leg rope held by men
or fastened to another post; or else, if very wild and powerful, he
is legged, and thrown, and tied fast, and then branded. When some
of them get up, everybody must be off out of the yard. Some degree
of nerve is required to untie a beast; the best way is to keep
behind it, and out of the way. Some men will stand their ground,
and some always nip up over the fence as speedily as they can.
Generally the danger is more in appearance than in reality. Only
now and then, when a real "Russian" happens to be among the mob,
circumspection must positively be practised as well as bravery. I
have known beasts break three strong ropes one after the other,
charge everybody out of the yard, and then go over a six-rail fence
at a flying leap, and get away unconquered to their wilds again.
Outside the yard at these times is also set a table with the stock
book, pens, and ink, and in that the cattle are registered, with
their descriptions, as the brands are affixed.</p>

<p>When our branding was over, my mate and I set to and cut down a
sufficient lot of saplings about twelve feet long, and of posts
with a fork on the top and another in the middle for lodging the
sapling rails on, to make a good large yard, on our own run. We
made it on the hill side that I have already described as fit for
that purpose. To this we added a snug little slab hut with a sod
chimney. And thus in three months' time we were regular settlers; R
&mdash;&mdash; adding his own, his father's, and his sister's
cattle to mine. On driving them up the country, he brought with him
a stockman, into whose charge the whole herd was now formally
counted, at wages of 25<i>l</i>. per annum, and what rations he
chose to use. In general he was a very good stock-keeper, but, like
our neighbours, very much given to gully-raking when he could get
the opportunity; and it was not till he found we were in downright
earnest with him, that he could be persuaded to keep from it whilst
with us. This practice derives its name from the circumstance of
cattle straying away from their own herds into the bush, and
forming wild herds which chiefly congregate down in the wild grassy
gullies of the mountains, where there are no farms; partly for the
sake of the grass itself, and partly for the sake of the fine water
there; and from their breeding there sometimes to a great extent,
the gullyrakers eventually driving them out and branding all the
young ones, and any others they can manage, with their own
brands.</p>

<p>In the summer R &mdash;&mdash; had a very narrow escape of being
bitten by a snake. As a caution, it may be worth relating, though
as an incident it is of such common character that we did not think
much of it. We had a hen sitting, and on the morning R
&mdash;&mdash; considered the chickens ought to be coming out, he
went to the old hollow log in which the hen had made her nest. Here
at the mouth he found her running about, and cackling, and ruffling
her feathers; and supposed she was calling out one or more of the
chickens who had broken the shell, with her as she went to her
morning meal. After waiting some time, as they did not come out, he
stooped down and put his hand in, to bring them out of the nest;
but the instant he began to feel over the top of the eggs, his hand
touched what by the cold smooth velvet-like feeling he knew to be a
large snake. Probably it was asleep, for it did not move. We got
the mortising axe, and mortised a hole through the barrel of the
log above the nest; and after some trouble got the reptile out. One
of the dogs seized him, as he shot out, by the back of the neck,
and flung him yards up into the air. He was a black snake, better
than five feet long. The bite of this species is fatal, except
under very prompt measures of abscission and good medical
treatment. Considering the great number of snakes in all parts of
the bush, it is quite astonishing so few persons meet their death
by them. My own escapes have been almost innumerable, and so I
suppose have been most other bushmen's. Now and then one hears of
some very melancholy case of fatal effects. I do not know whether
naturalists have collected specimens of all the species to be found
in this country; but when collected they must form a singularly
striking and disgusting spectacle. I have seen a snake which seemed
full grown, not more than 8 inches long, and about the thickness of
a stout tobacco pipe, of the most glittering silver gray, and a
head like an oblong glass bead flattened. Then again there is that
genus of the diamond snake which frequents the water, running to
extreme length: on Paramatta bridge, many years ago, one was found
27 feet long. Between these range the black snake, which runs from
3 to 7 feet, and whose bite is deadly; the brown snake, commonly
found from 3 to 4 feet, said to be even more venomous than the
black; the copper-coloured snake, a very long, thin, and
beautifully coppered species, whether venomous or not in a high
degree, I cannot say; it is not very common. I saw no more than two
of them in the whole period of my residence. Besides these there
are gray, yellow, green, and carpet snakes; indeed you scarcely
pass a summer without seeing several new sorts. The reader perhaps
will feel it difficult of belief, but I should certainly not
withhold the fact&mdash;that I have known settlers plough up as
many snakes in ploughing ten acres of ground as would fill a peek
measure; and I was once shown a tract of bush road by a
fellow-traveller, in travelling along which some time previously he
assured me he had seen upwards of twenty snakes of various species.
It is a circumstance which elicits a universal expression of
surprise among the colonists that, snakes being so common as they
are, so few persons should be bitten. Sometimes they make away when
they are disturbed, at others again they do not; so that it is
difficult to determine whether there is in them a general and
natural dread of man. Taking all I have observed together I should
incline to say there is, but that it is modified by circumstances,
at times so much as entirely to disappear. For instance, a snake
may be provoked by blows to fly at his assailant; again, a friend
once told me that a black snake hunted him away from her nest a
considerable distance along the road, and he believed would have
overtaken and bitten him if he had not had a charge of shot in his
gun with which he turned and blew her all to pieces as she came on.
This I can state as certain, because I have experienced
it&mdash;that the human eye, if once it can catch the snake's, has
the power of fixing it and so holding the animal till it is
withdrawn.</p>

<p>To return. One of our next occupations was that of putting up or
rather down a good-sized dairy. To ward off the excessive heat it
is customary to dig out a large hole in the ground, one of the
sides being aslant instead of perpendicular for the entrance. This
hole is covered over with planks, and this again still further by
sheets of bark, to keep any dust or dirt from falling through on
the cream; and the whole roof is then covered over with the earth
that has been dug out, and is rendered thoroughly solid by beating.
At the entrance is placed a door which is padlocked, and all round
inside the milk is ranged in the keelers on benches of wood or
embankments of earth left for that purpose in the original
construction. We dug ours horizontally into the steep part of the
hill. We soon found we could milk about 40 head; and as they were
very good cows, it became necessary to take on another man, for one
man cannot milk more than about 10 or 12 cows, and get done in
anything like good time for the cattle to go out again; it quite
destroys cattle to keep them in the milkingyard till the heat of
the day. The man we took on was a good dairyman: his wages
30<i>l</i>. per annum. In the after part of the day R
&mdash;&mdash; and I worked at getting the stuff for a proper stock
yard of split stringy bark; having our own arrangement for the
proportions each was to take of the expense correspondently with
the proportions of our cattle to each other. Amusingly enough I
recollect that, as if by a tacit understanding, the old man's share
and M &mdash;&mdash;'s were alike forgotten to be mentioned. R
&mdash;&mdash; took, I suppose, the old man's share of the
business, and I M &mdash;&mdash;'s share. Nor do I recollect till
some years afterwards ever hearing anything about the share of the
cost equivalent to these two good people's share in the cattle; yet
they got their share of the gain. The fact was that, in my own
case, I had so identified M &mdash;&mdash;'s interests with mine by
this time, that it was an actual oversight; but I rather think my
mate's was a tacit voluntary acquiescence in my oversight than any
positive oversight of his own. However, be that as it may, we sent
in a few months about 17 cwt. of butter to Sydney; and the
<i>gross</i> proceeds were divided among us all in exact proportion
to each individual's lot of cows milked. I do not think I could
have been much in pocket by the speculation. But I never calculate
minutely in each separate transaction&mdash;I rather like to look
at the total aspect of things. And here I had nothing to dissatisfy
me. Through M &mdash;&mdash;'s good feeling toward me and her
ability, I had made a bargain which I considered fully doubled in
value the capital I laid out. The great step of giving up sawing
was taken; and certainly none too soon, for my constitution was
breaking under its incessant and severe toils. We had made
ourselves a little homestead from which we were not likely to be
disturbed by the advancing tide of settlement for some years to
come; and might even then, if we chose, buy it ourselves. And
lastly it left me full leisure for planning the application of the
amount of capital still at my command.</p>

<p>At this period we had a pretty practical proof how much the best
policy is honesty. One of the Scotchmen I have already named as
being concerned in cross transactions with cattle, was detected in
driving a whole herd of cattle, branded and unbranded, from a run
betwixt Hunter's River and Bathurst. He had actually got them past
Bathurst settlement when the brother of the owner, having a farm
between the New Country and Bathurst, met him, and knew the cattle
instantly. There was a magistrate's farm not half a mile distant,
to whom he went, and unhesitatingly made affidavit that they were
stolen, which he could safely do, as he knew the state of his
brother's affairs did not admit of his selling anything at the
time. The Scotchman and his drove were followed and taken back; the
beasts to the pound and the man to the gaol. He was committed and
tried at Sydney, but by some flaw in the proceedings acquitted. But
the affair was his death. He had married a young native girl a
couple of years before, and they had one child. He was much
attached to them both; in fact, but for these wild habits, was a
good husband and father. So much indeed was he beloved by his wife,
that she went to Sydney with him when he was committed for trial,
and went every day to the gaol to attend him. But anxiety about the
issue of the trial, and the cold of the gaol and close confinement
instead of horse exercise, aided no doubt by his own former free
habits of life, brought on consumption; or rather aggravated a
cough he had had for some months previously from sleeping out in
the wet when intoxicated, into more rapid consumption. And he was
scarcely up the country again when, to our great astonishment, the
news came one day that he was dead. He died sitting on the ground
at play with the child. He had no idea that he was even in danger,
and had left off taking medicine directly he got out of gaol,
saying, he was sure he should quickly be well; and his wife had so
little idea of it that she was gone for a bucket of water at the
time. We made him a rude coffin, and buried him on the side of the
hill where he had lived. His wife went down the country to her
friends; and for a time there was a little check on the nefarious
system which all agreed had brought him to his grave, and of which
his comrades could not ride past his lonely burial-place without
being reminded.</p>

mistakes&mdash;Eventual ruin&mdash;Directions and cautions for new
settlers&mdash;Account of best method of commencing a new
farm&mdash;Rates of wages&mdash;Stock and stores necessary to be
purchased and taken to the spot on first settling</p>

<p>TOWARD the end of the summer the tedium of one of the long,
bright, cloudless days was broken, about three o'clock in the
afternoon, by the arrival of a dray and party; and one of the first
acts of the party was the informing us that they had arrived with
the purpose of becoming our next-door neighbours. On a splendid
blood-horse sat &mdash;&mdash;, late of the &mdash;&mdash; regiment
of foot; he was the new settler. Originally of large fortune, he
had spent above thirty years in the army, during which period most
of his property had melted from his grasp, through a mere
thoughtless indifference to everything except amusement. Having
married at an advanced period of life a lady of habits if possible
even more thriftless than his own, he had come to the resolution, a
few months before the time of which I write, to sell his
commission, and with his remaining funds to become a settler. We
understood that he had a little family rising around him; and it
must no doubt have been very painful to a man of his benevolent
temperament to see them growing up with prospects so much narrower
than his own education had taught him to look upon as desirable.
But of all the men I ever met with who should have become settlers,
&mdash;&mdash; was certainly the last. It is from the errors and
mishaps of such individuals that an ill name has been often
bestowed on the colony at large; their incapacity has been
transformed into defects of the country. Now, while I feel bound on
the one part to point out most faithfully any circumstances in the
past conduct of affairs in New South Wales that render these
colonies objectionable as places of emigration to free British
people, I cannot but acknowledge myself equally bound, on the
other, to show the large and unquestionable natural capacities of
these countries, and so rescue them from a disrepute they do not
deserve. In furtherance of this object, I shall on the present
occasion give the reader a sketch of what Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and
his party did, and then another of what they ought to have done,
from the day of their arrival till the final ruin and renunciation
of the undertaking.</p>

<p>Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was a perfectly well-bred man, in short a
gentleman in every sense of the word, in manners, feelings, and
opinions; but he was entirely lacking in independence of character.
Whatever you proposed to him he did directly. Directly he was
invited to come in, he dismounted, left his horse standing at the
door, and entered. When the only chair we had was placed for him he
sat down in it; and when the rum-bottle and a tin pot were set on
the table beside him, he poured out and drank; and just what he did
this first ten minutes he did all the next ten months. If a brother
settler advised him to do this thing or that thing in the morning,
he did it; and if a government man advised him in the afternoon to
undo it, he undid it.</p>

<p>With his dray there was a party of no less than eleven men, and
all those who were doing anything at all were giving orders; the
rest had lit their pipes at the black gin's fire that was
smouldering a few yards away from our hut-door, or were dispersed
into one or other of our men's huts. He had also been persuaded to
hire an overseer; for which office, with his usual tact, he had
selected an old broken-down constable, of whom the men made all
manner of game for his imbecility, and no less heartily hated for
his former occupation; whilst he, on his part, let them do just as
they liked, on the principle of making as few enemies as he could,
and so retaining his situation by force of the men's good will
instead of the master's. At the station they camped at the night
before, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; had purchased for his party a fine
hindquarter of fresh beef; this had been thrown on the top of the
other stores in the dray under a blazing sun, and there it lay till
the sun went down; the consequence was, that by noon next day it
was fit only for the dogs. It must have weighed somewhere about 160
or 170 lbs., and of this about 30 or 40 lbs. were probably used by
the party; the rest fell to the share of the blacks and the dogs.
The same havoc took place with all the other stores. The men asked,
or rather demanded, whatever their prodigality suggested; and
whatever they asked the overseer gave. If one of them fixed a
covetous eye upon a black fellow's opossum-skin cloak, he gave his
whole week's tea, sugar, and tobacco for it; and if that were not
enough to secure his wish, then the week's beef and flour were
added. "What odds? there was plenty more where that came from;" and
"Our cove never allowances his men, lad!" When bed-time came it
appeared that our new neighbour had neither bed nor blanket. A
first-rate palliasse had been supplied to the dray for him by his
agent who made up his order for stores in Sydney, and with it
blankets befitting; but on the road they had camped one night at a
water-hole in a flat, where there was a sly grog-seller squatted.
Here some of the knowing ones of the party agreed to "kick the
governor" for "his footing up the country." Of course "the
governor" acceded; and while he was in the hut paying for "a gallon
of rum among all hands," his bed and blankets vanished. Every
individual of the party agreed in assuring him it must be the
blacks who had stolen it; but every individual of the party who
knew anything at all was fully aware that the sly grog man had had
it; and most of them, but particularly the bullock-driver's own
private friends, had an equally clear notion that, if the sly grog
man was the purchaser, their own bullock-driver was the seller. The
rest of the journey Mr. &mdash;&mdash; had to content himself with
a dirty bed and blanket which one of the party gave up to him. It
should in fairness be remarked, that where there is one man base
enough to commit such a theft under such circumstances there are
scores that would scorn to do so.</p>

<p>Next morning Mr. &mdash;&mdash; went to inspect his land. In
front of our hut ran the creek that constituted one of our side
lines; his adjacent side line was the opposite bank of the same
creek: upward and downward along his side of the creek, and almost
close to it, extended a small ridge, and in this ridge immediately
facing our hut was a gap; and standing in that gap and looking
forward, the eye was directed up a long flat tract with higher
ground on each side, and divided down the middle by a chain of fine
water-holes. In fact it was one of the adjuncts of our run which we
had hoped would remain for years undiscovered and unappropriated.
Travellers in search of land naturally supposed it to be part of
our run, being so near our hut and stockyard. It had become the
choice of the present owner through the information and advice of a
young friend he had in the surveyor's department, who had observed
it when charting in this part of the colony, and had taken notice
that although so near to our farm it was still not a part of
it.</p>

<p>In the course of the day they crossed the creek and moved up
through the gap (ours no more) to the foot of one of the hills on
their own run, at about a quarter of a mile from us. It was a
beautiful spot, in fact just such a one as, with good judgment and
persevering energy, would have made a perfect homestead. The
water-hole that just there occupied the centre must have had a
superficies of nearly half an acre, and was proportionately deep;
and the water itself was excellent. At the same place the hills on
one side (the side on which they had camped) fell back in a large
semicircle, making a flat of 35 or 40 acres; the land being of the
very best quality, a dark, almost impalpable loam. The timber was
both small and far apart. The party now got out a new tent they had
in the dray, and no sooner was it up, than in crowded master, men,
strangers, blacks, dogs and all; but it was not till we urged it
upon Mr. &mdash;&mdash; that he thought of having his stores
brought in and stowed in safety under his own eye. For several days
there was not the slightest attempt at work. The individual at
whose cost all this waste of time was taking place was really the
prime exemplar of it; very fond of fowling, and a remarkably fine
shot, he used to take himself off among the hills for the whole
day, with a couple of the men and his dogs; nor when he came back
at night was he heard even so much as to inquire what had been
going forward. The eleven men were, the overseer, a pair of
fencers, a rough carpenter, a stockman, a hut-keeper, a sort of
private servant or groom, a bullock driver and his mate, and a
couple of hands for general work; and it really was astonishing how
imperceptible, after the lapse of some weeks, was the aggregate
labour of all these men. The overseer, next to the master, was the
leading spirit of the confusion which reigned paramount at
&mdash;&mdash; ville; for the pitiable scene had no less imposing a
name before it was three weeks old. He had one of those geniuses
which roll in perpetual change from one object to another without
the least order or connexion; his acts were arranged according to
no course or purpose; they were the simple offspring of a mind busy
without having laid down to itself what to be busy about. The old
man was in perpetual motion; perpetually talking, here, there,
everywhere; but he had never got further at night than he was in
the morning. The pair of fencers had been met with and hired coming
up the country, and were a couple of lazy scoundrels, who it turned
out, on their going to work, did not even know how to keep their
own saw; indeed, from the way they went about falling their timber,
I much doubt whether they had ever done a month's work at splitting
in their lives. A real bushman may be always known by the
instinctive exactitude with which he hits the true fall of his
trees: these chaps, so far as I happened to see their stumps, never
set their saw in with regard to the true fall of their tree in
half-a-dozen instances, but either got their saw pinched, or let
their tree split up the whole length of the barrel before they
could get it cut through. After I saw a few of their performances
in this way, I was in constant expectation, till the time they
bolted, of hearing that some tree had come down and crushed them.
Falling with the saw, and especially on a hill-side as they were,
is an art requiring at once so much judgment, and coolness, and
activity, as not to admit of trifling. The number of men that are
killed by trees in this way is almost incredible. Such, however,
was not the lot of either of this worthy couple, at least as long
as they remained at &mdash;&mdash; ville. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; let
them get about 45<i>l</i>. in his debt, between ready money,
rations, and tools. Their work, on being gathered up and drawn in
from the bush, was not worth above 5<i>l</i>. or 6<i>l</i>.
altogether. If they had been workmen they should have been out of
debt, and have had about another 45<i>l</i>. to take in the same
time. The reader will think it a singular class to have an
existence, but I can assure him that it is a real though not common
one, viz., men who go about the country taking jobs of various
kinds without any knowledge of the work, and then, when they have
had a good rest and got all they can, running away. I became
acquainted with several of these fellows who, so far as could be
ascertained, there was every reason to believe, made regular
circuits of the country; just keeping away from this or that part
for a period proportionate to the scandalousness of what they had
done: and when they thought all was blown over, visiting it again.
The next on the list is the carpenter. He was an oldish man, of
whom not much could be expected, but he had succeeded in striking a
bargain with Mr. &mdash;&mdash; for 2<i>l</i>. a-week; 30<i>s</i>.
would have been plenty for him: however, he was after all by far
the most efficient man, and with the help of the hut-keeper, who
was also a tolerably industrious man, succeeded in putting up for
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; a very fair hut; but he took nearly three months
about it: three months which should have been very differently
employed. The two hands engaged for general work were sent off soon
after the arrival of the party for a flock of sheep about a
thousand strong, which Mr. &mdash;&mdash; had bought of a settler
in the Bathurst country; or rather which had been bought for him by
his Sydney agent. The price given was most exorbitant: such indeed
as it is impossible to believe that a shrewd man of business like
Mr. Auctioneer &mdash;&mdash; would or could give, unless under
force of some understanding of particular personal aptitude. When
the sheep arrived they did not turn out to be any great things as
to either fleece or frame, and upwards of forty dropped on the
road; besides which they had had a rush by native dogs one night,
and so lost by the slaughter or otherwise nearly fifty more.
Lastly, there was a lot of old ewes among them which it was evident
to any experienced eye could not weather the coming winter; so that
really for his thousand sheep Mr. &mdash;&mdash; got home only a
little more than eight hundred and fifty. The men who were sent for
them too were neither of them shepherds, but only common working
hands; which was another great mistake. Probably if the flock had
been in charge of a good shepherd, the rush would have been guarded
against and avoided; and such a man, when he found his flock
dropping with over driving, would have slackened the rate he was
travelling at, to one at which all the sheep could keep up. The
dead loss here alone, <i>i.e</i>. by the native dogs and
overdriving, may be reckoned at least at 100<i>l</i>. or
120<i>l</i>. Again, the whole flock was bought at full 5<i>s</i>.
a-head too high, making 250<i>l</i>. more. Lastly, for the price
reduced thus by '5<i>s</i>. there ought to have been no old sheep
at all, whereas there were nearly a hundred; so that altogether in
this one item Mr. &mdash;&mdash; threw away about 400<i>l</i>. So
much for the sheep and the shepherds. When I say of the stockman,
the groom, the bullock-driver, and his mate, that their duties are
such in themselves as make no show in a new farm, I shall have
noticed the whole stock of labour, and what does it amount to? In
ten months' time from their occupying the farm, there was one of
the sides of a paddock fence put up, a tolerable hut for Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; erected, all the bullocks but one lost, great
quantities of stores borrowed from neighbouring settlers, which had
to be paid for eventually by cash, 400<i>l</i>. had been thrown
away in the sheep speculation; between the original hands and
subsequent ones, there was above 250<i>l</i>. of bad debts on the
books; and Mr. &mdash;&mdash; had purchased and actually paid for a
herd of cattle to the extent of 1500<i>l</i>. which he never saw
mustered, and of which the greatest part were so wild that their
original owner had never been able to get them into a stockyard for
seven years before, and which he was now selling because they were
so wild. In fact they were running into all herds, where the
unbranded ones were more frequently retained and appropriated than
separated and restored. This part of the bargain might almost be
set down as dead loss. And thus, in ten months' time, was there an
end to the sum of nearly 2000<i>l</i>.</p>

<p>I now proceed to place in contrast with this dismal tale a
statement of the course which a new settler should pursue; and I am
confident no man of ordinary talents, possessing a few hundred
pounds, and guiding himself in its outlay and management as I
suggest, could fail to realize in a few years the return of a
handsome fortune.</p>

<p>1. I know of nothing in which the axiom of "More haste worse
speed" is so true as in the approach of a new settler to his
undertaking. My advice to him would be on no account to neglect, in
the first place, a tour of inspection. He should put his knapsack
on his back and penetrate to the farthest limit of colonization. He
should travel as unpretendingly as possible; up the country every
hut door is open to the traveller. If he likes to make the lower
orders any little present of tobacco, &amp;c., it will generally be
accepted; but if not offered it will not be asked for&mdash;indeed
it is seldom looked for. By thus stopping a good deal at the
labouring men's huts he will hear the prices of labour, of stock,
of land, and of goods, from individuals not interested in deceiving
him; whereas I am afraid, if he trust for his information on those
points to landowners, he will often be misled. I cannot deny that
it is much too common a practice with old stockholders to try to
sell refuse or other stock to new-comers on very unfair terms.
However, on the other hand, it will be well enough to correct the
men's views by afterwards hearing the masters'. But the
conversation that passes in the labouring men's huts, when the
pipes are lit, after tea in the evening, is certainly both the most
varied and the soundest as to facts. They have no pecuniary
interest in the matters they talk about, but each relating his
observation and experience in different parts of the colony,
incites others to do the same. If anything is exaggerated, there
never wants some one able and ready to correct it. On such a
journey the new settler will often be disgusted by the conduct and
expressions of individuals; but the general tone of what he hears
will amply repay him. In short, he will <i>learn</i> more in one
three months thus occupied than in seven years spent in the usual
routine of life among those of his own station. That three months I
would earnestly urge him, as he values his subsequent success, not
to omit taking advantage of.</p>

<p>2. The next general principle I would lay down is this:&mdash;To
make his undertaking, whenever it does commence, as much as
possible <i>a series of experiments</i>, rather than <i>one
experiment</i>. Let him go on by degrees, feeling his way. The
banks will give him very high interest for his ready money&mdash;at
least double what he would get in England; and up-country living
really costs next to nothing. After he is well settled in a hut on
his land, his personal charges for food can hardly be above
15<i>l</i>. or 18<i>l</i>., per year; and, having no rent to pay,
clothing need be his only other fixed expense; and on that again a
bushman seldom spends more than 10<i>l</i>. a year. Well then, so
situated, he should lay out, in the first place, a third or so of
his capital. As that seems to prosper, he may go on to a second
fraction, correcting any error and supplying any deficiencies in
his second experiment, which he may by this time have detected in
his first. By and bye, with added experience and security, he may
complete his purchases.</p>

<p>3. Another advantage the new settler should by no means set
light by, his credit. For there is really not any such difference
between the prices he must give in ready cash and those he may give
on credit when purchasing his stock as to warrant the nervousness
which some persons feel about taking credit. In fact, there is a
perfectly definite feeling in the minds of large stockholders, that
they would not think of turning away a good bill for 500<i>l</i>.
at twelve months for a flock of sheep or herd of cattle, though for
the same flock or herd they would "rather of the two" have the
500<i>l</i>. in cash. But when the new settler, by merely pressing
the point firmly, can turn the 40<i>l</i>. interest of the sum into
his own concern, he would be very ill fitted for business if he
neglected to do so. Such a man had better not begin business in New
South Wales.</p>

<p>Again, another and very important advantage is this: any man
that has 1000<i>l</i>. in one of the Sydney banks will readily get
credit for 3000<i>l</i>. worth of stock; and, if he have become
sufficiently versed in the customs of the colony, he may get his
stock on terms by which he really clears the purchase money as it
becomes due. Now, although I should be backward to advise the
adoption of such a course of speculation to its fullest extent, and
in all cases I think it may very properly be suggested for adoption
according to circumstances and capacities, in general it would be a
dangerous course: few men are cool headed and firm minded enough to
resist the exciting solicitude of such a position: fewer still, at
the time they become settlers, are sufficiently sound judges of the
chances of the case to make a safe bargain in it; and fewer still
meet with a vender into whose hands, in making such an arrangement,
it would be desirable to fall. Therefore, on the whole, I do not
give this 3rd item of directions for general use. They who use it
will consider that they do so on their own responsibility.</p>

<p>4. On settling, and always afterwards, till your circumstances
and arrangements have become such as to place you beyond all
danger, look after every thing yourself; join in all the farm
operations yourself; it both ensures their being well done, and
makes you so acquainted with them that you can instruct others.</p>

<p>5. If your concerns are extensive enough to permit your having
an overseer, take care to have a good one; if not, get a better
sort of working hand, and give him 5<i>l</i>. or 10<i>l</i>. a year
higher wages. An adviser of some sort you must have, or you will
fall into mistakes, often of a very expensive and pernicious
character: and to have an ignorant, weakminded man in such a
capacity is worse than to have none; for your own mistakes alone
will be preferable to your own and his together.</p>

<p>6. Treat your hands rather better than worse than your
neighbours. The damage to a settler's concerns that arises from the
neglect of his people (the intentional, revengeful neglect) is
beyond all estimate.</p>

<p>So much for matters of general conduct. To them may be added
these directions upon the more immediate business of settling a
farm:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The outskirts of the colony are the best tracts for
occupation; the land is less picked; the expenses of fencing,
&amp;c. do not come so suddenly on you; and there is much more
unoccupied land adjacent to you which you get the benefit of for
some years. In making your selection, see to it that you combine
high and low lands; the high for wet seasons, the low for times of
drought. Take care to have a constant supply of water. It should be
either a creek or river, or holes that never dry in any season. I
have known persons sit down at what seemed good water-holes even in
a dry time, and put up extensive buildings and fence in paddocks;
and then when a herd of cattle and a couple of flocks of sheep came
to drink out of the reservoirs for a few months, find that it was a
supply formed entirely by superficial water-courses without any
subterranean increase; and be compelled, after submitting to drink
mud for some weeks and to see scores of their stock die, to abandon
all their erections and move away in search of a site for a new
homestead. Lastly, take care that adjacent, at least if not on your
own land best, as no subsequent comer can then take it; but if not
on your land, at least let it be in the mountains where nobody is
likely to purchase. You may venture to draw your split stuff and
sawn stuff five or six miles, but farther would be
inconvenient.</p>

<p>2. Having chosen your farm, buy a dray and team (say five or six
bullocks) near Sydney and load it with necessaries. But for any
future lot of stores you need from Sydney, pay for the carriage by
one of the public carriers. Your own dray will be for several years
in full occupation at home. Besides, not one bullock-driver in ten
is fit to be trusted with your team by himself in a three months'
trip. The carriers barely get a living, looking after their own
teams; the loss of bullocks and wear and tear of drays, and delay
by floods and one thing and another, being very heavy. Of course
your not looking after your own team must do the work at a great
disadvantage.</p>

<p>3. Hire in Sydney to go up with your dray, a bullock-driver; a
night watchman of the bullocks, who is called the bullock-driver's
mate; an overseer, who is to take charge from the beginning of the
stores and the conduct of things generally under yourself; a
hutkeeper; a pair of splitters; and a single hand for general
work&mdash;seven hands in all. If you are not going far out, you
need take only the bullock-driver and his mate, the overseer, and a
single hand for general work, and get the rest on your arrival. But
whatever men you take out of Sydney, have references as to
character: on no account hire the overseer, the bullock-driver, and
his mate without the closest and most satisfactory examination.</p>

<p>4. Buy your sheep and cattle if possible of your neighbours; if
not, of some other person of known probity. An individual who is to
meet you face to face for years will not be nearly so likely to
take you in as a settler of some distant part. The same may be said
about the purchase of your horse and working bullocks. There is
also this additional reason&mdash;the less distance your stock have
to be driven to your farm the fewer of them will be left on the
road.</p>

<p>To complete this little set of maxims for the new settler, there
needs now merely, first, a list in their order of the various
operations that are to be proceeded with on arrival at the farm,
and second, a list of the articles with which the settler should
load his team on leaving Sydney for the interior.</p>

<p>1. Order of operations:&mdash;</p>

<p>Immediately you reach your land, traverse it and select the site
for your homestead; and let that be a spot a little elevated.</p>

<p>Set your spare hands or any blacks there may be about to strip
you forty or fifty sheets of bark. Of these have two tent huts
made; the one for yourself and servant, the other for the men. One
or at the utmost two days should suffice to construct two good snug
weather-tight tent huts. Next get up a moderate sized stockyard,
say five rods by six. Let it be very strong; and let it contain
milking bales. On a new farm nothing is more indispensable than the
stockyard; without it there is great difficulty in yoking the
bullocks; there is no place to confine a beast till wanted, and it
is necessary for milking bush cows. Another convenience it must
contain is what is called "the gallows" for hauling up a beast that
has been slaughtered, to take the hide off. After the stockyard,
you should get a small paddock of ten acres fenced in, and while
the fencing is going on other hands should be employed in clearing
the timber. Plough it as speedily as possible; let it lie for a
couple of months, if time permits; and then cross plough it and put
in seven or eight acres of wheat, one of maize for your horse, and
another of potatoes and garden seeds.</p>

<p>Next have a couple of yards of good 6 feet paling erected for
your sheep (if you have sheep); and if you begin with more than two
flocks, have ready also, before purchasing them, a lot of hurdles.
But on no account buy the sheep till you have hurdles or yards
sufficient for their safe keeping. I have known the most lamentable
losses to accrue from the use of insecure bough yards. Sheep ought
never to be brought to a station till there is a secure defence for
them from the native dogs. In the same manner if you buy horned
cattle, have your stockyard first ready; and yard them every night
till they get thoroughly reconciled to the run, sending out with
them all day a couple of men.</p>

<p>Having got thus far you may leave your splitters to put you up a
better, permanent, roofed hut while you go away to make your
purchases of live stock. This hut should be strong; as you will
have to appropriate one room of it to the purpose of a store. You
must determine its construction according to the locality. In some
mountainous districts, the winter is severe enough to require that
every interstice be stopped; whereas in other parts you might live
out of doors all the year round.</p>

<p>The next thing will be a shearing shed and a wool press. It will
be best not to go to great expense with these at first. A common
barked shed, of sufficient dimensions, boarded along one side for
the line of shearers, will suffice. The next erection should be a
small barn; and the next a dairy of a size according as to whether
you at once commence a dairy farm or not.</p>

<p>With these accommodations you may consider yourself
snug&mdash;without them your business will be one round of mishap,
vexation, and loss. Rough buildings of split stuff sides and bark
roof are paid for at the rate of 10<i>s</i>. per foot, measuring
one side and one end.</p>

<p>A good three-rail fence may be paid for at the rate of
2<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. a rod; if more rails, the price
increases.</p>

<p>Falling and burning off vary according to the closeness, size,
and species of the timber.</p>

<p>Ploughing you ought to get done at 20<i>s</i>. an acre.</p>

<p>Reaping varies according to the crop.</p>

<p>Shearing also varies according to the size, fleece, &amp;c., and
the locality.</p>

<p>An overseer of any value cannot be got under 40<i>l</i>. or
50<i>l</i>. a year.</p>

<p>A good bullock-driver will cost you 30<i>l</i>. to 35<i>l</i>.,
and you had better give such a one 5<i>l</i>. or even 10<i>l</i>.
extra than have a man whose bad management will kill two or three
bullocks at 10<i>l</i>. a head in his twelvemonth's driving.</p>

<p>Shepherds also of any value are not easily met with under
25<i>l</i>. or 30<i>l</i>. per year. If they are to go far out they
will require more.</p>

<p>Hutkeepers' wages are 5<i>l</i>. a year less than the wages of
shepherds. Common working hands in the well-settled parts of the
colony vary from 20<i>l</i>. to 25<i>l</i>. per annum; at the
out-stations they get about 5<i>l</i>. a year more.</p>

<p>The Blacks should be kindly treated, as they are of great
service in stripping bark, showing new runs, tracking lost bullocks
and sheep, &amp;c. &amp;c.; moreover kind treatment will be found
the great secret of restraining their tendency to furtive and
vindictive depredations. At the same time, with kindness must be
mingled a manifestation of the most perfect fearlessness, but it
should not be mere parade and bravado. They are very quick at
detecting the true feeling that dictates an action. Arms should
always be ready, and securely kept, and they should know it too. I
subjoin finally a list of the articles with which it will be
advisable to load the dray on proceeding to take possession of a
new farm:&mdash;</p>

<p>1 ton flour.</p>

<p>* Enough meat for the journey: on arrival beasts for slaughter
can be purchased of neighbours.</p>

<p>4 or 5 cwt. salt. 1 cwt. soap (or ½ cwt.) *2 chests tea (1
chest).</p>

<p>*7 or 8 cwt. sugar (4 cwt.).</p>

<p>*3 cwt. tobacco (1 cwt.).</p>

<p>2 frying-pans.</p>

<p>1 doz. tin quart pots.</p>

<p>1 doz.,, pint,, Several iron pots.</p>

<p>1 doz. pocket knives.</p>

<p>1 doz. tin plates.</p>

<p>½ doz. tin dishes.</p>

<p>1 doz. blankets.</p>

<p>Bed-ticking.</p>

<p>3 or 4 doz. check shirts.</p>

<p>2 or 3 doz. woollen ditto.</p>

<p>2 or 3 doz. pair of boots.</p>

<p>Jackets, of sorts,</p>

<p>Trousers,,</p>

<p>Needles, thread, pipes.</p>

<p>3 cross-cut saws: a 6-ft., a 6½, a 7-ft.</p>

<p>1 pit saw, fine space, 7-ft. plate.</p>

<p>Tiller and box for ditto.</p>

<p>Cross-cut and pit saw files.</p>

<p>½ doz. best falling axes.</p>

<p>2 lopping axes.</p>

<p>2 mortising axes.</p>

<p>1 broad axe.</p>

<p>1 heavy adze.</p>

<p>1 light ditto.</p>

<p>Chest of carpenter's tools.</p>

<p>Grindstone and frame.</p>

<p>½ doz. padlocks, hasps, and staples.</p>

<p>* Several bags of nails of sizes (100 lbs., of sorts).</p>

<p>Fire-arms, powder and ball.</p>

<p>4 or 5 buckets.</p>

<p>30 or 40 fathoms of good ½ in. rope.</p>

<p>A small churn.</p>

<p>½ doz. spades.</p>

<p>½ doz. heavy breaking-up hoes.</p>

<p>A small but very strong plough and tackle (may be left till
second load).</p>

<p>½ doz. reaping hooks (ditto).</p>

<p>*1 doz. sheep-shears (ditto).</p>

<p>Wool-bagging, and packing needles and twine (ditto).</p>

<p>A good tarpaulin.</p>

<p>Paper, pens, ink, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This may be taken as a general guide to the articles necessary.
Possibly an odd necessary or two may have escaped me. But the eye
of any practised person on the spot will detect the omission for
you. The prices that should be given for the various articles may
be immediately ascertained by reference to the 'Price Current'
daily published in the Sydney papers. If the team should not be
equal to the draught of the load (which may be ascertained by
estimating the weights, and inquiring of the driver what he
considers the strength of the bullocks equal to), the items marked
thus * may be reduced, and the deduction left for future carriage.
Meat can always be purchased on the road. Tobacco is an article in
great request, so that the quantity stated should be as little
diminished as possible.</p>

<p>Thus furnished, the new settler may commence with a confidence
of having the entire machinery of his undertaking in his own
hands.</p>

<p>Here, as in all else, he will find it most advantageous to
cultivate the goodwill of both servants and neighbours. He will for
years find himself occasionally at a loss for both counsel and
assistance. But equity, liberality, and kindness to others, will in
almost all cases ensure him a similar return from them&mdash;so
that no man who will observe, inquire, and reflect, can fail. And
such being the case, it seems very much to be deprecated that this
fine colony should have its reputation injured by the sloth or
craziness of individuals who carried the elements of their ruin
within themselves.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter XV. A Cattle-Racket.</h2>

<p class="newspaper">Explanation of the term&mdash;Objectionable and mischievous

of the land-regulations&mdash;Arrest of the author on a charge of
cattle-stealing&mdash;Escape&mdash;Two nights' journey through the

<p>THE term at the head of this chapter was originally applied in
New South Wales to the agitation of society which took place when
some wholesale system of plunder in cattle was brought to light. It
is now commonly applied to any circumstance of this sort, whether
greater or less, and whether really springing from a felonious
intent or accidental. About the middle of winter it came to my turn
to play a part in one of these affairs. I must admit that I write,
as indeed I always think, of this business with no little
indignation and disgust. Had I been really guilty in the matter, or
could the gentleman (a magistrate of the territory) to whom I owe
this piece of ill treatment be supposed to have thought me so, or
were mine a single case, the exception to the general rule, I admit
that it would be both unreasonable and unjust for me to lay such
stress upon it. But when, on the contrary, it is certain that this
is only the common treatment which the labouring and lower class in
New South Wales sustain at the hands of the upper, and when not
only, as the reader will perceive, I must have been entirely
guiltless of any dishonest intention, but that Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,
my prosecutor (a magistrate&mdash;and there are many such), must
have felt convinced of it in his own mind, I am sure every
right-minded person will say that too much notice cannot be
attracted to a state of society where such things take place, if
its scene is indeed to become the arena for British emigration on
any extensive scale. The fact is, the upper classes of New South
Wales settlers have so long been used to deal with the poor
wretched convicts, and to tell them they have no rights, and to
taunt and mock them if they talk about seeking redress for any ill
treatment, that the habit and the feeling at the bottom of it have
become rooted in their very nature; and they would wish to treat
free people in the same way. "Is not the free labourer here for our
convenience&mdash;as a substitute for convicts who can no longer be
found in sufficient numbers to supply us? What more profit is one
to us than the other? Why should we treat one better than the
other?" Such is positively the feeling. And peculiarly suited as
these colonies are for the settlement of the surplus labouring
population of the British Islands, this feeling has become an
effectual bar to both the welfare of the class that might be
benefited and the advancement of the colony. For this same feeling
extends itself to the land question, and has poisoned all the
information and the counsel which the higher settlers and the
council of the colony and the governors have given to the British
government at home. Thousands of pounds are now spent in drinking,
&amp;c., in New South Wales, by the labouring class, which, if
small portions of land were to be had, they would lay out in its
purchase. But such a practice the upper class of settlers
universally regard as detrimental to their interests, and therefore
an infringement of their rights; as if no man had a right to land
but themselves. However, as I mean to notice this point more
particularly hereafter, I shall here merely remark that the same
supercilious intolerance pervades the whole feeling with which the
upper class in New South Wales generally regard the lower, and is
the cause of such grievous injuries to the free labourer as often
entirely to counterbalance the advantages which emigration
otherwise offers.</p>

<p>My own case was exactly this:&mdash;the inspection that I made
of D &mdash;&mdash;'s cattle in buying them was of course very
cursory; many of them, in riding about the run, we met with but
once; and there were some which I was obliged to take unseen and by
the stock-book, and trusting entirely to the stockman for making
them good. In gathering them to drive away to our own run, two
beasts, a cow and a steer, belonging to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, were
mistaken for two of those I had bought. They were beasts exactly
answering the description in the stockbook I received with my
purchase, and the brands had partly grown out and partly run. Under
some circumstances, when the hair is not only burnt off by the
brand, but the skin much injured, the brand, as it is called, "runs
together." The cicatrix, instead of being of the form of the letter
of the brand, is perhaps nothing more than a large indiscriminate
scar of which you can make nothing. And when beasts are branded
very young, as these two had been, there is added to this the still
further obliteration of growth, and partial reformation of skin and
hair; and thus a brand often becomes entirely unintelligible. So it
was here; the stockman had allowed these two beasts of Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;'s to get among mine, leaving my corresponding two
behind. If anything, I had the best of it, for my two head were not
as good beasts as Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s by at least a pound. I am
fully aware that every person who understands cattle and is
acquainted with the customs of New South Wales will acquit me of
design in the matter, and shall therefore take no further trouble
to vindicate myself. The fact was that I made the mistake in
fetching them in, through the brands being run, and their being so
like the two I took them for; whilst the stockman passed them
through the hurry in which we started, leaving him time only to
inspect the cattle by their marks and not their brands. However, it
seems that Mr. &mdash;&mdash; no sooner heard from his own stockman
that two of his own cattle were missing, and two of mine
corresponding to them were on the run, than it instantly struck him
where his own were gone, and he as instantly set about finding
where I had taken my cattle to, and having done so, procured a
warrant and sent it after me.</p>

<p>Night had set in, and we were all sitting round the hut fire
smoking after tea. It had rained hard all day, and we were enjoying
the change from working out in the wet to a warm hut and blazing
fire. The rain still continued, and the wind came blustering
through every cranny that was left unstopped. All of a sudden our
whole tribe of dogs flew barking and yelling toward one end of the
hut, where we directly perceived they had somebody at bay. Some
voices shouted to us to come and take the dogs off or they would be
shot. On going out and bringing the parties in, we found them to be
an officer of the mounted police with his men and an old constable.
This officer we knew as a perfect tyrant wherever he dared to
exercise his power. He had been long notorious as a bushranger
hunter, and it is said that he was not very particular whether he
took his prey dead or alive. He asked for me by name, and told the
constable to take me into custody. I knew I had done nothing
illegal, intentionally, and did not feel a great deal of
uneasiness; still I saw much unpleasantness in being in gaol
several months, until the trials came on. It took me very little
reflection to resolve to get away if I could, as I knew I could
surrender and take my trial, if necessary, when the time came.
There seems to be in some minds an opinion that it is wrong for a
person in custody to try to get away; I did not think so, nor do I
now. It was might against right, and as it was their business to
keep me, it was as clearly mine to get away. Nor was I long about
it. As soon as the constable had laid his hand on me, and arrested
me in the King's name, the dragoons began to go out to unsaddle
their horses. One of them called out to inquire where the best
place to tether them would be. I told the constable to tell them
where the best grass was, and as he went to the door to tell them,
I followed, and rushing past him ran down the hill and across the
flat toward the creek, the whole party following me. It was well
they had got their saddles and accoutrements off and all in a heap,
with their cloaks thrown confusedly among them; otherwise I should
probably have had a shot after me. Perhaps they made sure they
could catch me; it turned out otherwise. I went full drive across
the creek at a flying leap, whilst they, not knowing of it, ran off
the bank into it. It was running high and very strong with the
day's hard rain, but it was so narrow (not above 10 feet) that they
could hardly be drowned in it when there were so many together to
help one another. I made good my way up the range on the other side
the creek, and in a couple of minutes afterwards was quite safe
from pursuit. R &mdash;&mdash;, with a spirit I cannot too much
commend, immediately told the officer, that being now master of
that hut, he should feel obliged to him to saddle and ride on. The
officer had certainly brought it on himself; had he merely done his
duty in an inoffensive manner, no notice would have been taken of
him, and he would have had shelter and something offered him to
eat, the same as any other traveller; but he was Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;, my prosecutor's friend, and could not help mingling
his ill-natured jokes with his official duty. I knew the bush so
well about our hut that I found no difficulty in making my way in
the direction of Goulburn Plains. It was necessary that I should
get as far away as possible before daylight, and even thus my
escape was doubtful; for there were some strange blacks in the
neighbourhood, and I conjectured that the military party would stay
at the hut till the morning, and then get a black and track me; as
the aborigines will follow man or beast by the foot-track,
sometimes, days after they have passed. Our own blacks I was sure
would only mislead them, for they were very fond of me; but if they
happened to have seen the other camp, and were to get a black from
it, I had every reason to believe my escape would be much more
difficult. The rain too had now quite ceased, and any tracks made
would remain. As I knew I had no time to lose, I made across to the
road, about a couple of miles from the hut toward Goulburn, and
went off, as soon as I reached it, at a swinging trot. When I had
got on about five miles, I heard the clatter of horses following
me, and supposing at first that it was travellers, stood for them
to come up; but in another instant the rattle of the military
accoutrements made me aware of who was coming, and I got as quickly
as possible some distance off the road. It was too dark for them to
see me, and they had no dogs to scent me, so they went sweeping
past full trot. I could hear them swearing, the officer as loudly
and as vulgarly as any one of the party. I was fully aware they had
no expectation of finding me on the high road; they would, I knew,
give me credit for being too good a bushman to need the road to
travel by: and not knowing that R &mdash;&mdash; had turned them
out of the hut, I could not make out why they were travelling at
that speed in that direction, at that time. The fact, however, was,
as I afterwards found, that they were merely making their way to a
farm where they thought they were sure of good quarters for the
night; and had intended to come back with the first light and put a
black on my track. On the other hand, I was keeping the road that I
might pass a sheep-station where there were two heavy flocks of
sheep, and get the shepherds to turn their flocks out at the first
peep of day and one of them drive up the road and the other down,
and so obliterate my tracks up to the station; whilst I struck off
again into the bush, after retracing my ground back some little
distance. I now hardly knew what to do. Were they in search of me
now? Would they return in the morning to track? Had they left any
of the party at the hut? Such were the queries that alternately
presented themselves. The sheep-station was only one mile farther,
so I resolved to go on quietly, and creep up as near as their dogs
would let me without raising an alarm, and listen. I approached so
close as to hear their conversation; and could gather from it, that
the military party had given them a call, and after a few bullying
words, gone on ahead. Upon this I went up to the fire. The
shepherds were governmentmen, and as they were always well treated
when they came to my station they promised to do what I requested;
as it was not yet so late that their doing so would create
suspicion if any of the party still remained at the hut, (for they
could not tell exactly how many had passed, as all did not ride
right up to their fire.) One of the shepherds set off to my hut
with a straw hat he had been making, to offer for sale to some of
our people; really, however, to bring me word how matters stood. He
pulled foot and was back about midnight; R &mdash;&mdash; came back
with him. Of course I could not but laugh heartily when I heard
what had taken place. Before our trip to the Manning, we had been
down to the neighbourhood of Jervis's Bay looking for a fall of
cedar, and there, in one of the most wild and lonely gullies grown
up with a perfect mat of vegetation, we had encountered a forsaken
hut and stock-yard. Even when we were there, it had been so long
abandoned that the hoof-beaten yard was covered with the richest
crop of mallows I ever saw; they over-topped the fence itself; and
all round the cattle-tracks bore testimony that even the wild
cattle themselves very rarely approached. We had no doubt at the
time from various indications, that it had been the quarters of a
gang of gullyrakers. At this time there were still great mobs of
wild cattle about these gullies and ranges; indeed so labyrinthine
and puzzling are the ranges and ravines hereabouts, that whoever
pursued the illicit occupation here, earned, as much as it could be
said to be earned under such circumstances, the booty they gained.
Traversing the upper level of the country, the gullies here seem
like enormous channels cut in the earth, meeting each other from
various directions, and then intermingling and crossing in ways
without end. Often as you walk along through the brush and scrub,
you are within a yard of some vast hollow that would parade a
hundred thousand horse, before you observe it; sometimes the fall
is gradual, but generally it is sudden; and the depth beneath is a
wilderness of shrubs and trees, betwixt which you cannot see the
ground. To this old hut it was arranged (between R &mdash;&mdash;
and myself only, of course) that I should make my way, and that he
should follow me as speedily as possible with some money in coin.
We were talking till about five o'clock in the morning, during
which time the men at the sheep-station boiled me a piece of beef
and baked me a damper, for the journey. I then started, knowing it
would soon be broad day. Leaving the road at the most advisable
point, I struck straight across the bush for Goulburn Plains. My
satisfaction was complete when, before I had gone a hundred yards
from the hut, flakes of snow began to fall; and in half an hour's
time it was coming down so thickly, that I was obliged to stop and
shelter myself in a hollow tree till broad daylight, for fear of
losing my way. It was well I did so, for with the light I could
hardly make good my course, so blinding was the storm, and so
impossible was it to ascertain which was east, west, north, or
south. All I could do was to keep the wind steadily on the same
shoulder as it was when I started. Late in the afternoon I made the
river that borders the plains, but five or six miles from where I
expected. At the township the police had a station; and as I knew
my escape would be made known, and my description circulated by
this time among all the corps in that quarter, so I was of course
obliged to keep out of sight for fear of meeting some one or other
of them riding round among the farms. I therefore did not venture
out of the bush before it was quite dark; but sat down in a hollow
of the river bank, and made a good supper off my damper and beef. I
could not venture on making a fire, excepting so far as the
striking a light into the tinder to kindle my pipe. To have made a
fire sufficient to warm me would have endangered detection; but it
was bitterly cold. As soon as it became quite dark I pushed on
across the plain, having first had, however, to wade t he river
nearly up to my arm-pits. Such a job after dark, when the snow is
on the ground, and after being used to the more genial parts of the
country for so many years, is no joke. When I got out of the water,
I was so benumbed and helpless, that I thought I should have been
frozen before I could get my clothes on. It was no easy thing at
that time of night when at length I started, and with every thing
so confused by the fall of snow, to make my way across those wide
plains with anything like exactitude. The roads were all covered,
so that when I crossed even the main one I did not perceive it. I
hoped to make the gap for Bulla Melita, but went a great deal above
it; when finding I had done so, I took across the ranges at once.
It was, as everybody who knows that part of the country will be
aware, a rough journey before I got out on the Lake Bathurst road
about five miles on the Sydney side of the lake. I now knew exactly
where I was, and struck straight across to a station where I knew I
should be "all right" in one of the creeks on the coast side of the
road, and soon had the pleasure of rousing old &mdash;&mdash; out
of bed to let me in. He stared with all the eyes he had to see me,
but soon comprehended the case. Nothing, however, could convince
him but that I had stolen the beasts in question; such is the
tendency of man to judge others by himself. For here and indeed all
up that tract of country by the coast mountain the gully-raking
system, as well as other <i>cross</i> practices with cattle, was at
this time prevailing to a great extent. I stopped and rested here
for eight and forty hours; as I knew the snow had covered up my
tracks as fast as I made them, and I was sure the police would not
guess among all the stations the exact one I had reached. The third
morning the stockman having a spare horse we started together, I
leaving my own clothes to him and wearing some of his. He was to
ride with me to Broughton's Creek, and then return with the horses.
Once there I should be past all the police except the party in
Illawarra, and in that district the brush is so thick that if a
fugitive come in sight of a policeman it must be either by meeting
him full butt in coming round a corner or topping a ridge, or else
by walking with his eyes shut. We made a hasty but pleasant
journey. I had never gone exactly the track we followed before, so
that some of the scenery of this part was really as wonderful to me
as it was strange. No description can convey an idea of the savage
grandeur of the district of the Shoalhaven River and its gullies.
Blocks of country many miles in extent stand up square and wall
sided from the level around, their bleak flat table-tops among the
clouds, and you wander among their bases as if along the streets of
some forsaken giants' city. In other places the descent from the
higher land into the gullies is so far, so wood shadowed and
obscure, so steep, that it seems, as you go down, down, down, as if
you were travelling to the darksome depths of a nether world. But
then again this descent once efected you find yourself among
romantic flats of the richest soil covered with ferns and rank
grass, amidst which meander fine broad streams of crystal water,
icy cold, over-hung and bordered by magnificent trees; the vast
gum-tree ages old, and hollowed at the butt by the bush fires of
centuries long past, so that a whole party might camp within. At
the foot of this mountain near Boulli there is an old stringy-bark
tree into whose trunk it is a common report that nine horsemen once
rode together; nor do I see any reason for disbelieving it; its
head is broken off some height up, and it looks like some huge
factory chimney struck off half way down. Here and there amidst
these solemn fastnesses, but many miles apart, you meet with the
solitary stock-station, amidst some scope of park-like forest that
a nobleman might envy for the site of mansion or castle. The sleek
and lordly beeves and the more quiet milking cattle with their
calves graze or rest in the shadow of the trees; the dogs lie
basking in the sun outside the hut; within you find the hut-keeper
quietly plaiting straw or sewing together opossum skins to serve as
a blanket, or smoking his pipe and reading some worn old fragment
of a book, his whole library. At times home rides the stockman with
three or four of his neighbours in charge of herds at other
stations, and then up blazes the wood fire on the hearth with a
fresh supply of logs; down go the quart pots in front for tea, one
for each man; and as one after another the "Irish boil" perfects
into a good sound "English boil," in goes into each a whole handful
of tea, and the bright tin pint pot for drinking out of is placed
on the top of each as it is removed back from the fire to draw,
Presently out come the damper and beef; and after a hearty meal,
the pipes are filled, and the world and all its woes are forgotten
in the jest and tale. Such is life at these stations often for
years together; its monotony only broken by the yearly muster and
branding, or by the stockman's journey to Sydney with a drove of
fat beasts for the butcher; and occasionally to some new station
with a draught of cattle when they have become too numerous for
their native run.</p>

<p>As had been arranged, my fellow-traveller left me the second day
when we reached Broughton's Creek and returned, while I proceeded
on foot. A sawyer's hut in the cedar brush, which is here very
productive, was my quarters for the night. The next day I hastened
on for the but in the Jervis's Bay gullies: but it turned out that
I did not know the lay of the brush here so well as I thought I
did; for, trying to make a short cut, I got away down by St.
George's Basin and found myself at sundown so completely bewildered
that I saw it would be best to strike up a fire and camp for the
night. I had brought no food with me, and was both hungry and weak.
However, there was no help; soon after midnight it began to blow
and rain very hard with a thick mist. I soon got up a bit of a
gunyah with the dry bark off a wind-fall tree, sufficient to turn
the worst of the rain off from me and my fire, but when day dawned
I found myself worse off than ever as to any certainty which way to
travel. The mist was so thick that I could form not the slightest
notion which way I was heading except by a sound that seemed to me
to be that of the surf on the rocks. I turned my back to that,
supposing that by so doing I should be going inland, as I must do
to reach the road. But that sound at length died away, probably by
the tide going out, and to my sore vexation and discomfort I again
found myself as night set in on the edge of St. George's Basin.
Through the twilight I saw a great open space before me, and making
sure it was one of the big swamps near the river rushed joyfully
forward; the fog was too thick to allow me to perceive the glitter
of the vast sheet of water till I came within a few feet; and then
in an instant all my hopes were gone. With downcast heart I
travelled on round the edge to my last night's camping place. Again
I lighted my fire, and again I passed the long, long hours of the
bleak and wearisome night without any refreshment but that of my
pipe. As it happened I was not short of tobacco. This was the only
alleviation of my suffering; for my hunger and weakness were really
both very great. The fog still continued on the third day, but the
rain only fell in occasional showers. As there was now scarcely a
breath of air stirring, I could not again make out the roar of the
surf. I now resolved to take the broadest of the cattle tracks up
from the low grounds, in the hope that it would lead me out into
the open forest. Over and over again that day did I go off from the
edge of the basin on one of these tracks, and as regularly did I
come back down some other to the water's brink again. They were
nothing more than the summer paths of the wild cattle down to the
cool pasture by the waterside. I was now getting thoroughly
exhausted, and had torn my clothing all to pieces in forcing my way
through the scrubs. Whenever I tried to lull my hunger with a
smoke, the pipe produced only an excessive nausea; and even the
mouthfuls of water which a craving stomach prompted me to take had
the same effect. But that which gave me the most painful feeling of
all was the recollection that the time for R &mdash;&mdash;
reaching the hut in the gullies was just up; and the consideration
what would be his astonishment and fears on not finding me there,
or any sign of my having been there. I was now in that stage of
exhaustion which is attended in some (in me always) by violent
excitement. My natural strength was gone, but a sort of unnatural
energy was come in its place. I had tried running up the
watercourses, but the ground was so mountainous that all I had
tried soon ended abruptly. Still I knew that now this was the only
probable resource; I therefore set off in as direct a line as I
could imagine parallel to the coast, determined to go on thus till
I made out some main watercourse, and then steadily run that up as
long as my strength lasted. For nearly three hours I must have been
following out this resolve without meeting with any creek of
sufficient importance to justify my fixing upon it; probably I did
not go very far, for I neither could sufficiently command my powers
to keep a true direction in the darkness (it was after sundown a
considerable time), nor could I do more than crawl very slowly
along; and I was so feeble and nervous that blind creeks of which I
should have run down and up the farther bank in half a minute at
other times, now took me five or six minutes to cross; and these
are plentiful enough in this vicinity. Far in the night as I rose
out of one of these on to the hip of a scrubby hill, there gleamed
out bright before me, not half a quarter of a mile off, the fires
of a blacks' camp; and the dogs at the same instant, attracted by
the cracking of the bush, sprang forward yelping by scores. I knew
there were none but quiet tribes here, and, filled with new
strength, was in a few minutes more among them, as heartily pleased
as ever I had been at any thing in my whole life. They gave me
plenty of baked fish and cabbage-tree, and a "bangola" of
"sugar-bag" (water sweetened with native honey), for which I
rewarded them with nearly the remainder of my tobacco&mdash;about
half a pound. There were about a hundred of them; several of them I
knew well from their coming to my hut some years before, when in
the Long-Brush, behind Kiama. They put me in one of their best
gunyahs (a sort of hut of bark, shaped much like those of the
English gypsies), and gave me two very large opossum cloaks for the
night, with many an exclamation of "<i>Poor fellow you, binghi</i>
(brother); <i>most dead you, I believe: what for you stupid like
that? what for you not fetch 'em gun and shoot 'em parrot, and
patter</i> (eat)? <i>bail boos got it chop</i> (the bush has got no
shops)." For an hour the camp was all astir with the white fellow's
adventure; the young men shouted and laughed, triumphing in their
superior faculties; the old men talked gravely and shook their
heads; and the gins, true to their sex, passed to and fro among
themselves, from fire to fire, their exclamations of pity with each
new bit of information about my mishap, as one or other of the
black fellows, by some fresh question, extracted it from me. Human
nature is the same from the throne to the gunyah. At length all
slept except myself. It was long before I could forget myself,
though I was very careful to take only a few mouthfuls of food.
When I did shut my eyes it was only to pass into a state of
delirious consciousness; my mind was even more awake than before I
slept. I walked, I ran, I flew, I swam in the air; now I was an old
man toiling along with a stick round strange corners; now I was a
black fellow springing lithely along with boomarang and wommerah
and spear; now I was hunting a whole host of mounted police
headlong through the bush and over precipices, and now they were
chasing me; now I heard the sounds of the camp around me; and now
again sweet (ay, the sweetest) voices came to me from the placid
depths of infancy. In a word, that night's sleep was one boundless,
fathomless phantasm of the most vivid realities cast into the form
of the most inconceivable fictions. For months, indeed for years
afterwards, in a minor degree, it recurred whenever my stomach was
much out of order.</p>

<p>In the morning, though dreadfully tired, stiff, and weak, I set
off under the guidance of two of the old men for the rendezvous. I
easily made them understand where I wanted to go. You can scarcely
name any particular tree in the bush but the blacks know it. This
hut they recognised immediately I described it; and I found that my
opinion of its original use was perfectly correct. They told even
the stockman's name who used to "sit down" (live) there. He had
been dead some time, or they probably would not have done so.
Instead of going all round by the road, the blacks took me a short
cut; and on my arrival I had the gratification of finding R
&mdash;&mdash; was behind his time, and not yet there. As I made
full sure it would not be much longer before he made his
appearance, we knocked up a fire in the hut, and I passed the
remainder of the time in explaining to my guides that I wished them
not to say anything to other white men of my being here. This they
promised, and they are a people with whom a promise made under such
circumstances is very rarely, if ever, broken. In my many years'
dealings with them I never knew an instance.</p>

<p>THE two blacks left me about a couple of hours before sundown,
giving me one of their tomahawks in case R &mdash;&mdash; failed to
come; also a good bundle of cabbage-tree for my supper, and an
opossum's skin cloak: these cloaks are a rare possession in the
bush. An opossum's skin is about as large as that of a cat, and
when stretched out and dried, cuts to about 15 in. by 8 or 10. Thus
dried, and with all the hair on, the blacks sew them together to
the number of from 30 to 60; white men also have learned the art;
so manufactured they make a capital protection from the weather,
either by day or night. By day they are worn as a shawl, by night
the wearer wraps them all round him, and lies down completely
enveloped. The damp of the ground penetrates them very slowly and
very slightly. I have worn one doubled through a whole day's
pouring rain without becoming wet.</p>

<p>As the sun sank behind the range I began to have misgivings
whether R &mdash;&mdash; would come, and what could have detained
him: for the blacks told me, when we reached the hut, that there
was not the slightest track of a white man's foot anywhere about:
so that it was clear he had not already been and gone away again.
At length I heard his "coo-eh" from the point of the ridge where he
would descend, and answered him by mine. He knew that as I answered
him it was because all was right, and by his coo-ehing I knew he
brought no danger with him; as the first cooeh is always a demand
for an answer, and not a caution. In five minutes he came, cracking
the bushes before him, with a pack at his back, like a
donkey&mdash;a sight I was by no means sorry to see.</p>

<p>"Well, old fellow, I 'spose you're pretty peckish? Down with
some more wood." "The smoke"&mdash;I said. "Oh! Devil a fear!
There's not a sign of the track of man or beast the only way they
could come. By the bye, how did you get here? I didn't see your
track." "With the blacks, across from St. George's Basin. It was
very nearly 'a go' with me. I got down into such a tangle of scrubs
and creeks and gullies as I should never have got clear of but for
reaching a camp of blacks; I was three days and two nights without
anything to eat." "You don't say that?" "I do, indeed." "Well, I
think you're not the first that's lost his life in that very spot.
However, cheer up, my lad!&mdash;I have some good news for you.
I've been to Bathurst since you went away. We'll have our supper
first, and then I'll tell you. You'll soon be out of this Sit down;
I'll cook: you must be pretty nigh done up. By the Lord Harry, you
look as if you'd been boarding with&mdash;(the Sydney jailer) for
three months. Be-dad, <i>I</i> could almost eat a jackass raw."
Well enough he might be hungry, for the good-hearted fellow had
knocked his horse up the night before, full forty miles away, and
had come on foot, with nearly fifty pounds weight of one thing and
another on his back, all over the mountains; and it must have been
so sludgy and wet under foot best part of the way, that an
unincumbered foot-man could have hardly taken two steps together
without slipping. Looked at in an abstract point of view, it is
quite surprising what exertions bushmen of new countries,
especially mates, will make for one another, beyond people of the
old countries. I suppose want prevailing less in the new countries
makes men less selfish, and difficulties prevailing more make them
more social and mutually helpful. R &mdash;&mdash; brought me a
good blanket, tobacco, tea, sugar, flour, beef, quart pot, and
tomahawk; besides some money in coin. Coin is very scarce in the
bush, and when I was taken I had but a few shillings about me.
I.O.U.s, and cheques, and orders are the chief current money in the
bush; and to get cash for these to any extent it is necessary to go
to some public store or licensed house of entertainment, and
presenting the paper-money in payment of the debt contracted,
obtain the balance in as much coin as the vender will give. The
four pounds in cash which he brought me, therefore, were necessary:
in case my provisions fell short, I should have to go to some hut
to try to purchase further supplies; people on farms do not like
taking orders unless they know the party presenting them, and can
make sure they are "all right." Storekeepers and publicans make but
little objection: they have so many pass through their hands that
they can hardly be much mistaken; and they are also obliged to run
some risk knowingly, for if they were not to take the current money
they would not sell their goods. And now, supposing our meal to be
finished, the pipe alight, and a good fire blazing, I shall proceed
to put the reader in possession of R &mdash;&mdash;'s "good news,"
as nearly in his own words as I can. The but felt very damp, but
could not long remain so with the fire we made up. I had indeed my
misgivings about keeping a large fire, as I knew both the light by
night, and the smoke curling up over the bush and resting in a
cloud on a still day over the spot, will often betray the
fugitive's campingplace; but as R &mdash;&mdash; assured me there
was not the slightest chance of anybody being about, I gave way. R
&mdash;&mdash;'s communication was as follows:&mdash;"The day after
you were gone, young &mdash;&mdash; (naming another white native
whom we both knew) came by with a herd of cattle. I was not at home
when he came, but he sent his man on with the cattle and waited.
When I came back, he told me he had a message for either me or you
from &mdash;&mdash;, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s stockman (this was my
prosecutor's own convict-servant). He was to tell us that Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; was about to take out a warrant on account of the
cattle, and that till he got his own cow he was milking yours. The
stockman said it was not his fault if the warrant was taken out,
for that he had tried to persuade his master it was a mistake, and
all the answer he got was, '<i>Well, then, till we get our own
cattle back again</i> WE'LL <i>make such another mistake; one cow's
milk for another's is a fair exchange</i>.' Accordingly, though he
received no more express orders about it, he had run your cow into
the milking-yard every morning since, and she had been milked, and
her calf was in the pen with the other calves all night. Further,
he said, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; knew it well enough, and so did the
people that milked; and though he might gammon that he knew nothing
about it, that was the truth. As soon as I heard this," R
&mdash;&mdash; said, "I asked young &mdash;&mdash; (the bearer of
the message) to drive Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s cow and calf, with his
herd, up to Manaroo Plains, and keep her there till we sent for
her; for I thought that would give us a chance of catching your cow
in &mdash;&mdash;'s milking-yard. I have no doubt, from what I know
of the man, that he'll go on milking her till either his own is
returned, or till she is dry. As young &mdash;&mdash; was agreeable
to let his herd pick up Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s cow in going across
the run, if it could be done so that his man would think it was an
accident, we settled it so. He rode on after his man, and told him
he should turn back and yard the cattle in our yard for the night;
and I saddled the black mare, and cut round the run like mad till I
found the cursed old brute of a cow, and kept her near hand all
night, and in the morning put her close by the road-side a little
before they turned out. They picked her up safe enough. The man
that was driving the Bathurst herd was a regular muff (booby), and
never dropped down what o'clock it was (did not detect the scheme).
However, she's now t'other side of Manaroo Plains, and you may go
and catch your cow in Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s yard, and your milk in
his pail, magistrate as he is." This may perhaps sound almost
incredible to English ears; it was by no means so to mine, who had
now been observing Australian settlers for some years. In the very
ship in which I went out there was a quarter-deck passenger, whom
the vessel had to lay-to off Dover to take on board. We heard that
he was flying from his creditors under a large amount of debt.
However, he was not long landed before he was one of the most
topping men of business in the colony; and he certainly had no
friend but the one he brought in his pocket. He must have brought
with him in this fraudulent manner a much larger sum than he owed
in England. I soon found that half the wealth in the colony stood
upon the same or similar foundations.</p>

<p>At this period the wool-trade was being cultivated very eagerly.
Hurdle-making was becoming a very common branch of labour, and was
also one of the best for a bushman. It occurred to me that it would
be easy for me to fall in with some free man who had a job of
hurdlemaking near Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s farm, and get him to take me
for a mate, and thus situated I could learn all I wanted to know at
my leisure. We immediately put this plan in force. We left the
gullies next morning, as soon as R &mdash;&mdash; had had a
sufficient rest after his heavy day's journey the day before. At
Kiâma boat-harbour we got on board one of the cedar-boats, not
without carefully ascertaining that there was both water and
provision enough, and a compass on board. I had not forgotten what
I suffered in my last trip from this place. We paid a short visit
to M &mdash;&mdash; and my mate's father; but as we considered the
police might be watching the farm in expectation of my being there,
we did not venture to stop beyond a couple of hours, for all
information of this kind is circulated among the police officers of
New South Wales. Everybody (as the saying is) knows everybody; and
my whole connexions and affairs were probably as well known to the
police as if I had furnished them with the report myself. It is one
of the commonest sayings, in relation to eluding the police, that
the colony is but one large gaol-yard. We went to the Bathurst
country again by the Curryjong Mountain, instead of by the public
government road. The way we went we had the solitude of the bush to
protect us from observation nearly all the way. Had we gone by Emu
Plains and Mount York, we must have mingled in the whole stream of
traffic betwixt Bathurst and Sydney. The public roads in New South
Wales are at first mere dray-tracks through the forest, winding
among the trees, often varying into fresh courses to escape some
fallen tree or quagmire that has made the road impassable. Then
some of the trees which are most in the way are cut down, and
sundry bridges made where the creeks are worst, though they think
nothing here of driving a dray down into what in England we should
call a deep ditch, and making the bullocks drag it up, by force of
flogging, on the other side. But at last, when the line of
communication is considered of sufficient importance, government
takes the matter into its own hands, and makes what is called "a
government road." Surveyors lay down the best course for the line,
and gangs then occupy it, felling in one unbroken line a space of
bush of many fathoms wide, and burning off the timber as they go.
Finally, where the ground needs it, it is levelled; and where
bridges are wanted they are made. The effect of these vast avenues,
particularly before the grass is worn away, and all but the mere
opening remains in its primitive and natural state, is singularly
fine and striking; perhaps the term sublime would not be too strong
to apply to the effect. In some places you may see miles along
these magnificent openings; the timber on each side is sometimes of
gigantic growth; tall regal-looking gums; black, gnarled, grim
iron-barks, or stringy-barks swathed in their soot-mantles from the
bush-fires: there, if the air be clear, and you catch sight of some
other traveller a mile away, the sense of his <i>conspicuous
littleness</i> is irresistible; and this the next act of reflection
can scarcely fail to transfer to yourself.</p>

<p>On reaching the Bathurst country, I went to a station near the
plains belonging to an Australian, a friend of R &mdash;&mdash;'s.
After spending a couple of days in Bathurst township he returned to
me, having succeeded in finding a hurdle-maker who already had a
job. He had heard of several, and had selected the one nearest to
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s sheep stations. These were situated in the
&mdash;&mdash; mountains. As yet this tract of country, although so
near Bathurst, was very little settled. Indeed it remains so to
this day. A wilderness of vast rocky ranges, scantily watered,
almost impervious to the common modes of conveyance, and to be
penetrated for the purposes of carriage in most places only by
pack-bullocks or horses, it is generally considered unfit for
anything but pastoral purposes. To the pencil of the artist, I
imagine, it would afford some of the richest scenery in the world.
I recollect, at one spot where a road had been made, standing and
looking down the appalling and precipitous descent. Where I stood,
if a dray had slipped sideways only three feet it must have gone
down the sidelong declivity, which became steeper every foot, till
it drew the bullocks after it, and all have gone "by the run"
together. I felt as if I were as near to the sky as to the earth,
or rather the world below seemed more unattainable than the world
above. In a corner of these mountains where the river rushes point
blank against a precipice and there checked turns off at a right
angle along the foot of the range that has impeded it, all the way
travelling under the perpetual shadows of immense river oaks that
overhang it on either side, green and profuse and impenetrable by
the sun in winter and in summer alike, my new mate the hurdle-maker
had fixed himself. He was a sturdy, gray-headed, old man from the
north of Ireland; a convict, but still a Presbyterian; combining a
singular sternness with an unconquerable cheerfulness; a man who
did a great deal of work, more by long hours than by speed, who
never seemed tired, and never was an instant behind time at his
meals; he had been an overseer, but lost the office because he
would not have men flogged, and had invariably for many years past
drank all his earnings every fifteen or eighteen months: then on
coming out of his spree, and finding himself penniless, and
suffering from the blue devils almost to madness, he would resolve
again, and again lay by his hoard to be in like manner subjected to
the periodical fit of dissipation. Although I was now only second
in command, and one does not very easily fall into the whims and
put up with the blunders of an inferior workman, I must say I liked
the old man very much. There was a natural conscientiousness about
him which commanded my confidence. There is a great deal of this
mutual regard and trust engendered by two men working thus together
in the otherwise solitary bush; habits of mutual helpfulness arise,
and these elicit gratitude, and that leads on to regard. Men under
these circumstances often stand by one another through thick and
thin; in fact it is a universal feeling that a man ought to be able
to trust his own mate in anything. Our hut was in the little stony
flat in the angle of the river; behind us rose rough stony ranges,
before us rolled the river, and along the banks grew the fine oak
timber he was splitting for the hurdle bars, heads, and braces. Not
above two miles from us, up one of the creeks that run from the
surrounding hills into the river, at a spot close to us, was a
sheep station where Mr. &mdash;&mdash; had two flocks of sheep. And
here it will be best to explain why I did not take a job in the
vicinity myself, but struck in with another man as his mate. Had I
taken a job myself I must have given my own name, and possibly
should have been by this means recognised as the individual who
bought D &mdash;&mdash;'s cattle; Mr. &mdash;&mdash; would have
been put in possession of the information, and instead of getting
the evidence I wanted, I should have been immediately arrested.
Again, I have heretofore mentioned how almost impossible it is to
travel in New South Wales without a passport of some kind or other;
that which I was depending on was a mere certificate from a
gentleman in the commission of the peace who knew me, that I had
come free to the colony. From the constant practice among settlers
of ill-using free men in point of rations, it often happens that
men run away leaving jobs half finished; in other cases it is the
consequence of a dishonest endeavour on the part of the labourer,
after having largely overdrawn his account, to get rid of the debt;
they call working out such a debt, <i>riding the dead horse</i>.
The upshot has been that settlers, especially about Bathurst and
Hunter's River, where the usage of men is worst, have got into the
habit of requiring men with whom they agree for work to leave these
documents in their hands, as they know they cannot travel without
them. Now it was because it did not suit me at this time to be
fettered in this manner, that I would not take work in such a way
as would virtually fix me to one spot till my employer would give
me up my <i>pass</i>. As it was some months before I thought fit to
leave this quarter, a body of facts arrange themselves into this
period of my narrative which have given occasion to the title of
the present chapter, and which I shall now endeavour to set forth
as succinctly as possible, and yet fully, because I am sure they
are not generally known in Sydney itself, much less in the parent
country. Up a creek which fell into the river close to our hut, on
a fine swelling bare hill amidst a tract of forest which had here
become almost tableland, stood the sheep station of Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; which I have already mentioned. He had many others
in various parts of these mountains, and others again in other
parts of the colony. It consisted of two yards side by side, made
of heavy boughs piled and interwoven, or rather of one large
enclosure (say 120 ft. by 40) divided by a cross-fence of the same
sort into two smaller ones of 60 by 40 each: the two gates at the
two farthest ends being each an old hurdle. The interstices at all
quarters were such that a warregal (bush-dog) not only could have
crept through, but might have run and jumped through. On the upper
side of this yard stood the hut, an enclosure of about 10 feet by
14, made with split slabs, and having a roof of bark. This hut was
one large apartment, and had ground for the floor: at one end was
the fire-place on the hearth, at the other the shepherds used to
sleep, spreading their beds on sheets of bark just lifted off the
ground by having logs of wood about 8 inches thick and 3 feet long
laid underneath, one at the head, the other at the feet. This hut
stood at about 12 or 14 feet distance from the upper side of the
yard. On the lower side of the yard, heaped against the fence and
extending a good way downward from it, was the mass of sheep-dung
which had been by degrees thrown out in cleaning the yard, for it
is part of the hut-keeper's duty to sweep the yards every morning
immediately the sheep are out. At the station were two shepherds
who took out the sheep over the adjacent hills by day, and a
hut-keeper was responsible for them by night. The flocks themselves
were each about 800 strong, fully twice as many as a shepherd can
manage in a thickly timbered and mountainous country. The master
grumbles if the flock is not allowed to spread; he says the
shepherd must be keeping them together by severe dogging, and that
running so close they cannot fill their bellies; for this, if the
shepherd is a free man, he will often refuse to pay him his wages;
if he is a prisoner, he takes him before some other sheep-holding
settler in the commission of the peace and flogs him. On the other
hand, if the shepherd suffers the flock to spread, in these
mountainous runs especially, they get into creeks and hollows; and
he loses sight of them and leaves them behind; or a native dog
sneaks in among them, and, as it is the habit of these animals to
bite as many as they can before beginning to prey, 20, 30, 50 get
bitten, most of them mortally, before the shepherd sees or hears
the stir and comes to their rescue. By this time the whole flock
perhaps is scattered in all directions by the panic to which sheep
are so liable. For these mishaps again, if the shepherd is free,
the master refuses to pay his wages, and tells him to go to law and
get them if he can; which he knows, in nine cases out of ten, the
man will not do from want of confidence in the administration of
justice: if he is a prisoner he flogs him. And this flogging
answers two purposes, he supposes (though, as I am to show, he is
sorely mistaken): he imagines that it spurs the man to a sort of
nervous and extra-natural watchfulness from terror of the lash; and
then again he knows (for in this particular he is by no means
mistaken) that this intimation of ill demeanor will impede the man
with the authorities in getting his ticket of leave to work for
himself; and so he shall retain for some time longer than he
otherwise could a servant whose cost is not half what he must give
a free man. But though he can in this arbitrary manner stop a free
man's balance of wages when his term of service is up, the free man
still has this point on his side&mdash;that he can keep on drawing
goods level with his earnings through the whole period, and so
leave no balance to be cheated of. Yet again, on the other hand,
the settler charges just double the Sydney cash prices; so that in
this way the man really gives his master half his earnings to get
the other half. And thus after all, as the settlers say in their
representations to the legislature, free and bond labour do really
stand on about level terms. The convict is only allowed necessaries
equal to half what the free man demands; but the extra amount
payable to the free man can either be stopped by a simple refusal
to pay it if left to accumulate, or if the man, in fear of being
cheated, draws it in goods from the settler's store, the total will
still be reduced to one half by selling to him at double the prices
(and often more than treble) which the goods cost in Sydney. So
that the gist of the case is just this:&mdash;The New South Wales
sheepmaster throws the grand and insuperable risk (in such a
country) of his trade on his labourer's shoulders: if bond, the man
pays for it by having right only to half wages; if free, by being
cheated out of half what he agrees for. And let the point I started
from be here recollected, that all this wrong is mainly founded on
another&mdash;that of making each man do two men's work; of giving
men 800 sheep where 400 would be a full flock to give fair play to.
It may be replied&mdash;How can masters be so blind to their own
interests? That I cannot say. I am merely relating facts, and how
they tell on the labourer. I have heard large flock-holders who
were of liberal character laugh at the folly of the thing as
regards the masters' interests, and condemn it as regards the men's
rights; but I never heard one illiberal, avaricious man, which
certainly two thirds of the sheep-masters are, say one word about
it. When I came to have flocks of my own, if ever I hinted at the
subject to such persons they always silenced it directly. I never
could yet procure an explicit sentence out of them respecting it,
excepting some such as these: "Oh, the d &mdash;&mdash; d
scoundrel! he can mind them all if he likes." "D&mdash;n him, he'll
want a donkey next to <i>ride</i> after his flock." "Do not Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; and Mr. &mdash;&mdash; run as large flocks on as
close a run, and are not they magistrates?"</p>

<p>With this insight into the connexion between shepherds and
sheepmasters in New South Wales, it will be no matter for
astonishment to the reader that it should be my next duty to
describe this class of the rural population as miserable and
degraded to an extreme. Besides the two shepherds there was at this
station of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s also a hut keeper or watchman. To
him it belonged to watch the sheep by night and the hut by day. He
was a prisoner, and if he had either suffered the hut to be robbed
by day or the sheep to be attacked by the native dogs at night, he
would have been flogged. I say he <i>would have been</i>, because
his predecessor, a prisoner also, <i>had been</i>. Perhaps it is a
peculiarity of the office to enable a man to do without
sleep,&mdash;perhaps there is something in being a convict that
deprives him of the right to any, as it does of many other rights;
perhaps there is some grand reformatory experiment carrying on of
which this is a particular, and of which we are not permitted to
know anything publicly. This fellow (for really I have not the
impression on my mind of his being a man) had been flogged over and
over and over again; and, I verily believe, for nothing else than
that naturally he was remarkably stupid and gruff. He was in short
just a type of a class of individuals you may meet with in New
South Wales at every step; men perfectly crushed by being flogged
month after month and year after year for a natural stupidity and
abruptness which continually betrays them into blunders, and then
by the manner they reply to reproof making them seem insolent and
their blunders wilful. At the same time let me be well
understood&mdash;no person of any discrimination, or whose
penetration of character passes beneath the surface, would fall
into such a misconception; yet, superintended as they generally are
by overseers who have crept up from their own ranks by cunning and
sycophancy, and because they would do any dirty work rather than
submit to bodily toil, it is only just such a result as might be
looked for. The effect of this monstrous and irrational treatment
of this convict had been that an almost maniac spitefulness at
times took possession of him; and I assure the reader (morally
frightful as it may seem) that this very kind of feeling, induced
and fostered by the atrocious severities to which they have been
and to a still serious extent <i>are</i> subjected, may be
constantly detected among the lower order of the labourers, but
especially among the pastoral class. This poor fellow had been
fifteen years in bondage, and I suppose had never passed a year of
that time without (let me be permitted to use a phrase not thought
by any means too expressive to be regularly used at the tables of
gentlemen in the colony)&mdash;without his master "making him a
present of a red shirt" (a scarified back). Obliged to sweep the
yards, get wood and water for the hut, and go into the farm on
various errands by day, he usually slept by night. To do this,
however, he was obliged to keep three large dogs, whose vigilance
should serve instead of his own for the protection of the sheep by
night; and, as dogs cannot live on air or grass, this involved
practices which are next to be described.</p>

<p>At by far the greater proportion of sheep stations in the colony
the practice of feloniously killing the owner's sheep goes on to
greater or less extent; and plenty of the owners know it and wink
at it; others do not, but would prosecute and transport the men if
they could adduce proof of it. Those who connive at it reason thus:
"Well, the men must be fed and so must the dogs, or the work cannot
be done; and it is a bad precedent to give them as much meat as
they require, because that will lead to a universal and
irresistible custom. I had better let them take it, and seem not to
know anything about it." But let it not be forgotten that this
often betrays men into practices which ultimately cause them to be
retransported. I speak positively on these points, because I have
considered them so long, having for years seen the practices I am
describing whilst a working-hand and in the secrets of the class. I
could now name one of the largest sheepholders in the colony whom I
saw come into a hut that I stopped at in travelling, where a newly
slaughtered sheep was hanging up, which he well knew had no
business there; he nearly ran against before he saw it; but when he
saw it, he deliberately turned round before all hands and, with the
gravest face imaginable, <i>would not see it</i>. If he had, he
must have transported some of his best men.</p>

<p>At Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s station this sheep-stealing system was
going on; and no wonder. First, the dogs must be fed; and when for
many days there was no death in the flock from natural causes, how
but by slaughtering could the meat be had? Then again the
ration-meat was such as I shall hardly be believed when I describe.
The animals for rations were ordered to be taken out of one of the
flocks at the station. In killing order they should have weighed
from 50lbs. to 60lbs.; they really ran only from 25lbs. to 30lbs.
Of course they were nothing but bags of bones. I have seen the lamp
put inside one after it was killed and hung up and skinned, and the
very form of the flame could be seen as plainly through the skin
and flesh betwixt the ribs as through a piece of wet parchment. In
short, there was no meat on the bones beyond little scraps filling
up angles or sparely spread over the gristly parts of the muscle on
the muscular portions of the frame. I think it would not be an
exaggeration to say that <i>to every ten pounds of bone there were
not more than two pounds of fleshy integument</i>. But Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; still gave the shepherds and hut-keeper only the
stated number of pounds of meat which should have been allowed if
the animals had been in full condition. In short, instead of a
ration of 8lbs. of meat with 2lbs. of bone, they had 8lbs. of bone
and 2lbs. of meat. He had been remonstrated with, but not a pound
more would he give. Of course the men helped themselves.</p>

<p>I recollect going up to their hut when I had been hurdle-making
about three months, and they had come to know me well enough to
have no fear of any foul play from me. It was night, and the dogs,
who had been starved for several days, had just got hold of the
entrails of a sheep the men had been killing "<i>on the cross</i>,"
so that they did not hear me till I came close up to the hut, and
then all rushed barking at me in a mob. In an instant one of the
shepherds sprung out of the hut; he had no need to tell me why, for
by the light of the fire that blazed in the hut I already saw the
naked sheep hanging to one of the rafters. I burst out laughing,
saying. "Old chap, you're all to the good yet." The man was a freed
man, an old soldier; transported probably for some merely military
offence, such as desertion, involving no great moral turpitude, but
now quite brutalised by the severities he had endured. His reply
was, "I thought it was &mdash;&mdash; (the overseer), and if it had
been, I would have knocked him on the head and put him into a
hollow log before he should have <i>lagged</i> (transported)
me."</p>

<p>Again, some time after this, I knew them to lose some sheep at
this station; they had omitted counting the sheep in and out of the
yards through rainy weather for some days, and could not tell
whether they had been lost by day or night. To supply the loss when
discovered, the shepherd used regularly to go every night to a
station four miles off, where he was on friendly terms, and fetch
home a sheep on his back. I never knew how he procured the sheep;
whether he cleverly managed to steal it on coming away, or whether
it was a made up concern between him and one of the shepherds at
that station thus to betray the hut-keeper. Probably the two
shepherds had made it up between them in the bush; and the shepherd
who was giving (perhaps selling) the other his sheep, used to keep
his fellow shepherd and hut-keeper "in a tow-line" whilst the
animal was stolen. However, he made good the count of his flock in
this way.</p>

<p>Meantime, however, for one thing or another, this luckless
hut-keeper of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s was flogged in the five months I
lived near the station no less than three times. The last time but
one I was at the station when he found he was a sheep short, and
but for my persuasion he would certainly have taken the bush; and
dogged as he was, have probably done something for which he would
have been hung. But about a month after this, one of the
shepherds&mdash;the man was still a convict&mdash;lost a lot of his
sheep. I relate the matter just as I saw it as a caution to
masters. The hut-keeper counted in the sheep at the gate, the
shepherd and his dog keeping them up. When the last was in, and the
shepherd was turning away, the hut-keeper said, "Mikkey, you are
twenty-seven short." "Be d &mdash;&mdash; d to it! no?" said
Mikkey. "I tell you, you are." "Count 'em again." Again they were
counted; again they were short. Again they were put into the yard
and the shepherd counted them out himself. "Twenty-seven short!" he
said; "I may as well be flogged for a hundred as for these;" and he
positively put the dogs of the station on them and sent them
scampering in all directions through the bush. "There," he said to
the hutkeeper, "go and tell &mdash;&mdash; [the overseer,] I've
lost my flock. I shall go in and have my supper." And he then
really left them ranging the bush till he had had his supper. The
messenger to the farm of course did not tell what his hutmate had
done, but only reported the flock lost. It was not till next day
that the whole of the sheep that remained were got together; the
flock was then nearly fifty short. The carcasses of these were
lying in all quarters, dead, or yet alive and frightfully mangled
by the warregals. I relate this circumstance because I have known
the same thing done in several instances, and believe it to be
common. I recollect an old shepherd, who had been kept in bondage
many years, telling me that he could have saved hundreds of sheep
in his time from death in one way and another, but would not,
because his master flogged him whether he was right or wrong. He
saved them when their death would throw suspicion on him, and let
them die when it would not. I was struck at the time with the
singular coolness with which the old fellow told me this. Again, I
knew a settler near the Hunter River, who flogged for every sheep
lost; at last the men took to dogging <i>the whole flock</i> out
into the bush whenever they lost <i>one</i>. It quite quieted the
gentleman; some inkling of the plain truth reached him; he changed
his system, left off flogging, and became one of the best masters
in the colony. Within two years afterwards his people actually
risked their lives in an attack of bushrangers on the farm to
protect him, his family, and his property. I am sure every person
who reflects will, after these statements, perceive that two-thirds
of the crimes of the lower classes of the colony are the fruits of
seed sown by the masters' own hands. It is quite absurd to expect a
change in the one class without the previous change in the other.
The gentleman of whom I have related the anecdote on p. 335 is one
of the best masters as he is also one of the most prosperous in the
colony. Had he belonged to the opposite section, the upshot would
have been widely different. Several men would have been
transported, and he would have sustained a retribution through his
property secret, long, and imperceptible but complete.</p>

<p>It has often struck me that there is no class to which the
philanthropy of Britain could be so happily applied as to these
isolated shepherds. A very large proportion of them can read, and
where they can get books are very fond of reading; whilst the
influence that reading exercises upon them is as beneficial as it
is evident wherever the experiment is made. Some years after this
period I supplied some stations in the way of loan with such books
of my own as the men thought fit to come and fetch out of a lot I
had selected as fit for them and brought up the country. I did not
lose a single volume; and the effect on the men's personal
behaviour was markedly beneficial. Indeed there seems something at
once iniquitous and hypocritical in taking these culprits out of
their native land, and removing them from a state of society where
instruction and moral remonstrance and religious appeal constantly
reach the very lowest, only to send them into the far bush, where
no holy voice warns them of the awful error of their way; where the
soul is left to fester in the concentrated pollution that had
already infected it, without a single relieving idea, even from
books; and daily exposed to the exciting influence of the unclad
woman of the bush, who, alas! has learnt but too well the language,
the tone, the caress of the seducer. To me, as an individual, the
mission to the aborigines of New South Wales has always seemed a
sort of iniquity when it overlooks this great section of most
hopeful material. Great numbers of these poor creatures have been
hurried on to their degraded condition by the pressure of want in
the parent country, and by not having time to reflect: but now
amidst the still wilderness they would reflect, if a little
stimulus to reflection were supplied. The voice of the religious
teacher would often be humbly welcomed; broken hearts will take in
Christian consolation, when there is still enough of steel about
them to defy the gaol, the manacle, and the cats. On the contrary,
all the thanks we get from the black native for attempting to
introduce our religion into his tribes is the laugh of derision, or
the silence of a yet deeper scorn. "You!" he says, "you who tie one
another up, and flog one another within an inch of life, for some
little hasty word; you who begrudge one another enough to eat; you
who deprive me of my hunting grounds, only to increase possessions
for mere possessions' sake; you, a people divided into two classes,
the one hateful and the other contemptible, the tyrant and the
slave; you who keep, and clothe, and train men to human slaughter
as a trade&mdash;you teach me to be better!&mdash;Me who walk the
forest free, who appropriate no more than I need, who never fight
but as a deeply injured man, who would not lay your bloody lash
upon my dog, much less my brother; who 'in wrath remember mercy,'
and give even the public culprit, against whom I am to direct my
spear at the command of the tribe, his shield to defend himself
with;&mdash;YOU convert ME! preposterous!" Oh! that mankind would
but have common sense. One of its first undertakings would
certainly be to rectify the shameful errors of our own condition of
society, and ameliorate the condition of our own countrymen by
those plentiful means which present themselves: and in such
direction of our benevolent energies, surely one of the first
objects reached would be the class I have now described. At present
their state is alike awful to themselves and shameful to us. Full
two-thirds of all these thousands are in the lamentable condition
here represented; a few of the rest are something better off; and
the final remainder who have good masters may be said (but for its
irreligion) to spend a tolerably pleasant life. With plenty of
food, the prospect and experience of generally fair treatment,
light labour, and leisure, which they make use of in plaiting and
sewing straw hats, or making opossum cloaks, and various other
harmless and profitable occupations; with perhaps a master or
superintendent who will lend them books to while away the long
sunny hours of the Australian day as they wander on with their
flocks from tree-shadow to treeshadow, their time may be said to
pass pleasantly and even in some measure profitably as regards the
higher attributes of their being. I will close the description with
a single fact for the consideration of the benevolent and pious. I
lent four men Bibles in the space of about twelve months: of those
four, in one I saw no change; another brought the book back to me,
signifying that it was impossible to conform to its requirements;
the two others, both men who were considered "out-andouters," who
had remained untamed by much punishment, after I had observed them
for some weeks reading with the deepest attention, appeared to have
so far comprehended the grand doctrine of Divine Affection for our
race as to have melted beneath it like the rugged glacier beneath
the sunbeam. Their manners were altered, their very features seemed
humanized, and they seemed to have become elevated by the presence
within them of some inscrutable instinct into a common region with
myself; and when I left these two men behind me, and especially one
of them who had been the worst, I felt as if I were leaving two
brothers, not a pair of violent ruffians as they had been but a few
months before: one of them wanted to buy the Bible I had lent him,
at any rate. It is needless to say that when I found it had become
such a spring of comfort, and thus of elevation, and thus again of
virtue, I was only too glad to make him a present of the
volume.</p>

<p>Five months were at length elapsed, and their period brought the
completion of our job. I had obtained some little time earlier all
the information I wanted, but delayed to use it till I had a
settlement for my work, lest if affairs should take such a turn as
I did not wish (or indeed expect), I should have to leave my
balance behind me. I had several times gone to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s
milking-yard, for I was not personally known at his farm, and had
seen my own cow in his bale, and the milk carried into his dairy.
My mate, to whom, as soon as I found out his character, I confided
the whole affair, had also gone on the same errand with the like
success. We had got acquainted with Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s stockman
(the man who sent me the message to my own station), but without
telling him who he was talking to, and had led the conversation in
a direction which enabled my mate to ask him one day, "Wasn't that
one of D &mdash;&mdash;'s cows, that chap that sold his cattle and
run away out of the colony, that I saw among your milking cattle
the other day?" "Yes: that cow belongs to a man in the New Country;
he bought those cattle of D &mdash;&mdash;, and when he drove them
across to the New Country he took one of our cove's and left that;
indeed he took two head. When this one calved, the cove told me to
pen up the calf and milk her till we got our own. I believe there's
a warrant out about it, but I'm not sure." A second and a third
time the conversation was purposely renewed when some freemen at
work in the neighbourhood were at our hut. I had, therefore, plenty
of evidence both as to the milking of the cow and as to what
account the stockman always gave about it; to this was added other
intelligence of an equally available and yet more unequivocal
character, which it would be too prolix for me to explain here, as
it involves a lengthy history of some years' previous date. And
lastly, I became acquainted with the fact that there were no less
than three among Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s convict servants whom he was
preventing by sheer intimidation from looking after their tickets
of leave.</p>

<p>As soon as my mate had settled for his job and given me the
balance coming to me, I dressed myself &mdash;&mdash; it was a
bright summer morning &mdash;&mdash; and marched straight to Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;'s farm; it was about nine in the morning when I
arrived, and he was at breakfast. The servant came out to inquire
who I was and what I wanted. "A person who has some particular
business with Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, and will wait till he is at
leisure." After the lapse of half an hour, for he was not a man who
hurried himself, out he came.</p>

<p>"Well, my man, is it you that wants to see me?"&mdash;" If you
are the gentleman to whom that stockyard belongs (pointing), where
I see a cow of mine that has just been milked, yes."</p>

<p>"A cow of yours? and pray what cow is that? who are you,
sir?"&mdash;"Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, I am not a man to be bamboozled;
drop all this sort of thing if you please, though if you prefer my
talking loud I'll talk loud enough for your whole farm to hear
me."</p>

<p>He looked at me, and whether his "bounce" merely gave way, or
whether he only just then recollected and appreciated the actual
condition of things, I cannot say; but his whole face twitched
spasmodically, every feature seemed pulling a different way, and he
was alternately red and pale.</p>

<p>"You know, sir," I said, "very well that <i>my</i> milk has been
going into your dairy for months back; that your drays have taken
<i>my</i> cheese to Sydney; that <i>my</i> money is now in your
pocket. The fact of my cow having been so long milked by you I can
prove by half a score of people, your own men, and witnesses I have
from time to time brought to the yard purposely to verify the fact;
and no one who has a grain of common sense will believe that you
could have made such a mistake about just that particular cow of
mine that answers to the one you have lost, with this fact to help
his judgment, that you have a warrant out for me about it."</p>

<p>It was impossible for a few moments to tell what course he meant
to take or what part he meant to play. He was notoriously a man who
usually bounced his way through everything; still he was a man of
strong penetration and clear understanding. As a magistrate he was
liked much beyond the average; and prisoners under other settlers
when brought before him used generally to say he gave them fairer
play than most of the other members of the bench. But one vice
poisoned all his better qualities on his own farm&mdash;his
covetousness. I was half in fear that it would still be an awkward
job to settle; for he was turning away and getting into an attitude
when some other thought seemed to come over him, and he stopped.
The facts were too much for him: we had got into a common medium,
plain, simple, every-day sense; my position was the best, and he
could not shut his eyes to it. Commanding himself as well as he
could and putting on one of his most familiar smiles, he said,
"Well, there's no great harm done. I suppose you have been milking
my cow; it's all been an accident, I suppose; and the exchange is
no robbery." I was just about to point out to him that he had
inadvertently used the very expression that convicted him, for that
he had said this to his stock-man "before the fact," when I happily
recollected that it would betray the poor fellow and almost surely
get him flogged and persecuted as long as he was on the farm. Of
course I checked myself; and the feeling also arose&mdash;why
should I irritate him? My object was attained, and I ought to let
"well enough" alone. I therefore said, "I wish you to understand,
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, that I no sooner found out that beasts of yours
had run into my herd than I drove them out, and I have witnesses to
prove it." He now thought he was going to lose his cow and steer
really, and inquired eagerly if I did not know where they were.
"When I drove them out of my herd," I said, "there was a lot of
cattle going to Manaroo, on the road; it's very likely they may be
up there; I saw nothing of them afterwards, and if they had not
joined that herd, they would most likely have come back; I should
think you had better look for them up there." This was murder
itself: to have to send a stockman all the way up to Manaroo for
his own whilst he was obliged to hand me over mine out of his yard.
So that he had lost mine, and could only obtain his own with a
great deal of trouble. And I have often observed the same thing:
the profoundest cunning turning out in the end to be the perfection
of folly. However, he got very cleverly out of the scrape; at the
same time his expedient just suited me as well as himself. He said,
"I'll tell you what I'll do. I see it's been all a mistake; but
mine are the best cattle." "Yes," I said, "but you've been milking
mine, and that makes the difference again the other way." "Well,
say we're level-handed, and I'll make a chop with you." "Very
good," I said, "but what about the warrant?" "I'll get it
cancelled." "I must see it destroyed myself." "Agreed on; you can
go down to my huts and stop till I come back from the
settlement."</p>

<p>And now it was my turn to "whip the cat." I never heard of Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; getting into such a hank before; and I knew his
haughty soul would not brook it now very pleasantly. His character
was that he always made good his way by ability and decision; and I
doubted whether, if he gave the matter a second thought, he would
not find some means of turning the tables on me. All the while he
was gone, therefore, I was in alternate expectation of seeing him
bring a constable back with him; and attempts to reason myself into
the conviction that he was snared too tight in his own net to
venture such a step. The latter was the case: he came back about
three o'clock in the afternoon, brought the warrant with him
halfworn to ribbons (by the chief constable in his cherished hope,
I have no doubt, of one day meeting with and paying me out for the
scene at the stockyard, making it his pocket companion ever since
it came back from the Goulburn Plains office), and cut off the
signature and destroyed it in my presence. Five minutes more
sufficed for us to interchange documents transferring the cattle;
and I walked out of his parlour and straight off his farm as well
pleased as ever I was in my life. He however took care, in writing
out the one for me to sign and himself to keep, to word it so as to
make it supposable that he had been retaining my cattle
accidentally; but when he wrote one and signed it for me to keep,
he left that part entirely out. I could not help myself, as he got
his before he gave me mine. If he should ever see this and still be
keeping the document, much good may it do him. Of course, this
public history of the transaction will much detract from its value,
and he will accept my permission to make such further use of it as
he may conceive desirable. When I got back to my mate, he was so
overjoyed that he made me stand a bottle of rum in celebration of
it. However, we said nothing about it to the men at the station or
on Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s farm; and as the old man now went with me,
I suppose nothing further was ever said about it in that part of
the country; though as long as he stopped with me (some years) we
often had a yarn about it ourselves.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter XVII. The Convict's
Hut.</h2>

<p class="newspaper">Description of night passed in one of the worst class while
travelling&mdash;Unsuccessful attempt to rob me&mdash;Magistrates'
farms&mdash;Flogging before the missionary's house at Wellington
Valley</p>

<p>IN making my way across the country between Bathurst and my own
station an incident occurred which, displaying as it does another
section of Australian life, it will not be inappropriate to
describe. In making a short cut, I had to cross a tract of country
very sterile and very little occupied. Part of the directions given
me at the station I started from were, to go over a certain ridge,
through an ironbark forest on the other side, and so till I came to
a main creek; and then either up or down the creek as the sheep
tracks and water holes might indicate, until I came to a station:
stop at that station for the night, and next day finish the
distance, which was too much for one day. But I was to take care of
anything I did not want to lose, for it was one of &mdash;&mdash;'s
stations (a justice of the peace for the territory); and his men
were one combined gang of robbers. And here I would carefully state
that such directions as these are very uncommon in the colony, as
is the need of them. Where they occur they may be traced with the
clearness of cause and effect to the master's character. The men
are stinted to a point at which their powers of endurance fail, and
they then become thieves of the most reckless sort. The common laws
of hospitality and fair play that so very strongly control the
class are renounced professedly by them. "We don't want to steal,"
they say, "but we will not starve: if there is to be no alternative
for us but either to starve or steal&mdash;well then, we'll steal
from our own brother." And accordingly they carry out their
principle to the fullest extent. The whole body steal from
strangers; and the strongest among themselves from the weaker; till
the final clique is a knot of some three, or four, or five ruffians
who terminate their course by being sent to a penal settlement, or
hanged, or shot by the police in the bush. This was just the sort
of gang among whom I had here to run the ordeal. And it happened
that I had something which I did not want to lose. I had in my
pocket a number of the current checks and orders of the country of
considerable amount, and about half-a-crown in silver and copper.
This latter I did not mind losing; it was only a fair set off
against the night's entertainment if all came to all; but my pieces
of paper I did not feel inclined to part with. Still I should have
settled the matter otherwise altogether, by camping in the bush a
couple of miles before I got to the station, though without water,
had I known to what a length the risk extended. This station was
about midway from the head-station where the rations are served out
every Saturday afternoon; so that in going and coming the hut was a
sort of house-of-call for all hands; and this was the very day,
Saturday. About sundown I came upon the creek, and on looking about
judged that the hut would be found below that spot, which was
right; for it is singular what tact the bush-traveller acquires in
his judgments in points of this sort. My first thought was now to
secure my orders; this I did by taking them all out of a small tin
box in which they were, excepting only one that I knew was bad; and
then taking off my jacket and laying them on the wristband of my
shirt, and rolling the shirt sleeve with them in it thus, close up
to the shoulder. The other shirt sleeve I rolled up in like manner,
slung my jacket over my shoulder, left the coin to rattle in my
trowsers' pocket, and went on. There was not a human creature about
the station. The shepherds had not yet returned with their flocks;
and the hut-keeper was gone in for the messes. I wandered about and
examined the place, as indicative of its occupants; and indicative
it was to a considerable degree. There were two mangy emaciated
skeleton puppies smothering themselves in the embers and ashes of
the fire-place. The clothing lying on the berths was but a lot of
the most squalid rags. There was not the sign of even a crust of
bread; but there appeared no lack of bones outside. The cooking
utensils were all over the floor, which seemed never to have been
swept. And there was neither door nor shutter. First came home one
shepherd, with his flock, then the other; both looking as sulky as
hungry men generally look. The one of them bade me good evening,
the other did not. By and bye a considerable time after dark the
hut-keeper came with the rations; it was a fortnight's mess, and
would weigh, salt and all, about ninety-four or ninety-six pounds;
he had carried it nearly eleven miles. His first occupation was to
curse the two old men for not having a good fire; such is the
spirit which too pinching misery mostly engenders. He was a smart
chap, but as ruffianly-looking as could be desired. However, he
bade me good evening; in a few minutes he had a blazing fire, and
put down the quart pots with water in, for they were allowed <i>an
ounce of tea</i> each per week. When this is the case men make a
couple of good pots of tea and have done with it for the rest of
the week. Some mutton chops were soon in the pan; and these done,
cakes were fried in the fat they yielded. They then set to and had
their tea, inviting me. Not needing to carry my own stock beyond
the hut, as I should be where I was welcome for a week by next day
noon, I put it on the piece of bark which was put down on the floor
for a table and joined them; it was at least three times the
quantity of each article that I was using of theirs. I mention this
only because there is a general and very proper feeling among
bushmen that one ought not, where stations are so miserably
stinted, to use any of their provision without leaving a complete
equivalent. Long before we were done, in came a couple more
hut-keepers of stations further out, and these also made tea and
cooked; then came a lot of four or five more; and still another and
another, until there were thirteen or fourteen of us. Among others
came two free men, mates, who were splitting stuff for a new
station a few miles farther along the creek. These brought with
them two half-gallon bottles of rum; of course it soon began to be
served out. Next came out the cards, for there is hardly a station
where these are not to be found; some men carry a pack in their
pocket wherever they go, and amuse themselves with them whenever
they can. Singing followed: songs they were, such as the reader
would not thank me for transcribing. As the evening wore on, the
tide of carousal deepened, and truly as it deepened it darkened.
One man told how, some years before, when he was at Port Macquarie,
a penal settlement of the most severe sort, he and two others had
taken the bush and tried to make their way along the coast to
Sydney, had got lost among the intricacies of that broken coast,
exhausted their provisions, and were on the point of starving, when
they met with a solitary black, whom they killed with his own
tomahawk; and after their cannibal "feed," each cut off a limb and
brought it on his shoulder for future supply. But all died in the
mountains except this man, who at length, preferring any punishment
to such sufferings as he had been enduring, gave himself up at the
Coal River. It is impossible to determine whether this story was
true or false; but I heard it told with my own ears, and if it
shows nothing else, it shows how depraved men must have become who
can relate or listen to such things as very good jokes, and as the
ground of a claim to the admiration of those around them. Another,
quite a young lad, related that he had that day seen at the farm
one of the last new hands that had been sent up from Sydney convict
barracks; that this new hand, also quite a youngster, was at the
Euryalus hulk, in England, along with him, and had almost made "a
stiff 'un" of him. For that he (this new hand), and three or four
more of the biggest and strongest boys, used to "keep pigs," as it
was there called; that is to say, they used to take away all their
food from the little boys, and using the best, throw them back the
offal (potato peelings, gristle, crusts), which they called feeding
their pigs: and this had gone on without his daring to say a word
about it, until medical skill could scarcely recover him. Another
told, that when he was in an iron gang, employed in making the road
over the Blue Mountains, at one period the work was so severe and
the rations given by government so short, that hardly a man in the
gang had a bit after Wednesday night; so that there were Thursday,
Friday, and half of Saturday to be passed without food: and that
the work must be done, food or no food, or there was the triangles
for it. Their only resource was to elude the camp sentries whenever
they could, and go on the forage. Sometimes they managed to rob a
dray; sometimes he had gone 12 miles and back before daylight to
steal a little bag of growing maize; and once the whole gang had
been superbly feasted from the carcass of a working bullock, which
had died on the road side, and was so putrescent when those who
went had cut their lots of flesh off it, that they could hardly
carry it home. I imagine this was the secret of "the whole gang"
coming in for a share. The prize owners found a small share
sufficed for their appetites, and they gave the rest to their less
enterprising comrades. But I pass from these hearsays to a few of
the final facts of the night. When the rum was drunk a proposal was
made to get more. It was overruled; but I could fully understand
that the method by which the rum was to be procured had been
practised before, and that it was now only relinquished because of
the darkness of the night, and the consequent difficulty of the
messenger who should be sent making his way good to and from the
point where it was to be obtained. But I check my pen. It is
possible I may have misunderstood what was only intended, but not
done, and of which the intention itself was only expressed in
obscure hints, by disconnected phrases, and with the purest "slang"
of the class. Quite far in the night all hands who meant to return
to their huts had departed. A sheet of bark was laid down on the
ground before the fire for me and one of the visitors&mdash;one of
the flashest. I had noticed him all along bestowing particular
observation on me; I even remarked his calling out one of the hands
belonging to the hut after a species of scrutiny which I perfectly
conceived. In about ten minutes they came in; again there was the
same looking at me, and a few slang sentences passed,&mdash;I could
not shut my eyes to what it meant. I took out, before I lay down,
my little tin box and opened it, as if to see whether all was safe;
put it in again, and jingled it against the coin. At length we lay
down, after I had put on my jacket, as it was rather chilly, and we
had but a single rag of blanket over us both, and a few dried
sheepskins under us. My tin box and coin I left in the trowsers
pocket, whilst my orders were in the sleeve as I have described. I
knew he would never think of feeling there when there was the tin
box in my pocket. I kept awake a long time to see if he would try
for it, but not a finger did he move, snoring as if he would never
wake again. At last, outwearied, I went to sleep, and then it could
not be more than an hour before daybreak. With the first beams of
the sun the shepherds began to bestir themselves. I awaked; my
bedfellow was gone; all the conten ts of my upper pocket had melted
into thin air. Nervously I clapped my hand up to the shoulder I had
been so carefully lying on all night. All was safe: I had been too
many for a professed hand; and, to tell the truth, I did feel not a
little vain of my exploit. I did not say anything about my loss;
for I have no doubt it was a common concern, in which all belonging
to the hut expected to get their "whack." However, when they came
to try to pass the order, whoever was agent would find himself in
an awkward position. To me it was useless, as I was never likely to
see the man again from whom I took it.</p>

<p>Such scenes as these might be multiplied till the reader's
patience would be exhausted. But one suffices to depict the general
truth as well as a thousand. It seems quite a maxim by prescription
in New South Wales that "magistrates' men are generally the worst
men." If the term "severe" be added in qualification of the term
"magistrates" I have no hesitation in adding my own most explicit
affirmation. In fact by pointing out the severest magistrate at the
head of the Hunter, and the severest again in the middle part of
the river, and the severest again on the lower, you have expressly
indicated the exact theatre of the three worst gangs of bushrangers
which I remember to have infested that river during my whole long
residence in the colony. In two of these cases I know also that the
materials of the gangs were almost wholly men from the two farms
relatively indicated. Of the other case I am not prepared to make
this particular statement; though I have no doubt if it should be
examined it would turn out the same. But one circumstance which I
do happen to know about this latter magistrate, I think I ought not
to leave unrecorded. It was notorious that he used habitually to
sit and curse the poor wretches of convicts, nay even free men
brought before him; used, I say, to sit and curse them from the
bench in the most unmeasured cadences of profanity. I could tell of
another magistrate, a military gentleman in charge of one of the
iron gangs, who used to be intoxicated three-fourths of his time;
and in that state preside in court, try, and sentence the helpless
slaves over whom his power extended. The very man who sold him the
rum used to lift up his hands in dismay and disgust at the work of
his own poisonous merchandise. If any one should doubt these facts,
he may convince himself on a large scale at once. Let him refer to
the whole current of judgments which the Supreme Court of New South
Wales has during the last twenty years given in the cases of
magistrates; and again to the Indemnity Act, and the magisterial
aggressions on the liberty of the subject which gave occasion for
it. Indeed when the late lamented Dr. Wardle and W. C. Wentworth,
Esq., commenced their professional practice in Sydney and dragged
two or three serious cases to light, it was found necessary by the
whole commission of the peace to turn over a new leaf; though much
wrong of the most enormous character remained for years afterwards,
and much still remains. I close with one further fact. When I
passed through Wellington some years ago, the police authorities
were flogging a man in front of the missionary's (the Rev. Mr.
Watson's) house, <i>under his very windows</i>. I understood
afterwards that that gentleman had lodged a complaint about it, and
that the police magistrates denied it. Now the thing itself is just
as certain as the daily presence of the sun above us. It was the
talk of the whole country side for months afterwards; with this
additional particular, that the female part of Mr. Watson's family
had been thrown into such a state of agonized excitement at the
protracted yells that he knew not what to do to compose them;
flying in vain from one room to another to avoid the frightful and
intolerable offence; and furthermore that it was done to drive that
gentleman away from the settlement, he and the police authorities
being at variance. All parties are living, I believe. I purposely
refrain from comments, unless it should be necessary for me
hereafter to come to proofs. '<i>Parliamentary Papers relative to
the Aborigines of the Australian Colonies, ordered by the House of
Commons to be printed</i>, 9<i>th August</i>, 1844,' will give my
voucher for the publicity of the report itself at p. 42. The rest
that can be supplied remains for the present in abeyance.</p>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter XVIII. Up-Country
Storekeeping.</h2>

<p class="newspaper">Some account of beginning&mdash;List of articles and prices of
purchase and of sale&mdash;Instructions to persons undertaking
similar concerns&mdash;Occupation of another station in the
interior</p>

<p>I NOW come to a period of my history which contains but little
incident likely to interest the reader. All had gone on well enough
at my own station during my absence under R &mdash;&mdash;'s
superintendence. He shortly afterwards married; and as the farm
down the country where the old man and M &mdash;&mdash; lived had
now, in the proper sense, a mistress of its own, M &mdash;&mdash;
became my wife. Her residence henceforth was of course up the
country. On removing to my station for a permanency our joint
efforts soon put its business into a train which left us almost
nothing to do daily. I particularly began to feel the time drag on
very heavily. My wife's good genius again befriended me. She
suggested that I should take the team to Sydney and buy a lot of
goods of various kinds for sale: that she could always look to the
sale of one lot whilst I went to town for another; and that great
numbers of men who had checks to spend would find our station
nearer than any other store. What money we could raise was
immediately disposed in this way; and I took credit of a still
further sum: the total was nearly 300<i>l</i>. But let me here
remark that in the hands of a person unskilled in the habits of the
bush this sum would have gone no great way. It was my perfect
familiarity with the proportional demand for the various articles
which rendered it amply sufficient for a very good beginning. Many
persons even of long standing in bush life would have laid in a
stock of which not more than one third in value would turn itself
in twelve months. Of the lot of goods I selected we had not twenty
pounds' worth (cost price) in the house by the end of eight months
from the time we began to sell, or nine from my loading the dray
with it in Sydney. The profits throughout were generally very good;
the chief drawback on them was through bad debts and bad orders.
Both these are disadvantages which in the up-country trade of New
South Wales no caution or discrimination seems capable of entirely
obviating. You must give credit or be content with less than half
the trade; and you must take paper money when presented or lose
your sale, though taking it thus you lie under the constant risk of
putting some worthless scrap of paper, a mere forgery, into your
cashbox in return for six or seven pounds' worth of goods. The
dealer who should refuse orders till he knew the names of all the
various drawers would never make a trade.</p>

<p>It will not be a piece of valueless information to many of my
readers, if I give them some notion of prices in an up-country
store. This will be done most definitely and precisely, I think, by
giving a description of our own little concern. At first we kept
the goods in our sleeping room of a larger hut, which R
&mdash;&mdash; had had run up whilst I was away; but when we had
sold three loads, we had another compartment added for them, as the
stock began to get too large for the space. The stock consisted of
the following articles, of which the lowest sums stated were the
cost price, as per invoice delivered with them in Sydney; the
larger sums are the selling price up the country.</p>

<pre>
Tea             2s. per lb. cost price     5s. per lb. retail price.
Sugar           3d. per lb. cost price     8d. per lb. retail price.
Tobacco         1s. 6d. per lb. cost price 6s. (excellent Australian.)
Soap            4d. per lb. cost price     8d. (excellent Australian.)
Plums           4d. per lb. cost price     1s. (excellent Australian.)
Currants        (account lost)             1s. 6d. (excellent Australian.)
Pocket-knives   9d. each, by the dozen     3s. each singly.
Trowsers        3s. 6d. to 15s. per pair   7s. to 25s. per pair.
Jackets         5s. upwards                11s. upwards.
Lace-up boots   6s. per pair               11s. 12s. 14s. according to size.
Shirts          15s. per dozen             30s. to 36s. per doz.
                                                2s. 6d. to 3s. each.
Calico          4d. per yd, upwards to 7d. 8d. upwards to 1s. 6d.
Prints          4d. 5d. 6d. per yard       8d. 10d. 1s. per yard.
Blankets (good) 15s. per pair              30s. per pair.
Silk
handkerchiefs  3s. 6d. each               8s. each.
</pre>

<p>From the above list it will be perceived how great are the
profits on some articles. On the bulk of articles, however, the
profit is not more than 100 per cent. Still, on account of the much
larger per centage on the goods that sell in greatest quantities,
as tea, tobacco, sugar, pocketknives, &amp;c., the average advance
on the invoice prices in a retail store is considerably over 100,
perhaps even over 200 per cent. On the other hand, the expenses are
heavy. The carriage of the goods so many miles of road by drays,
which are often delayed several days, and even weeks, by the loss
of their bullocks, or breaking an axle, or by floods, is very
expensive. Taking the whole of our little trade together, we
cleared rather above 100 per cent. during the first twelve months;
and afterwards more than that, nearer I should say to 150. A large
proportion of our sales, however, it must be remembered, were to
settlers, and therefore wholesale: these were of course effected at
much inferior rates. In conformity with the resolution I have
mentioned in a former part of my history, we declined dealing in
wine and spirits. This, however, is the source of the dealer's
chief profit in general. But it is difficult to conceive how any
man, who has a wife and rising family, can submit to having such
scenes and language brought under their notice as invariably attend
the locality of this species of trade. Our sale went steadily on
for some years; other dealers, however, after some time sat down in
the neighbourhood, and then it declined. Still, with both a reduced
sale and reduced profits, we made, up to the time we ceased to have
any connexion with it, 300<i>l</i>. per annum, one year with
another. Altogether this species of speculation may be set down as
one of the most profitable in New South Wales. The points to be
attended to are these:&mdash;1st. A good situation. There should be
no other store near; and there should be a good labouring
population at least ten miles round every way. 2nd. A well-assorted
stock. I know of no available directions to give on this point;
unless it be to get hold of some clerk who has been in an upcountry
store, and get an idea of the proportional sale of the various
articles from him; or to get an opportunity of closely observing
the proportions in a well-supplied store itself. 3rd. As speedy and
sound a judgment upon the point of the trust-worthiness of
individuals, high and low, as possible. Many settlers who could pay
10,000<i>l</i>. if they were compelled, will not pay one penny if
they can help it. I have been to men who own land all over the
country, half a dozen times, with an I. O. U. for 10<i>s</i>.
Indeed the amount of capital thus fraudulently retained throughout
the colony is quite incredible to persons unused to its customs. I
am not aware of any test for discriminating "good marks" from bad
ones, but careful and close study of the population with immediate
regard to this specific question. My wife was the almost sole
manager of this portion of our affairs, from the beginning to the
end, which was better than seven years. My occupation consisted in
bringing the goods from Sydney, looking after our cattle, and
getting in every year such a crop of one thing and another as quite
covered our own consumption; wheat, maize, potatoes, and tobacco
being the staple. Our family consisted of two sons, both of them,
like the whole white-native population, blessed with very good
health. I should suppose there are few races, if indeed there is
any race of men, in the habitual enjoyment of such sound health as
the white Australians. Most of the young men are of very good
stature; a great number quite extraordinarily so. The most obvious
characteristic of the Australian white women is a peculiar and
striking womanliness; a strongly feminine aspect and tone of voice;
and I think I may add that the same quality runs no less distinctly
into their style of thought and general mental character.</p>

<p>The last step of consequence in the way of business which I
took, was the removal of my cattle and of a quantity of sheep which
I had bought to some distance farther out. I should have observed,
however, that I had some time before become the purchaser of the
ground on which my buildings stood, but I had to pay pretty well
for it. My remarks on this head I reserve to a subsequent chapter,
merely observing here that the cost of the whole tract on which my
herd ran, and with less than which I could not have managed, was
between 900<i>l</i>. and 1000<i>l</i>. On buying the sheep I was
necessitated to take them a good way farther into the interior; and
the cattle run being very much eaten down, I drafted off two-thirds
of the herd and drove them out along with the sheep. As one of my
objects was the construction of a second homestead for my second
son, I chose for my headquarters a spot within the boundary of
location, abutting on a large and fine grazing and depasturing
tract as yet unoccupied, immediately without the boundary. Had I
gone beyond the boundary I could not have made sure of purchasing;
and really to build without purchasing (especially under Governor
Gipps) was a very hazardous experiment for any person desiring the
continued possession of his own property. Nearly two years wore
away before we got everything snug. R &mdash;&mdash; had had my
horses running with his nearly from the first, much closer to
Sydney than my station, for the sake of keeping near the
opportunity of the best stock; but I now moved them up to the
out-station. They were increased in number to thirty-seven, and
several had been sold; and these things went on much in the same
kind of progress till the events I am about to describe in the next
chapters.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter XIX. Attack by the
Aborigines.</h2>

<p class="newspaper">The necessity of arming the working-men at
outstations&mdash;News of attack brought by the
hutkeeper&mdash;Journey to the station&mdash;Sheep found scattered
in all directions&mdash;Both shepherds found murdered&mdash;Bodies
removed to the hut&mdash;A night's watch&mdash;Reinforcement and
pursuit&mdash;Recovery of the remnant of the flock&mdash;Extensive
depredations of the blacks&mdash;Poison resorted to instead of
fire-arms by the men for self-protection</p>

<p>ONE of our huts, with its two boughyards for the sheep, was on
the very edge of the high bank of the &mdash;&mdash; River. The
river-bed was dry except for two large water-holes, one above and
one below the hut; and the further bank is covered with dense
forest and scrub: but all round the sheepyards for a mile every way
on the near bank, a beautiful plain stretches almost without a
hillock. The men employed at this station were all men purposely
picked from the rest, as possessing most steadiness and courage;
two of them had been for several years off and on at the
out-stations about these parts, and one of them in particular was
well acquainted with the principal blacks, and, to some extent,
conversant with their language. They were told, if the blacks
became troublesome, to come in to the head station (about seventeen
miles) and fire-arms should be given them, but none were kept
customarily at the station. We had no reason to apprehend any
collision, and therefore did not prepare for it. And this indeed,
just opposite to the theory of the colonial Government on the
point, is the settlers' standing error: all men at out-stations
ought to be armed; for the consciousness of power, whilst on the
one hand it intimidates the aborigines, on the other placing the
white man out of fear, keeps his mind clear of that bitter enmity
to the blacks which otherwise takes possession of it, when, to use
a common phrase, "he lives in hourly fear of his life from them."
It is certainly much better that some little of the haughtiness of
power should be manifested on that side where the power exists
along with civilization, than that the balance should be cast the
other way, and the savage be armed whilst the white man is left
defenceless, giving the facility of aggression where it is least
controlled by internal impulse and the habit of conformity to
social rule.</p>

<p>At the station I have just described, which I had settled seven
or eight months before and therefore supposed now to be quite safe,
there was a flock of old ewes and a flock of wethers getting into
condition for the butcher, about five hundred in each flock. The
pasturage was very good, and altogether it was a station where I
did not need to go above once in two or three weeks; and as the
rations were' always sent out on a packbullock once a fortnight,
and the station out of the direct line of travellers, it was seldom
we heard anything of them beyond once every second week: and thus,
in this case, the men were left without the protection which
otherwise they should have had.</p>

<p>It was about a fortnight before Christmas, 184-, and very hot
weather, and I was just come back from one of the other stations
where I had been to count the sheep, when the hut-keeper from the
&mdash;&mdash; River station came hurrying across the square made
by our buildings at the head station, bare-headed and barefooted,
and covered with sweat and dust. I first saw him as I got off my
horse, and directly knew something was wrong. He could hardly
speak, having run, he said, almost the whole 17 miles. His story
when told was, that that morning, after they had had their
breakfast, the two shepherds had gone off with their flocks in the
same direction, and he had taken his broom and shovel and gone into
the yards to sweep them. Presently a whole mob of blacks, from a
camp in the scrub on the opposite side of the river, came to the
hut. Expecting they would steal something or other, he left his
work and went into the hut to them. They soon began to ask for
bread and "bullock" (beef), in a way which showed they did not mean
to be denied; and then for tobacco. When they had all the
provisions that were in the hut cooked, and all his tobacco, they
then followed the shepherds. One of these was a very quiet, but a
very obstinate old man. As the sheep had not begun to spread, the
two shepherds were together in the space between the flocks, and
the blacks soon came up to them. At this time one of the flocks
started, and then the other shepherd set his flock in motion, and
the blacks went on along with the shepherds to the edge of the
plain. Thinking nothing would now happen, the hut-keeper went to
his work again, doubting whether he should not come in and report
that the blacks were getting more daring every day, as soon as he
had done the yards. But he was not suffered to wait for that. He
heard the yells of the blacks, and he thought a white man's coo-eh,
and then he saw a party of them separate from that one of the
shepherds they had followed and rush across to the other; and he
could see several of these who were left behind beating something
on the ground. On this, he jumped over the fence without waiting to
get his boots out of the hut, and ran off across the plain for the
track into the station as fast as he could. Before he got into the
bush, some of the blacks had turned back toward the hut, but had
most probably not observed him cross the plain, as there was a line
of swamp with high reeds in it nearly from the river to the bush,
betwixt him and them, as soon as he got about a furlong from the
hut.</p>

<p>Leaving this man behind, the overseer, who had now come up from
the ploughed ground (for such news spreads like wild-fire) and
myself started for the scene of this sudden tragedy, taking five
men from different stations on the road with us&mdash;some our own
men, some our neighbours'. It was nearly seven o'clock in the
evening, through one delay and another, before we reached the spot.
Little would it avail to tell persons in the quiet walks of
civilized life what stern words break out of men's bosoms at such a
time&mdash;how little one cares for food&mdash;how resistless
swells the torrent of mingling anxiety and wrath, making every mile
seem to the impatient soul a league, and the whole course of nature
out of order till retribution be achieved. When we got out of the
bush on to the plain, the first thing we noticed was that there was
no smoke from the chimney. Then we caught sight as we rode on of
about fifty of the old ewes huddled together down in the swamp
among the reeds, and holding up their heads every now and then with
that peculiar look which sheep have when there is anything
seriously amiss. There seemed to be no blacks about the hut, so we
drove them on with us and put them in the yard; there were a number
more there which had strayed home as evening came on, gone into the
yard, and lain down. As we were all armed, and seven in number,
with a whole pack of first-rate bull-dogs and heavy lurcher-bred
kangaroo-dogs, we needed no caution had there been a hundred of the
blacks, for they are as cowardly as they are ferocious, but rode
straight up to the hut door. All was in confusion; it had been
ransacked, and everything of food and wearing apparel carried off.
On going across to the spot where the shepherds were last seen, we
found them lying about 200 yards apart, both quite dead. They were
stripped of their clothing; both of them had been tomahawked, as
the square-sided wounds answering to the pole of one of these
weapons showed. Some more of the old ewes came past us as we stood
by the murdered shepherd, but ran on seeing us to the yard as hard
as they could. The other flock seemed gone altogether. So it turned
out; the blacks, who want no "Protectors" to teach them to choose
fat young mutton instead of old and lean, having driven them off
bodily.</p>

<p>Our melancholy duty of bringing the two poor fellows to the hut
was next performed: to have left them where they lay would have
been to expose them to be devoured by the bush dogs in the night,
unless some one could be found to watch them; and really we did not
any of us care to do so much in deference to the mere forms of a
law from which we well knew we were to obtain neither satisfaction
for the past nor security for the future. It was quite dark when we
got the two mangled bodies to the hut. Some of the men reported
that they had tracked the wether flock across the river, in the
direction of the blacks' camp, with the tracks of the blacks over
the sheep-tracks. It was thus evident they had driven off the whole
flock in mass. I now sent the overseer to the farm for more hands
and for provisions. The men that did not belong to us went back
with him to their stations. Two of my own men and myself alone
remained. We were not afraid of the aborigines attacking us before
morning; they fear to move away from their camp fires after dark.
But it was a melancholy, oppressive night nevertheless. It was very
dark, and we did not like to stay in the hut where the dead lay,
nor did we wish to light a fire, lest some of the aborigines more
daring than the rest, should send a shot across the river at us;
for we knew the tribe had fire-arms. The wind sighed and whispered
and wailed among a lot of large river oaks which grew on a stony
platform in the midst of the river; and the sheep kept rushing
about in the yard, startled by the strangeness; and perhaps by a
sense of the truth stronger than we commonly give dumb animals
credit for perceiving. At length it occurred to us that if we made
our fire on the off-side of the yards we should be secure enough
from the aim of the blacks; especially as during the greatest
silence we could hear nothing of them, their dogs, or the sheep; so
that it was probable they were gone away with their booty.</p>

<p>About five o'clock in the morning the overseer returned with
some bread and meat and tea and sugar, when we had breakfast. All
the hands that could be spared (eight) followed, reaching about
seven o'clock, by which time we had had our own breakfast and
prepared for them. As soon as possible we got on the track, an old
sheep-dog leading. He trotted on so fast when his master put him on
the track and gave him the word "find 'em," that it gave the
footmen sharp work to keep up with him. We came on their last
night's camping place at about seven miles from the river; skins
and half-picked bones were lying in all directions; even their dogs
had been so overgorged that they had left heaps of offal untouched
all about. They had not been gone above an hour: in less than
another we came in sight of them; but capturing any of them was out
of the question, for they saw us before we were within two miles of
them. They were just heading into a ravine of the &mdash;&mdash;
ranges, and had between them and us full two miles of level plain.
Making the best of our way up to the sheep we found nothing left
that could give indication that a black had ever been there except
a gin's water-couliman (a sort of bucket chopped out of the knot of
a tree, in which they fetch water). We searched the bush in all
directions, but not a gin or a pickaninny was to be found, much
less a man. The sheep were nearly fifty short,&mdash;a loss I was
very glad to be taxed with as the price of securing the rest. We
drove them, of course, direct for home, but did not reach till
late, as the sheep were so tired they were scarcely able to
travel.</p>

<p>Information having at first been sent from the farm to the
nearest police authorities, we of course expected the formality of
a visit; but the evening of the third day having come and no one
arrived, we dug a grave on the other side of the river and buried
the bodies. It was a measure indeed of necessity, for the climate
does not admit of the dead being kept many days at this season of
the year. We buried them on the opposite side of the river in case
of the hut and yards coming into use again at some future time. I
was obliged to move the sheep, for I could not get any men to stop
at this station; less, however, from fear of the aborigines, if
they were supplied with arms, than from repugnance to having the
late melancholy catastrophe perpetually before their minds.</p>

<p>This affair, meantime, was but the beginning of some months of
aggression. Both sheep and cattle, and even horses, were speared by
these savages; and numbers of men's lives were lost through their
fidelity to their masters' interests. I was, however, so fortunate
as not to lose any more of my own men; but it was because I
supplied them with arms and ammunition, and told them to take care
of themselves. On the other hand, several of my neighbours were
intimidated by the extraordinary delusion that had possessed the
government on the point of "Protection of the Aborigines;" and took
the arms away from their men. The consequence was, in several
instances the lives of the poor fellows were either taken or
attempted; whole flocks were driven away and dispersed; the cattle
were speared, and the stations driven right in. I state one further
fact here, but not on my own authority; the authority, however, is
no less than the rumour of the whole country side:&mdash;the fact,
that when the men at the farthest out-station found they were
deprived of the use of fire-arms, they used poison, mixing a
quantity of the corrosive sublimate used in compounding sheepwash
into a damper, and giving it to the most troublesome of a
tribe.</p>

<p>THE aggressions of the aborigines along the whole border of
civilization grew worse and worse daily; and they involved
generally the loss of life as well as the loss of property. I think
I need not have the slightest hesitation in saying that no such
state of things in this respect as now existed had ever happened
before since the settlement of the colony. There had been often
enough local and transitory outbreaks of the retaliatory
disposition of the blacks; but there was never before an entire
line of active hostility circumscribing the territory along its
whole boundary. So perfect and so simultaneous was this "rising,"
as it may be properly enough called; so coincident was it, both in
character and in occurrence, that no one at all used to the
classification of causes and effects, and to observing their
inseparable relation, could fail to call it one effect, proceeding
from one and a common cause. That cause can alone be found in a
mutual understanding of the point by the whole line of native
tribes from north to south. Nor is there any ground on which this
understanding could have proceeded except a general knowledge,
spread along the whole line of native tribes, of the fact that the
highest public authorities were every day manifesting a more mature
determination to carry out the protection of the native tribes
without a corresponding regard to the protection of the
settlers.</p>

<p>I am not at all inclined to deny, I fully believe, that the acts
in which the protection of the blacks was carried out had their
origin in a most proper aim and most praiseworthy feelings; but
that these feelings gradually became morbid, and that the blacks,
partly by listening to conversation in the huts of the stockmen
along the boundary, and partly by repeating among themselves what
they heard, detected its morbid and one-sided character, is
apparently not less undeniable&mdash;hence their simultaneous and
unanimous system of aggression. Accounts of the disposition of the
authorities travelled from Sydney to the out-stations; at the
out-stations the extra-colonial blacks got hold of it; and
presently, along the whole boundary-line of the colony, the sheep
are driven away, the cattle and horses speared, the men killed, and
the stations driven in. Not a day passed for many months without
tidings coming to our head station of somebody's hut robbed by the
blacks, or cattle met with in the bush speared, or shepherds,
terrified at the bloodthirsty demeanour of tribes which hitherto
had been quite quiet, driving in their flocks, and refusing to go
out again with them. Remonstrance after remonstrance was made to
the authorities by the settlers, but all to no purpose. Indeed it
was with worse than no advantage that these remonstrances were
made; for they actually provoked only reiterated assurances from
the authorities that the blacks should be protected; and this state
of things again communicated to the blacks, they were led on step
by step to a clear conviction that, for some mysterious reason or
another, "King George" had quite changed his mind, and had now
become their protector and partisan, as he had hitherto been the
white man's.</p>

<p>Much of this evil arose from the absurdity of some of our legal
proceedings in the courts. Naturally it must give these ignorant
savages feelings of no very great awe toward our criminal tribunals
to find one and another of their number, after being caught and
taken to Sydney, and tried for a horrible murder which they knew he
had committed, come back liberated and loaded with presents, on the
strength of some informality: especially when this occurred often.
But the final mischief, and indeed infinitely the worst, was done
by the "Protectorate of the Aborigines," as it was called, and by
the indiscreet confidence with which the "Protectors" and their
mission were treated by the governor. Nothing can be more true than
that the various "Protectors" were gentlemen of highly humane and
conscientious principle; but they came to the colony expressly as
advocates of one party, and therefore antagonists of another, and
as such should have been all along regarded; whereas it cannot but
be clear now to every one that an almost unlimited confidence was
placed in their representations, and an almost unlimited play given
to their designs, by him who should have stood as an arbiter
between the two parties. When these gentlemen went out among the
blacks first their title was explained: that was at once a
foundation for future misconception. Then they gave presents to the
blacks without requiring any work in return: here was plain proof
that they were the authorised emissaries of "King George." Again,
they told their business at length&mdash;told it to the native
tribes with all that excited sympathy which might be expected from
the men who would seek such an office. Then followed promises of
protection, uttered in all the warmth of earnestness, with all the
force of that broad figurative phraseology which a person uses who,
being unacquainted with a language, is yet determined to convey his
meaning in it as well as he can. They could make none of the nice
distinctions of conditional protection understood by the savages:
they were infinitely too much in earnest in their onesided humanity
to say too little; all that remained for them was to say too much;
all that they could effect was this impression on the mind of the
savage&mdash;<i>'that, whatever became of the white man, he</i>
(<i>the Aborigine</i>) <i>was to be protected</i>. Only those who
know the Australian Aborigines can conceive how shrewd they are in
direct and simple perceptions, and how perfectly infantile in
judgments where compass of thought is required, and where one
leading principle lies under extensive modifications from others.
Thus the "Protectors" had no notion of the mischief they were
doing; whilst it was none the less real. To give some faint general
notion of what was now going on, I shall extract from
'Parliamentary Papers, Aborigines of Australian Colony, 9th August,
1844,' pp. 213, 214, a representation of their losses in a few
weeks made by the settlers of Port Fairy only. It is a little out
of order in course of time, bearing date in the early part of 1842;
but is still just a fair counterpart of what took place in my own
locality at the time I speak of. <i>List of outrages recently
committed by natives in the neighbourhood of Port Fairy</i>. <i>Man

<p>At length the settlers were compelled to take the law into their
own hands, and defend themselves. From mere passive resistance, the
mind is soon provoked to retaliation. Stockmen who were held
responsible for cattle had no alternative but to defend them; and
that defence was only possible by the extermination of the
aggressive party. At length a catastrophe, terrible in all its
phases alike, took place. Some stockmen, whose cattle had been
extensively destroyed, and who had been kept for months in
continual fear of being themselves murdered, seized almost a whole
tribe, whom they had reason to suspect were variously implicated in
the outrages, and marched them out to a formal execution. Some
magistrate, on the Hunter's River, got wind of it, arrested the
parties, and sent them for trial to Sydney, where they were
convicted of the act, after being tried twice: the plea of
<i>autrefois acquit</i> being over-ruled, it was called murder; and
they, seven in number, were executed. The following account was
given on the first trial, which took place in November, 1839.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"GEORGE ANDERSON, <i>examined</i>.&mdash;I am
assigned servant to Mr. Dangar; I was at his station at Myall
Creek, as hutkeeper, for five months, in June. Mr. Hobbs lives
there as superintendent; he left home, to go to the Big River, in
the beginning of June; when he left, there were some native blacks
there; I have said there were twenty, but I am sure there were that
number, and upwards; I would not swear there were not forty. While
master was away, some men came on a Saturday, about ten; I cannot
say how many days after master left; they came on horseback, armed
with muskets and swords and pistols; all were armed; I was at home
when they came, and the stock-keeper; I was sitting with
Kilmeister, the stock-keeper, in the hut; I saw them coming up;
they came up galloping, with guns and pistols pointing towards the
hut; I did not attend to what they said; they were talking to
Kilmeister outside. I know Russel, Tolouse, Foley, Johnstone,
Hawkins, Kilmeister, Palliser, Lamb, and Oates; Blake and Parry I
do not know. About ten came up to the hut, as near as I could tell;
I will not swear Parry was not of the number, but I did not see
him; I never saw any of them before then, except Kilmeister; I
cannot say which came up first; they were all spread about; the
blacks were all encamped ready for the night; they were not more
than two yards from the hut; this was about an hour and a half
before sundown; there were plenty of women and children amongst
them. The blacks, when they saw the men coming, ran into our hut,
and the men then, all of them, got off their horses; and Russel had
a rope, which goes round a horse's neck, and began to undo it
whilst the blacks were in the hut. While he was undoing it, I asked
what they were going to do with the blacks, and Russel said, 'We
are going to take them over the back of the range, to frighten
them.' Russel and some one or two went in; I only took notice of
Russel going in while the blacks were in; I remained outside; one
of them remained in; I heard the crying of the blacks for relief or
assistance to me and Kilmeister; they were moaning the same as a
mother and children would cry; there were small things that could
not walk; there were a good many small boys and girls. After they
were tied, I saw Russel bring the end of the rope out they were
tied with, and gave it one of the men on one of the horses, I
cannot say which. The party then went away with the blacks; the man
who took the rope from Russel went in front, and the others behind;
all the blacks were tied together, and this rope tied them all
fast; they were tied with their hands; one black fellow had on a
pair of handcuffs; they were all fastened with one rope; it was a
tether rope for horses in a field; it is a very long rope; they
brought out the whole except two, that made their escape as the men
were coming up; they were two little boys, and they jumped into the
creek close to the hut; there was no water in it; they escaped at a
dry part; one black gin they left with me in the hut; they left her
because she was goodlooking; they said so; I forget which; another
black gin they left that was with Davy, another black fellow, who
was with me; there was a little child at the back of the hut when
they were tying this party, and when the blacks and party were
going away, this little child, as I thought, was going to follow
the party with its mother, but I took hold of it and put it into
the hut, and stopped it from going. I had two little boys, the
small child, two gins, and Davy and Billy; they all went away
except these; the child was going after its mother. There was an
old man, named Daddy, the oldest of the lot; he was called Old
Daddy; he was an old, big, tall man; this Daddy and another old
man, named Joey, they never tied along with the rest; they were
crying, and did not want to go; they made no resistance. Some of
the children were not tied, others were; they followed the rest
that were tied; the small ones, two or three, were not able to
walk; the women carried them on their backs in opossum skins; the
small children were not tied that followed the mob; they were
crying, in and out of the hut, till they got out of my hearing.
They went up towards the west from the hut, the road way;
Kilmeister got his horse ready, after he had done talking to them,
and just before they were going to start; he went with them on
horseback, and took the pistol with him; he was talking to them
five or ten minutes; I did not take notice what he said; I was
frightened; I did not pay any attention to what they were talking
about. Hall's Jemmy (Oates) had a pistol. I know Foley; he had a
pistol in his hand, standing at the door while the blacks were
inside. I did not take any notice of swords at first; at a
distance, when they were galloping up, I saw swords and pistols.
Kilmeister went with them when they started; they were not in sight
above a minute or so after they went away; about a quarter of an
hour, or twenty minutes at the outside, I heard the report of two
pieces, one after the other; the reports came from the same
direction they went; the second was quite plain for any one to
hear; I only heard two; I did not hear anything else but those two.
It was just before sundown, next night after, the same men came
back to the hut where they took the blacks from; they were all
together of a lump, except Kilmeister, who was left behind; one of
the party gave Kilmeister's saddle off his horse, and I asked him
where Kilmeister was; he came in about twenty minutes after; they
stopped all night. I and Kilmeister slept together in one berth;
the rest all slept in the hut; they were talking; I cannot
recollect what they said. Next morning, three of them, after they
had breakfast, look firesticks out of the hut, Russel, Fleming
another, and Kilmeister another; and before they took the
firesticks, Fleming told Kilmeister to bring the leg-rope with him
that ropes the cows; Kilmeister asked me for the leg-rope, and I
gave it to him, and they went in the same direction as they took
the blacks and that I heard the two pieces. One of the men was left
behind, and all the rest went with those who had the firesticks;
one was left with me as guard, named Foley. While they were away,
Foley and I were in the hut together, and the rest away; during the
time they were away, I asked Foley if any of the blacks had made
their escape; he said none, that he saw; he said all were killed
except one black gin. Before the party came back, Foley drew one of
the swords out of the case, and showed it to me; it was all over
blood. During that time Davy and Billy came to the hut; in about an
hour the other men came back to the hut; I saw smoke in the same
direction they went; this was soon after they went with the
firesticks; when they came back, I do not recollect what they said;
they got upon their horses, and Fleming told Kilmeister to go up by
and bye and put the logs of wood together, and be sure that all was
consumed; I do not recollect his saying anything; some of them were
in the hut, and must have heard it. Kilmeister, directly after the
party went from the station, went in the same direction and brought
back the horse he left behind; he said in the morning he was going
after his horse down the creek; the smoke was up from the creek, up
the ranges; I never went to the place; I did not like to go; Davy
went, and he came back. Kilmeister was away in the middle of the
day; he said the horse was knocked up, and not able to walk; I saw
him; he could catch him anywhere. I saw the smoke pretty well all
day; at the first beginning there was a great smoke; in the after
part of the day there was not much. I was there when Mr. Day came;
Kilmeister was at home when the police were coming; in the morning
after they went away a piece of a broken sword was found; it was a
broad piece, all dirty; I saw no blood on it; it was in the hut; I
gave it to Mr. Hobbs when the police went away from the station; it
did not belong to my station; it came with the party; it looked
like a piece of a handle, as a guard; I gave it to him one night as
he was in bed; he returned it; this was after the police went away.
When the police came, Kilmeister was at home; he said, 'For God's
sake, mind what you say, and not to say I went with them, but in a
quarter of an hour after them:' this was not true; he went with
them at the same time. They brought back no black gin they saved;
the gins they left, and the two boys, and the child I sent away
with ten black fellows that went away in the morning. The same
evening, in the night, the ten black fellows came back, which
Forster had taken away in the morning, and I turned them (five)
away along with those ten; it was moonlight; I sent them away as I
did not like to keep them, as the men might come back and kill
them.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"<i>Cross-examined</i>.&mdash;They came back
in the night; I was in bed at the time. I did not ask to have that
gin left behind; I did not ask for one; it was when they were going
away when they undid one gin for me. They left Davy; he had been
there a good while; he was more naturalized than the others; the
others were as quiet as he; I did not dream they would take Davy.
There was a gin left for me; I did not ask them to leave a gin; I
did not ask for the gin they left; I asked for one I had had
before; she was a black fellow's gin. I swear I stayed in the hut
after they left; I stayed there all night, except I wanted a bit of
wood. Davy slept on the station in the overseer's hut; I never went
to the place after Davy came. I saw smoke in the direction they
went; there was no smoke the same day or day before; there was no
bush on fire. I heard the shots distinctly, quite plain. I told
Hobbs they took the blacks away, and I could not help it. I do not
recollect his asking me who they were; I told him I did not know
who they were; I never knew them before. I never said I was sorry I
did not make it stronger or worse against Kilmeister; I do not
swear I did not say it to Burrowes. At first I identified only one
man before Mr. Day by name: I recollect since, the night after they
came back, who they were by name; I only identified one or two by
name. I swore to all the others by their faces, not by their names.
I knew them to be the same men, and only knew the faces of others;
the two names were Russel and Fleming; the rest I knew by face; I
knew Russel. I said before Mr. Day, and I told Hobbs, that I did
not know them by name; I did not say that I could not tell them; I
did not swear to all by name. I had two examinations, as I wanted
to speak the whole of the truth; I recollected more than I stated
at the first examination. I have been here five years and better; I
came for life. I never said this would get me my liberty; I neither
expect nor hope for my liberty; I do not ask for anything, only for
protection. I do not know what made it worse for Kilmeister, as he
was as bad as the rest; I forgot it before. I do not recollect the
magistrate saying I should be committed: he said I might be
committed for thinking; I said I did not think I should know them
again; I began to think all that happened; it was after I began to
recollect the whole of what was said and done that I spoke. I have
been punished twice since I have been in the colony: once for
neglect of duty, and the second time for being absent; I was
helping a man with his cattle, to assist him in driving cattle,
with his horse and dray. I was never punished at that station; I
was at New England; I did not deserve it on that occasion. I was
brought from New England to Patrick's Plains; I was eight days
coming down, and I walked hard there and back. It was for not
shifting the sheepfolds every day. There were two charges against
me; one for being away; I was away from the morning till the
afternoon; I went five or six miles; I got two fifties. I came here
for life, for robbing my master; I was ignorant and foolish, and
misled by different people; I am no thief. I was guilty of telling
another one to do it, and being concerned I was transported. I was
an apprentice; I was never out of streets in my life at nights for
five or six years. Foley was left behind as a guard; they said,
'Let him stop in case the blacks should come.' This was as a guard
over the arms left with me; I thought it was done to make me
believe there was danger. I have been frightened by blacks; I saw a
black fellow come one night; he never spoke, but ran away when I
spoke; that was not Mr. Hobbs's station. I knew Old Joey at the
station; he was a stout old man, but not so stout as Daddy. There
was King Sandy, and his wife and child; Sandy was taken away, and
his wife and child; Hippeta was the one I wanted; I am sure Sandy
was taken away, Joey and Daddy, and Tommey; I could name a good
many by what they called one another. Those that went away with the
rope, they had been there a good while. I did not know the names of
all the men; I knew Daddy, and Joey, and little Charley, and Sandy.
King Sandy was the father of Charley.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"<i>Re-examined</i>.&mdash;Davy never belonged
to the tribe; he belonged to the Peele; he came with Charley Neeve,
with cattle to the station. The blacks were there when Davy came;
Davy was among Dangar's people as long as I knew them, backwards
and forwards, and other places. When I told Hobbs I did not know
the prisoners, I answered that I did not know them before. Before
Mr. Day examined me Kilmeister was given in custody; I was then
examined. I did not identify only one by name. I was in bed when I
was called, and all of a tremble. One of the servants came, and
called me up; when I saw them all I knew them by sight; there were
two not there; as soon as I saw them I identified them as the
persons who came to the hut. It was over the arms Foley was left to
guard; they left two swords, pistols, and muskets; I counted myself
fifteen pistols. The roof of the spout where the water ran off the
hut was full of pistols. There were two Sandys; King and the other
went down. King Sandy went with Forster, and left two of his gins
behind."</p>

<p>To enable the reader to estimate truly this chapter of our penal
justice, a few remarks will be valuable; for as I have observed,
notwithstanding the loud and earnest remonstrances of the settlers,
the authorities persisted in the execution of the prisoners.</p>

<p>1. The execution took place in spite of a protest from eleven of
the jurymen on the first trial, and a recommendation to mercy
signed by ten of the jurymen on the second.</p>

<p>2. From time immemorial it had been the custom for influential
settlers to head parties like this, against the blacks. All former
governors had sanctioned this method of proceeding, by immediate
reprisals; and some of these men had thus been initiated into it.
They were hanged for doing what they had been taught was perfectly
lawful by the masters; and some of those masters magistrates of the
territory. Some less punishment than deprivation of life should
have been resorted to, to indicate positively to these ignorant men
the change in the law, or rather of the interpretation put upon the
old law by its new administrators.</p>

<p>3. The law was in effect punishing men for remedying its own
neglect. It was morally certain no stop would be put to the
outrages of the aborigines by the law; no stop was put to them by
the authorities, so long as the causes remained. Were parties then
to bear or to repress them? If to repress them, then the law, which
declined to direct the character of the proceeding, should not have
interfered to judge it. Surely where law does not pretend to reach
for the protection of a party, it should not extend for his
punishment in protecting himself. If, on the other hand, parties
were expected to bear with the outrages of the aborigines beyond
the boundaries, it was just saying&mdash;"If your cattle increase
faster than it suits us to survey, you must put up either with
their dying of starvation within the colony, or by the spears of
the blacks without:"&mdash;a novel method, one would say, of
advancing our colonial interests.</p>

<p>4. The sacrifice of these seven men's lives to the protection
theory, it was all along enforced upon the authorities, by those
who knew the habits and character of the aborigines, would make
matters worse instead of better. It did so. The blacks became more
outrageous; and great numbers of them fell victims to the
vindictive spirit which this ruthless proceeding kindled in the
breasts of the stockmen.</p>

<p>From this time forward (<i>i. e.</i> from the execution of the
seven stockmen) the mischief increased. The blacks were driven out
of huts where hitherto they had always found countenance and
kindness. They in retaliation either did, or incited the wilder
blacks to do, violence to the settler's property and to his men's
lives. Then again, in return, the men and many of the masters shot
them, with no more compunction that they would so many bush-dogs,
in the secrecy of the bush, and left them there. From what I heard
at several stations far out, I think there can be no doubt but that
some of the more ruffianly and ferocious among the whites got rid
of those they most dreaded of the wilder tribes by poison. Nor was
it till the perfect futility of the Protectorate project as
originally promulgated became so self-evident that its most
chivalric disciples abandoned it as of much too Quixotic a cast for
common taste; and thus the government began again to tolerate or
quietly to connive at the system it had lately denounced with such
a horrible emphasis, that matters came to rights. At length, when
the nature of our position at those distant and unguarded
out-stations came to be better understood, together with the
necessity of submitting to either vast loss of stock or else of
continuing this system of migration over the boundary; and
especially when the incorrigibleness of the blacks, by anything
contained in the Protectorate scheme, was made evident, the
original and customary course of things was permitted to return.
The matter fell into its true and old form, from which it should
never have been disturbed: a simple question of <i>intimidation</i>
(nothing more) between the musket and the spear. And every black's
common sense solves this question so readily and correctly and
uniformly, that the simple consciousness of its being the true and
only question is sufficient at any time to bring them into a state
of submission. And if we want more than that, if we want a league
of peace on equal grounds, really there is no road to it but that
we give up their land and forsake their country: for this and this
only is the true source of aggravation. It is the white man at
large, not the individual, upon whom their enmity is pointed. The
miserable rebuff which our philanthropy has met with is only a new
enforcement of the old axiom&mdash;that men should be just before
they are generous. The blacks cannot be conciliated unless by
giving up their country. If they are to be intimidated, it must be
by something that is more prompt and effective than their own
spear, and less dilatory than our law.</p>

<p>NOTHING but the common occurrences of agricultural and pastoral
life presents itself among my personal recollections after the
period treated of in the last chapter for a considerable time. My
two sons, as they grew up, took kindly, as almost all the
Australians do, to rural occupations. The eldest I left chiefly at
the out-station, and the youngest was mostly with myself and his
mother at the farm I first settled on. My own health at last took
such a serious turn for the worse that the doctor advised a return
to my native clime. The hardships I had endured in the early part
of my career in New South Wales, along with too great activity
afterwards, were the only probable causes for it. I may say that,
for years, I slept in wet bedding. The damp is so great in the
perpetual shadow of the cedar-brush that when, during a more than
usually long stretch of wet weather, our blankets have become
palpably wet, and we have attempted to dry them at the fire before
going to bed, the steam would reek up from them as if from a
boiling copper. And I really always fancied I felt their damp
coldness on lying down strike more chill to me than when we turned
into them just as they were. Perhaps this was because of the warmth
just felt at the fire in drying them. Again, on the roads, it is
usual, when travelling with a dray, to sleep underneath it, with a
good tarpaulin spread over all right down to the ground on every
side except at the tail of the dray, before which the fire is made
for the night. Every bed should have a sheet of dry bark first laid
down for it to be spread on. But this precaution is often
neglected, or perhaps the bark, through lying on very wet ground
for many nights, becomes saturated so that one side is almost as
wet as the other; or a shower comes unexpectedly when the bedding
is exposed. Again, in the bustle of such an active life as mine,
one has not time to be ill by instalments, and so I suppose the
whole debt of this kind which nature claims of us has to be paid at
once. The excitement of strong purpose probably keeps off the sense
of exhaustion till this becomes downright illness and will not be
any longer neglected. Suffice it that there appeared no
alternative. When I first arrived in New South Wales the
perspiration used to flow profusely during the hot days; it now was
substituted by a constant burning heat without the slightest
moisture; and at times by a sense, for hours, of icy coldness,
while to the eye the whole atmosphere was, as it were, in a blaze,
and the surface of the earth too hot for the feet to stand for more
than a few seconds bare on the sand. It may be of advantage to some
in the colony who have begun to experience similar symptoms to
learn that, though the voyage was trying and the cold very painful
in England when I first arrived, I am now obtaining the most
sensible benefit, and consider myself in the direct road to
completely renovated health.</p>

<p>Before I proceed to the closing chapter of my narrative it will,
I think, be felt desirable that I should return to a few points,
and complete my statements about them by some general remarks,
comprising my own view of each subject in its practical light.</p>

<p>First, the Land Regulations.&mdash;That these are the most
excellent things in theory that statesmanship ever imagined, I am
not prepared to dispute. That they suit pretty well the highest
class, those who legislate in the colony, those from whom the
legislators of the colony are drawn, those from whom emanate the
representations which by one means and another are rendered so
influential in the Imperial legislature, may also be true. But they
suit nobody else. Their effect is principally two-fold. They
entirely prevent persons of small property from becoming
landholders and agriculturists; by which again they coercively
construct an immensely larger labouring class than otherwise would
exist in the colony. Consequently the rich landholder both keeps
the produce market to himself; and again procures labourers at a
vastly lower rate of wages. He diminishes the competition with
himself in the produce market, and just so much increases the
competition among the labourers in the labour market. The minor
consequences are these:&mdash;a very bitter and continually
deepening feeling of disaffection to the British Government and its
Australian employés in the minds of the colonial youth. There is a
settled sense among them that they are debarred of their rights. I
was told some time ago of this remarkable fact,&mdash;that there
were not half a dozen of the Australian youth in the British army;
and I am persuaded that unless this feeling be looked after and
allayed, it will eventually result in the separation of the colony
from British jurisdiction: for, when it comes to the point to save
their possessions, the rich will go with the poor. At present, and
nothing can be more certain, the whole rising and mature race of
Australians of the middle and lower class look on our dominion as
an usurpation, and as one of the most selfish character. They say,
and truly enough,&mdash;Great Britain sends out two classes here:
one of these, as being rich, originally obtained vast grants of
land for nothing, and is still allowed to buy on terms to which it
can conform; the other, as being poor, is not even allowed to buy,
because the very condition of purchase is that the purchaser be
rich. The rich have delivered their right with their riches to
their offspring,&mdash;he who has already too much can get more.
The poor, with their poverty, have delivered to their children a
list of rights deficient in the grandest particular, the right to
hold land; thus, right to land is the birthright of a certain
class, whilst to all others it is denied. Another effect of this
large farm system is this,&mdash;Australia is liable to periodical
famines; the rich find labour so scarce and stockholding so
profitable that they naturally throw all their force of labour into
the latter, and have none comparatively left for agriculture; on
the contrary, the poor man, having no stock or but little, would
naturally betake himself to the agricultural use of the soil; but
the land being put up for sale only in such large tracts he cannot
buy. Thus the very class whose labour would naturally direct itself
against that periodical scourge of Australia, famine, is denied the
means of doing so, and a whole population every three or five or
seven years is subjected to this sore penalty for the undue
advancement of a class, and that the smallest. The hoe crops in
Australia very commonly succeed when the plough crops fail: the
rich settler works his land with the plough, the poor with the hoe;
a still further token of the intrinsic error of the present
arrangements. Finally, the monetary condition of the country and
the moral condition of the labouring class are most injuriously
affected by the present system. Hundreds of thousands of pounds
have been spent by the labouring population in the public-house
which would have been spent in the purchase of little farms, if
such were purchaseable. The Australian labourer is naturally
improvident. He cannot keep money by him till he has several
hundreds of pounds; and unless he can purchase his ten or twelve
acres of land when he receives his wages, he will never possess it
at all. And this the great people well know. <i>I feel confident
that if small farms of 10, 20, 50, 100 acres could be purchased, a
new and most useful class would be immediately constructed, which
would gradually and speedily increase; all the British exports
which a family needs would be thus brought into increasing demand;
money, which would otherwise be assuredly spent in public-houses,
would be turned into a useful channel; and the strong feeling of
political disaffection which is establishing itself in the
native-born population, which will soon infinitely out-number all
the rest, would be met on the very ground it grows on, and be
checked</i>. At present he who wants to buy a farm must first get
rich. Australia is no place for any poor man who wants to settle
his little farm and gradually go on as his own master from little
things to greater. If any one wish to be a servant for twenty years
first, and then begin to farm, Australia is his ground. My own case
was a peculiar one. I had an excellent trade, and a first-rate
constitution for labour. I have often worked eighteen hours a day,
which under a burning sun few can do. The opportunities of large
gains, which the cedar trade once offered, are now at an end, and
can never be renewed. The occupation of land now is not permitted
to go on as it did when first I bought my cattle. Had things been
then as they are now, my success would probably have been very
different. Besides, I had what is commonly called "very good luck;"
such perhaps as not above one in fifty would meet with. But if, on
the other hand, any one can be satisfied with common farming or
grazing employments for years, at 20<i>l</i>. and 25<i>l</i>. per
annum, I may give him this assurance, he will never want for a job
in Australia. One settler will no sooner have done with him than he
will find the next ready to employ him.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;The arrest of free persons on suspicion of being
bushrangers. If the state of things on this point could be clearly
represented to the British labourer before he starts from home, not
one in twenty would subject himself to it. The emigration agents
never tell anything against their case: this matter among others is
never hinted at. Yet surely people ought to be told. For a free
person cannot even come out of the colony without great trouble. In
the vessel I returned by, I saw, on a cold wet morning, all the
fore cabin passengers compelled to turn out, and come on deck and
show "their liberty," as it is called. The captain answered for all
of us in the after-cabins; but everybody forward, even to women
with infants at the breast, were turned out on the deck in the
rain, to parade before two dirty constables with cutlasses in their
hands. It happened that every person could give satisfactory
evidence of being free; but it just as often happens that
constables drag on shore some party they are not satisfied with.
And this the colonial law expressly authorizes; whilst at the same
time nothing is more difficult than to get from the authorities a
proper protective document. Now, either people should be frankly
told what they are going to subject themselves to before they
emigrate, or else some satisfactory change should be immediately
made in the law and custom of the colony. Clearly nothing can be
more outrageously unjust than to make it penal to have been always
free. Again, that vague term of the law "reasonable" cause of
suspicion should be defined. As it stands, the law itself can only
give redress for outrages so gross as are rarely likely to occur;
the great body of wrong arrests passes with impunity. Here, also, I
may properly advert to the "Farm Constable" and "Private Lock-up"
systems. I know it to be a common thing for the larger settlers to
send their men to the lockup on their farms, ostensibly and orally
to be kept secure to go to court; then after having inflicted such
a period of confinement on them as they think fit, to let them out
to their work. In plenty of cases, the master knows very well that
he has no charge against the man for which he is legally liable,
and sends him to the lock-up for that very reason. All this
arbitrary and injurious authority should be done away with. A
proper protective document should always be handed to emigrants on
arrival; and afterwards, if lost by accident, or worn out, or
stolen, there should be a facility for its immediate renewal. Every
person entitled to such a protection, throughout the colony, should
be furnished with one at the outset; and some particular official
should be appointed at every court, whose duty it should be to
attend to the claims which would be made under this provision.
Nothing, I repeat once more, can be more absurd and more heinously
unjust than to lay a penalty, to all British men so severe, upon
the free labourer, for the master's neglect to keep in safe custody
the convict labourer which the public bounty has assigned him. The
convict's safe custody by the master is part of the compact of
assignment. What person in possession of his moral senses would
think of laying the penalty of the neglect of the party benefited
by the arrangement (the master) upon the party injured by it (the
free labourer)? Surely it is bad enough for him that the bondman
should be brought into competition with him in the labour market:
to saddle him still further with the safe custody of his competitor
is too barefaced.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;The Hired Servants' Act. This is another of those
statutes under which the benches of New South Wales develop the
most surprising conceptions of law and equity. Some years ago a
member of one of the highest mercantile firms in England, who has a
farm in New South Wales, engaged and sent out a lot of free
labourers. Among these was a shoemaker, who, on hiring, never
supposed himself hiring as anything else than a shoemaker. When he
had been some months up the country (far in the interior), the
superintendent of the farm came home on Sunday afternoon, and found
all the men away but this man; he was in his hut. The
superintendent ordered him to go down to the river and cut some
grass for his horse. The man refused, saying "it was Sunday." Next
day the superintendent brought him before the adjacent bench,
<i>every member of which was his own intimate acquaintance</i>: he
was convicted, under the Hired Servants' Act, of refusal to work;
and sent for SIX MONTHS TO GAOL. This passed under my own
observation, and indeed was one of the very incidents which
determined me to write this book. If such cases as these occurred
rarely, one would think but little of them; but they take place
continually, in every quarter of the country, except Sydney and two
or three of the larger towns, where there are lawyers continually
in and out of the courts, witnessing the proceedings. The very
presence of gentlemen learned in the law seems to invest the
magistracy with a faculty of correct interpretation quite
admirable, when looked at comparatively with what they possess in
the converse case. I am not prepared to suggest any remedy in this
case. The appointment of paid magistrates was considered some time
ago to be an attempt to remedy evils in the administration of the
law at the inferior courts, of which this was one; but I do not
believe it did any good. The police magistrate gets acquainted with
his settler neighbours who are honorary members of the bench; and
the same system goes on, only with this difference, that it is at
second-hand. I incline to fear that for this particular evil there
is no remedy except the dread of public opinion in England, and
fear of its effects on the various colonial interests.</p>

<p>Fourth&mdash;The horrid iniquities of the ultra-penal
settlements.&mdash;This point I have entirely omitted in the body
of my book. For first I could state nothing from observation; and
secondly, I knew that the subject could not be handled
descriptively without rendering the volume inadmissible into
families where a proper store is set upon a decorous style of
feeling and sentiment. Let the following general particulars
suffice. At these places of banishment, great numbers of the most
depraved, obscene, and desperate men are brought together. No
females are allowed within the limits of these atrocious dens. It
is not enough for government to concentrate into one mass all that
earth by her last worst processes sublimes of hell, but the
alleviating element must be carefully distilled off and kept away.
The fiend of pure solitary physical selfishness then stands
incarnated in all his aptitude for violence and lust. A discipline
to match such a case can as well be conceived without description
as by it. Nor are emissaries to carry out such a discipline found
wanting. Continually, under the intolerable treatment they are
subject to, murders are committed by these poor wretches on their
own comrades, that they may get to Sydney and be hanged. The
enjoyment of a few weeks of intermission of their sufferings in
Sydney Gaol is considered a full equivalent for the ultimate
penalty of execution. But the desperation engendered by these awful
and iniquitous establishments is the bright side of the picture.
Another remains: but what pen shall delineate it? What eye would
desire to look into scenes which even the recording angel must
blush to transcribe for the final judgment? But if any desire to
certify themselves of the reality of the facts, something divested
of their grosser horrors, let them refer to the 'Report of the
Select Committee on Transportation, 1837, ordered to be printed by
the House of Commons.' There they will meet with the evidence of
the Colonial judges&mdash;of military officers who have been in
command of these places&mdash;and of the chaplains, Roman Catholic
and Anglican, who have done duty there. The only further remark I
will make is this: that Captain Maconochie did more for the
reformation of these unhappy wretches and in amelioration of their
physical circumstances than the most sanguine practical mind could
beforehand have ventured even to hope. It is greatly to be
regretted that his views were not carried out to their fullest
extent, in the most cordial spirit. My knowledge of the convict's
character warrants my saying expressly that they offer the only
approximation that has ever yet been made to a correct penal
theory. The Imperial government, with the results of the experiment
already made of these principles in their hands, are ill executing
the trust which the nation and which God has reposed in them so
long as Captain Maconochie shall continue uninvested with full
power to repeat his process on a scale of extent equal to the
materials themselves.</p>

<p>Fifth&mdash;The moral and religious necessities of the
population. It is difficult to deal with a subject so extensive as
this in a few lines. Still, as I may hope, by giving the
conclusions to which so many years of study have led, at least to
add to the data sought of more competent judgments, I will attempt
it. When I speak of the population, I mean all, free and bond,
white and black. It will be evident, consequently, that the means
must be as varied as are the exigencies to which they are to apply.
The upper and middle classes of the population must be at once
confided to the press and the pulpit. I am sorry to say laxity of
life is no less rife in these sections than in the others. It is
very true it assumes not quite such gross and disgusting forms. But
unquestionably its existence is as positive and its quality as
specific. I should say that hundreds of the upcountry settlers have
almost lost the sense of <i>moral</i> obligation; i.e. using that
term in its precise sense: nor is the religious sense any more
perfect. Again, the labouring population are universally lost to
all sense of moral duty and religious obedience. Their only law of
self-restraint is founded on the fear of the courts and dread of
the displeasure of their associates. Where all unite in a crime,
and where the risk of detection is thus almost done away with,
there is not one in ten who would hesitate at its commission.
Drunkenness, profanity, dishonesty, and unchastity are the
prevalent habits which the class has acquired. What else indeed
could be expected? The original stock is the very lowest: the
blood-stained hand and ruthless heart from the most barbarian parts
of Ireland; the professional depredator from the vilest haunts of
London; the lowest slaves of profligacy, inebriation, violence, and
lust; men who have sought and found the very abysses of crime.
These are herded together, or scattered among wildernesses whither
the sound of holy counsel and spiritual caution never reached. For
three-quarters of a century they are left to fester each in his own
rankness of soul, or by contact with others to ferment into yet
more horrible conditions of pollution and iniquity. And I am sure I
may with a clear conscience say that malific as are these and other
influences which space will not admit of naming, yet infinitely
worse than all is the sense of the iron dominion exercised over
them by the masters. The free are becoming infected by the bond. I
knew of a number of young Scotch lads who on their arrival were
quite horrified at the thought of joining in the illicit slaughter
of sheep; but they did it freely enough before they were there
twelve months. Of the female emigrants by one ship which took out a
large number, I was told on good authority that there were
certainly not one seventh of the whole but what became prostitutes
in some form or other. The consequences of this, to which I cannot
more particularly allude, are direful, and its ultimate result must
be sweeping the aborigines off the face of the country where it is
settled. To delineate the other and minor points of the picture
would be useless. Suffice it to say further, that thousands never
see a bible, or hear one word of spiritual counsel from the day
they come up the country till they go down again (often many
years), or till death removes them from the scene. Now, I am
convinced that the government need but to think of this fact to
perceive how very wrong it is to take these poor creatures away
from reformatory influences and place them in such a condition as
is here described under the very pretext itself of reformation.
Good men, men of sound judgment, should be employed to go about
among them, supply them with the word of God, and with instructive
and amusing publications, converse with and advise them. Such an
arrangement would greatly restrain the inclination in the masters
to be oppressive; and it seems the only substitute which offers for
those religious means and that opportunity of observing the better
portion of society, that they are deprived of on the plea of
reformatory exile. I would say one word to the upper class on this
point. <i>There is among working men a strong and ineradicable and
very correct sense of what is fair. Unless you act fairly to them,
they will assuredly endeavour to right themselves</i>. The sense of
the risk they encounter in so doing embitters them against you; and
instead of being surrounded by faithful servants, you are in the
midst of enemies. But if you give them fair play, allow them what
nature requires to eat, pay them honestly and without shuffling
what they earn, they will necessarily look to you as their friend
and protector. You will obtain unlimited influence over their
minds, and your property and interests will be guarded in a way far
more efficient than is in your own power. Of course there will be
some less readily won by these means than others; but such is the
constitution of the human soul that finally even the most obtuse
and obdurate must succumb. These three means constitute the only
course through which a better state of things in this depraved
portion of society is to be hoped. The last section of the
population, the aborigines, I omit here, as it more properly
constitutes a head of remark in itself.</p>

<p>Fifth&mdash;The Aborigines.&mdash;Missionary efforts I for one
feel inclined to put aside, as quite useless at present; indeed
there seems something so intrinsically absurd in the nation which
is robbing another of its land and its means of subsistence
soliciting that other to adopt its religion, that the yet more
revolting concomitant of the horrible scourgings which are
inflicted on our prisoners is scarcely needed to make the
Aborigines despise and revolt from us, and to put such a case out
of court. At the same time it is quite clear to me that it is
rather the mode in which we seize and hold the soil that does the
mischief than the act in itself. The Aborigines could understand a
ten or twenty or even fifty acre settler saying, "I need this; my
own country starves me: I have come here to grow my grain, and to
support life!" But he cannot understand the 20,000 acre man with
his countless flocks and herds, and white slaves&mdash;he has no
sympathy whatever with him. Avarice and covetousness are vices
unknown to the savage; and he can only regard the man labouring
under them as one infected with some shocking and mysterious
disease. How near this is to the truth it is not for me to say. We
see the matter differently; and we suppose that in the workings and
necessities of civilized society we see at once the reason and the
vindication of its form. I believe it is so; and that the force of
contrariety in extrinsic things is the secret law of subjective
intelligent progress and so of social progress at large.
Consequently I am as much opposed to checking the advance of the
wealthy stockholder to a still further pitch of prosperity, as, on
the other hand, to debarring the poor from whatever advance is
possible to him. I look at both as conditionary elements in the
progress of the race; and feel sure that, if one be disallowed, the
other must eventually suffer. A short leg and a long leg would only
walk round and round. Just so, the more unequally common rights are
apportioned the more stationary the society will become in which
this misapportionment exists. The rich and the poor I believe to be
equally necessary; but that one of these should be deprived utterly
of a common right and the other enjoy it unrestrictedly is a great
and perilous error. The end of human existence is happiness; and
the most profoundly miserable man we know is he who is most
selfish. But when, in so great and valuable a matter as the right
to purchase land at the very offset of society, there exists such a
misapportionment among classes whose claim, to say the least, is in
nature common, there must necessarily be a rivalry induced which
leads to enmity, the sense of danger, and selfishness, if not also
to an aggressive bias. Personally I incline to think the poor has
more right to land than the rich in a new country; that his right
is the true and more fundamental right. If his own country have
borne him, but cannot find him food, he has the greatest right that
there is below divine right to go elsewhere and seek it. And it is
better for many reasons that he should go to barbarian lands and
seize a portion of the soil, sufficient for his wants, than that he
should claim any on the mere ground of birthright in his own.
Surely if any section of the people can have a right to dispossess
another people of its land, it is the starving section. In short,
unless new lands are taken possession of on the mere strength of
superior brute force, and all equitable allegations be abandoned,
the right to do so must be allowed to be founded on the necessity
in the point of sustenance. Can anything be more absurd as well as
unjust, then, than to deprive the very party in virtue of whose
necessity alone you exercise this right, of the chief benefit
accruing from it? Indeed the more the case is analyzed the more
glaring will the injustice appear. But now it will be asked, how
does this tell upon the condition of the Aborigines? The following
fact will connect the two branches of the subject: Wherever there
are these little farms where the owner cannot afford to pay white
labourers, he invariably maintains the most amicable relations with
any Aborigines about him, for the sake of obtaining their
assistance in his agricultural operations. Were this course
pursued, not only would all the advantages which I have specified
accrue to the civilized man, individually and commonly, but the
black would be benefited every way. If, in short, there is anything
to be done for the civilization of the <i>blacks</i> and to prevent
<i>their</i> utter extermination, it will be found in the
encouragement of the amicable relations which so easily establish
themselves between them and the small settler. Missionary efforts I
am afraid will long, if not always, be the "voice, and no more."
Hitherto they have been as futile as they appear to have been
zealous. If this must be ascribed partly to the deficiency of every
sense of moral obligation of the Aborigines of Australia save to
their own form of human law and custom, it must certainly also be
equally imputed as an effect to the abominations of the white man's
character, and to his conduct towards the members of his own race;
and to the bitter feeling which the blacks all experience, though
they very generally veil it, against us as a nation of robbers,
robbing out of mere wantonness, and not from the pressure of
necessity. They understand no theories about capital and labour,
and pauperism and emigration: all they feel is that they are
wronged; all they see, the fact that it is done by those who are
rich already, and do not want the soil for subsistence; not by the
poor, who might be justified.</p>

Mountain&mdash;Visit from a mock bushranger&mdash;The mounted

<p>MY desire to see my native land was certainly very strong; yet I
hardly knew how to turn my back on scenes which had become so
familiar, and so inseparable from the most delightful associations.
But the greatest difficulty, after all, was to reconcile the boys
to the separation. We could see the advantages of their remaining
behind, but they could not. None but a parent can understand the
sufferings attendant on separation from beloved children. Where it
is the act of one parent at the expense of the other, no sophism
can conceal, as no logic can extenuate the enormity of the act. And
the measure of guilt at that tribunal there is no trifling with,
will assuredly be&mdash;<i>the anguish imposed on the one party
taken along with the audacity and ignorance of right principles
manifested by the other</i>. Nor is there any thing in the universe
that can stay the utterance of the Divine decree against the
wrong-doer, saving only the "intercessions of the Spirit" with the
great Judge from the bosom of the wronged. We set off on our
coastward journey at about 4 P. M., intending to stop for the night
at my brother-in-law's station. We arrived there about halfpast
five. Next morning the heat was excessive, and clearly enough
portended a thunder-storm. This, however, is a circumstance too
common in the colony to be allowed to interrupt a journey; and as
we were travelling in the dray with a good stout canvas tilt over
it, the prospect did not much disturb us. Toward evening it got
very cloudy, and the wind chopping round more to the southward, the
air cooled. As we were making pretty good stages (20 to 30 miles a
day), we got to the other side of Bong-Bong before the weather
again became so intensely hot. But the thunder-storm came at last,
and (of course) caught us in just the wrong place. We were in one
of those narrow flats that intersect the hilly road on the Sydney
side of the Mittagong range. The cattle had been turned out to feed
for a couple of hours, and the bullock driver had just brought them
up to be yoked, when a few heavy drops of rain sprinkling down
warned us not to be in too much of a hurry to start. Then came the
usual gust of cold wind, and then a lull; and then, before we could
huddle the few clothes and cooking things that were scattered about
the grass into the dray, down came a pretty thick shower of
hail-stones. These were not very large at first, but the
reinforcement that followed was of others a little larger; then
came another gust and a thicker fall of heavier lumps, until in
about four minutes' time they were pouring down all around us in
one compact torrent as large as bantams' eggs, and seemingly to the
eye not more than the distance of their diameters from each other.
Driven by a roaring squall, their direction was much nearer
horizontal than perpendicular; and I am sure that I saw some of
them, where they fell under trees whose boughs protected them from
the fall of others, bounce full ten feet up from the ground. One
struck me on the back of the hand, as I sat inside the dray holding
together the front of the tilt, and left a bruise that was visible
for several weeks. The dogs all ran to shelter, but not without
several of them receiving knocks that set them yelping for two or
three minutes. In less than ten minutes, when the violence of the
squall subsided, the ground was covered with hail-stones to a depth
of full eight inches; and, as the heated surface melted them very
fast, torrents of mingled water and hail-stones were soon sweeping
down from the hills into the flats on every side. Yoking the
bullocks as speedily as possible, we succeeded in getting the dray
off the grassy flat on to the side of the hill, before the ground
became so saturated as to bog us, for where we had unyoked to rest
was really only a dried swamp, and became in a few minutes so
rotten that the short team of bullocks we were travelling with
would have been unable to move us off it. By this time the mizzling
rain that succeeded the hail-storm was changed to a steady fall. We
had determined to make the best of our way on to &mdash;&mdash;
Inn, and there house ourselves until finer weather; the bullock
driver on one side the team, and I on the other, were urging the
shivering and restive animals to a good pull up the pinch, when the
leader turned himself short round and ran off down the hill; the
middle bullocks followed, whilst the old shafter stood firm. The
consequence was the shaft gave way and broke off short at the body
of the dray. And there we stood, half-way up the hill in the very
middle of the road, with a dray quite useless, in the midst of a
pouring rain nearly at nightfall. Vexed as one may be on these
occasions, there is really often something so absurd about them
that to help laughing would be quite impossible. Such was the case
here. An instant ago and we were sure of a blazing fire and dry
beds for the night; and now here we were fixed, perhaps for a day
or two; the bullocks meanwhile, as if well aware of their success,
turned round and placidly looking at the broken dray, and only
waiting to be unyoked to march off and enjoy themselves. My wife,
in spite of the nonchalance of her Australian blood, looked
dumb-founded.</p>

<p>Ordering the man to take out the shafter, I hitched the other
bullocks on to the back of the dray, and dragged it back wards
across the road to the edge of the bush; and then propping it up as
well as we could, we unyoked them, put the hobbles on those that
needed them, and turned them off along the edge of the hill to
feed. The only plan for ourselves, which seemed at once practicable
and prudent, was to send the bullock driver on to the
&mdash;&mdash; Inn for a light cart; and if such a thing could be
got, then take what things we could with us, and go there and wait
until the dray was mended. This plan was executed without loss of
time. Meantime I managed to hunt, from out of one hollow log and
another, dry wood sufficient to make a good blaze in the sheltered
side of a big tree, so that we had a pretty comfortable cup of
tea.</p>

<p>By the time tea was over and I had taken a turn into the bush
and headed the bullocks all into one mob, it was quite dark. Not
another dray came along the road that night, and only one person on
foot going the opposite way from ourselves; so that I had no
opportunity of sending any messages after the man to urge him to
make haste. After sitting up till past twelve o'clock at night
expecting his return, we determined to make a virtue of necessity,
and making as much space as we could in the dray, we spread out the
bedding and went to sleep. Nothing disturbed us till the next
morning, when soon after breakfast our man came with a small dray
from the proprietor of the &mdash;&mdash; Inn, and a wheelwright
with his tools to mend the broken shaft: but the rain was still
pelting away at such a rate, and by the account of the new comers a
couple of the creeks were up to such a height, that I did not feel
any longer inclined to leave the dray, especially as the
wheelwright had brought a bit of seasoned wood with him for a
shaft, and could not be more than a few hours in completing his
job. The poor fellow was a government servant of the innkeeper's,
and for the sake of half-a-crown willingly went on with it in the
rain. We, however, made him as snug as we could, by raising one
side of the tilt and stretching it out on stakes for him to work
under.</p>

<p>In vain we looked for a change in the weather hour after hour.
Between dinner time and tea time a horseman came by from the Sydney
side, and told us the &mdash;&mdash; Creek was no longer passable
without great danger: and I had really had so many narrow escapes
in these creeks and in the rivers when they were up, that it seemed
like over-trying Providence to venture this last time I was likely
ever to have the opportunity without an urgent necessity; besides,
I knew it would take us several hours to reach the worst of the
creeks, and by that time it might be so much higher as to render
crossing entirely impracticable for anybody but a horseman or a
swimmer. As I could not have got Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; across, in
that case I should have been as had off as I was here, after all
the additional trouble. It took the wheelwright till nearly evening
to mend the dray; and by that time our bullock-driver had found out
that the bullocks had recrossed the Mittagong Range, and had headed
back for their own run in a direct line through the bush. So
night-fall again found us without any company. The wheelwright
having finished his job was gone home, intending to cross the
flooded creeks by fallen trees which he was acquainted with some
little distance off the high road, and which, as I have before
mentioned, often serve in the bush for bridges. Our bullockdriver
was off up the road again to the nearest point where he thought he
could intercept the bullocks. A little after dark we were startled
as we sat drinking our solitary cup of tea beneath the tilt by the
sounds of a draywheel and human voices coming up the country.
Presently they stopped close to us, and the overseer of the party,
which was going up into the interior with the stores and implements
of a new settler, came to our fire for a firestick; he told us they
had the body of a dead man on their dray, and did not know whether
to bury it or to carry it on to Bong-Bong. The foolish fellow had
volunteered, although no horseman, to ride across &mdash;&mdash;
creek before their dray on the overseer's horse, and show that the
ford was practicable. He was one of the men belonging to the party,
all of whom had been drinking too freely; the consequence was, that
when the horse got into deep water and began to swim, he became so
frightened that he tried to throw himself from its back and reach
the shore, in doing which his foot became entangled in the stirrup,
and the horse, impeded by his weight all on one side, was swept
ever so far down the stream, and at length stood still on the first
spot where he had foothold, with deep water all round him; and none
of the party had dared to venture to the man's assistance till it
was too late. One so rarely meets with death in New South Wales,
partly on account of its extreme salubrity, and partly on account
of the thinness of the population, that it may always be perceived
to produce a much stronger impression than is usual in old
countries. At another time the merriment of such a party as this
would have been heard ringing every now and then loud and clear
through the forest till twelve o'clock at night. But this evening
nothing disturbed the silence but the bark of their and our dogs,
and the few words of question and reply that business required. I
know of few things more solemn than thus to have death suddenly
attach himself to one's company in the bush: the necessity of
guarding the body from the bush dogs and birds of prey, its
uncoffined state, its late inhabitation by one whose voice the ear
will not even yet give up, the rarity and seeming inaptitude of
death at such a time and place, all conspire to invest it with a
singular and painful impressiveness.</p>

<p>Next day the weather was still worse; the wind was higher, and
the rain fell without the intermission of a minute. But the
succeeding day was, if possible, worse still; so that it took all
our ingenuity and all our vigilance to keep our fires in. I got so
tired of the confinement by noon, that I had no sooner lit my pipe
after dinner than I put on a very thick pair of boots and a monkey
jacket, and started for a regular stroll. Taking a leading ridge
from the road, I ran it up for about a couple of miles. Wherever I
went there was water; and the grass already, in these few hours
since the rain began, seemed to have got the green of three weeks'
spring growth. I never experienced, from anything I have met with
throughout life, such a tendency to seriousness and religious
reflection as I derive from being in the dim and lonely woods on a
rainy day; and this, combined with the novelty of the scene, after
many months of severe drought, renders such a stroll at times by no
means an unpleasant one. I got back to tea about five o'clock, and
about an hour before me the bullock-driver brought back the cattle,
which he had not done, however, without swimming. Once more we went
to bed, still listening to the wind and rain, prognosticating a
similar morrow. Great was my joy, on waking in the night, to hear
by the cheery roar of the fire that a wind unaccompanied by rain
was at last blowing; and still greater when, on looking from out of
our temporary house, I could see here and there a star glimmering
through the boughs overhead. Morning brought with it a warm, bright
sun; and by evening the creeks were so much abated that we felt
sure of being able to pursue our journey on the morrow. One more
night of confinement, and we were again on our way.</p>

<p>Everything went on with us just in the usual course of travel
till we came to Stonequarry, where an incident occurred which,
little as it would command notice in the colony, may yet be
considered worthy of narration to the English reader, as affording
him another picture of Australian manners. About two days' stage
from Sydney is the Razorback Mountain, a very high and broken
range, over which the road is led. Thinking we could get our
bullocks over it if we gave them a good long spell in the
afternoon, we began its ascent about five P.M. They knocked up,
however, before we got above two-thirds of the way up, and neither
flogging nor coaxing could get them any farther. The consequence
was, that we were obliged to unyoke, and the bullock-driver took
them off down the range again to water. By the time this was done
it was quite dark. We had plenty of water for our own consumption
in the water-keg (which most drays carry when on the road); and
whilst I put down at the wood-fire a couple of quart-pots for tea,
my wife made some fat-cakes in the frying-pan. Just as we were
sitting down to our meal, a man, having the look of a traveller,
and one of the poorest, walked up to the fire and asked leave to
light his pipe, and then inquired how far it was to such a place.
Thinking that probably he was some free man who had been to Sydney
to drink the few pounds he had saved out of a year's wages, and was
now travelling penniless and hungry up the country again in search
of work, I told him to sit down with us and have his tea. This,
with a show of much awkward bashfulness, he did. When supper was
over, he took out a very short pipe, in which it was evident there
was no tobacco, and went through the form of lighting it. Still
supposing him some hapless spendthrift, I took a whole fig of
negro-head tobacco out of my pocket and gave it him. Upon this he
whispered me that he wished to speak with me in private. Following
him off a little way into the bush, he told me that he was a
bushranger; and, mentioning several of a gang whose names just at
that time were notorious enough in the vicinity of Razor-back and
the Nepean River, he inquired very anxiously whether I had met or
heard of them anywhere on the road; then who the female was that
was travelling with me; and lastly, saying that he had a companion
a short distance below, hiding in the creek, who had had nothing to
eat that day, he begged most earnestly for a little flour to make a
cake, as we had no bread ready baked. I must confess that, during
my whole sojourn in the colony, it had seemed to me impossible to
deny the starving outlaw a bit of bread. There is, indeed, a very
severe colonial enactment against it. But I always found my betters
so readily breaking the laws of the land when they imagined them to
run counter to their own "law of honour," that I never found the
slightest difficulty in my own particular case about making the
same exception in favour of the law of nature; and most
unquestionably it is much more unnatural to let the man starve,
than to let the thief go unpunished. As long, therefore, as Members
of the Council fought duels, I conceived myself at liberty to
relieve the starving outlaw; of course not unnecessarily, or
forwardly, but only in extreme and unsought cases. And as this
seemed to be such a case, I told the unknown that I should give him
a bit, and bade him wait a little way down the road for it. Quickly
filling a little bag, I walked off with it to where I had told him
to wait; but on my way bethought myself that it would be best, lest
he should be taken with it in his possession, not to let him have
the bag, but the flour only. For I knew that if he were taken and
terrified into informing against me, nobody could swear to the
flour, but they might to the bag. Under this impression, on
reaching him I insisted, much against his inclination, that he
should take the flour away in something else than my bag; which at
last he consented to do, by taking off his shirt and making a bag
by tying up one of the sleeves at the wristband. Feeling I had done
all that humanity dictated, I was in a few minutes back at the
fire, and heard or saw no more of my visitor that night. To
conclude this adventure I must carry the reader on about three
weeks. A day or two before I sailed for Europe, I had occasion to
ride out one morning to Paramatta. Jogging leisurely along the high
road in the light of a fine clear sunny day, I met riding towards
Sydney, at about the same pace, three mounted policemen. As we rode
up within a few feet of each other there sat my bushranger in full
uniform, on the middle horse. He had recognised me before I
recognised him. His face was the colour of crimson, and he kept his
eyes fixed on the pommel of his saddle; whilst his comrades, I saw,
could with difficulty restrain their laughter. Moustaches are
universally worn by the mounted police; but he was shaved. I had
therefore bestowed my charity on a spy. I heard on mentioning it
that this practice of policemen going to huts and drays in disguise
is becoming much more common than it is creditable. It is by no
means agreeable to have the most unguarded sayings and doings of
one's own fireside carried, even if they be legally faultless, to a
police magistrate. It is one of those practices which the
administration of British law can certainly do without.</p>

<p>To conclude:&mdash;The morning after the earlier portion of this
incident, we made good our passage over the mountain; reached
within eight miles of Liverpool that night; and next day made a
long stage into the city of Sydney. Thenceforward there occurred
nothing so novel or so entertaining as to merit description.</p>
