  <h2><a name="fore"
     id="fore">FOREWORD &mdash; THE FROGS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was of interest to those who study the psychology of the
  mass that, until the prosperous but otherwise insignificant James G. Bliss
  became the object of their attention, the doings and growth of the Frogs were
  almost unnoticed. There were strong references in some of the country
  newspapers to the lawless character of the association; one Sunday journal
  had an amusing article headed:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">"TRAMPS' TRADE UNION TAKES FROG FOR SYMBOL OF MYSTIC
  ORDER"</p><br>

  <p>It gave a humorous and quite fanciful extract from its rules and ritual.
  The average man made casual references: "I say, have you seen this story
  about the tramps' Union&mdash;every member a walking delegate?..."</p>

  <p>There was a more serious leading article on the growth of trade unionism,
  in which the Frogs were cited, and although from time to time came accounts
  of mysterious outrages which had been put to the discredit of the Frogs, the
  generality of citizens regarded the society, order, or whatever it was, as
  something benevolent in its intentions and necessarily eccentric in its
  constitution, and, believing this, were in their turn benevolently tolerant.
  In some such manner as the mass may learn with mild interest of a distant
  outbreak of epidemic disease, which slays its few, and wake one morning to
  find the sinister malady tapping at their front doors, so did the world
  become alive and alarmed at the terror-growth which suddenly loomed from the
  mists.</p>

  <p>James G. Bliss was a hardware merchant, and a man well known on exchange,
  where he augmented the steady profits of the Bliss General Hardware
  Corporation with occasional windfalls from legitimate speculation. A somewhat
  pompous and, in argument, aggressive person, he had the advantage which
  mediocrity, blended with a certain expansive generosity, gives to a man, in
  that he had no enemies; and since his generosity was run on sane business
  principles, it could not even be said of him, as is so often said of others,
  that his worst enemy was himself. He held, and still holds, the bulk of the
  stock in the B.G.H. Corporation&mdash;a fact which should be noted because it
  was a practice of Mr. Bliss to manipulate from time to time the price of his
  shares by judicious operations. It was at a time coincident with the little
  boom in industrials which brought Bliss Hardware stock at a jump from 12.50
  to 23.75, that the strange happening occurred which focussed for the moment
  all eyes upon the Frogs.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bliss has a country place at Long Beach, Hampshire. It is referred to
  as "The Hut," but is the sort of hut that King Solomon might have built for
  the Queen of Sheba, had that adventurous man been sufficiently well
  acquainted with modern plumbing, the newest systems of heating and lighting,
  and the exigent requirements of up-to-date chauffeurs. In these respects Mr.
  Bliss was wiser than Solomon.</p>

  <p>He had returned to his country home after a strenuous day in the City, and
  was walking in the garden in the cool of the evening. He was (and is)
  married, but his wife and two daughters were spending the spring in
  Paris&mdash;a wise course, since the spring is the only season when Paris has
  the slightest pretensions to being a beautiful city.</p>

  <p>He had come from his kennels, and was seen walking across the home park
  toward a covert which bordered his property. Hearing a scream, his kennel man
  and a groom ran toward the wood, to discover Bliss lying on the ground
  unconscious, his face and shoulders covered with blood. He had been struck
  down by some heavy weapon: there were a slight fracture of the parietal bone
  and several very ugly scalp wounds.</p>

  <p>For three weeks this unfortunate man hovered between life and death,
  unconscious except at intervals, and unable during his lucid moments to throw
  any light on, or make any coherent statement concerning, the assault, except
  to murmur, "Frog... frog... left arm... frog."</p>

  <p>It was the first of many similar outrages, seemingly purposeless and
  wanton, in no case to be connected with robbery, and invariably (except once)
  committed upon people who occupied fairly unimportant positions in the social
  hierarchy. The Frogs advanced instantly to a first-class topic. The disease
  was found to be widespread, and men who had read, light-heartedly, of minor
  victimizations, began to bolt their own doors and carry lethal weapons when
  they went abroad at nights.</p>

  <p>And they were wise, for there was a force in being that had been born in
  fear and had matured in obscurity (to the wonder of its creator) so that it
  wielded the tyrannical power of governments.</p>

  <p>In the centre of many ramifications sat the Frog, drunk with authority,
  merciless, terrible. One who lived two lives and took full pleasure from
  both, and all the time nursing the terror that Saul Morris had inspired one
  foggy night in London, when the grimy streets were filled with armed
  policemen looking for the man who cleaned the strong-room of the S.S.
  <i>Mantania</i> of three million pounds between the port of Southampton and
  the port of Cherbourg.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap01"
     id="chap01">I. &mdash; AT MAYTREE COTTAGE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A dry radiator coincided with a burst tyre. The second
  coincidence was the proximity of Maytree Cottage on the Horsham Road. The
  cottage was larger than most, with a timbered front and a thatched roof.
  Standing at the gate, Richard Gordon stopped to admire. The house dated back
  to the days of Elizabeth, but his interest and admiration were not those of
  the antiquary.</p>

  <p>Nor, though he loved flowers, of the horticulturist, though the broad
  garden was a patchwork of colour and the fragrance of cabbage roses came to
  delight his senses. Nor was it the air of comfort and cleanliness that
  pervaded the place, the scrubbed red-brick pathway that led to the door, the
  spotless curtains behind leaded panes.</p>

  <p>It was the girl, in the red-lined basket chair, that arrested his gaze.
  She sat on a little lawn in the shade of a mulberry tree, with her shapely
  young limbs stiffly extended, a book in her hand, a large box of chocolates
  by her side. Her hair, the colour of old gold, an old gold that held life and
  sheen; a flawless complexion, and, when she turned her head in his direction,
  a pair of grave, questioning eyes, deeper than grey, yet greyer than
  blue...</p>

  <p>She drew up her feet hurriedly and rose.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry to disturb you,"&mdash;Dick, hat in hand, smiled his
  apology&mdash;"but I want water for my poor little Lizzie. She's developed a
  prodigious thirst."</p>

  <p>She frowned for a second, and then laughed.</p>

  <p>"Lizzie&mdash;you mean a car? If you'll come to the back of the cottage
  I'll show you where the well is."</p>

  <p>He followed, wondering who she was. The tiny hint of patronage in her tone
  he understood. It was the tone of matured girlhood addressing a boy of her
  own age. Dick, who was thirty and looked eighteen, with his smooth, boyish
  face, had been greeted in that "little boy" tone before, and was inwardly
  amused.</p>

  <p>"Here is the bucket and that is the well," she pointed. "I would send a
  maid to help you, only we haven't a maid, and never had a maid, and I don't
  think ever shall have a maid!"</p>

  <p>"Then some maid has missed a very good job," said Dick, "for this garden
  is delightful."</p>

  <p>She neither agreed nor dissented. Perhaps she regretted the familiarity
  she had shown. She conveyed to him an impression of aloofness, as she watched
  the process of filling the buckets, and when he carried them to the car on
  the road outside, she followed.</p>

  <p>"I thought it was a&mdash;a&mdash;what did you call it&mdash;Lizzie?"</p>

  <p>"She is Lizzie to me," said Dick stoutly as he filled the radiator of the
  big Rolls, "and she will never be anything else. There are people who think
  she should be called 'Diana,' but those high-flown names never had any
  attraction for me. She is Liz&mdash;and will always be Liz."</p>

  <p>She walked round the machine, examining it curiously.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you afraid to be driving a big car like that?" she asked. "I
  should be scared to death. It is so tremendous and...and unmanageable."</p>

  <p>Dick paused with a bucket in hand.</p>

  <p>"Fear," he boasted, "is a word which I have expunged from the bright
  lexicon of my youth."</p>

  <p>For a second puzzled, she began to laugh softly.</p>

  <p>"Did you come by way of Welford?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you saw my father on the road?"</p>

  <p>"I saw nobody on the road except a sour-looking gentleman of middle age
  who was breaking the Sabbath by carrying a large brown box on his back."</p>

  <p>"Where did you pass him?" she asked, interested.</p>

  <p>"Two miles away&mdash;less than that." And then, a doubt intruding: "I
  hope that I wasn't describing your parent?"</p>

  <p>"It sounds rather like him," she said without annoyance. "Daddy is a
  naturalist photographer. He takes moving pictures of birds and
  things&mdash;he is an amateur, of course."</p>

  <p>"Of course," agreed Dick.</p>

  <p>He brought the buckets back to where he had found them and lingered.
  Searching for an excuse, he found it in the garden. How far he might have
  exploited this subject is a matter for conjecture. Interruption came in the
  shape of a young man who emerged from the front door of the cottage. He was
  tall and athletic, good-looking...Dick put his age at twenty.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Ella! Father back?" he began, and then saw the visitor.</p>

  <p>"This is my brother," said the girl, and Dick Gordon nodded. He was
  conscious that this free-and-easy method of getting acquainted was due
  largely, if not entirely, to his youthful appearance. To be treated as an
  inconsiderable boy had its advantages. And so it appeared.</p>

  <p>"I was telling him that boys ought not to be allowed to drive big cars,"
  she said. "You remember the awful smash there was at the Shoreham cross
  roads?"</p>

  <p>Ray Bennett chuckled.</p>

  <p>"This is all part of a conspiracy to keep me from getting a motor-
  bicycle. Father thinks I'll kill somebody, and Ella thinks I'll kill
  myself."</p>

  <p>Perhaps there was something in Dick Gordon's quick smile that warned the
  girl that she had been premature in her appraisement of his age, for
  suddenly, almost abruptly, she nodded an emphatic dismissal and turned away.
  Dick was at the gate when a further respite arrived. It was the man he had
  passed on the road. Tall, loose-framed, grey and gaunt of face, he regarded
  the stranger with suspicion in his deep-set eyes.</p>

  <p>"Good morning," he said curtly. "Car broken down?"</p>

  <p>"No, thank you. I ran out of water, and Miss&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bennett," said the man. "She gave you the water, eh? Well, good
  morning."</p>

  <p>He stood aside to let Gordon pass, but Dick opened the gate and waited
  till the owner of Maytree Cottage had entered.</p>

  <p>"My name is Gordon," he said. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Ella had
  turned back and stood with her brother within earshot. "I am greatly obliged
  to you for your kindness." The old man, with a nod, went on carrying his
  heavy burden into the house, and Dick in desperation turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"You are wrong when you think this is a difficult car to drive&mdash;
  won't you experiment? Or perhaps your brother?"</p>

  <p>The girl hesitated, but not so young Bennett.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to try," he said eagerly. "I've never handled a big
  machine."</p>

  <p>That he could handle one if the opportunity came, he showed. They watched
  the car gliding round the corner, the girl with a little frown gathering
  between her eyes, Dick Gordon oblivious to everything except that he had
  snatched a few minutes' closer association with the girl. He was behaving
  absurdly, he told himself. He, a public official, an experienced lawyer, was
  carrying on like an irresponsible, love-smitten youth of nineteen. The girl's
  words emphasized his folly.</p>

  <p>"I wish you hadn't let Ray drive," she said. "It doesn't help a boy who is
  always wanting something better, to put him in charge of a beautiful
  car...perhaps you don't understand me. Ray is very ambitious and dreams in
  millions. A thing like this unsettles him."</p>

  <p>The older man came out at that moment, a black pipe between his teeth,
  and, seeing the two at the gate, a cloud passed over his face.</p>

  <p>"Let him drive your car, have you?" he said grimly. "I wish you
  hadn't&mdash;it was very kind of you, Mr. Gordon, but in Ray's case a
  mistaken kindness."</p>

  <p>"I'm very sorry," said the penitent Dick. "Here he comes!" The big car
  spun toward them and halted before the gate.</p>

  <p>"She's a beauty!"</p>

  <p>Ray Bennett jumped out and looked at the machine with admiration and
  regret.</p>

  <p>"My word, if she were mine!"</p>

  <p>"She isn't," snapped the old man, and then, as though regretting his
  petulance: "Some day perhaps you'll own a fleet, Ray&mdash;are you going to
  London, Mr. Gordon?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you wouldn't care to stop and eat a very frugal meal with us?"
  asked the elder Bennett, to his surprise and joy. "And you'll be able to tell
  this foolish son of mine that owning a big car isn't all joy-riding."</p>

  <p>Dick's first impression was of the girl's astonishment. Apparently he was
  unusually honoured, and this was confirmed after John Bennett had left
  them.</p>

  <p>"You're the first boy that has ever been asked to dinner," she said when
  they were alone. "Isn't he, Ray?" Ray smiled.</p>

  <p>"Dad doesn't go in for the social life, and that's a fact," he said. "I
  asked him to have Philo Johnson down for a week-end, and he killed the idea
  before it was born. And the old philosopher is a good fellow and the boss's
  confidential secretary. You've heard of Maitlands Consolidated, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded. The marble palace on the Strand Embankment in which the
  fabulously rich Mr. Maitland operated, was one of the show buildings of
  London.</p>

  <p>"I'm in his office&mdash;exchange clerk," said the young man, "and Philo
  could do a whole lot for me if dad would pull out an invitation. As it is, I
  seem doomed to be a clerk for the rest of my life."</p>

  <p>The white hand of the girl touched his lips.</p>

  <p>"You'll be rich some day, Ray dear, and it is foolish to blame daddy."</p>

  <p>The young man growled something under the hand, and then laughed a little
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>"Dad has tried every get-rich-quick scheme that the mind and ingenuity of
  man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And why?"</p>

  <p>The voice was harsh, tremulous with anger. None of them had noticed the
  reappearance of John Bennett.</p>

  <p>"You're doing work you don't like. My God! What of me? I've been trying
  for twenty years to get out. I've tried every silly scheme&mdash;that's true.
  But it was for you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped abruptly at the sight of Gordon's embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"I invited you to dinner, and I'm pulling out the family skeleton," he
  said with rough good-humour.</p>

  <p>He took Dick's arm and led him down the garden path between the serried
  ranks of rose bushes.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I asked you to stay, young man," he said. "An impulse, I
  suppose... maybe a bad conscience. I don't give these young people all the
  company they ought to have at home, and I'm not much of a companion for them.
  It's too bad that you should be the witness of the first family jar we've had
  for years."</p>

  <p>His voice and manner were those of an educated man. Dick wondered what
  occupation he followed, and why it should be so particularly obnoxious that
  he should be seeking some escape.</p>

  <p>The girl was quiet throughout the meal. She sat at Dick's left hand and
  she spoke very seldom. Stealing an occasional glance at her, he thought she
  looked preoccupied and troubled, and blamed his presence as the cause.</p>

  <p>Apparently no servant was kept at the cottage. She did the waiting
  herself, and she had replaced the plates when the old man asked:</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think you were as young as you look, Mr. Gordon&mdash;what do
  you do for a living?"</p>

  <p>"I'm quite old," smiled Dick. "Thirty-one."</p>

  <p>"Thirty-one?" gasped Ella, going red. "And I've been talking to you as
  though you were a child!"</p>

  <p>"Think of me as a child at heart," he said gravely. "As to my
  occupation&mdash;I'm a persecutor of thieves and murderers and bad characters
  generally. My name is Richard Gordon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The knife fell with a clatter from John Bennett's hand and his face went
  white.</p>

  <p>"Gordon&mdash;Richard Gordon?" he said hollowly.</p>

  <p>For a second their eyes met, the clear blue and the faded blue.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I am the Assistant Director of Prosecutions," said Gordon
  quietly. "And I have an idea that you and I have met before."</p>

  <p>The pale eyes did not waver. John Bennett's face was a mask.</p>

  <p>"Not professionally, I hope," he said, and there was a challenge in his
  voice.</p>

  <p>Dick laughed again as at the absurdity of the question. "Not
  professionally," he said with mock gravity.</p>

  <p>On his way back to London that night his memory worked overtime, but he
  failed to place John Bennett of Horsham.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02">II. &mdash; A TALK ABOUT FROGS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Maitlands Consolidated had grown from one small office to
  its present palatial proportions in a comparatively short space of time.
  Maitland was a man advanced in years, patriarchal in appearance, sparing of
  speech. He had arrived in London unheralded, and had arrived, in the less
  accurate sense of the word, before London was aware of his existence.</p>

  <p>Dick Gordon saw the speculator for the first time as he was waiting in the
  marble-walled vestibule. A man of middle height, bearded to his waist; his
  eyes almost hidden under heavy white brows; stout and laborious of gait, he
  came slowly through the outer office, where a score of clerks sat working
  under their green-shaded lamps, and, looking neither to the right nor left,
  walked into the elevator and was lost to view.</p>

  <p>"That is the old man: have you seen him before?" asked Ray Bennett, who
  had come out to meet the caller a second before. "He's a venerable old cuss,
  but as tight as a soundproof door. You couldn't pry money from him, not if
  you used dynamite! He pays Philo a salary that the average secretary wouldn't
  look at, and if Philo wasn't such an easygoing devil, he'd have left years
  ago."</p>

  <p>Dick Gordon was feeling a little uncomfortable. His presence at Maitlands
  was freakish, his excuse for calling as feeble as any weak brain could
  conceive. If he had spoken the truth to the flattered young man on whom he
  called in business hours, he would have said: "I have idiotically fallen in
  love with your sister. I am not especially interested in you, but I regard
  you as a line that will lead me to another meeting, therefore I have made my
  being in the neighbourhood an excuse for calling. And because of this insane
  love I have for your sister, I am willing to meet even Philo, who will surely
  bore me." Instead he said:</p>

  <p>"You are a friend of Philo&mdash;why do you call him that?"</p>

  <p>"Because he's a philosophical old horse&mdash;his other name is Philip,"
  said the other with a twinkle in his eye. "Everybody is a friend of
  Philo's&mdash;he's the kind of man that makes friendship easy."</p>

  <p>The elevator door opened at that moment and a man came out. Instinctively
  Dick Gordon knew that this bald and middle-aged man with the good-humoured
  face was the subject of their discussion. His round, fat face creased in a
  smile as he recognized Ray, and after he had handed a bundle of documents to
  one of the clerks, he came over to where they were standing.</p>

  <p>"Meet Mr. Gordon," said Ray. "This is my friend Johnson." Philo grasped
  the extended hand warmly. "Warm" was a word which had a special significance
  in relation to Mr. Johnson. He seemed to radiate a warming and quickening
  influence. Even Dick Gordon, who was not too ready to respond, came under the
  immediate influence of his geniality.</p>

  <p>"You're Mr. Gordon of the Public Prosecution Department&mdash;Ray was
  telling me," he said. "I should like you to come one day and prosecute old
  man Maitland! He is certainly the most prosecutable gentleman I've met for
  years!"</p>

  <p>The jest tickled Mr. Johnson. He was, thought Dick, inclined to laugh at
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I've got to get back: he's in a tantrum this morning. Anyone would think
  the Frogs were after him."</p>

  <p>Philo Johnson, with a cheery nod, hurried back to the lift. Was it
  imagination on Dick's part? He could have sworn the face of Ray Bennett was a
  deeper shade of red, and that there was a look of anxiety in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It's very good of you to keep your promise and call...yes, I'll be glad
  to lunch with you, Gordon. And my sister will also, I'm sure. She is often in
  town."</p>

  <p>His adieux were hurried and somewhat confused. Dick Gordon went out into
  the street puzzled. Of one thing he was certain: that behind the young man's
  distress lay that joking reference to the Frogs.</p>

  <p>When he returned to his office, still sore with himself that he had acted
  rather like a moon-calf or a farm hand making his awkward advances to the
  village belle, he found a troubled-looking chief of police waiting for him,
  and at the sight of him Dick's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked. "What of Genter?"</p>

  <p>The police chief made a grimace like one who was swallowing an unpleasant
  potion.</p>

  <p>"They slipped me," he said. "The Frog arrived in a car&mdash;I wasn't
  prepared for that. Genter got in, and they were gone before I realized what
  had happened. Not that I'm worried. Genter has a gun, and he's a pretty tough
  fellow in a rough house."</p>

  <p>Dick Gordon stared at and through the man, and then: "I think you should
  have been prepared for the car," he said. "If Genter's message was well
  founded, and he is on the track of the Frog, you should have expected a car.
  Sit down, Wellingdale."</p>

  <p>The grey-haired man obeyed.</p>

  <p>"I'm not excusing myself," he growled. "The Frogs have got me rattled. I
  treated them as a joke once."</p>

  <p>"Maybe we'd be wiser if we treated them as a joke now," suggested Dick,
  biting off the end of a cigar. "They may be nothing but a foolish secret
  society. Even tramps are entitled to their lodges and pass-words, grips and
  signs." Wellingdale shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You can't get away from the record of the past seven years," he said. "It
  isn't the fact that every other bad road-criminal we pull in has the frog
  tattooed on his wrist. That might be sheer imitation&mdash;and, in any case,
  all crooks of low mentality have tattoo marks. But in that seven years we've
  had a series of very unpleasant crimes. First there was the attack upon the
  chargé d'affaires of the United States Embassy&mdash;bludgeoned to sleep in
  Hyde Park. Then there was the case of the President of the Northern Trading
  Company&mdash;clubbed as he was stepping out of his car in Park Lane. Then
  the big fire which destroyed the Mersey Rubber Stores, where four million
  pounds' worth of raw rubber went up in smoke. Obviously the work of a dozen
  fire bugs, for the stores consist of six big warehouses and each was fired
  simultaneously and in two places. And the Frogs were in it. We caught two of
  the men for the Rubber job; they were both 'Frogs' and bore the totem of the
  tribe&mdash;they were both ex-convicts, and one of them admitted that he had
  had instructions to carry out the job, but took back his words next day. I
  never saw a man more scared than he was. And I can't blame him. If half that
  is said about the Frog is true, his admission cost him something. There it
  is, Mr. Gordon. I can give you a dozen cases. Genter has been two years on
  their track. He has been tramping the country, sleeping under hedges, hogging
  in with all sorts of tramps, stealing rides with them and thieving with them;
  and when he wrote me and said he had got into touch with the organization and
  expected to be initiated, I thought we were near to getting them. I've had
  Genter shadowed since he struck town. I'm sick about this morning."</p>

  <p>Dick Gordon opened a drawer of his desk, took out a leather folder and
  turned the leaves of its contents. They consisted of pages of photographs of
  men's wrists. He studied them carefully, as though he were looking at them
  for the first time, though, in truth, he had examined these records of
  captured men almost every day for years. Then he closed the portfolio
  thoughtfully and put it away in the drawer. For a few minutes he sat,
  drumming his fingers on the edge of the writing-table, a frown on his
  youthful face.</p>

  <p>"The frog is always on the left wrist, always a little lob-sided, and
  there is always one small blob tattooed underneath," he said. "Does that
  strike you as being remarkable?"</p>

  <p>The Superintendent, who was not a brilliant man, saw nothing remarkable in
  the fact.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap03"
     id="chap03">III. &mdash; THE FROG</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was growing dark when the two tramps, skirting the
  village of Morby, came again to the post road. The circumvention of Morby had
  been a painful and tiring business, for the rain which had been falling all
  day had transformed the ploughed fields into glutinous brown seas that made
  walking a test of patience.</p>

  <p>One was tall, unshaven, shabby, his faded brown coat was buttoned to his
  chin, his sagged and battered hat rested on the back of his head. His
  companion seemed short by comparison, though he was a well-made, broad-
  shouldered man, above the average height.</p>

  <p>They spoke no word as they plodded along the muddy road. Twice the shorter
  man stopped and peered backward in the gathering darkness, as though
  searching for a pursuer, and once he clutched the big man's arm and drew him
  to hiding behind the bushes that fringed the road. This was when a car tore
  past with a roar and a splattering of liquid mud.</p>

  <p>After a while they turned off the road, and crossing a field, came to the
  edge of a wild waste of land traversed by an ancient cart track.</p>

  <p>"We're nearly there," growled the smaller man, and the other grunted. But
  for all his seeming indifference, his keen eyes were taking in every detail
  of the scene. Solitary building on the horizon...looked like a barn. Essex
  County (he guessed this from the indicator number on the car that had
  passed); waste land probably led to a disused clay pit...or was it quarry?
  There was an old notice-board fixed to a groggy post near the gate through
  which the cart track passed. It was too dark to read the faded lettering, but
  he saw the word "lime." Limestone? It would be easy to locate.</p>

  <p>The only danger was if the Frogs were present in force. Under cover of his
  overcoat, he felt for the Browning and slipped it into his overcoat
  pocket.</p>

  <p>If the Frogs were in strength, there might be a tough fight. Help there
  was none. He never expected there would be. Carlo had picked him up on the
  outskirts of the city in his disreputable car, and had driven him through the
  rain, tacking and turning, following secondary roads, avoiding towns and
  hamlets, so that, had he been sitting by the driver's side, he might have
  grown confused. But he was not. He was sitting in the darkness of the little
  van, and saw nothing. Wellingdale, with the shadows who had been watching
  him, had not been prepared for the car. A tramp with a motorcar was a
  monstrosity. Even Genter himself was taken aback when the car drew up to the
  pavement where he was waiting, and the voice of Carlo hissed, "Jump in!"</p>

  <p>They crossed the crest of a weed-grown ridge. Below, Genter saw a stretch
  of ground littered with rusting trollies, twisted Decourville rails, and
  pitted with deep, rain-filled holes. Beyond, on the sharp line of the
  quarry's edge, was a small wooden hut, and towards this Carlo led the
  way.</p>

  <p>"Not nervous, are you?" he asked, and there was a sneer in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Not very," said the other coolly. "I suppose the fellows are in that
  shack?"</p>

  <p>Carlo laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"There are no others," he said, "only the Frog himself. He comes up the
  quarry face&mdash;there's a flight of steps that come up under the hut. Good
  idea, eh? The hut hangs over the edge, and you can't even see the steps, not
  if you hang over. I tried once. They'd never catch him, not if they brought
  forty million cops."</p>

  <p>"Suppose they surrounded the quarry?" suggested Genter, but the man
  scoffed.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't he know it was being surrounded before he came in? He knows
  everything, does the Frog." He looked down at the other's hand.</p>

  <p>"It won't hurt," he said, "and it's worth it if it does! You'll never be
  without a friend again, Harry. If you get into trouble, there's always the
  best lawyer to defend you. And you're the kind of chap we're looking
  for&mdash;there is plenty of trash. Poor fools that want to get in for the
  sake of the pickings. But you'll get big work, and if you do a special job
  for him, there's hundreds and hundreds of money for you. If you're hungry or
  ill, the Frogs will find you out and help you. That's pretty good, ain't
  it?"</p>

  <p>Genter said nothing. They were within a dozen yards of the hut now, a
  strong structure built of stout timber bulks, with one door and a shuttered
  window.</p>

  <p>Motioning Genter to remain where he was, the man called Carlo went forward
  and tapped on the door. Genter heard a voice, and then he saw the man step to
  the window, and the shutter open an inch. There followed a long conversation
  in an undertone, and then Carlo came back.</p>

  <p>"He says he has a job for you that will bring in a thousand&mdash;you're
  lucky! Do you know Rochmore?"</p>

  <p>Genter nodded. He knew that aristocratic suburb.</p>

  <p>"There's a man there that has got to be coshed. He comes home from his
  club every night by the eleven-five. Walks to his house. It is up a dark
  road, and a fellow could get him with a club without trouble. Just one smack
  and he's finished. It's not killing, you understand."</p>

  <p>"Why does he want me to do it?" asked the tall tramp curiously.</p>

  <p>The explanation was logical.</p>

  <p>"All new fellows have to do something to show their pluck and
  straightness. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>Genter had not hesitated. "I'll do it," he said.</p>

  <p>Carlo returned to the window, and presently he called his companion.</p>

  <p>"Stand here and put your left arm through the window," he ordered.</p>

  <p>Genter pulled back the cuff of his soddened coat and thrust his bare arm
  through the opening. His hand was caught in a firm grip, and immediately he
  felt something soft and wet pressed against his wrist. A rubber stamp, he
  noted mentally, and braced himself for the pain which would follow. It came,
  the rapid pricking of a thousand needles, and he winced. Then the grip on his
  hand relaxed and he withdrew it, to look wonderingly on the blurred design of
  ink and blood that the tattooer had left.</p>

  <p>"Don't wipe it," said a muffled voice from the darkness of the hut. "Now
  you may come in."</p>

  <p>The shutter closed and was bolted. Then came the snick of a lock turning
  and the door opened. Genter went into the pitch-black darkness of the hut and
  heard the door locked by the unseen occupant.</p>

  <p>"Your number is K 971," said the hollow voice. "When you see that in the
  personal column of The Times, you report here, wherever you are. Take
  that..."</p>

  <p>Genter put out his hand and an envelope was placed in his outstretched
  palm. It was as though the mysterious Frog could see, even in that
  blackness.</p>

  <p>"There is journey money and a map of the district. If you spend the
  journey money, or if you fail to come when you are wanted, you will be
  killed. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You will find other money&mdash;that you can use for your expenses. Now
  listen. At Rochmore, 17 Park Avenue, lives Hallwell Jones, the banker&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>He must have sensed the start of surprise which the recruit gave.</p>

  <p>"You know him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;worked for him years ago," said Genter. Stealthily, he drew his
  Browning from his pocket and thumbed down the safety catch.</p>

  <p>"Between now and Friday he has to be clubbed. You need not kill him. If
  you do, it doesn't matter. I expect his head's too hard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Genter located the man now, and, growing accustomed to the darkness,
  guessed rather than saw the bulk of him. Suddenly his hand shot out and
  grasped the arm of the Frog.</p>

  <p>"I've got a gun and I'll shoot," he said between his teeth. "I want you,
  Frog! I am Inspector Genter from police headquarters, and if you resist I'll
  kill you!"</p>

  <p>For a second there was a deathly silence. Then Genter felt his pistol
  wrist seized in a vice-like grip. He struck out with his other hand, but the
  man stooped and the blow fell in the air, and then with a wrench the pistol
  was forced out of the big man's hand and he closed with his prisoner. So
  doing, his face touched the Frog's. Was it a mask he was wearing?...The cold
  mica goggles came against his cheek. That accounted for the muffled
  voice...</p>

  <p>Powerful as he was, he could not break away from the arms which encircled
  him, and they struggled backward and forward in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the Frog lifted his foot, and Genter, anticipating the kick,
  swerved round. There was a crash of broken glass, and then something came to
  the detective&mdash;a faint but pungent odour. He tried to breathe, but found
  himself strangling, and his arms fell feebly by his side.</p>

  <p>The Frog held him for a minute, and then let the limp figure tall with a
  thud to the ground. In the morning a London police patrol found the body of
  Inspector Genter lying in the garden of an empty house, and rang for an
  ambulance. But a man who has been gassed by the concentrated fumes of
  hydrocyanic acid dies very quickly, and Genter had been dead ten seconds
  after the Frog smashed the thin class cylinder which he kept in the hut for
  such emergencies as these.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap04"
     id="chap04">IV. &mdash; ELK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was no detective in the world who looked less like a
  police officer, and a clever police officer, than Elk. He was tall and thin,
  and a slight stoop accentuated his weediness. His clothes seemed ill-fitting,
  and hung upon rather than fitted him. His dark, cadaverous face was set
  permanently in an expression of the deepest gloom, and few had ever seen him
  smile. His superiors found him generally a depressing influence, for his
  outlook on life was prejudiced and apparently embittered by his failure to
  secure promotion. Faulty education stood in his way here. Ten times he had
  come up for examination, and ten times he had failed, invariably in the same
  subject&mdash;history.</p>

  <p>Dick, who knew him better than his immediate chiefs, guessed that these
  failures did not worry Mr. Elk as much as people thought. Indeed, he often
  detected a glum pride in his inability to remember historical dates, and
  once, in a moment of astonishing confidence, Elk had confessed that promotion
  would be an embarrassment to a man of his limited educational attainments.
  For Elk's everyday English was one of his weaknesses.</p>

  <p>"There's no rest for the wicked, Mr. Gordon," he sighed as he sat down. "I
  thought I'd get a holiday after my trip to the U.S.A."</p>

  <p>"I want to know all about Lola Bassano&mdash;who are her friends, why she
  has suddenly attached herself to Raymond Bennett, a clerk in the employ of
  Maitlands Consolidated. Particularly why she picked him up at the corner of
  St. James's Square and drove him to Horsham last night. I saw them by
  accident as I was coming out of my club, and followed. They sat in her coupe
  for the greater part of two hours within a hundred yards of Bennett's house,
  and they were talking. I know, because I stood in the rain behind the car,
  listening. If he had been making love to her I should have understood&mdash;a
  little. But they were talking, and talking money. I heard certain sums
  mentioned. At four o'clock he got out of the car and went into his house, and
  Lola drove off."</p>

  <p>Elk, puffing, sadly shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Lola wouldn't talk about anything but money anyway," he said. "She's like
  Queen What's-her-name who died in 1077, or maybe it was 1573. She married
  King Henry, or it may have been Charles, because she wanted a gold snuff-box
  he had. I'm not sure whether it was a gold snuff-box or a silver bed. Anyway,
  she got it an' was be'eaded in...I don't remember the date."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for the parallel," smiled Dick. "But Lola is not after
  snuff-boxes of gold or silver. Young Bennett hasn't twopence of his own.
  There is something particularly interesting to me about this
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>Elk smoked thoughtfully, watching the smoke rings rise to the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"Bennett's got a sister," he said, to the other's amazement. "Pretty, as
  far as looks go. Old man Bennett's a crook of some kind. Doesn't do any
  regular work, but goes away for days at a time and comes back looking
  ill."</p>

  <p>"You know them?"</p>

  <p>Elk nodded.</p>

  <p>"Old man Bennett attracted me. Somebody reported his movements as
  suspicious&mdash;the local police. They've got nothing to do except guard
  chickens, and naturally they look on anybody who doesn't keep chickens as
  bein' a suspicious character. I kept old Bennett under observation, but I
  never got to the bottom of his movements. He has run lots of queer stunts. He
  wrote a play once and put it on. It went dead on the fourth night. Then he
  took to playing the races on a system. That nearly broke him. Then he started
  a correspondence school at Horsham&mdash;'How to write good English'&mdash;
  and he lost money. Now he's taking pictures."</p>

  <p>"How long has he been trying those methods of getting a living?"</p>

  <p>"Years. I traced a typewriting agency to him seventeen years ago. They
  haven't all been failures. He made money out of some. But I'd give my head to
  know what his regular game is. Once a month regular, sometimes twice,
  sometimes more often, he disappears and you can't find him or trail him. I've
  sounded every crook in town, but they're as much puzzled as I am. Lew
  Brady&mdash;that's the big sporting fellow who worked with Lola&mdash;he's
  interested too. He hates Bennett. Years ago he tackled the old man and tried
  to bully him into telling him what his lay was, and Bennett handled him
  rough."</p>

  <p>"The old man?" asked Dick incredulously.</p>

  <p>"The old man. He's as strong as an ox. Don't forget it. I'll see Lola.
  She's not a bad girl&mdash;up to a point. Personally, vamps never appeal to
  me. Genter's dead, they tell me? The Frog's in that too?"</p>

  <p>"There's no doubt about it," said Dick, rising. "And here, Elk, is one of
  the men who killed him."</p>

  <p>He walked to the window and looked out, Elk behind him. The man who had
  stood on the sidewalk had disappeared. "Where?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>"He's gone now!"</p>

  <p>At that moment the window shattered inward, and splinters of glass stung
  his face. Another second, and Elk was dragged violently to cover.</p>

  <p>"From the roof of Onslow Gardens," said Richard Gordon calmly. "I wondered
  where the devils would shoot from&mdash;that's twice they've tried to get me
  since daylight."</p>

  <p>A spent cartridge on the flat roof of 94, Onslow Gardens, and the print of
  feet, were all the evidence that the assassin left behind. No. 94 was empty
  except for a caretaker, who admitted that he was in the habit of going out
  every morning to buy provisions for the day. Admission had been gained by the
  front door; there was a tradesman who saw a man let himself into the house,
  carrying what looked to be a fishing-rod under his arm, but which undoubtedly
  was a rifle in a cloth case.</p>

  <p>"Very simple," said Dick; "and, of course, from the Frog's point of view,
  effective. The shooter had half-a-dozen ways of escape, including the
  fire-escape."</p>

  <p>Elk was silent and glum. Dick Gordon as silent, but cheerful, until the
  two men were back in his office.</p>

  <p>"It was my inquiry at the garage that annoyed them," he said, "and I'll
  give them this credit, that they are rapid! I was returning to my house when
  the first attempt was made. The most ingenious effort to run me down with a
  light car&mdash;the darned thing even mounted the pavement after me.</p>

  <p>"Number?"</p>

  <p>"XL.19741," said Dick, "but fake. There is no such number on the register.
  The driver was gone before I could stop him."</p>

  <p>Elk scratched his chin, surveying the youthful Public Prosecutor with a
  dubious eye.</p>

  <p>"Almost sounds interesting to me," he said. "Of course I've heard of the
  Frogs, but I didn't give much attention. Nowadays secret societies are so
  common that every time a man shakes hands with me, he looks sort of
  disappointed if I don't pull my ear or flap my feet. And gang work on a large
  scale I've always looked upon as something you only hear about in exciting
  novels by my old friend Shylock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sherlock&mdash;and he didn't write them," murmured Dick.</p>

  <p>Again Elk fingered his cheek.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe in it, anyway," he said after thought. "It's not natural
  that tramps should do anything systematic. It's too much like work. I'll bet
  there's nothing in it, only a lot of wild coincidences stickin' together.
  I'll bet that the Frogs are just a silly society without any plan or reason.
  And I'll bet that Lola knows all about 'em," he added inconsistently.</p>

  <p>Elk walked back to "The Yard" by the most circuitous route. With his
  furled and ancient umbrella hanging on his arm, he had the appearance of an
  out-of-work clerk. His steel-rimmed spectacles, clipped at a groggy angle,
  assisted the illusion. Winter and summer he wore a soiled fawn top-coat,
  which was invariably unbuttoned, and he had worn the same yellowish-brown
  suit for as long as anybody could remember. The rain came down, not in any
  great quantities, but incessantly. His hard derby hat glistened with
  moisture, but he did not put up his umbrella. Nobody had ever seen that
  article opened.</p>

  <p>He walked to Trafalgar Square and then stopped, stood in thought for some
  time, and retraced his steps. Opposite the Public Prosecutor's office stood a
  tall street-seller with a little tray of matches, key-rings, pencils and the
  odds and ends that such men sell. His wares, for the moment, were covered by
  a shining oil-cloth. Elk had not noticed him before, and wondered why the man
  had taken up so unfavourable a stand, for the end of Onslow Gardens, the
  windiest and least comfortable position in Whitehall, is not a place where
  the hurrying pedestrian would stop to buy, even on a fine day. The hawker was
  dressed in a shabby raincoat that reached to his heels; a soft felt hat was
  pulled down over his eyes, but Elk saw the hawk-like face and stopped.</p>

  <p>"Busy?"</p>

  <p>"Naw."</p>

  <p>Elk was immediately interested. This man was American, and was trying to
  disguise his voice so that it appeared Cockney&mdash;the most impossible task
  that any American had ever undertaken, for the whine and intonation of the
  Cockney are inimitable.</p>

  <p>"You're American&mdash;what state?"</p>

  <p>"Georgia," was the reply, and this time the hawker made no attempt at
  disguise. "Came over on a cattle boat during the war."</p>

  <p>Elk held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Let me see that licence of yours, brother," he said.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation the man produced the written police permit to sell on
  the streets. It was made out in the name of "Joshua Broad," and was in
  order.</p>

  <p>"You're not from Georgia," said Elk, "but that doesn't matter. You're from
  Hampshire or Massachusetts."</p>

  <p>"Connecticut, to be exact," said the man coolly, "but I've lived in
  Georgia. Want a key-ring?"</p>

  <p>There was a gleam of amusement in his eyes&mdash;the merest flash.</p>

  <p>"No. Never had a key. Never had anything worth locking up," said Elk,
  fingering the articles on the tray. "Not a good pitch, this."</p>

  <p>"No," said the other; "too near to Scotland Yard, Mr. Elk."</p>

  <p>Elk cast a swift glance at the man.</p>

  <p>"Know me, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Most people do, don't they?" asked the other innocently.</p>

  <p>Elk took the pedlar in from the soles of his stout shoes to his soddened
  hat, and, with a nod, went on. The hawker looked after the detective until he
  was out of sight, and then, fixing a cover over his tray, strapped it tight
  and walked in the direction Elk had taken.</p>

  <p>Coming out of Maitlands to lunch, Ray Bennett saw a shabby and saturnine
  man standing on the edge of the pavement, but gave him no more than a passing
  glance. He, at any rate, did not know Elk and was quite unconscious of the
  fact that he was being followed to the little chophouse where Philo Johnson
  and he took their modest luncheon.</p>

  <p>In any circumstances Ray would not have observed the shadow, but to-day,
  in his condition of mind, he had no thought for anybody but himself, or any
  offence but the bearded and ancient Maitland's outrageous behaviour.</p>

  <p>"The old devil!" he said as he walked by Johnson's side. "To make a ten
  per cent cut in salaries and to start on me. And this morning the papers say
  that he has given five thousand to the Northern Hospitals!"</p>

  <p>"He's a charitable cuss, and as to the cut, it was either that or standing
  you off," said Johnson cheerfully. "What's the use of kicking? Trade has been
  bad, and the stock market is as dead as Ptolemy. The old man wanted to put
  you off&mdash;said that you were superfluous anyway. If you'd only look on
  the bright side of things, Ray&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bright!" snorted the young man, his face going pink with anger. "I'm
  getting a boy's salary, and I want money mighty badly, Philo."</p>

  <p>Philo sighed, and for once his good-humoured face was clouded. Then it
  relaxed into a broad grin.</p>

  <p>"If I thought the same way as you, I'd go mad or turn into a first-class
  crook. I only earn about fifty per cent more than you, and yet the old man
  allows me to handle hundreds of thousands. It's too bad."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the "badness" of the parsimonious Maitland did not interfere
  with his appetite.</p>

  <p>"The art of being happy," he said as he pushed back his plate and lit a
  cigarette, "is to want nothing. Then you're always getting more than you
  need. How is your sister?"</p>

  <p>"She's all right," said Ray indifferently. "Ella's the same mind as you.
  It's easy to be a philosopher over other people's worries, Who's that
  disreputable bird?" he added, as a man seated himself at a table opposite to
  them.</p>

  <p>Philo fixed his glasses&mdash;he was a little near-sighted.</p>

  <p>"That's Elk&mdash;a Scotland Yard man," he said, and grinned at the
  new-comer, a recognition which, to Ray's annoyance&mdash;and his annoyance
  was tinged with uneasiness&mdash;brought the seedy man to their table.</p>

  <p>"This is my friend, Mr. Bennett&mdash;Inspector Elk, Ray."</p>

  <p>"Sergeant," suggested Elk dourly. "Fate has always been against me in the
  matter of promotion. Can't remember dates."</p>

  <p>So far from making a secret of his failure, Mr. Elk was never tired of
  discussing the cause.</p>

  <p>"Though why a man is a better thief-taker for knowin' when George
  Washington was born and when Napoleon Bonaparte died, is a mystery to me.
  Dine here every day, Mr. Bennett?"</p>

  <p>Ray nodded.</p>

  <p>"Know your father, I think&mdash;John Bennett of Horsham, isn't it?
  Thought so."</p>

  <p>In desperation Ray got up with an excuse and left them alone.</p>

  <p>"Nice boy, that," said Elk.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap05"
     id="chap05">V. &mdash; MR. MAITLAND GOES HOME</a></h2>

  <p class="first">They were nearing the imposing home of Maitlands
  Consolidated, when Mr. Johnson suddenly broke off in the middle of an
  interesting exposition of his philosophy and quickened his pace. On the
  pavement ahead of them he saw Ray Bennett, and by his side the slim figure of
  a girl. Their backs were toward the two men, but Elk guessed rightly when he
  decided that the girl was Ella Bennett. He had seen her twice before, and he
  had a wonderful memory for backs. Turning as the stout man came up to her,
  hat in hand, she greeted him with a quick and friendly smile.</p>

  <p>"This is an unexpected pleasure, Miss Bennett."</p>

  <p>There was a pink tinge to Johnson's homely face ("Sweet on her," thought
  Elk, interested), and his handshake was warm and something more than
  cordial.</p>

  <p>"I didn't intend coming to town, but father has gone off on one of his
  mysterious excursions," she said with a little laugh, "this time to the West.
  And, curiously enough, am absolutely sure I saw him on a 'bus just now,
  though his train left two hours ago."</p>

  <p>She glanced at Elk hovering in the background, and the sight of his glum
  countenance seemed to arouse some unpleasant memory, for the brightness went
  out of her face.</p>

  <p>"My friend, Mr. Elk," said Johnson a little awkwardly, and Elk nodded.</p>

  <p>"Glad to meet you, Miss Bennett," he said, and noted Ray's annoyance with
  inward satisfaction which, in a more cheerful man, would have been mirth.</p>

  <p>She bowed slightly and then said something in a low tone to her brother.
  Elk saw the boy frown.</p>

  <p>"I shan't be very late," he said, loudly enough for the detective to
  hear.</p>

  <p>She put out her hand to Johnson, Elk she favoured with a distant
  inclination of her head, and was gone, leaving the three men looking after
  her. Two, for when Mr. Elk looked around, the boy had disappeared into the
  building.</p>

  <p>"You know Miss Bennett?"</p>

  <p>"Slightly," said Elk grudgingly. "I know almost everybody slightly. Good
  people and bad people. The gooder they are, the slighter I know 'em. Queer
  devil."</p>

  <p>"Who?" asked the startled Johnson. "You mean her father? I wish he wasn't
  so chilly with me."</p>

  <p>Elk's lips twitched.</p>

  <p>"I guess you do," he said drily. "So long."</p>

  <p>He strolled aimlessly away as Johnson walked up the steps into Maitlands,
  but he did not go far. Crossing the road, he retraced his steps and took up
  his station in the doorway.</p>

  <p>At four o'clock a taxicab drew up before the imposing door of Maitlands
  Consolidated, and a few minutes later the old man shuffled out, looking
  neither to the right nor to the left. Elk regarded him with more than
  ordinary interest. He knew the financier by sight, and had paid two or three
  visits to the office in connection with certain petty thefts committed by
  cleaners. In this way he had become acquainted with Philo Johnson, for old
  Maitland had delegated the interview to his subordinate.</p>

  <p>Elk judged the old man to be in the region of seventy, and wondered for
  the first time where he lived, and in what state. Had he relations? It was a
  curious fact that he knew nothing whatever about the financier, the least
  paragraphed of any of the big City forces.</p>

  <p>The detective had no business with the head of this flourishing firm. His
  task was to discover the association between Lola Bassano and this
  impecunious clerk. He knew inside him that Dick Gordon's interest in the
  young man was not altogether disinterested, and suspected rightly that the
  pretty sister of Ray Bennett lay behind it.</p>

  <p>But the itch for knowledge about Maitland, suddenly aroused by the
  realization that the old man's home life was an unknown quantity, was too
  strong to be resisted. As the taxicab moved off, Elk beckoned another.</p>

  <p>"Follow that cab," he said, and the driver nodded his agreement without
  question, for there was no taximan on the streets who did not know this
  melancholy policeman.</p>

  <p>The first of the cabs drove rapidly in the direction of North London, and
  halted at a busy junction of streets in Finsbury Park. This is a part of the
  town which great financiers do not as a rule choose for their habitations. It
  is a working-class district, full of small houses, usually occupied by two or
  more families; and when the cab stopped and the old man nimbly descended,
  Elk's mouth opened in an '0' of surprise.</p>

  <p>Maitland did not pay the cabman, but hurried round the corner into the
  busy thoroughfare, with Elk at his heels. He walked a hundred yards, and then
  boarded a street car. Elk sprinted, and swung himself on board as the car was
  moving. The old man found a seat, took a battered newspaper from his pocket,
  and began reading.</p>

  <p>The car ran down Seven Sisters Road into Tottenham, and here Mr. Maitland
  descended. He turned into a side street of apparently interminable length,
  crossed the road, and came into a narrow and even meaner street than that
  which he had traversed; and then, to Elk's amazement, pushed open the iron
  gate of a dark and dirty little house, opened the door and went in, closing
  it behind him.</p>

  <p>The detective looked up and down the street. It was crowded with poor
  children. Elk looked at the house again, scarcely believing his eyes. The
  windows were unclean, the soiled curtains visible were ragged, and the tiny
  forecourt bore an appearance of neglect. And this was the home of Ezra
  Maitland, a master of millions, the man who gave £5,000 to the London
  hospitals! It was incredible.</p>

  <p>He made up his mind, and, walking to the door, knocked. For some time
  there was no reply, and then he heard the shuffle of slippered feet in the
  passage, and an old woman with a yellow face opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," said Elk "I think the gentleman who just came in dropped
  this." He produced a handkerchief from his pocket, and she glared at it for a
  moment, and then, reaching out her hand, took it from him and slammed the
  door in his face.</p>

  <p>"And that's the last of my good handkerchief," thought Elk bitterly.</p>

  <p>He had caught one glimpse of the interior. A grimy-looking passage with a
  strip of faded carpet, and a flight of uncovered stairs. He proceeded to make
  a few local inquiries. "Maitland or Mainland, I don't know which," said a
  tradesman who kept a general store at the corner. "The old gentleman goes out
  every morning at nine, and comes home just about this hour. I don't know who
  or what he is. I can tell you this, though: he doesn't eat much! He buys all
  his goods here. What those two people live on, an ordinary healthy child
  would eat at one meal!"</p>

  <p>Elk went back to the west, a little mystified. The miser was a common
  figure of fiction, and not uncommonly met with in real life. But old Maitland
  must be a super-miser, he thought, and decided to give the matter a little
  further attention. For the moment, he was concentrating his efforts upon Miss
  Lola Bassano, that interesting lady.</p>

  <p>In one of the fashionable thoroughfares leading from Cavendish Square is a
  block of flats, occupied by wealthy tenants. Its rents are remarkably high,
  even for that exclusive quarter, and even Elk, who was not easily surprised,
  was a little staggered when he learnt that Lola Bassano occupied a suite in
  this expensive building.</p>

  <p>It was to Caverley House that he made his way after returning to
  Maitland's office, to find the premises closed. There was no indicator on the
  wall, but the lift-man, who regarded Elk with some suspicion, as he was
  entitled to do, announced that Miss Bassano lived on the third floor. "How
  long has she been here?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>"That's no business of yours," said the lift-man; "and I think what you
  want, my friend, is the tradesmen's entrance."</p>

  <p>"I've often wondered," ruminated Elk, "what people like you do their
  thinking with."</p>

  <p>"Now look here&mdash;!" began the lift-man indignantly. "Look here,"
  retorted Elk, and at the sight of his badge the man grew more polite and more
  informative.</p>

  <p>"She's been here two months," he said. "And, to tell you the truth, Mr.
  Elk, I've often wondered how she got a suite in Caverley House. They tell me
  she used to run a gambling joint on Jermyn Street. You haven't come to raid
  her, have you?" he asked anxiously. "That'd get Caverley House a pretty bad
  name."</p>

  <p>"I've come to make a friendly call," said Elk carefully. "That's the
  door." The man stepped out of the lift and pointed to one of the two sober
  mahogany doors on the landing. "This other flat belongs to an American
  millionaire."</p>

  <p>"Is there such a thing?" asked Elk. He was about to say something more
  when the lift-man walked to the door and peered at one of its polished
  panels. "That's queer," he said. "What do you make of this?" Elk joined him,
  and at a glance saw and understood. On the panel had been stamped a small
  white frog&mdash;an exact replica of those he had seen that morning on the
  photographs that Dick Gordon had shown him. A squatting frog, slightly
  askew.</p>

  <p>He touched it. The ink was still wet and showed on his finger. And then
  the strangest thing of all happened. The door opened suddenly, and a man of
  middle age appeared in the doorway. In his hand was a long-barrelled
  Browning, and it covered the detective's heart.</p>

  <p>"Put up your hands," he said sharply. Then he stopped and stared at the
  detective.</p>

  <p>Elk returned the gaze, speechless; for the elegantly dressed man who stood
  there was the hawk-faced pedlar he had seen in Whitehall!</p>

  <p>The American was the first to recover. Not a muscle of his face moved, but
  Elk saw again that light of amusement in his eyes as he stepped back and
  opened the door still wider. "Come right in, Mr. Elk," he said, and, to the
  amazed lift-man: "It's all right, Worth. I was practising a little joke on
  Mr. Elk."</p>

  <p>He closed the door behind him, and with a gesture beckoned the detective
  into a prettily furnished drawing-room. Elk went in, leaving the matter of
  the frog on the door for discussion later.</p>

  <p>"We're quite alone, Mr. Elk, so you needn't lower your voice when you talk
  of my indiscretions. Will you smoke a cigar?"</p>

  <p>Elk stretched out his fingers mechanically and selected a big Cabana.</p>

  <p>"Unless I'm greatly mistaken, I saw you this morning," he began.</p>

  <p>"You weren't mistaken at all," interrupted the other coolly. "You saw me
  on Whitehall. I was peddling key-rings. My name is Joshua Broad. You haven't
  anything on me for trading in a false name."</p>

  <p>The detective lit his cigar before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"This apartment must cost you a whole lot to keep up," he said slowly,
  "and I don't blame you for trying to earn something on the side. But it seems
  to me that peddling key-rings is a very poor proposition for a first-class
  business man."</p>

  <p>Joshua Broad nodded.</p>

  <p>"I haven't made a million out of that business," he said, "but it amuses
  me, Mr. Elk. I am something of a philosopher."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigar and settled himself comfortably in a deep, chintz-covered
  arm-chair, his legs crossed, the picture of contentment.</p>

  <p>"As an American, I am interested in social problems, and I have found that
  the best way to understand the very poor of any country is to get right down
  amongst them."</p>

  <p>His tone was easy, apologetic, but quite self-possessed.</p>

  <p>"I think I forestalled any question on your part as to whether I had a
  licence in my own name, by telling you that I had."</p>

  <p>Elk settled his glasses more firmly on his nose, and his eyes strayed to
  Mr. Broad's pocket, whither the pistol had returned.</p>

  <p>"This is a pretty free country," he said in his deliberate way, "and a man
  can peddle key-rings, even if he's a member of the House of Lords. But one
  thing he mustn't do, Mr. Broad, is to stick fire-arms under the noses of
  respectable policemen."</p>

  <p>Broad chuckled.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I was a little rattled," he said. "But the truth is, I've been
  waiting for the greater part of an hour, expecting somebody to come to my
  door, and when I heard your stealthy footsteps"&mdash;he shrugged&mdash;"it
  was a fool mistake for a grown man to make," he said, "and I guess I'm
  feeling as badly about it as you would have me feel."</p>

  <p>The unwavering eyes of Mr. Elk did not leave his face.</p>

  <p>"I won't insult your intelligence by asking you if you were expecting a
  friend," he said. "But I should like to know the name of the other
  guest."</p>

  <p>"So should I," said the other, "and so would a whole lot of people."</p>

  <p>He reached out his hand to flick the ash from his cigar, looking at Elk
  thoughtfully the while.</p>

  <p>"I was expecting a man who has every reason to be very much afraid of me,"
  he said. "His name is&mdash;well, it doesn't matter, and I've only met him
  once in my life, and then I didn't see his face."</p>

  <p>"And you beat him up?" suggested Elk.</p>

  <p>The other man laughed.</p>

  <p>"I didn't even beat him up. In fact, I behaved most generously to him," he
  said quietly. "I was not with him more than five minutes, in a darkened room,
  the only light being a lantern which was on the table. And I guess that's
  about all I can tell you, Inspector."</p>

  <p>"Sergeant," murmured Elk. "It's curious the number of people who think I'm
  an Inspector."</p>

  <p>There was an awkward pause. Elk could think of no other questions he
  wanted to ask, and his host displayed as little inclination to advance any
  further statement.</p>

  <p>"Neighbours friends of yours?" asked Elk, and jerked his head toward the
  passage.</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;Bassano and her friend? No. Are you after them?" he asked
  quickly.</p>

  <p>Elk shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Making a friendly call," he said. "Just that. I've just come back from
  your country, Mr. Broad. A good country but too full of distances."</p>

  <p>He ruminated, looking down at the carpet for a long time, and presently he
  said:</p>

  <p>"I'd like to meet that friend of yours, Mr. Broad&mdash;American?"</p>

  <p>Broad shook his head. Not a word was spoken as they went up the passage to
  the front door, and it almost seemed as if Elk was going without saying
  good-bye, for he walked out absent-mindedly, and only turned as though the
  question of any farewell had occurred to him.</p>

  <p>"Shall be glad to meet you again, Mr. Broad," he said. "Perhaps I shall
  see you in Whitehall&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And then his eyes strayed to the grotesque white frog on the door. Broad
  said nothing. He put his finger on the imprint and it smudged under his
  touch.</p>

  <p>"Recently stamped," he drawled. "Well, now, what do you think of that, Mr.
  Elk?"</p>

  <p>Elk was examining the mat before the door. There was a little spot of
  white, and he stooped and smeared his finger over it.</p>

  <p>"Yes, quite recent. It must have been done just before I came in," he
  said. And there his interest in the Frog seemed to evaporate. "I'll be going
  along now," he said with a nod.</p>

  <p>In the exquisitely appointed drawing-room of Suite No. 6, Lola Bassano sat
  cuddled up in a deep, over-cushioned chair, her feet tucked under her, a thin
  cigarette between her lips, a scowl upon her pretty face. From time to time
  she glanced at the man who stood by the window, hands in pockets, staring
  down into the square. He was tall, heavily built, heavily jowled,
  unprepossessing. All the help that tailor and valet gave to him could not
  disguise his origin. He was pugilist, run to fat. For a time, a very short
  time, Lew Brady had been welter-weight champion of Europe, a terrific fighter
  with just that yellow thread in his composition which makes all the
  difference between greatness and mediocrity in the ring. A harder man had
  discovered his weakness, and the glory of Lew Brady faded with remarkable
  rapidity. He had one advantage over his fellows which saved him from utter
  extinction. A philanthropist had found him in the gutter as a child, and had
  given him an education. He had gone to a good school and associated with boys
  who spoke good English. The benefit of that association he had never lost,
  and his voice was so curiously cultured that people who for the first time
  heard this brute-man speak, listened open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"What time do you expect that rat of yours?" he asked. Lola lifted her
  silk-clad shoulders, took out her cigarette to yawn, and settled herself more
  cosily.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. He leaves his office at five."</p>

  <p>The man turned from the window and began to pace the room slowly.</p>

  <p>"Why Frog worries about him I don't know," he grumbled. "Lola, I'm surely
  getting tired of old man Frog."</p>

  <p>Lola smiled and blew out a ring of smoke.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're tired of getting money for nothing, Brady," she said.
  "Personally speaking, that kind of weariness never comes to me. There is one
  thing sure: Frog wouldn't bother with young Bennett if there wasn't something
  in it."</p>

  <p>He pulled out a watch and glanced at its jewelled face.</p>

  <p>"Five o'clock. I suppose that fellow doesn't know you're married to
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," said Lola wearily. "Am I likely to boast about it?"</p>

  <p>He grinned and resumed his pacings. Presently he heard the faint tinkle of
  the bell and glanced at the girl. She got up, shook the cushions and
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"Open the door," she said, and the man went out of the room
  obediently.</p>

  <p>Ray Bennett crossed the room with quick strides and caught the girl's hand
  in both of his.</p>

  <p>"I'm late. Old Johnson kept me running round after the clerks had gone.
  Moses, this is a fine room, Lola! I hadn't any idea you lived in such
  style."</p>

  <p>"You know Lew Brady?"</p>

  <p>Ray nodded smilingly. He was a picture of happiness, and the presence of
  Lew Brady made no difference to him. He had met Lola at a supper club, and
  knew that she and Brady had some business association. Moreover, Ray prided
  himself upon that confusion of standards which is called "broad-mindedness."
  He visualized a new social condition which was superior to the bondage which
  old-fashioned rules of conduct imposed upon men and women in their
  relationship one to the other. He was young, clean-minded, saw things as he
  would have them be. Breadth of mind not infrequently accompanies limitation
  of knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Now for your wonderful scheme," he said as, at a gesture from her, he
  settled himself by the girl's side. "Does Brady know?"</p>

  <p>"It is Lew's idea," she said lightly. "He is always looking out for
  opportunities&mdash;not for himself but for other people."</p>

  <p>"It's a weakness of mine," said Lew apologetically. "And anyway, I don't
  know if you'll like the scheme. I'd have taken it on myself, but I'm too
  busy. Did Lola tell you anything about it?"</p>

  <p>Ray nodded.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it," he said. "I always thought such things belonged to
  magazine stories! Lola says that the Government of Japan wants a secret agent
  in London. Somebody they can disown, if necessary. But what is the work?"</p>

  <p>"There you've got me," said Lew, shaking his head. "So far as I can
  discover, you've nothing to do but live! Perhaps they'll want you to keep
  track of what is going on in the political world. The thing I don't like
  about it is that you'll have to live a double life. Nobody must know that
  you're a clerk at Maitlands. You can call yourself by any name you like, and
  you'll have to make your domestic arrangements as best you know."</p>

  <p>"That will be easy," interrupted the boy. "My father says I ought to have
  a room in town&mdash;he thinks the journey to and from Horsham every day is
  too expensive. I fixed that with him on Sunday. I shall have to go down to
  the cottage some week-ends&mdash;but what am I to do, and to whom do I
  report?"</p>

  <p>Lola laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Poor boy," she mocked. "The prospect of owning a beautiful flat and
  seeing me every day is worrying him."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap06"
     id="chap06">VI. &mdash; MR. MAITLAND GOES SHOPPING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Eldor Street, Tottenham, was one of thousands of drab and
  ugly thoroughfares that make up the central suburbs of London. Imagine two
  rows of houses set on either side of a straight street, lighted at economic
  intervals by yellow lamps. Each house has a protuberance, called a bay
  window; each house is separated from the road by iron railings pierced by an
  iron gate. There is a tiny forecourt in which the hardiest of shrubs battle
  desperately for existence; there is one recessed door, and on the floor above
  two windows exactly alike.</p>

  <p>Elk found himself in Eldor Street at nine o'clock that night. The rain was
  pelting down, and the street in consequence was a desert. Most of the houses
  were dark, for Eldor Street lives in its kitchens, which are at the back of
  the houses. In the front window of No. 47 one crack of light showed past the
  edge of the lowered blind, and, creeping up to the window, he heard, at long
  intervals, the mumble of conversation.</p>

  <p>It was difficult to believe that he was standing at the door of Ezra
  Maitland's home. That morning the newspapers had given prominence to the
  newest speculation of Maitlands Consolidated&mdash;a deal involving something
  over a million. And the master-mind of the concern lived in this squalor!</p>

  <p>Whilst he was standing there, the light was extinguished and there came to
  him the sound of feet in the uncarpeted passage. He had time to reach the
  obscurity of the other side of the street, when the door opened and two
  people came out: Maitland and the old woman he had seen. By the light of a
  street-lamp he saw that Maitland wore an overcoat buttoned to his chin. The
  old woman had on a long ulster, and in her hand she carried a string bag.
  They were going marketing! It was Saturday night, and the main street,
  through which Elk had passed, had been thronged with late
  shoppers&mdash;Tottenham leaves its buying to the last, when food can be had
  at bargain prices.</p>

  <p>Waiting until they were out of sight, Elk walked down the street to the
  end and turned to the left. He followed a wall covered with posters until he
  reached a narrow opening. This was the passage between the gardens&mdash;a
  dark, unlighted alleyway, three feet wide and running between tar-coated
  wooden fences. He counted the gates on his left with the help of his
  flash-lamp, and after a while stopped before one of them and pushed gently.
  The gate was locked&mdash;it was not bolted. There was a keyhole that had the
  appearance of use. Elk grunted his satisfaction, and, taking from his pocket
  a wallet, extracted a small wooden handle, into which he fitted a steel hook,
  chosen with care from a dozen others. This he inserted into the lock and
  turned. Evidently the lock was more complicated than he had expected. He
  tried another hook of a different shape, and yet another. At the fourth trial
  the lock turned and he pushed open the door gently.</p>

  <p>The back of the house was in darkness, the yard singularly free from the
  obstructions which he had anticipated. He crossed to the door leading into
  the house. To his surprise it was unfastened, and he replaced his tools in
  his pocket. He found himself in a small scullery. Passing through a door into
  the bare passage, he came to the room in which he had seen the light. It was
  meanly and shabbily furnished. The armchair near the fire-place had broken
  springs, there was an untidy bed in one corner, and in the centre of the room
  a table covered with a patched cloth. On this were two or three books and a
  few sheets of paper covered with the awkward writing of a child. Elk read
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Look at the dog," it ran. "The man goes up to the dog and the dog barks
  at the man."</p>

  <p>There was more in similar strain. The books were children's primers of an
  elementary kind. Looking round, he saw a cheap gramophone and on the
  sideboard half a dozen scratched and chipped records.</p>

  <p>The child must be in the house. Turning on the gas, he lit it, after
  slipping a bolt in the front door to guard against surprise. In the more
  brilliant light, the poverty of the room staggered him. The carpet was worn
  and full of holes; there was not one article of furniture which had not been
  repaired at some time or other. On the dingy sideboard was a child's
  abacus&mdash;a frame holding wires on which beads were strung, and by means
  of which the young are taught to count. A paper on the mantelpiece attracted
  him. It was a copy of the million pound contract which Maitland had signed
  that morning. His neat signature, with the characteristic flourish beneath,
  was at the foot.</p>

  <p>Elk replaced the paper and began a search of the apartment. In a cupboard
  by the side of the fire-place he found an iron money-box, which he judged was
  half-full of coins In addition, there were nearly a hundred letters addressed
  to E. Maitland, 47 Eldor Street, Tottenham. Elk, glancing through them,
  recognized their unimportance. Every one was either a tradesman's circular or
  those political pamphlets with which candidates flood their constituencies.
  And they were all unopened. Mr. Maitland evidently knew what they were also,
  and had not troubled to examine their contents. Probably the hoarding
  instincts of age had made him keep them. There was nothing else in the room
  of interest. He was certain that this was where the old man slept&mdash;where
  was the child?</p>

  <p>Turning out the light, he went upstairs. One door was locked, and here his
  instruments were of no avail, for the lock was a patent one and was recently
  fixed. Possibly the child was there, he thought. The second room, obviously
  the old woman's, was as meanly furnished as the parlour.</p>

  <p>Coming back to the landing, his foot was poised to reach the first stair
  when he heard a faint "click." It came from below, and was the sound of a
  door closing. Elk waited, listening. The sound was not repeated, and he
  descended softly. At first he thought that the old man had returned, and was
  trying his key on the bolted door, but when he crept to the door to listen,
  he heard no sound, and slipping back the bolt, he went to the second of the
  rooms on the ground floor and put his light on the door.</p>

  <p>Elk was a man of keen observation; very little escaped him, and he was
  perfectly certain that this door had been ajar when he had passed it on
  entering the house. It was closed now and fastened from the inside, the key
  being in the lock.</p>

  <p>Was it the child, frightened by his presence? Elk was wise enough a man
  not to investigate too closely. He made the best of his way back to the
  garden passage and into the street. Here he waited, taking up a position
  which enabled him to see the length of Eldor Street and the passage opening
  in the wall. Presently he saw Maitland returning. The old man was carrying
  the string bag, which now bulged. Elk saw the green of a cabbage as they
  passed under the light. He watched them until the darkness swallowed them up,
  and heard the sound of their closing door. Five minutes later, a dark figure
  came from the passage behind the houses. It was a man, and Elk, alert and
  watchful, swung off in pursuit.</p>

  <p>The stranger plunged into a labyrinth of little streets with the detective
  at his heels. He was walking quickly, but not too quickly for Elk, who was
  something of a pedestrian. Into the glare of the main road the stranger
  turned, Elk a dozen paces behind him. He could not see his face, nor did he
  until his quarry stopped by the side of a waiting car, opened the door and
  jumped in. Then it was that Elk came abreast and raised his hand in cheery
  salutation.</p>

  <p>For a second the man in the closed limousine was taken aback, and then he
  opened the door.</p>

  <p>"Come right in out of the rain, Elk," he said, and Elk obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Been doing your Sunday shopping?" he asked innocently.</p>

  <p>The man's hawk-like face relaxed into a smile.</p>

  <p>"I never eat on Sundays," he said.</p>

  <p>It was Joshua Broad, that rich American who peddled key-rings in
  Whitehall, lived in the most expensive flats in London, and found time to be
  intensely interested in Ezra Maitland.</p>

  <p>He turned abruptly as Elk seated himself.</p>

  <p>"Say, Elk, did you see the child?"</p>

  <p>Elk shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, and heard the chuckle of his companion as the car moved
  toward the civilized west.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw that baby," said Mr. Broad, puffing gently at the cigar he had
  lit; "and, believe me, Elk, I've stopped loving children. Yes, sir. The
  education of the young means less than nothing to me for evermore."</p>

  <p>"Where was she?"</p>

  <p>"It's a 'he,'" replied Broad calmly, "and I hope I'll be excused answering
  your question. I had been in the house an hour when you arrived&mdash;I was
  in the back room, which is empty, by the way. You scared me. I heard you come
  in and thought it was old St. Nicholas of the Whiskers. Especially when I saw
  the light go on. I'd had it on when you opened the scullery door&mdash;I left
  that unfastened, by the way. Didn't want to stop my bolt hole. Well, what do
  you think?"</p>

  <p>"About Maitland?"</p>

  <p>"Eccentric, eh? You don't know how eccentric!"</p>

  <p>As the car stopped before the door of Caverley House, Elk broke a long
  silence.</p>

  <p>"What are you, Mr. Broad?"</p>

  <p>"I'll give you ten guesses," said the other cheerfully as they got
  out.</p>

  <p>"Secret Service man," suggested Elk promptly.</p>

  <p>"Wrong&mdash;you mean U.S.? No, you're wrong. I'm a private detective who
  makes a hobby of studying the criminal classes&mdash;will you come up and
  have a drink?"</p>

  <p>"I will come up, but I won't drink," said Elk virtuously, "not if you
  offer gin and orange. That visit to the United States has spoilt my
  digestion."</p>

  <p>Broad was fitting a key in the lock of his flat, when a strange cold
  sensation ran down the spine of the detective, and he laid his hand on the
  American's arm.</p>

  <p>"Don't open that door," he said huskily.</p>

  <p>Broad looked round in surprise. The Yard man's face was tense and
  drawn.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know...just a feeling, that's all. I'm Scot by birth...we've got
  a word 'fey,' which means something supernatural. And it says inside me,
  'don't open that door.'"</p>

  <p>Broad put down his hand.</p>

  <p>"Are you being fey or funny?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"If I look funny," said Elk, "I'm entitled to sue my face for libel.
  There's something at the other side of that door that isn't good. I'll take
  an oath on it! Give me that!" He took the key from the unwilling hand of
  Joshua Broad, thrust it in the lock and turned it. Then, with a quick push,
  he threw open the door, pushing Broad to the cover of the wall.</p>

  <p>Nothing happened for a second, and then:</p>

  <p>"Run!" cried Elk, and leapt for the stairs.</p>

  <p>The American saw the first large billow of greenish-yellowy mist that
  rolled from the open door, and followed. The hall-porter was closing his
  office for the night when Elk appeared, hatless and breathless.</p>

  <p>"Can you 'phone the flats?&mdash;good! Get on at once to every one on and
  below the third floor, and tell them on no account to open their doors. Tell
  'em to close all cracks with paper, to stop up their letter-boxes, and open
  all windows. Don't argue&mdash;do it! The building is full of poison
  gas!"</p>

  <p>He himself 'phoned the fire station, and in a few seconds the jangle of
  bells sounded in the street outside, and men in gas-masks were clattering up
  the stairs.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, every tenant except Broad and his neighbour was out of town
  for the week-end.</p>

  <p>"And Miss Bassano doesn't come in till early morning," said the
  porter.</p>

  <p>It was daylight before the building was cleared by the aid of high-
  pressure air-hoses and chemical precipitants. Except that his silver was
  tarnished black, and every window glass and mirror covered with a yellow
  deposit, little harm had been done. A musty odour pervaded the flat in spite
  of the open windows, but later came the morning breeze to dispel the last
  trace of this malodorous souvenir of the attempt.</p>

  <p>Together the two men made a search of the rooms to discover the manner in
  which the gas was introduced.</p>

  <p>"Through that open fire-place," Elk pointed. "The gas is heavier than air,
  and could be poured down the chimney as easily as pouring water."</p>

  <p>A search of the flat roof satisfied him that his theory was right. They
  found ten large glass cylinders and a long rope, to which a wicker cradle was
  attached. Moreover, one of the chimney-pots (easily reached from the roof)
  was scratched and discoloured.</p>

  <p>"The operator came into the building when the porter was busy&mdash;
  working the lift probably. He made his way to the roof, carrying the rope and
  the basket. Somebody in the street fixed the cylinders in the basket, which
  the man hauled to the roof one by one. It was dead easy, but ingenious. They
  must have made a pretty careful survey beforehand, or they wouldn't have
  known which chimney led to your room."</p>

  <p>They returned to the flat, and for once Joshua Broad was serious.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately, my servant is on a holiday," he said, "or he would have been
  in heaven!"</p>

  <p>"I hope so," responded Elk piously.</p>

  <p>The sun was tipping the roofs of the houses when he finally left, a sleepy
  and a baffled man. He heard the sound of boisterous voices before he reached
  the vestibule. A big car stood at the entrance of the flats, and, seated at
  the wheel, was a young man in evening dress. By him sat Lew Brady, and on the
  pavement was a girl in evening finery.</p>

  <p>"A jolly evening, eh, Lola! When I get going, I'm a mover, eh?"</p>

  <p>Ray Bennett's voice was thick and unsteady. He had been drinking&mdash;
  was within measurable distance of being drunk.</p>

  <p>With a yell he recognized the detective as he came into the street.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's old Elk&mdash;the Elk of Elks! Greetings, most noble copper!
  Lola, meet Elky of Elksburg, the Sherlock of Fact, the Sleuth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" hissed the savage-voiced Lew Brady in his ear, but Ray was in
  too exalted a mood to be silenced.</p>

  <p>"Where's the priceless Gordon?&mdash;say, Elk, watch Gordon! Look after
  poor old Gordon&mdash;my sister's very much attached to Gordon."</p>

  <p>"Fine car, Mr. Bennett," said Elk, regarding the machine thoughtfully.
  "Present from your father?"</p>

  <p>The mention of his father's name seemed to sober the young man.</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't," he snapped, "it belongs to a friend. 'Night, Lola." He
  pumped at the starter, missed picking up, and stamped again. "S'Iong,
  Elk!"</p>

  <p>With a jerk the car started, and Elk watched it out of sight. "That young
  fellow is certainly in danger of knocking his nut against the moon," he said.
  "Had a good time, Lola?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>She fixed her suspicious eyes upon him expectantly.</p>

  <p>"Didn't forget to turn off the gas when you went out, did you? If I was
  Shylock Holmes, maybe I'd tell from the stain on your glove that you
  didn't."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean about gas? I never use the cooker."</p>

  <p>"Somebody does, and he nearly cooked me and a friend of mine&mdash;nearly
  cooked us good!"</p>

  <p>He saw her frown. Since she was a woman he expected her to be an actress,
  but somehow he was ready to believe in her sincerity.</p>

  <p>"There's been a gas attack on Caverley House," he explained, "and not
  cooking gas either. I guess you'll smell it as you go up."</p>

  <p>"What kind of gas&mdash;poison?"</p>

  <p>Elk nodded.</p>

  <p>"But who put it there&mdash;emptied it, or whatever is done with gas?"</p>

  <p>Elk looked at her with that wounded expression which so justly irritated
  his victims.</p>

  <p>"If I knew, Lola, would I be standing here discussing the matter? Maybe my
  old friend Shylock Holmes would, but I wouldn't. I don't know. It was upset
  in Mr. Broad's flat."</p>

  <p>"That is the American who lives opposite to us&mdash;to me," she said.
  "I've only seen him once. He seems a nice man."</p>

  <p>"Somebody didn't think so," said Elk. "I say, Lola, what's that boy
  doing&mdash;young Bennett?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask me? He is making a lot of money just now, and I suppose he
  is running a little wild. They all do."</p>

  <p>"I didn't," said Elk; "but if I'd made money and started something, I'd
  have chosen a better pacemaker than a dud fighting man."</p>

  <p>The angry colour rose to her pretty face, and the glance she shot at him
  was as venomous as the gas he had fought all night.</p>

  <p>"And I think I'd have put through a few enquiries to central office about
  my female acquaintances," Elk went on remorselessly. "I can understand why
  you're glued to the game, because money naturally attracts you. But what gets
  me is where the money comes from."</p>

  <p>"That won't be the only thing that will get you," she said between her
  teeth as she flounced into the half-opened door of Caverley House.</p>

  <p>Elk stood where she had left him, his melancholy face expressionless. For
  five minutes he stood so, and then walked slowly in the direction of his
  modest bachelor home.</p>

  <p>He lived over a lock-up shop, a cigar store, and he was the sole occupant
  of the building. As he crossed Gray's Inn Road, he glanced idly up at the
  windows of his rooms and noted that they were closed. He noticed something
  more. Every pane of glass was misty with some yellow, opalescent
  substance.</p>

  <p>Elk looked up and down the silent street, and at a short distance away saw
  where road repairers had been at work. The night watchman dozed before his
  fire, and did not hear Elk's approach or remark his unusual action. The
  detective found in a heap of gravel, three rounded pebbles, and these he took
  back with him. Standing in the centre of the road, he threw one of the
  pebbles unerringly.</p>

  <p>There was a crash of glass as the window splintered. Elk waited, and
  presently he saw a yellow wraith of poison-vapour curl out and downward
  through the broken pane.</p>

  <p>"This is getting monotonous," said Elk wearily, and walked to the nearest
  fire alarm.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap07"
     id="chap07">VII. &mdash; A CALL ON MR. MAITLAND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Outwardly, John Bennett accepted his son's new life as a
  very natural development which might be expected in a young man. Inwardly he
  was uneasy, fearful. Ray was his only son; the pride of his life, though this
  he never showed. None knew better than John Bennett the snares that await the
  feet of independent youth in a great city. Worst of all, for his peace of
  mind, he knew Ray.</p>

  <p>Ella did not discuss the matter with her father, but she guessed his
  trouble and made up her mind as to what action she would take.</p>

  <p>The Sunday before, Ray had complained bitterly about the new cut to his
  salary. He bad been desperate and had talked wildly of throwing up his work
  and finding a new place. And that possibility filled Ella with dismay. The
  Bennetts lived frugally on a very limited income. Apparently her father had
  few resources, though he always gave her the impression that from one of
  these he received a fairly comfortable income.</p>

  <p>The cottage was Bennett's own property, and the cost of living was
  ridiculously cheap. A woman from the village came in every morning to do
  heavy work, and once a week to assist with the wash. That was the only luxury
  which her father's meagre allowance provided for. So that she faced the
  prospect of an out-of-work Ray with alarm and decided upon her line of
  action.</p>

  <p>One morning Johnson, crossing the marble floor of Maitland's main office,
  saw a delicious figure come through the swing doors, and almost ran to meet
  it.</p>

  <p>"My dear Miss Bennett, this is a wonderful surprise&mdash;Ray is out, but
  if you'll wait&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm glad he is out," she said, relieved. "I want to see Mr. Maitland. Is
  it possible?"</p>

  <p>The cheery face of the philosopher clouded.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that will be difficult," he said. "The old man never sees
  people&mdash;even the biggest men in the City. He hates women and strangers,
  and although I've been with him all these years, I'm not so sure that he has
  got used to me! What is it about?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"It's about Ray's salary," and then, as he shook his head, she went on
  urgently: "It is so important, Mr. Johnson. Ray has extravagant tastes, and
  if they cut his salary it means&mdash;well, you know Ray so well!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether I can do anything," he said dubiously. "I'll go up
  and ask Mr. Maitland, but I'm afraid that it is a million to one chance
  against his seeing you."</p>

  <p>When he came back, the jovial face of Mr. Johnson was one broad smile.</p>

  <p>"Come up before he changes his mind," he said, and led her to the lift.
  "You'll have to do all the talking, Miss Bennett&mdash;he's an eccentric old
  cuss and as hard as flint."</p>

  <p>He showed her into a small and comfortably furnished room, and waved his
  hand to a writing-table littered with papers.</p>

  <p>"My little den," he explained.</p>

  <p>From the "den" a large rosewood door opened upon Mr. Maitland's
  office.</p>

  <p>Johnson knocked softly, and, with a heart that beat a little faster, Ella
  was ushered into the presence of the strange old man who at that moment was
  dominating the money market.</p>

  <p>The room was large, and the luxury of the fittings took her breath away.
  The walls were of rosewood inlaid with exquisite silver inlay. Light came
  from concealed lamps in the cornice as well as from the long stained-glass
  windows. Each article of furniture in the room was worth a fortune, and she
  guessed that the carpet, into which her feet sank, equalled in costliness the
  whole contents of an average house.</p>

  <p>Behind a vast ormolu writing-table sat the great Maitland, bolt upright,
  watching her from under his shaggy white brows. A few stray hairs of his
  spotless beard rested on the desk, and as he raised his hand to sweep them
  into place, she saw he wore fingerless woollen gloves. His head was
  completely bald...she looked at his big ears, standing away from his head,
  fascinated. Patriarchal, yet repulsive. There was something gross, obscene,
  about him that hurt her. It was not the untidiness of his dress, it was not
  his years. Age brings refinement, that beauty of decay that the purists call
  caducity. This old man had grown old coarsely.</p>

  <p>His scrutiny lacked the assurance she expected. It almost seemed that he
  was nervous, ill at ease. His gaze shifted from the girl to his secretary,
  and then to the rich colouring of the windows, and then furtively back to
  Ella again.</p>

  <p>"This is Miss Bennett, sir. You remember that Bennett is our exchange
  clerk, and a very smart fellow indeed. Miss Bennett wants you to reconsider
  your decision about that salary cut."</p>

  <p>"You see, Mr. Maitland," Ella broke in, "we're not particularly well off,
  and the reduction makes a whole lot of difference to us."</p>

  <p>Mr. Maitland wagged his bald head impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I don't care whether you're well off or not well off," he said loudly.
  "When I reduces salaries I reduces 'um, see?"</p>

  <p>She stared at him in amazement. The voice was harsh and common. The
  language and tone were of the gutter. In that sentence he confirmed all her
  first impressions.</p>

  <p>"If he don't like it he can go, and if you don't like it"&mdash;he fixed
  his dull eyes on the uncomfortable-looking Johnson&mdash;"you can go too.
  There's lots of fellers I can get&mdash;pick 'um up on the streets! Millions
  of 'um! That's all." Johnson tiptoed from the presence and closed the door
  behind her.</p>

  <p>"He's a horror!" she gasped. "How can you endure contact with him, Mr.
  Johnson?"</p>

  <p>The stout man smiled quietly.</p>

  <p>"'Millions of 'um,'" he repeated, "and he's right. With a million and a
  half unemployed on the streets, I can't throw up a good job&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she said, impulsively putting her hand on his arm. "I didn't
  know he was like that," she went on more mildly. "He's&mdash;terrible!"</p>

  <p>"He's a self-made man, and perhaps he would have been well advised to have
  got an artisan to do the job," smiled Johnson, "but he's not really bad. I
  wonder why he saw you?"</p>

  <p>"Doesn't he see people?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not unless it is absolutely necessary, and that only happens about twice
  a year. I don't think there is anybody in this building that he's ever spoken
  to&mdash;not even the managers."</p>

  <p>He took her down to the general office. Ray had not come back.</p>

  <p>"The truth is," confessed Johnson when she asked him, "that Ray hasn't
  been to the office this morning. He sent word to say that he wasn't feeling
  any too good, and I fixed it so that he has a day off."</p>

  <p>"He's not ill?" she asked in alarm, but Johnson reassured her.</p>

  <p>"No. I got on the telephone to him&mdash;he has a telephone at his new
  flat."</p>

  <p>"I thought he had an ordinary apartment!" she said, aghast, the housewife
  in her perturbed. "A flat&mdash;where is it?"</p>

  <p>"In Knightsbridge," replied Johnson quietly. "Yes, it sounds expensive,
  but I believe he has a bargain. A man who was going abroad sub-let it to him
  for a song. I suppose he wrote to you from the lodgings in Bloomsbury where
  he intended going. May I be candid, Miss Bennett?"</p>

  <p>"If it is about Ray, I wish you would," she answered quickly.</p>

  <p>"Ray is rather worrying me," said Johnson. "Naturally I want to do all
  that I can for him, for I am fond of him. At present my job is covering up
  his rather frequent absences from the office&mdash;you need not mention this
  fact to him&mdash;but it is rather a strain, for the old man has an uncanny
  instinct for a shirker. He is living in better style than he ought to be able
  to afford, and I've seen him dressed to kill with some of the swellest people
  in town&mdash;at least, they looked swell."</p>

  <p>The girl felt herself go cold, and the vague unrest in her mind became
  instantly a panic.</p>

  <p>"There isn't...anything wrong at the office?" she asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"No. I took the liberty of going through his books. They're square. His
  cash account is right to a centimo. Crudely stated, he isn't stealing&mdash;
  at least, not from us. There's another thing. He calls himself Raymond Lester
  at Knightsbridge. I found this out by accident, and asked him why he had
  taken another name. His explanation was fairly plausible. He didn't want Mr.
  Bennett to hear that he was cutting a shine. He has some profitable outside
  work, but he won't tell me what it is."</p>

  <p>Ella was glad to get away, glad to reach the seclusion which the wide
  spaces of the park afforded. She must think and decide upon the course she
  would take. Ray was not the kind of boy to accept the draconic attitude,
  either in her or in John Bennett. His father must not know&mdash;she must
  appeal to Ray. Perhaps it was true that he had found a remunerative sideline.
  Lots of young men ran spare time work with profit to themselves&mdash;only
  Ray was not a worker.</p>

  <p>She sat down on a park chair to wrestle with the problem, and so intent
  was she upon its solution that she did not realize that somebody had stopped
  before her.</p>

  <p>"This is a miracle!" said a laughing voice, and she looked up into the
  blue eyes of Dick Gordon. "And now you can tell me what is the difficulty?"
  he asked as he pulled another chair toward her and sat down.</p>

  <p>"Difficulty...who...who said I was in difficulties?" she countered.</p>

  <p>"Your face is the traitor," he smiled. "Forgive this attire. I have been
  to make an official call at the United States Embassy."</p>

  <p>She noticed for the first time that he wore the punctilious costume of
  officialdom, the well-fitting tail-coat, the polished top-hat and regulation
  cravat. She observed first of all that he looked very well in them, and that
  he seemed even younger.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea it is your brother," he said. "I saw him a few minutes
  ago&mdash;there he is now."</p>

  <p>She followed the direction of his eyes, and half rose from her chair in
  her astonishment. Riding on the tan track which ran parallel to the park
  road, were a man and a girl. The man was Ray. He was smartly dressed, and
  from the toes of his polished riding-boots to the crown of his grey hat, was
  all that was creditable to expensive tailoring. The girl at his side was
  young, pretty, petite.</p>

  <p>The riders passed without Ray noticing the interested spectators. He was
  in his gayest mood, and the sound of his laughter came back to the
  dumbfounded girl.</p>

  <p>"But...I don't understand&mdash;do you know the lady, Mr. Gordon?"</p>

  <p>"Very well by repute," said Dick drily. "Her name is Lola Bassano."</p>

  <p>"Is she&mdash;a lady?"</p>

  <p>Dick's eyes twinkled.</p>

  <p>"Elk says she's not, but Elk is prejudiced. She has money and education
  and breed. Whether or not these three assets are sufficient to constitute a
  lady, I don't know. Elk says not, but, as I say, Elk is considerably
  prejudiced."</p>

  <p>She sat silent, her mind in a whirl.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea that you want help...about your brother," said Dick
  quietly. "He is frightening you, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I thought so. He is puzzling <i>me</i>. I know all about him, his salary
  and prospects and his queer masquerade under an <i>alias</i>. I'm not
  troubling about that, because boys love those kinds of mysteries.
  Unfortunately, they are expensive mysteries, and I want to know how he can
  afford to keep up this suddenly acquired position."</p>

  <p>He mentioned a sum and she gasped.</p>

  <p>"It costs all that," said Dick. "Elk, who has a passion for exact detail,
  and who knows to a penny what the riding suit costs, supplied me with
  particulars."</p>

  <p>She interrupted him with such a gesture of despair that he felt a
  brute.</p>

  <p>"What can I do...what can I do?" she asked. "Everybody wants to
  help&mdash;you Mr. Johnson, and, I'm sure, Mr. Elk. But he is
  impossible&mdash;Ray, I mean. It will be fighting a feather bed. It may seem
  absurd to you, so much fuss over Ray's foolish escapade, but it means, oh, so
  much to us, father and me!"</p>

  <p>Dick said nothing. It was too delicate a matter for an outsider to intrude
  upon. But the real delicacy of the situation was comprised in the boy's
  riding companion. As though guessing his thoughts, she asked suddenly:</p>

  <p>"Is she a nice girl&mdash;Miss Bassano? I mean, is she one whom Ray should
  know?"</p>

  <p>"She is very charming," he answered after a pause, and she noted the
  evasion and carried the subject no farther. Presently she turned the talk to
  her call on Ezra Maitland, and he heard her description without expressing
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"He's a rough diamond," he said. "Elk knows something about him which he
  refuses to tell. Elk enjoys mystifying his chiefs even more than detecting
  criminals. But I've heard about Maitland from other sources."</p>

  <p>"Why does he wear gloves in the office?" she asked unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>"Gloves&mdash;I didn't know that," he said, surprised. "Why shouldn't
  he?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know...it was a silly idea, but I thought&mdash;it has only
  occurred to me since..."</p>

  <p>He waited.</p>

  <p>"When he put up his hand to smooth his beard, I'm almost sure I saw a
  tattoo mark on his left wrist&mdash;just the edge of it showing above the end
  of the glove&mdash;the head and eyes of frog."</p>

  <p>Dick Gordon listened, thunderstruck.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure it wasn't your imagination, Miss Bennett?" he asked. "I am
  afraid the Frog is getting on all our nerves.</p>

  <p>"It may have been," she nodded "but I was within a few feet of him, and a
  patch of light, reflected from his blotter, caught the wrist for a
  second."</p>

  <p>"Did you speak to Johnson about it?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I thought afterwards that even he, with all his long years of service,
  might not have observed the tattoo mark. I remember now that Ray told me Mr.
  Maitland always wore gloves, summer or winter."</p>

  <p>Dick was puzzled. It was unlikely that this man, the head of a great
  financial corporation, should be associated with a gang of tramps. And yet-
  -</p>

  <p>"When is your brother going to Horsham?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"On Sunday," said the girl. "He has promised father to come to lunch."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said the cunning young man, "that it isn't possible to ask me
  to be a fourth?"</p>

  <p>"You will be a fifth," she smiled. "Mr. Johnson is coming down too. Poor
  Mr. Johnson is scared of father, and I think the fear is mutual. Father
  resembles Maitland in that respect, that he does not like strangers. I'll
  invite you anyway," she said, and the prospect of the Sunday meeting cheered
  her.</p>

  <p>Elk came to see him that night, just as he was going out to a theatre, and
  Dick related the girl's suspicion. To his surprise, Elk took the startling
  theory very coolly.</p>

  <p>"It's possible," he said, "but it's more likely that the tattoo mark isn't
  a frog at all. Old Maitland was a seaman as a boy&mdash;at least, that is
  what the only biography of him in existence says. It's a half-column that
  appeared in a London newspaper about twelve years ago, when he bought up Lord
  Meister's place on the Embankment and began to enlarge his offices. I'll tell
  you this, Mr. Gordon, that I'm quite prepared to believe anything of old
  Maitland."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Dick in astonishment. He knew nothing of the discoveries
  which the detective had made.</p>

  <p>"Because I just should," said Elk. "Men who make millions are not
  ordinary. If they were ordinary they wouldn't be millionaires. I'll inquire
  about that tattoo mark."</p>

  <p>Dick's attention was diverted from the Frogs that week by an unusual
  circumstance. On the Tuesday he was sent for by the Foreign Minister's
  secretary, and, to his surprise, he was received personally by the august
  head of that department. The reason for this signal honour was disclosed.</p>

  <p>"Captain Gordon," said the Minister, "I am expecting from France the draft
  commercial treaty that is to be signed as between ourselves and the French
  and Italian Governments. It is very important that this document should be
  well guarded because&mdash;and I tell you this in confidence&mdash;it deals
  with a revision of tariff rates. I won't compromise you by telling you in
  what manner the revisions are applied, but it is essential that the King's
  Messenger who is bringing the treaty should be well guarded, and I wish to
  supplement the ordinary police protection by sending you to Dover to meet
  him. It is a little outside your duties, but your Intelligence work during
  the war must be my excuse for saddling you with this responsibility. Three
  members of the French and Italian secret police will accompany him to Dover,
  when you and your men will take on the guard duty, and remain until you
  personally see the document deposited in my own safe."</p>

  <p>Like many other important duties, this proved to be wholly unexciting. The
  Messenger was picked up on the quay at Dover, shepherded into a Pullman coupe
  which had been reserved for him, and the passage-way outside the coupe was
  patrolled by two men from Scotland Yard. At Victoria a car, driven by a
  chauffeur-policeman and guarded by armed men, picked up the Messenger and
  Dick, and drove them to Calden Gardens. In his library the Foreign Secretary
  examined the seals carefully, and then, in the presence of Dick and the
  Detective-Inspector who had commanded the escort, placed the envelope in the
  safe.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose for one moment," said the Foreign Minister with a smile,
  after all the visitors but Dick had departed, "that our friends the Frogs are
  greatly interested. Yet, curiously enough, I had them in my mind, and this
  was responsible for the extraordinary precautions we have taken. There is, I
  suppose, no further clue in the Genter murder?"</p>

  <p>"None, sir&mdash;so far as I know. Domestic crime isn't really in my
  department. And any kind of crime does not come to the Public Prosecutor
  until the case against an accused person is ready to be presented."</p>

  <p>"It is a pity," said Lord Farmley. "I could wish that the matter of the
  Frogs was not entirely in the hands of Scotland Yard. It is so out of the
  ordinary, and such a menace to society, that I should feel more happy if some
  extra department were controlling the investigations."</p>

  <p>Dick Gordon might have said that he was itching to assume that control,
  but he refrained. His lordship fingered his shaven chin thoughtfully. He was
  an austere man of sixty, delicately featured, as delicately wrinkled, the
  product of that subtle school of diplomacy which is at once urbane and
  ruthless, which slays with a bow, and is never quite so dangerous as when it
  is most polite.</p>

  <p>"I will speak to the Prime Minister," he said. "Will you dine with me,
  Captain Gordon?"</p>

  <p>Early in the next afternoon, Dick Gordon was summoned to Downing Street,
  and was informed that a special department had been created to deal
  exclusively with this social menace.</p>

  <p>"You have carte blanche, Captain Gordon. I may be criticized for giving
  you this appointment, but I am perfectly satisfied that I have the right
  man," said the Prime Minister; "and you may employ any officer from Scotland
  Yard you wish."</p>

  <p>"I'll take Sergeant Elk," said Dick promptly, and the Prime Minister
  looked dubious.</p>

  <p>"That is not a very high rank," he demurred.</p>

  <p>"He is a man with thirty years' service," said Dick; "and I believe that
  only his failure in the educational test has stopped his further promotion.
  Let me have him, sir, and give him the temporary rank of Inspector."</p>

  <p>The older man laughed.</p>

  <p>"Have it your own way," he said.</p>

  <p>Sergeant Elk, lounging in to report progress that afternoon, was greeted
  by a new title. For a while he was dazed, and then a slow smile dawned on his
  homely face.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet I'm the only inspector in England who doesn't know where Queen
  Elizabeth is buried!" he said, not without pride.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap08"
     id="chap08">VIII. &mdash; THE OFFENSIVE RAY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was perfectly absurd, Dick told himself a dozen times
  during the days which followed, that a grown man of his experience should
  punctiliously and solemnly strike from the calendar, one by one, the days
  which separated him from Sunday. A schoolboy might so behave, but it would
  have to be a very callow schoolboy. And a schoolboy might sit at his desk and
  dream away the time that might have been devoted to official
  correspondence.</p>

  <p>A pretty face...? Dick had admired many. A graciousness of carriage, an
  inspiring refinement of manner...? He gave up the attempt to analyse the
  attraction which Ella Bennett held. All that he knew was, that he was waiting
  impatiently for Sunday.</p>

  <p>When Dick opened the garden gate, he saw the plump figure of philosophical
  Johnson ensconced cosily in a garden chair. The secretary rose with a beaming
  smile and held out his hand. Dick liked the man. He stood for that patient
  class which, struggling under the stifling handicap of its own mediocrity,
  has its superlative virtue in loyalty and unremitting application to the task
  it finds at hand.</p>

  <p>"Ray told me you were coming, Mr. Gordon&mdash;he is with Miss Bennett in
  the orchard, and from a casual view of him just now, he is hearing a few home
  truths. What do you make of it?"</p>

  <p>"Has he given up coming to the office?" asked Dick, as he stripped his
  dust-coat.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid he is out for good." Johnson's face was sad. "I had to tell
  him to go. The old man found out that he'd been staying away, and by some
  uncanny and underground system of intelligence he has learnt that Ray was
  going the pace. He had an accountant in to see the books, but thank heaven
  they were O.K. I was very nearly fired myself."</p>

  <p>This was an opportunity not to be missed.</p>

  <p>"Do you know where Maitland lives&mdash;in what state? Has he a town
  house?"</p>

  <p>Johnson smiled.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, he has a town house all right," he said sarcastically. "I only
  discovered where it was a year ago, and I've never told a single soul until
  now. And even now I won't give details. But old Maitland is living in some
  place that is nearly a slum&mdash;living meanly and horribly like an
  unemployed labourer! And he is worth millions! He has a cheap house in one of
  the suburbs, a place I wouldn't use to stable a cow! He and his sister live
  there; she looks after the place and does the housekeeping. I guess she has a
  soft job. I've never known Maitland to spend a penny on himself. I'm sure
  that he is wearing the suit he wore when I first came to him. He has a penny
  glass of milk and a penny roll for lunch, and tries to swindle me into paying
  for that, some days!"</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Mr. Johnson, why does the old man wear gloves in the
  office?"</p>

  <p>Johnson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I used to think it was to hide the scar on the back of his
  hand, but he's not the kind of man to wear gloves for that. He is tattooed
  with crowns and anchors and dolphins all up his arms..."</p>

  <p>"And frogs?" asked Dick quietly, and the question seemed to surprise the
  other.</p>

  <p>"No, I've never seen a frog. There's a bunch of snakes on one wrist&mdash;
  I've seen that. Why, old man Maitland wouldn't be a Frog, would he?" he
  asked, and Dick smiled at the anxiety in his tone.</p>

  <p>"I wondered," he said.</p>

  <p>Johnson's usually cheerful countenance was glum.</p>

  <p>"I reckon he is mean enough to be a Frog or 'most anything," he said, and
  at that minute Ray and his sister came into view. On Ray's forehead sat a
  thundercloud, which deepened at the sight of Dick Gordon. The girl was
  flushed and obviously on the verge of tears.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Gordon!" the boy began without preliminary. "I fancy you're the
  fellow that has been carrying yarns to my sister. You set Elk to spy on
  me&mdash;I know, because I found Elk in the act."</p>

  <p>"Ray, you're not to speak like that to Mr. Gordon," interrupted the girl
  hotly. "He has never told me anything to your discredit. All I know I have
  seen. You seem to forget that Mr. Gordon is father's guest."</p>

  <p>"Everybody is fussing over me," Ray grumbled. "Even old Johnson!" He
  grinned sheepishly at the bald man, but Johnson did not return the smile.</p>

  <p>"Somebody has got to worry about you, boy," he said. The strained
  situation was only relieved when John Bennett, camera on back, came up the
  red path to greet his visitors.</p>

  <p>"Why, Mr. Johnson, I owe you many apologies for putting you off, but I'm
  glad to see you here at last. How is Ray doing at the office?"</p>

  <p>Johnson shot a helpless and pathetic glance at Dick. "Er&mdash;fine, Mr.
  Bennett," he blurted.</p>

  <p>So John Bennett was not to be told that his son had launched forth on a
  new career? The fact that he was fathering this deception made Dick Gordon a
  little uncomfortable. Apparently it reduced Mr. Johnson to despair, for when
  a somewhat tense luncheon had ended and they were alone again in the garden,
  that worthy man unburdened himself of his trouble.</p>

  <p>"I feel that I'm playing it low on old Bennett," he said. "Ray should have
  told him."</p>

  <p>Dick could only agree. He was in no mood to discuss Ray at the moment. The
  boy's annoyance and self-assurance irritated him, and it did not help matters
  to recognize the sudden and frank hostility which the brother of Ella Bennett
  was showing toward him. That was disconcerting, and emphasized his anomalous
  position in relation to the Bennetts. He was discovering what many young men
  in love have to discover: that the glamour which surrounds their dears does
  not extend to the relations and friends of their dears. He made yet another
  discovery. The plump Mr. Johnson was in love with the girl. He was nervous
  and incoherent in her presence; miserable when she went away. More miserable
  still when Dick boldly took her arm and led her into the rose-garden behind
  the house.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why that fellow comes here," said Ray savagely as the two
  disappeared. "He isn't a man of our class, and he loathes me."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that he loathes you, Ray," said Johnson, waking from the
  unhappy daydream into which he seemed to have fallen. "He's an extremely nice
  man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fiddlesticks!" said the other scornfully. "He's a snob! Anyway, he's a
  policeman, and I hate cops! If you imagine that he doesn't look down on you
  and me, you're wrong. I'm as good as he is, and I bet I'll make more money
  before I'm finished!"</p>

  <p>"Money isn't everything," said Johnson tritely. "What work are you doing,
  Ray?"</p>

  <p>It required a great effort on his part to bring his mind back to his
  friend's affairs.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you. It's very confidential," said Ray mysteriously. "I
  couldn't even tell Ella, though she's been jawing at me for hours. There are
  some jobs that a man can't speak about without betraying secrets that aren't
  his to tell. This is one of them."</p>

  <p>Mr. Johnson said nothing. He was thinking of Ella and wondering how long
  it would be before her good-looking companion brought her back.</p>

  <p>Good-looking and young. Mr. Johnson was not good-looking, and only just on
  the right side of fifty. And he was bald. But, worst of all, in her presence
  he was tongue-tied. He was rather amazed with himself.</p>

  <p>In the seclusion of the rose-garden another member of the Bennett family
  was relating her fears to a more sympathetic audience.</p>

  <p>"I feel that father guesses," she said. "He was out most of last night. I
  was awake when he came in, and he looked terrible. He said he had been
  walking about half the night, and by the mud on his boots I think he must
  have been."</p>

  <p>Dick did not agree.</p>

  <p>"Knowing very little about Mr. Bennett, I should hardly think he is the
  kind of man to suffer in silence where your brother is concerned," he said.
  "I could better imagine a most unholy row. Why has your brother become so
  unpleasant to me?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Ray has changed suddenly. This morning when he kissed me,
  his breath smelt of whisky&mdash;he never used to drink. This new life is
  ruining him&mdash;why should he take a false name if...if the work he is
  doing is quite straight?"</p>

  <p>She had ceased addressing him as "Mr. Gordon." The compromise of calling
  him by no name at all was very pleasant to Dick Gordon, because he recognized
  that it was a compromise. The day was hot and the sky cloudless. Ella had
  made arrangements to serve tea on the lawn, and she found two eager helpers
  in Dick and Johnson, galvanized to radiant activity by the opportunity of
  assisting. The boy's attitude remained antagonistic, and after a few futile
  attempts to overcome this, Dick gave it up.</p>

  <p>Even the presence of his father, who had kept aloof from the party all
  afternoon, brought no change for the better.</p>

  <p>"The worst of being a policeman is that you're always on duty," he said
  during the meal. "I suppose you're storing every scrap of talk in your mind,
  in case you have to use it."</p>

  <p>Dick folded a thin slice of bread and butter very deliberately before he
  replied.</p>

  <p>"I have certainly a good memory," he said. "It helps me to forget. It also
  helps me keep silent in circumstances which are very difficult and
  trying."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Ray spun round in his chair.</p>

  <p>"I told you he was on duty!" he cried triumphantly. "Look! There's the
  chief of the spy corps! The faithful Elk!"</p>

  <p>Dick looked in astonishment. He had left Elk on the point of going north
  to follow up a new Frog clue that had come to light. And there he was, his
  hands resting on the gate, his chin on his chest, gazing mournfully over his
  glasses at the group.</p>

  <p>"Can I come in, Mr. Bennett?"</p>

  <p>John Bennett, alert and watchful, beckoned.</p>

  <p>"Happened to be round about here, so I thought I'd call. Good afternoon,
  miss&mdash;good afternoon, Mr. Johnson."</p>

  <p>"Give Sergeant Elk your chair," growled John Bennett, and his son rose
  with a scowl.</p>

  <p>"Inspector," said Elk. "No, I'd rather stand, mister. Stand and grow good,
  eh? Yes, I'm Inspector. I don't realize it myself sometimes, especially when
  the men salute me&mdash;forget to salute 'em back. Now, in America I believe
  patrol men salute sergeants. That's as it should be."</p>

  <p>His sad eyes moved from one to the other.</p>

  <p>"I suppose your promotion has made a lot of crooks very scared, Elk?"
  sneered Ray.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes. I believe it has. Especially the amatchoors," said Elk. "The
  crooks that are only fly-nuts. The fancy crooks, who think they know it all,
  and will go on thinking so till one day somebody says, 'Get your
  hat&mdash;the chief wants you!' Otherwise," confessed Elk modestly, "the news
  has created no sensation, and London is just as full as ever of tale-
  pitchers who'll let you distribute their money amongst the poor if you'll
  only loan 'em a hundred to prove your confidence. And," Elk continued after a
  moment's cogitation, "there's nearly as many dud prize-fighters living on
  blackmail an' robbery, an' almost as many beautiful young ladies running faro
  parlours and dance emporiums."</p>

  <p>Ray's face went a dull red, and if looks could blast, Inspector Elk's
  friends would have been speaking of him in hushed tones.</p>

  <p>Only then did he turn his attention to Dick Gordon.</p>

  <p>"I was wondering, Captain, if I could have a day off next week&mdash;I've
  a little family trouble."</p>

  <p>Dick, who did not even know that his friend had a family was startled.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to hear that, Elk," he said sympathetically. Elk sighed.</p>

  <p>"It's hard on me," he said, "but I feel I ought to tell you, if you'll
  excuse me, Miss Bennett?"</p>

  <p>Dick rose and followed the detective to the gate, and then Elk spoke in a
  low tone.</p>

  <p>"Lord Farmley's house was burgled at one o'clock this morning, and the
  Frogs have got away with the draft treaty!"</p>

  <p>Watching the two furtively, the girl saw nothing in Dick Gordon's
  demeanour to indicate that he had received any news which was of consequence
  to himself. He came slowly back to the table.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I must go," he said. "Elk's trouble is sufficiently important
  to take me back to town."</p>

  <p>He saw the regret in Ella's eyes and was satisfied. The leave-taking was
  short, for it was very necessary that he should get back to town as quickly
  as his car could carry him.</p>

  <p>On the journey Elk told all that he knew. Lord Farmley had spent the
  week-end in his town house. He was working on two new clauses which had been
  inserted on the private representation of the American ambassador, who, as
  usual, held a watching brief in the matter, but managed (also as usual) to
  secure the amendment of a clause dealing with transhipments that, had it
  remained unamended, would have proved detrimental to his country. All this
  Dick learnt later. He was unaware at the time that the embassy knew of the
  treaty's existence.</p>

  <p>Lord Farmley had replaced the document in the safe, which was a "Cham" of
  the latest make, and built into the wall of his study, locked and
  double-locked the steel doors, switched on the burglar alarm, and went to
  bed.</p>

  <p>He had no occasion to go to the safe until after lunch. To all
  appearances, the safe-doors had not been touched. After lunch, intending to
  work again on the treaty, he put his key in the lock, to discover that, when
  it turned, the wards met no resistance. He pulled at the handle. It came away
  in his hand. The safe was open in the sense that it was not locked, and the
  treaty, together with his notes and amendments, had gone.</p>

  <p>"How did they get in?" asked Dick as the car whizzed furiously along the
  country road.</p>

  <p>"Pantry window&mdash;butlers' pantries were invented by a burglar-
  architect," said Elk. "It's a real job&mdash;the finest bit of work I've seen
  in twenty years, and there are only two men in the world who could have done
  it. No finger-prints, no ugly holes blown into the safe, everything neat and
  beautifully done. It's a pleasure to see."</p>

  <p>"I hope Lord Farmley has got as much satisfaction out of the workmanship
  as you have," said Dick grimly, and Elk sniffed.</p>

  <p>"He wasn't laughing," he said, "at least, not when I came away."</p>

  <p>His lordship was not laughing when Elk returned.</p>

  <p>"This is terrible, Gordon&mdash;terrible! We're holding a Cabinet on the
  matter this evening; the Prime Minister has returned to town. This means
  political ruin for me."</p>

  <p>"You think the Frogs are responsible?"</p>

  <p>Lord Farmley's answer was to pull open the door of the safe. On the inside
  panel was a white imprint, an exact replica of that which Elk had seen on the
  door of Mr. Broad's flat. It was almost impossible for the non-expert to
  discover how the safe had been opened. It was Elk who showed the fine work
  that had extracted the handle and had enabled the thieves to shatter the lock
  by some powerful explosive which nobody in the house had beard.</p>

  <p>"They used a silencer," said Elk. "It's just as easy to prevent gases
  escaping too quickly from a lock as it is from a gun barrel. I tell you,
  there are only two men who could have done this."</p>

  <p>"Who are they?"</p>

  <p>"Young Harry Lyme is one&mdash;he's been dead for years. And Saul Morris
  is the other&mdash;and Saul's dead too."</p>

  <p>"As the work is obviously not that of two dead men, you would be well
  advised to think of a third," said his lordship, pardonably annoyed.</p>

  <p>Elk shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"There must be a third, and he's the cleverest of the lot," he said,
  speaking his thoughts aloud. "I know the lot&mdash;Wal Cormon, George the
  Rat, Billy Harp, Ike Velleco, Pheeny Moore&mdash;and I'll take an oath that
  it wasn't any of them. This is master work, my lord. It's the work of a great
  artist such as we seldom meet nowadays. And I fancy I know who he is."</p>

  <p>Lord Farmley, who had listened as patiently as he could to this rhapsody,
  stalked from the library soon after, leaving the men alone.</p>

  <p>"Captain," said Elk, walking after the peer and closing the door, "do you
  happen to know where old Bennett was last night?"</p>

  <p>Elk's tone was careless, but Dick Gordon felt the underlying significance
  of the question, and for a moment, realizing all that lay behind the
  question, all that it meant to the girl, who was dearer to him than he had
  guessed, his breath came more quickly.</p>

  <p>"He was out most of the night," he said. "Miss Bennett told me that he
  went away on Friday and did not return until this morning at daybreak.
  Why?"</p>

  <p>Elk took a paper from his pocket, unfolded it slowly and adjusted his
  glasses.</p>

  <p>"I've had a man keeping tag of Bennett's absences from home," he said
  slowly. "It was easy, because the woman who goes every morning to clean his
  house has a wonderful memory. He has been away fifteen times this past year,
  and every time he has gone there's been a first-class burglary committed
  somewhere!"</p>

  <p>Dick drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"What are you suggesting?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm suggesting," replied Elk deliberately, "that if Bennett can't account
  for his movements on Saturday night, I'm going to pull him in. Saul Morris
  I've never met, nor young Harry Lyme either&mdash;they were before I did big
  work. But if my idea is right, Saul Morris isn't as dead as he ought to be.
  I'm going down to see Brother Bennett, and I think perhaps I'll be doing a
  bit of resurrecting!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap09"
     id="chap09">IX. &mdash; THE MAN WHO WAS WRECKED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">John Bennett was working in his garden in the early morning
  when Elk called, and the inspector came straight to the point.</p>

  <p>"There was a burglary committed at the residence of Lord Farmley on
  Saturday night and Sunday morning. Probably between midnight and three
  o'clock. The safe was blown and important documents stolen. I'm asking you to
  account for your movements on Saturday night and Sunday morning."</p>

  <p>Bennett looked the detective straight in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"I was on the London road&mdash;I walked from town. At two o'clock I was
  speaking with a policeman in Dorking. At midnight I was in Kingbridge, and
  again I spoke to a policeman. Both these men know me because I frequently
  walk to Dorking and Kingbridge. The man at Dorking is an amateur photographer
  like myself."</p>

  <p>Elk considered.</p>

  <p>"I've a car here; suppose you come along and see these policemen?" he
  suggested, and to his surprise Bennett agreed at once.</p>

  <p>At Dorking they discovered their man; he was just going off duty.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Inspector, I remember Mr. Bennett speaking to me. We were discussing
  animal photography."</p>

  <p>"You're sure of the time?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. At two o'clock the patrol sergeant visits me, and he came up
  whilst we were talking."</p>

  <p>The patrol sergeant, wakened from his morning sleep, confirmed this
  statement. The result of the Kingbridge inquiries produced the same
  results.</p>

  <p>Elk ordered the driver of his car to return to Horsham.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to apologize to you, Bennett," he said, "and you know
  enough about my work to appreciate my position."</p>

  <p>"I'm not complaining," said Bennett gruffly. "Duty is duty. But I'm
  entitled to know why you suspect me of all men in the world."</p>

  <p>Elk tapped the window of the car and it stopped.</p>

  <p>"Let's walk along the road: I can talk better," he said.</p>

  <p>They got out and went some distance without speaking.</p>

  <p>"Bennett, you're under suspicion for two reasons. You're a mystery man in
  the sense that nobody knows how you get a living. You haven't an income of
  your own. You haven't an occupation, and at odd intervals you disappear from
  home and nobody knows where you go. If you were a younger man I'd suspect a
  double life in the usual sense. But you're not that kind. That is suspicious
  circumstance Number One. Here is Number Two. Every time you disappear there's
  a big burglary somewhere. And I've an idea it's a Frog steal. I'll give you
  my theory. These Frogs are mostly dirt. There isn't enough brain in the whole
  outfit to fill an average nut&mdash;I'm talking about the mass of 'em. There
  are clever men higher up, I grant. But they don't include the regular fellows
  who make a living from crime. These boys haven't any time for such nonsense.
  They plan a job and pull it off, or they get pinched. If they make a getaway,
  they divide up the stuff and sit around in cafés with girls till all the
  stuff is gone, and then they go out for some more. But the Frogs are willing
  to pay good men who are outside the organization for extra work."</p>

  <p>"And you suggest that I may be one of the 'good men'?" said Bennett.</p>

  <p>"That's just what I am suggesting. This Frog job at Lord Farmley's was
  done by an expert&mdash;it looks like Saul Morris."</p>

  <p>His keen eyes were focused upon Bennett's face, but not by so much as a
  flicker of an eyelash did he betray his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"I remember Saul Morris," said Bennett slowly. "I've never seen him, but
  I've heard of his work. Was he&mdash;anything like me?"</p>

  <p>Elk pursed his lips, his chin went nearer to his chest, and his gaze
  became more and more intensified.</p>

  <p>"If you know anything about Saul Morris," he said slowly, "you also know
  that he was never in the hands of the police, that nobody except his own gang
  ever saw him, so as to be able to recognize him again."</p>

  <p>Another silence.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't aware of that," said Bennett.</p>

  <p>On the way back to the car, Bennett spoke again.</p>

  <p>"I bear no malice. My movements are suspicious, but there is a good
  reason. As to the burglaries&mdash;I know nothing about them. I should say
  that in any case, whether I knew or not. I ask you not to mention this matter
  to my daughter, because&mdash;well, you don't want me to tell you why."</p>

  <p>Ella was standing at the garden gate when the car came up, and at the
  sight of Elk the smile left her face. Elk knew instinctively that the thought
  of her brother, and the possibility of his being in trouble, were the causes
  of her apprehension.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Elk came down to ask me a few questions about the attack on Mr.
  Gordon," said her father briefly.</p>

  <p>Whatever else he was, thought Elk, he was a poor and unconvincing liar.
  That the girl was not convinced, he was sure. When they were alone she
  asked:</p>

  <p>"Is anything wrong, Mr. Elk?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, miss. Just come down to refresh my memory&mdash;which was never
  a good one, especially in the matter of dates. The only date I really
  remember is the landing of William the Conqueror-1140 or thereabouts. Brother
  gone back to town?"</p>

  <p>"He went last night," she said, and then, almost defiantly: "He is in a
  good position now, Mr. Elk."</p>

  <p>"So they tell me," said Elk. "I wish he wasn't working in the same shop as
  the bunch who are with him. I'm not letting him out of my sight, Miss
  Bennett," he said in a kinder tone. "Perhaps I'll be able to slip in the
  right word one of these days. He wouldn't listen now if I said 'get!'&mdash;
  he's naturally in the condition of mind when he's making up press cuttings
  about himself. And in a way he's right. If you don't know it all at
  twenty-one you never will. What's that word that begins with a
  'z'?&mdash;'zenith,' that's it. He's at the zenith of his
  sure-and-certainness. From now on he'll start unloading his cargo of dreams
  an' take in ballast. But he'll hate to hear the derricks at work."</p>

  <p>"You talk like a sailor," she smiled in spite of her trouble.</p>

  <p>"I was that once," said Elk, "the same as old man Maitland&mdash;though
  I've never sailed with him&mdash;I guess he left the sea years before I was
  born. Like him?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Maitland? No!" she shivered. "I think he is a terrible man."</p>

  <p>Elk did not disagree.</p>

  <p>To Dick Gordon that morning he confessed his error.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I jumped at Bennett," he said. "I'm getting young! I see
  the evening newspapers have got the burglary."</p>

  <p>"But they do not know what was stolen," said Dick in a low voice. "That
  must be kept secret."</p>

  <p>They were in the inner bureau, which Dick occupied temporarily. Two men
  were at work in his larger office replacing a panel which had been shattered
  by the bullet which had been fired at him on the morning Elk came into the
  case, and it was symptomatic of the effect that the Frogs had had upon
  headquarters that both men had almost mechanically scrutinized the left arms
  of the workmen. The sight of the damaged panel switched Elk's thoughts to a
  matter which he had intended raising before&mdash;the identity of the tramp
  Carlo. In spite of the precautions Gordon had taken, and although the man was
  under observation, Carlo had vanished, and the combined efforts of
  headquarters and the country offices had failed to locate him. It was a sore
  point with Gordon, as Elk had reason to know.</p>

  <p>For Carlo was the reputable "Number Seven," the most important man in the
  organization after the Frog himself.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see this Carlo," he said thoughtfully. "There's not much use
  in putting another man out on the road to follow up Genter's work. That
  system doesn't work twice. I wonder how much Lola knows?"</p>

  <p>"Of the Frogs? They wouldn't trust a woman," said Dick. "She may work for
  them, but, as you said, it is likely they bring in outsiders for special jobs
  and pay them well."</p>

  <p>Elk did not carry the matter any further, and spent the rest of the day in
  making fruitless inquiries. Returning to his room at headquarters that night,
  he sat for along time hunched up in his chair, his hands thrust into his
  trousers pockets, staring down at the blotting-pad. Then he pressed a bell,
  and his clerk, Balder, came.</p>

  <p>"Go to Records, get me all that is known about every safe-breaker known in
  this country. You needn't worry about the German and French, but there's a
  Swede or two who are mighty clever with the lamp, and of course there are the
  Americans."</p>

  <p>They came after a long interval&mdash;a considerable pile of papers,
  photographs and finger-prints.</p>

  <p>"You can go, Balder&mdash;the night man can take them back." He settled
  himself down to an enjoyable night's reading.</p>

  <p>He was nearing the end of the pile when he came to the portrait of a young
  man with a drooping moustache and a bush of curly hair. It was one of those
  sharp positives that unromantic police officials take, and showed whatever
  imperfections of skin there were. Beneath the photograph was the name,
  carefully printed: "Henry John Lyme, R.V."</p>

  <p>"R.V." was the prison code. Every year from 1874 to 1899 was indicated by
  a capital letter in the alphabet. Thereafter ran the small letters. The "R"
  meant that Henry J. Lyme had been sentenced to penal servitude in 1891. The
  "V" that he had suffered a further term of convict imprisonment in 1895.</p>

  <p>Elk read the short and terrible record. Born in Guernsey in 1873, the man
  had been six times convicted before he was twenty (the minor convictions are
  not designated by letters in the code). In the space at the foot of the blank
  in which particulars were given of his crime, were the words:</p>

  <p>"Dangerous; carries firearms." In another hand, and in the red ink which
  is used to close a criminal career, was written: "Died at sea. Channel Queen.
  Black Rock. Feb. 1, 1898."</p>

  <p>Elk remembered the wreck of the Guernsey mail packet on the Black
  Rocks.</p>

  <p>He turned back the page to read particulars of the dead man's crimes, and
  the comments of those who from time to time had been brought into official
  contact with him. In these scraps of description was the real biography.
  "Works alone," was one comment, and another: "No women clue&mdash;women never
  seen with him." A third scrawl was difficult to decipher, but when Elk
  mastered the evil writing, he half rose from the chair in his excitement. It
  was:</p>

  <p>"Add to body marks in general D.C.P.14 frog tattooed left wrist. New.
  J.J.M."</p>

  <p>The date against which this was written was the date of the man's last
  conviction. Elk turned up the printed blank "D.C.P.14" and found it to be a
  form headed "Description of Convicted Person." The number was the
  classification. There was no mention of tattooed frogs: somebody had been
  careless. Word by word he read the description:</p>

  <p>"Henry John Lyme, a. Young Harry, a. Thomas Martin, a. Boy Peace, a. Boy
  Harry (there were five lines of aliases). Burglar (dangerous; carries
  firearms). Height 5 ft. 6 in. Chest 38. Complexion fresh, eyes grey, teeth
  good, mouth regular, dimple in chin. Nose straight. Hair brown, wavy, worn
  long. Face round. Moustache drooping; wears side-whiskers. Feet and hands
  normal. Little toe left foot amputated first joint owing to accident, H.M.
  Prison, Portland. Speaks well, writes good hand. Hobbies none. Smokes
  cigarettes. Poses as public official, tax collector, sanitary inspector, gas
  or water man. Speaks French and Italian fluently. Never drinks; plays cards
  but no gambler. Favourite hiding place, Rome or Milan. No conviction abroad.
  No relations. Excellent organizer. Immediately after crime, look for him at
  good hotel in Midlands or working to Hull for the Dutch or Scandinavian
  boats. Has been known to visit Guernsey..."</p>

  <p>Here followed the Bertillon measurements and body marks&mdash;this was in
  the days before the introduction of the fingerprint system. But there was no
  mention of the Frog on the left wrist. Elk dropped his pen in the ink and
  wrote in the missing data. Underneath he added:</p>

  <p>"This man may still be alive," and signed his initials.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">X. &mdash; ON HARLEY TERRACE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">So writing, the telephone buzzed, and in his unhurried way
  he finished his entry and blotted it before he took up the instrument.</p>

  <p>"Captain Gordon wishes you to take the first taxi you can find and come to
  his house&mdash;the matter is very urgent," said a voice. "I am speaking from
  Harley Terrace."</p>

  <p>"All right." Elk found his hat and umbrella, stopped long enough to return
  the records to their home, and went out into the dark courtyard.</p>

  <p>There are two entrances to Scotland Yard: one that opens into Whitehall
  and was by far the best route for him, since Whitehall is filled with cabs;
  the other on to the Thames Embankment, which, in addition to offering the
  longest way round, would bring him to a thoroughfare where, at this hour of
  the night, taxis would be few and far between. So engrossed was Elk with his
  thoughts that he was on the Embankment before he realized where he was going.
  He turned toward the Houses of Parliament into Bridge Street, found an
  ancient cab and gave the address. The driver was elderly and probably a
  little fuddled, for, instead of stopping at No. 273, he overshot the mark by
  a dozen houses, and only stopped at all on the vitriolic representations of
  his fare.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you, Noah?&mdash;this ain't Mount Ararat!" snapped
  Elk as he descended. "You're boozed, you poor fish."</p>

  <p>"Wish I was," murmured the driver, holding out his hand for the fare.</p>

  <p>Elk would have argued the matter but for the urgency of the summons.
  Whilst he was waiting for the driver to unbutton his many coats to find
  change, he glanced back along the street. A car was standing near the door of
  Dick Gordon's house, its head lights dimmed to the least possible degree.
  That in itself was not remarkable. The two men who waited on the pavement
  were. They stood with their backs to the railings, one (as he guessed) on
  either side of the door. To him came the soft purring of the motor-car's
  engine. He took a step back and brought the opposite pavement into his range
  of vision. There were two other men, also lounging idly, and they were
  exactly opposite 273.</p>

  <p>Elk looked round. The cab had stopped before a doctor's house, and the
  detective did not take a long time to make up his mind.</p>

  <p>"Wait till I come out."</p>

  <p>"Don't be long," pleaded the aged driver. "The bars will be shut in a
  quarter of an hour."</p>

  <p>"Wait, Batchus," said Elk, who had a nodding acquaintance with ancient
  mythology, but only a hazy idea of pronunciation. Bacchus growled, but
  waited.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the doctor was at home, and to him Elk revealed his identity.
  In a few seconds he was connected with Mary Lane Police Station.</p>

  <p>"Elk, Central Office, speaking," he said rapidly, and gave his code
  number. "Send every man you can put your hand on, to close Harley Terrace
  north and south of 273. Stop all cars from the moment you get my
  signal&mdash;two long two short flashes. How soon can your men be in
  place?"</p>

  <p>"In five minutes, Mr. Elk. The night reliefs are parading, and I have a
  couple of motor-trucks here&mdash;just pinched the drivers for being
  drunk."</p>

  <p>He replaced the receiver and went into the hall.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong?" asked the startled doctor as Elk slid back the jacket of
  his automatic and pushed the safety catch into place.</p>

  <p>"I hope so, sir," said Elk truthfully. "If I've turned out the division
  because a few innocent fellows are leaning against the railings of Harley
  Terrace, I'm going to get myself into trouble."</p>

  <p>He waited five minutes, then opened the door and went out. The men were
  still in their positions, and as he stood there two motor-trucks drove into
  the thoroughfare from either end, turned broadside in the middle of the road
  and stopped.</p>

  <p>Elk's pocket lamp flashed to left and right, and he jumped for the
  pavement.</p>

  <p>And now he saw that his suspicions were justified. The men on the opposite
  pavement came across the road at the double, and leapt to the running-board
  of the car with the dim lights as it moved. Simultaneously the two who had
  been guarding the entrance of 273 sprang into the machine. But the fugitives
  were too late. The car swerved to avoid the blocking motor-truck, but even as
  it turned, the truck ran backwards. There was a crash, a sound of splintering
  glass, and by the time Elk arrived, the five occupants of the car were in the
  hands of the uniformed policemen who swarmed at the end of the street.</p>

  <p>The prisoners accepted their capture without resistance. One (the
  chauffeur) who tried to throw away a revolver unobtrusively, was detected in
  the act and handcuffed, but the remainder gave no trouble.</p>

  <p>At the police-station Elk had a view of his prisoners. Four very fine
  specimens of the genus tramp, wearing their new ready-to-wear suits
  awkwardly. The fifth, who gave a Russian name, and was obviously the driver,
  a little man with small, sharp eyes that glanced uneasily from face to
  face.</p>

  <p>Two of the prisoners carried loaded revolvers; in the car they found four
  walking-sticks heavily weighted.</p>

  <p>"Take off your coats and roll up your sleeves," commanded the
  inspector.</p>

  <p>"You needn't trouble, Elk." It was the little chauffeur speaking. "All us
  boys are good Frogs."</p>

  <p>"There ain't any good Frogs," said Elk. "There's only bad Frogs and worse
  Frogs and the worst Frog of all. But we won't argue. Let these men into their
  cells, sergeant, and keep them separate. I'll take Litnov to
  headquarters."</p>

  <p>The chauffeur looked uneasily from Elk to the station sergeant.</p>

  <p>"What's the great idea?" he asked. "You're not allowed to use the third
  degree in England."</p>

  <p>"The law has been altered," said Elk ominously, and re-snapped the
  handcuffs on the man's wrists.</p>

  <p>The law had not been altered, but this the little Russian did not know.
  Throughout the journey to headquarters he communed with himself, and when he
  was pushed into Elk's bare-looking room, he was prepared to talk...</p>

  <p>Dick was waiting for the detective when he came back to Harley Terrace,
  and heard the story.</p>

  <p>"I never dreamt that it was a plant until I spotted the lads waiting for
  me," said Elk. "Of course you didn't telephone; they caught me napping there.
  Thorough! The Frogs are all that! They expected me to leave headquarters by
  the Whitehall entrance, and had a taxi waiting to pick me up, but in case
  they missed me that way, they told off a party to meet me in Harley Terrace.
  Thorough!"</p>

  <p>"'Who gave them their orders?"</p>

  <p>Elk shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Nobody. Litnov had his by post. It was signed 'Seven,' and gave him
  the rendezvous, and that was all. He says he has never seen a Frog since he
  was initiated. Where he was sworn in he doesn't remember. The car belongs to
  Frogs, and he receives so much a week for looking after it. Ordinarily he is
  employed by Heron's Club&mdash;drives a truck for them. He tells me that
  there are twenty other cars cached in London somewhere, just standing in
  their garages, and each has its own driver, who goes once a week to give it a
  clean up."</p>

  <p>"Heron's Club&mdash;that is the dance club which Lola and Lew Brady are
  interested in!" said Dick thoughtfully, and Elk considered.</p>

  <p>"I never thought of that. Of course, it doesn't mean that the management
  of Heron's know anything about Litnov's evening work. I'll look up that
  club."</p>

  <p>He was saved the trouble, for the next morning, when he reached the
  office, he found a man waiting to see him.</p>

  <p>"I'm Mr. Hagn, the manager of the Heron's Club," he introduced himself. "I
  understand one of my men has been in trouble."</p>

  <p>Hagn was a tall, good-looking Swede who spoke without any trace of a
  foreign accent.</p>

  <p>"How have you heard that, Mr. Hagn?" asked Elk suspiciously. "The man has
  been under lock and key since last night, and he hasn't held any
  communication with anybody."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hagn smiled.</p>

  <p>"You can't arrest people and take them to a police-station without
  somebody knowing all about it," he said with truth. "One of my waiters saw
  Litnov being taken to Mary Lane handcuffed, and as Litnov hasn't reported for
  duty this morning, there was only one conclusion to be drawn. What is the
  trouble, Mr. Elk?"</p>

  <p>Elk shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I can't give you any information on the matter," he said.</p>

  <p>"Can I see him?"</p>

  <p>"You can't even see him," said Elk. "He has slept well, and sends his love
  to all kind friends."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hagn seemed distressed.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible to discover where he put the key of the coal cellar?" he
  urged. "This is rather important to me. This man usually keeps it."</p>

  <p>The detective hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I can find out," he said, and, leaving Mr. Hagn under the watchful eyes
  of his secretary, he crossed the yard to the cells where the Russian was
  held.</p>

  <p>Litnov rose from his plank bed as the cell door opened.</p>

  <p>"Friend of yours called," said Elk. "Wants to know where you put the key
  of the coal cellar."</p>

  <p>It was only the merest flicker of light and understanding that came to the
  little man's eyes, but Elk saw it.</p>

  <p>"Tell him I believe I left it with the Wandsworth man," he said.</p>

  <p>"Um!" said Elk, and went back to the waiting Hagn.</p>

  <p>"He said he left it in the Pentonville Road," said Elk untruthfully, but
  Mr. Hagn seemed satisfied.</p>

  <p>Returning to the cells, Elk saw the gaoler.</p>

  <p>"Has this man asked you where he was to be taken from here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the officer. "I told him he was going to Wandsworth
  Prison&mdash;we usually tell prisoners where they are going on remand, in
  case they wish to let their relatives know."</p>

  <p>Elk had guessed right. The inquiry about the key was prearranged. A
  telephone message to Mary Lane, where the remainder of the gang were held,
  produced the curious information that a woman, reputedly the wife of one of
  the men, had called that morning, and, on being refused an interview, begged
  for news about the missing key of the coal cellar, and had been told that it
  was in the possession of "the Brixton man."</p>

  <p>"The men are to be remitted to Wormwood Scrubbs Prison, and they are not
  to be told where they are going," ordered Elk.</p>

  <p>That afternoon a horse-driven prison-van drew out of Cannon Row and
  rumbled along Whitehall. At the juncture of St. Martin's Lane and Shaftesbury
  Avenue, a carelessly-driven motor lorry smashed into its side, slicing off
  the near wheel. Instantly there came from nowhere a crowd of remarkable
  appearance. It seemed as if all the tramps in the world had been lying in
  wait to crowd about the crippled van. The door was wrenched open, and the
  gaoler on duty hauled forth. Before he could be handled, the van disgorged
  twenty Central Office men, and from the side streets came a score of mounted
  policemen, clubs in hand. The riot lasted less than three minutes. Some of
  the wild-looking men succeeded in making their escape, but the majority,
  chained in twos, went, meekly enough, between their mounted escorts.</p>

  <p>Dick Gordon, who was also something of an organizer, watched the fight
  from the top of an omnibus, which, laden with policemen, had shadowed the
  van. He joined Elk after the excitement had subsided.</p>

  <p>"Have you arrested anybody of importance?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It's too early to say," said Elk. "They look like ordinary tadpoles to
  me. I guess Litnov is in Wandsworth by now&mdash;I sent him in a closed
  police car before the van left."</p>

  <p>Arrived at Scotland Yard, he paraded the Frogs in two open ranks, watched,
  at a distance, by the curious crowd which packed both entrances. One by one
  he examined their wrists, and in every case the tattoo mark was present.</p>

  <p>He finished his scrutiny at last, and his captives were herded into an
  inner yard under an armed guard.</p>

  <p>"One man wants to speak to you, sir."</p>

  <p>The last file had disappeared when the officer in charge reported, and Elk
  exchanged a glance with his chief.</p>

  <p>"See him," said Dick. "We can't afford to miss any information."</p>

  <p>A policeman brought the Frog to them&mdash;a tall man with a week's growth
  of beard, poorly dressed and grimy. His battered hat was pulled down over his
  eyes, his powerful wrists visible beneath the sleeves of a jacket that was
  made for a smaller man.</p>

  <p>"Well, Frog?" said Elk, glowering at him. "What's your croak?"</p>

  <p>"Croak is a good word," said the man, and at the sound of his voice Elk
  stared. "You don't think that old police car of yours is going to reach
  Wandsworth, do you?"</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" asked Elk, peering forward.</p>

  <p>"They want Litnov badly," said the Frog. "They want to settle with him,
  and if the poor fish thinks it's brotherly love that makes old man Frog go to
  all this trouble, he's reserved a big jar for himself."</p>

  <p>"Broad! What...!"</p>

  <p>The American licked his finger and wiped away the frog from his wrist.</p>

  <p>"I'll explain after, Mr. Elk, but take a friend's advice and call up
  Wandsworth."</p>

  <p>Elk's telephone was buzzing furiously when he reached his office.</p>

  <p>It was Wandsworth station calling.</p>

  <p>"Your police car was held up on the Common, two of your men were wounded,
  and the prisoner was shot dead," was the report.</p>

  <p>"Thank you!" said Elk bitterly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">XI. &mdash; MR. BROAD EXPLAINS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Detained under police supervision, Mr. Broad did not seem in
  any way surprised or disconcerted. Dick Gordon and his assistant reached
  Wandsworth Common ten minutes after the news came through, and found the
  wreckage of the police car surrounded by a large crowd, kept at a distance by
  police.</p>

  <p>The dead prisoner had been taken into the prison, together with one of the
  attackers, who had been captured by a party of warders, returning to the gaol
  after their luncheon hour.</p>

  <p>A brief examination of Litnov told them no more than they knew. He had
  been shot through the heart, and death must have been instantaneous.</p>

  <p>The prisoner, brought from a cell, was a man of thirty and better educated
  than the average run of Frogs. No weapon had been found upon him and he
  protested his innocence of any complicity in the plot. According to his
  story, he was an out-of-work clerk who had been strolling across the Common
  when the ambush occurred. He had seen the fight, seen the second motor-car
  which carried the attackers away, and had been arrested whilst running in
  pursuit of the murderers.</p>

  <p>His captors told a different story. The warder responsible for his arrest
  said that the man was on the point of boarding the car when the officer had
  thrown his truncheon at him and brought him down. The car was moving at the
  time, and the remainder of the party had not dared to stop and pick up their
  comrade. Most damning evidence of all was the tattoo mark on his wrist.</p>

  <p>"Frog, you're a dead man," said Elk in his most sepulchral voice. "Where
  did you live when you were alive?" The captive confessed that his home was in
  North London. "North Londoners don't come to Wandsworth to walk on the
  Common," said Elk.</p>

  <p>He had a conference with the chief warder, and, taking the prisoner into
  the courtyard, Elk spoke his mind.</p>

  <p>"What happens to you if you spill the beans, Frog?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man showed his teeth in an unpleasant smile.</p>

  <p>"The beans aren't grown that I can spill," he said.</p>

  <p>Elk looked around. The courtyard was a small, stone-paved quadrangle,
  surrounded by high, discoloured walls. Against one of these was a little shed
  with grey sliding doors.</p>

  <p>"Come here," said Elk.</p>

  <p>He took the key that the chief warder had given him, unlocked the doors
  and slid them back. They were looking into a bare, clean apartment with
  whitewashed walls. Across the ceiling ran two stout oak beams, and between
  them three stubby steel bars.</p>

  <p>The prisoner frowned as Elk walked to a long steel lever near one of the
  walls.</p>

  <p>"Watch, Frog!" he said.</p>

  <p>He pulled at the lever, and the centre of the floor divided and fell with
  a crash, revealing a deep, brick-lined pit.</p>

  <p>"See that trap...see that 'T' mark in chalk? That's where a man puts his
  feet when the hangman straps his legs. The rope hangs from that beam,
  Frog!"</p>

  <p>The man's face was livid as he shrank back.</p>

  <p>"You...can't...hang&mdash;me," he breathed. "I've done nothing!"</p>

  <p>"You've killed a man," said Elk as he pulled the doors to and locked them.
  "You're the only fellow we've got, and you'll have to suffer for the lot. Are
  them beans growin'?"</p>

  <p>The prisoner raised his shaking hand to his lips.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you all I know," he said huskily.</p>

  <p>Elk led him back to his cell.</p>

  <p>An hour later, Dick was speeding back to his headquarters with
  considerable information. His first act was to send for Joshua Broad, and the
  eagle-faced "tramp" came cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Broad, I'll have your story," said Dick, and motioned the other
  to be seated.</p>

  <p>Joshua seated himself slowly.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing much to tell," he said. "For a week I've been getting
  acquainted with the Frogs. I guessed that it was unlikely that the bulk of
  them would be unknown to one another, and I just froze on to the first I
  found. Met him in a Deptford lodging-house. Then I heard there was a hurry-up
  call for a big job to-day and joined. The Frogs knew that the real attack
  might be somewhere else, and on the way to Scotland Yard I heard that a party
  had been told off to watch for Litnov at Wandsworth."</p>

  <p>"Did you see any of the big men?"</p>

  <p>Broad shook his head.</p>

  <p>"They looked all alike, but undoubtedly there were two or three section
  leaders in charge. There was never any question of rescuing. They were out to
  kill. They knew that Litnov had told all that he knew, and he was
  doomed&mdash;they got him, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;they got him!" said Dick, and then: "What is your interest in
  the Frogs?"</p>

  <p>"Purely adventitious," replied the other lazily. "I'm a rich man with a
  whole lot of time on my hands, and I have a big interest in criminology. A
  few years ago I heard about the Frogs, and they seized on my imagination.
  Since then I've been trailing them."</p>

  <p>His gaze did not waver under Dick Gordon's scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"Now will you tell me," said Dick quietly, "how you became a rich man? In
  the latter days of the war you arrived in this country on a cattle
  boat&mdash;with about twenty dollars in your pocket. You told Elk you had
  arrived by that method, and you spoke the truth. I've been almost as much
  interested in you as you have been in the Frogs," he said with a half smile,
  "and I have been putting through a few inquiries. You came to England 1917
  and deserted your ship. In May, 1917, you negotiated for the hire of an old
  tumbledown shack near Eastleigh, Hampshire. There you lived, patching up this
  crazy cottage and living, so far as I can discover, on the few dollars you
  brought from the ship. Then suddenly you disappeared, and were next seen in
  Paris on Christmas Eve of that year. You were conspicuous in rescuing a
  family that had been buried in a house bombed in an air raid, and your name
  was taken by the police with the idea of giving you some reward. The French
  police report is that you were 'very poorly dressed'&mdash;they thought you
  might be a deserter from the American Army. Yet in February you were staying
  at the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo, with plenty of money and an extensive
  wardrobe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Joshua Broad sat through the recital unmoved, except for the ghost of a
  smile which showed at the corner of his unshaven mouth.</p>

  <p>"Surely, Captain, Monte Carlo is the place where a man <i>would</i> have
  money?"</p>

  <p>"If he brought it there," said Dick, and went on: "I'm not suggesting that
  you are a bad character, or that your money came in any other way than
  honestly. I merely state the facts that your sudden rise from poverty to
  riches was, to say the least, remarkable."</p>

  <p>"It surely was," agreed the other; "and, judging by appearances, my change
  from riches to poverty is as sudden."</p>

  <p>Dick looked at the dirty-looking tramp who sat on the other side of the
  table and laughed silently.</p>

  <p>"You mean, if it is possible for you to masquerade now, it was possible
  then, and that, even though you were apparently broke in 1917, you might very
  well have been a rich man?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Mr. Joshua Broad.</p>

  <p>Gordon was serious again.</p>

  <p>"I would prefer that you remained your more presentable self," he said. "I
  hate telling an American that I may have to deport him, because that sounds
  as if it is a punishment to return to the United States. But I may find
  myself with no other alternative."</p>

  <p>Joshua Broad rose.</p>

  <p>"That, Captain Gordon, is too broad for a hint and too kindly for a
  threat&mdash;henceforth, Joshua Broad is a respectable member of society.
  Maybe I'll take the Prince of Caux's house and entertain bims and be a modern
  Harun al Raschid. I've got to meet them somehow."</p>

  <p>At the mention of that show house that had cost a king's ransom to build
  and a queen's dowry to furnish, Dick smiled.</p>

  <p>"It isn't necessary you should advertise your respectability that way," he
  said. But Broad was not smiling.</p>

  <p>"The only thing I ask is that you do not advise the police to withdraw my
  permits," he said.</p>

  <p>Dick's eyebrows rose.</p>

  <p>"Permits?"</p>

  <p>"I carry two guns, and the time is coming when two won't be enough," said
  Mr. Broad. "And it is coming soon."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12">XII. &mdash; THE EMBELLISHMENT OF MR. MAITLAND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was a concert that night at the Queen's Hall, and the
  spacious auditorium was crowded to hear the summer recital of a great
  violinist. Dick Gordon, in the midst of an evening's work, remembered that he
  had reserved a seat. He felt fagged, baffled, inclined to hopelessness. A
  note from Lord Farmley had come to him, urging instant action to recover the
  lost commercial treaty. It was such a letter as a man, himself worried, would
  write without realizing that in so doing he was passing on his panic to those
  who it was very necessary should not be stampeded into precipitate action. It
  was a human letter, but not statesmanlike. Dick decided upon the concert.</p>

  <p>He had finished dressing when he remembered that it was more than likely
  that the omniscient Frogs would know of his reservation. He must take the
  risk, if risk there was. He 'phoned to the garage where his own machine was
  housed and hired a closed car, and in ten minutes was one of two thousand
  people who were listening, entranced, to the master. In the interval he
  strolled out to the lobby to smoke, and almost the first person he saw was a
  Central Office man who avoided his eye. Another detective stood by the
  stairway leading to the bar, a third was smoking on the steps of the hall
  outside. But the sensation of the evening was not this evidence of Elk's
  foresight. The warning bell had sounded, and Dick was in the act of throwing
  away his cigarette, when a magnificent limousine drew up before the building,
  a smart footman alighted to open the door, and there stepped heavily to the
  pavement&mdash;Mr. Ezra Maitland.</p>

  <p>Dick heard a gasp behind him, and turned his head to see Elk in the one
  and only dress suit he had ever possessed.</p>

  <p>"Mother of Moses!" he said in an awed voice.</p>

  <p>And there was reason for his astonishment. Not only was Mr. Maitland's
  equipage worthy of a reigning monarch, with its silver fittings, lacquered
  body and expensively uniformed servants, but the old man was wearing a dress
  suit of the latest fashion. His beard had been shortened a few inches, and
  across the spotless white waistcoat was stretched a heavy gold chain. On his
  hand many rings blazed and flashed in the light of the street standard. There
  was a camellia in his perfect lapel, and on his head the glossiest of silk
  hats. Leaning on a stick of ebony and ivory, he strutted across the
  pavement.</p>

  <p>"Silk socks...patent leather shoes. My God! Look at his <i>rings</i>,"
  hissed Elk.</p>

  <p>His profanity was almost excusable. The vision of splendour passed through
  the doors into the hall.</p>

  <p>"He's gone gay!" said Elk hollowly, and followed like a man in a
  dream.</p>

  <p>From where he was placed, Dick had a good view of the millionaire. He sat
  throughout the second part of the programme with closed eyes, and so slow was
  he to start applauding after each item, that Dick was certain that he had
  been asleep and the clapping had awakened him.</p>

  <p>Once he detected the old man stifling a yawn in the very midst of the
  second movement of Elgar's violin concerto, which held the audience
  spellbound by its delicate beauty. With his big hands, now enshrined in white
  kid gloves, crossed on his stomach, the head of Mr. Maitland nodded and
  jerked.</p>

  <p>When at last the concert was over, he looked round fearfully, as though to
  make absolutely certain that it was over, then rose and made his way out of
  the hall, his silk hat held clumsily in his hand.</p>

  <p>A manager came in haste to meet him.</p>

  <p>"I hope, Mr. Maitland, you enjoyed yourself?" Dick heard him say.</p>

  <p>"Very pooty&mdash;very pooty," replied Maitland hoarsely. "That fiddler
  ought to play a few toons, though&mdash;nothing like a hornpipe on a
  fiddle."</p>

  <p>The manager looked after him open-mouthed, then hurried out to help the
  old man into his car.</p>

  <p>"Gay&mdash;he's gay!" said Elk, as bewildered as the manager. "Jumping
  snakes! Who was that?"</p>

  <p>He addressed the unnecessary question to the manager, who had returned
  from his duty.</p>

  <p>"That is Maitland, the millionaire, Mr. Elk," said the other. "First time
  we've had him here, but now that he's come to live in town&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where is he living?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>"He has taken the Prince of Caux's house in Berkeley Square," said the
  manager.</p>

  <p>Elk blinked at him.</p>

  <p>"Say that again?"</p>

  <p>"He has taken the Prince of Caux's house," said the manager. "And what is
  more, has bought it&mdash;the agent told me this afternoon."</p>

  <p>Elk was incapable of comment, and the manager continued his surprising
  narrative.</p>

  <p>"I don't think he knows much about music, but he has booked seats for
  every big musical event next season&mdash;his secretary came in this
  afternoon. He seemed a bit dazed."</p>

  <p>Poor Johnson! thought Dick.</p>

  <p>"He wanted me to fix dancing lessons for the old boy&mdash;" Elk clapped
  his hand to his mouth&mdash;he had an insane desire to scream.</p>

  <p>"And as a matter of fact, I fixed them. He's a bit old, but Socrates or
  somebody learnt Greek at eighty, and maybe Mr. Maitland's regretting the
  wasted years of his life. I admit it is a bit late to start night
  clubs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elk laid a chiding hand upon the managerial shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You certainly deceived me, brother," he said. "And here was I, drinking
  it all in, and you with a face as serious as the dial of a poor-house clock!
  You've put it all over Elk, and I'm man enough to admit you fooled me."</p>

  <p>"I don't think our friend is trying to fool you," said Dick quietly. "You
  really mean what you say&mdash;old Maitland has started dancing and night
  clubs?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly!" said the other. "He hasn't started dancing, but that is where
  he has gone to-night&mdash;to the Heron's. I heard him tell the
  chauffeur."</p>

  <p>It was incredible, but a little amusing&mdash;most amusing of all to see
  Elk's face.</p>

  <p>The detective was frankly dumbfounded by the news.</p>

  <p>"Heron's is my idea of a good finish to a happy evening," said Elk at
  last, drawing a long breath. He beckoned one of his escort. "How many man do
  you want to cover Heron's Club?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Six," was the prompt reply. "Ten to raid it, and twenty for a rough
  house."</p>

  <p>"Get thirty!" said Elk emphatically.</p>

  <p>Heron's from the exterior was an unpretentious building. But once under
  the curtained doors, and the character of its exterior was forgotten. A
  luxurious lounge, softly lit and heavily carpeted, led to the large saloon,
  which was at once restaurant and dance-hall.</p>

  <p>Dick stood in the doorway awaiting the arrival of the manager, and admired
  the richness and subtle suggestion of cosiness which the room conveyed. The
  tables were set about an oblong square of polished flooring; from a gallery
  at the far end came the strain of a coloured orchestra; and on the floor
  itself a dozen couples swayed and glided in rhythm to the staccato
  melody.</p>

  <p>"Gilded vice," said Elk disparagingly. "A regular haunt of sin and
  self-indulgence. I wonder what they charge for the food&mdash;there's
  Mathusalem."</p>

  <p>"Mathusalem" was sitting, a conspicuous figure, at the most prominent
  table in the room. His polished head glistened in the light from the crystal
  candelabras, and in the shadow that it cast, his patriarchal beard so melted
  into the white of his snowy shirt front that for a moment Dick did not
  recognize him.</p>

  <p>Before him was set a large glass mug filled with beer. "He's human
  anyway," said Elk.</p>

  <p>Hagn came at that moment, smiling, affable, willing to oblige.</p>

  <p>"This is an unexpected pleasure, Captain," he said. "You want me to pass
  you in? Gentlemen, there is no necessity! Every police officer of rank is an
  honorary member of the club."</p>

  <p>He bustled in, threading his way between the tables, and found them a
  vacant sofa in one of the alcoves. There were revellers whose faces showed
  alarm at the arrival of the new guests&mdash;one at least stole forth and did
  not come back.</p>

  <p>"We have many notable people here to-night," said Hagn, rubbing his hands.
  "There are Lord and Lady Belfin "...he mentioned others; "and that gentleman
  with the beard is the great Maitland...his secretary is here somewhere. Poor
  gentleman, I fear he is not happy. But I invited him myself&mdash;it is
  sometimes desirable that we should elect the...what shall I say?...higher
  servants of important people?"</p>

  <p>"Johnson?" asked Dick in surprise. "Where?"</p>

  <p>Presently he saw that plump and philosophical man. He sat in a remote
  corner, looking awkward and miserable in his old-fashioned dress clothes.
  Before him was a glass which, Dick guessed, contained orange squash.</p>

  <p>A solemn, frightened figure he made, sitting on the edge of his chair, his
  big red hands resting on the table. Dick Gordon laughed softly and whispered
  to Elk:</p>

  <p>"Go and get him!"</p>

  <p>Elk, who was never self-conscious, walked through the dancers and reached
  Mr. Johnson, who looked up startled and shook hands with the vigour of one
  rescued from a desert island.</p>

  <p>"It was good of you to ask me to come over," said Johnson, as he greeted
  Dick. "This is new to me, and I'm feeling about as much at home as a chicken
  in a pie."</p>

  <p>"Your first visit?"</p>

  <p>"And my last," said Johnson emphatically. "This isn't the kind of life
  that I care for. It interferes with my reading, and it&mdash;well, it's
  sad."</p>

  <p>His eyes were fixed on a noisy little party in the opposite alcove. Gordon
  had seen them almost as soon as he had sat down. Ray, in his most hectic
  mood, Lola Bassano, beautifully and daringly gowned, and the heavy-looking
  ex-pugilist, Lew Brady.</p>

  <p>Presently, with a sigh, Johnson's eyes roved toward the old man and
  remained fixed on him, fascinated.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it a miracle?" he asked in a hushed voice. "He changes his habits
  in a day! Bought the house in Berkeley Square, called in an army of tailors,
  sent me rushing round to fix theatre seats, bought jewellery..."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it," he confessed, "because it has made no difference
  to him in the office. He's the same old hog. He wanted me to become his
  resident secretary, but I struck at that. I must have some sort of life worth
  living. What scares me is that he may fire me if I don't agree. He's been
  very unpleasant this week. I wonder if Ray has seen him?"</p>

  <p>Ray Bennett had not seen his late employer. He was too completely
  engrossed in the joy of being with Lola, too inspired and stimulated from
  more material sources, to take an interest in anything but himself and the
  immediate object of his affections.</p>

  <p>"You are making a fool of yourself, Ray. Everybody is looking at you,"
  warned Lola.</p>

  <p>He glanced round, and for the first time began to notice who was in the
  room. Presently his eyes fell upon the shining pate of Mr. Maitland, and his
  jaw dropped. He could not believe the evidence of his vision, and, rising,
  walked unsteadily across the floor, shouldering the other guests, stumbling
  against chairs and tables, until he stood by the table of his late
  employer.</p>

  <p>"Gosh!" he gasped. "It <i>is</i> you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The old man raised his eyes slowly from the cloth which he had been
  contemplating steadily for ten minutes, and his steely eyes met the gaze
  steadily.</p>

  <p>"You hoary old sinner!" breathed Ray.</p>

  <p>"Go away," snarled Mr. Maitland.</p>

  <p>"'Go away,' is it? I'm going to talk to you and give you a few words of
  advice and warning, Moses!"</p>

  <p>Ray sat down suddenly in a chair, and faced his glaring victim with
  drunken solemnity. His words of warning remained unuttered. Somebody gripped
  his arm and jerked him to his feet, and he looked into the dark face of Lew
  Brady.</p>

  <p>"Here, what&mdash;" he began. But Brady led him and pushed him back to his
  own table.</p>

  <p>"You fool!" he hissed. "Why do you want to advertise yourself in this way?
  You're a hell of a Secret Service man!"</p>

  <p>"I don't want any of that stuff from you," said Ray roughly as he jerked
  his arm free.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Ray," said Lola in a low voice. "Half Scotland Yard is in the
  club, watching you."</p>

  <p>He followed the direction of her eyes and saw Dick Gordon regarding him
  gravely, and the sight and knowledge of that surveillance maddened him.
  Leaping to his feet, he crossed the room to where they sat.</p>

  <p>"Looking for me?" he asked loudly. "Want me for anything?"</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You damned police spy!" stormed the youth, white with unreasoning
  passion. "Bringing your bloodhounds after me! What are you doing with this
  gang, Johnson? Are you turned policeman too?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Ray," murmured Johnson.</p>

  <p>"My dear Ray!" sneered the other. "You're jealous, you poor worm&mdash;
  jealous because I've got away from the bloodsucker's clutches! As to you
  "&mdash;-he waved a threatening finger in Dick's face&mdash;"you leave me
  alone&mdash;see? You've got a whole lot of work to do without carrying tales
  to my sister."</p>

  <p>"I think you had better go back to your friends," said Dick coolly. "Or,
  better still, go home and sleep."</p>

  <p>All this had occurred between the dances, and now the band struck up, but
  if the attention of the crowded clubroom was in no wise relaxed, there was
  this change, that Ray's high voice now did not rise above the efforts of the
  trap drummer.</p>

  <p>Dick looked round for the watchful Hagn. He knew that the manager, or one
  of the officials of the club, would interfere instantly. It was not Hagn, but
  a head waiter, who came up and pushed the young man back.</p>

  <p>So intent was everybody on that little scene that followed, in the
  spectacle of that flushed youth struggling against the steady pressure which
  the head waiter and his fellows asserted, that nobody saw the man who for a
  while stood in the doorway surveying the scene, before pushing aside the
  attendants he strode into the centre of the room.</p>

  <p>Ray, looking round, was almost sobered by the sight of his father.</p>

  <p>The rugged, grey-haired man, in his worn, tweed suit, made a striking
  contrast to that gaily-dressed throng. He stood, his hands behind him, his
  face white and set, surveying his son, and the boy's eyes dropped before
  him.</p>

  <p>"I want you, Ray," he said simply.</p>

  <p>The floor was deserted; the music ceased, as though the leader of the
  orchestra had been signalled that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>"Come back with me to Horsham, boy."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going," said Ray sullenly.</p>

  <p>"He is not with you, Mr. Gordon?"</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head, and at this intervention the fury of Ray Bennett
  flamed again.</p>

  <p>"With him!" he said scornfully. "Would I be with a sneaking
  policeman?"</p>

  <p>"Go with your father, Ray." It was Johnson's urgent advice, and his hand
  lay for a second on the boy's shoulder.</p>

  <p>Ray shook him off.</p>

  <p>"I'll stay here," he said, and his voice was loud and defiant. "I'm not a
  baby, that I can't be trusted out alone. You've no right to come here, making
  me look a fool." He glowered at his father. "You've kept me down all these
  years, denied me money that I ought to have had&mdash;and who are you that
  you should pretend to be shocked because I'm in a decent club, wearing decent
  clothes? I'm straight: can you say the same? If I wasn't straight, could you
  blame me? You're not going to put any of that kind father stuff
  over&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come away." John Bennett's voice was hoarse.</p>

  <p>"I'm staying here," said Ray violently. "And in future you can leave me
  alone. The break had to come some time, and it might as well come now."</p>

  <p>They stood facing one another, father and son, and in the tired eyes of
  John Bennett was a look of infinite sadness.</p>

  <p>"You're a silly boy, Ray. Perhaps I haven't done all I could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps!" sneered the other. "Why, you know it! You get out!"</p>

  <p>And then, as he turned his head, he saw the suppressed smiles on the face
  of the audience, and the hurt to his vanity drove him mad.</p>

  <p>"Come," said John gently, and laid his hand on the boy's arm. With a roar
  of fury Ray broke loose...in a second the thing was done. The blow that
  struck John Bennett staggered him, but he did not fall.</p>

  <p>And then, through the guests who thronged about the two, came Ella. She
  realized instantly what had happened. Elk had slipped from his seat and was
  standing behind the boy, ready to pin him if he raised his hand again. But
  Ray Bennett stood, frozen with horror, speechless, incapable of movement.</p>

  <p>"Father!" The white-faced girl whispered the word.</p>

  <p>The head of John Bennett dropped, and he suffered himself to be led
  away.</p>

  <p>Dick Gordon wanted to follow and comfort, but he saw Johnson going after
  them and went back to his table. Again the music started, and they took Ray
  Bennett back to his table, where he sat, head on hand, till Lola signalled a
  waiter to bring more wine.</p>

  <p>"There are times," said Elk, "when the prodigal son and the fatted calf
  look so like one another that you can't tell 'em apart."</p>

  <p>Dick said nothing, but his heart bled for the mystery man of Horsham. For
  he had seen in John Bennett's face the agony of the damned.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">XIII. &mdash; A RAID ON ELDOR STREET</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Johnson did not come back, and in many respects the two men
  were glad. Elk had been on the point of telling the secretary to clear, and
  he hoped that Mr. Maitland would follow his example. As if reading his
  thoughts, the old man rose soon after the room had quietened down. He had sat
  through the scene which had followed Ray's meeting with his father, and had
  apparently displayed not the slightest interest in the proceedings. It was as
  though his mind were so far away that he could not bring himself to a
  realization of actualities.</p>

  <p>"He's going, and he hasn't paid his bill," whispered Elk.</p>

  <p>In spite of his remissness, the aged millionaire was escorted to the door
  by the three chief waiters, his topcoat, silk hat and walking-stick were
  brought to him, and he was out of Dick Gordon's sight before the bowing
  servants had straightened themselves.</p>

  <p>Elk looked at his watch: it wanted five minutes of one. Hagn had not
  returned&mdash;a circumstance which irritated the detective and was a source
  of uneasiness to Dick Gordon. The merriment again worked up to its highest
  point, when the two men rose from the table and strolled toward the door. A
  waiter came after them hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur has not paid his bill."</p>

  <p>"We will pay that later," said Dick, and at that moment the hands of the
  clock pointed to the hour.</p>

  <p>Precisely five minutes later the club was in the hands of the police. By
  1.15 it was empty, save for the thirty raiding detectives and the staff.</p>

  <p>"Where is Hagn?" Dick asked the chief waiter.</p>

  <p>"He has gone home, monsieur," said the man sullenly. "He always goes home
  early."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie," said Elk. "Show me to his room."</p>

  <p>Hagn's office was in the basement, a part of the old mission hall that had
  remained untouched. They were shown to a large, windowless cubicle,
  comfortably furnished, which was Hagn's private bureau, but the man had
  disappeared. Whilst his subordinates were searching for the books and
  examining, sheet by sheet, the documents in the clerk's office, Elk made an
  examination of the room. In one corner was a small safe, upon which he put
  the police seal; and lying on a sofa in some disorder was a suit of clothes,
  evidently discarded in a hurry. Elk looked at them, carried them under the
  ceiling light, and examined them. It was the suit Hagn had been wearing when
  he had shown them to their seats.</p>

  <p>"Bring in that head waiter," said Elk.</p>

  <p>The head waiter either wouldn't or couldn't give information.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hagn always changes his clothes before he goes home," he said.</p>

  <p>"Why did he go before the club was closed?"</p>

  <p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about his private affairs," he said, and Elk
  dismissed him.</p>

  <p>Against the wall was a dressing-table and a mirror, and on each side of
  the mirror stood a small table-lamp, which differed from other table-lamps in
  that it was not shaded. Elk turned the switch, and in the glaring light
  scrutinized the table. Presently he found two wisps of hair, and held them
  against the sleeve of his black coat. In the drawer he found a small bottle
  of spirit gum, and examined the brush. Then he picked up a little wastepaper
  basket and turned its contents upon the table. He found a few torn bills,
  business letters, a tradesman's advertisement, three charred cigarette ends,
  and some odd scraps of paper. One of these was covered with gum and stuck
  together.</p>

  <p>"I reckon he wiped the brush on this," said Elk, and with some difficulty
  pulled the folded slip apart.</p>

  <p>It was typewritten, and consisted of three lines:</p>

  <p>"Urgent. See Seven at E.S.2. No raid. Get M.'s statement. Urgent.
  F.1."</p>

  <p>Dick took the paper from his subordinate's hand and read it.</p>

  <p>"He's wrong about the no raid," he said. "E. S., of course, is Eldor
  Street, and two is either the number two or two o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Who's 'M.'?" asked Elk, frowning.</p>

  <p>"Obviously Mills&mdash;the man we caught at Wandsworth. He made a written
  statement, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"He has signed one," said Elk thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>He turned the papers over, and after a while found what he was looking
  for&mdash;a small envelope. It was addressed in typewritten characters to "G.
  V. Hagn," and bore on the back the stamp of the District Messenger
  service.</p>

  <p>The staff were still held by the police, and Elk sent for the
  doorkeeper.</p>

  <p>"What time was this delivered?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man was an ex-soldier, the only one of the prisoners who seemed to
  feel his position.</p>

  <p>"It came at about nine o'clock, sir," he said readily, and produced the
  letter-book in confirmation. "It was brought by a District Messenger boy," he
  explained unnecessarily.</p>

  <p>"Does Mr. Hagn get many notes by District Messenger?"</p>

  <p>"Very few, sir," said the doorkeeper, and added an anxious inquiry as to
  his own fate.</p>

  <p>"You can go," said Elk. "Under escort," he added, "to your own home.
  You're not to communicate with anybody, or tell any of the servants here that
  I have made inquiries about this letter. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>To make assurance doubly sure, Elk had called up exchange and placed a ban
  upon all 'phone communications. It was now a quarter to two, and, leaving
  half-a-dozen detectives in charge of the club, he got the remainder on to the
  car that had brought them, and, accompanied by Dick, went full speed for
  Tottenham.</p>

  <p>Within a hundred yards of Eldor Street the car stopped and unloaded. The
  first essential was that whoever was meeting No. 7 in Eldor Street should not
  be warned of their approach. It was more than possible that Frog scouts would
  be watching at each end of the street.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why they should," said Elk, when Dick put this possibility
  forward.</p>

  <p>"I can give you one very excellent reason," said Dick quietly. "It is
  this: that the Frogs know all about your previous visit to Maitland's slum
  residence."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that?" asked Elk in surprise, but Dick did not
  enlighten him.</p>

  <p>Sending the men round by circuitous routes, he went forward with Elk, and
  at the very corner of Eldor Street, Elk found that his chief's surmise was
  well founded. Under a lamp-post Elk saw the dim figure of a man standing, and
  instantly began an animated and raucous conversation concerning a mythical
  Mr. Brown. Realizing that this was intended for the watcher, Gordon joined
  in. The man under the lamp-post hesitated just a little too long. As they
  came abreast of him, Elk turned.</p>

  <p>"Have you got a match?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No," growled the other, and the next instant was on the ground, with
  Elk's knee on his chest and the detective's bony hand around his throat.</p>

  <p>"Shout, Frog, and I'll throttle you," hissed the detective
  ferociously.</p>

  <p>There was no scuffle, no sound. The thing was done so quickly that, if
  there were other watchers in the street, they could not have known what had
  happened, or have received any warning from their comrade's fate. The man was
  in the hands of the following detective, gagged and handcuffed, and on his
  way to the police car, before he knew exactly what tornado had struck
  him.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I sing?" said Elk as they turned into the street on the
  opposite side to that where Mr. Maitland's late residence was situated.</p>

  <p>Without waiting permission Elk broke into song. His voice was thin and
  flat. As a singer, he was a miserable failure, and Dick Gordon had never in
  his life listened with so much patience to sounds more hideous. But there
  would be watchers at each end of the street, he thought, and soon saw that
  Elk's precautions were necessary.</p>

  <p>Again it was in the shadow of a street lamp that the sentinel stood&mdash;
  a tall, thickset man, more conscientious in the discharge of his duties than
  his friend, for Dick saw something glittering in his mouth, and knew that it
  was a whistle.</p>

  <p>"Give me the world for a wishing well," wailed Elk, staggering slightly,
  "Say that my dre-em will come true..."</p>

  <p>And as he sang he made appropriate gestures. His outflung hand caught the
  whistle and knocked it from the man's mouth, and in a second the two sprang
  at him and flung him face downward on the pavement. Elk pulled his prisoner's
  cap over his mouth; something black and shiny flashed before the sentry's
  eyes, and a cold, circular instrument was thrust against the back of his
  ear.</p>

  <p>"If you make a sound, you're a dead Frog," said Elk; and that portion of
  his party which had made the circuit coming up at that moment, he handed his
  prisoner over and replaced his fountain-pen in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Everything now depends upon whether the gentleman who is patrolling the
  passage between the gardens has witnessed this disgusting fracas," said Elk,
  dusting himself. "If he was standing at the entrance to the passage he has
  seen it, and there's going to be trouble."</p>

  <p>Apparently the patrol was in the alleyway itself and had heard no sound.
  Creeping to the entrance, Elk listened and presently heard the soft pad of
  footsteps. He signalled to Dick to remain where he was, and slipped into the
  passage, walking softly, but not so softly that the man on guard at the back
  gate of Mr. Maitland's house did not hear him.</p>

  <p>"Who's that?" he demanded in a gruff voice.</p>

  <p>"It's me," whispered Elk. "Don't make so much noise."</p>

  <p>"You're not supposed to be here," said the other in a tone of authority.
  "I told you to stay under the lamp-post&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elk's eyes had grown accustomed to the darkness, and now he saw his
  man.</p>

  <p>"There are two queer-looking people in the street: I wanted you to see
  them," he whispered.</p>

  <p>All turned now upon the discipline which the Frogs maintained.</p>

  <p>"Who are they?" asked the unknown in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"A man and a woman," whispered Elk.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose they're anybody important," grumbled the other.</p>

  <p>In his youth Elk had played football; and, measuring the distance as best
  he could, he dropped suddenly and tackled low. The man struck the earth with
  a jerk which knocked all the breath out of his body and made him incapable of
  any other sound than the involuntary gasp which followed his knock-out. In a
  second Elk was on him, his bony knee on the man's throat.</p>

  <p>"Pray, Frog," he whispered in the man's ear, "but don't shout!"</p>

  <p>The stricken man was incapable of shouting, and was still breathless when
  willing hands threw him into the patrol wagon.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to go the back way, boys," said Elk in a whisper.</p>

  <p>This time his task was facilitated by the fact that the garden gate was
  not locked. The door into the scullery was, however, but there was a window,
  the catch of which Elk forced noiselessly. He had pulled off his boots and
  was in his stockinged feet, and he sidled along the darkened passage.
  Apparently none of the dilapidated furniture had been removed from the house,
  for he felt the small table that had stood in the hall on his last visit.
  Gently turning the handle of Maitland's room, he pushed.</p>

  <p>The door was open, the room in darkness and empty. Elk came back to the
  scullery.</p>

  <p>"There's nobody here on the ground floor," he said. "We'll try
  upstairs."</p>

  <p>He was half-way up when he heard the murmur of voices and stopped. Raising
  his eyes to the level of the floor, he saw a crack of light under the doorway
  of the front room&mdash;the apartment which had been occupied by Maitland's
  housekeeper. He listened, but could distinguish no consecutive words. Then,
  with a bound, he took the remaining stairs in three strides, flew along the
  landing, and flung himself upon the door. It was locked. At the sound of his
  footsteps the light inside went out. Twice he threw himself with all his
  weight at the frail door, and at the third attempt it crashed in.</p>

  <p>"Hands up, everybody!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>The room was in darkness, and there was a complete silence. Crouching down
  in the doorway, he flung the gleam of his electric torch into the room. It
  was empty!</p>

  <p>His officers came crowding in at his heels, the lamp on the table was
  relit&mdash;the glass chimney was hot&mdash;and a search was made of the
  room. It was too small to require a great deal of investigation. There was a
  bed, under which it was possible to hide, but they drew blank in this
  respect. At one end of the room near the bed was a wardrobe, which was filled
  with old dresses suspended from hangers.</p>

  <p>"Throw out those clothes," ordered Elk. "There must be a door there into
  the next house."</p>

  <p>A glance at the window showed him that it was impossible for the inmates
  of the room to have escaped that way. Presently the clothes were heaped on
  the floor, and the detectives were attacking the wooden back of the wardrobe,
  which did, in fact, prove to be a door leading into the next house. Whilst
  they were so engaged, Dick made a scrutiny of the table, which was littered
  with papers. He saw something and called Elk.</p>

  <p>"What is this, Elk?"</p>

  <p>The detective took the four closely-typed sheets of paper from his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Mills' confession," he said in amazement. "There are only two copies, one
  of which I have, and the other is in the possession of your department,
  Captain Gordon."</p>

  <p>At this moment the wardrobe backing was smashed in, and the detectives
  were pouring through to the next house.</p>

  <p>And then it was that they made the interesting discovery that, to all
  intents and purposes, communication was continuous between a block of ten
  houses that ran to the end of the street. And they were not untenanted. Three
  typical Frogs occupied the first room into which they burst. They found
  others on the lower floor; and it soon became clear that the whole of the
  houses comprising the end block had been turned into a sleeping place for the
  recruits of Frogdom. Since any one of these might have been No. 7, they were
  placed under arrest.</p>

  <p>All the communicating doors were now opened. Except in the case of
  Maitland's house, no attempt had been made to camouflage the entrances, which
  in the other houses consisted of oblong apertures, roughly cut through the
  brick party walls.</p>

  <p>"We may have got him, but I doubt it," said Elk, coming back, breathless
  and grimy, to where Dick was examining the remainder of the documents which
  he had found. "I haven't seen any man who looks like owning brains."</p>

  <p>"Nobody has escaped from the block?"</p>

  <p>Elk shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My men are in the passage and the street. In addition, the uniformed
  police are here. Didn't you hear the whistle?" Elk's assistant reported at
  that moment.</p>

  <p>"A man has been found in one of the back yards, sir," he said. "I've taken
  the liberty of relieving the constable of his prisoner. Would you like to see
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Bring him up," said Elk, and a few minutes later a handcuffed man was
  pushed into the room.</p>

  <p>He was above medium height; his hair was fair and long, his yellow beard
  was trimmed to a point.</p>

  <p>For a moment Dick looked at him wonderingly, and then:</p>

  <p>"Carlo, I think?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Hagn, I'm sure!" said Elk. "Get those whiskers off, you Frog, and we'll
  talk numbers, beginning with seven!"</p>

  <p>Hagn! Even now Dick could not believe his eyes. The wig was so perfectly
  made, the beard so cunningly fixed, that he could not believe it was the
  manager of Heron's Club. But when he heard the voice, he knew that Elk was
  right.</p>

  <p>"Number Seven, eh?" drawled Hagn. "I guess Number Seven will get through
  your cordon without being challenged, Mr. Elk. He's friendly with the police.
  What do you want me for?"</p>

  <p>"I want you for the part you played in the murder of Chief Inspector
  Genter on the night of the fourteenth of May," said Elk.</p>

  <p>Hagn's lips curled.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you take Broad?&mdash;he was there. Perhaps he'll come as
  witness for me."</p>

  <p>"When I see him&mdash;" began Elk.</p>

  <p>"Look out of the window," interrupted Hagn. "He's there!"</p>

  <p>Dick walked to the window and, throwing up the sash, leant out. A crowd of
  locals in shawls and overcoats were watching the transference of the
  prisoners. Dick caught the sheen of a silk hat and the unmistakable voice of
  Broad hailed him.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Captain Gordon&mdash;Frog stock kind of slumped, hasn't it?
  By the way, did you see the baby?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">XIV. &mdash; "ALL BULLS HEAR"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Elk went out on the street to see the American. Mr. Broad
  was in faultless evening dress, and the gleaming head-lamps of his car
  illuminated the mean street.</p>

  <p>"You've certainly a nose for trouble," said Elk with respect; "and whilst
  you're telling me how you came to know about this raid, which hadn't been
  decided on until half-an-hour ago, I'll do some quiet wondering."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know there was a raid," confessed Joshua Broad, "but when I saw
  twenty Central Office men dash out of Heron's Club and drive furiously away,
  I am entitled to guess that their haste doesn't indicate their anxiety to get
  to bed before the clock strikes two. I usually call at Heron's Club in the
  early hours. In many ways its members are less desirable acquaintances than
  the general run of Frogs, but they amuse me. And they are mildly instructive.
  That is my explanation&mdash;I saw you leave in a hurry and I followed you.
  And I repeat my question. Did you see the dear little baby who is learning to
  spell R-A-T, Rat?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Elk shortly. He had a feeling that the suave and self-
  possessed American was laughing at him. "Come in and see the chief."</p>

  <p>Broad followed the inspector to the bedroom, where Dick was assembling the
  papers which in his hurried departure No. 7 had left behind. The capture was
  the most important that had been made since the campaign against the Frogs
  was seriously undertaken.</p>

  <p>In addition to the copy of the secret report on Mills, there was a bundle
  of notes, many of them cryptic and unintelligible to the reader. Some,
  however, were in plain English. They were typewritten, and obviously they
  corresponded to the General Orders of an army. They were, in fact, the Frog's
  own instructions, issued under the name of his chief of staff, for each bore
  the signature "Seven."</p>

  <p>One ran:</p>

  <p>"Raymond Bennett must go faster. L. to tell him that he is a Frog.
  Whatever is done with him must be carried out with somebody unknown as
  Frog."</p>

  <p>Another slip:</p>

  <p>"Gordon has an engagement to dine American Embassy Thursday. Settle. Elk
  has fixed new alarm under fourth tread of stairs. Elk goes to Wandsworth 4.15
  to-morrow for interview with Mills."</p>

  <p>There were other notes dealing with people of whom Dick had never heard.
  He was reading again the reference to himself, and smiling over the laconic
  instruction "settle," when the American came in.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Mr. Broad&mdash;by the sad look on Elk's face I guess you have
  explained your presence satisfactorily?" Broad nodded smilingly.</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Elk takes quite a lot of convincing," he said. His eyes fell upon
  the papers on the table. "Would it be indiscreet to ask if that is Frog
  stuff?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Very," said Dick, "In fact, any reference to the Frogs would be the
  height of indiscretion, unless you're prepared to add to the sum of our
  knowledge."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you, without committing myself, that Frog Seven has made a
  getaway," said the American calmly.</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I heard the Frogs jubilating as they passed down the street in custody,"
  said Broad. "Frog Seven's disguise was perfect&mdash;he wore the uniform of a
  policeman."</p>

  <p>Elk swore softly but savagely.</p>

  <p>"That was it!" he said. "He was the 'policeman' who was spiriting Hagn
  away under the pretence of arresting him! And if one of my men had not taken
  his prisoner from him they would both have escaped. Wait!"</p>

  <p>He went in search of the detective who had brought in Hagn.</p>

  <p>"I don't know the constable," said that officer. "This is a strange
  division to me. He was a tallish man with a heavy black moustache. If it was
  a disguise, it was perfect, sir."</p>

  <p>Elk returned to report and question. But again Mr. Broad's explanation was
  a simple one.</p>

  <p>"I tell you that the Frogs were openly enjoying the joke. I heard one say
  that the 'rozzer' got away&mdash;and another refers to the escaped man as a
  'Hattie'&mdash;both, I believe, are cant terms for policemen?"</p>

  <p>Elk nodded.</p>

  <p>"What is your interest in the Frogs, Broad?" he asked bluntly. "Forget for
  the minute that you're a parlour criminologist and imagine that you're
  writin' the true story of your life."</p>

  <p>Broad considered for a while, examining the cigar he had been smoking.</p>

  <p>"The Frogs mean nothing to me&mdash;the Frog everything." The American
  puffed a ring of smoke into the air and watched it dissolve.</p>

  <p>"I'm mighty curious to know what game he is playing with Ray Bennett," he
  said. "That is certainly the most intriguing feature of Frog strategy."</p>

  <p>He rose and took up his hat.</p>

  <p>"I envy you your search of this fine old mansion," he said, and, with a
  twinkle in his eye: "Don't forget the kindergarten, Mr. Elk."</p>

  <p>When he had gone, Elk made a close scrutiny of the house. He found two
  children's books, both well-thumbed, and an elementary copybook, in which a
  childish hand had followed, shakily, the excellent copperplate examples. The
  <i>abacus</i> was gone, however. In the cupboard where he had seen the
  unopened circulars, he made a discovery. It was a complete outfit, as far as
  he could judge, for a boy of six or seven. Every article was new&mdash;not
  one had been worn. Elk carried his find to where Dick was still puzzling over
  some of the more obscure notes which "No. 7" had left in his flight.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of these?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Prosecutor turned over the articles one by one, then leant back in his
  chair and stared into vacancy.</p>

  <p>"All new," he said absently, and then a slow smile dawned on his face.</p>

  <p>Elk, who saw nothing funny in the little bundle, wondered what was amusing
  him.</p>

  <p>"I think these clothes supply a very valuable clue; does this?" He passed
  a paper across the table, and Elk read:</p>

  <p>"All bulls hear on Wednesday 3.1.A. L.V.M.B. Important."</p>

  <p>"There are twenty-five copies of that simple but moving message," said
  Dick; "and as there are no envelopes for any of the instructions, I can only
  suppose that they are despatched by Hagn either from the club or his home.
  This is how far I have got in figuring the organization of the Frogs. Frog
  Number One works through 'Seven,' who may or may not be aware of his chief's
  identity. Hagn&mdash;whose number is thirteen, by the way, and mighty unlucky
  it will be for him&mdash;is the executive chief of Number Seven's bureau, and
  actually communicates with the section chiefs. He may or may not know
  'Seven'&mdash;probably he does. Seven takes orders from the Frog, but may act
  without consultation if emergencies arise. There is here," he tapped the
  paper, "an apology for employing Mills, which bears this out."</p>

  <p>"No handwriting?"</p>

  <p>"None&mdash;nor finger-prints."</p>

  <p>Elk took up one of the slips on which the messages were written, and held
  it to the light.</p>

  <p>"Watermark Three Lion Bond," he read. "Typewriter new, written by somebody
  who was taught and has a weak little finger of the left hand&mdash;the 'q'
  and 'a' are faint. That shows he's a touch typist&mdash;uses the same finger
  every time. Self-taught typists seldom use their little fingers. Especially
  the little finger of the left hand. I once caught a bank thief through
  knowing this." He read the message again.</p>

  <p>"'All bulls hear on Wednesday...' Bulls are the big men, the bull frogs,
  eh? Where do they hear? 3.1.A.? That certainly leaves me guessing, Captain.
  Why, what do you think?"</p>

  <p>Dick was regarding him oddly.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't get me guessing," he said slowly. "At 3.1 a.m. on Wednesday
  morning, I shall be listening in for the code signal L.V.M.B.&mdash;we are
  going to hear that great Frog talk!"</p>

  <p>"Will he talk about the durned treaty?" growled Elk.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15">XV. &mdash; THE MORNING AFTER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Ray Bennett woke with a groan. His temples were splitting,
  his tongue was parched and dry. When he tried to lift his aching head from
  the pillow he groaned again, but with an effort of will succeeded in dragging
  himself from the bed and staggering to the window. He pushed open a leaded
  casement and looked out upon the green of Hyde Park, and all the time his
  temples throbbed painfully.</p>

  <p>Pouring a glass of water from a carafe, he drank greedily, and, sitting
  down on the edge of the bed, his head between his hands, he tried to think.
  Only dimly did he recall the events of the night before, but he was conscious
  that something dreadful had happened. Slowly his mind started to sort out his
  experiences, and with a sinking heart he remembered he had struck his father!
  He shuddered at the recollection, and then began a frantic mental search for
  justification. The vanity of youth does not readily reject excuses for its
  own excesses, and Ray was no exception. By the time he had had his bath and
  was in the first stages of dressing, he had come to the conclusion that he
  had been very badly treated. It was unpardonable in him to strike his
  father&mdash;he must write to him expressing his sorrow and urging his
  condition as a reason for the act. It would not be a crawling letter (he told
  himself) but something dignified and a little distant. After all, these
  quarrels occurred in every family. Parents were temporarily estranged from
  their children, and were eventually reconciled. Some day he would go to his
  father a rich man...</p>

  <p>He pursed his lips uneasily. A rich man? He was well off now. He had an
  expensive flat. Every week crisp new banknotes came by registered post. He
  had the loan of a car&mdash;how long would this state of affairs
  continue?</p>

  <p>He was no fool. Not perhaps as clever as he thought he was, but no fool.
  Why should the Japanese or any other Government pay him for information they
  could get from any handbook available to all and purchasable for a few
  shillings at most booksellers?</p>

  <p>He dismissed the thought&mdash;he had the gift of putting out of his mind
  those matters which troubled him. Opening the door which led into his
  dining-room, he stood stock-still, paralysed with astonishment.</p>

  <p>Ella was sitting at the open window, her elbow on the ledge, her chin in
  her hand. She looked pale, and there were heavy shadows under her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why, Ella, what on earth are you doing here?" he asked. "How did you get
  in?"</p>

  <p>"The porter opened the door with his pass-key when I told him I was your
  sister," she said listlessly. "I came early this morning. Oh, Ray&mdash;
  aren't you...aren't you ashamed?"</p>

  <p>He scowled.</p>

  <p>"Why should I be?" he asked loudly. "Father ought to have known better
  than tackle me when I was lit up! Of course, it was an awful thing to do, but
  I wasn't responsible for my actions at the time. What did he say?" he asked
  uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;he said nothing. I wish he had. Won't you go to Horsham and
  see him, Ray?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;let it blow over for a day or two," he said hastily. He most
  assuredly had no anxiety to meet his father. "If...if he forgives me he'll
  only want me to come back and chuck this life. He had no right to make me
  look little before all those people. I suppose you've been to see your friend
  Gordon?" he sneered.</p>

  <p>"No," she said simply, "I have been nowhere but here. I came up by the
  workmen's train. Would it be a dreadful sacrifice, Ray, to give up this?"</p>

  <p>Be made an impatient gesture.</p>

  <p>"It isn't&mdash;this, my dear Ella, if by 'this' you mean the flat. It is
  my work that you and father want me to give up. I have to live up to my
  position."</p>

  <p>"What is your work?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't understand," he said loftily, and her lips twitched.</p>

  <p>"It would have to be very extraordinary if I could not understand it," she
  said. "Is it Secret Service work?"</p>

  <p>Ray went red.</p>

  <p>"I suppose Gordon has been talking to you," he complained bitterly. "If
  that fellow sticks his nose into my affairs he is going to have it
  pulled!"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't he?" she asked.</p>

  <p>This was a new tone in her, and one that made him stare at her. Ella had
  always been the indulgent, approving, excusing sister. The buffer who stood
  between him and his father's reproof.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't he?" she repeated. "Mr. Gordon should know something of
  Secret Service work&mdash;he himself is an officer of the law. You are either
  working lawfully, in which case it doesn't matter what he knows, or
  unlawfully, and the fact that he knows should make a difference to you."</p>

  <p>He looked at her searchingly.</p>

  <p>"Why are you so interested in Gordon&mdash;are you in love with him?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Her steady eyes did not waver, and only the faintest tinge of pink came to
  the skin that sleeplessness had paled.</p>

  <p>"That is the kind of question that a gentleman does not ask in such a
  tone," she said quietly, "not even of his sister. Ray, you are coming back to
  daddy, aren't you&mdash;to-day?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No. I'm not. I'm going to write to him. I admit I did wrong. I shall tell
  him so in my letter. I can't do more than that."</p>

  <p>There came a discreet knock on the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in," growled Ray. It was his servant, a man who came by the day.</p>

  <p>"Will you see Miss Bassano and Mr. Brady, sir?" he asked in a hoarse
  whisper, and glanced significantly at Ella.</p>

  <p>"Of course he'll see me," said a voice outside. "Why all this
  formality&mdash;oh, I see."</p>

  <p>Lola Bassano's eyes fell upon the girl seated by the window.</p>

  <p>"This is my sister&mdash;Ella, this is Miss Bassano and Mr. Brady."</p>

  <p>Ella looked at the petite figure in the doorway, and, looking, could only
  admire. It was the first time they had met face to face, and she thought Lola
  was lovely.</p>

  <p>"Glad to meet you, Miss Bennett. I suppose you've come up to roast this
  brother of yours for his disgraceful conduct last night. Boy, you were
  certainly mad! It <i>was</i> your father, Miss Bennett?"</p>

  <p>Ella nodded and heard with gratitude the sympathetic click of Lew Brady's
  lips.</p>

  <p>"If I'd been near you, Ray, I'd have beaten you. Too bad, Miss
  Bennett."</p>

  <p>A strange coldness came suddenly to the girl&mdash;and a second before she
  had glowed to their sympathy. It was the suspicion of their insincerity that
  chilled her. Their kindness was just a little too glib and too ready. Brady's
  just a little too overpowering.</p>

  <p>"Do you like your brother's flat?" asked Lola, sitting down and stretching
  her silk-covered legs to a patch of sunlight.</p>

  <p>"It is very&mdash;handsome," said Ella. "He will find Horsham rather dull
  when he comes back."</p>

  <p>"Will he go back?" Lola flashed a smile at the youth as she asked the
  question.</p>

  <p>"Not much I won't," said Ray energetically. "I've been trying to make Ella
  understand that my business is too important to leave."</p>

  <p>Lola nodded, and now the antagonism which Ella in her charity was holding
  back came with a rush.</p>

  <p>"What is the business?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He went on to give her a vague and cautious exposition of his work, and
  she listened without comment.</p>

  <p>"So if you think that I'm doing anything crooked, or have friends that
  aren't as straight as you and father are, get the idea out of your head. I'm
  not afraid of Gordon or Elk or any of that lot. Don't think I am. Nor is
  Brady, nor Miss Bassano. Gordon is one of those cheap detectives who has got
  his ideas out of books."</p>

  <p>"That's perfectly true, Miss Bennett," said Lew virtuously. "Gordon is
  just a bit too clever. He's got the idea that everybody but himself is crook.
  Why, he sent Elk down to cross-examine your own father! Believe me, I'm not
  scared of Gordon, or any&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>Tap...tap...tappity...tap.</i></p>

  <p>The taps were on the door, slow, deliberate, unmistakable. The effect on
  Lew Brady was remarkable. His big body seemed to shrink, his puffed face grew
  suddenly hollow.</p>

  <p><i>Tap...tap...tappity...tap.</i></p>

  <p>The hand that went up to Brady's mouth was trembling. Ella looked from the
  man to Lola, and she saw, to her amazement, that Lola had grown pale under
  her rouge. Brady stumbled to the door, and the sound of his heavy breathing
  sounded loud in the silence.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he muttered, and flung the door wide open. It was Dick Gordon
  who entered.</p>

  <p>He looked from one to the other, laughter in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"The old Frog tap seems to frighten some of you," he said pleasantly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap16"
     id="chap16">XVI. &mdash; RAY LEARNS THE TRUTH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Lola was the quickest to recover.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean...Frog tap? Got that Frog stuff roaming loose in your
  head, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"It is a new accomplishment," said Dick with mock gravity. "A thirty-
  third degree Frog taught me. It's the signal the old Grand Master Frog gives
  when he enters the presence of his inferiors."</p>

  <p>"Your thirty-third degree Frog is probably lying," said Lola, her colour
  returning. "Anyway, Mills&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I never mentioned Mills," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"I know it was he. His arrest was in the newspapers."</p>

  <p>"It hasn't even appeared in the newspapers," said Dick, "unless it was
  splashed in <i>The Frog Gazette</i>&mdash;probably on the personality
  page."</p>

  <p>He inclined his head toward the girl. Ray, for the moment, he would have
  ignored if the young man had not taken a step towards him.</p>

  <p>"Do you want anything, Gordon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I want a private talk with you, Bennett," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing you can't say before my friends," said Ray, his ready
  temper rising.</p>

  <p>"The only person I recognize by that title is your sister," replied
  Gordon.</p>

  <p>"Let's go, Lew," said Lola with a shrug, but Ray Bennett stopped them.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute! Is this my house, or isn't it?" he demanded furiously.
  "You can clear out, Gordon! I've had just about as much of your interference
  as I want. You push your way in here, you're offensive to my
  friends&mdash;you practically tell them to get out&mdash;I like your nerve!
  There's the door&mdash;you can go."</p>

  <p>"I'll go if you feel that way," said Dick, "but I want to warn
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pshaw! I'm sick of your warnings."</p>

  <p>"I want to warn you that the Frog has decided that you've got to earn your
  money! That is all."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence, which Ella broke.</p>

  <p>"The Frog?" she repeated, open-eyed. "But...but, Mr. Gordon, Ray
  isn't...with the Frogs?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it will be news to him&mdash;but he is," said Dick. "These two
  people are faithful servants of the reptile," he pointed. "Lola is financed
  by him&mdash;her husband is financed by him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're a liar!" screamed Ray. "Lola isn't married! You're a sneaking
  liar&mdash;get out before I throw you out! You poor Frog-chaser&mdash;you
  think everything that's green lives in a pond! Get out and stay out!"</p>

  <p>It was Ella's appealing glance that made Dick Gordon walk to the door.
  Turning, his cold gaze rested on Lew Brady.</p>

  <p>"There is a big question-mark against your name in the Frog-book, Brady.
  You watch out!"</p>

  <p>Lew shrank under the blow, for blow it was, Had he dared, he would have
  followed Gordon into the corridor and sought further information. But here
  his moral courage failed him, and he stood, a pathetic figure, looking
  wistfully at the door that the visitor had closed behind him.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake let us get some air in the room!" snarled Ray, thrusting
  open the windows. "That fellow is a pestilence! Married! Trying to get me to
  believe that!"</p>

  <p>Ella had taken up her handbag from the sideboard where she had placed
  it.</p>

  <p>"Going, Ella?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Tell father...I'll write anyway. Talk to him, Ella, and show him where he
  was wrong."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Ray," she said. "Perhaps one day you will come back to us.
  Please God this madness will end soon. Oh, Ray, it isn't true about the
  Frogs, is it? You aren't with those people?"</p>

  <p>His laugh reassured her for the moment.</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm not&mdash;it's about as true as the yarn that Lola is
  married! Gordon was trying to make a sensation; that's the worst of these
  third-rate detectives, they live on sensation."</p>

  <p>She nodded to Lola as he escorted her to the lift. Lew Brady watched her
  with hungry eyes.</p>

  <p>"What did he mean, Lola?" asked Brady as the door closed behind the two.
  "That fellow knows something! There's a mark against my name in the Frog
  book! That sounds bad to me. Lola, I'm finished with these Frogs! They're
  getting on my nerves."</p>

  <p>"You're a fool," she said calmly. "Gordon has got just the effect he
  wanted&mdash;he has scared you!"</p>

  <p>"Scared?" he answered savagely. "Nothing scares me. You're not scared
  because you've no imagination. I'm...not scared, but worried, because I'm
  beginning to see that the Frogs are bigger than I dreamt. They killed that
  Scotsman Maclean the other day, and they're not going to think twice about
  settling with me. I've talked to these Frogs, Lola&mdash;they'd do anything
  from murder upwards. They look on the Frog as a god&mdash;he's a religion
  with them! A question mark against my name! I believe it too&mdash;I've
  talked flip about 'em, and they won't forgive that."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" she warned him in a low voice as the door handle turned and Ray
  came back.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" he said. "Thank God she's gone! What a morning!
  Frogs&mdash;Frogs&mdash;Frogs! The poor fool!"</p>

  <p>Lola opened a small jewelled case and took out a cigarette and lit it,
  extinguishing the match with a snick of her fingers. Then she turned her
  beautiful eyes upon Ray.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with the Frogs anyway?" she asked coolly. "They pay
  well and they ask for little."</p>

  <p>Ray gaped at her.</p>

  <p>"You're not working for them, are you?" he asked astonished. "Why, they're
  just low tramps who murder people!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not all of them," she corrected. "They are only the body&mdash;the big
  Frogs are different. I am one and Lew is one."</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you talking about?" demanded Lew, half in fear, half
  in wrath.</p>

  <p>"He ought to know&mdash;and he has got to know sooner or later," said
  Lola, unperturbed. "He's too sensible a boy to imagine that the Japanese or
  any other embassy is paying his overhead charges. He's a Frog."</p>

  <p>Ray collapsed into a chair, incapable of speech.</p>

  <p>"A Frog?" he repeated mechanically. "What...what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Lola laughed.</p>

  <p>"I don't see that it is any worse being a Frog than an agent of another
  country, selling your own country's secrets," she said. "Don't be silly, Ray!
  You ought to be pleased and honoured. They chose you from thousands because
  they wanted the right kind of intelligence..."</p>

  <p>And so she flattered and soothed him, until his plastic mind, wax in her
  hands, took another shape.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is all right," he said at last. "Of course, I wouldn't do
  anything really bad, and I don't approve of all this clubbing, but, as you
  say, the Frog can't be responsible for all that his people do. But on one
  thing I'm firm, Lola! I'll have no tattooing!"</p>

  <p>She laughed and extended her white arm.</p>

  <p>"Am I marked?" she asked. "Is Lew marked? No; the big people aren't marked
  at all. Boy, you've a great future."</p>

  <p>Ray took her hand and fondled it.</p>

  <p>"Lola...about that story that Gordon told...your being married: it isn't
  true?"</p>

  <p>She laughed again and patted the hand on hers.</p>

  <p>"Gordon is jealous," she said. "I can't tell you why&mdash;now. But he has
  good reasons." Suddenly her mood grew gay, and she slipped away. "Listen, I'm
  going to 'phone for a table for lunch, and you will join us, and we'll drink
  to the great little Frog who feeds us!"</p>

  <p>"The telephone was on the sideboard, and as she lifted the receiver she
  saw the square black metal box clamped to its base.</p>

  <p>"Something new in 'phones, Ray?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"They fixed it yesterday. It's a resistance. The man told me that somebody
  who was talking into a 'phone during a thunderstorm had a bad shock, so
  they're fitting these things as an experiment. It makes the instrument
  heavier, and it's ugly, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Slowly she put the receiver down and stooped to look at the
  attachment.</p>

  <p>"It's a dictaphone," she said quietly. "And all the time we've been
  talking somebody has been making a note of our conversation."</p>

  <p>She walked to the fire-place, took up a poker and brought it down with a
  crash on the little box...</p>

  <p>Inspector Elk, with a pair of receivers clamped to his head, sat in a tiny
  office on the Thames Embankment, and put down his pencil with a sigh. Then he
  took up his telephone and called Headquarters Exchange.</p>

  <p>"You can switch off that detectaphone to Knightsbridge 93718," he said. "I
  don't think we shall want it any more.</p>

  <p>"Did I put you through in time, sir?" asked the operator's voice. "They
  had only just started talking when I called you."</p>

  <p>"Plenty of time, Angus," said Elk, "plenty of time." He gathered up his
  notes and went to his desk and placed them tidily by the side of his
  blotting-pad.</p>

  <p>Strolling to the window, he looked out upon the sunlit river, and there
  was peace and comfort in his heart, for overnight the prisoner Mills had
  decided to tell all he knew about the Frogs on the promise of a free pardon
  and a passage to Canada. And Mills knew more than he had, as yet, told.</p>

  <p>"I can give you a line to Number 7 that will put him into your hands," his
  note had run.</p>

  <p>Number Seven! Elk caught a long breath. No. 7 was the hub on which the
  wheel turned.</p>

  <p>He rubbed his hands cheerfully, for it seemed that the mystery of the Frog
  was at last to be solved. Perhaps "the line" would lead to the missing
  treaty&mdash;and at the thought of the lost document Elk's face clouded. Two
  ministers, a great state department and innumerable under-secretaries spent
  their time in writing frantic notes of inquiry to headquarters concerning
  Lord Farmley's loss.</p>

  <p>"They want miracles," said Elk, and wondered if the day would produce
  one.</p>

  <p>He went to his overcoat pocket to find a cigar, and his hand touched a
  thick roll of papers. He pulled them out and threw them upon the desk, and as
  he did so the first words on the first sheet caught his eye.</p>

  <p>"<i>By the King's Most Excellent Majesty in Council&mdash;</i>"</p>

  <p>Elk tried to yell, but his voice failed him, and then he snatched up the
  paper from the desk and turned the leaves with trembling hands.</p>

  <p>It was the lost treaty!</p>

  <p>Elk held the precious document in his hand, and his mind went back quickly
  over the night's adventures. When had he taken off his top-coat? When had he
  last put his hand in his pocket? He had taken off the coat at Heron's Club,
  and he could not remember having used the pockets since. It was a light coat
  that he either carried or wore, summer or winter. He had brought it to the
  office that morning on his arm.</p>

  <p>At the club! Probably when he had parted with the garment to the
  cloak-room attendant. Then the Frog must have been there. One of the waiters
  probably&mdash;an admirable disguise for the chief of the gang. Elk sat down
  to think.</p>

  <p>To question anybody in the building would be futile. Nobody had touched
  the coat but himself.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Elk, as he hung up the coat again. At the touch of his
  bell Balder came.</p>

  <p>"Balder, do you remember seeing me pass your room?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"I had my coat on my arm, didn't I?"</p>

  <p>"I never looked," said Balder with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>He invariably gave Elk the impression that he derived a great deal of
  satisfaction out of not being able to help.</p>

  <p>"It's queer," said Elk.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No, not exactly. You understand what has to be done with Mills? He is to
  see nobody. Immediately he arrives he is to be put into the
  waiting-room&mdash;alone. There is to be no conversation of any kind, and, if
  he speaks, he is not to be answered."</p>

  <p>In the privacy of his office he inspected his find again.</p>

  <p>Everything was there&mdash;the treaty and Lord Farmley's notes. Elk called
  up his lordship and told the good news. Later came a small deputation from
  the Foreign Office to collect the precious document, and to offer, in the
  name of the Ministry, their thanks for his services in recovering the lost
  papers. All of which Elk accepted graciously. He would have been cursed with
  as great heartiness if he had failed, and would have been equally innocent of
  responsibility.</p>

  <p>He had arranged for Mills to be brought to Headquarters at noon. There
  remained an hour to be filled, and he spent that hour unprofitably in a rough
  interrogation of Hagn, who, stripped of his beard, occupied a special cell
  segregated from the ordinary places of confinement in Cannon Row
  Station&mdash;which is virtually Scotland Yard itself.</p>

  <p>Hagn refused to make any statement&mdash;even when formally charged with
  the murder of Inspector Genter. He did, however, make a comment on the charge
  when Elk saw him this morning.</p>

  <p>"You have no proof, Elk," he said, "and you know that I am innocent."</p>

  <p>"You were the last man seen in Genter's company," said Elk sternly. "It is
  established that you brought his body back to town. In addition to which,
  Mills has spilt everything."</p>

  <p>"I'm aware what Mills has said," remarked the other.</p>

  <p>"You're not so aware either," suggested Elk. "And now I'll tell you
  something: we've had Number Seven under lock and key since morning&mdash;now
  laugh&mdash;"</p>

  <p>To his amazement the man's face relaxed in a broad grin.</p>

  <p>"Bluff!" he said. "And cheap bluff. It might deceive a poor little thief,
  but it doesn't get past with me. If you'd caught 'Seven,' you wouldn't be
  talking fresh to me. Go and find him, Elk" he mocked, "and when you ye got
  him, hold him tight. Don't let him get away&mdash;as Mills will."</p>

  <p>Elk returned from the interview feeling that it had not gone as well as it
  might&mdash;but as he was leaving the station he beckoned the chief
  inspector.</p>

  <p>"I'm planting a pigeon on Hagn this afternoon. Put 'um together and leave
  'um alone," he said.</p>

  <p>The inspector nodded understandingly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap17"
     id="chap17">XVII. &mdash; THE COMING OF MILLS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">On the morning that Elk waited for the arrival of the
  informer, elaborate precautions were being made to transfer the man to
  headquarters. All night the prison had been surrounded by a cordon of armed
  guards, whilst patrols had remained on duty in the yard where he was
  confined.</p>

  <p>The captured Frog was a well-educated man who had fallen on evil times and
  had been recruited when "on the road" through the agency of two tramping
  members of the fraternity. From the first statement he made, it appeared that
  he had acted as section leader, his duty being to pass on instructions and
  "calls" to the rank and file, to report casualties and to assist in the
  attacks which were made from time to time upon those people who had earned
  the Frog's enmity. Apparently only section leaders and trustees were given
  this type of work.</p>

  <p>They brought him from his cell at eleven o'clock, and the man, despite his
  assurance, was nervous and apprehensive. Moreover, he had a cold and was
  coughing. This may have been a symptom of nerves also.</p>

  <p>At eleven-fifteen the gates of the prison were opened, and three
  motor-cyclists came out abreast. A closed car followed, the curtains drawn.
  On either side of the car rode other armed men on motor-cycles, and a second
  car, containing Central Office men, followed.</p>

  <p>The cortege reached Scotland Yard without mishap; the gates at both ends
  were closed, and the prisoner was rushed into the building.</p>

  <p>Balder, Elk's clerk, and a detective sergeant, took charge of the man, who
  was now white and shaking, and he was put into a small room adjoining Elk's
  office, a room the windows of which were heavily barred (it had been used for
  the safe holding of spies during the war). Two men were put on duty outside
  the door, and the discontented Balder reported.</p>

  <p>"We've put that fellow in the waiting-room, Mr. Elk."</p>

  <p>"Did he say anything?" asked Dick, who had arrived for the
  interrogation.</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;except to ask if the window could be shut. I shut it."</p>

  <p>"Bring the prisoner," said Elk.</p>

  <p>They waited a while, heard the clash of keys, and then an excited buzz of
  talk. Then Balder rushed in.</p>

  <p>"He's ill...fainted or something," he gasped, and Elk sprang past him,
  along the corridor into the guard-room.</p>

  <p>Mills half sat, half lay, against the wall. His eyes were closed, his face
  was ashen.</p>

  <p>Dick bent over the prisoner and laid him flat on the ground. Then he
  stooped and smelt.</p>

  <p>"Cyanide of potassium," he said. "The man is dead."</p>

  <p>That morning Mills had been stripped to the skin and every article of
  clothing searched thoroughly and well. As an additional precaution his
  pockets had been sewn up. To the two detectives who accompanied him in the
  car he had spoken hopefully of his forthcoming departure to Canada. None but
  police officers had touched him, and he had had no communication with any
  outsider.</p>

  <p>The first thing that Dick Gordon noticed was the window, which Balder said
  he had shut. It was open some six inches at the bottom.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I'm sure I shut it," said the clerk emphatically. "Sergeant
  Jeller saw me."</p>

  <p>The sergeant was also under that impression. Dick lifted the window higher
  and looked out. Four horizontal bars traversed the brickwork, but, by craning
  his head, he saw that, a foot away from the window and attached to the wall
  was a long steel ladder running from the roof (as he guessed) to the ground.
  The room was on the third floor, and beneath was a patch of shrub-filled
  gardens. Beyond that, high railings.</p>

  <p>"What are those gardens?" he asked, pointing to the space on the other
  side of the railings.</p>

  <p>"They belong to Onslow Gardens," said Elk.</p>

  <p>"Onslow Gardens?" said Dick thoughtfully. "Wasn't it from Onslow Gardens
  that the Frogs tried to shoot me?"</p>

  <p>Elk shook his head helplessly.</p>

  <p>"What do you suggest, Captain Gordon?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to suggest," admitted Dick. "It doesn't seem an
  intelligent theory that somebody climbed the ladder and handed poison to
  Mills&mdash;less acceptable, that he would be willing to take the dose. There
  is the fact. Balder swears that the window was shut, and now the window is
  open. You can trust Balder?"</p>

  <p>Elk nodded.</p>

  <p>The divisional surgeon came soon after, and, as Dick had expected,
  pronounced life extinct, and supported the view that cyanide was the
  cause.</p>

  <p>"Cyanide has a peculiar odour," he said. "I don't think there's any doubt
  at all that the man was killed, either by poison administered from outside,
  or by poison taken voluntarily by himself."</p>

  <p>After the body had been removed, Elk accompanied Dick Gordon to his
  Whitehall office.</p>

  <p>"I have never been frightened in my life," said Elk, "but these Frogs are
  now on top of me! Here is a man killed practically under our eyes! He was
  guarded, he was never let out of our sight, except for the few minutes he was
  in that room, and yet the Frog can reach him&mdash;it's frightening, Captain
  Gordon."</p>

  <p>Dick unlocked the door of his office and ushered Elk into the cosy
  interior.</p>

  <p>"I know of no better cure for shaken nerves than a Cabana Cesare," he said
  cheerfully. "And without desiring to indulge in a boastful gesture, I can
  only tell you, Elk, that they don't frighten me, any more than they frighten
  you. Frog is human, and has very human fears. Where is friend Broad?"</p>

  <p>"The American?"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded, and Elk, without a second's hesitation, pulled the telephone
  toward him and gave a number.</p>

  <p>After a little delay, Broad's voice answered him.</p>

  <p>"That you, Mr. Broad? What are you doing now?" asked Elk, in that
  caressing tone he adopted for telephone conversation.</p>

  <p>"Is that Elk? I'm just going out."</p>

  <p>"Thought I saw you in Whitehall about five minutes ago," said Elk.</p>

  <p>"Then you must have seen my double," replied the other, "for I haven't
  been out of my bath ten minutes. Do you want me?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," cooed Elk. "Just wanted to know you were all right."</p>

  <p>"Why, is anything wrong?" came the sharp question.</p>

  <p>"Everything's fine," said Elk untruthfully. "Perhaps you'll call round and
  see me at my office one of these days&mdash;good-bye!"</p>

  <p>He pushed the telephone back, and raising his eyes to the ceiling, made a
  quick calculation.</p>

  <p>"From Whitehall to Cavendish Square takes four minutes in a good car," he
  said. "So his being in the flat means nothing."</p>

  <p>He pulled the telephone toward him again, and this time called
  Headquarters.</p>

  <p>"I want a man to shadow Mr. Joshua Broad, of Caverley House; not to leave
  him until eight o'clock to-night; to report to me."</p>

  <p>When he had finished, he sat back in his chair and lit the long cigar that
  Dick had pressed upon him.</p>

  <p>"To-day is Tuesday," he ruminated, "to-morrow's Wednesday. Where do you
  propose to listen in, Captain Gordon?"</p>

  <p>"At the Admiralty," said Dick. "I have arranged with the First Lord to be
  in the instrument room at a quarter to three."</p>

  <p>He bought the early editions of the evening newspapers, and was relieved
  to find that no reference had been made to the murder&mdash;as murder he
  believed it to be. Once, in the course of the day, looking out from his
  window on to Whitehall, he saw Elk walking along on the other side of the
  road" his umbrella hanging on his arm, his ancient derby hat at the back of
  his head, an untidy and unimposing figure. Then, an hour later, he saw him
  again, coming from the opposite direction. He wondered what particular
  business the detective was engaged in. He learnt, quite by accident, that Elk
  had made two visits to the Admiralty that day, but he did not discover the
  reason until they met later in the evening.</p>

  <p>"Don't know much about wireless," said Elk, "though I'm not one of those
  people who believe that, if God had intended us to use wireless, telegraph
  poles would have been born without wires. But it seems to me that I remember
  reading something about 'directional.' If you want to know where a wireless
  message is coming from, you listen in at two or three different
  points&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course! What a fool I am!" said Dick, annoyed with himself. "It never
  occurred to me that we might pick up the broadcasting station."</p>

  <p>"I get these ideas," explained Elk modestly. "The Admiralty have sent
  messages to Milford Haven, Harwich, Portsmouth and Plymouth, telling ships to
  listen in and give us the direction. The evening papers haven't got that
  story."</p>

  <p>"You mean about Mills? No, thank heaven! It is certain to come out at the
  inquest, but I've arranged for that to be postponed for a week or two; and
  somehow I feel that within the next few weeks things will happen."</p>

  <p>"To us," said Elk ominously. "I dare not eat a grilled sausage since that
  fellow was killed! And I'm partial to sausages."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap18"
     id="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; THE BROADCAST</a></h2>

  <p class="first">His jaundiced clerk was, as usual, in a complaining mood.
  "Records have been making a fuss and have been blaming me," he said bitterly.
  "Records give themselves more airs than the whole darned office."</p>

  <p>The war between Balder and "Records"&mdash;which was a short title for
  that section of Headquarters which kept exact data of criminals'
  pasts,&mdash;was of long standing. "Records" was aloof, detached, sublimely
  superior to everything except tabulated facts. It was no respecter of
  persons; would as soon snap at a Chief Commissioner who broke its inflexible
  rules, as it would at the latest joined constable.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>"You remember you had a lot of stuff out the other day about a man
  called&mdash;I can't remember his name now."</p>

  <p>"Lyme?" suggested Elk.</p>

  <p>"That's the fellow. Well, it appears that one of the portraits is missing.
  The morning after you were looking at them, I went to Records and got the
  documents again for you, thinking you wanted to see them in the morning. When
  you didn't turn up, I returned them, and now they say the portrait and
  measurements are short."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say they're lost?"</p>

  <p>"If they're lost," said the morose Balder, "then Records have lost 'em! I
  suppose they think I'm a Frog or somethin'. They're always accusing me of
  mislaying their fingerprint cards."</p>

  <p>"I've promised you a chance to make a big noise, Balder, and now I'm going
  to give it to you. You've been passed over for promotion, son, because the
  men upstairs think you were one of the leaders of the last strike. I know
  that 'passed over' feeling&mdash;it turns you sour. Will you take a big
  chance?"</p>

  <p>Balder nodded, holding his breath.</p>

  <p>"Hagn's in the special cell," said Elk. "Change into your civilian kit,
  roughen yourself up a bit, and I'll put you in with him. If you're scared
  I'll let you carry a gun and fix it so that you won't be searched. Get Hagn
  to talk. Tell him that you were pulled in over the Dundee murder, He won't
  know you. Get that story, Balder, and I'll have the stripes on your arm in a
  week."</p>

  <p>Balder nodded. The querulous character of his voice had changed when he
  spoke again.</p>

  <p>"It's a chance," he said; "and thank you, Mr. Elk, for giving it to
  me."</p>

  <p>An hour later, a detective brought a grimy looking prisoner into Cannon
  Row and pushed him into the steel pen, and the only man who recognized the
  prisoner was the chief inspector who had waited for the arrival of the
  pigeon.</p>

  <p>It was that high official himself who conducted Balder to the separate
  cell and pushed him in.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Frog!" he said.</p>

  <p>Balder's reply was unprintable.</p>

  <p>After seeing his subordinate safely caged, Elk went back to his room,
  locked the door, cut off his telephone and lay down to snatch a few hours'
  sleep. It was a practice of his, when he was engaged in any work which kept
  him up at night, to take these intermediate siestas, and he had trained
  himself to sleep as and when the opportunity presented itself. It was unusual
  in him, however, to avail himself of the office sofa, a piece of furniture to
  which he was not entitled, and which, as his superiors had often pointed out,
  occupied space which might better be employed.</p>

  <p>For once, however, he could not sleep. His mind ranged from Balder to Dick
  Gordon, from Lola Bassano to the dead man Mills. His own position had been
  seriously jeopardized, but that worried him not at all. He was a bachelor,
  had a snug sum invested. His mind went to the puzzling Maitland. His
  association with the Frogs had been proved almost up to the hilt. And
  Maitland was in a position to benefit by these many inexplicable attacks
  which had been made upon seemingly inoffensive people.</p>

  <p>The old man lived a double life. By day the business martinet, before whom
  his staff trembled, the cutter of salaries, the shrewd manipulator of
  properties; by night the associate of thieves and worse than thieves. Who was
  the child? That was another snag.</p>

  <p>"Nothing but snags!" growled Elk, his hands under his head, looking
  resentfully at the ceiling. "Nothing but snags."</p>

  <p>Finding he could not sleep, he got up and went across to Cannon Row. The
  gaoler told him that the new prisoner had been talking a lot to Hagn, and Elk
  grinned. He only hoped that the "new prisoner" would not be tempted to
  discuss his grievances against the police administration.</p>

  <p>At a quarter to three he joined Dick Gordon in the instrument room at the
  Admiralty. An operator had been placed at their disposal; and after the
  preliminary instructions they took their place at the table where he
  manipulated his keys. Dick listened, fascinated, hearing the calls of far-
  off ships and the chatter of transmitting stations. Once he heard a faint
  squeak of sound, so faint that he wasn't sure that he had not been
  mistaken.</p>

  <p>"Cape Race," said the operator. "You'll hear Chicago in a minute. He
  usually gets talkative round about now."</p>

  <p>As the hands of the clock approached three, the operator began varying his
  wave lengths, reaching out into the ether for the message which was coming.
  Exactly at one minute after three he said suddenly:</p>

  <p>"There is your L.V.M.B."</p>

  <p>Dick listened to the staccato sounds, and then:</p>

  <p><i>"All Frogs listen. Mills is dead. Number Seven finished him this
  morning. Number Seven receives a bonus of a hundred pounds."</i></p>

  <p>The voice was clear and singularly sweet. It was a woman's.</p>

  <p><i>"Twenty-third district will arrange to receive Number Seven's
  instructions at the usual place."</i></p>

  <p>Dick's heart was beating thunderously. He recognized the speaker, knew the
  soft cadences, the gentle intonations.</p>

  <p>There could he no doubt at all: it was Ella Bennett's voice! Dick felt a
  sudden sensation of sickness, but, looking across the table and seeing Elk's
  eyes fixed upon him, he made an effort to control his emotions.</p>

  <p>"There doesn't seem to be any more coming through," said the operator
  after a few minutes' wait.</p>

  <p>Dick took off the headpiece and rose.</p>

  <p>"We must wait for the direction signals to come through," he said as
  steadily as he could.</p>

  <p>Presently they began to arrive, and were worked out by a naval officer on
  a large scale map.</p>

  <p>"The broadcasting station is in London," he said. "All the lines meet
  somewhere in the West End, I should imagine; possibly in the very heart of
  town. Did you find any difficulty in picking up the Frog call?" he asked the
  operator.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the man. "I think they were sending from very close at
  hand."</p>

  <p>"In what part of town would you say it would be?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>The officer indicated a pencil mark that he had ruled across the page.</p>

  <p>"It is somewhere on this mark," he said, and Elk, peering over, saw that
  the line passed through Cavendish Square and Cavendish Place and that, whilst
  the Portsmouth line missed Cavendish Place only by a block, the Harwich line
  crossed the Plymouth line a little to the south of the square.</p>

  <p>"Caverley House, obviously," said Dick.</p>

  <p>He wanted to get out in the open, he wanted to talk, to discuss this
  monstrous thing with Elk. Had the detective also recognized the voice, he
  wondered? Any doubt he had on that point was set at rest. He had hardly
  reached Whitehall before Elk said:</p>

  <p>"Sounded very like a friend of ours, Captain Gordon?"</p>

  <p>Dick made no reply.</p>

  <p>"Very like," said Elk as if he were speaking half to himself. "In fact,
  I'll take any number of oaths that I know the young lady who was talking for
  old man Frog."</p>

  <p>"Why should she do it?" groaned Dick. "Why, for the love of heaven, should
  she do it?"</p>

  <p>"I remember years ago hearing her," said Elk reminiscently.</p>

  <p>Dick Gordon stopped, and, turning, glared at the other.</p>

  <p>"You remember...what do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"She was on the stage at the time&mdash;quite a kid," continued Elk. "They
  called her 'The Child Mimic.' There's another thing I've noticed, Captain: if
  you take a magnifying glass and look at your skin, you see its defects, don't
  you? That wireless telephone acts as a sort of magnifying glass to the voice.
  She always had a little lisp that I jumped at straight away. You may not have
  noticed it, but I've got pretty sharp ears. She can't pronounce her 'S's'
  properly, there's a sort of faint 'th' sound in 'um. You heard that?"</p>

  <p>Dick had heard, and nodded.</p>

  <p>"I never knew that she was ever on the stage," he said more calmly. "You
  are sure, Elk?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. In some things I'm...what's the word?&mdash;infall-i-able. I'm a
  bit shaky on dates, such as when Henry the First an' all that bunch got
  born&mdash;I never was struck on birthdays anyway&mdash;but I know voices an'
  noses. Never forget 'um."</p>

  <p>They were turning into the dark entrance of Scotland Yard when Dick said
  in a tone of despair:</p>

  <p>"It was her voice, of course. I had no idea she had been on the
  stage&mdash;is her father in this business?"</p>

  <p>"She hasn't a father so far as I know," was the staggering reply, and
  again Gordon halted.</p>

  <p>"Are you mad?" he asked. "Ella Bennett has a father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not talking about Ella Bennett," said the calm Elk. "I'm talking
  about Lola Bassano."</p>

  <p>There was a silence.</p>

  <p>"Was it her voice?" asked Gordon a little breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Sure it was Lola. It was a pretty good imitation of Miss Bennett, but any
  mimic will tell you that these soft voices are easy. It's the pace of a voice
  that makes it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You villain!" said Dick Gordon, as a weight rolled from his heart. "You
  knew I meant Ella Bennett when I was talking, and you strung me alone!"</p>

  <p>"Blame me," said Elk. "What's the time?"</p>

  <p>It was half-past three. He gathered his reserves, and ten minutes later
  the police cars dropped a party at the closed door of Caverley House. The
  bell brought the night porter, who recognized Elk.</p>

  <p>"More gas trouble?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Want to see the house plan," said Elk, and listened as the porter
  detailed the names, occupations and peculiarities of the tenants.</p>

  <p>"Who owns this block?" asked the detective.</p>

  <p>"This is one of Maitland's properties&mdash;Maitlands Consolidated. He's
  got the Prince of Caux's house in Berkeley Square and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about giving me his family history. What time did Miss
  Bassano come in?"</p>

  <p>"She's been in all the evening&mdash;since eleven."</p>

  <p>"Anybody with her?"</p>

  <p>The man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Maitland came in with her, but he went soon after."</p>

  <p>"Nobody else?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody except Mr. Maitland."</p>

  <p>"Give me your master-key."</p>

  <p>The porter demurred.</p>

  <p>"I'll lose my job," he pleaded. "Can't you knock?"</p>

  <p>"Knocking is my speciality&mdash;I don't pass a day without knocking
  somebody," replied Elk, "but I want that key."</p>

  <p>He did not doubt that Lola would have bolted her door, and his surmise
  proved sound. He had both to knock and ring before the light showed behind
  the transom, and Lola in a kimono and boudoir cap appeared.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this, Mr. Elk?" she demanded. She did not even
  attempt to appear surprised.</p>

  <p>"A friendly call&mdash;can I come in?"</p>

  <p>She opened the door wider, and Elk went in, followed by Gordon and two
  detectives. Dick she ignored.</p>

  <p>"I'm seeing the Commissioner to-morrow," she said, "and if he doesn't give
  me satisfaction I'll get on to the newspapers. This persecution is
  disgraceful. To break into a single girl's flat in the middle of the night,
  when she is alone and unprotected&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If there is any time when a single girl should be alone and unprotected,
  it is in the middle of the night," said Elk primly. "I'm just going to have a
  look at your little home, Lola. We've got information that you've been
  burgled, Lola. Perhaps at this very minute there's a sinister man hidden
  under your bed. The idea of leaving you alone, so to speak, at the mercy of
  unlawful characters, is repugnant to our feelin's. Try the dining-room,
  Williams; I'll search the parlour&mdash;<i>and</i> the bedroom."</p>

  <p>"You'll keep out of my room if you've any sense of decency," said the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"I haven't," admitted Elk, "no false sense, anyway. Besides, Lola, I'm a
  family man. One of ten. And when there's anything I shouldn't see, just say
  'Shut your eyes' and I'll shut 'um."</p>

  <p>To all appearances there was nothing that looked in the slightest degree
  suspicious. A bathroom led from the bedroom, and the bathroom window was
  open. Flashing his lamp along the wall outside, Elk saw a small glass spool
  attached to the wall.</p>

  <p>"Looks to me like an insulator," he said.</p>

  <p>Returning to the bedroom, he began to search for the instrument. There was
  a tall mahogany wardrobe against one of the walls. Opening the door, he saw
  row upon row of dresses and thrust in his hand.</p>

  <p>It was the shallowest wardrobe he had ever seen, and the backing was warm
  to the touch.</p>

  <p>"Hot cupboard, Lola?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She did not reply, but stood watching him, a scowl on her pretty face, her
  arms folded.</p>

  <p>Elk closed the door and his sensitive fingers searched the surface for a
  spring. It took him a long time to discover it, but at last he found a slip
  of wood that yielded to the pressure of his hand.</p>

  <p>There was a "click" and the front of the wardrobe began to fall.</p>

  <p>"A wardrobe bed, eh? Grand little things for a flat."</p>

  <p>But it was no sleeping-place that was revealed (and he would have been
  disappointed if it had been) as he eased down the "bed." Set on a frame were
  row upon row of valve lamps, transformers&mdash;all the apparatus requisite
  for broadcasting.</p>

  <p>Elk looked, and, looking, admired.</p>

  <p>"You've got a licence, I suppose?" asked Elk. He supposed nothing of the
  kind, for licences to transmit are jealously issued in England. He was
  surprised when she went to a bureau and produced the document. Elk read and
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"You've got <i>some</i> pull," he said with respect. "Now I'll see your
  Frog licence."</p>

  <p>"Don't get funny, Elk," she said tartly. "I'd like to know whether you're
  in the habit of waking people to ask for their permits."</p>

  <p>"You've been using this to-night to broadcast the Frogs," Elk nodded
  accusingly; "and perhaps you'll explain to Captain Gordon why?"</p>

  <p>She turned to Dick for the first time.</p>

  <p>"I've not used the instrument for weeks," she said. "But the sister of a
  friend of mine&mdash;perhaps you know her&mdash;asked if she might use it.
  She left here an hour ago."</p>

  <p>"You mean Miss Bennett, of course," said Gordon, and she raised her
  eyebrows in simulated astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Why, how did you guess that?"</p>

  <p>"I guessed it," said Elk, "the moment I heard you giving one of your
  famous imitations. I guessed she was around, teaching you how to talk like
  her. Lola, you're cooked! Miss Bennett was standing right alongside me when
  you started talking Frog-language. She was right at my very side, and she
  said 'Now, Mr. Elk, isn't she the artfullest thing!' You're cooked, Lola, and
  you can't do better than sit right down and tell us the truth. I'll make it
  right for you. We caught 'Seven' last night and he's told us everything. Frog
  will be in irons to-day, and I came here to give you the last final chance of
  getting out of all your trouble."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that wonderful of you?" she mocked him. "So you've caught 'Seven'
  and you're catching the Frog! Put a pinch of salt on his tail!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the imperturbable Elk, untruthfully, "we caught Seven and
  Hagn's split. But I like you, Lol&mdash;always did. There's something about
  you that reminds me of a girl I used to be crazy about&mdash;I never married
  her; it was a tragedy.</p>

  <p>"Not for her," said Lola. "Now I'll tell you something, Elk! You haven't
  caught anybody and you won't. You've put a flat-footed stool pigeon named
  Balder into the same cell as Hagn, with the idea of getting information, and
  you're going to have a jar."</p>

  <p>In other circumstances Dick Gordon would have been amused by the effect of
  this revelation upon Elk. The jaw of the unhappy detective dropped as he
  glared helplessly over his glasses at the girl, smiling her triumph. Then the
  smile vanished.</p>

  <p>"Hagn wouldn't talk, because Frog could reach him, as he reached Mills and
  Litnov. As he will reach you when he decides you're worth while. And now you
  can take me if you want. I'm a Frog&mdash;I never pretend I'm not. You heard
  all the tale that I told Ray Bennett&mdash;heard it over the detectaphone you
  planted. Take me and charge me!"</p>

  <p>Elk knew that there was no charge upon which he could hold her. And she
  knew that he knew.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you'll get away with it, Bassano?"</p>

  <p>It was Gordon who spoke, and she turned her wrathful eyes upon him.</p>

  <p>"I've got a Miss to my name, Gordon," she rapped at him.</p>

  <p>"Sooner or later you'll have a number," said Dick calmly. "You and your
  crowd are having the time of your young lives&mdash;perhaps because I'm
  incompetent, or because I'm unfortunate. But some day we shall get you,
  either I or my successor. You can't fight the law and win because the law is
  everlasting and constant."</p>

  <p>"A search of my flat I don't mind&mdash;but a sermon I will not have," she
  said contemptuously. "And now, if you men have finished, I should like to get
  a little beauty sleep."</p>

  <p>"That is the one thing you don't require," said the gallant Elk, and she
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"You're not a bad man, Elk," she said. "You're a bad detective, but you've
  a heart of gold."</p>

  <p>"If I had, I shouldn't trust myself alone with you," was Elk's parting
  shot.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap19"
     id="chap19">XIX. &mdash; IN ELSHAM WOOD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dick Gordon, in the sudden lightening of his heart which had
  come to him when he realized that his horrible fears were without foundation,
  was inclined to regard the night as having been well spent. This was not
  Elk's view. He was genuinely grave as they drove back to headquarters.</p>

  <p>"I'm frightened of these Frogs, and I admit it," he confessed. "There's a
  bad leakage somewhere&mdash;how should she know that I put Balder in with
  Hagn? That has staggered me. Nobody but two men, in addition to ourselves, is
  in the secret; and if the Frogs are capable of getting that kind of news, it
  is any odds on Hagn knowing that he is being drawn. They frighten me, I tell
  you, Captain Gordon. If they only knew a little, and hadn't got that quite
  right, I should be worried. But they know everything!"</p>

  <p>Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"The whole trouble, Elk, is that the Frogs are not an illegal association.
  It may be necessary to ask the Prime Minister to proclaim the society."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he's a Frog too," said Elk gloomily. "Don't laugh, Captain
  Gordon! There are big people behind these Frogs. I'm beginning to suspect
  everybody."</p>

  <p>"Start by suspecting me," said Gordon good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"I have," was the frank reply. "Then it occurred to me that possibly I
  walk in my sleep&mdash;I used to as a boy. Likely I lead a double life, and I
  am a detective by day and a Frog by night&mdash;you never know. It is clear
  that there is a genius at the back of the Frogs," he went on, with
  unconscious immodesty.</p>

  <p>"Lola Bassano?" suggested Dick.</p>

  <p>"I've thought of her, but she's no organizer. She had a company on the
  road when she was nineteen, and it died the death from bad organization. I
  suppose you think that that doesn't mean she couldn't run the Frogs&mdash;but
  it does. You want exactly the same type of intelligence to control the Frogs
  as you want to control a bank. Maitland is the man. I narrowed the circle
  down to him after I had a talk with Johnson. Johnson says he's never seen the
  old man's pass-book, and although he is his private secretary, knows nothing
  whatever of his business transactions except that he buys property and sells
  it. The money old Maitland makes on the side never appears in the books, and
  Johnson was a very surprised man when I suggested that Maitland transacted
  any business at all outside the general routine of the company. And it's not
  a company at all&mdash;not an incorporated company. It's a one man show.
  Would you like to make sure, Captain Gordon?"</p>

  <p>"Sure of what?" asked Dick, startled.</p>

  <p>"That Miss Bennett isn't in this at all."</p>

  <p>"You don't think for one moment she is?" asked Dick, aghast at the
  thought.</p>

  <p>"I'm prepared to believe anything," said Elk. "We've got a clear road; we
  could be at Horsham in an hour, and it is our business to make sure. In my
  mind I'm perfectly satisfied that it was not Miss Bennett's voice. But when
  we come down to writing out reports for the people upstairs to read, ('the
  people upstairs,' was Elk's invariable symbol for his superiors), we are
  going to look silly if we say that we heard Miss Bennett's voice and didn't
  trouble to find out where Miss Bennett was."</p>

  <p>"That is true," said Dick thoughtfully, and, leaning out to the driver,
  Elk gave new directions.</p>

  <p>The grey of dawn was in the sky as the car ran through the deserted
  streets of Horsham and began the steady climb toward Maytree Cottage, which
  lay on the slope of the Shoreham Road.</p>

  <p>The cottage showed no signs of life. The blinds were drawn; there was no
  light of any kind. Dick hesitated, with his hand on the gate.</p>

  <p>"I don't like waking these people," he confessed. "Old Bennett will
  probably think that I've brought some bad news about his son."</p>

  <p>"I have no conscience," said Elk, and walked up the brick path.</p>

  <p>But John Bennett required no waking. Elk was hailed from one of the
  windows above, and, looking up, saw the mystery man leaning with his elbows
  on the window-sill.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble, Elk?" he asked in a low voice, as though he did not
  wish to awaken his daughter.</p>

  <p>"No trouble at all," said Elk cheerfully. "We picked up a wireless
  telephone message in the night, and I'm under the impression that it was your
  daughter's voice I heard."</p>

  <p>John Bennett frowned, and Dick saw that he doubted the truth of this
  explanation.</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly true, Mr. Bennett," he said. "I heard the voice too. We
  were listening in for a rather important message, and we heard Miss Bennett
  in circumstances which make it necessary for us to assure ourselves that it
  was not she who was speaking."</p>

  <p>The cloud passed from John Bennett's face.</p>

  <p>"That's a queer sort of story, Captain Gordon, but I believe you. I'll
  come down and let you in."</p>

  <p>Wearing an old dressing-gown, he opened the door and ushered them into the
  darkened sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"I'll call Ella, and perhaps she'll be able to satisfy you hat she was in
  bed at ten o'clock last night."</p>

  <p>He went out of the room, after drawing the curtains to let in the light,
  and Dick waited with a certain amount of pleasurable anticipation. He had
  been only too glad of the excuse to come to Horsham, if the truth be told.
  This girl had so gripped his heart that the days between their meetings
  seemed like eternity. They heard the feet of Bennett on the stairs, and
  presently the old man came in, and distress was written largely on his
  face.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it," he said. "Ella is not in her room! The bed has
  been slept in, but she has evidently dressed and gone out."</p>

  <p>Elk scratched his chin, avoiding Dick's eyes.</p>

  <p>"A lot of young people like getting up early," he said. "When I was a
  young man, nothing gave me greater pleasure than to see the sun rise&mdash;
  before I went to bed. Is she in the habit of taking a morning stroll?"</p>

  <p>John Bennett shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've never known her to do that before. It's curious I did not hear her,
  because I slept very badly last night. Will you excuse me, gentlemen?"</p>

  <p>He went upstairs and came down in a few minutes, dressed. Together they
  passed out into the garden It was now quite light, though the sun had not yet
  tipped the horizon. John Bennett made a brief but fruitless search of the
  ground behind the cottage, and came hack to them with a confession of
  failure. He was no more troubled than Dick Gordon. It was impossible that it
  could have been she, that Elk was mistaken. Yet Lola had been emphatic.
  Against that, the hall-porter at Caverley House had been equally certain that
  the only visitor to Lola's flat that night was the aged Mr. Maitland; and so
  far as he knew, or Elk had been able to discover, there was no other entrance
  into the building.</p>

  <p>"I see you have a car here. You came down by road. Did you pass
  anybody?"</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if we take the car in the opposite direction toward
  Shoreham?"</p>

  <p>"I was going to suggest that," said Gordon, "Isn't it rather dangerous for
  her, walking at this hour? The roads are thronged with tramps."</p>

  <p>The older man made no reply. He sat with the driver, his eyes fixed
  anxiously upon the road ahead. The car went ten miles at express speed, then
  turned, and began a search of the side roads. Nearing the cottage again, Dick
  pointed.</p>

  <p>"'What is that wood?" he asked pointing to a dense wood to which a narrow
  road led.</p>

  <p>"That is Elsham Wood; she wouldn't go there," he hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Let us try it," said Dick, and the bonnet of the car was turned on to a
  narrow road. In a few minutes they were running through a glade of high
  trees, the entwining tops of which made the road a place of gloom.</p>

  <p>"There are car tracks here," said Dick suddenly, but John Bennett shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>"People come here for picnics," he said, but Dick was not satisfied.</p>

  <p>These marks were new, and presently he saw them turn off the road to a
  'ride' between the trees. He caught no glimpse of a car, however. The
  direction of the tracks supported the old man's theory. The road ended a mile
  farther along, and beyond that was a waste of bracken and tree stumps, for
  the wood had been extensively thinned during the war.</p>

  <p>With some difficulty the car was turned and headed back again. They came
  through the glade into the open, and then Dick uttered a cry.</p>

  <p>John Bennett had already seen the girl. She was walking quickly in the
  centre of the road, and stepped on to the grassy border without looking round
  as the car came abreast of her. Then, looking up, she saw her father, and
  went pale.</p>

  <p>He was in the road in a moment.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said reproachfully, "where have you been at this hour?"</p>

  <p>She looked frightened, Dick thought. The eyes of Elk narrowed as he
  surveyed her.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't sleep, so I dressed and went out, father," she said, and
  nodded to Dick. "You're a surprising person, Captain Gordon. Why are you here
  at this hour?"</p>

  <p>"I came to interview you," said Dick, forcing a smile.</p>

  <p>"Me!" She was genuinely astonished. "Why me?"</p>

  <p>"Captain Gordon heard your voice on a wireless telephone in the middle of
  the night, and wanted to know ail about it," said her father.</p>

  <p>If he was relieved, he was also troubled. Looking at him, Elk suddenly saw
  the relief intensified, and with his quick intuition guessed the cause before
  John Bennett put the question.</p>

  <p>"Was it Ray?" he asked eagerly. "Did he come down?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, father," she said quietly. "And as to the wireless telephone, I have
  never spoken into a wireless telephone, and I don't think I've ever seen
  one," she said.</p>

  <p>"Of course you haven't," said Dick. "Only we were rather worried when we
  heard your voice, but Mr. Elk's explanation, that it was somebody speaking
  whose voice was very much like yours, is obviously correct."</p>

  <p>"Tell me this, Miss Bennett," said Elk quietly. "Were you in town last
  night?"</p>

  <p>She did not reply.</p>

  <p>"My daughter went to bed at ten," said John Bennett roughly. "What is the
  sense of asking her whether she was in London last night?"</p>

  <p>"Were you in town in the early hours of this morning, Miss Bennett?"
  persisted Elk, and to Dick's amazement she nodded.</p>

  <p>"Were you at Caverley House?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered instantly.</p>

  <p>"But, Ella, what were you doing in town?" asked John Bennett. "Did you go
  to see that wretched brother of yours?"</p>

  <p>Again the hesitation, and then:</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Did you go by yourself?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Ella, and her lip trembled. "I wish you wouldn't ask me any
  further questions. I'm not a free agent in the matter. Daddy, you've always
  trusted me: you'll trust me now, won't you?"</p>

  <p>He took her hand and held it in both of his.</p>

  <p>"I'll trust you always, girlie," he said; "and these gentlemen must do the
  same."</p>

  <p>Her challenging eyes met Dick's, and he nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am one who will share that trust," he said, and something in her look
  rewarded him.</p>

  <p>Elk rubbed his chin fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Being naturally of a trusting nature, I should no more think of doubting
  your word, Miss Bennett, than I should of believing myself." He looked at his
  watch. "I think we'll go along and fetch poor old Balder from the house of
  sin," he said.</p>

  <p>"You'll stop and have some breakfast?"</p>

  <p>Dick looked pleadingly at Elk, and the detective, with an air of
  resignation, agreed.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, Balder won't mind an hour more or less," he said. Whilst Ella was
  preparing the breakfast, Dick and Elk paced the road outside.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of it, Captain?"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand, but I have every confidence that Miss Bennett has not
  lied," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"Faith is a wonderful thing," murmured Elk, and Dick turned on him
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean what I say. I have got faith in Miss Bennett," he said soothingly;
  "and, after all, she's only another little hit of the jigsaw puzzle that will
  fall into place when we fix the piece that's shaped like a Frog. And John
  Bennett's another." he said after a moment's thought.</p>

  <p>From where they stood they could see, looking toward Shoreham, the opening
  of the narrow Elsham Wood road.</p>

  <p>"The thing that puzzles me," Elk was saying, "is why she should go into
  that wood in the middle of the night&mdash;" He stopped, lowering his head.
  There came to them the soft purr of a motor-car. "Where is that?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>The question was answered instantly. Slowly there came into view from the
  wood road the bonnet of a car, followed immediately by the remainder of a
  large limousine, which turned toward them, gathering speed as it came. A
  moment later it flashed past them, and they saw the solitary occupant.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned!" said Elk, who very infrequently indulged in profanity,
  but Dick felt that on this occasion at least he was justified. For the man in
  the limousine was the bearded Ezra Maitland; and he knew that it was to see
  Maitland that the girl had gone to Elsham Wood.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap20"
     id="chap20">XX. &mdash; HAGN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A minute later Ella came to the door to call them. "Was that
  a car went past?" she asked, and they detected a note of anxiety in her
  tone.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Elk, "it was a big car. Didn't see who was in it, but it was a
  big car."</p>

  <p>Dick heard her sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Will you come in, please?" she said. "Breakfast is waiting for you."</p>

  <p>They left half an hour later, and each man was so busy with his own
  thoughts that Dick did not speak until they were passing the villas where the
  body of Genter had been found. It was near Horsham that Genter was killed,
  the remembered with a little shudder. Outside of Horsham he himself had seen
  the dead man's feet extended beyond the back of a motor-van. Hagn should die
  for that; whether he was Frog or not, he was party to that murder. As if
  reading his thoughts, Elk turned to him and said:</p>

  <p>"Do you think your evidence is strong enough to hang Hagn?"</p>

  <p>"I was wondering," said Dick. "There is no supporting evidence,
  unfortunately, but the car which you have under lock and key, and the fact
  that the garage keeper may be able to identify him."</p>

  <p>"With his beard?" asked Elk significantly. "There is going to be some
  difficulty in securing a conviction against this frog, believe me, Captain
  Gordon. And unless old Balder induces him to make a statement, we shall have
  all the difficulty in the world in convincing a jury. Personally," he added,
  "if I was condemned to spend a night with Balder, I should tell the truth, if
  it was only to get rid of him. He's a pretty clever fellow, is Balder. People
  don't realize that&mdash;he has the makings of a first-class detective, if we
  could only get him to take a happier view of life."</p>

  <p>He directed the driver to go straight to the door of Cannon Row.</p>

  <p>Dick's mind was on another matter.</p>

  <p>"What did she want with Maitland?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Elk shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he confessed. "Of course, she might have been persuading
  him to take back her brother, but old Maitland isn't the kind of adventurer
  who'd get up in the middle of the night to discuss giving Ray Bennett his job
  back. If he was a younger man, yes. But he's not young. He's darned old. And
  he's a wicked old man, who doesn't care two cents whether Ray Bennett is
  working at his desk for so much per, or whether he's breaking stones on
  Dartmoor. I tell you, that's one of the minor mysteries which will be cleared
  up when we get the Frog piece in its place."</p>

  <p>The car stopped at the entrance of Cannon Row police station, and the men
  jumped down. The desk sergeant stood up as they came in, and eyed them
  wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to take Balder out, sergeant."</p>

  <p>"Balder?" said the man in surprise. "I didn't know Balder was in."</p>

  <p>"I put him in with Hagn."</p>

  <p>A light dawned upon the station official.</p>

  <p>"That's queer. I didn't know it was Balder," he said. "I wasn't on duty
  when he came in, but the other sergeant told me that a man had been put in
  with Hagn. Here is the gaoler."</p>

  <p>That official came in at that moment, and was as astonished as the
  sergeant to learn the identity of the second prisoner.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea it was Balder, sir," he said. "That accounts for the long
  talk they had&mdash;they were talking up till one o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Are they still talking?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, they're sleeping now. I had a look at them a little time
  ago&mdash;you remember you gave me orders to leave them alone and not to go
  near them."</p>

  <p>Dick Gordon and his subordinate followed the gaoler down a long passage
  faced with glazed brick, the wall of which was studded at intervals by narrow
  black doors. Reaching the end of the corridor, they turned at right angles.
  The second passage had only one door, and that was at the end. Snapping back
  the lock, the gaoler threw open the door, and Elk went in.</p>

  <p>Elk went to the first of the figures and pulled aside the blanket which
  covered the face. Then, with an oath, he drew the blanket clear.</p>

  <p>It was Balder, and he was lying on his back, covered from head to foot
  with a blanket. A silk scarf was twisted round his mouth; his wrists were not
  only handcuffed but strapped, as were his legs.</p>

  <p>Elk dashed at the second figure, but as he touched the blanket, it sank
  under his hands. A folded coat, to give resemblance to a human figure, a lair
  of battered shoes, placed artificially at the end of the blanket&mdash;these
  were all. Hagn had disappeared!</p>

  <p>When they got the man into Elk's office, and had given him brandy, and
  Elk, by sheer bullying, had reduced him to coherence, Balder told his
  story.</p>

  <p>"I think it was round about two o'clock when it happened," he said. "I'd
  been talking all the evening to this Hagn, though it was very clear to me,
  with my experience, that he spotted me the moment I came in, as a police
  officer, and was kidding me along all the evening. Still, I persevered, Mr.
  Elk. I'm the sort of man that never says die. That's the peculiar thing about
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The peculiar thing about you," said Elk wearily, "is your passionate
  admiration of Balder. Get on!"</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I did try," said Balder in an injured voice; "and I thought I'd
  got over his suspicion, because he began talking about Frogs, and telling me
  that there was going to be a wireless call to all the heads to-
  night&mdash;that is, last night. He told me that Number Seven would never be
  captured, because he was too clever. He asked me how Mills had been killed,
  but I'm perfectly sure, the way he put the question, that he knew. We didn't
  talk very much after one, and at a quarter past one I lay down, and I must
  have gone to sleep almost at once. The first thing I knew was that they were
  putting a gag in my mouth. I tried to struggle, but they held me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They?" said Elk. "How many were there?"</p>

  <p>"There may have been two or three&mdash;I'm not certain," said Balder. "If
  it had been only two, I think I could have managed, for I am naturally
  strong. There must have been more. I only saw two besides Hagn."</p>

  <p>"Was the cell door open?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, it was ajar," said Balder after he had considered a moment.</p>

  <p>"What did they look like?"</p>

  <p>"They were wearing long black overcoats, but they made no attempt to hide
  their faces. I should know them anywhere. They were young men&mdash;at least,
  one was. What happened after that I don't know. They put a strap round my
  legs, pulled the blanket over me, and that's all I saw or heard until the
  cell door closed. I have been lying there all night, sir, thinking of my wife
  and children..."</p>

  <p>Elk cut him short, and, leaving the man in charge of another police clerk,
  he went across to make a more careful examination of the cell. The two
  passages were shaped like a capital L, the special cell being at the end of
  the shorter branch. At the elbow was a barred door leading into the
  courtyard, where men waiting trial were loaded into the prison van and
  distributed to various places of detention. The warder sat at the top of the
  L, in a small glass-panelled cubby-hole, where the cell indicators were. Each
  cell was equipped with a bell-push in case of illness, and the signals showed
  in this tiny office. From where he sat, the warder commanded, not only a view
  of the passage, but a side view of the door. Questioned, he admitted that he
  had been twice into the charge room for a few minutes at a time; once when a
  man arrested for drunkenness had demanded to see a doctor, and another time,
  about half-past two in the morning, to take over a burglar who had been
  captured in the course of the night.</p>

  <p>"And, of course, it was during that time that the men got away," said
  Elk.</p>

  <p>The door into the courtyard was locked but not bolted. It could be opened
  from either side. The cell door could also open from both sides. In this
  respect it differed from every other cell in the station; but the explanation
  was that it was frequently used for important prisoners, whom it was
  necessary to subject to lengthy interrogations; and the lock had been chosen
  to give the police officers who were inside an opportunity of leaving the
  cell when they desired, without calling for the gaoler. The lock had not been
  picked, neither had the lock of the yard door.</p>

  <p>Elk sent immediately for the policemen who were on duty at either entrance
  of Scotland Yard. The officer who was on guard at the Embankment entrance had
  seen nobody. The man at the Whitehall opening remembered seeing an inspector
  of police pass out at half-past two. He was perfectly sure the officer was an
  inspector, because he wore the hanging sword-belt, and the policeman had seen
  the star on his shoulder and had saluted him&mdash;a salute which the officer
  had returned.</p>

  <p>"This may or may not be one of them," said Elk. "If it is, what happened
  to the other two?"</p>

  <p>But here evidence failed. The men had disappeared as though they had
  dissipated into air.</p>

  <p>"We're going to get a roasting for this, Captain Gordon," said Elk; "and
  if we escape without being scorched, we're lucky. Fortunately, nobody but
  ourselves knows that Hagn has been arrested; and when I say 'ourselves,' I
  wish I meant it! You had better go home and go to bed; I had some sleep in
  the night. If you'll wait while I send this bleating clerk of mine home to
  his well-advertised wife and family, I'll walk home with you."</p>

  <p>Dick was waiting on the edge of Whitehall when Elk joined him.</p>

  <p>"There will be a departmental inquiry, of course. We can't help that," he
  said. "The only thing that worries me is that I've got poor old Balder into
  bad odour, and I was trying to put him right. I don't know what the
  experience of the Boy Scouts is," he went off at a tangent, "but my own is
  that the worst service you can render to any man is to try to do him a good
  turn."</p>

  <p>It was now nearly ten o'clock, and Dick was feeling faint with hunger and
  lack of sleep, for he had eaten nothing at Horsham. Once or twice, as they
  walked toward Harley Terrace, Elk looked back over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Expecting anybody?" asked Dick, suddenly alive to the possibility of
  danger.</p>

  <p>"No-o, not exactly," said Elk. "But I've got a hunch that we're being
  followed."</p>

  <p>"I saw a man just now who I thought was following us," said Dick, "a man
  in a fawn raincoat."</p>

  <p>"Oh, him?" said Elk, indifferent alike to the rules of grammar and the
  presence of his shadow. "That is one of my men. There's another on the other
  side of the road. I'm not thinking of them, my mind for the moment being
  fixed on Frogs. Do you mind if we cross the road?" he asked hurriedly, and,
  without waiting for a reply, caught Gordon's arm and led him across the broad
  thoroughfare. "I always object to walking on the same side of a street as the
  traffic runs. I like to meet traffic; it's not good to be overtaken. I
  thought so!"</p>

  <p>A small Ford van, painted with the name of a laundry, which had been
  crawling along behind them, suddenly spurted and went ahead at top speed. Elk
  followed the car with his eyes until it reached the Trafalgar Square end of
  Whitehall. Instead of branching left toward Pall Mall or right to the Strand,
  the van swung round in a half-circle and came back to meet them. Elk half
  turned and made a signal.</p>

  <p>"This is where we follow the example of the chicken," said Elk, and made
  another hurried crossing.</p>

  <p>When they reached the pavement he looked round. The detectives who were
  following him had understood his signal, and one had leaped on the
  running-board of the van, which was pulled up to the pavement. There was a
  few minutes' talk between the driver and the officer, and then they all drove
  off together.</p>

  <p>"Pinched," said Elk laconically. "He'll take him to the station on some
  charge or other and hold him. I guessed he'd see what I was after&mdash;my
  man, I mean. The easiest way to shadow is to shadow in a trade truck," said
  Elk. "A trade van can do anything it likes; it can loiter by the pavement, it
  can turn round and go back, it can go fast or slow, and nobody takes the
  slightest notice. If that had been a limousine, it would have attracted the
  attention of every policeman by drawling along by the pavement, so as to over
  take us just at the right minute. Probably it wasn't any more than a shadow,
  but to me," he said with a quiver of his shoulder, "it felt rather like
  sudden death!"</p>

  <p>Whether Elk's cheerfulness was assumed or natural, he succeeded in
  impressing his companion.</p>

  <p>"Let's take a cab," said Dick, and such was his doubt that he waited for
  three empty taxis to pass before he hailed the fourth. "Come in," said Dick
  when the cab dropped them at Harley Terrace. "I've got a spare room if you
  want to sleep."</p>

  <p>Elk shook his head to the latter suggestion, but accompanied Gordon into
  the house. The man who opened the door had evidently something to say.</p>

  <p>"There's a gentleman waiting to see you, sir. He's been here for half an
  hour."</p>

  <p>"What is his name?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Johnson, sir."</p>

  <p>"Johnson?" said Dick in surprise, and hurried to the dining-room, into
  which the visitor had been ushered.</p>

  <p>It was, indeed, "the philosopher," though Mr. Johnson lacked for the
  moment evidence of that equilibrium which is the chiefest of his possessions.
  The stout man was worried; his face was unusually long; and when Dick went
  into the room, he was sitting uncomfortably on the edge of a chair, as he had
  seen him sitting at Heron's Club, his gloomy eyes fixed upon the carpet.</p>

  <p>"I hope you'll forgive me for coming to see you, Captain Gordon," he said.
  "I've really no right to bring my troubles to you."</p>

  <p>"I hope your troubles aren't as pressing as mine," smiled Dick as he shook
  hands. "You know Mr. Elk?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Elk is an old friend," said Johnson, almost cheerful for a
  second.</p>

  <p>"Well, what is your kick?&mdash;sit down, won't you?" said Dick. "I'm
  going to have a real breakfast. Will you join me?"</p>

  <p>"With pleasure, sir. I've eaten nothing this morning. I usually have a
  little lunch about eleven, but I can't say that I feel very hungry. The fact
  is, Captain Gordon, I'm fired."</p>

  <p>Dick raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;has Maitland fired you?"</p>

  <p>Johnson nodded.</p>

  <p>"And to think that I've served the old devil all these years faithfully,
  on a clerk's salary! I've never given him any cause for complaint, I've
  handled hundreds of thousands&mdash;yes, and millions! And although it's not
  for me to blow my own trumpet, I've never once been a penny out in my
  accounts. Of course, if I had been, he would have found it out in less than
  no time, for he is the greatest mathematician I've ever met. And as sharp as
  a needle! He can write twice as fast as any other man I've known," he added
  with reluctant admiration.</p>

  <p>"It's rather curious that a man of his uncouth appearance and speech
  should have those attainments," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"It's a wonder to me," confessed Johnson. "In fact, it has been a standing
  wonder to me ever since I've known him. You'd think he was a dustman or a
  tramp, to hear him talk, yet he's a very well-read man, of extraordinary
  educational qualities."</p>

  <p>"Can he remember dates?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>"He can even remember dates," replied Johnson seriously. "A queer old man,
  and in many ways an unpleasant old man. I'm not saying this because he's
  fired me; I've always had the same view. He's without a single spark of
  kindness; I think the only human thing about him is his love for this little
  boy."</p>

  <p>"What little boy?" asked Elk, immediately interested.</p>

  <p>"I've never seen him," said Johnson. "The child has never been brought to
  the office. I don't know who he is or whose he is; I've an idea he's a
  grandchild of Maitland's."</p>

  <p>There was a pause.</p>

  <p>"I see," said Dick softly, and well he did see, for in that second began
  his understanding of the Frog and the secret of the Frog.</p>

  <p>"Why were you fired?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Johnson shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Over a stupid thing; in fact, it's hardly worth talking about. It appears
  the old man saw me at Heron's Club the other night, and ever since then he's
  been going carefully into my petty cash account, probably under the
  impression that I was living a fast life! Beyond the usual grousing, there
  was nothing in his manner to suggest that he intended getting rid of me; but
  this morning, when I came, I found that he had already arrived, which was an
  unusual circumstance. He doesn't as a rule get to the office until about an
  hour after we start work. 'Johnson,' he said, 'I understand that you know a
  Miss Ella Bennett.'I replied that I was fortunate enough to know the lady.
  'And I understand,' he went on, 'that you've been down there to lunch on one
  or two occasions.' 'That is perfectly true, Mr. Maitland,' I replied. 'Very
  well, Johnson,' said Maitland, 'you're fired.'"</p>

  <p>"And that was all?" asked Dick in amazement.</p>

  <p>"That was all," said Johnson in a hushed voice. "Can you understand
  it?"</p>

  <p>Dick could have said yes, but he did not. Elk, more curious, and
  passionately anxious to extend his knowledge of the mysterious Maitland, had
  something to ask.</p>

  <p>"Johnson, you've been right close to this man Maitland for years. Have you
  noticed anything about him that's particularly suspicious?"</p>

  <p>"Like what, Mr. Elk?"</p>

  <p>"Has he had any visitors for whom you couldn't account? Have you known
  him, for example, to do anything which would suggest to you that he had
  something to do with the Frogs?"</p>

  <p>"The Frogs?" Johnson opened his eyes wide, and his voice emphasized his
  incredulity. "Bless you, no! I shouldn't imagine he knows anything about
  these people. You mean the tramps who have committed so many crimes? No, Mr.
  Elk, I've never heard or seen or read anything which gave me that
  impression."</p>

  <p>"You've seen the records of most of his transactions: are there any that
  he has made which would lead you to believe that he had benefited, say, by
  the death of Mr. Maclean in Dundee, or by the attack which was made upon the
  woollen merchant at Derby? For example, do you know whether he has been
  engaged in the buying or selling of French brandies or perfumes?"</p>

  <p>Johnson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he deals only in real estate. He has properties in this country
  and in the South of France and in America. He has done a little business in
  exchanges; in fact, we did a very large exchange business until the mark
  broke."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do now, Mr. Johnson?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>The other made a gesture of helplessness.</p>

  <p>"What can I do, sir?" he asked. "I am nearly fifty; I've spent most of my
  working life in one job, and it is very unlikely that I can get another.
  Fortunately for me, I've not only saved money, but I have had one or two
  lucky investments, and for those I must be grateful to the old man. I don't
  think he was particularly pleased when he found that I'd followed his advice,
  but that's beside the question. I do owe him that. I've just about enough
  money to keep me for the rest of my life if I go quietly and do not engage in
  any extraordinary speculations. Why I came to see you was to ask you, Captain
  Gordon, if you had any kind of opening. I should like a little spare time
  work, and I'd be most happy to work with you."</p>

  <p>Dick was rather embarrassed, because the opportunities for employing Mr.
  Johnson were few and far between. Nevertheless, he was anxious to help the
  man.</p>

  <p>"Let me give the matter a day or two's thought," he said. "What is
  Maitland doing for a secretary?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. That is my chief worry. I saw a letter lying on his desk,
  addressed to Miss Ella Bennett, and I have got an idea that he intends
  offering her the job."</p>

  <p>Dick could hardly believe his ears.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir, only once or twice the old man has inquired whether
  Ray has a sister. He took quite an interest in her for two or three days. and
  then let the matter drop. It is as astonishing as anything he has ever
  done."</p>

  <p>Elk for some reason felt immensely sorry for the man. He as so obviously
  and patently unfitted for the rough and humble of competition. And the
  opportunities which awaited a man of fifty worn to one groove were
  practically non-existent.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I can help you either, Mr. Johnson," he said. "As far
  as Miss Bennett is concerned, I imagine that there is no possibility of her
  accepting any such offer, supposing Maitland made it. I'll have your address
  in case I want to communicate with you."</p>

  <p>"431, Fitzroy Square," replied Johnson, and produced a somewhat soiled
  card with an apology. "I haven't much use for cards," he said.</p>

  <p>He walked to the door and hesitated with his hand on its edge.</p>

  <p>"I'm&mdash;I'm very fond of Miss Bennett," he said, "and I'd like her to
  know that Maitland isn't as bad as he looks. I've got to be fair to him!"</p>

  <p>"Poor devil!" said Elk, watching the man through the window as he walked
  dejectedly along Harley Terrace. "It's tough on him. You nearly told him
  about seeing Maitland this morning! I saw that, and was ready to jump in.
  It's the young lady's secret."</p>

  <p>"I wish to heaven it wasn't," said Dick sincerely, and remembered that he
  had asked Johnson to stay to breakfast.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap21"
     id="chap21">XXI. &mdash; MR. JOHNSON'S VISITOR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There is a certain murky likeness between the houses in
  Fitzroy Square, London, and Gramercy Park, New York. Fitzroy Square belongs
  to the Georgian days, when Soho was a fashionable suburb, and St.
  Martins-in-the-Fields was really in the fields, and was not tucked away
  between a Vaudeville house and a picture gallery.</p>

  <p>No. 431 had been subdivided by its owner into three self-contained flats,
  Johnson's being situated on the ground floor. There was a fourth basement
  flat, which was occupied by a man and his wife who acted for the owners, and,
  incidentally, were responsible, in the case of Johnson, for keeping his
  apartments clean and supplying him with the very few meals that he had on the
  premises.</p>

  <p>It was nearly ten o'clock when philosopher Johnson arrived home that
  evening, and he was a very tired man. He had spent the greater part of the
  day in making a series of calls upon financial and real estate houses. To his
  inevitable inquiries he received an inevitable answer. There were no
  vacancies, and certainly no openings for a stoutish man of fifty, who looked,
  to the discerning eyes of the merchants concerned or their managing clerks,
  past his best years of work. Patient Mr. Johnson accepted each rebuff and
  moved on to another field, only to find his experience repeated.</p>

  <p>He let himself in with a latchkey, walked wearily into a little
  sitting-room, and dropped with a sigh to the Chesterfield, for he was not
  given to violent exercise.</p>

  <p>The room in which he sat was prettily, but not expensively furnished. A
  large green carpet covered the floor; the walls were hidden by book-shelves;
  and there was about the place a certain cosiness which money cannot buy.
  Rising after some little time, he walked to his book-shelf, took down a
  volume and spent the next two hours in reading. It was nearly midnight when
  he turned out the light and went to bed.</p>

  <p>His bedroom was at the farther end of the short corridor, and in five
  minutes he was undressed and asleep.</p>

  <p>Mr. Johnson was usually a light but consistent sleeper, but to-night he
  had not been asleep an hour before he was awake again. And wider awake than
  he had been at any portion of the day. Softly he got out of bed, put on his
  slippers and pulled a dressing-gown round him; then, taking something from a
  drawer in his bureau, he opened the door and crept softly along the carpeted
  passage toward his sitting-room.</p>

  <p>He had heard no sound; it was sheer premonition of a pressing danger which
  had wakened him. His hand was on the door-knob, and he had turned it, when he
  heard a faint click. It was the sound of a light being turned off, and the
  sound came from the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>With a quick jerk he threw open the door and reached out his hand for the
  switch; and then, from the blackness of the room, came a warning voice.</p>

  <p>"Touch that light and you die! I've got you covered. Put your gun on the
  floor at your feet&mdash;quick!"</p>

  <p>Johnson stooped and laid down the revolver he had taken from his
  bureau.</p>

  <p>"Now step inside, and step lively," said the voice.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" asked Johnson steadily.</p>

  <p>He strained his eyes to pierce the darkness, and saw the figure now. It
  was standing by his desk, and the shine of something in its hand warned him
  that the threat was no idle one.</p>

  <p>"Never met me?" There was a chuckle of laughter in the voice of the
  Unknown. "I'll bet you haven't! Friend&mdash;meet the Frog!"</p>

  <p>"The Frog?" Johnson repeated the words mechanically.</p>

  <p>"One name's as good as another. That will do for mine," said the stranger.
  "Throw over the key of your desk."</p>

  <p>There was a silence.</p>

  <p>"I haven't my key here," said Johnson. "It is in the bedroom."</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are," warned the voice.</p>

  <p>Johnson had kicked off his slippers softly, and was feeling with his feet
  for the pistol he had laid so obediently on the floor in the first shock of
  surprise. Presently he found it and drew it toward him with his bare
  toes.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked, temporizing.</p>

  <p>"I want to see your office papers&mdash;all the papers you've brought from
  Maitlands."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing here of any value," said Johnson.</p>

  <p>The revolver was now at his feet and a little ahead of him. He kept his
  toes upon the butt, ready to drop just as soon as he could locate with any
  certainty the position of the burglar. But now, though his eyes were growing
  accustomed to the darkness, he could no longer see the owner of the
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Come nearer," said the stranger, "and hold out your hands."</p>

  <p>Johnson made as though to obey, but dropped suddenly to his knees. The
  explosion deafened him. He heard a cry, saw, in the flash of his pistol, a
  dark figure, and then something struck him.</p>

  <p>He came to consciousness ten minutes later, to find the room empty.
  Staggering to his feet, he put on the light and walked unsteadily back to his
  bedroom, to examine the extent of his injuries. He felt the bump on his head
  gingerly, and grinned. Somebody was knocking at the outer door, a peremptory,
  authoritative knocking. With a wet towel to his injured head he went out into
  the passage and opened the front door. He found two policemen at the step and
  a small crowd gathered on the pavement.</p>

  <p>"Has there been shooting here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, constable," said Johnson, "I did a little shooting, but I don't
  think I hit anything."</p>

  <p>"Have you been hurt, sir? Was it burglars?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you. Come in," said Johnson, and led the way back to the
  disordered library.</p>

  <p>The blind was flapping in the draught, for the window, which looked out
  upon a side street, was open.</p>

  <p>"Have you missed anything?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think so," said Johnson. "I think it was rather more
  important than an ordinary burglary. I am going to call Inspector Elk of
  Scotland Yard, and I think you had better leave the room as it is until he
  arrives."</p>

  <p>Elk was in his office, laboriously preparing a report on the escape of
  Hagn, when the call came through. He listened attentively, and then:</p>

  <p>"I'll come down, Johnson. Tell the constable to leave things&mdash;ask him
  to speak to me."</p>

  <p>By the time Elk had arrived, the philosopher was dressed. "He gave you a
  pretty hefty one," said Elk, examining the contusion with a professional
  eye.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't prepared for it. I expected him to shoot, and he must have
  struck at me as I fired."</p>

  <p>"You say it was the Frog himself?" said the sceptical Elk. "I doubt it.
  The Frog has never undertaken a job on his own, so far as I can
  remember."</p>

  <p>"It was either the Frog or one of his trusted emissaries," said Johnson
  with a good-humoured smile. "Look at this."</p>

  <p>On the centre of his pink blotting-pad was stamped the inevitable Frog. It
  appeared also on the panel of the door.</p>

  <p>"That is supposed to be a warning, isn't it?" said Johnson. "Well, I
  hadn't time to get acquainted with the warning before I got mine!"</p>

  <p>"There are worse things than a clubbing," said Elk cheerfully. "You've
  missed nothing?"</p>

  <p>Johnson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, nothing."</p>

  <p>Elk's inspection of the room was short but thorough. It was near the open
  window, blown by the breeze into the folds of the curtain, that he found the
  parcel-room ticket. It was a green slip acknowledging the reception of a
  handbag, and it was issued at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway.</p>

  <p>"Is this yours?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Johnson took the slip from him, examined it and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "I've never seen it before."</p>

  <p>"Anybody else in your flat likely to have left a bag at King's Cross
  station?"</p>

  <p>Again Johnson shook his head and smiled.</p>

  <p>"There is nobody else in this flat," he said, "except myself."</p>

  <p>Elk took the paper under the light and scrutinized the date-stamp. The
  luggage had been deposited a fortnight before, and, as is usual in such
  tickets, the name of the depositor was not given.</p>

  <p>"It may have blown in from the garden," he said. "There is a stiff breeze
  to-night, but I should not imagine that anybody who had got an important
  piece of luggage would leave the ticket to fly around. I'll investigate
  this," he said, and put the ticket carefully away in his pocket-book. "You
  didn't see the man?"</p>

  <p>"I caught a glimpse of him as I fired, and I am under the impression that
  he was masked."</p>

  <p>"Did you recognize his voice?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Johnson, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Elk examined the window. The catch had been cleverly forced&mdash;
  "cleverly" because it was a new type of patent fastening familiar to him, and
  which he did not remember ever having seen forced from the outside before.
  Instinctively his mind went back to the burglary at Lord Farmley's, to that
  beautifully cut handle and blown lock; and though, by no stretch of
  imagination, could the two jobs be compared, yet there was a similarity in
  finish and workmanship which immediately struck him.</p>

  <p>What made this burglary all the more remarkable was that, for the first
  time, there had appeared somebody who claimed to be the Frog himself. Never
  before had the Frog given tangible proof of his existence. He understood the
  organization well enough to know that none of the Frog's willing slaves would
  have dared to use his name. And why did he consider that Johnson was worthy
  of his personal attention?</p>

  <p>"No," said Johnson in answer to his question, "there are no documents here
  of the slightest value. I used to bring home a great deal of work from
  Maitlands; in fact, I have often worked into the middle of the night. That is
  why my dismissal is such a scandalous piece of ingratitude."</p>

  <p>"You have never had any private papers of Maitland's here, which perhaps
  you might have forgotten to return?" asked Elk thoughtfully, and Johnson's
  ready smile and twinkling eyes supplied an answer.</p>

  <p>"That's rather a graceful way of putting the matter," he said. "No, I have
  none of Maitland's documents here. If you care, you can see the contents of
  all my cupboards, drawers and boxes, but I can assure you that I'm a very
  methodical man; I know practically every paper in my possession."</p>

  <p>Walking home, Elk reviewed the matter of this surprising appearance. If
  the truth be told, he was very glad to have some additional problem to keep
  his mind off the very unpleasant interview which was promised for the
  morning. Captain Dick Gordon would assume all responsibility, and probably
  the Commissioners would exonerate Elk from any blame; but to the detective,
  the "people upstairs" were almost as formidable as the Frog himself.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap22"
     id="chap22">XXII. &mdash; THE INQUIRY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He intended making an early call at King's Cross to examine
  the contents of the bag, but awoke the next morning, his mind filled with the
  coming inquiry to the exclusion of all other matters; and although he entered
  Johnson's burglary in his report book very carefully, and locked away the
  cloak-room ticket in his safe, he was much too absorbed and worried to make
  immediate inquiries.</p>

  <p>Dick arrived for the inquiry, and his assistant gave him a brief sketch of
  the burglary in Fitzroy Square.</p>

  <p>"Let me see that ticket," he asked.</p>

  <p>Elk, unlocking the safe, produced the green slip.</p>

  <p>"The ticket has been attached to something," said Dick, carrying the slip
  to the window. "There is the mark of a paper-fastener, and the mark is
  recent. This may produce a little information," he said as he handed it
  back.</p>

  <p>"It's very unlikely," said Elk despondently as he kicked the door of the
  safe. "Those people upstairs are going to give us hell."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry," said Dick. "I tell you, our friends above are so tickled to
  death at recovering the Treaty that they're not going to worry much about
  Hagn."</p>

  <p>It was a remarkable prophecy, remarkably fulfilled. Elk was gratified and
  surprised when he was called into the presence of the great&mdash;every
  Commissioner and Chief Constable sat round the green board of
  judgment&mdash;to discover that the attitude of his superiors was rather one
  of benevolent interest than of disapproval.</p>

  <p>"With an organization of this character we are prepared for very
  unexpected developments," said the Chief Commissioner. "In ordinary
  circumstances, the escape of Hagn would be a matter calling for severe
  measures against those responsible. But I really cannot apportion the blame
  in this particular case. Balder seems to have behaved with perfect propriety;
  I quite approve of your having put him into the cell with Hagn; and I do not
  see what I can do with the gaoler. The truth is, that the Frogs are immensely
  powerful&mdash;more powerful than the agents of an enemy Government, because
  they are working with inside knowledge, and in addition, of course, they are
  our own people. You think it is possible, Captain Gordon, to round up the
  Frogs?&mdash;I know it will be a tremendous business. Is it worth while?"</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," he replied. "They are too numerous, and the really dangerous
  men are going to be difficult to identify. It has come to our knowledge that
  the chiefs of this organization&mdash;at least, some of them&mdash;are not so
  marked."</p>

  <p>Not all the members of the Board of Inquiry were as pleasant as the Chief
  Commissioner.</p>

  <p>"It comes to this," said a white-haired Chief Constable, "that in the
  space of a week we have had two prisoners killed under the eyes of the
  police, and one who has practically walked out of the cell in which he was
  guarded by a police officer, without being arrested or any clue being
  furnished as to the method the Frogs employed." He shook his head. "That's
  bad, Captain Gordon."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you would like to take charge of the inquiry, sir," said Dick.
  "This is not the ordinary petty larceny type of crime, and I seem to remember
  having dealt with a case of yours whilst I was in the Prosecutor's
  Department, presenting less complicated features, in which you were no more
  successful than I and my officers have been in dealing with the Frogs. You
  must allow me the greatest latitude and exercise patience beyond the
  ordinary. I know the Frog," he said simply.</p>

  <p>For some time they did not realize what he had said.</p>

  <p>"You know him?" asked the Chief Commissioner incredulously.</p>

  <p>Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"If I were to tell you who it was," he said, "you would probably laugh at
  me. And obviously, whilst it is quite possible for me to secure an arrest
  this morning, it is not as easy a matter to produce overwhelming evidence
  that will convict. You must give me rope if I am to succeed."</p>

  <p>"But how did you discover him, Captain Gordon?" asked the Chief, and Elk,
  who had listened, dumbfounded, to this claim of his superior, waited
  breathlessly for the reply.</p>

  <p>"It was clear to me," said Dick, speaking slowly and deliberately, "when I
  learnt from Mr. Johnson, who was Maitland's secretary, that somewhere
  concealed in the old man's house was a mysterious child." He smiled as he
  looked at the blank faces of the Board. "That doesn't sound very convincing,
  I'm afraid," he said, "but nevertheless, you will learn in due course why,
  when I discovered this, I was perfectly satisfied that I could take the Frog
  whenever I wished. It is not necessary to say that, knowing as I do, or as I
  am convinced I do, the identity of this individual, events from now on will
  take a more interesting and a more satisfactory course. I do not profess to
  be able to explain how Hagn came to make his escape. I have a
  suspicion&mdash;it is no more than a suspicion&mdash;but even that event is
  soluble if my other theory is right, as I am sure it is."</p>

  <p>Until the meeting was over and the two men were again in Elk's office, the
  detective spoke no word. Then, closing the door carefully, he said:</p>

  <p>"If that was a bluff of yours, Captain Gordon, it was the finest bluff I
  have ever heard, and I've an idea it wasn't a bluff."</p>

  <p>"It was no bluff," said Dick quietly. "I tell you I am satisfied that I
  know the Frog."</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"This isn't the time to tell you. I don't think any useful purpose would
  be served if I made my views known&mdash;even to you. Now what about your
  cloak-room ticket?"</p>

  <p>Dick did not accompany him to King's Cross, for he had some work to do in
  his office, and Elk went alone to the cloakroom. Producing the ticket, he
  paid the extra fees for the additional period of storage, and received from
  the attendant a locked brown leather bag.</p>

  <p>"Now, son," said Elk, having revealed his identity, "perhaps you will tell
  me if you remember who brought this bag?"</p>

  <p>The attendant grinned.</p>

  <p>"I haven't that kind of memory," he said.</p>

  <p>"I sympathize with you," said Elk, "but possibly if you concentrated your
  mind, you might be able to recall something. Faces aren't dates."</p>

  <p>The attendant turned over the leaves of his book to make sure.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was on duty that day."</p>

  <p>"What time was it handed in?"</p>

  <p>He examined the counterfoils.</p>

  <p>"About eleven o'clock in the morning," he said. He shook his head. "I
  can't remember who brought it. We get so much luggage entered at that time in
  the morning that it's almost impossible for me to recall any particular
  person. I know one thing, that there wasn't anything peculiar about him, or I
  should have remembered."</p>

  <p>"You mean that the person who handed this in was very ordinary. Was he an
  American?"</p>

  <p>Again the attendant thought.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think he was an American, sir," he said. "I should have
  remembered that. I don't think we have had an American here for weeks."</p>

  <p>Elk took the bag to the office of the station police inspector, and with
  the aid of his key unlocked and pulled it wide open. Its contents were
  unusual. A suit of clothes, a shirt, collar and tie, a brand-new shaving
  outfit, a small bottle of Annatto, a colouring material used by dairymen, a
  passport made out in the name of "John Henry Smith," but with the photograph
  missing, a Browning pistol, fully loaded, an envelope containing 5,000 francs
  and five one-hundred-dollar bills; these comprised the contents.</p>

  <p>Elk surveyed the articles as they were spread on the inspector's
  table.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of that?"</p>

  <p>The railwayman shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It's a fairly complete outfit," he said.</p>

  <p>"You mean a get-away outfit? That's what I think," said Elk; "and I'd like
  to bet that one of these bags is stored at every railway terminus in
  London!"</p>

  <p>The clothing bore no marks, the Browning was of Belgian manufacture,
  whilst the passport might, or might not, have been forged, though the blank
  on which it was written was obviously genuine. (A later inquiry put through
  to the Foreign Office revealed the fact that it had not been officially
  issued.)</p>

  <p>Elk packed away the outfit into the bag.</p>

  <p>"I shall take these to the Yard. Perhaps they'll be called for&mdash;but
  more likely they won't."</p>

  <p>Elk came out of the Inspector's office on to the broad platform, wondering
  what it would be best to do. Should he leave the bag in the cloak-room and
  set a man to watch?...That would be a little futile, for nobody could call
  unless he had the ticket, and it would mean employing a good officer for
  nothing. He decided in the end to take the bag to the Yard and hand it over
  for a more thorough inspection.</p>

  <p>One of the Northern expresses had just pulled into the station, two hours
  late, due to a breakdown on the line. Elk stood looking idly at the stream of
  passengers passing out through the barrier, and, so watching, he saw a
  familiar face. His mind being occupied with this, the familiarity did not
  force itself upon his attention until the man he had recognized had passed
  out of view. It was John Bennett&mdash;a furtive, hurrying figure, with his
  battered suit-case in his hand, a dark felt hat pulled over his eyes.</p>

  <p>Elk strolled across to the barrier where a station official was
  standing.</p>

  <p>"Where does this train come from?"</p>

  <p>"Aberdeen, sir."</p>

  <p>"Last stop?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>"Last stop Doncaster," said the official.</p>

  <p>Whilst he was speaking, Elk saw Bennett returning. Apparently he had
  forgotten something, for there was a frown of annoyance on his face. He
  pushed his way through the stream of people that were coming from the
  barriers, and Elk wondered what was the cause of his return. He had not long
  to wait before he learnt.</p>

  <p>When Bennett appeared again, he was carrying a heavy brown box, fastened
  with a strap, and Elk recognized the motion-picture camera with which this
  strange man pursued his paying hobby.</p>

  <p>"Queer bird!" said Elk to himself and, calling a cab, carried his find
  back to headquarters.</p>

  <p>He put the bag in his safe, and sent for two of his best men.</p>

  <p>"I want the cloak-rooms of every London terminus inspected for bags of
  this kind," he said, showing the bag. "It has probably been left for weeks.
  Push the usual inquiries as to the party who made the deposit, select all
  likely bags, and, to make sure, have them opened on the spot. If they
  contained a complete shaving kit, a gun, a passport and money, they are to be
  brought to Scotland Yard and held for me."</p>

  <p>Gordon, whom he afterwards saw, agreed with his explanation for the
  presence of this interesting find.</p>

  <p>"At any hour of the day or night he's ready to jump for safety," said Elk
  admiringly; "and at any terminus we shall find money, a change of kit and the
  necessary passport to carry him abroad, Annatto to stain his face and
  hands&mdash;I expect he carries his own photograph. And by the way, I saw
  John Bennett."</p>

  <p>"At the station?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>Elk nodded.</p>

  <p>"He was returning from the north, from one of five towns&mdash;Aberdeen,
  Arbroath, Edinburgh, York or Doncaster. He didn't see me, and I didn't push
  myself forward. Captain, what do you think of this man Bennett?"</p>

  <p>Dick did not reply.</p>

  <p>"Is he your Frog?" challenged Elk, and Dick Gordon chuckled.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to get my Frog by a process of elimination, Elk, and you
  can save yourself a whole lot of trouble if you cut out the idea that
  cross-examining me will produce good results."</p>

  <p>"I never thought anything so silly," said Elk. "But John Bennett gets me
  guessing. If he were the Frog, he couldn't have been in Johnson's
  sitting-room last night."</p>

  <p>"Not unless he motored to Doncaster to catch an alibi train," said Dick,
  and then: "I wonder if the Doncaster police are going to call in
  headquarters, or whether they'll rely upon their own intelligence
  department."</p>

  <p>"About what?" asked Elk surprised.</p>

  <p>"Mabberley Hall, which is just outside Doncaster, was burgled last night,"
  said Dick, "and Lady FitzHerman's diamond tiara was stolen&mdash;rather
  supports your theory, doesn't it, Elk?"</p>

  <p>Elk said nothing, but he wished most fervently that he had some excuse or
  other for searching John Bennett's bag.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap23"
     id="chap23">XXIII. &mdash; A MEETING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Heron's club had been temporarily closed by order of the
  police, but now was allowed to open its doors again. Ray invariably lunched
  at Heron's unless he was taking the meal with Lola, who preferred a brighter
  atmosphere than the club offered at midday.</p>

  <p>Only a few tables were occupied when he arrived. The stigma of the police
  raid lay upon Heron's, and its more cautious clients had not yet begun to
  drift back. It was fairly well known that something had happened to Hagn, the
  manager, for the man had not appeared since the night of the raid. There were
  unconfirmed rumours of his arrest. Ray had not troubled to call for letters
  as he passed through the hall, for very little correspondence came to him at
  the club. He was therefore surprised when the waiter, having taken his order,
  returned, accompanied by the clerk carrying in his hand two letters, one
  heavily sealed and weighty, the other smaller.</p>

  <p>He opened the big envelope first, and was putting in his fingers to
  extract the contents when he realized that the envelope contained nothing but
  money. He did not care to draw out the contents, even before the limited
  public. Peeping, he was gratified to observe the number and denomination of
  the bills. There was no message, but the other letter was addressed in the
  same handwriting. He tore this open. It was innocent of address or date, and
  the typewritten message ran:</p>

  <p>"On Friday morning you will assume a dress which will be sent to you, and
  you will make your way towards Nottingham by road. You will take the name of
  Jim Carter, and papers of identification in that name will be found in the
  pockets of the clothes which will reach you by special messenger to-morrow.
  From now onward you are not to appear in public, you are not to shave,
  receive visitors or pay visits. Your business at Nottingham will be
  communicated to you. Remember that you are to travel by road, sleeping in
  such lodging-houses, casual wards or Salvation Army shelters as tramps
  usually patronize. At Barnet, on the Great North Road, near the ninth
  milestone, you will meet another whom you know, and will accompany him for
  the remainder of the journey. At Nottingham you will receive further orders.
  It is very likely that you will not be required, and certainly, the work you
  will be asked to do will not compromise you in any way. Remember your name is
  Carter. Remember you are not to shave. Remember also the ninth milestone on
  Friday morning. When these facts are impressed upon you, take this letter,
  the envelope, and the envelope containing the money, to the club fire-place,
  and burn them. I shall see you."</p>

  <p>The letter was signed "Frog."</p>

  <p>So the hour had come when the Frogs had need of him. He had dreaded the
  day, and yet in a way had looked forward to it as one who wished to know the
  worst.</p>

  <p>He faithfully carried out the instructions, and, under the curious eyes of
  the guests, carried the letter and the envelopes to the empty brick
  fire-place, lit a match and burnt them, putting his foot upon the ashes.</p>

  <p>His pulse beat a little quicker, the thump of his heart was a little more
  pronounced, as he went back to his untouched lunch. So the Frog would see
  him&mdash;was here! He looked round the sparsely filled tables, and presently
  he met the gaze of a man whose eyes had been fixed upon him ever since he had
  sat down. The face was familiar, and yet unfamiliar. He beckoned the
  waiter.</p>

  <p>"Don't look immediately," he said in a low voice, "but tell me who is that
  gentleman sitting in the second alcove." The waiter looked carelessly
  round.</p>

  <p>"That is Mr. Joshua Broad, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>Almost as the waiter spoke, Joshua Broad rose from his seat, walked across
  the room to where Ray was sitting.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Bennett. I don't think we have met before, though we
  are fellow-members of Heron's and I've seen you a lot of times here. My name
  is Broad."</p>

  <p>"Won't you sit down?" Ray had some difficulty in controlling his voice.
  "Glad to meet you, Mr. Broad. Have you finished your lunch? If not, perhaps
  you'll take it with me."</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "I've finished lunch. I eat very little. But if it doesn't
  annoy you, I'll smoke a cigarette."</p>

  <p>Ray offered his case.</p>

  <p>"I'm a neighbour of a friend of yours," said Broad, choosing a cigarette,
  "Miss Lola Bassano. She has an apartment facing mine in Caverley
  House&mdash;I guess that's where I've seen you most often."</p>

  <p>Now Ray remembered. This was the strange American who lived opposite to
  Lola, and about whose business he had so often heard Lola and Lew Brady
  speculate.</p>

  <p>"And I think we have a mutual friend in&mdash;Captain Gordon," suggested
  the other, his keen eyes fixed upon the boy.</p>

  <p>"Captain Gordon is not a friend of mine," said Ray quickly. "I'm not
  particularly keen on police folk as friends."</p>

  <p>"They can be mighty interesting," said Broad, "but I can quite understand
  your feeling in the matter. Have you known Brady long?"</p>

  <p>"Lew? No, I can't say that I have. He's a very nice fellow," said Ray
  unenthusiastically. "He's not exactly the kind of friend I'd have chosen, but
  it happens that he is a particularly close friend of a friend of mine.</p>

  <p>"Of Miss Bassano," said Broad. "You used to be at Maitlands?"</p>

  <p>"I was there once," said Ray indifferently, and from his tone one might
  have imagined that he had merely been a visitor attracted by morbid curiosity
  to that establishment.</p>

  <p>"Queer cuss, old Maitland."</p>

  <p>"I know very little of him," said Ray.</p>

  <p>"A very queer fellow. He's got a smart secretary, though."</p>

  <p>"You mean Johnson?" Ray smiled. "Poor old Philosopher, he's lost his
  job!"</p>

  <p>"You don't say? When did this happen?" Mr. Broad's voice was urgent,
  eager.</p>

  <p>"The other day&mdash;I don't know when. I met Johnson this morning and he
  told me. I don't know how the old boy will get on without Philo."</p>

  <p>"I was wondering the same thing," said Broad softly. "You surprise me. I
  wonder he has the nerve, though I don't think he's lacking in that
  quality."</p>

  <p>"The nerve?" said the puzzled Ray. "I don't think it requires much nerve
  to fire a secretary."</p>

  <p>A fleeting smile played on the hard face of the American.</p>

  <p>"By that I meant that it requires nerve for a man of Maitland's character
  to dismiss a man who must share a fair number of his secrets. Not that I
  should imagine there would be any great confidence between these two. What is
  Johnson doing?"</p>

  <p>"He's looking for a job, I think," said Ray. He was getting a little
  irritated by the persistence of the stranger's questions. He had a feeling
  that he was being "pumped." Possibly Mr. Broad sensed this suspicion, for he
  dropped his flow of interrogations and switched to the police raid, a
  prolific source of discussion amongst the members of Heron's.</p>

  <p>Ray looked after him as he walked out a little later and was puzzled. Why
  was he so keen on knowing all these things? Was he testing him? He was glad
  to be alone to consider this extraordinary commission which had come to him.
  The adventure of it, the disguise of it, all were particularly appealing to a
  romantic young man; and Ray Bennett lacked nothing in the matter of romance.
  There was a certain delightful suggestion of danger, a hint almost as
  thrilling of lawlessness, in these instructions. What might be the end of the
  adventure, he did not trouble to consider. It was well for his peace of mind
  that he was no seer; for, if he had been, he would have flown that very
  moment, seeking for some desolate place, some hole in the ground where he
  could lie and shiver and hide.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap24"
     id="chap24">XXIV. &mdash; WHY MAITLAND CAME</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Ella Bennett was cooking the dinner when her father came in,
  depositing his heavy camera on the floor of the sitting-room, but carrying,
  as was usual, his grip to the bedroom. She heard the closing of the cupboard
  door and the turning of the lock, but had long ceased to wonder why he
  invariably kept his bag locked in that cupboard. He was looking very tired
  and old; there were deeper lines under his eyes, and the pallor of his cheeks
  was even more pronounced.</p>

  <p>"Did you have a good time, father?" she asked. It was the invariable
  question, and invariably John Bennett made no other reply than a nod.</p>

  <p>"I nearly lost my camera this morning&mdash;forgot it," he said. "It was
  quite a success&mdash;taking the camera away with me&mdash;but I must get
  used to remembering that I have it. I found a stretch of country full of wild
  fowl, and got some really good pictures. Round about Horsham my opportunities
  are limited, and I think I shall take the machine with me wherever I go."</p>

  <p>He seated himself in the old chair by the fireplace and was filling his
  pipe slowly.</p>

  <p>"I saw Elk on the platform at King's Cross," he said. "I suppose he was
  looking for somebody."</p>

  <p>"What time did you leave where you were?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Last night," he replied briefly, but did not volunteer any further
  information about his movements.</p>

  <p>She was in and out of the kitchen, laying the table, and she did not speak
  to him on the matter which was near her heart, until he had drawn up his
  chair, and then:</p>

  <p>"I had a letter from Ray this morning, father," she said. It was the first
  time she had mentioned the boy's name since that night of horrible memories
  at Heron's Club.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" he answered, without looking up from his plate.</p>

  <p>"He wanted to know if you had his letter."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I had his letter," said John Bennett, "but I didn't answer it. If
  Ray wants to see me, he knows where I am. Did you hear from anybody else?" he
  asked, with surprising calm.</p>

  <p>She had been dreading what might follow the mention of Ray's name.</p>

  <p>"I heard from Mr. Johnson. He has left Maitlands."</p>

  <p>Bennett finished his glass of water and set it down before he replied.</p>

  <p>"He had a good job, too. I'm sorry. I suppose he couldn't get on with the
  old man."</p>

  <p>Should she tell him? she wondered again. She had been debating the
  advisability of taking her father into her confidence ever since&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Father, I've met Mr. Maitland," she said.</p>

  <p>"I know. You saw him at his office; you told me."</p>

  <p>"I've met him since. You remember the morning I was out, when Captain
  Gordon came&mdash;the morning I went to the wood? I went to see Mr.
  Maitland."</p>

  <p>He put down his knife and fork and stared at her incredulously.</p>

  <p>"But why on earth did you see him at that hour of the morning? Had you
  made arrangements to meet him?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't any idea that I was going to see him," she said, "but that night
  I was wakened by somebody throwing a stone at the window. I thought it was
  Ray, who had come back late. That was his habit; I never told you, but
  sometimes he was very late indeed, and he used to wake me that way. It was
  just dawn, and when I looked out, to my astonishment, I saw Mr. Maitland. He
  asked me to come down in that queerly abrupt way of his, and, thinking it had
  something to do with Ray, I dressed and went out into the garden, not daring
  to wake you. 'We walked up the road to where his car was. It was the queerest
  interview you could imagine, because he said&mdash;nothing."</p>

  <p>"Nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he asked me if I'd be his friend. If it had been anybody else but
  Mr. Maitland, I should have been frightened. But he was so pathetic, so very
  old, so appealing. He kept saying 'I'll tell you something, miss,' but every
  time he spoke he looked round with a frightened air. 'Let's go where we can't
  be seen,' he said, and begged me to step into the car. Of course I refused,
  until I discovered that the chauffeur was a woman&mdash;a very old woman, his
  sister. It was a most extraordinary experience. I think she must be nearly
  seventy, but during the war she learnt to drive a motor-car, and apparently
  she was wearing one of the chauffeur's coats, and a more ludicrous sight you
  could not imagine, once you realized that she was a woman.</p>

  <p>"I let him drive me down to the wood, and then: 'Is it about Ray?' I
  asked. But it wasn't about Ray at all that he wanted to speak. He was so
  incoherent, so strange, that I really did get nervous. And then, when he had
  begun to compose himself and had even made a few connected remarks, you came
  along in Mr. Elk's car. He was terrified and was shaking from head to foot!
  He begged me to go away, and almost went on his knees to implore me not to
  say that I had seen him."</p>

  <p>"Phew!" John Bennett pushed back his chair. "And you learnt nothing?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He came again last night," she said, "but this time I did not go out, and
  he refused to come in. He struck me as a man who was expecting to be
  trapped."</p>

  <p>"Did he give you any idea of what he wanted to say?"</p>

  <p>"No, but it was something which was vitally important to him, I think. I
  couldn't understand half that he said. He spoke in loud whispers, and I've
  told you how harsh his voice is."</p>

  <p>Bennett relit his pipe, and sat for a while with downcast eyes, revolving
  the matter in his mind.</p>

  <p>"The next time he comes you'd better let me see him," he said.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so, daddy," she answered quietly. "If he has anything very
  important to say, I think I ought to know what it is. I have a feeling that
  he is asking for help."</p>

  <p>John Bennett looked up.</p>

  <p>"A millionaire asking for help? Ella, that sounds queer to me."</p>

  <p>"And it <i>is</i> queer," she insisted. "He didn't seem half so terrible
  as he appeared when I first saw him. There was something tragic about him,
  something very sad. He will come to-night, and I've promised to see him. May
  I?"</p>

  <p>Her father considered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you may see him, provided you do not go outside this garden. I
  promise that I will not appear, but I shall be on hand. Do you think it is
  about Ray&mdash;that Ray has committed some act of folly that he wants to
  tell you about?" he asked with a note of anxiety.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so, daddy. Maitland was quite indifferent to Ray or what
  becomes of him. I've been wondering whether I ought to tell somebody."</p>

  <p>"Captain Gordon or Mr. Elk," suggested her father dryly, and the girl
  flushed. "You like that young man, Ella? No, I'm not referring to Elk, who is
  anything but young; I mean Dick Gordon."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said after a pause, "I like him very much."</p>

  <p>"I hope you aren't going to like him too much, darling," said John
  Bennett, and their eyes met.</p>

  <p>"Why not, daddy?" It almost hurt her to ask.</p>

  <p>"Because,"&mdash;he seemed at a loss as to how he should proceed&mdash;
  "because it's not desirable. He occupies a different position from ourselves,
  but that isn't the only reason. I don't want you to have a heartache, and I
  say this, knowing that, if that heartache comes, I shall be the cause."</p>

  <p>He saw her face change, and then:</p>

  <p>"What do you wish me to do?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He rose slowly, and, walking to her, put his arm about her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Do whatever you like, Ella," he said gently. "There is a curse upon me,
  and you must suffer for my sin. Perhaps he will never know&mdash;but I am
  tired of expecting miracles."</p>

  <p>"Father, what do you mean?" she asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what I mean," he said as he patted her shoulder. "Things may
  work out as they do in stories. Perhaps..." He ruminated for a while. "Those
  pictures I took yesterday may be the making of me, Ella. But I've thought
  that of so many things. Always there seems to be a great possibility opening
  out, and always I have been disappointed. But I'm getting the knack of this
  picture taking. The apparatus is working splendidly, and the man who buys
  them&mdash;he has a shop in Wardour Street&mdash;told me that the quality of
  the films is improving with every new 'shot.' I took a mother duck on the
  nest, just as the youngsters were hatching out. I'm not quite sure how the
  picture will develop, because I had to be at some distance from the nest. As
  it was, I nearly scared the poor lady when I fixed the camera."</p>

  <p>Very wisely she did not pursue a subject which was painful to her.</p>

  <p>That afternoon she saw a strange man standing in the roadway opposite the
  gate, looking toward the house. He was a gentleman, well dressed, and he was
  smoking a long cigar. She thought, by his shell glasses, that he might be an
  American, and when he spoke to her, his New England accent left no doubt. He
  came toward the gate, hat in hand.</p>

  <p>"Am I right in thinking that I'm speaking to Miss Bennett?" he asked, and
  when she nodded: "My name is Broad. I was just taking a look round, and I
  seemed to remember that you lived somewhere in the neighbourhood. In fact, I
  think your brother told me to-day."</p>

  <p>"Are you a friend of Ray?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, no," said Broad with a smile. "I can't say that I'm a friend of Mr.
  Bennett; I'm what you might call a club acquaintance."</p>

  <p>He made no attempt to approach her any closer, and apparently he did not
  expect to be invited into the house on the strength of his acquaintance with
  Ray Bennett. Presently, with a commonplace remark about the weather (he had
  caught the English habit perfectly) he moved off, and from the gate she saw
  him walking up towards the wood road. That long <i>cul-de-sac</i> was a
  favourite parking place of motorists who came to the neighbourhood, and she
  was not surprised when, a few minutes later, she saw the car come out. Mr.
  Broad raised his hat as he passed, and waved a little greeting to some person
  who was invisible to her. Her curiosity whetted, she opened the gate and
  walked on to the road. A little way down, a man was sitting on a tree trunk,
  reading a newspaper and smoking a large-bowled pipe. An hour later, when she
  came out, he was still there, but this time he was standing: a tall,
  soldier-like-looking man, who turned his head away when she looked in his
  direction. A detective, she thought, in dismay.</p>

  <p>Her instinct was not at fault: of that she was sure. For some reason or
  other, Maytree Cottage was under observation. At first she was frightened,
  then indignant. She had half a mind to go into the village and telephone to
  Elk, to demand an explanation. Somehow it never occurred to her to be angry
  with Dick, though he was solely responsible for placing the men who were
  guarding her day and night.</p>

  <p>She went to bed early, setting her alarm for three o'clock. She woke
  before the bell roused her, and, dressing quickly, went down to make some
  coffee. As she passed her father's door, he called her.</p>

  <p>"I'm up, if you want me, Ella."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, daddy," she said gratefully. She was glad to know that he was
  around. It gave her a feeling of confidence which she had never before
  possessed in the presence of this old man.</p>

  <p>The first light was showing in the sky when she saw the silhouette of Mr.
  Maitland against the dawn, and heard the soft click of the latch as he opened
  the garden gate. She had not heard the car nor seen it. This time Maitland
  had alighted some distance short of the house.</p>

  <p>He was, as usual, nervous and for the time being speechless. A heavy
  overcoat, which had seen its best days, was buttoned up to his neck, and a
  big cap covered his hairless head.</p>

  <p>"That you, miss?" he asked in a husky whisper.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Maitland."</p>

  <p>"You coming along for a little walk?...Got something to tell you...Very
  important, miss."</p>

  <p>"We will walk in the garden," she said, lowering her voice.</p>

  <p>He demurred.</p>

  <p>"Suppose anybody sees us, eh? That'd be a fine lookout for me! Just a
  little way up the road, miss," he pleaded. "Nobody will hear us."</p>

  <p>"We can go on to the lawn. There are some chairs there."</p>

  <p>"Is everybody asleep? All your servant gels?"</p>

  <p>"We have no servant girls," she smiled.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't blame you I hate 'um. Got six fellows in uniform at my house.
  They frighten me stiff!"</p>

  <p>She led him across the lawn, carrying a cushion, and, settling him in a
  chair, waited. The beginnings of these interviews had always seemed as
  promising, but after a while Mr. Maitland had a trick of rambling off at a
  tangent into depths which she could not plumb.</p>

  <p>"You're a nice gel," said Maitland huskily. "I thought so the first time I
  saw you...you wouldn't do a poor old man any 'arm, would you, miss?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course not, Mr. Maitland."</p>

  <p>"I know you wouldn't. I told Matilda you wouldn't. She says you're all
  right...Ever been in the workhouse, miss?</p>

  <p>"In the poorhouse?" she said, smiling in spite of herself. "Why, no, I've
  never been in a poorhouse."</p>

  <p>He looked round fearfully from side to side, peering under his white
  eyebrows at a clump of bushes which might conceal an eavesdropper.</p>

  <p>"Ever been in quod?"</p>

  <p>She did not recognize the word.</p>

  <p>"I have," he went on. "Quod's prison, miss. Naturally you wouldn't
  understand them words."</p>

  <p>Again he looked round.</p>

  <p>"Suppose you was me...It all comes to that question&mdash;suppose you was
  me!"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't understand, Mr. Maitland."</p>

  <p>She watched his frightened scrutiny of the grounds, and then he bent over
  toward her.</p>

  <p>"Them fellows will get me," he said slowly and impressively. "They'll get
  me, <i>and</i> Matilda. And I've left all my money to a certain person.
  That's the joke. That's the whole joke of it, miss." He chuckled wheezily.
  "And then they'll get him."</p>

  <p>He slapped his knee, convulsed with silent laughter, and the girl honestly
  thought he was mad and edged away from him.</p>

  <p>"But I've got a great idea&mdash;got it when I saw you. It's one of the
  greatest ideas I've ever had, miss. Are you a typewriter?"</p>

  <p>"A typist?" she smiled. "No, I can type, but I'm not a very good
  typist."</p>

  <p>His voice sank until it was almost unintelligible.</p>

  <p>"You come up to my office one day, and we'll have a great joke. Wouldn't
  think I was a joker, would yon? Eighty-seven I am, miss. You come up to my
  office and I'll make you laugh!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he became more serious.</p>

  <p>"They'll get me&mdash;I know it. I haven't told Matilda, because she'd
  start screaming. But <i>I</i> know. <i>And</i> the baby!"</p>

  <p>This seemed to afford the saturnine old man the greatest possible
  enjoyment. He rocked from side to side with mirth, until a fit of coughing
  attacked him.</p>

  <p>"That's all, miss. You come up to my office. Old Johnson isn't there. You
  come up and see me. Never had a letter from me, have you?" he suddenly asked,
  as he rose.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Maitland," she said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"There was one wrote," said he. "Maybe I didn't post it. Maybe I thought
  better. I dunno."</p>

  <p>He started and drew back as a figure appeared before the house.</p>

  <p>"Who's that?" he asked, and she felt a hand on her arm that trembled.</p>

  <p>"That is my father, Mr. Maitland," she said. "I expect he got a little
  nervous about my being out."</p>

  <p>"Your father, eh?" He was more relieved than resentful. "Mr. John Bennett,
  his name is, by all accounts. Don't tell him I've been in the workhouse," he
  urged, "or in quod. And I have been in quod, miss. Met all the big men, every
  one of 'um. And met a few of 'um out, too. I bet I'm the only man in this
  country that's ever seen Saul Morris, the grandest feller in the business.
  Only met him once, but I shall never forget him."</p>

  <p>John Bennett saw them pacing toward him, and stood undecided as to whether
  he should join them or whether Ella would be embarrassed by such a move.
  Maitland decided the matter by hobbling over to him.</p>

  <p>"Morning, mister," he said. "Just having a talk to your gel. Rather early
  in the morning, eh? Hope you don't mind, Mr. Bennett."</p>

  <p>"I don't mind," said John Bennett. "Won't you come inside, Mr.
  Maitland?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, no," said the other fearfully. "I've got to get on. Matilda will
  be waiting for me. Don't forget, miss: come up to my office and have that
  joke!"</p>

  <p>He did not offer to shake hands, nor did he take off his hat. In fact, his
  manners were deplorable. A curt nod to the girl, and then:</p>

  <p>"Well, so long, mister&mdash;-" he began, and at that moment John Bennett
  moved out from the shadow of the house.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Mr. Maitland," he said.</p>

  <p>Maitland did not speak. His eyes were open wide with terror, his face
  blanched to the colour of death.</p>

  <p>"You...you!" he croaked. "Oh, my God!"</p>

  <p>He seemed to totter, and the girl sprang to catch him, but he recovered
  himself, and, turning, ran down the path with an agility which was surprising
  in one of his age, tore open the gate and flew along the road. They heard his
  dry sobs coming back to them.</p>

  <p>"Father," whispered the girl in fear, "did he know you? Did he recognize
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said John Bennett of Horsham.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap25"
     id="chap25">XXV. &mdash; IN REGARD TO SAUL MORRIS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dick Gordon 'phoned across to headquarters, and Elk reported
  immediately.</p>

  <p>"I've discovered six good get-away bags, and each one is equipped as
  completely and exactly as the one we found at King's Cross."</p>

  <p>"No clue as to the gentleman who deposited them?</p>

  <p>"No, sir, not so much as a clue. We've tested them all for finger-prints,
  and we've got a few results; but as they have been handled by half a dozen
  attendants, I don't think we shall get much out of it. Still, we can but
  try."</p>

  <p>"Elk, I would give a few years of my life to get to the inside of this
  Frog mystery. I'm having Lola shadowed, though I shouldn't think she'd be in
  that lot. I know of nobody who looks less like a tramp than Lola Bassano! Lew
  has disappeared, and when I sent a man round this morning to discover what
  had happened to that young man about town, Mr. Raymond Bennett, he was not
  visible. He refused to see the caller on the plea that he was ill, and is
  staying in his room all day. Elk, who's the Frog?"</p>

  <p>Elk paced up and down the apartment, his hands in his pockets, his
  steel-rimmed spectacles sliding lower and lower down his long nose.</p>

  <p>"There are only two possibilities," he said. "One is Harry Lyme&mdash;an
  ex-convict who was supposed to have been drowned in the <i>Channel Queen</i>
  some years ago. I put him amongst them, because all the records we have of
  him show that he was a brilliant organizer, a super-crook, and one of the two
  men capable of opening Lord Farmley's safe and slipping that patent catch on
  Johnson's window. And believe me, Captain Gordon, it was an artist who
  burgled Johnson!"</p>

  <p>"The other man?" said Dick.</p>

  <p>"He's also comfortably dead," said Elk grimly. "Saul Morris, the cleverest
  of all. He's got Lyme skinned to death&mdash;an expression I picked up in my
  recent travels, Captain. And Morris is American; and although I'm as
  patriotic as any man in this country, I hand it to the Americans when it
  comes to smashing safes. I've examined two thousand records of known
  criminals, and I've fined it down to these two fellows&mdash;and they're both
  dead! They say that dead men leave no trails, and if Frog is Morris or Lyme,
  they're about right. Lyme's dead&mdash;drowned. Morris was killed in a
  railway accident in the United States. The question is, which of the ghosts
  we can charge."</p>

  <p>Dick Gordon pulled open the drawer of his desk and took out an envelope
  that bore the inscription of the Western Union. He threw it across the
  table.</p>

  <p>"What's this, Captain Gordon?"</p>

  <p>"It's an answer to a question. You mentioned Saul Morris before, and I
  have been making inquiries in New York. Here's the reply."</p>

  <p>The cablegram was from the Chief of Police, New York City.</p>

  <p>"Answering your inquiry. Saul Morris is alive, and is believed to be in
  England at this moment. No charges pending against him here, but generally
  supposed to be the man who cleared out strong room of s.s. <i>Mantania</i>,
  February 17, 1898, Southampton, England, and got away with 55,000,000 francs.
  Acknowledge."</p>

  <p>Elk read and re-read the cablegram, then he folded it carefully, put it
  back in its envelope and passed it across the table.</p>

  <p>"Saul Morris is in England." he said mechanically. "That seems to explain
  a whole lot."</p>

  <p>The search which detectives had conducted at the railway termini had
  produced nine bags, all of which contained identical outfits. In every case
  there was a spare suit, a clean shirt, two collars, one tie, a Browning
  pistol with cartridges, a forged passport without photograph, the Annatio and
  money. Only in one respect did the grips differ. At Paddington the police had
  recovered one which was a little larger than its fellows, all of which were
  of the same pattern and size. This held the same outfit as the remainder,
  with the exception that, in addition, there was a thick pad of cheque forms,
  every cheque representing a different branch of a different bank. There were
  cheques upon the Credit Lyonnais, upon the Ninth National Bank of New York,
  upon the Burrowstown Trust, upon the Bank of Spain, the Banks of Italy and
  Roumania, in addition to about fifty branches of the five principal banks of
  England. Occupied as he had been, Elk had not had time to make a very close
  inspection, but in the morning he determined to deal seriously with the
  cheques. He was satisfied that inquiries made at the banks and branches would
  reveal different depositors; but the numbers might enable him to bring the
  ownership home to one man or one group of men.</p>

  <p>As the bags were brought in, they had been examined superficially and
  placed in Elk's safe, and to accommodate them, the ordinary contents of the
  safe had been taken out and placed in other repositories. Each bag had been
  numbered and labelled with the name of the station from whence it was taken,
  the name of the officer who had brought it in, and particulars of its
  contents. These facts are important, as having a bearing upon what
  subsequently happened.</p>

  <p>Elk arrived at his office soon after ten o'clock, having enjoyed the first
  full night's sleep he had had for weeks. He had, as his assistants, Balder
  and a detective-sergeant named Fayre, a promising young man, in whom Elk
  placed considerable trust. Dick Gordon arrived almost simultaneously with the
  detective chief, and they went into the building together.</p>

  <p>"There isn't the ghost of a chance that we shall be rewarded for the
  trouble we've taken to trace these cheques," said Elk, "and I am inclined to
  place more hope upon the possibility of the handbags yielding a few items
  which were not apparent at first examination. All these bags are lined, and
  there is a possibility that they have false bottoms. I am going to cut them
  up thoroughly, and if there's anything left after I'm through, the Frogs are
  welcome to their secret."</p>

  <p>In the office, Balder and the detective-sergeant were waiting, and Elk
  searched for his key. The production of the key of the safe was invariably
  something of a ritual where Elk was concerned. He gave Dick Gordon the
  impression that he was preparing to disrobe, for the key reposed in some
  mysterious region which involved the loosening of coat, waistcoat, and the
  diving into a pocket where no pocket should be. Presently the ceremony was
  through, Elk solemnly inserted the key and swung back the door.</p>

  <p>The safe was so packed with bags that they began to slide toward him, when
  the restraining pressure of the door was removed. One by one he handed them
  out, and Fayre put them on the table.</p>

  <p>"We'll take that Paddington one first," said Elk, pointing to the largest
  of the bags. "And get me that other knife, Balder."</p>

  <p>The two men walked out into the passage, leaving Fayre alone.</p>

  <p>"Can you see the end of this, Captain Gordon?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>"The end of the Frogs? Why, yes, I think I can. I could almost say I was
  sure."</p>

  <p>They had reached the door of the clerk's office and found Balder holding a
  murderous looking weapon in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Here it is&mdash;" he began, and the next instant Dick was flung
  violently to the floor, with Elk on top of him.</p>

  <p>There was the shrill shriek of smashed glass, a pressure of wind, and,
  through all this violence, the deafening thunder of an explosion.</p>

  <p>Elk was first to his feet and flew back to his room. The door hung on its
  hinges; every pane of glass was gone, and the sashes with them. From his room
  poured a dense volume of smoke, into which he plunged. He had hardly taken a
  step before he tripped on the prostrate figure of Fayre, and, stooping, he
  half-lifted and half-dragged him into the corridor. One glance was sufficient
  to show that, if the man was not dead, there seemed little hope of his
  recovery. The fire-bells were ringing throughout the building. A swift rush
  of feet on the stairs, and the fire squad came pelting down the corridor,
  dragging their hose behind them.</p>

  <p>What fire there was, was soon extinguished, but Elk's office was a wreck.
  Even the door of the safe had been blown from its hinges. There was not a
  single article of furniture left, and a big hole gaped in the floor.</p>

  <p>"Save those bags," said Elk and went back to look after the injured man,
  and not until he had seen his assistant placed in the ambulance did he return
  to a contemplation of the ruin which the bomb had made.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, it was a bomb, sir," said Elk.</p>

  <p>A group of senior officers stood in the corridor, looking at the
  havoc.</p>

  <p>"And something particularly heavy in the shape of bombs. The wonder is
  that Captain Gordon and I were not there. I told Fayre to open the bag, but I
  thought he'd wait until we returned with the knife&mdash;we intended
  examining the lining. Fayre must have opened the bag and the bomb
  exploded."</p>

  <p>"But weren't the bags examined before?" asked the Commissioner
  wrathfully.</p>

  <p>Elk nodded.</p>

  <p>"They were examined by me yesterday&mdash;every one. The Paddington bag
  was turned inside out, every article it contained was placed on my table, and
  catalogued. I myself returned them. There was no bomb."</p>

  <p>"But how could they be got at?" asked the other.</p>

  <p>Elk shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir. The only other person who has a key to this safe is
  the Assistant Commissioner of my department, Colonel McClintock, who is on
  his holidays. We might all have been killed."</p>

  <p>"What was the explosive?"</p>

  <p>"Dynamite," said Elk promptly. "It blew down." He pointed to the hole in
  the floor. "Nitro-glycerine blows up and sideways," he sniffed. "There's no
  doubt about it being dynamite."</p>

  <p>In his search of the office he found a twisted coil of thin steel, later
  the blackened and crumpled face of a cheap alarm clock.</p>

  <p>"Both time and contact," he said. "Those Frogs are taking no chances."</p>

  <p>He shifted such of his belongings as he could discover into Balder's
  office.</p>

  <p>There was little chance that this outrage would be kept from the
  newspapers. The explosion had blown out the window and a portion of the
  brickwork and had attracted a crowd on the Embankment outside. Indeed, when
  Elk left headquarters, he was confronted by newspaper bills telling of the
  event.</p>

  <p>His first call was at the near-by hospital, to where the unfortunate Fayre
  had been taken, and the news he received was encouraging. The doctors thought
  that, with any kind of luck, they would not only save the man's life, but
  also save him from any serious mutilation.</p>

  <p>"He may lose a finger or two, and he's had a most amazing escape," said
  the house surgeon. "I can't understand why he wasn't blown to pieces."</p>

  <p>"What I can't understand," said Elk emphatically, "is why <i>I</i> wasn't
  blown to pieces."</p>

  <p>The surgeon nodded.</p>

  <p>"These high explosives play curious tricks," said the surgeon. "I
  understand that the force of the explosion blew off the door of the safe, and
  yet this paper, which must also have been within range, is scarcely
  singed."</p>

  <p>He took a square of paper out of his pocket; the edges were blackened; one
  corner had been burnt off.</p>

  <p>"I found this in his clothing. It must have been driven there when the
  bomb detonated," said the surgeon.</p>

  <p>Elk smoothed out the paper and read:</p>

  <p><i>"With the compliments of Number Seven.</i>"</p>

  <p>Carefully he folded the paper.</p>

  <p>"I'll take this," he said, and put it tenderly away in the interior of his
  spectacle case. "Do you believe in hunches, doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean premonitions?" smiled the surgeon. "To an extent I do."</p>

  <p>Elk nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have a hunch that I'm going to meet Number Seven&mdash;very shortly,"
  he said.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap26"
     id="chap26">XXVI. &mdash; PROMOTION FOR BALDER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A week had passed, and the explosion at headquarters was
  ancient history. The injured detective was making fair progress toward
  recovery, and in some respects the situation was stagnant.</p>

  <p>Elk apparently accepted failure as an inevitability, and seemed, even to
  his greatest admirer, to be hypnotized into a fatalistic acceptance of the
  situation. His attitude was a little deceptive. On the sixth day following
  the explosion, headquarters made a raid upon the cloak-rooms, and again, as
  Elk had expected, produced from every single terminus parcels office, a
  brand-new bag with exactly the same equipment as the others had had, except
  that the Paddington find differed from none of its fellows.</p>

  <p>The bags were opened by an Inspector of Explosives, after very careful
  preliminary tests; but they contained nothing more deadly than the Belgian
  pistols and the self-same passports, this time made out in the name of
  "Clarence Fielding."</p>

  <p>"These fellows are certainly thorough," said Elk with reluctant
  admiration, surveying his haul.</p>

  <p>"Are you keeping the bags in your office?" asked Dick, but Elk shook his
  melancholy head.</p>

  <p>"I think not," said he.</p>

  <p>He had had the bags immediately emptied, their contents sent to the
  Research Department; the bags themselves were now stripped of leather and
  steel frames, for they had been scientifically sliced, inch by inch.</p>

  <p>"My own opinion," said Balder oracularly, "is that there's somebody at
  police headquarters who is working against us. I've been considering it for a
  long time, and after consulting my wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You haven't consulted your children, too, have you?" asked Elk
  unpleasantly. "The less you talk about headquarters' affairs in your domestic
  circle, the better will be your chance of promotion."</p>

  <p>Mr. Balder sniffed.</p>

  <p>"There's no fear of that, anyway," he said sourly. "I've got myself in
  their bad books. And I did think there was a chance for me&mdash;it all comes
  of your putting me in with Hagn."</p>

  <p>"You're an ungrateful devil," said Elk.</p>

  <p>"Who's this Number Seven, sir?" asked Balder. "Thinking the matter over,
  and having discussed it with my wife, I've come to the conclusion that he's
  one of the most important Frogs, and if we could only get him, we'd be a long
  way towards catching the big fellow."</p>

  <p>Elk put down his pen&mdash;he was writing his report at the time&mdash;and
  favoured his subordinate with a patient and weary smile.</p>

  <p>"You ought to have gone into politics," he said, and waved his subordinate
  from the room with the end of his penholder.</p>

  <p>He had finished his report and was reading it over with a critical eye,
  when the service 'phone announced a visitor.</p>

  <p>"Send him up," said Elk when he had heard the name. He rang his bell for
  Balder. "This report goes to Captain Gordon to initial," he said, and as he
  put down the envelope, Joshua Broad stood in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Elk." He nodded to Balder, although he had never met
  him. "Good morning," he said.</p>

  <p>"Good morning," said Elk. "Come right in and sit down, Mr. Broad. To what
  do I owe the pleasure of this call?&mdash;excuse my politeness, but in the
  early morning I'm that way. All right, Balder, you can go."</p>

  <p>Broad offered his cigar-case to the detective. "I've come on a curious
  errand," he said.</p>

  <p>"Nobody ever comes to headquarters on any other," replied Elk.</p>

  <p>"It concerns a neighbour of mine."</p>

  <p>"Lola Bassano?"</p>

  <p>"Her husband," said the other, "Lew Brady."</p>

  <p>Elk pushed up his spectacles.</p>

  <p>"You don't tell me that she's properly married to Lew Brady?" he asked in
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"I don't think there's any doubt about that," said Broad, "though I'm
  perfectly certain that her young friend Bennett is not aware of the fact.
  Brady has been staying at Caverley House for a week, and during that time he
  has not gone out of doors. What is more, the boy hasn't called; I don't think
  there's a quarrel&mdash;I have a notion there's something much deeper than
  that. I saw Brady by accident as I was coming out of my door. Bassano's door
  also happened to be open: the maid was taking in the milk: and I caught a
  glimpse of him. He has the finest crop of whiskers I've seen on a retired
  pugilist and their ambitions do not as a rule run to hair! That made me
  pretty curious," he said, carefully knocking the ash of his cigar into a tray
  that was on the table, "and I wondered if there was any connection between
  this sudden defiance of the barber and Ray Bennett's actions. I made a call
  on him&mdash;I met him the other day at the club and had, as an excuse, the
  fact that I have also managed to meet Miss Ella Bennett. His servant&mdash;he
  has a man in by the day to brush his clothes and tidy up the place&mdash;told
  me that he was not well and was not visible."</p>

  <p>Mr. Broad blew out a ring of smoke and watched it thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"If you want a servant to be faithful, he must live on the premises," he
  said. "These occasional men aren't with you long enough to get trustworthy.
  It cost me, at the present rate of exchange, two dollars and thirty-five
  cents to discover that Mr. Ray Bennett is also in the hair-restoring
  business. If there were an election on, these two fellows might be political
  cranks who had vowed a vow that they wouldn't touch their razors until their
  party was returned to power. And if Lew Brady were a real sportsman, I should
  guess that they were doing this for a bet. As it is, I'm rather
  intrigued."</p>

  <p>Elk rolled his cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other.</p>

  <p>"I'm not well acquainted with the Statute Book," he said, "but I'm under
  the impression there is no law preventing people from cultivating
  undergrowth. The&mdash;what's the word?&mdash;psych&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Psychology," suggested Mr. Broad.</p>

  <p>"That's it. The psychology of whiskers has never quite reached me. You're
  American, aren't you, Mr. Broad?"</p>

  <p>"I have the distinction," said the other with that half-smile that came so
  readily to his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Elk absently, as he stared through the window. "Ever heard of a
  man called Saul Morris?"</p>

  <p>He brought his eyes back to the other's face. Mr. Joshua Broad was
  frowning in an effort of thought.</p>

  <p>"I seem to remember the name. He was a criminal of sorts, wasn't he&mdash;
  an American criminal, if I remember rightly? Yes, I've heard of him. I seem
  to remember that he was killed a few years ago."</p>

  <p>Elk scratched his chin irritably.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to meet somebody who was at his funeral," he said, "somebody I
  could believe on oath."</p>

  <p>"You're not suggesting that Lew Brady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. I'm not suggesting anything about Lew Brady, except that he's a very
  poor boxer. I'll look into this distressing whisker competition, Mr. Broad,
  and thank you for telling me."</p>

  <p>He wasn't especially interested in the eccentric toilet of Ray Bennett. At
  five o'clock Balder came to him and asked if he might go home.</p>

  <p>"I promised my wife&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Keep it," said Elk.</p>

  <p>After his subordinate's departure there came an official letter to
  Inspector Elk, and, reading its contents, Mr. Elk beamed. It was a letter
  from the Superintendent who controlled the official careers of police
  officers at headquarters.</p>

  <p>"Sir," it ran, "I am directed by the Chief Commissioner of Police to
  inform you that the promotion of Police-Constable J. J. Balder to the rank of
  Acting-Sergeant has been approved, The appointment will date as from the 1st
  May."</p>

  <p>Elk folded up the paper and was genuinely pleased. He rang the bell for
  Balder before he remembered that he had sent his assistant home. Elk's
  evening was free, and in the kindness of his heart he decided upon conveying
  the news personally.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see this wife of his," said Elk, addressing nobody, "and the
  children!"</p>

  <p>Elk turned up the official pass register, and found that Balder lived at
  93, Leaford Road, Uxbridge. The names of his wife and children were not
  entered, to Elk's disappointment. He would like to have addressed the latter
  personally, but no new entry had been made on the sheet since Balder's
  enlistment.</p>

  <p>His police car took him to Leaford Road; 93 was a respectable little
  house&mdash;such a house as Elk always imagined his assistant would live in.
  His knock was answered by an elderly woman who was dressed for going out, and
  Elk was surprised to see that she wore the uniform of a nurse.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Balder lives here," she said, apparently surprised to see the
  visitor. "That is to say, he has two rooms here, though he very seldom stays
  here the night. He usually comes here to change, and then I think he goes on
  to his friends."</p>

  <p>"Does his wife live here?"</p>

  <p>"His wife?" said the woman in surprise. "I didn't know that he was
  married."</p>

  <p>Elk had brought Balder's official record with him, to procure some dates
  which it was necessary he should certify for pension purposes. In the space
  against Balder's address, he noticed for the first time that there were two
  addresses given, and that Leaford Road had been crossed out with ink so pale
  that he only noticed it now that he saw the paper in daylight. The second
  address was one in Stepney.</p>

  <p>"I seem to have made a mistake," he said. "His address here is Orchard
  Street, Stepney." But the nurse smiled.</p>

  <p>"He was with me many years ago," she said, "then he went to Stepney, but
  during the war he came here, because the air raids were rather bad in the
  East End of London. I am under the impression he has still a room in
  Stepney."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" said Elk thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>He was at the gate when the nurse called him back.</p>

  <p>"I don't think he goes to Stepney, though I don't know whether I ought to
  talk about his business to a stranger; but if you want him particularly, I
  should imagine you would find him at Slough. I'm a monthly nurse," she said,
  "and I've seen his car twice going into Seven Gables on the Slough Road. I
  think he must have a friend there."</p>

  <p>"Whose car?" asked the startled Elk.</p>

  <p>"It may be his or his friend's car," said the nurse. "Is he a friend of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>"He is in a way," said Elk cautiously.</p>

  <p>She stood for a moment thinking.</p>

  <p>"Will you come in, please?"</p>

  <p>He followed her into the clean and tidy little parlour.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I told you, or why I've been talking so freely to you,"
  she said, "but the truth is, I've given Mr. Balder notice. He makes so many
  complaints, and he's so difficult to please, that I can't satisfy him. It
  isn't as though he paid me a lot of money&mdash;he doesn't. I make very
  little profit out of his rooms, and I've a chance of letting them at a better
  rent. And then he's so particular about his letters. I've had a letter-box
  put on the door, but even that is not big enough to hold them some days. What
  his other business is, I don't know. The letters that come here are for the
  Didcot Chemical Works. You probably think that I am a very difficult woman to
  please, because, after all, he's out all day and seldom sleeps here at
  night."</p>

  <p>Elk drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"I think you're nearly the finest woman I've ever met," he said. "Are you
  going out now?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've an all night case, and I shan't be back till eleven to-morrow. You
  were very fortunate in finding anybody at home."</p>

  <p>"I think you said 'his car'; what sort of a car is it?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>"It's a black machine&mdash;I don't know the make; I think it is an
  American make. And he must have something to do with the ownership because
  once I found a lot of tyre catalogues in his bedroom, and some of the tyres
  he had marked with a pencil, so I suppose he's responsible to an extent."</p>

  <p>One last question Elk asked.</p>

  <p>"Does he come back here at night after you've gone?"</p>

  <p>"Very rarely, I imagine," replied the woman. "He has his own key, and as
  I'm very often out at night I'm not sure whether he returns or not."</p>

  <p>Elk stood with one foot on the running-board of his car.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I can drop you somewhere, madam?" he said, and the elderly woman
  gratefully accepted.</p>

  <p>Elk went back to headquarters, opened a drawer of his desk and took out a
  few implements of his profession, and, after filing a number of urgent
  instructions, returned to the waiting car, driving to Harley Terrace. Dick
  Gordon had an engagement that night to join a theatre party with the members
  of the American Embassy, and he was in one of the boxes at the Hilarity
  Theatre when Elk opened the door quietly, tapped him on the shoulder, and
  brought him out into the corridor, without the remainder of the party being
  aware that their guest had retired.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong, Elk?" asked Gordon.</p>

  <p>"Balder's got his promotion," said Elk solemnly, and Dick stared at him.
  "He's an Acting-Sergeant," Elk went on, "and I don't know a better rank for
  Balder. When this news comes to him and his wife and children, there'll be
  some happy hearts, believe me."</p>

  <p>Elk never drank: this was the first thought that came to Dick Gordon's
  mind; but there was a possibility that the anxieties and worries of the past
  few weeks might have got on top of him.</p>

  <p>"I'm very glad for Balder," he said gently, "and I'm glad for you too,
  Elk, because I know you tried hard to get this miserable devil a step in the
  right direction."</p>

  <p>"Go on with what you were thinking," said Elk.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I was thinking anything," laughed Dick.</p>

  <p>"You were thinking that I must be suffering from sunstroke, or I shouldn't
  take you out of your comfortable theatre to announce Balder's promotion. Now
  will you get your coat, Captain Gordon, and come along with me? I want to
  break the news to Balder."</p>

  <p>Mystified, but asking no further questions, Gordon went to the cloak-
  room, got his coat, and joined the detective in the vestibule.</p>

  <p>"We're going to Slough&mdash;to the Seven Gables," he added. "It's a fine
  house. I haven't seen it, but I know it's a fine house, with a carriage drive
  and grand furniture, electric light, telephone and a modern bathroom. That's
  deduction. I'll tell you something else&mdash;also deduction. There are trip
  wires on the lawn, burglar alarms in the windows, about a hundred
  servants&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you talking about?" asked Dick, and Elk chuckled
  hysterically.</p>

  <p>They were running through Uxbridge when a long-bodied motor-car whizzed
  past them at full speed. It was crowded with men who were jammed into the
  seats or sat upon one another's knees.</p>

  <p>"That's a merry little party," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"Very," replied Elk laconically.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, a second car flashed past, going much faster than
  they.</p>

  <p>"That looks to me like one of your police cars," said Dick.</p>

  <p>This, too, was crowded.</p>

  <p>"It certainly looks like one of my police cars," agreed Elk. "In America
  they've got a better stunt. As you probably know, they've a fine patrol wagon
  system. I'd like to introduce it into this country; it's very handy."</p>

  <p>As the car slowed to pass through the narrow, crooked street of
  Colnebrook, a third of the big machines squeezed past, and this time there
  was no mistaking its character. The man who sat with the driver, Dick knew as
  a detective inspector. He winked at Elk as he passed, and Elk winked back
  with great solemnity.</p>

  <p>"What is the idea?" asked Dick, his curiosity now thoroughly piqued.</p>

  <p>"We're having a smoking concert," said Elk, "to celebrate Balder's
  promotion. And it will be one of the greatest successes that we've had in the
  history of the Force. There will be the brothers Mick and Mac, the trick
  cyclists, in their unrivalled act..." He babbled on foolishly.</p>

  <p>At Langley the fourth and fifth police cars came past. Dick had long since
  realized that the slow pace at which his own car was moving was designed to
  allow these laden machines to overtake them. Beyond Langley, the Windsor road
  turned abruptly to the left, and, leaning over the driver, Elk gave new
  instructions. There was no sign of the police cars: they had apparently gone
  on to Slough. A solitary country policeman stood at the cross-roads and
  watched them as they disappeared in the dusk with a certain languid
  interest.</p>

  <p>"We'll stop here," said Elk, and the car was pulled from the road on to
  the green sidewalk.</p>

  <p>Elk got down.</p>

  <p>"Walk a little up the road while I talk to Captain Gordon, he said to the
  chauffeur, and then he talked, and Dick listened in amazement and
  unbelief.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Elk, "we've got about five minutes' walk, as far as I can
  remember. I haven't been to Windsor races for so long that I've almost
  forgotten where the houses are."</p>

  <p>They found the entrance to the Seven Gables between two stiff yew hedges.
  There was no gateway; a broad, gravelled path ran between a thick belt of
  pine trees, behind which the house was hidden. Elk went a little ahead.
  Presently be stopped and raised his hand warningly. Dick came a little
  nearer, and, looking over the shoulder of the detective, had his first view
  of Seven Gables.</p>

  <p>It was a large house, with timbered walls and high, twisted chimney-
  stacks.</p>

  <p>"Pseudo-Elizabethan," said Dick admiringly.</p>

  <p>"1066," murmured Elk, "or was it 1599? That's <i>some</i> house!"</p>

  <p>It was growing dusk, and lights were showing from a broad window at the
  farther end of the building. The arched doorway was facing them.</p>

  <p>"Let us go back," whispered Elk, and they retraced their steps.</p>

  <p>It was not until darkness had fallen that he led the way up the carriage
  drive to the point they had reached on their earlier excursion. The light
  still showed in the window, but the cream-coloured blinds were drawn
  down.</p>

  <p>"It is safe up as far as the door," whispered Elk; "but right and left of
  that, watch out!"</p>

  <p>He had pulled a pair of thick stockings over his shoes, and handed another
  pair to Dick; and then, with an electric torch in his hand, he began to move
  along the path which ran parallel with the building. Presently he
  stopped.</p>

  <p>"Step over," he whispered.</p>

  <p>Dick, looking down, saw the black thread traversing the path, and very
  cautiously avoided the obstacle.</p>

  <p>A few more paces, and again Elk stopped and warned Dick to step high,
  turning to show his light upon the second of the threads, almost invisible
  even in the powerful glare of the electric lamp. He did not move from where
  he stood until he had made a careful examination of the path ahead; and it
  was well that he did so, for the third trip wire was less than two feet from
  the second.</p>

  <p>They were half-an-hour covering the twenty yards which separated them from
  the window. The night was warm, and one of the casements was open. Elk crept
  close under the window-sill, his sensitive fingers feeling for the alarm
  which he expected to find protecting the broad sill. This he discovered and
  avoided, and, raising his hand, he gently drew aside the window blind.</p>

  <p>He saw a large, oaken-panelled room, luxuriously furnished. The wide, open
  stone fireplace was banked with flowers, and before it, at a small table, sat
  two men. The first was Balder&mdash;unmistakably Balder, and strangely
  good-looking. Balder's red nose was no longer red. He was in evening dress
  and between his teeth was a long amber cigarette-holder.</p>

  <p>Dick saw it all, his cheek against EIk's head, heard the quick intake of
  the detective's breath, and then noticed the second man. It was Mr.
  Maitland.</p>

  <p>Mr. Maitland sat, his face in his hands, and Balder was locking at him
  with a cynical smile.</p>

  <p>They were too far away to hear what the men were saving, but apparently
  Maitland was being made the object of reproof. He looked up after a while,
  and got on to his feet and began talking. They heard the rumble of his
  excited voice, but again no word was intelligible. Then they saw him raise
  his fist and shake it at the smiling man, who watched him with a calm,
  detached interest, as though he were some strange insect which had come into
  his ken. With this parting gesture of defiance, old Maitland shuffled from
  the room and the door closed behind him. In a few minutes he came out of the
  house, not through the doorway, as they expected, but apparently through a
  gateway on the other side of the hedge, for they saw the gleam of the
  headlights of his car as it passed.</p>

  <p>Left alone, Balder poured himself a drink and apparently rang for one of
  the servants. The man who came in arrested Dick's attention instantly. He
  wore the conventional uniform of a footman, the dark trousers and the striped
  waistcoat, but it was easy to see, from the way he moved, that he was not an
  ordinary type of servant. A big man, powerfully built, his every action was
  slow and curiously deliberate. Balder said something to him, and the footman
  nodded, and, taking up the tray, went out with the same leisurely, almost
  pompous, step that had distinguished his entry.</p>

  <p>And then it flashed upon Dick, and he whispered into the detective's ear
  one word.</p>

  <p>"Blind!"</p>

  <p>Elk nodded. Again the door opened, and this time three footmen came in,
  carrying a heavy-looking table with a canvas cover. At first Gordon thought
  that it was Balder's meal that was being brought, but he was soon to discover
  the truth. Above the fireplace, hanging on a single wire, was a large
  electric lamp, which was not alight. Standing on a chair, one of the footmen
  took out the lamp and inserted a plug from the end of which ran a wire
  connecting with the table.</p>

  <p>"They're all blind," said Elk in a whisper. "And that is Balder's own
  broadcasting apparatus, and the aerial is attached to the lamp."</p>

  <p>The three servants went out, and, rising, Balder walked to the door and
  locked it.</p>

  <p>There were another set of windows in the room, looking out upon the side
  of the house, and one by one Balder closed and shuttered them. He was busy
  with the second of the three, when Elk put his foot upon a ledge of brick,
  and, tearing aside the curtain, leapt into the room.</p>

  <p>At the sound, Balder spun round.</p>

  <p>"Evening, Balder," said Elk.</p>

  <p>The man made no reply. He stood, watching his sometime chief, with eyes
  that did not waver.</p>

  <p>"Thought I'd come along and tell you that you've got your promotion," said
  Elk, "as Acting-Sergeant from the 1st of May, in recognition of the services
  you've rendered to the State by poisoning Frog Mills, loosing Frog Hagn, and
  blowing up my office with a bomb that you planted overnight."</p>

  <p>Still the man did not speak, nor did he move; and here he was discreet,
  for the long-barrelled Browning in Elk's hand covered the lower button of his
  white piqué waistcoat.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Elk&mdash;there was a ring of triumph in his voice&mdash;
  "you'll take a little walk with me&mdash;I want you, <i>Number
  Seven!</i>"</p>

  <p>"Haven't you made a mistake?" drawled Balder, so unlike his usual voice
  that Elk was for a moment taken aback.</p>

  <p>"I never have made a mistake except about the date when Henry the Eighth
  married," said Elk.</p>

  <p>"Who do you imagine I am?" asked this debonair man of the world.</p>

  <p>"I've ceased imagining anything about you, Balder&mdash;I know!"</p>

  <p>Elk walked with a quick movement toward him and thrust the muzzle of the
  pistol in his prisoner's diaphragm.</p>

  <p>"Put up your hands and turn round," he said.</p>

  <p>Balder obeyed. Slipping a pair of handcuffs from his pocket, Elk snapped
  them on to the wrists. Deftly the detective strapped the arms from behind,
  drawing them tight, so that the manacled hands had no play.</p>

  <p>"This is very uncomfortable," said Balder. "Is it usual for you to make
  mistakes of this character, Mr. Elk? My name is Collett-Banson."</p>

  <p>"Your name is Mud," said Elk, "but I'm willing to listen to anything you
  like to say. I'd rather have your views on cyanide of potassium than
  anything. You can sit down."</p>

  <p>Dick saw a gleam come to the man's eye; it flashed for a second and was
  gone. Evidently Elk saw it too.</p>

  <p>"Don't let your hopes rest upon any monkey tricks that might be played by
  your attendants," he said, "because fifty C.I.D. men, most of whom are known
  personally to you, are disposed round this house."</p>

  <p>Balder laughed.</p>

  <p>"If they were round the house and on top of the house, they wouldn't worry
  me," he said. "I tell you, inspector, you've made a very grave error, and one
  which will cost you dear. If a gentleman cannot sit in his own
  drawing-room,"&mdash;he glanced at the table&mdash;"listening to a wireless
  concert at The Hague without interfering policemen&mdash;then it is about
  time the police force was disbanded."</p>

  <p>He walked across to the fireplace carelessly and stood with his back to
  it; then, lifting his foot, he kicked back one of the steel fire-dogs which
  stood on either side of the wide hearth, and the "dog" fell over on its side.
  It was a nervous act of a man who was greatly worried and was not quite
  conscious of what he was doing. Even Elk, who was all suspicion, saw nothing
  to excite his apprehension.</p>

  <p>"You think my name is Balder, do you?" the man went on. "Well, all I can
  say is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he flung himself sideways on to the hearthrug, but Elk was
  quicker. As an oblong slip of the floor gave way beneath the man's weight,
  Elk gripped him by the collar and together they dragged him back to the
  room.</p>

  <p>In a second the three were struggling on the floor together, and in his
  desperation Balder's strength was unbelievable. His roaring cry for help was
  heard. There came a heavy blow on the door, the babble of angry voices
  without, and then, from the ground outside, a series of sharp explosions, as
  the army of detectives raced across the lawn, oblivious to the presence of
  the alarm-guns.</p>

  <p>The fight was short and sharp. The six blind men who comprised the
  household of No. 7 were hustled away, and in the last car travelled Acting-
  Sergeant Balder, that redoubtable No. 7, who was the right hand and the left
  hand of the terrible Frog.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap27"
     id="chap27">XXVII. &mdash; MR. BROAD IS INTERESTING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dick Gordon ended his interview with Mr. Ezra Maitland at
  three o'clock in the morning, and went to Headquarters, to find the
  charge-room at Cannon Row singularly empty. When he had left, it was
  impossible to get in or out for the crowd of detectives which filled or
  surrounded the place.</p>

  <p>"On the whole, Pentonville is safest, and I've got him there. I asked the
  Governor to put him in the condemned cell, but it is not etiquette. Anyway,
  Pentonville is the safest spot I know, and I think that, unless Frogs eat
  stones, he'll stay. What has Maitland got to say, Captain?"</p>

  <p>"Maitland's story, so far as one can get a story from him, is that he went
  to see Balder by invitation. 'When you're sent for by the police, what can
  you do?' he asked, and the question is unanswerable."</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt at all," said Elk, "that Maitland knew Balder's
  character, and it was not in his capacity as policeman that the old man
  visited him. There is less doubt that this man is hand in glove with the
  Frog, but it is going to be very difficult to prove."</p>

  <p>"Maitland puzzles me," said Dick. "He's such a bully, and yet such a
  frightened old man. I thought he was going to drop through the floor when I
  told him who I was, and why I had come. And when I mentioned the fact that
  Balder had been arrested, he almost collapsed."</p>

  <p>"That line has to be followed," said Elk thoughtfully. "I have sent for
  Johnson. He ought to be here by now. Johnson must know something about the
  old man's business, and he will be a very valuable witness if we can connect
  the two."</p>

  <p>The philosopher arrived half-an-hour later, having been aroused from his
  sleep to learn that his presence was required at Headquarters.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Elk will tell you something which will be public property in a day or
  two," said Gordon. "Balder has been arrested in connection with the explosion
  which occurred in Mr. Elk's office."</p>

  <p>It was necessary to explain to Johnson exactly who Balder was, and Dick
  went on to tell him of the old man's visit to Slough. Johnson shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know that Maitland had a friend of that name," he said. "Balder?
  What other name had he?"</p>

  <p>"He called himself Collet-Banson," said Dick, and a look of understanding
  came to the face of Johnson.</p>

  <p>"I know that name very well. Mr. Banson used frequently to call at the
  office, generally late in the evenings&mdash;Maitland spends three nights a
  week working after the clerks have gone, as I know to my cost," he said. "A
  rather tall, good looking fellow of about forty?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is the man."</p>

  <p>"He has a house near Windsor. I have never been there, but I know because
  I have posted letters to him."</p>

  <p>"What sort of business did Collett-Banson have with Maitland?"</p>

  <p>"I've never been able to discover. I always thought of him as a man who
  had property to sell, for that was the only type of outsider who was ever
  admitted to Maitland's presence. I remember that he had the child staying
  with him for about a week&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is, the child in Maitland's house?"</p>

  <p>Johnson nodded.</p>

  <p>"You don't know what association there is between the child and these two
  men?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, except that I am certain that Mr. Collett-Banson had the little
  boy with him, because I sent toys&mdash;mechanical engines or something of
  the sort&mdash;by Mr. Maitland's directions. It was the day that Mr. Maitland
  made his will, about eighteen months ago. I remember the day particularly for
  a peculiar reason. I had expected Mr. Maitland to ask me to witness the will
  and was piqued, for no cause, because he brought two clerks up from the
  office to sign. These little things impress themselves upon one," he
  added.</p>

  <p>"Was the will made in favour of the child?"</p>

  <p>Johnson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I haven't the slightest knowledge of how the property goes," he said. "He
  never discussed the matter with me; he wouldn't even employ a lawyer. In
  fact, I don't remember his ever employing a lawyer all the time I was with
  him, except for conveyancing work. He told me he had copied the form of will
  from a book, but beyond feeling hurt that I, an old and faithful servant of
  his, hadn't been taken a little into his confidence, I wasn't greatly
  interested in the matter. But I do remember that that morning I went down to
  a store and bought a whole lot of toys, had them packed and brought them back
  to the office. The old man played with them all the afternoon!"</p>

  <p>Early in the morning Dick Gordon interviewed the prisoners at Pentonville,
  and found them in a very obstinate mood.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about babies or children; and if Johnson says he sent
  toys, he is lying," said Balder defiantly. "I refuse to make any statement
  about Maitland or my association with Maitland. I am the victim of police
  persecution, and I defy you to bring any proof that I have committed a single
  act in my life&mdash;unless it is a crime to live like a gentleman&mdash;for
  which you can imprison me."</p>

  <p>"Have you any message for your wife and children?" asked Dick
  sarcastically, and the sullen features of the man relaxed for a second.</p>

  <p>"No, Elk will look after them," he said humorously.</p>

  <p>The most stringent precautions had been taken to prevent a rescue, and the
  greatest care was exercised that no communication passed between No. 7 and
  the outside world. He was charged at Bow Street an hour before the court
  usually sat. Evidence of arrest was taken, and he was remanded, being removed
  to Pentonville in a motor-van under armed guard.</p>

  <p>On the third night of his imprisonment, romance came into the life of the
  second chief warder of Pentonville Prison. He was comparatively young and
  single, not without good looks, and lived, with his widowed mother, at
  Shepherd's Bush. It was his practice to return home after his day's duty by
  omnibus, and he was alighting on this day when a lady, who had got off before
  him, stumbled and fell. Instantly he was by her side, and had lifted her to
  her feet. She was young and astonishingly pretty and he helped her gain the
  pavement.</p>

  <p>"It was nothing," she said smilingly, but with a grimace of pain. "It was
  very foolish of me to come by 'bus; I was visiting an old servant of mine who
  is ill. Will you call me a taxi, please?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, madam," said the gallant chief warder.</p>

  <p>The taxi which was passing was beckoned to the kerb. The girl looked round
  helplessly.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could see somebody I know. I don't want to go home alone; I'm so
  afraid of fainting."</p>

  <p>"If you would not object to my escort," said the man, with all the
  warm-hearted earnestness which the sight of a woman in distress awakens in
  the bosom of impressionable man, "I will see you home."</p>

  <p>She shot a glance at him which was full of gratitude and accepted his
  escort, murmuring her regret for the trouble she was giving him.</p>

  <p>It was a beautiful apartment she occupied. The chief warder thought he had
  never met so gracious and beautiful a lady before, so appropriately housed,
  and he was right. He would have attended to her injury, but she felt so much
  better, and her maid was coming in soon, and would he have a whisky-and-soda,
  and would he please smoke? She indicated where the cigarettes were to be
  found, and for an hour the chief warder spoke about himself, and had an
  enjoyable evening.</p>

  <p>"I'm very much obliged to you, Mr. Bron," she said at parting. "I feel
  I've wasted your evening."</p>

  <p>"I can assure you," said Mr. Bron earnestly, "that if this is a waste of
  time, then time has no use!"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"That is a pretty speech," she said, "and I will let you call to-morrow
  and see me."</p>

  <p>He took a careful note of the address; it was an exclusive maisonette in
  Bloomsbury Square; and the next evening found him ringing the bell, but this
  time he was not in uniform.</p>

  <p>He left at ten o'clock, an ecstatic man who held his head high and dreamt
  golden dreams, for the fragrance of her charm (as he wrote her) "permeated
  his very being." Ten minutes after he had gone, the girl came out, closed the
  door behind her and went out into the street, and the idler who had been
  promenading the pavement threw away his cigar.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Miss Bassano," he said.</p>

  <p>She drew herself up.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you have made a mistake," she said stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Not at all. You're Miss Bassano, and my only excuse for addressing you is
  that I am a neighbour of yours."</p>

  <p>She looked more closely at him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Broad!" she said in a more gracious tone. "I've been visiting a
  friend of mine who is rather ill."</p>

  <p>"So I'm told, and a nice flat your friend occupies," he said as he fell in
  by her side. "I was thinking of hiring it a few days ago. These furnished
  apartments are difficult to find. Maybe it was a week ago&mdash;yes, it was a
  week ago," he said carefully; "it was the day before you had your lamentable
  accident in Shepherd's Bush."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand you," she said, on her guard at once.</p>

  <p>"The truth is," said Mr. Broad apologetically, "that I've been trying to
  get at Bron too. I've been making a very careful study of the prison staff
  for the past two months, and I've a list of the easy boys that has cost me a
  lot of money to compile. I suppose you didn't reach the stage where you
  persuaded him to talk about his interesting prisoner? I tried him last week,"
  he went on reminiscently. "He goes to a dance club at Hammersmith, and I got
  acquainted with him through a girl he's keen about&mdash;you're not the only
  young love of his life, by the way."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"What a clever man you are, Mr. Broad!" she said. "No, I'm not very
  interested in prisoners. By the way, who is this person you were referring
  to?"</p>

  <p>"I was referring to Number Seven, who is in Pentonville Gaol," said Mr.
  Broad coolly, "and I've got an idea he is a friend of yours."</p>

  <p>"Number Seven?" Her perplexity would have convinced a less hardened man
  than Joshua Broad. "I have an idea that that is something to do with the
  Frogs."</p>

  <p>"That is something to do with the Frogs," agreed the other gravely, "about
  whom I daresay you have read. Miss Bassano, I'll make you an offer."</p>

  <p>"Offer me a taxi, for I'm tired of walking," she said, and when they were
  seated side by side she asked: "What your offer?"</p>

  <p>"I offer you all that you require to get out of this country and to keep
  you out for a few years, until this old Frog busts&mdash;as he will bust!
  I've been watching you for a long time, and, if you won't consider it an
  impertinence, I like you. There's something about you that is very
  attractive&mdash;Don't stop me, because I'm not going to get fresh with you,
  or suggest that you're the only girl that ever made tobacco taste like
  molasses&mdash;I like you in a kind of pitying way, and you needn't get
  offended at that either. And I don't want to see you hurt."</p>

  <p>He was very serious; she recognized his sincerity, and the word of sarcasm
  that rose to her lips remained unuttered.</p>

  <p>"Are you wholly disinterested?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"So far as you are concerned, I am," he replied. "There is going to be an
  almighty smash, and it is more than likely that you'll get in the way of some
  of the flying pieces."</p>

  <p>She did not answer him at once. What he had said merely intensified her
  own uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know I'm married?"</p>

  <p>"I guessed that," he answered. "Take your husband with you. What are you
  going to do with that boy?"</p>

  <p>"You mean Ray Bennett?"</p>

  <p>It was curious that she made no attempt to disguise either her position or
  the part that she was playing. She wondered at herself after she was home.
  But Joshua Broad had a compelling way, and she never dreamt of deceiving
  him.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said. "I wish he wasn't in it. He is on my conscience.
  Are you smiling?"</p>

  <p>"At your having a conscience? No, I fancied that was how you stood. And
  the growing beard?"</p>

  <p>She did not laugh.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that. All I know is that we've had&mdash;why am I
  telling you this? Who are you, Mr. Broad?" He chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Some day I'll tell you," he said; "and I promise you that, if you're
  handy, you shall be the first to know. Go easy with that boy, Lola."</p>

  <p>She did not resent the employment of her first name, but rather it warmed
  her towards this mystery man.</p>

  <p>"And write to Mr. Bron, Assistant Chief Warder of Pentonville Gaol, and
  tell him that you've been called out of town and won't be able to see him
  again for ten years."</p>

  <p>To this she made no rejoinder. He left her at the door of her flat and
  took her little hand in his.</p>

  <p>"If you want money to get away, I'll send you a blank cheque," he said.
  "There is no one else on the face of the earth that I'd give a blank cheque
  to, believe me."</p>

  <p>She nodded, most unusual tears in her eyes. Lola was breaking under the
  strain, and nobody knew it better than the hawk-faced man who watched her as
  she passed into her flat.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap28"
     id="chap28">XXVIII. &mdash; MURDER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The stone which woke Ella Bennett was aimed with such force
  that the pane cracked. She slipped quickly from bed and pulled aside the
  curtains. There had been a thunderstorm in the night, and the skies were so
  grey and heavy, and the light so bad, that she could only distinguish the
  shape of the man that stood under her window. John Bennett heard her go from
  her room and came to his door.</p>

  <p>"Is it Maitland?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I think so," she said.</p>

  <p>He frowned.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand these visits," he said. "Do you think he's mad?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. After the precipitate flight of the old man on his
  last visit, she had not expected that he would come again, and guessed that
  only some matter of the greatest urgency would bring him. She heard her
  father moving about his room as she went through the darkened dining-room
  into the passage which opened directly on to the garden.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, miss?" quavered a voice in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Maitland."</p>

  <p>"Is <i>he</i> up?" he asked in an awe-stricken whisper.</p>

  <p>"You mean my father? Yes, he's awake."</p>

  <p>"I've got to see you," the old man almost wailed. "They've took him."</p>

  <p>"Taken whom?" she asked with a catch in her voice.</p>

  <p>"That fellow Balder. I knew they would."</p>

  <p>She remembered having heard Elk mention Balder.</p>

  <p>"The policeman?" she asked. "Mr. Elk's man?"</p>

  <p>But he was off on another tack.</p>

  <p>"It's you he's after." He came nearer to her and clutched her arm. "I
  warned you&mdash;don't forget I warned you. Tell him that I warned you. He'll
  make it good for me, won't he?" he almost pleaded, and she began to
  understand dimly that the "he" to whom the old man was referring was Dick
  Gordon. "He's been with me most of the night, prying and asking questions.
  I've had a terrible night, miss, terrible," he almost sobbed. "First Balder
  and then him. He'll get you&mdash;not that police gentleman I don't mean, but
  Frog. That's why I wrote you the letter, telling you to come up. You didn't
  get no letter, did you, miss?"</p>

  <p>She could not make head or tail of what he was saying or to whom he was
  referring, as he went on babbling his story of fear, a story interspersed
  with wild imprecations against "him."</p>

  <p>"Tell your father, dearie, what I said to you." He became suddenly calmer.
  "Matilda said I ought to have told your father, but I'm afraid of him, my
  dear, I'm afraid of him!"</p>

  <p>He took one of her hands in his and fondled it.</p>

  <p>"You'll speak a word for me, won't you?" She knew he was weeping, though
  she could not see his face.</p>

  <p>"Of course I'll speak a word for you, Mr. Maitland. Oughtn't you to see a
  doctor?" she asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"No, no, no doctors for me. But tell him, won't you&mdash;not your father,
  I mean, the other feller&mdash;that I did all I could for you. That's what
  I've come to see you about. They've got Balder&mdash;" He stopped short
  suddenly and craned his head forward. "Is that your father?" he asked in a
  husky whisper.</p>

  <p>She had heard the footsteps of John Bennett on the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think it is, Mr. Maitland," and at her words he pulled his hand
  from hers with a jerk and went shuffling down the pathway into the road and
  out of sight.</p>

  <p>"What did he want?"</p>

  <p>"I really don't know, father," she said. "I don't think he can be very
  well."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean mad?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and yet he was quite sensible for a little time. He said they've got
  Balder."</p>

  <p>He did not reply to her, and she thought he had not heard her.</p>

  <p>"They've taken Balder, Mr. Elk's assistant. I suppose that means he has
  been arrested?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," said John Bennett, and then: "My dear, you ought to be in
  bed. Which way did he go?"</p>

  <p>"He went toward Shoreham," said the girl. "Are you going after him,
  father?" she asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I'll walk up the road. I'd like to see him," said John Bennett. "You go
  to bed, my dear."</p>

  <p>But she stood waiting by the door, long after his footsteps had ceased to
  sound on the road. Five minutes, ten minutes passed, a quarter of an hour,
  and then she heard the whine of a car and the big limousine flew past the
  gate, spattering mud, and then came John Bennett.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you in bed?" he asked almost roughly.</p>

  <p>"No, father, I don't feel sleepy. It is late now, so I think I'll do some
  work. Did you see him?"</p>

  <p>"Who, the old man? Yes, I saw him for a minute or two."</p>

  <p>"Did you speak to him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I spoke to him." The man did not seem inclined to pursue the
  subject, but this time Ella persisted.</p>

  <p>"Father, why is he frightened of you?"</p>

  <p>"Will you make me some coffee?" said Bennett.</p>

  <p>"Why is he frightened of you?"</p>

  <p>"How do I know? My dear, don't ask so many questions. You worry me. He
  knows me, he's seen me&mdash;that is all. Balder is held for murder. I think
  he is a very bad man."</p>

  <p>Later in the day she revived the subject of Maitland's visit.</p>

  <p>"I wish he would not come," she said. "He frightens me."</p>

  <p>"He will not come again," said John Bennett prophetically.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>The house in Berkeley Square which had passed into the possession of Ezra
  Maitland had been built by a nobleman to whom money had no significance.
  Loosely described as one of the show places of the Metropolis, very few
  outsiders had ever marvelled at the beauty of its interior. It was a palace,
  though none could guess as much from viewing its conventional exterior. In
  the gorgeous saloon, with its lapis-lazuli columns, its fireplaces of onyx
  and silver, its delicately panelled walls and silken hangings, Mr. Ezra
  Maitland sat huddled in a large Louis Quinze chair, a glass of beer before
  him, a blackened clay pipe between his gums. The muddy marks of his feet
  showed on the priceless Persian carpet; his hat half eclipsed a golden Venus
  of Marrionnet, which stood on a pedestal by his side. His hands clasped
  across his stomach, he glared from under his white eyebrows at the floor. One
  shaded lamp relieved the gloom, for the silken curtains were drawn and the
  light of day did not enter.</p>

  <p>Presently, with an effort, he reached out, took the mug of beer, which had
  gone flat, and drained its contents. This dare and the mug replaced, he sank
  back into his former condition of torpor. There was a gentle knock at the
  door and a footman came in, a man of powder and calves.</p>

  <p>"Three gentlemen to see you, sir. Captain Gordon, Mr. Elk, and Mr.
  Johnson."</p>

  <p>The old man suddenly sat up.</p>

  <p>"Johnson?" he said. "What does he want?"</p>

  <p>"They are in the little drawing-room, sir."</p>

  <p>"Push them in," growled the old man.</p>

  <p>He seemed indifferent to the presence of the two police officers, and it
  was Johnson he addressed.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked violently. "What do you mean by coming
  here?"</p>

  <p>"It was my suggestion that Mr. Johnson should come," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"Oh, your suggestion, was it?" said the old man, and his attitude was
  strangely insolent compared with his dejection of the early morning.</p>

  <p>Elk's eyes fell upon the empty beer-mug, and he wondered how often that
  had been filled since Ezra Maitland had returned to the house. He guessed it
  had been employed fairly often, for there was a truculence in the ancient
  man's tone, a defiance in his eye, which suggested something more than
  spiritual exaltation.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to answer any questions," he said loudly. "I'm not going to
  tell any truth, and I'm not going to tell any lies."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Maitland," said Johnson hesitatingly, "these gentlemen are anxious to
  know about the child."</p>

  <p>The old man closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to tell no truth and I'm not going to tell no lies," he
  repeated monotonously.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Maitland," said the good-humoured Elk, "forget your good
  resolution and tell us just why you lived in that slum of Eldor Street."</p>

  <p>"No truth and no lies," murmured the old man. "You can lock me up but I
  won't tell you anything. Lock me up. My name's Ezra Maitland; I am a
  millionaire. I've got millions and millions and millions! I could buy you up
  and I could buy up mostly anybody! Old Ezra Maitland! I've been in the
  workhouse and I've been in quod."</p>

  <p>Dick and his companion exchanged glances, and Elk shook his head to
  signify the futility of further questioning the old man. Nevertheless, Dick
  tried again.</p>

  <p>"Why did you go to Horsham this morning?" he asked, and could have bitten
  his tongue when he realized his blunder. Instantly the old man was wide
  awake.</p>

  <p>"I never went to Horsham," he roared. "Don't know what you're talking
  about. I'm not going to tell you anything. Throw 'em out, Johnson."</p>

  <p>When they were in the street again, Elk asked a question.</p>

  <p>"No, I've never known him to drink before," said Johnson. "He has always
  been very abstemious so long as I've known him. I never thought I could
  persuade him to talk."</p>

  <p>"Nor did I," said Dick Gordon&mdash;a statement which more than a little
  surprised the detective.</p>

  <p>Dick signalled to the other to get rid of Johnson, and when that
  philosophical gentleman had been thanked and sent away, Dick Gordon spoke
  urgently.</p>

  <p>"We must have two men in this house at once. What excuse can we offer for
  planting detectives on Maitland?"</p>

  <p>Elk pursed his lips.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he confessed. "We shall have to get a warrant before we
  arrest him; we could easily get another warrant to search the house; but
  beyond that I fear we can't go, unless he asks for protection."</p>

  <p>"Then put him under arrest," said Dick promptly.</p>

  <p>"What is the charge?"</p>

  <p>"Hold him on suspicion of being associated with the Frogs, and if
  necessary move him to the nearest police station. But it has to be done at
  once."</p>

  <p>Elk was perturbed.</p>

  <p>"It isn't a small matter to arrest a millionaire, you know, Captain
  Gordon. I daresay in America it is simple, and I am told you could pinch the
  President if you found him with a flask in his pocket. But here it is a
  little different."</p>

  <p>How very different it was, Dick discovered when he made application in
  private for the necessary warrants. At four o'clock they were delivered to
  him by the clerk of a reluctant magistrate, and, accompanied by police
  officers, be went back to Maitland's palatial home.</p>

  <p>The footman who admitted them said that Mr. Maitland was lying down and
  that he did not care to disturb him. In proof, he sent for a second footman,
  who confirmed the statement.</p>

  <p>"Which is his room?" said Dick Gordon. "I am a police officer and I want
  to see him."</p>

  <p>"On the second floor, sir."</p>

  <p>He showed them to an electric lift, which carried the five to the second
  floor. Opposite the lift grille was a large double door, heavily burnished
  and elaborately gilded.</p>

  <p>"Looks more like the entrance to a theatre," said Elk. in an
  undertone.</p>

  <p>Dick knocked. There was no answer. He knocked louder. Still there was no
  answer. And then, to Elk's surprise, the young man launched himself at the
  door with all his strength. There was a sound of splitting wood and the door
  parted. Dick stood in the entrance, rooted to the ground.</p>

  <p>Ezra Maitland lay half on the bed, his legs dragging over the side. At his
  feet was the prostrate figure of the old woman whom he called Matilda. They
  were both dead, and the pungent fumes of cordite still hung in a blue cloud
  beneath the ceiling.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap29"
     id="chap29">XXIX. &mdash; THE FOOTMAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dick ran to the bedside, and one glance at the still figures
  told him all he wanted to know.</p>

  <p>"Both shot," he said, and looked up at the filmy cloud under the ceiling.
  "May have happened any time&mdash;a quarter of an hour ago. This stuff hangs
  about for hours."</p>

  <p>"Hold every servant in the house," said Elk in an undertone to the men who
  were with him.</p>

  <p>A doorway led to a smaller bedroom, which was evidently that occupied by
  Maitland's sister.</p>

  <p>"The shot was fired from this entrance," said Dick. "Probably a silencer
  was used, but we shall hear about that later."</p>

  <p>He searched the floor and found two spent cartridges of a heavy calibre
  automatic.</p>

  <p>"They killed the woman, of course," he said, speaking his thoughts aloud.
  "I was afraid of this. If I could only have got our men in!"</p>

  <p>"You expected him to be murdered?" said Elk in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Dick nodded. He was trying the window of the woman's room. It was
  unfastened, and led on to a narrow parapet, protected by a low balustrade.
  From there, access could be had into another room on the same floor, and no
  attempt had been made by the murderer to conceal the fact that this was the
  way he had passed. The window was wide open, and there were wet footmarks on
  the floor. It was a guest room, slightly overcrowded with surplus furniture,
  which had been put there apparently by the housekeeper instead of in a
  lumber-room.</p>

  <p>The door opened again into the corridor, and faced a narrow flight of
  stairs leading to the servants' quarters above. Elk went down on his knees
  and examined the tread of the carpet carefully.</p>

  <p>"Up here, I think," he said, and ran ahead of his chief.</p>

  <p>The third floor consisted entirely of servants' rooms, and it was some
  time before Elk could pick up the footprints which led directly to No. 1. He
  tried the handle: it was locked. Taking a pace backward, he raised his foot
  and kicked open the door. He found himself in a servant's bedroom, which was
  empty. An attic window opened on to the sloping roof of another parapet, and
  without a second's hesitation Dick went out, following the course of that
  very precarious alleyway. Farther along, iron rails protected the walker, and
  this was evidently one of the ways of escape in case of fire. He followed the
  "path" across three roofs until he came to a short flight of iron stairs,
  which reached down to the flat roof of another house, and a guard
  fire-escape. Guarded it had been, but now the iron gate which barred progress
  was open, and Dick ran down the narrow stairs into a concrete yard surrounded
  on three sides by high walls and on the fourth by the back of a house, which
  was apparently unoccupied, for the blinds were all drawn.</p>

  <p>There was a gate in the third wall, and it was ajar. Passing through, he
  was in a mews. A man was washing a motorcar a dozen paces from where he
  stood, and they hurried toward him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the cleaner, wiping his streaming forehead with the back
  of his hand, "I saw a man come out of there about five minutes ago. He was a
  servant&mdash;a footman or something&mdash;I didn't recognize him, but he
  seemed in a hurry."</p>

  <p>"Did he wear a hat?"</p>

  <p>The man considered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I think he did," he said. "He went out that way," and he
  pointed.</p>

  <p>The two men hurried along, turned into Berkeley Street, and as they did
  so, the car-washer turned to the closed doors of his garage and whistled
  softly. The door opened slowly and Mr. Joshua Broad came out.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said, and a piece of crisp and crackling paper went into
  the washer's hand.</p>

  <p>He was out of sight before Dick and the detective came back from their
  vain quest.</p>

  <p>No doubt existed in Dick's mind as to who the murderer was. One of the
  footmen was missing. The remaining servants were respectable individuals of
  unimpeachable character. The seventh had come at the same time as Mr.
  Maitland; and although he wore a footman's livery, he had apparently no
  previous experience of the duties which he was expected to perform. He was an
  ill-favoured man, who spoke very little, and "kept himself to himself," as
  they described it; took part in none of their pleasures or gossip; was never
  in the servants' hall a second longer than was necessary.</p>

  <p>"Obviously a Frog," said Elk, and was overjoyed to learn that there was a
  photograph of the man in existence.</p>

  <p>The photograph had its origin in an elaborate and somewhat pointless joke
  which had been played on the cook by the youngest of the footmen. The joke
  consisted of finding in the cook's workbasket a photograph of the ugly
  footman, and for this purpose the young servant had taken a snap of the
  man.</p>

  <p>"Do you know him?" asked Dick, looking at the picture. Elk nodded.</p>

  <p>"He has been through my hands, and I don't think I shall have any
  difficulty in placing him, although for the moment his name escapes me."</p>

  <p>A search of the records, however, revealed the identity of the missing
  man, and by the evening an enlargement of the photograph, and his name,
  aliases and general characteristics, were locked into the form of every
  newspaper in the metropolis.</p>

  <p>One of the servants had heard the shot, but thought it was the door being
  slammed&mdash;a pardonable mistake, because Mr. Maitland was in the habit of
  banging doors.</p>

  <p>"Maitland was a Frog all right," reported Elk after he had seen the body
  removed to the mortuary. "He's well decorated on the left wrist&mdash;yes,
  slightly askew. That is one of the points that you've never cleared up to me,
  Captain Gordon. Why they should be tattooed on the left wrist I can
  understand, but why the frog shouldn't be stamped square I've never
  understood."</p>

  <p>"That is one of the little mysteries that can't be cleared up until we are
  through with the big ones," said Dick.</p>

  <p>A telegram had been received that afternoon by the missing footman. This
  fact was not remembered until after Elk had returned to headquarters. A
  'phone message through to the district post-office brought a copy of the
  message. It was very simple.</p>

  <p>"Finish and clear," were the three words. The message was unsigned. It had
  been handed in at the Temple Post Office at two o'clock, and the murderer had
  lost no time in carrying out his instructions.</p>

  <p>Maitland's office was in the hands of the police, and a systematic search
  had already begun of its documents and books. At seven o'clock that night Elk
  went to Fitzroy Square, and Johnson opened the door to him. Looking past him,
  Elk saw that the passage was filled with furniture and packing cases, and
  remembered that early in the morning Johnson had mentioned that he was
  moving, and had taken two cheaper rooms in South London.</p>

  <p>"You've packed?"</p>

  <p>Johnson nodded.</p>

  <p>"I hate leaving this place," he said, "but it's much too expensive. It
  seems as though I shall never get another job, and I'd better face that fact
  sensibly. If I live at Balham, I can live comfortably. I've very few
  expensive tastes."</p>

  <p>"If you have, you can indulge them," said Elk. "We found the old man's
  will. He has left you everything!"</p>

  <p>Johnson's jaw dropped, his eyes opened wide.</p>

  <p>"Are you joking?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I was never more serious in my life. The old man has left you every penny
  he had. Here is a copy of the will: I thought you'd like to see it."</p>

  <p>He opened his pocket-case, producing a sheet of foolscap, and Johnson
  read:</p>

  <p>"I, Ezra Maitland, of 593, Eldor Road, in the County of Middlesex, declare
  this to be my last will and testament, and I formally revoke all other wills
  and codicils to such wills. I bequeath all my property, movable or immovable,
  all lands, houses, deeds, shares in stock companies whatsoever, and all
  jewellery, reversions, carriages, motor-cars, and all other possessions
  absolutely, to Philip Johnson, of 475, Fitzroy Square, in the County of
  London, clerk. I declare him to be the only honest man I have ever met with
  in my long and sorrowful life, and I direct him to devote himself with
  unremitting care to the destruction of that society or organization which is
  known as the Frogs, and which for four and twenty years has extracted large
  sums of blackmail from me."</p>

  <p>It was signed in a clerkly hand familiar to Johnson, and was witnessed by
  two men whose names he knew.</p>

  <p>He sat down and did not attempt to speak for a long time.</p>

  <p>"I read of the murder in the evening paper," he said after a while. "In
  fact, I've been up to the house, but the policemen referred me to you, and I
  knew you were too busy to be bothered. How was he killed?"</p>

  <p>"Shot," said Elk.</p>

  <p>"Have they caught the man?"</p>

  <p>"We shall have him by the morning," said Elk with confidence. "Now that
  we've taken Balder, there'll be nobody to warn the men we want."</p>

  <p>"It is very dreadful," said Johnson after a while. "But this,"&mdash;he
  looked at the paper&mdash;"this has quite knocked me out. I don't know what
  to say. Where was it found?"</p>

  <p>"In one of his deed boxes."</p>

  <p>"I wish he hadn't," said Johnson with emphasis. "I mean, left me his
  money. I hate responsibility. I'm temperamentally unfitted to run a big
  business...I wish he hadn't!"</p>

  <p>"How did he take it?" asked Dick when Elk had returned.</p>

  <p>"He's absolutely hazed. Poor devil, I felt sorry for him, and I never
  thought I should feel sorry for any man who came into money. He was just
  getting ready to move into a cheaper house when I arrived. I suppose he won't
  go to the Prince of Caux's mansion. The change in Johnson's prospects might
  make a difference to Ray Bennett: does that strike you, Captain Gordon?"</p>

  <p>"I thought of that possibility," said Dick shortly.</p>

  <p>He had an interview in the afternoon with the Director of Public
  Prosecutions in regard to Balder. And that learned gentleman echoed his own
  fears.</p>

  <p>"I can't see how we're going to get a verdict of murder against this man,
  although it is as plain as daylight that he poisoned Mills and was
  responsible for the bomb outrage. But you can't hang a man on suspicion, even
  though the suspicion is not open to doubt. How did he kill Mills, do you
  think?"</p>

  <p>"Mills had a cold," said Dick. "He had been coughing all the way up in the
  car, and had asked Balder to close the window of the room. Balder obviously
  closed, or nearly closed the window, and probably slipped a cyanide tablet to
  the man, telling him it was good for his cold. It was a fairly natural thing
  for Mills to take and swallow the tablet, and that, I am sure, is what
  happened. We made a search of Balder's house at Slough, and found a duplicate
  set of keys, including one to Elk's safe. Balder got there early in the
  morning and planted the bomb, knowing that Elk and I would be opening the
  bags that morning."</p>

  <p>"And helped Hagn to escape," said the Public Prosecutor.</p>

  <p>"That was much more simple," explained Dick. "I gather that the inspector
  who was seen walking out at half past two was Hagn. When Balder went into the
  cell to keep the man company; be must have been dressed underneath in the
  police uniform, and have carried the necessary handcuffs and pass-keys with
  him. He was not searched&mdash;a fact for which I am as much responsible as
  Elk: The chief danger we had to fear from Balder came from his closeness to
  us, and his ability to communicate immediately to his chief every movement
  which we made. His name is Kramer, and he is by birth a Lithuanian. He was
  expelled from Germany at the age of eighteen for his revolutionary
  activities, and came to this country two years later, where he joined the
  police. At what time he came into contact with the Frogs I do not know, but
  it is fairly clear, from evidence we have obtained, that the man has been
  engaged in various illegal operations for many years past. I'm afraid you are
  right about Balder: it will be immensely difficult to get a conviction until
  we have caught Frog himself."</p>

  <p>"And will you catch the Frog, do you think?"</p>

  <p>Dick Gordon smiled cryptically.</p>

  <p>No fresh news had come about the murder of Maitland and his sister, and he
  seized the opportunity which the lull gave to him. Ella Bennett was in the
  vegetable garden, engaged in the prosaic task of digging potatoes when he
  appeared, and she came running toward him, stripping her leather gloves.</p>

  <p>"This is a splendid surprise," she said, and flushed at the consciousness
  of her own enthusiasm. "Poor man, you must be having a terrible time! I saw
  the newspaper this morning. Isn't it dreadful about poor Mr. Maitland? He was
  here yesterday morning."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Is it true that Mr. Johnson has been left the whole of Maitland's money?
  Isn't that splendid!"</p>

  <p>"Do you like Johnson?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's a nice man," she nodded. "I don't know a great deal about him;
  indeed, I've only met him once or twice, but he was very kind to Ray, and
  saved him from getting into trouble. I am wondering whether, now that he is
  rich, he will induce Ray to go back to Maitlands."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he will induce you&mdash;" He stopped.</p>

  <p>"Induce me to what?" she asked in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Johnson is rather fond of you&mdash;he's never made any disguise of the
  fact, and he's a very rich man. Not that I think that would make any
  difference to you," he added hastily. "I'm not a very rich man, but I'm
  comfortably off."</p>

  <p>The fingers in his hand stole round his, and pressed them tightly, and
  then suddenly they relaxed.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said, and drew herself free.</p>

  <p>"Father said&mdash;" She hesitated. "I don't think father would like it.
  He thinks there is such a difference between our social positions."</p>

  <p>"Rats!" said Dick inelegantly.</p>

  <p>"And there's something else." She found it an effort to tell him what that
  something was. "I don't know what father does for a living, but it is...work
  that he never wishes to speak about; something that he looks upon as
  disgraceful."</p>

  <p>The last words were spoken so low that he hardly caught them.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I know the worst about your father?" he asked quietly, and she
  stood back, looking at him from under knit brows.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that? What is it, Dick?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I may know or I may not. It is only a wild guess. And you're not to tell
  him that I know, or that I'm in any way suspicious. Will you please do that
  for me?"</p>

  <p>"And knowing this, would it make any difference to you?"</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>She had plucked a flower, and was pulling it petal from petal in her
  abstraction.</p>

  <p>"Is it very dreadful?" she asked. "Has he committed a crime? No, no, don't
  tell me."</p>

  <p>Once more he was near her, his arm about her trembling shoulders, his hand
  beneath her chin.</p>

  <p>"My dear!" murmured the youthful Public Prosecutor, and forgot there was
  such a thing as murder in the world.</p>

  <p>John Bennett was glad to see him, eager to tell the news of his triumph.
  He had a drawer full of press cuttings, headed "Wonderful Nature Studies.
  Remarkable Pictures by an Amateur," and others equally flattering. And there
  had come to him a cheque which had left him gasping.</p>

  <p>"This means&mdash;you don't know what it means to me, Mr. Gordon," he
  said, "or Captain Gordon&mdash;I always forget you've got a military title.
  When that boy of mine recovers his senses and returns home, he's going to
  have just the good time he wants. He's at the age when most boys are
  fools&mdash;-what I call the showing-off age. Sometimes it runs to pimples
  and introspection, sometimes to the kind of life that a man doesn't like to
  look back on. Ray has probably taken the less vicious course."</p>

  <p>It was a relief to hear the man speak so. Dick always thought of Ray
  Bennett as one who had committed the unforgiveable sin.</p>

  <p>"This time next year I'm going to be an artist of leisure," said John
  Bennett, who looked ten years younger.</p>

  <p>Dick offered to drive him to town, but this he would not hear of. He had
  to make a call at Dorking. Apparently he had letters addressed to him in that
  town (Dick learnt of this from the girl) concerning his mysterious errands.
  Dick left Horsham with a heart lighter than he had broughtto that little
  country town, and was in the mood to rally Inspector Elk for the profound
  gloom which had settled on him since he had discovered that there was not
  sufficient evidence to try Balder for his life.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap30"
     id="chap30">XXX. &mdash; THE TRAMPS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Lew Brady sat disconsolately in Lola Bassano's pretty
  drawing-room, and a more incongruous figure in that delicate setting it was
  impossible to imagine. A week's growth of beard had transfigured him into the
  most unsavoury looking ruffian, and the soiled old clothes he wore, the
  broken and discoloured boots, the grimy shirt, no less than his own personal
  uncleanliness of appearance made him a revolting object.</p>

  <p>So Lola thought, eyeing him anxiously, a foreboding of trouble in her
  heart.</p>

  <p>"I'm finished with the Frog," growled Brady. "He pays&mdash;of course he
  pays! But how long is it going on, Lola? You brought me into this!" He
  glowered at her.</p>

  <p>"I brought you in, when you wanted to be brought into something," she said
  calmly. "You can't live on my savings all your life, Lew, and it was nearly
  time you made a little on the side."</p>

  <p>He played with a silver seal, twiddling it between his fingers, his eyes
  gloomily downcast.</p>

  <p>"Balder's caught, and the old man's dead," he said. "They're the big
  people. What chance have I got?"</p>

  <p>"What were your instructions, Lew?" she asked for the twentieth time that
  day.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm taking no risks, Lola. I don't trust anybody, not even you."</p>

  <p>He took a small bottle from his pocket and examined it.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Dope of some kind."</p>

  <p>"Is that part of the instructions too?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Are you going in your own name?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not," he snapped. "Don't ask questions. I'm not going to tell you
  anything, see? This trip's going to last a fortnight, and when it's finished,
  I'm finished with Frog."</p>

  <p>"The boy&mdash;is he going with you?"</p>

  <p>"How do I know? I'm to meet somebody somewhere, and that's all about it."
  He looked at the clock and rose with a grunt. "It's the last time I shall sit
  in a decent parlour for a fortnight." He gave a curt nod and walked to the
  door.</p>

  <p>There was a servants' entrance, a gallery which was reached through the
  kitchen, and he passed down the stairs unobserved, into the night.</p>

  <p>It was dark by the time he reached Barnet; his feet were aching; he was
  hot and wretched. He had suffered the indignity of being chased off the
  pavement by a policeman he could have licked with one hand, and he cursed the
  Frog with every step he took. There was still a long walk ahead of him once
  he was clear of Barnet; and it was not until a village clock was striking the
  hour of eleven that he ambled up to a figure that was sitting on the side of
  the road, just visible in the pale moonlight, but only recognizable when he
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Is that you?" said a voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's me. You're Carter aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" gasped Ray as he recognized the voice.</p>

  <p>"It's Lew Brady!"</p>

  <p>"It's nothing of the kind!" snarled the other man. "My name's Phenan.
  Yours is Carter. Sit down for a bit. I'm dead beat."</p>

  <p>"What is the idea?" asked the youth as they sat side by side.</p>

  <p>"How the devil do I know?" said the other savagely as, with a tender
  movement, he slipped off his boots and rubbed his bruised feet.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea it was you," said Ray.</p>

  <p>"I knew it was you, all right," said the other. "And why I should be
  called upon to take a mug around this country, God knows!"</p>

  <p>After a while he was rested sufficiently to continue the tramp.</p>

  <p>"There's a barn belonging to a shopkeeper in the next village. He'll let
  us sleep there for a few pence."</p>

  <p>"Why not try to get a room?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," snapped Lew. "Who's going to take in a couple of
  tramps, do you think? We know we're clean, but they don't. No, we've got to
  go the way the tramps go.</p>

  <p>"Where? To Nottingham?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. If they told you Nottingham, I should say that's the last
  place in the world we shall go to. I've got a sealed envelope in my pocket.
  When we reach Baldock I shall open it."</p>

  <p>They slept that night in the accommodating barn&mdash;a draughty shed,
  populated, it seemed, by chickens and rats, and Ray had a restless night and
  thought longingly of his own little bed at Maytree Cottage. Strangely enough,
  he did not dwell on the more palatial establishment in Knightsbridge.</p>

  <p>The next day it rained, and they did not reach Baldock until late in the
  afternoon, and, sitting down under the cover of a hedge, Brady opened the
  envelope and read its contents, his companion watching him expectantly.</p>

  <p>"You will branch from Baldock and take the nearest G.W. train for Bath.
  Then by road to Gloucester. At the village of Laverstock you will reveal to
  Carter the fact that you are married to Lola Bassano. You should take him to
  the <i>Red Lion</i> for this purpose, and tell him as offensively as possible
  in order to force a quarrel, but in no circumstances are you to allow him to
  part company from you. Go on to Ibbley Copse. You will find an open space
  near where three dead trees stand, and there you will stop, take back the
  statement you made that you are married to Lola, and make an apology. You are
  carrying with you a whisky flask; you must have the dope and the whisky
  together at this point. After he is asleep, you will make your way to
  Gloucester, to 289 Hendry Street, where you will find a complete change of
  clothing. Here you will shave and return to town by the 2.19."</p>

  <p>Every word, every syllable, he read over and over again, until he had
  mastered the details. Then, striking a match, he set fire to the paper and
  watched it burn.</p>

  <p>"What are the orders?" asked Ray.</p>

  <p>"The same as yours, I suppose. What did you do with yours?"</p>

  <p>"Burnt them," said Ray. "Did he tell you where we're going?"</p>

  <p>"We are going to take the Gloucester Road; I thought we should. That means
  striking across country till we reach the Bath Road. We can take a train to
  Bath."</p>

  <p>"Thank goodness for that!" said Ray fervently. "I don't feel I can walk
  another step."</p>

  <p>At seven o'clock that night, two tramps turned out of a third-class
  carriage on Bath station. One, the younger, was limping slightly, and sat
  down on a station seat.</p>

  <p>"Come on, you can't stay here," said the other gruffly. "We'll get a bed
  in the town. There's a Salvation Army shelter somewhere in Bath."</p>

  <p>"Wait a bit," said the other. "I'm so cramped with sitting in that
  infernal carriage that I can hardly move."</p>

  <p>They had joined the London train at Reading, and the passengers were
  pouring down the steps to the subway. Ray looked at them enviously. They had
  homes to go to, clean and comfortable beds to sleep in. The thought of it
  gave him a pain. And then he saw a figure and shrank back. A tall, angular
  man, who carried a heavy box in one hand and a bag in the other.</p>

  <p>It was his father.</p>

  <p>John Bennett went down the steps, with a casual glance at the two
  unsavoury tramps on the seat, never dreaming that one was the son whose
  future he was at that moment planning.</p>

  <p>John Bennett spent an ugly night, and an even more ugly early morning. He
  collected the camera where he had left it, at a beerhouse on the outskirts of
  the town, and, fixing the improvised carrier, he slipped the big box on his
  back, and, with his bag in his hand, took the road. A policeman eyed him
  disapprovingly as he passed, and seemed in two minds as to whether or not he
  should stop him, but refrained. The strength and stamina of this grey man
  were remarkable. He breasted a hill and, without slackening his pace, reached
  the top, and strode steadily along the white road that was cut in the face of
  the hill. Below him stretched the meadow lands of Somerset, vast fields
  speckled with herds, glittering streaks of light where the river wound; above
  his head a blue sky, flecked white here and there. As he walked, the load on
  his heart was absorbed. All that was bright and happy in life came to him.
  His hand strayed to his waistcoat pocket mechanically. There were the
  precious press cuttings that he had brought from town and had read and
  re-read in the sleepless hours of the night.</p>

  <p>He thought of Ella, and all that Ella meant to him, and of Dick
  Gordon&mdash;but that made him wince, and he came back to the comfort of his
  pictures. Somebody had told him that there were badgers to be seen; a man in
  the train had carefully located a veritable paradise for the lover of Nature;
  and it was toward this beauty spot that he was making his way with the aid of
  a survey map which he had bought overnight at a stationer's shop.</p>

  <p>Another hour's tramp brought him to a wooden hollow, and, consulting his
  map, he found he had reached his objective. There was ample evidence of the
  truth that his chance-found friend had told him. He saw a stoat, flying on
  the heels of a terrified rabbit; a hawk wheeled ceaselessly on stiff pinions
  above him; and presently he found the "run" he was looking for, the artfully
  concealed entrance to a badger's lair.</p>

  <p>In the years he had been following his hobby he had overcome many
  difficulties, learnt much. To-day, failure had taught him something of the
  art of concealment. It took him time to poise and hide the camera in a bush
  of wild laurel, and even then it was necessary that he should take a long
  shot, for the badger is the shyest of its kind. There were young ones in the
  lair: he saw evidence of that; and a badger who has young is doubly shy.</p>

  <p>He had replaced the pneumatic attachment which set the camera moving, by
  an electrical contrivance, and this enabled him to work with greater surety.
  He unwound the long flex and laid it to its fullest extent, taking a position
  on the slope of the hill eighty yards away, making himself comfortable.
  Taking off his coat, which acted as a pillow on which his arms rested, he put
  his field-glasses near at hand.</p>

  <p>He had been waiting half an hour when he thought he saw a movement at the
  mouth of the burrow, and slowly focussed his glasses. It was the tip of a
  black nose he saw, and he took the switch of the starter in his hand, ready
  to set the camera revolving. Minutes followed minutes;
  five&mdash;ten&mdash;fifteen&mdash; but there was no further movement in the
  burrow, and in a dull way John Bennett was glad, because the warmth of the
  day, combined with his own weariness and his relaxed position, brought to him
  a rare sensation of bodily comfort and well-being. Deeper and deeper grew the
  languorous haze of comfort that fell on him like a fog, until it obscured all
  that was visible and audible. John Bennett slept, and, sleeping, dreamed of
  success and of peace and of freedom from all that had broken his heart, and
  had dried up the sweet waters of life within him. In his dream he heard
  voices and a sharp sound, like a shot. But he knew it was not a shot, and
  shivered. He knew that "crack," and in his sleep clenched his hands
  convulsively. The electric starter was still in his hand.</p>

  <p>* * * * * *</p>

  <p>At nine o'clock that morning there had come into Laverstock two limping
  tramps, though one limped more than the other. The bigger of the two stopped
  at the door of the <i>Red Lion</i>, and an unfriendly landlord surveyed the
  men over the top of the curtain which gave the habitués of the bar a
  semi-privacy.</p>

  <p>"Come in," growled Lew Brady.</p>

  <p>Ray was glad to follow. The landlord's bulk blocked the entrance to the
  bar.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I want a drink."</p>

  <p>"There's no free drinks going in this parish," said the landlord, looking
  at the unpromising customer.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get that 'free drink' stuff from?" snarled Lew. "My money's
  as good as anybody else's, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"If it's honestly come by," said the landlord. "Let us have a look at
  it."</p>

  <p>Lew pulled out a handful of silver, and the master of the Red Lion stood
  back.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he said, "but don't make a home of my bar. You can have your
  drink and go."</p>

  <p>Lew growled the order, and the landlord poured out the two portions of
  whisky.</p>

  <p>"Here's yours, Carter," said Lew, and Ray swallowed the fiery dram and
  choked.</p>

  <p>"I'll be glad to get back," said Lew in a low voice. "It's all right for
  you single men, but this tramping is pretty tough on us fellows who've got
  wives&mdash;even though the wives aren't all they might be."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you were married," said Ray, faintly interested.</p>

  <p>"There's a lot you don't know," sneered the other. "Of course I'm married.
  You were told once, and you hadn't the brains to believe it."</p>

  <p>Ray looked at the man open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean&mdash;what Gordon said?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded.</p>

  <p>"You mean that Lola is your wife?"</p>

  <p>"Why, certainly she's my wife," said Lew coolly. "I don't know how many
  husbands she's had, but I'm her present one."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!"</p>

  <p>Ray whispered the words.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you? And take that look off your face," said Lew
  Brady viciously. "I'm not blaming you for being sweet on her. I like to see
  people admire my wife, even such kids as you."</p>

  <p>"Your wife!" said Ray again. He could not believe the man was speaking the
  truth. "Is she&mdash;is she a Frog?"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't she be?" said Brady. "And keep your voice down, can't you?
  That fat old devil behind the counter is trying hard to listen. Of course
  she's Frog, and she's crook. We're all crooks. You're crook too. That's the
  way with Lola, she likes the crooks best. Perhaps you'll have a chance, after
  you've done a job or two&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You beast!" hissed Ray, and struck the man full in the face.</p>

  <p>Before Lew Brady could come to his feet, the landlord was between
  them.</p>

  <p>"Outside, both of you!" he shouted, and, dashing to the door, roared half
  a dozen names. He was back in time to see Lew Brady on his feet, glaring at
  the other.</p>

  <p>"You'll know all about that, Mr. Carter, one of these days," he said.
  "I'll settle with you!"</p>

  <p>"And, by God, I'll settle with you!" said Ray furiously, and at that
  moment a brawny ostler caught him by the arm and flung him into the road
  outside.</p>

  <p>He waited for Brady to come out.</p>

  <p>"I've finished with you," he said. His face was white, his voice was
  quivering. "Finished with the whole rotten shoot of you! I'm going back."</p>

  <p>"You're not going back," said Lew. "Oh, listen, boy, what's making you
  mad? We've got to go on to Gloucester, and we might as well finish our job.
  And if you don't want to be with me after that&mdash;well, you can go ahead
  just as you like."</p>

  <p>"I'm going alone," said Ray.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool." Lew Brady came after him and seized his arm.</p>

  <p>For a second the situation looked ugly to the onlookers, and then, with a
  shrug, Ray Bennett suffered the arm to remain.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you," he said&mdash;the first words he spoke for half an
  hour after they had left the <i>Red Lion</i>. "Why should you have lied?"</p>

  <p>"I've got sick of your good temper, that's the whole truth, Ray&mdash;
  just sick to death of it. I had to make you mad, or I'd have gone mad
  myself."</p>

  <p>"But is it true about Lola?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it's not true," lied Brady contemptuously. "Do you think she'd
  have anything to do with a chap like me? Not likely! Lola's a good girl.
  Forget all I said, Ray."</p>

  <p>"I shall ask her myself. She wouldn't lie to me," said the boy.</p>

  <p>"Of course she wouldn't lie to you," agreed the other.</p>

  <p>They were nearing their rendezvous now&mdash;the tree-furred cut in the
  hills&mdash;and his eyes were searching for the three white trunks that the
  lightning had struck. Presently he saw them.</p>

  <p>"Come on in, and I'll tell you all about it," he said. "I'm not going to
  walk much farther to-day. My feet are so raw you couldn't cook 'em!"</p>

  <p>He led the way between the trees, over the age-old carpet of pine needles,
  and presently he stopped.</p>

  <p>"Sit down here, boy," he said, "and let us have a drink and a smoke."</p>

  <p>Ray sat with his head on his hands, a figure so supremely miserable that
  any other man than Lew Brady would have felt sorry for him.</p>

  <p>"The whole truth is," began Lew slowly, "that Lola's very strong for you,
  boy."</p>

  <p>"Then why did you tell me the other thing? Who was that?" He looked
  round.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Lew. His own nerves were on edge.</p>

  <p>"I thought I heard somebody moving."</p>

  <p>"A twig broke. Rabbits, it may be; there are thousands of 'em round here,"
  said Lew. "No, Lola's a good girl." He fished from his pocket a flask, pulled
  off the cup at the bottom and unscrewed the stopper, holding the flask to the
  light. "She's a good girl," he repeated, "and may she never be anything
  else."</p>

  <p>He poured out a cupful, looked at the remainder in the bottle.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to drink her health, No, you drink first."</p>

  <p>Ray shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't like the stuff," he said. The other man laughed.</p>

  <p>"For a fellow who's been pickled night after night, that's certainly an
  amusing view to take," he said. "If you can't hold a dram of whisky for the
  sake of drinking Lola's health, well, you re a poor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Give it to me." Ray snatched the cup, but spilt a portion, and, drinking
  down the contents at a draught, he threw the metal holder to his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Ugh! I don't care for that whisky. I don't think I care for any whisky at
  all. There's nothing harder to pretend you like than drinking, if you don't
  happen to like it."</p>

  <p>"I don't think anybody likes it at first," said Lew. "It's like
  tomatoes&mdash;a cultivated taste."</p>

  <p>He was watching his companion keenly.</p>

  <p>"Where do we go from Gloucester?" asked Ray.</p>

  <p>"We don't go anywhere from Gloucester. We just stop there for a day, and
  then we change and come back."</p>

  <p>"It's a stupid idea," said Ray Bennett, screwing up his eyes and yawning.
  "Who is this Frog, Lew?" He yawned again, lay back on the grass, his hands
  under his head.</p>

  <p>Lew Brady emptied the remainder of the flask's contents upon the grass,
  screwed up the stopper and shook the cup before he rose and walked across to
  the sleeping boy.</p>

  <p>"Hi, get up!" he said.</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>"Get up, you!"</p>

  <p>With a groan, Ray turned over, his head on his arms, and did not move
  again. A sudden misgiving came to Lew Brady. Suppose he was dead? He went
  livid at the thought. That quarrel, so cleverly engineered by the Frog, would
  be enough to convict him. He whipped the flask from his pocket and slipped it
  into the coat pocket of the sleeper. And then he heard a sound, and, turning,
  saw a man watching him. Lew stared, opened his mouth to speak, and:</p>

  <p><i>"Plop!"</i></p>

  <p>He saw the flash of the flame before the bullet struck him. He tried to
  open his mouth to speak, and:</p>

  <p><i>"Plop!"</i></p>

  <p>Lew Brady was dead before he touched the ground.</p>

  <p>The man removed the silencer of the pistol, walked leisurely across to
  where Ray Bennett was sleeping, and put the pistol by his hand. Then he came
  back and turned over the body of the dead man, looking down into the face.
  Taking one of three cigars from his waistcoat pocket, he lit it, being
  careful to put the match in the box whence he had taken it. He liked smoking
  cigars&mdash;especially other men's cigars. Then, without haste, he walked
  back the way he had come, gained the main road after a careful
  reconnaissance, and reached the car he had left by the roadside.</p>

  <p>Inside the car a youth was sitting in the shelter of the curtained hood,
  loose-mouthed, glassy-eyed, staring at nothing. He wore an ill-fitting suit
  and one end of his collar was unfastened.</p>

  <p>"You know this place, Bill?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir." The voice was guttural and hoarse. "Ibbley Copse."</p>

  <p>"You have just killed a man: you shot him, just as you said you did in
  your confession."</p>

  <p>The half-witted youth nodded.</p>

  <p>"I killed him because I hated him," he said.</p>

  <p>The Frog nodded obediently and got into the driver's seat...</p>

  <p>John Bennett woke with a start. He looked at the damp bell-push in his
  hand with a rueful smile, and began winding up the flex. Presently he reached
  the bush where the camera was concealed, and, to his dismay, found that the
  indicator showed the loss&mdash;for loss it was&mdash;of five hundred feet.
  He looked at the badger hole resentfully, and there, as in mockery, he saw
  again the tip of a black nose, and shook his fist at it. Beyond, he saw two
  men lying, both asleep, and both, apparently, tramps.</p>

  <p>He carried the camera back to where he had left his coat, put it on,
  hoisted the box into position and set off for Laverstock village, where, if
  his watch was right, he could catch the local that would connect him with
  Bath in time for the London express; and as he walked, he calculated his
  loss.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap31"
     id="chap31">XXXI. &mdash; THE CHEMICAL CORPORATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Elk had promised to dine at Gordon's club. Dick waited for
  him until twenty minutes past the hour of appointment, and Elk had neither
  telephoned nor put in an appearance. At twenty-five minutes past he arrived
  in a hurry.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he gasped, looking at the clock. "I had no idea it was so
  late, Captain. I must buy a watch."</p>

  <p>They went into the dining-hall together, and Elk felt that he was entering
  a church, there was such solemn dignity about the stately room, with its prim
  and silent diners.</p>

  <p>"It certainly has Heron's beat in the matter of Dicky-Orum."</p>

  <p>"I don't know the gentleman," said the puzzled Dick. "Oh, do you mean
  decorum? Yes, this is a little more sedate. What kept you, Elk? I'm not
  complaining, but when you're not on time, I worry as to what has happened to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Nothing has happened to me," said Elk, nodding pleasantly to an
  embarrassed club waiter. "Only we had an inquiry in Gloucester. I thought
  we'd struck another Frog case, but the two men involved had no Frog
  marks."</p>

  <p>"Who are they?"</p>

  <p>"Phenan is one&mdash;he's the man that's dead."</p>

  <p>"A murder?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," said Elk, spearing a sardine. "I think he was thoroughly
  dead when they found him at Ibbley Copse. They pinched the man who was with
  him; he was drunk. Apparently they'd been to Laverstock and had quarrelled
  and fought in the bar of the Red Lion. The police were informed later, and
  telephoned through to the next village, to tell the constable to keep his eye
  on these two fellows, but they hadn't passed through, so they sent a bicycle
  patrol to look for them&mdash;there's been one or two housebreakings in that
  neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"And they found them?"</p>

  <p>Elk nodded.</p>

  <p>"One man dead and the other man bottled. Apparently they'd quarrelled, and
  the drunken gentleman shot the other. They're both tramps or of that class.
  Identification marks on them show they've come from Wales. They slept at Bath
  last night, at Rooney's lodging-house, and that's all that's known of 'em.
  Carter is the murderer&mdash;they've taken him to Gloucester Gaol. It's a
  very simple case, and the Gloucester police gave a haughty smile at the idea
  of calling in Headquarters. It is a crime, anyway, that is up to the
  intellectual level of the country police."</p>

  <p>Dick's lips twitched.</p>

  <p>"Just now, the country police are passing unpleasant comments on our
  intelligence," he said.</p>

  <p>"Let 'um," scoffed Elk. "Those people are certainly entitled to their
  simple pleasures, and I'd be the last to deny them the right. I saw John
  Bennett in town to-night, at Paddington this time. I'm always knocking
  against him at railway stations. That man is certainly a traveller. He had
  his old camera with him too. I spoke to him this time, and he's full of
  trouble; went to sleep, pushed the gadget in his dreams and wasted a fortune
  in film. But he's pleased with himself, and I don't wonder. I saw a note
  about his pictures the other day in one of the newspapers. He looks like
  turning into a first-class success."</p>

  <p>"I sincerely hope so," said Dick quietly, and something in his tone made
  his guest look up.</p>

  <p>"Which reminds me," he said, "that I had a note from friend Johnson asking
  me whether I knew Ray Bennett's address. He said he called up Heron's Club,
  but-Ray hadn't been there for days. He wants to give him a job. Quite a big
  position, too. There's a lot that's very fine in Johnson."</p>

  <p>"Did you give the address?"</p>

  <p>Elk nodded.</p>

  <p>"I gave him the address, and I called on the boy, but he's out of
  town&mdash;went out a few days ago, and is not likely to be back for a
  fortnight. It will be too bad if he loses this job. I think Johnson was sore
  with the side young Bennett put on, but he doesn't seem to bear any malice.
  Perhaps there's another influence at work," he said significantly.</p>

  <p>Dick knew that he meant Ella, but did not accept the opening.</p>

  <p>They adjourned to the smoke-room after dinner, and whilst Elk puffed
  luxuriously at one of his host's best cigars, Dick wrote a brief note to the
  girl, who had been in his thoughts all that day. It was an unnecessary note,
  as such epistles are liable to be; but it might have had, as its excuse, the
  news that he had heard from Elk, only, for some reason, he never thought of
  that until after the letter was finished and sealed. When he turned to his
  companion, Elk propounded a theory.</p>

  <p>"I sent a man up to look at some chemical works. It's a fake
  company&mdash;less than a dozen hands employed, and those only occasionally.
  But it has a very powerful electrical installation. It is an old poison gas
  factory. The present company bought it for a song, and two fellows we are
  holding were the nominal purchasers."</p>

  <p>"Where is it?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"Between Newbury and Didcot. I found out a great deal about them for a
  curious reason. It appears there was some arrangement between the factory,
  when it was under Government control, that it should make an annual
  contribution to the Newbury Fire Brigade, and, in taking over the property,
  the company also took over that contract, which they're now trying to get out
  of, for the charge is a stiff one. They told the Newbury Brigade, in so many
  words, to disconnect the factory from their alarm service, but the Newbury
  Brigade, being on a good thing and having lost money by the arrangement
  during the war, refused to cancel the contract, which has still three years
  to run."</p>

  <p>Dick was not interested in the slightest degree in the quarrel between the
  chemical factory and the fire brigade. Later, he had cause to be thankful
  that conversation had drifted into such a prosaic channel; but this he could
  not foresee.</p>

  <p>"Yes, very remarkable," he said absent-mindedly.</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>A fortnight after the disappearance from town of Ray Bennett, Elk accepted
  the invitation of the American to lunch. It was an invitation often given,
  and only accepted now because there had arisen in Elk's mind a certain doubt
  about Joshua Broad&mdash;a doubt which he wished to mould into assurance.</p>

  <p>Broad was waiting for the detective when he arrived, and Elk, to whom time
  had no particular significance, arrived ten minutes late.</p>

  <p>"Ten minutes after one," said Elk. "I can't keep on time anyhow. There's
  been a lot of trouble at the office over the new safe they've got me.
  Somethin's wrong with it, and even the lock-maker doesn't know what it
  is."</p>

  <p>"Can't you open it?"</p>

  <p>"That's just it, I can't, and I've got to get some papers out to-day that
  are mighty important," said Elk. "I was wondering, as I came along, whether,
  having such a wide experience of the criminal classes, you've ever heard any
  way by which it could be opened&mdash;it needs a proper engineer, and, if I
  remember rightly, you told me you were an engineer once, Mr. Broad?"</p>

  <p>"Your memory is at fault," said the other calmly as he unfolded his napkin
  and regarded the detective with a twinkle in his eye. "Safe-opening is not my
  profession."</p>

  <p>"And I never dreamt it was," said Elk heartily. "But it has always struck
  me that the Americans are much more clever with their hands than the people
  in this country, and I thought that you might be able to give me a word of
  advice."</p>

  <p>"Maybe I'll introduce you to my pet burglar," said Broad gravely, and they
  laughed together. "What do you think of me?" asked the American unexpectedly.
  "I'm not expecting you to give your view of my character or personal
  appearance, but what do you think I am doing in London, dodging around, doing
  nothing but a whole lot of amateur police work?"</p>

  <p>"I've never given you much thought," said Elk untruthfully. "Being an
  American, I expect you to be out of the ordinary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Flatterer," murmured Mr. Broad.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't go so far as to flatter you," protested Elk. "Flattery is
  repugnant to me anyway."</p>

  <p>He unfolded an evening newspaper he had brought. "Looking for those
  tailless amphibians?"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Elk looked up puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Frogs," explained the other.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not exactly looking for Frogs, though I understand a few of 'em
  are looking for me. As a matter of fact, there's very little in the newspaper
  about those interesting animals, but there's going to be!"</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>The question was a challenge.</p>

  <p>"When we get Frog Number One."</p>

  <p>Mr. Broad crumpled a roll in his hand, and broke it.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you'll get Number One before I get him?" he asked quietly,
  and Elk looked across the table over his spectacles.</p>

  <p>"I've been wondering that for a long time," he said, and for a second
  their eyes met.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I shall get him?" asked Broad.</p>

  <p>"If all my speculations and surmises are what they ought to be, I think
  you will," said Elk, and suddenly his attention was focussed upon a
  paragraph. "Quick work," he said. "We beat you Americans in that
  respect."</p>

  <p>"In what respect is that?" asked Broad. "I'm sufficient of a cosmopolitan
  to agree that there are many things in England which you do better than we in
  America."</p>

  <p>Elk looked up at the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"Fifteen days?" he said. "Of course, he just managed to catch the
  Assizes."</p>

  <p>"Who's that?"</p>

  <p>"That man Carter, who shot a tramp near Gloucester," said Elk.</p>

  <p>"What has happened to him?" asked the other.</p>

  <p>"He was sentenced to death this morning," said the detective.</p>

  <p>Joshua Broad frowned.</p>

  <p>"Sentenced to death this morning? Carter, you say? I didn't read the story
  of the murder."</p>

  <p>"There was nothing complicated about it," said Elk. "Two tramps had a
  quarrel&mdash;I think they got drinking&mdash;and one shot the other and was
  found lying in a drunken sleep by the dead man's side. There's practically no
  evidence; the prisoner refused to make any statement, or to instruct a
  lawyer&mdash;it must have been one of the shortest murder trials on
  record."</p>

  <p>"Where did this happen?" asked Broad, arousing himself from the reverie
  into which he had fallen.</p>

  <p>"Near Gloucester. There was little in the paper; it wasn't a really
  interesting murder. There was no woman in it, so far as the evidence went,
  and who cared a cent about two tramps?"</p>

  <p>He folded the paper and put it down, and for the rest of the meal was
  engaged in a much more fascinating discussion, the police methods of the
  United States, on which matter Mr. Broad was, apparently, something of an
  authority.</p>

  <p>The object of the American's invitation was very apparent. Again and again
  he attempted to turn the conversation to the man under arrest; and as
  skilfully as he introduced the subject of Balder, did Elk turn the discussion
  back to the merits of the third degree as a method of crime detection.</p>

  <p>"Elk, you're as close as an oyster," said Broad, beckoning a waiter to
  bring his bill. "And yet I could tell you almost as much about this man
  Balder as you know."</p>

  <p>"Tell me the prison he's in?" demanded Elk.</p>

  <p>"He's in Pentonville, Ward Seven, Cell Eighty-four," said the other
  immediately, and Elk sat bolt upright. "And you needn't trouble to shift him
  to somewhere else, just because I happen to know his exact location; I should
  be just as well informed if he was at Brixton, Wandsworth, Holloway, Wormwood
  Scrubbs, Maidstone, or Chelmsford."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap32"
     id="chap32">XXXII. &mdash; IN GLOUCESTER PRISON</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There is a cell in Gloucester Prison; the end cell in a long
  corridor of the old building. Next door is another cell, which is never
  occupied, for an excellent reason. That in which Ray Bennett sat was
  furnished more expensively than any other in the prison. There was an iron
  bedstead, a plain deal table, a comfortable Windsor chair and two other
  chairs, on one of which, night and day, sat a warder.</p>

  <p>The walls were distempered pink. One big window, near the ceiling, heavily
  barred, covered with toughened opaque glass, admitted light, which was
  augmented all the time by an electric globe in the arched ceiling.</p>

  <p>Three doors led from the cell: one into the corridor, the other into a
  little annexe fitted with a washing-bowl and a bath; the third into the
  unoccupied cell, which had a wooden floor, and in the centre of the floor a
  square trap. Ray Bennett did not know then how close he was to the death
  house, and if he had known he would not have cared. For death was the least
  of the terrors which oppressed him.</p>

  <p>He had awakened from his drugged sleep, to find himself in the cell of a
  country lock-up, and had heard, bemused, the charge of murder that had been
  made against him. He had no clear recollection of what had happened. All that
  he knew was that he had hated Lew Brady and that he had wanted to kill him.
  After that, he had a recollection of walking with him and of sitting down
  somewhere.</p>

  <p>They told him that Brady was dead, and that the weapon with which the
  murder was committed had been found in his hand. Ray had racked his brains in
  an effort to remember whether he had a revolver or not. He must have had. And
  of course he had been drugged. They had had whisky at the Red Lion, and Lew
  must have said something about Lola and he had shot him. It was strange that
  he did not think longingly of Lola. His love for her had gone. He thought of
  her as he thought of Lew Brady, as something unimportant that belonged to the
  past. All that mattered now was that his father and Ella should not know. At
  all costs the disgrace must be kept from them. He had waited in a fever of
  impatience for the trial to end, so that he might get away from the public
  gaze. Fortunately, the murder was not of sufficient interest even for the
  ubiquitous press photographers. He wanted to be done with it all, to go out
  of life unknown. The greatest tragedy that could occur to him was that he
  should be identified.</p>

  <p>He dared not think of Ella or of his father. He was Jim Carter, without
  parents or friends; and if he died as Jim Carter, he must spend his last days
  of life as Jim Carter. He was not frightened; he had no fear, his only
  nightmare was that he should be recognized.</p>

  <p>The warder who was with him, and who was not supposed to speak to him, had
  told him that, by the law, three clear Sundays must elapse between his
  sentence and execution. The chaplain visited him every day, and the Governor.
  A tap at the cell door told him it was the Governor's hour, and he rose as
  the grey-haired official came in.</p>

  <p>"Any complaints, Carter?"</p>

  <p>"None, sir."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything you want?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>The Governor looked at the table. The writing-pad, which had been placed
  for the condemned prisoner's use, had not been touched.</p>

  <p>"You have no letters to write? I suppose you can write?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I've no letters to write."</p>

  <p>"What are you, Carter? You're not an ordinary tramp. You're better
  educated than that class."</p>

  <p>"I'm an ordinary tramp, sir," said Ray quietly.</p>

  <p>"Have you all the books you need?"</p>

  <p>Ray nodded, and the Governor went out. Every day came these inevitable
  inquiries. Sometimes the Governor made reference to his friends, but he grew
  tired of asking questions about the unused blotting-pad.</p>

  <p>Ray Bennett had reached the stage of sane understanding where he did not
  even regret. It was inevitable. He had been caught up in the machinery of
  circumstance, and must go slowly round to the crashing-place. Every morning
  and afternoon he paced the square exercise yard, watched by three men in
  uniform, and jealously screened from the observation of other prisoners; and
  his serenity amazed all who saw him. He was caught up in the wheel and must
  go the full round. He could even smile at himself, observe his own vanity
  with the eye of an outsider. And he could not weep, because there was nothing
  left to weep about. He was already a dead man. Nobody troubled to organize a
  reprieve for him; he was too uninteresting a murderer. The newspapers did not
  flame into headlines, demanding a new trial. Fashionable lawyers would not
  foregather to discuss an appeal. He had murdered; he must die.</p>

  <p>Once, when he was washing, and was about to put his hand in the water, he
  saw the reflection of his face staring back at him, and he did not recognize
  himself, for his beard had grown weedily. He laughed, and when the wondering
  warders looked at him, he said:</p>

  <p>"I'm only now beginning to cultivate a sense of humour&mdash;-I've left it
  rather late, haven't I?"</p>

  <p>He could have had visitors, could have seen anybody he wished, but derived
  a strange satisfaction from his isolation. He had done with all that was
  artificial and emotional in life. Lola? He thought of her again and shook his
  head. She was very pretty. He wondered what she would do now that Lew was
  dead; what she was doing at that moment. He thought, too, of Dick Gordon,
  remembered that he liked him that day when Dick had given him a ride in his
  big Rolls. How queerly far off that seemed! And yet it could have only been a
  few months ago.</p>

  <p>One day the Governor came in a more ceremonial style, and with him was a
  gentleman whom Ray remembered having seen in the court-house on the day of
  the trial. It was the Under Sheriff, and there was an important communication
  to be made. The Governor had to clear his throat twice.</p>

  <p>"Carter," he said a little unsteadily, "the Secretary of State has
  informed me that he sees no reason for interfering with the course of the
  law. The High Sheriff has fixed next Wednesday morning at eight o'clock as
  the date and hour of your execution."</p>

  <p>Ray inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," he said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap33"
     id="chap33">XXXIII. &mdash; THE FROG OF THE NIGHT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">John Bennett emerged from the wood-shed, which he had
  converted into a dark room, bearing a flat square box in either hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk to me for a minute, Ella," he said as she rose from her
  knees&mdash;she was weeding her own pet garden&mdash;"or I shall get these
  blamed things mixed. This one"&mdash;he shook his right hand&mdash;"is a
  picture of trout, and it is a great picture," he said enthusiastically. "The
  man who runs the trout farm, let me take it through the glass side of the
  trench, and it was a beautifully sunny day."</p>

  <p>"What is the other one, daddy?" she asked, and John Bennett pulled a
  face.</p>

  <p>"That is the dud," he said regretfully. "Five hundred feet of good film
  gone west! I may have got a picture by accident, but I can't afford to have
  it developed on the off-chance. I'll keep it by, and one day, when I'm
  rolling in money, I'll go to the expense of satisfying my curiosity."</p>

  <p>He took the boxes into the house, and turned round to his stationery rack
  to find two adhesive labels, and had finished writing them, when Dick
  Gordon's cheery voice came through the open window. He rose eagerly and went
  out to him.</p>

  <p>"Well, Captain Gordon, did you get it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I got it," said Dick solemnly, waving an envelope. "You're the first
  cinematographer that has been allowed in the Zoological Gardens, and I had to
  crawl to the powers that be to secure the permission!"</p>

  <p>The pale face of John Bennett flushed with pleasure.</p>

  <p>"It is a tremendous thing," he said. "The Zoo has never been put on the
  pictures, and Selinski has promised me a fabulous sum for the film if I can
  take it."</p>

  <p>"The fabulous sum is in your pocket, Mr. Bennett," said Dick, "and I am
  glad that you mentioned it."</p>

  <p>"I am under the impression you mentioned it first," said John Bennett.
  Ella did not remember having seen her father smile before.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I did," said Dick cheerfully. "I knew you were interested in
  animal photography."</p>

  <p>He did not tell John Bennett that it was Ella who had first spoken about
  the difficulties of securing Zoo photographs and her father's inability to
  obtain the necessary permission.</p>

  <p>John Bennett went back to his labelling with a lighter heart than he had
  borne for many a day. He wrote the two slips, wetted the gum and hesitated.
  Then he laid down the papers and went into the garden.</p>

  <p>"Ella, do you remember which of those boxes had the trout in?"</p>

  <p>"The one in your right hand, daddy," she said.</p>

  <p>"I thought so," he said, and went to finish his work.</p>

  <p>It was only after the boxes were labelled that he had any misgivings.
  Where had he stood when he put them down? On which side of the table? Then,
  with a shrug, he began to wrap the trout picture, and they saw him carrying
  it under his arm to the village post-office.</p>

  <p>"No news of Ray?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head.</p>

  <p>"What does your father think?"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't talk about Ray, and I haven't emphasized the fact that it is
  such a long time since I had a letter."</p>

  <p>They were strolling through the garden toward the little summer-house that
  John Bennett had built in the days when Ray was a schoolboy.</p>

  <p>"You have not heard?" she asked. "I credit you with an omniscience which
  perhaps isn't deserved. You have not found the man who killed Mr.
  Maitland?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Dick. "I don't expect we shall until we catch Frog
  himself."</p>

  <p>"Will you?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he can't go on for ever. Even Elk is taking a cheerful view. Ella,"
  he asked suddenly, "are you the kind of person who keeps a promise?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"In all circumstances, if you make a promise, do you keep it?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course. If I do not think I can keep it, I do not make a promise.
  Why?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I want you to make me a promise&mdash;and to keep it," he said.</p>

  <p>She looked past him, and then:</p>

  <p>"It depends what the promise is."</p>

  <p>"I want you to promise to be my wife," said Dick Gordon.</p>

  <p>Her hand lay in his, and she did not draw it from him.</p>

  <p>"It is...very...businesslike, isn't it?" she said, biting her unruly
  underlip.</p>

  <p>"Will you promise?"</p>

  <p>She looked round at him, tears in her eyes, though her lips were smiling,
  and he caught her in his arms.</p>

  <p>John Bennett waited a long time for his lunch that day. Going out to see
  where his daughter was, he met Dick, and in a few words Dick Gordon told him
  all. He saw the pain in the man's face, and dropped his hand upon the broad
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Ella has promised me, and she will not go back on her promise. Whatever
  happens, whatever she learns."</p>

  <p>The man raised his eyes to the other's face.</p>

  <p>"Will you go back on your promise?" he asked huskily. "Whatever you
  learn?"</p>

  <p>"I know," said Dick simply.</p>

  <p>Ella Bennett walked on air that day. A new and splendid colour had come
  into her life; a tremendous certainty which banished all the fears and doubts
  she had felt; a light which revealed delightful vistas.</p>

  <p>Her father went over to Dorking that afternoon, and came back hurriedly,
  wearing that strained look which it hurt her to see.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to go to town, dearie," he said. "There's been a letter
  waiting for me for two days. I've been so absorbed in my picture work that
  I'd forgotten I had any other responsibility."</p>

  <p>He did not look for her in the garden to kiss her goodbye, and when she
  came back to the house he was gone, and in such a hurry that he had not taken
  his camera with him.</p>

  <p>Ella did not mind being alone; in the days when Ray was at home, she had
  spent many nights in the cottage by herself, and the house was on the main
  road. She made some tea and sat down to write to Dick, though she told
  herself reprovingly that he hadn't been gone more than two or three hours.
  Nevertheless, she wrote, for the spirit of logic avoids the lover.</p>

  <p>There was a postal box a hundred yards up the road; it was a bright night
  and people were standing at their cottage gates, gossipping, as she passed.
  The letter dropped in the box, she came back to the cottage, went inside,
  locked and bolted the door, and sat down with a work-basket by her side to
  fill in the hour which separated her from bedtime.</p>

  <p>So working, her mind was completely occupied, to the exclusion of all
  other thoughts, by Dick Gordon. Once or twice the thought of her father and
  Ray strayed across her mind, but it was to Dick she returned.</p>

  <p>The only illumination in the cosy dining-room was a shaded kerosene lamp
  which stood on the table by her side and gave her sufficient light for her
  work. All outside the range of the lamp was shadow. She had finished darning
  a pair of her father's socks, and had laid down the needle with a happy sigh,
  when her eyes went to the door leading to the kitchen. It was ajar, and it
  was opening slowly.</p>

  <p>For a moment she sat paralysed with terror, and then leapt to her
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Who's there?" she called.</p>

  <p>There came into the shadowy doorway a figure, the very sight of which
  choked the scream in her throat. It looked tall, by reason of the
  tightly-fitting black coat it wore. The face and head were hidden behind a
  hideous mask of rubber and mica. The reflection of the lamp shone on the big
  goggles and filled them with a baleful fire.</p>

  <p>"Don't scream, don't move!" said the masked man, and his voice sounded
  hollow and far away. "I will not hurt you."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she managed to gasp.</p>

  <p>"I am The Frog," said the stranger.</p>

  <p>For an eternity, as it seemed, she stood helpless, incapable of movement,
  and it was he who spoke.</p>

  <p>"How many men love you, Ella Bennett?" he asked. "Gordon and
  Johnson&mdash;and The Frog, who loves you most of all!"</p>

  <p>He paused, as though he expected her to speak, but she was incapable of
  answering him.</p>

  <p>"Men work for women, and they murder for women, and behind all that they
  do, respectably or unrespectably, there is a woman," said the Frog. "And you
  are that woman for me, Ella."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" she managed to say.</p>

  <p>"I am The Frog," he replied again, "and you shall know my name when I have
  given it to you. I want you! Not now "&mdash;he raised his hand as he saw the
  terror rising in her face. "You shall come to me willingly."</p>

  <p>"You're mad!" she cried. "I do not know you. How can I&mdash;oh, it's too
  wicked to suggest...please go away."</p>

  <p>"I will go presently," said the Frog. "Will you marry me Ella?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Will you marry me, Ella?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"No." She had recovered her calm and something of her self-possession.</p>

  <p>"I will give you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you gave me all the money there was in the world, I would not marry
  you," she said.</p>

  <p>"I will give you something more precious." His voice was softer, scarcely
  audible. "I will give you a life!"</p>

  <p>She thought he was speaking of Dick Gordon.</p>

  <p>"I will give you the life of your brother."</p>

  <p>For a second the room spun round and she clutched a chair to keep her
  feet.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I will give you the life of your brother, who is lying in Gloucester Gaol
  under sentence of death!" said the Frog. With a supreme effort Ella guided
  herself to a chair and sat down.</p>

  <p>"My brother?" she said dully. "Under sentence of death?"</p>

  <p>"To-day is Monday," said the Frog. "On Wednesday he dies. Give me your
  word that when I send for you, you will come, and I will save him."</p>

  <p>"How can you save him?" The question came mechanically.</p>

  <p>"A man has made a confession&mdash;a man named Gill, a half-witted fellow
  who thinks he killed Lew Brady."</p>

  <p>"Brady?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>The Frog nodded.</p>

  <p>"It isn't true," she breathed. "You're lying! You're telling me this to
  frighten me."</p>

  <p>"Will you marry me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Never, never!" she cried. "I would rather die. You are lying to me."</p>

  <p>"When you want me, send for me," said the Frog. "Put in your window a
  white card, and I will save your brother."</p>

  <p>She half lay on the table, her head upon her folded arms.</p>

  <p>"It's not true, it's not true," she muttered.</p>

  <p>There was no reply, and, looking up, she saw that the room was empty.
  Staggering to her feet, she went out into the kitchen. The kitchen door was
  open; and, peering into the dark garden, she saw no sign of the man. She had
  strength to bolt the door, and dragged herself up to her room and to her bed,
  and then she fainted.</p>

  <p>Daylight showed in the windows when she sat up. She was painfully weary,
  her eyes were red with weeping, her head was in a whirl. It had been a night
  of horror&mdash;and it was not true, it could not be true. She had heard of
  no murder; and if there had been, it could not be Ray. She would have known;
  Ray would have sent for her father.</p>

  <p>She dragged her aching limbs to the bathroom and turned the cold-water
  tap. Half an hour later she was sane, and looking at her experience
  dispassionately. Ray was alive. The man had tried to frighten her. Who was
  he? She shivered.</p>

  <p>She saw only one solution to her terrible problem, and after she had made
  herself a cup of tea, she dressed and walked down into the town, in time to
  catch an early train. What other thought came to her, she never dreamt for
  one moment of surrender, never so much as glanced at the window where a white
  card could be placed, might save the life of her brother. In her heart of
  hearts, she knew that this man would not have come to her with such a story
  unless it was well founded. That was not the Frog's way. What advantage would
  he gain if he had invented this tragedy? Nevertheless, she did not even look
  for a white card, or think of its possible use.</p>

  <p>Dick was at breakfast when she arrived, and a glance at her face told him
  that she brought bad news.</p>

  <p>"Don't go, Mr. Elk," she said as the inspector pushed back his chair. "You
  must know this."</p>

  <p>As briefly as she could, she narrated the events of the night before, and
  Dick listened with rising wrath until she came to the climax of the
  story.</p>

  <p>"Ray under sentence?" he said incredulously. "Of course it isn't
  true."</p>

  <p>"Where did he say the boy was?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>"In Gloucester Prison."</p>

  <p>In their presence her reserve had melted and she was near to tears.</p>

  <p>"Gloucester Prison?" repeated Elk slowly. "There is a man there under
  sentence of death, a man named,"&mdash;-he strove to remember&mdash;"Carter,"
  he said at last. "That is it&mdash;Carter, a tramp. He killed another tramp
  named Phenan."</p>

  <p>"Of course it isn't Ray," said Dick, laying his hand on hers. "This brute
  tried to frighten you. When did he say the execution had been fixed for?</p>

  <p>"To-morrow." She was weeping; now that the tension had relaxed, it seemed
  that she had reached the reserve of her strength.</p>

  <p>"Ray is probably on the Continent," Dick soothed her, and here Elk thought
  it expedient and delicate to steal silently forth.</p>

  <p>He was not as convinced as Gordon that the Frog had made a bluff. No
  sooner was he in his office than he rang for his new clerk.</p>

  <p>"Records," he said briefly. "I want particulars of a man named Carter, now
  lying under sentence of death in Gloucester Prison&mdash;photograph,
  finger-prints, and record of the crime."</p>

  <p>The man was gone ten minutes, and returned with a small portfolio.</p>

  <p>"No photograph has been received yet, sir," he said. "In murder cases we
  do not get the full records from the County police until after the
  execution."</p>

  <p>Elk cursed the County police fluently, and addressed himself to the
  examination of the dossier. That told him little or nothing. The height and
  weight of the man tallied, he guessed, with Ray's. There were no body marks
  and the description "Slight beard."</p>

  <p>He sat bolt upright. Slight beard! Ray Bennett had been growing a beard
  for some reason. He remembered that Broad had told him this.</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!" he said, throwing down the finger-print card. "It is
  impossible!"</p>

  <p>It was impossible, and yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>He drew a telegraph pad toward him and wrote a wire.</p>

  <p>"Governor, H.M. Prison, Gloucester. Very urgent. Send by special messenger
  prison photograph of James Carter under sentence of death in your prison to
  Headquarters Records. Messenger must leave by first train. Very urgent."</p>

  <p>He took the liberty of signing it with the name of the Chief Commissioner.
  The telegram despatched, he returned to a scrutiny of the description sheet,
  and presently he saw a remark which he had overlooked.</p>

  <p>"Vaccination marks on right forearm."</p>

  <p>That was unusual. People are usually vaccinated on the left arm, a little
  below the shoulder. He made a note of this fact and turned to the work that
  was waiting for him. At noon a wire arrived from Gloucester, saying that the
  photograph was on its way. That, at least, was satisfactory; though, even if
  it proved to be Ray, what could be done? In his heart Elk prayed most
  fervently that the Frog had bluffed.</p>

  <p>Just before one, Dick telephoned him and asked him to lunch with them at
  the Auto Club, an invitation which, in any circumstances, was not to be
  refused, for Elk had a passion for visiting other people's clubs.</p>

  <p>When he arrived&mdash;on this occasion strictly on time&mdash;he found the
  girl in a calm, even a cheerful mood, and his quick eye detected upon her
  finger a ring of surprising brilliance that he had not seen before. Dick
  Gordon had made very good use of his spare time that morning.</p>

  <p>"I feel I'm neglecting my business, Elk," he said after he had led them
  into the palatial dining-room of the Auto, and had found a cushion for the
  girl's back, and had placed her chair exactly where it was least comfortable,
  "but I guess you've got through the morning without feeling my loss."</p>

  <p>"I certainly have," said Elk. "A very interesting morning. There is a
  smallpox scare in the East End," he went on, "and I've heard some talk at
  Headquarters of having the whole staff vaccinated. If there's one thing that
  I do not approve of, it is vaccination. At my time of life I ought to be
  immune from any germ that happens to be going round."</p>

  <p>The girl laughed.</p>

  <p>"Poor Mr. Elk! I sympathize with you. Ray and I had a dreadful time when
  we were vaccinated about five years ago during the big epidemic, although I
  didn't have so bad a time as Ray. And neither of us had such an experience as
  the majority of victims, because we had an excellent doctor, with unique
  views on vaccination."</p>

  <p>She pulled back the sleeve of her blouse and showed three tiny scars on
  the underside of the right forearm.</p>

  <p>"The doctor said he would put it where it wouldn't show. Isn't that a good
  idea?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Elk slowly. "And did he vaccinate your brother the same
  way?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and then:</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, Mr. Elk?"</p>

  <p>"I swallowed an olive stone," said Elk. "I wonder somebody doesn't start
  cultivating olives without stones." He looked out of the window. "You've got
  a pretty fine day for your visit, Miss Bennett," he said, and launched forth
  into a rambling condemnation of the English climate.</p>

  <p>It seemed hours to Elk before the meal was finished. The girl was going
  back to Gordon's house to look at catalogues which Dick had ordered to be
  sent to Harley Terrace by telephone.</p>

  <p>"You won't be coming to the office?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>"No: do you think it is necessary?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted to see you for ten minutes," drawled the other, "perhaps a
  quarter of an hour."</p>

  <p>"Come back to the house."</p>

  <p>"Well, I wasn't thinking of coming back to the house," said Elk. "Perhaps
  you've got a lady's drawing-room. I remember seeing one as I came through the
  marble hall, and Miss Bennett would not mind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course not," she said. "If I'm in the way, I'll do anything you
  wish. Show me your lady's drawing room."</p>

  <p>When Dick had come back, the detective was smoking, his elbows on the
  table, his thin, brown hands clasped under his chin, and he was examining,
  with the eye of a connoisseur, the beautifully carved ceiling.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble, Elk?" said Gordon as he sat down.</p>

  <p>"The man under sentence of death is Ray Bennett," said Elk without
  preliminary.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap34"
     id="chap34">XXXIV. &mdash; THE PHOTO-PLAY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dick's face went white.</p>

  <p>"How do you know this?"</p>

  <p>"Well, there's a photograph coming along; it will be in London this
  afternoon; but I needn't see that. This man under sentence has three
  vaccination marks on the right forearm."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence.</p>

  <p>"I wondered why you turned the talk to vaccination," said Dick quietly. "I
  ought to have known there was something in it. What can we do?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what you can't do," said Elk. "You can't let that girl
  know. For good and sufficient reasons, Ray Bennett has decided not to reveal
  his identity, and he must pass out. You're going to have a rotten afternoon,
  Captain Gordon," said Elk gently, "and I'd rather be me than you. But you've
  got to keep up your light-hearted chatter, or that young woman is going to
  guess that something is wrong."</p>

  <p>"My God! How dreadful!" said Dick in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is," admitted Elk, "and we can do nothing. We've got to accept it
  as a fact that he's guilty. If you thought any other way, it would drive you
  mad. And even if he was as innocent as you or I, what chance have we of
  getting an inquiry or stopping the sentence being carried into
  execution?"</p>

  <p>"Poor John Bennett!" said Dick in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>"If you're starting to get sentimental," snarled Elk, blinking furiously,
  "I'm going into a more practical atmosphere. Good afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Wait. I can't face this girl for a moment. Come back to the house with
  me."</p>

  <p>Elk hesitated, and then grudgingly agreed.</p>

  <p>Ella could not guess, from their demeanour, the horror that was in the
  minds of these men. Elk fell back upon history and dates&mdash;a prolific and
  a favourite subject.</p>

  <p>"Thank heaven those catalogues have arrived!" said Dick, as, with a sigh
  of relief, he saw the huge pile of literature on his study table.</p>

  <p>"Why 'thank heaven'?" she smiled.</p>

  <p>"Because his conscience is pricking him, and he wants an excuse for
  working." Elk came to the rescue.</p>

  <p>The strain was one which even he found almost insupportable; and when,
  after a pleading glance at the other, Dick nodded, he got up with a sense of
  holiday.</p>

  <p>"I'll be going now, Miss Bennett," he said. "I expect you'll be busy all
  the afternoon furnishing your cottage. I must come down and see it," he went
  on, wilfully dense. "Though it struck me that there wouldn't be much room for
  new furniture at Maytree."</p>

  <p>So far he got when he heard voices in the hall&mdash;the excited voice of
  a woman, shrill, insistent, hysterical. Before Dick could get to the door, it
  was flung open, and Lola rushed in.</p>

  <p>"Gordon! Gordon! Oh, my God!" she sobbed. "Do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said Dick, but the girl was beside herself.</p>

  <p>"They've got Ray! They're going to hang him! Lew's dead."</p>

  <p>The mischief was done. Ella came slowly to her feet, rigid with fear.</p>

  <p>"My brother?" she asked, and then Lola saw her for the first time and
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"I found out," she sobbed. "I had a suspicion, and I wrote...I've got a
  photograph of Phenan. I knew it was Lew at once, and I guessed the rest. The
  Frog did it! He planned it; months in advance he planned it. I'm not sorry
  about Lew; I swear I'm not sorry about Lew! It's the boy. I sent him to his
  death, Gordon&mdash;" And then she broke into a fit of hysterical
  sobbing.</p>

  <p>"Put her out," said Gordon, and Elk lifted the helpless girl in his arms
  and carried her into the dining-room.</p>

  <p>"True!" Ella whispered the word, and Dick nodded. "I'm afraid it's true,
  Ella."</p>

  <p>She sat down slowly.</p>

  <p>"I wonder where I can find father," she said, as calmly as though she were
  discussing some everyday event.</p>

  <p>"You can do nothing. He knows nothing. Do you think it is kind to tell
  him?"</p>

  <p>She searched his face wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"I think you're right. Of course you're right, Dick. I'm sure you're
  right. Father mustn't know. Couldn't I see him&mdash;Ray, I mean?"</p>

  <p>Dick shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Ella, if Ray has kept silent to save you from this, all his forbearance,
  all his courage will be wasted if you go to him."</p>

  <p>Again her lips drooped.</p>

  <p>"Yes. It is good of you to think for me." She put her hand on his, and he
  felt no tremor. "I don't know what I can do," she said. "It is so&mdash;
  stunning. What can I do?"</p>

  <p>"You can do nothing, my dear." His arm went round her and her tired head
  fell upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"No, I can do nothing," she whispered.</p>

  <p>Elk came in.</p>

  <p>"A telegram for Miss Bennett," he said. "The messenger just arrived with
  it. Been redirected from Horsham, I expect."</p>

  <p>Dick took the wire.</p>

  <p>"Open it, please," said the girl. "It may be from father."</p>

  <p>He tore open the envelope. The telegram ran:</p>

  <p>"Have printed your picture. Cannot understand the murder. Were you trying
  take photo-play? Come and see me. Silenski House, Wardour Street."</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is Greek to me," said Dick. "'Cannot understand murder'&mdash;has your
  father been trying to take photo-plays?"</p>

  <p>"No, dear, I'm sure he hasn't; he would have told me."</p>

  <p>"What photographs did your father take?"</p>

  <p>"It was a picture of trout," she said, gathering her scattered thoughts;
  "but he took another picture&mdash;in his sleep. He was in the country
  waiting for a badger, and dozed. He must have pressed the starter; he thought
  that picture was a failure. It can't be the trout; it doesn't mention the
  trout; it must be the other."</p>

  <p>"We will go to Wardour Street."</p>

  <p>It was Elk who spoke so definitely, Elk who called a cab and hustled the
  two people into it. When they arrived at Wardour Street, Mr. Silenski was out
  at lunch, and nobody knew anything whatever about the film, or had authority
  to show it.</p>

  <p>For an hour and a half they waited, fuming, in that dingy office, whilst
  messengers went in search of Silenski. He arrived at last, a polite and
  pleasant little Hebrew, who was all apologies, though no apology was called
  for, since he had not expected his visitors.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is a curious picture," he said. "Your father, miss, is a very
  good amateur; in fact, he's a professional now; and if it is true that he can
  get these Zoo photographs, he ought to be in the first rank of nature
  photographers."</p>

  <p>They followed him up a flight of stairs into a big room across which were
  row upon row of chairs. Facing them as they sat was a small white screen, and
  behind them an iron partition with two square holes.</p>

  <p>"This is our theatre," he explained. "You've no idea whether your father
  is trying to take motion pictures&mdash;I mean photo-plays? If he is, then
  this scene was pretty well acted, but I can't understand why he did it. It's
  labelled 'Trout in a Pond' or something of the sort, but there are no trout
  here, and there is no pond either!"</p>

  <p>There was a click, and the room went black; and then there was shown on
  the screen a picture which showed in the foreground a stretch of grey, sandy
  soil, and the dark opening of a burrow, out of which peeped a queer-looking
  animal.</p>

  <p>"That's a badger," explained Mr. Silenski. "It looked very promising up to
  there, and then I don't know what he did. You'll see he changed the elevation
  of the camera."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the picture jerked round a little to the right, as though it
  had been pulled violently. And they were looking upon two men, obviously
  tramps. One was sitting with his head on his hands, the other, close by him,
  was pouring out whisky into a container.</p>

  <p>"That's Lew Brady," whispered Elk fiercely, and at that moment the other
  man looked up, and Ella Bennett uttered a cry.</p>

  <p>"It is Ray! Oh, Dick, it is Ray!"</p>

  <p>There was no question of it. The light beard he wore melted into the
  shadows which the strong sunlight cast.</p>

  <p>They saw Brady offer him a drink, saw him toss it down and throw the cup
  back to the man; watched him as his arms stretched in a yawn; and then saw
  him curl up to sleep, lie back, and Lew Brady standing over him. The
  prostrate figure turned on to its face, and Lew, stooping, put something in
  his pocket. They caught the reflection of glass.</p>

  <p>"The flask," said Elk.</p>

  <p>And then the figure standing in the centre of the picture spun round.
  There walked toward him a man. His face was invisible. Never once during that
  period did he turn his face to that eager audience.</p>

  <p>They saw his arm go up quickly, saw the flash of the two shots, watched
  breathless, spellbound, horrified, the tragedy that followed.</p>

  <p>The man stooped and placed the pistol by the side of the sleeping Ray, and
  then, as he turned, the screen went white.</p>

  <p>"That's the end of the picture," said Mr. Silenski. "And what it means,
  heaven knows."</p>

  <p>"He's innocent! Dick, he's innocent!" the girl cried wildly. "Don't you
  see, it was not he who fired?"</p>

  <p>She was half-mad with grief and terror, and Dick caught her firmly by the
  shoulders, the dumbfounded Silenski gaping at the scene.</p>

  <p>"You are going back to my house and you will <i>read</i>! Do you hear,
  Ella? You're to do nothing until you hear from me. You are not to go out; you
  are to sit and read! I don't care what you read&mdash;the Bible, the Police
  News, anything you like. But you must not think of this business. Elk and I
  will do all that is possible."</p>

  <p>She mastered her wild terror and tried to smile.</p>

  <p>"I know you will," she said between her chattering teeth. "Get me to your
  house, please."</p>

  <p>He left Elk to go to Fleet Street to collect every scrap of information
  about the murder he could from the newspaper offices, and brought the girl
  back to Harley Terrace. As he got out of the cab, he saw a man waiting on the
  steps. It was Joshua Broad. One glance at his face told Dick that he knew of
  the murder, and he guessed the source.</p>

  <p>He waited in the hall until Dick had put the girl in the study, and had
  collected every illustrated newspaper, every book he could find.</p>

  <p>"Lola told me of this business."</p>

  <p>"I guessed so," said Dick. "Do you know anything about it?"</p>

  <p>"I knew these two men started out in the disguise of tramps," said Broad,
  "but I understood they were going north. This is Frog work&mdash;why?</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Yes, I do," Dick said suddenly. "The Frog came to Miss
  Bennett last night and asked her to marry him, promising that he would save
  her brother if she agreed. But it can hardly be that he planned this
  diabolical trick to that end."</p>

  <p>"To no other end," said Broad coolly. "You don't know Frog, Gordon! The
  man is a strategist&mdash;probably the greatest strategist in the world. Can
  I do anything?"</p>

  <p>"I would ask you to stay and keep Miss Bennett amused&mdash;" Dick
  began.</p>

  <p>"I think you might do worse," said the American quietly.</p>

  <p>Ella looked up with a look of pain as the visitor entered the room. She
  felt that she could not endure the presence of a stranger at this moment,
  that she would break under any new strain, and she glanced at Dick
  imploringly.</p>

  <p>"If you don't want me to stay, Miss Bennett," smiled Broad, "well, I'll go
  just as soon as you tell me. But I've one piece of information to pass to
  you, and it is this: that your brother will not die."</p>

  <p>His eyes met Dick Gordon's, and the Prosecutor bit his lip to restrain the
  cry that came involuntarily.</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked eagerly, but neither of the men could tell her.</p>

  <p>Dick telephoned to the garage for his car, the very machine that Ray
  Bennett had driven the first day they had met. His first call was at the
  office of the Public Prosecutor, and to him he stated the facts.</p>

  <p>"It is a most remarkable story, and I can do nothing, of course. You'd
  better see the Secretary of State at once, Gordon."</p>

  <p>"Is the House of Commons sitting, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I've an idea that the Secretary, who is the only man that can do
  anything for you&mdash;is out of town. He may be on the Continent. I'm not
  sure. There was a conference at San Remo last week, and I've a dim notion
  that he went there."</p>

  <p>Dick's heart almost stood still.</p>

  <p>"Is there nobody else at the Home Office who could help?"</p>

  <p>"There is the Under Secretary: you'd better see him."</p>

  <p>The Public Prosecutor's Department was housed in the Home Office building,
  and Dick went straight away in search of the responsible official. The
  permanent secretary, to whom he explained the circumstances, shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we can do nothing now, Gordon," he said, "and the Secretary of
  State is in the country and very ill."</p>

  <p>"Where is the Under Secretary?" asked Dick desperately.</p>

  <p>"He's at San Remo."</p>

  <p>"How far out of town is Mr. Whitby's house?"</p>

  <p>The official considered.</p>

  <p>"About thirty miles&mdash;this side of Tunbridge Wells," and Dick wrote
  the address on a slip of paper.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later, a long yellow Rolls was flying across Westminster
  Bridge, threading the traffic with a recklessness which brought the hearts of
  hardened chauffeurs to their mouths; and forty minutes after he had left
  Whitehall, Dick was speeding up an elm-bordered avenue to the home of the
  Secretary of State.</p>

  <p>The butler who met him could give him no encouragement.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid Mr. Whitby cannot see you, sir. He has a very bad attack of
  gout, and the doctors have told him that he mustn't touch any kind of
  business whatever.</p>

  <p>"This is a matter of life and death," said Dick, "and I must see him. Or,
  failing him, I must see the King."</p>

  <p>This message, conveyed to the invalid, produced an invitation to walk
  upstairs.</p>

  <p>"What is it, sir?" asked the Minister sharply as Dick came in. "I cannot
  possibly attend to any business whatever. I'm suffering the tortures of the
  damned with this infernal foot of mine. Now tell me, what is it?"</p>

  <p>Quickly Gordon related his discovery.</p>

  <p>"An astounding story," said the Minister, and winced. "Where is the
  picture?"</p>

  <p>"In London, sir."</p>

  <p>"I can't come to London: it is humanly impossible. Can't you get somebody
  at the Home Office to certify this? When is this man to be hanged?</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning, sir, at eight o'clock."</p>

  <p>The Secretary of State considered, rubbing his chin irritably. "I should
  be no man if I refused to see this damned picture," he said, and Dick made
  allowance for his language as he rubbed his suffering limb. "But I can't go
  to town unless you get me an ambulance. You had better 'phone a garage in
  London to send a car down, or, better still, get one from the local
  hospital."</p>

  <p>Everything seemed to be conspiring against him, for the local hospital's
  ambulance was under repair, but at last Dick put through a message to town,
  with the promise that an ambulance would be on its way in ten minutes.</p>

  <p>"An extraordinary story, a perfectly amazing story! And of course, I can
  grant you a respite. Or, if I'm convinced of the truth of this astounding
  romance, we could get the King to-night; I could even promise you a reprieve.
  But my death will lie at your door if I catch cold."</p>

  <p>Two hours passed before the ambulance came. The chauffeur had had to
  change his tyres twice on the journey. Very gingerly, accompanied by furious
  imprecations from the Cabinet Minister, his stretcher was lifted into the
  ambulance.</p>

  <p>To Dick the journey seemed interminable. He had telephoned through to
  Silenski, asking him to keep his office open until his arrival. It was eight
  o'clock by the time the Minister was assisted up to the theatre, and the
  picture was thrown upon the screen.</p>

  <p>Mr. Whitby watched the drama with the keenest interest, and when it was
  finished he drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"That's all right so far as it goes," he said, "but how do I know this
  hasn't been play-acted in order to get this man a reprieve? And how am I to
  be sure that this wretched tramp is your man?"</p>

  <p>"I can assure you of that, sir," said Elk. "I got the photograph up from
  Gloucester this afternoon."</p>

  <p>He produced from his pocket-book two photographs, one in profile and one
  full-face, and put them on the table before the Minister.</p>

  <p>"Show the picture again," he ordered, and again they watched the
  presentation of the tragedy. "But how on earth did the man manage to take
  this picture?"</p>

  <p>"I've since discovered, sir, that he was in the neighbourhood on that very
  day. He went out to get a photograph of a badger&mdash;I know this, sir,
  because Mr. Silenski has given me all the information in his power."</p>

  <p>Mr. Whitby looked up at Dick.</p>

  <p>"You're in the Public Prosecutor's Department? I remember you very well,
  Captain Gordon. I must take your word. This is not a matter for respite, but
  for reprieve, until the whole of the circumstances are investigated."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," said Dick, wiping his streaming forehead.</p>

  <p>"You'd better take me along to the Home Office," grumbled the great man.
  "To-morrow I shall be cursing your name and memory, though I must confess
  that I'm feeling better for the drive. I want that picture."</p>

  <p>They had to wait until the picture was replaced in its box, and then Dick
  Gordon and Elk assisted the Secretary of State to the waiting ambulance.</p>

  <p>At a quarter-past eight, a reprieve, ready for the Royal counter-
  signature, was in Dick's hand, and the miracle, which Mr. Whitby had not
  dared expect, had happened. He was able, with the aid of a stick, to hobble
  to a car. Before the great Palace, streams of carriages and motor-cars were
  passing. It was the night of the first ball of the season, and the hall of
  the Palace was a brilliant sight. The glitter of women's jewels, the scarlet,
  blue and green of diplomatic uniforms, the flash of innumerable Orders, no
  less than the organization of this gorgeous gathering, interested Dick as he
  stood, a strangely contrasting figure, watching the pageant pass him.</p>

  <p>The Minister had disappeared into an ante-room and presently came back and
  crooked his finger; Dick followed him down a red-carpeted passage past
  white-haired footmen in scarlet and gold, until they came to a door, before
  which another footman stood. A whispered word, the footman knocked, and a
  voice bade them enter. The servant opened the door and they went in.</p>

  <p>The man who was sitting at the table rose. He wore the scarlet uniform of
  a general; across his breast was the blue ribbon of the Garter. There was in
  his eyes a kindliness and humanity which Dick had not imagined he would
  find.</p>

  <p>"Will you be seated? Now please tell me the story as quickly as you can,
  because I have an appointment elsewhere, and punctuality is the politeness of
  princes," he smiled.</p>

  <p>He listened attentively, stopping Gordon now and again to ask a question.
  When Dick had finished, he took up a pen and wrote a word in a bold, boyish
  hand, blotted it punctiliously and handed it to the Secretary of State.</p>

  <p>"There is your reprieve. I am very glad," he said, and Dick, bowing over
  the extended hand, felt the music of triumph in his soul, forgot for the
  moment the terrible danger in which this boy had stood; and forgot, too, the
  most important factor of all&mdash;the Frog, still vigilant, still vengeful,
  still powerful!</p>

  <p>When he got back to the Home Office and had taken farewell, with a very
  earnest expression of gratitude, of the irascible, but kindly Minister, Dick
  flew up the stairs to his own office and seized the telephone.</p>

  <p>"Put me through to Gloucester 8585 Official," he said, and waited for the
  long-distance signal.</p>

  <p>It came after a few minutes.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, sir, no call through to Gloucester. Line out of order. Trunk wires
  cut."</p>

  <p>Dick put down the 'phone slowly. Then it was that he remembered that the
  Frog still lived.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap35"
     id="chap35">XXXV. &mdash; GETTING THROUGH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When Elk came up to the Prosecutor's room, Dick was sitting
  at the table, writing telegrams. They were each addressed to the Governor of
  Gloucester Prison, and contained a brief intimation that a reprieve for James
  Carter was on its way. Each was marked via a different route.</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?" said Elk.</p>

  <p>"The 'phone to Gloucester is out of order," said Dick, and Elk bit his lip
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" he drawled. "Then if the 'phone's out of order&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't want to think that," said Dick.</p>

  <p>Elk took up the instrument.</p>

  <p>"Give me the Central Telegraph Office, miss," he said. "I want to speak to
  the Chief Clerk...Yes, Inspector Elk, C.I.D."</p>

  <p>After a pause, he announced himself again.</p>

  <p>"We're putting some wires through to Gloucester. I suppose the lines are
  all right?"</p>

  <p>His face did not move a muscle while he listened, then:</p>

  <p>"I see," he said. "Any roundabout route we can get? What's the nearest
  town open?" A wait. "Is that so? Thank you."</p>

  <p>He put down the instrument.</p>

  <p>"All wires to Gloucester are cut. The trunk wire has been cut in three
  places; the connection with Birmingham, which runs in an earthenware pipe
  underground, has been blown up, also in three places." Dick's eyes
  narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Try the Radio Company," he said. "They've got a station at Devizes, and
  another one somewhere near Cheltenham, and they could send on a message."</p>

  <p>Again Elk applied himself to the telephone.</p>

  <p>"Is that the Radio Station? Inspector Elk, Headquarters Police, speaking.
  I want to get a message through to Gloucester, to Gloucester Prison,
  via&mdash;eh?...But I thought you'd overcome that difficulty. How long has it
  been jammed?...Thank you," he said, and put down the telephone for the second
  time.</p>

  <p>"There's a jam," he said. "No messages are getting through. The radio
  people say that somebody in this country has got a secret apparatus which was
  used by the Germans during the war, and that when the jam is on, it is
  impossible to get anything through."</p>

  <p>Dick looked at his watch. It was now half-past nine.</p>

  <p>"You can catch the ten-five for Gloucester, Elk, but somehow I don't think
  it will get through."</p>

  <p>"As a telephone expert," said Elk, as he patiently applied himself to the
  instrument, "I have many of the qualities that make, so to speak, for
  greatness. Hullo! Get me Great Western, please. Great Western
  Stationmaster...I have a perfect voice, a tremendous amount of patience, and
  a faith in my fellow-man, and&mdash;Hullo! Is that you,
  Stationmaster?...Inspector Elk. I told you that before&mdash;no, it was
  somebody else. Inspector Elk, C.I.D. Is there any trouble on your road to-
  night?"...A longer pause this time. "Glory be!" said Elk unemotionally. "Any
  chance of getting through?...None whatever? What time will you have trains
  running?...Thank you."</p>

  <p>He turned to Dick.</p>

  <p>"Three culverts and a bridge down at Swindon, blown at seven o'clock; two
  men in custody; one man dead, shot by rail guard. Two culverts down at
  Reading; the metals blown up at Slough. I won't trouble to call up the other
  roads, because&mdash;well, the Frog's thorough."</p>

  <p>Dick Gordon opened a cupboard and took out a leather coat and a soft
  leather helmet. In his drawer he found two ugly-looking Browning pistols and
  examined their magazines before he slipped them into his pocket. Then he
  selected half-a-dozen cigars, and packed them carefully in the breast pocket
  of the coat.</p>

  <p>"You're not going alone, Gordon?" asked Elk sternly. Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm going alone," he said. "If I don't get through, you follow. Send a
  police car after me and tell them to drive carefully. I don't think they'll
  stop me this side of Newbury," he said. "I can make that before the light
  goes. Tell Miss Bennett that the reprieve is signed, and that I am on my
  way."</p>

  <p>Elk said nothing, but followed his chief into the street, and stood by him
  with the policeman who had been left in charge of the car, while Dick made a
  careful scrutiny of the tyres and petrol tank.</p>

  <p>So Dick Gordon took the Bath road; and the party of gunmen that waited at
  the two aerodromes of London to shoot him down if he attempted to leave by
  the aerial route, waited in vain. He avoided the direct road to Reading, and
  was taking the longer way round. He came into Newbury at eleven o'clock, and
  learnt of more dynamited culverts. The town was full of it. Two laden trains
  were held up on the down line, and their passengers thronged the
  old-fashioned streets of the town. Outside The Chequers he spoke to the local
  inspector of police. Beyond the outrages they had heard nothing, and
  apparently the road was in good order, for a car had come through from
  Swindon only ten minutes before Dick arrived.</p>

  <p>"You're safe as far as Swindon, anyway," said the inspector. "The
  countryside has been swarming with tramps lately, but my mounted patrols,
  that have just come in, have seen none on the roads."</p>

  <p>A thought struck Dick, and he drove the inspector round to the
  police-station and went inside with him.</p>

  <p>"I want an envelope and some official paper," he said, and, sitting down
  at the desk, he made a rough copy of the reprieve with its quaint
  terminology, sealed the envelope with wax and put it into his pocket. Then he
  took the real reprieve, and, taking off his shoe and sock, put it between his
  bare foot and his sock. Replacing his shoe, he jumped on to the car and
  started his cautious way toward Didcot. Both his glare lamps were on, and the
  road before him was as light as day. Nevertheless, he went at half speed, one
  of his Brownings on the cushion beside him.</p>

  <p>Against the afterglow of the sunset, a faint, pale light which is the
  glory of late summer, he saw three inverted V's and knew they were the ends
  of a building, possibly an aerodrome. And then he remembered that Elk had
  told him of the chemical factory. Probably this was the place, and he drove
  with greater caution. He had turned the bend, when, ahead of him, he saw
  three red lights stretched across the road, and in the light of the
  head-lamps stood a policeman. He slowed the machine and stopped within a few
  yards of the officer.</p>

  <p>"You can't go this way, sir. The road's up."</p>

  <p>"How long has it been up?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"It's been blown up, sir, about twenty minutes ago," was the reply.
  "There's a side road a mile back, which will bring you to the other side of
  the railway lines. You can back in here."</p>

  <p>He indicated a gateway evidently leading to the factory. Dick pulled back
  his lever to the reverse, and sent the Rolls spinning backward into the
  opening.</p>

  <p>His hand was reaching to change the direction, when the policeman, who had
  walked to the side of the car, struck at him.</p>

  <p>Gordon's head was bent. He was incapable of resistance. Only the helmet he
  wore saved him from death. He saw nothing, only suddenly the world went
  black. Scarcely had the blow been struck when half-a-dozen men came from the
  shadows. Somebody jumped into the driver's seat, and, flinging out the limp
  figure of its owner, brought the car still further backward, and switched off
  the lights. Another of the party removed the red lamps. The policeman bent
  over the prostrate figure of Dick Gordon.</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd settled him," he said, disappointed.</p>

  <p>"Well, settle him now," said somebody in the darkness, but evidently the
  assailant changed his mind.</p>

  <p>"Hagn will want him," he said. "Lift him up."</p>

  <p>They carried the inanimate figure over the rough ground, through a sliding
  door, into a big, ill-lit factory hall, bare of machinery. At the far end was
  a brick partition forming an office, and into this he was carried and flung
  on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Here's your man, Hagn," growled the policeman. "I think he's
  through."</p>

  <p>Hagn got up from his table and walked across to where Dick Gordon lay.</p>

  <p>"I don't think there's much wrong with him," he said. "You couldn't kill a
  man through that helmet, anyway. Take it off."</p>

  <p>They took the leather helmet from the head of the unconscious man, and
  Hagn made a brief inspection.</p>

  <p>"No, he's all right," he said. "Throw some water over him. Wait; you'd
  better search him first. Those cigars," he said, pointing to the brown
  cylinders that protruded from his breast pocket, "I want."</p>

  <p>The first thing found was the blue envelope, and this Hagn tore open and
  read.</p>

  <p>"It seems all right," he said, and locked it away in the roll-top desk at
  which he was sitting when Dick had been brought in. "Now give him the
  water!"</p>

  <p>Dick came to his senses with a throbbing head and a feeling of resentment
  against the consciousness which was being forced upon him. He sat up, rubbing
  his face like a man roused from a heavy sleep, screwed up his eyes in the
  face of the bright light, and unsteadily stumbled to his feet, looking around
  from one to the other of the grinning faces.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" he said at last. "I seem to have struck it. Who hit me?"</p>

  <p>"We'll give you his card presently," sneered Hagn. "Where are you off to
  at this time of night?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to Gloucester," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"Like hell you are!" scoffed Hagn. "Put him upstairs, boys."</p>

  <p>Leading up from the office was a flight of unpainted pine stairs, and up
  this he was partly pushed and partly dragged. The room above had been used in
  war time as an additional supervisor's office. It had a large window,
  commanding a view of the whole of the floor space. The window was now thick
  with grime, and the floor littered with rubbish which the present occupants
  had not thought it worth while to move.</p>

  <p>"Search him again, and make sure he hasn't any gun on him. And take away
  his boots," said Hagn.</p>

  <p>A small carbon filament lamp cast a sickly yellow light upon the sinister
  group that surrounded Dick Gordon. He had time to take his bearings. The
  window he had seen, and escape that way was impossible; the ceiling was
  covered with matchboards that had once been varnished. There was no other way
  out, save down the steps.</p>

  <p>"You've got to stay here for a day or two, Gordon, but perhaps, if the
  Government will give us Balder, you'll get away with your life. If they
  don't, then it'll be a case of 'good-night, nurse!'"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap36"
     id="chap36">XXXVI. &mdash; THE POWER CABLE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dick Gordon knew that any discussion with his captors was a
  waste of breath, and that repartee was profitless. His head was aching, but
  no sooner was he left alone than he gave himself a treatment which an
  osteopath had taught him. He put his chin on his breast, and his two open
  hands behind his neck, the finger-tips pressing hard, then he slowly raised
  his head (it was an agony to do so), bringing his fingers down over the
  jugular. Three times repeated, his head was comparatively clear.</p>

  <p>The door was of thin wood and could easily be forced, but the room below
  was filled with men. Presently the light below went out, and the place was in
  darkness. He guessed that it was because Hagn did not wish the light to be
  seen from the road; though it was unlikely that there would come any
  inquiries, he had taken effective steps to deal with the police car which he
  knew would follow.</p>

  <p>They had not taken his matches away, and Dick struck one and looked round.
  Standing before a fireplace filled with an indescribable litter of half-burnt
  papers and dust, was a steel plate, with holes for rivets, evidently part of
  a tank which had not been assembled. There was a heavy switch on the wall,
  and Dick turned it, hoping that it controlled the light; but apparently that
  was on the same circuit as the light below. He struck another match and
  followed the casing of the switch. By and by he saw a thick black cable
  running in the angle of the wall and the ceiling. It terminated abruptly on
  the right of the fireplace; and from the marks on the floor, Dick guessed
  that at some time or other there had been an experimental welding plant
  housed there. He turned the switch again and sat down to consider what would
  be the best thing to do. He could hear the murmur of voices below, and, lying
  on the floor, put his ear to the trap, which he cleared with a piece of wire
  he found in the fireplace. Hagn seemed to do most of the talking.</p>

  <p>"If we blow up the road between here and Newbury, they'll smell a rat," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"It's a stupid idea you put forward, Hagn. What are you going to do with
  the chap upstairs?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I'm waiting to hear from Frog. Perhaps the Frog will want
  him killed."</p>

  <p>"He'd be a good man to hold for Balder, though, if Frog thought it was
  worth while."</p>

  <p>Towards five o'clock, Hagn, who had been out of the office, came back.</p>

  <p>"Frog says he's got to die," he said in a low voice.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Two people sat in Dick Gordon's study. The hour was four o'clock in the
  morning. Elk had gone, for the twentieth time to Headquarters, and for the
  twentieth time was on his way back. Ella Bennett had tried desperately hard
  to carry out Dick's instructions, and turned page after page determinedly,
  but had read and yet had seen nothing. With a deep sigh she put down the book
  and clasped her hands, her eyes fixed upon the clock.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he will get to Gloucester?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I certainly do," said Broad confidently. "That young man will get
  anywhere. He is the right kind and the right type, and nothing is going to
  hold him."</p>

  <p>She picked up the book but did not look at its printed page.</p>

  <p>"What happened to the police cars? Mr. Elk was telling me a lot about them
  last night," she said. "I haven't heard since."</p>

  <p>Joshua Broad licked his dry lips.</p>

  <p>"Oh, they got through all right," he said vaguely.</p>

  <p>He did not tell her that two police cars had been ditched between Newbury
  and Reading, the cars smashed and three men injured by a mine which had been
  sprung under them. Nor did he give her the news, that had arrived by
  motor-cyclist from Swindon, that Dick's car had not been seen.</p>

  <p>"They are dreadful people, dreadful!" She shivered. "How did they come
  into existence, Mr. Broad?"</p>

  <p>Broad was smoking (at her request) a long, thin cigar, and he puffed for a
  long time before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I guess I'm the father of the Frogs," he said to her amazement.</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know I was producing this outfit, but there it is." How, he did
  not seem disposed to explain at that moment.</p>

  <p>Soon he heard the whirr of the bell, and thinking that Elk had perhaps
  forgotten the key, he rose, and, going along the passage, opened the door. It
  was not Elk.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me for calling. Is that Mr. Broad?" The visitor peered forward in
  the darkness.</p>

  <p>"I'm Broad all right. You're Mr. Johnson, aren't you? Come right in, Mr.
  Johnson."</p>

  <p>He closed the door behind him and turned on the light.</p>

  <p>The stout man was in a state of pitiable agitation.</p>

  <p>"I was up late last night," he said, "and my servant brought me an early
  copy of the <i>Post Herald</i>.</p>

  <p>"So you know, eh?"</p>

  <p>"It's terrible, terrible! I can't believe it!"</p>

  <p>He took a crumpled paper from his pocket and looked at the stop-press
  space as though to reassure himself.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know it was in the paper."</p>

  <p>Johnson handed the newspaper to the American.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they've got it. I suppose old man Whitby must have given away the
  story."</p>

  <p>"I think it came from the picture man, Silenski. Is it true that Ray is
  under sentence of death?"</p>

  <p>Broad nodded.</p>

  <p>"How dreadful!" said Johnson in a hushed voice. "Thank God they've found
  it out in time! Mr. Broad," he said earnestly, "I hope you will tell Ella
  Bennett that she can rely on me for every penny I possess to establish her
  brother's innocence. I suppose there will be a respite and a new trial? If
  there is, the very best lawyers must be employed."</p>

  <p>"She's here. Won't you come in and see her?"</p>

  <p>"Here?" Johnson's jaw dropped. "I had no idea," he stammered.</p>

  <p>"Come in."</p>

  <p>Broad returned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Here is a friend of yours who has turned up&mdash;Mr. Johnson."</p>

  <p>The philosopher crossed the room with quick, nervous strides, and held out
  both his hands to the girl.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry, Miss Bennett," he said, "so very, very sorry! It must be
  dreadful for you, dreadful! Can I do anything?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, tears of gratitude in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is very sweet of you, Mr. Johnson. You've done so much for Ray, and
  Inspector Elk was telling me that you had offered him a position in your
  office."</p>

  <p>Johnson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing. I'm very fond of Ray, and he really has splendid
  capabilities. Once we get him out of this mess, I'll put him on his feet
  again. Your father doesn't know? Thank God for that!"</p>

  <p>"I wish this news hadn't got into the papers," she said, when he told her
  how he had learnt of the happening.</p>

  <p>"Silenski, of course," said Broad. "A motion picture publicity man would
  use his own funeral to get a free par. How are you feeling in your new
  position, Johnson?" he asked, to distract the girl's mind from the tragic
  thoughts which were oppressing her.</p>

  <p>Johnson smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm bewildered. I can't understand why poor Mr. Maitland did this. But I
  had my first Frog warning to-day; I feel almost important," he said.</p>

  <p>From a worn pocket-case he extracted a sheet of paper. It contained only
  three words:</p>

  <p>"You are next!"</p>

  <p>It bore the familiar sign manual of the Frog.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what harm I have done to these people, but I presume that it
  is something fairly bad, for within ten minutes of getting this note, the
  porter brought me my afternoon tea. I took one sip and it tasted so bitter
  that I washed my mouth out with a disinfectant."</p>

  <p>"When was this?"</p>

  <p>"Yesterday," said Johnson. "This morning I had the analysis&mdash;I had
  the tea bottled and sent off at once to an analytical chemist. It contained
  enough hydrocyanic acid to kill a hundred people. The chemist cannot
  understand how I could have taken the sip I did without very serious
  consequences. I am going to put the matter in the hands of the police
  to-day."</p>

  <p>The front door opened, and Elk came in.</p>

  <p>"What is the news?" asked the girl eagerly, rising to meet him.</p>

  <p>"Fine!" said Elk. "You needn't worry at all, Miss Bennett. That Gordon man
  can certainly move. I guess he's in Gloucester by now, sleeping in the best
  bed in the city."</p>

  <p>"But do you <i>know</i> he's in Gloucester?" she asked stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"I've had no exact news, but I can tell you this, that we've had no bad
  news," said Elk; "and when there's no news, you can bet that things are going
  according to schedule."</p>

  <p>"How did you hear about it, Johnson?"</p>

  <p>The new millionaire explained.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have pulled in Silenski and his operator," said Elk
  thoughtfully. "These motion picture men lack reticence. And how does it feel
  to be rich, Johnson?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Johnson doesn't think it feels too good," said Broad. "He has
  attracted the attention of old man Frog."</p>

  <p>Elk examined the warning carefully.</p>

  <p>"When did this come?"</p>

  <p>"I found it on my desk yesterday morning," said Johnson, and told him of
  the tea incident. "Do you think, Mr. Elk, you will ever put your hand on the
  Frog?"</p>

  <p>"I'm as certain as that I'm standing here, that Frog will go the
  way&mdash;" Elk checked himself, and fortunately the girl was not
  listening.</p>

  <p>It was getting light when Johnson left, and Elk walked with him to the
  door and watched him passing down the deserted street.</p>

  <p>"There's a lot about that boy I like," he said; "and he's certainly
  fortunate. Why the old man didn't leave his money to that baby of his&mdash;
  "</p>

  <p>"Did you ever find the baby?" interrupted Broad.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, there was no sign of that innocent child in the house. That's
  another Frog mystery to be cleared up."</p>

  <p>Johnson had reached the corner, and they saw him crossing the road, when a
  man came out of the shadow to meet him. There was a brief parley, and then
  Elk saw the flash of a pistol, and heard a shot. Johnson staggered back, and
  his opponent, turning, fled. In a second Elk was flying along the street.
  Apparently the philosopher was not hurt, though he seemed shaken.</p>

  <p>The inspector ran round the corner, but the assassin had disappeared. He
  returned to the philosopher, to find him sitting on the edge of the pavement,
  and at first he thought he had been wounded.</p>

  <p>"No, I think I just had a shock," gasped Johnson, "I was quite unprepared
  for that method of attack."</p>

  <p>"What happened?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>"I can hardly realize," said the other, who appeared dazed. "I was
  crossing the road when a man came up and asked me if my name was Johnson;
  then, before I knew what had happened, he had fired."</p>

  <p>His coat was singed by the flame of the shot, but the bullet must have
  gone wide. Later in the day, Elk found it embedded in the brickwork of a
  house.</p>

  <p>"No, no, I won't come back," said Johnson. "I don't suppose they'll repeat
  the attempt."</p>

  <p>By this time one of the two detectives who had been guarding Harley
  Terrace had come up, and under his escort Johnson was sent home.</p>

  <p>"They're certainly the busiest little fellows," said Elk, shaking his
  head. "You'd think they'd be satisfied with the work they were doing at
  Gloucester, without running sidelines."</p>

  <p>Joshua Broad was silent until they were going up the steps of the
  house.</p>

  <p>"When you know as much about the Frog as I know, you'll be surprised at
  nothing," he said, and did not add to this cryptic remark.</p>

  <p>Six o'clock came, and there was no further news from the west. Seven
  o'clock, and the girl's condition became pitiable. She had borne herself
  throughout the night with a courage that excited the admiration of the men;
  but now, as the hour was drawing close, she seemed on the verge of collapse.
  At half-past seven the telephone bell rang, and Elk answered.</p>

  <p>It was the Chief of Police at Newbury speaking.</p>

  <p>"Captain Gordon left Didcot an hour ago," was the message.</p>

  <p>"Didcot!" gasped Elk in consternation. He looked at the clock. "An hour
  ago&mdash;and he had to make Gloucester in sixty minutes!"</p>

  <p>The girl, who had been in the dining-room trying to take coffee which
  Gordon's servant had prepared, came into the study, and Elk dared not
  continue the conversation.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said loudly, and smashed down the receiver.</p>

  <p>"What is the news, Mr. Elk?" The girl's voice was a wail.</p>

  <p>"The news," said Elk, twisting his face into a smile, "is fine!"</p>

  <p>"What do they say?" she persisted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, them?" said Elk, looking at the telephone. "That was a friend of
  mine, asking me if I'd dine with him to-night."</p>

  <p>She went back to the dining-room, only half-satisfied, and Elk called the
  American to him.</p>

  <p>"Go and get a doctor," he said in a low voice, "and tell him to bring
  something that'll put this young lady to sleep for twelve hours."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Broad. "Is the news bad?"</p>

  <p>Elk nodded.</p>

  <p>"There isn't a chance of saving this boy&mdash;not the ghost of a chance!"
  he said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap37"
     id="chap37">XXXVII. &mdash; THE GET-AWAY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dick, with his ear to the floor, heard the words "Frog says
  he's got to die," and his cracked lips parted in a grin. "Have you heard him
  moving about?" asked Hagn.</p>

  <p>"No, he's asleep, I expect," said another voice. "We shall have to wait
  for light. We can't do it in the dark. We shall be killing one another."</p>

  <p>This view commended itself to most of the men present. Dick counted six
  voices. He struck a match for another survey, and again his eye fell upon the
  cable. And then an inspiration came to him. Moving stealthily across the
  floor, he reached up, and, gripping the cable, pulled on it steadily. Under
  his weight, the supporting insulator broke loose. By great good luck it fell
  upon the heap of rubbish in the fireplace and made no sound. For the next
  half-hour he worked feverishly, unwrapping the rubber insulation from the
  wires of the cable, pulling the copper strands free. His hands were bleeding,
  his nails broken; but after half-an-hour's hard work, he had the end of the
  cable frayed. The door opened outward, he remembered with satisfaction, and,
  lifting the steel plate, he laid it tight against the door, so that whoever
  entered must step upon it. Then he began to fasten the frayed copper wires of
  the cable to the rivet holes; and he had hardly finished his work before he
  heard a stealthy sound on the stairs.</p>

  <p>Day had come now, and light was streaming through the glass roof of the
  factory. He heard a faint whisper, and even as faint a click, as the bolts of
  the door were pulled; and, creeping to the switch, he turned it down.</p>

  <p>The door was jerked open, and a man stepped upon the plate. Before his
  scream could warn him who followed the second of the party had been flung
  senseless to the floor.</p>

  <p>"What the devil's wrong?" It was Hagn's voice. He came running up the
  stairs, put one foot on the electric plate, and stood for the space of a
  second motionless. Then, with a gasping sob, he fell backward, and Dick heard
  the crash as he struck the stairs.</p>

  <p>He did not wait any longer. Jumping over the plate, he leapt down the
  stairs, treading underfoot the senseless figure of Hagn. The little office
  was empty. On the table lay one of his pistols. He gripped it, and fled along
  the bare factory hall, through a door into the open. He heard a shout, and,
  looking round, saw two of the party coming at him, and, raising his pistol,
  he pressed the trigger. There was a click&mdash;Hagn had emptied the
  magazine.</p>

  <p>A Browning is an excellent weapon even if it is not loaded, and Dick
  Gordon brought the barrel down with smashing force upon the head of the man
  who tried to grapple with him. Then he turned and ran.</p>

  <p>He had made a mistake when he thought there were only six men in the
  building; there must have been twenty, and most of them were in full cry.</p>

  <p>He tried to reach the road, and was separated only by a line of bushes.
  But here he blundered. The bushes concealed a barbed wire fence, and he had
  to run along uneven ground, and in his stockinged feet the effort was
  painful. His slow progress enabled his pursuers to get ahead. Doubling back,
  Dick flew for the second of the three buildings, and as he ran, he took out
  the magazine of his pistol. As he feared, it was empty.</p>

  <p>Now they were on him. He could hear the leading man's breath, and he
  himself was nearly spent. And then, before him, he saw a round fire-alarm,
  fixed to the wall, and in a flash the memory of an almost forgotten
  conversation came back to him. With his bare hands he smashed the glass and
  tugged at the alarm, and at that minute they were on him. He fought
  desperately, but against their numbers resistance was almost useless. He must
  gain time.</p>

  <p>"Get up, you fellows!" he shouted. "Hagn's dead."</p>

  <p>It was an unfortunate statement, for Hagn came out of the next building at
  that moment, very shaken but very alive. He was livid with rage, and babbled
  in some language which Dick did not know, but which he guessed was
  Swedish.</p>

  <p>"I'll fix you for that. You shall try electric shock yourself, you
  dog!"</p>

  <p>He drove his fist at the prisoner's face, but Dick twisted his head and
  the blow struck the brickwork of the building against which he stood. With a
  scream, the man leapt at him, clawing and tearing with open hands, and this
  was Dick's salvation. For the men who were gripping his arms released their
  hold, that their chief might have freer play. Dick struck out, hitting
  scientifically for the body, and with a yell Hagn collapsed. Before they
  could stop him, Gordon was away like the wind, this time making for the
  gate.</p>

  <p>He had reached it when the hand of the nearest man fell on him. He flung
  him aside and staggered into the roadway, and then, from down the straight
  road, came the clang of bells, a glitter of brass and a touch of crimson. A
  motor fire-engine was coming at full speed.</p>

  <p>For a moment the men grouped about the gate stared at this intervention.
  Then, without taking any further notice of their quarry, they turned and ran.
  A word to the fire chief explained the situation. Another engine was coming,
  at breakneck speed, and firemen were men for whom Frogs had no terror.</p>

  <p>Whilst Hagn was being carried to one of the waiting wagons, Dick looked at
  his watch; it was six o'clock. He went in search of his car, fearing the
  worst. Hagn, however, had made no attempt to put the car out of gear;
  probably he had some plan for using it himself. Three minutes later, Dick,
  dishevelled, grimy, bearing the marks of Hagn's talons upon his face, swung
  out into the road and set the bonnet of the car for Gloucester. He could not
  have gone faster even had he known that his watch was stopped.</p>

  <p>Through Swindon at breakneck speed, and he was on the Gloucester Road. He
  looked at his watch again. The hands still pointed to six, and he gave a
  gasp. He was going all out now, but the road was bad, full of windings, and
  once he was nearly thrown out of the car when he struck a ridge on the
  road.</p>

  <p>A tyre burst, and he almost swerved into the hedge, but he got her nose
  straight again and continued on a flat tyre. It brought his speed down
  appreciably, and he grew hot and cold, as mile after mile of the road flashed
  past without a sign of the town.</p>

  <p>And then, with Gloucester Cathedral showing its spires above the hill, a
  second tyre exploded. He could not stop: he must go on, if he had to run in
  to Gloucester on the rims. And now the pace was painfully slow in comparison
  with that frantic rush which had carried him through Berkshire and Wiltshire
  to the edge of Somerset.</p>

  <p>He was entering the straggling suburbs of the town. The roads were
  terrible; he was held up by a street car, but, disregarding a policeman's
  warning, flew past almost under the wheels of a great traction engine. And
  now he saw the time&mdash;two minutes to eight, and the gaol was half a mile
  farther on. He set his teeth end prayed.</p>

  <p>As he turned into the main street, with the gaol gates before him, the
  clocks of the cathedral struck eight, and to Dick Gordon they were the notes
  of doom.</p>

  <p>They would delay the carrying out of the death penalty for nothing short
  of the reprieve he carried. Punctually to the second, Ray Bennett would die.
  The agony of that moment was a memory that turned him grey. He brought the
  bumping car to a halt before the prison gates and staggered to the bell.
  Twice he pulled, but the gates remained closed. Dick pulled off his sock and
  found the soddened reprieve, streaky with blood, for his feet were bleeding.
  Again he rang with the fury of despair. Then a little wicket opened and the
  dark face of a warder appeared.</p>

  <p>"You're not allowed in," he said curtly. "You know what is happening
  here."</p>

  <p>"Home Office," said Dick thickly, "Home Office messenger. I have a
  reprieve!"</p>

  <p>The wicket closed, and, after an eternity, the lock turned and the heavy
  door opened.</p>

  <p>"I'm Captain Gordon," gasped Dick, "from the Public Prosecutor's office,
  and I carry a reprieve for James Carter."</p>

  <p>The warder shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The execution took place five minutes ago, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"But the Cathedral clock!" gasped Dick.</p>

  <p>"The Cathedral clock is four minutes slow," said the warder. "I am afraid
  Carter is dead."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap38"
     id="chap38">XXXVIII. &mdash; THE MYSTERY MAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Ray Bennett woke from a refreshing sleep and sat up in bed.
  One of the warders, who had watched him all night, got up and came over.</p>

  <p>"Do you want your clothes, Carter?" he said. "The Governor thought you
  wouldn't care to wear those old things of yours."</p>

  <p>"And he was right," said the grateful Ray. "This looks a good suit," he
  said as he pulled on the trousers.</p>

  <p>The warder coughed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's a good suit," he agreed.</p>

  <p>He did not say more, but something in his demeanour betrayed the truth.
  These were the clothes in which some man had been hanged, and yet Ray's hands
  did not shake as he fixed the webbed braces which held them. Poor clothes, to
  do duty on two such dismal occasions! He hoped they would be spared the
  indignity of a third experience.</p>

  <p>They brought him his breakfast at six o'clock. Yet once more his eyes
  strayed toward the writing-pad, and then, with breakfast over, came the
  chaplain, a quiet man in minister's garb, strength in every line of his
  mobile face. They talked a while, and then the warder suggested that Ray
  should go to take exercise in the paved yard outside. He was glad of the
  privilege. He wanted once more to look upon the blue sky, to draw into his
  lungs the balm of God's air.</p>

  <p>Yet he knew that it was not a disinterested kindness, and well guessed why
  this privilege had been afforded to him, as he walked slowly round the
  exercise yard, arm in arm with the clergyman. He knew now what lay behind the
  third door. They were going to try the trap in the death house, and they
  wished to spare his feelings.</p>

  <p>In half an hour he was back in the cell.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to make any confession, Carter? Is that your name?"</p>

  <p>"No, it is not my name, sir," said Ray quietly, "but that doesn't
  matter."</p>

  <p>"Did you kill this man?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Ray. "I wanted to kill him, and therefore it is
  likely that I did."</p>

  <p>At ten minutes to eight came the Governor to shake hands, and with him the
  Sheriff. The clock in the prison hall moved slowly, inexorably forward.
  Through the open door of the cell Ray could see it, and, knowing this, the
  Governor closed the door, for it was one minute to eight, and it would soon
  open again. Ray saw the door move. For a second his self-possession deserted
  him, and he turned his back to the man who came with a quick step, and,
  gripping his hands, strapped them.</p>

  <p>"God forgive me! God forgive me!" murmured somebody behind him, and at the
  sound of that voice Ray spun round and faced the executioner.</p>

  <p>The hangman was John Bennett!</p>

  <p>Father and son, executioner and convicted murderer soon to be launched to
  death, they faced one another, and then, in a voice that was almost
  inaudible, John Bennett breathed the word:</p>

  <p>"Ray!"</p>

  <p>Ray nodded. It was strange that, in that moment, his mind was going back
  over the mysterious errands of his father, his hatred of the job into which
  circumstances had forced him.</p>

  <p>"Ray!" breathed the man again.</p>

  <p>"Do you know this man?" It was the Governor, and his voice was shaking
  with emotion.</p>

  <p>John Bennett turned.</p>

  <p>"He is my son," he said, and with a quick pull loosed the strap.</p>

  <p>"You must go on with this, Bennett." The Governor's voice was stern and
  terrible.</p>

  <p>"Go on with it?" repeated John Bennett mechanically. "Go on with this?
  Kill my own son? Are you mad? Do you think I am mad?" He took the boy in his
  arms, his cheek against the hairy face. "My boy! Oh, my boy!" he said, and
  smoothed his hair as he had done in the days when Ray was a child. Then,
  recovering himself instantly, he thrust the boy through the open door into
  the death chamber, followed him and slammed the door, bolting it.</p>

  <p>There was no other doorway except that, to which he had the key, and this
  he thrust into the lock that it might not be opened from the other side. Ray
  looked at the bare chamber, the dangling yellow rope, the marks of the trap,
  and fell back against the wail, his eyes shut, shivering. Then, standing in
  the middle of the trap, John Bennett hacked the rope until it was severed,
  hacked it in pieces as it lay on the floor. Then:</p>

  <p><i>Crack, crash!</i></p>

  <p>The two traps dropped, and into the yawning gap he flung the cut rope.</p>

  <p>"Father!"</p>

  <p>Ray was staring at him; oblivious to the thunderous blows which were being
  rained on the door, the old man came towards him, took the boy's face between
  his hands and kissed him.</p>

  <p>"Will you forgive me, Ray?" he asked brokenly. "I had to do this. I was
  forced to do it. I starved before I did it. I came once...out of curiosity to
  help the executioner&mdash;a broken-down doctor, who had taken on the work.
  And he was ill...I hanged the murderer. I had just come from the medical
  school. It didn't seem so dreadful to me then. I tried to find some other way
  of making money, and lived in dread all my life that somebody would point his
  finger at me, and say: 'There goes Benn, the executioner.'"</p>

  <p>"Benn, the executioner!" said Ray wonderingly. "Are you Benn?"</p>

  <p>The old man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Benn, come out! I give you my word of honour that I will postpone the
  execution until to-morrow. You can't stay there."</p>

  <p>John Bennett looked round at the grating, then up to the cut rope. The
  execution could not proceed. Such was the routine of death that the rope must
  he expressly issued from the headquarter gaol. No other rope would serve. All
  the paraphernalia of execution, down to the piece of chalk that marks the "T"
  on the trap where a man must put his feet, must be punctiliously forwarded
  from prison headquarters, and as punctiliously returned.</p>

  <p>John shot back the bolts, opened the door and stepped out.</p>

  <p>The faces of the men in the condemned cell were ghastly. The Governor's
  was white and drawn, the prison doctor seemed to have shrunk, and the Sheriff
  sat on the bed, his face hidden in his hands.</p>

  <p>"I will telegraph to London and tell them the circumstances," said the
  Governor. "I'm not condemning you for what you're doing, Benn. It would be
  monstrous to expect you to have done&mdash;this thing."</p>

  <p>A warder came along the corridor and through the door of the cell. And
  behind him, entering the prison by virtue of his authority, a dishevelled,
  dust-stained, limping figure, his face scratched, streaks of dried blood on
  his face, his eyes red with weariness. For a second John Bennett did not
  recognize him, and then:</p>

  <p>"A reprieve, by the King's own hand," said Dick Gordon unsteadily, and
  handed the stained envelope to the Governor.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap39"
     id="chap39">XXXIX. &mdash; THE AWAKENING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Throughout the night Ella Bennett lay, half waking, half
  sleeping. She remembered the doctor coming; she remembered Elk's urgent
  request that she should drink the draught he had prepared; and though she had
  suspected its nature and at first had fought against drinking that
  milky-white potion, she had at last succumbed, and had lain down on the sofa,
  determined that she would not sleep until she knew the worst or the best. She
  was exhausted with the mental fight she had put up to preserve her sanity,
  and then she had dozed.</p>

  <p>She was dimly conscious, as she came back to understanding, that she was
  lying on a bed, and that somebody had taken off her shoes and loosened her
  hair. With a tremendous effort she opened her eyes and saw a woman, sitting
  by a window, reading. The room was intensely masculine; it smelt faintly of
  smoke.</p>

  <p>"Dick's bed," she muttered, and the woman put down her book and got
  up.</p>

  <p>Ella looked at her, puzzled. Why did she wear those white bands about her
  hair, and that butcher-blue wrapper and the white cuffs? She was a nurse, of
  course. Satisfied with having solved that problem, Ella closed her eyes and
  went back again into the land of dreams.</p>

  <p>She woke again. The woman was still there, but this time the girl's mind
  was in order.</p>

  <p>"What time is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The nurse came over with a glass of water, and Ella drank greedily.</p>

  <p>"It is seven o'clock," she said.</p>

  <p>"Seven!" The girl shivered, and then, with a cry, tried to rise. "It is
  evening!" she gasped. "Oh, what happened?"</p>

  <p>"Your father is downstairs, miss," said the nurse. "I'll call him."</p>

  <p>"Father&mdash;here?" She frowned. "Is there any other news?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gordon is downstairs too, miss, and Mr. Johnson." The woman was
  faithfully carrying out the instructions which had been given to her.</p>

  <p>"Nobody&mdash;else?" asked Ella in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"No, miss, the other gentleman is coming to-morrow or the next day&mdash;
  your brother, I mean."</p>

  <p>With a sob the girl buried her face in the pillow. "You are not telling
  the truth!"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I am," said the woman, and there was something in her laugh which
  made Ella look up.</p>

  <p>The nurse went out of the room and was gone a little while. Presently the
  door opened, and John Bennett came in. Instantly she was in his arms, sobbing
  her joy.</p>

  <p>"It is true, it is true, daddy!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my love, it is true," said Bennett. "Ray will be here to-morrow.
  There are some formalities to be gone through; they can't secure a release
  immediately, as they do in story-books. We are discussing his future. Oh, my
  girl, my poor girl!"</p>

  <p>"When did you know, daddy?"</p>

  <p>"I knew this morning," said her father quietly.</p>

  <p>"Were you&mdash;were you dreadfully hurt?" she asked. He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Johnson wants to give Ray the management of Maitlands Consolidated," he
  said. "It would be a splendid thing for Ray. Ella, our boy has changed."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen him?" she asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I saw him this morning."</p>

  <p>She thought it was natural that her father should have seen him, and did
  not question him as to how he managed to get behind the jealously guarded
  doors of the prison.</p>

  <p>"I don't think Ray will accept Johnson's offer," he said. "If I know him
  as he is now, I am sure he will not accept. He will not take any ready-made
  position; he wants to work for himself. He is coming back to us, Ella."</p>

  <p>She wanted to ask him something, but feared to hurt him.</p>

  <p>"Daddy, when Ray comes back," she said after a long silence, "will it be
  possible for you to leave this&mdash;this work you hate so much?"</p>

  <p>"I have left it, dear," he replied quietly. "Never again&mdash;never
  again&mdash;never again, thank God!"</p>

  <p>She did not see his face, but she felt the tremor that passed through the
  frame of the man who held her.</p>

  <p>Downstairs, the study was blue with smoke. Dick Gordon, conspicuously
  bandaged about the head, something of his good looks spoiled by three
  latitudinal scratches which ran down his face, sat in his dressing-gown and
  slippers, a big pipe clenched between his teeth, the picture of battered
  contentment.</p>

  <p>"Very good of you, Johnson," he said. "I wonder whether Bennett will take
  your offer. Honestly, do you think he's competent to act as the manager of
  this enormous business?"</p>

  <p>Johnson looked dubious.</p>

  <p>"He was a clerk at Maitlands. You can have no knowledge of his
  administrative qualities. Aren't you being just a little too generous?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Perhaps I am," said Johnson quietly. "I naturally want to
  help. There may be other positions less important, and perhaps, as you say,
  Ray might not care to take any quite as responsible."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure he won't," said Dick decidedly.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," said Elk, "that the biggest job of all is to get young
  Bennett out of the clutches of the Frogs. Once a Frog, always a Frog, and
  this old man is not going to sit down and take his beating like a little
  gentleman. We had a proof of that yesterday morning. They shot at Johnson in
  this very street."</p>

  <p>Dick took out his pipe, sent a cloud of blue smoke toward the haze that
  lay on the room.</p>

  <p>"The Frog is finished," he said. "The only question now is, what is the
  best and most effective way to make an end? Balder is caught; Hagn is in
  gaol; Lew Brady, who was one of their most helpful agents, though he did not
  hold any executive position&mdash;Lew is dead; Lola&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lola is through." It was the American who spoke. "She left this morning
  for the United States, and I took the liberty of facilitating her
  passage&mdash;there remains Frog himself, and the organization which Frog
  controls. Catch him, and you've finished with the gang."</p>

  <p>John Bennett came back at that moment, and the conversation took another
  turn; soon after, Joshua Broad and Johnson went away together.</p>

  <p>"You have not told Ella anything, Mr. Bennett?"</p>

  <p>"About myself?&mdash;no. Is it necessary?"</p>

  <p>"I hope you will not think so," said Dick quietly. "Let that remain your
  own secret, and Ray's secret. It has been known to me for a very long time.
  The day Elk told me he had seen you coming from King's Cross station, and
  that a burglary had been committed, I saw in the newspapers that a man had
  been executed in York Prison. And then I took the trouble to look up the
  files of the newspapers, and I found that your absences had certainly
  coincided with burglaries&mdash;and there are so many burglaries in England
  in the course of a year that it would have been remarkable if they had not
  coincided&mdash;there were also other coincidences. On the day the murder was
  committed at Ibbley Copse, you were in Gloucester, and on that day Waldsen,
  the Hereford murderer, was executed."</p>

  <p>John Bennett hung his head.</p>

  <p>"You knew, and yet..." he hesitated.</p>

  <p>Dick nodded.</p>

  <p>"I knew none of the circumstances which drove you to this dreadful
  business, Mr. Bennett," he said gently. "To me you are an officer of the
  law&mdash;no more and no less terrible than I, who have helped send many men
  to the scaffold. No more unclean than the judge who sentences them and signs
  the warrant for their death. We are instruments of Order."</p>

  <p>Ella and her father stayed that night at Harley Terrace, and in the
  morning drove down to Paddington Station to meet the boy. Neither Dick nor
  Elk accompanied them.</p>

  <p>"There are two things which strike me as remarkable," said Elk. "One is,
  that neither you nor I recognized Bennett."</p>

  <p>"Why should we?" asked Dick. "Neither you nor I attend executions, and the
  identity of the hangman has always been more or less unknown except to a very
  few people. If he cares to advertise himself, he is known. Bennett shrank
  from publicity, avoided even the stations of the towns where the executions
  took place, and usually alighted at some wayside village and tramped into the
  town on foot. The chief warder at Gloucester told me that he never arrived at
  the gaol until midnight before an execution. Nobody saw him come or go."</p>

  <p>"Old man Maitland must have recognized him."</p>

  <p>"He did," nodded Dick. "At some period Maitland was in gaol, and it is
  possible for prisoners, especially privileged prisoners, to catch a glimpse
  of the hangman. By 'privileged prisoners' I mean men who, by reason of their
  good conduct, were allowed to move about the gaol freely. Maitland told Miss
  Bennett that he had been in 'quod,' and I am certain that that is the true
  explanation. All Bennett's official letters came to him at Dorking, where he
  rented a room for years. His mysterious journeys to town were not mysterious
  to the people of Dorking, who did not know him by sight or name."</p>

  <p>To Elk's surprise, when he came back to Harley Terrace, Dick was not
  there. His servant said that his master had had a short sleep, had dressed
  and gone out, and had left no message as to where he was going. Dick did not,
  as a rule, go out on these solitary expeditions, and Elk's first thought was
  that he had gone to Horsham. He ate his dinner, and thought longingly of his
  comfortable bed. He did not wish to retire for the night until he had seen
  his chief.</p>

  <p>He made himself comfortable in the study, and was fast asleep, when
  somebody shook him gently by the shoulder. He looked up and saw Dick.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he said sleepily. "Are you staying up all night?"</p>

  <p>"I've got the car at the door," said Dick. "Get your top-coat. We're going
  to Horsham."</p>

  <p>Elk yawned at the clock.</p>

  <p>"She'll be thinking of bed," he protested.</p>

  <p>"I hope so," said Dick, "but I have my fears. Frog was seen on the Horsham
  Road at nine o'clock to-night."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" asked Elk, now wide awake.</p>

  <p>"I've been shadowing him all the evening," said Dick, "but he slipped
  me."</p>

  <p>"You've been watching Frog?" repeated Elk slowly. "Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"I've known him for the greater part of a month," said Dick Gordon. "Get
  your gun!"</p>

  <h2><a name="chap40"
     id="chap40">XL. &mdash; FROG</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There is a happiness which has no parallel in life&mdash;the
  happiness which comes when a dear one is restored.</p>

  <p>Ray Bennett sat by his father's chair, and was content to absorb the love
  and tenderness which made the room radiant. It seemed like a dream to be back
  in this cosy sitting-room with its cretonnes, its faint odour of lavender,
  the wide chimney-place, the leaded windows, and Ella, most glorious vision of
  all. The rainstorm that lashed the window-panes gave the comfort and peace of
  his home a new and a more beautiful value. From time to time he fingered his
  shaven face absently. It was the only sure evidence to him that he was awake
  and that this experience belonged to the word of reality.</p>

  <p>"Pull up your chair, boy," said John Bennett as Ella carried in a steaming
  teapot and put it on the table.</p>

  <p>Ray rose obediently and placed the big Windsor chair where it had always
  been when he lived at home, on his father's right hand.</p>

  <p>John Bennett sat at the table, his head bent forward. It was the old grace
  that his father had said for years and years, and which secretly amused him
  in other days, but which now was invested with a beautiful significance that
  made him choke.</p>

  <p><i>"For all the blessings we have received this day, may the Lord make us
  truly thankful!"</i></p>

  <p>It was a wonderful meal, more wonderful than any he had eaten at Heron's
  or at those expensive restaurants which he had favoured. Home-cured tongue,
  home-made bread, and a great jar of home-made preserves, tea that was
  fragrant with the bouquet of the East. He laid down his knife and fork and
  leant back with a happy smile.</p>

  <p>"Home," he said simply, and his father gripped his hand under cover of the
  table-cloth, gripped and held it so tightly that the boy winced.</p>

  <p>"Ray, they want you to take over the management of Maitlands&mdash;
  Johnson does. What do you think of that, son?"</p>

  <p>Ray shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm no more fit to manage Maitlands than I am to be President of the Bank
  of England," he said with a little laugh. "No, dad, my views are less exalted
  than they were. I think I might earn a respectable living hoeing
  potatoes&mdash;and I should be happy to do so!"</p>

  <p>The older man was looking thoughtfully at the table.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I shall want an assistant if these pictures of mine are the
  success that Silenski says they will be. Perhaps you can hoe potatoes between
  whiles&mdash;when Ella is married."</p>

  <p>The girl went red.</p>

  <p>"Is Ella going to be married? Are you EIla?" Ray jumped up and, going to
  the girl, kissed her. "Ella, it won't make a difference, will it&mdash;about
  me, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so, dear. I've promised."</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" asked John Bennett, as he saw the cloud that came to
  the girl's face.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of something unpleasant, daddy," she said, and for the
  first time told of the hideous visitation.</p>

  <p>"The Frog wanted to marry you?" said Ray with a frown. "It is incredible!
  Did you see his face?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He was masked," she said. "Don't let us talk about it."</p>

  <p>She got up quickly and began to clear away the meal, and, for the first
  time for many years, Ray helped her.</p>

  <p>"A terrible night," she said, coming back from the kitchen. "The wind
  burst open the window and blew out the lamp, and the rain is corning down in
  torrents!"</p>

  <p>"All nights are good nights to me," said Ray, and in his chuckle she
  detected a little sob.</p>

  <p>No word had been spoken since they met of his terrible ordeal; it was
  tacitly agreed that that nightmare should remain in the region of bad dreams,
  and only now and again did he betray the horror of those three weeks of
  waiting.</p>

  <p>"Bolt the back door, darling," said John Bennett, looking up as she went
  out.</p>

  <p>The two men sat smoking, each busy with his own thoughts. Then Ray spoke
  of Lola.</p>

  <p>"I do not think she was bad, father," he said. "She could not have known
  what was going to happen. The thing was so diabolically planned that even to
  the very last, until I learnt from Gordon the true story, I was under the
  impression that I had killed Brady. This man must have the brain of a
  general."</p>

  <p>Bennett nodded.</p>

  <p>"I always used to think," Ray went on, "that Maitland had something to do
  with the Frogs. I suppose he had, really. I first guessed that much after he
  turned up at Heron's Club&mdash;what is the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Ella!" called the old man.</p>

  <p>There was no answer from the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"I don't want her to stay out there, washing up. Ray, boy, call her
  in."</p>

  <p>Ray got up and opened the door of the kitchen. It was in darkness.</p>

  <p>"Bring the lamp, father," he called, and John Bennett came hurrying after
  him.</p>

  <p>The door of the kitchen was closed but not bolted. Something white lay on
  the floor, and Ray stooped to pick it up. It was a torn portion of the apron
  Which Ella had been wearing.</p>

  <p>The two men looked at one another, and Ray, running up to his room, came
  down with a storm lantern which he lit.</p>

  <p>"She may be in the garden," he said in a strained voice, and, throwing
  open the door, went out into the storm.</p>

  <p>The rain beat down unmercifully; the men were wet through before they had
  gone a dozen yards. Ray held the light down to the ground. There were tracks
  of many feet in the soft mud, and presently he found one of Ella's. The
  tracks disappeared on to the edge of the lawn, but they were making straight
  for the side gate which opened into a narrow lane. This passage-way connected
  the road with a meadow behind Maytree Cottage, and the roadway gate was
  usually kept chained and padlocked. Ray was the first to see the car tracks,
  and then he found that the gate was open and the broken chain lay in the
  muddy roadway. Running out into the road, he saw that the tracks turned to
  the right.</p>

  <p>"We had better search the garden first to make absolutely sure, father,"
  he said. "I will arouse some of the cottagers and get them to help."</p>

  <p>By the time he came back to the house, John Bennett had made a thorough
  search of the garden and the house, but the girl had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Go down to the town and telephone to Gordon," he said, and his voice was
  strangely calm.</p>

  <p>In a quarter of an hour Ray Bennett jumped off his old bicycle at the door
  of Maytree Cottage, to tell his grave news.</p>

  <p>"The 'phone line has been cut," he said tersely. "I've ordered a car to be
  sent up from the garage. We will try to follow the tracks."</p>

  <p>The machine had arrived when the blazing head-lamps of Dick's car came
  into view. Gordon knew the worst before he had sprung to the ground. There
  was a brief, unemotional consultation. Dick went rapidly through the kitchen
  and followed the tracks until they came back to the road, to find Elk going
  slowly along the opposite side, examining the ground with an electric
  lamp.</p>

  <p>"There's a small wheel track over here," he said. "Too heavy for a
  bicycle, too light for a car; looks to me like a motor-cycle."</p>

  <p>"It was a car," said Dick briefly, "and a very big one."</p>

  <p>He sent Ray and his father to the house to change; insisted on this being
  done before they moved a step. They came out, wrapped in mackintoshes, and
  leapt into the car as it was moving.</p>

  <p>For five miles the tracks were visible, and then they came to a village. A
  policeman had seen a car come through "a little time ago"&mdash;and a
  motor-cyclist.</p>

  <p>"Where was the cyclist?" asked Elk.</p>

  <p>"He was behind, about a hundred yards," said the policeman. "I tried to
  pull him up because his lamp was out, but he took no notice."</p>

  <p>They went on for another mile, and then struck the hard surface of a newly
  tarred road, and here all trace of the tracks was lost. Going on for a mile
  farther, they reached a point where the road broke into three. Two of these
  were macadamized and showed no wheel tracks; nor did the third, although it
  had a soft surface, offer any encouragement to follow.</p>

  <p>"It is one of these two," said Dick. "We had better try the right-hand
  road first."</p>

  <p>The macadam lasted until they reached another village. The road was
  undergoing repair in the village itself, but the night watchman shook his
  head when Dick asked him.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, no car has passed here for two hours."</p>

  <p>"We must drive back," said Dick, despair in his heart, and the car spun
  round and flew at top speed to the juncture of the roads.</p>

  <p>Down this they went, and they had not gone far before Dick half leapt at
  the sight of the red tail-lamp of the machine ahead. His hopes, however, were
  fated to be dashed. A car had broken down on the side of the road, but the
  disgruntled driver was able to give them valuable information. A car had
  passed him three-quarters of an hour before; he described it minutely, had
  even been able to distinguish its make. The cyclist was driving a Red
  Indian.</p>

  <p>Again the cyclist!</p>

  <p>"How far was he behind the car?"</p>

  <p>"A good hundred yards I should say," was the reply.</p>

  <p>From now on they received frequent news of the car, but at the second
  village, the motor-cyclist had not been seen, nor at subsequent places where
  the machine had been identified, was there any reference to a
  motor-cyclist.</p>

  <p>It was past midnight when they came up with the machine they were chasing.
  It stood outside a garage on the Shoreham Road, and Elk was the first to
  reach it. It was empty and unattended. Inside the garage, the owner of that
  establishment was busy making room for the last corner.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, a quarter of an hour ago," he said, when Elk had produced his
  authority. "The chauffeur said he was going to find lodgings in the
  town."</p>

  <p>With the aid of a powerful electric lamp they made an examination of the
  car's interior. There was no doubt whatever that Ella had been an inmate. A
  little ivory pin which John Bennett had given her on her birthday, was found,
  broken, in a corner of the floor.</p>

  <p>"It is not worth while looking for the chauffeur," said Elk. "Our only
  chance is that he'll come back to the garage."</p>

  <p>The local police were called into consultation.</p>

  <p>"Shoreham is a very big place," said the police chief. "If you had luck,
  you might find your man immediately. If he's with a gang of crooks, it is
  more likely that you'll not find him at all, or that he'll never come back
  for the machine."</p>

  <p>One matter puzzled Elk more than any other. It was the disappearance of
  the motor-cyclist. If the story was true, that he had been riding a hundred
  yards behind and that he had fallen out between two villages, they must have
  passed him. There were a few cottages on the road, into which he might have
  turned, but Elk dismissed this possibility.</p>

  <p>"We had better go back," he said. "It is fairly certain that Miss Bennett
  has been taken out somewhere on the road. The motor-cyclist is now the best
  clue, because she evidently went with him. This cyclist was either the Frog,
  or one of his men."</p>

  <p>"They disappeared somewhere between Shoreham and Morby," said Dick. "You
  know the country about here, Mr. Bennett. Is there any place where they'd be
  likely to go near Morby?"</p>

  <p>"I know the country," agreed Bennett, "and I've been trying to think.
  There is nothing but a very few houses outside of Morby. Of course, there is
  Morby Fields, but I can't imagine Ella being taken there."</p>

  <p>"What are Morby Fields?" asked Dick, as the car went slowly back the way
  it had come.</p>

  <p>"Morby Fields is a disused quarry. The company went into liquidation some
  years ago," replied Bennett.</p>

  <p>They passed through Morby at snail pace, stopping at the local policeman's
  house for any further news which might have been gleaned in their absence.
  There was, however, nothing fresh.</p>

  <p>"You are perfectly certain that you did not see the motorcyclist?"</p>

  <p>"I am quite certain, sir," said the man. "The car was as close to me as I
  am to you. In fact, I had to step to the pavement to prevent myself being
  splashed with mud; and there was no motor-cyclist. In fact, the impression I
  had was that the car was empty."</p>

  <p>"Why did you think that?" asked Elk quickly.</p>

  <p>"It was riding light, for one thing, and the chauffeur was smoking for
  another. I always associate a smoking chauffeur with an empty car."</p>

  <p>"Son," said the admiring Elk, "there are possibilities about you," and a
  recruit to Headquarters was noted.</p>

  <p>"I'm inclined to agree with that village policeman," said Dick when they
  walked back to their machine. "The car was empty when it came through here,
  and that accounts for the absence of the motor-cyclist. It is between Morby
  and Wellan that we've got to look."</p>

  <p>And now they moved at a walking pace. The brackets that held the
  head-lamps were wrenched round to throw a light upon the ditch and hedge on
  either side of the road. They had not gone five hundred yards when Elk
  roared:</p>

  <p>"Stop!" and jumped into the roadway.</p>

  <p>He was gone a few minutes, and then he called Dick, and the three men went
  back to where the detective was standing, looking at a big red motor-cycle
  that stood under the shelter of a crumbling stone wall. They had passed it
  without observation, for its owner had chosen the other side of the wall, and
  it was only the gleam of the light on a handlebar which showed just above its
  screen, that had led to its detection.</p>

  <p>Dick ran to the car and backed it so that the wall and machine were
  visible. The cycle was almost new; it was splattered with mud, and its
  acetylene head-lamps were cold to the touch. Elk had an inspiration. At the
  back of the seat was a heavy tool-wallet, attached by a firm strap, and this
  he began to unfasten.</p>

  <p>"If this is a new machine, the maker will have put the name and address of
  the owner in his wallet," he said.</p>

  <p>Presently the tool-bag was detached, and Elk unstrapped the last fastening
  and turned back the flap.</p>

  <p>"Great Moses!" said Elk.</p>

  <p>Neatly painted on the undressed leather was:</p>

  <p>"Joshua Broad, 6, Caverley House, Cavendish Square!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap41"
     id="chap41">XLI. &mdash; IN QUARRY HOUSE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The first impression that Ella Bennett had when she returned
  to the kitchen to fasten the door that shut of the sitting-room was that the
  tea-cloth, which she had hung up to dry on the line near the lofty ceiling
  had fallen. With startling suddenness she was enveloped in the folds of a
  heavy, musty cloth. And then an arm was flung round her, a hand covered her
  mouth and drew back her head. She tried to scream, but no sound came. She
  kicked out toward the door and an arm clutched at her dress and pulled back
  her foot. She heard the sound of something tearing, and then a strap was put
  round her ankles. She felt the rush of cold air as the door was opened, and
  in another second she was in the garden.</p>

  <p>"Walk," hissed a voice, and she discovered her feet were loosened.</p>

  <p>She could see nothing, only she could feel the rain beating down upon the
  cloth that covered her head, and the strength of the wind against her face.
  It blew the cloth so tightly over her mouth and nose that she could hardly
  breathe. Where they were taking her she could only guess. It was not until
  she felt her feet squelch in liquid mud that she knew she was in the lane by
  the side of the house. She had hardly identified the place before she was
  lifted bodily into the waiting car; she heard somebody scrambling in by her
  side, and the car jerked forward. Then with dexterous hand, one of the men
  sitting at her side whisked the cloth from her head. Ahead, in one of the two
  bucket seats, the only one occupied, was a dark figure, the face of which she
  could not see.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing? Who are you?" she asked, and no sooner did the voice
  of the man before her come to her ears than she knew she was in the power of
  the Frog.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to give you your last chance," he said. "After to-night that
  chance is gone."</p>

  <p>She composed the tremor in her voice with an effort, and then:</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by my last chance?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You will undertake to marry me, and to leave the country with me in the
  morning. I've such faith in you that I will take your word," he said.</p>

  <p>She shook her head, until she realized that, in the darkness, he could not
  see her.</p>

  <p>"I will never do that," she answered quietly, and no other word was spoken
  through the journey. Once, at a whispered word from the man in the
  mask&mdash;she saw the reflection of his mica eye-pieces even though the
  blinds were drawn, as the car went through some village street&mdash;one of
  the men looked back through the glass in the hood.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he said.</p>

  <p>No violence was offered to her; she was not bound, or restricted in any
  way, though she knew it was perfectly hopeless for her to dream of
  escape.</p>

  <p>They were running along a dark country road when the car slowed and
  stopped. The passengers turned out quickly, she was the last. A man caught
  her arm as she descended and led her, through an opening of the hedge, into
  what seemed to her to be a ploughed field.</p>

  <p>The other came after her, bringing her an oilskin coat and helping her
  into it.</p>

  <p>The rain flogged across the waste, rattling against the oil-coat; she
  heard the man holding her arm mutter something under his breath. The Frog
  walked ahead, only looking back once. She slipped and stumbled, and would
  have often fallen but for the hand which held her up.</p>

  <p>"Where are you taking me?" she asked at last.</p>

  <p>There was no reply. She wondered if she could wrench herself free, and
  trust to the cover of darkness to hide her, but even as the thought occurred,
  she saw a gleam of water to the right&mdash;a round, ghostly patch.</p>

  <p>"These are Morby Fields," she said suddenly, recognizing the place.
  "You're taking me to the quarry."</p>

  <p>Again no answer. They tramped on doggedly, until she knew they were within
  measurable distance of the quarry itself. She wondered what would be her fate
  when she finally refused, as she would refuse. Did this terrible man intend
  to kill her?</p>

  <p>"Wait," said the Frog suddenly, and disappeared into the gloom.</p>

  <p>Then she saw a light, which came from a small wooden house; two patches of
  light, one long, one square&mdash;a window and a door. The window disappeared
  as he closed the shutter. Then his figure stood silhouetted in the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, and she went forward.</p>

  <p>At the door of the hut she drew back, but the hand on her arm tightened.
  She was pushed into the interior, and the door was slammed and bolted.</p>

  <p>She was alone with Frog. Curiosity overcame her fear. She looked round the
  little room. It was about ten feet long by six feet broad. The furnishings
  were simple: a bed, a table, two chairs and a fireplace. The wooden floor was
  covered by an old and grimy rug. Against one of the walls were piled two
  shallow wooden boxes, and the wood was new. The mask followed the direction
  of her eyes and she heard his slow chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Money," he said tersely, "your money and my money, there is a million
  there."</p>

  <p>She looked, fascinated. Near the boxes were four long glass cylinders,
  containing an opaque substance or liquid&mdash;she could not tell from where
  she stood. The nature of this the Frog did not then trouble to explain.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he said.</p>

  <p>His manner was brisk and businesslike. She expected him to take off his
  mask as he seated himself opposite her, but in this she was disappointed. He
  sat, and through the mica pieces she saw his hard eyes watching her.</p>

  <p>"Well, Ella Bennett, what do you say? Will you marry me, or will you go
  into a welcome oblivion? You leave this hut either as my wife, or we leave
  together&mdash;dead."</p>

  <p>He got up and went to where the glass cylinders lay and touched one.</p>

  <p>"I will smash one of these with my foot and take off my mask, and you
  shall have at least the satisfaction that you know who I am before you
  die&mdash;but only just before you die!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadily.</p>

  <p>"I will never marry you," she said, "never! If for no other reason, for
  your villainous plot against my brother."</p>

  <p>"Your brother is a fool," said the hollow voice. "He need never have gone
  through that agony, if you had only promised to marry me. I had a man ready
  to confess, I myself would have taken the risk of supporting his
  confession."</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to marry me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>It sounded banal, stupid. Yet so grotesque was the suggestion, that she
  could talk of the matter in cold blood and almost without emotion.</p>

  <p>"Because I love you," was the reply. "Whether I love you as Dick Gordon
  loves you, I do not know. It may well be that you are something which I
  cannot possess, and therefore are all the more precious to me&mdash;I have
  never been thwarted in any desire."</p>

  <p>"I would welcome death," she said quickly, and she heard the muffled
  chuckle.</p>

  <p>"There are worse things than death to a sensitive woman," he said
  significantly, "and you shall not die until the end."</p>

  <p>He did not attempt to speak again, but, pulling a pack of cards from his
  pocket, played solitaire. After an hour's play, he swept the cards into the
  fireplace and rose.</p>

  <p>He looked at her and there was something in his eyes that froze her
  blood.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will never see my face," he said, and reached out his hand to
  the oil lamp which stood on the table.</p>

  <p>Lower and lower sank the flame, and then came a gentle tap at the
  door.</p>

  <p><i>Tap...tap...tappity...tap!</i></p>

  <p>The Frog stood still, his hand upon the lamp.</p>

  <p><i>Tap...tap...tappity...tap!</i></p>

  <p>It came again. He turned up the light a little and went to the door.</p>

  <p>"Who's that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Hagn," said a deep voice, and the Frog took a startled step backward.
  "Quick! Open!"</p>

  <p>The mask turned the heavy bar, and, taking a key from his pocket, he drew
  back the lock.</p>

  <p>"Hagn, how did you get away?"</p>

  <p>The door was pushed open with such violence that he was flung back against
  the wall, and Ella uttered a scream of joy.</p>

  <p>Standing in the doorway was a bare-headed man, in a shining trench-coat.
  It was Joshua Broad.</p>

  <p>"Keep back!"</p>

  <p>He did not look round, but she knew the words were addressed to her and
  stood stock-still. Both Broad's hands were in the deep pockets of his coat;
  his eyes did not leave the mask.</p>

  <p>"Harry," he said softly, "you know what I want."</p>

  <p>"Take yours!" screeched the Frog. His hand moved so quickly that the girl
  could not follow it.</p>

  <p>Two shots rang out together and the Frog staggered back against the wall.
  His foot was within a few inches of the glass cylinders, and he raised it.
  Again Broad fired, and the Frog fell backward, his head in the fireplace. He
  came struggling to his feet, and then, with a little choking sob, fell
  backward, his arms outstretched.</p>

  <p>There was a sound of voices outside, a scraping of feet on the muddy path,
  and John Bennett came into the hut. In a moment the girl was in his arms.
  Broad looked round. Elk and Dick Gordon were standing in the doorway, taking
  in the scene.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," said Joshua Broad, "I call you to witness that I killed this
  man in self-defence."</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" said Dick.</p>

  <p>"It is the Frog," said Joshua Broad calmly. "His other name is Harry Lyme.
  He is an English convict."</p>

  <p>"I knew it was Harry Lyme." It was Elk who spoke. "Is he dead?"</p>

  <p>Broad stooped and thrust his hand under the man's waistcoat.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is dead," he announced simply. "I'm sorry that I have robbed you
  of your prey, Mr. Elk, but it was vitally necessary that he should be killed
  before I was, and one of us had to die this night!"</p>

  <p>Elk knelt by the still figure and began to unfasten the hideous rubber
  mask.</p>

  <p>"It was here that Genter was killed," said Dick Gordon in a low voice. "Do
  you see the gas?"</p>

  <p>Elk looked at the glass cylinders and nodded. Then his eyes came back to
  the bareheaded American.</p>

  <p>"Saul Morris, I believe?" he said, and "Joshua Broad" nodded.</p>

  <p>Elk pursed his lips thoughtfully, and his eyes went back to the still
  figure at his feet.</p>

  <p>"Now, Frog, let me see you," he said, and tore away the mask.</p>

  <p>He looked down into the face of Philosopher Johnson!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap42"
     id="chap42">XLII. &mdash; JOSHUA BROAD EXPLAINS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The sunlight was pouring through the windows of May-tree
  Cottage; the breakfast things still stood upon the table, when the American
  began his story.</p>

  <p>"My name, as you rightly surmised, Mr. Elk, is Saul Morris. I am, by all
  moral standards, a criminal, though I have not been guilty of any criminal
  practice for the past ten years. I was born at Hertford in Connecticut.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to offer you an apology, conventional or unconventional,
  for my ultimate choice; nor will I insult your intelligence by inviting
  sympathy for my first fail. I guess I was born with light fingers and a
  desire for money that I had not earned. I was not corrupted, I was not
  tempted, I had no evil companions; in fact, the beginnings of my career were
  singularly unlike any of the careers of criminals which I have ever read.</p>

  <p>"I studied bank robberies as a doctor might take up the study of anatomy.
  I understand perfectly every system of banking&mdash;and there are only two,
  one of which succeeds, the other produces a plentiful crop of fraudulent
  directors&mdash;and I have added to this a knowledge of lockcraft. A burglar
  who starts business without understanding the difficulties and obstacles he
  has to overcome is&mdash;to use the parallel I have already
  employed&mdash;like the doctor who starts off to operate without knowing what
  arteries, tissues and nerves he will be severing. The difference between a
  surgeon and a butcher is that one doesn't know the name of the tissues he is
  cutting!</p>

  <p>"When I decided upon my career, I served for five years in the factory of
  the greatest English safe-maker in Wolverhampton. I studied locks, safes, the
  tensile qualities of steel, until I was proficient, and my spare time I gave
  up to as important a study&mdash;the transportation of negotiable currency.
  That in itself is a study which might well occupy a man's full time.</p>

  <p>"I returned to America at the age of twenty-five, and accumulated a kit of
  tools, which cost me several thousand dollars, and with these, and alone, I
  smashed the Ninth National Bank, getting away, on my first attempt, with
  three hundred thousand dollars. I will not give you a long list of my many
  crimes; some of them I have conveniently forgotten. Others are too
  unimportant, and contain too many disappointments to tell you in detail. It
  is sufficient to say that there is no proof, other than my word, that I was
  responsible for any of these depredations. My name has only been associated
  with one&mdash;the robbery of the strong-room on the <i>Mantania</i>.</p>

  <p>"In 1898 I learnt that the <i>Mantania</i> was carrying to France
  fifty-five million francs in paper currency. The money was packed in two
  stout wooden cases, and before being packed, was submitted to hydraulic
  pressure in order to reduce the bulk. In one case were thirty-five packets,
  each containing a thousand mille notes, and in the second case twenty
  packets. I particularly want you to remember that there were two cases,
  because you will understand a little better what happened subsequently.</p>

  <p>"It was intended that the ship should call at a French port; I think it
  was Havre, because the trans-Atlantic boats in those days did not call at
  Cherbourg. I had made all my plans for getting away with the stuff, and the
  robbery had actually been committed and the boxes were in my cabin trunk,
  substitute boxes of an exact shape having been left in the strong-room of the
  <i>Mantania</i>, when to my dismay we lost a propeller blade whilst off the
  coast of Ireland, and the captain of the <i>Mantania</i> decided to put in to
  Southampton without making the French port.</p>

  <p>"A change of plans, to a man of my profession, is almost as embarrassing
  as a change of plan in the middle of a battle. I had on this occasion an
  assistant&mdash;a man who afterwards died in <i>delirium tremens</i>. It was
  absolutely impossible to work alone; the job was too big, and my assistant
  was a man I had every reason to trust."</p>

  <p>"Harry Lyme?" suggested Elk.</p>

  <p>"Joshua Broad" shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, you're wrong. I will not tell you his name&mdash;the man is dead, and
  he was a very faithful and loyal fellow, though inclined to booze, a weakness
  which I never shared. However, the reason we were so embarrassed was that,
  had we gone ashore at the French port, the robbery in the strongroom would
  not have been discovered, because it was unlikely that the purser would go to
  the strong-room until the ship was in Southampton Water. I had fixed
  everything, the passing of my bags through the Customs being the most
  important. This change meant that we must improvise a method to get ashore at
  Southampton before the hue and cry was raised, and, if possible, before the
  robbery was discovered, though it did not seem possible that we should
  succeed.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately, there was a fog in the Solent, and we had to go dead slow;
  and, if you remember the circumstances, as the <i>Mantania</i> came up the
  Solent, she collided with a steam dredger that was going into Portsmouth. The
  dredger's foremast became entangled in the bowsprit of the <i>Mantania</i>
  and it was some time before they were extricated. It was then that I seized
  my opportunity. From an open port-way on my deck, where we were waiting with
  our baggage, ready to land, we were level with the side of the dredger as she
  swung round under the impact. I flung the two grips that held the boxes on to
  the dredger's deck, and I and my friend jumped together.</p>

  <p>"As I say, a fog lay on the water, and we were not seen, and not
  discovered by the crew of the dredger until we had parted company with the
  <i>Mantania</i>, and although the story we told to the dredger's captain was
  the thinnest imaginable&mdash;namely, that we thought it was a tender that
  had come off to collect us&mdash;he very readily accepted it, and the
  twenty-dollar bill which I gave him.</p>

  <p>"We made Portsmouth after a great deal of difficulty late in the evening.
  There was no Customs inspection and we got our bags safely on land. I
  intended staying the night at Portsmouth, but after we had taken our
  lodgings, my friend and I went round to a little bar to get a drink, and
  there we heard something which sent us back to our rooms at full pelt. What
  we heard was that the robbery had been discovered, and that the police were
  looking for two men who had made their escape on the dredger. As it was the
  dredger's captain who had recommended our lodgings, I had little expectation
  of getting into the room and out again without capture.</p>

  <p>"However, we did, and as we passed out of the street at one end, the
  police came in at the other. I carried one bag, my friend the lighter, and we
  started on foot across country, and before the morning we had reached a place
  called Eastleigh. It was to Eastleigh, you will remember, Mr. Elk, that I
  came when I left the cattle-boat during the war and suddenly changed my
  character from a hard-up cattle-puncher to a wealthy gambler at Monte
  Carlo.</p>

  <p>"That matter I will explain later. When we reached Eastleigh, I had a talk
  with my companion, and it was a pretty straight talk, because he'd got a load
  of liquor on board and was becoming more and more unreliable. It ended by his
  going into the town to buy some food and not returning. When I went in search
  of him, I found him lying in the street, incapably drunk. There was nothing
  to do but to leave him; and getting a little food, I took the two bags and
  struck the road. The bags, however, were much too heavy for, me, and I had to
  consider my position.</p>

  <p>"Standing by the road was an old cottage, and on a board was an
  announcement that it was to be sold. I took the address; it was the name of a
  Winchester lawyer; and then I got over the fence and made an inspection of
  the ground, to find that, at the lower end of the rank garden, was an old,
  disused well, boarded over by rotten planks. I could in safety drop the
  lighter of my burdens down the well and cover it up with the rubble, of which
  there was plenty around. I might have buried both; in many ways a lot of
  trouble would have been saved if I had. But I was loth to leave all that I
  had striven for with such care and pains, and I took the second box on with
  me, reached Winchester, bought a change of clothing, and spent a comfortable
  day there, interviewing the lawyer, who owned the cottage.</p>

  <p>"I had some English money with me, and the purchase was effected. I gave
  strict instructions that the place was not to be let in any circumstances,
  and that it was to remain as it was until I came back from Australia&mdash;I
  posed as a wealthy Australian who was repurchasing the house in which he was
  born.</p>

  <p>"From Winchester I reached London, never dreaming that I was in any
  danger. My companion had given me the name of an English crook, an
  acquaintance of his, who, he said, was the finest safe-man in Europe&mdash;a
  man who was called 'Lyme' and who, I discovered many years after, was the
  same Harry Lyme. He told me Lyme would help me in any emergency.</p>

  <p>"And that emergency soon arose. The first man I saw when I put my foot on
  the platform at Waterloo was the purser of the <i>Mantania</i>, and with him
  was the ship's detective. I dodged back, and, fortunately for me, there was a
  suburban train leaving from the opposite platform, and I went on to Surbiton,
  reaching London by another route. Afterwards, I learnt that my companion had
  been arrested, and in his half-drunken state had told all he knew. The thing
  to do now was to cache the remainder of the money&mdash;thirty-five million
  francs. I immediately thought of Harry Lyme. I have never suffered from the
  illusion that there is honour amongst thieves. My own experience is that that
  is one of the most stupid of proverbs. But I thought that at least I might
  make it worth Lyme's while to help me out of a mess.</p>

  <p>"I learnt from the newspapers that there was a special force of police
  looking for me, and that they were watching the houses of well-known
  criminals, to whom, they thought, I might gravitate. At first I thought this
  was a bluff, but I was to discover that this was not the case. I reached
  Lyme's house, in a disreputable thoroughfare in Camden Town. The fog was
  thick and yellow, and I had some difficulty in finding my way. It was a small
  house in a mean, squalid street, and at first I could get no reply to my
  knocking. Then the door was opened cautiously.</p>

  <p>"'Is that Lyme?' I asked. 'He's not at home,' said a man, and he would
  have shut the door, but my instinct told me this was the fellow I was
  seeking, and I put my foot in the way of the closing door. 'Come in,' he said
  at last, and led the way into a small room, the only light of which was a
  lantern which stood on the table. The room was thick with fog, for the window
  was open, as I learnt afterwards, to allow Lyme to make his escape.</p>

  <p>"'Are you the American?' he asked. 'You're mad to come here. The police
  have been watching this place ever since this afternoon.' I told him briefly
  what my difficulty was. 'I have here thirty-five million francs&mdash;that's
  a million, three hundred thousand pounds,' said I, 'and there's enough for
  both of us. Can you plant this whilst I make a get-away?' 'Yes, I will,' he
  said. 'What do I get out of it?' 'I'll give you half,' I promised, and he
  seemed to be satisfied with that.</p>

  <p>"I was surprised that he spoke in the voice and tone of an educated man,
  and I learnt afterwards that he also had been intended for some profession,
  and, like myself, had chosen the easier way. Now, you'll not believe me when
  I tell you that I did not see his face, and that I carried no very vivid
  impression away with me. This is due to the fact that I concentrated my
  attention upon the frog which was tattooed on his wrist, and which
  afterwards, at great expense, he succeeded in having removed by a Spanish
  doctor it Valladolid, who specialized in that kind of work. That frog was
  tattooed a little askew, and I knew, and he knew too, that, whether I
  remembered his face or not, he had a mark which was certain to guide me back
  to him.</p>

  <p>"The arrangement I made was that, when I got back to America, I should
  send a cable to him, at an address we agreed upon, and that he was then to
  send me, by registered post to the Grand Hotel, Montreal, a half of the money
  he had in the box. To cut a long story short, I made my escape, and
  eventually reached the Continent by way of Hook of Holland. Encumbered with
  any baggage, that would have been impossible. In due course I left for the
  United States from Bremen, Germany, and immediately on my arrival sent the
  cable to Lyme, and went up to Montreal to await the arrival of the money. It
  did not come. I cabled again; still it did not come.</p>

  <p>"It was months after that I learnt what had happened. It came from a
  cutting of a newspaper, saying that Lyme had been drowned on his way to
  Guernsey. How he sent that, I don't know and never have inquired. Lyme was,
  in fact, very much alive. He had some six million dollars' worth of French
  notes, and his job was to negotiate them. His first step was to move to a
  Midland town, where for six months he posed as a man of business, in the
  meantime changing his whole appearance, shaving off his moustache and
  producing an artificial baldness by the application of some chemical.</p>

  <p>"Whilst he was doing this, and determined that every penny he had taken
  from me he would hold, he decided to make assurance doubly sure, and started
  in a small way the Fellowship of the Frog. The object of this was to spread
  the mark of identification by which I should know him, as far and wide as
  possible. He may have had no other idea in his mind, and probably had not,
  but to broadcast this mark of the frog, a little askew, the exact replica of
  his. Obviously no class would be willing to suffer the tortures of tattooing
  for nothing. So began this curious Benefit Fund of his. From this little
  beginning grew the great Frog organization. Almost one of the first men he
  came into contact with was an old criminal named Maitland, a man who could
  neither read nor write."</p>

  <p>There was a gasp.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course!" said Elk, and smacked his knee impatiently. "That is the
  explanation of the baby!"</p>

  <p>"There never was a baby," smiled 'Broad.' "The baby was Maitland himself,
  learning to write. The clothes of the baby, which were planted for your
  special benefit in the Eldor Street house, were put there by Johnson. The
  toys for the baby were inventions to keep you guessing. There never was a
  baby. Once he had Maitland properly coached, he came to London, and Maitiands
  Consolidated was formed. Maitland had nothing to do except to sit around and
  look picturesque. His alleged clerk, one of the cleverest actors I have ever
  met, was the real head of the business, and remained Maitland's clerk just as
  long as it suited him. When he thought suspicion was veering toward him, he
  had himself dismissed; just as, when he thought you had identified him with
  the Frog, he made one of his men shoot at him with a blank cartridge in
  Harley Terrace. He was the real Maitland.</p>

  <p>"In the meantime the Frog organization was growing, and he sat down to
  consider how best he could use the society for his advantage. Money was going
  out, and he naturally hated to see it go. New recruits were appearing every
  day, and they all cost money. But what he did get from this rabble were one
  or two brilliant minds. Balder was one, Hagn was one, and there were others,
  who perhaps will now never be known.</p>

  <p>"As the controlling force of Maitlands Consolidated, he had not the
  slightest difficulty in disposing of his francs. And then he set Maitlands
  speculating in other directions, and when his speculations were failing, he
  found ways of cutting his loss. He was once caught short in a wool
  transaction&mdash;the Frog maimed the only man who could have ruined him.
  Whenever he found it expedient for the benefit of himself to club a man,
  whether he was a military attaché or a very plain City merchant speculating
  in his own stocks, Johnson never hesitated. People who were bothering him
  were put beyond the opportunities of mischief. He made one great mistake. He
  allowed Maitland to live like a hog in a house he had bought. That was folly.
  When he found that the old man had been trailed, he shifted him to Berkeley
  Square, got him tailored, and eventually murdered him for daring to go to
  Horsham. I saw the murderer escape, for I was on the roof when the shots were
  fired. Incidentally, I had a narrow escape myself.</p>

  <p>"But to return to my own narrative. Five years ago I was broke, and I
  decided to have another attempt to get my money; and there was also the fact
  that a very large sum of money waited reclaiming at Eastleigh, always
  providing that I had not been identified as the man who bought the house. It
  took me a long time before I made absolutely certain that I was unknown, and
  then, with the title deeds in my pocket, I sailed on a cattle-boat and
  landed, as you have said, Mr. Elk, with a few dollars in my pocket, at
  Southampton. I went straight to the house, which was now in a shocking state
  of repair, and there I made myself as comfortable as I possibly could whilst,
  night after night, I toiled in the well to recover the small box of money,
  amounting to a very considerable sum. When this was recovered, I left for
  Paris, and the rest, so far as my public history is concerned, you know.</p>

  <p>"I then began my search for Frog, and I very soon saw that, if I depended
  upon the identification of the tattoo marks, my search was hopeless.
  Naturally, when I discovered, as I soon did, that Maitland was a Frog, I
  narrowed my search to that office. I discovered that Maitland was an
  illiterate by the simple expedient of stopping him in the street one day near
  his house, and showing him an envelope on which I had written 'You are a
  fake,' and asking him if he knew the address. He pointed to a house farther
  along the street, and hurried in."</p>

  <p>"I knew that Maitland could neither read nor write when I learnt that the
  children's clothes had been left at Eclat Street," said Dick, "and from that
  moment I knew that Johnson was the Frog.</p>

  <p>"Joshua Broad" nodded.</p>

  <p>"That, I think, is about all I have to say. Johnson was a genius. The way
  he handled that huge organization, which he ran practically in his spare time
  when he was away from the office, was a revelation. He drew everybody into
  his net, and yet nobody knew him. Balder was a godsend; he was perhaps the
  highest paid agent of the lot. You will find that his income ran into six
  figures!"</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>When "Joshua Broad" had gone back to London, Dick walked with Elk to the
  garden gate.</p>

  <p>"I shan't be coming up for a little while," he said.</p>

  <p>"I never expected you would," said Elk. "Say, Captain Gordon, what
  happened to those two wooden boxes that were in the quarry hut last
  night?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't see the boxes."</p>

  <p>"I saw them," said Elk, nodding. "They were there when we took Miss
  Bennett away, and when I came back with the police they were gone, and
  'Joshua Broad' was there all the time," he added.</p>

  <p>They looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I should inquire too closely into that matter," said Dick.
  "I owe 'Broad' something."</p>

  <p>"I owe him a bit too," said Elk with a hint of enthusiasm. "Do you know,
  he taught me a rhyme last night? There are about a hundred and fifty verses,
  but I only know four. It starts:</p>

  <p>"William the Conqueror started his tricks, Battle of Hastings, ten
  sixty-six.</p>

  <p>"That's a grand rhyme, Captain Gordon. If I'd only known that ten years
  ago I might have been a Chief Commissioner by now!"</p>

  <p>He walked down the road towards the station, for he was returning by
  train. The sun glittered upon the rain-fringed banners of the hollyhocks that
  filled the cottagers' gardens. Then from the hedge a tiny green figure
  hopped, and Elk stood still and watched it. The little reptile looked round
  and eyed the detective with black, staring eyes.</p>

  <p>"Frog," Elk raised a reproachful finger, "have a heart and go home&mdash;
  this is not your Day!"</p>

  <p>And, as if he understood what the man had said, the frog leaped back to
  the shelter of the long grass.</p>
