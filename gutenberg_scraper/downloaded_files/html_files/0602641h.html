  <p class="first">ONE would hardly choose the life of an assistant professor
  of mathematics at an Eastern University as an adventurous one. Professors in
  general are reputed to drone out in a quiet, scholarly existence, and an
  instructor of mathematics might seem the driest and least lively of men,
  since his subject is perhaps the most desiccated. And yet&mdash;even the
  lifeless science of figures has had its dreamers&mdash;Clerk Maxwell,
  Lobachevsky, Einstein and the rest. The latter, the great Albert Einstein
  himself who is forging the only chain that ever tied a philosophers' dream to
  experimental science, is pounding his links of tenuous mathematical symbols,
  shadowy as thought, but unbreakable.</p>

  <p>And don't forget that "Alice in Wonderland" was written by a dreamer who
  happened also to be a mathematician. Not that I class myself with them; I'm
  practical enough to leave fantasies alone. Teaching is my business.</p>

  <p>At least, teaching is my main business. I do a little statistical work for
  industrial corporations when the occasion presents itself&mdash;in fact,
  you'll find my name in the classified section: Abner Aarons, Statistician and
  Consulting Mathematician. I eke out my professional salary, and I do at times
  strike something interesting. Of course, in the main such work consists of
  graphing trends of consumption for manufacturers, or population increase for
  public utilities.</p>

  <p>And occasionally some up-and-coming advertising agency will consult me on
  how many sardine cans would be needed to fill the Panama Canal, or some such
  material to use as catchy advertising copy. Not exactly exciting work, but it
  helps financially.</p>

  <p>Thus I was not particularly surprised that July morning to receive a call.
  The university had been closed for some weeks; the summer session was about
  to open, without however, the benefit of my presence. <i>I</i> was taking a
  vacation, leaving in two or three days for a Vermont village I knew, where
  the brook trout cared not a bit whether a prizefighter, president, or
  professor was on the hither end of the line. And I was going alone;
  three-quarters of the year before a classroom full of the tadpoles called
  college students had thoroughly wearied me of any further desire for human
  companionship; my social instincts were temporarily in abeyance.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, I'm not unthrifty enough to disregard an opportunity to turn
  an honest penny, and the call was far from unwelcome. Even the modest holiday
  I planned can bite deeply enough into the financial foundation of an
  assistant professor's pittance. And the work sounded like one of these fairly
  lucrative and rather simple propositions.</p>

  <p>"This is Court Strawn," the telephone announced. "I'm an experimental
  chemist, and I've completed a rather long series of experiments. I want them
  tabulated and the results analyzed; do you do that sort of work?"</p>

  <p>I did, and acknowledged as much.</p>

  <p>"It will be necessary for you to call here for your data," the voice
  continued. Strangely unctuous, that voice. "It is impossible for me to
  leave." There followed an address on West Seventieth Street.</p>

  <p>Well, I had called for data before. Generally the stuff was delivered or
  mailed to me, but his request wasn't extraordinary, I agreed, and added that
  I'd be over shortly. No use delaying my vacation if I could help it.</p>

  <p>I took the subway. Taxis are a needless luxury to a professor, and a car
  of my own was an unrealized ambition. It wasn't long before I entered one of
  the nondescript brown houses that still survive west of the Avenue. Strawn
  let me in, and I perceived the reason for his request. The man was horribly
  crippled; his whole left side was warped like a gnarled oak, and he was hard
  put to hobble about the house. For the rest&mdash;stringy dark hair, and
  little tense eyes.</p>

  <p>He greeted me pleasantly enough, and I entered a small library, while my
  host hobbled over to a littered desk, seating himself facing me. The deep-set
  eyes looked me over, and he chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Are you a good mathematician, Dr. Aarons?" he asked. There was more than
  a hint of a sneer in his voice.</p>

  <p>"My work has been satisfactory," I answered, somewhat nettled. "I've been
  doing statistical work for several years."</p>

  <p>He waved a shriveled left hand.</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;of course! I don't doubt your practical ability. Are you,
  however, well versed in the more abstract branches&mdash;the theory of
  numbers, for instance, or the hyper-spatial mathematics?"</p>

  <p>I was feeling rather irritated. There was something about the
  man&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I don't see that any of this is necessary in statistical analysis of
  experimental results," I said. "If you'll give me your data, I'll be
  going."</p>

  <p>He chuckled again, seemingly hugely amused. "As a matter of fact, Dr.
  Aarons," he said smirking, "the experiment isn't completed yet. Indeed, to
  tell the truth, it is just beginning."</p>

  <p>"What!" I was really angry. "If this is your idea of a joke&mdash;" I
  started to rise, thoroughly aroused.</p>

  <p>"Just a moment," said Strawn coolly. He leveled a very effective-looking
  blue-barreled automatic at me. I sat down again open-mouthed; I confess to a
  feeling of panic at the sight of the cripple's beady little eyes peering
  along the ugly weapon.</p>

  <p>"Common politeness dictates that you at least hear me out, Dr. Aarons." I
  didn't like the oily smoothness of his voice, but what was I to do? "As I was
  saying, the experiment is just beginning. As a matter of fact, <i>you</i> are
  the experiment!"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" I said, wondering again if the whole thing might not be a joke of
  some sort.</p>

  <p>"You're a mathematician, aren't you?" Strawn continued. "Well, that makes
  you fair game for me. A mathematician, my good friend, is no more to me than
  something to be hunted down. And I'm doing it!"</p>

  <p>The man was crazy! The realization dawned on me as I strove to hold myself
  calm. Best to reason with him, I thought.</p>

  <p>"But why?" I asked. "We're a harmless lot."</p>

  <p>His eyes blazed up with a fierce light.</p>

  <p>"Harmless, eh, harmless! Well, it was one of your colleagues that did
  &mdash;this!" He indicated his withered leg with his withered arm. "He did
  this with his lying calculations!" He leaned forward confidentially. "Listen
  to me, Dr. Aarons. I am a chemist, or was once. I used to work with
  explosives, and was pretty good, too. And then one of you damned calculators
  figured out a formula for me! A misplaced decimal point&mdash;bah! You're all
  fair game to me!" He paused, and the sneer came back to his lips. "That's
  simple justice, now, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Well, you can imagine how thoroughly horrified I was, sitting there facing
  a homicidal maniac with a loaded gun in his hand. Humor him! I'd heard that
  was the best treatment. Use persuasion, reason!</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Strawn," I said, "you're certainly entitled to justice. Yes, you
  certainly are! But surely, Mr. Strawn, you are not serving the ends of
  justice by venting your anger on me! Surely that isn't justice."</p>

  <p>He laughed wildly and continued. "A very specious argument, Dr. Aarons.
  You are simply unfortunate in that your name is the first in the classified
  section of the directory. Had your colleague given me a chance&mdash;any
  slightest chance to save my body from this that you see, I might be
  forgiving. But I trusted that fool's calculations!" He twisted his face again
  into that bitter leer. "As it is, I am giving you far more of a chance than I
  had. If, as you claim, you are a good mathematician, you shall have your
  opportunity to escape. I have no quarrel with the real students of figures,
  but only"&mdash;his leer became a very sinister scowl&mdash;"only with the
  dullards, the fakes and the blunderers. Yes, you'll have your chance!" The
  grin returned to his lips, but his eyes behind the blue automatic never
  wavered.</p>

  <p>I saw no other alternative but to continue the ghastly farce. Certainly
  open opposition to any of his suggestions might only inflame the maniac to
  violence, so I merely questioned. "And what is the proposition, Mr.
  Strawn?"</p>

  <p>The scowl became a sneer again.</p>

  <p>"A very fair one, sir. A very fair proposition, indeed." He chuckled.</p>

  <p>"I should like to hear it," I said, hoping for an interruption of some
  sort.</p>

  <p>"You shall. It is just this: You are a mathematician, and you say, a good
  one. Very well. We shall put your claim to the test. I am thinking of a
  mathematical quantity, a numerical expression, if you prefer. You have ten
  questions to discover it. If you do so you are free as far as I am concerned.
  But if you fail"&mdash;his scowl reappeared&mdash;"well, if you fail I shall
  recognize you as one of the tribe of blunderers against whom I war, and the
  outcome will not be pleasant!"</p>

  <p>Well! It was several moments before I found my voice, and began to babble
  protests. "But, Mr. Strawn! That's an utter impossibility! The range of
  numbers is infinite; how can I identify one with ten questions? Give me a
  fair test, man! This one offers not a chance in a million! In a billion!"</p>

  <p>He silenced me with a wave of the blue barrel of his weapon.</p>

  <p>"Remember, Dr. Aarons, I did not say it was a number. I said a numerical
  expression, which is a vastly wider field. I am giving you this hint without
  deducting a question; you must appreciate my magnanimity!" He laughed. "The
  rules of our little game are as follows: You may ask me any questions except
  the direct question, 'What is the expression?' I am bound to answer you in
  full and to the best of my knowledge any question except the direct inquiry.
  You may ask me as many questions at a time as you wish up to your limit of
  ten, but in any event I will answer not less than two per day. That should
  give you sufficient time for reflection"&mdash;again that horrible chuckle
  &mdash;"and my time too is limited."</p>

  <p>"But, Mr. Strawn," I argued, "that may keep me here five days. Don't you
  know that by tomorrow my wife will have the police searching for me?"</p>

  <p>A glint of anger flashed in the mad eyes. "You are not being fair, Dr.
  Aarons! I know you are not married! I checked up on you before you came here.
  I know you will not be missed. Do not attempt to lie to me; rather help me
  serve the ends of justice! You should be more than willing to prove your
  worth to survive as one of the true mathematicians." He rose suddenly. "And
  now, sir, you will please precede me through the door and up those
  stairs!"</p>

  <p>Nothing to do but obey! The stubby gun in his hand was enough authority,
  at least to an unadventurous soul like myself. I rose and stalked out of the
  room at his direction, up the stairs and through a door he indicated. Beyond
  was a windowless little cell ventilated by a skylight, and the first glance
  revealed that this was barred. A piece of furniture of the type known as a
  day-bed, a straight chair, a deep overstuffed chair, and a desk made up the
  furnishings.</p>

  <p>"Here," said the self-appointed host, "is your student's cell. On the desk
  is a carafe of water, and, as you see, an unabridged dictionary. That is the
  only reference allowed in our little game." He glanced at his watch. "It is
  ten minutes to four. By four tomorrow you must have asked me two questions,
  and have them well thought out! The ten minutes over are a gift from me, lest
  you doubt my generosity!" He moved toward the door. "I will see that your
  meals are on time," he added. "My best wishes, Dr. Aarons."</p>

  <p>The door clicked shut and I at once commenced a survey of the room. The
  skylight was hopeless, and the door even more so; I was securely and
  ingloriously imprisoned. I spent perhaps half an hour in painstaking and
  fruitless inspection, but the room had been well designed or adapted to its
  purpose; the massive door was barred on the outside, the skylight was guarded
  by a heavy iron grating, and the walls offered no slightest hope. Abner
  Aarons was most certainly a prisoner!</p>

  <p>My mind turned to Strawn's insane game. Perhaps I could solve his mad
  mystery; at least, I could keep him from violence for five days, and
  something might occur in the interim. I found cigars on the desk, and,
  forcing myself to a degree of calm, I lit one and sat down to think.</p>

  <p>Certainly there was no use in getting at his lunatic concept from a
  quantitative angle, I could waste all ten questions too easily by asking, "Is
  it greater or less than a million? Is it greater or less than a thousand? Is
  it greater or less than a hundred?" Impossible to pin the thing by that sort
  of elimination when it might be a negative number, a fraction or a decimal,
  or even an imaginary number like the square root of minus one&mdash;or, for
  that matter, any possible combination of these. And that reflection gave me
  my impulse for the first question; by the time my cigar had been consumed to
  a tattered stub I had formulated my initial inquiry. Nor had I very long to
  wait; it was just past six when the door opened. "Stand away from the door,
  Dr. Aarons," came the voice of my host. I complied perforce; the madman
  entered, pushing before him a tea caddy bearing a really respectable meal,
  complete from bouillon to a bottle of wine. He propelled the cart with his
  withered left hand; the right brandished the evil automatic.</p>

  <p>"I trust you have used your time well," he sneered.</p>

  <p>"At least I have my first question," I responded.</p>

  <p>"Good, Dr. Aarons! Very good! Let us hear it."</p>

  <p>"Well," I continued, "among numbers, expressions of quantity,
  mathematicians recognize two broad distinctions&mdash;two fields in which
  every possible numerical expression may be classified. These two
  classifications are known as real numbers on the one hand, including every
  number both positive and negative, all fractions, decimals, and multiples of
  these numbers, and on the other hand the class of imaginary numbers, which
  include all products of operations on the quantity called 'e,' otherwise
  expressed as the square root of minus one."</p>

  <p>"Of course, Dr. Aarons. That is elementary!"</p>

  <p>"Now then&mdash;is this quantity of yours real or imaginary?"</p>

  <p>He beamed with a sinister satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"A very fair question, sir! Very fair! And the answer&mdash;may it assist
  you&mdash;is that it is either!"</p>

  <p>A light seemed to burst in my brain! Any student of numbers knows that
  only one figure is both real and imaginary, the one that marks the point of
  intersection between the real and imaginary numbergraphs. "I've got it!" The
  phrase kept running through my mind like a crazy drumbeat! With an effort I
  kept an appearance of calm.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Strawn," I said, "is the quantity you have in mind zero?"</p>

  <p>He laughed&mdash;a nasty, superior laugh that rasped in my ears.</p>

  <p>"It is not, Dr. Aarons! I know as well as you that zero is both a real and
  imaginary number! Let me call your attention to my answer: I did not say that
  my concept was <i>both</i> real and imaginary; I said it was either!" He was
  backing toward the door. "Let me further remind you that you have eight
  guesses remaining, since I am forced to consider this premature shot in the
  dark as one chance! Good evening!"</p>

  <p>He was gone; I heard the bar outside the door settle into its socket with
  a thump. I stood in the throes of despair, and cast scarcely a glance at the
  rather sumptuous repast he had served me, but slumped back into my chair.</p>

  <p>It seemed hours before my thoughts were coherent again; actually I never
  knew the interval, since I did not glance at my watch. However, sooner or
  later I recovered enough to pour a tumbler of wine and eat a bit of the roast
  beef; the bouillon was hopelessly cold. And then I settled down to the
  consideration of my third question. From Strawn's several hints in the
  wording of his terms and the answers to my first and second queries, I
  tabulated what information I could glean. He had specifically designated a
  numerical expression; that eliminated the x's and y's of algebraic usage. The
  quantity was either real or imaginary and was not zero; well, the square of
  any imaginary is a real number. If the quantity contained more than one
  figure, or if an exponent was used, then I felt sure his expression was
  merely the square of an imaginary; one <i>could</i> consider such a quantity
  either real or imaginary. A means of determining this by a single question
  occurred to me. I scribbled a few symbols on a sheet of paper, and then,
  feeling a sudden and thorough exhaustion, I threw myself on the daybed and
  slept. I dreamed Strawn was pushing me into a nightmarish sea of grinning
  mathematical monsters.</p>

  <p>The creaking of the door aroused me. Sunbeams illumined the skylight; I
  had slept out the night. Strawn entered balancing a tray on his left arm,
  holding the ever-present weapon in his free hand. He placed a half dozen
  covered dishes on the tea-cart, removing the remains of the evening meal to
  his tray.</p>

  <p>"A poor appetite, Dr. Aarons," he commented. "You should not permit your
  anxiety to serve the ends of justice to upset you!" He chuckled with
  enjoyment of his sarcasm. "No questions yet? No matter; you have until four
  tomorrow for your next two."</p>

  <p>"I have a question," I said, more thoroughly awakened. I rose and spread
  the sheet of paper on the desk.</p>

  <p>"A numerical quantity, Mr. Strawn, can be expressed as an operation on
  numbers. Thus, instead of writing the numeral '4' one may prefer to express
  it as a product, such as '2×2,' or as a sum, as '3+1,' or as a quotient, as
  '8÷2' or 8/2 or as a remainder, as '5&minus;1.' Or even in other
  ways&mdash;as a square, such as 2<sup>2</sup>, or as a root, such as
  &radic;16 or <sup>3</sup>&radic;64. All different methods of expressing the
  single quantity '4.' Now here I have written out the various mathematical
  symbols of operations; my question is this: Which if any of these symbols is
  used in the expression you have in mind?"</p>

  <p>"Very neatly put, Dr. Aarons! You have succeeded in combining several
  questions in one." He took the paper from me, spreading it on the desk before
  him. "This symbol, sir, is the one used." He indicated the first one in my
  list&mdash;the subtraction sign, a simple dash!</p>

  <p>And my hopes, to use the triviality of a pun, were dashed as well! For
  that sign eliminated my carefully thought-out theory of a product or square
  of imaginaries to form a real number. You can't change imaginary to real by
  addition or subtraction; it takes multiplication, squaring or division to
  perform that mathematical magic! Once more I was thoroughly at sea, and for a
  long time I was unable to marshal my thoughts.</p>

  <p>And so the hours dragged into days with the tantalizing slow swiftness
  that tortures the condemned in a prison death house. I seemed checkmated at
  every turn; curious paradoxical answers defeated my questions.</p>

  <p>My fourth query, "Are there any imaginaries in your quantity?" elicited a
  cool, definite "No," My fifth, "How many digits are used in this expression?"
  brought forth an equally definite "Two."</p>

  <p>Now there you are! What two digits connected by a minus sign can you name
  whose remainder is either real or imaginary? "An impossibility," I thought.
  "This maniac's merely torturing me!" And yet&mdash;somehow Strawn's madness
  seemed too ingenious, too clever, for such an answer. He was sincere in his
  perverted search for justice. I'd have sworn to that.</p>

  <p>On my sixth question, I had an inspiration! By the terms of our game,
  Strawn was to answer any question save the direct one, "What is this
  expression?" I saw a way out! On his next appearance I met him with feverish
  excitement, barely waiting for his entrance to begin my query.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Strawn! Here is a question you are bound by your own rules to answer.
  Suppose we place an equal sign after your quantity, what number or numbers
  will complete the equation: <i>What is the quantity equal to?</i>"</p>

  <p>Why was the fiend laughing? Could he squirm out of that poser?</p>

  <p>"Very clever, Dr. Aarons. A very clever question. And the answer is
  &mdash;anything!"</p>

  <p>I suppose I shouted. "Anything! Anything! Then you're a fraud, and your
  game's a damnable trickery. There's no such expression!"</p>

  <p>"But there is, Doctor! A <i>good</i> mathematician could find it!" And he
  departed, still laughing.</p>

  <p>I spent a sleepless night. Hour after hour I sat at that hateful desk,
  checking my scraps of information, thinking, trying to remember fragments of
  all-but-forgotten theories. And I found solutions! Not one, but several.
  Lord, how I sweated over them! With four questions&mdash;two days&mdash;left
  to me, the solution of the problem began to loom very close. The things
  dinned in my brain; my judgment counseled me to proceed slowly, to check my
  progress with another question, but my nature was rebelling against the
  incessant strain. "Stake it all on your last four questions! Ask them all at
  once, and end this agony one way or the other!"</p>

  <p>I thought I saw the answer. Oh, the fiendish, insane cleverness-of the
  man! He had pointed to the minus sign of my list, deliberately misled me, for
  all the time the symbol had meant the bar of a fraction. Do you see? The two
  symbols are identical&mdash;just a simple dash&mdash;but one use means
  subtraction and the other division!"1&minus;1" means zero, but "1/1" means
  one! And by division his problem could be solved. For there is a quantity
  that means literally anything, real number or imaginary, and that quantity is
  "0/0"! Yes, zero divided by zero. You'd think offhand that the answer'd be
  zero, or perhaps one, but it isn't, not necessarily. Look at it like this:
  take the equation "2×3 = 6." See? That's another way of saying that two goes
  into six three times. Now take "0×6 = 0." Perfectly correct, isn't it? Well,
  in that equation <i>zero goes into zero six times</i>! Or "0/0 = 6"! And so
  on for any number, real or imaginary&mdash;zero divided by zero equals
  anything!</p>

  <p>And that's what I figured the fiend had done. Pointed to the minus sign
  when he meant the bar of a fraction, or division!</p>

  <p>He came in grinning at dawn.</p>

  <p>"Are your questions ready, Dr. Aarons? I believe you have four
  remaining."</p>

  <p>I looked at him. "Mr. Strawn, is your concept zero divided by zero?"</p>

  <p>He grinned, "No, sir, it is not!"</p>

  <p>I wasn't disheartened. There was just one other symbol I had been thinking
  of that would meet the requirement&mdash;one other possibility. My eighth
  question followed. "Then is it infinity divided by infinity?"</p>

  <p>The grin widened. "It is not, Dr. Aarons."</p>

  <p>I was a little panicky then! The end loomed awfully near! There was one
  way to find out if the thing was fraudulent or not; I used my ninth
  question:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Strawn, when you designated the dash as the mathematical symbol used
  in your expression, did you mean it as the bar of a fraction or as the sign
  of subtraction?"</p>

  <p>"As the subtraction sign, Dr. Aarons, You have one more question. Will you
  wait until tomorrow to ask it?"</p>

  <p>The fiend was grinning in huge enjoyment. Thoroughly confident, he was, in
  the intricacies of his insane game. I hesitated in a torture of frenzied
  indecision. The appalling prospect of another agonized night of doubts
  decided me.</p>

  <p>"I'll ask it now, Mr. Strawn!"</p>

  <p>It <i>had</i> to be right! There weren't any other possibilities; I'd
  exhausted all of them in hour after hour of miserable conjecture!</p>

  <p>"Is the expression&mdash;the one you're thinking of&mdash;infinity minus
  infinity?"</p>

  <p>It was! I knew it by the madman's glare of amazed disappointment.</p>

  <p>"The devil must have told you!" he shrieked. I think there were flecks of
  froth on his lips. He lowered the gun in his hand as I edged toward the door;
  he made no move to stop me, but stood in a sort of desolate silence, until I
  gained the top of the stairway. Then&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute!" he screamed. "You'll tell them! Wait just a minute, Dr.
  Aarons!"</p>

  <p>I was down the stairs in two leaps, and tugging at the door. Strawn came
  after me, his gun leveled. I heard it crash as the door opened and I slipped
  out into a welcome daylight.</p>

  <p>Yes, I reported him. The police got him as he was slipping away and
  dragged him before an alienist. Crazy, but his story was true; he <i>had</i>
  been mangled in an experimental laboratory explosion.</p>

  <p>Oh, the problem? Don't you see? Infinity is the greatest expression of
  number possible&mdash;a number greater than any conceivable. Figure it out
  like this:</p>

  <p>The mathematician's symbol for infinity is a tipsy eight&mdash;so:
  &infin;</p>

  <p>Well, take the question, &infin;+6=&infin;. That's true, because you can't
  add anything to infinity that will make it any greater than it is. See? It's
  the greatest possible number already. Well then, just by transposition,
  &infin;&minus;&infin;=6. And so on; the same system applies to any
  conceivable number, real or imaginary.</p>

  <p>There you are! Infinity minus itself may equal any quantity, absolutely
  <i>any</i> number, real or imaginary, from zero to infinity. No, there was
  nothing wrong with Court Strawn's mathematics.</p>
