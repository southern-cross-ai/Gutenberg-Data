<h2><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src=
"1501111h-images/pioneers-9.jpg" alt="Illustration">
</p>

<p>A graveyard tells a story. St John's historic cemetery at Gordon
provides a microcosmic view of life on Sydney's upper north shore
from the early days of white settlement until the present. As we
pause to read an impressive inscription on a grand monument or a
simple epitaph on a child's home made cross, we can empathise with
the mourners, themselves long gone. Who were these people? Why such
an early death or curious inscription? What sort of life did they
lead and why were they buried here? The more we seek, the more we
get only tantalising glimpses into lives that link our present with
our past &mdash; and the more we are inspired to search deeper.</p>

<p>The three years' preparation for this book, written from an
historical perspective, has been undertaken to mark the centenary
of the official establishment in 1893 of the Church of England
(Anglican) Parish of Gordon and Hornsby. We look at the development
of the cemetery and the community it served, at the lives of some
of the people interred there and at the changes in mourning and
funeral customs since the first burial in 1867. Finally, we
consider some of the issues involved in maintaining the cemetery as
a valuable part of our heritage.</p>

<p>Many people and organisations have contributed to the research.
However lack of available church records, particularly for early
periods in the cemetery's development, has made the task difficult.
Facts are as accurate as possible but any corrections or further
information would be welcomed. Where discrepancies exist (in
spelling of names, dates etc.), preference has usually been given
to headstone inscriptions and family information rather than burial
register entries, which are only as accurate as the recorder. With
a total of over 1,800 interments in the cemetery and columbarium,
it has obviously not been possible to mention all of them in a book
of this size. However, I have been deeply impressed by the
wonderful contributions made to the church and community by so many
of the people commemorated there &mdash; and to them this book is
dedicated.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER 1<br>
<br>
THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src=
"1501111h-images/pioneers-6.jpg" alt="Illustration">
</p>

<p>Rows of crosses? Graves with ghostly shadows? Are these your
images of a graveyard? To some people a cemetery is macabre, to
others fascinating. For a burial ground is not only a reminder of
death; it is also a looking glass which reflects our heritage and
establishes links with those pioneers who helped shape our present
society.</p>

<p>Today, Australians are searching for individual and national
identity. By delving into our past, we can discover just who our
ancestors were, how they lived and what they achieved. Our local
cemetery is a good place to start.</p>

<p><i><b>White Settlement</b></i>
</p>

<p>From across Gordon's busy Pacific Highway, a bust of Australia's
first Governor, Captain Arthur Phillip, surveys St John's church
and churchyard. The replica reminds us that in April 1788, Phillip
led a reconnaissance party from Manly Cove upstream through the
Stoney Creek (St Ives) area, seeking fertile land for growing
crops. On this journey, he noted the tall trees which were to
provide much timber for the growing colony. This land had been home
for centuries to Aboriginal people such as the Guringai but white
settlement brought smallpox to which they had no resistance. By the
1850s most had vanished from the area.</p>

<p>A study of the occupations of those buried in the cemetery
reveals that early white settlers were mainly sawyers and
orchardists. In the early 19th century, settlement in Lane Cove or
Hunters Hill (as the present Ku-ring-gai district was then known)
was sparse. Activity first centred around the Government Sawing
Establishment near Fiddens Wharf on the Lane Cove River. Governor
Macquarie also made a number of small grants in the area. As the
land had first to be cleared, the earliest white inhabitants were
mostly sawyers, some employing convict labour. They felled the huge
trees, cut the logs in the sawpits and took them by bullock dray
down to wharves on the Lane Cove River. From there the timber was
floated downstream by barge to Sydney and Parramatta.</p>

<p>It was a rough and lawless life &mdash; the men worked hard and
drank hard, living on salt beef and damper. Women were scarce. The
Sydney Gazette of 25.2.1841 reported that <i>the Lane Cove district
has long been noted as the resort of disreputable people, and we do
not hesitate to say that there should be a military post to prevent
smuggling and sly grog selling.</i> Fights frequently broke out and
cock-fighting and bare-knuckle boxing were popular pastimes. When
the timber supply dwindled, many itinerant sawyers moved on to
Gosford or the northern rivers. A few stayed on and became
orchardists.</p>

<p>Their lot was not an easy one. Early settlers such as Robert
Pymble I and <b>Charles Buckingham</b>* began their orchards here
in the 1820s. Other occupations recorded for early burials at St
John's include <i>labourer, farmer, carpenter</i> and
<i>gardener.</i> <b>John Harwood</b> (d.1882) is listed as
<i>servant.</i></p>

<p class="footnote">[* In the text, the names of all persons
interred/commemorated in the cemetery and columbarium appear in
bold print.]</p>

<p><i><b>Beginnings of the Church and Cemetery</b></i>
</p>

<p>In this setting, the story of St John's church and cemetery
began. The first building on the site was a schoolhouse, the
earliest official reference to it being a public appeal for
subscriptions in the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> on 15 June 1816:</p>

<p class="letter"><i>A School, under the sanction and approval of
His Excellency the Governor [Macquarie], being about to be erected
by voluntary Contributions in the District of Lane Cove, for the
Cultivation of the Morals and promoting the Education of Children
of both Sexes, and also to improve the Females in other duties of
Domestic life...SUBSCRIPTIONS,however small, will be gratefully
received...His Excellency, on the Part of Government, has been
graciously pleased to bestow Ten Pounds Sterling...</i>
</p>

<p>Sufficient funds were presumably raised as a school was built
near the present church, with a teacher's residence attached. In
December 1816, William Baker became its first schoolmaster.</p>

<p>The schoolhouse was a small weatherboard cottage which stood on
part of 60 acres of land leased by the Anglican church for the
nominal annual rent of a peppercorn. The school was not successful.
In 1829 the building was in ruins and the timbered land, valued at
only £15, was declared <i>bad and without water</i>.* However, a
new school was built shortly afterwards and by 1839 was attended by
40 local children. It was reported that many of them were very
young; only four could read the New Testament and write &mdash;
both indifferently &mdash; and eighteen could do neither.**</p>

<p style="text-align:center">[Fig.2] <i>1867 Plan of Church,
School, Parsonage and Cemetery Sites,<br>
Parish of Gordon. (St John's archives)</i></p>

<p>At that time, a rough bush track (successively known as Pennant
Hills Road, Lane Cove Road, Gordon Road and Pacific Highway) linked
the district to Sydney, via harbour ferry. Settlement was sparse
and along the Lane Cove Road, in what is now Gordon, only the
school and a few scattered cottages existed.*</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>[* NSW Calendar and Directory,
1832.</i>]</p>

<p>The schoolhouse was also used for worship. Before becoming a
separate parish in 1893, the Lane Cove (Gordon) church district had
been annexed to Hunters Hill parish (then including Ryde and
Pennant Hills) and later to St Thomas' Willoughby (North Sydney).
Anglican services in the early years were infrequent but by the
1860s, on the last Sunday afternoon of each month, a clergyman
would ride on horseback from St Anne's Ryde or St Thomas'
Willoughby to conduct a service at Gordon.</p>

<p>As there were no local cemeteries, burials sometimes took place
on family properties. <b>Mary Ann Britton's</b> baby was buried in
1867 on Britton land &mdash; now Pymble golf links. <b>Sarah
Tawyer</b>, an early settler at Pearce's Corner, wrote in her
reminiscences that, when she arrived in 1843, <i>if a person had to
be buried, such a person had to be taken either to St Thomas'
[North Sydney], Ryde or Parramatta. Such being the state of things,
it was time someone tried to alter them.</i>*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>You Are God's Building</i> by Dr. R.
Nobbs, p.17.]</p>

<p>After a bushfire destroyed the schoolhouse in the mid-1860s,
Sunday evening religious services were held at the homes of
<b>James Pymble</b> (near present Pymble Station) and orchardist
James Terry (St Ives). They were conducted by Rev. William Wood
from Pennant Hills, who also performed the first ten recorded
funerals in St John's cemetery (1867-68).</p>

</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><i>[Fig.3] The three original trustees
of St. John's church and cemetery. (H. Selkirk)</i>
</p>

<p>By this time a permanent local church was much needed to cater
for the spiritual and social needs of the many Anglicans living in
relative isolation on the upper north shore. Long distance travel
was hazardous and most people were born, married and subsequently
died in their own district. Many local families, such as the
<b>McIntoshes, Pymbles, Browns</b> and <b>Waterhouses</b>,
intermarried. Nearly everyone in the early pioneering families was
related, however distantly.</p>

<p><i><b>A Church Is Built</b></i>
</p>

<p>Negotiations were begun in June 1866 for the purchase of three
acres of land <i>for a church, school, parsonage and burial
ground</i> on the site of the old schoolhouse (part of the original
60-acre church lease). Eventually a petition, signed by Rev. W.
Wood and 36 local residents, was sent to the Governor by the Bishop
of Sydney and the land sold to the church trustees at the following

<p class="footnote">[* <i>History of the Parish of St John the
Evangelist 1829-1923</i> by H. Selkirk, p.8.]</p>

<p><b>Robert Pymble II, William Henry McIntosh</b> and <b>John
Brown</b> <i><a href="#fig3">(fig.3)</a></i> were nominated as
church and cemetery trustees and the respective deeds delivered to
<b>John Brown</b> on 1 September 1871. All three men were prominent
local citizens.</p>

<p>The foundation stone of the Church of St John the Evangelist,
designed by ecclesiastical architect Edmund Blacket, was laid on 26
October 1872. The rector of St Thomas' Willoughby, Rev. W. C.
Cave-Brown-Cave, was licensed to officiate. Below the foundation
stone on a scroll, now missing, were the names of many well-known
local identities present, including <b>John Brown, William Henry
McIntosh</b> and <b>Robert Pymble</b> (original trustees),
<b>Thomas Waterhouse, James Pymble</b> and <b>Robert McIntosh</b>,
all of whom now rest in the churchyard.</p>

<p>Few early cemetery records remain. An 1867 map shows the
cemetery with <i>poor soil timbered with black butt, gum and iron
bark.</i> Various clergy officiated at church services and burials
until the arrival in October 1893 of the first live-in rector, Rev.
Raymond King (great-grandson of Governor King). Until then
record-keeping seems to have been haphazard.</p>

<p><i><b>A New Era Begins</b></i>
</p>

<p>The 1890s ushered in a new era on the upper north shore. After
the completion of St John's rectory, a continuous succession of
rectors helped provide stability in church and community life.</p>

<p>When the <b>Rev. George McIntosh</b>, who officiated at St
John's 1880-85, moved to St Paul's at Pennant Hills (Carlingford),
St John's depended on lay help until the Rev. Edward Crisford was
<i>licensed to officiate at Gordon and Hornsby</i> in 1890. There
was still no rectory and he and his young family lived in a house
on Pymble hill. Sadly, he died only weeks before the new rectory
was finished. No cemetery burials were recorded during his time,
though in fact they did occur.</p>

<p>In 1893 the church district officially became the Parish of
Gordon and Hornsby Junction, extending from Roseville to the
Hawkesbury River and Peat's Ferry. In 1888, mention was made in
church council minutes of a request to the Commissioner of Roads
and Bridges for a surveyed road from Lane Cove Road (Pacific
Highway) to the cemetery (St John's Avenue). In 1894 they reported
on <i>the uncared for state of the cemetery.</i></p>

<p>As the north shore railway line developed, Gordon Station was
opened in 1890 and the line extended from Hornsby to Milson's Point
in 1893. This encouraged the settlement of an affluent upper middle
class, as evidenced by the occupations of many residents later
interred in the cemetery. Some wealthy members of Sydney society,
seeking a healthy lifestyle and escape from city pollution, began
buying large blocks of upper north shore land from the developers.
These new arrivals built architect-designed homes from Killara to
Wahroonga and by 1900 the area had become Sydney's dress-circle
&mdash; a far cry from earlier decades. They were mainly the
families of successful professionals: lawyers, doctors, architects
and the up-and-coming commercial classes. Many became regular
parishioners at St John's.</p>

<p>By the turn of the century, the character of the district had
changed from rural to suburban. As the population grew, Anglican
daughter churches, such as Christ Church St Ives, St James'
Turramurra, St Swithun's Pymble and St Martin's Killara, were
formed. Many who helped establish them were eventually buried in
the cemetery at St John's, where they had formerly been
parishioners.</p>

<p>The Masonic movement gained a strong foothold on the north shore
in the early twentieth century. <b>Rev. Arnold Conolly</b>, rector
of St John's 1922-33, played a large part in the formation of the
Gordon Lodge and meetings were held in the church hall or vestry.
Known Freemasons buried in the cemetery include NSW Grand Master
<b>John Remington</b>, police sergeant <b>Edwin Hickey</b>,
merchant <b>Thomas Dudgeon</b>, headmaster of <i>Abbotsholme
College</i> John Fitzmaurice and longtime verger of St John's,
<b>Thomas Whalley</b>.</p>

<p>By 1900, 232 burials had been recorded. However, despite the
erection of elaborate monuments, grave maintenance seems to have
been largely neglected. As families moved away, many graves were
forgotten.</p>

<p>During World War I, St John's became the Garrison Church for the
18th Battalion (Ku-ring-gai Regiment) and its insignia now rests in
the chapel. Inscriptions on headstones and church plaques
commemorate those who fell. The Battalion's successor, the 2nd
18th, served in Malaya in World War II and rough wooden crosses
from battlefield cemeteries in both world wars hang in the chapel.

<p style="text-align:center"><i>[Fig.4] Graph showing main burial
periods for St John's cemetery</i>
</p>

<p>In the 1920s, the local population was outgrowing the original
church and cemetery. <b>Dr J. J. C. Bradfield</b>, who initiated
the design for a bridge across Sydney Harbour, realised the
increased population this would bring. <b>Rev. Conolly</b>, who had
been an architect before entering the ministry, engaged <b>Dr
Bradfield's</b> help and probably that of his predecessor's
brother, civil engineer <b>Christopher King</b>. Together they
planned an enlarged church, the cornerstone of which was laid in
1924. By that time, the 1900-20 peak burial period <i><a href=
"#fig4">(fig.4)</a></i> at St John's had already passed and the
Northern Suburbs cemetery at Ryde had opened in 1922.</p>

<p><i><b>Widening of St John's Avenue</b></i>
</p>

<p>As the district grew, so did the problems. By 1923 St John's
Avenue had been concreted, apart from the section outside the
cemetery. In 1926 the Gordon Progress Association wrote to the NSW
Health Department expressing belief that the cemetery was now full
and recommending closure as <i>seepage from the cemetery created
problems.</i></p>

<p>There followed a series of controversies and compromises between
Ku-ring-gai Council, trying to stop the burials and St John's
Church, wanting to continue them. Then in 1928 the council decided
to widen and concrete this section of St John's Avenue, which
involved resuming land in the lower corner of the cemetery.
Eventually an agreement was reached, with the church providing
additional rows W and P for burials and the council paying for
reinterments and transfer of headstones. These exhumations and
reinterments, undertaken by T. J. Andrews in October 1931, numbered
18 and took 2 years to complete. It would appear that approximately
14 graves, mostly of infants without headstones, remained where
they were.</p>

<p>Burials continued in the cemetery after this time but in
diminishing numbers. By the 1950s the cemetery was overgrown and
presented a problem. Major cleanups were attempted in the early
1950s and late 1960s.</p>

<p><i><b>Beginnings of the Columbarium</b></i>
</p>

<p>Although cremation had been practised for centuries by some
Aboriginal people, it was not until 1895 that the first European
was cremated in Australia.* Two arguments in favour of cremation at
that time were hygienic disposal of the dead and a solution to the
increasingly crowded graveyards. However, cremation was not widely
practised in Australia until the 1930s and it was only in December
1963 that the first stage of St John's columbarium (from the Latin
for <i>dove cote)</i> was built and niches made available at a cost
of £40 each. Where plaques record earlier deaths**, the ashes were
probably transferred from elsewhere. The wall now has over 950
niches, nearly two-thirds of which have been occupied.</p>

<p><i><b>Recent Years</b></i>
</p>

<p>Under the capable ministry of the much-loved Rev. Roy Wotton and
his wife <b>Marjorie Wotton</b> (d.1993) <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1714.html">[Col. E-7]</a>, in October 1972 St John's
church celebrated the centenary of the building of the original
stone church. By then, all the original pioneers associated with
its establishment had died and many had been laid to rest in the
cemetery. From 1979-91, Rev. William Weston, a writer of numerous
ecclesiastical books, was incumbent. Sadly, his successor for a few
brief weeks, <b>Rev. Cecil Kelley</b>, died in office. The present
rector is Rev. James Pettigrew, who has an active interest in
cemetery administration.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER 2<br>
<br>
GOD'S ACRE</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src=
"1501111h-images/pioneers-6.jpg" alt="Illustration">
</p>

<p>As we inherited the Anglo-Saxon tradition, graves in St John's
cemetery are laid out in simple rows, just as they are in the old
churchyards of England. There, a consecrated acre of land with the
church at its centre, was traditionally used for burials and became
known as <i>God's Acre</i>. This explains why one acre of land was
set aside for the establishment of St John's cemetery.</p>

<p><i><b>Burial Customs</b></i>
</p>

<p>Many Christian burial customs evidenced in the cemetery are of
Roman or Celtic origin. In early Christian Rome, shrines were
erected over the graves of saints and martyrs and in later
centuries churches were often built over these sacred sites, which
were enclosed in the crypt below. By the Middle Ages when burials
occurred inside a church, the coveted place near the holy shrine or
high altar was reserved for royals and high-ranking churchmen. The
best for which lesser mortals could hope were plots in the
churchyard, preferably beside the path from lychgate to church,
where passers-by might pray for them.</p>

<p>The custom of resting the deceased's body on a platform before
carrying it to the gravesite gave rise to the need for a shelter at
the entrance to the cemetery. This was known as a <i>lychgate</i>
(from the German word for <i>corpse</i>) &mdash; similar to the one
in front of St John's church.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src=
"1501111h-images/pioneers-5.jpg" alt="Illustration">
</p>

<p>Before the 19th century, many churchyards were neglected and
overgrown and sometimes became refuges for the lawless. If
unfenced, grazing animals often strayed in (as they still do in
some country churchyards), disturbing the headstones. So it became
the duty of a churchwarden to fence the burial ground.</p>

<p>Sometimes individual graves were also protected by willow sticks
or brambles &mdash; hence the 19th century practice of fencing
graves with wooden or decorative wrought-iron surrounds. At St
John's, a number of these grave fences survive &mdash; such as the
wrought-iron picket fence enclosing the grave <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person848.html">[E-20]</a> of builder, <b>Francis List</b>
(d.1884 aged 33). The <b>List</b> family erected <i>Lindfield,</i>
a cottage on Lane Cove Road after which the suburb is named. Fences
were also used to enclose family graves, such as that of the
<b>Fowler</b> family <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person624.html">[G-4]</a>,
dating from 1882 <i><a href="#fig5">(fig.5)</a>.</i> <b>Herbert
Cunningham</b> Fowler (d.1923 aged 91), a settler at Pearce's
Corner, acted as an unofficial mailman for local residents.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><i>[Fig.5] Fenced graves of FOWLER
family (photo: J. Hunter)</i>
</p>

<p>Burial customs have always been influenced by the attitudes
towards death prevalent at the time. In the 18th century, people
were haunted by the spectre of death, so headstones depicted the
grim reaper or the hour-glass. In the 19th century a softer
attitude prevailed and people could more easily envisage heaven
beyond. Many epitaphs include biblical quotations carrying messages
of faith and hope.</p>

<p>However the horrors of World War I altered these attitudes to
death as well as to life. A conspiracy of silence grew up and
people tried to ward off death by not talking or thinking about it.
These changing attitudes are reflected in the nature of the
cemetery headstones and their inscriptions.</p>

<p><i><b>Types of Crosses</b></i>
</p>

<p>The custom of erecting a stone on a grave probably began in
early pagan times with a person's desire for remembrance. Early
Christians in Britain carved these standing stones with Christian
crosses &mdash; hence the Calvary (Roman or Latin) cross used
today. Around the 5th century Irish Celtic crosses appeared in
England and tradition says that when the Celts first arrived there
they carried this cross, representing non-sectarianism.</p>

<p>Both the plain calvary cross and more elaborate celtic cross
were often used as headstones around the turn of the century. A
weathered sandstone calvary cross marks the grave <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person553.html">[AA-3]</a> of <b>Rev. Edward Crisford</b>,
curate-in-charge at St John's 1890-93, and a spectacular row of
five marble calvary crosses <i><a href="#fig6">(fig.6)</a></i>
commemorates the <b>Cardew</b> family <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1391.html">[W24-28]</a>. A similar cross garlanded
with passion flowers signifying Christ's passion marks the grave of
<b>Georgina Kidd</b> (d.1907) <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person982.html">[E-7]</a>. Another, on the grave <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person933.html">[G-27]</a> of <b>Rev. George Sheppard</b>
(d.1907) and his wife <b>Edith</b> (d.1914), appears as rough-hewn
stone but is actually made of concrete reinforced with wire.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a name="fig6" id="fig6"></a><a name=

<i>[Fig.6, Fig.7, Fig.8]</i>
</p>

<p>One of the loveliest memorials in the churchyard is the tall
celtic cross <a href="#fig7">(fig.7)</a>, with elaborately carved
passionflowers intertwined with lilies (crucifixion and
resurrection) on the grave <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person91.html">[JJ-1]</a> of <b>Alice Emily Adams</b>
(d.1906 aged 55). <b>Alice</b> was the first wife of William John
Adams, founder of the Australia-wide engineering company, William
Adams &amp; Co., which sold <i>everything for the engineer.</i>
William and their children are commemorated on her memorial.</p>

<p>A Maltese cross, as used by the Knights of St John, adorns the
black granite obelisk <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2290.html">[I-21]</a>
of civil engineer, <b>Thomas Birrell Marshall</b> (d.1901) and
forms the headstone <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person108.html">[KK-17]</a>
of <b>Alicia Hardy</b> (d.1911).</p>

<p><i><b>Symbolism</b></i>
</p>

<p>The Victorian attitude towards death is revealed on many early
headstones in the cemetery. Examples are the dove (holy spirit/hope
of resurrection) and open bible on the headstone of <b>Jane
Baker</b> (d.1882) <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1276.html">[G-16]</a>; and
the clasped hands (farewell/reunion) on that of <b>Alberto
Francis</b> (d.1914) <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person46.html">[MM-22]</a>.
Other imagery includes a lily with broken stem for a life cut short
(<b>Bridget</b> and <b>Daniel Bullock</b>, d.1885) <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person294.html">[B17/18]</a>; and a shrouded urn
representing the grail of sorrow (<b>Charles Buckingham</b>,
d.1868) <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person330.html">[A-7]</a>. Tiger-lilies and
lily-of-the-valley symbolise grief on the grave of <b>Robert
McIntosh II</b> (d.1899) <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2078.html">[C-22]</a> and roses represent everlasting
love on the grave of <b>Minnie Pierce Thomas</b> (d.1903) and her
daughter, <b>Annette Emily Jago</b> (d.1943) <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person160.html">[H-23]</a>.</p>

<p><i><b>Class Differences and Background</b></i>
</p>

<p>19th century headstones tended to reflect class divisions. Like
mourning customs, they made a permanent statement about the place
in society of the deceased and their families. Those who could
afford it often purchased a double plot or received a second one
free.* If wealthy, the family would erect a headstone at the time
of the first burial, adding successive names as required. Sometimes
a headstone was not erected until later when the family could
afford one.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Cemetery Trustee, Edwin McIntosh, noted in
1891 that persons who had purchased one grave plot measuring 8'x4'
for 24 shillings, had received another plot free.]</p>

<p>Some of the first settlers gained wealth and status in the
community but most sawyers and orchardists toiled hard with few
comforts. Most of their monuments were made of local sandstone and
many early settlers, such as the Mudie family <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person605.html">[GG5-6]</a>, could afford no memorials at
all. Rows L/LL, now grassed over, contain the unmarked remains of
many babies, some buried over a century ago, often in communal
graves.</p>

<p>Most people buried at St John's were Church of England but as
this was the only early local cemetery, a few folk of other
denominations, such as Methodists and an occasional Roman Catholic,
were also interred here. The majority of those buried were of
British descent. Yet a surprising number of early families
represented in the cemetery originated from other countries: the
<b>Bjelke-Petersens, Tanges</b> and <b>Lofbergs</b> from Denmark;
the <b>de Berengers, Bulteaus, le Bases</b> and <b>du Faurs</b>
from France; and the <b>Gaukrodgers, Schmeisings, Swarzas</b> and
<b>Dreis</b> from Germany. Others chose to anglicise their
surnames.</p>

<p><i><b>Types of Headstones</b></i>
</p>

<p>In the earliest burial rows, A to C, the headstones are mostly
upright stone slabs with carved imagery. When many settlers could
neither read nor write, these symbols could be easily understood.
The Burial Register shows no grave locations for the first hundred
entries so unless a headstone has survived, the deceased's final
resting place is usually unknown today.</p>

<p>Monuments in St John's cemetery represent most major styles over
the last 127 years. Although style periods overlap, they fall into
four main categories.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Upright slab headstones &mdash; with more
intricate carving towards the end of the century &mdash;
1867-1890s. Footstones, at the foot of a grave and facing in the
same direction as the headstone, usually bore the deceased's
initials and year of death.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Victorian-Edwardian free-standing
headstones in imported marble (e.g. angels, shrouded urns on marble
plinths, carved upright crosses) indicated the wealth and status of
the deceased's family &mdash; c.1890-1910.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Coloured and polished granite monuments
&mdash; early 20th century.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Smaller, plainer headstones &mdash; after
World War I.</p>

<p>Examples of the above styles are:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The earliest headstone erected at the time
of burial is that of 11-month old <b>Frederick Presper Rose</b>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person893.html">[M-35]</a>, infant son of Thomas
and Margaret Rose, early Wilberforce settlers. Frederick died on 3
December 1867. The grave is tucked away in the lower corner of the
cemetery. On the small headstone are inscribed these verses,
wherein the child comforts his bereaved family:</p>

<p class="poem"><i>You cannot tell how soon 'twill come<br>
There is an hour when you must die<br>
A thousand children young as I<br>
He called to death to bring them home.</i>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other early headstones are those of
ex-convict, <b>Charles Buckingham</b> (d.1868) and his wife
<b>Elizabeth</b> (d.1884), who were among the first orchardists in
Pymble. <b>Charles</b> could write but <b>Elizabeth</b> could only
sign her mark. A shrouded urn adorns <b>Charles'</b> memorial
<i><a href="#fig8">(fig.8)</a>,</i> erected by his twin brother. At
the end of the grave is a footstone <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person330.html">[A-7]</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Examples of Victorian-Edwardian
free-standing headstones are the two beautifully carved marble
figures on the <b>Brown</b> family plot <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1343.html">[E9-17]</a> &mdash; a sorrowful figure
clinging to a cross and an angel keeping watch. Draped urns on
marble plinths (1903) adorn the graves <i><a href=
"#fig9">(fig.9)</a></i> <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2286.html">[E1-2]</a>
of <b>John</b> and <b>Thomas Waterhouse</b>, early proprietors of
the <i>Green Gate Inn,</i> and of <b>Reuben</b> and <b>Sarah
Tawyer</b> <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2201.html">[F21-22]</a>, settlers
at Pearce's Corner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Early 20th century memorials include the
impressive grey/black granite monument <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2185.html">[DD-21]</a> to <b>Samuel Allen</b>, a
prosperous retail merchant in Townsville, Qld (d.1908); the black
granite column <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2292.html">[BB-4]</a> for
<b>Thomas Dolan Bertinshaw</b> (d.1913) founder of Richard Hunt's
clothing store; and the red granite obelisk <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1454.html">[EE-31]</a> commemorating <b>Joshua Percy
Josephson</b> (d.1911) who was appointed Hon. Surveyor and Engineer
for the building of St Martin's, Killara.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unusual memorial <i><a href=
"#fig11">(fig.11)</a></i> <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person387.html">[X-19]</a>, with a marble cross resting
diagonally on plinths across the grave, is that to <b>Christopher
Watkins King</b> (d.1924), great-grandson of Governor Phillip
Gidley King, and his wife, <b>Violet King</b> (d.1938). Plaques
commemorate other members of this branch of the family.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The simpler headstones which appeared
after World War I often consisted of a plain marble tablet on a
stone base, such as the memorial to <b>Rev. Henry John Noble</b>
(d.1940 aged 80), longtime rector of St Swithin's Pymble, and his
wife <b>Ruth Eunice Noble</b> (d.1954 aged 88) <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2175.html">[X-6]</a>. Graves were sometimes faced
with red terrazzo tiles or black and white squares. The Bradfield
family grave is faced with polished grey granite and two granite
plaques commemorate <b>Dr John Job Crew Bradfield</b> (d.1943), his
wife <b>Edith Bradfield</b> (d.1954) and their daughter <b>Margaret
Bradfield</b> (d.1984) <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1399.html">[PP-1]</a>.
There are also several headstones with military insignia, such as
those of <b>Patrick Simpson</b> (d.1950 aged 43) <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1975.html">[K-30]</a> and <b>John Nute</b> (d.1943
aged 41) <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1366.html">[PP-10]</a>.</p>

<i>[Fig.9, Fig.10, Fig.11]</i>
</p>

<p>Today, grave memorials usually consist of small bronze or pewter
plaques, attached to a concrete base. This is in keeping with the
present lawn-type cemetery approach.</p>

<p><i><b>Headstones That Tell a Story</b></i>
</p>

<p>The oldest headstone in the cemetery <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person669.html">[B-11]</a> was moved here in 1901 and
commemorates <b>Ellen McIntosh</b> (d.1826 aged 38) and her husband
<b>Robert McIntosh</b> (d.1829 aged 48), bandmaster of H. M. 46th
Regiment. They died <i>leaving 8 children to lament their loss.</i>
Their graves were originally located in the old Sandhills
(Devonshire Street) cemetery. When the land was resumed by the
government for Central Railway Station, their monument and remains
were transferred to the family plot in St John's at a total cost of
£8.5s.0d.</p>

<p>The headstone <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1803.html">[A-12]</a> of
<b>Mary Matilda Pymble</b>, daughter of <b>Robert Pymble II</b>
(original church trustee) and his wife <b>Amelia</b>, shows the
divine hand <i>(Dextera Dei</i> &mdash; right hand of God) holding
a scroll which bears her epitaph. <b>Mary</b> died from scarlet
fever at the age of eighteen in 1873. Her brother <b>Robert Pymble
III</b> was the family poet and penned her dying thoughts in his
poem <i>Departing:</i></p>

<p class="poem"><i>Dear brother, I am sinking fast,<br>
I hear the angels whispering low &mdash;<br>
Come, dear sister, we are waiting<br>
To lead you now from pain and sorrow...</i>
</p>

<p>Before he died at the age of 79, <b>Robert</b> requested in one
of his poems:</p>

<p class="poem"><i>Bury me in the morning,<br>
Let me have the light<br>
Of one bright day on my grave<br>
'Ere you leave me alone with night.</i>
</p>

<p>His wish was granted and his funeral took place at ten o'clock
on Friday morning, 9 August 1935. A calvary cross marks his grave
<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2081.html">[GG-8]</a>.</p>

<p>The headstone <i><a href="#fig13">(fig.13)</a></i> <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1288.html">[A-11]</a> of 20-year old <b>Jane
Elizabeth Swarzas</b> depicts a sad scene: a lopped tree represents
a life cut short and a dove with an olive branch (hope and peace)
hovers above a kneeling figure gazing faithfully at the cross. The
<b>Swarzas</b> family were early orchardists who lived beside the
Lane Cove River. <b>Jane</b>, wife of <b>George Swarzas</b>, died
in childbirth on 29 November 1875, followed by their baby's death
two weeks later. Victorian resignation to divine will is epitomised
in her inscription: <i>...Then check the tear and bow beneath the
rod, And meekly yield thy loved one up to God.</i></p>

<p>On the memorial <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person294.html">[B17-18]</a> of
<b>Bridget Bullock</b> and her husband <b>Daniel Bullock</b>, first
licensee of the <i>New Inn,</i> the stem of the tiger-lily is
broken near its end since <b>Bridget</b> died at 84 and
<b>Daniel</b> three months later at 88. Also buried in the family
plot are <b>Bridget's</b> daughter, <b>Charlotte Johnson</b> (née
Oliver, d.1880 aged 63) and her husband <b>John Johnson</b> (d.1893
aged 86), licensee of the <i>Sawyer's Arms</i> and the <i>Green
Gate Inn.</i> Charlotte was the local nurse and midwife who became
a highly respected member of the community.</p>

<p>Particularly poignant are memorials to young children, often
using themes of flowers and buds. The two little <b>Wood</b> girls,
<b>Dorothy</b> (d.1901) and <b>Phyllis</b> (d.1903), died of
diphtheria and are described on their headstone as <i>our little
darlings...two little buds in heaven</i> <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person498.html">[L-23]</a>. On the headstone of 10-year-old
<b>Violet Gregory</b> (d.1903) <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2349.html">[F-3]</a>, a dove perches on a cross,
below which is a scroll. This symbolises that her book of life has
yet to be written, as opposed to an open book for an adult.</p>

<p>Another touching memorial <a href=

18th century, fleeing during the Huguenot persecution. Augustus de
Berenger and his wife Helen* eventually migrated to Australia and

<p><i>The saddest of all ceremonies is that attendant upon the
death of relatives and friends, and it becomes us to show, in every
possible way, the utmost consideration for the feelings of the
bereaved, and the deepest respect for the melancholy occasion. Of
late, forms of ostentation at funerals are gradually diminishing,
and by some people of intelligence even mourning habiliments are

<br>
<i>&mdash; Australian Etiquette: Rules and Usage of the Best
Society in the Australasian Colonies.</i> 1885.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>

<p>Mourning and burial customs have altered over time and reflect
the changes in the society that created them. The customs we look
at in this chapter originated in Britain when Australia was still a
colony. Though convict transportation had ceased by the mid-19th
century, it was really not until federation in 1901 that
Australians began reaching for their own identity.</p>

<p><i><b>Victorian Mourning Customs</b></i>
</p>

<p>The Victorians came to terms with their grief through rigid
mourning procedures. Romantics they were, but sentimentality helped
ease their sense of loss in an age when many died young. Cemeteries
were considered peaceful places where family members could rest
together after death, visited by relatives and friends.</p>

<p>Mourning customs were never as elaborate in Australia as they
were back in Britain. In the 1890s The Funeral Reform Movement in
Sydney tried to discourage people from <i>the unnecessary expense
and display which have gradually become a part of our Funeral and
Mourning customs.*</i> Yet it was mainly the poor who followed
these reforms, as observance of elaborate rituals mirrored one's
place in society.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>In the Midst of Life</i> by G. M. Griffin
&amp; D. Tobin, p.100.]</p>

<p>The <b>length of mourning</b> depended on one's relationship to
the deceased. In the late 19th century, widows remained in <b>full
mourning</b> for at least one year, wearing dull black dresses
(nothing was allowed to shine) with black shawls, bonnets, veils
and gloves. Then they ventured into the <b>half mourning</b>
colours of white, violet, mauve and grey for a further year. Some,
like Queen Victoria, wore black for the rest of their lives. Men
also dressed soberly in black during mourning periods, wearing
black alberts on their fob-watches and black crepe bands on their
left arms. When someone in a poor family died, often the family's
entire wardrobe was thrown into a pot and dyed black.</p>

<p><b>Victorian mourning jewellery</b> was usually made of dull
black jet (mined from Whitby in northern England) or black enamel.
After the death of her husband, <b>Constance Remington</b> wore on
her collar a pair of 'widow's bones', each consisting of a 3-cm.
length of jet formed into a brooch.</p>

</p>

<p>Lockets were worn, sometimes with seed pearls (tears) and
carrying a lock of hair or portrait of the deceased. By 1900 gold
and silver jewellery was allowed during half-mourning.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><i>[Fig.15] Small In Memorium cards
&mdash; late 19th c. On FRANK COPPIN'S card, ivy symbolises undying
affection. (courtesy Edith Chase/Joy Wall)</i>
</p>

<p><b>In Memoriam cards</b> in the mid-19th century were often
large and impressive, designed for framing. They bore the
deceased's name, perhaps a photograph, along with their age, date
of death and an appropriate verse <i><a href="#fig28">(see
fig.28)</a></i>. However, by 1900 they were usually small and
plain, such as those of <b>Mary Jane Britton</b> (1891) and
<b>Frank Coppin</b> (1899) <i><a href="#fig15">(fig.15)</a>.</i>
Condolences were sent on black-edged notepaper in black-trimmed
envelopes. The custom of sending In Memoriam cards died out early
this century.</p>

<p><i><b>Victorian Funeral Rituals</b></i>
</p>

<p>In the late 19th century, the mourning and funeral customs
practised on the upper north shore would have been fairly simple
since most early burials at St John's were those of the families of
sawyers and orchardists.</p>

<p>People usually died at home. The bell-knob was draped in black
crepe and tied with a black ribbon if the deceased were old or
married, or with a white one if young or unmarried. The body was
respectfully laid out in the drawing-room where blinds and shutters
were drawn. The room was kept as dark and cool as possible while
posies of fragrant flowers and other deodorants were strategically
placed. Family and close friends would file by, paying their last
respects. A family member would make the funeral arrangements and
the local handyman the coffin.</p>

<p>In the 1880s-90s, professional undertakers emerged and began
visiting the family home to organise funeral and burial details,
including newspaper notices, In Memoriam cards and monumental
masonry. The undertakers, Wood and Company, conducted many of the
early burials at St John's.</p>

<p>The <b>funeral service</b> was normally held at the deceased's
home a day or two after death (no refrigeration then). After the
service, the coffin was carried to the hearse (or cart) to proceed
to the cemetery. For the wealthy, a horse-drawn hearse was used but
for the poor it was often a cart drawn by bullocks (see <a href=
"#fig1"><i>fig.1</i></a>, A Bush Funeral). With the coming of motor
cars, the term <i>motor funeral</i> in a newspaper notice hinted at
family affluence.</p>

<p>Usually only men took part in the procession and graveside
rituals.* The bell-ringer would toll the church bell. If the
deceased had rank or affiliations such as Freemasonry, relevant
insignia were placed on the coffin. Flowers were traditionally
white; a wreath for a child, a cross for a married person. After
the funeral, in polite circles callers dressed in black visited the
bereaved family, leaving their calling cards.</p>

<p class="footnote">
</p>

<p>[* In complete contrast, today's <i>White Ladies Funerals</i>
are run by women wearing white instead of the traditional
black.]</p>

<p><i><b>Early Burial Regulations at St John's</b></i>
</p>

<p>St John's earliest funerals were conducted by clergy from
neighbouring churches &mdash; Rev. William Wood, Rev. Edward Way,
Rev. William C. Cave-Brown-Cave and from 1880-85 the <b>Rev. George
McIntosh</b>. An extract from an 1878 list of burial charges during
Rev. George Bode's time is shown below:</p>

<p><i><b>20th Century Burial Customs</b></i>
</p>

<p>After World War I a new era dawned; elaborate funeral rituals
and grand memorials all but vanished. Soldiers and civilians often
died in hospital instead of at home and their bodies were laid out
by a nurse or undertaker. From that time on, funeral services were
usually conducted at a church or undertaker's chapel and
expressions of grief were restrained.</p>

<p><i><b>Funeral of Sergeant Edwin Hickey</b></i>
</p>

<p>An example of an early 20th century funeral of which we have
records is that of Police Sergeant <b>Edwin Stuart Hickey</b>
(d.1913 aged 52), a well-liked and respected local figure.
<b>Hickey</b> was transferred to the north shore from Darlinghurst
where he had earned the respect of the larrikin gangs. By 1902 he
had achieved the rank of Sergeant in the Pymble police
district.</p>

<p>On 1 May 1913 <b>Sergeant Hickey</b> and Constable Barclay from
Pymble Police Station visited the farm in Pittwater (Mona Vale)
Road, Pymble of orchardist Tom Brown. The officers were serving two
commitment warrants on him when trouble started between Brown, his
son and Constable Barclay. <b>Hickey</b> moved forward to protect
Barclay and was shot by Tom Brown. He died on the way to the Royal
North Shore Hospital and was buried in St John's cemetery the
following day. There was a huge public outcry.</p>

<p><b>Sergeant Hickey</b> was accorded a full police funeral
<a href="#fig16"><i>(fig.16)</i></a>, recorded in detail in the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i> of 3.5.1913:</p>

<p class="letter">The funeral of the late Sergeant Hickey, the
victim of the St Ives tragedy, took place at Gordon cemetery
yesterday afternoon and was attended by the largest concourse of
people that has ever gathered together in the district...<br>
<br>
From the church the funeral cortège made its way to the cemetery at
the back, where the interment took place, the mourners and public
standing round in a great mass...After the concluding...of the
general service, the Oddfellows' ritual for the burial of the dead
was read...the members throwing a sprig of evergreen into the grave
as they walked round it. The last rites of the Masonic Order
concluded the proceedings.</p>

<p>A red granite obelisk was subsequently erected on his grave
<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person583.html">[CC-17]</a> as a token of respect
by the government of NSW with a memorial plaque attached by the
Pymble Masonic Lodge.</p>

<p>Although St John's cemetery allows some interesting insights
into the changing way of death on the upper north shore, it is
perhaps the lives and achievements of the people resting there that
provide the most interesting study. Many descendants have
contributed information and it is unfortunate that space does not
permit all their stories to be told.</p>

<p><i><b>Local Pioneers and their Families</b></i>
</p>

<p>Much has been written elsewhere on the well known local families
of <b>Pymble, Brown</b> and <b>McIntosh</b>, who were instrumental
in the development of the district and establishment of St John's
Church.</p>

<p>The <b>Pymble</b> family has given its name to the suburb of
Pymble. Among the many family members buried at St John's is
<b>Robert Pymble II</b> (d.1910 aged 88) <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2080.html">[BB-17]</a> a successful businessman who
was a churchwarden and an original trustee of St John's
church/cemetery. The lovely window in the wall of the south nave is
dedicated to <b>Robert</b> and his first wife <b>Amelia</b> (née
Bartho, d.1880 aged 62) by whom he had four children. When he was
79 years old, the widowed <b>Robert Pymble II</b> married
20-year-old <b>Jessie</b> (née Loveday, d.1936 aged 59) by whom he
fathered another two children.</p>

<p>Before St John's church was built, services were often held at
the home of his brother, <b>James Pymble</b> (d.1886 aged 71), also
a churchwarden. <b>William Henry Pymble</b> (d.1950 aged 89)
<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2435.html">[A-13]</a>, a son of <b>Robert
Pymble II</b>, worked ardently for the church as collector,
organist and churchwarden. His cousin, <b>William Pymble</b>
(d.1948 aged 78:) <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2394.html">[DD-18]</a> was
also a churchwarden. The artistically-gifted <b>Pymble</b> family
provided music for the church and district. <b>Ruby Bromley</b>
(née Pymble d.1988) <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2163.html">[Col.
M-33]</a> was a talented artist.</p>

<p>More <b>McIntosh</b> family members are commemorated in the
cemetery than those of any other family. All are descended from
<b>Robert McIntosh</b>, bandmaster of H. M. 46th Regiment, and his
wife <b>Ellen</b>. Their son <b>Robert McIntosh II</b> (d.1889 aged
80) <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2078.html">[C-22]</a> and his wife
<b>Jane</b> (née Pymble, d.1882 aged 71) had ten children and owned
much property including an orchard on Lane Cove Road, opposite St.
John's church. Their eldest son <b>Robert McIntosh III</b> married
<b>Elizabeth</b> (née Archbold). On 9 June 1902, when in their
seventies, the couple died suddenly from natural causes within
minutes of each other at their Gordon home. The church pulpit
stands in their memory and their headstone <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2091.html">[B-23]</a> simply reads: <i>God's finger
touched them and they slept.</i> Other sons of <b>Robert</b> and
<b>Jane</b> include <b>William Henry McIntosh</b> (d.1913 aged 78)
<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2434.html">[BB-10]</a>, an original church
trustee who lived at <i>Gordondale,</i> the property on which
Gordon Railway Station now stands, and the <b>Rev. George
McIntosh</b>. Another son, <b>Edwin Archbold McIntosh</b> (d.1909
aged 66) <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person579.html">[AA-11]</a> owned a large
orchard east of the present Pymble Station, on which he built his
home, <i>Dalcross.</i> Though he and his wife Susan (d.1926 aged
69) <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2250.html">[AA-12]</a> had eleven
children, they found time to be active in community and church
life. <b>Edwin</b> was a churchwarden and for nearly 40 years
superintendent of St John's Sunday school. Daughter <b>Olive</b>
was Matron of <i>Dalcross Hospital</i> and <b>Linda</b> an
educational pioneer. McIntosh Street in Gordon is named after the
family.</p>

<p>The <b>Brown</b> family's patriarch was <b>John Brown</b> (d.
1884 aged 58) <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1343.html">[E-9]</a> a
self-made man of enormous energy and ambition, who rose from
uneducated timber-getter to eminent landowner. He married <b>Mary
Ann</b>, daughter of <b>Thomas Waterhouse</b>, and built their home
in Gordon on the site of today's Ravenswood School. Affectionately
known as 'the Squire', he developed a thriving orange orchard in
Wahroonga. There he achieved his ambition to own a square mile of
land. <b>John</b> and <b>Mary Ann Brown</b> are commemorated in the
beautiful stained-glass windows above St John's high altar. The
Brown men were renowned for their athletic prowess and bare-knuckle
boxing. Despite a superior education, none of <b>John Brown's</b>
sons matched their father's achievements. One son, <b>Ernest
Brown</b> (d.1921 aged 54) <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person956.html">[E-13]</a> a councillor on Kuring-gai
Council, is buried with his wife <b>Georgina</b> (d.1940 aged 69).
A number of streets in Wahroonga are named after <b>John</b> and
<b>Mary's</b> children.</p>

<p>Among the many early pioneering families represented in the
cemetery are members of the <b>Bartho, Bromley, Leal, Linigen,
List</b> and <b>Reely</b> families. Others include:</p>

<p><b>John Britton</b> <i><a href="#fig17">(fig.17)</a></i> (d.1911
aged 92) an enterprising and hard-working sawyer and orchardist,
owned 50 acres between Cowan Creek Road and Cowan Creek. Involved
in community and church affairs, he provided the timber rafters for
St John's original church, where he was a churchwarden and
collector of stipend. The burial of his first wife <b>Mary Ann</b>
is the first entry in the Burial Register. His second wife <b>Mary
Jane</b> (Baxter, d.1891) also rests in the cemetery <i><a href=
"#fig15">(fig.15)</a></i> <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1792.html">[A-36]</a>.</p>

<p><b>Walter Cates</b> (d.1901 aged 77)was brought out from England
with his wife <b>Alice</b> (d.1898 aged 63), to work as a gardener
on the Anthony Hordern property at Darling Point. The <b>Cates</b>
family <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2357.html">[M 16-17]</a> later owned a
16-acre orchard at St Ives.</p>

<p><b>Thomas Mazlin</b> (d.1894 aged 76), was an early orchardist
who helped establish the Methodist church in Stoney Creek (Mona

<p><b>John Pearce</b> (d.1886 aged 67), son of Aaron Pearce, ran a
sawpit and orchard near Pearce's Corner. He married
<b>Elizabeth</b> (d.1879 aged 65). Their son <b>Edward Pearce</b>
(d.1925 aged 76) and his wife <b>Kate</b> (d.1926 aged 73) had an
orchard in Stoney Creek Road, Gordon and were also prominent in the
Hornsby (Pearce's Corner) community <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person556.html">[B34-35]</a>.</p>

<p><b>Philip Fletcher Richardson</b> <i><a href=
"#fig18">(fig.18)</a></i> (d.1901 aged 64), a graduate of Trinity
College, Dublin, settled in St Ives and married <b>Julia</b> (née
Vernon, d.1924 aged 71). Unlike many orchardists, he was polished
and educated although his wife was rough and hard-working. He died
after falling from a horse-driven cart outside St John's. An active
parishioner, he is commemorated in a window above the chapel altar
<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1472.html">[M9-10]</a>.</p>

<p><b>John Sainty</b> (d.1882 aged 64) was an early settler. He had
an orchard in Merrivale Rd, Pymble and later built <i>Downham</i>
in Eastern Road, Turramurra for his second wife, <b>Amelia</b>
(formerly Amelia Bryant d.1908 aged 75), who was a widowed glover.

<p><b>William Vernon</b> (d.1890 aged 79) an English
horticulturalist emigrated to work at Sydney's Royal Botanic
Gardens. He was gardener to T. S. Mort at <i>Greenoaks,</i> Darling
Point (now <i>Bishopscourt,</i> residence of the Anglican
Archbishop of Sydney) and at <i>Cranbrook.</i> <b>William</b> and
his wife <b>Emma</b> (d.1892 aged 82) became orchardists at St Ives
and were renowned for their lovely garden. Two windows in St John's

<p><b>Thomas Waterhouse</b> (d.1884 aged 74) became a north shore
resident in 1835, prospering as a timber dealer, river boatman and
carpenter at Lane Cove. He bought the <i>Green Gate Inn</i> from
the Johnson family in 1853 and with his wife Lucy had thirteen
children. The family was known for its sporting activities. Son
<b>John Waterhouse</b> (d.1903 aged 67) was a celebrated
bare-knuckle fighter, succeeding his father as proprietor of the
<i>Green Gate Inn.</i> John became a large land owner and
orchardist. In 1875 he helped form the first committee to plan a
north shore railway <a href=

<p><i><b>Hornsby Pioneers</b></i>
</p>

<p>A number of early Hornsby pioneering families, such as members
of the <b>Dawson, Dennis, Jordan, Knox, Semon</b> and <b>Yeoman</b>
families, are buried at St John's where many were early
parishioners. Some other Hornsby pioneers are listed below:</p>

<p><b>Andrew Beattie</b> (d.1895 aged 56) and his wife
<b>Elizabeth</b> (d.1933 aged 86) were Scottish emigrants.
<b>Andrew</b> and his sons worked on the Woy Woy Tunnel and
Hawkesbury River Bridge <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person136.html">[M-11]</a>.
<b>Annie Harriett Beattie</b> [M-2], wife of their son Andrew, was
the eldest daughter of <b>Jeremiah Fear</b>.</p>

<p><b>Burton Crossland</b> (d.1920 aged 78) and his wife <b>Mary
Ann</b> (d.1907 aged 69) were early settlers in the upper reaches
of Berowra Creek. <b>Burton</b>, an orchardist and boat-builder,
constructed the first bush tracks between Hornsby and Galston.
<b>Mary Ann</b> lived a lonely life and was once visited by a
bushranger <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person304.html">[FF6-7]</a>. Their
daughter, also named <b>Mary Ann</b> (d.1897 aged 25), rests in the
cemetery <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1741.html">[E-5]</a>.</p>

<p><b>Jeremiah Fear</b> (d.1899 aged 68) had been a sea captain who
sailed a clipper to China. He and his brother <b>Jonas Fear</b>
(d.1907 aged 81)<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1428.html">[MM-2]</a> owned
adjacent orchards at Hookham's Corner, Hornsby. Two of <b>Jeremiah

<p><b>Charles Leek</b> senior (d.1907 aged 87) and his wife
<b>Elizabeth</b> (d.1908 aged 77) were orchardists. <b>Charles</b>
played an important part in the development of Normanhurst and

<p><i><b>Shepherds Unto Their Flock</b></i>
</p>

<p>Clergymen and their families usually received free grave plots.
The following are those who served at St John's and who rest in the
cemetery or columbarium.</p>

<p><b>Rev. George McIntosh</b> (d.1917 aged 83), grandson of
<b>Robert McIntosh I</b>, was a farmer before entering the
ministry. He and his wife <b>Ann Jane McIntosh</b> (d.1939 aged 94)
had fifteen children. He served as a visiting priest at St John's
from 1880-1885. As there was no rectory, he was accommodated on
these visits at his parents' home opposite the church. He
subsequently became rector of St Paul's, Pennant Hills
(Carlingford). Travelling on horseback to preach at Bayview, he
always carried a revolver in case of bushrangers. <b>Rev.
George</b> was also an accomplished bare-knuckle boxer. The story
is told how, on a visit to Kurri Kurri, he found the people hostile
towards religious services. He offered to fight the best man in
town <i>after</i> each service. He not only won the first fight
but, as a result, their high esteem <a href=

<p><b>Rev. Edward Crisford</b> (d.1893 aged 54) originally from
Sussex, England, was raised in a Methodist family but entered the
C. of E. ministry. His first appointment was as Deacon in Booligal,
where he married Alice (née Humphreys &mdash; d.1936 aged 88). In
1890 he was appointed to St John's at Gordon, living with his young
family in a cottage on Pymble hill. He travelled widely on
horseback ministering to his flock between Roseville and the
Hawkesbury River. <b>Rev. Crisford</b> collapsed and died during a
city visit only weeks before the completion of the new rectory. The
high altar is dedicated to his memory. His name is the first on the
board listing St John's rectors <a href=

<p><b>Rev. Arnold Conolly</b> (d.1933 aged 58) <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person191.html">[W-20]</a>,
second Rector at St John's
1922-33, was a churchman of great vision. He was also an artist,
writer and lover of church music. Ably assisted by his parish
councillor <b>Dr J. J. C. Bradfield</b>, he planned an enlarged
church for St John's, the cornerstone being set in 1924. <b>Rev.
Conolly</b> and his wife <b>Agnes Conolly</b> (d.1956 aged 81) were
of great assistance to the needy in the Great Depression. The
original church organ was given in appreciation of his ministry by
<b>Mrs Ruth Ruddock</b> (d.1935 aged 90) <a href=

<p><b>Rev. William F. Pyke</b>, third rector at St John's 1933-50
(d.1952 aged 67), was an English scholar and great preacher, whose
family life ended sadly. His brilliant 27-year-old son <b>Nigel
Philip Pyke</b>, a lecturer at Sydney University and researcher for
UNESCO, died in 1949 aged 27. The following year his wife <b>Ruth
Pyke</b> also passed away. Heart-broken, Rev. Pyke died two years
later. The family headstone is inscribed: <i>To be with Christ
which is very far better</i> <a href=

<p><i><b>Heroines on the Hill</b></i>
</p>

<p>Although often unheralded, women have played a vital role in the
history of the area. A few (mainly unmarried) achieved personal
recognition but the traditional function of a woman in the past was
one of caring for her husband and family. She was the mainstay of
home life. Often with up to fifteen children to nurture as well as
other domestic duties, she would have had time for little else! The
role of widows in society is revealed by such references as
<i>relict of...</i> on their headstones. Many women are buried in
family plots at St John's and to these pioneers, whose praises have
been largely unsung, this is a special tribute.</p>

<p>Below are some of the women interred in the cemetery and
columbarium who did achieve personal recognition:</p>

<p><b>Jane Baker</b> <i><a href="#fig21">(fig.21)</a></i> (née
Wood) convicted of stealing, arrived in the colony in 1827 aged 15.
At the Parramatta Female Factory, she was reputedly chosen as a
wife from a line-up of female convicts by ex-convict William Baker.
(Was he the same William Baker who had taught at the local
schoolhouse?) She bore him eleven children. The <b>Bakers</b> lived
in a hut west of the Lane Cove River and later 'bettered'
themselves by moving across the river. They became one of the early
orchardist families in West Lindfield, famous for their peaches.
When <b>Jane</b> died of diabetes at seventy in 1882, her funeral
notice justifiably stated that <i>her end was peace</i> <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1276.html">[G-16]</a>.</p>

<p><b>Henrietta Deane</b> <i><a href="#fig22">(fig.22)</a></i> (née
Barney, d.1922 aged 86 years) was an artist who, with her
better-known sister Maria Scott, took drawing lessons from Conrad
Martens. Henrietta is buried with her beloved son <b>George
Deane</b>, who died of pneumonic 'flu in 1908 aged 31 <a href=

<p><b>Eliza Edwards</b> <i><a href="#fig30">(fig.30)</a></i>
(d.1928 aged 81), sister of <b>J. G. Edwards</b>, at the age of
sixteen became postmistress of the first Gordon post-office. It was
located at the back of the cottage, still standing in the grounds
of Ravenswood School, where she and her mother lived. In 1860
<b>Eliza</b> received an annual government stipend of £12 for this
position which she held for 34 years <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person603.html">[K-18]</a>.</p>

<p><b>Helen Gillham</b> <i><a href="#fig23">(fig.23)</a></i>
(d.1974 aged 86) who trained at Sydney Hospital and nursed in
England and at Gallipoli, received a service medal from the
Australian Imperial Force. Returning home in 1920, she worked as
night sister at the <i>Eversleigh Hospital (Home of Peace)</i> in
Petersham for 26 years. She was an active member of the Church of
England Historical Society <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1110.html">[Col.
M-20]</a>.</p>

<p><b>Winifred Lloyd Jones</b> (d.1916 aged 40) granddaughter of
well-known congregational preacher Dr. Barzillai Quaife, married
Charles (later Sir Charles) Lloyd Jones at Trinity Congregational
Church, Strathfield in 1900. She was the first of his three wives.
The couple lived in Red East Cottage, Mosman <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person2475.html">[JJ-30]</a></p>

<p><b>Olive McIntosh</b> <i><a href="#fig25">(fig.25)</a></i>
(d.1977 aged 87 years) graduated in midwifery after World War I and
began <i>Dalcross,</i> a maternity hospital in Grandview Street,
Pymble. She subsequently moved to <i>Dalcross</i> in Killara where
she was the much-loved matron for forty years. This hospital has
played a significant role in community life. She did not marry but
loved children. Her headstone reads: <i>She gave of herself</i>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1942.html">[BB-11]</a>.</p>

<p><b>Linda McIntosh</b> <i><a href="#fig26">(fig.26)</a></i>
(d.1982 aged 88), sister of <b>Olive McIntosh</b>, was an
educational pioneer. After graduating from Sydney Kindergarten
College, she began her own pre-school <i>Dalcross</i> in Grandview
Street, Pymble after <b>Olive</b> moved to Killara. She later
taught at the Methodist Mission Kindergarten in Lautoka, Fiji and
at the Mt Lavinia School for Deaf and Blind Children in Ceylon.
Returning to Australia, Linda became principal of the C. of E.
Girls' College at Orange and later established her own school
<i>Loch Maree</i> at Vaucluse. Her headstone reads: A <i>friend to
all</i> <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1586.html">[AA-11]</a>.</p>

<p><b>Olive Nock</b> <i><a href="#fig24">(fig.24)</a></i> (d.1977
aged 84 years) was a textile designer and painter, who grew up amid
Lindfield bushland. At sixteen she entered her father's hardware
business of <i>Nock &amp; Kirby's</i> and at the same time took
drawing lessons from local artist George Collingridge. <b>Olive</b>
worked in a great variety of arts and crafts, including fabric
printing and china painting. She adapted Aboriginal motifs as well
as native flora and fauna designs to suit traditional crafts.
<b>Olive Nock</b> is represented at the Powerhouse and Mint Museums
in Sydney <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1943.html">[B-27]</a>.</p>

<p><b>Mary Augusta, Lady Poynter</b>, daughter of the U. S.
Consul-General in Constantinople, was the wife of baronet, Sir Hugh
Poynter, cousin of British P. M. Stanley Baldwin. She was an
accomplished poet and writer. In 1927 Sir Hugh became the Sydney
Chairman of Directors of Baldwin's steelworks. The couple lived at
<i>Bromley Cottage</i> in Water Street, Wahroonga.</p>

<p><b>Lady (Mary)</b> died in 1930 aged 62 <a href=

<p><b>Mary Wall</b> <i><a href="#fig28">(fig.28)</a></i> (née Hear
&mdash; d.1910 aged 78) was an Irish nursemaid in Henry Parkes'
home. She married <b>Nathaniel Wall</b> (d.1911 aged 93) and they
reared their seven children in a rented house in Sussex Street,
Sydney. <b>Nathaniel</b> purchased land in Asquith in 1880 and
established an orchard. <b>Mary</b> bought 60 acres of Berowra
bushland, developed an orchard and built a house with 14 rooms, one
of which was used as a part-time public school in the 1890s. Before
the railway came, <b>Granny Wall</b> took her fruits to the Sydney
markets by horse and dray. Wall Street in Asquith is named after
them <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1754.html">[EE25-26]</a>.</p>

<p><i><b>Suffer the Little Children</b></i>
</p>

<p>Babies' deaths were a frequent and inevitable part of 19th
century family life. Measles, typhoid, diphtheria, whooping cough,
gastro-enteritis and consumption (tuberculosis) all took their
toll. Until the advent of anaesthetics, surgery was limited. Many
young mothers died in childbirth and some infants were buried with
them. <b>Mary Gilles</b> survived only one hour and rests with her
mother, 30-year-old <b>Millie Gilles</b>, who died the following
day (1903). Their grave <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1695.html">[C-29]</a>
is marked by a red granite cross.</p>

<p>Ninety-one infants were buried in the cemetery before the turn
of the century, with the Burial Register recording the father's
name but seldom that of the mother. Infants were usually buried in
unmarked graves, such as 2-year-old <b>Aspinall Harrison</b>, who
died in 1888 while her father Rev. Thomas Harrison was serving at
St John's.</p>

<p>A sad story lies beneath the headstones of the <b>Cook</b>
family. <b>John Cook</b> (d.1931) and his wife <b>Maria</b> (d.1888
aged 43) were orchardists in Rosedale Road, Gordon. They lost four
young children, <b>Louisa</b> 2 yrs, <b>Joseph</b> 6 yrs,
<b>Emily</b> 9 months and <b>Lucy</b> 3 months, in a six-year
period (1879-1885). Their mother <b>Maria Cook</b> died three years
afterwards. Tragedy again struck five years later when 13-year-old
daughter <b>Priscilla</b>, who no doubt helped run her father's
household, also died. Yet <b>John Cook</b> survived these personal
tragedies, becoming a churchwarden and cemetery trustee at St
John's and living to a ripe 87 years. A son, <b>Mountford Cook</b>
(d.1922 aged 43), lived alone in the bush behind the orchard and
was found dead, reputedly murdered <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1871.html">[C3-7]</a>.</p>

<p>A century ago many people could not swim and at least three
burials resulted from drowning. The headstone <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person940.html">[EE-11]</a> of 12-year-old <b>George
Penman</b> (d.1911) records that he was <i>accidentally
drowned.</i></p>

<p><i>The Pymble News</i> (21.2.1901) wrote:</p>

<p class="letter">A lad named <b>Arthur Dunningham</b> was drowned
in a waterhole near Pymble on Monday. He went in for a swim and got
beyond his depth. A finding of accidental death was recorded.

<p><i><b>Civic Service</b></i>
</p>

<p>The following are some of the people interred in the cemetery
and columbarium who made significant contributions to the local and
wider communities:</p>

<p><b>Sir Kenneth McColl Anderson</b> (d.1985), former Minister for
Customs, Minister for Supply and Minister for Health and a senator
for NSW 1953-75, was given a state funeral on 3 April 1985 <a href=

<p><b>Dr John Job Crew Bradfield</b> <i><a href=
"#fig29">(fig.29)</a></i> (d.1943 aged 76) is remembered chiefly
for initiating the design of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Bradfield
Highway is named after him. A brilliant engineer and planner, he
worked for many years with the NSW Public Works Department and even
planned to irrigate central Australia. <b>Dr Bradfield</b> was very
influential in Ku-ring-gai Council planning. The model village of
Bradfield was named after him.</p>

<p>He, his wife <b>Edith Bradfield</b> (d.1954 aged 83) and their
family lived in Park Avenue, Gordon. Daughter <b>Mary Margaret

chief mechanical engineer of NSW Railways. He lived at <i>St
Erme,</i> Ingram Avenue, Wahroonga, with his second wife
<b>Gertrude</b> (née Steel, d.1942 aged 80) and children. A
controversial figure, he was elected a churchwarden at St Paul's,
Wahroonga in 1914. Many family members are buried in the plots
beneath the five white marble crosses <a href=

<p><b>James Conway</b> (d.1926 aged 78) was training master at Fort
Street Teachers' Training School and headmaster at Cleveland St.
School before retiring in 1913. His SMH obituary states that <i>Mr
Conway was one of the most eminent of the public school teachers of
his generation.</i> His headstone records that he was devoted to
public service as a teacher and mentor. Buried with him are his
wife <b>Charlotte</b> (d.1918 aged 55) who taught music and

(d.1915 aged 82), of French aristocratic descent, is known as
<i>the father of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park</i>. He and his
second wife <b>Blanche du Faur</b> (née Woolley, d.1906 aged 62)
had two sons and a daughter. A quiet and cultured man, <b>Eccleston

<p><b>James George Edwards</b> <a href="#fig31">(fig.31)</a>
(d.1927 aged 83), grandson of Robert Pymble I, was known as <i>the
father of Killara.</i> '<b>J. G.</b>' successfully petitioned for a
post office at Gordon (which his sister <b>Eliza Edwards</b> ran)
and was among the first to petition for a north shore railway line.
He was the first headmaster of Gordon Public School, providing
education for the children of timber-getters and orchardists. His
pupils delivered local letters which were handed out at school.
Involved in real estate, he subdivided and sold much land in
Killara and was prominent in local developments such as Killara
golf links and Killara railway station. He was also a journalist
and much of our knowledge of early Ku-ring-gai has come through his
writings <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1262.html">[S-3]</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>Hon. George Bertrand Edwards</b> (d.1911 aged 56) was a
gentleman farmer in North Turramurra, where he and his wife <b>Mary
Ann Edwards</b> (d.1928 aged 71) were among the first settlers.
They had six children. In 1895 he bought 50 acres of land there
(incorporating the present golf course) and built his home, <i>Huon
Park.</i> In 1901, he was elected member for South Sydney in the
first Federal Parliament <a href=

<p><b>John Fitzmaurice</b> (d.1924 aged 41), an Englishman with a
military background, was described as <i>big, vigorous and
dominating.</i> He was the founding principal of the <i>Abbotsholme
College</i> Killara from where the boys were marched to St John's
for Sunday morning services. Former Prime Ministers, Harold Holt
and William McMahon, attended his school. The sudden death from
heart failure of <b>Fitzmaurice</b>, a single man, on 28 July,
1924, received a wide press coverage. His burial service was

LESSONS FOR THE LIVING</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src=

</p>

<p>An oft-quoted reason for studying history is that by looking at
the past we can better plan for the future.</p>

<p>We may well ask, therefore, what lessons can be learnt from our
study of St John's cemetery?</p>

<p><i><b>Lessons for Legislators</b></i>
</p>

<p>Having looked at the development of the church and cemetery,
their roles in the life of the north shore, along with the
achievements of those buried there, one cannot but be impressed by
the cemetery's importance as a local heritage site. Indeed, it
encapsulates the story of this area's development and that of the
pioneers who made it possible. This secluded churchyard, tucked
away on prime north shore land, is a <i>living</i> reminder of our
heritage and those who formed it. It is important, therefore, that
it be preserved as such and that future legislators both at state
and local levels recognise this.</p>

<p>This is not to deny the fact that legislation governing the
administration of cemeteries may well need revision. It is
important to note that in St John's cemetery, and indeed in many
others, the purchase of a plot does not carry with it
<i>ownership</i> of that small parcel of land. Rather does this
purchase allow for the <i>right of burial</i> in that particular
plot. Up until now, this right has tended to be <i>in
perpetuity</i> and some plots have been purchased by families,
sometimes a century ago, but for various reasons have not been
used. Thus, although some burial sites are still available at St
John's, if the <i>in perpetuity</i> continues to apply, remaining
space in the cemetery is limited.</p>

<p>As graveyards throughout Australia fill or have been filled,
legislators and cemetery administrators are starting to consider
other options. The Department of Natural Resources has advised that
a bi-partisan committee is being formed to look at the
implementation of <i>renewable tenure.</i>* If approved, this would
involve unused burial rights older than 50 years being cancelled
and returned to the relevant cemetery authority subject to certain
conditions. Burial rights might then be on a basis of a 40-year
lease, at the end of which the grave would be available for re-use
unless the original family chose to renew their rights for a
further 20-year term. Re-use could well involve re-interment at a
greater depth and removal of existing monuments. Although
economically plausible, the subject is a touchy one which to date
politicians and cemetery administrators in Australia have preferred
to avoid.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Australian Cemeteries and Crematoria
Association, Melbourne Conference, 1993.</i> (Speakers' Notes)]</p>

<p>The trend towards cremation in recent years has helped to take
the pressure off dwindling burial sites and niches are still
available in St John's columbarium wall. Although columbaria are
easier to maintain, people have their own preferences regarding
burial or cremation.</p>

<p><i><b>Lessons for the Church and Community</b></i>
</p>

<p>The maintenance of the cemetery has been an on-going concern.
Weeds grow, branches break and headstones fall. As one rector
commented on his former parishioners: 'They're more trouble dead
than alive!'</p>

<p>Although the basic responsibility for grave maintenance rests
with the family, two or three generations down the track relatives
often don't know or don't care about family graves. Thus over the
years the cemetery trustees, namely the rector and churchwardens,
have come to realise that family members, many of whom have passed
on or moved from the district, cannot be relied on for grave
maintenance.</p>

<p>Back in 1951 St John's cemetery was over-run with blackberries,
lantana and weeds, with the fence-rails between the cemetery and
church falling down. Though accepting responsibility for pathways,
the trustees considered graves the responsibility of owners or
their descendants. One helpful parishioner offered her goat to keep
down the weeds, but mindful of the damage a goat could cause, the
trustees sprayed them instead.</p>

<p>In the late 1960s another cemetery clean-up was undertaken and
in 1984 the parish council formed a heritage committee, launching
an appeal known as the <i>Friends of St John's.</i> This committee
tried to trace relatives for historical information and donations
and sought National Trust advice on cemetery conservation.</p>

<p>The church community has recently undertaken <i>regular</i>
cemetery maintenance. A group of parishioners has devoted the first
Saturday morning of each month to tending the cemetery and
columbarium gardens. This maintenance work by volunteers, coupled
with the regular mowing of paths by ground staff to encourage a
lawn-cemetery effect, has greatly improved the cemetery's overall
appearance.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><i>[Fig.38] An example of a recent
lawn-style grave. <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/stjohns/people/person1000.html">[W-10]</a></i>
</p>

<p>It is also pleasing to note that this attention to maintenance
has helped promote the cemetery's image as an important local
heritage site. As a result students, community members and
municipal council groups are visiting St John's cemetery as part of
their heritage and conservation studies. In 1994 Venturers in the
First Gordon Scout Unit, working towards their Queen's Scout Award,
have helped undertake practical conservation work in conjunction
with the cemetery maintenance group. Each Venturer has also been
given the life of someone interred in the churchyard to research.
It is tremendously pleasing to see today's youth, tomorrow's
citizens, involved in such a community project.</p>

<p><i><b>Personal Lessons</b></i>
</p>

<p>Headstones in St John's cemetery provide valuable evidence of
the changing attitudes to death over the last century and a
quarter. Today its worth for the living has changed. In earlier
times, families were likely to visit loved ones' graves fairly
regularly. Sadly, in our present society this is more the exception
than the rule. Yet for someone seeking a temporary retreat from the
rush of modern life, the cemetery provides a peaceful haven. Here
we can meditate on things temporal and eternal, on life's brevity
and on our attitude to God and our fellow man.</p>

<p>As early as 1886, <i>The Book of Australian Etiquette</i>
advised bereaved families that <i>in fulfilling our duties for the
living, we best show the strength of our affection for the
dead.</i> These sentiments are as valid today as ever. <b>NOW</b>
is the time to show people that we love and care about them: a
friendly word of encouragement, a task quietly done. In the words
of my schoolmistress: <i>Please put your flowers on my table
&mdash; not on my grave!</i> So let us remember:</p>

<p class="poem">If with pleasure you are viewing<br>
Any work a man is doing,<br>
And you like him, or you love him,<br>
Tell him now!<br>
<br>
Don't withhold your approbation<br>
Till the parson makes oration,<br>
And he lies with snowing lilies<br>
O'er his brow.<br>
<br>
For no matter how you shout it<br>
He won't really care about it,<br>
He won't know how many tear drops<br>
You have shed.<br>
<br>
If you think some praise is due him,<br>
Now's the time to give it to him,<br>
For he cannot read his tombstone<br>
When he's dead.</p>
